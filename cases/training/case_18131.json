The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that allowing discovery to proceed will aid in the disposition of this case generally and the certification issue in particular, especially in light of the new evidence adduced at the certification hearing and related to the DOJ report. Moreover, the prejudice to Plaintiffs in being denied discovery during this time outweighs any prejudice to Defendants, particularly considering the facts (1) that the Fifth Circuit denied rehearing en banc in McNeal, and (2) that it is unlikely the Supreme Court will grant certiorari after it previously denied it for Crittindon. Accordingly, the administrative stay will be LIFTED for the limited purpose of allowing the parties to engage in post-certification hearing discovery. Any objections to specific discovery responses should be resolved first through Rule 37 discussions and then through a motion to be taken up by the Magistrate Judge in the first instance. If the parties desire a more formal schedule for discovery during the stay, they should confer in an attempt to amicably generate one. Should that fail, they can file a motion seeking same to be taken up by the Magistrate Judge. Signed by Judge John W. deGravelles on 04/19/2024. (This is a TEXT ENTRY ONLY. There is no hyperlink or PDF document associated with this entry.) (KDC) (Entered: 04/19/2024)"

    "summary": "<p>This entry includes two putative class action lawsuits challenging Louisiana's alleged practice of detaining prisoners longer than necessary after those prisoners receive \"time-served\" sentences.</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Humphrey v. LeBlanc,</em> on April 15, 2020, three former prisoners filed a putative&nbsp;class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. Represented by the civil rights firm Loevy &amp; Loevy, local counsel, and the Promise of Justice Initiative, a public interest group, the plaintiffs sued the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (DOC), under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Louisiana state law. The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages for their alleged over-detentions.</p>\r\n<p>All three named plaintiffs received sentences that were already complete upon sentencing due to the time they had already served prior to conviction. However, all three were held in DOC custody for weeks after their sentencing due to slow processing. Plaintiffs alleged that this constituted an illegal depravation of freedom under the 14th Amendment's due process clause. Moreover, plaintiffs alleged that the DOC has subjected \"thousands\" of criminal defendants in like situations to similar unlawful imprisonments and that the department's Secretary was \"deliberately indifferent\" to these alleged violations.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge John Wheadon deGravelles, sitting in Baton Rouge, LA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 3, 2020, seemingly prompted by this lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdla/pr/justice-department-announces-civil-investigation-louisianas-prison-release-practices?fbclid=IwAR0RWtMio_Z2Qf1x42cDgbGVHEmQ2O2sCXzGcLVQmJDKtvb92OR8hKOSJCY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched an investigation</a> under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act into Louisiana's prisoner release practices.</p>\r\n<p>After various discovery disputes, the plaintiffs filed their motion to certify class on July 21, 2022. The proposed class was: &ldquo;all persons who have been remanded to the custody of the DOC since April 16, 2019, and who were entitled to release at the time of their remand (either pursuant to sentencing or parole revocation), but who were released by the DOC more than 48 hours past the time that they were remanded to the DOC&rsquo;s custody.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On January 25, 2023, the Department of Justice issued its report, finding that from January 2022 to April 2022, 27 percent of the people who were legally entitled to be released from state custody, some for minor crimes or first-time offenses, were held past their release dates. About 24 percent of those improperly detained had been held 90 days or longer past their release dates. The Department of Justice found that these violations of people&rsquo;s due process rights were &ldquo;severe, systemic, and [were] both caused and perpetuated by serious ongoing deficiencies in LDOC&rsquo;s policies and practices.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On February 28, 2023, the parties met with the Court for a status conference regarding the DOJ report, but the parties declined to hold a settlement conference. The parties continued to engage in discovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Giroir v. LeBlanc</em> was a similar putative class action lawsuit filed on February 19, 2021 in the U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Louisiana by one of the plaintiffs in <em>Humphrey</em>, represented by the same counsel. The&nbsp;<em>Giroir&nbsp;</em>plaintiff raised the same claims as the <em>Humphrey </em>plaintiffs, but sought declaratory and injunctive relief instead of monetary relief. <em>Giroir </em>was also assigned to Judge deGravelles. On May 5, 2021, Judge deGravelles agreed to consolidate the two cases (<em>Humphrey v. LeBlanc</em> and <em>Giroir v. LeBlanc</em>) for discovery purposes only.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendants in <em>Giroir </em>moved to dismiss on April 9, 2021. The court ruled on the motion on March 30 of the following year, granting it in part and denying it in part. The court dismissed any claims from proposed class members sentenced prior to February 17, 2020 because they were barred by the statute of limitations. However, the court denied the motion to dismiss the claim for injunctive relief because the plaintiff had alleged enough facts to support that claim. 2022 WL 969614.</p>\r\n<p>As of December 25, 2023, the cases were ongoing, with motions to certify the class pending in both.</p>",

CLASS ACTION \n   \nJAMES LEBLANC, in his official capacity as   \nSecretary  of  the  Louisiana  Department  of  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nPublic Safety & Corrections; and   \nTHE  LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT  OF   \nPUBLIC SAFETY & CORRECTIONS,   \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nAMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  For years now, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (โthe \nDOCโ) has been unlawfully and knowingly overdetaining thousands of Louisiana residents in its \ncustody  every  year.  Defendant  James  LeBlanc,  Secretary  of  the  DOC,  has  known  about  this \nmisconduct since at least 2012. Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45, 48-49. Secretary LeBlanc has \nadmitted that the DOC is โlegally boundโ to release people on time, and he has admitted that the \nDOCโs chronic, unlawful overdetention is a โbig problem.โ Id. at 41. Yet the DOC has done little to \nfix this big problem, continuing to overdetain people as a matter of routine practice. \n2.  Many of these people are sentenced by a court to โtime servedโ or an equivalent \nsentence that legally entitles them to immediate release from the moment they are sentenced. But \nthey are not immediately released. Instead, as a standard practice, the DOC delays computation of \nrelease dates and, in the meantime, simply continues to detain people who should be free. Many are \nforced to sit for weeks or even months with no idea of when the DOC will get around to processing \ntheir paperwork and releasing them. The DOC, in other words, falsely imprisons thousands of \n1 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 2 of 21\n \npeople every year, upending lives, imposing punishment that no court has ordered, and creating \nuncertainty and misery for families across the state.  \n3.  Still, Secretary LeBlanc has not implemented any policy to ensure that the DOC \nstops overdetainingโand falsely imprisoningโLouisianans. The DOC overdetains so many people \nthat the DOC itself estimated that housing alone costs the state an extra $2.8M per year, Ex. 2, \nDOC Grant Application at 4, but Secretary LeBlanc has not attempted to reallocate that spending \ntoward new measures to prevent the DOC from holding people past their legal release dates. \n4.  Named Plaintiff Joel Giroir is a victim of the DOCโs misconduct. He seeks to \nrepresent a Class of all persons who were sentenced to the custody of the Louisiana DOC on or \nsince February 17, 2020, or who will be sentenced to the custody of the DOC in the future, and who \nwere, or will be, entitled to release at the time of their sentencing, but who nevertheless remain in \ncustody, now or in the future, for more than 48 hours past their sentencing dates. On behalf of the \nnumerous people subject to this unlawful practice, Mr. Giroir seeks injunctive and declaratory relief \nagainst this false and unlawful overdetention.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n1331 and 1343(a). It has jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 \nbecause those claims arise from the same events and are part of the same case and controversy as \nthe federal claims.  \n6.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \n2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 3 of 21\n \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir was eligible for immediate release upon his resentencing on \nJanuary 26, 2021, but the DOC has not yet released him from custody.1 He is currently being heldโ\nillegallyโat St. Tammany Parish Jail. Although he is in the St. Tammany Parish Jail, he is in DOC \ncustody. \n8.  James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the DOC and its final policymaker. He has served \nin that role since 2008. He is appointed by the Louisiana governor and is the chief executive officer \nfor the DOC. He formulates rules and regulations for the DOC, and he determines policy regarding \nmanagement, personnel, and total operations for the agency. He oversees the DOCโs central office \nand its field unit staff, who are charged with carrying out the work of the agency and protecting the \nrights of all persons held in DOC custody. At all relevant times, Secretary LeBlanc has acted under \ncolor of law. He can be served at 504 Mayflower Street, Baton Rouge, LA 70802.  \n9.  The Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (โDOCโ) oversees the \ncustody and care of adults in its custody and includes adults under probation and parole supervision, \npursuant to La. R.S. ยง 36:4. The domicile of the DOC and its divisions is the parish of East Baton \nRouge, city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pursuant to R.S. 15:821.1. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir \n10.  Joel Giroir is a 36-year-old man who is currently being imprisoned by the DOC in St. \nTammany Parish Jail. He is being overdetained and is entitled to immediate release. Ex. 3, Giroir \nDecl. at ยถยถ 1-2. \n                                                 \n1 Mr. Giroir was released from custody on February 22, 2021. He was still in custody when his complaint was \noriginally filed on February 19, 2021 (ECF No. 1) and when his original motion for class certification was \nfiled, also on February 19, 2021 (ECF No. 3). Thus, references to Mr. Giroirโs โcurrentโ overdetention have \nbeen left as they were alleged on that initial filing date, but Plaintiff does not allege that he remains \noverdetained as of the filing of this Amended Complaint. \n3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 4 of 21\n \n11.  Mr. Giroir has served enough jail time to be eligible for immediate release. He was \nheld on an attachment with no bond in case number 589-169 and held on a $5000 bond in case \nnumber 589-855 in St. Tammany Parish Jail from January 30, 2018, to March 13, 2018. He was held \nwith no bond on case numbers 589-855 and 589-169 from June 12, 2018 until July 19, 2018.  On \nJuly 19, 2018, he was sentenced to 90 days in DOC custody in lieu of revocation. He served 110 \ndays in Concordia Parish Jail. He turned himself into St. Tammany Parish Jail on January 22, 2021, \nand was incarcerated there until his revocation hearing date on January 26, 2021. Id. at ยถ 4. \n12.  On  January  26,  2021,  Mr.  Giroir  had  a  probation  revocation  and  resentencing \nhearing. He was sentenced to one year in DOC custody. Id. at ยถ 5. \n13.  Under  Louisianaโs  โgood  timeโ  law,  Mr.  Giroir  is  entitled  to  a  diminution  of \nsentence. La. Rev. Stat. ยง 15:571.3(B)(1)(a). Because of his good behavior and because he was not \nconvicted of a crime of violence, he is only required to serve 35 percent of his one-year sentence, or \n128 days. Ex. 3, Giroir Decl. at ยถ 6. \n14.  As of the date of his revocation and sentencing on January 26, 2021, Mr. Giroir had \nserved at least 192 days in jail on his one-year sentence. Thus, on the date of his sentencing, he was \neligible for immediate release. Id. at ยถ 7. \n15.  Mr. Giroir was not immediately released on January 26, 2021, even though he had \nalready served at least 64 days beyond his sentence. He still has not been released. He is being \noverdetained in DOC custody. Id. at ยถ 8. \nII.  The DOC Has a Pattern and Practice of Overdetaining People in Its Custody \n16.  Mr. Giroirโs case is not an aberrationโon the contrary, his false imprisonment \nthrough overdetention is the standard practice of the DOCโa standard practice that Defendants \nhave known about for at least eight years, yet have failed to change. \n4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 5 of 21\n \n17.  Defendants have been aware of the problem of overdetention in Louisiana since at \nleast 2012. \n18.  The DOC has no process in place for ensuring that persons entitled to immediate \nrelease upon sentencing are actually released upon sentencing, or any time promptly thereafter.  \n19.  Instead, the DOC detains such people for weeks and even months with no idea \nwhether it has a legal right to imprison them at all. For the DOC, such determinations are made in \nan unhurried process in which the agency (1) waits days or weeks for others to provide it with the \npersonโs sentencing order, and then (2) waits weeks to actually examine that sentencing order and \ndetermine whether the DOC has the legal authority to continue to detain the person. During all that \ntime, the person who should be freeโwhom a judge has already deemed eligible for immediate \nreleaseโlanguishes behind bars. Thousands of people in Louisiana suffer this fate every year. \n20.  To make matters worse, the leadership of the DOC, including Secretary LeBlanc, \nhave been acutely aware of this problem since at least 2012. And after making half-hearted efforts to \nmitigate the problem, they have essentially abandoned those efforts and have specifically endorsed \noverdetention as a normal practice. \nA.  The  DOC  Detains  Thousands  of  People Past Their Legal Release Dates \nEvery Year  \n21.  The DOC recognizes that a person who (1) has spent time in custody pretrial, (2) is \ngiven a sentence with credit for time served, and (3) has a sentence that is less than or equal to their \nperiod of pretrial custody is entitled to release on the day of their sentencing. See Ex. 4, Dep. of \nDOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 30-31. For example, a person who \nspent two months in jail awaiting sentencing, and is then sentenced to thirty days with credit for \ntime served, is entitled to release on the day of his sentencing.  \n22.  The DOC is responsible for a personโs overdetention from the day of sentencing, \neven if the person is not physically housed in a DOC facility.  \n5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 6 of 21\n \n23.  The DOC has conceded that a personโs โadmit dateโ to DOC custody is the date of \nthat personโs sentencing. Ex. 5, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Melanie Gueho at 53. Indeed, \nSecretary LeBlanc has explained that he is โresponsible for the inmates sentenced to the custody of \nthe DOC,โ whether they are in โa state-run facility, a parish-run facility, or private-facility.โ Ex. 1, \nDep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 13. \n24.  Any person who is detained past his or her legal release date is overdetained.  \n25.  The DOC admits that it is โlegally bound to release inmates on their release date.โ \nId. at 15.  Secretary LeBlanc has stated that he first learned โthat thousands of people in the custody \nof the Department of Corrections for whatever reason were being held past their release dateโ in \n2012. Id. at 48. But every investigation into the matter since that time has confirmed that the \nproblem continues; indeed, it has even come to the attention of judges and legislators. \n26.  In 2012, a team of DOC staff performed a review of its time calculation processes, \nwhich revealed a widespread pattern of people being held significantly past their legal release dates.  \n27.  Specifically, the investigation found that when the DOC calculated the release dates \nof inmates, 83% were eligible for โimmediate release . . . due to an earlier release date.โ Ex. 6, DOC \nLean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 4.  \n28.  The DOC learned through this investigation that it was overdetaining over 2,000 \npeople each year, with an average of 71.69 โoverdue daysโ per person who was overdetained. Ex. 7, \nDep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 20. \n29.  The DOC has admitted that this is โa lot of overdetention.โ Ex. 8, Dep. of DOC \n30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker at 33. \n30.  The 2012 review found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the \nDOC to obtain documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and the remainder was caused by \n6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 7 of 21\n \nthe DOC itself taking an average of approximately 79 days to calculate sentences after it had the \nsentencing documents in hand. Id.2 \n31.  Under Louisiana law, confining any person without legal authority amounts to false \nimprisonment.  \n32.  Under settled decisions by the United States Supreme Court, correctional facilities \nare allowed some time to ensure that an imprisoned personโs release is administratively proper, but \nin all events, it is presumptively unreasonable to imprison a person for more than 48 hours after they \nare entitled to release. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n33.  The DOCโs imprisonment of people for months after they are entitled to release \nviolates the laws of Louisiana and the United States. \n34.  No alarm was raised, however, following the 2012 study. After making their 2012 \nfindings, the DOC did not eliminate or even meaningfully mitigate the problem of overdetention. \nSecretary LeBlanc recently testified that he understood that โpeople [are still] being held [in DOC \ncustody] an average of about two months past their release date.โ Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc \nat 45. \n35.  Indeed, five years after the 2012 investigation, in 2017, another internal investigation \nreported that the DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days past \nthe end of their sentence.โ Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38.3   \n36.  So many people were being overdetained under this practice that it cost the state \nโ$2.8M per year in housing costs alone.โ Ex. 2, DOC Grant Application at 4. According to the \nDOC, this is โtaxpayer moneyโ that the โDOC should not have to spendโ on people whose \nsentences are complete. Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 35. \n                                                 \n2 โQ. So this approximately 79-day number represents the DOCโs, to the best of its knowledge in 2012, about \nhow long it was taking for documents to wait at the DOC to be calculated? A. Correct.โ. \n7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 8 of 21\n \n37.  Defendants took no meaningful action in response to the 2017 investigation either.  \n38.  As recently as 2019, the DOC compiled a set of data and found that it had held 231 \nindividuals past their legal release dates in a single month (February of 2019) for an average of 44 \nextra days. See Ex. 9, Feb. 2019 Pull Doc. \n39.  The  DOC  gathered  this  information  in  order  to  estimate  the  magnitude  of its \noverdetention problem as part of a grant application to the U.S. Department of Justice. The figures \nsuggest that over 2,000 people per year are still being overdetained, seven years after the DOC first \nidentified the problem. \n40.  The causes of this problem have been obvious since at least the 2012 investigation.  \n41.  The 2012 inquiry found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the \nDOC to receive documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and then, even after receiving the \nsentencing papers, the DOC was taking an average of approximately 79 additional days to complete \nthe process of calculating sentences. Ex. 8, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker \nat 33. \n42.  In fact, the DOC waits nearly 11 days on average to even begin calculating a personโs \ntime once the paperwork is obtained from the sheriff or court clerk.4 \n43.  As the DOCโs overdetention practices have continued, judges and state legislators \nhave repeatedly reminded Secretary LeBlanc of the problem. \n44.  On January 20, 2015, Judge Mary Doggett of the 9th Judicial District Court sent an \nemail that was forwarded to Secretary LeBlanc complaining that an individual had been held past his \n                                                                                                                                                             \n3 โQ. So itโs a true statement that the DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per month \nheld an average of 49 days past the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ. \n4 This number was obtained by calculating the average of the column โRECEIV TO COMPโ in Ex. 9, Feb. \n2019 Pull Doc. The โRECEIV TO COMPโ column provides, for each individual listed, the number of days \nthat passed between the DOC receiving the personโs paperwork and the DOC beginning the process of \ncalculating the personโs time. \n8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 9 of 21\n \nrelease date by nearly two months โin spite of several phone calls from Judge Randow for his \nrelease.โ Ex. 10, Secretary LeBlanc Emails 3-4.5 \n45.  On January 28, 2016, a state legislatorโs office emailed Secretary LeBlanc regarding \nan individual who had obtained โan order of immediate releaseโ more than two weeks prior, and \nwas โstill being detained and has been given no explanation of the delay.โ Id. at 10.6 \n46.  On February 21, 2019, Secretary LeBlanc received an email from Judge Jules D. \nEdwards of the 15th Judicial District Court to which Judge Edwards had attached three articles \nabout overdetention in Louisiana and information about a specific overdetained person. Judge \nEdwards added that โdefense attorneys in Lafayette are also complaining about the failure to timely \nrelease inmates from LPCC.โ Secretary LeBlancโs response indicated that he had read at least one of \nthe articles. Id. at 1-2.7 \nB.  Secretary  LeBlanc  Has  Been  Deliberately  Indifferent  to  the  DOCโs \nOverdetention of Thousands of Louisianans \n47.  Multiple  investigations since  2012, and repeated attempts to intervene  by  other \nbranches of Louisiana government, have done little to change the DOCโs pattern of overdetention. \nThe DOC has been content to tinker around the edges of the problem, while doing little to actually \nreduce or eliminate the mass false incarceration it is committing. \n48.  Upon learning of the scale of its overdetention problem in 2012, the DOC did not \nset a goal of eliminating the problem. Rather, it set a goal to โ[r]educe the percentage of Immediate \nReleases by 80% (from 2252 to 450/yr)โ and to โ[r]educe the average number of days per case for \n                                                 \n5 Email from Mary Lauve Doggett, District Judge, 9th JDC, to Cole Gralapp, District Administrator, \nProbation and Parole (Jan. 20, 2015, 4:48 PM) (forwarded to James LeBlanc Jan. 23, 2015, 1:54 PM). \n6 Email from the office of Chris Hazel, State Representative, House District No. 27, to James LeBlanc, \nSecretary, DOC (Jan. 28, 2016, 9:44 AM). \n7 Email from Jules D. Edwards III, District Judge, 15th JDC, to Rhett Covington, Assistant Secretary, DOC \n(forwarded to James LeBlanc Feb. 24, 2019, 6:14 PM). \n9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 10 of 21\n \nimmediate releases from 71.69 days (non CTRP) to 31 days.โ Ex. 6, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 \nPreClassification at 5.8 \n49.  After learning in 2017 that the DOC was still detaining people an average of about \ntwo months past their legal release dates even with action taken after the 2012 review, Secretary \nLeBlanc did not fire anyone. He did not demote anyone. He did not dock anyoneโs pay. He did not \neven reprimand anyone. Ex. 1., Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 48-49. He did not take any supervisory \naction to prevent his agency from continuing to detain people past their legal release dates. \n50.  Since that time, Secretary LeBlanc has not consulted with the heads of other statesโ \ndepartments of corrections about how they ensure that people are not detained past their legal \nrelease dates, aside from looking at some of the software that other states use. Id. at 103-04. \n51.  Secretary LeBlanc has suggested that overdetention might be somewhat lessened in \nLouisiana if the DOC were to go and pick up the paperwork necessary to process release dates \nrather than waiting for sheriffs and clerks to deliver it, id. at 80, 100-01, but neither Secretary \nLeBlanc nor the DOC has ever taken steps to implement that strategy. \n52.  Secretary LeBlanc has failed to adopt a policy proposed by a legislative auditor that \nwould impose a deadline on sheriffs to submit pre-classification packets to the DOC, despite his \nown admission that โthereโs no reason why [the DOC] couldnโtโ adopt such a policy and that he is \nโnot sure why we donโt, to be honest,โ and โwe could certainly, at least, make an attempt.โ9 \n                                                 \n8 The DOC estimated that if it could achieve these goals of reducing the percentage of overdetained people \nby 80% and reducing the average number of days of overdetention per person to 31 days, it could save the \nstate $3.7 million per year. Id. at 19. \n9 Crittindon v. Gusman, No. 3:17-cv-00512-SDD-EWD at 26 (M.D. La., Apr. 13, 2020) (order denying motions \nfor summary judgment) (โ[B]oth Secretary LeBlanc and Defendant Stagg testified in their depositions that \nthey were familiar with a proposal by the legislative auditor that such a deadline be implemented, and both \nmen expressed approval for the idea. In fact, when Secretary LeBlanc was asked at his deposition if it has \nโever been considered to include a timeframe for the submission of these materials to DOC,โ he responded: \nโNot that Iโm aware of, but thereโs no reason why we couldnโt. I mean, Iโm not sure why we donโt, to \nbe honest with you.โ Secretary LeBlanc added: โIโm not sure that we could enforce it to begin with, but we \ncould certainly, at least, make an attempt.โโ) (emphasis in original). \n10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 11 of 21\n \n53.  Secretary LeBlanc has not adopted any policy for the DOC requiring the immediate \ncalculation of sentences; instead, he has continued to permit sentences to be calculated in an ad hoc \nmanner after the DOC receives the relevant paperwork. \n54.  Eliminating the overdetention problem has remained a low priority. It has not even \nbeen included as a goal in the DOCโs strategic plans in any year from 2012 to the present. By \ncontrast, the DOC has set goals for itself in its strategic plans such as โMaintain the adult offender \ninstitution population at a minimum of 99% of design capacity through 2019.โ \n55.  Further, the DOC has declined help when offered. In 2019, the executive director of \nthe Louisiana Clerks of Court Association, Debbie Hudnall, had a series of meetings with the DOC \nand Secretary LeBlanc. Ms. Hudnall suggested that, to speed things up, the Clerks of Court could \nbegin  emailing  sentencing  documents  to  the  DOC.  The  DOC  declined,  claiming  without \nexplanation that they โdonโt have the capability of receiving that.โ Testimony of Debbie Hudnall, \nLouisiana House of Representatives, Judiciary Committee, Jan. 15, 2020, at 1:03:35.10 \n56.  Further, after his meeting with Ms. Hudnall, Secretary LeBlanc state that he would \nโdevelop an action plan with you and the Sheriffs' Offices in these areas to improve upon this \nturnaround  timeโ  and  โlook  at  the  feasibility  of  receiving  the  UCO  and  Bill  of  Information \ndocuments electronically.โ \n57.  But Secretary LeBlanc has never developed that action plan.  \n58.  And he never conducted the feasibility study. \n59.  Aside from the specific investigations in 2012, 2017, and 2019, the DOC does not \neven keep a record or count of individuals who have been overdetained. See Ex. 4, Dep. of DOC \n30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 29. \n60.  Indeed, the DOC has endorsed overdetention as a matter of policy.  \n                                                 \n10 http://house.louisiana.gov/H_Video/VideoArchivePlayer.aspx?v=house/2019/dec/1212_19_JU. \n11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 12 of 21\n \n61.  At least as late as May 2019, the DOC websiteโs โFrequently Asked Questionsโ page \nstated, โIf a person has recently been sentenced to DOC custody, it can take up to 12 weeks to \ncalculate a date as the Department has to receive official paperwork from the sentencing court in \norder to calculate the offenderโs release date.โ The DOC has since removed the reference to taking \nโup to 12 weeks to calculate a date,โ a timeframe even Secretary LeBlanc conceded was โridiculousโ \nand โabsurd.โ Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 88-90. \n62.  The DOC also included an audio statement in its voicemail recording saying that it \nโtakes at least 90 days after sentencingโ for the department to calculate a personโs time. This \nstatement was finally removed from the voicemail recording in or around February or March of \n2019. See Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 12-13. \n63.  These  voicemail  and  website  statements  reveal  both  the  scope  of  the  DOCโs \nmisconduct and Defendantsโ indifference to it; their purpose was to discourage family members \nfrom โinundat[ing]โ the DOC with questions about when their loved onesโwho had been told by a \njudge that they were free to rejoin their familiesโwould actually be released. See Ex. 1, Dep. of \nSecretary LeBlanc at 89; see also Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 18. \n64.  Mr. Giroir is one of thousands of people who have been wrongfully imprisoned as a \nresult of Secretary LeBlancโs demonstrated indifference to the DOCโs unlawful conduct. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n65.  Named Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this action, on behalf of himself and all others \nsimilarly situated, to assert the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common basis. \n66.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 13 of 21\n \nI.  The Plaintiff Class \n67.  Named Plaintiff proposes a class defined as all persons who were sentenced to the \ncustody of the Louisiana DOC on or since February 17, 2020, or who will be sentenced to the \ncustody of the DOC in the future, and who were, or will be, entitled to release at the time of their \nsentencing, but who nevertheless remain in custody, now or in the future, for more than 48 hours \npast  their  sentencing  dates.  The  Class  seeks  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  against  this \noverdetention and false imprisonment. \nII.  Rule 23(a) \n68.  The proposed class satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a). \nA.  Numerosity โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n69.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The most \nrecent overdetention data from the DOC (from February of 2019) shows that over 200 individuals \nwere  overdetained  in  a  single  month,  suggesting  that  the  DOC  overdetains  more  than  2,000 \nindividuals over the course of a year. This 2019 count was consistent with data from 2017, which \nshowed that the DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held . . . past the end of their \nsentence.โ Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38.11 Upon information and \nbelief,  the  DOC  has  not  implemented  any  meaningful  changes  that  might  have  significantly \nmitigated the rate of overdetention that was captured in the February 2019 snapshot. Plaintiff \ntherefore estimates a class size of approximately 200 current members, with over 2,000 estimated \nindividuals who will become class members during the course of the next year. \n                                                 \n11 โQ. So itโs a true statement that the DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per month \nheld an average of 49 days past the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ \n13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 14 of 21\n \nB.  Commonality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n70.  All members of the proposed Class are subject to the same systemic unconstitutional \npolicies, acts, and omissions on the part of Defendants described in this Complaint, and all are \nsuffering or will suffer violations of their constitutional rights and their rights under state law as a \nresult of the DOCโs pattern and practice of overdetaining people in its custody. \n71.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the class. \n72.  Questions of law that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \n๏ท  Whether  the  DOC  has  the  legal  authority  to  hold  class  members  past  their \nsentencing dates under the United States Constitution; \n๏ท  Whether Class Members have a liberty interest in their immediate release upon \nsentencing under the United States Constitution; \n๏ท  Whether Defendantsโ failure to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention \nconstitutes deliberate indifference; \n๏ท  Whether  the  DOC  has  the  legal  authority  to  hold  class  members  past  their \nsentencing dates under the Louisiana Constitution; \n๏ท  Whether Class Members have a liberty interest in their immediate release upon \nsentencing under the Louisiana Constitution; and \n๏ท  Whether  the  DOCโs  detention  of  Class  Members  past  their  legal  release  dates \nconstitutes false imprisonment under state law. \n \n73.  Questions of fact that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \n๏ท  Whether the DOC has a pattern of overdetaining people in its custody; \n๏ท  Whether Defendants are aware of the DOCโs pattern of overdetaining people;  \n๏ท  Whether the DOC is responsible for people sentenced to DOC custody from the \nday they are sentenced; and \n๏ท  Whether Defendants failed to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention. \n \n74.  Defendants  are  expected  to  raise  common  defenses  to  these  claims,  including \ndenying that their actions violate the law. \n14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 15 of 21\n \nC.  Typicality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n75.  Named Plaintiffโs claims are typical of those of the Class, as his claims arise from the \nsame policies, practices, or courses of conduct as those of the Class, and his claims are based on the \nsame theories of law as the Classโs claims. Named Plaintiff Joel Giroir was eligible for immediate \nrelease upon his sentencing, and the DOC has held him in custody past his sentencing date. See Ex. \n3, Giroir Decl. Mr. Giroir is therefore typical of the putative Class, and he suffers the same injury of \noverdetention described in this Complaint.  \nD.  Adequacy โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n76.  Named Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the Class because his interests in the \nvindication of the legal claims that he raises are entirely aligned with the interests of the other Class \nMembers, who each have the same basic constitutional claims. Named Plaintiff is a member of the \nClass, and his interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the other Class Members. \n77.  There are no known conflicts of interest among Class Members, all of whom have a \nsimilar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights. \n78.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Promise of Justice Initiative, Loevy \nand Loevy, and Most & Associates, who have experience in litigating complex civil rights matters, \nincluding class actions, related to prisonersโ rights in federal court and extensive knowledge of both \nthe details of the DOC and the relevant constitutional and statutory law. Most & Associates has \nlitigated a number of individual overdetention cases in Louisiana, and all class counsel are currently \nlitigating a class action case involving overdetention in Louisiana, Humphrey v. LeBlanc, 20-cv-233 \n(M.D. La). \n79.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of local law and practices as they relate \nto federal constitutional requirements. \n15 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 16 of 21\n \nIII.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n80.  Class action status is appropriate because Defendants have acted or will act in the \nsame  unconstitutional  manner  with  respect  to  all  Class  Members.  Defendants  unlawfully  and \nknowingly detain thousands of Louisianans past their legal release dates every year. \n81.  The Class therefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants from \ncontinuing to overdetain and falsely imprison people in their custody. Because the putative Class \nchallenges Defendantsโ conduct as unconstitutional through declaratory and injunctive relief, which \nwould apply the same relief to every Class Member, Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate and \nnecessary. \n82.  Injunctive  relief  compelling  Defendants  to  comply  with  Class  Membersโ \nconstitutional rights will similarly protect each Class Member from being subjected to Defendantsโ \nunlawful  policies  and  practices.  A  declaration  and  injunction  stating  that  Defendants  cannot \ncontinue to detain people past their legal release dates would provide relief to every Class Member. \nTherefore, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Class as a whole is appropriate. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n83.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n84.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n85.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution is violated where a person remains incarcerated after the legal authority to hold that \nperson has expired. See Douthit v. Jones, 619 F.2d 527, 532 (5th Cir. 1980). No privilege enables a \njailor to detain a person beyond the period of that personโs lawful sentence. See Whirl v. Kern, 407 \n16 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 17 of 21\n \nF.2d 781, 791 (5th Cir. 1968); see also Powell v. Barrett, 376 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1351 (N.D. Ga. 2005) \n(detainee has constitutional right to be free from continued detention after it was or should have \nbeen known that he was entitled to release). \n86.  The DOCโs legal authority to detain Plaintiff Joel Giroir expired on the day of his \nsentencing, January 26, 2021. Yet pursuant to an unlawful standard practice that has existed for \nyears, the DOC continues to detain Plaintiff. \n87.  The DOC is falsely imprisoning Plaintiff pursuant to a practice that has existed for \nyears in which it waits weeks and even months to determine whether it has lawful authority to \nimprison persons who in fact were entitled to release on the day of their sentences. That practice is \ninjuring the hundreds of members of the putative class, as described in this Complaint. \n88.  Secretary LeBlanc has been aware of this practice since at least 2012, but he has not \nattempted to stop it; instead, Defendants have attempted to normalize their own misconduct.  \n89.  Secretary LeBlancโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to prevent overdetention is \nโdeliberately indifferentโ because โit is obvious that the likely consequences of not adopting a policy \nwill be a deprivation of constitutional rights.โ Rhyne v. Henderson Cnty., 973 F.2d 386, 392 (5th Cir. \n1992). \n90.  In  failing  to  adopt  any  policy  to  prevent  predictable  overdetention,  Secretary \nLeBlanc acted with deliberate indifference. This is evidenced by the fact that every investigation into \nthe matter since 2012 has shown that overdetention is a persistent and widespread problem in \nLouisiana, yet Secretary LeBlanc did not create any policy to attempt to remedy the problem. \n91.  Through his deliberate indifference, Secretary LeBlanc is depriving Mr. Giroir, and \nall Members of the putative Class he seeks to represent, of the fundamental right to liberty and \nviolating their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, causing the injuries described \nin this Complaint. \n17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 18 of 21\n \nCOUNT II \nDue Process under Article I, Section 2 of the Louisiana Constitution \n92.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n93.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n94.  Article One, Section Two of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 guarantees that \nโ[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law.โ  \n95.  By reason of the same conduct that violates Plaintiffโs federal constitutional rights, \nDefendants violate Plaintiffโs state constitutional rights to liberty and due process, as well as the state \nconstitutional rights of the putative class he seeks to represent, causing the injuries described in this \nComplaint. \nCOUNT III \nFalse Imprisonment under State Law \n96.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n97.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n98.  Defendants are committing the tort of false imprisonment against Plaintiff because \nthe DOC is โrestrain[ing] [Plaintiff] against his will without a warrant or other statutory authority,โ \nKyle v. City of New Orleans, 353 So.2d 969, 971 (La. 1977); see also Miller v. Desoto Regional Health Sys., \n128 So.3d 649, 655-56 (La. App. 3d Cir. 2013), beyond Plaintiffโs legal release date. By definition, \nthe Class Members Plaintiff seeks to represent are also falsely imprisoned by Defendants because \nthey  are,  or  will  be,  unlawfully  detained  beyond  their  legal  release  dates,  causing  the  injuries \ndescribed in this Complaint. \n18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 19 of 21\n \nCOUNT IV \nState Law Negligence \n99.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n100.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n101.  Defendants owe duties to avoid overdetention to persons in DOC custody, including \nPlaintiff and the members of the putative Class. Porter v. Epps, 659 F. 3d 440, 445 (5th Cir. 2011) (a \njailor has โnot only the duty to protect a prisoner, but also the duty to effect his timely release.โ). \n102.  These duties are being breached by Defendantsโ acts and omissions, including the \nfailure to timely release Plaintiff and the putative Class Members. \n103.  The  risks and harms that Defendants cause are within the scope of protection \nafforded by the duties Defendants owe to Plaintiff and to the putative Class Members. \n104.  As  a  result  of  Defendantsโ  acts  and omissions,  Plaintiff and the putative Class \nMembers are suffering actual, foreseeable harm, as described in this Complaint. \nCOUNT V \nState Law Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n105.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n106.  Defendants have acted intentionally or recklessly regarding the false imprisonment \nand overdetention of Mr. Giroir and the Members of the putative Class. \n107.  Defendantsโ conduct is extreme and outrageous, and it is rooted in an abuse of \npower and authority over the freedom of Mr. Giroir and the Members of the putative Class. \n19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 46    04/27/22   Page 20 of 21\n \n108.  Defendantsโ misconduct is causing severe emotional distress, induced by weeks and \neven months of caging in crowded, dangerous jails and prisons of persons who are legally entitled to \nbe free.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiff Joel Giroir requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor, and in \nfavor of the putative class he seeks to represent, against Defendants and order the following relief: \n(a) An order and judgment declaring that Defendantsโ practice of routinely allowing \nindividuals to be incarcerated past their legal release dates violates Plaintiffโs \nrights under the United States Constitution as well as the state law rights of the \nclass Plaintiff seeks to represent; \n \n(b) An  order  and  judgment  enjoining  Defendants  from  continuing  to  allow \nindividuals  to  be  incarcerated  past  their  legal  release  dates  and  ordering \nDefendants to establish procedures to prevent all such overdetention; \n \n(c) An order and judgment requiring Defendants to calculate sentences and release \nas soon as reasonably feasible, and in no event longer than 48 hours after the \nperson is sentenced, for all persons sentenced to the custody of the DOC who \nare eligible for immediate release upon sentencing; \n \n(d) An order and judgment ordering Defendants to release Plaintiff and all members \nof the class Plaintiff seeks to represent; \n \n(e) An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and all other applicable laws; and  \n \n(f)  Any other relief this Court deems proper. \n \nJURY DEMAND \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues \nso triable. \nRespectfully submitted this 27th day of April, 2022. \n \n/s/ Mercedes Montagnes \nMercedes Montagnes, La.

For years now, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (โthe \nDOCโ) has been unlawfully and knowingly overdetaining thousands of Louisiana residents in its \ncustody  every  year.  Defendant  James  LeBlanc,  Secretary  of  the  DOC,  has  known  about  this \nmisconduct since at least 2012.2 Secretary LeBlanc has admitted that the DOC is โlegally boundโ to \nrelease people on time, and he has admitted that the DOCโs chronic, unlawful overdetention is a \nโbig problem.โ3 Yet Secretary LeBlanc has done little to fix the big problem. \n2.  By  overdetaining  Louisianans  as  a  matter  of  policy,  the  DOC  is  usurping  the \nsentencing authority that belongs to Louisianaโs judiciary. Many of these people are sentenced by a \ncourt or a parole board to โtime servedโ or an equivalent sentence or parole or probation revocation \ndetermination that legally entitles them to immediate release from the moment they are sentenced or \nhave their parole or probation revoked. But they are not immediately released. Instead, as a standard \npractice,  the  DOC  drags  its  feet  computing  their  release  dates  and,  in  the  meantime,  simply \n \n1 Plaintiffs file this amendment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2), with leave \ngranted by the Court. See ECF 35.  \n2 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45, 48-49.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 2 of 25\n \ncontinues to detain people who should be free and whom the DOC has no legal authority to \nimprison. Many are forced to sit for weeks or even months with no idea of when the DOC will get \naround  to  processing  their  paperwork  and  releasing  them.  The  DOC,  in  other  words,  falsely \nimprisons thousands of people every year, degrading lives and creating uncertainty and misery for \nfamilies across the state.  \n3.  Still, Secretary LeBlanc has not implemented any policy to ensure that the DOC \nstops overdetainingโand falsely imprisoningโLouisianans. Overdetention costs the state at least \n$2.8M per year,4 but Secretary LeBlanc has not attempted to reallocate that spending toward new \nmeasures to prevent the DOC from holding people past their legal release dates. Meanwhile, the \nDOC simply pretends that overdetention is an acceptable part of a personโs punishment, when by \nlaw it is not. \n4.  Named Plaintiffs Brian Humphrey, Joel Giroir, and Bryant White were victims of the \nDOCโs misconduct. They seek to represent a Class of all persons who have been remanded to the \ncustody of the DOC since April 16, 2019 (pursuant to a criminal sentence or a parole or probation \nrevocation), and who were entitled to release at the time they were remanded to the DOCโs custody, \nbut who were released by the DOC more than 48 hours past the time that they were remanded. On \nbehalf of the numerous people subject to this unlawful practice, the Named Plaintiffs seek to have \neach  putative  class  member  recover  the  damages  they  suffered  from  their  false  and  unlawful \noverdetention.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has original jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a). It has jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n \n3 Id. at 41. \n4 Ex. 2, DOC Grant Application at 4. \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 3 of 25\n \nยง  1367  because  those  claims  arise  from  the  same  events  and are  part  of  the  same  case  and \ncontroversy as the federal claims.  \n6.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Defendant resides in \nthis judicial district, and because a substantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims \noccurred in this judicial district. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey was eligible for immediate release upon his sentencing on \nApril 16, 2019,5 but the DOC did not release him from custody until May 13, 2019,6 the day that the \nDOC finally computed his release date and found him eligible for immediate release.7 The DOC did \nnot compute Mr. Humphreyโs release date or set him free until 17 days after the DOC received his \npaperwork from the Bossier Parish Sheriffโs Office on April 26, 2019, and 27 days after he was \nsentenced on April 16.8 \n8.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir was eligible for immediate release upon his probation revocation \nand resentencing hearing on January 26, 2021. Instead he was detained for weeks beyond his legal \nrelease date and was not released until February 22, 2021. \n9.  Plaintiff Bryant White was eligible for immediate release from the Orleans Parish jail \nafter pleading guilty on charges with credit for time served, on March 1, 2021, but instead was \nplaced on a โparole holdโ for weeks and was not released until April 23, 2021. \n10.  Defendant James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the DOC and its final policymaker. He \nis sued in his individual capacity. He has served in that role since 2008. He is appointed by the \nLouisiana governor and is the chief executive officer for the DOC, which includes both prisons and \nthe Board of Pardons and Parole. He formulates rules and regulations for the DOC, and he \n \n5 Ex. 3, Humphrey Sentencing Minutes at 2. \n6 Ex. 4, Humphrey Certificate of Release. \n7 Ex. 5, Humphrey Release Date Computation Information. \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 4 of 25\n \ndetermines  policy  regarding  management,  personnel,  and  total  operations  for  the  agency.  He \noversees the DOCโs central office and its field unit staff, who are charged with carrying out the work \nof the agency and protecting the rights of all persons held in DOC custody. Secretary LeBlanc was \naware of and consciously disregarded a substantial risk of overdetention to the putative Class. He \nwas aware of the overdetention problem but failed to exert the supervision necessary to end it. At all \nrelevant times, Secretary LeBlanc has acted under color of law.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Named Plaintiffs Were Overdetained for More than 48 Hours by the DOC after They \nWere Entitled to Immediate Release  \nA.  Brian Humphrey \n11.  On April 16, 2019, the 26th Judicial District Court in Bossier Parish sentenced Mr. \nHumphrey to โ3 years hard labor in the Louisiana Department of Corrections.โ In issuing that \nsentence, however, the Court simultaneously gave Mr. Humphrey credit for the time he had already \nserved in jail, and ordered further that the sentence should โsuspend all but time served.โ9 In other \nwords, Mr. Humphreyโs sentencing judge gave him credit for the time he had served in jail, and \notherwise suspended his sentence. Thus, as of the date of his sentencing, Mr. Humphrey had served \nhis entire sentence. He should have been released immediately. \n12.  That did not happen. Instead, the Bossier Parish Sheriff took Mr. Humphrey back \ninto the jail. Then, on April 18, 2019, Mr. Humphrey was transported to Webster โ Bayou Dorcheat \nCorrectional Center Transitional Work Program, a DOC facility. There Mr. Humphrey, who by law \nshould have been a free man, waited in prison for weeks, until the DOC got around to reviewing his \npapers and finally released him.  \n \n8 Ex. 6, Facsimile Transmittal Sheet. \n9 Ex. 3, Humphrey Sentencing Minutes at 2. \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 5 of 25\n \n13.  From the date of his sentencing on April 16, 2019, Mr. Humphrey was in the \ncustody of the DOC. On information and belief, during the first ten days of Mr. Humphreyโs \ncustody, the DOC made no attempt to determine whether it had any legal right to imprison him. \n14.  Then, on April 26, 2019, the Bossier Sheriffโs Office sent to the DOC paperwork \nthat the Sheriff had received from the Clerk of Court of the 26th Judicial District. This paperwork \ncontained a note that read โ3 years HC DOC all but time served suspended.โ10 Mr. Humphreyโs \nUniform  Sentencing  Commitment  Order  notes  โ0โ  years,  โ0โ  months,  and  โ0โ  days  under \nโAmount of Time in DPS&C custody.โ11 Also on April 26, 2019, the Bossier Sheriffโs Office faxed \n14  pages  of  โpre-classโ  information  on  Mr.  Humphrey  to  the  Bayou  Dorcheat  Correctional \nCenter,12 where Mr. Humphrey was being held in DOC custody. \n15.  This paperwork made plain that Mr. Humphrey should have been a free man already, \nand that the DOC had no right to detain him. But the DOC did not release him. Instead, with the \npaperwork in hand, the DOC waited more than two weeks to determine whether it had any \nauthority to imprison Mr. Humphrey at all. \n16.  On May 13, 2019, the DOC completed Mr. Humphreyโs time computation, resulting \nin a calculation of 0 days.13 Mr. Humphreyโs โmust serveโ time was calculated to be -114 days.14 Any \nperson whose โmust serveโ comes to a negative number is eligible for immediate release.15 \n17.  That same day, May 13, 2019, the DOC issued a โCertificate of Releaseโ for Mr. \nHumphrey certifying his โCompletion of Sentence.โ16 \n \n10 Ex. 7, Humphrey DOC Basic Information Interview for Local Jail Facilities. \n11 Ex. 8, Humphrey Uniform Sentencing Commitment Order. \n12 Ex. 6, Facsimile Transmittal Sheet. \n13 Ex. 5, Humphrey Release Date Computation Information. \n14 Ex. 9, Humphrey Time Computation and Jail Credits. \n15 Ex. 10, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (Jan. 10, 2020) at 87. \n16 Ex. 4, Humphrey Certificate of Release. \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 6 of 25\n \n18.  Mr. Humphrey was released from DOC custody on May 13, 2019, at 5:30 PM, 27 \ndays after he was entitled for immediate release upon his sentencing and 17 days after the DOC \nreceived his paperwork from the Bossier Sheriffโs Office. \nB.  Joel Giroir17 \n19.  Joel Giroir is a 36-year-old man who was overdetained by the DOC in the St. \nTammany Parish Jail.  \n20.  Mr. Giroir was held on an attachment with no bond in case number 589-169 and \nheld on a $5,000 bond in case number 589-855 in St. Tammany Parish Jail from January 30, 2018, to \nMarch 13, 2018. He was held with no bond on case numbers 589-855 and 589-169 from June 12, \n2018 until July 19, 2018. On July 19, 2018, he was sentenced to 90 days in DOC custody in lieu of \nrevocation. He served 110 days in Concordia Parish Jail. He turned himself into St. Tammany Parish \nJail on January 22, 2021, and was incarcerated there until his revocation hearing date on January 26, \n2021.  \n21.  On  January  26,  2021,  Mr.  Giroir  had  a  probation  revocation  and  resentencing \nhearing. He was sentenced to one year in DOC custody.  \n22.  Under  Louisianaโs  โgood  timeโ  law,  Mr.  Giroir  is  entitled  to  a  diminution  of \nsentence. La. Rev. Stat. ยง 15:571.3(B)(1)(a). Because of his good behavior and because he was not \nconvicted of a crime of violence, he is only required to serve 35 percent of his one-year sentence, or \n128 days.  \n23.  As of the date of his revocation and sentencing on January 26, 2021, Mr. Giroir had \nserved at least 192 days in jail on his one-year sentence. Thus, on the date of his sentencing, he was \neligible for immediate release.  \n \n17  Ex. 18, Declaration of Joel Giroir. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 7 of 25\n \n24.  Mr. Giroir was not immediately released on January 26, 2021, even though he had \nalready served at least 64 days beyond his sentence. Instead, he was held in the jail until February 22, \n2021. \nC.  Bryant White18 \n25.  Bryant White was overdetained by the DOC in the Orleans Parish jail for more than \nseven weeks. \n26.  In 2013 Mr. White was sentenced on a criminal conviction, served time in prison, \nand was later released on parole.  \n27.  On March 12, 2019, while he was on parole for the 2013 sentence, Mr. White was \narrested in Orleans Parish and confined to the Orleans Parish jail. A parole hold was then placed on \nMr. White, on April 4, 2019.  \n28.  On March 1, 2021, while still in the custody of the Orleans Parish jail, Mr. White \npleaded guilty to two felony charges stemming from the March 12, 2019 arrest, and was sentenced \nto 6 months and 23 months to run concurrently, with credit for the time he had served in the \nOrleans Parish jail since March 12, 2019.  \n29.  By the time of his plea, Mr. White had served 697 days in jail since March 12, 2019. \nUnder Louisianaโs โgood timeโ law, he was entitled to a diminution of the remainder of his 2013 \nsentence for which the DOC had issued the parole hold. As such, under Louisianaโs sentencing laws, \nthe DOC should have โrevokedโ his parole at the time of his March 1, 2021 plea, and, with credit \nfor the 697 days he had served, he should have been released immediately. \n30.  Mr. White was not released on March 1, 2021, however. Instead, the DOC took \nmore than seven weeks to revoke his parole, finally doing so on April 23, 2021. During that time Mr. \nWhite was imprisoned in the Orleans Parish jail by the DOC on the parole hold, even though the \n \n18 Ex. 19, Declaration of Bryant White. \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 8 of 25\n \nDOC  lacked  legal authority  to  imprison  him  on  the  parole  hold  after  his  March  1  plea  and \nsentencing.  \nII.  The DOC Has a Pattern and Practice of Overdetaining People in Its Custody \n31.  The  Named  Plaintiffsโ  cases  were  not  aberrationsโto  the  contrary,  their  false \nimprisonment through overdetention is the standard practice of the DOC, a standard practice that \nDefendant LeBlanc has known about for at least eight years, yet has failed to change.  \n32.  The DOC has no process in place for ensuring that persons entitled to immediate \nrelease upon sentencing or parole or probation revocation are actually released on time, or any time \nquickly thereafter. Instead, the DOC detains such people for weeks and even months with no idea \nwhether it has a legal right to imprison them at all. For the DOC, such determinations are made in \nan unhurried process in which the DOCโs central office responsible for computing time and issuing \nrelease instructions (1) waits days or weeks for others to provide it with the personโs sentencing or \nparole or probation revocation paperwork, and then (2) waits days or weeks to actually examine the \npaperwork and determine whether the DOC has the legal authority to detain the person. During all \nthat time, the person who should be freeโwhom a judge or parole board has already deemed \neligible for immediate releaseโlanguishes behind bars. Thousands of people in Louisiana suffer this \nfate every year. \n33.  To make matters worse, the leadership of the DOC, including Defendant LeBlanc, \nhave been acutely aware of this problem since at least 2012. And after making half-hearted efforts to \nmitigate the problem, they have shifted instead to justify and normalize the false imprisonment of \nthousands of Louisianans every year. \nA.  The DOC Detains Thousands of People Past Their Legal Release Dates \nEvery Year  \n34.  The DOC recognizes that a person who (1) has spent time in custody pretrial, (2) is \ngiven a sentence with credit for time served, and (3) has a sentence that is less than or equal to their \n8 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 9 of 25\n \nperiod of pretrial custody is entitled to release on the day of their sentencing.19 For example, a \nperson who spent two months in jail awaiting sentencing, and is then sentenced to thirty days with \ncredit for time served, is entitled to release on the day of his sentencing.  \n35.  The DOC is responsible for a personโs overdetention from the day of sentencing or \nparole or probation revocation, even if the person is not yet in a DOC facility. The DOC has \nconceded that a personโs โadmit dateโ to DOC custody is the date of that personโs sentencing,20 and \nthe equivalent is true when a personโs parole or probation is revoked. Indeed, Secretary LeBlanc has \nexplained that he is responsible for the inmates remanded โto the custody of the DOC,โ whether \nthey are in โa state-run facility, a parish-run facility, or private-facility.โ21 \n36.  Any person who is detained past their legal release date is overdetained. The DOC \nadmits that it is โlegally bound to release inmates on their release date.โ22 Secretary LeBlanc has \nstated  that  he  first  learned  โthat  thousands  of  people  in  the  custody  of  the  Department  of \nCorrections for whatever reason were being held past their release dateโ in 2012.23 But every \ninvestigation into the matter since that time has confirmed that the problem continues; indeed it has \neven come to the attention of judges and legislators. \n37.  In 2012, a team of DOC staff performed a review of its time calculation processes, \nwhich revealed a widespread pattern of people being held past their legal release dates. Specifically, \nthe investigation found that when the DOC calculated the release dates of inmates, 83% were \neligible for โimmediate release . . . due to an earlier release date.โ24 The DOC learned through this \ninvestigation that it was overdetaining over 2,000 people each year, with an average of 71.69 \n \n19 See Ex. 11, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 30-31. \n20 Ex. 12, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Melanie Gueho at 53. \n21 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 13. \n22 Id. at 15. \n23 Id. at 48. \n24 Ex. 13, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 4. \n9 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 10 of 25\n \nโoverdue daysโ per person who was overdetained.25 The DOC has admitted that this is โa lot of \noverdetention.โ26 \n38.  The 2012 review found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the \nDOC to receive documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and the remainder was caused by \nthe DOC itself taking an average of approximately 79 days to calculate release dates after it had the \nsentencing documents in hand.27 \n39.  These 2012 findings should have set off alarm bells. Under Louisiana law, confining \nany person without legal authority amounts to false imprisonment. Under settled decisions by the \nUnited States Supreme Court, meanwhile, correctional facilities are allowed some time to ensure that \nan imprisoned personโs release is administratively proper, but in all events, it is presumptively \nunreasonable to imprison a person for more than 48 hours after they are entitled to release.28 The \nDOCโs imprisonment of people for months after they are entitled to release flagrantly violates the \nlaws of Louisiana and the United States. \n40.  No such alarm was raised, however. After making their 2012 findings, the DOC did \nnot  eliminate  or  even  meaningfully  mitigate  the  problem  of  overdetention.  Secretary  LeBlanc \nrecently testified that he understood that โpeople [are still] being held [in DOC custody] an average \nof about two months past their release date.โ29 \n41.  Indeed, five years after the 2012 investigation, in 2017, another internal investigation \nreported that the DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days past \n \n25 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 20. \n26 Ex. 15, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker at 33. \n27 Id. (โQ. So this approximately 79-day number represents the DOCโs, to the best of its \nknowledge in 2012, about how long it was taking for documents to wait at the DOC to be \ncalculated? A. Correct.โ). \n28 County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n29 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45. \n10 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 11 of 25\n \nthe end of their sentence.โ30  So many people were being overdetained under this practice that it \ncost the state โ$2.8M per year in housing costs alone.โ31 According to the DOC, this is โtaxpayer \nmoneyโ that the โDOC should not have to spendโ on people whose sentences are complete.32 \n42.  But the 2017 investigation did not fix things either. As recently as 2019, the DOC \ncompiled a set of data and found that it had held at least 231 individuals past their legal release dates \nin a single month (February of 2019) for an average of 44 extra days.33 This suggests that over 2,000 \npeople per year are still being overdetained, seven years after the DOC first identified the problem. \n43.  The causes of this problem have been obvious since at least the 2012 investigation. \nThat inquiry found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the DOC to receive \ndocuments from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and then, even after receiving the sentencing \npapers, the DOC was taking an average of approximately 79 additional days to complete the process \nof calculating sentences.34 For example, the DOC waits nearly 11 days on average to even begin \ncalculating a personโs time once the paperwork is received from the sheriff or court clerk.35  \n44.  As the DOCโs overdetention practices have continued, judges and state legislators \nhave periodically reminded Secretary LeBlanc of the problem. \n45.  On January 20, 2015, Judge Mary Doggett of the 9th Judicial District Court sent an \nemail that was forwarded to Secretary LeBlanc complaining that an individual had been held past his \n \n30 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38 (โQ. So itโs a true statement \nthat the DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 \ndays past the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ). \n31 Ex. 2, DOC Grant Application at 4. \n32 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 35. \n33 See Ex. 16, Feb. Pull Doc.; see also Ex. X, Grant v.

Pull Doc. The โRECEIV TO COMPโ column provides, for each individual listed, the \nnumber of days that passed between the DOC receiving the personโs paperwork and the DOC \nbeginning the process of calculating the personโs time. \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 12 of 25\n \nrelease date by nearly two months โin spite of several phone calls from Judge Randow for his \nrelease.โ36 \n46.  On January 28, 2016, a state legislatorโs office emailed Secretary LeBlanc regarding \nan individual who had obtained โan order of immediate releaseโ more than two weeks prior, and \nwas โstill being detained and has been given no explanation of the delay.โ37 \n47.  On February 21, 2019, Secretary LeBlanc received an email from Judge Jules D. \nEdwards of the 15th Judicial District Court to which Judge Edwards had attached three articles \nabout overdetention in Louisiana and information about a specific overdetained person. Judge \nEdwards added that โdefense attorneys in Lafayette are also complaining about the failure to timely \nrelease inmates from LPCC.โ Secretary LeBlancโs response indicated that he had read at least one of \nthe articles.38 \nB.  Secretary  LeBlanc  Has  Been  Deliberately  Indifferent  to  the  DOCโs \nOverdetention of Thousands of Louisianans \n48.  Multiple investigations since 2012, and repeated attempts to intervene by other \nbranches of Louisiana government, have done little to change the DOCโs pattern of overdetention. \nThe DOC has been content to tinker around the edges of the problem, while doing little to actually \nreduce or eliminate the mass false incarceration it is committing. \n49.  Upon learning of the scale of its overdetention problem in 2012, the DOC did not \nset a goal of eliminating the problem. Rather, it set a goal to โ[r]educe the percentage of Immediate \n \n36 Ex. 17, Secretary LeBlanc Emails 3-4 (Email from Mary Lauve Doggett, District Judge, 9th \nJDC, to Cole Gralapp, District Administrator, Probation and Parole (Jan. 20, 2015, 4:48 PM) \n(forwarded to James LeBlanc Jan. 23, 2015, 1:54 PM)). \n37 Id. at 10 (Email from the office of Chris Hazel, State Representative, House District No. 27, to \nJames LeBlanc, Secretary, DOC (Jan. 28, 2016, 9:44 AM)). \n38 Id. at 1-2 (Email from Jules D.

After learning that the DOC was still detaining people an average of about two \nmonths past their legal release dates even with the intervention resulting from the 2012 review in \nplace, Secretary LeBlanc did not fire anyone. He did not demote anyone. He did not dock anyoneโs \npay. He did not even reprimand anyone.40 He did not take any supervisory action to prevent his \nagency from continuing to detain people past their legal release dates. \n51.  Since that time, Secretary LeBlanc has not consulted with the heads of other statesโ \ndepartments of corrections about how they ensure that people are not detained past their legal \nrelease dates, aside from looking at some of the software that other states use.41 \n52.  Secretary LeBlanc has suggested that overdetention might be somewhat lessened in \nLouisiana if the DOC were to go and pick up the paperwork necessary to process release dates \nrather than waiting for sheriffs and clerks to deliver it,42 but the DOC has never implemented that \nstrategy under Secretary LeBlancโs leadership. Likewise the DOCโs central office waits days to \nreceive parole or probation revocation paperwork from its own parole board in order to begin \ncalculating parole or probation revocation release times. \n53.  Secretary LeBlanc has failed to adopt a policy proposed by a legislative auditor that \nwould impose a deadline on sheriffs to submit pre-classification packets to the DOC, despite his \n \n39 Ex. 13, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 5. The DOC estimated that if it could \nachieve these goals of reducing the percentage of overdetained people by 80% and reducing the \naverage number of days of overdetention per person to 31 days, it could save the state $3.7 million \nper year.

Secretary LeBlanc has not adopted any policy for the DOC requiring the immediate \ncalculation of sentences or parole revocation release dates; instead, he has allowed these dates to be \ncalculated in an ad hoc manner after the DOC central office receives the relevant paperwork. \n55.  Further,  the  DOC  has  declined  help  when  offered.  For  example,  in  2019,  the \nexecutive director of the Louisiana Clerks of Court Association, Debbie Hudnall, had a series of \nmeetings with the DOC and Secretary LeBlanc. Ms. Hudnall suggested that, to speed things up, the \nClerks of Court could begin emailing sentencing documents to the DOC. The DOC declined, \nclaiming that they โdonโt have the capability of receiving that.โ44 \n56.  Aside from the specific investigations in 2012, 2017, and 2019, the DOC does not \neven keep a record or count of individuals who have been overdetained.45 \n57.  Shockingly, the DOC has tried to frame overdetention as a component of a personโs \nsentence, stating that a personโs โsentence continuesโ past the legal release date ordered by a judge \nโuntil [the DOC does the personโs] time comp[utation] and release[s] him.โ46  \n58.  Indeed, the DOC has endorsed overdetention as a matter of policy.  \n \n43 See Crittindon v. Gusman, No. 3:17-cv-00512-SDD-EWD at 26 (M.D. La., Apr. 13, 2020) (order \ndenying motions for summary judgment) (โ[B]oth Secretary LeBlanc and Defendant Stagg testified \nin their depositions that they were familiar with a proposal by the legislative auditor that such a \ndeadline be implemented, and both men expressed approval for the idea. In fact, when Secretary \nLeBlanc was asked at his deposition if it has โever been considered to include a timeframe for the \nsubmission of these materials to DOC,โ he responded: โNot that Iโm aware of, but thereโs no \nreason why we couldnโt. I mean, Iโm not sure why we donโt, to be honest with you.โ Secretary \nLeBlanc added: โIโm not sure that we could enforce it to begin with, but we could certainly, at least, \nmake an attempt.โโ) (emphasis in original). \n44 Testimony of Debbie Hudnall, Louisiana House of Representatives, Judiciary Committee, Jan. \n15, 2020, at 1:03:35, Available at \nhttp://house.louisiana.gov/H_Video/VideoArchivePlayer.aspx?v=house/2019/dec/1212_19_J\nU. \n45 See Ex. 11, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 29. \n46 Ex. 10, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (Jan. 10, 2020) at 36-39. \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 15 of 25\n \n59.  For example, at least as late as May 2019, the DOC websiteโs โFrequently Asked \nQuestionsโ page stated, โIf a person has recently been sentenced to DOC custody, it can take up to \n12 weeks to calculate a date as the Department has to receive official paperwork from the sentencing \ncourt in order to calculate the offenderโs release date.โ The DOC has since removed the reference to \ntaking โup to 12 weeks to calculate a date,โ a timeframe even Secretary LeBlanc conceded was \nโridiculousโ and โabsurd.โ47 \n60.  The DOC also included an audio statement in its voicemail recording saying that it \nโtakes at least 90 days after sentencingโ for the department to calculate a personโs time. This \nstatement was finally removed from the voicemail recording in or around February or March of \n2019.48   \n61.  These voicemail and website statements reveal the scope of the DOCโs misconduct; \ntheir purpose was to discourage family members from โinundat[ing]โ the DOC with questions about \nwhen their loved onesโwho had been told by a judge that they were free to rejoin their familiesโ\nwould actually be released.49 \n62.  Named Plaintiffs are among the thousands of people who have been wrongfully \nimprisoned as a result of Secretary LeBlancโs demonstrated indifference to the DOCโs unlawful \nconduct. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n63.  Named Plaintiffs bring this action, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly \nsituated, to assert the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common basis. \n64.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because the questions of law or fact common \n \n47 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 88-90. \n48 See Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 12-13. \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 16 of 25\n \nto proposed class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and \na class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this \ncontroversy. \nI.  The Plaintiff Class \n65.  Named Plaintiffs propose a class defined as: all persons who have been remanded to \nthe custody of the DOC since April 16, 2019, and who were entitled to release at the time of their \nremand (either pursuant to sentencing or parole or probation revocation), but who were released by \nthe DOC more than 48 hours past the time that they were remanded to the DOCโs custody. The \nClass seeks to recover damages for the injuries caused to each class member by this overdetention \nand false imprisonment. \nII.  Rule 23(a) \n66.  The proposed class satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a). \nA.  Numerosity โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n67.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The most \nrecent overdetention data from the DOC (from February of 2019) shows that over 200 individuals \nwere overdetained in a single month, suggesting that the DOC overdetains over 2,000 individuals \nover the course of a year. This 2019 count was consistent with data from 2017, which showed that \nthe DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held . . . past the end of their sentence.โ50 \nUpon information and belief, the DOC has not implemented any major changes that might have \n \n49  See  Ex.  1,  Dep.  of  Secretary  LeBlanc  at  89;  see  also  Ex.  14,  Dep.  of  DOC  30(b)(6) \nRepresentative Derek Ellis at 18. \n50 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38 (โQ. So itโs a true statement \nthat the DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 \ndays past the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ). \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 17 of 25\n \nsignificantly mitigated the rate of overdetention that was captured in the February 2019 snapshot. \nPlaintiffs therefore estimate a class size of over 2,000 members. \nB.  Commonality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n68.  All members of the proposed Class are subject to the same systemic unconstitutional \npolicies, acts, and omissions on the part of Defendant described in this Complaint, and all have \nsuffered or will suffer violations of their constitutional rights and their rights under state law as a \nresult of the DOCโs pattern and practice of overdetaining people in its custody. \n69.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the class. \n70.  Questions of law that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \nโข  Whether the DOC had, or has, the legal authority to hold class members past their \nsentencing or parole or probation revocation dates under the United States \nConstitution; \nโข  Whether Class Members had, or have, a liberty interest in their immediate release \nupon sentencing or parole or probation revocation under the United States \nConstitution; \nโข  Whether Defendantโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention \nconstitutes deliberate indifference; \nโข  Whether the DOC had, or has, the legal authority to hold class members past their \nsentencing or parole or probation revocation dates under the Louisiana Constitution; \nโข  Whether Class Members had, or have, a liberty interest in their immediate release \nupon sentencing or parole or probation revocation under the Louisiana Constitution; \nand \nโข  Whether the DOCโs detention of Class Members past their legal release dates \nconstitutes false imprisonment under state law.  \n \n71.  Questions of fact that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \nโข  Whether the DOC has a pattern of overdetaining people in its custody; \nโข  Whether Defendant is aware of the DOCโs pattern of overdetaining people;  \nโข  Whether the DOC is responsible for people sentenced to DOC custody from the \nday they are sentenced; and \nโข  Whether Defendant failed to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention. \n \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 18 of 25\n \n72.  Defendant is expected to raise common defenses to these claims, including denying \nthat his actions violate the law. \nC.  Typicality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n73.  Named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of those of the Class, as their claims arise from \nthe same policies, practices, or courses of conduct as those of the Class, and their claims are based \non the same theories of law as the Classโs claims. Named Plaintiffs were eligible for immediate \nrelease upon their sentencing or parole or probation revocation, and the DOC held them in custody \npast that date. Named Representatives are therefore typical of the putative Class, and they suffered \nthe same injury of overdetention described in this Complaint.  \nD.  Adequacy โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n74.  Named Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the Class because their interests in \nthe vindication of the legal claims that they raise are entirely aligned with the interests of the other \nClass Members, who each have the same basic constitutional claims. Named Plaintiffs are members \nof the Class, and their interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the other Class \nMembers. \n75.  There are no known conflicts of interest among Class Members, all of whom have a \nsimilar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights. \n76.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Promise of Justice Initiative, Loevy \nand Loevy, and Most & Associates, who have experience in litigating complex civil rights matters \nrelated to prisonersโ rights in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the details of the DOC \nand the relevant constitutional and statutory law. Most & Associates has litigated a number of \nindividual overdetention cases in Louisiana. \n77.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of local law and practices as they relate \nto federal constitutional requirements. \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 19 of 25\n \nIII.  Rule 23(b)(3) \n78.  Class action status is appropriate because the questions of law or fact common to \nClass Members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class \naction is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this controversy. \n79.  The question of Defendantโs longstanding indifference to policies that result in mass \noverdetention, and the mass overdetention that results from this indifference, predominates over \nany individualized issues related to the claims of individual Class Members. The issue of Defendantโs \nliability is common across the Class and will predominate over any unique or personal issues. \n80.  A class action is the superior form of adjudication of the claims alleged in this \nComplaint because most of the proposed Class Membersโ claims are negative value suits; for many \nMembers of the putative Class, the damages at stake are too slight to repay the cost of an individual \nsuit. Class Membersโ interests in individually controlling separate actions against Defendant for their \noverdetention is therefore low. Moreover, no unusual difficulties are likely to be encountered in the \nmanagement of this class action. \n81.  Even  if  Class  Members  could  afford  to  litigate  their  claims  individually, \nindividualized litigation creates a potential for inconsistent or contradictory judgments and increases \ndelay and expense to all parties and to the courts. By contrast, the class action device presents far \nfewer management difficulties and provides the benefits of a single adjudication, economy of scale, \nand comprehensive supervision by a single court. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n82.  Named Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in \nthis Count. \n19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 20 of 25\n \n83.  Named Plaintiffs bring this claim on their own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendant. \n84.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution is violated where a person remains incarcerated after the legal authority to hold that \nperson has expired.51 No privilege enables a jailor to detain a person beyond the period of that \npersonโs lawful sentence.52 \n85.  The DOCโs legal authority to detain Named Plaintiffs expired on the day they were \nsentenced or had their parole or probation revoked. Yet pursuant to an unlawful, standard practice \nthat has existed for years, the DOC nevertheless continued detaining Named Plaintiffs for well over \n48 hours before attempting to determine whether it had any legal authority to imprison them. \n86.  The DOC falsely imprisoned Named Plaintiffs pursuant to a practice that has existed \nfor years in which it waits weeks and even months to determine whether it has lawful authority to \nimprison persons who in fact were entitled to release on the day of their sentences or parole or \nprobation revocations. That practice injured the thousands of members of the putative class, as \ndescribed in this Complaint. \n87.  Defendant LeBlanc has been aware of this practice since at least 2012, but he has not \nattempted to stop it; instead the agency Defendant oversees has attempted to normalize its own \nmisconduct.  \n88.  Secretary LeBlancโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to prevent overdetention is \nโdeliberately indifferentโ because โit is obvious that the likely consequences of not adopting a policy \nwill be a deprivation of constitutional rights.โ53 \n \n51 See Douthit v. Jones, 619 F.2d 527, 532 (5th Cir. 1980). \n52 See Whirl v. Kern, 407 F.2d 781, 791 (5th Cir. 1968); see also Powell v. Barrett, 376 F. Supp. 2d \n1340, 1351 (N.D. Ga. 2005) (detainee has constitutional right to be free from continued detention \nafter it was or should have been known that he was entitled to release). \n53 Rhyne v. Henderson Cnty., 973 F.2d 386, 392 (5th Cir. 1992). \n20 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 21 of 25\n \n89.  In failing to adopt any policy to prevent predictable overdetention, Secretary LeBlanc \nacted with deliberate indifference. This is evidenced by the fact that every investigation into the \nmatter  since  2012  has  shown  that  overdetention  is  a  persistent  and  widespread  problem  in \nLouisiana, yet Secretary LeBlanc did not create any policy to attempt to remedy the problem. \n90.  Through his deliberate indifference, Secretary LeBlanc deprived Named Plaintiffs, \nand all Members of the putative Class they seek to represent, of the fundamental right to liberty and \nviolated their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, causing the injuries described in \nthis Complaint. \nCOUNT II \nDue Process under Article I, Section 2 of the Louisiana Constitution \n91.  Named Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in \nthis Count. \n92.  Named Plaintiffs bring this claim on their own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendant. \n93.  Article One, Section Two of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 guarantees that \nโ[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law.โ  \n94.  By reason of the same conduct that violated Named Plaintiffsโ federal constitutional \nrights, Defendant violated Named Plaintiffsโ state constitutional rights to liberty and due process, as \nwell as the state constitutional rights of the putative class he seeks to represent, causing the injuries \ndescribed in this Complaint. \nCOUNT III \nFalse Imprisonment under State Law \n95.  Named Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in \nthis Count. \n21 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 22 of 25\n \n96.  Named Plaintiffs bring this claim on their own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendant. \n97.  Defendant committed the tort of false imprisonment against Named Plaintiffs when \nthe DOC โrestrain[ed] [Named Plaintiffs] against [their] will without a warrant or other statutory \nauthorityโ54 for multiple days beyond Named Plaintiffsโ legal release dates. By definition, the Class \nMembers Named Plaintiffs seek to represent were also falsely imprisoned by Defendant when they \nwere unlawfully detained beyond their legal release dates, causing the injuries described in this \nComplaint. \nCOUNT IV \nState Law Negligence \n98.  Named Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in \nthis Count. \n99.  Named Plaintiffs bring this claim on their own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendant. \n100.  Defendant owes duties to avoid overdetention to persons in DOC custody, including \nNamed Plaintiffs and the members of the putative Class.55 \n101.  These duties were breached by Defendantโs acts and omissions, including the failure \nto timely release Named Plaintiffs and the putative Class Members. \n102.  The risks and harms that Defendant caused were within the scope of protection \nafforded by the duties he owed to Named Plaintiffs and to the putative Class Members. \n103.  As a result of Defendantโs acts and omissions, Named Plaintiffs and the putative \nClass Members suffered actual, foreseeable harm, as described in this Complaint. \n \n54 Kyle v.

Defendant  Leblanc  has  acted  intentionally  or  recklessly  regarding  the  false \nimprisonment and overdetention of Named Plaintiffs and the Members of the putative Class. \n107.  Defendantโs conduct has been extreme and outrageous, and it has been rooted in an \nabuse of power and authority over the freedom of Named Plaintiffs and the Members of the \nputative Class. \n108.  Defendantโs misconduct has caused severe emotional distress, induced by weeks and \neven months of caging in crowded, dangerous jails and prisons of persons who were legally entitled \nto be free.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Named Plaintiffs request that this Court enter judgment in their favor, and in \nfavor of the putative class they seek to represent, against Defendant James LeBlanc and order the \nfollowing relief: \n(a) An order and judgment awarding compensatory and punitive damages to Named \nPlaintiffs and to the members of the putative class whom Named Plaintiffs seek \nto represent; \n \n(b) An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and  \n \n(c) Any other relief this Court deems proper. \n \n23 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 43    04/29/21   Page 24 of 25\n \nJURY DEMAND \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38, Plaintiffs demand a trial by jury on \nall issues so triable. \n \nRespectfully submitted this 29th day of April, 2021. \n \n/s/ Mercedes Montagnes \nMercedes Montagnes, La.

For years now, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (โthe \nDOCโ) has been unlawfully and knowingly overdetaining thousands of Louisiana residents in its \ncustody  every  year.  Defendant  James  LeBlanc,  Secretary  of  the  DOC,  has  known  about  this \nmisconduct since at least 2012.1 Secretary LeBlanc has admitted that the DOC is โlegally boundโ to \nrelease people on time, and he has admitted that the DOCโs chronic, unlawful overdetention is a \nโbig problem.โ2 Yet Secretary LeBlanc has done little to fix the big problem. \n2.  By overdetaining Louisianans as a matter of policy, the DOC is essentially usurping \nthe sentencing authority that rightfully belongs to the judiciary. Many of these people are sentenced \nby a court to โtime servedโ or an equivalent sentence that legally entitles them to immediate release \nfrom the moment they are sentenced. But they are not immediately released. Instead, as a standard \npractice, the DOC delays computation of release dates and, in the meantime, simply continues to \ndetain people who should be free. Many are forced to sit for weeks or even months with no idea of \n \n1 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45, 48-49.  \n2 Id. at 41. \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 2 of 21\n \nwhen the DOC will get around to processing their paperwork and releasing them. The DOC, in \nother  words,  falsely  imprisons  thousands  of  people  every  year,  degrading  lives  and  creating \nuncertainty and misery for families across the state.  \n3.  Still, Secretary LeBlanc has not implemented any policy to ensure that the DOC \nstops overdetainingโand falsely imprisoningโLouisianans. Overdetention costs the state $2.8M \nper year,3 but Secretary LeBlanc has not attempted to reallocate that spending toward new measures \nto prevent the DOC from holding people past their legal release dates. Meanwhile, the DOC simply \npretends that overdetention is an acceptable part of a personโs sentence. \n4.  Named Plaintiff Brian Humphrey was a victim of the DOCโs misconduct. He seeks \nto represent a Class of all persons who have been sentenced to the custody of the DOC since April \n16, 2019, and who were entitled to release at the time of their sentencing, but who were released by \nthe DOC more than 48 hours past the time that they were sentenced. On behalf of the numerous \npeople subject to this unlawful practice, Mr. Humphrey seeks to have each putative class member \nrecover the damages they suffered from their false and unlawful overdetention.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has original jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a). It has jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยง  1367  because  those  claims  arise  from  the  same  events  and  are  part  of  the  same  case  and \ncontroversy as the federal claims.  \n6.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Defendant resides in \nthis judicial district, and because a substantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffโs claims \noccurred in this judicial district. \n \n3 Ex. 2, DOC Grant Application at 4. \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 3 of 21\n \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey was eligible for immediate release upon his sentencing on \nApril 16, 2019,4 but the DOC did not release him from custody until May 13, 2019,5 the day that the \nDOC finally computed his release date and found him eligible for immediate release.6 The DOC did \nnot compute Mr. Humphreyโs release date or set him free until 17 days after the DOC received his \npaperwork from the Bossier Parish Sheriffโs Office on April 26, 2019, and 27 days after he was \nsentenced on April 16.7 \n8.  Defendant James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the DOC and its final policymaker. He \nhas served in that role since 2008. He is appointed by the Louisiana governor and is the chief \nexecutive officer for the DOC. He formulates rules and regulations for the DOC, and he determines \npolicy regarding management, personnel, and total operations for the agency. He oversees the \nDOCโs central office and its field unit staff, who are charged with carrying out the work of the \nagency and protecting the rights of all persons held in DOC custody. At all relevant times, Secretary \nLeBlanc has acted under color of law. He can be served at 504 Mayflower Street, Baton Rouge, LA \n70802.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Plaintiff was Overdetained for 27 Days after Being Sentenced Only to the Time that \nHe Had Already Served in Jail \n9.  On April 16, 2019, the 26th Judicial District Court in Bossier Parish sentenced Mr. \nHumphrey to โ3 years hard labor in the Louisiana Department of Corrections.โ In issuing that \nsentence, however, the Court simultaneously gave Mr. Humphrey credit for the time he had already \n \n4 Ex. 3, Humphrey Sentencing Minutes at 2. \n5 Ex. 4, Humphrey Certificate of Release. \n6 Ex. 5, Humphrey Release Date Computation Information. \n7 Ex. 6, Facsimile Transmittal Sheet. \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 4 of 21\n \nserved in jail, and ordered further that the sentence should โsuspend all but time served.โ8 In other \nwords, Mr. Humphreyโs sentencing judge gave him credit for the time he had served in jail, and \notherwise suspended his sentence. Thus, as of the date of his sentencing, Mr. Humphrey had served \nhis entire sentence. He should have been released immediately. \n10.  That did not happen. Instead, the Bossier Parish Sheriff took Mr. Humphrey back \ninto the jail. Then, on April 18, 2019, Mr. Humphrey was transported to Webster โ Bayou Dorcheat \nCorrectional Center Transitional Work Program, a DOC facility. There Mr. Humphrey, who by law \nshould have been a free man, waited in prison for weeks, until the DOC got around to reviewing his \npapers and finally released him.  \n11.  From the date of his sentencing on April 16, 2019, Mr. Humphrey was in the \ncustody of the DOC. On information and belief, during the first ten days of Mr. Humphreyโs \ncustody, the DOC made no attempt to determine whether it had any legal right to imprison him. \n12.  Then, on April 26, 2019, the Bossier Sheriffโs Office sent to the DOC paperwork \nthat the Sheriff had received from the Clerk of Court of the 26th Judicial District. This paperwork \ncontained a note that read โ3 years HC DOC all but time served suspended.โ9 Mr. Humphreyโs \nUniform  Sentencing  Commitment  Order  notes  โ0โ  years,  โ0โ  months,  and  โ0โ  days  under \nโAmount of Time in DPS&C custody.โ10 Also on April 26, 2019, the Bossier Sheriffโs Office faxed \n14 pages of โpre-classโ information on Mr. Humphrey to the Bayou Dorcheat Correctional Center,11 \nwhere Mr. Humphrey was being held in DOC custody. \n13.  This paperwork made plain that Mr. Humphrey should have been a free man already, \nand that the DOC had no right to detain him. But the DOC did not release him. Instead, with the \n \n8 Ex. 3, Humphrey Sentencing Minutes at 2. \n9 Ex. 7, Humphrey DOC Basic Information Interview for Local Jail Facilities. \n10 Ex. 8, Humphrey Uniform Sentencing Commitment Order. \n11 Ex. 6, Facsimile Transmittal Sheet. \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 5 of 21\n \npaperwork in hand, the DOC waited more than two weeks to determine  whether it had any \nauthority to imprison Mr. Humphrey at all. \n14.  On May 13, 2019, the DOC completed Mr. Humphreyโs time computation, resulting \nin a calculation of 0 days.12 Mr. Humphreyโs โmust serveโ time was calculated to be -114 days.13 Any \nperson whose โmust serveโ comes to a negative number is eligible for immediate release.14 \n15.  That same day, May 13, 2019, the DOC issued a โCertificate of Releaseโ for Mr. \nHumphrey certifying his โCompletion of Sentence.โ15 \n16.  Mr. Humphrey was released from DOC custody on May 13, 2019, at 5:30 PM, 27 \ndays after he was entitled for immediate release upon his sentencing and 17 days after the DOC \nreceived his paperwork from the Bossier Sheriffโs Office. \nII.  The DOC Has a Pattern and Practice of Overdetaining People in Its Custody \n17.  Mr. Humphreyโs case was not an aberrationโto the contrary, his false imprisonment \nthrough overdetention is the standard practice of the DOC, a standard practice that Defendant \nLeBlanc has known about for at least eight years, yet has failed to change.  \n18.  The DOC has no process in place for ensuring that persons entitled to immediate \nrelease  upon  sentencing  are  actually  released  upon  sentencing,  or  any  time  quickly  thereafter. \nInstead, the DOC detains such people for weeks and even months with no idea whether it has a \nlegal right to imprison them at all. For the DOC, such determinations are made in an unhurried \nprocess in which the agency (1) waits days or weeks for others to provide it with the personโs \nsentencing order, and then (2) waits weeks to actually examine that sentencing order and determine \nwhether the DOC has the legal authority to detain the person. During all that time, the person who \n \n12 Ex. 5, Humphrey Release Date Computation Information. \n13 Ex. 9, Humphrey Time Computation and Jail Credits. \n14 Ex. 10, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (Jan. 10, 2020) at 87. \n15 Ex. 4, Humphrey Certificate of Release. \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 6 of 21\n \nshould  be  freeโwhom  a  judge  has  already  deemed  eligible  for  immediate  releaseโlanguishes \nbehind bars. Thousands of people in Louisiana suffer this fate every year. \n19.  To make matters worse, the leadership of the DOC, including Defendant LeBlanc, \nhave been acutely aware of this problem since at least 2012. And after making half-hearted efforts to \nmitigate the problem, they have shifted instead to justify and normalize the false imprisonment of \nthousands of Louisianans every year. \nA.  The  DOC  Detains  Thousands  of  People  Past  Their  Legal  Release  Dates \nEvery Year  \n20.  The DOC recognizes that a person who (1) has spent time in custody pretrial, (2) is \ngiven a sentence with credit for time served, and (3) has a sentence that is less than or equal to their \nperiod of pretrial custody is entitled to release on the day of their sentencing.16 For example, a \nperson who spent two months in jail awaiting sentencing, and is then sentenced to thirty days with \ncredit for time served, is entitled to release on the day of his sentencing.  \n21.  The DOC is responsible for a personโs overdetention from the day of sentencing, \neven if the person is not yet in a DOC facility. The DOC has conceded that a personโs โadmit dateโ \nto DOC custody is the date of that personโs sentencing.17  Indeed, Secretary LeBlanc has explained \nthat he is โresponsible for the inmates sentenced to the custody of the DOC,โ whether they are in \nโa state-run facility, a parish-run facility, or private-facility.โ18 \n22.  Any person who is detained past his or her legal release date is overdetained. The \nDOC admits that it is โlegally bound to release inmates on their release date.โ19  Secretary LeBlanc \nhas stated that he first learned โthat thousands of people in the custody of the Department of \n \n16 See Ex. 11, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 30-31. \n17 Ex. 12, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Melanie Gueho at 53. \n18 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 13. \n19 Id. at 15. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 7 of 21\n \nCorrections for whatever reason were being held past their release dateโ in 2012.20 But every \ninvestigation into the matter since that time has confirmed that the problem continues; indeed it has \neven come to the attention of judges and legislators. \n23.  In 2012, a team of DOC staff performed a review of its time calculation processes, \nwhich revealed a widespread pattern of people being held past their legal release dates. Specifically, \nthe investigation found that when the DOC calculated the release dates of inmates, 83% were \neligible for โimmediate release . . . due to an earlier release date.โ21 The DOC learned through this \ninvestigation that it was overdetaining over 2,000 people each year, with an average of 71.69 \nโoverdue daysโ per person who was overdetained.22 The DOC has admitted that this is โa lot of \noverdetention.โ23 \n24.  The 2012 review found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the \nDOC to receive documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and the remainder was caused by \nthe DOC itself taking an average of approximately 79 days to calculate sentences after it had the \nsentencing documents in hand.24 \n25.  These 2012 findings should have set off alarm bells. Under Louisiana law, confining \nany person without legal authority amounts to false imprisonment. Under settled decisions by the \nUnited States Supreme Court, meanwhile, correctional facilities are allowed some time to ensure that \nan imprisoned personโs release is administratively proper, but in all events, it is presumptively \nunreasonable to imprison a person for more than 48 hours after they are entitled to release.25 The \n \n20 Id. at 48. \n21 Ex. 13, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 4. \n22 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 20. \n23 Ex. 15, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker at 33. \n24 Id.

McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 8 of 21\n \nDOCโs imprisonment of people for months after they are entitled to release flagrantly violates the \nlaws of Louisiana and the United States. \n26.  No such alarm was raised, however. After making their 2012 findings, the DOC did \nnot  eliminate  or  even  meaningfully  mitigate  the  problem  of  overdetention.  Secretary  LeBlanc \nrecently testified that he understood that โpeople [are still] being held [in DOC custody] an average \nof about two months past their release date.โ26 \n27.  Indeed, five years after the 2012 investigation, in 2017, another internal investigation \nreported that the DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days past \nthe end of their sentence.โ27  So many people were being overdetained under this practice that it cost \nthe state โ$2.8M per year in housing costs alone.โ28 According to the DOC, this is โtaxpayer moneyโ \nthat the โDOC should not have to spendโ on people whose sentences are complete.29 \n28.  But the 2017 investigation did not fix things either. As recently as 2019, the DOC \ncompiled a set of data and found that it had held 231 individuals past their legal release dates in a \nsingle month (February of 2019) for an average of 44 extra days.30 This suggests that over 2,000 \npeople per year are still being overdetained, seven years after the DOC first identified the problem. \n29.  The causes of this problem have been obvious since at least the 2012 investigation. \nThat inquiry found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the DOC to receive \ndocuments from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and then, even after receiving the sentencing \npapers, the DOC was taking an average of approximately 79 additional days to complete the process \n \n26 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45. \n27 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38 (โQ. So itโs a true statement that \nthe DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days \npast the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ). \n28 Ex. 2, DOC Grant Application at 4. \n29 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 35. \n30 See Ex. 16, Feb. Pull Doc.; see also Ex. X, Grant v.

As the DOCโs overdetention practices have continued, judges and state legislators \nhave periodically reminded Secretary LeBlanc of the problem. \n31.  On January 20, 2015, Judge Mary Doggett of the 9th Judicial District Court sent an \nemail that was forwarded to Secretary LeBlanc complaining that an individual had been held past his \nrelease date by nearly two months โin spite of several phone calls from Judge Randow for his \nrelease.โ33 \n32.  On January 28, 2016, a state legislatorโs office emailed Secretary LeBlanc regarding \nan individual who had obtained โan order of immediate releaseโ more than two weeks prior, and \nwas โstill being detained and has been given no explanation of the delay.โ34 \n33.  On February 21, 2019, Secretary LeBlanc received an email from Judge Jules D. \nEdwards of the 15th Judicial District Court to which Judge Edwards had attached three articles \nabout overdetention in Louisiana and information about a specific overdetained person. Judge \nEdwards added that โdefense attorneys in Lafayette are also complaining about the failure to timely \nrelease inmates from LPCC.โ Secretary LeBlancโs response indicated that he had read at least one of \nthe articles.35 \n \n31 Ex. 15, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker at 33. \n32 This number was obtained by calculating the average of the column โRECEIV TO COMPโ in Ex. \n16, Feb. Pull Doc. The โRECEIV TO COMPโ column provides, for each individual listed, the \nnumber of days that passed between the DOC receiving the personโs paperwork and the DOC \nbeginning the process of calculating the personโs time. \n33 Ex. 17, Secretary LeBlanc Emails 3-4 (Email from Mary Lauve Doggett, District Judge, 9th JDC, \nto Cole Gralapp, District Administrator, Probation and Parole (Jan. 20, 2015, 4:48 PM) (forwarded \nto James LeBlanc Jan. 23, 2015, 1:54 PM)). \n34 Id. at 10 (Email from the office of Chris Hazel, State Representative, House District No. 27, to \nJames LeBlanc, Secretary, DOC (Jan. 28, 2016, 9:44 AM)). \n35 Id. at 1-2 (Email from Jules D.

Secretary  LeBlanc  Has  Been  Deliberately  Indifferent  to  the  DOCโs \nOverdetention of Thousands of Louisianans \n34.  Multiple  investigations  since  2012,  and  repeated  attempts  to  intervene  by  other \nbranches of Louisiana government, have done little to change the DOCโs pattern of overdetention. \nThe DOC has been content to tinker around the edges of the problem, while doing little to actually \nreduce or eliminate the mass false incarceration it is committing. \n35.  Upon learning of the scale of its overdetention problem in 2012, the DOC did not \nset a goal of eliminating the problem. Rather, it set a goal to โ[r]educe the percentage of Immediate \nReleases by 80% (from 2252 to 450/yr)โ and to โ[r]educe the average number of days per case for \nimmediate releases from 71.69 days (non CTRP) to 31 days.โ36 \n36.  After learning that the DOC was still detaining people an average of about two \nmonths past their legal release dates even with the intervention resulting from the 2012 review in \nplace, Secretary LeBlanc did not fire anyone. He did not demote anyone. He did not dock anyoneโs \npay. He did not even reprimand anyone.37 He did not take any supervisory action to prevent his \nagency from continuing to detain people past their legal release dates. \n37.  Since that time, Secretary LeBlanc has not consulted with the heads of other statesโ \ndepartments of corrections about how they ensure that people are not detained past their legal \nrelease dates, aside from looking at some of the software that other states use.38 \n38.  Secretary LeBlanc has suggested that overdetention might be somewhat lessened in \nLouisiana if the DOC were to go and pick up the paperwork necessary to process release dates \n \n36 Ex. 13, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 5. The DOC estimated that if it could \nachieve these goals of reducing the percentage of overdetained people by 80% and reducing the \naverage number of days of overdetention per person to 31 days, it could save the state $3.7 million \nper year.

Secretary LeBlanc has failed to adopt a policy proposed by a legislative auditor that \nwould impose a deadline on sheriffs to submit pre-classification packets to the DOC, despite his \nown admission that โthereโs no reason why [the DOC] couldnโtโ adopt such a policy and that he is \nโnot sure why we donโt, to be honest,โ and โwe could certainly, at least, make an attempt.โ40 \n40.  Secretary LeBlanc has not adopted any policy for the DOC requiring the immediate \ncalculation of sentences; instead, he has allowed sentences to be calculated in an ad hoc manner after \nthe DOC receives the relevant paperwork. \n41.  Further, the DOC has declined help when offered. In 2019, the executive director of \nthe Louisiana Clerks of Court Association, Debbie Hudnall, had a series of meetings with the DOC \nand Secretary LeBlanc. Ms. Hudnall suggested that, to speed things up, the Clerks of Court could \nbegin emailing sentencing documents to the DOC. The DOC declined, claiming that they โdonโt \nhave the capability of receiving that.โ41 \n42.  Aside from the specific investigations in 2012, 2017, and 2019, the DOC does not \neven keep a record or count of individuals who have been overdetained.42 \n \n39 Id. at 80, 100-01. \n40 See Crittindon v. Gusman, No. 3:17-cv-00512-SDD-EWD at 26 (M.D. La., Apr. 13, 2020) (order \ndenying motions for summary judgment) (โ[B]oth Secretary LeBlanc and Defendant Stagg testified \nin their depositions that they were familiar with a proposal by the legislative auditor that such a \ndeadline be implemented, and both men expressed approval for the idea. In fact, when Secretary \nLeBlanc was asked at his deposition if it has โever been considered to include a timeframe for the \nsubmission of these materials to DOC,โ he responded: โNot that Iโm aware of, but thereโs no \nreason why we couldnโt. I mean, Iโm not sure why we donโt, to be honest with you.โ Secretary \nLeBlanc added: โIโm not sure that we could enforce it to begin with, but we could certainly, at least, \nmake an attempt.โโ) (emphasis in original). \n41 Testimony of Debbie Hudnall, Louisiana House of Representatives, Judiciary Committee, Jan. 15, \n2020, at 1:03:35, Available online at  \nhttp://house.louisiana.gov/H_Video/VideoArchivePlayer.aspx?v=house/2019/dec/1212_19_JU. \n42 See Ex. 11, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 29. \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 12 of 21\n \n43.  Shockingly, the DOC has tried to frame overdetention as a component of a personโs \nsentence, stating that a personโs โsentence continuesโ past the legal release date ordered by a judge \nโuntil [the DOC does the personโs] time comp[utation] and release[s] him.โ43  \n44.  Indeed, the DOC has endorsed overdetention as a matter of policy.  \n45.  At least as late as May 2019, the DOC websiteโs โFrequently Asked Questionsโ page \nstated, โIf a person has recently been sentenced to DOC custody, it can take up to 12 weeks to \ncalculate a date as the Department has to receive official paperwork from the sentencing court in \norder to calculate the offenderโs release date.โ The DOC has since removed the reference to taking \nโup to 12 weeks to calculate a date,โ a timeframe even Secretary LeBlanc conceded was โridiculousโ \nand โabsurd.โ44 \n46.  The DOC also included an audio statement in its voicemail recording saying that it \nโtakes at least 90 days after sentencingโ for the department to calculate a personโs time. This \nstatement was finally removed from the voicemail recording in or around February or March of \n2019.45   \n47.  These voicemail and website statements reveal the scope of the DOCโs misconduct; \ntheir purpose was to discourage family members from โinundat[ing]โ the DOC with questions about \nwhen their loved onesโwho had been told by a judge that they were free to rejoin their familiesโ\nwould actually be released.46 \n48.  Mr. Humphrey is one of thousands of people who have been wrongfully imprisoned \nas a result of Secretary LeBlancโs demonstrated indifference to the DOCโs unlawful conduct. \n \n43 Ex. 10, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (Jan. 10, 2020) at 36-39. \n44 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 88-90. \n45 See Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 12-13. \n46 See Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 89; see also Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative \nDerek Ellis at 18. \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 13 of 21\n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n49.  Named Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this action, on behalf of himself and all \nothers similarly situated, to assert the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common basis. \n50.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because the questions of law or fact common \nto proposed class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and \na class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this \ncontroversy. \nI.  The Plaintiff Class \n51.  Named Plaintiff proposes a class defined as: all persons who have been sentenced to \nthe custody of the DOC since April 16, 2019, and who were entitled to release at the time of their \nsentencing, but who were released by the DOC more than 48 hours past the time that they were \nsentenced. The Class seeks to recover damages for the injuries caused to each class member by this \noverdetention and false imprisonment. \nII.  Rule 23(a) \n52.  The proposed class satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a). \nA.  Numerosity โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n53.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The most \nrecent overdetention data from the DOC (from February of 2019) shows that over 200 individuals \nwere overdetained in a single month, suggesting that the DOC overdetains over 2,000 individuals \nover the course of a year. This 2019 count was consistent with data from 2017, which showed that \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 14 of 21\n \nthe DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held . . . past the end of their sentence.โ47 \nUpon information and belief, the DOC has not implemented any major changes that might have \nsignificantly mitigated the rate of overdetention that was captured in the February 2019 snapshot. \nPlaintiff therefore estimates a class size of over 2,000 members. \nB.  Commonality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n54.  All members of the proposed Class are subject to the same systemic unconstitutional \npolicies, acts, and omissions on the part of Defendant described in this Complaint, and all have \nsuffered or will suffer violations of their constitutional rights and their rights under state law as a \nresult of the DOCโs pattern and practice of overdetaining people in its custody. \n55.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the class. \n56.  Questions of law that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \nโข  Whether the DOC had, or has, the legal authority to hold class members past their \nsentencing dates under the United States Constitution; \nโข  Whether Class Members had, or have, a liberty interest in their immediate release \nupon sentencing under the United States Constitution; \nโข  Whether Defendantโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention \nconstitutes deliberate indifference; \nโข  Whether the DOC had, or has, the legal authority to hold class members past their \nsentencing dates under the Louisiana Constitution; \nโข  Whether Class Members had, or have, a liberty interest in their immediate release \nupon sentencing under the Louisiana Constitution; and \nโข  Whether  the  DOCโs  detention  of  Class  Members  past  their  legal  release  dates \nconstitutes false imprisonment under state law. \n \n57.  Questions of fact that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \nโข  Whether the DOC has a pattern of overdetaining people in its custody; \nโข  Whether Defendant is aware of the DOCโs pattern of overdetaining people;  \n \n47 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38 (โQ. So itโs a true statement that \nthe DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days \npast the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ). \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 15 of 21\n \nโข  Whether the DOC is responsible for people sentenced to DOC custody from the \nday they are sentenced; and \nโข  Whether Defendant failed to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention. \n \n58.  Defendant is expected to raise common defenses to these claims, including denying \nthat his actions violate the law. \nC.  Typicality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n59.  Named Plaintiffโs claims are typical of those of the Class, as his claims arise from the \nsame policies, practices, or courses of conduct as those of the Class, and his claims are based on the \nsame  theories  of  law  as  the  Classโs  claims.  Named  Plaintiff  Brian  Humphrey  was  eligible for \nimmediate release upon his sentencing, and the DOC held him in custody past his sentencing date. \nMr.  Humphrey  is  therefore  typical  of  the  putative  Class,  and  he  suffered  the  same  injury  of \noverdetention described in this Complaint.  \nD.  Adequacy โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n60.  Named Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the Class because his interests in the \nvindication of the legal claims that he raises are entirely aligned with the interests of the other Class \nMembers, who each have the same basic constitutional claims. Named Plaintiff is a member of the \nClass, and his interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the other Class Members. \n61.  There are no known conflicts of interest among Class Members, all of whom have a \nsimilar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights. \n62.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Promise of Justice Initiative, Loevy \nand Loevy, and the Law Office of William Most, who have experience in litigating complex civil \nrights matters related to prisonersโ rights in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the \ndetails of the DOC and the relevant constitutional and statutory law. The Law Office of William \nMost has litigated a number of individual overdetention cases in Louisiana. \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 16 of 21\n \n63.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of local law and practices as they relate \nto federal constitutional requirements. \nIII.  Rule 23(b)(3) \n64.  Class action status is appropriate because the questions of law or fact common to \nClass Members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class \naction is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this controversy. \n65.  The question of Defendantโs longstanding indifference to policies that result in mass \noverdetention, and the mass overdetention that results from this indifference, predominates over \nany individualized issues related to the claims of individual Class Members. The issue of Defendantโs \nliability is common across the Class and will predominate over any unique or personal issues. \n66.  A class action is the superior form of adjudication of the claims alleged in this \nComplaint because most of the proposed Class Membersโ claims are negative value suits; for many \nMembers of the putative Class, the damages at stake are too slight to repay the cost of an individual \nsuit. Class Membersโ interests in individually controlling separate actions against Defendant for their \noverdetention is therefore low. Moreover, no unusual difficulties are likely to be encountered in the \nmanagement of this class action. \n67.  Even  if  Class  Members  could  afford  to  litigate  their  claims  individually, \nindividualized litigation creates a potential for inconsistent or contradictory judgments and increases \ndelay and expense to all parties and to the courts. By contrast, the class action device presents far \nfewer management difficulties and provides the benefits of a single adjudication, economy of scale, \nand comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 17 of 21\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n68.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n69.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n70.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution is violated where a person remains incarcerated after the legal authority to hold that \nperson has expired.48 No privilege enables a jailor to detain a person beyond the period of that \npersonโs lawful sentence.49 \n71.  The DOCโs legal authority to detain Plaintiff Brian Humphrey expired on the day of \nhis sentencing, April 16, 2019. Yet pursuant to an unlawful, standard practice that has existed for \nyears, the DOC nevertheless continued detaining Plaintiff for nearly a month before attempting to \ndetermine whether it had any legal authority to imprison him. \n72.  The DOC falsely imprisoned Plaintiff pursuant to a practice that has existed for \nyears in which it waits weeks and even months to determine whether it has lawful authority to \nimprison persons who in fact were entitled to release on the day of their sentences. That practice \ninjured the thousands of members of the putative class, as described in this Complaint. \n73.  Defendant LeBlanc has been aware of this practice since at least 2012, but he has not \nattempted to stop it; instead the agency Defendant oversees has attempted to normalize its own \nmisconduct.  \n \n48 See Douthit v. Jones, 619 F.2d 527, 532 (5th Cir. 1980). \n49 See Whirl v. Kern, 407 F.2d 781, 791 (5th Cir. 1968); see also Powell v. Barrett, 376 F. Supp. 2d 1340, \n1351 (N.D. Ga. 2005) (detainee has constitutional right to be free from continued detention after it \nwas or should have been known that he was entitled to release). \n17 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 18 of 21\n \n74.  Secretary LeBlancโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to prevent overdetention is \nโdeliberately indifferentโ because โit is obvious that the likely consequences of not adopting a policy \nwill be a deprivation of constitutional rights.โ50 \n75.  In failing to adopt any policy to prevent predictable overdetention, Secretary LeBlanc \nacted with deliberate indifference. This is evidenced by the fact that every investigation into the \nmatter  since  2012  has  shown  that  overdetention  is  a  persistent  and  widespread  problem  in \nLouisiana, yet Secretary LeBlanc did not create any policy to attempt to remedy the problem. \n76.  Through his deliberate indifference, Secretary LeBlanc deprived Mr. Humphrey, and \nall Members of the putative Class he seeks to represent, of the fundamental right to liberty and \nviolated their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, causing the injuries described in \nthis Complaint. \nCOUNT II \nDue Process under Article I, Section 2 of the Louisiana Constitution \n77.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n78.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n79.  Article One, Section Two of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 guarantees that \nโ[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law.โ  \n80.  By reason of the same conduct that violated Plaintiffโs federal constitutional rights, \nDefendant violated Plaintiffโs state constitutional rights to liberty and due process, as well as the \nstate constitutional rights of the putative class he seeks to represent, causing the injuries described in \nthis Complaint. \n \n50 Rhyne v. Henderson Cnty., 973 F.2d 386, 392 (5th Cir. 1992). \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    04/15/20   Page 19 of 21\n \nCOUNT III \nFalse Imprisonment under State Law \n81.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n82.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n83.  Defendant committed the tort of false imprisonment against Plaintiff when the \nDOC โrestrain[ed] [Plaintiff] against his will without a warrant or other statutory authorityโ51 for 27 \ndays  beyond  Plaintiffโs  legal  release  date.  By  definition,  the  Class  Members  Plaintiff  seeks  to \nrepresent were also falsely imprisoned by Defendant when they were unlawfully detained beyond \ntheir legal release dates, causing the injuries described in this Complaint. \nCOUNT IV \nState Law Negligence \n84.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n85.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n86.  Defendant owes duties to avoid overdetention to persons in DOC custody, including \nPlaintiff and the members of the putative Class.52 \n87.  These duties were breached by Defendantโs acts and omissions, including the failure \nto timely release Plaintiff and the putative Class Members. \n88.  The risks and harms that Defendant caused were within the scope of protection \nafforded by the duties he owed to Plaintiff and to the putative Class Members. \n \n51 Kyle v.

As  a  result  of  Defendantโs  acts  and  omissions,  Plaintiff  and  the  putative  Class \nMembers suffered actual, foreseeable harm, as described in this Complaint. \nCOUNT V \nState Law Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n90.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n91.  Defendant  Leblanc  has  acted  intentionally  or  recklessly  regarding  the  false \nimprisonment and overdetention of Mr. Humphrey and the Members of the putative Class. \n92.  Defendantโs conduct has been extreme and outrageous, and it has been rooted in an \nabuse of power and authority over the freedom of Mr. Humphrey and the Members of the putative \nClass. \n93.  Defendantโs misconduct has caused severe emotional distress, induced by weeks and \neven months of caging in crowded, dangerous jails and prisons of persons who were legally entitled \nto be free.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiff Brian Humphrey requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor, \nand in favor of the putative class he seeks to represent, against Defendant James LeBlanc and order \nthe following relief: \n(a) An  order  and  judgment  awarding  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  to \nPlaintiff  and  to  the  members  of  the  putative  class  whom  Plaintiff  seeks  to \nrepresent; \n \n(b) An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and  \n \n(c) Any other relief this Court deems proper. \n \n \n52 Porter v.

      "text": "Case 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 1 of 21\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \nJOEL GIROIR, on behalf of himself and all   \nsimilarly situated individuals,     \n       \nPlaintiff,  CIVIL ACTION NO. 21-cv-108 \n   \nv.  CLASS ACTION \n   \nJAMES LEBLANC, in his official capacity as   \nSecretary  of  the  Louisiana  Department  of  JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \nPublic Safety & Corrections; and   \nTHE  LOUISIANA  DEPARTMENT  OF   \nPUBLIC SAFETY & CORRECTIONS,   \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  For years now, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (โthe \nDOCโ) has been unlawfully and knowingly overdetaining thousands of Louisiana residents in its \ncustody  every  year.  Defendant  James  LeBlanc,  Secretary  of  the  DOC,  has  known  about  this \nmisconduct since at least 2012. Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45, 48-49. Secretary LeBlanc has \nadmitted that the DOC is โlegally boundโ to release people on time, and he has admitted that the \nDOCโs chronic, unlawful overdetention is a โbig problem.โ Id. at 41. Yet the DOC has done little to \nfix this big problem, continuing to overdetain people as a matter of routine practice. \n2.  Many of these people are sentenced by a court to โtime servedโ or an equivalent \nsentence that legally entitles them to immediate release from the moment they are sentenced. But \nthey are not immediately released. Instead, as a standard practice, the DOC delays computation of \nrelease dates and, in the meantime, simply continues to detain people who should be free. Many are \nforced to sit for weeks or even months with no idea of when the DOC will get around to processing \ntheir paperwork and releasing them. The DOC, in other words, falsely imprisons thousands of \n1 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 2 of 21\n \npeople every year, upending lives, imposing punishment that no court has ordered, and creating \nuncertainty and misery for families across the state.  \n3.  Still, Secretary LeBlanc has not implemented any policy to ensure that the DOC \nstops overdetainingโand falsely imprisoningโLouisianans. The DOC overdetains so many people \nthat the DOC itself estimated that housing alone costs the state an extra $2.8M per year, Ex. 2, \nDOC Grant Application at 4, but Secretary LeBlanc has not attempted to reallocate that spending \ntoward new measures to prevent the DOC from holding people past their legal release dates. \n4.  Named Plaintiff Joel Giroir is a victim of the DOCโs misconduct. He seeks to \nrepresent a Class of all persons who have been, or will be, sentenced to the custody of the Louisiana \nDOC, and who were, or will be, entitled to release at the time of their sentencing, but who \nnevertheless remain in custody, now or in the future, for more than 48 hours past their sentencing \ndates.  On  behalf  of  the  numerous  people  subject  to  this  unlawful  practice,  Mr.  Giroir  seeks \ninjunctive and declaratory relief against this false and unlawful overdetention.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n1331 and 1343(a). It has jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367 \nbecause those claims arise from the same events and are part of the same case and controversy as \nthe federal claims.  \n6.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir was eligible for immediate release upon his resentencing on \nJanuary 26, 2021, but the DOC has not yet released him from custody. He is currently being heldโ\nillegallyโat St. Tammany Parish Jail. Although he is in the St. Tammany Parish Jail, he is in DOC \ncustody. \n2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 3 of 21\n \n8.  James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the DOC and its final policymaker. He has served \nin that role since 2008. He is appointed by the Louisiana governor and is the chief executive officer \nfor the DOC. He formulates rules and regulations for the DOC, and he determines policy regarding \nmanagement, personnel, and total operations for the agency. He oversees the DOCโs central office \nand its field unit staff, who are charged with carrying out the work of the agency and protecting the \nrights of all persons held in DOC custody. At all relevant times, Secretary LeBlanc has acted under \ncolor of law. He can be served at 504 Mayflower Street, Baton Rouge, LA 70802.  \n9.  The Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (โDOCโ) oversees the \ncustody and care of adults in its custody and includes adults under probation and parole supervision, \npursuant to La. R.S. ยง 36:4. The domicile of the DOC and its divisions is the parish of East Baton \nRouge, city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, pursuant to R.S. 15:821.1. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir \n10.  Joel Giroir is a 36-year-old man who is currently being imprisoned by the DOC in St. \nTammany Parish Jail. He is being overdetained and is entitled to immediate release. Ex. 3, Giroir \nDecl. at ยถยถ 1-2. \n11.  Mr. Giroir has served enough jail time to be eligible for immediate release. He was \nheld on an attachment with no bond in case number 589-169 and held on a $5000 bond in case \nnumber 589-855 in St. Tammany Parish Jail from January 30, 2018, to March 13, 2018. He was held \nwith no bond on case numbers 589-855 and 589-169 from June 12, 2018 until July 19, 2018.  On \nJuly 19, 2018, he was sentenced to 90 days in DOC custody in lieu of revocation. He served 110 \ndays in Concordia Parish Jail. He turned himself into St. Tammany Parish Jail on January 22, 2021, \nand was incarcerated there until his revocation hearing date on January 26, 2021. Id. at ยถ 4. \n3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 4 of 21\n \n12.  On  January  26,  2021,  Mr.  Giroir  had  a  probation  revocation  and  resentencing \nhearing. He was sentenced to one year in DOC custody. Id. at ยถ 5. \n13.  Under  Louisianaโs  โgood  timeโ  law,  Mr.  Giroir  is  entitled  to  a  diminution  of \nsentence. La. Rev. Stat. ยง 15:571.3(B)(1)(a). Because of his good behavior and because he was not \nconvicted of a crime of violence, he is only required to serve 35 percent of his one-year sentence, or \n128 days. Ex. 3, Giroir Decl. at ยถ 6. \n14.  As of the date of his revocation and sentencing on January 26, 2021, Mr. Giroir had \nserved at least 192 days in jail on his one-year sentence. Thus, on the date of his sentencing, he was \neligible for immediate release. Id. at ยถ 7. \n15.  Mr. Giroir was not immediately released on January 26, 2021, even though he had \nalready served at least 64 days beyond his sentence. He still has not been released. He is being \noverdetained in DOC custody. Id. at ยถ 8. \nII.  The DOC Has a Pattern and Practice of Overdetaining People in Its Custody \n16.  Mr. Giroirโs case is not an aberrationโon the contrary, his false imprisonment \nthrough overdetention is the standard practice of the DOCโa standard practice that Defendants \nhave known about for at least eight years, yet have failed to change. \n17.  Defendants have been aware of the problem of overdetention in Louisiana since at \nleast 2012. \n18.  The DOC has no process in place for ensuring that persons entitled to immediate \nrelease upon sentencing are actually released upon sentencing, or any time promptly thereafter.  \n19.  Instead, the DOC detains such people for weeks and even months with no idea \nwhether it has a legal right to imprison them at all. For the DOC, such determinations are made in \nan unhurried process in which the agency (1) waits days or weeks for others to provide it with the \npersonโs sentencing order, and then (2) waits weeks to actually examine that sentencing order and \n4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 5 of 21\n \ndetermine whether the DOC has the legal authority to continue to detain the person. During all that \ntime, the person who should be freeโwhom a judge has already deemed eligible for immediate \nreleaseโlanguishes behind bars. Thousands of people in Louisiana suffer this fate every year. \n20.  To make matters worse, the leadership of the DOC, including Secretary LeBlanc, \nhave been acutely aware of this problem since at least 2012. And after making half-hearted efforts to \nmitigate the problem, they have essentially abandoned those efforts and have specifically endorsed \noverdetention as a normal practice. \nA.  The  DOC  Detains  Thousands  of  People  Past  Their  Legal  Release  Dates \nEvery Year  \n21.  The DOC recognizes that a person who (1) has spent time in custody pretrial, (2) is \ngiven a sentence with credit for time served, and (3) has a sentence that is less than or equal to their \nperiod of pretrial custody is entitled to release on the day of their sentencing. See Ex. 4, Dep. of \nDOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 30-31. For example, a person who \nspent two months in jail awaiting sentencing, and is then sentenced to thirty days with credit for \ntime served, is entitled to release on the day of his sentencing.  \n22.  The DOC is responsible for a personโs overdetention from the day of sentencing, \neven if the person is not physically housed in a DOC facility.  \n23.  The DOC has conceded that a personโs โadmit dateโ to DOC custody is the date of \nthat personโs sentencing. Ex. 5, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Melanie Gueho at 53. Indeed, \nSecretary LeBlanc has explained that he is โresponsible for the inmates sentenced to the custody of \nthe DOC,โ whether they are in โa state-run facility, a parish-run facility, or private-facility.โ Ex. 1, \nDep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 13. \n24.  Any person who is detained past his or her legal release date is overdetained.  \n25.  The DOC admits that it is โlegally bound to release inmates on their release date.โ Id. \nat 15.  Secretary LeBlanc has stated that he first learned โthat thousands of people in the custody of \n5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 6 of 21\n \nthe Department of Corrections for whatever reason were being held past their release dateโ in 2012. \nId. at 48. But every investigation into the matter since that time has confirmed that the problem \ncontinues; indeed, it has even come to the attention of judges and legislators. \n26.  In 2012, a team of DOC staff performed a review of its time calculation processes, \nwhich revealed a widespread pattern of people being held significantly past their legal release dates.  \n27.  Specifically, the investigation found that when the DOC calculated the release dates \nof inmates, 83% were eligible for โimmediate release . . . due to an earlier release date.โ Ex. 6, DOC \nLean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 4.  \n28.  The DOC learned through this investigation that it was overdetaining over 2,000 \npeople each year, with an average of 71.69 โoverdue daysโ per person who was overdetained. Ex. 7, \nDep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 20. \n29.  The DOC has admitted that this is โa lot of overdetention.โ Ex. 8, Dep. of DOC \n30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker at 33. \n30.  The 2012 review found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the \nDOC to obtain documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and the remainder was caused by \nthe DOC itself taking an average of approximately 79 days to calculate sentences after it had the \nsentencing documents in hand. Id.1 \n31.  Under Louisiana law, confining any person without legal authority amounts to false \nimprisonment.  \n32.  Under settled decisions by the United States Supreme Court, correctional facilities \nare allowed some time to ensure that an imprisoned personโs release is administratively proper, but \n \n1 โQ. So this approximately 79-day number represents the DOCโs, to the best of its knowledge in \n2012, about how long it was taking for documents to wait at the DOC to be calculated? A. \nCorrect.โ. \n6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 7 of 21\n \nin all events, it is presumptively unreasonable to imprison a person for more than 48 hours after they \nare entitled to release. County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n33.  The DOCโs imprisonment of people for months after they are entitled to release \nviolates the laws of Louisiana and the United States. \n34.  No alarm was raised, however, following the 2012 study. After making their 2012 \nfindings, the DOC did not eliminate or even meaningfully mitigate the problem of overdetention. \nSecretary LeBlanc recently testified that he understood that โpeople [are still] being held [in DOC \ncustody] an average of about two months past their release date.โ Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc \nat 45. \n35.  Indeed, five years after the 2012 investigation, in 2017, another internal investigation \nreported that the DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days past \nthe end of their sentence.โ Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38.2   \n36.  So many people were being overdetained under this practice that it cost the state \nโ$2.8M per year in housing costs alone.โ Ex. 2, DOC Grant Application at 4. According to the \nDOC, this is โtaxpayer moneyโ that the โDOC should not have to spendโ on people whose \nsentences are complete. Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 35. \n37.  Defendants took no meaningful action in response to the 2017 investigation either.  \n38.  As recently as 2019, the DOC compiled a set of data and found that it had held 231 \nindividuals past their legal release dates in a single month (February of 2019) for an average of 44 \nextra days. See Ex. 9, Feb. 2019 Pull Doc. \n39.  The  DOC  gathered  this  information  in  order  to  estimate  the  magnitude  of  its \noverdetention problem as part of a grant application to the U.S. Department of Justice. The figures \n \n2 โQ. So itโs a true statement that the DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per \nmonth held an average of 49 days past the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ. \n7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 8 of 21\n \nsuggest that over 2,000 people per year are still being overdetained, seven years after the DOC first \nidentified the problem. \n40.  The causes of this problem have been obvious since at least the 2012 investigation.  \n41.  The 2012 inquiry found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the \nDOC to receive documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and then, even after receiving the \nsentencing papers, the DOC was taking an average of approximately 79 additional days to complete \nthe process of calculating sentences. Ex. 8, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker \nat 33. \n42.  In fact, the DOC waits nearly 11 days on average to even begin calculating a personโs \ntime once the paperwork is obtained from the sheriff or court clerk.3 \n43.  As the DOCโs overdetention practices have continued, judges and state legislators \nhave repeatedly reminded Secretary LeBlanc of the problem. \n44.  On January 20, 2015, Judge Mary Doggett of the 9th Judicial District Court sent an \nemail that was forwarded to Secretary LeBlanc complaining that an individual had been held past his \nrelease date by nearly two months โin spite of several phone calls from Judge Randow for his \nrelease.โ Ex. 10, Secretary LeBlanc Emails 3-4.4 \n45.  On January 28, 2016, a state legislatorโs office emailed Secretary LeBlanc regarding \nan individual who had obtained โan order of immediate releaseโ more than two weeks prior, and \nwas โstill being detained and has been given no explanation of the delay.โ Id. at 10.5 \n \n3 This number was obtained by calculating the average of the column โRECEIV TO COMPโ in Ex. \n9, Feb. 2019 Pull Doc. The โRECEIV TO COMPโ column provides, for each individual listed, the \nnumber of days that passed between the DOC receiving the personโs paperwork and the DOC \nbeginning the process of calculating the personโs time. \n4 Email from Mary Lauve Doggett, District Judge, 9th JDC, to Cole Gralapp, District Administrator, \nProbation and Parole (Jan. 20, 2015, 4:48 PM) (forwarded to James LeBlanc Jan. 23, 2015, 1:54 PM). \n5 Email from the office of Chris Hazel, State Representative, House District No. 27, to James \nLeBlanc, Secretary, DOC (Jan. 28, 2016, 9:44 AM). \n8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 9 of 21\n \n46.  On February 21, 2019, Secretary LeBlanc received an email from Judge Jules D. \nEdwards of the 15th Judicial District Court to which Judge Edwards had attached three articles \nabout overdetention in Louisiana and information about a specific overdetained person. Judge \nEdwards added that โdefense attorneys in Lafayette are also complaining about the failure to timely \nrelease inmates from LPCC.โ Secretary LeBlancโs response indicated that he had read at least one of \nthe articles. Id. at 1-2.6 \nB.  Secretary  LeBlanc  Has  Been  Deliberately  Indifferent  to  the  DOCโs \nOverdetention of Thousands of Louisianans \n47.  Multiple  investigations  since  2012,  and  repeated  attempts  to  intervene  by  other \nbranches of Louisiana government, have done little to change the DOCโs pattern of overdetention. \nThe DOC has been content to tinker around the edges of the problem, while doing little to actually \nreduce or eliminate the mass false incarceration it is committing. \n48.  Upon learning of the scale of its overdetention problem in 2012, the DOC did not \nset a goal of eliminating the problem. Rather, it set a goal to โ[r]educe the percentage of Immediate \nReleases by 80% (from 2252 to 450/yr)โ and to โ[r]educe the average number of days per case for \nimmediate releases from 71.69 days (non CTRP) to 31 days.โ Ex. 6, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 \nPreClassification at 5.7 \n49.  After learning in 2017 that the DOC was still detaining people an average of about \ntwo months past their legal release dates even with action taken after the 2012 review, Secretary \nLeBlanc did not fire anyone. He did not demote anyone. He did not dock anyoneโs pay. He did not \neven reprimand anyone. Ex. 1., Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 48-49. He did not take any supervisory \naction to prevent his agency from continuing to detain people past their legal release dates. \n \n6  Email  from  Jules  D.  Edwards  III,  District  Judge,  15th  JDC,  to  Rhett  Covington,  Assistant \nSecretary, DOC (forwarded to James LeBlanc Feb. 24, 2019, 6:14 PM). \n9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 10 of 21\n \n50.  Since that time, Secretary LeBlanc has not consulted with the heads of other statesโ \ndepartments of corrections about how they ensure that people are not detained past their legal \nrelease dates, aside from looking at some of the software that other states use. Id. at 103-04. \n51.  Secretary LeBlanc has suggested that overdetention might be somewhat lessened in \nLouisiana if the DOC were to go and pick up the paperwork necessary to process release dates \nrather than waiting for sheriffs and clerks to deliver it, id. at 80, 100-01, but neither Secretary \nLeBlanc nor the DOC has ever taken steps to implement that strategy. \n52.  Secretary LeBlanc has failed to adopt a policy proposed by a legislative auditor that \nwould impose a deadline on sheriffs to submit pre-classification packets to the DOC, despite his \nown admission that โthereโs no reason why [the DOC] couldnโtโ adopt such a policy and that he is \nโnot sure why we donโt, to be honest,โ and โwe could certainly, at least, make an attempt.โ8 \n53.  Secretary LeBlanc has not adopted any policy for the DOC requiring the immediate \ncalculation of sentences; instead, he has continued to permit sentences to be calculated in an ad hoc \nmanner after the DOC receives the relevant paperwork. \n54.  Eliminating the overdetention problem has remained a low priority. It has not even \nbeen included as a goal in the DOCโs strategic plans in any year from 2012 to the present. By \ncontrast, the DOC has set goals for itself in its strategic plans such as โMaintain the adult offender \ninstitution population at a minimum of 99% of design capacity through 2019.โ \n \n7 The DOC estimated that if it could achieve these goals of reducing the percentage of overdetained \npeople by 80% and reducing the average number of days of overdetention per person to 31 days, it \ncould save the state $3.7 million per year. Id. at 19. \n8 Crittindon v. Gusman, No. 3:17-cv-00512-SDD-EWD at 26 (M.D. La., Apr. 13, 2020) (order denying \nmotions for summary judgment) (โ[B]oth Secretary LeBlanc and Defendant Stagg testified in their \ndepositions that they were familiar with a proposal by the legislative auditor that such a deadline be \nimplemented, and both men expressed approval for the idea. In fact, when Secretary LeBlanc was \nasked at his deposition if it has โever been considered to include a timeframe for the submission of \nthese materials to DOC,โ he responded: โNot that Iโm aware of, but thereโs no reason why we \ncouldnโt. I mean, Iโm not sure why we donโt, to be honest with you.โ Secretary LeBlanc added: \n10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 11 of 21\n \n55.  Further, the DOC has declined help when offered. In 2019, the executive director of \nthe Louisiana Clerks of Court Association, Debbie Hudnall, had a series of meetings with the DOC \nand Secretary LeBlanc. Ms. Hudnall suggested that, to speed things up, the Clerks of Court could \nbegin  emailing  sentencing  documents  to  the  DOC.  The  DOC  declined,  claiming  without \nexplanation that they โdonโt have the capability of receiving that.โ Testimony of Debbie Hudnall, \nLouisiana House of Representatives, Judiciary Committee, Jan. 15, 2020, at 1:03:35.9 \n56.  Further, after his meeting with Ms. Hudnall, Secretary LeBlanc state that he would \nโdevelop an action plan with you and the Sheriffs' Offices in these areas to improve upon this \nturnaround  timeโ  and  โlook  at  the  feasibility  of  receiving  the  UCO  and  Bill  of  Information \ndocuments electronically.โ \n57.  But Secretary LeBlanc has never developed that action plan.  \n58.  And he never conducted the feasibility study. \n59.  Aside from the specific investigations in 2012, 2017, and 2019, the DOC does not \neven keep a record or count of individuals who have been overdetained. See Ex. 4, Dep. of DOC \n30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 29. \n60.  Indeed, the DOC has endorsed overdetention as a matter of policy.  \n61.  At least as late as May 2019, the DOC websiteโs โFrequently Asked Questionsโ page \nstated, โIf a person has recently been sentenced to DOC custody, it can take up to 12 weeks to \ncalculate a date as the Department has to receive official paperwork from the sentencing court in \norder to calculate the offenderโs release date.โ The DOC has since removed the reference to taking \nโup to 12 weeks to calculate a date,โ a timeframe even Secretary LeBlanc conceded was โridiculousโ \nand โabsurd.โ Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 88-90. \n \nโIโm not sure that we could enforce it to begin with, but we could certainly, at least, make an \nattempt.โโ) (emphasis in original). \n9 http://house.louisiana.gov/H_Video/VideoArchivePlayer.aspx?v=house/2019/dec/1212_19_JU. \n11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 12 of 21\n \n62.  The DOC also included an audio statement in its voicemail recording saying that it \nโtakes at least 90 days after sentencingโ for the department to calculate a personโs time. This \nstatement was finally removed from the voicemail recording in or around February or March of \n2019. See Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 12-13. \n63.  These  voicemail  and  website  statements  reveal  both  the  scope  of  the  DOCโs \nmisconduct and Defendantsโ indifference to it; their purpose was to discourage family members \nfrom โinundat[ing]โ the DOC with questions about when their loved onesโwho had been told by a \njudge that they were free to rejoin their familiesโwould actually be released. See Ex. 1, Dep. of \nSecretary LeBlanc at 89; see also Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 18. \n64.  Mr. Giroir is one of thousands of people who have been wrongfully imprisoned as a \nresult of Secretary LeBlancโs demonstrated indifference to the DOCโs unlawful conduct. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n65.  Named Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this action, on behalf of himself and all others \nsimilarly situated, to assert the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common basis. \n66.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nI.  The Plaintiff Class \n67.  Named Plaintiff proposes a class defined as all persons who have been, or will be, \nsentenced to the custody of the Louisiana DOC, and who were, or will be, entitled to release at the \ntime of their sentencing, but who nevertheless remain in custody, now or in the future, for more \nthan 48 hours past their sentencing dates. The Class seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against \nthis overdetention and false imprisonment. \n12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 13 of 21\n \nII.  Rule 23(a) \n68.  The proposed class satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a). \nA.  Numerosity โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n69.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The most \nrecent overdetention data from the DOC (from February of 2019) shows that over 200 individuals \nwere  overdetained  in  a  single  month,  suggesting  that  the  DOC  overdetains  more  than  2,000 \nindividuals over the course of a year. This 2019 count was consistent with data from 2017, which \nshowed that the DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held . . . past the end of their \nsentence.โ Ex. 7, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38.10 Upon information and \nbelief,  the  DOC  has  not  implemented  any  meaningful  changes  that  might  have  significantly \nmitigated the rate of overdetention that was captured in the February 2019 snapshot. Plaintiff \ntherefore estimates a class size of approximately 200 current members, with over 2,000 estimated \nindividuals who will become class members during the course of the next year. \nB.  Commonality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n70.  All members of the proposed Class are subject to the same systemic unconstitutional \npolicies, acts, and omissions on the part of Defendants described in this Complaint, and all are \nsuffering or will suffer violations of their constitutional rights and their rights under state law as a \nresult of the DOCโs pattern and practice of overdetaining people in its custody. \n71.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the class. \n72.  Questions of law that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \n \n10 โQ. So itโs a true statement that the DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per \nmonth held an average of 49 days past the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ \n13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 14 of 21\n \nโข  Whether  the  DOC  has  the  legal  authority  to  hold  class  members  past  their \nsentencing dates under the United States Constitution; \nโข  Whether Class Members have a liberty interest in their immediate release upon \nsentencing under the United States Constitution; \nโข  Whether Defendantsโ failure to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention \nconstitutes deliberate indifference; \nโข  Whether  the  DOC  has  the  legal  authority  to  hold  class  members  past  their \nsentencing dates under the Louisiana Constitution; \nโข  Whether Class Members have a liberty interest in their immediate release upon \nsentencing under the Louisiana Constitution; and \nโข  Whether  the  DOCโs  detention  of  Class  Members  past  their  legal  release  dates \nconstitutes false imprisonment under state law. \n \n73.  Questions of fact that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \nโข  Whether the DOC has a pattern of overdetaining people in its custody; \nโข  Whether Defendants are aware of the DOCโs pattern of overdetaining people;  \nโข  Whether the DOC is responsible for people sentenced to DOC custody from the \nday they are sentenced; and \nโข  Whether Defendants failed to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention. \n \n74.  Defendants  are  expected  to  raise  common  defenses  to  these  claims,  including \ndenying that their actions violate the law. \nC.  Typicality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n75.  Named Plaintiffโs claims are typical of those of the Class, as his claims arise from the \nsame policies, practices, or courses of conduct as those of the Class, and his claims are based on the \nsame theories of law as the Classโs claims. Named Plaintiff Joel Giroir was eligible for immediate \nrelease upon his sentencing, and the DOC has held him in custody past his sentencing date. See Ex. \n3, Giroir Decl. Mr. Giroir is therefore typical of the putative Class, and he suffers the same injury of \noverdetention described in this Complaint.  \nD.  Adequacy โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n76.  Named Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the Class because his interests in the \nvindication of the legal claims that he raises are entirely aligned with the interests of the other Class \n14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 15 of 21\n \nMembers, who each have the same basic constitutional claims. Named Plaintiff is a member of the \nClass, and his interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the other Class Members. \n77.  There are no known conflicts of interest among Class Members, all of whom have a \nsimilar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights. \n78.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Promise of Justice Initiative, Loevy \nand Loevy, and Most & Associates, who have experience in litigating complex civil rights matters, \nincluding class actions, related to prisonersโ rights in federal court and extensive knowledge of both \nthe details of the DOC and the relevant constitutional and statutory law. Most & Associates has \nlitigated a number of individual overdetention cases in Louisiana, and all class counsel are currently \nlitigating a class action case involving overdetention in Louisiana, Humphrey v. LeBlanc, 20-cv-233 \n(M.D. La). \n79.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of local law and practices as they relate \nto federal constitutional requirements. \nIII.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n80.  Class action status is appropriate because Defendants have acted or will act in the \nsame  unconstitutional  manner  with  respect  to  all  Class  Members.  Defendants  unlawfully  and \nknowingly detain thousands of Louisianans past their legal release dates every year. \n81.  The Class therefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants from \ncontinuing to overdetain and falsely imprison people in their custody. Because the putative Class \nchallenges Defendantsโ conduct as unconstitutional through declaratory and injunctive relief, which \nwould apply the same relief to every Class Member, Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate and \nnecessary. \n82.  Injunctive  relief  compelling  Defendants  to  comply  with  Class  Membersโ \nconstitutional rights will similarly protect each Class Member from being subjected to Defendantsโ \n15 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 16 of 21\n \nunlawful  policies  and  practices.  A  declaration  and  injunction  stating  that  Defendants  cannot \ncontinue to detain people past their legal release dates would provide relief to every Class Member. \nTherefore, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Class as a whole is appropriate. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n83.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n84.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n85.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution is violated where a person remains incarcerated after the legal authority to hold that \nperson has expired. See Douthit v. Jones, 619 F.2d 527, 532 (5th Cir. 1980). No privilege enables a \njailor to detain a person beyond the period of that personโs lawful sentence. See Whirl v. Kern, 407 \nF.2d 781, 791 (5th Cir. 1968); see also Powell v. Barrett, 376 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1351 (N.D. Ga. 2005) \n(detainee has constitutional right to be free from continued detention after it was or should have \nbeen known that he was entitled to release). \n86.  The DOCโs legal authority to detain Plaintiff Joel Giroir expired on the day of his \nsentencing, January 26, 2021. Yet pursuant to an unlawful standard practice that has existed for \nyears, the DOC continues to detain Plaintiff. \n87.  The DOC is falsely imprisoning Plaintiff pursuant to a practice that has existed for \nyears in which it waits weeks and even months to determine whether it has lawful authority to \nimprison persons who in fact were entitled to release on the day of their sentences. That practice is \ninjuring the hundreds of members of the putative class, as described in this Complaint. \n16 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 17 of 21\n \n88.  Secretary LeBlanc has been aware of this practice since at least 2012, but he has not \nattempted to stop it; instead, Defendants have attempted to normalize their own misconduct.  \n89.  Secretary LeBlancโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to prevent overdetention is \nโdeliberately indifferentโ because โit is obvious that the likely consequences of not adopting a policy \nwill be a deprivation of constitutional rights.โ Rhyne v. Henderson Cnty., 973 F.2d 386, 392 (5th Cir. \n1992). \n90.  In failing to adopt any policy to prevent predictable overdetention, Secretary LeBlanc \nacted with deliberate indifference. This is evidenced by the fact that every investigation into the \nmatter  since  2012  has  shown  that  overdetention  is  a  persistent  and  widespread  problem  in \nLouisiana, yet Secretary LeBlanc did not create any policy to attempt to remedy the problem. \n91.  Through his deliberate indifference, Secretary LeBlanc is depriving Mr. Giroir, and \nall Members of the putative Class he seeks to represent, of the fundamental right to liberty and \nviolating their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, causing the injuries described \nin this Complaint. \nCOUNT II \nDue Process under Article I, Section 2 of the Louisiana Constitution \n92.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n93.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n94.  Article One, Section Two of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 guarantees that \nโ[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law.โ  \n95.  By reason of the same conduct that violates Plaintiffโs federal constitutional rights, \nDefendants violate Plaintiffโs state constitutional rights to liberty and due process, as well as the state \n17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 18 of 21\n \nconstitutional rights of the putative class he seeks to represent, causing the injuries described in this \nComplaint. \nCOUNT III \nFalse Imprisonment under State Law \n96.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n97.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n98.  Defendants are committing the tort of false imprisonment against Plaintiff because \nthe DOC is โrestrain[ing] [Plaintiff] against his will without a warrant or other statutory authority,โ \nKyle v. City of New Orleans, 353 So.2d 969, 971 (La. 1977); see also Miller v. Desoto Regional Health Sys., \n128 So.3d 649, 655-56 (La. App. 3d Cir. 2013), beyond Plaintiffโs legal release date. By definition, the \nClass Members Plaintiff seeks to represent are also falsely imprisoned by Defendants because they \nare, or will be, unlawfully detained beyond their legal release dates, causing the injuries described in \nthis Complaint. \nCOUNT IV \nState Law Negligence \n99.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n100.  Plaintiff Joel Giroir brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the putative \nClass against Defendants. \n101.  Defendants owe duties to avoid overdetention to persons in DOC custody, including \nPlaintiff and the members of the putative Class. Porter v. Epps, 659 F. 3d 440, 445 (5th Cir. 2011) (a \njailor has โnot only the duty to protect a prisoner, but also the duty to effect his timely release.โ). \n18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 19 of 21\n \n102.  These duties are being breached by Defendantsโ acts and omissions, including the \nfailure to timely release Plaintiff and the putative Class Members. \n103.  The risks and harms that Defendants cause are within the scope of protection \nafforded by the duties Defendants owe to Plaintiff and to the putative Class Members. \n104.  As  a  result  of  Defendantsโ  acts  and  omissions,  Plaintiff  and  the  putative  Class \nMembers are suffering actual, foreseeable harm, as described in this Complaint. \nCOUNT V \nState Law Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n105.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n106.  Defendants have acted intentionally or recklessly regarding the false imprisonment \nand overdetention of Mr. Giroir and the Members of the putative Class. \n107.  Defendantsโ conduct is extreme and outrageous, and it is rooted in an abuse of \npower and authority over the freedom of Mr. Giroir and the Members of the putative Class. \n108.  Defendantsโ misconduct is causing severe emotional distress, induced by weeks and \neven months of caging in crowded, dangerous jails and prisons of persons who are legally entitled to \nbe free.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiff Joel Giroir requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor, and in \nfavor of the putative class he seeks to represent, against Defendants and order the following relief: \n(a) An order and judgment declaring that Defendantsโ practice of routinely allowing \nindividuals to be incarcerated past their legal release dates violates Plaintiffโs \nrights under the United States Constitution as well as the state law rights of the \nclass Plaintiff seeks to represent; \n \n(b) An  order  and  judgment  enjoining  Defendants  from  continuing  to  allow \nindividuals  to  be  incarcerated  past  their  legal  release  dates  and  ordering \nDefendants to establish procedures to prevent all such overdetention; \n \n19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 1    02/19/21   Page 20 of 21\n \n(c) An order and judgment requiring Defendants to calculate sentences and release \nas soon as reasonably feasible, and in no event longer than 48 hours after the \nperson is sentenced, for all persons sentenced to the custody of the DOC who \nare eligible for immediate release upon sentencing; \n \n(d) An order and judgment ordering Defendants to release Plaintiff and all members \nof the class Plaintiff seeks to represent; \n \n(e) An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and all other applicable laws; and  \n \n(f)  Any other relief this Court deems proper. \n \nJURY DEMAND \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues \nso triable. \nRespectfully submitted this 19th day of February, 2021. \n \n/s/ Mercedes Montagnes \nMercedes Montagnes, La.

Plaintiff Joel Giroir \n(โPlaintiffโ or โGiroirโ) opposes the motion. (Doc. 21.) Defendants filed a reply. (Doc. 24.) Oral \nargument is not necessary. The Court has carefully considered the law, the facts in the record, and \nthe arguments and submissions of the parties and is prepared to rule. For the following reasons, \nthe motion is granted in part and denied in part, and Plaintiff is given twenty-eight (28) days within \nwhich to file an amended complaint. \nI.  Relevant Background \nThis civil rights action arises from a claim of over-detention of an inmate in the DOCโs \ncustody. The following factual allegations are taken from Plaintiffโs Class Action Complaint \n(โComplaintโ). (Doc. 1.) They are assumed to be true for purposes of this motion. Thompson v. \nCity of Waco, 764 F.3d 500, 502โ03 (5th Cir. 2014). \nBetween 2018 and 2021, Plaintiff was incarcerated at the St. Tammany Parish Jail and in \nDOC custody at the Concordia Parish Jail in connection with other criminal matters. (Doc. 1 at 3.) \nOn January 26, 2021, while still incarcerated at St. Tammany Parish Jail (id.), Plaintiff appeared \nfor a probation revocation and resentencing hearing and was sentenced to one year in DOC \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 2 of 15\ncustody. (Id. at 4.) At that time, however, Plaintiff โhad served at least 192 days in jail,โ such that \nโhe was eligible for immediate releaseโ under Louisianaโs โgood timeโ law. (Id. (citing La. R.S.  \nยง 15:571(B)(1)(a)).) According to the Complaint, in accordance with Louisianaโs โgood timeโ law, \nbecause of Plaintiffโs good behavior and because he was not convicted of a crime of violence, he \nwas only required to serve 35% of his one-year sentence, or 128 days. (Id.) Thus, at the time of \nPlaintiffโs revocation and resentencing hearing on January 26, 2021, he had already served 64 days \nbeyond his one-year sentence. (Id.) Nevertheless, Plaintiff remained in DOC custody. (Id.) Three \ndays after filing the instant lawsuit, Plaintiff was released from DOC custody on February 22, \n2021. (See Doc. 17-1 at 2 (citing Doc. 17-2).)1 \nPlaintiff avers that his experience is not an aberration. (Doc. 1 at 4.) On the contrary, the \nComplaint alleges that the DOC has a known pattern and practice of overdetaining people in its \ncustody. (Id.) In the Complaint, Plaintiff details the findings of an investigation conducted by the \nDOC in 2012 (id. at 6), which uncovered that the DOC โwas overdetaining over 2,000 people each \nyear, with an average of 71.69 โoverdue daysโ per person who was overdetained.โ (Id. (citing Doc. \n1-8 at 9).) This investigation also revealed that the DOC took โan average of approximately 79 \ndays to calculate sentencesโ after receiving sentencing documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ \noffices. (Id. (citing Doc. 1-9 at 6).) Moreover, โthe DOC waits nearly 11 days on average to even \nbegin calculating a personโs timeโ once that paperwork is received, according to the Complaint. \n(Id. at 8 (referencing Doc. 1-10).) \n \n1 The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff still had not been released and was presently being overdetained in DOC custody. \n(Doc. 1 at 4.) But in Defendantsโ memorandum in support of their motion, they represent that Plaintiff was released \non February 22, 2021, and attach a Certificate of Release as Exhibit 1. (See Doc. 17-1 at 2 (citing Doc. 17-2).) Plaintiff \ndoes not object to this Certificate of Release in his opposition. (See Doc. 21.) And in any event, the Court may take \njudicial notice of this document, which reflects a matter of public record. See Frampton v. City of Baton Rouge/Par. \nof E. Baton Rouge, No. 21-CV-362-JWD-SDJ, 2022 WL 90238, at *6 n.67 (M.D. La. Jan. 7, 2022) (citing Fetty v. \nLa. State Bd. of Priv. Sec. Examโrs, No. CV 18-517-JWD-EWD, 2020 WL 448231, at *8 (M.D. La. Jan. 28, 2020) \n(โ[I]t is clearly proper in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to take judicial notice of matters of public record.โ)). \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 3 of 15\nPlaintiff alleges that LeBlanc, as Secretary of the DOC, has known of the DOCโs pattern \nand practice of overdetention since at least 2012. (See id. at 1, 4โ6.) Additionally, Plaintiff alleges \nthat LeBlanc testified during a deposition that he is โresponsible for the inmates sentenced to the \ncustody of the DOC,โ whether they are in โa state-run facility, a parish-run facility, or a private-\nfacility.โ (Id. at 5 (citing Doc. 1-2 at 7).) LeBlanc also admitted during his deposition that the DOC \nis โlegally bound to release inmates on their release date.โ (Id. (citing Doc. 1-2 at 8).) Despite the \nfindings  of  the  DOCโs  investigation  in  2012,  the  DOC  failed  to  take  action  to  correct  its \noverdetention problem, according to Plaintiff, as LeBlanc later admitted in his deposition that \npeople are still being held in DOC custody an average of almost two months past their release \ndates. (Id. at 7 (citing Doc. 1-2 at 10).) LeBlanc has identified certain strategies that could mitigate \noverdetention; however, Defendants have taken no steps to implement them. (See id. at 10โ11.) \nOn February 19, 2021, while still in DOC custody, Plaintiff filed this class action suit \nagainst the DOC and LeBlanc, in his official capacity as Secretary of the DOC. (Id. at 3.) Plaintiffโs \nComplaint โproposes a class defined as all persons who have been, or will be, sentenced to the \ncustody of the Louisiana DOC, and who were, or will be, entitled to release at the time of their \nsentencing, but who nevertheless remain in custody, now or in the future, for more than 48 hours \npast their sentencing dates.โ (Id. at 12.) Plaintiff asserts a claim on behalf of himself and the \nproposed class under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution (Count I). (Id. at 16โ17.) Plaintiff also asserts state law claims \non behalf of himself and the proposed class for violating Article One, Section Two of the Louisiana \nConstitution (Count II) (id. at 17โ18); false imprisonment (Count III) (id. at 18); negligence (Count \nIV) (id. at 18โ19); and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count V) (id. at 19). Plaintiff \nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneysโ fees and costs, and any other relief the Court \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 4 of 15\ndeems proper. (Id. at 19โ20.) Defendants now move to dismiss Plaintiffโs claims pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. 17.) \nII.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standard \nโFederal pleading rules call for a โshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the \npleader is entitled to relief,โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2); they do not countenance dismissal of a \ncomplaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted.โ Johnson v. \nCity of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014) (citation omitted). \nInterpreting Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Fifth Circuit has \nexplained: \nThe complaint (1) on its face (2) must contain enough factual matter (taken as true) \n(3) to raise a reasonable hope or expectation (4) that discovery will reveal relevant \nevidence of each element of a claim. โAsking for [such] plausible grounds to infer \n[the element of a claim] does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading \nstage;  it  simply  calls for  enough  facts to  raise  a  reasonable  expectation  that \ndiscovery will reveal [that the elements of the claim existed].โ \n \nLormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., 565 F.3d 228, 257 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007)). \nApplying the above case law, the Western District of Louisiana has stated: \n \nTherefore, while the court is not to give the โassumption of truthโ to conclusions, \nfactual allegations remain so entitled. Once those factual allegations are identified, \ndrawing on the court's judicial experience and common sense, the analysis is \nwhether those facts, which need not be detailed or specific, allow โthe court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ \n[Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)]; Twombly, 55[0] U.S. at 556. This \nanalysis is not substantively different from that set forth in Lormand, supra, nor \ndoes this jurisprudence foreclose the option that discovery must be undertaken in \norder to raise relevant information to support an element of the claim. The standard, \nunder the specific language of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), remains that the defendant \nbe given adequate notice of the claim and the grounds upon which it is based. The \nstandard is met by the โreasonable inferenceโ the court must make that, with or \nwithout discovery, the facts set forth a plausible claim for relief under a particular \ntheory of law provided that there is a โreasonable expectationโ that โdiscovery will \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 5 of 15\nreveal relevant evidence of each element of the claim.โ Lormand, 565 F.3d at 257; \nTwombly, 55[0] U.S. at 556. \n \nDiamond Servs. Corp. v. Oceanografia, S.A. De C.V., No. 10-00177, 2011 WL 938785, at *3 \n(W.D. La. Feb. 9, 2011) (citation omitted). \nIn deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, all well-pleaded facts are taken as true and viewed in \nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff. Thompson v. City of Waco, 764 F.3d 500, 502โ03 (5th Cir. \n2014). The task of the Court is not to decide if the plaintiff will eventually be successful, but to \ndetermine if a โlegally cognizable claimโ has been asserted. Id. at 503. \nIII.  Discussion \nA.  Partiesโ Arguments \n1. Defendantsโ Original Memorandum (Doc. 17-1) \nIn support of their motion, Defendants assert three grounds for dismissal of Plaintiffโs \nclaims. (See Doc. 17-1 at 1.) First, Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for \nprospective relief concerning past harms. (Id. at 3โ5.) Defendants assert that the proposed class \ndescribed in the Complaint comprises three groups: (1) inmates who were entitled to release at the \ntime they were sentenced to DOC custody, but remained in custody for more than 48 hours after \ntheir release date, and were released; (2) inmates who were entitled to release at the time they were \nsentenced to DOC custody, but will remain in custody for more than 48 hours past their release \ndate; and (3) inmates who will be sentenced to DOC custody, will be entitled to release, and will \nremain in custody more than 48 hours past their release date. (Id. at 4.) Defendants seek dismissal \nas to the first group, arguing that Plaintiff cannot seek prospective relief for a past harm. (Id.) \nDefendants argue that the first group of individuals lack standing to pursue injunctive relief \nbecause their claims are moot. Defendants represent that, under Supreme Court precedent, claims \nfor injunctive relief require continuing, present harm to the claimant in order to confer standing. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 6 of 15\n(Id. at 4โ5 (citing City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983)).) Accordingly, Defendants \nargue that any claims for inmates who were released prior to the filing of this lawsuit are moot \nbecause there is no likelihood of future injury. (Id. at 5.) Notably, Defendants do not challenge the \nstanding of the named plaintiff, Giroir. Instead, Defendants seek dismissal of only those claims for \nprospective relief as to any past harms. (Id.) \nSecond, Defendants assert that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for injunctive relief because \nthe relief sought is fatally overbroad. (Id.) According to Defendants, the Complaintโs request for \ninjunctive and declaratory relief that Defendants โcomply with Class Membersโ constitutional \nrightsโ and that Defendants โcannot continue to detain people past their legal release datesโ is \noverbroad and conclusory. (Id. (citing Doc. 1 at ยถยถ 81โ82).) In support of this assertion, Defendants \nargue that โ[t]he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established, and \nan injunction must be narrowly tailored to remedy the specific action necessitating the injunction.โ \n(Id. (citing Fiber Sys. Intโl., Inc. v. Roehrs, 470 F.3d 1150, 1159 (5th Cir. 2006)).) Additionally, \nDefendants assert that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d) requires that injunctions have enough \nspecificity โso that those enjoined will know what conduct the court has prohibited.โ (Id. at 5โ6 \n(citing Meyer v. Brown & Root Constr. Co., 661 F.2d 369, 373 (5th Cir. 1981)).) Next, Defendants \nanalogize the facts of this case with Williams v. Recovery School District, 859 F. Supp. 2d 824 \n(E.D. La. 2021). (Id. at 6.) In Williams, the Eastern District of Louisiana dismissed a suit seeking \ninjunctive relief against a state entity, holding that the request was fatally overbroad. See 859 F. \nSupp. 2d at 833. Defendants argue that, like in Williams, Plaintiffโs request for injunctive relief in \nthis case is overbroad and vague, and should be dismissed on that basis. (Id.)  \nDefendants further contend that Plaintiffโs โoverbroad and vague injunction request is a \nfatal flawโ regarding the class action. (Id. at 6.) Defendants state that Federal Rule of Civil \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 7 of 15\nProcedure 23(b)(2) requires specificity and must โgive content to the injunctive relief [sought] so \nthat final injunctive relief may be crafted to describe in reasonable detail the acts required.โ (Id. \n(citing Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, 367 (5th Cir. 2017)).) Defendants further represent that other \ncourts have required plaintiffs in overdetention class actions to โchallenge a specific policy, and \nnot simply the length of delay to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2).โ (Id. (citing Otero v. Dart, 301 F.R.D. 276, \n281 (N.D. Ill. 2013)).) Defendants thus argue that โcompelling Defendants to comply with Class \nMembersโ constitutional rightsโ is insufficient to state a claim for class action injunctive relief. \n(Id. at 7 (citing Ward v. Hellerstedt, 753 F. Appโx 263, 249 (5th Cir. 2018)).) \nThird, Defendants alternatively seek dismissal of any claim that arose more than one year \nbefore Plaintiff filed suit, contending that such claims have prescribed. (See id.) Defendants assert \nthat the applicable statute of limitations period for Section 1983 actions in Louisiana is one year. \n(Id.)  Accordingly,  Defendants  seek  dismissal  of  any  overdetention  claim  that  arose  before \nFebruary 19, 2020 on the basis of prescription. (Id. at 8.) \n2. Plaintiffโs Opposition (Doc. 21) \nIn response, Plaintiff rejects Defendantsโ arguments as ill-founded and urges this Court to \ndeny Defendantsโ motion. (Doc. 21 at 2.) First, Plaintiff responds to Defendantsโ contentions \nregarding standing and prescription, asserting that Defendants misconstrue Plaintiffโs proposed \nclass. (Id.) Plaintiff clarifies that, contrary to Defendantsโ assertions, โ[i]ndividuals who have been \nreleased are not part of the proposed injunctive class.โ (Id. at 3.) Instead, โthe class is defined to \ninclude only those persons who are overdetained now or in the future.โ (Id.) Plaintiff further \nexplains:  \nDefendants make clear that they are not challenging Plaintiffโs standing to seek \nprospective  relief  and  only  seek  dismissal  of  โclaims  for  prospective  relief \nconcerning any individual who was allegedly โoverdetainedโ and released before \nsuit was filed.โ Plaintiffsโ proposed class does not include such persons. Thus, \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 8 of 15\nDefendantsโ motion to dismiss these persons from the case should be denied as \nmoot. \n \n(Id. at 3 (citation omitted) (citing Doc. 17-1 at 5).) \nSecond, Plaintiff asserts that Defendantsโ overbreadth argument is flawed in multiple \nrespects. (Id.) For one, Defendants fail to clearly identify what about the Complaint is overbroad. \n(Id. at 4.) Though Defendants quote case law for the proposition that injunctions must be narrowly \ntailored to remedy the specific action complained of, according to Plaintiff, Defendants never \nexplain how the Complaint fails to meet that standard. (Id. (citing Doc. 17-1 at 6).) Plaintiff \nmaintains that his request for injunctive relief is not fatally overbroad (id. (citing Doc. 17-1 at 6)); \nrather, the prayer for relief requests multiple, specific remedies (id. (citing Doc. 1 at 19โ20)). \nPlaintiff next contends that Defendantsโ overbreadth argument is flawed for the additional reason \nthat Defendants improperly rely on case law addressing injunctive orders under Rule 65, whereas \ncomplaints โare merely subject to the notice-pleading requirements of Rule 8.โ (Id. at 5.) Plaintiff \nacknowledges that Rule 65(d) requires specificity in framing injunctions, as Defendants note in \ntheir brief. (Id. (citing Doc. 17-1 at 5โ6).) โBut Rule 65(d) has nothing to do with pleadings,โ \nargues Plaintiff. (Id.) โIt governs injunctive orders.โ (Id.) \nFinally, Plaintiff contends that Defendantsโ argument regarding the class action allegations \nrely on misapplied case law. (Id.) Plaintiff states that Defendants improperly rely on case law \napplying Rule 23 when they suggest that Plaintiff must challenge a specific policy rather than \noverdetentions alone. (Id. at 6โ7 (referencing Doc. 17-1 at 6โ7).) Plaintiff argues that Defendantsโ \nassertions regarding Rule 23 are premature at the pleadings stage, and that such issues are more \nappropriately raised at the class certification stage. (Id. at 7.) \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 9 of 15\n3. Defendantsโ Reply (Doc. 24) \nIn their reply, Defendants mostly re-urge the main arguments raised in their original \nmemorandum. (See Doc. 24.) First, Defendants maintain that the Complaint could be construed as \nrequesting prospective relief for past harms, notwithstanding Plaintiffโs concession that he is not \nseeking such relief. (Id. at 1โ2.) Defendants reassert their request to dismiss any such claims. (Id.) \nSecond, Defendants maintain that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for injunctive relief because \nthe relief sought is fatally overbroad. (Id. at 1โ3.) Relying primarily on Williams, Defendants argue \nthat Plaintiffโs injunctive relief claim โdoes not survive Rule 12 scrutiny,โ since โPlaintiff cannot \nand does not identify a specific policy or act that he seeks to enjoin.โ (Id. at 3.) \nLastly,  Defendants  reassert  their  prescription  argument  and  contend  that  Plaintiffโs \nโadmission that he is not seeking relief for an individual who has been released does not obviate \nthe need for dismissal of claims arising more than one year before suit was filedโ based on \nprescription. (Id. at 1.) Defendants submit that prescription accrues on the date of sentencing, \naccording to Plaintiffโs theory, such that any claim for past overdetention would prescribe one year \nfrom  sentencing.  (Id.  at  3โ4.)  Accordingly,  Defendants  seek  dismissal  of  any  claim  of \noverdetention that occurred before February 19, 2020. (Id. at 4.) \nB.  Claims for Prospective Relief Concerning Past Harm \nDefendantsโ motion seeks dismissal of any claims for prospective relief asserted on behalf \nof individuals who were released before the instant suit was filed because there is no likelihood of \nfuture injury as to those claims concerning past harms. (See Doc. 17-1 at 4โ5.) The Complaint \nalleges: \nNamed Plaintiff proposed a class defined as all persons who have been, or will be, \nsentenced to the custody of the Louisiana DOC, and who were, or will be, entitled \nto release at the time of their sentencing, but who nevertheless remain in custody, \nnow or in the future, for more than 48 hours past their sentencing dates. The Class \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 10 of 15\nseeks  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  against  this  overdetention  and  false \nimprisonment. \n \n(Doc. 1 at 12 (emphasis added).) Indeed, Plaintiff expressly acknowledges in his opposition that \nโ[i]ndividuals who have been released are not part of the proposed injunctive class.โ (Doc. 21 at \n3.) As further explained in Plaintiffโs opposition: โPlaintiffโs proposed class definition does indeed \ninclude individuals sentenced in the past, but only if such individuals currently remain in custody \npast their legal release dates or in the future will be in custody past their legal release dates.โ (Id.) \nConsidering the foregoing and viewing the Complaintโs allegations in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiff, the Court does not find that Plaintiff is asserting claims for injunctive or declaratory relief \non behalf of any individual who was overdetained in DOC custody and released before Plaintiff \nfiled this lawsuit. Accordingly, Defendantsโ motion to dismiss as to these claims is denied as moot. \nC.  Prescription \n1. Applicable Law \nโA statute of limitations may support dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) where it is evident \nfrom the plaintiffโs pleadings that the action is barred and the pleadings fail to raise some basis for \ntolling or the like.โ Jones v. Alcoa, Inc., 339 F.3d 359, 366 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing Taylor v. Books \nA Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378โ79 (5th Cir. 2002)). โThe statute of limitations for a suit brought \nunder ยง 1983 is determined by the general statute of limitations governing personal injuries in the \nforum state.โ Piotrowski v. City of Houston, 237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Pete v. \nMetcalfe, 8 F.3d 214, 217 (5th Cir. 1993)). The prescriptive period for a claim under ยง 1983 in \nLouisiana is one year. Jacobsen v. Osborne, 133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir. 1998). \nWhile the limitations period is determined by state law, the accrual of a ยง 1983 claim is a \nmatter of federal law. Burrell v. Newsome, 883 F.2d 416, 418 (5th Cir. 1989). โUnder federal law, \nthe limitations period begins to run the moment the plaintiff becomes aware that he has suffered \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 11 of 15\nan injury or has sufficient information to know that he has been injured.โ Piotrowski, 237 F.3d at \n576 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (citing Russell v. Bd. of Trustees, 968 F.2d \n489, 493 (5th Cir. 1992)). \n2. Analysis \nAs previously noted, Plaintiffโs Complaint asserts overdetention claims on behalf of all \npersons โwho were, or will be, entitled to release at the time of their sentencing, but who \nnevertheless remain in [DOC] custody, now or in the future, for more than 48 hours past their \nsentencing dates.โ (Doc. 1 at 12.) This includes individuals sentenced in the past, as Plaintiff notes, \nso long as those individuals currently remain in custody or will be in custody in the future. (See \nDoc. 21 at 3.)  Again, Plaintiff filed suit on February 19, 2021. (See Doc. 1.) \nBased on the allegations of the Complaint, it is theoretically possible that an individualโs \noverdetention claim could have accrued before February 19, 2020. For instance, if the individualโs \nsentencing occurred before February 17, 2020, and following the 48-hour period after their \nsentencing date, they remained in custody for an additional year, the one-year limitations period \nwould have run by the time Plaintiff filed this action on February 19, 2021. Accordingly, insofar \nas Plaintiff seeks to bring claims of overdetention on behalf of proposed class members whose \nsentencings occurred before February 17, 2020, such claims are time-barred under the applicable \nlimitations period, and Defendantsโ motion is granted as to these claims. \nD.  Injunctive Relief \n1. Applicable Law \nโAn injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should not issue except upon a clear \nshowing of possible irreparable injury.โ Lewis v. S.S. Baune, 534 F.2d 1115, 1121 (5th Cir. 1976). \nA party seeking a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order must prove four elements: \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 12 of 15\n(1) โa substantial likelihood that the movant will prevail on the meritsโ; (2) โa substantial threat \nthat irreparable harm will result if the injunction is not grantedโ; (3) โthe threatened injury \noutweighs the threatened harm to the defendantโ; and (4) โgranting of the preliminary injunction \nwill not disserve the public interest.โ Clark v. Prichard, 812 F.2d 991, 993 (5th Cir. 1987) (citing \nCanal Auth. of the State of Fla. v. Callaway, 489 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1974)). \nSection 1983 imposes civil liability against any person, acting under color of State law, \nthat deprives any citizen or other person within the jurisdiction of the United States of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of this country. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nThe threshold inquiry in any Section 1983 action is the identification of a specific violation of a \nconstitutional right. See Manuel v. City of Joliet, Ill., 137 S. Ct. 911, 920 (2017); see also Baker v. \nMcCollan, 443 U.S. 137 (1979). The Fifth Circuit has repeatedly recognized that โ[t]he Fourteenth \nAmendment Due Process Clause is violated where a prisoner remains incarcerated after the legal \nauthority to hold him has expired.โ Hicks v. LeBlanc, 832 F. Appโx 836, 840 (5th Cir. 2020); see \nalso Douthit v. Jones, 619 F.2d 527, 532 (5th Cir. 1980) (โDetention of a prisoner thirty days \nbeyond the expiration of his sentence in the absence of a facially valid court order or warrant \nconstitutes a deprivation of due process.โ); Porter v. Epps, 659 F.3d 440, 445 (5th Cir. 2011) (โ[A] \njailer has a duty to ensure that inmates are timely released from prison.โ). \n2. Analysis \nConstruing Plaintiffโs allegations in the light most favorable to him and taking all facts \npleaded in the Complaint as true, the Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a plausible \nentitlement to the injunctive relief sought, based on the underlying Section 1983 action for \nDefendantsโ violations of the proposed classโs Fourteenth Amendment right to Due Process. \nSpecifically, Plaintiff has alleged enough facts to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 13 of 15\non the merits as to his Section 1983 claim that Defendants violated the Fourteenth Amendment by \nkeeping Plaintiff and the proposed class members in DOC custody beyond their legal release dates \nwithout justification for doing so. Plaintiff has also sufficiently alleged a substantial threat of \nirreparable harm if Defendants are not enjoined from continuing the unlawful acts alleged in the \nComplaint. Additionally, construing the Complaintโs allegations in Plaintiffโs favor, granting the \ninjunctive relief sought will subject Defendants to minimal harm, when weighed against the \nthreatened injury to Plaintiff and the proposed class. Finally, based on the allegations of the \nComplaint, Plaintiff has demonstrated that granting injunctive relief will not disserve the public \ninterest. In sum, the Court finds that, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, Plaintiff has satisfied his pleading \nrequirement under Rule 8 with respect to his request for injunctive relief. Therefore, the Court will \ndeny Defendantsโ motion as to Plaintiffโs request for injunctive relief. \nIV.  Leave to Amend \nโA  court  ordinarily  should  not  dismiss  the  complaint  except  after  affording  every \nopportunity to the plaintiff to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.โ JMCB, LLC v. \nBd. of Com. & Indus., No. 17-75, 2018 WL 11319077, at *6 (M.D. La. Aug. 23, 2018) (quoting \nByrd v. Bates, 220 F.2d 480, 482 (5th Cir. 1955)). The Fifth Circuit has further stated: \nIn view of the consequences of dismissal on the complaint alone, and the pull to \ndecide cases on the merits rather than on the sufficiency of pleadings, district courts \noften afford plaintiffs at least one opportunity to cure pleading deficiencies before \ndismissing a case, unless it is clear that the defects are incurable or the plaintiffs \nadvise the court that they are unwilling or unable to amend in a manner that will \navoid dismissal. \n \nGreat Plains Tr. Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 329 (5th Cir. 2002); \nsee also 5B Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 1357 \n(3d ed. 2016) (โA wise judicial practice (and one that is commonly followed) would be to allow at \nleast one amendment regardless of how unpromising the initial pleading appears because except \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 14 of 15\nin unusual circumstances it is unlikely that the district court will be able to determine conclusively \non the face of a defective pleading whether the plaintiff actually can state a claim for relief.โ). \n  Having carefully considered the matter, the Court will grant Plaintiff leave to amend to \ncure the deficiencies with respect to prescription.  The Court does so for a couple of reasons. \n First, it is possible that such issues can be cured, at least in part. Specifically, Plaintiff did \nnot raise the issue of tolling in response to the instant motion, and the Court can foresee this issue \narising for certain proposed class members (e.g., for those who may have been incompetent), if \nsuch individuals existed and if Plaintiff wanted to pursue claims on their behalf.  \nSecond, even if amendment were likely futile, the Court would still act in accordance with \nthe above โwise judicial practiceโ and grant Plaintiff another opportunity to plead these claims, \nparticularly since these claims have not been previously dismissed in response to a ruling by this \nCourt. See Jordan v. Gautreaux, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, No. 21-48, 2022 WL 895720, at *30 (M.D. \nLa. Mar. 25, 2022) (deGravelles, J.) (collecting cases from this division following this approach).  \nConsequently, those claims deemed prescribed will be dismissed without prejudice, and Plaintiff \nwill have an opportunity to cure the deficiencies. \nV.  Conclusion \nAccordingly, \nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(B)(6) (Doc. 17) filed \nby Defendants James LeBlanc and the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections is \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Defendantsโ motion seeking dismissal of claims on \nthe basis of prescription is GRANTED, and any such claims are DISMISSED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE. Plaintiff shall have twenty-eight (28) days to amend the operative complaint to \ncure the above deficiencies. Failure to do so will result in dismissal of his claims with prejudice. \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-00108-JWD-SDJ     Document 45    03/30/22   Page 15 of 15\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendantsโ motion is DENIED in all other respects. \nSigned in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on March 30, 2022. \n \n \n \nS\n \n \nJUDGE JOHN W. deGRAVELLES \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA \n \n15 \n ",

For years now, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (โthe \nDOCโ) has been unlawfully and knowingly overdetaining thousands of Louisiana residents in its \ncustody  every  year.  Defendant  James  LeBlanc,  Secretary  of  the  DOC,  has  known  about  this \nmisconduct since at least 2012.2 Secretary LeBlanc has admitted that the DOC is โlegally boundโ to \nrelease people on time, and he has admitted that the DOCโs chronic, unlawful overdetention is a \nโbig problem.โ3 Yet Secretary LeBlanc has done little to fix the big problem. \n2.  By overdetaining Louisianans as a matter of policy, the DOC is essentially usurping \nthe sentencing authority that rightfully belongs to the judiciary. Many of these people are sentenced \nby a court to โtime servedโ or an equivalent sentence that legally entitles them to immediate release \nfrom the moment they are sentenced. But they are not immediately released. Instead, as a standard \npractice, the DOC delays computation of release dates and, in the meantime, simply continues to \ndetain people who should be free. Many are forced to sit for weeks or even months with no idea of \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff files this amendment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(A), which \nprovides that a party may amend a pleading once as a matter of course within 21 days after serving \nit.  Plaintiff served his original complaint on the Defendant on April 28, 2020.   \n2 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45, 48-49.  \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 2 of 21\n \nwhen the DOC will get around to processing their paperwork and releasing them. The DOC, in \nother  words,  falsely  imprisons  thousands  of  people  every  year,  degrading  lives  and  creating \nuncertainty and misery for families across the state.  \n3.  Still, Secretary LeBlanc has not implemented any policy to ensure that the DOC \nstops overdetainingโand falsely imprisoningโLouisianans. Overdetention costs the state $2.8M \nper year,4 but Secretary LeBlanc has not attempted to reallocate that spending toward new measures \nto prevent the DOC from holding people past their legal release dates. Meanwhile, the DOC simply \npretends that overdetention is an acceptable part of a personโs sentence. \n4.  Named Plaintiff Brian Humphrey was a victim of the DOCโs misconduct. He seeks \nto represent a Class of all persons who have been sentenced to the custody of the DOC since April \n16, 2019, and who were entitled to release at the time of their sentencing, but who were released by \nthe DOC more than 48 hours past the time that they were sentenced. On behalf of the numerous \npeople subject to this unlawful practice, Mr. Humphrey seeks to have each putative class member \nrecover the damages they suffered from their false and unlawful overdetention.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This Court has original jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs federal claims pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343(a). It has jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยง  1367  because  those  claims  arise  from  the  same  events  and  are  part  of  the  same  case  and \ncontroversy as the federal claims.  \n6.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because Defendant resides in \nthis judicial district, and because a substantial part of the events giving rise to Plaintiffโs claims \noccurred in this judicial district. \n                                                                                                                                                             \n3 Id. at 41. \n4 Ex. 2, DOC Grant Application at 4. \n2 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 3 of 21\n \nPARTIES \n7.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey was eligible for immediate release upon his sentencing on \nApril 16, 2019,5 but the DOC did not release him from custody until May 13, 2019,6 the day that the \nDOC finally computed his release date and found him eligible for immediate release.7 The DOC did \nnot compute Mr. Humphreyโs release date or set him free until 17 days after the DOC received his \npaperwork from the Bossier Parish Sheriffโs Office on April 26, 2019, and 27 days after he was \nsentenced on April 16.8 \n8.  Defendant James LeBlanc is the Secretary of the DOC and its final policymaker. He \nis sued in his individual capacity.  He has served in that role since 2008. He is appointed by the \nLouisiana  governor  and  is  the  chief  executive  officer  for  the  DOC.  He  formulates  rules  and \nregulations for the DOC, and he determines policy regarding management, personnel, and total \noperations for the agency. He oversees the DOCโs central office and its field unit staff, who are \ncharged with carrying out the work of the agency and protecting the rights of all persons held in \nDOC custody. Secretary LeBlanc was aware of and consciously disregarded a substantial risk of \noverdetention to the putative Class. He was aware of the overdetention problem but failed to exert \nthe supervision necessary to end it. At all relevant times, Secretary LeBlanc has acted under color of \nlaw. He can be served at 504 Mayflower Street, Baton Rouge, LA 70802.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Plaintiff was Overdetained for 27 Days after Being Sentenced Only to the Time that \nHe Had Already Served in Jail \n9.  On April 16, 2019, the 26th Judicial District Court in Bossier Parish sentenced Mr. \nHumphrey to โ3 years hard labor in the Louisiana Department of Corrections.โ In issuing that \n                                                 \n5 Ex. 3, Humphrey Sentencing Minutes at 2. \n6 Ex. 4, Humphrey Certificate of Release. \n7 Ex. 5, Humphrey Release Date Computation Information. \n8 Ex. 6, Facsimile Transmittal Sheet. \n3 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 4 of 21\n \nsentence, however, the Court simultaneously gave Mr. Humphrey credit for the time he had already \nserved in jail, and ordered further that the sentence should โsuspend all but time served.โ9 In other \nwords, Mr. Humphreyโs sentencing judge gave him credit for the time he had served in jail, and \notherwise suspended his sentence. Thus, as of the date of his sentencing, Mr. Humphrey had served \nhis entire sentence. He should have been released immediately. \n10.  That did not happen. Instead, the Bossier Parish Sheriff took Mr. Humphrey back \ninto the jail. Then, on April 18, 2019, Mr. Humphrey was transported to Webster โ Bayou Dorcheat \nCorrectional Center Transitional Work Program, a DOC facility. There Mr. Humphrey, who by law \nshould have been a free man, waited in prison for weeks, until the DOC got around to reviewing his \npapers and finally released him.  \n11.  From the date of his sentencing on April 16, 2019, Mr. Humphrey was in the \ncustody of the DOC. On information and belief, during the first ten days of Mr. Humphreyโs \ncustody, the DOC made no attempt to determine whether it had any legal right to imprison him. \n12.  Then, on April 26, 2019, the Bossier Sheriffโs Office sent to the DOC paperwork \nthat the Sheriff had received from the Clerk of Court of the 26th Judicial District. This paperwork \ncontained a note that read โ3 years HC DOC all but time served suspended.โ10 Mr. Humphreyโs \nUniform Sentencing Commitment Order notes โ0โ years, โ0โ months, and โ0โ days under โAmount \nof Time in DPS&C custody.โ11 Also on April 26, 2019, the Bossier Sheriffโs Office faxed 14 pages \nof โpre-classโ information on Mr. Humphrey to the Bayou Dorcheat Correctional Center,12 where \nMr. Humphrey was being held in DOC custody. \n13.  This paperwork made plain that Mr. Humphrey should have been a free man already, \nand that the DOC had no right to detain him. But the DOC did not release him. Instead, with the \n                                                 \n9 Ex. 3, Humphrey Sentencing Minutes at 2. \n10 Ex. 7, Humphrey DOC Basic Information Interview for Local Jail Facilities. \n11 Ex. 8, Humphrey Uniform Sentencing Commitment Order. \n4 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 5 of 21\n \npaperwork in hand, the DOC waited more than two weeks to determine whether it had any \nauthority to imprison Mr. Humphrey at all. \n14.  On May 13, 2019, the DOC completed Mr. Humphreyโs time computation, resulting \nin a calculation of 0 days.13 Mr. Humphreyโs โmust serveโ time was calculated to be -114 days.14 Any \nperson whose โmust serveโ comes to a negative number is eligible for immediate release.15 \n15.  That same day, May 13, 2019, the DOC issued a โCertificate of Releaseโ for Mr. \nHumphrey certifying his โCompletion of Sentence.โ16 \n16.  Mr. Humphrey was released from DOC custody on May 13, 2019, at 5:30 PM, 27 \ndays after he was entitled for immediate release upon his sentencing and 17 days after the DOC \nreceived his paperwork from the Bossier Sheriffโs Office. \nII.  The DOC Has a Pattern and Practice of Overdetaining People in Its Custody \n17.  Mr. Humphreyโs case was not an aberrationโto the contrary, his false imprisonment \nthrough overdetention is the standard practice of the DOC, a standard practice that Defendant \nLeBlanc has known about for at least eight years, yet has failed to change.  \n18.  The DOC has no process in place for ensuring that persons entitled to immediate \nrelease  upon  sentencing  are  actually  released  upon  sentencing,  or  any  time  quickly  thereafter. \nInstead, the DOC detains such people for weeks and even months with no idea whether it has a \nlegal right to imprison them at all. For the DOC, such determinations are made in an unhurried \nprocess in which the agency (1) waits days or weeks for others to provide it with the personโs \nsentencing order, and then (2) waits weeks to actually examine that sentencing order and determine \nwhether the DOC has the legal authority to detain the person. During all that time, the person who \n                                                                                                                                                             \n12 Ex. 6, Facsimile Transmittal Sheet. \n13 Ex. 5, Humphrey Release Date Computation Information. \n14 Ex. 9, Humphrey Time Computation and Jail Credits. \n15 Ex. 10, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (Jan. 10, 2020) at 87. \n16 Ex. 4, Humphrey Certificate of Release. \n5 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 6 of 21\n \nshould  be  freeโwhom  a  judge  has  already  deemed  eligible  for  immediate  releaseโlanguishes \nbehind bars. Thousands of people in Louisiana suffer this fate every year. \n19.  To make matters worse, the leadership of the DOC, including Defendant LeBlanc, \nhave been acutely aware of this problem since at least 2012. And after making half-hearted efforts to \nmitigate the problem, they have shifted instead to justify and normalize the false imprisonment of \nthousands of Louisianans every year. \nA.  The  DOC  Detains  Thousands  of  People  Past  Their  Legal  Release  Dates \nEvery Year  \n20.  The DOC recognizes that a person who (1) has spent time in custody pretrial, (2) is \ngiven a sentence with credit for time served, and (3) has a sentence that is less than or equal to their \nperiod of pretrial custody is entitled to release on the day of their sentencing.17 For example, a \nperson who spent two months in jail awaiting sentencing, and is then sentenced to thirty days with \ncredit for time served, is entitled to release on the day of his sentencing.  \n21.  The DOC is responsible for a personโs overdetention from the day of sentencing, \neven if the person is not yet in a DOC facility. The DOC has conceded that a personโs โadmit dateโ \nto DOC custody is the date of that personโs sentencing.18  Indeed, Secretary LeBlanc has explained \nthat he is โresponsible for the inmates sentenced to the custody of the DOC,โ whether they are in โa \nstate-run facility, a parish-run facility, or private-facility.โ19 \n22.  Any person who is detained past his or her legal release date is overdetained. The \nDOC admits that it is โlegally bound to release inmates on their release date.โ20  Secretary LeBlanc \nhas stated that he first learned โthat thousands of people in the custody of the Department of \n                                                 \n17 See Ex. 11, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 30-31. \n18 Ex. 12, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Melanie Gueho at 53. \n19 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 13. \n20 Id. at 15. \n6 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 7 of 21\n \nCorrections for whatever reason were being held past their release dateโ in 2012.21 But every \ninvestigation into the matter since that time has confirmed that the problem continues; indeed it has \neven come to the attention of judges and legislators. \n23.  In 2012, a team of DOC staff performed a review of its time calculation processes, \nwhich revealed a widespread pattern of people being held past their legal release dates. Specifically, \nthe investigation found that when the DOC calculated the release dates of inmates, 83% were \neligible for โimmediate release . . . due to an earlier release date.โ22 The DOC learned through this \ninvestigation that it  was overdetaining over 2,000 people each year, with an average of 71.69 \nโoverdue daysโ per person who was overdetained.23 The DOC has admitted that this is โa lot of \noverdetention.โ24 \n24.  The 2012 review found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the \nDOC to receive documents from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and the remainder was caused by \nthe DOC itself taking an average of approximately 79 days to calculate sentences after it had the \nsentencing documents in hand.25 \n25.  These 2012 findings should have set off alarm bells. Under Louisiana law, confining \nany person without legal authority amounts to false imprisonment. Under settled decisions by the \nUnited States Supreme Court, meanwhile, correctional facilities are allowed some time to ensure that \nan imprisoned personโs release is administratively proper, but in all events, it is presumptively \nunreasonable to imprison a person for more than 48 hours after they are entitled to release.26 The \n                                                 \n21 Id. at 48. \n22 Ex. 13, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 4. \n23 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 20. \n24 Ex. 15, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker at 33. \n25 Id.

McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991). \n7 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 8 of 21\n \nDOCโs imprisonment of people for months after they are entitled to release flagrantly violates the \nlaws of Louisiana and the United States. \n26.  No such alarm was raised, however. After making their 2012 findings, the DOC did \nnot  eliminate  or  even  meaningfully  mitigate  the  problem  of  overdetention.  Secretary  LeBlanc \nrecently testified that he understood that โpeople [are still] being held [in DOC custody] an average \nof about two months past their release date.โ27 \n27.  Indeed, five years after the 2012 investigation, in 2017, another internal investigation \nreported that the DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days past \nthe end of their sentence.โ28  So many people were being overdetained under this practice that it \ncost the state โ$2.8M per year in housing costs alone.โ29 According to the DOC, this is โtaxpayer \nmoneyโ that the โDOC should not have to spendโ on people whose sentences are complete.30 \n28.  But the 2017 investigation did not fix things either. As recently as 2019, the DOC \ncompiled a set of data and found that it had held 231 individuals past their legal release dates in a \nsingle month (February of 2019) for an average of 44 extra days.31 This suggests that over 2,000 \npeople per year are still being overdetained, seven years after the DOC first identified the problem. \n29.  The causes of this problem have been obvious since at least the 2012 investigation. \nThat inquiry found that some of the delay was caused by the time it took for the DOC to receive \ndocuments from the clerksโ and sheriffsโ offices, and then, even after receiving the sentencing \npapers, the DOC was taking an average of approximately 79 additional days to complete the process \n                                                 \n27 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 45. \n28 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38 (โQ.

As the DOCโs overdetention practices have continued, judges and state legislators \nhave periodically reminded Secretary LeBlanc of the problem. \n31.  On January 20, 2015, Judge Mary Doggett of the 9th Judicial District Court sent an \nemail that was forwarded to Secretary LeBlanc complaining that an individual had been held past his \nrelease date by nearly two months โin spite of several phone calls from Judge Randow for his \nrelease.โ34 \n32.  On January 28, 2016, a state legislatorโs office emailed Secretary LeBlanc regarding \nan individual who had obtained โan order of immediate releaseโ more than two weeks prior, and \nwas โstill being detained and has been given no explanation of the delay.โ35 \n33.  On February 21, 2019, Secretary LeBlanc received an email from Judge Jules D. \nEdwards of the 15th Judicial District Court to which Judge Edwards had attached three articles \nabout overdetention in Louisiana and information about a specific overdetained person. Judge \nEdwards added that โdefense attorneys in Lafayette are also complaining about the failure to timely \nrelease inmates from LPCC.โ Secretary LeBlancโs response indicated that he had read at least one of \nthe articles.36 \n                                                 \n32 Ex. 15, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Whittaker at 33. \n33 This number was obtained by calculating the average of the column โRECEIV TO COMPโ in \nEx. 16, Feb. Pull Doc. The โRECEIV TO COMPโ column provides, for each individual listed, the \nnumber of days that passed between the DOC receiving the personโs paperwork and the DOC \nbeginning the process of calculating the personโs time. \n34 Ex. 17, Secretary LeBlanc Emails 3-4 (Email from Mary Lauve Doggett, District Judge, 9th JDC, \nto Cole Gralapp, District Administrator, Probation and Parole (Jan. 20, 2015, 4:48 PM) (forwarded \nto James LeBlanc Jan. 23, 2015, 1:54 PM)). \n35 Id. at 10 (Email from the office of Chris Hazel, State Representative, House District No. 27, to \nJames LeBlanc, Secretary, DOC (Jan. 28, 2016, 9:44 AM)). \n36 Id. at 1-2 (Email from Jules D.

Secretary  LeBlanc  Has  Been  Deliberately  Indifferent  to  the  DOCโs \nOverdetention of Thousands of Louisianans \n34.  Multiple  investigations  since  2012,  and  repeated  attempts  to  intervene  by  other \nbranches of Louisiana government, have done little to change the DOCโs pattern of overdetention. \nThe DOC has been content to tinker around the edges of the problem, while doing little to actually \nreduce or eliminate the mass false incarceration it is committing. \n35.  Upon learning of the scale of its overdetention problem in 2012, the DOC did not \nset a goal of eliminating the problem. Rather, it set a goal to โ[r]educe the percentage of Immediate \nReleases by 80% (from 2252 to 450/yr)โ and to โ[r]educe the average number of days per case for \nimmediate releases from 71.69 days (non CTRP) to 31 days.โ37 \n36.  After learning that the DOC was still detaining people an average of about two \nmonths past their legal release dates even with the intervention resulting from the 2012 review in \nplace, Secretary LeBlanc did not fire anyone. He did not demote anyone. He did not dock anyoneโs \npay. He did not even reprimand anyone.38 He did not take any supervisory action to prevent his \nagency from continuing to detain people past their legal release dates. \n37.  Since that time, Secretary LeBlanc has not consulted with the heads of other statesโ \ndepartments of corrections about how they ensure that people are not detained past their legal \nrelease dates, aside from looking at some of the software that other states use.39 \n38.  Secretary LeBlanc has suggested that overdetention might be somewhat lessened in \nLouisiana if the DOC were to go and pick up the paperwork necessary to process release dates \n                                                 \n37 Ex. 13, DOC Lean Six Sigma 2012 PreClassification at 5. The DOC estimated that if it could \nachieve these goals of reducing the percentage of overdetained people by 80% and reducing the \naverage number of days of overdetention per person to 31 days, it could save the state $3.7 million \nper year.

Secretary LeBlanc has failed to adopt a policy proposed by a legislative auditor that \nwould impose a deadline on sheriffs to submit pre-classification packets to the DOC, despite his \nown admission that โthereโs no reason why [the DOC] couldnโtโ adopt such a policy and that he is \nโnot sure why we donโt, to be honest,โ and โwe could certainly, at least, make an attempt.โ41 \n40.  Secretary LeBlanc has not adopted any policy for the DOC requiring the immediate \ncalculation of sentences; instead, he has allowed sentences to be calculated in an ad hoc manner after \nthe DOC receives the relevant paperwork. \n41.  Further, the DOC has declined help when offered. In 2019, the executive director of \nthe Louisiana Clerks of Court Association, Debbie Hudnall, had a series of meetings with the DOC \nand Secretary LeBlanc. Ms. Hudnall suggested that, to speed things up, the Clerks of Court could \nbegin emailing sentencing documents to the DOC. The DOC declined, claiming that they โdonโt \nhave the capability of receiving that.โ42 \n42.  Aside from the specific investigations in 2012, 2017, and 2019, the DOC does not \neven keep a record or count of individuals who have been overdetained.43 \n                                                 \n40 Id. at 80, 100-01. \n41 See Crittindon v.

I mean, Iโm not sure why we donโt, to be honest with you.โ Secretary \nLeBlanc added: โIโm not sure that we could enforce it to begin with, but we could certainly, at least, \nmake an attempt.โโ) (emphasis in original). \n42 Testimony of Debbie Hudnall, Louisiana House of Representatives, Judiciary Committee, Jan. 15, \n2020, at 1:03:35, Available online at  \nhttp://house.louisiana.gov/H_Video/VideoArchivePlayer.aspx?v=house/2019/dec/1212_19_JU. \n43 See Ex. 11, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (May 31, 2019) at 29. \n11 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 12 of 21\n \n43.  Shockingly, the DOC has tried to frame overdetention as a component of a personโs \nsentence, stating that a personโs โsentence continuesโ past the legal release date ordered by a judge \nโuntil [the DOC does the personโs] time comp[utation] and release[s] him.โ44  \n44.  Indeed, the DOC has endorsed overdetention as a matter of policy.  \n45.  At least as late as May 2019, the DOC websiteโs โFrequently Asked Questionsโ page \nstated, โIf a person has recently been sentenced to DOC custody, it can take up to 12 weeks to \ncalculate a date as the Department has to receive official paperwork from the sentencing court in \norder to calculate the offenderโs release date.โ The DOC has since removed the reference to taking \nโup to 12 weeks to calculate a date,โ a timeframe even Secretary LeBlanc conceded was โridiculousโ \nand โabsurd.โ45 \n46.  The DOC also included an audio statement in its voicemail recording saying that it \nโtakes at least 90 days after sentencingโ for the department to calculate a personโs time. This \nstatement was finally removed from the voicemail recording in or around February or March of \n2019.46   \n47.  These voicemail and website statements reveal the scope of the DOCโs misconduct; \ntheir purpose was to discourage family members from โinundat[ing]โ the DOC with questions about \nwhen their loved onesโwho had been told by a judge that they were free to rejoin their familiesโ\nwould actually be released.47 \n48.  Mr. Humphrey is one of thousands of people who have been wrongfully imprisoned \nas a result of Secretary LeBlancโs demonstrated indifference to the DOCโs unlawful conduct. \n                                                 \n44 Ex. 10, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Angela Griffin (Jan. 10, 2020) at 36-39. \n45 Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 88-90. \n46 See Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 12-13. \n47 See Ex. 1, Dep. of Secretary LeBlanc at 89; see also Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative \nDerek Ellis at 18. \n12 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 13 of 21\n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n49.  Named Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this action, on behalf of himself and all \nothers similarly situated, to assert the claims alleged in this Complaint on a common basis. \n50.  This action is brought and may properly be maintained as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because the questions of law or fact common \nto proposed class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and \na class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this \ncontroversy. \nI.  The Plaintiff Class \n51.  Named Plaintiff proposes a class defined as: all persons who have been sentenced to \nthe custody of the DOC since April 16, 2019, and who were entitled to release at the time of their \nsentencing, but who were released by the DOC more than 48 hours past the time that they were \nsentenced. The Class seeks to recover damages for the injuries caused to each class member by this \noverdetention and false imprisonment. \nII.  Rule 23(a) \n52.  The proposed class satisfies the numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \nrequirements of Rule 23(a). \nA.  Numerosity โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) \n53.  The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The most \nrecent overdetention data from the DOC (from February of 2019) shows that over 200 individuals \nwere overdetained in a single month, suggesting that the DOC overdetains over 2,000 individuals \nover the course of a year. This 2019 count was consistent with data from 2017, which showed that \n13 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 14 of 21\n \nthe DOC had โan average of 200 inmates per month held . . . past the end of their sentence.โ48 \nUpon information and belief, the DOC has not implemented any major changes that might have \nsignificantly mitigated the rate of overdetention that was captured in the February 2019 snapshot. \nPlaintiff therefore estimates a class size of over 2,000 members. \nB.  Commonality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) \n54.  All members of the proposed Class are subject to the same systemic unconstitutional \npolicies, acts, and omissions on the part of Defendant described in this Complaint, and all have \nsuffered or will suffer violations of their constitutional rights and their rights under state law as a \nresult of the DOCโs pattern and practice of overdetaining people in its custody. \n55.  There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the class. \n56.  Questions of law that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \n๏ท  Whether the DOC had, or has, the legal authority to hold class members past their \nsentencing dates under the United States Constitution; \n๏ท  Whether Class Members had, or have, a liberty interest in their immediate release \nupon sentencing under the United States Constitution; \n๏ท  Whether Defendantโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention \nconstitutes deliberate indifference; \n๏ท  Whether the DOC had, or has, the legal authority to hold class members past their \nsentencing dates under the Louisiana Constitution; \n๏ท  Whether Class Members had, or have, a liberty interest in their immediate release \nupon sentencing under the Louisiana Constitution; and \n๏ท  Whether  the  DOCโs  detention  of  Class  Members  past  their  legal  release  dates \nconstitutes false imprisonment under state law. \n \n57.  Questions of fact that are common to all members of the class include, but are not \nlimited to: \n๏ท  Whether the DOC has a pattern of overdetaining people in its custody; \n๏ท  Whether Defendant is aware of the DOCโs pattern of overdetaining people;  \n                                                 \n48 Ex. 14, Dep. of DOC 30(b)(6) Representative Derek Ellis at 38 (โQ. So itโs a true statement that \nthe DOC found that in 2017 it had an average of 200 inmates per month held an average of 49 days \npast the end of their sentence, correct? A. Yes.โ). \n14 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 15 of 21\n \n๏ท  Whether the DOC is responsible for people sentenced to DOC custody from the \nday they are sentenced; and \n๏ท  Whether Defendant failed to adopt a policy or policies to mitigate overdetention. \n \n58.  Defendant is expected to raise common defenses to these claims, including denying \nthat his actions violate the law. \nC.  Typicality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n59.  Named Plaintiffโs claims are typical of those of the Class, as his claims arise from the \nsame policies, practices, or courses of conduct as those of the Class, and his claims are based on the \nsame  theories  of  law  as  the  Classโs  claims.  Named  Plaintiff  Brian  Humphrey  was  eligible  for \nimmediate release upon his sentencing, and the DOC held him in custody past his sentencing date. \nMr.  Humphrey  is  therefore  typical  of  the  putative  Class,  and  he  suffered  the  same  injury  of \noverdetention described in this Complaint.  \nD.  Adequacy โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n60.  Named Plaintiff is an adequate representative of the Class because his interests in the \nvindication of the legal claims that he raises are entirely aligned with the interests of the other Class \nMembers, who each have the same basic constitutional claims. Named Plaintiff is a member of the \nClass, and his interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the other Class Members. \n61.  There are no known conflicts of interest among Class Members, all of whom have a \nsimilar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights. \n62.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Promise of Justice Initiative, Loevy \nand Loevy, and the Law Office of William Most, who have experience in litigating complex civil \nrights matters related to prisonersโ rights in federal court and extensive knowledge of both the \ndetails of the DOC and the relevant constitutional and statutory law. The Law Office of William \nMost has litigated a number of individual overdetention cases in Louisiana. \n15 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 16 of 21\n \n63.  Class counsel have a detailed understanding of local law and practices as they relate \nto federal constitutional requirements. \nIII.  Rule 23(b)(3) \n64.  Class action status is appropriate because the questions of law or fact common to \nClass Members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and a class \naction is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this controversy. \n65.  The question of Defendantโs longstanding indifference to policies that result in mass \noverdetention, and the mass overdetention that results from this indifference, predominates over \nany individualized issues related to the claims of individual Class Members. The issue of Defendantโs \nliability is common across the Class and will predominate over any unique or personal issues. \n66.  A class action is the superior form of adjudication of the claims alleged in this \nComplaint because most of the proposed Class Membersโ claims are negative value suits; for many \nMembers of the putative Class, the damages at stake are too slight to repay the cost of an individual \nsuit. Class Membersโ interests in individually controlling separate actions against Defendant for their \noverdetention is therefore low. Moreover, no unusual difficulties are likely to be encountered in the \nmanagement of this class action. \n67.  Even  if  Class  Members  could  afford  to  litigate  their  claims  individually, \nindividualized litigation creates a potential for inconsistent or contradictory judgments and increases \ndelay and expense to all parties and to the courts. By contrast, the class action device presents far \nfewer management difficulties and provides the benefits of a single adjudication, economy of scale, \nand comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n16 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 17 of 21\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n68.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n69.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n70.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution is violated where a person remains incarcerated after the legal authority to hold that \nperson has expired.49 No privilege enables a jailor to detain a person beyond the period of that \npersonโs lawful sentence.50 \n71.  The DOCโs legal authority to detain Plaintiff Brian Humphrey expired on the day of \nhis sentencing, April 16, 2019. Yet pursuant to an unlawful, standard practice that has existed for \nyears, the DOC nevertheless continued detaining Plaintiff for nearly a month before attempting to \ndetermine whether it had any legal authority to imprison him. \n72.  The DOC falsely imprisoned Plaintiff pursuant to a practice that has existed for \nyears in which it waits weeks and even months to determine whether it has lawful authority to \nimprison persons who in fact were entitled to release on the day of their sentences. That practice \ninjured the thousands of members of the putative class, as described in this Complaint. \n73.  Defendant LeBlanc has been aware of this practice since at least 2012, but he has not \nattempted to stop it; instead the agency Defendant oversees has attempted to normalize its own \nmisconduct.  \n                                                 \n49 See Douthit v.

Secretary LeBlancโs failure to adopt a policy or policies to prevent overdetention is \nโdeliberately indifferentโ because โit is obvious that the likely consequences of not adopting a policy \nwill be a deprivation of constitutional rights.โ51 \n75.  In failing to adopt any policy to prevent predictable overdetention, Secretary LeBlanc \nacted with deliberate indifference. This is evidenced by the fact that every investigation into the \nmatter since 2012 has shown that overdetention is a persistent and widespread problem in Louisiana, \nyet Secretary LeBlanc did not create any policy to attempt to remedy the problem. \n76.  Through his deliberate indifference, Secretary LeBlanc deprived Mr. Humphrey, and \nall Members of the putative Class he seeks to represent, of the fundamental right to liberty and \nviolated their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, causing the injuries described in \nthis Complaint. \nCOUNT II \nDue Process under Article I, Section 2 of the Louisiana Constitution \n77.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n78.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n79.  Article One, Section Two of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 guarantees that \nโ[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, except by due process of law.โ  \n80.  By reason of the same conduct that violated Plaintiffโs federal constitutional rights, \nDefendant violated Plaintiffโs state constitutional rights to liberty and due process, as well as the \nstate constitutional rights of the putative class he seeks to represent, causing the injuries described in \nthis Complaint. \n                                                 \n51 Rhyne v. Henderson Cnty., 973 F.2d 386, 392 (5th Cir. 1992). \n18 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 19 of 21\n \nCOUNT III \nFalse Imprisonment under State Law \n81.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n82.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n83.  Defendant committed the tort of false imprisonment against Plaintiff when the \nDOC โrestrain[ed] [Plaintiff] against his will without a warrant or other statutory authorityโ52 for 27 \ndays  beyond  Plaintiffโs  legal  release  date.  By  definition,  the  Class  Members  Plaintiff  seeks  to \nrepresent were also falsely imprisoned by Defendant when they were unlawfully detained beyond \ntheir legal release dates, causing the injuries described in this Complaint. \nCOUNT IV \nState Law Negligence \n84.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n85.  Plaintiff Brian Humphrey brings this claim on his own behalf and on behalf of the \nputative Class against Defendant. \n86.  Defendant owes duties to avoid overdetention to persons in DOC custody, including \nPlaintiff and the members of the putative Class.53 \n87.  These duties were breached by Defendantโs acts and omissions, including the failure \nto timely release Plaintiff and the putative Class Members. \n88.  The risks and harms that Defendant caused were within the scope of protection \nafforded by the duties he owed to Plaintiff and to the putative Class Members. \n                                                 \n52 Kyle v. City of New Orleans, 353 So.2d 969, 971 (La. 1977); see also Miller v. Desoto Regional Health Sys., \n128 So.3d 649, 655-56 (La. App. 3d Cir. 2013). \n19 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 20 of 21\n \n89.  As  a  result  of  Defendantโs  acts  and  omissions,  Plaintiff  and  the  putative  Class \nMembers suffered actual, foreseeable harm, as described in this Complaint. \nCOUNT V \nState Law Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n90.  Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth in this \nCount. \n91.  Defendant  Leblanc  has  acted  intentionally  or  recklessly  regarding  the  false \nimprisonment and overdetention of Mr. Humphrey and the Members of the putative Class. \n92.  Defendantโs conduct has been extreme and outrageous, and it has been rooted in an \nabuse of power and authority over the freedom of Mr. Humphrey and the Members of the putative \nClass. \n93.  Defendantโs misconduct has caused severe emotional distress, induced by weeks and \neven months of caging in crowded, dangerous jails and prisons of persons who were legally entitled \nto be free.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, Plaintiff Brian Humphrey requests that this Court enter judgment in his favor, \nand in favor of the putative class he seeks to represent, against Defendant James LeBlanc and order \nthe following relief: \n(a) An  order  and  judgment  awarding  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  to \nPlaintiff  and  to  the  members  of  the  putative  class  whom  Plaintiff  seeks  to \nrepresent; \n \n(b) An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and  \n \n(c) Any other relief this Court deems proper. \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \n53 Porter v. Epps, 659 F. 3d 440, 445 (5th Cir. 2011) (a jailor has โnot only the duty to protect a \nprisoner, but also the duty to effect his timely release.โ). \n20 \n\nCase 3:20-cv-00233-JWD-SDJ     Document 11    05/15/20   Page 21 of 21\n \nJURY DEMAND \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38, Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on \nall issues so triable. \n \nRespectfully submitted this 15th day of May, 2020. \n \n/s/ Mercedes Montagnes \nMercedes Montagnes, La.
