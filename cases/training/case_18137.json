    "summary": "<p>In this case, African&ndash;American women alleged that they were subjected to improper searches at customs in O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. The case was initially brought by a single plaintiff in October 1997. In May 1998, a class action complaint was filed with 18 named plaintiffs. In 1999, another case was filed by 38 African-American women. Although each case was filed separately, the claims were essentially identical. The plaintiffs alleged that employees of the U.S. Customs Service at Chicago&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hare International Airport discriminatorily selected them for nonroutine personal services. These searches were allegedly conducted without probable cause. The plaintiffs alleged that they were taken into small, windowless rooms and strip searched. The defendants then allegedly conducted body cavity searches by forcing the women to face a wall and bend over. Sometimes, the plaintiffs were allegedly transported to a hospital where they were x-rayed and forced to undergo a gynecological examination. The plaintiffs contended that they had not been informed of their rights and were held incommunicado. Customs maintained records of these searches and allegedly no contraband was ever found.</p>\r\n<p>The cases were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois before Judge William Hart. The claims varied slightly between the different cases. The individual named plaintiffs asserted four claims specific to their cases:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>An equal protection claim that Customs inspectors targeted African-American women for nonroutine person searches in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment;</li>\r\n<li>A Fourth Amendment claim that Customs inspectors lacked sufficient cause to seize, detain, and search plaintiffs;</li>\r\n<li>A Federal Tort Claims Act claim against the United States alleging that the conduct of individual defendants constituted false imprisonment, assault, and battery;</li>\r\n<li>A Fourth and Fifth Amendment claim that Customs inspectors denied due process by not obtaining judicial authorization for the searches and by holding plaintiffs in communicado.</li>\r\n<li>An allegation that the defendants violated the plaintiffs&rsquo; right to privacy by maintaining logs of who was searched.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>On behalf of a putative class of African-American women who were subjected to nonroutine personal searches at O&rsquo;Hare, the plaintiffs alleged five more claims:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>An equal protection claim that supervisory employees failed to take proper action to prevent the discriminatory selection of African-American women for nonroutine personal searches;</li>\r\n<li>A Fourth Amendment claim that supervisory Customs employees failed to take proper action to prevent or stop the illegal seizures, searches, and detentions;</li>\r\n<li>A Fourth and Fifth Amendment due process claim that supervisory Customs employees promulgated and executed a policy and practice allowing the Customs inspectors, on nothing more than alleged reasonable suspicion, to detain plaintiffs in communicado for an indefinite amount of time and conduct non-routine personal searches without judicial authorization;</li>\r\n<li>A claim that supervisory employees conspired together in violation of 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1985(3) to commit the allegedly unconstitutional searches;</li>\r\n<li>An Administrative Procedure Act claim alleging that the officials promulgated the aforementioned policy and practice.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The case was filed in the Northern District of Illinois and assigned to Judge William Hart. In October of 1997, an individual plaintiff brought this claim. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief on a class-wide basis, and the individual named plaintiffs also sought damages.</p>\r\n<p>That putative class action was voluntarily dismissed in July 1998, while the single plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Even after a third amended complaint was filed, Judge Hart denied class certification. 1999 WL 35307. No motion for class certification had ever been filed, so Judge Hart dismissed these claims without prejudice. In the same opinion, Judge Hart also dismissed the invasion of privacy claims because he found that the plaintiff&rsquo;s right to privacy was not violated by the defendants&rsquo; record-keeping.</p>\r\n<p>In April 1999, Judge Hart dismissed allegations against some defendants as barred under the statute of limitations. 1999 WL 258501. The parties continued to litigate and engaged in a variety of discovery disputes.</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, 2000, Judge Hart certified a class consisting of &ldquo;All African&ndash;American women who (a) after May 7, 1998 were and likely in the future will be or (b) will in the future be: subjected to nonroutine personal searches by United States Customs employees at O'Hare International Airport and who were or will be detained for 24 hours or less.&rdquo; 199 F.R.D. 228. Judge Hart also held that customs inspectors were entitled to qualified immunity for nonintrusive searches, but denied qualified immunity to officers who conducted intrusive searches without reasonable suspicion.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hart denied the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity for managerial employees on March 14, 20020. 225 F.Supp.2d 834. The defendants filed interlocutory appeals, and on January 21, 2004, the Seventh Circuit reversed the district court. The Seventh Circuit held that managerial employees were entitled to qualified immunity, unless plaintiffs could show that managers (who did not target or participate in the alleged searches) displayed deliberate indifference toward the complained-of discrimination. 355 F.3d 1021.</p>\r\n<p>On September 4, 2003,Judge Hart ruled on defendants' motion for summary judgment. 284 F.Supp.2d 1008. He held that at least some of the searches violated the Fourth Amendment, and also held that the plaintiffs had sufficiently showed that the defendants violated the equal protection rights of several plaintiffs. Judge Hart denied qualified immunity for the claims related to strip searches, but granted qualified immunity with regards to claims alleging that officers lacked sufficient cause for pat-down searches.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, on February 3, 2006, the parties settled for $1.93 million. Attorneys fees and costs were to be taken out of this lump sum.</p>",

The United States has sovereign immunity except to the extent \n  waived. For constitutional torts, damages claims against the United States must be made pursuant to the Federal \nTort Claims Act (โFTCAโ), 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1346, 2671โ80. See Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 20 (1980); Bagola v. Kindt, \n131 F.3d 632, 638 (7th Cir.1997); Sterling v. United States, 85 F.3d 1225, 1228โ29 (7th Cir.1996). There is no \nindication that plaintiffs intend to bring an FTCA claim against the United States. The Administrative Procedures Act, \n5 U.S.C. ยง 702, may waive immunity for the declaratory and injunctive relief. See Czerkies v. United States \nDepartment of Labor, 73 F.3d 1435, 1437โ38 (7th Cir.1996). This issue need not be resolved at the present time \nsince the United States does not move to dismiss the official capacity claims. However, because it goes to the courtโs \njurisdiction, see Amwest Surety Insurance Co. v. United States, 28 F.3d 690, 693 (7th Cir.1994), the parties will be \nrequired to address the issue. \n \n2  As to Martinia, if it is believed that she is competent to bring suit in her own name, she must (through counsel) bring \n  a motion setting forth the pertinent facts and law and requesting that she be permitted to continue this suit in her \nown name. \n \n3  Both in the complaint and additionally in their briefs, plaintiffs allege some of the evidence from which a \n  discriminatory intent can be inferred. Those allegations need not be recited here because, as is held below, the \ngeneral allegation of discriminatory intent is sufficient. \n \n4  One of plaintiffโs supervisors forcibly touched plaintiffโs breasts, kissed her, and, on three occasions, forced her to \n  perform oral sex on him. \n \n5  Apparently all other circuits that have decided the issue disagree.

However, after these \n  motions became fully briefed, defendants brought a separate summary judgment motion as to Count VIII. That \nmotion is still being briefed. \n \n13  Managerial Defendants Raymond Kelly, Margaret Fearon, and Robert Parsons also joined in the initial motion for \n23 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 225 F.Supp.2d 834 (2002)   \n \n \n  summary judgment. In their answer to the motion, plaintiffs conceded the claims against these defendants should \nbe dismissed and plaintiffsโ motion to voluntarily dismiss these three defendants was subsequently granted. See \nOrder dated Feb. 15, 2002 [Docket Entry 335]. \n \n14  Noonan also filed a short brief and statement of facts. \n   \n15  The parties do not specifically identify the selected searches. Presumably, such claims would be contained in Counts \n  I III, and VI, which are against those defendants directly involved in searches. \n \n16  Although  they  did  not  file  a  separate  motion,  defendants  contend  certain  portions  of  plaintiffsโ  Local  Rule \n  56.1(b)(3)(B) statement [Docket Entry 316] should be stricken because not supported by admissible evidence and \nbecause they contain arguments, not just factual assertions. Plaintiffsโ statement will not be stricken. The only facts \nthat will be considered are those adequately supported by admissible evidence. \n \n17  In footnote 2 of their motion to strike [Docket Entry 330], plaintiffs refer to the possibility of filing an additional \n  surreply addressing the particular facts regarding each plaintiffโs search. That aspect of the motion will be denied. \n \n18  In  their  Local  Rule  56.1(b)(3)(B)  statement,  plaintiffs  provide  some  evidence  regarding  job  duties  and \n  responsibilities. \n \n19  Neither the affidavits nor Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) statements deny that there was a custom or practice of conducting \n  nonroutine searches without adequate suspicion. \n \n20  Paragraphs 16 through 20 of defendantsโ Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) statement are on a separate page. Plaintiffsโ Local \n  Rule 56.1(b)(3)(A) statement [Docket Entry 316] does not respond to these paragraphs. The failure to respond \napparently was an oversight (or possibly the result of a missing page) and will not be deemed an admission that the \nfacts in those paragraphs are uncontested. See Loc. R. 56.1(b)(3)(B). \n \n21  In their Local Rule 56.1(a) reply, defendants provide some additional factual assertions and evidence. They still do \n  not point to evidence regarding the searches of each plaintiff. \n \n22  All defendants except Noonan are represented by the same attorneys. \n   \n23  It is possible that a Managerial Defendantโs conduct could still have had an effect for a period of time after he left \n  the position. See, e.g., Shaw v. Stroud, 13 F.3d 791, 800 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 813, 814, 115 S.Ct. 67, 130 \nL.Ed.2d 24 (1994). Also, although specific causal issues are not being considered because not adequately raised, it \ncan be held that a Managerial Defendant will not be liable for searches that occurred prior to the Managerial \nDefendant first engaging in conduct that facilitated, encouraged, or deliberately ignored unlawful searches. \n \n24  Just as defendants failed to adequately raise the issue of whether the particular search of each plaintiff was racially \n  motivated and/or based on less than reasonable suspicion, qualified immunity cannot be based on any possible lack \nof clearly established law regarding a particular search. \n \n25  There is nothing to indicate that OโHare is part of the Great Lakes Customs Center. \n   \n26  The personal search reports often had incomplete data. For example, 23% of the reports did not contain race data, \n  1% did not have gender data, and 21% did not have citizenship data. However, GAO concluded that the data was \nsufficient to conduct multivariate analysis. See GAO Report at 10 n. 7. See also id. at 39โ40. On defendantsโ \n24 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 225 F.Supp.2d 834 (2002)   \n \n \nsummary judgment motion, it must be taken as true that the data was sufficient. \n \n27  The GAO Report does not provide any statistics comparing those selected for searches to the general population of \n  arriving international air passengers. The โraceโ categorization employed in the GAO Report actually mixes race and \nethnicity, categorizing passengers as White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American. There were too few Native \nAmericans to conduct a separate analysis for that category. \n \n28  White women and White men were strip searched at the same rate, 8.21%. \n   \n29  For each category of search, the GAO Report does not provide separate data as to citizens and noncitizens. \n  However, it provides that data for all searches. The positive rate for United States citizens is 5.8%, for noncitizens \n3.49%, and for those with no available citizenship data 3.9%. GAO Report at 42. If this pattern applies within each \ncategory of search, the positive results for United States citizens would be higher than the percentage for all \npassengers recited in the text. \n \n30  No evidence is presented of a discriminatory effect in the selection of AfricanโAmerican women for patdown \n  searches. There is no data in any of the reports comparing the percentage of AfricanโAmerican women on inbound \nflights or inbound flights from source countries to the percentage of AfricanโAmerican women selected for \nsecondary searches, all types of personal searches, or patdown searches. The comparative data only goes to \nselection for strip searches and X-ray examinations, by comparing the percentage of AfricanโAmerican women \nselected for those procedures to their presence in the pool of personal searches. \n \n31  The document does not define the distinction between Category 1 and Category 2 violations. \n   \n32  The GAO Reportโs national statistics showed a positive search result in 4.25% of the personal searches conducted in \n  fiscal 1997โ98. Pl. Exh 16 at 40. \n \n33  Plaintiffs also point to training and evaluation documents that refer to profiling. The documents, however, are all \n  from 1990 or earlier and none of the documents refer to profiling based on race or gender. \n \n34  The email does not specify strip searches, but defendants do not dispute that it is referring to strip searches. See Pl. \n  Exh. 34; Def. Loc. R. 56.1(a) Reply ยถ 89. \n \n35  Feeโs email mentions narcotics seizures. He does not indicate whether or not other contraband was found on any of \n  the passengers. \n \n36  Hoteko and Weeks may also have been aware of the data on 1997 strip searches. Fee testified that Hoteko and \n  Weeks helped him compile the data. The testimony, though, is unclear as to whether they provided him with all the \nindividual search reports from which Fee or a subordinate compiled the data or if Hoteko, Weeks, and/or one of \ntheir subordinates compiled the data and forwarded the numbers to Fee. See Pl. Exh. 4, Fee Dep. at 73โ75. \n \n37  The data provided is actually for the four-month period beginning May 15, 1997 and is limited to negative searches. \n   \n38  Beginning in May 1999 reforms were instituted that were aimed at decreasing discrimination in selections for \n  personal searches, including September and/or November 1999 revisions to Customsโ Personal Search Handbook. \nPart of the September 1997 through April 2000 data is from the time period after the reforms began. \n \n39  The reference is to the data contained in Feeโs email. That email does not specify whether Fee is referring to fiscal \n25 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 225 F.Supp.2d 834 (2002)   \n \n \n  year 1997 (the government fiscal year ends on September 30) or calendar year 1997. \n \n40  Defendants admit that โnumerousโ named plaintiffs also verbally complained that their searches were because of \n  their race. See Def. Loc. R. 56.1(a) Reply ยถ 125. However, plaintiffsโ cited support (which omitted citations to specific \npages) only shows that one plaintiff complained to a supervisory Customs inspector immediately after the search, \nthough she did not specifically testify that she complained of racial discrimination (Phillips Dep. at 68โ71); one \nplaintiff complained she wanted to talk to a supervisor, but was not provided the opportunity (Chalk Dep. at 83โ84); \nand one plaintiff attempted to telephone in a complaint, but did not get through (ByrdโBrown Dep. at 59). It is also \nadmitted that, prior to 1999, Customs did not keep records of verbal complaints. \n \n41  The Exhibit contains multiple copies and multiple letters regarding each incident. As to one incoming flight, two \n  AfricanโAmerican male friends wrote separate letters complaining of both of them being searched. This will be \ncounted as a single incident for a total of 12 incidents or complaints. Contrary to defendantsโ contention, all the \nletters expressly or implicitly complain of racial discrimination and, even if the writer did not always identify his or \nher  race,  incident  reports  or  other  information  disclosed  the  complaining  passengerโs  race.  Plaintiffs  are \nadmonished that, if they again submit this type of exhibit, they must organize it better (for example, grouping \ntogether each complainantโs documents and ordering them chronologically), provide a summary of the exhibitโs \ncontents, and number the pages of the exhibit. \n \n42  Many of the complaints were forwarded by others, such as Congresspersons or, in one case, the Immigration and \n  Naturalization Service. \n \n43  Plaintiffs contend that Banks also received notice of at least one of the written complaints. If the court has missed \n  such notice or miscounted the number received by others, it is due to plaintiffsโ failure to organize Exh. 49 and \nprovide specific citations. There is also evidence that Noonan had responsibility for the investigation of most \npassenger complaints and that Hoteko and the Port Director would approve the response to the passenger. If the \ncomplaint was originally submitted to the national office, the response would also pass through Trotter. However, \nthree of the complaints were received after Weeks left Chicago and one before he was Port Director. Two of the \ncomplaints were received before Trotterโs tenure and one was received afterwards. Two of the complaints were \nreceived before Banks was Acting Commissioner and three afterwards. Only three of the complaints were received \nbefore Weise retired. \n \n44  Plaintiffs contend that Hoteko and Weeks failed to follow up on Feeโs decision to require weekly reports of \n  passenger complaints. That request, however, came in late April 1999, after all but one of the searches involved in \nthe present case. Moreover, Fee further testified that he soon determined that was an unrealistic expectation and \ninstead relied on periodic meetings with those from whom he had requested the weekly reports. \n \n45  There is evidence that Cornejo suggested the psychologist because of allegations Smith was harassing female \n  Customs inspectors. On defendantsโ summary judgment motions, however, it must be taken as true that Smith did \nnot engage in harassment and that Cornejo had an insufficient basis for suggesting consultation with a psychologist. \n \n46  Plaintiffs provide evidence of evaluation forms used in 1995 and earlier that included information on aggregate \n  seizures, but not search efficacy. \n \n47  There is no contention that there is any collateral estoppel effect from this case. \n   \n48  The court refers to a prior โlengthy orderโ ruling on summary judgment. Buritica, 8 F.Supp.2d at 1190. The summary \n  judgment ruling is not published and does not appear on Westlaw. According to Trotterโs memorandum, the case \n26 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 225 F.Supp.2d 834 (2002)   \n \n \ninvolved monitored bowel movements and settled after trial. Pl. Exh. 29 at 2. \n \n49  This is likely a reference to United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 \n  (1985). See also Anderson IV, 199 F.R.D. at 248โ50. \n \n50  In response to the summary judgment motion, there is no contention by plaintiffs that the then-existing Personal \n  Search Handbook contained unlawful standards. They do not refer to it as evidence of unlawful written policies. \n \n51  The GAO Report does not report whether attorneys were provided to advise Customs inspectors. \n   \n52  The Newsweek article from the October 1, 2001 issue at 61, actually refers to a decrease in โsearchesโ not a \n  decrease in invasive searches. โLast year, under the new system, Customs conducted 70 percent fewer searches \nthan it did in the late 1990s but increased its yield of illegal drugs and other contraband 25 percent.โ \n \n53  Defendants contend this data does not show a discriminatory effect because there is no population benchmark for \n  comparison.  As  discussed supra,  the  existence  of  discriminatory  selection  practices  is  not  at  issue,  but  the \nManagerial Defendantsโ knowledge of such practices is at issue. The question presently being considered is whether \nTrotter had knowledge to which he thereafter turned a blind eye. It can be inferred that a person would know that \nAfricanโAmerican women do not make up anywhere near 44% of the general population. The 44% figure would \nraise suspicions. While there could possibly be a nondiscriminatory explanation, there is no indication that Trotter \nwas already aware of such an explanation and he took no action to investigate further. Thus, it can reasonably be \ninferred that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the information that was provided to him. A reasonable trier of \nfact could also find otherwise. On defendantsโ summary judgment motions, however, the reasonable inference \nfavoring plaintiffs must be drawn. \n \n54  According to Pl. Exh. 77, six named plaintiffs were searched after July 21, 1998, though it might actually be only five. \n  (On Exhibit 77, Patricia Coleman is listed as July 1998, but the complaint specifies July 30, 1998. 7th Am. Compl. ยถ \n62. As to Iris Liddell, however, Exhibit 77 states August 1998, but plaintiffsโ more definite statement recites August \n27, 1996 as the date she was searched.) It is unknown whether any of these five or six plaintiffs were subjected to \nstrip searches, but the complaint generally alleges that they were and that fact is not at issue in the present \nmotions. See 7th Am. Compl. ยถ 118. See also Anderson I, 1999 WL 35307 at *4. \n \n55  Also, a claim cannot succeed that Noonanโs failure to adequately investigate a complaint about a particular search \n  makes him liable as to that particular search. Kernats v. OโSullivan, 35 F.3d 1171, 1182โ83 (7th Cir.1994); Boyd v. \nSnyder, 2002 WL 58802 *2 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 14, 2002). Instead, it must be shown that his deficient investigation or prior \nmisconduct  thereafter  facilitated  subsequent  searches  of  a  named  plaintiff  because  the  offending  Customs \ninspectors were not disciplined or otherwise restrained. \n \n56  Approximately half the named plaintiffs were searched during this time period. \n   \n57  Plaintiffs also contend that narcotics seized from airline passengers represent a minuscule portion of narcotics \n  seizures, with cargo seizures being where most narcotics are found. The evidence provided by plaintiffs does not \nadequately support this assertion. See Def. Loc. R. 56.1(a) Reply ยถ 30. \n \n58  The success rate may actually have been higher since this figure may not include seizures of contraband other than \n  narcotics. \n \n59  This includes all passengers. As is noted in ยง II(C) supra, the success rates may be higher for searches of United \n27 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 225 F.Supp.2d 834 (2002)   \n \n \n  States citizens. \n \n60  The incident log is Exh. 20 to Hotekoโs deposition, which is included in Pl. Exh. 2. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n ",

The counts can be divided into three categories, \nimmunity  for  intrusive  searches  without  reasonable \nnon-class  claims  based  directly  on  conduct  of \nsuspicion; (4) conclusory allegation of groping was not \nnonsupervisory Customs inspectors (Counts I, III, V, and \nsufficient to support claim; and (5) detailed allegation of \nVI);  class  claims  on  behalf  of  a  class  of \nintrusive search was sufficient to support claim. \nAfricanโAmerican  women  searched  at  OโHare  Airport \n  \nand against supervisory Customs employees (Counts II, \nMotions granted in part and denied in part. \nIV, VII, IX, and X); and a class claim for injunctive relief \n  \non behalf of a national class of air passengers (Count \nProcedural Posture(s): On Appeal; Motion to Dismiss; \nVIII). \nMotion for Summary Judgment; Motion to Dismiss for \n  \nFailure to State a Claim. \nCounts I, III, V, and VI are damages claims on behalf of \nthe named plaintiffs only.

Plaintiffs subsequently renewed their class allegations and moved for certification of the classes. \n \n4  The two named plaintiffs who were subjected to gynecological searches may have been subjected to an atypical \n  search.  Such  searches  may  also  distinguish  these  two  plaintiffs  because  their  claims  for  damages  may  be \nsubstantially higher than the claims of other plaintiffs. Whether the gynecological searches should be excluded from \nthe class claims, represent a separate subclass, or these two plaintiffs excluded from being class representatives \nneed not be decided at this point. See Joncek v. Local 714 International of Teamsters Health & Welfare Fund, 1999 \nWL 755051 *4 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 3, 1999); In re Discovery Zone Securities Litigation, 181 F.R.D. 582, 587 (N.D.Ill.1998); \nRozema v. Marshfield Clinic, 176 F.R.D. 295, 301 (W.D.Wis.1997); Merk v. Jewel Food Stores, 702 F.Supp. 1391, 1395 \n(N.D.Ill.1988). It would not preclude certifying a class based on the 83 other proposed representatives. \n \n5  One possible exception is those plaintiffs subjected to gynecological searches. See the preceding footnote. \n26 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. 228 (2000)   \n \n \n   \n6  Distinct from the issue of whether applying such a presumption is appropriate, defendants argue that, as to each \n  class member and each particular defendant, it must be shown that the particular defendant personally and directly \nparticipated in the decision to search that class member. It is true that personal involvement must be shown in \norder to hold the individual defendants liable for damages. Del Raine v. Williford, 32 F.3d 1024, 1052 (7th Cir.1994). \nHowever, โ[a] superior may be personally involved by formulating and directing an unconstitutional policy, Rascon v. \nHardiman, 803 F.2d 269, 274 (7th Cir.1986), or by knowing about unconstitutional โconduct and facilitate it, approve \nit, condone it, or turn a blind eye for fear of what they might see. They must in other words act either knowingly or \nwith deliberate, reckless indifference.โ Jones [v. City of Chicago], 856 F.2d [985,] 992 [ (7th Cir.1988) ].โ Id. Accord \nMiller v. Velasco, 1999 WL 529562 *5 (N.D.Ill. July 19, 1999); Sylwestrowicz v. Todd, 1995 WL 519769 *2 (N.D.Ind. \nAug. 10, 1995). See also KitzmanโKelley v. Warner, 203 F.3d 454, 458โ60 (7th Cir.2000). \n \n7  Likely, this would not be precisely the same question as whether sufficient cause or suspicion existed to satisfy the \n  constitutional requirements for a nonroutine search. Presumably, because of the limited number of Customs \ninspectors, not every one who can constitutionally be searched is actually searched. The question here would be \nwhether plaintiff would actually have been selected for a search regardless of her race and gender, not whether she \nlegally could have been selected. \n \n8  Wilson does not explain how determinations would be made of who belonged in the class. \n   \n9  For the reasons set forth in ยง II(B) infra, unnamed class members who were detained for more than 24 hours will be \n  excluded from all the classes. \n \n10  In a prior ruling, it was found that at least some of the named plaintiffs have standing to seek prospective relief. See \n  Anderson v. Cornejo, 1999 WL 258501 *1โ2 (N.D. Ill. April 21, 1999) (โAnderson IIโ). \n \n11  One case (Chalk) containing class allegations was voluntarily dismissed in favor of consolidation into the Anderson \n  case which, by that time, also included class allegations. In Anderson II, it was indicated that the tolling continued \nduring the pendency of both cases and did not end when Chalk was voluntarily dismissed. However, it was expressly \nstated that, for purposes of the issues then before the court, it was unnecessary to resolve that question. Anderson \nII, 1999 WL 258501 at *4, *5. \n \n12  No opinion is being expressed regarding whether past practices are relevant to proving present practices. \n   \n13  Since at least some named plaintiffs are likely to be subjected to future nonroutine searches and no named plaintiff \n  has been identified as being an inadequate class representative, it is unnecessary to determine which particular \nnamed plaintiffs fall within the class. \n \n14  As is discussed below in ยง II(B), Counts VII and VIII will be dismissed in their entirety. Absent a subsequent reversal, \n  defendants, who opposed class certification, will be the beneficiaries of certification of those counts. The parties, in \ntheir discussions, shall consider whether they can agree that Counts VII and/or VIII need not be certified. If the \nparties agree Count VII need not be certified as a class action, there would be no need for Rule 23(b)(3) notice. \n \n15  The Anderson defendants also moved to dismiss all the class counts because class certification had not yet been \n  requested. Plaintiffs subsequently moved for class certification and defendants did not repeat this argument in \nopposition to that motion. To the extent defendants still raise this argument, it is rejected. No prejudice has been \nshown by any delay and the delay was not unreasonable. Additionally, the argument does not apply to the Arnold \ncase, which was pending for a shorter period of time prior to class certification being requested. \n27 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. 228 (2000)   \n \n \n \n16  Citations to the Complaint are to the Sixth Amended Complaint filed in Anderson. \n   \n17  Plaintiffs contend that law of the case already establishes that they have sufficiently alleged procedural due process \n  claims. Previously, however, defendants only argued that the availability of a post-deprivation remedy precluded \nthe possibility of a Bivens damages claim. See Anderson I, 1999 WL 35307 at *5. The arguments raised in the present \nmotion regarding Counts VI, VII, and VIII are different and will be considered on their merits. Also, no prior ruling has \nbeen made in the Arnold case. \n \n18  The earliest search alleged in the two pending complaints is the July 10, 1996 search of Gina Phillips. \n   \n19  In their opening briefs, defendants contend this court lacks jurisdiction over the Count VIII APA claim. They appear \n  to have withdrawn this argument since they do not address it in their reply. In any event, it is held that federal \nquestion jurisdiction exists as to Count VIII. \n \n20  Plaintiffs refer to their allegation as being provided with no due process whatsoever and therefore as necessarily \n  being a constitutional violation as long as they allege a circumstance under which they are entitled to due process. \nFor there to be a deprivation of due process, however, there must be both a right to due process and a \nconstitutionally required procedure that was denied. In response to the motion to dismiss, the burden is on plaintiff \nto make legal arguments identifying what procedure was not provided. See Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 672, \n97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977); Alexander v. Board of Education of Indian Prairie School District No. 204, 1998 \nWL 699020 *4โ5 (N.D.Ill. Oct. 5, 1998); Duran v. City of New York, 1998 WL 603212 *12 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 1998). \nThe only procedures plaintiffs identify as being denied are the ones described in the text. \n \n21  When the law became clearly established would only be pertinent to qualified immunity for the damages claims \n  contained in Count VII. It is not pertinent to the Count VII claims for injunctive relief or Count VIII which does not \ncontain any damages claim. Burgess v. Lowery, 201 F.3d 942, 944 (7th Cir.2000); Canedy v. Boardman, 91 F.3d 30, 33 \n(7th Cir.1996). \n \n22  For purposes of Counts VII and VIII, which involve practices when at least reasonable suspicion is present, it is \n  unnecessary to consider whether some point less than reasonable suspicion would still be sufficient for a patdown \nsearch. That issue is addressed in ยง IV(A) infra. \n \n23  Even if a named plaintiff has previously been detained for more than 24 hours, she would lack standing to pursue \n  injunctive relief because there is no indication that such an occurrence is common enough that any named plaintiff \nis likely to be held for more than 24 hours following a future return trip to the United States. See Anderson II, 1999 \nWL 258501 at *1โ2. \n \n24  There is no contention by plaintiffs that the ยง 1986 claim relates back to the filing of the original complaint or an \n  earlier complaint. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2). \n \n25  Adopting this discovery rule is also supported by the fact that the limitation period for ยง 1986 is a short one, only \n  one year. Compare Rotella, 528 U.S. 549, 556โ58, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (inappropriate to prolong accrual \nof RICO limitation period until pattern discovered because it already has a lengthy limitation period [four years] and \na possibility of a 10โyear period for the pattern). \n \n26  In Anderson I, 1999 WL 35307 at *4, it was held that plaintiffs were required to provide a more definite statement \n  specifying the date of and the particular defendants alleged to have been involved in the specific search incident of \n28 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. 228 (2000)   \n \n \neach named plaintiff. Waugh is still listed as a plaintiff in the Sixth Amended Complaint. See Compl. caption & ยถ 21. \nSince  Waugh  is  not  included  in  plaintiffsโ  amended  more  definite  statement  filed  after  the  Sixth  Amended \nComplaint, her presently pending claims in the Sixth Amended Complaint apparently are the claims against the \nsupervisory Customs officials and the Count V FTCA claim. Other than the ยง 1986 timeliness issue discussed in ยง II(C) \nsupra, there apparently is no present dispute that Waughโs claims against the supervisory officials or the United \nStates are untimely. \n \n27  The motion was filed on August 10 and noticed for presentation on August 12. The court reset the presentation date \n  to August 18. \n \n28  Waugh does not move to reinstate her claim against defendant S. Papa. \n   \n29  The presently pending Sixth Amended Complaint was filed after plaintiffs answered the summary judgment motion, \n  but before defendants filed their reply. The reply also fails to specifically refer to the counts of the complaint. \n \n30  Defendants recently filed a document entitled โDefendantsโ Response to Plaintiffsโ Surreplies.โ Leave was not \n  requested to file it and it has not been considered. \n \n31  The Seventh Circuit reversed the district courtโs holding that reasonable suspicion did not exist to justify the partial \n  strip search that was conducted subsequent to the patdown search. Saffell III, 183 F.3d at 658โ59. \n \n32  The present discussion concerns what this court will call โstandard patdown searches.โ Below, โintrusive patdown \n  searchesโ will be distinguished. See ยงยง IV(C)โ(D) infra. \n \n33  Saffell I is the district courtโs ruling on summary judgment. For purposes of summary judgment, it was assumed to \n  be true that, during the patdown, the Customs inspector reached under Saffellโs bra and under her underwear, \nexamining Saffellโs entire pubic area and inserting her finger in Saffellโs vagina. Following the bench trial, the merits \nof the summary judgment ruling were not before the Seventh Circuit. Instead, different facts were before the \nSeventh Circuit based on the findings at the bench trial. The Seventh Circuit expressly noted that the case would \nhave been โmore difficultโ if the summary judgment facts had been before it. Saffell III, 183 F.3d at 657. \n \n34  Harris states โ4 to 6 times,โ but on defendantsโ summary judgment motion it must be assumed that it was six times. \n   \n1  Subsequent to Anderson IV, plaintiffs filed their Seventh Amended Complaint in the Anderson case. Anderson now \n  contains the claims of all plaintiffs, including those who were previously named in the Arnold and Jones cases. The \nArnold and Jones cases were thereafter dismissed without prejudice. The numbering of counts and the allegations in \nthe Seventh Amended Complaint are the same as in the complaints that were the subject of discussion in Anderson \nIV. \n \n2  As was noted in Anderson IV, 199 F.R.D. at 242 n. 8, the Wilson opinion does not explain how membership in the \n  class would be determined. \n \n3  Even if the clarification is inconsistent with the language of the complaint, it would be appropriate to permit an \n  amendment. \n \n4  Although plaintiffs raise this argument as to the summary judgment ruling, it would also apply to the partial \n  dismissal of Count VI, see Anderson IV, 199 F.R.D. at 247, and todayโs application of this holding to the Count VII \ndamages claim. \n29 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 199 F.R.D. 228 (2000)   \n \n \n \n5  For an explanation of the distinction between a standard and intrusive patdown search, see Anderson IV, 199 F.R.D. \n  at 258. \n \n6  No opinion is expressed regarding whether the contents of the Handbook are binding on the Customs Service or its \n  employees. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n30 \n ",

Compl. ยถ 51. Plaintiff Katherine Milner \ntestified she is a permanent resident. Compare Milner Dep. at 12 with 7th Am. Compl. ยถ 33. \n \n2  As required by Anderson I, 1999 WL 35307 at *4, 7, for the Fifth Amended Complaint and thereafter, plaintiffs have \n  provided a more definite statement listing the following information for each named plaintiff: (a) the date of the \nalleged unlawful search, (b) the known defendants alleged to have been involved in the unlawful search, and (c) \nwhether unknown defendants are also alleged to have been involved in the unlawful search. \n \n31 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 284 F.Supp.2d 1008 (2003)   \n \n \n3  By โnonroutine personal searches,โ plaintiffs mean patdown searches, strip searches, and visual and physical body \n  cavity searches generally conducted in an enclosed room, and also off-premises medical examinations (including \nX-rays) and monitored bowel movements. 7th Am. Compl. ยถ 113. This court has also distinguished โstandardโ and \nโintrusiveโ patdown searches. See Anderson IV, 199 F.R.D. at 258โ59. \n \n4  Although Count I, Count III (with the exception of one Supervisory Defendant), and Count VI refer to the actions of \n  Customs Inspectors, plaintiffsโ statements of more definite facts also identify Supervisory Defendants as being liable \nfor direct involvement in many of the searches. \n \n5  Count VI has been dismissed in part. See Anderson IV, 199 F.R.D. at 246โ47, 263. \n   \n6  High risk travel may also incorporate that it was a trip of short duration to and from a source country. \n   \n7  Plaintiffs also cite to the testimony of a sixth inspector, but the cited page of her transcript has not been provided. \n  See Pl. 56.1 Facts ยถ 222 (citing Def. Exh. 34, Diez Dep. at 112). \n \n8  Allenโs IOIL incorrectly indicates she was patted down and not strip searched. It also incorrectly indicates that the \n  date of the search was June 26, 1997. \n \n9  The IOIL lists Martinez as the primary officer, but a different Inspector actually questioned Allen first and referred \n  her to secondary. Priceโs testimony supports that Rocha was the one who initially questioned Allen and referred her \nto secondary. \n \n10  There is evidence that, as to at least five plaintiffs, Martinez claimed to have felt (or witnessed) something bulky in \n  each womanโs crotch area even though no bulkiness was there. \n \n11  Price only has one child, not โkidsโ as indicated on the IOIL. \n   \n12  The IOIL refers to Diez as the primary officer, but the evidence establishes that Jones was referred to secondary by \n  an Immigration officer. \n \n13  Mendenhall testified that the woman conducting the search appeared to be Hispanic. Neither side points to any \n  evidence regarding whether either Belcastro or Zitowsky appear to be Hispanic. In ยถ 97 of their Rule 56.1 Statement, \ndefendants recite who is listed on the IOIL without affirmatively stating that it is accurate. Plaintiffs respond that \nthey do not dispute that the IOIL is as described and further admit Belcastro actually was the searching officer and \nZitowsky actually was the witness. However, the next four paragraphs of defendantsโ statement state that Zitowsky \nwas the searching officer and plaintiffsโ admit that is true in their response to each of those statements. \n \n14  It would be a reasonable, but not necessary, inference that the searching officer asked this question because she \n  had felt something. On defendantsโ summary judgment motion, however, that inference will not be drawn because \nit is not the only possible inference and it does not favor plaintiff. \n \n15  The definitions of a standard patdown search and an intrusive patdown search are set forth in Anderson IV, 199 \n  F.R.D. at 258. \n \n16  Plaintiffs presently argue that Anderson IVโs qualified immunity holding as to when the some level of suspicion \n  standard for standard patdown searches was clearly established, see 199 F.R.D. at 256โ57, should be reconsidered \nin light of recent Supreme Court precedent regarding qualified immunity, see ยง IV(K)(1) infra, but they do not \n32 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 284 F.Supp.2d 1008 (2003)   \n \n \ndisagree as to what the current standard is. \n \n17  While a fact dispute may exist regarding whether Czech had an actual intelligence report, there is no evidence that \n  the other defendants knew the report lacked foundation. \n \n18  Even if it were held that reasonable suspicion did not exist because a bulge between a womanโs legs may often be a \n  sanitary pad and there were insufficient other indicia of narcotics smuggling, defendants would be entitled to \nqualified immunity from damages because there is no clearly established law that feeling a bulge between a \npassengerโs legs is an insufficient basis for searching further in order to confirm it is not contraband. \n \n19  Qualified immunity would not preclude an injunctive relief claim based on the patdown without adequate suspicion. \n  However, Jones has never traveled outside the United States other than this one trip so she would lack standing to \npursue injunctive relief. Compare Anderson II, 1999 258501 at *1โ2; Anderson IV, 199 F.R.D. at 244 & n. 10, 245 & n. \n13. \n \n20  The facts in the present case are distinguishable from Brent v. Ashley, 247 F.3d 1294, 1305โ06 (11th Cir.2001), and \n  Saffell I, 1998 WL 142372 at *8, which are cited by defendants. In those cases, the courts indicated that the \nwitnesses did not have the knowledge necessary to know that the search of the plaintiffs were without adequate \nsuspicion. \n \n21  The present record does not contain conclusive evidence that authorizing officer Desmond was falsely told \n  something was felt before approving each of these strip searches. Therefore, these claims as against Desmond will \nnot presently be dismissed. \n \n22  This qualified immunity ruling does not apply to the Count I and Count II equal protection claims. \n   \n23  No issue is raised regarding whether the strip searches qualify as a battery without any actual touching. See \n  Kraushaar, 45 F.3d at 1049โ50. \n \n24  The only false statement on Milnerโs IOIL is the description of her search as a patdown instead of a strip search. \n  That, however, does not go to the grounds for patting her down. \n \n25  There is also no evidence as to whether all other passengers on the same flight are the appropriate group to \n  compare. There is no evidence that one PAU officer considers possible lookouts for an entire flight. That is not the \nsituation as to Absolam, whose PAU lookout was issued almost a year prior to her departing and return flights. \n \n26  Also, since it cannot be shown that the PAU officer knew these plaintiffsโ race, a discriminatory animus cannot be \n  shown. \n \n27  Plaintiffs complain that the Customs Service destroyed international flight declaration cards from which information \n  about passengersโ race and gender might have been indirectly derived. Plaintiffs contend they could have used this \ninformation to prove that each of their flights had few AfricanโAmerican women. Plaintiffs request that such an \ninference be drawn based on the destruction of the declaration cards. No such inference need be drawn. Plaintiffsโ \nown testimony establishes the flights had few AfricanโAmericans, which would also mean few AfricanโAmerican \nwomen. \n \n28  In any event, as is discussed in ยง VI(C)(1)(b)(i) infra, the discriminatory effect requirement is satisfied as regards \n  Rocha being Priceโs searching officer and Rocha being Allenโs witness. \n33 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 284 F.Supp.2d 1008 (2003)   \n \n \n \n29  To the extent Reyther was also Milnerโs primary officer and questioned others on her flight, it could be found that \n  Reyther treated others outside the protected class more favorably than Milner. In any event, as is discussed in ยง \nVI(C)(1)(b)(i) infra, the discriminatory effects requirement is satisfied as to Milnerโs Count I claim against Reyther in \nher capacity as Milnerโs searching officer. \n \n30  Defendants also complain that plaintiffs use inbound search data only. That, however, is the type of searches at \n  issue. Searches of outbound passengers involve distinct smuggling and contraband issues and therefore are properly \nexcluded from the statistics being used. \n \n31  Banks generally would not have witnessed males, particularly ones who were stripped searched, though the records \n  indicate she witnessed the personal searches of five males, none of whom were strip searched. \n \n32  Martinez generally would not have personally searched males, particularly ones who were stripped search, but she \n  did pat down 2 White males and 1 AfricanโAmerican male, none of whom were subjected to an intrusive search. \n \n33  No statistics are provided as to Zitowsky acting as the searching officer. \n   \n34  The one exception is when Martinez acts as a witness, in which case AfricanโAmerican women are subjected to \n  intrusive searches at 182% of the rate for which White women are subjected to intrusive searches. \n \n35  The few exceptions involving less searches are Banks as a witness, Belcaster, and Reyther, particularly Reyther \n  where her having searched one less AfricanโAmerican women would have produced a lower intrusive search \npercentage than for White women. \n \n36  This would be particularly true of Banks who acted as a witness on some occasions, but also had supervisory \n  authority. \n \n37  The data is slightly distorted by including searches on outbound flights. That data, however, represents a small \n  portion of searches so it should not involve much distortion. \n \n38  On flights to or from other destinations, searches of AfricanโAmerican women, as represented by a proportion of \n  those searched, did decrease during the specified time period, but also thereafter as well. Before May 25, 1997, it \nwas 7.6%; May 25 through September 25, 1997, it was 6.6%; and after September 25, 1997, it was 5.6%. \n \n39  Although plaintiffs do not refer to it in their brief, Pl. Answer Brief at 49, their statement of fact and the pertinent \n  IOIL show Corona was the PAU lookout. In any event, for the reasons stated in the text, this complaint does not link \nNoonan to the conduct of any of the defendants that were the subject of the complaint. \n \n40  Although no discriminatory effect has been shown regarding Banks acting as an authorizing officer, a discriminatory \n  effect has been shown regarding her conduct as a witness. \n \n41  This evidence was also presented in response to the Managerial Defendantsโ summary judgment motion. See \n  Anderson VIII, 225 F.Supp.2d at 855โ56. \n \n42  This evidence is described in greater detail in Anderson VIII, 225 F.Supp.2d at 850โ51. It is from a Revised April 1999 \n  manual, but there is no contention that similar language did not exist in manuals in use when the defendants at \nissue were trained. \n34 \n \n\n \n \nAnderson v. Cornejo, 284 F.Supp.2d 1008 (2003)   \n \n \n \n43  It is unclear if this means these women never use sanitary pads or if it means that they use tampons alone at some \n  point during their periods, but may use sanitary pads at other points. It will be assumed that this means they never \nuse sanitary pads. \n \n44  As to the statistical evidence regarding Banks acting as a witness, it is also noted that the sample sizes may be too \n  small to draw a reasonable inference from the disparity that existed (3/28 and 1/49). \n \n45  The damages claims aspects of Counts III and VI that were previously dismissed on qualified immunity grounds \n  remain dismissed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n ",
