    "summary": "<p>This case is about the Trump Administration's amended Title IX regulations that reduced federal protections for students experiencing sexual harassment in public schools. On March 8, 2021, The Women’s Student Union (the Student Union)—a student organization at Berkeley High School—filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff sued the U.S. Department of Education under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Represented by the National Center for Youth Law and Public Justice, the plaintiff sought an injunction against, and vacatur of, the amended regulations. The plaintiff additionally sought declaratory relief and attorneys' fees. The case was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen.</p><p>In 2020, the U.S. Department of Education issued the amended regulations governing sexual assault under Title IX. The amended regulations varied from the previous regulations in several ways, including by restricting the definition of unlawful sexual harassment to conduct that is both severe and pervasive, excluding Title IX coverage for harassment occurring off campus, requiring school action only if the school has actual knowledge of the harassment, and holding a school liable only if it remains deliberately indifferent to the harassment. </p><p>In February 2021, the plaintiff had filed an administrative complaint against Berkeley Unified School District with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. The complaint alleged violations including unwelcome exposure to others’ genitalia, students’ circulation of sexualized images of a classmate, harassment occurring in Zoom breakout rooms, harassing messages sent through personal phones during class, and the presence of an informal club dedicated to sexually harassing students. In the lawsuit, the plaintiff asserted that the amended regulations would prohibit the Office for Civil Rights from opening the administrative complaint and investigating the alleged harassment, because that harassment no longer violated Title IX. The plaintiff argued the amended regulations therefore denied the Student Union its procedural right to have its administrative complaint investigated and frustrated the Student Union’s mission of reducing sexual harassment experienced by Berkeley High School students. The Department of Education had not yet opened the administrative complaint at the time the lawsuit was filed. </p><p>Texas filed a motion to intervene as a defendant on April 7, 2021, arguing that it needed to protect its interests as an education provider, and the plaintiff and defendant filed responses in opposition to the motion. Additionally, on May 24, 2021, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, Independent Women’s Law Center, and Speech First, Inc., filed a motion to intervene as defendants to allegedly protect their interests in safeguarding free speech and due process rights, and the plaintiff and defendant filed responses in opposition as well. </p><p>The defendant then sought to stay the case for sixty days while, under President Biden’s Executive Order, the Secretary of Education reviewed the amended regulations and considered whether they should be suspended, revised, or rescinded. Judge Chen denied the motion to stay on June 18, 2021, because the Department of Education would be unlikely to complete the review within sixty days and was not obligated to suspend, revise, or rescind the amended regulations at all. </p><p>On July 1, 2021, the Department of Education filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. Judge Chen granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend, because the plaintiff failed to show it suffered injury because of the amended regulations. The court rejected the plaintiff's associational and organizational standing theories. 2021 WL 3932000. As a result, the plaintiff filed a motion to amend the complaint on September 10, 2021, and Judge Chen granted the motion. </p><p>Accordingly, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 4, 2021, stating that although the Office for Civil Rights resolved 90% of claims within 180 days of receipt, the Office did not open the plaintiff's administrative complaint until 220 days after receipt. The plaintiff argued that this behavior supported the allegation that the Office for Civil Rights would not open the complaint, thus depriving the plaintiff of its procedural right to have its complaint opened and investigated. In addition to procedural injuries, the plaintiff asserted that the amended regulations reduced the number of sexual harassment incidents the high school investigated, injuring the plaintiff's members by creating a hostile school environment. </p><p>The case is ongoing. </p>",

See Docket \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  No. 1 (“Compl.”) ⁋ 8 (citing 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May 19, 2020) (codified at various places in 34 \n19  C.F.R. Pt. 106) (the “2020 Regulations”)).  Plaintiff alleges that the 2020 Regulations violate the \n20  Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C), because they are contrary to the \n21  text and purpose of Title IX.  Compl. ⁋ 84.   \n22  Pending before the Court is the Department’s motion to dismiss this action for lack of \n23  subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil \n24  Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), respectively.  See Docket No. 61 (“Mot”).  For the following \n25  reasons, the Court GRANTS the Department’s motion because Plaintiff lacks standing.1   \n26 \n27 \n \n1 Because the Court concludes that Plaintiff lacks standing, it need not address the Department’s \n28 \narguments that Plaintiff failed to plausibly state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 2 of 15\n \n1  I.  BACKGROUND \n2  A.  Title IX Enforcement Before the 2020 Regulations \n3  Title IX of the Education Amendments states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, \n4  on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n5  discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  20 \n6  U.S.C § 1681(a).  The statute defines “program or activity” as “all of the operations” of a school, \n7  “any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance.”  Id. § 1687.  Federal agencies that \n8  disburse funds to educational institutions—including the Department of Education—are \n9  “authorized and directed” by Congress to “effectuate the provisions of” Title IX “by issuing rules, \n10  regulations, or orders of general applicability.”  Id. § 1682.  These agencies can compel school \n11  districts to comply with the provisions of Title IX—and its implementing regulations—by \n12  threatening to withhold federal education funds from noncompliant school districts.  Id.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  There are two ways to enforce Title IX.  First, a plaintiff (usually a student) can sue a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  school for damages in federal court as Title IX provides a private right of action.  See \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Franklin v. Gwinnett Cnty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 76 (1992).  In such cases, however, students \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  can recover “only for harassment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it \nS d nr\nee 17  effectively bars the victim’s access to an educational opportunity or benefit,” and they must prove \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the school’s “deliberate indifference to known acts of harassment in its programs or \n19  activities.”  Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999).  This standard is met \n20  only if “an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to \n21  institute corrective measures on the recipient’s behalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in \n22  the recipient’s programs and fails adequately to respond.”  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n23  524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998).  This strict definition of sexual harassment and the requirements of \n24  actual knowledge and deliberate indifference are known as the “Gebser/Davis framework.”  85 \n25  Fed. Reg. at 30,032. \n26  Second, Title IX may be enforced administratively by the Department through the issuance \n27  of rules, regulations, and guidance documents.  See Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292 (“Agencies generally \n28  have authority to promulgate and enforce requirements that effectuate the statute’s \n2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 3 of 15\n \n1  nondiscrimination mandate, 20 U.S.C. § 1682, even if those requirements do not purport to \n2  represent a definition of discrimination under the statute.”).  The Department’s own regulations \n3  require its Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to investigate any administrative complaint it receives \n4  from a member of the public that indicates gender-based discrimination or sexual harassment.  See \n5  34 C.F.R. § 100.7(c) (“[R]esponsible Department official or his designee will make a prompt \n6  investigation whenever a . . . complaint . . . indicates a possible failure to comply.” (emphasis \n7  added)); Id. § 106.71 (Title IX regulation incorporating the procedural provisions of the \n8  Department’s Title VI regulations).  If the investigation “indicates a failure to comply” with the \n9  regulations, the OCR “will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal \n10  means whenever possible.”  Id. § 106.7(c).  Because investigations are required, Plaintiff alleges \n11  school districts are almost always willing to settle to avoid the termination of their federal funding.  \n12  See Docket No. 1 (“Compl.”) ⁋ 76.   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Importantly, Plaintiff alleges that, until the 2020 Regulations were enacted, the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Department’s OCR had “consistently” issued guidance to school districts “rejecting the view that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the courts’ standards for determining whether a private damages action could be brought against a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  school should be incorporated into its administrative enforcement process.”  Docket No. 1 \nS d nr\nee 17  (“Compl.”) ⁋⁋ 27–28 (citing Sexual Harassment Guidance, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034 (Mar. 13, 1997) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (the “1997 Guidance”); Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance, 66 Fed. Reg. 5,512-01 (Jan. 19, \n19  2001) (the “2001 Guidance”)).  Indeed, the 2001 Guidance adopted a broader scope of liability for \n20  administrative enforcement of Title IX than under the Gebser/Davis framework by (1) defining \n21  sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that is “severe, persistent, or \n22  pervasive;” and (2) concluding that a schools is liable “whether or not it has ‘notice’ of the \n23  harassment.”  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Off. for Civil Rights, Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: \n24  Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third Parties (Jan. 19, 2001), \n25  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.pdf (emphasis added).    \n26  B.  The 2020 Regulations Incorporated the Gebser/Davis Framework \n27  On May 19, 2020, under the leadership of then-Secretary of Education Elisabeth DeVos, \n28  the Department issued the 2020 Regulations, which repudiated the Department’s prior guidance, \n3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 4 of 15\n \n1  and largely aligned the standards for the OCR’s adjudication of Title IX administrative complaints \n2  with the Gebser/Davis framework.  See 85 Fed. Reg. at 30,033 (“The Department believes that \n3  adapting the Gebser/Davis framework is appropriate for administrative enforcement, because the \n4  adapted conditions (definitions of sexual harassment and actual knowledge) and liability standard \n5  (deliberate indifference) reflected in these final regulations promote important policy objectives \n6  with respect to a recipient’s legal obligations to respond to sexual harassment.”).  Plaintiff \n7  complains that, under the 2020 Regulations, schools must respond only to harassment that  (1) is \n8  “severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive conduct” (2) “takes place on school grounds (or in \n9  an education program), regardless of where its effect is felt;” and (3) “a school employee has \n10  actual knowledge of the harassment;” and that (4) a “school may act with indifference to the \n11  harassment, as long as it avoids being ‘deliberately indifferent.’”  Compl. ⁋ 66; see also 85 Fed. \n12  Reg. at 30,032–34.     \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  C.  Plaintiff’s Administrative Complaint \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Plaintiff is “an approved student body association of the Berkeley Unified School District \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (BUSD) of Berkeley, California.”  Compl. ⁋ 16.  Plaintiff’s mission includes reducing sexual \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  harassment experienced by students at Berkeley High School (BHS) by “(1) advocating that the \nS d nr\nee 17  school district adopt policies to protect its members and the student body from sex discrimination, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  including sexual harassment; and (2) [] providing training to the student body about their rights \n19  and responsibilities under school policy, state law, and federal law.”  Id.  Plaintiff also explains \n20  that it seeks to address “other barriers to success and wellbeing for young women and non-binary \n21  students at [BHS].”  Id.  Plaintiff contends that many high school students enrolled in BUSD, \n22  including Plaintiff’s members, “experience sexual harassment, which poses an obstacle to their \n23  ability to learn and thrive in school.”  Id. ⁋ 2.  Plaintiff specifies that injuries to the students “result \n24  not just from the initial harassment alone, but because their school fails to respond to the \n25  harassment promptly and appropriately.”  Id. ⁋⁋ 2-5, 15.   \n26  In February 2021, Plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with the Department’s OCR \n27  against BUSD, alleging several violations of Title IX that Plaintiff contends are “no longer \n28  cognizable” under the 2020 Regulations, including:  \n4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 5 of 15\n \n \n1  Permitting harassment that is severe but not pervasive, including \nunwelcome exposure to others’ genitalia.  \n2   \nPermitting harassment that is pervasive but not severe, including \n3  students’ circulation of sexualized images of a classmate and regular \ncomments by groups of students, usually young men, concerning the \n4  appearances and sexual histories of their classmates, usually young \nwomen.  \n5   \nFailing to take steps to discover and remediate instances of \n6  commonplace harassment, such as that occurring in Zoom “breakout \nrooms,” digital spaces in which small groups or dyads of students \n7  converse on video without a teacher present.  \n \n8  Failing to investigate and address harassment that occurs off campus \nbut impacts survivors’ education, including sexual assaults \n9  committed by students with whom the victims share classes and, \nduring COVID-19, harassing messages sent and received through \n10  students’ personal phones while students share online classrooms.  \n \n11  Failing at times to respond to sexual harassment in a prompt and \neffective manner, and instead, for example, tolerating the open \na  12  presence of an informal club dedicated to sexually harassing \ntr in students and placing the burden on victims to avoid contact with \nuoro 13  their harassers and even transfer out of shared classes, especially \nCfi\n tla when the underlying harassment occurred off campus.  \nciC 14   \nrts fo Failing to take action that addresses all the persons adversely \niD tc 15  affected by sexual harassment, not just the complainant. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Id. ¶ 77. \nS d nr\nee 17  According to Plaintiff, “[b]ut for the Department’s 2020 Regulations,” the OCR would \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  have investigated its administrative complaint.  Id. ⁋ 81.  But under the new regulatory framework, \n19  the OCR “will not investigate [Plaintiff’s] administrative complaint, and will not provide any \n20  relief to [Plaintiff]” because the injuries alleged are no longer cognizable under the 2020 \n21  Regulations.  Id. ⁋ 77-78.  Plaintiff also claims that even if the OCR were to investigate some or \n22  all of the allegations in its administrative complaint, “the Department’s 2020 Regulations do not \n23  require and, in fact, discourage [BUSD] from taking actions that were previously required under \n24  the Department’s prior interpretations of Title IX and that [Plaintiff] wishes its school to take.”  Id. \n25  ⁋ 82.  Ultimately, Plaintiff contends that “the 2020 Regulations . . . deprive [Plaintiff] of a critical \n26  bargaining tool as it seeks to achieve these changes at [BUSD] as part of [Plaintiff’s] \n27  organizational purpose.”  Id.  \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 6 of 15\n \n1  D.  Procedural History and Recent Events \n2  On March 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed the original complaint against the Department seeking to \n3  enjoin the 2020 Regulations and to declare them invalid under the APA for contravening the text \n4  and purpose of Title IX.  Id.  The State of Texas and three groups—the Foundation for Individual \n5  Rights in Education, Independent Women’s Law Center, and Speech First, Inc.—filed motions to \n6  intervene in this case on April 7 and May 24, 2021, respectively.  See Docket Nos. 19, 35.   \n7  Shortly after Plaintiff filed its complaint, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued Executive \n8  Order 14,021 instructing the new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, “to review the [2020 \n9  Regulations] and consider whether [they] should be suspended, revised, or rescinded.”  See Docket \n10  No. 44 at 1 (citing Exec. Order No. 14,021, 86 Fed. Reg. 13,803 (Mar. 8, 2021)).  As a result, on \n11  June 11, 2021, the Department filed a motion to stay the case for sixty days while it reviewed the \n12  2020 Regulations.  Id.  This Court denied the Department’s stay motion citing the unlikelihood \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  that the Department would conduct a notice and comment rulemaking process to rescind, or \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  otherwise modify the 2020 Regulations, before the sixty days were over.  See Docket No. 56.  The \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Department then filed the instant motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  on July 1, 2021.  See Mot.   \nS d nr\nee 17  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Under Rule 12(b)(1), a party may move to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  \n19  “[L]ack of Article III standing requires dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \n20  [Rule] 12(b)(1).”  Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1067 (9th Cir. 2011).  The “irreducible \n21  constitutional minimum” of standing requires that a “plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in \n22  fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to \n23  be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins (“Spokeo II”), 136 S. Ct. \n24  1540, 1547 (2016).  These three elements are referred to as, respectively, injury-in-fact, causation, \n25  and redressability.  Planned Parenthood of Greater Was. & N. Idaho v. U.S. Dep't of Health & \n26  Human Servs., 946 F.3d 1100, 1108 (9th Cir. 2020).  “The plaintiff, as the party invoking federal \n27  jurisdiction, bears the burden of establishing these elements,” which at the pleadings stage means \n28  “clearly . . . alleg[ing] facts demonstrating each element.”  Spokeo II, 136 S. Ct. at 1547 (quoting \n6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 7 of 15\n \n1  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)).   \n2  A Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack may be factual or facial.  See Safe Air for Everyone v. \n3  Meyer, 373 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004).  “In a facial attack,” “the challenger asserts that the \n4  allegations contained in a complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.”  \n5  Id.  The court “resolves a facial attack as it would a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6): \n6  Accepting the plaintiff’s allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s \n7  favor, the court determines whether the allegations are sufficient as a legal matter to invoke the \n8  court’s jurisdiction.”  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir. 2014).   \n9  “[I]n a factual attack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by \n10  themselves, would otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at \n11  1038.  In resolving such an attack, unlike with a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \n12  “may review evidence beyond the complaint without converting the motion to dismiss into a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  motion for summary judgment.”  Id.  Moreover, the court “need not presume the truthfulness of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the plaintiff's allegations.”  Id. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Either way, “it is within the trial court’s power to allow or to require the plaintiff to supply, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  by amendment to the complaint or by affidavits, further particularized allegations of fact deemed \nS d nr\nee 17  supportive of plaintiff’s standing.”  Warth, 422 U.S. at 501; see also Table Bluff Reservation \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (Wiyot Tribe) v. Philip Morris, Inc., 256 F.3d 879, 882 (9th Cir. 2001) (in assessing standing, the \n19  court may consider “the complaint and any other particularized allegations of fact in affidavits or \n20  in amendments to the complaint”). \n21  III.  DISCUSSION \n22  An organization can establish two types of standing under Article III:  (1) organizational \n23  standing and (2) associational (also known as representational) standing.  “Organizational standing \n24  . . . turn[s] on whether the organization itself has suffered an injury in fact.”  Smith v. Pac. Props. \n25  and Dev. Corp., 358 F.3d 1097, 1101 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 \n26  U.S. 463, 378–79 (1982)).  By contrast, associational standing is where “[an organization] can \n27  establish standing only as representative[] of those of [its] members who have been injured in fact, \n28  and thus could have brought suit in their own right.”  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. \n7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 8 of 15\n \n1  26, 40 (1976).    \n2  Plaintiff has failed to establish that it has organizational or associational standing.   \n3  A.  Organizational Standing \n4  “Organizations are entitled to sue on their own behalf for injuries they have sustained.”  \n5  Havens, 455 U.S. at 379 n.19.  “[A]n organization may satisfy the Article III requirement of injury \n6  in fact if it can demonstrate: (1) frustration of its organizational mission [by the defendant’s \n7  actions]; and (2) diversion of its resources to combat [that frustration].”  Smith, 358 F.3d at 1105.  \n8  Because Plaintiff fails to establish that the 2020 Regulations have frustrated its organizational \n9  mission under the first prong of the organizational standing test, the Court need not address \n10  whether Plaintiff has had to divert its resources under the second prong.   \n11  1.  Frustration of Plaintiff’s Mission \n12  “Where a defendant’s conduct has ‘perceptibly impaired’ an organizational plaintiff’s \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  ‘ability to provide [services to its clients], there can be no question that the organization has \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  suffered injury in fact.’”  SurvJustice Inc. v. Devos, No. 18-cv-00535-JSC, 2018 LEXIS 169485 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (N.D.Cal. Oct. 1, 2018) (quoting Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982)).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Plaintiff alleges that the 2020 Regulations will frustrate its mission because “schools under the \nS d nr\nee 17  [2020] Regulations will be required to engage in fewer investigations of sexual harassment, and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  thus will find fewer violations and provide fewer remedies.”  Compl. ⁋ 34.  This is because, \n19  according to Plaintiff, “the 2020 Regulations’ narrowed definition of ‘sexual harassment’ will \n20  undoubtedly reduce reporting even further as students reasonably fear that schools will not provide \n21  any meaningful response if they file a report.”  Id. ⁋ 45; see also id. ⁋ 53 (“[The 2020 Regulations] \n22  will undoubtedly reduce reporting [of sexual harassment incidents] even further.”).  As a result of \n23  this reduction in sexual harassment reporting, Plaintiff vaguely alleges it will have “no choice but \n24  to take actions that are both time consuming and less effective, such as conducting their own \n25  investigations into patterns of harassment at [BUSD] and meeting with school administrators . . . \n26  [b]ecause WSU cannot count on the [OCR] to investigate the [BUSD] and spur changes to its \n27 \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 9 of 15\n \n1  policies and practices.”  Id. ⁋ 80.2 \n2  These allegations fail to establish that the 2020 Regulations frustrate Plaintiff’s mission for \n3  at least two reasons.  First, and most importantly, Plaintiff’s stated mission is not to ensure that \n4  specific instances of sexual harassment at BHS are investigated; rather, it is to advocate that the \n5  school adopt protective policies and to train the students about their rights and responsibilities \n6  under the law.  Id. ⁋ 16.  That the subject of its mission—Berkeley High School—may be less \n7  cooperative as a result of the new regulations is not the kind of concrete frustration of mission that \n8  affords standing.  Plaintiff argues the 2020 Regulations frustrate its mission because it leaves it \n9  “no choice but to take actions that are both time consuming and less effective, such as conducting \n10  their own investigations into patters of harassment at [BUSD] and meeting with school \n11  administrators.”  Compl. ⁋ 80.  But Plaintiff may not establish injury by engaging in activities that \n12  it would normally pursue as part of its organizational mission.  It is a fair inference that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  conducting investigations and meeting with school administrators are valid ways—or even \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  necessary—for Plaintiff to pursue its mission of advocating BHS for more protective policies and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  training BHS students.  Plaintiff does not explain why spending time engaging in these activities \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  would be “time consuming and less effective,” let alone contrary to its mission.  As another court \nS d nr\nee 17  put it: “[i]f this Court were to allow a party whose organizational mission is to engage in policy \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  advocacy to claim injury on the basis of a need to engage in that exact activity, any advocacy \n19  group could find standing to challenge laws when there are changes in policy.”  Know Your IX v. \n20  DeVos, No. CV RDB-20-01224, 2020 WL 6150935, at *6 (D. Md. Oct. 20, 2020).  Therefore, \n21  Plaintiffs’ allegations are not sufficient to establish that the 2020 Regulations frustrate its mission.   \n22  The instant case stands in contrast to SurvJustice, 2018 WL 4770741, and Victim Rights \n23  Law Center v. Cardona, No. CV 20-11104-WGY, 2021 WL 3185743 (D. Mass. July 28, \n24 \n \n2 Plaintiff also alleges that it has organizational standing because, “[w]ithout a doubt, the [OCR] \n25 \nwill not investigate [Plaintiff’s] administrative complaint.”  Compl. at ⁋ 78 (emphasis added).  Not \nonly is this allegation conclusory and speculative; it also appears to be incorrect.  In its briefs and \n26 \nat oral argument the Department clearly stated that it was in the process of reviewing Plaintiff’s \nadministrative complaint and that it recently asked Plaintiff for more information.  See Mot. at 7–\n27 \n8; Docket No. 65 (“Reply”) at 7–8.  Although the Department did not commit to an exact deadline \nwhen it will issue a decision on Plaintiffs’ administrative complaint, there is no indication the \n28 \nDepartment has decided not to investigate the sexual harassment allegations Plaintiff raised there. \n9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 10 of 15\n \n1  2021), where the Department’s actions frustrated the missions of organizations that provided legal \n2  representation and counseling to sexual harassment survivors.  The plaintiffs in SurvJustice were \n3  challenging the Department’s new guidance “related to the procedures by which educational \n4  institutions investigate, adjudicate, and resolve allegations of student-on-student sexual \n5  misconduct” (the “2017 Guidance”), which preceded the issuance of the 2020 Regulations.  2018 \n6  WL 4770741, at *3.  The plaintiffs there—unlike Plaintiff here—had missions that included “to \n7  increase the prospect of justice for survivors of sexual violence. . . through legal assistance;” “to \n8  litigate[] cases involving issues of gender discrimination in employment and education at all \n9  stages. . . [and to] counsel[] and represent[] women who have been victims of sexual harassment \n10  and/or sexual assault in matters pursuant to Title IX;” and “to provide legal representation to \n11  victims of rape and sexual assault.”  2018 WL 4770741, at *4 (emphases added).  Because the \n12  2017 “Guidance discourage[d] survivors of sexual harassment and sexual violence from filing \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  complaints,” Magistrate Judge Corley concluded it frustrated these organizations’ missions, which \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  involved prosecuting those very same complaints.  Id. at *6–*7.  Similarly, Judge Young of the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  District of Massachusetts held that Victim Rights Law Center “demonstrate[d] a direct impairment \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  from the [2020 Regulations]” because it “advocate[d] on behalf of victims of sexual assault during \nS d nr\nee 17  the Title IX process,” and “experienced a reduction in requests for its services.”  Victims Rts. Law \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Ctr., 2021 WL 3185743, at *10; Cf. E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 663 (9th \n19  Cir. 2021) (regulations requiring asylum seekers to “remain detained . . . near the border hundreds \n20  of miles away” frustrated organizations’ “mission of assisting migrants seeking asylum” because \n21  they “cannot represent [those detained] asylum seekers”).   \n22  Here, by contrast, Plaintiff’s mission does not include representing, advocating for, or \n23  providing legal assistance to individual sexual harassment survivors.  Indeed, unlike in SurvJustice \n24  and Victim Rights Law Center, the complaint here does not explain how fewer reports and \n25  investigations of sexual harassment make it harder, i.e., “perceptively impair,” Plaintiff’s ability to \n26  advocate for more protective policies at BHS or to train BHS’s students.   \n27  Indeed, the instant case is similar to Know Your IX, where Judge Bennett of the District of \n28  Maryland recently concluded two organizations—Know Your IX and Gender Equity—failed to \n10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 11 of 15\n \n1  establish that the 2020 Regulations frustrated their missions for purposes of organizational \n2  standing.  2020 WL 6150935, at *5.  Like Plaintiff here, the plaintiffs in Know Your IX alleged \n3  that  \n \n4  [g]iven the diminished responsibility under federal law for schools \nto respond to reports of sexual harassment and assault under the \n5  challenged provisions of the final Rule, [the plaintiffs] will need to \ndedicate additional staff time and resources to advocate at the local \n6  and state levels for measures that are proven to prevent the \noccurrence of sexual harassment and assault.... \n7   \n8  Id. at *5.  Gender Equity “claim[ed] that its core mission [was] carried out through policy \n9  advocacy,” and Know Your IX’s “goal [was] to empower high school and college students to end \n10  sexual and dating violence in their schools through legal rights education; training, organizing, and \n11  supporting student-survivor activists; and advocating for campus, state, and federal policy \n12  change.”  Id. at *6–*7.  Like Plaintiff here, neither organization represented or offered legal \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  services to sexual harassment survivors who filed complaints.  Id. at *6.  Although the Know Your \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  IX plaintiffs argued they had to spend more time and resources to accomplish their mission, the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  court concluded that “resource reallocations motivated by the dictates of preference, however \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  sincere, are not cognizable organizational injuries because no action by the defendant has directly \nS d nr\nee 17  impaired the organization’s ability to operate and function.”  Id. at *7 (emphasis added) (quoting \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  CASA de Maryland, Inc. v. Trump, 971 F.3d 220, 239 (4th Cir. 2020)).  Plaintiff here has also \n19  failed to explain how the Department’s actions would directly impair its ability to operate and \n20  function as a policy advocacy and training organization.  \n21  Second, Plaintiff’s allegations would be insufficient—even assuming Plaintiff explained \n22  how a reduction in reporting of sexual harassment incidents could “perceptively impair” its policy \n23  advocacy and training efforts—because Plaintiff fails to specifically allege that such a reduction in \n24  reporting is actually taking place or is imminent.  See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. \n25  2190, 2203 (2021) (“[T]o establish standing, a plaintiff must show (i) that he suffered an injury in \n26  fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent.” (emphasis added)).  The complaint \n27  also assumes, without a clear factual basis, that BHS will not protect students from sexual \n28  harassment because, as a result of the 2020 Regulations, the Department is less likely to \n11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 12 of 15\n \n1  investigate instances of sexual harassment on campus.  But there is nothing stopping BHS from \n2  addressing instances of sexual harassment on campus, adopting more protective policies, or \n3  allowing Plaintiff to train its students, even if the Department is less likely to withhold funding \n4  under the 2020 Regulations.  See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 414 (2013) (“We \n5  decline to abandon our usual reluctance to endorse standing that rest on speculation about the \n6  decisions of independent actors.”); Equal Means Equal v. Dep’t of Educ., 450 F. Supp. 3d 1, 8 (D. \n7  Mass. 2020) (organizational plaintiff’s mission was not frustrated by the Department’s 2017 \n8  Guidance because it “d[id] not allege that colleges and universities [were] in fact using the clear \n9  and convincing standard of proof, thus making it more difficult for [the plaintiff’s] clients to \n10  obtain beneficial outcomes”).  Thus, to properly plead that the 2020 Regulations frustrate its \n11  mission, Plaintiff needs to add specific facts to the complaint establishing that, as a result of the \n12  2020 Regulations, BHS is unwilling to adopt policies that protect students from sexual harassment \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  or to allow Plaintiff to train BHS students.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  In Equal Means Equal, Judge Saris of the District of Massachusetts held that the National \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Coalition Against Violent Athletes (NCAVA) had not established that the Department’s 2017 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Guidance frustrated its stated mission “to advocate for the equal treatment of victims of sex-based \nS d nr\nee 17  harms under civil rights laws,” even though NCAVA “provide[d] legal referrals, counsel and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  advocacy to [survivors] of sex-based harms.”  450 F. Supp. 3d at 8.  She reasoned that NCAVA \n19  “[had] not demonstrated a particularized injury traceable to the [2017 Guidance] beyond a general \n20  statement that victims have expressed an unwillingness to report sex-based harm to campus \n21  authorities.”  Id. at *7–*8.  In fact, NCAVA’s allegation was simply that “victims ha[d] expressed \n22  an unwillingness to report sex-based harm to campus authorities and law enforcement officials.”  \n23  Id. at *6.  Plaintiff’s allegation in the case at bar that “the 2020 Regulations’ narrowed definition \n24  of ‘sexual harassment’ will undoubtedly reduce reporting” is just as conclusory.  Compl. ⁋ 45.   \n25  By contrast, the plaintiffs in SurvJustice specifically alleged “an observed decrease in \n26  student-filed complaints following issuance of the 2017 Guidance,” and “that their clients ha[d] \n27  directly attributed their hesitancy in filing those complaints to the 2017 Guidance.”  2018 WL \n28  4770741, at *6–*7.  The organizational plaintiff in Victims Rights Law Center was also able to \n12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 13 of 15\n \n1  “attest that it ha[d] actively experienced unwillingness and hesitance from student [survivors] to \n2  continue their Title IX complaints” because the 2020 Regulations included a “requirement that the \n3  complainant be cross-examined at the Title IX hearing.”  2021 WL 3185743, at *4.  Plaintiff here \n4  has not alleged that there is an actual or imminent reduction in sexual harassment reporting at \n5  BHS with this kind of detailed allegations.   \n6  Accordingly, Plaintiff does not have organizational standing because it has not plausibly \n7  alleged that the 2020 Regulations frustrated its stated mission of advocating BHS for more \n8  protective policies or training BHS students about their rights.  \n9  B.  Associational Standing \n10  An entity has associational standing where (1) “its members would otherwise have \n11  standing to sue in their own right;” (2) “the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the \n12  organization’s purpose;” and (3) “neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  AlohaCare v. Hawaii, 572 F.3d 740, 747 (9th \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Cir. 2009).  Because Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege that its members would otherwise have \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  standing to sue in their own right under the first prong of the associational standing test, the Court \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  need not address the other two prongs.  \nS d nr\nee 17  To show that a member would have standing to sue in his or her own right, the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  organization “must show that a member suffers an injury-in-fact that is traceable to the defendant \n19  and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Associated Gen. Contractors of Am., San \n20  Diego Chapter, Inc. v. Cal. Dep’t of Transp., 713 F.3d 1187, 1194 (9th Cir. 2013).  Plaintiff’s \n21  complaint includes only speculative and conclusory allegations that the 2020 Regulations deny its \n22  members—survivors of sexual harassment at BHS—of “the benefit of having the department \n23  investigate and redress many types of harassment [they] have experienced and are currently \n24  experiencing.”  Compl. ⁋ 15.  Indeed, according to Plaintiff,  \n \n25  the [OCR] . . . will not provide any relief to WSU and its members, \nbecause the 2020 Regulations no longer make it unlawful for \n26  purposes of administrative enforcement for the [BUSD] to disregard \nsexual harassment that is severe but not pervasive (or pervasive but \n27  not severe); sexual harassment that originates outside the school’s \n“program or activity,” even though it impacts students’ ability to \n28  participate in the school’s program or activity; and sexual \n13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 75   Filed 09/02/21   Page 14 of 15\n \nharassment that the school should reasonably know about, but of \n1  which it lacks actual knowledge.   \n2  Id. at ⁋ 78.  These boilerplate allegations merely speculate that the 2020 Regulations will lead \n3  BUSD to disregard certain sexual harassment complaints; there are no specific allegations in the \n4  complaint that BUSD has in fact disregarded a single sexual harassment complaint or that a single \n5  student has chosen not to report or file a complaint after suffering sexual harassment; let alone that \n6  there has been a noticeable decline in sexual harassment reports at BHS or BUSD.  In other words, \n7  there are no allegations that Plaintiff’s members have been injured or will imminently be injured \n8  by the 2020 Regulations.  Cf. Young v. Trump, No. 20-CV-07183-EMC, 2020 WL 7319434 (N.D. \n9  Cal. Dec. 11, 2020) (plaintiffs properly alleged Article III injury-in-fact because their complaint \n10  had “common contentions . . . for each named Plaintiff regarding the suspension and withholding \n11  of their beneficiaries’ visas under Diplomacy Strong”).    \n12  Accordingly, Plaintiff has not established that it has associational standing.  Although \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiff is not required to cite a specific member in its complaint, see National Council of La \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Raza v. Cegavsk, 800 F.3d 1032, 1041 (9th Cir. 2015), to establish associational standing it must \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  allege with sufficient specificity and detail how its members have been injured or will imminently \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  be injured by the enactment of the 2020 Regulations.   \nS d nr\nee 17  IV.  CONCLUSION \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Department’s motion to dismiss for \n19  lack of Article III standing with leave to amend.

Civil Action No. ___________ \n7 \nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, \n8 \n                  Defendant. \n9 \n \n10 \nCOMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n11  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CASE \n \n12  Plaintiff, The Women’s Student Union, brings this action against the U.S. Department of \n13 \nEducation seeking to set aside its 2020 Regulations – promulgated under the authority of then-\n14 \nSecretary Betsy DeVos – that reduce federal protections students enrolled in public school have \n15 \nfrom sexual harassment, including sexual violence, under Title IX of the Education Amendments \n16 \nof 1972.  \n17 \nINTRODUCTION \n18 \n19  1.  Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, has been too common an \n20 \nexperience of students at public schools across the country. Women and LGBTQ students are \n21 \nmore likely to experience such harassment than other student populations.  \n22 \n2.  Sexual harassment poses an obstacle to students’ ability to learn and thrive in \n23 \nschool. When young people are sexually harassed by classmates or teachers, they avoid school \n24 \nand develop mistrust of educational institutions. Their academic performance suffers. They often \n25 \n26  drop classes or leave school altogether. And this is to say nothing of the lasting physical and \n27  psychological harm from sexual harassment. \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 3 of 24\n \n1  3.  Students experience these injuries not due to the harassment alone, but often \n2 \nbecause their schools fail to respond to the harassment promptly and appropriately.  \n3 \n4.  Just like young people at schools across the country, many high school students \n4 \nenrolled in California’s Berkeley Unified School District experience sexual harassment.  \n5 \n5.  For example, at Berkeley High School, students are often told they must either \n6 \nshare a classroom with a student who sexually assaulted them off campus – or the victim must \n7 \n8  leave the class. Even when learning takes place primarily online, as it does this school year due \n9  to COVID-19, victims are required to be in small video “breakout rooms” with their harasser. \n10 \n6.  Such unchecked harassment is not inevitable. Title IX of the Education \n11 \nAmendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funds, is \n12 \na critical federal law that students have long relied on as a tool for getting schools to address \n13 \nsexual harassment. \n14 \n7.  For decades, the U.S. Department of Education, which is the primary federal \n15 \n16  agency charged with enforcing Title IX, informed schools that they were responsible under Title \n17  IX for responding to any sexual harassment of students that they knew or should have known \n18 \nabout, so long as the harassment was sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student’s \n19 \nability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program.  \n20 \n8.  In 2020, under the leadership of then-Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Department \n21 \nissued Regulations that purported to effectuate Title IX but, in fact, weakened key protections for \n22 \nthose who experience sexual harassment and disincentivized school districts from learning about \n23 \n24  or responding to sexual harassment experienced by their students. See 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May \n25 \n19, 2020) (codified at various places in 34 C.F.R. Pt. 106).  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 4 of 24\n \n1  9.  Without adequate justification or explanation, the Department undermined the \n2 \nexisting sexual harassment framework by changing the “what,” “where,” “when,” and “how” of \n3 \nits prior interpretations of Title IX. \n4 \n10.  What: The 2020 Regulations constrict what misconduct constitutes unlawful \n5 \nsexual harassment that schools need to respond to under Title IX. Harassment can no longer \n6 \ntrigger a school’s responsibilities to a victim merely due to its severity or its pervasiveness – both \n7 \n8  must be present.  \n9  11.  Where: The 2020 Regulations exclude from Title IX coverage sexual harassment \n10 \nof students by other students or faculty if the harassment took place off school grounds and was \n11 \nnot part of a school program (such as a field trip). The fact that the harmful effects of the \n12 \nharassment are experienced by students while at school and diminish their educational \n13 \nopportunities is no longer sufficient. \n14 \n12.  When: The 2020 Regulations restrict when a school district is obligated to \n15 \n16  investigate and redress sexual harassment under Title IX. Now, the school district must only act \n17  when certain delimited school employees have actual knowledge of the harassment. The \n18 \nRegulations completely eliminate a school district’s responsibility when it should have known \n19 \nabout the harassment, but did not actually know. \n20 \n13.  How: The 2020 Regulations alter how the Department will assess whether a \n21 \nschool district complied with its obligation to investigate and redress harassment under Title IX. \n22 \nInstead of asking whether the school had taken prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated \n23 \n24  to end the harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and, as \n25 \nappropriate, remedy its effects, the Regulations require only that the school provide remedies \n26 \ndesigned to restore or preserve equal access to the student who complained about the harassment. \n27 \nAnd instead of asking whether a school had met its obligations under Title IX, the Department \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 5 of 24\n \n1  now asks only whether the school acted with deliberate indifference, i.e., in a clearly \n2 \nunreasonable way.  \n3 \n14.  The 2020 Regulations reduce schools’ incentives and hinder their abilities to take \n4 \npreventive or remedial action, and will therefore cause even more women and LGBTQ students \n5 \nto experience sexual harassment. \n6 \n15.  These regulatory changes are denying students the legal protections of Title IX \n7 \n8  that they previously enjoyed, and are denying WSU the benefit of having the Department \n9  investigate and redress many types of harassment its members and other students have \n10 \nexperienced and are currently experiencing at Berkeley High School. \n11 \nPARTIES \n12 \n16.  Plaintiff, The Women’s Student Union (WSU), is an approved student body \n13 \nassociation of the Berkeley Unified School District of Berkeley, California. WSU’s mission \n14 \nincludes reducing sexual harassment experienced by students of Berkeley High School by \n15 \n16  (1) advocating that the school district adopt policies to protect its members and the student body \n17  from sex discrimination, including sexual harassment; and (2) providing training to the student \n18 \nbody about their rights and responsibilities under school policy, state law, and federal law. WSU \n19 \nalso seeks to address other barriers to success and wellbeing for young women and non-binary \n20 \nstudents at Berkeley High School.  \n21 \n17.  Defendant is the U.S. Department of Education. The Department implements \n22 \nTitle IX through issuing regulations and guidance documents and is tasked with administrative \n23 \n24  enforcement of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1682. Its principal address is 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., \n25 \nWashington, D.C. 20202. \n26 \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 6 of 24\n \n1  JURISDICTION \n2 \n18.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because it arises under \n3 \nfederal law, e.g., Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Administrative \n4 \nProcedure Act (APA). This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2) \n5 \nbecause a department of the United States is a defendant. \n6 \nVENUE \n7 \n8  19.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because \n9  WSU resides (i.e., maintains its principal place of business, id. § 1391(c)(2)) in this District and \n10 \nno real property is involved in the action. \n11 \nINTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n12 \n20.  Venue is proper in either the San Francisco or Oakland Division pursuant to Civil \n13 \nLocal Rule 3 2(d) because this action arises in Alameda County. \n14 \nALLEGATIONS \n15 \n16  21.  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides, subject to certain \n17  exceptions not relevant here, that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \n18 \nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \n19 \nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n20 \nTitle IX defines “program or activity” in relevant part as “all of the operations” of a school, “any \n21 \npart of which is extended Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1687. \n22 \n22.  For more than 45 years, this federal law has given students a critical civil rights \n23 \n24  tool to fight sex discrimination and promote equal access to educational benefits and \n25 \nopportunities. While these protections extend to all students, they have been particularly \n26 \nbeneficial to girls and women, who had been historically excluded from many educational \n27 \nprograms and opportunities.  \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 7 of 24\n \n1  23.  It is settled by multiple decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court that Title IX’s \n2 \nprohibition against sex discrimination includes protection against sexual harassment that can be \n3 \nenforced in federal court by injured students through an implied private right of action for \n4 \ncompensatory damages and injunctive relief. See Davis v. Monroe Cty Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. \n5 \n629 (1999); Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274 (1998); Franklin v. Gwinnett \n6 \nCty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60 (1992); Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979). In order \n7 \n8  to recover damages in a court action, a private plaintiff must show that a school district had \n9  actual knowledge of the harassment and acted with deliberate indifference. \n10 \n24.  But Title IX is also administratively enforced by federal agencies that disburse \n11 \nfunds to educational institutions. Congress “authorized and directed” federal agencies that \n12 \nprovide financial assistance to education programs or activities to “effectuate the provisions of” \n13 \nTitle IX “by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.” 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n14 \nWhile such rules, regulations, or orders are not always enforceable through the private right of \n15 \n16  action, violations can result in the Department withholding federal education funds. 20 U.S.C. \n17  § 1682. To avoid the threat of fund termination, school districts almost always are willing to \n18 \nsettle with the Department during or after an administrative investigation by agreeing to address \n19 \nsexual harassment through individual relief and systemic change. \n20 \n25.  For decades, and through multiple Administrations, the U.S. Department of \n21 \nEducation, through its Office for Civil Rights, has been the primary federal agency charged with \n22 \nenforcing Title IX administratively and has issued consistent guidance to school districts about \n23 \n24  how it interpreted Title IX in the context of sexual harassment.  \n25 \n26.  Among the Department’s Guidances are two that went through notice and \n26 \ncomment – Sexual Harassment Guidance, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034 (Mar. 13, 1997) (“1997 \n27 \nGuidance”); Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance, 66 Fed. Reg. 5,512 (Jan. 19, 2001), available \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 8 of 24\n \n1  at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html (“2001 Guidance”) – and a \n2 \nseries of others issued by both Democratic and Republic Administrations, including: \n3 \n•  Sexual Harassment: It’s Not Academic (1988), \n4 \nhttps://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED330265.pdf. \n5 \n•  Dear Colleague Letter (Jan. 25, 2006), \n6 \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/sexhar-2006.html. \n7 \n8  •  Dear Colleague Letter: Harassment and Bullying (Oct. 26, 2010), \n9 \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html.    \n10 \n•  Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence (Apr. 4, 2011), \n11 \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf.  \n12 \n•  Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence (Apr. 29, 2014), \n13 \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf. \n14 \n15  •  Q&A on Campus Sexual Misconduct (Sept. 22, 2017), \n16 \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-title-ix-201709.pdf.  \n17 \n27.  The Department’s harassment Guidances concerning sexual harassment \n18 \nconsistently rejected the view that the standards adopted by courts to determine whether a private \n19 \ndamages action could be brought against a school should be incorporated into the administrative \n20 \nenforcement process it oversees.  \n21 \n22  28.  Although they varied in their level of detail and emphasis, these Guidances \n23  informed schools of the Department’s consistent view that:  \n24 \n(1) unlawful “sexual harassment” means unwelcome conduct that denies or limits a \n25 \nstudent’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program based on \n26 \nsex and can include conduct that is severe, persistent, or pervasive – in other \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 9 of 24\n \n1  words, sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student’s ability to participate \n2 \nin or benefit from the school’s program;  \n3 \n(2) schools are required to address all harassing conduct that creates a hostile \n4 \nenvironment in an education program or activity, even if the conduct occurs \n5 \noutside an education program or activity;  \n6 \n(3) schools are responsible for any sexual harassment of students that they knew or, \n7 \n8  in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known about; and  \n9  (4) schools must take prompt and effective action to end the unlawful harassment, \n10 \nprevent it from recurring, and remedy its effects.  \n11 \n29.  Other than the definition of sexual harassment, all these requirements also applied \n12 \nto all other forms of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX, such as guidance counselors \n13 \nsteering students of different sexes to different classes, teachers grading students more or less \n14 \nharshly on the basis of sex, or retaliation for raising concerns of sex discrimination. \n15 \n16  30.  All these requirements were also consistent with the Department’s Guidances \n17  concerning schools’ responsibilities under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 \n18 \nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to \n19 \naddress race- and disability-based harassment, including: \n20 \n•  Racial Incidents and Harassment Against Students at Educational Institutions; \n21 \nInvestigative Guidance, 59 Fed.

The Department’s harassment Guidances around race and disability consistently \n2 \nrejected the view that the standards adopted by courts to determine whether a private damages \n3 \naction could be brought against a school should be incorporated into the administrative \n4 \nenforcement process it oversees. \n5 \n32.  The Department continues to apply its traditional standards to students’ claims of \n6 \nrace and disability harassment. But, after the Department’s 2020 Regulations, the same is not \n7 \n8  true for sexual harassment.  \n9  33.  Without adequate justification or explanation, the Department’s 2020 Regulations \n10 \n– under then-Secretary Betsy DeVos – reduce protections to students from sexual harassment \n11 \nwith regard to each of these elements by narrowly redefining “sexual harassment,” “program or \n12 \nactivity,” and “notice,” and limiting its examination of whether schools had met their remedial \n13 \nobligations.  \n14 \n34.  Indeed, the Department acknowledged in the preamble to the 2020 Regulations \n15 \n16  that schools under the new Regulations will be required to engage in fewer investigations of \n17  sexual harassment, and thus will find fewer violations and provide fewer remedies. This was \n18 \nviewed as feature, not a flaw, of the Regulations.  \n19 \n35.  Although the Department refused to acknowledge it, the inevitable result of fewer \n20 \ninvestigations and fewer remedies will be an increase in the amount of sexual harassment, as \n21 \nwould-be harassers will no longer be deterred by fear of being caught and disciplined, or have \n22 \nthe opportunity to learn to change their behavior thanks to an educational intervention. Yet the \n23 \n24  Department never grappled with the tradeoff between increased sexual harassment and the \n25 \npurported benefits it attributed to the Regulations. \n26 \n36.  With the changes adopted by the 2020 Regulations, the Department provides less \n27 \nprotection to students who experience sexual harassment than to students who experience other \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 11 of 24\n \n1  forms of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX, as well as race discrimination (including \n2 \nharassment) prohibited under Title VI and disability discrimination (including harassment) \n3 \nprohibited under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The \n4 \nDepartment offered no justification or evidence that would support a weaker standard for sexual \n5 \nharassment relative to all other forms of discrimination and harassment.  \n6 \nLimiting what constitutes sexual harassment under Title IX. \n7 \n8  37.  The 2020 Regulations adopted a novel and narrow definition of “sexual \n9  harassment” that is inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and excludes multiple forms of \n10 \nmisconduct that interfere with equal access to educational opportunities. \n11 \n38.  The 2020 Regulations define sexual harassment as conduct on the basis of sex \n12 \nthat is unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so “severe, pervasive, and \n13 \nobjectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education \n14 \nprogram or activity.” 34 C.F.R. 106.30 (emphasis added).   \n15 \n16  39.  Without adequate justification or explanation, this new definition substantially \n17  departs from the traditional definition for sexual harassment (and race- and disability-based \n18 \nharassment) that the Department has instructed schools to apply for more than two decades.  \n19 \n40.  The Department previously defined unlawful sexual harassment as unwelcome \n20 \nconduct of a sexual nature that “is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a student’s \n21 \nability to participate in or benefit from an education program or activity.” (emphasis added).  \n22 \n41.  Under this traditional definition, the Department applied a sliding scale: a single \n23 \n24  or isolated incident of sexual harassment could, if sufficiently severe, constitute unlawful sexual \n25 \nharassment without being repetitive or ongoing in nature, whereas less severe but ongoing or \n26 \npervasive conduct that limited a student was also considered to be unlawful harassment \n27 \nprohibited by Title IX. \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 12 of 24\n \n1  42.  Under the 2020 Regulations, however, a school is no longer required to \n2 \ninvestigate and remedy an egregious but isolated incident of sexual harassment under Title IX \n3 \nbecause such harassment is no longer sufficiently “pervasive” to fall within the Rule’s narrowed \n4 \ndefinition of sexual harassment. Misconduct such as indecent exposure, a request for sexual \n5 \nfavors, some kinds of unwanted touching, and sharing of sexual images and videos are likely all \n6 \nexcluded under the 2020 Regulations. Yet this conduct can produce the very exclusionary effects \n7 \n8  that the text of Title IX proscribes.  \n9  43.  Conversely, misconduct that is pervasive but not independently severe – such as \n10 \nsome persistent sexual comments about a student’s body – would likewise be excluded. This \n11 \nconduct, too, can produce the very exclusionary effects that the text of Title IX proscribes.  \n12 \n44.  The 2020 Regulations further narrow sexual harassment to conduct that \n13 \n“effectively denies a person equal access” to education. Title IX protects students from being \n14 \n“excluded from participation in,” “denied the benefits of,” and “subjected to discrimination \n15 \n16  under” a program or activity. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Nonetheless, contrary to the statutory text, \n17  and without a reasoned explanation, the Regulations provide that only students who are \n18 \n“effectively denied” access are protected from misconduct.  \n19 \n45.  Only a small portion of sexual harassment of students is reported to school \n20 \nauthorities. Students often choose not to report because they think the harassment is not serious \n21 \nenough or that no one would do anything to help. The 2020 Regulations’ narrowed definition of \n22 \n“sexual harassment” will undoubtedly reduce reporting even further as students reasonably fear \n23 \n24  that schools will not provide any meaningful response if they file a report.  \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 13 of 24\n \n1  Limiting where Title IX’s protections apply \n2 \n46.  The 2020 Regulations adopted a novel and narrow definition of “program or \n3 \nactivity” for sexual harassment that is inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and excludes \n4 \nmultiple forms of misconduct that interfere with equal access to educational opportunities. \n5 \n47.  This definition is inconsistent with the definition the Department uses for all other \n6 \nforms of sex discrimination, and for race or disability discrimination (including harassment). \n7 \n8  48.  In the context of sexual harassment, a school is only responsible for sexual \n9  harassment “in” its “program or activity;” and “program or activity” is defined to “include[ ] \n10 \nlocations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over \n11 \nboth the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any \n12 \nbuilding owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a \n13 \npostsecondary institution.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.44(a). \n14 \n49.  Without adequate justification or explanation, this new definition substantially \n15 \n16  departs from the traditional definition for sexual harassment that the Department has instructed \n17  schools to apply. The Department previously required schools to investigate harassment that \n18 \noccurred or originated off campus to determine whether the effects of that harassment are \n19 \naffecting a student’s access to a school’s program or activity. \n20 \n50.  This new definition is not in accordance with the statute. Title IX does not require \n21 \nthat the harassment take place “in” an education program or activity. Title IX is not concerned \n22 \nwith where the underlying conduct occurred, but whether the person is “denied the benefits of, or \n23 \n24  [is] subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.”  \n25 \n51.  Sexual harassment can often occur in the first instance outside the “substantial \n26 \ncontrol” of a school but nonetheless can deny students educational benefits and exclude them \n27 \nfrom equal participation. Focusing on the location of the harassment, and not its effects on the \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 14 of 24\n \n1  student, leads to absurd results. For example, a school would have no responsibility to respond \n2 \nunder the 2020 Regulations when a student or teacher sexually assaults another student so long \n3 \nas the assault occurred off school grounds and not during a school activity. And yet, even if the \n4 \nconduct results in the student becoming too afraid to attend the class taught by, or shared with, \n5 \nthe victim’s assailant, the 2020 Regulations immunize the school from any responsibility. \n6 \n52.  Online harassment is another circumstance where the 2020 Regulations would \n7 \n8  lead to absurd results. Such online sexual harassment is particularly prevalent in high schools. \n9  Yet, under the 2020 Regulations, whether a school must respond to such misconduct will depend \n10 \non whether the device used to harass is school-owned or privately-provided, whether the device \n11 \nis using the school’s Wi-Fi or not, or whether the device is on or off school grounds when the \n12 \nharassing message is sent. From the student on the receiving end, however, the effect is the same. \n13 \nThis is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, since remote learning has further blurred \n14 \nthe line between harassment “in” and “out” of school. And harassers will learn that they can \n15 \n16  avoid accountability at school by simply targeting students using personal devices off school \n17  grounds. \n18 \n53.  Only a small portion of sexual harassment of students is reported to school \n19 \nauthorities. The 2020 Regulations’ narrowed definition of “program or activity” will leave \n20 \nstudents uncertain about whether their school will investigate their complaint, particularly when \n21 \nthose students are unlikely to know the location of the harasser or the device used. This will \n22 \nundoubtedly reduce reporting even further. \n23 \n24  Limiting when a school district is responsible for sexual harassment  \neffecting students in its programs \n25 \n54.  The 2020 Regulations adopted a novel requirement of “actual knowledge” for \n26 \nsexual harassment that is inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and will exclude from \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 15 of 24\n \n1  Title IX’s coverage significant amounts of misconduct that interfere with equal access to \n2 \neducational opportunities. \n3 \n55.  This requirement is inconsistent with the requirement the Department uses for all \n4 \nother forms of sex discrimination, and for race or disability discrimination (including \n5 \nharassment). \n6 \n56.  The 2020 Regulations provide that elementary and secondary schools will only be \n7 \n8  responsible for addressing sexual harassment when a school employee has “actual knowledge” of \n9  the harassment or allegations of the harassment. 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.30(a), 106.44(a).  \n10 \n57.  Without adequate justification or explanation, this new requirement substantially \n11 \ndeparts from the traditional position of the Department, which required schools to address sexual \n12 \nharassment if almost any school employee either “knew or should reasonably have known” about \n13 \na student-on-student incident or an employee-on-student incident that occurred outside the \n14 \ncontext of the employee’s provision of aid, benefits, and services to students. \n15 \n16  58.  Under the 2020 Regulations, schools will lack the incentives to develop systems \n17  to detect sexual harassment and to encourage students to report sexual harassment. To the \n18 \ncontrary, schools and their employees will be incentivized to avoid having “actual knowledge” of \n19 \nsexual harassment so that they are not required to address it – even if they believe or have reason \n20 \nto believe that a student is experiencing the adverse effects of harassment. \n21 \nLimiting how the Department will determine whether a school district \n22 \nhas appropriately responded to sexual harassment under Title IX \n23 \n59.  The 2020 Regulations adopted truncated and exceedingly deferential requirements \n24 \nabout the remedies a school needs to provide after it determines there has been unlawful sexual \n25 \nharassment that are inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and do not address the school-\n26 \nwide effects that can result from such harassment.  \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 15 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 16 of 24\n \n1  60.  The 2020 Regulations require a school to provide students who experienced \n2 \nunlawful sexual harassment and complained about it “remedies designed to restore or preserve \n3 \nequal access” and may impose “disciplinary sanctions” on a student found responsible for \n4 \nharassment after following an elaborate grievance procedure. 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(1)(i). The \n5 \nRegulations further provide that the Department will find a school violated its remedial \n6 \nobligations only if it responded in a manner that is “deliberately indifferent.” 34 C.F.R. \n7 \n8  § 106.44(a). The Department will find a school is deliberately indifferent only “if its response to \n9  sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.” Id. \n10 \n61.  Without adequate justification or explanation, these new limitations substantially \n11 \ndepart from the traditional position of the Department, which required schools, after a finding of \n12 \nunlawful sexual harassment, to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the \n13 \nharassment, eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, \n14 \nremedy its effects.  \n15 \n16  62.  The Department does not impose these limitations for all other forms of sex \n17  discrimination, or for race or disability discrimination (including harassment). \n18 \n63.  Just addressing the harm caused by unlawful sexual harassment to the student \n19 \nwho complains is insufficient. Interventions for an entire class or school may be necessary to \n20 \neliminate the hostile environment created by the harassment that only a single student \n21 \ncomplained of. Such remedies serve to eliminate the effects the discrimination had on the \n22 \nprogram, not just the parties to a specific complaint.  \n23 \n24  64.  The 2020 Regulations permit a school to respond unreasonably to complaints of \n25 \nsexual harassment, so long as its response is not “clearly” unreasonable. This safe harbor for \n26 \nschools is inappropriately restrictive and will lead to more inappropriate responses to known \n27 \nharassment.  \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 16 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 17 of 24\n \n1  Injuries Caused by the 2020 Regulations \n2 \n65.  While each of the challenged 2020 Regulations on its own is contrary to the text \n3 \nand purpose of Title IX and, without adequate justification or explanation, at odds with the \n4 \nDepartment’s traditional interpretation, their cumulative effect will lead to students experiencing \n5 \nmore sexual harassment and receiving fewer remedies. \n6 \n66.  Under these provisions, schools are not responsible for responding to sexual \n7 \n8  harassment unless the sexual harassment qualifies as “severe, pervasive, and objectively \n9  offensive;” the harassment takes place on school grounds (or in an education program), \n10 \nregardless of where its effect is felt; and a school employee has actual knowledge of the \n11 \nharassment. Even then, students will no longer be entitled to the full range of remedies that they \n12 \nand their classmates may need to continue their education free from discrimination. And the \n13 \nschool may act with indifference to the harassment, as long as it avoids being “deliberately \n14 \nindifferent.”  \n15 \n16  67.  The 2020 Regulations vastly change the incentives of schools to prioritize \n17  preventing and deterring sexual harassment. Under the challenged provisions, a school’s failure \n18 \nto effectively prevent and promptly respond to sexual harassment will be much less likely to \n19 \ncarry any consequences. In fact, a school may be incentivized to avoid learning about the \n20 \nharassment its students experience, in order to avoid triggering any obligations under the \n21 \nRegulations. \n22 \n68.  The 2020 Regulations also discourage students from filing complaints with their \n23 \n24  schools in the first place by creating uncertainty about what conduct will trigger a school’s \n25 \nobligation under Title IX to investigate and respond to sexual harassment.  \n26 \n69.  The Department itself acknowledged that the 2020 Regulations would reduce \n27 \ninvestigations of sexual harassment by 50% in K-12 schools. But nowhere does the Department \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 18 of 24\n \n1  conclude that a substantial reduction in investigations will result in less sexual harassment or \n2 \nmore “effective” protections against sexual harassment. Nor could it.  \n3 \n70.  To the contrary, the 2020 Regulations will result in more students being subjected \n4 \nto sexual harassment because it narrows the scope of Title IX’s protections.  \n5 \n71.  The Department itself, in the preamble to the 2020 Regulations, recognized that \n6 \n“weak sanctions against sexual violence perpetrators and weak laws and policies related to \n7 \n8  sexual violence and sex equality are associated with a greater likelihood of perpetration.” 85 Fed. \n9  Reg. at 30,070. \n10 \n72.  Because fewer incidents of sexual harassment will be investigated under the 2020 \n11 \nRegulations, the likelihood of this harassment being detected and addressed will also be reduced. \n12 \nThese decreases will have an appreciable impact on a school’s ability to deter future and \n13 \nrepeated sexually harassing conduct. \n14 \n73.  The Department, however, arbitrarily refused to conclude that the 2020 \n15 \n16  Regulations would have any effect on the underlying number of incidents of sexual harassment. \n17  It thus declined to consider the costs that would be borne by students and schools due to the \n18 \nincrease in harassment, despite the fact that such incidents have concrete and obvious costs. The \n19 \nDepartment deliberately refused to grapple with what it was sacrificing in order to achieve its \n20 \nintended benefits. \n21 \n74.  By ignoring the increased harassment and the attendant increased costs, the \n22 \nDepartment entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem that the statute was \n23 \n24  designed to address. \n25 \nAdditional Injuries Caused by the 2020 Regulations Specifically to WSU \n26 \n75.  The 2020 Regulations have already impaired and will continue to impair WSU’s \n27 \nability to bring Title IX violations to the attention of the Department for redress. This is because \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 19 of 24\n \n1  the Regulations deny WSU the opportunity of the Department’s Office for Civil Rights to \n2 \ninvestigate and resolve WSU’s Title IX complaints against its school district. \n3 \n76.  The Office for Civil Rights’ regulations require it to investigate any \n4 \nadministrative complaint it receives from a member of the public that indicates discrimination. \n5 \nThe regulations provide that a “responsible Department official or his designee will make a \n6 \nprompt investigation whenever a … complaint … indicates a possible failure to comply with this \n7 \n8  part. 34 C.F.R. 100.7(c) (emphasis added); see 34 C.F.R. 106.71 (Title IX regulation \n9  incorporating the procedural provisions of the Department’s Title VI regulations). If the \n10 \ninvestigation “indicates a failure to comply” with the regulations, the Office for Civil Rights \n11 \n“will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever \n12 \npossible.” 34 C.F.R. 106.7(c). \n13 \n77.  In February 2021, WSU filed an administrative complaint against Berkeley \n14 \nUnified School District with the Department’s Office for Civil Rights. That complaint alleged \n15 \n16  violations of Title IX that, under the 2020 Regulations, are no longer cognizable. The allegations \n17  include: \n18 \n•  Permitting harassment that is severe but not pervasive, including unwelcome \n19 \nexposure to others’ genitalia. \n20 \n•  Permitting harassment that is pervasive but not severe, including students’ \n21 \ncirculation of sexualized images of a classmate and regular comments by groups \n22 \n23  of students, usually young men, concerning the appearances and sexual histories \n24  of their classmates, usually young women. \n25 \n•  Failing to take steps to discover and remediate instances of commonplace \n26 \nharassment, such as that occurring in Zoom “breakout rooms,” digital spaces in \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 20 of 24\n \n1  which small groups or dyads of students converse on video without a teacher \n2 \npresent. \n3 \n•  Failing to investigate and address harassment that occurs off campus but impacts \n4 \nsurvivors’ education, including sexual assaults committed by students with whom \n5 \nthe victims share classes and, during COVID-19, harassing messages sent and \n6 \nreceived through students’ personal phones while students share online \n7 \n8  classrooms. \n9  •  Failing at times to respond to sexual harassment in a prompt and effective \n10 \nmanner, and instead, for example, tolerating the open presence of an informal \n11 \nclub dedicated to sexually harassing students and placing the burden on victims to \n12 \navoid contact with their harassers and even transfer out of shared classes, \n13 \nespecially when the underlying harassment occurred off campus. \n14 \n15  •  Failing to take action that addresses all the persons adversely affected by sexual \n16  harassment, not just the complainant. \n17 \n78.  Without a doubt, the Department’s Office for Civil Rights will not investigate \n18 \nWSU’s administrative complaint, and will not provide any relief to WSU and its members, \n19 \nbecause the 2020 Regulations no longer make it unlawful for purposes of administrative \n20 \nenforcement for the Berkeley Unified School District to disregard sexual harassment that is \n21 \nsevere but not pervasive (or pervasive but not severe); sexual harassment that originates outside \n22 \n23  the school’s “program or activity,” even though it impacts students’ ability to participate in the \n24  school’s program or activity; and sexual harassment that the school should reasonably know \n25 \nabout, but of which it lacks actual knowledge. Even for cognizable sexual harassment that the \n26 \nschool knows about, the 2020 Regulations do not require complete relief and, in fact, allow the \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 20 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 21 of 24\n \n1  school to respond unreasonably to the harassment, so long as its response is not clearly \n2 \nunreasonable. \n3 \n79.  The refusal of the Department’s Office for Civil Rights to open WSU’s complaint \n4 \nfor investigation in its entirety denies WSU the right it had prior to the 2020 Regulations to have \n5 \nits administrative complaint investigated. \n6 \n80.  Because WSU cannot count on the Office for Civil Rights to investigate the \n7 \n8  Berkeley Unified School District and spur changes to its policies and practices, to achieve its \n9  mission and attend school free from discrimination, WSU has no choice but to take actions that \n10 \nare both more time consuming and less effective, such as conducting their own investigations \n11 \ninto patterns of harassment at Berkeley Unified School District and meeting with school \n12 \nadministrators. These efforts have reduced the amount of time WSU can spend on its other \n13 \nefforts, such as developing consent education materials and expanding access to menstrual \n14 \nhygiene products.  \n15 \n16  81.  But for the Department’s 2020 Regulations, WSU’s complaint would be opened \n17  for investigation by the Office for Civil Rights.  \n18 \n82.  Even if the Office for Civil Rights were to open some or all of the allegations of \n19 \nWSU’s complaint for investigation, the Department’s 2020 Regulations do not require and, in \n20 \nfact, discourage Berkeley Unified School District from taking actions that were previously \n21 \nrequired under the Department’s prior interpretations of Title IX and that WSU wishes its school \n22 \nto take.  The 2020 Regulations themselves thus deprive WSU of a critical bargaining tool as it \n23 \n24  seeks to achieve these changes at Berkeley Unified School District as part of WSU’s \n25 \norganizational purpose. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 21 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 22 of 24\n \n1  CLAIM \n2 \nViolations of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) & (C) \n3 \n83.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint as \n4 \nthough fully set forth here.  \n5 \n84.  The 2020 Regulations are not in accordance with law and short of statutory right \n6 \nbecause the Department adopted provisions that are contrary to the text and purpose of Title IX. \n7 \n8  85.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because the Department \n9  changed its longstanding prior interpretations without sufficient justification for the change and, \n10 \nin some instances, without displaying awareness that it was changing its view.  \n11 \n86.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed \n12 \nto consider important aspects of the problem, including that the Regulations discourage students \n13 \nfrom filing complaints about sexual harassment with their schools and discourage schools from \n14 \nlearning about sexual harassment experienced by their students. \n15 \n16  87.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because, contrary to the \n17  evidence and in conflict with its own rationale about the effect of the regulations on school and \n18 \nstudent behavior, the Department refused to find that the provisions would increase the amount \n19 \nof sexual harassment that students would experience. The Department thus disregarded a factor \n20 \nthat Title IX itself made highly relevant and failed to consider an important aspect of the \n21 \nproblem. \n22 \n88.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because, without a satisfactory \n23 \n24  explanation, the Department imposed special limitations, procedures, and obstacles for sexual \n25 \nharassment claims that do not apply to any other sex discrimination claims under Title IX or to \n26 \nrace- and disability-based discrimination (including harassment) claims under Title VI, the \n27 \nRehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 22 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 1   Filed 03/08/21   Page 23 of 24\n \n1  89.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed \n2 \nto consider important aspects of the problem, including the disparate effect that the Regulations \n3 \nwill have on women and girls and LGBTQ students. \n4 \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n5   \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \n6 \n \n7  A.  Declare that Defendant’s 2020 Regulations are unlawful. \n8  B.  Enter a preliminary and permanent injunction holding unlawful and setting aside \n9 \nthe Regulations as arbitrary or capricious; in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n10 \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; or otherwise not in accordance \n11 \nwith law. \n12 \nC.  Award Plaintiff its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in the \n13 \nprosecution of this action; and \n14 \n15  D.  Award such other equitable and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n16 \nDate: March 8, 2021          Respectfully submitted, \n \n17 \n \n18    __/s/ Adele P. Kimmel____ \nSeth M.

Judge: Honorable Edward M. Chen \n7  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, \n8                    Defendant. \n9   \n10  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  \n11  FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF  \n12  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CASE \n13  Plaintiff, The Women’s Student Union, brings this action against the U.S. Department of \n14  Education seeking to set aside its 2020 Regulations – promulgated under the authority of then-\n15  Secretary Betsy DeVos – that reduce federal protections students enrolled in public school have \n16  from sexual harassment, including sexual violence, under Title IX of the Education Amendments \n17  of 1972.  \n18  INTRODUCTION \n19  1.  Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, has been too common an \n20  experience of students at public schools across the country. Women and LGBTQ students are \n21  more likely to experience such harassment than other student populations.  \n22  2.  Sexual harassment poses an obstacle to students’ ability to learn and thrive in \n23  school. When young people are sexually harassed by classmates or teachers, they avoid school \n24  and develop mistrust of educational institutions. Their academic performance suffers. They often \n25  drop classes or leave school altogether. And this is to say nothing of the lasting physical and \n26  psychological harm from sexual harassment. \n27  3.  Students experience these injuries not due to the harassment alone, but often \n28  because their schools fail to respond to the harassment promptly and appropriately.  \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 3 of 32\n \n1  4.  Just like young people at schools across the country, many high school students \n2  enrolled in California’s Berkeley Unified School District (“BUSD”) experience sexual \n3  harassment.  \n4  5.  For example, at Berkeley High School (“BHS”), students are often told they must \n5  either share a classroom with a student who sexually assaulted them off campus – or the victim \n6  must leave the class. Even when learning takes place primarily online, as it did in the 2020-2021 \n7  school year due to COVID-19, victims are required to be in small video “breakout rooms” with \n8  their harasser. \n9  6.  Such unchecked harassment is not inevitable. Title IX of the Education \n10  Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funds, is \n11  a critical federal law that students have long relied on as a tool for getting schools to address \n12  sexual harassment. \n13  7.  For decades, the U.S. Department of Education, which is the primary federal \n14  agency charged with enforcing Title IX, informed schools that they were responsible under Title \n15  IX for responding to any sexual harassment of students that they knew or should have known \n16  about, so long as the harassment was sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student’s \n17  ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program.  \n18  8.  In 2020, under the leadership of then-Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Department \n19  issued Regulations that purported to effectuate Title IX but, in fact, weakened key protections for \n20  those who experience sexual harassment and disincentivized school districts from learning about \n21  or responding to sexual harassment experienced by their students. See 85 Fed. Reg. 30,026 (May \n22  19, 2020) (codified at various places in 34 C.F.R. § 106). The 2020 Regulations went into effect \n23  August 14, 2020. \n24  9.  Without adequate justification or explanation, the Department undermined the \n25  existing sexual harassment framework by changing the “what,” “where,” “when,” and “how” of \n26  its prior interpretations of Title IX. \n27  10.  What: The 2020 Regulations constrict what misconduct constitutes unlawful \n28  sexual harassment that schools need to respond to under Title IX. Harassment can no longer \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 4 of 32\n \n1  trigger a school’s responsibilities to a victim merely due to its severity or its pervasiveness – both \n2  must be present.  \n3  11.  Where: The 2020 Regulations exclude from Title IX coverage sexual harassment \n4  of students by other students or faculty if the harassment took place off school grounds and was \n5  not part of a school program (such as a field trip). The fact that the harmful effects of the \n6  harassment are experienced by students while at school and diminish their educational \n7  opportunities is no longer sufficient. \n8  12.  When: The 2020 Regulations restrict when a school district is obligated to \n9  investigate and redress sexual harassment under Title IX. Now, the school district must only act \n10  when certain delimited school employees have actual knowledge of the harassment. The \n11  Regulations completely eliminate a school district’s responsibility when it should have known \n12  about the harassment, but did not actually know. \n13  13.  How: The 2020 Regulations alter how the Department will assess whether a \n14  school district complied with its obligation to investigate and redress harassment under Title IX. \n15  Instead of asking whether the school had taken prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated \n16  to end the harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and, as \n17  appropriate, remedy its effects, the Regulations require only that the school provide remedies \n18  designed to restore or preserve equal access to the student who complained about the harassment. \n19  And instead of asking whether a school had met its obligations under Title IX, the Department \n20  now asks only whether the school acted with deliberate indifference, i.e., in a clearly \n21  unreasonable way.  \n22  14.  The 2020 Regulations reduce schools’ incentives and hinder their abilities to take \n23  preventive or remedial action, and will therefore cause even more women and LGBTQ students \n24  to experience sexual harassment. \n25  15.  These regulatory changes are denying students the legal protections of Title IX \n26  that they previously enjoyed, and are denying WSU the benefit of having the Department \n27  investigate and redress many types of harassment its members and other students have \n28  experienced and are currently experiencing at BHS. \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 4 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 5 of 32\n \n1  PARTIES \n2  16.  Plaintiff, The Women’s Student Union (WSU), is an unincorporated association \n3  and an approved student body association of the Berkeley Unified School District of Berkeley, \n4  California.  \n5  17.  Defendant is the U.S. Department of Education. The Department implements \n6  Title IX through issuing regulations and guidance documents and is tasked with administrative \n7  enforcement of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1682. Its principal address is 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., \n8  Washington, D.C. 20202. \n9  JURISDICTION \n10  18.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because it arises under \n11  federal law, e.g., Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Administrative \n12  Procedure Act (APA). This Court also has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2) \n13  because a department of the United States is a defendant. \n14  VENUE \n15  19.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because \n16  WSU resides (i.e., maintains its principal place of business, id. § 1391(c)(2)) in this District and \n17  no real property is involved in the action. \n18  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n19  20.  Venue is proper in either the San Francisco or Oakland Division pursuant to Civil \n20  Local Rule 3 2(d) because this action arises in Alameda County. \n21  ALLEGATIONS \n22  21.  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides, subject to certain \n23  exceptions not relevant here, that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be \n24  excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \n25  any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n26  Title IX defines “program or activity” in relevant part as “all of the operations” of a school, “any \n27  part of which is extended Federal financial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1687. \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 5 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 6 of 32\n \n1  22.  For nearly 50 years, this federal law has given students a critical civil rights tool \n2  to fight sex discrimination and promote equal access to educational benefits and opportunities. \n3  While these protections extend to all students, they have been particularly beneficial to girls and \n4  women, who had been historically excluded from many educational programs and opportunities.  \n5  23.  It is settled by multiple decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court that Title IX’s \n6  prohibition against sex discrimination includes protection against sexual harassment that can be \n7  enforced in federal court by injured students through an implied private right of action for \n8  compensatory damages and injunctive relief. See Davis v. Monroe Cty Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. \n9  629 (1999); Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274 (1998); Franklin v. Gwinnett \n10  Cty. Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60 (1992); Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979). In order \n11  to recover damages in a court action, a private plaintiff must show that a school district had \n12  actual knowledge of the harassment and acted with deliberate indifference. \n13  24.  But Title IX is also administratively enforced by federal agencies that disburse \n14  funds to educational institutions. Congress “authorized and directed” federal agencies that \n15  provide financial assistance to education programs or activities to “effectuate the provisions of” \n16  Title IX “by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.” 20 U.S.C. § 1682. \n17  While such rules, regulations, or orders are not always enforceable through the private right of \n18  action, unresolved violations can result in the Department withholding federal education funds or \n19  a lawsuit. 20 U.S.C. § 1682.  \n20  25.  For decades, and through multiple Administrations, the U.S. Department of \n21  Education, through its Office for Civil Rights, has been the primary federal agency charged with \n22  enforcing Title IX administratively and has issued consistent guidance to school districts about \n23  how it interpreted Title IX in the context of sexual harassment.  \n24  26.  Among the Department’s Guidances are two that went through notice and \n25  comment – Sexual Harassment Guidance, 62 Fed. Reg. 12,034 (Mar. 13, 1997) (“1997 \n26  Guidance”); Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance, 66 Fed. Reg. 5,512 (Jan. 19, 2001), available \n27  at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/shguide.html (“2001 Guidance”) – and a \n28  series of others issued by both Democratic and Republic Administrations, including: \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 7 of 32\n \n1  •  Sexual Harassment: It’s Not Academic (1988), \n2  https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED330265.pdf. \n3  •  Dear Colleague Letter (Jan. 25, 2006), \n4  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/sexhar-2006.html. \n5  •  Dear Colleague Letter: Harassment and Bullying (Oct. 26, 2010), \n6  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html.  \n7  •  Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence (Apr. 4, 2011), \n8  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf.  \n9  •  Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence (Apr. 29, 2014), \n10  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title-ix.pdf. \n11  •  Q&A on Campus Sexual Misconduct (Sept. 22, 2017), \n12  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-title-ix-201709.pdf.  \n13  27.  The Department’s harassment Guidances concerning sexual harassment \n14  consistently rejected the view that the standards adopted by courts to determine whether a private \n15  damages action could be brought against a school should be incorporated into the administrative \n16  enforcement process it oversees.  \n17  28.  Although they varied in their level of detail and emphasis, these Guidances \n18  informed schools of the Department’s consistent view that:  \n19  (1)  unlawful “sexual harassment” means unwelcome conduct that denies or limits a \n20  student’s ability to participate in or benefit from the school’s program based on \n21  sex and can include conduct that is severe, persistent, or pervasive – in other \n22  words, sufficiently serious that it adversely affects a student’s ability to participate \n23  in or benefit from the school’s program;  \n24  (2)  schools are required to address all harassing conduct that creates a hostile \n25  environment in an education program or activity, even if the conduct occurs \n26  outside an education program or activity;  \n27  (3)  schools are responsible for any sexual harassment of students that they knew or, \n28  in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known about; and  \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 8 of 32\n \n1  (4)  schools must take prompt and effective action to end the unlawful harassment, \n2  prevent it from recurring, and remedy its effects.  \n3  29.  Other than the definition of sexual harassment, all these requirements also applied \n4  to all other forms of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX, such as guidance counselors \n5  steering students of different sexes to different classes, teachers grading students more or less \n6  harshly on the basis of sex, or retaliation for raising concerns of sex discrimination. \n7  30.  All these requirements were also consistent with the Department’s Guidances \n8  concerning schools’ responsibilities under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 \n9  of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to \n10  address race- and disability-based harassment, including: \n11  •  Racial Incidents and Harassment Against Students at Educational Institutions; \n12  Investigative Guidance, 59 Fed. Reg. 11,448 (Mar. 10, 1994), \n13  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/race394.html. \n14  •  Dear Colleague Letter on Prohibited Disability Harassment (July 25, 2000), \n15  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/disabharassltr.html. \n16  •  Dear Colleague Letter: Harassment and Bullying (Oct. 26, 2010), \n17  https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html.  \n18  31.  The Department’s harassment Guidances around race and disability consistently \n19  rejected the view that the standards adopted by courts to determine whether a private damages \n20  action could be brought against a school should be incorporated into the administrative \n21  enforcement process it oversees. \n22  32.  The Department continues to apply its traditional standards to students’ claims of \n23  race and disability harassment. But, after the Department’s 2020 Regulations, the same is not \n24  true for sexual harassment.  \n25  33.  Without adequate justification or explanation, the Department’s 2020 Regulations \n26  – under then-Secretary Betsy DeVos – reduce protections to students from sexual harassment \n27  with regard to each of these elements by narrowly redefining “sexual harassment,” “program or \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 9 of 32\n \n1  activity,” and “notice,” and limiting its examination of whether schools had met their remedial \n2  obligations.  \n3  34.  Indeed, the Department acknowledged in the preamble to the 2020 Regulations \n4  that schools under the new Regulations will be required to engage in fewer investigations of \n5  sexual harassment, and thus will find fewer violations and provide fewer remedies. This was \n6  viewed as feature, not a flaw, of the Regulations.  \n7  35.  Although the Department refused to acknowledge it, the inevitable result of fewer \n8  investigations and fewer remedies will be an increase in the amount of sexual harassment, as \n9  would-be harassers will no longer be deterred by fear of being caught and disciplined, or have \n10  the opportunity to learn to change their behavior thanks to an educational intervention. Yet the \n11  Department never grappled with the tradeoff between increased sexual harassment and the \n12  purported benefits it attributed to the Regulations. \n13  36.  With the changes adopted by the 2020 Regulations, the Department provides less \n14  protection to students who experience sexual harassment than to students who experience other \n15  forms of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX, as well as race discrimination (including \n16  harassment) prohibited under Title VI and disability discrimination (including harassment) \n17  prohibited under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The \n18  Department offered no justification or evidence that would support a weaker standard for sexual \n19  harassment relative to all other forms of discrimination and harassment.  \n20  Limiting what constitutes sexual harassment under Title IX \n21  37.  The 2020 Regulations adopted a novel and narrow definition of “sexual \n22  harassment” that is inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and excludes multiple forms of \n23  misconduct that interfere with equal access to educational opportunities. \n24  38.  The 2020 Regulations define sexual harassment as conduct on the basis of sex \n25  that is unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so “severe, pervasive, and \n26  objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education \n27  program or activity.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.30 (emphasis added).  \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 10 of 32\n \n1  39.  Without adequate justification or explanation, this new definition substantially \n2  departs from the traditional definition for sexual harassment (and race- and disability-based \n3  harassment) that the Department has instructed schools to apply for more than two decades.  \n4  40.  The Department previously defined unlawful sexual harassment as unwelcome \n5  conduct of a sexual nature that “is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a student’s \n6  ability to participate in or benefit from an education program or activity.” (emphasis added).  \n7  41.  Under this traditional definition, the Department applied a sliding scale: a single \n8  or isolated incident of sexual harassment could, if sufficiently severe, constitute unlawful sexual \n9  harassment without being repetitive or ongoing in nature, whereas less severe but ongoing or \n10  pervasive conduct that limited a student was also considered to be unlawful harassment \n11  prohibited by Title IX. \n12  42.  Under the 2020 Regulations, however, a school is no longer required to \n13  investigate and remedy an egregious but isolated incident of sexual harassment (unless it falls \n14  within the 2020 Regulations’ definition of “sexual assault” or quid pro quo harassment) because \n15  such harassment is no longer sufficiently “pervasive” to fall within the Rule’s narrowed \n16  definition of sexual harassment. Misconduct such as indecent exposure, a request for sexual \n17  favors, some kinds of unwanted touching, and sharing of sexual images and videos are likely all \n18  excluded under the 2020 Regulations. Yet this conduct can produce the very exclusionary effects \n19  that the text of Title IX proscribes.  \n20  43.  Conversely, misconduct that is pervasive but not independently severe – such as \n21  some persistent sexual comments about a student’s body – would likewise be excluded. This \n22  conduct, too, can produce the very exclusionary effects that the text of Title IX proscribes.  \n23  44.  The 2020 Regulations further narrow sexual harassment to conduct that \n24  “effectively denies a person equal access” to education. Title IX protects students from being \n25  “excluded from participation in,” “denied the benefits of,” and “subjected to discrimination \n26  under” a program or activity. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Nonetheless, contrary to the statutory text, \n27  and without a reasoned explanation, the Regulations provide that only students who are \n28  “effectively denied” access are protected from misconduct.  \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 11 of 32\n \n1  45.  Only a small portion of sexual harassment of students is reported to school \n2  authorities. Students often choose not to report because they think the harassment is not serious \n3  enough or that no one would do anything to help. The 2020 Regulations’ narrowed definition of \n4  “sexual harassment” will undoubtedly reduce reporting even further as students reasonably fear \n5  that schools will not provide any meaningful response if they file a report.  \n6  Limiting where Title IX’s protections apply \n7  46.  The 2020 Regulations adopted a novel and narrow definition of “program or \n8  activity” for sexual harassment that is inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and excludes \n9  multiple forms of misconduct that interfere with equal access to educational opportunities. \n10  47.  This definition is inconsistent with the definition the Department uses for all other \n11  forms of sex discrimination, and for race or disability discrimination (including harassment). \n12  48.  In the context of sexual harassment, a school is only responsible for sexual \n13  harassment “in” its “program or activity;” and “program or activity” is defined to “include[ ] \n14  locations, events, or circumstances over which the recipient exercised substantial control over \n15  both the respondent and the context in which the sexual harassment occurs, and also includes any \n16  building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by a \n17  postsecondary institution.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.44(a). \n18  49.  Without adequate justification or explanation, this new definition substantially \n19  departs from the traditional definition for sexual harassment that the Department has instructed \n20  schools to apply. The Department previously required schools to investigate harassment that \n21  occurred or originated off campus to determine whether the effects of that harassment are \n22  affecting a student’s access to a school’s program or activity. \n23  50.  This new definition is not in accordance with the statute. Title IX does not require \n24  that the harassment take place “in” an education program or activity. Title IX is not concerned \n25  with where the underlying conduct occurred, but whether the person is “denied the benefits of, or \n26  [is] subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.”  \n27  51.  Sexual harassment can often occur in the first instance outside the “substantial \n28  control” of a school but nonetheless can deny students educational benefits and exclude them \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 12 of 32\n \n1  from equal participation. Focusing on the location of the harassment, and not its effects on the \n2  student, leads to absurd results. For example, a school would have no responsibility to respond \n3  under the 2020 Regulations when a student or teacher sexually assaults another student so long \n4  as the assault occurred off school grounds and not during a school activity. And yet, even if the \n5  conduct results in the student becoming too afraid to attend the class taught by, or shared with, \n6  the victim’s assailant, the 2020 Regulations immunize the school from any responsibility. \n7  52.  Online harassment is another circumstance where the 2020 Regulations would \n8  lead to absurd results. Such online sexual harassment is particularly prevalent in high schools. \n9  Yet, under the 2020 Regulations, whether a school must respond to such misconduct will depend \n10  on whether the device used to harass is school-owned or privately-provided, whether the device \n11  is using the school’s Wi-Fi or not, or whether the device is on or off school grounds when the \n12  harassing message is sent. From the student on the receiving end, however, the effect is the same. \n13  This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, since remote learning has further blurred \n14  the line between harassment “in” and “out” of school. And harassers will learn that they can \n15  avoid accountability at school by simply targeting students using personal devices off school \n16  grounds. \n17  53.  Only a small portion of sexual harassment of students is reported to school \n18  authorities. The 2020 Regulations’ narrowed definition of “program or activity” will leave \n19  students uncertain about whether their school will investigate their complaint, particularly when \n20  those students are unlikely to know the location of the harasser or the device used. This will \n21  undoubtedly reduce reporting even further. \n22  Limiting when a school district is responsible for sexual harassment  \n23  affecting students in its programs \n24  54.  The 2020 Regulations adopted a novel requirement of “actual knowledge” for \n25  sexual harassment that is inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and will exclude from \n26  Title IX’s coverage significant amounts of misconduct that interfere with equal access to \n27  educational opportunities. \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 13 of 32\n \n1  55.  This requirement is inconsistent with the requirement the Department uses for all \n2  other forms of sex discrimination, and for race or disability discrimination (including \n3  harassment). \n4  56.  The 2020 Regulations provide that elementary and secondary schools will only be \n5  responsible for addressing sexual harassment when a school employee has “actual knowledge” of \n6  the harassment or allegations of the harassment. 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.30(a), 106.44(a).  \n7  57.  Without adequate justification or explanation, this new requirement substantially \n8  departs from the traditional position of the Department, which required schools to address sexual \n9  harassment if almost any school employee either “knew or should reasonably have known” about \n10  a student-on-student incident or an employee-on-student incident that occurred outside the \n11  context of the employee’s provision of aid, benefits, and services to students. \n12  58.  Under the 2020 Regulations, schools will lack the incentives to develop systems \n13  to detect sexual harassment and to encourage students to report sexual harassment. To the \n14  contrary, schools and their employees will be incentivized to avoid having “actual knowledge” of \n15  sexual harassment so that they are not required to address it – even if they believe or have reason \n16  to believe that a student is experiencing the adverse effects of harassment. \n17  Limiting how the Department will determine whether a school district \n18  has appropriately responded to sexual harassment under Title IX \n19  59.  The 2020 Regulations adopted truncated and exceedingly deferential requirements \n20  about the remedies a school needs to provide after it determines there has been unlawful sexual \n21  harassment that are inconsistent with Title IX’s text and purpose, and do not address the school-\n22  wide effects that can result from such harassment.  \n23  60.  The 2020 Regulations require a school to provide students who experienced \n24  unlawful sexual harassment and complained about it “remedies designed to restore or preserve \n25  equal access” and may impose “disciplinary sanctions” on a student found responsible for \n26  harassment after following an elaborate grievance procedure. 34 C.F.R. § 106.45(b)(1)(i). The \n27  Regulations further provide that the Department will find a school violated its remedial \n28  obligations only if it responded in a manner that is “deliberately indifferent.” 34 C.F.R. \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 14 of 32\n \n1  § 106.44(a). The Department will find a school is deliberately indifferent only “if its response to \n2  sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.” Id. \n3  61.  Without adequate justification or explanation, these new limitations substantially \n4  depart from the traditional position of the Department, which required schools, after a finding of \n5  unlawful sexual harassment, to take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the \n6  harassment, eliminate the hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and, as appropriate, \n7  remedy its effects.  \n8  62.  The Department does not impose these limitations for all other forms of sex \n9  discrimination, or for race or disability discrimination (including harassment). \n10  63.  Just addressing the harm caused by unlawful sexual harassment to the student \n11  who complains is insufficient. Interventions for an entire class or school may be necessary to \n12  eliminate the hostile environment created by the harassment that only a single student \n13  complained of. Such remedies serve to eliminate the effects the discrimination had on the \n14  program, not just the parties to a specific complaint.  \n15  64.  The 2020 Regulations permit a school to respond unreasonably to complaints of \n16  sexual harassment, so long as its response is not “clearly” unreasonable. This safe harbor for \n17  schools is inappropriately restrictive and will lead to more inappropriate responses to known \n18  harassment.  \n19  The Department’s complaint process grants persons procedural rights to an investigation and \n20  resolution of timely written complaints that indicate a possible failure to comply with the \n21  Department’s Title IX regulations \n22  65.  In 1975, when it first adopted its Title IX regulations, the Department of \n23  Education incorporated an existing regulation establishing a complaint process to address private \n24  complaints that a recipient of federal funds is discriminating. 34 C.F.R. § 106.71 (Title IX \n25  regulation incorporating the procedural provisions of the Department’s Title VI regulations, 34 \n26  C.F.R. §§ 100.7-100.8). Those regulations grant persons like WSU and its members procedural \n27  rights to an investigation of a written complaint (if the complaint indicates a failure of a recipient \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 15 of 32\n \n1  to comply with the regulations) and a written notice of the reasons for the disposition of the \n2  complaint.  \n3  66.  The Office for Civil Rights has issued a Case Processing Manual (“CPM”), \n4  available at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ocrcpm.pdf. The most recent \n5  version, and the version in effect when WSU filed its complaint, was issued on August 26, 2020. \n6  The Case Processing Manual “provides OCR staff and stakeholders with information regarding \n7  how OCR promptly and effectively investigates and resolves complaints.”  CPM at 2.  \n8  67.  The Department’s regulations authorize “[a]ny person who believes himself or \n9  any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by [the regulations]” \n10  to file “a written complaint” with the Department’s Office for Civil Rights. 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(b). \n11  The Department has thus created an administrative procedure open to all persons to file \n12  complaints on behalf of themselves or on behalf of a “specific class of individuals.”   \n13  68.  Although the regulations do not define the term “person,” the U.S. Department of \n14  Justice has stated that a “private entity,” regardless of corporate status, is a “person” protected by \n15  Title VI, which is the statute that the Department of Education’s regulations were initially \n16  intended to effectuate. See U.S. Department of Justice, Title VI Legal Manual, § V.A at 1-2 \n17  (citing Carnell Const. Corp. v. Danville Redevelopment & Hous. Auth., 745 F.3d 703, 714 (4th \n18  Cir. 2014); Hudson Valley Freedom Theater, Inc. v. Heimbach, 671 F.2d 702, 705 (2d Cir. 1982) \n19  (Friendly, J.)), available at https://www.justice.gov/crt/book/file/1364106/download. The \n20  Department of Justice also states in its Manual that even if an entity is not a “person” for \n21  purposes of the statute (because it is a state instrumentality, for example), “this should not \n22  preclude” such an entity from bringing an “administrative complaint either on its own behalf or \n23  on behalf of its students or other constituents.” Id. § V.A at 3. \n24  69.  The Case Processing Manual provides that the Office for Civil Rights “will \n25  promptly acknowledge, in writing, the receipt of the complaint. OCR will also inform the \n26  complainant that the complaint will be evaluated to determine whether OCR will proceed to \n27  investigate the allegations and that further communications about complaint processing will be \n28  forthcoming.” CPM § 104. \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 15 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 16 of 32\n \n1  70.  The Case Processing Manual further provides that the Office for Civil Rights will \n2  seek written consent to reveal the complainant’s identity to the recipient and witnesses when it is \n3  necessary in order to investigate and resolve the complaint. Id. § 104. The Office for Civil \n4  Rights’ consent form, available at https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/edlite-\n5  consentform.html, instructs that the complainant should sign the form if it “filed the complaint \n6  on behalf of yourself” or “on behalf of a class of people, rather than any specific person.”  This \n7  form confirms that complainant need not be the person experiencing the effects of the violation \n8  of the regulations in order to have a procedural right to file a complaint with the Office for Civil \n9  Rights. \n10  71.  Once a timely written complaint is received, the Department’s regulations \n11  mandate that the Office for Civil Rights investigate a complaint whenever the complaint \n12  indicates a possible failure to comply with the regulations. The regulations provide that the \n13  Office for Civil Rights “will make a prompt investigation whenever a … complaint … indicates a \n14  possible failure to comply with this part,” 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(c) (emphases added), and further \n15  identify elements that the investigation “should” include. The text of this regulatory provision \n16  thus evidences the Department’s distinction between what the Office for Civil Rights must do \n17  whenever a complaint indicates a possible failure to comply (make a prompt investigation) and \n18  how it should do it.  \n19  72.  Although not using the regulatory language, the Case Processing Manual \n20  provides detail about how the Office for Civil Rights evaluates whether a complaint “indicates a \n21  possible failure to comply” with the regulations. The Office for Civil Rights claims the right to \n22  dismiss a complaint if it “lacks sufficient factual detail (e.g., who, what, where, when, how)” so \n23  that “OCR cannot infer that discrimination or retaliation may have occurred or may be \n24  occurring.”  CPM § 108(b). But before it does so, the Office for Civil Rights “will contact” the \n25  complainant and “explain the information necessary for OCR to open an investigation” and only \n26  dismiss if the complaint is insufficient “on its face or as clarified.” Id. The Case Processing \n27  Manual further provides that at the conclusion of the evaluation process the Office for Civil \n28  Rights “will” issue a letter to the complainant reporting that it has decided to open a complaint \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 16 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 17 of 32\n \n1  for investigation, id. § 111, or “explaining the reason for the decision” to dismiss the complaint \n2  without investigation, id. § 108. \n3  73.  If the investigation finds no violation, the Office for Civil Rights “will so inform \n4  the recipient and complainant, if any, in writing.”  34 C.F.R. § 100.7(d)(2). But if the \n5  investigation “indicates a failure to comply” with the regulations, the Office for Civil Rights \n6  “will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever \n7  possible.” 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(d)(1). The Case Processing Manual requires that the Office for \n8  Civil Rights also inform the complainant when it plans to resolve the complaint by informal \n9  means. CPM §§ 302, 303(b), 303(e). In this context, “informal means” refers primarily to the \n10  Office for Civil Rights entering into a binding agreement with the recipient that resolves any \n11  failures to comply, which the Case Processing Manual refers to as a resolution agreement. \n12  74.  If the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, “actions will be taken [by the \n13  Office for Civil Rights] as provided in § 100.8,” 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(d)(1), which identifies \n14  “suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance;” or \n15  “by any other means authorized by law,” which includes, but is not limited to, “reference to the \n16  Department of Justice with a recommendation” to file a lawsuit against the recipient. 34 C.F.R. \n17  § 100.8(a). The Case Processing Manual likewise explains that if the Office for Civil Rights \n18  finds that the recipient has violated the regulation and the recipient will not enter into a \n19  resolution agreement with the Office for Civil Rights, the Office for Civil Rights “will either  \n20  (1) initiate administrative proceedings to suspend, terminate, or refuse to grant or continue \n21  financial assistance from … the Department to the recipient; or (2) refer the case to DOJ for \n22  judicial proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United \n23  States.” Art. VI (emphasis added).  \n24  75.  To avoid the threat of fund termination or a lawsuit, school districts almost always \n25  are willing to resolve a matter by informal means by settling with the Department during or after \n26  an administrative investigation by agreeing to address sexual harassment through individual \n27  relief and systemic change. \n28   \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 18 of 32\n \n1  The Women’s Student Union and its members \n2  76.  WSU is an approved student body association of the Berkeley Unified School \n3  District of Berkeley, California as described in California Education Code §48930. Under \n4  California Corporation Code §18035, it is an unincorporated association. In less technical terms, \n5  it is a student club at BHS.  \n6  77.  WSU currently has approximately 75 members, all of whom are students at BHS. \n7  78.  WSU’s mission is to advocate to address barriers to success and wellbeing for \n8  young women and non-binary students at BHS, including, but not limited to, its members.  \n9  79.  WSU’s mission includes reducing sexual harassment experienced by students of \n10  BHS by (1) advocating that the school district adopt policies to protect its members and the \n11  student body from sex discrimination, including sexual harassment; and (2) providing training to \n12  the student body about sexual consent as well as their rights and responsibilities under school \n13  policy, state law, and federal law.  \n14  80.  Addressing sexual harassment at BHS is a pressing issue for WSU because such \n15  harassment negatively affects its members, as well as other women and non-binary students on \n16  whose behalf WSU advocates to advance its mission. \n17  BUSD’s ongoing refusal to change course on sexual harassment \n18  81.  Sexual harassment is not a new issue at BUSD. Over at least the last decade, \n19  students and parents have repeatedly asked BUSD to improve its handling of sexual harassment \n20  against students. But BUSD has failed to implement meaningful policy changes in response. See, \n21  e.g., Holly McDede, How Generations of Berkeley High Students Forced a Reckoning About \n22  Sexual Abuse, KQED (Mar. 24, 2021), https://www.kqed.org/news/11864769/how-generations-\n23  of-berkeley-high-students-forced-a-reckoning-about-sexual-abuse.  \n24  82.  BUSD has also been the subject of multiple private lawsuits for money damages \n25  concerning BUSD’s response to the sexual harassment of students by classmates and staff. See, \n26  e.g., “Worst moments of my life.” Former Berkeley High student alleges repeated abuse by \n27  teacher, San Francisco Chronicle (July 15, 2021), \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 19 of 32\n \n1  https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Worst-moments-of-my-life-Former-Berkeley-\n2  16318180.php.  \n3  83.  The problems are not one-off, but systemic. Between 2014 and 2020, BUSD had \n4  at least six different Title IX Coordinators. One of those Title IX Coordinators, a career \n5  compliance officer who quit after only six months in the job, was “appalled” by BUSD’s lack of \n6  support for her office, which she later said was in “shambles” when she joined; BUSD, she says, \n7  refused to rectify the problems she raised. See Ally Markovich, She tried to reform Berkeley \n8  Unified’s Title IX office. After six months of frustration, she quit, Berkeleyside (Sept. 8, 2021), \n9  https://www.berkeleyside.org/2021/09/08/she-tried-to-reform-berkeley-unifieds-title-ix-office-\n10  after-6-months-of-frustration-she-quit. At one point in 2020, the BHS principal publicly begged \n11  the BUSD school board to provide her with the resources necessary to address sexual harassment \n12  of students. See Natalie Orenstein, Anger, fear at Berkeley High in wake of sexual assault \n13  accusations, Berkeleyside (Feb. 6, 2020), https://www.berkeleyside.org/2020/02/06/anger-fear-\n14  at-berkeley-high-in-wake-of-sexual-assault-accusations.  \n15  84.  These issues came to a head in 2020 when students organized a “walk out,” in \n16  which much of the student body left class to protest BUSD’s failures to address sexual \n17  harassment. In the wake of that protest, BUSD committed to changing its ways. Yet, to WSU’s \n18  knowledge, BUSD has not revised its sexual harassment policies for the better in the 20 months \n19  since students protested.  \n20  85.  To the contrary, since the 2020 Regulations went into effect, BUSD has doubled \n21  down on its policies of inaction. Notably, BUSD has publicly represented that it will not \n22  investigate reports of sexual harassment that occur off campus, even if that harassment creates a \n23  hostile environment on campus. It attributed that restriction to Title IX—presumably a reference \n24  to the 2020 Regulations. See Megha Krishnan, Berkeley Unified School District addresses sexual \n25  harassment concerns, Daily Californian (Dec. 13, 2020), \n26  https://www.dailycal.org/2020/12/13/berkeley-unified-school-district-addresses-sexual-\n27  harassment-concerns. \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 20 of 32\n \n1  WSU’s members and other students have experienced injuries  \n2  that are no longer cognizable under the 2020 Regulations \n3  86.  Prior to the 2020 Regulations, WSU and its members could have taken their \n4  experiences of sexual harassment to the Department’s Office for Civil Rights in the form of a \n5  Title IX administrative complaint and obtained an investigation and resolution of their claims. \n6  But the 2020 Regulations have rendered the process futile because the unchecked harassment \n7  and deficient school responses that WSU, its members, and other BHS students have experienced \n8  after August 14, 2020 – which WSU and its members have complained or would like to \n9  complain about to the Office for Civil Rights – no longer violate the Department’s Title IX \n10  regulations. The Office for Civil Rights is closed for business when it comes to the allegations \n11  WSU has pressed, and those it would like to press, concerning sexual harassment that has \n12  occurred post-August 14, 2020. \n13  87.  Definitional Change: Much of the sexual harassment that WSU members and \n14  other BHS students experience does not meet the 2020 Regulations’ definition of actionable \n15  harassment.  \n16  88.  Before and since the 2020 Regulations went into effect, many WSU members and \n17  other BHS students have been subjected to unwanted sexual comments about their bodies while \n18  in class or walking through the halls of BHS. Often, no single classmate makes more than one \n19  comment to any given student, but the target receives multiple comments from multiple \n20  classmates that, together, create a hostile environment. The 2020 Regulations, however, \n21  redefined sexual harassment by removing schools’ obligations to address hostile environments \n22  and now require schools to dismiss – for purposes of Title IX – any investigation into an \n23  individual who is not alleged to have committed harassment that is “severe and pervasive.” As a \n24  result, BUSD need not investigate hostile environment sexual harassment, and any Title IX \n25  complaint WSU might file about BUSD’s failure to do so would not “indicate[] a possible failure \n26  to comply with” the 2020 Regulations, 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(c), and so would not trigger an Office \n27  for Civil Rights investigation and resolution.  \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 20 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 21 of 32\n \n1  89.  On one occasion since the start of the school year, in or around September 2021, \n2  “John,” a student at BHS, harassed WSU member “Jamie” in their shared class. During class, \n3  without invitation, John told Jamie and a small group of other classmates explicit details about \n4  his penis, and shared information regarding what he thinks constitutes a “good” penis. Because \n5  this conduct was severe but not pervasive – since it only occurred once – the 2020 Regulations \n6  do not require BUSD to respond to this harassment and similarly do not permit the Office for \n7  Civil Rights to require BUSD to investigate or remediate the harassment or its effects. (Jamie has \n8  not reported the incidents to the school because they know BUSD has taken no meaningful \n9  action when other students have reported John for more severe sexual harassment. Jamie’s lack \n10  of faith in BUSD is also informed by their experience telling a teacher about other sexual \n11  harassment they experienced their freshman year; the teacher refused to let them change their \n12  seat to move away from the harasser, asked no questions about what had occurred, and provided \n13  no other assistance.) \n14  90.  Changed Geographic Limitations: Much of the sexual harassment that WSU \n15  members and other BHS students experience occurs off BUSD property, and outside of any \n16  school activity, but creates a hostile environment in school.  \n17  91.  For example, during the fall of 2020 and winter of 2021, WSU member “Jane” \n18  was sexually harassed outside of school hours and off school grounds by a student with whom \n19  she shared a class, John – the same student who has sexually harassed Jamie, who has been \n20  reported to BUSD for sexual harassment before, and whose pattern of sexual harassment is well \n21  known among the student body. John repeatedly texted Jane, often making unwanted sexual \n22  comments about her body, and especially her breasts. In just one night in March 2021, Jane \n23  received eight calls, eight direct messages on Instagram, and eight text messages from him. \n24  Although John sent his texts from off school grounds and mostly outside school hours, they \n25  made Jane uncomfortable sharing a class with him. (Jane did not report the harassment to BUSD \n26  because, based on her classmates’ experiences reporting harassment to BUSD, she did not \n27  believe BUSD would take any action in response.) \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 21 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 22 of 32\n \n1  92.  Further, WSU member Jamie, a senior at BHS, has been harassed by John on a \n2  public bus that both students take to school. (The bus is not run or affiliated with BUSD but it is \n3  used by many BHS students to travel to school.) On approximately five separate occasions since \n4  the start of the 2021-22 school year, John has sat next to Jamie and made unwanted sexual \n5  comments, including sharing explicit details of his sex life and asking Jamie invasive questions \n6  about their sexual preferences. John will sometimes touch Jamie’s legs and shoulders while \n7  making unwanted sexual comments, which makes Jamie uncomfortable, but Jamie is unable to \n8  move away from John because they are stuck between John and the bus window. Jamie shares \n9  several classes with John, and John’s sexual harassment on the bus makes Jamie uncomfortable \n10  in those classes. (Jamie has not reported this harassment to BUSD for the same reasons they have \n11  not reported John’s harassment in class, described in paragraph 89.) Because the harassment took \n12  place on a public bus, outside BUSD’s program or activity, the 2020 Regulations do not require \n13  BUSD to respond to this harassment, even though the harassment creates a hostile environment \n14  for Jamie in school, and similarly do not permit the Office for Civil Rights to require BUSD to \n15  investigate or remediate the harassment or its effects. \n16  93.  As explained above, as a matter of announced policy, BUSD will not investigate \n17  reports of sexual harassment that occur off campus, even if that harassment creates a hostile \n18  environment on campus, and appears to attribute that decision to the 2020 Regulations. On \n19  information and belief, BUSD has acted in accordance with this policy in addressing other \n20  instances of sexual harassment post-August 14, 2020.  \n21  94.  BUSD was required to respond to this kind of harassment under OCR’s previous \n22  interpretation of Title IX. But because of the 2020 Regulations, BUSD need not address off-\n23  campus sexual harassment that occurs outside a school activity and which creates a hostile \n24  environment at BHS. As a result, any Title IX complaint WSU might file about BUSD’s failure \n25  to do so would not “indicate[] a possible failure to comply with” the 2020 Regulations, 34 C.F.R. \n26  § 100.7(c), and so would not trigger an Office for Civil Rights investigation and resolution.  \n27  95.  Indeed, as applied, the Office for Civil Rights has dismissed complaints when the \n28  alleged sexual assault did not occur within the school’s education program or activity—exactly \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 22 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 23 of 32\n \n1  as the 2020 Regulations require. See Letter of Dismissal from Office for Civil Rights regarding \n2  Dickinson College, No. 03-21-2082, at 1 (Feb. 24, 2021) (“The incident you reported did not \n3  occur within the College’s education program or activity. As such, the College did not have an \n4  obligation to provide a response to you that complies with the requirements of Title IX.”). \n5  96.  Changes to the Knowledge Standard: Much of the sexual harassment that WSU \n6  members and other BHS students experience is not reported to BUSD officials, but is harassment \n7  that BUSD should know about. That is, it is harassment of which BUSD has constructive but not \n8  actual knowledge.  \n9  97.  Every day, BHS students, including WSU members, are subjected to unwanted, \n10  sexualized comments in school hallways and classrooms. Under the Office for Civil Rights’ \n11  previous constructive knowledge standard, that would have been sufficient to impute knowledge \n12  of the harassment to BUSD. See 2001 Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance at 13-14. Now, in \n13  order to successfully seek relief from the Office for Civil Rights, a complainant must provide the \n14  name of a specific teacher or other staff member that witnessed (or was told about) the \n15  harassment before the Office will open an investigation. See paragraph 110 below. \n16  98.  During remote learning, a student is required to spend unsupervised time alone \n17  with another student in a Zoom “breakout room,” digital spaces in which students converse on \n18  video without a teacher present. WSU cannot allege that any teacher had actual knowledge of \n19  sexual harassment between particular students in these Zoom breakout rooms. But WSU member \n20  Jane understood from a teacher that a supermajority of the girls in one of the classes she shared \n21  with John during the 2020-2021 academic year requested not to share a Zoom breakout room \n22  with him. The requests by numerous girls not to be paired with a single boy would have been \n23  enough prior to the 2020 Regulations to find that the school should have aware of possible sexual \n24  harassment and taken steps to inquire. But because WSU does not have reason to believe the \n25  teacher was expressly told by those other girls that their requests regarding John were based on \n26  sexual harassment, WSU cannot allege that the teacher had actual knowledge that John had \n27  harassed those other girls and so cannot, under the 2020 Regulations, ask the Office for Civil \n28  Rights to provide relief for BUSD’s failure to discover and remediate these instances.  \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 23 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 24 of 32\n \n1  99.  And although WSU members have told multiple BHS teachers whom they trust \n2  about the general problem of sexual harassment and breakout rooms, including in a conversation \n3  in Spring 2021, the students did not share specifics, such as the identities of the students involved \n4  or the particular classes in which the problem has arisen. The teachers expressed concern and \n5  empathy, and noted they lacked guidance from BHS about how to deal with the specific \n6  challenges of supervising breakout rooms. WSU does not have reason to believe any teacher was \n7  on actual notice about a particular incident involving particular students in a particular class. \n8  100.  Prior to the 2020 Regulations for sexual harassment, and still true today for race- \n9  and disability-based harassment, “[a] finding that a recipient had constructive notice of a hostile \n10  environment meets the notice requirement of the analysis.” 1994 Racial Harassment Guidance. \n11  BUSD has constructive knowledge of a general sexually hostile environment at BHS based, \n12  among other things, on the severity and pervasiveness of the harassment; years of student \n13  protests; a student-run Instagram account that, during the summer and fall of 2020, posted stories \n14  about sexual harassment BUSD students experienced at school; and meetings WSU leadership \n15  had with school administrators in the fall of 2020, in which the leaders expressed their concerns \n16  about sexual harassment at the school. \n17  101.  Now, however, because of the 2020 Regulations, BUSD may only violate Title IX \n18  if it has actual knowledge of sexual harassment. That is, school staff must have received a report \n19  of the sexual harassment or witnessed it. 34 C.F.R. § 106.30(a). Accordingly, any Title IX \n20  complaint WSU might file about BUSD’s response to sexual harassment of which it has \n21  constructive but not actual knowledge would not “indicate[] a possible failure to comply with” \n22  the 2020 Regulations, id. § 100.7(c), and so would not trigger an Office for Civil Rights \n23  investigation and resolution.  \n24  102.  Indeed, as applied, the Office for Civil Rights requires a student to file a formal \n25  complaint before a school must make any response to sexual harassment. For example, on \n26  February 23, 2021, the Office for Civil Rights dismissed a complaint where a student alleged that \n27  its school had failed to respond to sexual orientation harassment, which the Office treats as a \n28  form of sexual harassment. The Office for Civil Rights dismissed the allegation that the \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 24 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 25 of 32\n \n1  University failed to adequately respond to a report of sexual harassment based on the lack of a \n2  formal complaint by a student. “[Y]ou stated that you had not filed a complaint with the \n3  University about [the student]. Under the current Title IX regulations, the University is only \n4  required to respond [to a report about sexual harassment] when a complainant files, or a Title IX \n5  Coordinator signs, a formal complaint. Therefore, OCR is dismissing Allegation 4.”  Letter of \n6  Dismissal from Office for Civil Rights regarding University of Maryland-Baltimore County, No. \n7  03-21-2054, at 2 (Feb. 23, 2021).  \n8  103.  Changes to the Liability Standard:  In order to obtain any relief, WSU members \n9  must not only show that BUSD responded unreasonably, but clearly unreasonably. By increasing \n10  the deference that BUSD receives, the 2020 Regulations have reduced the likelihood that WSU \n11  members will obtain any relief. BUSD responds to much of the sexual harassment that WSU \n12  members and other BHS students experience in a manner that is unreasonable but not clearly \n13  unreasonable. Accordingly, any Title IX complaint WSU might file about BUSD’s unreasonable, \n14  but not clearly unreasonable, response to sexual harassment would not “indicate[] a possible \n15  failure to comply with” the 2020 Regulations, 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(c), and so would not trigger an \n16  Office for Civil Rights investigation and resolution.  \n17  The 2020 Regulations have impaired WSU’s procedural right to obtain an investigation and \n18  resolution of its administrative Title IX complaint against BUSD  \n19  104.  On February 26, 2021, hoping that the 2020 Regulations would not survive the \n20  multiple lawsuits then pending against the Department, WSU filed an administrative complaint \n21  with the Office for Civil Rights pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 100.7 describing BUSD’s patterns and \n22  practices of addressing sexual harassment. In its administrative complaint and during the course \n23  of the evaluation process, WSU provided the Office for Civil Rights with the examples in \n24  paragraphs 91 and 97-99 above as specific illustrations. Those alleged violations of Title IX that, \n25  under the 2020 Regulations, are no longer cognizable.  \n26  105.  Absent the 2020 Regulations, WSU would file a further complaint with the Office \n27  for Civil Rights concerning the ongoing unchecked harassment, including the examples in \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 25 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 26 of 32\n \n1  paragraphs 89 and 92 above. But these incidents are also no longer cognizable because of the \n2  2020 Regulations.  \n3  106.  But for the Department’s 2020 Regulations, WSU’s complaints concerning post-\n4  August 14, 2020 sexual harassment would be opened for investigation by the Office for Civil \n5  Rights. Without a doubt, the Office for Civil Rights cannot investigate and find BUSD in \n6  violation of Title IX for how it handled the post-August 14, 2020 sexual harassment that WSU \n7  has already included in the February 2021 administrative complaint (or in response to requests \n8  for additional information to support the complaint). The simple truth is that the 2020 \n9  Regulations no longer make it unlawful for purposes of administrative enforcement for BUSD to \n10  disregard sexual harassment that is severe but not pervasive (or pervasive but not severe); sexual \n11  harassment that originates outside the school’s “program or activity,” even though it impacts \n12  students’ ability to participate in the school’s program or activity; and sexual harassment that the \n13  school should reasonably know about, but of which it lacks actual knowledge. Even for \n14  cognizable sexual harassment that the school knows about, the 2020 Regulations do not require \n15  complete relief and, in fact, allow the school to respond unreasonably to the harassment, so long \n16  as its response is not clearly unreasonable. \n17  The Department’s Office for Civil Rights has not yet, and will not,  \n18  open WSU’s complaint for investigation \n19  107.  Actions by the Office for Civil Rights in the 220 days since the administrative \n20  complaint was filed on February 26, 2021, offer further support that it will not be opening \n21  WSU’s complaint for investigation. \n22  108.  On March 2, 2021, the Office for Civil Rights sent WSU an acknowledgement \n23  letter stating that it was “evaluating your complaint to determine whether OCR will accept your \n24  allegation(s) for investigation” and that its “target date for completion of this process is 30 days \n25  from the date of this letter.”  \n26  109.  On March 12, 2021, the Office for Civil Rights sent eleven questions (some with \n27  up to seven sub-questions), to which WSU responded on April 9. On April 12, the Office for \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 26 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 27 of 32\n \n1  Civil Rights sent WSU 4 more questions (all with 2 or 3 sub-questions) about WSU’s responses \n2  to the first round of questions. WSU responded on April 22.  \n3  110.  On May 11, the Office for Civil Rights sent WSU an email with eight additional \n4  questions about WSU’s responses to the second round of questions. WSU responded on May 21. \n5  In response to WSU’s inquiry about the need for some of the information in deciding whether to \n6  open the complaint for investigation (such as the names of the teachers WSU members spoke \n7  with), the Office for Civil Rights stated on May 21 that “[t]he requests for additional information \n8  from you have been to avoid a potential dismissal” on the basis that the complaint “lacks \n9  sufficient factual detail” under § 108(b) of the Complaint Processing Manual. WSU participated \n10  in a phone call with the Office for Civil Rights on June 1, 2021, where it was informed that the \n11  teachers would not be contacted unless an investigation was open but that the Office for Civil \n12  Rights nonetheless wanted to information at this stage.  \n13  111.  On June 4, the Office for Civil Rights memorialized its June 1 phone request for \n14  WSU to answer some additional questions and also asked to speak with three students whom \n15  WSU had identified by pseudonym as experiencing certain incidents of harassment. In WSU’s \n16  June 25 response, WSU answered the questions (including providing the names of the teachers \n17  WSU members spoke with), stated that it would prefer to continue to respond in writing, but \n18  noted that if the Office for Civil Rights will not open an investigation into some or all of WSU’s \n19  complaint on the basis that the students did not participate in a pre-investigation interview, the \n20  Office for Civil Rights should let WSU know. \n21  112.  On June 28, the Office for Civil Rights informed WSU that in order for it “to \n22  pursue further evaluation,” it needed the written consent of the parents of the three students \n23  pseudonymously identified by WSU in its April 9 response. On July 1, WSU responded that it \n24  was confused why consent for those three students was needed when WSU had already filed a \n25  consent form and the complaint was filed on behalf of itself and a class of people protected by \n26  Title IX. The same day, the Office for Civil Rights said no consent forms were needed because \n27  WSU had clarified that the complaint was not on behalf of the three students. On July 6, WSU \n28  responded that its complaint was not on behalf of the three specific students, but these students \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 27 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 28 of 32\n \n1  are likely part of the class of students on whose behalf WSU filed the complaint. The Office for \n2  Civil Rights responded that same day that it understood and thanked WSU for the clarification. \n3  113.  WSU has not heard anything from the Office for Civil Rights since July 6. \n4  114.  According to its most recent Annual Report, available at \n5  https://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/ocr/report-to-president-and-secretary-of-education-\n6  2020.pdf, the Office for Civil Rights aims to resolve all complaints within 180 days of receipt \n7  and in fact resolved 90% of complaints within 180 days of receipt. The Office for Civil Rights’ \n8  initial letter to WSU stated that the target date for completing the evaluation for whether to open \n9  WSU’s complaint for investigation was April 1 (30 days after the letter was sent). The fact that it \n10  has not even opened WSU’s complaint for investigation after 220 days, much less resolved it, \n11  and has not been in touch with WSU for 90 days since its last set of questions was answered, \n12  confirms what the 2020 Regulations make plain: the Office for Civil Rights will not be opening \n13  an investigation into WSU’s claims concerning post-August 14, 2020, sexual harassment.  \n14  WSU’s procedural injury results in harm to its members and other students \n15  115.  For the reasons described above, the 2020 Regulations deny WSU and its \n16  members the right they had prior to the 2020 Regulations to have their administrative complaints \n17  investigated. \n18  116.  The denial of that procedural right impinges on the concrete interest of WSU and \n19  its members to participate in and benefit from BUSD’s education program because the denial \n20  allows the hostile environment at BUSD to continue unremediated.  \n21  117.  The denial of that procedural right impinges on the concrete interests of WSU \n22  members who have been sexually harassed because they cannot receive remedies from the Office \n23  for Civil Rights to address their educational deprivations. \n24  118.  The denial of that procedural rights impinges on the concrete interests of WSU \n25  members, regardless of whether they have previously been sexually harassed, who are at greater \n26  risk of future sexual harassment because the Office for Civil Rights will not investigate and press \n27  BUSD to adopt policy changes to end the hostile environment at BUSD. \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 28 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 29 of 32\n \n1  119.  The denial of that procedural right impinges on the concrete interests of WSU \n2  members, including those who are not directly targeted by sexual harassment. For example, some \n3  WSU members and other BHS students have had to share classrooms or hallways with students \n4  who have sexually assaulted their friends. That makes these students feel unsafe and \n5  uncomfortable. One WSU member, “Sarah,” had a panic attack at school this academic year \n6  when she saw a classmate who had sexually assaulted one of her friends with impunity; she has \n7  started walking to class a different way to avoid seeing him. As one student explained to a \n8  journalist, “I was always seeing somebody who had done something or experienced something or \n9  a hallway where something had been done. It's always on your mind and it's always breaking \n10  your heart.” Similarly, because sexual harassment is so prevalent at BHS, WSU members and \n11  other BHS students sometimes feel uncomfortable when assigned to work on group projects with \n12  young men they do not know and trust.  \n13  Additional injuries to WSU’s members caused by the 2020 Regulations \n14  120.  Apart from the procedural injuries identified above, WSU’s members are injured \n15  by the cumulative effect of each of the challenged 2020 Regulations, which will lead to students \n16  experiencing more sexual harassment and receiving fewer remedies. \n17  121.  The 2020 Regulations vastly change the incentives of schools to prioritize \n18  preventing and deterring sexual harassment. Under the challenged provisions, a school’s failure \n19  to effectively prevent and promptly respond to sexual harassment will be much less likely to \n20  carry any consequences. In fact, a school may be incentivized to avoid learning about the \n21  harassment its students experience, in order to avoid triggering any obligations under the \n22  Regulations. \n23  122.  The 2020 Regulations also discourage students from filing complaints with their \n24  schools in the first place by creating uncertainty about what conduct will trigger a school’s \n25  obligation under Title IX to investigate and respond to sexual harassment.  \n26  123.  The Department itself acknowledged that the 2020 Regulations would reduce \n27  investigations of sexual harassment by 50% in K-12 schools. But nowhere does the Department \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 29 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 30 of 32\n \n1  conclude that a substantial reduction in investigations will result in less sexual harassment or \n2  more “effective” protections against sexual harassment. Nor could it.  \n3  124.  To the contrary, the 2020 Regulations will result in more students being subjected \n4  to sexual harassment because it narrows the scope of Title IX’s protections.  \n5  125.  The Department itself, in the preamble to the 2020 Regulations, recognized that \n6  “weak sanctions against sexual violence perpetrators and weak laws and policies related to \n7  sexual violence and sex equality are associated with a greater likelihood of perpetration.” 85 Fed. \n8  Reg. at 30,070. \n9  126.  Because fewer incidents of sexual harassment will be investigated under the 2020 \n10  Regulations, the likelihood of this harassment being detected and addressed will also be reduced. \n11  These decreases will have an appreciable impact on a school’s ability to deter future and \n12  repeated sexually harassing conduct and on students’ ability to attend a school free from hostile \n13  environments. As noted above in paragraph 119, the injury caused by sexual harassment is not \n14  limited to the direct targets of the harassment; WSU members have had to share classrooms with \n15  students who have sexually assaulted their friends, leaving the students feeling unsafe and \n16  uncomfortable.  \n17  127.  In addition, even if the Office for Civil Rights were to open some or all of the \n18  allegations of WSU’s complaint for investigation, the Department’s 2020 Regulations do not \n19  require and, in fact, discourage BUSD from taking actions that were previously required under \n20  the Department’s prior interpretations of Title IX and that WSU wishes BHS to take. The 2020 \n21  Regulations themselves thus deprive WSU of a critical bargaining tool as it seeks to achieve \n22  these changes at BHS as part of WSU’s organizational purpose. \n23  CLAIM \n24  Violations of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) & (C) \n25  1.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint as \n26  though fully set forth here.  \n27 \n28 \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 30 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 31 of 32\n \n1  2.  The 2020 Regulations are not in accordance with law and short of statutory right \n2  because the Department adopted provisions that are contrary to the text and purpose \n3  of Title IX. \n4  3.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because the Department changed \n5  its longstanding prior interpretations without sufficient justification for the change \n6  and, in some instances, without displaying awareness that it was changing its view.  \n7  4.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed to \n8  consider important aspects of the problem, including that the Regulations discourage \n9  students from filing complaints about sexual harassment with their schools and \n10  discourage schools from learning about sexual harassment experienced by their \n11  students. \n12  5.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because, contrary to the evidence \n13  and in conflict with its own rationale about the effect of the regulations on school and \n14  student behavior, the Department refused to find that the provisions would increase \n15  the amount of sexual harassment that students would experience. The Department \n16  thus disregarded a factor that Title IX itself made highly relevant and failed to \n17  consider an important aspect of the problem. \n18  6.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because, without a satisfactory \n19  explanation, the Department imposed special limitations, procedures, and obstacles \n20  for sexual harassment claims that do not apply to any other sex discrimination claims \n21  under Title IX or to race- and disability-based discrimination (including harassment) \n22  claims under Title VI, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Disabilities \n23  Act. \n24  7.  The 2020 Regulations are arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed to \n25  consider important aspects of the problem, including the disparate effect that the \n26  Regulations will have on women and girls and LGBTQ students. \n27   \n28   \n \nPlaintiff’s First Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief – 31 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-01626-EMC   Document 78   Filed 10/04/21   Page 32 of 32\n \n1  REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n2    WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \n3  A.  Declare that Defendant’s 2020 Regulations challenged in this Complaint, and any \n4  provisions that cannot be severed from the challenged provisions, are unlawful. \n5  B.  Enter a preliminary and permanent injunction holding unlawful and setting aside the \n6  Regulations challenged in this Complaint, and any challenged provisions that cannot \n7  be severed from those provisions, as arbitrary or capricious; in excess of statutory \n8  jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; or otherwise not in \n9  accordance with law. \n10  C.  Award Plaintiff its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in the prosecution of \n11  this action; and \n12  D.  Award such other equitable and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n13  Date: October 4, 2021         Respectfully submitted, \n14  Seth M. Galanter*  Adele P.
