    "summary": "<p>On April 6, 2021, the Arkansas legislature passed H.B. 1570 &mdash; the \"Save Adolescents from Experimentation&rdquo; (SAFE) Act &mdash; over the governor&rsquo;s veto. The Safe Act banned healthcare professionals from providing gender transition procedures, including puberty blockers and hormones, to anyone under 18 or from referring anyone under 18 to any healthcare professional for such procedures. Additionally, the SAFE Act prohibited coverage of gender transition procedures for minors by Medicaid or private insurance. Four families with transgender children and two pediatricians brought this complaint against various Arkansas state officials in the Eastern District of Arkansas on May 25, 2021. The families and doctors, represented by the National ACLU, Arkansas ACLU, and private law firms, claimed the SAFE Act was unconstitutional for: (1) violating the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment by discriminating on the basis of sex; (2) violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) violating the First Amendment by prohibiting healthcare providers from referring their patients for medical treatments in accordance with the accepted medical standards to treat gender dysphoria. The relief sought by the families included: (1) declaratory judgment that the SAFE Act was unconstitutional; (2) preliminary and permanent injunctions on the SAFE Act; and (3) an award of reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Judge James Maxwell Moody, Jr.</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, 2021, the United States filed a Statement of Interest echoing the Plaintiffs&rsquo; claim that the SAFE Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Several national and state organizations of health professionals also filed amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs. These organizations included the American Medical Association and Arkansas Psychiatric Society.</p>\r\n<p>On July 21, 2021, the court denied Arkansas&rsquo; motion to dismiss and granted the Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction on all three proposed grounds. On August 2, 2021, Judge Moody, Jr. elaborated in a Supplemental Order, 551 F.Supp.3d 882 (E.D. Ark. 2021), focusing on the families&rsquo; equal protection claim and explaining that the SAFE ACT &ldquo;rests on sex-based classifications and&hellip; transgender people constitute at least a quasi-suspect class.&rdquo; Moreover, the court found that the stated intents of the bill (protecting children from experimental treatment and regulating medical ethics) were pretextual. The court looked, among other things, at overwhelming medical testimony that &ldquo;gender-affirming for transgender minors may be medically appropriate and necessary to improve the physical and mental health of transgender people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Arkansas appealed the decision on August 20, 2021 to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Both sides filed briefs, and again, many notable individuals and institutions filed amici briefs; the United States again filed a brief supporting the Plaintiffs. On August 25, 2022, Judges James B. Loken, Jane Kelly, and Katherine M. Menendez upheld the lower court's injunction because the lower court had not abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction based on Plaintiffs&rsquo; equal protection claim. The three Judges affirmed arguments that transgender youth would suffer \"irreparable harm\" absent preliminary injunction and that enforcing the law would prohibit medical treatment that conforms with the recognized standard of care. The Judges also agreed that the SAFE Act is not substantially related to its purported purposes of protecting children from experimental medical treatment and regulating medical ethics. The Court did not address the State&rsquo;s challenges to Plaintiffs&rsquo; other claims. 47 F.4th 661. Arkansas requested an en banc or panel rehearing of their appeal of the preliminary injunction, but their request was rejected on November 16, 2022. The order itself did not contain any rationale, but a concurrence by Judge Colloton, joined by two other judges, explained that Arkansas had not requested a stay for the 15 prior months.</p>\r\n<p>The district court held an eight-day bench trial in October 2022.&nbsp; On June 20, 2023, the court issued its findings of facts and conclusions of law, entered judgment for the plaintiffs on all claims, and enjoined the state from enforcing the law permanently. 677 F.Supp.3d 877. Among its findings of facts, the court found that transgender care was not experimental care, and that providing treatment for gender dysphoria wouldn't cause a person to be or remain transgender because there was no treatment that had the ability to change a person&rsquo;s gender identity. In addition, the court found that parents or guardians would still be required to provide informed consent in order for their children to receive medical treatment, and the informed consent process was adequate to enable minor patients and their parents to make decisions about gender-affirming medical care for adolescents. Further, the risks of gender-affirming medical care were not categorically different from the types of risks that other types of pediatric healthcare pose, and for many adolescents the benefits of treatment greatly outweighed the risks. The court also found that adolescents with gender dysphoria were unlikely to de-transition or desist in their transition whether or not they received gender-affirming medical care.</p>\r\n<p>As to conclusions of law, the court held that the SAFE Act violated the equal protection clause because it discriminated on the basis of sex, as a minor&rsquo;s sex at birth determined whether the minor was able to receive certain types of medical care under the law. The court also held that the law discriminated against transgender people, as the law prohibited medical or surgical procedures related to gender transition, medical care that only transgender individuals chose to undergo. Further, the court found that Arkansas hadn&rsquo;t met its burden of providing a persuasive justification for the differential treatment of transgender individuals. The state provided five reasons: i) that there was a lack of evidence of efficacy of the banned care; ii) that the banned treatment had risks and side effects; iii) that many patients would desist in their gender incongruence; iv) that some patients would later come to regret having received irreversible treatments; and v) that treatment was being provided without appropriate evaluation and informed consent. The court determined that none of these reasons were persuasive or supported by evidence at the trial.&nbsp; As to plaintiffs' due process claim, the court held that the Act's ban on all gender transition procedures was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve the state's asserted interests, noting the plaintiff parents' fundamental right to make medical decisions for their children. Finally, the court held that the Act regulated physician speech -- effectively prohibiting physicians from informing their patients about the treatments -- and that it was a content and viewpoint-based regulation of speech subject to strict scrutiny.&nbsp; Applying that standard, the court held that the Act violated the First Amendment because Arkansas failed to prove that its interests in the safety of adolescents from gender transitioning procedures were \"compelling, genuine, or even rational.\" Thus, the court entered judgment for the plaintiffs and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 20, 2023, Arkansas appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (23-02681). Arkansas filed a petition for an initial hearing en banc and the court granted the petition on October 6, 2023. Following the grant of the petition for an initial hearing en banc, both sides filed briefs, and again, many notable individuals and institutions filed amici briefs; the United States again filed a brief supporting the Plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>The appeal was argued before the Eighth Circuit, en banc, on April 11, 2024. The United States participated in oral argument.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 12, 2025, in an 8-2 opinion, the Eighth Circuit reversed the district court&rsquo;s decision and remanded the case. &nbsp;The Court of Appeals found that (1) the Act does not classify on the basis of sex or transgender status (rather only of age and medical procedure) and so does not violate or even trigger heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause; (2) the Act survives rational basis review under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses; (3) under the Fourteenth Amendment, the nation&rsquo;s history and tradition and its &ldquo;historical understanding of ordered liberty&rdquo; do not guarantee the right of a parent to offer his or her child a medical treatment desired by the child and approved by a physician but deemed inappropriate for minors by the state legislature; (4) the Act survives the intermediate First Amendment scrutiny required when a statute imposes a burden on protected speech that is only incidental to its regulation of other activity because Arkansas has a compelling interest in protecting the health of minors and has adequately tailored the law to serve that compelling interest. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Eighth Circuit concluded that the district court had rested its permanent injunction on incorrect conclusions of law and reversed the judgment, remanding the case for further proceedings.&nbsp;As of October 15, 2025 the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "In May 2021, four families of transgender minors, and their physicians, sought to enjoin an Arkansas law (the SAFE Act) that would have banned the provision of medically necessary and potentially lifesaving healthcare to transgender adolescents. The families sued in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Arkansas, on the basis of the Fourteenth and First Amendments. On July 21, 2021, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the SAFE Act, and on August 25, 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. A trial on the merits of a permanent injunction is scheduled to conclude on December 1, 2022. On June 20, 2023, the court determined that the Plaintiffs were entitled to judgment in their favor on all claims, issued a permanent injunction, and enjoined the state from enforcing the law permanently.

The Act also prohibited the \nprofessionals from referring minors for gender transition procedures.  Four minors \nliving in Arkansas, their parents, and two healthcare professionals practicing there \nsued to enjoin the Arkansas Attorney General and the members of the State Medical \nBoard from enforcing the Act.  Ruling that the Act violated the First Amendment \nand both the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and Due Process \nClause, the district court issued a permanent injunction.  The Attorney General and \nthe Board appeal.  Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court reverses \nand remands.   \n \n \n \n \n-3- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 3      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nI.   \n \nIn 2021, the Arkansas legislature enacted, over the governor’s veto, the Save \nAdolescents from Experimentation Act, Act 626.  It prohibited physicians and other \nhealthcare  professionals  from  providing  “gender  transition  procedures  to  any \nindividual under eighteen (18) years of age.”  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-1502(a).  The \nAct also prohibited physicians and other healthcare professionals from referring \nminors to any healthcare professional for gender transition procedures.  § 20-9-\n1502(b).  The Act defined the provision of, or referral for, these procedures to minors \nas “unprofessional conduct . . . subject to discipline by the appropriate licensing \nentity or disciplinary review board.”  § 20-9-1504(a).  The Act also empowered the \nAttorney General to bring actions to enforce compliance.  § 20-9-1504(f)(1).   \n \nFour minors in Arkansas, their parents, and two healthcare professionals sued \nfor  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief.2    They  alleged  that  the  Act  violated  the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause, as well \nas the First Amendment.  The district court granted a preliminary injunction against \nthe enforcement of the Act.  On appeal, a panel of this court affirmed the district \ncourt, finding a likelihood of success on the merits that the Act violated the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661, 669–71 (8th \nCir. 2022).  \n \nThe case proceeded to trial on the merits.  After an eight-day bench trial, the \ndistrict court concluded that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Due \nProcess Clause, and the First Amendment.  The court permanently enjoined the \nAttorney General and the State Medical Board from enforcing the Act.  Brandt v. \nRutledge, 677 F.Supp.3d 877, 925 (E.D. Ark. 2023).   \n \n \n2Three of the four minor plaintiffs have reached age 18 and, thus, they and \ntheir parents are no longer impacted by Act 626.  The district court dismissed one \nhealthcare professional, who does not appeal.  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 F.Supp.3d \n877, 886 n.3 (E.D. Ark. 2023).    \n-4- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 4      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nThe Attorney General and the Board appeal.  This court granted an initial \nhearing of the appeal en banc.  Fed. R. App. P. 40(g).  This court reviews permanent \ninjunctions for abuse of discretion, including “where the district court rests its \nconclusion on clearly erroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.”  \nOglala Sioux Tribe v. C & W Enterprises, Inc., 542 F.3d 224, 229 (8th Cir. 2008).  \n“A permanent injunction requires the moving party to show actual success on the \nmerits . . . .  If a court finds actual success on the merits, it then considers . . . (1) the \nthreat of irreparable harm to the moving party; (2) the balance of harms with any \ninjury an injunction might inflict on other parties; and (3) the public interest.”  Id.  \n“After a bench trial, this court reviews legal conclusions de novo and factual findings \nfor clear error.”  Urban Hotel Dev. Co., Inc. v. President Dev. Group, L.C., 535 \nF.3d 874, 879 (8th Cir. 2008).   \n \nII.   \n \nThe Act defines “gender transition procedures” as “any medical or surgical \nservice” seeking to:  \n \n(i) Alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features \nthat are typical for the individual’s biological sex; or  \n \n(ii) Instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that \nresemble a sex different from the individual’s biological sex, including \nwithout  limitation  medical  services  that  provide  puberty-blocking \ndrugs,  cross-sex  hormones,  or  other  mechanisms  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of feminizing or masculinizing features in the opposite \nbiological sex, or genital or nongenital gender reassignment surgery \nperformed for the purpose of assisting an individual with a gender \ntransition. \n \nArk. Code Ann. § 20-9-1501(6)(A).   \n \n-5- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 5      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nA. \n \nThe minors argue that the Act classifies based on sex in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause.  They argue that a minor’s sex determines whether he or she can \nreceive certain medical treatments.  According to the minors, a male minor can \nreceive testosterone to masculinize his appearance, but a female minor cannot.  See \n§ 20-9-1501(2)(A)  (defining  “Cross-sex  hormones”  to  include  “Testosterone  or \nother androgens given to biological females in amounts that are larger or more potent \nthan would normally occur naturally in healthy biological sex females”).  The minors \nreason that because a minor’s sex determines whether he or she may receive certain \nmedical treatments, the Act classifies based on sex.  They conclude that the Act \nwarrants heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.        \n \nTo the contrary, as the Supreme Court explained about a similar Tennessee \nlaw, the Act classifies based only on age and medical procedure.  See United States \nv. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816, 1829 (2025).  Under the Act, just like the Tennessee \nlaw,  healthcare  professionals  “may  administer  certain  medical  treatments  to \nindividuals ages 18 and older but not to minors.”  Id.  Thus, the Act classifies based \non age.   \n \nThe Act also classifies based on medical procedure.  Under the Act, healthcare \nprofessionals may provide puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or surgery \nfor some purposes, but not “for the purpose of assisting an individual with a gender \ntransition.”    Ark.  Code  Ann.  §  20-9-1501(6)(A)(ii).    The  Act  exempts  many \nservices from its definition of “gender transition procedures,” including:  \n \n(i) Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex \ndevelopment . . . ;  \n \n(ii) Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a \ndisorder  of  sexual  development  that  the  physician  has  determined \nthrough genetic or biochemical testing that the person does not have \n-6- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 6      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nnormal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or \nsex steroid hormone action;  \n \n(iii) The treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has \nbeen caused by or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition \nprocedures . . . ; or \n \n(iv) Any procedure undertaken because the individual suffers from a \nphysical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as \ncertified by a physician, place the individual in imminent danger of \ndeath  or  impairment  of  major  bodily  function  unless  surgery  is \nperformed.   \n \n§ 20-9-1501(6)(B).  Thus, the Act classifies based on medical procedure, allowing \nsome but prohibiting others.   \n  \nThe minors argue that the Act does not classify based on medical procedure \nbecause the Act does not prohibit any specific medication, medical intervention, or \nsurgical treatment.  True, the Act prohibits “any” medical or surgical service that \nseeks to accomplish the goals described in the Act’s definition of “gender transition \nprocedures.”  § 20-9-1501(6)(A)(i), (ii).  Also, unlike the Tennessee law upheld by \nthe  Supreme  Court,  the  Act  does  not  mention  the  specific  conditions  “gender \ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, gender incongruence.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-\n33-102(1).  But the Act allows healthcare professionals to address some medical \nconcerns but not others.  Like the Tennessee law, the Act’s exemptions to the \ndefinition of “gender transition procedures”  do include specific conditions that \nhealthcare professionals may treat without violating the Act.  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-\n9-1501(6)(B); cf. Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-33-103(b).  The Act allows healthcare \nprofessionals  to  provide  drugs  or  surgical  services  to  address  some  medical \nconcerns, but it bars healthcare professionals from providing those drugs or surgeries \nfor other purposes.  The Act thus classifies based on medical procedure, treating \ndifferent medical procedures differently.  \n-7- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 7      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nThe  Act  does  not  classify  based  on  sex.    A  minor  male  who  receives \ntestosterone in order to masculinize his appearance receives a different procedure \nthan a minor female who receives testosterone as a gender transition procedure.  See \nSkrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1830 (stating that an aspect of a “medical treatment” is “the \nunderlying medical concern the treatment is intended to address”).  “Both puberty \nblockers and hormones can be used to treat certain overlapping indications (such as \ngender dysphoria), and each can be used to treat a range of other conditions.  These \ncombinations of drugs and indications give rise to various medical treatments.”  Id. \n(internal citation omitted).  In fact, the district court here found: “Testosterone is \nused to treat cisgender adolescent male patients for a number of conditions including \ndelayed puberty, hypogonadism (where the brain does not tell the body to go through \npuberty), and micropenis.”  Brandt, 677 F.Supp.3d at 904.  A minor male receiving \ntestosterone for one of these conditions receives a different medical treatment than \na  minor  female  receiving  testosterone  as  a  gender  transition  procedure.    See \nSkrmetti,  145  S.  Ct.  at  1830  (“When,  for  example,  a  transgender  boy  (whose \nbiological sex is female) takes puberty blockers to treat his gender incongruence, he \nreceives a different medical treatment than a boy whose biological sex is male who \ntakes puberty blockers to treat his precocious puberty.”).  Because “no minor may \nbe administered puberty blockers or hormones” as gender transition procedures, but \n“minors of any sex may be administered puberty blockers or hormones for other \npurposes,” the Act does not classify based on sex.  Id. at 1831.  The Act classifies \nbased on age and medical procedure, not sex.    \n \nCiting Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020), the minors argue \nthat prohibiting gender transition procedures inherently discriminates on the basis of \nsex because the Act punishes a minor for seeking to acquire sex characteristics \n“different  from  the  individual’s  biological  sex.”    Ark.  Code  Ann.  § 20-9-\n1501(6)(A)(ii).  The minors reason that the Act must classify based on sex because \nit would otherwise be impossible to distinguish whether a drug or surgery for a minor \nwas permitted or prohibited.   However, the Supreme Court declined to decide \n“whether Bostock’s reasoning reaches beyond the Title VII context.”  Skrmetti, 145 \nS.  Ct.  at  1834.    Regardless,  the  Court  continued,  the  Tennessee  law  did  not \n-8- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 8      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndiscriminate on the basis of sex under the reasoning of Bostock.  The Court explained \nthat “changing a minor’s sex . . . does not alter the application” of the law.  Id.  “If \na  transgender  boy  seeks  testosterone  to  treat  his  gender dysphoria,”  the  law \n“prevents a healthcare provider from administering it to him.”  Id.  “If you change \nhis biological sex from female to male,” the law “would still not permit him the \nhormones  he  seeks  because  he  would  lack  a  qualifying  diagnosis  for  the \ntestosterone—such as a congenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical \ninjury.”  Id.  “The transgender boy could receive testosterone only if he had one of \nthose permissible diagnoses.  And, if he had such a diagnosis, he could obtain \nthe testosterone regardless of his sex.”  Id.  Like the Tennessee law, the Act prohibits \nproviding medical treatment for certain purposes, and these prohibitions apply even \nif one switches the sex of a hypothetical minor.  Thus, the Act does not discriminate \non the basis of sex.  This court need not decide whether Bostock’s reasoning applies \nin Equal Protection Clause cases because applying Bostock’s reasoning does not \nchange the outcome of this case.     \n \nThe minors assert that the Act reinforces “fixed notions” about “roles and \nabilities” tied to an individual’s sex, citing Mississippi University for Women v. \nHogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724–25 (1982).  According to them, the Act’s prohibitions \nturn on what is “typical” for an individual’s sex.  See Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-\n1501(6)(A)(i).  The minors conclude that the Act thus compels individual conformity \nto generalizations about sex.  “True, a law that classifies on the basis of sex may fail \nheightened  scrutiny  if  the  classifications  rest  on  impermissible  stereotypes.”  \nSkrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1832.  But, as the Supreme Court explained, “where a law’s \nclassifications are neither covertly nor overtly based on sex . . . we do not subject \nthe law to heightened review unless it was motivated by an invidious discriminatory \npurpose.”  Id.  A discriminatory purpose “implies that the decisionmaker, in this case \na state legislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part \n‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”  \nPersonnel Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979).  The minors do not \nallege that an invidious sex-based discriminatory purpose motivated the Arkansas \nGeneral Assembly.       \n-9- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 9      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nThe  Assembly  expressed  its  concern  that  the  “risks  of  gender  transition \nprocedures  far  outweigh  any  benefit  at  this  stage  of  clinical  study  on  these \nprocedures.”  Act 626, § 2(15), 93rd Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2021).  The \nlegislature found: \n•  “The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite \nthe lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks \nand benefits of using these drugs for . . . gender transition”;   \n•  “Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for \nchildren who experience distress at identifying with their biological \nsex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been \nconducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones \nin . . . children for the purpose of . . . gender transition”;   \n•  “The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks,” \nincluding an increase in red blood cells, severe liver dysfunction, \nheart  attacks,  strokes,  hypertension,  gallstones,  blood  clots, \nirreversible infertility, and increased risks of certain cancers;   \n•  “Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible \ninvasive  procedures  for  males  and  females  and  involves  the \nalteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts”;     \n•  “The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated \nwith  genital  gender  reassignment  surgery  for  both  males  and \nfemales are numerous and complex”; \n•  “Nongenital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive \nprocedures for males and females and also involves the alteration of \nbiologically healthy and functional body parts.”     \n \nId.  at  § 2(6)(B),  (7),  (8),  10(A),  (11),  (12)(A).    “A  concern  about  potentially \nirreversible medical procedures for a child is not a form of stereotyping.”  L.W. ex \nrel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 485 (6th Cir. 2023), aff’d, Skrmetti, 145 S. \nCt. at 1832.  The Act does not classify based on sex.     \n \n \n-10- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 10      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nB. \n \nThe  minors  alternatively  assert  that  the  Act  discriminates  based  on \ntransgender status.  The Act defines “gender transition” as “the process in which a \nperson goes from identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to his or \nher biological sex to identifying with and living as a gender different from his or her \nbiological sex.”  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-1501(5).  This definition, the minors \nbelieve, is synonymous with being transgender.  Because the Act prohibits “gender \ntransition procedures,” the minors reason that the act classifies based on transgender \nstatus,  citing  Christian  Legal  Society  Chapter  of  the  University  of  California, \nHastings College of the Law v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, 689 (2010).  Also, the minors \nargue that transgender status is a suspect class.  Thus, the minors conclude that the \nAct triggers heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.     \n \nTo the contrary, the Act does not classify based on transgender status.  Like \nthe Tennessee law upheld by the Supreme Court, the Act effectively divides minors \ninto two groups.  In one group are minors seeking drugs or surgeries for the purposes \nthat the Act prohibits.  In the other group are minors seeking drugs or surgeries for \npurposes the Act does not prohibit.  Although the first group may include only \nminors with transgender status, the second group “encompasses both transgender \nand nontransgender individuals.”  See Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1833.  Thus, there is a \n“lack of identity” between transgender status and the prohibited class of medical \nprocedures.  Id.  The Act, like the Tennessee law, regulates a class of procedures, \nnot people.  See id. at 1834 n.3.  The Act does not classify based on transgender \nstatus.   \n \nC.  \n \nClassifications based on age or medical procedure are evaluated under rational \nbasis review.  Id. at 1829.  Under rational basis review, a legislative classification \nwill be upheld “so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.”  Id. at \n1828.    Here,  the  General  Assembly  found  that  the  state  “has  a  compelling \n-11- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 11      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ngovernment interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially \nvulnerable children.”  Act 626, § 2(1), 93rd Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2021).  \nIndeed,  states  have  a  “compelling”  interest  in  “safeguarding  the  physical  and \npsychological well-being of a minor.”  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756–57 \n(1982).  \n \nThe minors argue that the Act fails rational basis review under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  They do not challenge the Act’s age classification.  However, the \nminors do claim that prohibiting gender transition procedures does not bear a rational \nrelationship to the legislature’s concerns.  They emphasize that Arkansas does not \nprohibit other procedures that have similar risks and less supporting evidence.  See \nBd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 366 n.4 (2001) (noting \nthat the Court struck down an ordinance because “the city’s purported justifications \nfor the ordinance made no sense in light of how the city treated other groups similarly \nsituated in relevant respects”).  They stress that the Act permits minors to receive \nthe same medications for purposes other than gender transition procedures, even \nthough  those  medications  still  have  risks.    They  also  assert  that  the  General \nAssembly’s  concerns  cannot  justify  banning  all  gender  transition  procedures.  \nAccording to the minors, only some gender transition procedures pose risks of \ninfertility and irreversibility; puberty-blocking drugs do not.  The minors conclude \nthat the asserted justifications for the Act’s ban on all gender transition procedures \nare “impossible to credit” and the Act fails rational basis review.  See Romer v. \nEvans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 (1996).   \n \nLaws reviewed for rational basis receive a “wide latitude.”  Skrmetti, 145 S. \nCt. at 1828.  The “relatively relaxed standard” of rational basis review reflects \n“awareness that the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative \ntask and an unavoidable one.”  Id. at 1835.  “Where there exist plausible reasons for \nthe relevant government action, our inquiry is at an end.”  Id. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The legislature’s findings in Act 626 parallel Tennessee’s findings \nthat the Supreme Court held supported the law in Skrmetti.  There, “Tennessee \nconcluded that there is an ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks \n-12- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 12      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nand benefits associated with administering puberty blockers and hormones to treat \ngender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, and gender incongruence.”  Id. at 1836.  \nCompare Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-33-101(b), (h) (finding “it likely that not all \nharmful effects associated with these types of medical procedures when performed \non a minor are yet fully known, as many of these procedures, when performed on a \nminor for such purposes, are experimental in nature and not supported by high-\nquality, long-term medical studies”) (finding that “many individuals have expressed \nregret for medical procedures that were performed on or administered to them for \nsuch purposes when they were minors”), with Act 626, § 2(15), (3), 93rd Gen. \nAssemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2021) (“The risks of gender transition procedures far \noutweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.”) (finding \nthat a majority “of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at \nidentifying with their biological sex . . . come to identify with their biological sex in \nadolescence  or  adulthood,  thereby  rending  most  physiological  interventions \nunnecessary”).    \n \nHowever, the minors try to distinguish this case from Skrmetti.  They argue \nthat even under rational basis review the Act “must find some footing in the realities \nof the subject addressed by the legislation.”  Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321 (1993).  \nThey quote the district court’s factual findings that 1. “The evidence base supporting \ngender-affirming medical care for adolescents is comparable to the evidence base \nsupporting other medical treatments”; and 2. “It is common for clinical practice \nguidelines in medicine to make recommendations based on low or very low-quality \nevidence such as cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.”  Brandt, 677 F.Supp.3d \nat 901, 902.  Because Skrmetti did not have such findings of fact, the minors \nconclude that the justifications that supported the Tennessee law do not support the \nAct.  The minors also highlight that the district court did not consider their argument \nthat  legislators  were  motivated  by  negative  attitudes  about  transgender  people.  \nBecause the district court did not rule whether the Act survives rational basis review, \nthe minors ask this court to remand this case to the district court to decide that \nquestion in light of Skrmetti.  The dissent agrees.          \n \n-13- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 13      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nTo the contrary, this court can determine here that the Act survives rational \nbasis review.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 826–27 (1975) (declining to \nremand to apply the proper standard of review, because “the outcome is readily \napparent”); United States v. Beck, 140 F.3d 1129, 1131 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that \n“because the relevant facts in this case are undisputed, we need not remand for \nfurther findings and may rule based on the record currently before us”).   \n \nThe  district  court  here  found  that  there  were  risks  to  minors  from  the \nprohibited gender transition procedures.  The court found that low bone density is a \nrisk for minors using puberty-blocking drugs.  Brandt, 677 F.Supp.3d at 903.  The \ncourt found that risks for minors using cross-sex hormones include changes in \ncholesterol and blood thickness, blood clots (increasing stroke risk), and infertility.  \nId. at 904–05.  The court found that the risk of infertility from using hormones is not \n“the same regardless of the condition for which they are being used and whether they \nare used to treat birth-assigned males or birth-assigned females.”  Id. at 903.  The \ncourt acknowledged “surgical risks” of chest masculinization surgery.  Id. at 905 \n(finding that the risks were “comparable to the risks related to other chest surgeries \nadolescents may undergo”).  The court expressly found: “There are some individuals \nwho undergo gender-affirming medical treatment who later come to regret that \ntreatment and, for some, it was because they came to identify with their birth-\nassigned sex (sometimes referred to as detransitioning).”  Id. (noting that regret \n“over a medical procedure is not unique to gender-affirming medical care and is \ncommon in medicine”).  True, the district court highlighted that many medical \nassociations in Arkansas and the United States support gender transition procedures \nfor  minors  under  certain  conditions.    Id.  at  889.    But  the  district  court  also \nacknowledged that many studies underlying the associations’ guidelines for gender \ntransition procedures for minors are not of the highest scientific quality.  Id. at 901–\n02.  The district court also acknowledged the policies of Sweden, Finland, and the \nUnited Kingdom, regulating access to gender transition procedures for minors.  Id. \nat 916.  See also Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1825–26 (highlighting the policies of \nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom).  The undisputed facts found by the \n-14- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 14      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndistrict court demonstrate that there is a “reasonably conceivable state of facts that \ncould provide a rational basis for the classification” in the Act.  Id. at 1835.       \n \nBecause a conceivable state of facts supports the Act, this court will not \n“second-guess the lines” that the Act draws between gender transition procedures \nand other medical procedures.  Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1836.  See also Vance v. \nBradley, 440 U.S. 93, 108 (1979) (“Even if the classification involved here is to \nsome extent both underinclusive and overinclusive, and hence the line drawn . . . \nimperfect, it is nevertheless the rule that in a case like this ‘perfection is by no means \nrequired.’”); Danker v. City of Council Bluffs, 53 F.4th 420, 425 (8th Cir. 2022) \n(“While the resulting ordinance may be an imperfect fit, this court cannot second \nguess  or  judge  the  fairness  of  legislative  choices  on  rational  basis  review.”);  \nBirchansky v. Clabaugh, 955 F.3d 751, 758 (8th Cir. 2020) (“States are not required \nto ‘choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking a problem \nat all.’”), quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486–87 (1970).   \n \nIndeed, the Supreme Court leaves wide discretion for medical legislation to \nthe more politically accountable bodies, especially in areas of medical uncertainty.  \nSee, e.g., Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1836 (reiterating that the Court affords states “wide \ndiscretion  to  pass  legislation  in  areas  where  there  is  medical  and  scientific \nuncertainty”);  Jacobson  v.  Massachusetts,  197  U.S.  11,  38 (1905);  Watson  v. \nMaryland, 218 U.S. 173, 180 (1910); Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 \n(1974) (cautioning that “in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties, \nlegislative options must be especially broad and courts should be cautious not to \nrewrite legislation, even assuming, arguendo, that judges with more direct exposure \nto the problem might make wiser choices”); Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 n.30 \n(1977) (reaffirming the “broad” police powers that states have in “regulating the \nadministration of drugs by health professionals”); Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. \n124, 163 (2007) (collecting cases).  Although the Act may be more restrictive than \nthe policies of other countries, under rational basis review a policy need not be “the \nbest-known” way to accomplish the state’s goals.  Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 30.  See \nalso Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1836 (“[T]he fact the line might have been drawn \n-15- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 15      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndifferently  at  some  points  is  a  matter  for  legislative,  rather  than  judicial, \nconsideration.”).  The Act is rationally related to the state’s legitimate interest in \nprotecting the well-being of minors.3  The Act passes rational basis review under the \nEqual Protection Clause.4    \n \nIII.                                                                 \n \nThe parents argue that the Act violates their right to provide appropriate \nmedical care for their children.  The Fourteenth Amendment “provides heightened \nprotection  against government interference  with  certain  fundamental  rights  and \nliberty interests.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997).  Rights not \nmentioned in the Constitution are still protected by the Fourteenth Amendment if \nthey are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the \nconcept of ordered liberty.”  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, \n231 (2022).  According to the parents, it is the right of parents to, with the child’s \nconsent and a doctor’s advice, make judgments about the medical care of their \nchildren.   \n \n  The parents invoke several Supreme Court cases upholding the rights of \nparents against the regulations of states.  A child is not “the mere creature of the \n \n3Also,  because  the  Act  bears  “a  rational  relationship  to  a  legitimate \ngovernmental purpose,” the minors’ assertion about legislators’ negative attitudes \nabout transgender people fails.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 635.  This court has held that “a \nRomer-type analysis applies only where there is no other legitimate state interest for \nthe legislation that survives scrutiny.”  Gallagher v. City of Clayton, 699 F.3d 1013, \n1021 (8th Cir. 2012).  Here, the Act is not “inexplicable by anything but animus.”  \nTrump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 706 (2018), quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 632.  \nBecause the Act “is not the product solely of animus,” it does not “fall within the \nRomer ambit.”  Gallagher, 699 F.3d at 1021.  See Evans v. Dowd, 932 F.2d 739, \n742 (8th Cir. 1991) (declining to remand an unaddressed claim to the district court, \nbecause “review of the record” revealed that the claim “must fail on the merits”). \n  \n4This court’s opinion in Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661 (8th \nCir. 2022), is hereby abrogated.  \n-16- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 16      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nstate.”  Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 \nU.S. 510, 535 (1925).  Parents “have the right, coupled with the high duty, to \nrecognize and prepare him for additional obligations.”  Id.  The Supreme Court has \nreasoned that this duty surely “includes a ‘high duty’ to recognize symptoms of \nillness and to seek and follow medical advice.”  Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 \n(1979).  In Parham, the Court held that its “precedents permit the parents to retain a \nsubstantial, if not the dominant, role in the decision” to voluntarily commit their \nchild to a state mental health hospital.  Id. at 604.  The Court emphasized that parents \n“retain plenary authority to seek such care for their children, subject to a physician’s \nindependent examination and medical judgment.”  Id.  Many statements by the Court \nreflect “concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor \nchildren.”  Id. at 602.  See, e.g., Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399–400 (1923) \n(describing the right to “establish a home and bring up children” as a “liberty” \nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment); Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35 (holding that \nmandating compulsory attendance at public schools “unreasonably interferes with \nthe liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children \nunder their control”); Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) \n(“The liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, custody, \nand  control  of  their  children—is  perhaps  the  oldest of the  fundamental liberty \ninterests recognized by this Court.”).   \n \nMore  recently,  the  Supreme  Court  has  emphasized  the  requirement  for \n“careful  description”  when  discerning  the  unwritten  rights  protected  by  the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721.  The “doctrine of judicial \nself-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break \nnew ground in this field.”  Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993).  The Court has \nrejected recognizing a more specific right as “an integral part of a broader entrenched \nright” when that broader right itself is not absolute.  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 255–56.   \n \nThe  “rights  of  parenthood”  are  not  “beyond  limitation.”    Prince  v. \nMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944) (upholding the conviction of a parent for \nviolating a state child labor law by allowing her children to sell and distribute \n-17- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 17      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nreligious literature).  “Acting to guard the general interest in youth’s well being, the \nstate  as  parens  patriae  may  restrict  the  parent’s  control  by  requiring  school \nattendance, regulating or prohibiting the child’s labor, and in many other ways.”  Id.   \n \nParents do not have unlimited authority to make medical decisions for their \nchildren.    In  Parham  itself,  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  the  state’s  procedural \nprerequisites before a parent could commit his or her minor child.  Parham, 442 \nU.S. at 604.

This court finds no \nsuch right in this Nation’s history and tradition.  The Supreme Court has long \nrecognized the power of a state to regulate the medical profession to “provide for the \ngeneral welfare of its people.”  Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 122 (1889).  \nThe Court has also recognized the power of Congress to prohibit certain medical \ntreatments, despite a doctor finding them “both advisable and necessary.”  Lambert \nv. Yellowley, 272 U.S. 581, 596 (1926) (holding that Congress, in enforcing the \nEighteenth Amendment, could prohibit the prescription of alcohol for medicinal \npurposes).  See Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 166 (upholding Congress’s power to ban a \nmedical  procedure  even  when  “some  part  of  the  medical  community  were \ndisinclined to follow the proscription”); Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Dev’l \nDrugs v. Eschenbach, 495 F.3d 695, 710 n.18 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (en banc) (collecting \nSupreme Court and appellate court cases upholding state or federal laws reasonably \nprohibiting or limiting access to particular medical treatments).   \n \nGenerally, the Supreme Court has recognized that a state’s “authority over \nchildren’s activities is broader than over like actions of adults.”  Prince, 321 U.S. at \n168.  The consent of a parent does not automatically exempt a child from a regulation \nof minors.  Id. at 169 (“What may be wholly permissible for adults therefore may \nnot be so for children, either with or without their parents’ presence.”).  Given the \ntwo parallel currents in this Nation’s history and tradition—first, states can prohibit \nmedical treatments for adults and children, and second, parents cannot automatically \nexempt their children from regulations—this court does not find a deeply rooted \nright of parents to exempt their children from regulations reasonably prohibiting \ngender transition procedures.  See L.W. ex rel. Williams, 83 F.4th at 472–79, aff’d \non other grounds, Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1837; Eknes-Tucker v. Governor of \nAlabama, 80 F.4th 1205, 1220–24 (11th Cir. 2023); K.C. v. Individual Members of \nMedical Licensing Board of Indiana, 121 F.4th 604, 625–27 (7th Cir. 2024).   \n \n-20- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 20      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nNor does the Act violate this Nation’s “historical understanding of ordered \nliberty.”  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 256.  “Ordered liberty sets limits and defines the \nboundary between competing interests.”  Id.  “But the people of the various States \nmay evaluate those interests differently.”  Id.  It does not violate this Nation’s \nhistorical  concept  of  ordered  liberty  for  the  people  of  Arkansas,  through  their \nlegislature, to prohibit physicians from providing gender transition procedures for \nminors.   \n \nThis court thus evaluates the Act under rational basis review.  The Act is \nconstitutional so long as it is “rationally related to legitimate government interests.”  \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 728.  “State legislation which has some effect on individual \nliberty or privacy may not be held unconstitutional simply because a court finds it \nunnecessary, in whole or in part. . . . States have broad latitude in experimenting \nwith possible solutions to problems of vital local concern.”  Whalen, 429 U.S. at \n597.  For the same reasons described in Part II(C), the Act passes rational basis \nreview under the Due Process Clause.  See Danker, 53 F.4th at 425 (“A rational \nbasis that survives equal protection scrutiny also satisfies substantive due process \nanalysis”).    \n \nIV.   \n \n  The healthcare professional argues that the Act’s provision forbidding her to \n“refer” minors for gender transition procedures violates the First Amendment.  Ark. \nCode Ann. § 20-9-1502(b).  She emphasizes that the First Amendment protects the \n“dissemination of information.”  Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 570 \n(2011).  She argues that the restriction on referrals is content based, as the Act \nprohibits  referrals  only  for  gender  transition  procedures,  not  for  other  medical \nservices.    Laws  that  “target  speech  based  on  its  communicative  content”  are \n“presumptively unconstitutional.”  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 \n(2015). \n   \n-21- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 21      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nHowever, the Supreme Court recognizes that the First Amendment “does not \nprevent  restrictions directed  at  commerce  or  conduct  from  imposing  incidental \nburdens on speech.”  National Inst. of Family & Life Advocates v. Becerra, 585 \nU.S. 755, 769 (2018).  “States may regulate professional conduct, even though that \nconduct incidentally involves speech.”  Id. at 768.  In Planned Parenthood of \nSoutheastern  Pennsylvania  v.  Casey,  the  Court  upheld  a  provision  compelling \nphysicians to provide information to patients about the risks of abortion.  The \nplurality opinion recognized that the requirement “implicated” a physician’s First \nAmendment  rights,  “but  only  as  part  of  the  practice  of  medicine,  subject  to \nreasonable  licensing  and  regulation  by  the  State.”    Planned  Parenthood  of \nSoutheastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 884 (1992) (joint opinion of O’Connor, \nKennedy, and Souter, JJ.), overruled on other grounds by Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 231.  \nSee also Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Rounds, 686 F.3d 889, 893 (8th \nCir. 2012) (en banc) (upholding a state law compelling physicians to provide certain \ntruthful, relevant, non-misleading information).     \n \nThe question here is whether the Act regulates speech, conduct, or both.  \n“While  drawing  the  line  between  speech  and  conduct  can  be  difficult,”  the \nprecedents of the Supreme Court have long drawn that line.  Becerra, 585 U.S. at \n769.  The district court interpreted “refer” in the Act to include “informing their \npatients  where  gender  transition  treatment  may  be  available.”    Brandt,  677 \nF.Supp.3d at 924.  This court reviews de novo a district court’s interpretations of \nstate statutes.  Rounds, 686 F.3d at 893.   \n \nThis  court  “follows  the  state  [supreme]  court’s  interpretation,  or  if \nunavailable, uses that state court’s rules of construction.”  Metropolitan Omaha \nProp. Owners Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Omaha, 991 F.3d 880, 884 (8th Cir. 2021).  \nAccording to the Supreme Court of Arkansas, “when the language of the statute is \nnot ambiguous, the analysis need not go further, and we will not search for legislative \nintent; rather, the intent is gathered from the plain meaning of the language used.”  \nArkansas Dep’t of Fin. & Admin. v. Trotter Ford, Inc., 685 S.W.3d 889, 895 (Ark. \n2024).  But a statute “is considered ambiguous if it is open to more than one \n-22- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 22      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nconstruction.”  Holbrook v. Healthport, Inc., 432 S.W.3d 593, 597 (Ark. 2014).  \nSection 20-9-1502(b) of the Act is ambiguous because “refer” could be read broadly \nas  informing  patients  about  the  availability  of gender  transition  procedures,  or \nnarrowly as making a formal medical referral.  “When a statute is ambiguous, this \ncourt must interpret it according to legislative intent and our review becomes an \nexamination of the whole act. . . .  In addition, this court must look at the legislative \nhistory, the language, and the subject matter involved.”  Id.  The subject matter of \nthe Act is the medical treatment of minors.  Therefore, this court should read “refer” \naccording to its medical definition: “to send or direct for diagnosis or treatment.”  \nRefer:  Medical  Definition,  Merriam-Webster,  https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/refer#medicalDictionary (last visited July 31, 2025).  The \nwhole of the Act supports this reading.  The Act makes “unprofessional conduct” \nany “referral for or provision of” gender transition procedures for minors.  Ark. \nCode Ann. § 20-9-1504(a).  This language supports that “refer” in Section 1502(b) \nmeans a formal “referral for” treatment, not merely informing patients about the \navailability of procedures.   \n \nWhether  the  Act  “proscribes  speech,  conduct,  or  both  depends  on  the \nparticular activity in which an actor seeks to engage.”  Ness v. City of Bloomington, \n11 F.4th 914, 923 (8th Cir. 2021).  A referral for treatment is not part of the “speech \nprocess.”  Id.  Rather, a referral is part of the treatment process for gender transition \nprocedures.    The  Act  does  not  focus  on  whether  a  healthcare  professional  is \n“speaking  about  a  particular  topic.”    Barr  v.  American  Ass’n  of  Political \nConsultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610, 620 (2020) (opinion of Kavanaugh, J., for four \njustices).  Instead, the Act prohibits a “healthcare professional” from providing \ngender  transition  procedures  to  minors.    §  20-9-1502(a).    It  also  prohibits  a \n“healthcare professional” from referring minors to “any health care professional for \ngender  transition  procedures.”    §  20-9-1502(b).    The  Act  defines  “healthcare \nprofessional” as “a person who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized by the \nlaws of this state to administer health care in the ordinary course of the practice of \nhis  or  her  profession.”    § 20-9-1501(8).    Thus,  the  Act  prohibits  a  healthcare \nprofessional from referring minors to healthcare professionals for procedures that \n-23- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 23      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nthe Act prohibits them from providing.  See United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, \n783 (2023) (“Speech intended to bring about a particular unlawful act has no social \nvalue; therefore, it is unprotected.”).  To the extent the Act regulates speech, it does \nso only as an incidental effect of prohibiting the provision of gender transition \nprocedures to minors.  See Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490, 502 \n(1949) (emphasizing that “it has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of \nspeech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was \nin part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, \nwritten, or printed”).    \n \nThe healthcare professional invokes National Institute of Family and Life \nAdvocates v. Becerra.  There, the Supreme Court held that requiring healthcare \nprofessionals  to  provide  information  about  contraception  and  abortion  services \nprovided by the state was a content-based regulation of speech.  Becerra, 585 U.S. \nat 766.  But there, unlike in Casey, the compelled speech was not part of a medical \nprocedure.  Id. at 770 (observing that the requirement to provide information applied \n“regardless of whether a medical procedure is ever sought, offered, or performed”).  \nBy contrast, a referral for treatment is “part of the practice of medicine.”  See Casey, \n505 U.S. at 884.  Becerra is not helpful to the healthcare professionals, because the \nAct does not regulate “speech as speech.”  Becerra, 585 U.S. at 770.  This is not a \ncase where “the only conduct which the State sought to punish was the fact of \ncommunication.”  Otto v. Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, 866 (11th Cir. 2020) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Rather, the Act seeks to prohibit the conduct of providing \ngender transition procedures to minors.   True, a referral includes “elements of \nspeech,” such as writing, typing, or verbal communication.  Rumsfeld v. Forum for \nAcad. & Inst. Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006).  But any restriction on speech is \n“plainly incidental” to the Act’s regulation of conduct.  Id. at 62.  See K.C., 121 \nF.4th at 629–30.   \n \nReferrals  by  healthcare  professionals  for  prohibited  gender  transition \nprocedures thus receive “less protection” under the First Amendment.  Becerra, 585 \nU.S at 768.  Intermediate scrutiny applies when the burden a statute imposes on \n-24- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 24      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nprotected speech is “only incidental to the statute’s regulation of activity that is not \nprotected by the First Amendment.”  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Paxton, 145 S. Ct. \n2291, 2309 (2025); see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 459 \n(1978) (holding that a lawyer’s in-person solicitation of clients was “entitled to some \nconstitutional protection . . . subject to regulation in furtherance of important state \ninterests”).    The  Act  “survives  intermediate  scrutiny  if  it  ‘advances  important \ngovernmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not \nburden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests.’”  Free \nSpeech Coal., Inc., 145 S. Ct. at 2317, quoting Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., \n520 U.S. 180, 189 (1997).          \n \nArkansas  has  a  “compelling  interest”  in  protecting  the  physical  and \npsychological health of minors.  See Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756–57; Act 626, § 2(1), \n93rd  Gen.  Assemb.,  Reg.  Sess.  (Ark.  2021).    This  interest  is  greater  than  the \n“substantial state interest” required by intermediate scrutiny.  Becerra, 585 U.S. at \n773.   \n \nThe Act is “adequately tailored” because “the government’s interest would be \nachieved less effectively absent the regulation and the regulation does not burden \nsubstantially more speech than is necessary to further that interest.”  Free Speech \nCoal., Inc., 145 S. Ct. at 2317 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Act’s \nprohibition  on  referrals  is  “sufficiently  drawn”  to  achieve  the  state’s  interest.  \nBecerra, 585 U.S. at 773.  By prohibiting healthcare professionals from referring \n“any” minors to “any healthcare professional for gender transition procedures,” the \nAct prohibits the procedures that the state deems unsafe for minors.  Ark. Code \nAnn. § 20-9-1502(b).  The Act subjects healthcare professionals to discipline for \n“[a]ny referral,” § 20-9-1504(a), so it is not “wildly underinclusive.”  Becerra, 585 \nU.S. at 774.  The Act survives intermediate scrutiny.                       \n \n* * * * * \n \n-25- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 25      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\n  Because  the  district  court  rested  its  permanent  injunction  on  incorrect \nconclusions of law, it abused its discretion.  See Oglala Sioux Tribe, 542 F.3d at \n229.  The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings consistent \nwith this opinion.   \n \nKELLY, Circuit Judge, with whom LOKEN, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring in part \nand dissenting in part. \n \nAfter United States v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025), Plaintiffs concede in \ntheir  supplemental  briefing  that  intermediate  scrutiny  does  not  apply  to  assess \nwhether Act 626 violates the Equal Protection Clause. But this case differs from \nSkrmetti  in  an  important  respect.  Unlike  Skrmetti,  which  took  the  State’s \njustifications for its act at face value,7 this case involves factual findings from a \nlengthy trial. And those findings—none of which the State disputes on appeal—\nreveal a startling lack of evidence connecting Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming \ncare with its purported goal of protecting children. Accordingly, while I concur in \n \n7Skrmetti was  resolved  at  the preliminary  injunction  stage  and relied  on \nlegislative findings. 145 S. Ct. at 1828, 1835–36.  \n \n-26- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 26      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nthe Court’s disposition of the First Amendment claim,8 I would remand for the \ndistrict court to assess whether the Act survives rational basis review.9 \n \nI. \n   \n  After an eight-day trial, the district court made more than 300 factual findings \nabout the relationship between Act 626’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors \nand its ostensible aim of protecting children’s safety. The State disputes none of \nthese findings. I recount a subset of them here.  \n \nAs the district court found, “[t]ransgender people have a gender identity that \ndoes not align with their birth-assigned sex,” and gender dysphoria is the “significant \ndistress” associated with “[t]he lack of alignment between one’s gender identity and \ntheir sex assigned at birth.” Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 F. Supp. 3d 877, 887–88 (E.D. \nArk. 2023). The State does not dispute that “[g]ender dysphoria is a serious condition \nthat, if left untreated, can result in . . . depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicidality, and \nimpairment in functioning.” Id. at 888. Among Arkansas adolescents in need of \ngender-affirming care, “[s]uicidal ideation and self-harm were common.” Id. at 895. \nIn  general,  gender-affirming  care  includes  any  of  the  following,  alone  or  in \ncombination: psychotherapy; puberty blockers, which “paus[e] the physical changes \n \n8I read the Court’s ruling in Section IV as narrow. The Court concludes only \nthat  a  ban  on  formal  medical  referrals  does  not  directly  implicate  the  First \nAmendment. Under the Court’s interpretation of Act 626, healthcare professionals \nremain  free  to  discuss  the  possible  treatments  for  gender  dysphoria  with  their \npatients, as well as where such treatments are offered. Additionally, as the Court \nsuggests, Slip Op. 23, the Act does not appear to prohibit doctors from referring \npatients to out-of-state providers for gender affirming care. See Ark. Code. Ann. \n§ 20-9-1502(b) (prohibiting “[a] physician or other healthcare professional” from \nreferring minors “to any healthcare professional for gender transition procedures”); \nid.  § 20-9-1501(8)  (defining  a  “[h]ealthcare  professional”  as  “a  person  who  is \nlicensed, certified, or otherwise authorized by the laws of this state”).  \n  \n  9I would similarly remand for the district court to apply rational basis review \nto Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim. \n-27- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 27      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nthat come with puberty” and thus “provide[] the patient time to further understand \ntheir gender identity before initiating any irreversible medical treatments”; hormone \ntherapy, which “align[s] the body to be more congruent with the individual’s gender \nidentity,” but which is only recommended for those whose “gender incongruence \nhas lasted for years”; and, rarely, surgery. Id. at 891–93. The district court found that \nevery source of medical expertise10 supports some form of this care. Id. at 889–91. \nAnd it expressly found: “Transgender care is not experimental care.” Id. at 890. \n \nThe district court also found that the treatments Act 626 prohibits are the only \n“evidence-based treatments” available “to alleviate gender dysphoria.” Id. at 902. \n“Decades of clinical experience” in Arkansas, and numerous longitudinal and cross-\nsectional  studies,  led  to  the  undisputed  finding  “that  adolescents  with  gender \ndysphoria experience significant” and “long-term” “positive benefits to their health \nand well-being from gender-affirming medical care.” Id. at 901. “The evidence base \nsupporting  gender-affirming  medical  care”  was,  the  district  court  found, \n“comparable to the evidence base supporting other medical treatments for minors.” \nId. And while “[t]here [we]re no randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating the \nefficacy of gender-affirming medical care for adolescents,”11 “[i]t is common” to \nbase medical guidelines on the type of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies \navailable in this area. Id. at 901–02.  \n \n \n10This  includes:  “The  Arkansas  chapter  of  the  American  Academy  of \nPediatrics, the Arkansas Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of OB/GYN, \nthe American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychologists, the American Academy \nof Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Arkansas Psychological Association, . . . . \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the \nAmerican Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and the \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychology.” Id. at 889–90.  \n \n11The district court found that such a study would be impossible “because it \nwould not be ethical or feasible to have a study in which a control group is not \nprovided treatment that is known from clinical experience and research to benefit \npatients.” Id. at 902. \n \n-28- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 28      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\n  Nor did the district court find there to be “unique . . . risks of gender-affirming \nmedical care . . . that warrant[] taking this medical decision out of the hands of \nadolescent patients, their parents, and their doctors.” Id. at 902. The district court \nfound  that  the  effects  of  “[p]uberty  blockers  are  fully  reversible”:  once  “an \nadolescent discontinues such treatment, endogenous puberty will resume.” Id. at \n903. And though puberty blockers can lower bone density, patients generally return \nto a normal range within a few years of stopping them. Id. Also, those who receive \npuberty blockers for gender dysphoria typically take the drugs for substantially \nfewer years than those who take them to treat precocious puberty—precocious \npuberty being a condition for which Arkansas permits the drugs’ use. Id. at 903. \nLikewise, the district court found that “adverse health effects are rare” for hormone \ntherapies, which treat numerous conditions beyond gender dysphoria that are not \nbanned by the Act.12 Id. at 904.  \n \nThe Arkansas Children’s Hospital Gender Clinic, which the district court \nfound to be “the primary provider of gender-affirming medical care for adolescents \n. . . in Arkansas,” has treated “more than 300 patients since it opened in 2018.” Id. \nat 893. The district court found that Arkansas providers do not perform gender-\ntransition  surgeries  on  minors  with  gender  dysphoria,  but  provide  the  other \ntreatments discussed above, in accordance with applicable guidelines. Id. at 894, \n921. The “Clinic has very rarely had patients who only recently discovered their \ngender incongruence”; instead, “[t]he average length of time between when Clinic \npatients first identify as transgender and when they first tell a parent is 6.5 years.” \nId. at 895. But for any patient at the Clinic, the district court found that “the average \nlength of time between a patient’s first visit . . . and the start of hormone therapy is \nabout 10.5 months,” during which they are tested for “maturity,” “understand[ing \n \n12The Court points to the fact that chest masculinization surgeries also carry \ncertain risks. Slip Op. 13. But the district court found that in Arkansas, adolescents \ndo not receive surgeries to treat gender dysphoria. Id. at 921. And in any case, chest \nmasculinization  surgery  includes  risks  comparable  to  other  similar  procedures \nadolescents may lawfully receive in Arkansas, “including mastectomy or breast \nreduction . . . and gynecomastia surgery.” Id. at 905.   \n-29- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 29      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nof] the potential risks and benefits of treatment,” and stability of gender identity and \nmood. Id. When Clinic physicians and therapists encountered patients lacking these \nnecessary symptoms and traits, they were not considered for medical interventions, \nand according to the district court’s undisputed findings, not all patients who have \nsought the Clinic’s help have ultimately received gender-affirming treatment. Id. at \n894–95. As for the interventions themselves, at the time of trial, the Clinic had \ntreated only four adolescents with puberty blockers; additionally, hormone therapies \nwere only administered to those over the age of 14, and even then, only after certain \ncriteria  were  met,  including  “consistent  and  persistent  gender  identity,”  a \n“comprehensive” assessment by a psychologist, consultation and approval from a \ntherapist, and lab work. Id. at 894–95.  \n \nAccording  to  the  district  court’s  findings,  adolescents  can  generally \n“understand the risks[] [and] benefits” of treatment for gender dysphoria, and before \nany treatment begins, both they and their parents must provide informed consent. Id. \nat 890–91, 895. The district court found no evidence of an adolescent in Arkansas \ncoming to regret their treatment for gender dysphoria, or “to identify with their sex \nassigned at birth after medically transitioning.” Id. at 905. And the Arkansas State \nMedical Board “[wa]s not aware of any minors in Arkansas who have been harmed \nby gender-affirming care.” Id. at 908. \n \n  Arkansas’ complete prohibition of gender-affirming care for adolescents is \nunique when viewed alongside how the State regulates medical treatments for other \nconditions.  According  to  the  district  court’s  findings,  “Arkansas  does  not  ban \nmedical  treatments”  for  other  conditions,  even  where  the  treatments  “lack  . . . \nrandomized controlled clinical trials” or have “a limited evidence base.” Id. During \nthe opioid epidemic, for example, Arkansas enacted a law that imposed “incremental \nsanctions for doctors who overprescribe[d] opioids,” but the State did not ban the \ndrugs outright. Id. at 907. Gastric bypass surgery, which carries “serious risks” but \n“no guarantee of weight loss or long-term weight management,” is subject only to \n“informed  consent  requirements.”  Id.  And  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic, \nArkansas  continued  to  leave  the  decision  to  take  hydroxychloroquine  to  “the \n-30- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 30      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndiscretion  of  individual  clinicians  and  their  patients,”  despite  the  Arkansas \nDepartment  of  Health  warning  that  hydroxychloroquine  “should  be  avoided  in \nhospital and outpatient settings.” Id. (quotation omitted). Finally, the district court \nfound that “Arkansas does not ban [other] medical treatments for minors on the \nrationale that minors cannot provide informed assent.” Id. at 908. Rather, decisions \nconcerning “whether to undergo [other] care” are left to “the physician and the parent \nand the minor patient.” Id.  \n \nThe district court found that Act 626’s ban on gender-affirming care would \nexact serious and irreparable harm. Id. at 909. According to the district court’s \nfindings, “[n]ot all adolescents with gender dysphoria will live to age 18 if they are \nunable to get gender-affirming medical treatment.” Id. For Arkansas adolescents \npresently undergoing “puberty blockers or hormone therap[ies] and who would be \nforced to discontinue treatment,” the district court found “the harms are severe.” Id. \nIndeed, the State’s own expert—the only State expert who had any experience \ntreating  gender  dysphoria,  id.  at  913—called  such  a  result  “shocking”  and \n“devastating,” and indicated that doctors might simply violate Arkansas law “to help \nthose patients”—a result that could be required due to a doctor’s ethical obligation \nnot to abandon a patient,13 id. at 910. \n \nII. \n \nApplying rational basis review, “[a] court must uphold a classification so long \nas it is rationally related to any conceivable, legitimate state purpose.” Doe, I v. \n \n13The  Court’s  decision  today  leaves  open  whether,  under  Arkansas  law, \nadolescents currently undergoing gender-affirming care could avoid the undisputed \nsevere harms of ending the care pursuant to the exemptions laid out in Act 626 for \ncertain treatments of “infection, injury, disease, or disorder . . . exacerbated by the \nperformance  of  gender  transition  procedures”  or  “[a]ny  procedure  undertaken \nbecause the individual suffers from a . . . physical illness that would, as certified by \na physician, place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of major \nbodily function.” Ark. Code. Ann. § 20-9-1501(6)(B)(iii)–(iv).    \n \n-31- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 31      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nPeterson,  43  F.4th  838,  842  (8th  Cir.  2022).  But  “even  in  the  ordinary  equal \nprotection case calling for the most deferential of standards, we insist on knowing \nthe relation between the classification adopted and the object to be attained.” Romer \nv. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996). And when such an assessment reveals that a \nstate’s classification “rest[s] on an irrational prejudice against” an affected group, a \nlaw fails rational basis review. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. \n432, 450 (1985). This happens when a law’s “sheer breadth is so discontinuous with \nthe reasons offered for it that . . . [it] seems inexplicable by anything but animus \ntoward the class it affects.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632.  \n \nThe district court did not engage in rational basis analysis. But as I read its \nfindings, Act 626 plausibly fails even this deferential test. The undisputed factual \nfindings in this case show that Act 626 categorically removes the only treatment \navailable for adolescents suffering from a recognized, serious health condition. The \nfindings also show that at least some children—whose health Arkansas uses to \njustify this law—run the “risk of worsening anxiety, depression, hospitalization, and \nsuicidality” because Arkansas denies them gender-affirming care, such that “[n]ot \nall . . . will live to age 18.” Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d at 909. The Act prohibits this \ntreatment indiscriminately, regardless of the method used or its concomitant risks. \nAnd the Act prohibits puberty blockers and hormone therapies only for treating \ngender dysphoria, despite these treatments carrying the same or higher risks when \nused for different conditions. Moreover, the district court found that there was no \nevidence of any children in Arkansas who regretted or were otherwise somehow \nuniquely harmed by the treatment as prescribed by physicians in the State. In my \nview,  this  record  implies  that  the  Act  reflects  “mere  negative  attitudes,”  or \n“unsubstantiated”  “fear”—namely,  a  moral  panic  about  gender  dysphoria  in \nadolescents. Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 447–48 (concluding city’s requirement that a \nhome for people with mental disabilities get a special use permit failed rational basis \nreview because it did not require the same for other multi-person dwellings, and “the \n-32- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 32      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nrecord d[id] not reveal any rational basis for believing that the . . . home would pose \nany special threat to the” interests the city raised).14   \n \nIndeed, each of the State’s purported justifications for the Act appears to \ncrumble under the gentlest review. First, the State suggested “a lack of evidence of \nefficacy of the banned care.” Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d at 918. But the State does not \ndispute  the  district  court’s  finding  that  “decades  of  clinical  experience \ndemonstrat[ed] the efficacy of gender-affirming medical care,” and that the State \nhad offered “no evidence-based treatment alternatives.” Id. at 919. Second, the State \nhighlighted the “risks and side effects” of the banned treatments. Id. at 918. But “the \nevidence  at  trial  showed  the  risks  associated  with  gender-affirming  care  for \nadolescents  are  no  greater  than  the  risks  associated  with  many  other  medical \ntreatments that are not prohibited by Act 626,” id. at 920–21, and the Arkansas State \n \n14It is true that the Supreme Court has at times suggested that “courtroom fact-\nfinding” is not necessary when applying rational basis review. See FCC v. Beach \nCommc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993). And “[w]here there exist ‘plausible \nreasons’ for the relevant government action, ‘our inquiry is at an end.’” Skrmetti, \n145 S. Ct. at 1835 (quoting Beach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 313–14). Indeed, that was \nthe case in Skrmetti, which relied solely on unevidenced legislative findings that, \nfacially, seemed to be plausible reasons to ban gender-affirming care for minors. Id. \nat 1835–36. But this case presents a different, and unusual, situation: the district \ncourt presided over a long trial, where the State appears to have been unable to \nprovide any evidence that its ban supported the goals it claimed the Act advanced, \ndespite having every incentive to do so, as it was unclear at the time of trial what \nlevel of scrutiny would apply. The State’s failure to proffer evidentiary support, even \nif not required in retrospect, suggests the Act’s passage was inflected with irrational \nanimus, and supports a remand for the district court to determine whether the Act \nsurvives rational basis review. See New Directions Treatment Servs. v. City of \nReading, 490 F.3d 293, 312 (3d Cir. 2007) (remanding for trial on rational basis \nreview for equal protection challenge, noting that it was “inexplicable that the City \nfailed to offer any evidence to support the[] concerns” it raised as justifications for \nthe law); Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448 (concluding zoning decision failed rational basis \nreview as applied, stressing that “the record” failed to demonstrate a reason for the \ncity’s classification); see also Heller v. Doe ex rel. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321 (1993) \n(noting that “even” under rational basis review, “the standard of rationality . . . must \nfind some footing in the realities of the subject addressed by the legislation”).     \n-33- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 33      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nMedical Board “[wa]s not aware of any minors in Arkansas who have been harmed \nby gender-affirming care,” id. at 908. Third and fourth, the State argued “that many \npatients will desist in their gender incongruence” and “that some patients will later \ncome to regret” the treatments. Id. at 918. But at trial, the State could not point to a \nsingle  instance  of  such  desistance  or  regret  among  Arkansas  adolescents  who \nreceived gender-affirming care. Id. at 905–06. Fifth, the State argued “that treatment \nis being provided without appropriate evaluation and informed consent.” Id. at 918. \nBut  the district  court  found  “no  evidence  that  doctors  in Arkansas negligently \nprescribe puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones to minors,” and “the evidence \nconfirmed that doctors in Arkansas do not perform gender transition surgeries on \nany person under the age of 18.” Id. at 921. As the district court found: “The \ntestimony  of  well-credentialed  experts,  doctors  who  provide  gender-affirming \nmedical care in Arkansas, and families that rely on that care directly refutes any \nclaim by the State that the Act advances an interest in protecting children.” Id. at \n922. What appears to be left is animus. See Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1853 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (“To be sure, an individual law ‘inexplicable by anything but animus’ is \nunconstitutional.” (quoting Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 706 (2018))).  \n \nThe record suggests that the State’s “purported justifications for the [Act] \nma[k]e no sense in light of how the [State] treat[s] other groups similarly situated in \nrelevant respects.” Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 366 n.4 \n(2001) (describing Cleburne’s holding). But without knowing the proper level of \nscrutiny, the district court never “made th[e] vital inquiry” as to whether the Act \nsurvived rational basis review. Cornerstone Bible Church v. City of Hastings, 948 \nF.2d 464, 471–72 (8th Cir. 1991) (remanding for district court to apply rational basis \nreview where zoning ordinance excluding churches appeared to reflect “unequal \ntreatment of similarly situated entities” and lacked “any justification beyond the \nconclusory statements in . . . affidavits”). I would thus remand for the district court \nto explicitly address whether the Act “simply does not operate so as rationally to \nfurther” the protection of children’s health. USDA v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 535–\n37  (1973)  (holding  no  rational  basis  where  government  offered  only \n-34- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 34      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\n“unsubstantiated assumptions concerning” “hippies” to justify federal statute that \nexcluded households with unrelated occupants from accessing food stamps).  \n \nRespectfully, I dissent from the Court’s resolution of the Plaintiffs’ Equal \nProtection and Due Process claims.  \n______________________________ \n \n-35- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 35      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 ",

The Brandt decision is a national outlier \nthat adopts incorrect presumptions and fails to cite arguably the most \nrelevant precedent. And if interpreted the way plaintiffs and the district \ncourt  below  interpreted  it,  the  decision  would  impose  a  straitjacket \npreventing States in the Eighth Circuit from regulating procedures that \nSweden has said cause more harms than benefits, Finland has described \nas  experimental,  and  European  countries  and  dozens  of  States  have \ngreatly restricted.  \nThis legal issue greatly affects the ability of States to respond to a \npressing need involving health and welfare of children. The Court should \nnot hesitate to fully resolve the issue en banc.     \n1 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 5      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nARGUMENT \nBrandt affects nearly all States in the Eighth Circuit, even States \nlike Missouri that so far have faced litigation only in state court. The \nStates have a strong interest in regulating procedures deemed by an \nemerging international consensus to be too dangerous. And the Brandt \ndecision is both incorrect and an outlier nationally. \nI.  Brandt affects all States in the Eighth Circuit that have \nsimilar laws. \nFollowing significant restriction of gender transition interventions \nby European countries, every State in the Eighth Circuit but one now has \na law regulating gender transition interventions.1 All these States would \nclearly be able to enforce their laws if situated in the Sixth or Eleventh \nCircuits, but back home the Brandt decision clouds the issue. \nThis is true not only for States sued in federal district court, where \nEighth Circuit precedent is binding, but also States sued in their own \ncourts. Missouri, for example, was recently sued in state court solely \nunder the Missouri Constitution, yet the plaintiffs there relied heavily on \nBrandt because the Missouri Constitution is coextensive with the U.S. \n                                           \n1 Mo. Rev. Stat § 191.1720; Iowa Code § 147.164; Neb. Rev. Stat. § 71-\n7304; N.D. Cent. Code § 12.1-36.1; S.D. Codified Laws § 34-24-34.  \n2 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 6      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nConstitution  with  respect  to  equal  protection  and  due  process,  and \nMissouri  courts  thus  look  to  Eighth  Circuit  precedent  as  persuasive \nauthority. See Suggestions in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Noe v. Parson, \nNo. 23AC-CC04530, at 3, 26, 30, 32, 35–37, 41–43, 49, 56 (Cole Cnty. \n2023) (citing Brandt by & through Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661 (8th \nCir. 2022)); see also Glossip v. Mo. Dep’t of Transp. & Highway Patrol \nEmps.  Ret.  Sys.,  411  S.W.3d  796,  805  (Mo.  2013)  (“[T]he  Missouri \nConstitution’s equal protection clause is coextensive with the Fourteenth \nAmendment.”); Doughty v. Dir. of Revenue, 387 S.W.3d 383, 387 (Mo. \n2013)  (describing  the  “due  process  protections  of  both  our  state  and \nnational constitutions” as “coextensive”).  \nBrandt in fact creates the destabilizing possibility of state courts \nand federal courts in the same jurisdiction splitting on the same issue. \nWhile plaintiffs here argue that the Brandt decision justifies preliminary \ninjunctive relief in federal court, just three weeks ago a state court in \nMissouri, assessing the same legal issues, denied preliminary injunctive \nrelief, concluding that the plaintiffs “ha[ve] not shown probable success” \non the merits, “have not clearly shown a sufficient threat of irreparable \ninjury,” and have not rebutted arguments that “[t]he science and medical \n3 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 7      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nevidence is conflicting.” Order Denying Mot. for Prel. Inj., Noe v. Parson \n(Aug. 25, 2023). Brandt creates the risk that a State could prevail if sued \nin state court but lose if sued in federal district court. \nII.  States  in  the  Eighth  Circuit  have  a strong  interest  in \nobtaining clarity as quickly as possible in light of the \nemerging  national  consensus  against  these \ninterventions.  \nThis issue requires prompt attention because it involves urgent \nhealth and welfare concerns for children. In recent months and years, \nseveral European countries—including Sweden, Finland, Norway, and \nthe  United  Kingdom—have  greatly  restricted  the  use  of  these \ninterventions after determining that there is not sufficient evidence to \nprove safety or efficacy in light of the known and serious side effects. In \nmany of these countries, surgeries are prohibited entirely for minors, and \nhormonal interventions are allowed only in formal research protocols \n(which have not yet begun); they are not permitted in general medicine. \nSee, e.g., NHS England, Interim Service Specification 16 (2022) (stating \nthat, following rigorous reviews of the evidence, the National Health \n4 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 8      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nService  “will  only  commission  [puberty  blockers]  in  the  context  of  a \nformal research protocol”).2  \nSweden, for example, restricted the use of these interventions after \ndetermining  in  early  2022  that  “the  risks  of  puberty  suppressing \ntreatment  with  GnRH-analogues  [puberty  blockers]  and  gender-\naffirming hormonal treatment currently outweigh the possible benefits.” \nCare of Children and Adolescents with Gender Dysphoria: Summary, \nSocialstyrelsen: The National Board of Health and Welfare 3 (Feb. 2022) \n(quoted  in  Joseph  Elkadi,  et  al.,  Developmental  Pathway  Choices  of \nYoung People Presenting to a Gender Service with Gender Distress: A \nProspective Follow-Up Study, Children (Basel, Switzerland) vol. 10(2) \n314 (Feb. 2023)).3 The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \nsimilarly agreed two years ago that these interventions lack evidentiary \nsupport: “There is a lack of current evidence-based guidance for the care \nof children and adolescents who identify as transgender, particularly \nregarding  the  benefits  and  harms  of  pubertal  suppression,  medical \naffirmation with hormone therapy, and surgical affirmation.” Topic Brief: \n                                           \n2 https://perma.cc/N3CY-JYNY  \n3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9955757  \n5 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 9      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nTreatments for Gender Dysphoria in Transgender Youth, AHRQ, Nom. \nNo. 0928, at 2 (2021).4  \nWhen comparing the  speculative  benefits of  these  interventions \nwith their known risks—e.g., infertility, interference with normal brain \ndevelopment, increased rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and \ndecreased life expectancy—it is entirely reasonable for health regulators \nto follow the emerging international consensus and restrict the use of \nthese interventions. The Brandt decision, interpreted the way the district \ncourt did and plaintiffs do, threatens the ability of States to exercise one \nof their most fundamentally important sovereign functions.  \nThat sovereign function is needed now more  than ever because \nStates have seen the number of individuals seeking these interventions \nskyrocket in just the past five years. Reuters reports that the number of \nindividuals seeking these interventions tripled between 2017 and 2021. \nRespaut & Terhune, Putting Numbers on the Rise in Children Seeking \n                                           \n4 https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/system/files/docs/topic-brief-\ngender-dysphoria.pdf  \n6 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 10      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nGender Care, Reuters (Oct. 6, 2022).5 The numbers have increased even \nmore since 2021.  \nIII.  Brandt  is  a  national  outlier  and  should  be  speedily \ncorrected. \nAs Arkansas notes, every federal court of appeals to consider the \nissue after Brandt has rejected its reasoning. For good reason. As Brandt \nwas the first federal court of appeals decision to be released on this issue, \nBrandt did not have the benefit of the arguments that have percolated in \nthe past year. Brandt thus makes several fundamental errors that this \nCourt should speedily correct. This filing briefly touches on two errors.  \nFirst,  the  decision  misunderstood  how  these  statutes  operate. \nBrandt  applied  heightened  scrutiny  to  the  Arkansas  statute  on  the \ntheory  that,  under  the  statute,  “[a]  minor  born  as  a  male  may  be \nprescribed testosterone … but a minor born as a female is not permitted \nto seek the same treatment.” Brandt, 47 F.4th at 669. This premise is \nfundamentally flawed. These statutes in fact do not prohibit females from \nreceiving testosterone while allowing the same for males. Both female \nand male patients naturally have both testosterone and estrogen (though \n                                           \n5 https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-transyouth-\ndata/  \n7 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 11      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nin substantially different levels). These laws do not prohibit female (or \nmale) patients from receiving testosterone to fix, for example, a gland \nproblem. So it is not true that a “minor born male may be prescribed \ntestosterone . . . but a minor born female is not permitted to seek the \nsame treatment.” Id.  \nRather, these laws simply restrict one specific procedure: gender \ntransition.  And  they  restrict  that  procedure  regardless  of  sex  and \nregardless of whatever device or method a physician may choose to use. \nMissouri, for example, restricts using “testosterone, estrogen, or other \nandrogens” administered “for the purpose of a gender transition.” Mo. \nRev. Stat. §§ 191.1720.2(2), 191.1720.4 (emphasis added). And Arkansas’ \nlaw states that a “physician or other healthcare professional shall not \nprovide  gender  transition  procedures”  to  minors  and  defines  “gender \ntransition procedure” to include “any medical or surgical service … that \nseeks  to”  cause  gender  transition.  Ark.  Code  §§  20-9-1502(a),  20-9-\n1501(6) (emphasis added). In other words, under these laws both males \nand females can still receive testosterone or estrogen for a whole variety \nof medical purposes, but no male or female is allowed to receive any \n8 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 12      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nhormone for the purpose of gender transition. The same procedure is \nregulated the same way for both male and female patients.  \nThese laws thus plainly classify based solely on procedure, not sex, \nand are thus subject only to rational basis review because they treat \nsimilarly situated male and female patients alike, as every other federal \ncourt of appeals to address the issue has concluded. Eknes-Tucker v. Gov. \nof Alabama, No. 22-11707, 2023 WL 5344981, at *15 (11th Cir. Aug. 21, \n2023); L. W. v. Skrmetti, 73 F.4th 408, 419, 421 (6th Cir. 2023). Indeed, \nthe logic of Brandt (as interpreted by plaintiffs and the district court) \ndoes “not equalize burdens or benefits between girls and boys”; it merely \n“force[s] [States] to either ban puberty blockers and hormones for all \npurposes  or  allow  them  for  all  purposes.”  Eknes-Tucker,  2023  WL \n5344981, at *20 (Brasher, J., concurring) (emphasis in original).  \nSecond, Brandt overlooked binding Supreme Court precedent. As \nevery other court of appeals to address these issues has determined, the \nSupreme  Court’s  decision  in  Dobbs  v.  Jackson  Women’s  Health \nOrganization, 142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022), compels the conclusion that even if \nthese statutes did treat male and female patients differently (because \nmale and female patients have different natural hormone levels), that \n9 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 13      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nwould  not  raise  concerns  about  equal  protection  because  “‘[t]he \nregulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can undergo does not \ntrigger  heightened  constitutional  scrutiny.’”  Eknes-Tucker,  2023  WL \n5344981, at *17 (quoting Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2245–46); L. W., 73 F.4th \nat 419 (same). Unlike the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, Brandt did not \ncite Dobbs, presumably because Dobbs was issued just days after oral \nargument in Brandt, so the Court may not have been aware of Dobbs’ \nrelevance.  \nThe Court should waste no time in speedily correcting these flaws \nand bringing the Eighth Circuit into alignment with every other federal \ncourt of appeals to have addressed this issue.  \n   \n10 \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 14      Date Filed: 09/14/2023 Entry ID: 5318337 \n\nCONCLUSION \n  Amici States are actively addressing one of the most important \nissues affecting the health and welfare of children today.

The Act also prohibited the \nprofessionals from referring minors for gender transition procedures.  Four minors \nliving in Arkansas, their parents, and two healthcare professionals practicing there \nsued to enjoin the Arkansas Attorney General and the members of the State Medical \nBoard from enforcing the Act.  Ruling that the Act violated the First Amendment \nand both the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and Due Process \nClause, the district court issued a permanent injunction.  The Attorney General and \nthe Board appeal.  Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, this court reverses \nand remands.   \n \n \n \n \n-3- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 3      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nI.   \n \nIn 2021, the Arkansas legislature enacted, over the governor’s veto, the Save \nAdolescents from Experimentation Act, Act 626.  It prohibited physicians and other \nhealthcare  professionals  from  providing  “gender  transition  procedures  to  any \nindividual under eighteen (18) years of age.”  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-1502(a).  The \nAct also prohibited physicians and other healthcare professionals from referring \nminors to any healthcare professional for gender transition procedures.  § 20-9-\n1502(b).  The Act defined the provision of, or referral for, these procedures to minors \nas “unprofessional conduct . . . subject to discipline by the appropriate licensing \nentity or disciplinary review board.”  § 20-9-1504(a).  The Act also empowered the \nAttorney General to bring actions to enforce compliance.  § 20-9-1504(f)(1).   \n \nFour minors in Arkansas, their parents, and two healthcare professionals sued \nfor  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief.2    They  alleged  that  the  Act  violated  the \nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause, as well \nas the First Amendment.  The district court granted a preliminary injunction against \nthe enforcement of the Act.  On appeal, a panel of this court affirmed the district \ncourt, finding a likelihood of success on the merits that the Act violated the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661, 669–71 (8th \nCir. 2022).  \n \nThe case proceeded to trial on the merits.  After an eight-day bench trial, the \ndistrict court concluded that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Due \nProcess Clause, and the First Amendment.  The court permanently enjoined the \nAttorney General and the State Medical Board from enforcing the Act.  Brandt v. \nRutledge, 677 F.Supp.3d 877, 925 (E.D. Ark. 2023).   \n \n \n2Three of the four minor plaintiffs have reached age 18 and, thus, they and \ntheir parents are no longer impacted by Act 626.  The district court dismissed one \nhealthcare professional, who does not appeal.  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 F.Supp.3d \n877, 886 n.3 (E.D. Ark. 2023).    \n-4- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 4      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nThe Attorney General and the Board appeal.  This court granted an initial \nhearing of the appeal en banc.  Fed. R. App. P. 40(g).  This court reviews permanent \ninjunctions for abuse of discretion, including “where the district court rests its \nconclusion on clearly erroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.”  \nOglala Sioux Tribe v. C & W Enterprises, Inc., 542 F.3d 224, 229 (8th Cir. 2008).  \n“A permanent injunction requires the moving party to show actual success on the \nmerits . . . .  If a court finds actual success on the merits, it then considers . . . (1) the \nthreat of irreparable harm to the moving party; (2) the balance of harms with any \ninjury an injunction might inflict on other parties; and (3) the public interest.”  Id.  \n“After a bench trial, this court reviews legal conclusions de novo and factual findings \nfor clear error.”  Urban Hotel Dev. Co., Inc. v. President Dev. Group, L.C., 535 \nF.3d 874, 879 (8th Cir. 2008).   \n \nII.   \n \nThe Act defines “gender transition procedures” as “any medical or surgical \nservice” seeking to:  \n \n(i) Alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features \nthat are typical for the individual’s biological sex; or  \n \n(ii) Instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that \nresemble a sex different from the individual’s biological sex, including \nwithout  limitation  medical  services  that  provide  puberty-blocking \ndrugs,  cross-sex  hormones,  or  other  mechanisms  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of feminizing or masculinizing features in the opposite \nbiological sex, or genital or nongenital gender reassignment surgery \nperformed for the purpose of assisting an individual with a gender \ntransition. \n \nArk. Code Ann. § 20-9-1501(6)(A).   \n \n-5- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 5      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nA. \n \nThe minors argue that the Act classifies based on sex in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause.  They argue that a minor’s sex determines whether he or she can \nreceive certain medical treatments.  According to the minors, a male minor can \nreceive testosterone to masculinize his appearance, but a female minor cannot.  See \n§ 20-9-1501(2)(A)  (defining  “Cross-sex  hormones”  to  include  “Testosterone  or \nother androgens given to biological females in amounts that are larger or more potent \nthan would normally occur naturally in healthy biological sex females”).  The minors \nreason that because a minor’s sex determines whether he or she may receive certain \nmedical treatments, the Act classifies based on sex.  They conclude that the Act \nwarrants heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.        \n \nTo the contrary, as the Supreme Court explained about a similar Tennessee \nlaw, the Act classifies based only on age and medical procedure.  See United States \nv. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816, 1829 (2025).  Under the Act, just like the Tennessee \nlaw,  healthcare  professionals  “may  administer  certain  medical  treatments  to \nindividuals ages 18 and older but not to minors.”  Id.  Thus, the Act classifies based \non age.   \n \nThe Act also classifies based on medical procedure.  Under the Act, healthcare \nprofessionals may provide puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or surgery \nfor some purposes, but not “for the purpose of assisting an individual with a gender \ntransition.”    Ark.  Code  Ann.  §  20-9-1501(6)(A)(ii).    The  Act  exempts  many \nservices from its definition of “gender transition procedures,” including:  \n \n(i) Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex \ndevelopment . . . ;  \n \n(ii) Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a \ndisorder  of  sexual  development  that  the  physician  has  determined \nthrough genetic or biochemical testing that the person does not have \n-6- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 6      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nnormal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or \nsex steroid hormone action;  \n \n(iii) The treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has \nbeen caused by or exacerbated by the performance of gender transition \nprocedures . . . ; or \n \n(iv) Any procedure undertaken because the individual suffers from a \nphysical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as \ncertified by a physician, place the individual in imminent danger of \ndeath  or  impairment  of  major  bodily  function  unless  surgery  is \nperformed.   \n \n§ 20-9-1501(6)(B).  Thus, the Act classifies based on medical procedure, allowing \nsome but prohibiting others.   \n  \nThe minors argue that the Act does not classify based on medical procedure \nbecause the Act does not prohibit any specific medication, medical intervention, or \nsurgical treatment.  True, the Act prohibits “any” medical or surgical service that \nseeks to accomplish the goals described in the Act’s definition of “gender transition \nprocedures.”  § 20-9-1501(6)(A)(i), (ii).  Also, unlike the Tennessee law upheld by \nthe  Supreme  Court,  the  Act  does  not  mention  the  specific  conditions  “gender \ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, gender incongruence.”  Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-\n33-102(1).  But the Act allows healthcare professionals to address some medical \nconcerns but not others.  Like the Tennessee law, the Act’s exemptions to the \ndefinition of “gender transition procedures”  do include specific conditions that \nhealthcare professionals may treat without violating the Act.  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-\n9-1501(6)(B); cf. Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-33-103(b).  The Act allows healthcare \nprofessionals  to  provide  drugs  or  surgical  services  to  address  some  medical \nconcerns, but it bars healthcare professionals from providing those drugs or surgeries \nfor other purposes.  The Act thus classifies based on medical procedure, treating \ndifferent medical procedures differently.  \n-7- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 7      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nThe  Act  does  not  classify  based  on  sex.    A  minor  male  who  receives \ntestosterone in order to masculinize his appearance receives a different procedure \nthan a minor female who receives testosterone as a gender transition procedure.  See \nSkrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1830 (stating that an aspect of a “medical treatment” is “the \nunderlying medical concern the treatment is intended to address”).  “Both puberty \nblockers and hormones can be used to treat certain overlapping indications (such as \ngender dysphoria), and each can be used to treat a range of other conditions.  These \ncombinations of drugs and indications give rise to various medical treatments.”  Id. \n(internal citation omitted).  In fact, the district court here found: “Testosterone is \nused to treat cisgender adolescent male patients for a number of conditions including \ndelayed puberty, hypogonadism (where the brain does not tell the body to go through \npuberty), and micropenis.”  Brandt, 677 F.Supp.3d at 904.  A minor male receiving \ntestosterone for one of these conditions receives a different medical treatment than \na  minor  female  receiving  testosterone  as  a  gender  transition  procedure.    See \nSkrmetti,  145  S.  Ct.  at  1830  (“When,  for  example,  a  transgender  boy  (whose \nbiological sex is female) takes puberty blockers to treat his gender incongruence, he \nreceives a different medical treatment than a boy whose biological sex is male who \ntakes puberty blockers to treat his precocious puberty.”).  Because “no minor may \nbe administered puberty blockers or hormones” as gender transition procedures, but \n“minors of any sex may be administered puberty blockers or hormones for other \npurposes,” the Act does not classify based on sex.  Id. at 1831.  The Act classifies \nbased on age and medical procedure, not sex.    \n \nCiting Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020), the minors argue \nthat prohibiting gender transition procedures inherently discriminates on the basis of \nsex because the Act punishes a minor for seeking to acquire sex characteristics \n“different  from  the  individual’s  biological  sex.”    Ark.  Code  Ann.  § 20-9-\n1501(6)(A)(ii).  The minors reason that the Act must classify based on sex because \nit would otherwise be impossible to distinguish whether a drug or surgery for a minor \nwas permitted or prohibited.   However, the Supreme Court declined to decide \n“whether Bostock’s reasoning reaches beyond the Title VII context.”  Skrmetti, 145 \nS.  Ct.  at  1834.    Regardless,  the  Court  continued,  the  Tennessee  law  did  not \n-8- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 8      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndiscriminate on the basis of sex under the reasoning of Bostock.  The Court explained \nthat “changing a minor’s sex . . . does not alter the application” of the law.  Id.  “If \na  transgender  boy  seeks  testosterone  to  treat  his  gender dysphoria,”  the  law \n“prevents a healthcare provider from administering it to him.”  Id.  “If you change \nhis biological sex from female to male,” the law “would still not permit him the \nhormones  he  seeks  because  he  would  lack  a  qualifying  diagnosis  for  the \ntestosterone—such as a congenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical \ninjury.”  Id.  “The transgender boy could receive testosterone only if he had one of \nthose permissible diagnoses.  And, if he had such a diagnosis, he could obtain \nthe testosterone regardless of his sex.”  Id.  Like the Tennessee law, the Act prohibits \nproviding medical treatment for certain purposes, and these prohibitions apply even \nif one switches the sex of a hypothetical minor.  Thus, the Act does not discriminate \non the basis of sex.  This court need not decide whether Bostock’s reasoning applies \nin Equal Protection Clause cases because applying Bostock’s reasoning does not \nchange the outcome of this case.     \n \nThe minors assert that the Act reinforces “fixed notions” about “roles and \nabilities” tied to an individual’s sex, citing Mississippi University for Women v. \nHogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724–25 (1982).  According to them, the Act’s prohibitions \nturn on what is “typical” for an individual’s sex.  See Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-\n1501(6)(A)(i).  The minors conclude that the Act thus compels individual conformity \nto generalizations about sex.  “True, a law that classifies on the basis of sex may fail \nheightened  scrutiny  if  the  classifications  rest  on  impermissible  stereotypes.”  \nSkrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1832.  But, as the Supreme Court explained, “where a law’s \nclassifications are neither covertly nor overtly based on sex . . . we do not subject \nthe law to heightened review unless it was motivated by an invidious discriminatory \npurpose.”  Id.  A discriminatory purpose “implies that the decisionmaker, in this case \na state legislature, selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part \n‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.”  \nPersonnel Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979).  The minors do not \nallege that an invidious sex-based discriminatory purpose motivated the Arkansas \nGeneral Assembly.       \n-9- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 9      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nThe  Assembly  expressed  its  concern  that  the  “risks  of  gender  transition \nprocedures  far  outweigh  any  benefit  at  this  stage  of  clinical  study  on  these \nprocedures.”  Act 626, § 2(15), 93rd Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2021).  The \nlegislature found: \n•  “The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite \nthe lack of any long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks \nand benefits of using these drugs for . . . gender transition”;   \n•  “Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for \nchildren who experience distress at identifying with their biological \nsex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been \nconducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones \nin . . . children for the purpose of . . . gender transition”;   \n•  “The use of cross-sex hormones comes with serious known risks,” \nincluding an increase in red blood cells, severe liver dysfunction, \nheart  attacks,  strokes,  hypertension,  gallstones,  blood  clots, \nirreversible infertility, and increased risks of certain cancers;   \n•  “Genital gender reassignment surgery includes several irreversible \ninvasive  procedures  for  males  and  females  and  involves  the \nalteration of biologically healthy and functional body parts”;     \n•  “The complications, risks, and long-term care concerns associated \nwith  genital  gender  reassignment  surgery  for  both  males  and \nfemales are numerous and complex”; \n•  “Nongenital gender reassignment surgery includes various invasive \nprocedures for males and females and also involves the alteration of \nbiologically healthy and functional body parts.”     \n \nId.  at  § 2(6)(B),  (7),  (8),  10(A),  (11),  (12)(A).    “A  concern  about  potentially \nirreversible medical procedures for a child is not a form of stereotyping.”  L.W. ex \nrel. Williams v. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 485 (6th Cir. 2023), aff’d, Skrmetti, 145 S. \nCt. at 1832.  The Act does not classify based on sex.     \n \n \n-10- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 10      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nB. \n \nThe  minors  alternatively  assert  that  the  Act  discriminates  based  on \ntransgender status.  The Act defines “gender transition” as “the process in which a \nperson goes from identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to his or \nher biological sex to identifying with and living as a gender different from his or her \nbiological sex.”  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-1501(5).  This definition, the minors \nbelieve, is synonymous with being transgender.  Because the Act prohibits “gender \ntransition procedures,” the minors reason that the act classifies based on transgender \nstatus,  citing  Christian  Legal  Society  Chapter  of  the  University  of  California, \nHastings College of the Law v. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, 689 (2010).  Also, the minors \nargue that transgender status is a suspect class.  Thus, the minors conclude that the \nAct triggers heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.     \n \nTo the contrary, the Act does not classify based on transgender status.  Like \nthe Tennessee law upheld by the Supreme Court, the Act effectively divides minors \ninto two groups.  In one group are minors seeking drugs or surgeries for the purposes \nthat the Act prohibits.  In the other group are minors seeking drugs or surgeries for \npurposes the Act does not prohibit.  Although the first group may include only \nminors with transgender status, the second group “encompasses both transgender \nand nontransgender individuals.”  See Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1833.  Thus, there is a \n“lack of identity” between transgender status and the prohibited class of medical \nprocedures.  Id.  The Act, like the Tennessee law, regulates a class of procedures, \nnot people.  See id. at 1834 n.3.  The Act does not classify based on transgender \nstatus.   \n \nC.  \n \nClassifications based on age or medical procedure are evaluated under rational \nbasis review.  Id. at 1829.  Under rational basis review, a legislative classification \nwill be upheld “so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end.”  Id. at \n1828.    Here,  the  General  Assembly  found  that  the  state  “has  a  compelling \n-11- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 11      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ngovernment interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially \nvulnerable children.”  Act 626, § 2(1), 93rd Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2021).  \nIndeed,  states  have  a  “compelling”  interest  in  “safeguarding  the  physical  and \npsychological well-being of a minor.”  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756–57 \n(1982).  \n \nThe minors argue that the Act fails rational basis review under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  They do not challenge the Act’s age classification.  However, the \nminors do claim that prohibiting gender transition procedures does not bear a rational \nrelationship to the legislature’s concerns.  They emphasize that Arkansas does not \nprohibit other procedures that have similar risks and less supporting evidence.  See \nBd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 366 n.4 (2001) (noting \nthat the Court struck down an ordinance because “the city’s purported justifications \nfor the ordinance made no sense in light of how the city treated other groups similarly \nsituated in relevant respects”).  They stress that the Act permits minors to receive \nthe same medications for purposes other than gender transition procedures, even \nthough  those  medications  still  have  risks.    They  also  assert  that  the  General \nAssembly’s  concerns  cannot  justify  banning  all  gender  transition  procedures.  \nAccording to the minors, only some gender transition procedures pose risks of \ninfertility and irreversibility; puberty-blocking drugs do not.  The minors conclude \nthat the asserted justifications for the Act’s ban on all gender transition procedures \nare “impossible to credit” and the Act fails rational basis review.  See Romer v. \nEvans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 (1996).   \n \nLaws reviewed for rational basis receive a “wide latitude.”  Skrmetti, 145 S. \nCt. at 1828.  The “relatively relaxed standard” of rational basis review reflects \n“awareness that the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative \ntask and an unavoidable one.”  Id. at 1835.  “Where there exist plausible reasons for \nthe relevant government action, our inquiry is at an end.”  Id. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The legislature’s findings in Act 626 parallel Tennessee’s findings \nthat the Supreme Court held supported the law in Skrmetti.  There, “Tennessee \nconcluded that there is an ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks \n-12- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 12      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nand benefits associated with administering puberty blockers and hormones to treat \ngender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, and gender incongruence.”  Id. at 1836.  \nCompare Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-33-101(b), (h) (finding “it likely that not all \nharmful effects associated with these types of medical procedures when performed \non a minor are yet fully known, as many of these procedures, when performed on a \nminor for such purposes, are experimental in nature and not supported by high-\nquality, long-term medical studies”) (finding that “many individuals have expressed \nregret for medical procedures that were performed on or administered to them for \nsuch purposes when they were minors”), with Act 626, § 2(15), (3), 93rd Gen. \nAssemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2021) (“The risks of gender transition procedures far \noutweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.”) (finding \nthat a majority “of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at \nidentifying with their biological sex . . . come to identify with their biological sex in \nadolescence  or  adulthood,  thereby  rending  most  physiological  interventions \nunnecessary”).    \n \nHowever, the minors try to distinguish this case from Skrmetti.  They argue \nthat even under rational basis review the Act “must find some footing in the realities \nof the subject addressed by the legislation.”  Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321 (1993).  \nThey quote the district court’s factual findings that 1. “The evidence base supporting \ngender-affirming medical care for adolescents is comparable to the evidence base \nsupporting other medical treatments”; and 2. “It is common for clinical practice \nguidelines in medicine to make recommendations based on low or very low-quality \nevidence such as cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.”  Brandt, 677 F.Supp.3d \nat 901, 902.  Because Skrmetti did not have such findings of fact, the minors \nconclude that the justifications that supported the Tennessee law do not support the \nAct.  The minors also highlight that the district court did not consider their argument \nthat  legislators  were  motivated  by  negative  attitudes  about  transgender  people.  \nBecause the district court did not rule whether the Act survives rational basis review, \nthe minors ask this court to remand this case to the district court to decide that \nquestion in light of Skrmetti.  The dissent agrees.          \n \n-13- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 13      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nTo the contrary, this court can determine here that the Act survives rational \nbasis review.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 826–27 (1975) (declining to \nremand to apply the proper standard of review, because “the outcome is readily \napparent”); United States v. Beck, 140 F.3d 1129, 1131 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that \n“because the relevant facts in this case are undisputed, we need not remand for \nfurther findings and may rule based on the record currently before us”).   \n \nThe  district  court  here  found  that  there  were  risks  to  minors  from  the \nprohibited gender transition procedures.  The court found that low bone density is a \nrisk for minors using puberty-blocking drugs.  Brandt, 677 F.Supp.3d at 903.  The \ncourt found that risks for minors using cross-sex hormones include changes in \ncholesterol and blood thickness, blood clots (increasing stroke risk), and infertility.  \nId. at 904–05.  The court found that the risk of infertility from using hormones is not \n“the same regardless of the condition for which they are being used and whether they \nare used to treat birth-assigned males or birth-assigned females.”  Id. at 903.  The \ncourt acknowledged “surgical risks” of chest masculinization surgery.  Id. at 905 \n(finding that the risks were “comparable to the risks related to other chest surgeries \nadolescents may undergo”).  The court expressly found: “There are some individuals \nwho undergo gender-affirming medical treatment who later come to regret that \ntreatment and, for some, it was because they came to identify with their birth-\nassigned sex (sometimes referred to as detransitioning).”  Id. (noting that regret \n“over a medical procedure is not unique to gender-affirming medical care and is \ncommon in medicine”).  True, the district court highlighted that many medical \nassociations in Arkansas and the United States support gender transition procedures \nfor  minors  under  certain  conditions.    Id.  at  889.    But  the  district  court  also \nacknowledged that many studies underlying the associations’ guidelines for gender \ntransition procedures for minors are not of the highest scientific quality.  Id. at 901–\n02.  The district court also acknowledged the policies of Sweden, Finland, and the \nUnited Kingdom, regulating access to gender transition procedures for minors.  Id. \nat 916.  See also Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1825–26 (highlighting the policies of \nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom).  The undisputed facts found by the \n-14- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 14      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndistrict court demonstrate that there is a “reasonably conceivable state of facts that \ncould provide a rational basis for the classification” in the Act.  Id. at 1835.       \n \nBecause a conceivable state of facts supports the Act, this court will not \n“second-guess the lines” that the Act draws between gender transition procedures \nand other medical procedures.  Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1836.  See also Vance v. \nBradley, 440 U.S. 93, 108 (1979) (“Even if the classification involved here is to \nsome extent both underinclusive and overinclusive, and hence the line drawn . . . \nimperfect, it is nevertheless the rule that in a case like this ‘perfection is by no means \nrequired.’”); Danker v. City of Council Bluffs, 53 F.4th 420, 425 (8th Cir. 2022) \n(“While the resulting ordinance may be an imperfect fit, this court cannot second \nguess  or  judge  the  fairness  of  legislative  choices  on  rational  basis  review.”);  \nBirchansky v. Clabaugh, 955 F.3d 751, 758 (8th Cir. 2020) (“States are not required \nto ‘choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking a problem \nat all.’”), quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 486–87 (1970).   \n \nIndeed, the Supreme Court leaves wide discretion for medical legislation to \nthe more politically accountable bodies, especially in areas of medical uncertainty.  \nSee, e.g., Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1836 (reiterating that the Court affords states “wide \ndiscretion  to  pass  legislation  in  areas  where  there  is  medical  and  scientific \nuncertainty”);  Jacobson  v.  Massachusetts,  197  U.S.  11,  38 (1905);  Watson  v. \nMaryland, 218 U.S. 173, 180 (1910); Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 \n(1974) (cautioning that “in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties, \nlegislative options must be especially broad and courts should be cautious not to \nrewrite legislation, even assuming, arguendo, that judges with more direct exposure \nto the problem might make wiser choices”); Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 n.30 \n(1977) (reaffirming the “broad” police powers that states have in “regulating the \nadministration of drugs by health professionals”); Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. \n124, 163 (2007) (collecting cases).  Although the Act may be more restrictive than \nthe policies of other countries, under rational basis review a policy need not be “the \nbest-known” way to accomplish the state’s goals.  Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 30.  See \nalso Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1836 (“[T]he fact the line might have been drawn \n-15- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 15      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndifferently  at  some  points  is  a  matter  for  legislative,  rather  than  judicial, \nconsideration.”).  The Act is rationally related to the state’s legitimate interest in \nprotecting the well-being of minors.3  The Act passes rational basis review under the \nEqual Protection Clause.4    \n \nIII.                                                                 \n \nThe parents argue that the Act violates their right to provide appropriate \nmedical care for their children.  The Fourteenth Amendment “provides heightened \nprotection  against government interference  with  certain  fundamental  rights  and \nliberty interests.”  Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997).  Rights not \nmentioned in the Constitution are still protected by the Fourteenth Amendment if \nthey are “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the \nconcept of ordered liberty.”  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, \n231 (2022).  According to the parents, it is the right of parents to, with the child’s \nconsent and a doctor’s advice, make judgments about the medical care of their \nchildren.   \n \n  The parents invoke several Supreme Court cases upholding the rights of \nparents against the regulations of states.  A child is not “the mere creature of the \n \n3Also,  because  the  Act  bears  “a  rational  relationship  to  a  legitimate \ngovernmental purpose,” the minors’ assertion about legislators’ negative attitudes \nabout transgender people fails.  Romer, 517 U.S. at 635.  This court has held that “a \nRomer-type analysis applies only where there is no other legitimate state interest for \nthe legislation that survives scrutiny.”  Gallagher v. City of Clayton, 699 F.3d 1013, \n1021 (8th Cir. 2012).  Here, the Act is not “inexplicable by anything but animus.”  \nTrump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 706 (2018), quoting Romer, 517 U.S. at 632.  \nBecause the Act “is not the product solely of animus,” it does not “fall within the \nRomer ambit.”  Gallagher, 699 F.3d at 1021.  See Evans v. Dowd, 932 F.2d 739, \n742 (8th Cir. 1991) (declining to remand an unaddressed claim to the district court, \nbecause “review of the record” revealed that the claim “must fail on the merits”). \n  \n4This court’s opinion in Brandt ex rel. Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661 (8th \nCir. 2022), is hereby abrogated.  \n-16- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 16      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nstate.”  Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 \nU.S. 510, 535 (1925).  Parents “have the right, coupled with the high duty, to \nrecognize and prepare him for additional obligations.”  Id.  The Supreme Court has \nreasoned that this duty surely “includes a ‘high duty’ to recognize symptoms of \nillness and to seek and follow medical advice.”  Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 \n(1979).  In Parham, the Court held that its “precedents permit the parents to retain a \nsubstantial, if not the dominant, role in the decision” to voluntarily commit their \nchild to a state mental health hospital.  Id. at 604.  The Court emphasized that parents \n“retain plenary authority to seek such care for their children, subject to a physician’s \nindependent examination and medical judgment.”  Id.  Many statements by the Court \nreflect “concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor \nchildren.”  Id. at 602.  See, e.g., Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399–400 (1923) \n(describing the right to “establish a home and bring up children” as a “liberty” \nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment); Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35 (holding that \nmandating compulsory attendance at public schools “unreasonably interferes with \nthe liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children \nunder their control”); Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) \n(“The liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest of parents in the care, custody, \nand  control  of  their  children—is  perhaps  the  oldest of the  fundamental liberty \ninterests recognized by this Court.”).   \n \nMore  recently,  the  Supreme  Court  has  emphasized  the  requirement  for \n“careful  description”  when  discerning  the  unwritten  rights  protected  by  the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721.  The “doctrine of judicial \nself-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break \nnew ground in this field.”  Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993).  The Court has \nrejected recognizing a more specific right as “an integral part of a broader entrenched \nright” when that broader right itself is not absolute.  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 255–56.   \n \nThe  “rights  of  parenthood”  are  not  “beyond  limitation.”    Prince  v. \nMassachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944) (upholding the conviction of a parent for \nviolating a state child labor law by allowing her children to sell and distribute \n-17- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 17      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nreligious literature).  “Acting to guard the general interest in youth’s well being, the \nstate  as  parens  patriae  may  restrict  the  parent’s  control  by  requiring  school \nattendance, regulating or prohibiting the child’s labor, and in many other ways.”  Id.   \n \nParents do not have unlimited authority to make medical decisions for their \nchildren.    In  Parham  itself,  the  Supreme  Court  upheld  the  state’s  procedural \nprerequisites before a parent could commit his or her minor child.  Parham, 442 \nU.S. at 604.

This court finds no \nsuch right in this Nation’s history and tradition.  The Supreme Court has long \nrecognized the power of a state to regulate the medical profession to “provide for the \ngeneral welfare of its people.”  Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 122 (1889).  \nThe Court has also recognized the power of Congress to prohibit certain medical \ntreatments, despite a doctor finding them “both advisable and necessary.”  Lambert \nv. Yellowley, 272 U.S. 581, 596 (1926) (holding that Congress, in enforcing the \nEighteenth Amendment, could prohibit the prescription of alcohol for medicinal \npurposes).  See Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 166 (upholding Congress’s power to ban a \nmedical  procedure  even  when  “some  part  of  the  medical  community  were \ndisinclined to follow the proscription”); Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Dev’l \nDrugs v. Eschenbach, 495 F.3d 695, 710 n.18 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (en banc) (collecting \nSupreme Court and appellate court cases upholding state or federal laws reasonably \nprohibiting or limiting access to particular medical treatments).   \n \nGenerally, the Supreme Court has recognized that a state’s “authority over \nchildren’s activities is broader than over like actions of adults.”  Prince, 321 U.S. at \n168.  The consent of a parent does not automatically exempt a child from a regulation \nof minors.  Id. at 169 (“What may be wholly permissible for adults therefore may \nnot be so for children, either with or without their parents’ presence.”).  Given the \ntwo parallel currents in this Nation’s history and tradition—first, states can prohibit \nmedical treatments for adults and children, and second, parents cannot automatically \nexempt their children from regulations—this court does not find a deeply rooted \nright of parents to exempt their children from regulations reasonably prohibiting \ngender transition procedures.  See L.W. ex rel. Williams, 83 F.4th at 472–79, aff’d \non other grounds, Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1837; Eknes-Tucker v. Governor of \nAlabama, 80 F.4th 1205, 1220–24 (11th Cir. 2023); K.C. v. Individual Members of \nMedical Licensing Board of Indiana, 121 F.4th 604, 625–27 (7th Cir. 2024).   \n \n-20- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 20      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nNor does the Act violate this Nation’s “historical understanding of ordered \nliberty.”  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 256.  “Ordered liberty sets limits and defines the \nboundary between competing interests.”  Id.  “But the people of the various States \nmay evaluate those interests differently.”  Id.  It does not violate this Nation’s \nhistorical  concept  of  ordered  liberty  for  the  people  of  Arkansas,  through  their \nlegislature, to prohibit physicians from providing gender transition procedures for \nminors.   \n \nThis court thus evaluates the Act under rational basis review.  The Act is \nconstitutional so long as it is “rationally related to legitimate government interests.”  \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 728.  “State legislation which has some effect on individual \nliberty or privacy may not be held unconstitutional simply because a court finds it \nunnecessary, in whole or in part. . . . States have broad latitude in experimenting \nwith possible solutions to problems of vital local concern.”  Whalen, 429 U.S. at \n597.  For the same reasons described in Part II(C), the Act passes rational basis \nreview under the Due Process Clause.  See Danker, 53 F.4th at 425 (“A rational \nbasis that survives equal protection scrutiny also satisfies substantive due process \nanalysis”).    \n \nIV.   \n \n  The healthcare professional argues that the Act’s provision forbidding her to \n“refer” minors for gender transition procedures violates the First Amendment.  Ark. \nCode Ann. § 20-9-1502(b).  She emphasizes that the First Amendment protects the \n“dissemination of information.”  Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 570 \n(2011).  She argues that the restriction on referrals is content based, as the Act \nprohibits  referrals  only  for  gender  transition  procedures,  not  for  other  medical \nservices.    Laws  that  “target  speech  based  on  its  communicative  content”  are \n“presumptively unconstitutional.”  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 \n(2015). \n   \n-21- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 21      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nHowever, the Supreme Court recognizes that the First Amendment “does not \nprevent  restrictions directed  at  commerce  or  conduct  from  imposing  incidental \nburdens on speech.”  National Inst. of Family & Life Advocates v. Becerra, 585 \nU.S. 755, 769 (2018).  “States may regulate professional conduct, even though that \nconduct incidentally involves speech.”  Id. at 768.  In Planned Parenthood of \nSoutheastern  Pennsylvania  v.  Casey,  the  Court  upheld  a  provision  compelling \nphysicians to provide information to patients about the risks of abortion.  The \nplurality opinion recognized that the requirement “implicated” a physician’s First \nAmendment  rights,  “but  only  as  part  of  the  practice  of  medicine,  subject  to \nreasonable  licensing  and  regulation  by  the  State.”    Planned  Parenthood  of \nSoutheastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 884 (1992) (joint opinion of O’Connor, \nKennedy, and Souter, JJ.), overruled on other grounds by Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 231.  \nSee also Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Rounds, 686 F.3d 889, 893 (8th \nCir. 2012) (en banc) (upholding a state law compelling physicians to provide certain \ntruthful, relevant, non-misleading information).     \n \nThe question here is whether the Act regulates speech, conduct, or both.  \n“While  drawing  the  line  between  speech  and  conduct  can  be  difficult,”  the \nprecedents of the Supreme Court have long drawn that line.  Becerra, 585 U.S. at \n769.  The district court interpreted “refer” in the Act to include “informing their \npatients  where  gender  transition  treatment  may  be  available.”    Brandt,  677 \nF.Supp.3d at 924.  This court reviews de novo a district court’s interpretations of \nstate statutes.  Rounds, 686 F.3d at 893.   \n \nThis  court  “follows  the  state  [supreme]  court’s  interpretation,  or  if \nunavailable, uses that state court’s rules of construction.”  Metropolitan Omaha \nProp. Owners Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Omaha, 991 F.3d 880, 884 (8th Cir. 2021).  \nAccording to the Supreme Court of Arkansas, “when the language of the statute is \nnot ambiguous, the analysis need not go further, and we will not search for legislative \nintent; rather, the intent is gathered from the plain meaning of the language used.”  \nArkansas Dep’t of Fin. & Admin. v. Trotter Ford, Inc., 685 S.W.3d 889, 895 (Ark. \n2024).  But a statute “is considered ambiguous if it is open to more than one \n-22- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 22      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nconstruction.”  Holbrook v. Healthport, Inc., 432 S.W.3d 593, 597 (Ark. 2014).  \nSection 20-9-1502(b) of the Act is ambiguous because “refer” could be read broadly \nas  informing  patients  about  the  availability  of gender  transition  procedures,  or \nnarrowly as making a formal medical referral.  “When a statute is ambiguous, this \ncourt must interpret it according to legislative intent and our review becomes an \nexamination of the whole act. . . .  In addition, this court must look at the legislative \nhistory, the language, and the subject matter involved.”  Id.  The subject matter of \nthe Act is the medical treatment of minors.  Therefore, this court should read “refer” \naccording to its medical definition: “to send or direct for diagnosis or treatment.”  \nRefer:  Medical  Definition,  Merriam-Webster,  https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/refer#medicalDictionary (last visited July 31, 2025).  The \nwhole of the Act supports this reading.  The Act makes “unprofessional conduct” \nany “referral for or provision of” gender transition procedures for minors.  Ark. \nCode Ann. § 20-9-1504(a).  This language supports that “refer” in Section 1502(b) \nmeans a formal “referral for” treatment, not merely informing patients about the \navailability of procedures.   \n \nWhether  the  Act  “proscribes  speech,  conduct,  or  both  depends  on  the \nparticular activity in which an actor seeks to engage.”  Ness v. City of Bloomington, \n11 F.4th 914, 923 (8th Cir. 2021).  A referral for treatment is not part of the “speech \nprocess.”  Id.  Rather, a referral is part of the treatment process for gender transition \nprocedures.    The  Act  does  not  focus  on  whether  a  healthcare  professional  is \n“speaking  about  a  particular  topic.”    Barr  v.  American  Ass’n  of  Political \nConsultants, Inc., 591 U.S. 610, 620 (2020) (opinion of Kavanaugh, J., for four \njustices).  Instead, the Act prohibits a “healthcare professional” from providing \ngender  transition  procedures  to  minors.    §  20-9-1502(a).    It  also  prohibits  a \n“healthcare professional” from referring minors to “any health care professional for \ngender  transition  procedures.”    §  20-9-1502(b).    The  Act  defines  “healthcare \nprofessional” as “a person who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized by the \nlaws of this state to administer health care in the ordinary course of the practice of \nhis  or  her  profession.”    § 20-9-1501(8).    Thus,  the  Act  prohibits  a  healthcare \nprofessional from referring minors to healthcare professionals for procedures that \n-23- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 23      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nthe Act prohibits them from providing.  See United States v. Hansen, 599 U.S. 762, \n783 (2023) (“Speech intended to bring about a particular unlawful act has no social \nvalue; therefore, it is unprotected.”).  To the extent the Act regulates speech, it does \nso only as an incidental effect of prohibiting the provision of gender transition \nprocedures to minors.  See Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.S. 490, 502 \n(1949) (emphasizing that “it has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of \nspeech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was \nin part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, \nwritten, or printed”).    \n \nThe healthcare professional invokes National Institute of Family and Life \nAdvocates v. Becerra.  There, the Supreme Court held that requiring healthcare \nprofessionals  to  provide  information  about  contraception  and  abortion  services \nprovided by the state was a content-based regulation of speech.  Becerra, 585 U.S. \nat 766.  But there, unlike in Casey, the compelled speech was not part of a medical \nprocedure.  Id. at 770 (observing that the requirement to provide information applied \n“regardless of whether a medical procedure is ever sought, offered, or performed”).  \nBy contrast, a referral for treatment is “part of the practice of medicine.”  See Casey, \n505 U.S. at 884.  Becerra is not helpful to the healthcare professionals, because the \nAct does not regulate “speech as speech.”  Becerra, 585 U.S. at 770.  This is not a \ncase where “the only conduct which the State sought to punish was the fact of \ncommunication.”  Otto v. Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, 866 (11th Cir. 2020) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Rather, the Act seeks to prohibit the conduct of providing \ngender transition procedures to minors.   True, a referral includes “elements of \nspeech,” such as writing, typing, or verbal communication.  Rumsfeld v. Forum for \nAcad. & Inst. Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006).  But any restriction on speech is \n“plainly incidental” to the Act’s regulation of conduct.  Id. at 62.  See K.C., 121 \nF.4th at 629–30.   \n \nReferrals  by  healthcare  professionals  for  prohibited  gender  transition \nprocedures thus receive “less protection” under the First Amendment.  Becerra, 585 \nU.S at 768.  Intermediate scrutiny applies when the burden a statute imposes on \n-24- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 24      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nprotected speech is “only incidental to the statute’s regulation of activity that is not \nprotected by the First Amendment.”  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Paxton, 145 S. Ct. \n2291, 2309 (2025); see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U.S. 447, 459 \n(1978) (holding that a lawyer’s in-person solicitation of clients was “entitled to some \nconstitutional protection . . . subject to regulation in furtherance of important state \ninterests”).    The  Act  “survives  intermediate  scrutiny  if  it  ‘advances  important \ngovernmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not \nburden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests.’”  Free \nSpeech Coal., Inc., 145 S. Ct. at 2317, quoting Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., \n520 U.S. 180, 189 (1997).          \n \nArkansas  has  a  “compelling  interest”  in  protecting  the  physical  and \npsychological health of minors.  See Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756–57; Act 626, § 2(1), \n93rd  Gen.  Assemb.,  Reg.  Sess.  (Ark.  2021).    This  interest  is  greater  than  the \n“substantial state interest” required by intermediate scrutiny.  Becerra, 585 U.S. at \n773.   \n \nThe Act is “adequately tailored” because “the government’s interest would be \nachieved less effectively absent the regulation and the regulation does not burden \nsubstantially more speech than is necessary to further that interest.”  Free Speech \nCoal., Inc., 145 S. Ct. at 2317 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Act’s \nprohibition  on  referrals  is  “sufficiently  drawn”  to  achieve  the  state’s  interest.  \nBecerra, 585 U.S. at 773.  By prohibiting healthcare professionals from referring \n“any” minors to “any healthcare professional for gender transition procedures,” the \nAct prohibits the procedures that the state deems unsafe for minors.  Ark. Code \nAnn. § 20-9-1502(b).  The Act subjects healthcare professionals to discipline for \n“[a]ny referral,” § 20-9-1504(a), so it is not “wildly underinclusive.”  Becerra, 585 \nU.S. at 774.  The Act survives intermediate scrutiny.                       \n \n* * * * * \n \n-25- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 25      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\n  Because  the  district  court  rested  its  permanent  injunction  on  incorrect \nconclusions of law, it abused its discretion.  See Oglala Sioux Tribe, 542 F.3d at \n229.  The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings consistent \nwith this opinion.   \n \nKELLY, Circuit Judge, with whom LOKEN, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring in part \nand dissenting in part. \n \nAfter United States v. Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. 1816 (2025), Plaintiffs concede in \ntheir  supplemental  briefing  that  intermediate  scrutiny  does  not  apply  to  assess \nwhether Act 626 violates the Equal Protection Clause. But this case differs from \nSkrmetti  in  an  important  respect.  Unlike  Skrmetti,  which  took  the  State’s \njustifications for its act at face value,7 this case involves factual findings from a \nlengthy trial. And those findings—none of which the State disputes on appeal—\nreveal a startling lack of evidence connecting Arkansas’ ban on gender-affirming \ncare with its purported goal of protecting children. Accordingly, while I concur in \n \n7Skrmetti was  resolved  at  the preliminary  injunction  stage  and relied  on \nlegislative findings. 145 S. Ct. at 1828, 1835–36.  \n \n-26- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 26      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nthe Court’s disposition of the First Amendment claim,8 I would remand for the \ndistrict court to assess whether the Act survives rational basis review.9 \n \nI. \n   \n  After an eight-day trial, the district court made more than 300 factual findings \nabout the relationship between Act 626’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors \nand its ostensible aim of protecting children’s safety. The State disputes none of \nthese findings. I recount a subset of them here.  \n \nAs the district court found, “[t]ransgender people have a gender identity that \ndoes not align with their birth-assigned sex,” and gender dysphoria is the “significant \ndistress” associated with “[t]he lack of alignment between one’s gender identity and \ntheir sex assigned at birth.” Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 F. Supp. 3d 877, 887–88 (E.D. \nArk. 2023). The State does not dispute that “[g]ender dysphoria is a serious condition \nthat, if left untreated, can result in . . . depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicidality, and \nimpairment in functioning.” Id. at 888. Among Arkansas adolescents in need of \ngender-affirming care, “[s]uicidal ideation and self-harm were common.” Id. at 895. \nIn  general,  gender-affirming  care  includes  any  of  the  following,  alone  or  in \ncombination: psychotherapy; puberty blockers, which “paus[e] the physical changes \n \n8I read the Court’s ruling in Section IV as narrow. The Court concludes only \nthat  a  ban  on  formal  medical  referrals  does  not  directly  implicate  the  First \nAmendment. Under the Court’s interpretation of Act 626, healthcare professionals \nremain  free  to  discuss  the  possible  treatments  for  gender  dysphoria  with  their \npatients, as well as where such treatments are offered. Additionally, as the Court \nsuggests, Slip Op. 23, the Act does not appear to prohibit doctors from referring \npatients to out-of-state providers for gender affirming care. See Ark. Code. Ann. \n§ 20-9-1502(b) (prohibiting “[a] physician or other healthcare professional” from \nreferring minors “to any healthcare professional for gender transition procedures”); \nid.  § 20-9-1501(8)  (defining  a  “[h]ealthcare  professional”  as  “a  person  who  is \nlicensed, certified, or otherwise authorized by the laws of this state”).  \n  \n  9I would similarly remand for the district court to apply rational basis review \nto Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim. \n-27- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 27      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nthat come with puberty” and thus “provide[] the patient time to further understand \ntheir gender identity before initiating any irreversible medical treatments”; hormone \ntherapy, which “align[s] the body to be more congruent with the individual’s gender \nidentity,” but which is only recommended for those whose “gender incongruence \nhas lasted for years”; and, rarely, surgery. Id. at 891–93. The district court found that \nevery source of medical expertise10 supports some form of this care. Id. at 889–91. \nAnd it expressly found: “Transgender care is not experimental care.” Id. at 890. \n \nThe district court also found that the treatments Act 626 prohibits are the only \n“evidence-based treatments” available “to alleviate gender dysphoria.” Id. at 902. \n“Decades of clinical experience” in Arkansas, and numerous longitudinal and cross-\nsectional  studies,  led  to  the  undisputed  finding  “that  adolescents  with  gender \ndysphoria experience significant” and “long-term” “positive benefits to their health \nand well-being from gender-affirming medical care.” Id. at 901. “The evidence base \nsupporting  gender-affirming  medical  care”  was,  the  district  court  found, \n“comparable to the evidence base supporting other medical treatments for minors.” \nId. And while “[t]here [we]re no randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating the \nefficacy of gender-affirming medical care for adolescents,”11 “[i]t is common” to \nbase medical guidelines on the type of longitudinal and cross-sectional studies \navailable in this area. Id. at 901–02.  \n \n \n10This  includes:  “The  Arkansas  chapter  of  the  American  Academy  of \nPediatrics, the Arkansas Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of OB/GYN, \nthe American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychologists, the American Academy \nof Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the Arkansas Psychological Association, . . . . \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the \nAmerican Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and the \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychology.” Id. at 889–90.  \n \n11The district court found that such a study would be impossible “because it \nwould not be ethical or feasible to have a study in which a control group is not \nprovided treatment that is known from clinical experience and research to benefit \npatients.” Id. at 902. \n \n-28- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 28      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\n  Nor did the district court find there to be “unique . . . risks of gender-affirming \nmedical care . . . that warrant[] taking this medical decision out of the hands of \nadolescent patients, their parents, and their doctors.” Id. at 902. The district court \nfound  that  the  effects  of  “[p]uberty  blockers  are  fully  reversible”:  once  “an \nadolescent discontinues such treatment, endogenous puberty will resume.” Id. at \n903. And though puberty blockers can lower bone density, patients generally return \nto a normal range within a few years of stopping them. Id. Also, those who receive \npuberty blockers for gender dysphoria typically take the drugs for substantially \nfewer years than those who take them to treat precocious puberty—precocious \npuberty being a condition for which Arkansas permits the drugs’ use. Id. at 903. \nLikewise, the district court found that “adverse health effects are rare” for hormone \ntherapies, which treat numerous conditions beyond gender dysphoria that are not \nbanned by the Act.12 Id. at 904.  \n \nThe Arkansas Children’s Hospital Gender Clinic, which the district court \nfound to be “the primary provider of gender-affirming medical care for adolescents \n. . . in Arkansas,” has treated “more than 300 patients since it opened in 2018.” Id. \nat 893. The district court found that Arkansas providers do not perform gender-\ntransition  surgeries  on  minors  with  gender  dysphoria,  but  provide  the  other \ntreatments discussed above, in accordance with applicable guidelines. Id. at 894, \n921. The “Clinic has very rarely had patients who only recently discovered their \ngender incongruence”; instead, “[t]he average length of time between when Clinic \npatients first identify as transgender and when they first tell a parent is 6.5 years.” \nId. at 895. But for any patient at the Clinic, the district court found that “the average \nlength of time between a patient’s first visit . . . and the start of hormone therapy is \nabout 10.5 months,” during which they are tested for “maturity,” “understand[ing \n \n12The Court points to the fact that chest masculinization surgeries also carry \ncertain risks. Slip Op. 13. But the district court found that in Arkansas, adolescents \ndo not receive surgeries to treat gender dysphoria. Id. at 921. And in any case, chest \nmasculinization  surgery  includes  risks  comparable  to  other  similar  procedures \nadolescents may lawfully receive in Arkansas, “including mastectomy or breast \nreduction . . . and gynecomastia surgery.” Id. at 905.   \n-29- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 29      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nof] the potential risks and benefits of treatment,” and stability of gender identity and \nmood. Id. When Clinic physicians and therapists encountered patients lacking these \nnecessary symptoms and traits, they were not considered for medical interventions, \nand according to the district court’s undisputed findings, not all patients who have \nsought the Clinic’s help have ultimately received gender-affirming treatment. Id. at \n894–95. As for the interventions themselves, at the time of trial, the Clinic had \ntreated only four adolescents with puberty blockers; additionally, hormone therapies \nwere only administered to those over the age of 14, and even then, only after certain \ncriteria  were  met,  including  “consistent  and  persistent  gender  identity,”  a \n“comprehensive” assessment by a psychologist, consultation and approval from a \ntherapist, and lab work. Id. at 894–95.  \n \nAccording  to  the  district  court’s  findings,  adolescents  can  generally \n“understand the risks[] [and] benefits” of treatment for gender dysphoria, and before \nany treatment begins, both they and their parents must provide informed consent. Id. \nat 890–91, 895. The district court found no evidence of an adolescent in Arkansas \ncoming to regret their treatment for gender dysphoria, or “to identify with their sex \nassigned at birth after medically transitioning.” Id. at 905. And the Arkansas State \nMedical Board “[wa]s not aware of any minors in Arkansas who have been harmed \nby gender-affirming care.” Id. at 908. \n \n  Arkansas’ complete prohibition of gender-affirming care for adolescents is \nunique when viewed alongside how the State regulates medical treatments for other \nconditions.  According  to  the  district  court’s  findings,  “Arkansas  does  not  ban \nmedical  treatments”  for  other  conditions,  even  where  the  treatments  “lack  . . . \nrandomized controlled clinical trials” or have “a limited evidence base.” Id. During \nthe opioid epidemic, for example, Arkansas enacted a law that imposed “incremental \nsanctions for doctors who overprescribe[d] opioids,” but the State did not ban the \ndrugs outright. Id. at 907. Gastric bypass surgery, which carries “serious risks” but \n“no guarantee of weight loss or long-term weight management,” is subject only to \n“informed  consent  requirements.”  Id.  And  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic, \nArkansas  continued  to  leave  the  decision  to  take  hydroxychloroquine  to  “the \n-30- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 30      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\ndiscretion  of  individual  clinicians  and  their  patients,”  despite  the  Arkansas \nDepartment  of  Health  warning  that  hydroxychloroquine  “should  be  avoided  in \nhospital and outpatient settings.” Id. (quotation omitted). Finally, the district court \nfound that “Arkansas does not ban [other] medical treatments for minors on the \nrationale that minors cannot provide informed assent.” Id. at 908. Rather, decisions \nconcerning “whether to undergo [other] care” are left to “the physician and the parent \nand the minor patient.” Id.  \n \nThe district court found that Act 626’s ban on gender-affirming care would \nexact serious and irreparable harm. Id. at 909. According to the district court’s \nfindings, “[n]ot all adolescents with gender dysphoria will live to age 18 if they are \nunable to get gender-affirming medical treatment.” Id. For Arkansas adolescents \npresently undergoing “puberty blockers or hormone therap[ies] and who would be \nforced to discontinue treatment,” the district court found “the harms are severe.” Id. \nIndeed, the State’s own expert—the only State expert who had any experience \ntreating  gender  dysphoria,  id.  at  913—called  such  a  result  “shocking”  and \n“devastating,” and indicated that doctors might simply violate Arkansas law “to help \nthose patients”—a result that could be required due to a doctor’s ethical obligation \nnot to abandon a patient,13 id. at 910. \n \nII. \n \nApplying rational basis review, “[a] court must uphold a classification so long \nas it is rationally related to any conceivable, legitimate state purpose.” Doe, I v. \n \n13The  Court’s  decision  today  leaves  open  whether,  under  Arkansas  law, \nadolescents currently undergoing gender-affirming care could avoid the undisputed \nsevere harms of ending the care pursuant to the exemptions laid out in Act 626 for \ncertain treatments of “infection, injury, disease, or disorder . . . exacerbated by the \nperformance  of  gender  transition  procedures”  or  “[a]ny  procedure  undertaken \nbecause the individual suffers from a . . . physical illness that would, as certified by \na physician, place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of major \nbodily function.” Ark. Code. Ann. § 20-9-1501(6)(B)(iii)–(iv).    \n \n-31- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 31      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nPeterson,  43  F.4th  838,  842  (8th  Cir.  2022).  But  “even  in  the  ordinary  equal \nprotection case calling for the most deferential of standards, we insist on knowing \nthe relation between the classification adopted and the object to be attained.” Romer \nv. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996). And when such an assessment reveals that a \nstate’s classification “rest[s] on an irrational prejudice against” an affected group, a \nlaw fails rational basis review. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. \n432, 450 (1985). This happens when a law’s “sheer breadth is so discontinuous with \nthe reasons offered for it that . . . [it] seems inexplicable by anything but animus \ntoward the class it affects.” Romer, 517 U.S. at 632.  \n \nThe district court did not engage in rational basis analysis. But as I read its \nfindings, Act 626 plausibly fails even this deferential test. The undisputed factual \nfindings in this case show that Act 626 categorically removes the only treatment \navailable for adolescents suffering from a recognized, serious health condition. The \nfindings also show that at least some children—whose health Arkansas uses to \njustify this law—run the “risk of worsening anxiety, depression, hospitalization, and \nsuicidality” because Arkansas denies them gender-affirming care, such that “[n]ot \nall . . . will live to age 18.” Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d at 909. The Act prohibits this \ntreatment indiscriminately, regardless of the method used or its concomitant risks. \nAnd the Act prohibits puberty blockers and hormone therapies only for treating \ngender dysphoria, despite these treatments carrying the same or higher risks when \nused for different conditions. Moreover, the district court found that there was no \nevidence of any children in Arkansas who regretted or were otherwise somehow \nuniquely harmed by the treatment as prescribed by physicians in the State. In my \nview,  this  record  implies  that  the  Act  reflects  “mere  negative  attitudes,”  or \n“unsubstantiated”  “fear”—namely,  a  moral  panic  about  gender  dysphoria  in \nadolescents. Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 447–48 (concluding city’s requirement that a \nhome for people with mental disabilities get a special use permit failed rational basis \nreview because it did not require the same for other multi-person dwellings, and “the \n-32- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 32      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nrecord d[id] not reveal any rational basis for believing that the . . . home would pose \nany special threat to the” interests the city raised).14   \n \nIndeed, each of the State’s purported justifications for the Act appears to \ncrumble under the gentlest review. First, the State suggested “a lack of evidence of \nefficacy of the banned care.” Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d at 918. But the State does not \ndispute  the  district  court’s  finding  that  “decades  of  clinical  experience \ndemonstrat[ed] the efficacy of gender-affirming medical care,” and that the State \nhad offered “no evidence-based treatment alternatives.” Id. at 919. Second, the State \nhighlighted the “risks and side effects” of the banned treatments. Id. at 918. But “the \nevidence  at  trial  showed  the  risks  associated  with  gender-affirming  care  for \nadolescents  are  no  greater  than  the  risks  associated  with  many  other  medical \ntreatments that are not prohibited by Act 626,” id. at 920–21, and the Arkansas State \n \n14It is true that the Supreme Court has at times suggested that “courtroom fact-\nfinding” is not necessary when applying rational basis review. See FCC v. Beach \nCommc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993). And “[w]here there exist ‘plausible \nreasons’ for the relevant government action, ‘our inquiry is at an end.’” Skrmetti, \n145 S. Ct. at 1835 (quoting Beach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 313–14). Indeed, that was \nthe case in Skrmetti, which relied solely on unevidenced legislative findings that, \nfacially, seemed to be plausible reasons to ban gender-affirming care for minors. Id. \nat 1835–36. But this case presents a different, and unusual, situation: the district \ncourt presided over a long trial, where the State appears to have been unable to \nprovide any evidence that its ban supported the goals it claimed the Act advanced, \ndespite having every incentive to do so, as it was unclear at the time of trial what \nlevel of scrutiny would apply. The State’s failure to proffer evidentiary support, even \nif not required in retrospect, suggests the Act’s passage was inflected with irrational \nanimus, and supports a remand for the district court to determine whether the Act \nsurvives rational basis review. See New Directions Treatment Servs. v. City of \nReading, 490 F.3d 293, 312 (3d Cir. 2007) (remanding for trial on rational basis \nreview for equal protection challenge, noting that it was “inexplicable that the City \nfailed to offer any evidence to support the[] concerns” it raised as justifications for \nthe law); Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 448 (concluding zoning decision failed rational basis \nreview as applied, stressing that “the record” failed to demonstrate a reason for the \ncity’s classification); see also Heller v. Doe ex rel. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321 (1993) \n(noting that “even” under rational basis review, “the standard of rationality . . . must \nfind some footing in the realities of the subject addressed by the legislation”).     \n-33- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 33      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\nMedical Board “[wa]s not aware of any minors in Arkansas who have been harmed \nby gender-affirming care,” id. at 908. Third and fourth, the State argued “that many \npatients will desist in their gender incongruence” and “that some patients will later \ncome to regret” the treatments. Id. at 918. But at trial, the State could not point to a \nsingle  instance  of  such  desistance  or  regret  among  Arkansas  adolescents  who \nreceived gender-affirming care. Id. at 905–06. Fifth, the State argued “that treatment \nis being provided without appropriate evaluation and informed consent.” Id. at 918. \nBut  the district  court  found  “no  evidence  that  doctors  in Arkansas negligently \nprescribe puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones to minors,” and “the evidence \nconfirmed that doctors in Arkansas do not perform gender transition surgeries on \nany person under the age of 18.” Id. at 921. As the district court found: “The \ntestimony  of  well-credentialed  experts,  doctors  who  provide  gender-affirming \nmedical care in Arkansas, and families that rely on that care directly refutes any \nclaim by the State that the Act advances an interest in protecting children.” Id. at \n922. What appears to be left is animus. See Skrmetti, 145 S. Ct. at 1853 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (“To be sure, an individual law ‘inexplicable by anything but animus’ is \nunconstitutional.” (quoting Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 706 (2018))).  \n \nThe record suggests that the State’s “purported justifications for the [Act] \nma[k]e no sense in light of how the [State] treat[s] other groups similarly situated in \nrelevant respects.” Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 366 n.4 \n(2001) (describing Cleburne’s holding). But without knowing the proper level of \nscrutiny, the district court never “made th[e] vital inquiry” as to whether the Act \nsurvived rational basis review. Cornerstone Bible Church v. City of Hastings, 948 \nF.2d 464, 471–72 (8th Cir. 1991) (remanding for district court to apply rational basis \nreview where zoning ordinance excluding churches appeared to reflect “unequal \ntreatment of similarly situated entities” and lacked “any justification beyond the \nconclusory statements in . . . affidavits”). I would thus remand for the district court \nto explicitly address whether the Act “simply does not operate so as rationally to \nfurther” the protection of children’s health. USDA v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 535–\n37  (1973)  (holding  no  rational  basis  where  government  offered  only \n-34- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 34      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 \n\n“unsubstantiated assumptions concerning” “hippies” to justify federal statute that \nexcluded households with unrelated occupants from accessing food stamps).  \n \nRespectfully, I dissent from the Court’s resolution of the Plaintiffs’ Equal \nProtection and Due Process claims.  \n______________________________ \n \n-35- \n \nAppellate Case: 23-2681     Page: 35      Date Filed: 08/12/2025 Entry ID: 5546855 ",

Act 626 § 3, 93rd Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ark. 2021) (to be codified at Ark. \nCode Ann.§ 20-9-1502(a)-(b)). Plaintiffs have filed a private action challenging the law on \n1 Under 28 U.S.C. § 517, \"[t]he Solicitor General, or any officer of the Department of Justice, may be sent by the \nAttorney General to any State or district in the United States to attend to the interests of the United States in a suit \npending in a court of the United States, or in a court of a State, or to attend to any other interest of the United \nStates.\" Id.; see also Jones Truck Lines, Inc. v. AFCO Steel, Inc., 849 F. Supp. 1296, 1305 n.4 (E.D. Ark. 1994) \n(recognizing that the United States may \"assert to a court its position ... in matters of significant interest\"). \n2 The term \"transgender\" refers to a person whose gender identity differs from the person's assigned sex at birth, \nwhereas the te1m \"cisgender\" refers to a person whose gender identity is the same as the person's assigned sex at \nbirth. For example, a transgender girl is a person who identifies as a girl but whose sex assigned at birth was male. \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 2 of 28\nmultiple grounds, including the Equal Protection Clause. The United States files this Statement \nof Interest in support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, as Act 626 cannot survive \nthe heightened scrutiny to which it must be subjected and therefore would violate the Equal \nProtection Clause if allowed to go into effect. \nThis case implicates important federal interests. The United States is charged with \nprotecting the civil rights of individuals seeking nondiscriminatory access to healthcare in a \nrange of health programs and activities under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 18116. The Department of Justice is further charged with the coordination and \nimplementation of federal nondiscrimination laws that protect individuals against discrimination \non the basis of sex in a wide range of federally-funded programs and activities, including, but not \nlimited to, the provision ofhealthcare. Exec. Order No. 12250, § 1-201, 45 Fed. Reg. 72,995 \n(Nov. 4, 1980). \nThe United States has a strong interest in protecting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, \nand transgender individuals. To that end, the President has issued an Executive Order that \nrecognizes the right of all persons to \"be treated with respect and dignity,\" \"to access healthcare \n... without being subjected to sex discrimination,\" and to \"receive equal treatment under the \nlaw, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation.\" Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. Reg. \n7,023 (Jan. 25, 2021 ). The United States also recently filed a Statement oflnterest in Diamond v. \nWard, No. 5:20-cv-00453-MTT (M.D. Ga., Apr. 22, 2021), regarding the inadequacy, under the \nEighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, of medical treatment for gender dysphoria that was \nprovided to a trans gender woman while in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections. \nAct 626 specifically and discriminatorily denies transgender minors, and only \ntransgender minors, the ability to receive medically necessary care based solely on their sex \n2 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 3 of 28\nassigned at birth. Discriminating against transgender minors in this manner violates the Equal \nProtection Clause. Such discrimination would be justified only if Arkansas could show that it is \nsubstantially related to achieving an important governmental interest. Arkansas cannot make that \nshowing. For this reason, the United States believes that Plaintiffs' Equal Protection challenge to \nAct 626 is likely to succeed on the merits. \nBACKGROUND \nAct 626 was passed into law on April 6, 2021 by a simple majority of the General \nAssembly, overcoming a Governor's veto less than 24 hours prior. The Act states that \"a \nphysician or other healthcare professional shall not provide gender transition procedures to any \nindividual under eighteen ( 18) years of age,\" nor refer any individual to another healthcare \nprofessional for the same. Act 626 § 3 (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-l 502(a)-(b) ). The \nlegislature's proffered justification for this Act is that \"the risks of gender transition procedures \nfar outweigh the benefits at this stage of clinical study on these procedures.\" Id. § 2(15). For \npurposes of Act 626, \"gender transition procedures\" include any: \nmedical or surgical service, including without limitation physician's services, \ninpatient and outpatient hospital services, or prescribed drugs related to gender \ntransition that seeks to: (i) Alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics \nor features that are typical for the individual's biological sex; or (ii) Instill or \ncreate physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex different \nfrom the individual's biological sex ... \nId. § 3 (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-1501(6)). Act 626 defines \"biological sex\" to \nmean: \nthe biological indication of male and female in the context of reproductive \npotential or capacity, such as sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex \nhormones, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia present at \nbirth, without regard to an individual's psychological, chosen, or subjective \nexperience of gender. \n3 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 4 of 28\nId. (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-1501(1)).3 Act 626's definition of\"gender transition\" \nsurgeries does not include procedures provided to individuals under eighteen years of age who \nhave a medically verified or diagnosed \"disorder of sex development.\"4 Id. (to be codified at \nArk. Code Ann. 20-9-1502( c )(I), (2)). Under the law, any healthcare professional who provides \na gender transition procedure to a minor, or makes a referral for such a procedure, is subject to \ndiscipline by a licensing entity or disciplinary review board. Id. (to be codified at Ark. Code \nAnn. 20-9-1504(a)). Further, they face legal liability in a judicial or administrative proceeding \nfor any \"actual or threatened violation\" of the Act. Id. (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-\n1504(b)). \nOn May 25, 2021, Plaintiffs filed this action against Leslie Rutledge, Arkansas Attorney \nGeneral; Amy Embry, Executive Director of the Arkansas State Medical Board; and fourteen \n3 The United States does not concede the accuracy of this definition. The binary of\"male\" or \"female\" (here \"the \nbiological indication of male and female\") does not account for full scientific understanding of biological sex. And \nscientific literature suggests that the concept of\"biological sex\" is more complicated than \"biological indication[s]\" \nof\"reproductive potential or capacity.\" For example, there is significant evidence of variations in brain development \nand brain anatomy that are not accounted for in defendant's definition. See generally, e.g., Sarah S. Richardson, SEX \nITSELF: THE SEARCH FOR MALE& FEMALE IN THE HUMAN GENOME (2013); lvanka Savic & Stefan Arver, Sex \nDimorphism oft he Brain in Male-to-Female Transsexuals, 21 CEREBRAL CORTEX 2525 (2011); Bonnie Auyeung, et \nal., Fetal Testosterone Predicts Sexually Differentiated Childhood Behavior in Girls and in Boys, 20 PSYCHOL.

See Anne Fausto-Sterling, THE FIVE SEXES, REVISITED, Sers., July-Aug. 2000, at 18, 20. \"Intersex\" is \nan umbrella term for the many possible differences in sex traits or reproductive anatomy compared to the usual two \nways that human bodies develop. These can include differences in genitalia, hormones, internal anatomy, brain \nanatomy, brain development, or chromosomes. Because there are multiple factors that influence sex, those factors \nmay provide different outcomes for different people. \n4 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 5 of 28\nmembers of the Arkansas State Medical Board, all in their official capacities. Compl. For \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief 1, ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs include transgender minors and their \nfamilies, as well as two medical doctors who bring their claims in their individual capacities on \nbehalf of themselves and their patients. Id. at 1, 4-8. The complaint seeks declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, alleging the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment (minor and doctor plaintiffs), the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \n(parent plaintiffs), and the First Amendment (all plaintiffs). Id. at 46. Plaintiffs filed a motion for \npreliminary injunction and a memorandum in support of that motion on June 15, 2021. \nARGUMENT \nIn determining whether to grant a motion for a preliminary injunction, the court reviews: \n\"( 1) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (2) the state of the balance between this harm \nand the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other parties litigant; (3) the probability \nthat movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest.\" Home Instead, Inc. v. \nFlorance, 721 F.3d 494,497 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. CL Sys., Inc., 640 \nF.2d 109, 113 (8th Cir. 1981) (en bane)). In this Statement oflnterest, the United States argues \nthat the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits on their Equal Protection claim. This \nStatement does not address the other preliminary injunction factors, or plaintiffs' claims under \nthe Due Process Clause or the First Amendment. ! \nA state law that specifically denies a limited class of people the ability to receive \nmedically necessary care from their healthcare providers solely on the basis of their sex assigned \nat birth violates the Equal Protection Clause. And yet, this is exactly what Arkansas's Act 626 \nwould do. Act 626 makes physicians and other healthcare professionals liable legally and for \n5 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 6 of 28\nprofessional misconduct if they provide or refer a transgender minor for gender-affirming care -\ni.e., procedures that affirm the gender with which one identifies. For transgender individuals, \ngender-affirming care includes procedures that support the process by which a person transitions \nfrom living as a gender that corresponds to their sex assigned at birth to living as a different \ngender. Act 626 limits only transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming care as \nprescribed by a healthcare provider, and no one else. Indeed, cisgender minors are able to receive \ngender-affirming care that involves the exact same treatment denied to transgender minors, \nsimply because for one minor the care affirms their \"biological sex\" as defined in Act 626 and \nfor the other it does not. These restrictions explicitly target transgender people. \nThat the law references treatments for \"gender transition\" instead of explicitly \nreferencing \"transgender minors\" is of no legal consequence: by li~iting the treatments available \nbased on adherence to the law's definition of \"biological sex,\" transgender minors are the only \ngroup denied care because of their \"biological sex\" as it relates to their gender identity. See Bray \nv. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993) (\"Some activities may be such \nan irrational object of disfavor that, if they are targeted, and if they also happen to be engaged in \nexclusively or predominantly by a particular class of people, an intent to disfavor that class can \nreadily be presumed.\"); see also Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Ga., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1742 (2020) \n(when an employer discriminates against an employee based on the employee's sexual \norientation or gender identity, the employer \"inescapably intends to rely on sex in its \ndecisionmaking\") ( emphasis added). \nAs discussed below, Act 626 discriminates against transgender people and violates the \nEqual Protection Clause under the requisite heightened scrutiny analysis. Discriminatory \ntreatment against transgender people should be evaluated under a heightened scrutiny analysis, \n6 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 7 of 28\nas it constitutes both sex discrimination and discrimination against transgender people as an \nindependently protected class. Under this analysis, Act 626 fails. Arkansas cannot demonstrate \nthat prohibiting certain medically necessary healthcare only for transgender people is \nsubstantially related to achieving a legitimate government interest. \nI.  Act 626 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. \nThe threshold inquiry in evaluating any Equal Protection claim is whether the \nclassification at issue warrants heightened review because it jeopardizes a fundamental right or \ncategorizes on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic. Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, \n10 (1992) (c itations omitted). As discussed below, Act 626 is subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause it discriminates based on sex and transgender status. \nA.  Act 626 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause \nbecause it discriminates on the basis of sex. \nProhibiting medically necessary care in the manner proscribed by Act 626 amounts to \nintentional discrimination against transgender minors on the basis of sex. \nRecently, the Supreme Court has explained that one cannot \"discriminate against a \nperson for being ... transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.\" \nBostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741. The Supreme Court has long held that the Equal Protection Clause \nprevents states from discriminating against individuals on the basis of sex, absent \"an \nexceedingly persuasive\" justification. See United States v.  Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-33 (1996) \n(\"VMI\"). Three courts of appeals - the Fourth, the Seventh, and the Eleventh Circuits-have \nheld that classifications based on gender identity or transgender status warrant heightened \nscrutiny as a constitutional matter because they are classifications \"on the basis of sex.\" See \nGrimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 610-13 (4th Cir. 2020), as amended (Aug. \n28, 2020), reh'gen bane denied, 976 F.3d 399 (4th Cir. 2020),petitionfor cert.filed, No. 20-\n7 \n4:2 l -cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 8 of 28\n1163 (Feb. 19, 2021 ); Adams ex. rel. Kasper v. Sch. Bd. ofS t. Johns Cnty., 968 F .3d 1286, 1296 \n(11th Cir. 2020) (\"discrimination against a trans gender individual because of [his or] her gender \nnonconformity is sex discrimination, whether it's described as being on the basis of sex or \ngender.\") (quoting Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir. 2011)),petitionfor reh 'gen \nbane pending, No. 18-13592 (11th Cir. Aug. 28, 2020); Whitaker By Whitaker ex rel. v. Kenosha \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. ofE  duc., 858 F .3d 1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017). \nAct 626 on its face discriminates on the basis of sex. Under the Act, transgender minors \nare singled out for different treatment based on the law's definition of sex, which is limited to \nwhat the State terms \"biological sex.\" This classification alone, which \"draw[s] distinctions \nusing sex or gender ... for differential treatment\" triggers heightened scrutiny. See Adams, 968 \nF.3d at 1295 (citing Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440). The Act uses the sex a person is assigned at \nbirth to prohibit certain medical procedures. This is, by definition, sex discrimination.  See \nBostock, 140 S Ct. at 1741 (explaining that \"if changing the employee's sex would have yielded \na different choice by the employer ... a statutory violation has occurred\"). \nAct 626 forbids providing certain forms of care to minors based on sex alone when it \npermits a minor who was assigned the female sex at birth and identifies as female to receive care \nthat would be denied to a minor who was assigned the male sex at birth but identifies as female \n(that is, who is transgender). A minor may not directly receive or be referred for care that \nincludes any \"gender transition procedure,\" that would \"alter or remove physical characteristics \nor features\" associated with the individual's \"biological sex,\" as defined by the law, or those that \n\"seek to ... instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex \ndifferent from the individual's biological sex.\" Act 626 § 3 (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-\n9-1501(6)(A)). This restriction applies only to minors who have a gender identity different than \n8 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 9 of 28\ntheir sex assigned at birth, i.e., transgender minors. However, minors can receive those same \nmedical treatments if the treatments do not \"alter ... characteristics or features\" associated with \ntheir \"biological sex\" as defined by the law. Id. For example, a minor whose assigned sex at birth \nwas male can receive puberty-blocking medication to treat precocious puberty so that the minor \ncan live as a boy, rather than prematurely experiencing sexual development. But a minor whose \nassigned sex at birth was female cannot receive puberty-blocking medication so that the minor \ncan live as a boy, rather than developing the secondary sex characteristics of a woman. This \ndifference in outcome is based solely on a difference in their sex assigned at birth. \nWhen Arkansas differentiates in this way, it necessarily classifies these minors on the \nbasis of sex. See Flack v. Wis. Dep 't ofH  ealth Servs., 328 F. Supp. 3d 931, 948 (W.D. Wis. \n2018) (holding that insurer's denial of coverage for medically necessary care based on plaintiffs' \nsex assigned at birth was a \"straightforward case of sex discrimination\"); see also Bostock, 140 \nS. Ct. at 1746 (\"By discriminating against transgender persons, the employer unavoidably \ndiscriminates against persons with one sex identified at birth and another today.\"); Whitaker, 858 \nF.3d at I 051 (school district's policy requiring students to use bathroom in accordance with the \nsex on the student's birth certificate \"cannot be stated without referencing sex\" and, therefore, \"is \ninherently based upon a sex-classification and heightened review applies\"). \nThe State also discriminates against transgender minors for failing to conform to the sex \nand gender-based stereotypes associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. As the \nEleventh Circuit has explained, \"discrimination against a transgender individual because of her \ngender-nonconformity is sex discrimination, whether it's described as being on the basis of sex \nor gender.\" Glenn, 663 F.3d at 1317. The law permits gender-affirming care when such care \n9 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 10 of 28\nreinforces the gender-based stereotypes associated with the individual's sex assigned at birth, but \nprohibits it when the gender-affirming care does not reinforce those gender-based stereotypes. \nFor example, the law would permit a minor whose sex assigned at birth was female to \nundergo a voluntary cosmetic breast augmentation procedure, but not allow a minor whose sex \nassigned at birth was male to undergo the same procedure - even when recommended as \nmedically appropriate by a physician - simply because on the first minor, the procedure aligns \nwith stereotypical notions of the minor's sex assigned at birth, while on the second minor, the \nsame procedure does not. Similarly, the law would permit a doctor to prescribe testosterone to a \nminor whose sex assigned at birth was male for male hypogonadism, where the body produces \ninsufficient testosterone, because that prescription aligns with gender-based stereotypes about \nwhat is considered \"masculine.\" But a doctor would face professional reprimand and legal action \nfor prescribing medically necessary testosterone to a minor whose sex assigned at birth was \nfemale because that prescription would undermine the gender-based stereotypes associated with \nhis sex assigned at birth (o  r \"femininity\"). By deciding who receives medically prescribed care \nbased on the State's definition of \"biological sex,\" Arkansas's lawmakers are supplanting the \nmedical judgment and expertise of the minors' treating healthcare providers with stereotypical \nbeliefs about appropriate gender expression. \nRelatedly, Act 626's carve-out for intersex5 minors further confirms the law's reliance on \ngender-based stereotypes related to a minor's sex assigned at birth, and in fact undermines the \nlaw's underinclusive definition of \"biological sex.\" Specifically, the law excludes from its \nprohibition any \"services\" to intersex minors, presumably when those procedures are intended to \nconform the minor's physical appearance to stereotypical expectations associated with the sex \n5 See supra n.4. \n10 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 11 of 28\nthe minor was assigned at birth. Act 626 § 3 (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-1502( c )). \nThere is no explanation or justification why these \"services,\" explicitly deemed \"not gender \ntransition procedures,\" are permissible when considered to be medically necessary for intersex \nminors, but grounds for professional misconduct and civil litigation when provided to \ntransgender minors. See id. Allowing these procedures for an intersex minor, but disallowing the \nsame procedures prescribed by a medical professional to affirm a trans gender minor's gender \nidentity, constitutes a distinction based on impermissible gender and sex-based stereotypes. \nB.  Act 626 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause \nbecause it discriminates on the basis of transgender status. \nProhibiting medically necessary care in the manner proscribed by Act 626 also \ndiscriminates against trans gender minors on the basis of trans gender status. \nThe text of Act 626 explicitly classifies transgender people for different treatment. The \nlaw's legislative findings make clear that the law specifically addresses \"children who are \ngender-nonconforming\" and who \"experience distress at identifying with their biological sex.\" \nId. § 2(3). It prohibits any healthcare professional from \"provid[ing] gender transition \nprocedures,\" or making a referral for the same, to any individual under eighteen years of age. \nId.§ 3 (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-1502(a), (b)). These \"procedures\" are defined as \nmedical or surgical services that support a \"gender transition,\" defined by the act as \"the process \nin which a person goes from identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to his or her \nbiological sex to identifying with and living as a gender different from his or her biological sex.\" \nId. (to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-1501(5)). By definition, a transgender person is \nsomeone whose gender identity is inconsistent with their sex assigned at birth, and thus \ntransgender people are the only class of people who would seek \"gender transition\" services. Act \nI I \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 12 of 28\n626 requires that transgender minors, as a group, be treated differently from cisgender minors -\nand imposes significant penalties for violations of its provisions. \nFor example, similar to the example provided prior, supra Section I.A., if a medical \ndoctor determines that two young people with the same sex assigned at birth should each be \nprescribed the same puberty-blocking medication, the doctor is permitted to prescribe such \nmedication to the cisgender minor to suppress precocious puberty, but faces professional \nreprimand and legal liability for prescribing the exact same medication to a transgender minor \neven when the medication is necessary as a gender-affirming treatment. \nThe Supreme Court has analyzed four factors to determine whether a classification \nwarrants heightened scrutiny: (1) whether the class has historically been subjected to \ndiscrimination, see Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has a \ndefining characteristic that \"frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to \nsociety,\" Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440-41 (quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677,686 \n(1973) (plurality opinion)); (3) whether the class has \"obvious, immutable, or distinguishing \ncharacteristics that define them as a discrete group,\" Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and (4) whether the \nclass is a minority lacking political power, Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987). \nAfter evaluating the four factors as they relate to transgender people, both the Fourth and Ninth \nCircuits - the only circuits to have addressed this question to date - recognized transgender \npeople as a quasi-suspect class under the Equal Protection Clause. See Grimm, 972 F .3d at 611 \n(finding \"[e]ach factor readily satisfied\" with regards to transgender people); Karnoski v. Trump, \n926 F.3d 1180, 1200 (9th Cir. 2019) (upholding the district court's application of strict scrutiny \nafter applying the factors to determine transgender people are a quasi-suspect class); but cf \nBrown v. Zavaras, 63 F.3d 967,971 (10th Cir. 1995) (recognizing that \"sexual identity\" may be \n12 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 13 of 28\nimmutable but unable to evaluate the factors because of pro se plaintiffs conclusory allegations \nand following the since overruled holding in Holloway v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 566 F.2d 659 \n(9th Cir. 1977), that transgender plaintiff not entitled to heightened scrutiny). Several district \ncourts have concluded the same. See, e.g., F. V.  v. Barron, 286 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1145 (D. Idaho \n2018), decision clarified sub nom. F. V. v. Jeppesen, 466 F. Supp. 3d 1110 (D. Idaho 2020), and \ndecision clarified sub nom. F. V. v. Jeppesen, 477 F. Supp. 3d 1144 (D. Idaho 2020); Flack, 328 \nF. Supp. 3d at 951-53; MA.B. v. Ed. ofE  duc. of Talbot Cnty., 286 F. Supp. 3d 704, 719-21 (D. \nMd. 2018); Evancho v. Pine-Richland Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 3d 267,288 (W.D. Pa. 2017); Bd. \nofE  duc. oft he Highland Loe. Sch. Dist. v. United States Dep 't ofE  duc., 208 F. Supp. 3d 850, \n873-74 (S.D. Ohio 2016); Adkins v. City ofN  ew York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 139-140 (S.D.N.Y. \n2015); Norsworthy v. Beard, 87 F. Supp. 3d I 104, 1119 (N.D. Cal. 2015). Although no Court \nwithin the Eighth Circuit has yet examined this question, each of the four factors supports a \nfinding that trans gender status warrants heightened scrutiny. \n1.  The class has been subjected to historical discrimination. \nEven the most cursory study of the treatment of trans gender individuals in the United \nStates reveals that such individuals, as a class, have historically been subject to discrimination. \nSee Grimm, 972 F.3d at 611-12; Flack, 328 F. Supp. 3d at 952-53; MA.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at \n720; Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 288; Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 874; Adkins, 143 F. Supp. \n3d at 139. As the court in Whitaker observed, \"[t]here is no denying that transgender individuals \nface discrimination, harassment, and violence because of their gender identity.\" 858 F.3d at \n1051. Transgender people experience higher levels of physical and sexual violence, harassment, \nand discrimination in the workplace, housing, healthcare, and school than their non-transgender \ncounterparts. See Karnoski v. Trump, No. C-17-1297-MJP, 2018 WL 1784464 at *10 (W.D. \n13 \n4:2 l-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 14 of 28\nWash. Apr. 13, 2018) (citing Sandy E. James et al., Nat'l Ctr. for Transgender Equal., The \nReport oft he 2015 US. Transgender Survey, 132-34 (Dec. 2016), available at \nhttps://perma.cc/FC9M-4QZJ (hereinafter USTS Report)), vacated on other grounds and \nremanded, 926 F.3d 1180 (9th Cir. 2019). For example, nearly half (47%) ofrespondents to the \n2015 USTS Report disclosed being sexually assaulted in their lifetime. USTS Report at 205. \nRates of sexual assault of transgender people of color is even more pronounced, as this number \nincreases to 65% for American Indian and Alaskan Native respondents, 59% for multiracial \nrespondents, 58% for Middle Eastern respondents, and 53% for Black respondents. Id. In the \nhealthcare setting, nearly one in four (23%) respondents reported delaying healthcare in the past \nyear for fear of being mistreated, and one in three (33%) respondents who had seen a healthcare \nprovider in the previous year reported at least one negative experience because of their real or \nperceived gender identity, including being verbally harassed, physically attacked, or sexually \nassaulted. Id. at 96-98. \nTransgender people are not spared experiences of discrimination, harassment, and \nviolence during childhood and adolescence. Seventy-seven percent (77%) ofrespondents to the \nUSTS Report who had come out as transgender or were perceived as transgender in kindergarten \nthrough twelfth grade (K-12) reported at least one experience of\"being verbally harassed, \nprohibited from dressing according to their gender identity, or physically or sexually assaulted\" \nbecause of their real or perceived gender identity. USTS Report at 131; see also Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 597. Nearly one in four (24%) of these respondents reported being physically attacked in \nK-12 because people thought they were transgender. USTS Report at 132. Experiences of \ndiscrimination among transgender minors are not limited to the education setting, as a recent \nstudy found 61 % of transgender respondents ages thirteen to twenty-four who were employed \n14 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 15 of 28\nhad experienced discrimination in the workplace. The Trevor Project, Research Brief LGBTQ \nYouth in the Workplace 1 (Mar. 30, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/P73U-HSUB. Further, \nArkansas is not the only state seeking to restrict the rights oftransgender youth. Twenty states \nhave introduced bills limiting the ability of trans gender minors to access gender-affirming \nmedical care; thirty-one states have introduced bills restricting the ability of transgender student \nathletes to compete on sports teams in accordance with their gender identity. See Priya \nKrishnakumar, This Record-Breaking Year for Anti-Transgender Legislation Would Affect \nMinors the Most, CNN (Apr. 15, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/AN6W-DF6F. \n2.  The class's defining characteristic has no relation to ability to contribute to society. \nThe second factor in assessing whether a classification warrants heightened scrutiny is \nwhether the class has a defining characteristic that \"bears [a] relation to ability to perform or \ncontribute to society.\" Cleburne, 473 U.S. at440-41 (internal quotation omitted). Transgender \nstatus bears no such relation. As the court in Adkins noted, there is no \"data or argument \nsuggesting that a transgender person, simply by virtue oftransgender status, is any less \nproductive than any other member of society.\" 143 F. Supp. 3d at 139. Accord Grimm, 972 F.3d \nat 612; MA.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 720; Evancho, 237 F. Supp. 3d at 288; Highland, 208 F. Supp. \n3d at 874; Norsworthy, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 1119 n.8. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) \nhas stated that \"[b] eing transgender or gender diverse implies no impairment in judgment, \nstability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities.\" APA Assembly and Board of \nTrustees, Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Diverse \nIndividuals (2012, 2018). Indeed, the court in MA.B. was unaware of any \"argument suggesting \nthat a transgender person or person experiencing gender dysphoria is any less productive than \nany other member of society.\" 286 F. Supp. 3d at 720. !fo the contrary, any impairment is likely \n15 \n4:2 l-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 16 of 28\n\"the product of a long history of persecution forcing transgender people to live as those who they \nare not.\" Adkins, 143 F. Supp. 3d at 139. \n3.  The class shares characteristics that define them as a discrete group. \nThe third factor to consider is whether the class in question shares \"obvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a discrete group.\" Bowen, 483 U.S. at 602 \n(quoting Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638). Multiple courts have held that transgender status is immutable, \nand \"being transgender is not a choice[,] [r]ather, it is as natural and immutable as being \ncisgender.\" Grimm, 972 F.3d at 612-13; see also, MA.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 720 (\"transgender \nstatus is immutable\"); Evancho, 23 7 F. Supp. 3d at 288 (plaintiffs' \"transgender characteristics \nare inherent in who they are as people\"); Norsworthy, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 1119 n.8 (finding \ntransgender identity \"equally immutable\" as sexual orientation). Further, transgender people \nshare a distinguishing characteristic - that their sex assigned at birth does not align with their \ngender identity. MA.B., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 721; see also Highland, 208 F. Supp. 3d at 874 \n(\"transgender people have 'immutable [a nd] distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,' or as the Second Circuit put it in Windsor, 'the characteristic of the class calls \ndown discrimination when it is manifest\"') (quoting Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; Windsor v.  United \nStates, 699 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal citations omitted), afj'd, 570 U.S. 744 (2013)); \nAdkins, 143 F. Supp. 3d at 139-140 (\"mismatch between the gender indicated on the document \nand the gender of the holder calls down discrimination, among other problems\"). \n4.  The class is a minority lacking political power. \nThe final consideration is whether transgender people are a minority or lack political \npower. Bowen, 483 U.S. at 602 (quoting Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638). Transgender people meet both \nthese criteria. See Grimm, 972 F .3d at 613 (\"trans gender people constitute a minority lacking \n16 \n4:2 l-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 17 of 28\npolitical power\"). There is no question that transgender people comprise a small percentage of \nthe United States population, with recent estimates that transgender individuals make up at 0.6% \nof the U.S. adult population. Id. This percentage is the same for Arkansas where an estimated \n0.6% (13,400) of the population identify as transgender. Andrew R. Flores et al., How Many \nAdults Identify as Transgender in the United States? UCLA, Williams Inst., June 2016, at 3, \navailable at https://perma.cc/ATR5-DKG5. In addition, while the number of openly transgender \nelected officials is growing, they still represent a fraction of public office holders. Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 613 (\"Even considering the low percentage of the population that is transgender, \ntransgender persons are underrepresented in every branch of government.\"). There are over \n500,000 elected positions at the federal, state, and local level. Jennifer Lawless, Becoming a \nCandidate: Political Ambition and the Decision to Run for Office 2 (2012). Openly transgender \npeople hold thirty-nine (<0.008%) of these offices. Victory Institute, Out for America, available \nat https://perma.cc/E5H3-FJP6 (last visited June 16, 2021). Across the country, states are \nintroducing and passing legislation aimed at restricting the rights of transgender individuals, \nparticularly transgender minors. See discussion supra Part LB. I. The limited political power and \nthe resulting political vulnerability of the transgender community is undeniable. \nUpon consideration of these factors, the court should conclude that transgender people \nare a quasi-suspect class entitled to heightened scrutiny. \nII. Act 626 cannot survive heightened scrutiny because it is not substantially related to \nachieving Arkansas's articulated governmental interests. \nAct 626 cannot survive heightened scrutiny. To survive a heightened scrutiny analysis, \nthe government actor must show that the action in question \"serves important governmental \nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the \nachievement of those objectives.\" See VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (quoting Miss. Univ.for Women v. \n17 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 18 of 28\nHogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"The burden of \njustification is demanding and it rests entirely on the State.\" VMI, 518 at 533 (citing Miss. Univ. \nfor Women, 458 U.S. at 724). Heightened scrutiny requires that the justification proffered be \n\"exceedingly persuasive.\" Id. at 531. The required inquiry provides an enhanced measure of \nprotection in circumstances where there is a greater danger that the legal classification results \nfrom impermissible prejudice or stereotypes, see, e.g., City ofR  ichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 \nU.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion), or those that reflect \"a bare ... desire to harm a \npolitically unpopular group,\" United States Dep 't ofA gric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973). \nAct 626 cannot survive the rigorous analysis that heightened scrutiny demands. \nArkansas proffers the protection of the \"health and safety of its citizens, especially \nvulnerable children\" as its important governmental interest. Act 626 § 2(1 ). This justification is \nmere pretext for animus against transgender minors. When evaluating an articulated \ngovernmental interest, the 'justification must be genuine, not hypothesized,\" and \"must not rely \non overbroad generalizations.\" VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see also Grimm, 972 F.3d at 615 (holding \nthat policy restricting access to restroom by \"biological sex\" is \"marked by misconception and \nprejudice\" against transgender plaintiff) (citation omitted); Adams, 968 F.3d at 1297 (holding \nthat no substantial relationship existed between defendants' articulated justification and its policy \nbecause the concerns articulated by defendants were merely hypothesized, and because the \npolicy treated transgender plaintiff differently \"simply because he defies gender stereotypes\"); \nys, \nSmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Lab  740 F.3d 471,483 (9th Cir. 2014) (noting that the \ncourt must examine the law's \"actual purposes and carefully consider the resulting inequality to \nensure that our most fundamental institutions neither send nor reinforce messages of stigma or \nsecond-class status.\") (citing Windsor, 570 U.S. 744)). A classification does not withstand \n18 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 19 of 28\nheightened  scrutiny when \"the alleged objective\" of the classification differs from the \"actual \npurpose.\" Miss. Univ.for Women, 458 U.S. at 730. \nThe State argues that this law is necessary to protect vulnerable children because the \n\"risks of gender transition procedures far outweigh any benefit at this stage of clinical study.\" \nAct 626 § 2(15). This contention is both pretextual and factually incorrect, contradicted by the \ntext of the law itself, by the lawmakers' statements, by the medical consensus around such care, \nand by the demonstrated negative impacts of denying gender-affirming, medically necessary care \nto vulnerable transgender minors. \nFirst, this stated justification is pretextual. If the State's purported health-driven concerns \nregarding the medical risks of the procedures undertaken as part of gender-affirming care were \ngenuine, the State would prohibit these procedures for all minors, whether they are transgender, \ncisgender, or intersex. But instead of adopting an across-the-board standard, the State has \nprohibited those treatments only when provided to a specific class of people - transgender \nminors. As discussed in the example above, testosterone may be prescribed to a cisgender boy \nfor male hypogonadism, even though studies indicate that such treatment could also have a \nnegative effect on fertility, yet a transgender boy may not be prescribed the same. See Jordan \nCohen et al., Low Testosterone in Adolescents & Young Adults, IO Frontiers in Endocrinology, \nJan. 10, 2020, available at https://perma.cc/J7D D-AR3R. This singling out of trans gender \nminors reveals that the purported neutral health-related justification is pretextual. See Church of \nthe Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City ofH  ialeah, 508 U.S. 520,547 (1993) (observing that a state \nundermines its stated interest \"when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital \ninterest unprohibited\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n19 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 20 of 28\nFurther, legislative hearings on H.B. 1570 (now Act 626) demonstrate the legislature's \nbias. Across multiple days, the Arkansas House and Senate heard testimony from opponents of \nthe bill - limited to two minutes per witness - ranging from medical professionals to transgender \npeople themselves, discussing the detailed treatment protocols in place for transgender minors as \nwell as the life-threatening effects of making gender-affirming care inaccessible. See, e.g., \nHearing on HB. 1570 Before the H  Pub. Health, Welfare, & Lab.

The two-minute time restriction \nreportedly resulted in multiple people with first-hand experience on the topic being cut-off mid \ntestimony. Yet, according to reports, such restrictions did not appear to apply to those witnesses \npresenting in favor of the bill. See, e.g., Mar. 22 Hearing at 4:15:03 (Chair Sen. Cecile Bledsoe \ninforming a witness speaking in favor of the bill that the two-minute restriction did not apply to \nhim and that she would \"love for [him] to go on.\"); Katie Eyer, Why the Arkansas Ban on \nMedical Care for Transgender Kids Is Unconstitutional, The Regulatory Review, May 4, 2021, \navailable at https://perma.cc/UL94-ZW7V. \n20 \n4:21-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 21 of 28\nStatements of H.B. 1570 (now Act 626) co-sponsors also reveal that the true motivation \ndriving this law is anti-transgender bias. For example, Representative Jim Wooten, when \naddressing concerns oftransgender people, stated \"what if your child comes to you and says I \nwant to be a cow?\" Andrew DeMillo, Arkansas Lawmakers OK Transgender Sports, Treatment \nLimits, Associated Press (Mar. 10, 2021 ), available at https://perma.cc/5CD8-MTWV. \nRepresentative Marcus Richmond has shared anti-transgender social media posts. See \n\"Richmond 4 State Rep District 21,\" Is that lunch he is holding?, Facebook (Jan. 31, 2021 ), \nhttps://perma.cc/9FAX-WL6R (reposting image and comment regarding Dr. Rachel Levine, the \ncurrent Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \nand a transgender woman, in which Dr. Levine is referred to by her previous name and male \npronouns); Facebook (March 2, 2021), https://perma.cc/9O67-BELW (reposting cartoon \ndenigrating gender-affirming care for minors, originally posted by Representative Alan Clark). \nThe biases and moral disapproval articulated by the law and its sponsors are not justifiable \nreasons to legislate.6 See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 577-78 (2003) (holding moral \ndisapproval of same-sex sexual conduct and identity was impermissible basis for legislation); see \nalso Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433 (1984) (noting in the race context that \"[t]he \nConstitution cannot control such prejudices but neither can it tolerate them. Private biases may \nbe outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.\"). \nSecond, this justification lacks a scientific or other factual basis. Gender-affirming \ntreatment is supported by medical evidence that has been subject to rigorous study. Indeed, every \nmajor expert medical association recognizes that gender-affirming care for transgender minors, \n6 Intermediate scrutiny is the appropriate level ofreview in this case.

The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (2013),7 has also formally recognized that \ntransgender people may experience gender dysphoria, a medical condition defined by \"a marked \nincongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and their assigned gender\" that is \n\"associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other \nimportant areas of functioning.\" Gender-affirming health services for minors, such as puberty \nblockers and hormone therapies with testosterone or estrogen, can reduce dysphoria and improve \nother markers of well-being, such as quality of life, interpersonal and psychological functioning, \nand self-esteem. See National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, \nUnderstanding the Well-Being ofL GBTQI+ Populations 363-64 (2020), available at \nhttps://perma.cc/77TP-L6DU. Additionally, studies show that suppressing development of \nsecondary sex characteristics reduces the need for future surgery by preventing physical changes \nthat are otherwise irreversible and allowing youth more time to explore their gender identity.

In short, the medical community is in overwhelming accord that \ngender-affirming care is clinically indicated. \nFurther, rather than being experimental, the care prohibited by Act 626 has been \nrecognized as part of the standards of care by major medical associations. For example, the \nAmerican Medical Association (AMA) recognizes that \"standards of care and accepted \nmedically necessary services that affirm gender or treat gender dysphoria may include mental \nhealth counseling, non-medical social transition, gender-affirming hormone therapy, and/or \ngender-affirming surgeries,\" and that \"[e]very major medical association in the United States \nrecognizes the medical necessity of transition-related care for improving the physical and mental \nhealth oftransgender people.\" Letter from J.

Act 626 § 3 (to be codified \nat Ark. Code Ann. 20-9-1501 (6)(A)(ii)). In reality, those treatments are very rarely prescribed for \ntransgender minors.

For \nexample, the Endocrine Society sets specific, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for \ngender dysphoric/gender-incongruent people, including specific recommendations for treatment \nof adolescents. Generally recommended treatment begins with hormone-suppression when a \nminor starts puberty. And the addition of gender-affirming hormones is only recommended \n\"after a multidisciplinary team has confirmed the persistence of gender dysphoria/gender \nincongruence and [the transgender individual has] sufficient mental capacity to give informed \nconsent\" (which is estimated to be present by age 16). See Endocrine Treatment ofG  ender \nDysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, 102 \nJ. of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, 3869 (2017), as amended. Additionally, the current \ntreatment guidelines, as found in the Standards of Care issued by the World Professional \nAssociation for Transgender Health (WPAT  H),9 recommend against gender-affirming genital \nsurgery until someone has reached the legal age of majority to give consent for medical \nprocedures. See World Pro. Ass'n for Transgender Health, Standards ofC  are for the Health of \nTranssexual, Transgender, and Gender-Conforming People, 7th ed. (2012). Indeed, Arkansas' \nofficials' own words undermine the \"grave concern\" apparently prompting this law, instead \nshowing Act 626 is a \"solution\" in search of a problem. Representative Robin Lundstrum, \noriginator of the law, admitted she in fact does not know of a single genital reassignment surgery \nhaving been performed on a minor in the State.

(\"In Arkansas, gender \nreassignment surgery is not performed on anyone under 18.\"). \nRather than rely on the judgment of medical professionals and evidence-based treatment \nguidelines, Arkansas has inserted itself within one of the most confidential and personal of \nrelationships: the physician-patient relationship. The AMA calls state laws such as this one \"a \ndangerous governmental intrusion into the practice of medicine.\" AMA Letter. In his statement \nvetoing the bill, Governor Hutchinson stated that should H.B. 1570 become law, it would create \n\"new standards of legislative interference with physicians and parents ... put[ting] the state as \nthe definitive oracle of medical care, overriding parents, patients, and healthcare experts.\" \nHutchinson Press Conf. Indeed, multiple healthcare professionals testified against H.B. 1570 \nwhen it was under consideration, highlighting the existing treatment guidelines and the potential \nof increased suicide rates among transgender minors should they be denied access to medically \nnecessary care as a result of the bill's passage.

See Tristan Hill, Arkansas Pediatricians Rally Against HB 1570, KNWA FOX 24 (Apr. 3, \n2021), available at https://perma.cc/3P9L-RDPY.

The law, which prohibits \nwidely-accepted treatment protocols, would deny transgender minors medically necessary care \nsolely based on their sex assigned at birth and their transgender status. If the State truly intended \nto protect \"vulnerable\" minors, it would not insert itself into the physician-patient relationship \nfor purposes of depriving these minors' necessary and appropriate treatment. \nCONCLUSION \nFederal law bars the State of Arkansas from singling out transgender minors for \nspecifically and discriminatorily denying their access to medically necessary care based solely on \ntheir sex assigned at birth. Such action would violate the Equal Protection Clause. By denying \nonly trans gender minors' access to medically necessary care, and penalizing the healthcare \nproviders who would provide it, the State does not further its purported goal of protecting the \n\"health and safety\" of Arkansan minors but rather thwarts it by denying the most vulnerable \namong them life-saving care. \n26 \n4:2 l-cv-450-JM \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 19   Filed 06/17/21   Page 27 of 28\nRespectfully submitted, this Seventeenth day of June, 2021. \nKRISTEN CLARKE \nAssistant Attorney General \nCivil Rights Division \nPAMELA S.

Code Ann. §§ 20-9-1501 to 20-9-1504 and \n23-79-164 (“Act 626”). Act 626 prohibits a physician or other healthcare provider from \nproviding or referring any individual under the age of 18 for “gender transition procedures.”  \n“Gender transition procedures” means the process in which a person goes from \nidentifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to his or her biological sex to \nidentifying with and living as a gender different from his or her biological sex, and may \ninvolve social, legal, or physical changes; \n \n(6)(A) “Gender transition procedures” means any medical or surgical service, including \nwithout limitation physician's services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, or \nprescribed drugs related to gender transition that seeks to: \n \n(i)  Alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features that are typical \nfor the individual's biological sex; or \n \n(ii)   Instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex \ndifferent from the individual's biological sex, including without limitation medical \nservices that provide puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other \nmechanisms to promote the development of feminizing or masculinizing features \nin the opposite biological sex, or genital or nongenital gender reassignment \nsurgery performed for the purpose of assisting an individual with a gender \ntransition. \n \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 2 of 13\n \nAR LEGIS 626 (2021), 2021 Arkansas Laws Act 626 (H.B. 1570). The Defendants asserts that \nArkansas has a compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, \nparticularly “vulnerable” children who are gender nonconforming or who experience distress at \nidentifying with their biological sex. Id. \nPlaintiffs are minors, Dylan Brandt, Sabrina Jennen, Brooke Dennis, Parker Saxton (the \n“Patient Plaintiffs”), their parents, Joanna Brandt, Lacey and Aaron Jennen, Amanda and Shayne \nDennis, Donnie Saxton (the “Parent Plaintiffs”) and their healthcare providers, Dr. Michele \nHutchison, and Dr. Kathryn Stambough (the “Physician Plaintiffs”). Plaintiffs have filed suit \nclaiming the Act violates the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, and the First \nAmendment. They seek a preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants and their successors in \noffice from enforcing Act 626 during the pendency of this litigation. Plaintiffs contend that Act \n626 categorically prohibits transgender adolescents with gender dysphoria from treatment, that \nthe patient, their parents, and their medical providers agree, is medically necessary and in the \nadolescent’s best interest. They allege that the Act singles out individuals in need of medically \nnecessary gender-affirming care solely because the individual’s gender identity does not conform \nto their assigned sex at birth.  \nI.  Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss \n  As stated on the record, the Court finds that the Patient and Parent Plaintiffs have \nstanding under the Equal Protection Clause to challenge Act 626’s prohibition of “gender \ntransition procedures” as that term is defined in Ark. Code Ann. §§ 20-9-1501(6). They also have \nstanding to challenge the Act’s authorization of private rights of action. “Where an \nunconstitutional statute provides for enforcement both through official acts and private suits, \nPlaintiffs with standing to seek an injunction against the official acts may also challenge the \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 3 of 13\n \nconstitutionality of private suits.” See Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, \n887-88 (1992). \n  The Court finds that Physician Plaintiffs have standing in their own right to challenge the \nAct’s unequal treatment between healthcare providers who provide gender-affirming care to \ntransgender patients, which would be prohibited by Act 626, and other healthcare providers, who \nprovide all other medically accepted care, including gender-affirming care to non-transgender \npatients, which is not prohibited. See Am. Coll. of Obstetricians & Gynecologists v. U.S. Food & \nDrug Admin., 472 F. Supp. 3d 183, 206 (D. Md. 2020).  \nThe Court finds that Physician Plaintiffs have third-party standing to challenge Act 626 \non behalf of their patients based upon the Supreme Court’s opinion in June Med. Serv’s. LLC v. \nRusso, 140 S. Ct. 2103, 2118-2119 (2020) (“[W]e have generally permitted plaintiffs to assert \nthird-party rights in cases where the ‘enforcement of the challenged restriction against the \nlitigant would result indirectly in the violation of third parties’ rights.’”) (quoting Kowalski v. \nTesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 130 (2004)). Further, Physician Plaintiffs have alleged a close relationship \nwith their patients and a hindrance to their patients’ ability to protect their interests because of \nthe risk of discrimination and their patients’ desire to protect their privacy. See Singleton v. \nWulff, 428 U.S. 106, 117 (1976) (patient may be “chilled” from asserting their rights “by a desire \nto protect the very privacy of [their] decision from the publicity of a court suit.”). \nII.  Preliminary Injunction \n“The primary function of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo until, upon \nfinal hearing, a court may grant full, effective relief.” Ferry-Morse Seed Co. v. Food Corn, Inc., \n729 F.2d 589, 593 (8th Cir. 1984). The Court considers four factors in evaluating Plaintiffs' \nrequest for a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the likelihood \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 4 of 13\n \nof irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction; (3) the balance of equities; and (4) the public \ninterest. Sanborn Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Campbell Hausfeld/Scott Fetzer Co., 997 F.2d 484, 485-86 \n(8th Cir. 1983). “When the government is a party, these last two factors merge.” Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). \nA.  Equal Protection \nTo analyze Plaintiffs’ facial challenge to Act 626, the Court must determine what level of \nscrutiny applies and whether Act 626 survives that scrutiny. The Court concludes that heightened \nscrutiny applies to Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims because Act 626 rests on sex-based \nclassifications and because “transgender people constitute at least a quasi-suspect class.” Grimm \nv. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 607 (8th Cir. 2020); accord Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741 (2020) (discrimination for being transgender is discrimination “on \nthe basis of sex”). Defendants argue that Act 626 does not specifically refer to transgender \nindividuals. It does, however, refer to gender transition which is only sought by transgender \nindividuals. See Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993) (“Some \nactivities may be such an irrational object of disfavor that, if they are targeted, and if they also \nhappen to be engaged in exclusively or predominantly by a particular class of people, an intent to \ndisfavor that class can readily be presumed.”). \nUnder heightened scrutiny, Act 626 must be substantially related to a sufficiently \nimportant governmental interest. A policy subject to intermediate scrutiny must be supported by \nan “exceedingly persuasive justification.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (1996). \nThe policy must serve important governmental objectives, and the government must show “that \nthe discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those \nobjectives.” Id. at 533 (citation omitted). \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 5 of 13\n \nDefendants contend that Act 626 is substantially related to the State’s important \ngovernmental objectives of protecting vulnerable children from experimental treatment and \nregulating the ethics of the medical profession.  Defendants contend that there is a lack of \ncredible scientific evidence that gender-transition procedures improve children’s health. They \nalso contend that the consequences of performing these procedures on Arkansas children are too \ngreat to allow physicians and healthcare providers to continue performing them. Defendants state \nthat the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 626 in response to a recent judicial ruling of the \nU.K. High Court of Justice of England and Wales and an Arizona district court. See Bell v. \nTavistock and Portman Nat’l Health Serv. Found. Trust, [2020] EWHC (Admin) 3274; \nHennessy-Waller v. Snyder, 2021 WL 1192842, at *1 (D. Ariz. Mar. 30, 2021).  \nIn Tavistock, the U.K. High Court considered the “narrow” issue of whether “a child or \nyoung person under the age of 16 [can] achieve Gillick 1 competence in respect of the decision to \ntake PBs [puberty blockers] for GD [gender dysphoria]” Id. at ¶133. Although Defendants argue \nthat this case is evidence that the U.K. Court is on the forefront of ethics by banning all gender \ntransitioning procedures, Tavistock does not categorically prohibit individuals from all “gender \ntransition procedures.” The U.K. Court merely concluded that it is “unlikely” that a 13-year-old \nor under would be competent to give Gillick consent to puberty blockers and doubtful that a 14- \nor 15-year-old could give consent. However, a 16-year-old or older is presumed to have the \nability to consent to these procedures. Act 626 prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from \nreceiving treatment without regard to informed consent. \n \n1 Gillick refers to a U.K. High Court case where the House of Lords held by a majority that a doctor could lawfully \ngive contraceptive advice and treatment to a girl aged under 16 if she had sufficient maturity and intelligence to \nunderstand the nature and implications of the proposed treatment and provided that certain conditions were satisfied. \nSee Gillick v. West Norfolk and Wisbech Health Authority [1986] AC 112. \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 6 of 13\n \nThe Arizona district court case, Hennessy-Waller v. Snyder, which is on appeal to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, denied plaintiffs’ motion to enjoin the director of the Arizona \nHealth Care Cost Containment System “from further enforcement of” a regulation that excludes \ngender reassignment surgery from Arizona’s Medicaid coverage and to “order AHCCCS to \ncover male chest reconstruction surgery for D.H. and John.” Hennessy-Waller v. Snyder, 2021 \nWL 1192842, at *1 (D. Ariz. Mar. 30, 2021). The Hennessy-Waller plaintiffs are not prohibited \nfrom all gender-transition treatments and their healthcare providers are not prohibited from \nproviding gender-transition treatments to them. The Court does not find either “authority” to be \npersuasive or precedential.  \nPlaintiffs argue that Act 626 does not protect children. Instead, it bans potentially life-\nsaving treatment to transgender adolescents given in accordance with widely accepted medical \nprotocols for treatment of adolescent gender dysphoria.2 The consensus recommendation of \nmedical organizations is that the only effective treatment for individuals at risk of or suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria is to provide gender-affirming care.3 According to the Medical \nOrganizations, the goal of gender-affirming care is to provide patients who struggle with their \ngender identity the time and support they need to resolve that struggle and to mitigate the distress \n \n2 Wylie C.

In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the \nState’s contention that gender transition treatments cause irreversible and dangerous \nconsequences is belied by the fact that the same medical treatments banned for transgender \nadolescents for “gender transition” by Act 626 are permitted for non-transgender adolescents for \nany other purpose, including to bring their bodies into alignment with their gender.  \n  At this point in the proceedings, the Court finds that Act 626 is not substantially related \nto protecting children in Arkansas from experimental treatment or regulating the ethics of \nArkansas doctors and Defendant’s purported health concerns regarding the risks of gender \ntransition procedures are pretextual. The State’s reliance on the U.K. High Court’s ruling is not \ncredible. If the State’s health concerns were genuine, the State would prohibit these procedures \nfor all patients under 18 regardless of gender identity. The State’s goal in passing Act 626 was \nnot to ban a treatment. It was to ban an outcome that the State deems undesirable. In other words, \nDefendants’ rationale that the Act protects children from experimental treatment and the long-\nterm, irreversible effects of the treatment, is counterintuitive to the fact that it allows the same \ntreatment for cisgender minors as long as the desired results conform with the stereotype of their \nbiological sex. \nThe Court finds the Act’s ban of services and referrals by healthcare providers is not \nsubstantially related to the regulation of the ethics of the medical profession in Arkansas. \nGender-affirming treatment is supported by medical evidence that has been subject to rigorous \nstudy. Every major expert medical association5 recognizes that gender-affirming care for \n \n4 See Brief for Medical Organizations as Amici Curiae, supra note 3, ECF No. 30 at 16-17. \n5 See Brief for Medical Organizations as Amici Curiae, supra note 3. ECF No. 30 at 16. \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 8 of 13\n \ntransgender minors may be medically appropriate and necessary to improve the physical and \nmental health of transgender people. Act 626 prohibits most of these treatments. Further, the \nState’s goal of ensuring the ethics of Arkansas healthcare providers is not attained by interfering \nwith the patient-physician relationship, unnecessarily regulating the evidence-based practice of \nmedicine and subjecting physicians who deliver safe, legal, and medically necessary care to civil \nliability and loss of licensing.6 If the Act is not enjoined, healthcare providers in this State will \nnot be able to consider the recognized standard of care for adolescent gender dysphoria. Instead \nof ensuring that healthcare providers in the State of Arkansas abide by ethical standards, the \nState has ensured that its healthcare providers do not have the ability to abide by their ethical \nstandards which may include medically necessary transition-related care for improving the \nphysical and mental health of their transgender patients. The Court finds that Act 626 cannot \nwithstand heightened scrutiny and based on the record would not even withstand rational basis \nscrutiny if it were the appropriate standard of review. Plaintiffs are, therefore, likely to succeed \non the merits of their Equal Protection claim.  \nNext, the Court finds that Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if Act 626 is not \nenjoined. The Act will cause irreparable physical and psychological harms to the Patient \nPlaintiffs by terminating their access to necessary medical treatment. Plaintiffs who have begun \npuberty blocking hormones will be forced to stop the treatments which will cause them to \nundergo endogenous puberty. Plaintiffs who will soon enter puberty will lose access to puberty \nblockers. In each case, Patient Plaintiffs will have to live with physical characteristics that do not \n \n6 See Statement, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Physicians, American Osteopathic Association, and \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Frontline Physicians Call on Politicians to End Political Interference in the \nDelivery of evidence Based Medicine, (May 15, 2019), https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2019/05/frontline-\nphysicians-call-on-politicians-to-end-political-interference-in-the-delivery-of-evidence-based-medicine. \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 9 of 13\n \nconform to their gender identity, putting them at high risk of gender dysphoria and lifelong \nphysical and emotional pain. Parent Plaintiffs face the irreparable harm of having to watch their \nchildren experience physical and emotional pain or of uprooting their families to move to another \nstate where their children can receive medically necessary treatment. Physician Plaintiffs face the \nirreparable harm of choosing between breaking the law and providing appropriate guidance and \ninterventions for their transgender patients.   \nThe Court finds that the State’s interest in enforcing Act 626 during the pendency of this \nlitigation pales in comparison to the certain and severe harm faced by Plaintiffs. The “State has \nno interest in enforcing laws that are unconstitutional. . ..” Little Rock Fam. Plan. Servs. v. \nRutledge, 397 F. Supp. 3d 1213, 1322 (E.D. Ark. 2019), aff'd in part, appeal dismissed in part \nand remanded, 984 F.3d 682 (8th Cir. 2021). Because Plaintiffs have demonstrated at least at \nthis preliminary stage that they are likely to prevail on the issue of Act 626’s unconstitutionality, \nan injunction preventing the State from enforcing the Act does not irreparably harm the State.  \nB.  Due Process \nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids states to “deprive any \nperson of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \nThe Clause also includes a substantive component that “provides heightened protection against \ngovernment interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.” Washington v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719-20 (1997). “The liberty interest at issue in this case—the interest \nof parents in the care, custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the oldest of the \nfundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 \n(2000); see also Kanuszewski v. Mich. Dep’t of Health and Human Serv’s, 927 F.3d 396, 419 \n(6th Cir. 2019) (“[P]arents’ substantive due process right to make decisions concerning the care, \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 10 of 13\n \ncustody, and control of their children includes the right to direct their children’s medical care.”). \nParents are presumed to be acting in the best interest of their children. Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. \n584, 602 (1979).  \nThe Court finds that the Parent Plaintiffs have a fundamental right to seek medical care \nfor their children and, in conjunction with their adolescent child’s consent and their doctor’s \nrecommendation, make a judgment that medical care is necessary. So long as a parent adequately \ncares for his or her children, “there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into \nthe private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best \ndecisions concerning the rearing of that parent's children.” Troxel, 530 U.S. at 68-69.  \nStrict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review for infringement of a fundamental \nparental right. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 719-20. In applying strict scrutiny, the Court finds that \nDefendants have not met their burden of showing that Arkansas has a compelling state interest in \ninfringing upon parents’ fundamental right to seek medical care for their children, or that Act \n626 is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. As stated, the State has not shown that Act 626 \nserves the stated goal of protecting Arkansas’s children. The goal in this context is pretextual \nbecause Act 626 allows the same treatments for cisgender minors that are banned for transgender \nminors as long as the desired results conform with the stereotype of the minor’s biological sex. \nBased on these findings, the State could not withstand either heightened scrutiny or rational basis \nreview. \nThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown irreparable harm. The State suffers little harm \nfrom maintaining the status quo through the litigation of this case. The risk of irreparable harm to \nthe Plaintiffs tips the balance of equities in favor of a preliminary injunction of Act 626.  \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 11 of 13\n \nC.  First Amendment \nPlaintiffs claim that Act 626 prevents healthcare professionals from speaking, and their \npatients and parents from hearing, about medically accepted treatments for gender dysphoria in \nviolation of their First Amendment rights. Defendants argue that Act 626 is not a regulation of \nspeech but rather a regulation of professional conduct. Further, they argue that the Act does not \nrestrict any right to receive information.  \nThe Court finds that Act 626’s ban on referrals by healthcare providers is a regulation of \nspeech. The Supreme Court has held that “the creation and dissemination of information are \nspeech within the meaning of the First Amendment.” Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, \n570 (2011) (citing Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 527 (2001) (“[I]f the acts of ‘disclosing’ \nand ‘publishing’ information do not constitute speech, it is hard to imagine what does fall within \nthat category, as distinct from the category of expressive conduct”)). “[A] State may not, under \nthe guise of prohibiting professional misconduct, ignore constitutional rights.” Nat'l Ass'n for \nAdvancement of Colored People v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 439 (1963); see also Nat'l Inst. of Fam. \n& Life Advocs. v. Becerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, 2371–72 (2018) (“[T]his Court has not recognized \n‘professional speech’ as a separate category of speech. Speech is not unprotected merely because \nit is uttered by ‘professionals.’”). \nThe Court further finds that Act 626 is a content and viewpoint-based regulation because \nit restricts healthcare professionals only from making referrals for “gender transition \nprocedures,” not for other purposes. As such, it is “presumptively unconstitutional” and is \nsubject to strict scrutiny. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015). To meet the strict \nscrutiny standard, Defendants assert that Arkansas has a compelling interest in protecting \nchildren from experimental gender-transition procedures and safeguarding medical ethics. \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 12 of 13\n \nHowever, the Supreme Court has held that the government does not have a legitimate interest in \nprotecting against the “fear that people [will] make bad decisions if given truthful information.”  \nThompson v. W. States Med. Ctr., 535 U.S. 357, 374 (2002); see also Brown v. Entm’t. Merch. \nAss’n, 564 U.S. 786, 794 (2011) (while states can protect children from harm, that “does not \ninclude a free-floating power to restrict the ideas to which children may be exposed”). In this \ncase, the State believes that a transgender adolescent who, along with their parents and health \ncare providers, decides to receive gender transition treatment is making a bad decision. The State \nbelieves it can keep these individuals from getting this treatment if healthcare providers are not \nallowed to refer their patients to providers in other states who can prescribe the treatment. \nBecause the Court finds that Act 626 cannot survive strict scrutiny or even rational scrutiny, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim.  \nThe Court also finds that Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if Act 626 is not enjoined. \n“It is well-established that “[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of \ntime, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Powell v. Noble, 798 F.3d 690, 702 (8th Cir. \n2015) (Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)). The balance of equities so favors the Plaintiffs \nthat justice requires the Court to preserve the status quo until the merits of the case are \ndetermined. \nIII.  Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss \nAs for the Defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, it is inherent in the \nCourt’s decision to grant the preliminary injunction that the Plaintiffs have stated claims for \nviolations of their Equal Protection, Due Process, and First Amendment rights.  \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 64   Filed 08/02/21   Page 13 of 13\n \nIV.  Conclusion \n  Defendants and successors in office are enjoined from enforcing any provision of House \nBill 1570, Act 626 of the 93rd General Assembly of Arkansas, to be codified at Ark. Code Ann. \n§§ 20-9-1501 to 20-9-1504 and 23-79-164 during the pendency of the litigation of this case. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED this 2nd day of August, 2021. \n \n              _____________________________ \n              James M.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n52(a), the Court makes the following specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. Act \n626 is unconstitutional. The Court determines that Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment in their \nfavor on all claims. The State is permanently enjoined from enforcing Act 626.  \nI.  Procedural History  \n  On April 6, 2021, the Arkansas Legislature passed House Bill 1570, Act 626 of \nthe 93rd General Assembly of Arkansas, codified at Ark. Code Ann. §§ 20-9-1501 to 20-\n9-1504 and 23-79-164 (“Act 626”).2 Act 626 prohibits a physician or other healthcare \nprofessional from providing “gender transition procedures” to any individual under \neighteen years of age and from referring any individual under eighteen years of age to \nany healthcare professional for “gender transition procedures.”   \n“Gender transition procedures” means the process in which a person goes \nfrom identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to his or her \nbiological sex to identifying with and living as a gender different from his \nor her biological sex, and may involve social, legal, or physical changes;   \n \n1 Tim Griffin succeeded Leslie Rutledge as Arkansas Attorney General. \n2 The Arkansas Legislature titled the Act as “Arkansas Save Adolescents from Experimentation (Safe) \nAct.” Because the title is misleading, the Court will refer to the Act as “Act 626” in this order. \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 2 of 80\n \n(6)(A) “Gender transition procedures” means any medical or surgical \nservice, including without limitation physician's services, inpatient and \noutpatient hospital services, or prescribed drugs related to gender \ntransition that seeks to:  \n  \n(i)  Alter or remove physical or anatomical characteristics or features \nthat are typical for the individual's biological sex; or  \n  \n(ii)  Instill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that \nresemble a sex different from the individual's biological sex, \nincluding without limitation medical services that provide puberty-\nblocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other mechanisms to \npromote the development of feminizing or masculinizing features \nin the opposite biological sex, or genital or nongenital gender \nreassignment surgery performed for the purpose of assisting an \nindividual with a gender transition.  \n  \nAR LEGIS 626 (2021), 2021 Arkansas Laws Act 626 (H.B. 1570). The Act creates a \nprivate right of action for an “actual or threatened” violation. The Act does not define a \n“threatened violation.” The statute of limitations for bringing an administrative or judicial \nproceeding under the Act is two years. However, an individual under eighteen years of \nage may bring an action throughout their minority through a parent and may bring an \naction in their own name for twenty years after reaching majority. A party who prevails \nunder the Act must be awarded attorneys’ fees.  \nArkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson vetoed HB1570 because he believed it \ncreated “new standards of legislative interference with physicians and parents as they \ndeal with some of the most complex and sensitive matters concerning our young people.” \nHe explained his concern that HB1570 “put[] the state as the definitive oracle of medical \ncare, overriding parents, patients and health-care experts” and described the bill as a “vast \ngovernment overreach.” The Governor added that “The leading Arkansas medical \nassociations, the American Academy of Pediatrics and medical experts across the country \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 3 of 80\nall” opposed the bill, voicing concerns that “denying best practice medical care to \ntransgender youth can lead to significant harm to the young person.” He also noted that \nHB1570 “does not grandfather in those young people who are currently under hormone \ntreatment,” and that those adolescents would “be left without treatment” when Act 626 \nwent into effect. (Pls.’ Ex. 17).  \nHB1570 was enacted into law as Act 626 on April 6, 2021, following the \nLegislature’s override of Governor Hutchinson’s veto. See Pls.’ Ex. 16, at 10; Pls.’ Ex. \n26; Pls.’ Ex. 27. A simple majority of the Arkansas General Assembly overrode the \nGovernor’s veto. \nPlaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that Act 626 violates the Equal Protection \nClause, Due Process Clause, and the First Amendment. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory \njudgment on each claim and a permanent injunction of enforcement of Act 626. Plaintiffs \nfiled a motion for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, the Court granted the motion \nfor preliminary injunction on the record and filed a written order supplementing the \nruling on August 2, 2021. The State appealed the Court’s Order to the Eighth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. On August 25, 2022, the Eighth Circuit affirmed, see Brandt by & \nthrough Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661 (8th Cir. 2022).  \nThe Court held an eight-day bench trial on this matter. At trial, the Court heard \ntestimony from: Plaintiffs’ fact witnesses—Plaintiffs Joanna Brandt, Dylan Brandt, \nAaron Jennen, Donnie Ray Saxton, Amanda Dennis, and Dr. Kathryn Stambough; and \nDr. Michele Hutchison;3 Plaintiffs’ expert witnesses—Dr. Dan Karasic, Dr. Deanna \nAdkins, Dr. Jack Turban, and Dr. Armand Antommaria; the State’s fact witnesses—Dr. \n \n3 During the trial, the Court dismissed Plaintiff Hutchison as a party because she no longer practices \nmedicine in the State of Arkansas. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 4 of 80\nStephanie Ho, Dr. Janet Cathey, Cathy Campbell, Dr. Roger Hiatt, Laura Smalts, and \nClifton Francis “Billy” Burleigh Jr.; and the State’s expert witnesses—Dr. Stephen \nLevine, Prof. Mark Regnerus, Dr. Patrick Lappert, and Dr. Paul Hruz.  \nThe Court also received exhibits from both parties, as well as testimony from \nDefendant Amy Embry (the Rule 30(b)(6) designee of Defendant Arkansas State Medical \nBoard), Dr. Rhys Branman and non-party Representative Robin Lundstrom by deposition \ndesignations.  \nThe parties filed post-trial briefs (ECF Nos. 265, 266) and proposed findings of \nfact (ECF Nos. 257, 259) for the Court’s consideration.  \nPlaintiffs contend that Act 626 categorically prohibits transgender adolescents4 \nwith gender dysphoria from treatment that the patient, their parents, and their medical \nproviders agree is medically necessary and in the adolescent’s best interest. They allege \nthat the Act singles out individuals in need of medically necessary gender-affirming care \nsolely because the individual’s gender identity does not conform to their assigned sex at \nbirth. The State asserts that Arkansas has a compelling government interest in protecting \nthe health and safety of its citizens, particularly “vulnerable” children who are gender \nnonconforming or who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex. AR \nLEGIS 626 (2021). The State also contends that it has a compelling government interest \nin ensuring the ethical standards of the healthcare profession.  \n \n \n4 Under Arkansas law, a minor is a person under the age of eighteen (18) years old. The term “adolescent” \nis used to describe a person from the time they begin puberty until they reach adulthood on their eighteenth \nbirthday. For purposes of this opinion, the Court will use the terms “adolescent” and “minor” \ninterchangeably.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 5 of 80\nII.  Findings of Fact5   \n \nA. Gender Identity, Gender Incongruence and Gender Dysphoria \n  \n1.  “Gender identity” refers to a person’s deeply felt internal sense of belonging to a \nparticular gender. (Tr. 24:11-15, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)). It is a “core part of who you \nare.” (Tr. 266:6-11, 267:11-15, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)).  \n2.  Most people are “cisgender” and have a gender identity that aligns with their sex assigned \nat birth—the sex placed on their birth certificate at birth based on their external genitalia. \n(Tr. 24:16-20, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)). \n3.  Transgender people have a gender identity that does not align with their birth-assigned \nsex. (Tr. 24:21-23, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)). \n4.  “Gender incongruence” is a condition where a person’s gender identity does not align \nwith their birth-assigned sex. \n5.  There is no evidence that gender incongruence is the result of a dysfunctional family life, \nand many transgender people come from healthy, supportive families. (Tr. 100:4-16, ECF \nNo. 219 (Karasic)).  \n6.  Gender identity is not something that an individual can control or voluntarily change. Id. \nat 29:13-15 (Karasic); 267:11-15 (Adkins).  \n7.  Efforts to change a person’s gender identity to become congruent with their birth- \nassigned sex have been attempted in the past without success and with harmful effects. \nId. at 29:16-20, 30:3-24 (Karasic).  \n \n5 These facts are accurate as of the date of trial. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 6 of 80\n8.  Efforts to change an individual’s gender identity can harm individuals by increasing \nfeelings of shame and creating an expectation that change is possible when it is not, \nwhich can increase a sense of failure. Id. at 30:12-19 (Karasic).  \n9.  Because efforts to change an individual’s gender identity through therapy are ineffective, \nsuch efforts are now considered unethical by many mental health organizations including \nthe American Psychological Association. Id. at 30:3-11 (Karasic); Tr. 325:18-326:4, ECF \nNo. 220 (Turban).  \n10.  Although people cannot voluntarily change their gender identity, a person’s \nunderstanding of their gender identity can change over time. (Tr. 30:25-31:9, ECF No. \n219 (Karasic); 266:12-267:15, 270:24-271:1 (Adkins); Tr. 331:9-15, ECF No. 220 \n(Turban)).  \n11.  Research and clinical experience show that when gender incongruence continues after the \nonset of puberty, it is very unlikely that the individual will come to identify with their sex \nassigned at birth later in life. Id. at 310:16-25 (Turban); Tr. 267:25-268:7, 271:2-15, ECF \nNo. 219 (Adkins); 98:7-25, 173:2-9 (Karasic).  \n12.  The term “transgender male” refers to a person who was assigned female at birth who has \na male gender identity. “Transgender female” refers to a person who was assigned male \nat birth who has a female gender identity.  \n13.  The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders-5 (“DSM”) is a list of mental health disorders put out by the American \nPsychiatric Association and updated periodically. (Tr. 25:16-20, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)). \nIt compiles criteria for psychiatric diagnoses that are generally relied on by practitioners \nin the psychiatric profession. Id. at 142:10-15 (Karasic).  \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 7 of 80\n14.  The lack of alignment between one’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth \n(gender incongruence) can cause significant distress. The medical term for this distress is \ngender dysphoria. Id. at 24:7-10 (Karasic).  \n15.  Gender dysphoria can increase with the onset of puberty and the development of \nsecondary sex characteristics that do not align with one’s gender identity. Id. at 37:14-22 \n(Karasic).  \n16.  The diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults include \nincongruence between an individual’s experienced or expressed gender and their sex \nassigned at birth lasting for at least six months and accompanied by clinically significant \ndistress or impairment in social or occupational function. Id. at 26:20-27:3 (Karasic).  \n17.  The diagnosis of gender dysphoria is made by a clinician who assesses whether a patient \nmeets criteria based on a clinical interview, the clinician’s observations of the patient, \nand the reports of the minor’s parents. Id. at 27:7-28:1 (Karasic). This is how diagnoses \nof other mental health conditions are generally made. Id. at 28:2-5 (Karasic); Tr. 894:23-\n895:6, ECF No. 246 (Levine).  \n18.  Gender dysphoria is a serious condition that, if left untreated, can result in other \npsychological conditions including depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicidality, and \nimpairment in functioning. (Tr. 28:17-21, ECF No. 219 (Karasic); 236:11-19 (Adkins)). \n19.  It is widely recognized in the medical and mental health fields that, for many people with \ngender dysphoria, the clinically significant distress caused by the condition can be \nrelieved only by living in accordance with their gender identity, which is referred to as \ngender transition. This can include social transition—e.g., dressing, grooming, and using \na name and pronouns consistent with one’s gender identity—and, for adolescents and \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 8 of 80\nadults, may also include gender-affirming medical care—i.e., medical treatments to align \nthe body with one’s gender identity. (Tr. 111:1-18, ECF No. 219 (Karasic); 197:16-20, \n232:23-233:5 (Adkins); Tr. 324:18-325:3, ECF No. 220 (Turban)).  \n20.  There is evidence of a rise in referrals to gender clinics in the United States in recent \nyears. The increase in gender clinic patients is not surprising given the undisputed \ntestimony that there is an increase in awareness of gender dysphoria and an increase in \nthe number of gender clinics and insurance coverage for treatment, making such care \navailable when it previously was not. (Tr. 77:17-78:15, 79:3-79:10, ECF No. 219 \n(Karasic)). \n21.  If any adolescents are seeking care at gender clinics because of social influence, they \nwould not meet the criteria of gender dysphoria or be considered for gender-affirming \nmedical treatment unless they had a longstanding incongruent gender identity and \nclinically significant distress. Id. at 87:6-88:1 (Karasic). \nB. The Science and Resulting Guidelines \n22.  The Arkansas chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Arkansas Academy of \nPediatrics, the American College of OB/GYN, the American Academy of Child \nAdolescent Psychologists, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \nthe Arkansas Psychological Association, and other scientific and medical organizations \nall recognized the effectiveness and safety of gender-affirming medical care. (Pls.’ Ex. 24 \nat 30:20-31:17, 32:4-19; Pls.’ Ex. 25 at 40:19-42:16).  \n23.  Two professional associations, the World Professional Association for Transgender \nHealth (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society,6 have published widely-accepted clinical \n \n6 Both associations joined in an Amici Curiae brief in support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. (ECF No. 30). \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 9 of 80\npractice guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria. Id. at 31:11- 22, 33:22-34:1 \n(Karasic).  \n24.  WPATH is a professional association that develops treatment recommendations through a \ncommittee of renowned experts in transgender health. Id. at 31:23-25, 32:13-18 \n(Karasic). WPATH has been publishing guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria \nand prior diagnoses related to gender incongruence since 1979. Its current version—the \nWPATH Standards of Care for the Treatment of Transgender and Gender Diverse \nPeople, Version 8—was published in 2022. Id. at 31:17-22 (Karasic).  \n25.  The Endocrine Society is a professional society of over 15,000 endocrinologists and \nendocrinology researchers. (Tr. 383:11-14, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n26.  The Endocrine Society first published guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria in \n2011 with a second edition in 2017. They are called Endocrine Treatment of Gender-\nDysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons: An Endocrine Society Guideline. (Tr. 31:17-22, \n33:12-17, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n27.  The Endocrine Society Guideline for treatment of gender dysphoria is similar to other \nclinical practice guidelines published by the Endocrine Society concerning other medical \ntreatments. Id. at 198:10-16 (Adkins).  \n28.  Like other clinical practice guidelines, the WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine \nSociety Guidelines were developed by experts in the field, including clinicians and \nresearchers, who used systematic processes for collecting and reviewing scientific \nevidence. Id. at 32:13-18, 102:14-103:2 (Karasic).  \n29.  Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society, like other large medical and mental health \nassociations such as the American Psychiatric Association, develop guidelines for \n9 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 10 of 80\ntreatment as well as advocate for policies relevant to their patient populations. Id. at \n104:25-105:21 (Karasic).  \n30.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines for the treatment of \ngender dysphoria are recognized as best practices by the major medical and mental health \nprofessional associations in the United States, including the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological \nAssociation, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Child \nand Adolescent Psychology. Id. at 34:2-12 (Karasic).  \n31.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines are widely followed \nby clinicians. Id. at 34:13-19 (Karasic); 197:24-198:20, 273:5-8 (Adkins). \n32.  Transgender care is not experimental care. \n33.  Providing treatment for gender dysphoria does not cause a person to be or remain \ntransgender and there is no treatment that can change a person’s gender identity. Id. at \n29:13-20, 98:7-99:21 (Karasic). \n34.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines, treatment for \ngender dysphoria differs depending on whether the patient is a prepubertal child, an \nadolescent, or an adult. Id. at 35:20-37:13 (Karasic).  \n35.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines, before puberty, \ntreatment is focused on support for the child and family. Some prepubertal children may \nsocially transition. No medical interventions are indicated or provided for the treatment \nof gender dysphoria in prepubertal children. Id. at 36:5-10 (Karasic); 198:21-199:2 \n(Adkins).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 11 of 80\n36.  In addition to social transition, medical interventions such as medications to delay \npuberty (“puberty blockers” or “pubertal suppression”), hormone therapy, and in some \nmore rare instances, surgery, may become medically indicated for youth who experience \ndistress after the onset of puberty (i.e., during adolescence) under the WPATH Standards \nof Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines. Id. at 36:11-37:13; 38:19- 39:1 (Karasic); \n199:3-12 (Adkins).  \n37.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines, treatment \ndecisions for adolescents with gender dysphoria are individualized based on the needs of \nthe patient, and gender-affirming medical treatments are not indicated or appropriate for \nall adolescents with gender dysphoria. Id. at 43:9-12 (Karasic); 200:18-24 (Adkins).  \n38.  As with clinical practice guidelines in other areas of medicine, the WPATH Standards of \nCare recognize that it may be appropriate for doctors to deviate from the guidelines in \nindividual cases where, in the clinician’s judgment, such deviation is appropriate. (Tr., \n35:11-19, 187:5-188:15, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \nC. Informed consent  \n39.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines have provisions for \ninformed consent for treatment that are consistent with principles of informed consent \nused throughout the field of medicine. (Tr. 401:4-15, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n40.  In general, before any medical treatment is provided to a patient, the health care provider \nmust obtain informed consent. Informed consent means patients—and in the case of \nminors, their parents or guardians—are informed of the potential risks, benefits, and \nalternatives to treatment so they can weigh them and decide whether to pursue treatment. \n(Tr. 53:7-13, ECF No. 219 (Karasic); Tr. 380:10-19, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n11 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 12 of 80\n41.  In general, adolescents are able to understand the risks, benefits, and alternatives to a \nmedical intervention. Id. at 381:1-8, 381:18-22 (Antommaria). The assent of \nadolescents—meaning their agreement with the proposed course of treatment— should \nbe obtained. Id. at 380:20-381:8 (Antommaria). \n42.  Even when adolescents are able to understand the risks, benefits, and alternatives to \ntreatment and assent to treatment, their parents or guardians must still provide informed \nconsent. Id. at 380:1-9 (Antommaria).  \n43.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines provide that, before \ngender-affirming medical treatments are provided to adolescent patients, the patient and \ntheir parents or guardians must be informed of the potential risks, benefits and \nalternatives to treatment and consent must be provided by the parents or guardians. Id. at \n400:11-401:3 (Antommaria); Tr. 274:7-275:19, ECF No. 219 (Adkins).  \n44.  For hormonal therapy, the WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines \nspecifically provide that patients and their parents or guardians must be informed of the \npotential impact of treatment on fertility and counseled on options for preserving fertility. \n(Tr. 400:11-21, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria); Tr. 53:25-54:12, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n45.  The WPATH Standards of Care also provide that clinicians should inform families about \nthe nature and limits of the evidence base regarding gender-affirming medical treatment \nfor adolescents as part of the informed consent process. Id. at 55:7- 16 (Karasic).  \n46.  The WPATH Standards of Care provide that, before any potentially irreversible medical \ntreatments, families should be informed that some individuals may come to feel gender-\naffirming medical care is not a good fit for them as their feelings about their gender \nidentity could change. Id. at 54:13-55:6 (Karasic).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 13 of 80\n47.  In some cases, a mental health diagnosis may impair an individual’s medical decision-\nmaking capacity, in which case treatment would be delayed. (Tr. 382:7-11, ECF No. 220 \n(Antommaria); 321:12-322:3 (Turban)). Having a mental health diagnosis does not \nnecessarily mean that an individual lacks medical decision- making capacity. Id. at \n382:12-14 (Antommaria). If a patient suffers from depression or anxiety, that does not \nmean they cannot consent to treatment. Id. at 414:2-11 (Antommaria); Tr. 1056:3-22; \nECF No. 248 (Lappert)).  \n48.  The informed consent process is adequate to enable minor patients and their parents to \nmake decisions about gender-affirming medical care for adolescents.  \nD. Medical Interventions  \nStep One: Psychotherapy \n49.  The WPATH Standards of Care spell out that the comprehensive mental health \nassessment prior to medical treatments for adolescents should include a thorough history \nof the person’s gender identity and the stability of that identity; an assessment of other \nconditions that could affect presentation like a co-occurring psychiatric disorder; and the \nadolescent’s cognitive maturity to make decisions and understand the future \nconsequences of those decisions and their capacity to participate in care. (Tr. 43:13-45:2, \nECF No. 219 (Karasic)). \n50.  The WPATH Standards of Care provide that any co-occurring mental health conditions \nshould be addressed. Id. at 48:17-21 (Karasic); Tr. 199:21-24, ECF No. 219 (Adkins).  \n51.  The WPATH Standards of Care recognize that autism spectrum disorder is present in \nhigher rates among youth with gender dysphoria and that this needs to be considered \nwhen diagnosing and assessing a patient for treatment. WPATH Standards of Care \n13 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 14 of 80\nrecommend that when assessing patients who have autism spectrum disorder, more time \nmay be needed and differences in communication should be taken into account. Id. 48:6-\n16 (Karasic).  \n52.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend that \nmental health professionals should be involved in decisions about whether medical \ntreatments are indicated and appropriate for a given adolescent. Id. at 45:23-46:9; 47:1-7 \n(Karasic); Tr. 307:13-22, ECF No. 220 (Turban). WPATH Standards of Care specifically \nrecommend that “health care professionals involve relevant disciplines, including mental \nhealth and medical professionals, to reach a decision about whether [medical \ninterventions] are appropriate and remain indicated throughout the course of treatment \nuntil the transition is made to adult care.”7 (Tr. 45:23-46:9, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n53.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines provide for a \ncomprehensive mental health assessment and diagnosis before an adolescent is provided \ngender-affirming medical treatment. Id. at 43:13-44:13,155:17-22 (Karasic); Tr. 322:10-\n19, ECF No. 220 (Turban). \n54.  Psychotherapy can be important for individuals with gender dysphoria to address and \nalleviate other conditions such as depression and anxiety, but it does not alleviate the \nunderlying distress due to the incongruence between a person’s gender identity and birth-\nassigned sex. (Tr. 29:16-20, 64:1-7, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)). There are no \npsychotherapeutic interventions that have been demonstrated to be effective at alleviating \nthe gender dysphoria itself. Id. at 99:22-100:3 (Karasic).  \n \n7 Quotes from the WPATH Standards of Care refer to the current edition, version 8.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 15 of 80\n55.  Not all individuals experiencing gender incongruence decide to seek treatment beyond \npsychotherapy. \nStep Two: Puberty Blockers  \n56.  The purpose of puberty blockers is to alleviate or prevent the worsening of the distress of \ngender dysphoria by pausing the physical changes that come with puberty. This treatment \nalso provides the patient time to further understand their gender identity before initiating \nany irreversible medical treatments. Id. at 233:9-22 (Adkins); Tr. 318:7-22, ECF No. 220 \n(Turban).  \n57.  Gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone, or GnRH agonists (often referred to as \npuberty blockers), pause puberty at the stage it was in when treatment started. (Tr. \n202:23-203:16; 233:6-14, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)). \n58.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines, puberty \nblockers may be indicated as treatment for gender dysphoria for youth who have been \nconfirmed to have started puberty, which is referred to as Tanner Stage 2. Id. at 205:3-15 \n(Adkins). Tanner Stage 2 begins at the first sign of puberty. (Tr. 205:5-7, ECF No. 219 \n(Adkins)). The age at which youth begin puberty varies significantly but typically starts \nbetween the ages of eight and fourteen for those assigned female at birth and between the \nages of nine and fourteen for those assigned male at birth. Id. at 211:8-21 (Adkins).  \nStep Three: Hormone Therapy  \n59.  The purpose of hormone therapy is to alleviate the distress of gender dysphoria by \naligning the body to be more congruent with the individual’s gender identity. Id. at 37:23-\n38:2 (Karasic); 234:3-8 (Adkins); Tr. 417:21-418:9, ECF NO. 220 (Antommaria).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 16 of 80\n60.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines, hormone \ntherapy—estrogen and anti-androgens for transgender girls, and testosterone for \ntransgender boys— may be indicated for some adolescents with gender dysphoria. (Tr. \n36:11-21, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n61.  Transgender females treated with estrogen and anti-androgens will go through hormonal \npuberty like their cisgender female counterparts. They will develop typically female \nsecondary sex characteristics such as breasts, softened skin, and fat distribution typical of \nfemales. Id. at 215:11-18 (Adkins).  \n62.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines do not recommend \nhormone therapy for adolescents with gender dysphoria unless the patient’s articulation \nof their gender identity has been long-lasting and stable. The WPATH Standards of Care \nspecifically provide that hormone therapy should be recommended to adolescents only if \nthe experience of gender incongruence has lasted for years. (Tr. 50:20- 51:4, ECF No. \n219 (Karasic)).  \n63.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines also require that, \nbefore providing hormone therapy, adolescents should demonstrate the emotional and \ncognitive maturity to understand the risks and be able to think into the future and \nappreciate the long-term consequences. Id. at 52:19-53:6 (Karasic); Tr. 400:22-401:15, \nECF No. 220 (Antommaria).  \n64.  The WPATH Standards of Care provide detailed guidance to clinicians about how to \nassess adolescents’ maturity. (Tr. 58:17-59:8, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n16 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 17 of 80\nStep Four: Surgery  \n65.  The Arkansas Children’s Hospital Gender Clinic does not provide surgical treatment to \npatients. (Tr., ECF No. 275 at 605:8-11 (Stambough); 520:14-18 (Hutchison)).  \n66.  Genital surgeries for adolescents are extremely rare. (Tr. 36:11-21, 55:10-16; ECF No. \n219 (Karasic); Tr. 820:23-24, ECF No. 246 (Levine)). In their many years of treating \nadolescents with gender dysphoria, neither Dr. Karasic nor Dr. Adkins has ever referred a \nminor patient for genital surgery. (Tr. 186:23-25, 189:21-190:5, ECF No. 219 (Karasic); \n231:17-19 (Adkins)).  \n67.  With respect to genital surgeries for minors, the Endocrine Society Guideline does not \nrecommend any such surgeries until after age 18. Id. at 38:19-39:9 (Karasic). The \nWPATH Standards of Care do not have an age threshold for vaginoplasty but \nrecommends that it should be offered only to patients under 18 with great caution after a \nthorough assessment of the patient’s maturity. It does not recommend phalloplasty for \nanyone under 18. Id. at 36:22-37:7, 38:8-18 (Karasic).  \n68.  In the rare instance that an adolescent has gender-affirming surgery, the overwhelming \nmajority of surgeries are chest surgeries for adolescent transgender males. Id. at 36:18-20 \n(Karasic).  \n69.  The WPATH Standards of Care and Endocrine Society Guidelines provide that chest \nmasculinization surgery may be appropriate for some transgender male adolescents prior \nto age 18 to help align the body with the individual’s gender identity to alleviate gender \ndysphoria. There are no specific age requirements but, like the requirements for hormone \ntherapy, the gender incongruence must be long-standing, and the patient must be deemed \n17 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 18 of 80\nto have the cognitive maturity to understand the risks and effects of this treatment. Id. at \n158:11-23 (Karasic).  \nE.  Gender-Affirming Medical Care for Adolescents in Arkansas  \n70.  The Arkansas Children’s Hospital (“ACH”) Gender Clinic is the primary provider of \ngender-affirming medical care for adolescents with gender dysphoria in Arkansas. It has \nseen more than 300 patients since it opened in 2018. (Tr. 516:13-517:1, 520:19-21, ECF \nNo. 275 (Hutchison)).  \n71.  The ACH Gender Clinic’s protocols8 are aligned with the WPATH Standards of Care and \nEndocrine Society Guidelines. Id. at 518:20-23 (Hutchison); 602:21-604:20 \n(Stambough).  \n72.  In February 2022, leadership at ACH changed the protocols of the Gender Clinic to stop \ninitiating gender-affirming medical care for patients under 18 who were not already \nreceiving such treatment, while continuing such treatment for patients who were already \nreceiving such care. Id. at 551:13-552:4 (Hutchison). The Hospital sent a letter to \npatients’ families informing them that the change was due to concern that Act 626 might \ngo into effect in the near future and disrupt patients’ care. Id. at 552:5-17 (Hutchison); \n602:10-20 (Stambough). The Clinic continues to provide hormone therapy to 81 patients \nunder age 18. Id. at 602:21-603:4 (Stambough). Because the change in protocol was \nbased on Act 626, Dr. Stambough expects that, if the law is permanently enjoined, the \nGender Clinic will resume providing gender-affirming medical care for new patients. Id. \nat 603:5-10 (Stambough).  \n \n8 References to ACH Gender Clinic protocols throughout these findings of fact refer to the protocols in \nplace prior to February 2022, unless otherwise specified. \n18 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 19 of 80\n73.  Gender-affirming medical treatments that may be provided to adolescents at the ACH \nGender Clinic include puberty blockers, estrogen, testosterone blockers, and testosterone. \nId. at 518:24-519:15 (Hutchison).  \n74.  The ACH Gender Clinic creates individualized treatment plans tailored to the particular \nneeds of each patient. Id. at 521:1-9 (Hutchison); 604:2-6 (Stambough).  \n75.  Not every adolescent patient seen at the ACH Gender Clinic requests or receives gender-\naffirming medical interventions. Id. at 522:4-11 (Hutchison); 604:21-606:19 \n(Stambough).  \n76.  ACH Gender Clinic patients work with Clinic staff and their therapists to assess their \ngender identity. Some patients who have come to the Clinic with issues related to their \ngender identity eventually came to identify with their birth-assigned sex. Those patients \ndid not receive medical interventions. Id. at 548:10-20 (Hutchison); 605:18-606:19 \n(Stambough).  \n77.  Sometimes, ACH Gender Clinic staff do not feel some adolescent patients are ready for \ngender-affirming medical interventions and treatment will not be provided. Id. at 522:16-\n25, 539:18-22 (Hutchison).  \n78.  Only four ACH Gender Clinic patients have been treated with puberty blockers. That is \nbecause most patients come to the Clinic at older ages when such treatment would not be \nindicated. (Tr. 519:12-15; 521:10-19, ECF No. 275 (Hutchison)). Patients who have \nalready progressed significantly into puberty are not appropriate candidates for puberty \nblockers. Id. at 521:22-522:3.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 20 of 80\n79.  The ACH Gender Clinic protocols provide that the following criteria must be met before \ninitiating hormone therapy (estrogen and testosterone blockers for transgender girls, or \ntestosterone for transgender boys) for adolescents:  \na.  the patient must be assessed by the Clinic’s psychologist;  \nb.  the patient must meet the DSM-5 criteria for gender dysphoria;  \nc.  the patient must have a consistent and persistent gender identity;  \nd.  the patient must be in counseling with a therapist;  \ne.  the patient’s therapist must be consulted and must not identify any concerns \nabout starting treatment;  \nf.  the patient must have the cognitive maturity to understand and weigh the risks \nand benefits of treatment;  \ng.  the patient’s parent must provide informed consent;  \nh.  the patient must receive a medical assessment including baseline lab work; and \ni.  the patient must be 14 years of age or older.  \nId. at 524:16-526:9, 529:25-530:14, 531:7-9 (Hutchison).  \n80.  The psychological evaluation conducted by the ACH Gender Clinic psychologist is \ncomprehensive and includes an assessment for gender dysphoria, the patient’s degree of \ndysphoria and the specific sources of distress, and other psychological assessments (e.g., \nfor depression or anxiety) tailored to the patient’s mental health needs. Id. at 526:18-\n527:12 (Hutchison).  \n81.  The ACH Gender Clinic determines whether a patient’s gender identity is persistent and \nconsistent through information collected from the patient, the patient’s parents, the \n20 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 21 of 80\npatient’s therapist, the Clinic psychologist, and the Clinic physician. Id. at 528:5-19 \n(Hutchison).  \n82.  At the ACH Gender Clinic, it is common for Clinic patients to have a long-standing \ntransgender identity by the time they come to the Clinic. The average length of time \nbetween when Clinic patients first identify as transgender and when they first tell a parent \nis 6.5 years. Id. at 528:20-25 (Hutchison).  \n83.  The ACH Gender Clinic has very rarely had patients who only recently discovered their \ngender incongruence. In those cases, the patient would not be considered for hormone \ntherapy for some time because there would be a need to see if the patient’s gender \nidentity remained consistent and persistent over time. Id. at 529:1-13 (Hutchison).  \n84.  At the ACH Gender Clinic, the assessment of the patient’s maturity is based on \ninformation from the parents, the Clinic psychologist, the Clinic physician, and the \npatient’s therapist. Id. at 539:4-17 (Hutchison).  \n85.  Where patients do not demonstrate the maturity to understand the potential risks and \nbenefits of treatment, the ACH Gender Clinic will defer medical treatment. Id. at 539:18-\n540:1 (Hutchison).  \n86.  In cases in which an ACH Gender Clinic patient’s therapist has expressed concerns about \nbeginning hormone therapy, e.g., if they had concerns about the patient’s maturity or \nmood stability, treatment was delayed. Id. at 530:15-531:6 (Hutchison).  \n87.  At the ACH Gender Clinic, no minor is provided hormone therapy unless the patient, \ntheir parents, their doctor, the Clinic psychologist, and the patient’s therapist all approve \ntreatment. Id. at 522:16-25, 530:15-531:14 (Hutchison).  \n21 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 22 of 80\n88.  At the ACH Gender Clinic, for those patients who are treated with hormone therapy, the \naverage length of time between a patient’s first visit to the Clinic and the start of hormone \ntherapy is about 10.5 months. Id. 529:18-24 (Hutchison).  \n89.  The average age of beginning hormone therapy for ACH Gender Clinic patients is 16. Id. \nat 526:10-17 (Hutchison).  \n90.  In the ACH Gender Clinic’s informed consent process, the information provided to \npatients and their parents includes information about the possible risks and side effects of \ntreatment, including potential risks to fertility related to hormone therapy and discussion \nof fertility preservation options. Id. at 531:15-532:18, 537:21- 538:14 (Hutchison); \n613:20-614:3 (Stambough).  \n91.  The ACH Gender Clinic’s informed consent process includes informing families about \nthe limitations on what is known about the effects and risks of treatments. Id. at 533:3-11 \n(Hutchison); 604:12-19 (Stambough).  \n92.  Drs. Hutchison and Stambough similarly observed great distress in their gender dysphoric \nadolescent patients at the ACH gender clinic. Suicidal ideation and self-harm were \ncommon; some patients had attempted suicide, sometimes multiple times. Id. at 542:6-\n543:2 (Hutchison); 609:5-17 (Stambough).  \nF.  The Parent and Minor Plaintiffs9 \nThe Brandt Family  \n93.  Plaintiff Dylan Brandt is 17 years old. (Tr. 658:8-12, ECF No. 275 (Joanna Brandt); \n688:14-15 (Dylan Brandt)). \n \n9 Dylan Brandt, Sabrina Jennen, Brooke Dennis, and Parker Saxton are referred to collectively as the \n“Minor Plaintiffs.” Joanna Brandt, Lacey and Aaron Jennen, Amanda and Shayne Dennis, and Donnie \nSaxton are referred to collectively as the Parent Plaintiffs. Kathryn Stambough is referred to as the \nPhysician Plaintiff.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 23 of 80\n94.  Plaintiff Joanna Brandt is Dylan’s mother. Id. at 658:6-9 (J. Brandt).  \n95.  The Brandts live in Greenwood, Arkansas. Id. at 658:4-5 (J. Brandt); 688:10-11 (D. \nBrandt).  \n96.  Dylan was assigned female at birth, but his gender identity is male. Id. at 659:10-15 (J. \nBrandt); 688:16-20 (D. Brandt).  \n97.  Dylan’s distress around his gender began before puberty. Id. at 689:13-24 (D. Brandt).  \n98.  Dylan informed his mother of his gender dysphoria through a letter he gave her in June \n2019, when he was 13 years old. Id. at 659:16-18 (J. Brandt). \n99.  Dylan has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Id. at 665:9-10 (J. Brandt).  \n100.  After informing his mother, Dylan started socially transitioning—using he/him pronouns \nand the name Dylan. Id. at 691:4-10 (D. Brandt); 662:14- 19 (J. Brandt). He already had \nshort hair but cut his hair shorter and in more typically masculine ways. Id. at 663:10-19 \n(J. Brandt). He also began to shop in the boys’ section of stores. Id. at 663:20-664:4 (J. \nBrandt). Through these steps, Dylan began to be recognized as a boy more in public. Id. \nat 664:5-7 (J. Brandt).  \n101.  Dylan’s mood improved after he started to be recognized as a boy. Id. at 663:22-664:23 \n(J. Brandt). \n102.  Dylan was referred to the ACH Gender Clinic by his pediatrician. Id. at 665:11-16 (J. \nBrandt).  \n103.  Dylan’s first visit to the ACH Gender Clinic was in January 2020. Id. at 666:22- 25 (J. \nBrandt). At that visit, he and his mother met with Dr. Michele Hutchison— the director \nof the Gender Clinic at the time—and the Clinic’s social worker. (Tr. 514:25-515:4, \n517:14, ECF No. 275 (Hutchison); 667:1-7 (J. Brandt). Dr. Hutchison explained the \n23 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 24 of 80\npossible treatment options for adolescents with gender dysphoria and the risks and \nbenefits of those treatments. Id. at 667:8-18, 668:6-11 (J. Brandt).  \n104.  During his first visit to the ACH Gender Clinic, Dylan and his mother and Dr. Hutchison \ndiscussed mental health therapy. Dylan had been in therapy prior to that visit, but he was \nbetween therapists at the time and the Gender Clinic referred him to a therapist near \nwhere he lived. Id. at 667:19-668:3 (J. Brandt).  \n105.  Menstrual cycles were causing Dylan great distress, Dr. Hutchison prescribed menstrual \nsuppression medication at that January 2020 visit. Id. at 668:16-669:5 (J. Brandt).  \n106.  Menstrual suppression did not alleviate Dylan’s gender dysphoria. Id. at 669:8- 10 (J. \nBrandt).  \n107.  Eventually, Dylan began testosterone therapy in August 2020. This decision was made by \nhis mother, a Clinic psychologist who evaluated him, his therapist, Dr. Hutchison, and \nDylan. Everyone agreed it was appropriate for him.10 Id. at 670:22-672:8 (J. Brandt)).  \n108.  Dr. Hutchison had informed Dylan and his mother of the potential risks of treatment \nmore than once. Joanna asked a lot of questions at the Clinic and had done research to \nmake sure she was making the best medical decision for her child. Id. at 661:14-23, \n662:20-663:7, 667:8-18, 668:6-15, 669:11-25, 670:1-21, 671:7-19 (J. Brandt).  \n109.  As a parent, Joanna routinely makes medical decisions for her minor children. Id. at \n658:13-21 (J. Brandt).  \n110.  Dylan has now been on cross-sex hormone therapy for over two and a half years. Id. at \n672:9-10 (J. Brandt).  \n \n10 The trial transcript contains a typographical error. The visit at the ACH Gender Clinic was in August \n2020, not August 2002 the date included in the trial transcript. \n24 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 25 of 80\n111.  Testosterone treatment has significantly alleviated Dylan’s gender dysphoria. Id. at \n673:3-25 (J. Brandt)).  \n112.  Dylan has not experienced any negative side effects from testosterone therapy. Id. at \n672:11-12 (J. Brandt); 694:14-19 (D. Brandt).  \n113.  Dylan has continued regular therapy with a counselor. (Tr. 695:6-7, ECF No. 275 (D. \nBrandt).  \n114.  If Act 626 were to go into effect, medically detransitioning is not an option for Dylan. Id. \nat 696:3-10 (D. Brandt). His mother Joanna fears that stopping treatment would \nnegatively affect his mental health and he would “lose all” of “who he has become.” Id. \nat 675:4-14 (J. Brandt).  \n115.  Dylan and Joanna have discussed moving out of state or traveling out of state regularly \nfor treatment if he cannot continue receiving treatment in Arkansas because of Act 626. \nId. at 675:15-676:9 (J. Brandt); 696:11-12 (D. Brandt).  \nThe Jennen Family  \n116.  Plaintiff Sabrina Jennen is 17 years old. (Tr. 447:18-20, ECF No. 220 (Jennen)). \n117.  Plaintiffs Lacey and Aaron Jennen are her parents. Id. at 447:8-21 (Jennen).  \n118.  Sabrina has two younger sisters. Id. at 447:18-21 (Jennen).  \n119.  The Jennens live in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Id. at 459:25-460:1 (Jennen).  \n120.  Sabrina was assigned male at birth, but her gender identity is female. Id. at 448:15-20 \n(Jennen).  \n121.  Sabrina informed her parents of her gender dysphoria in July 2020, when she was 15. Id.  \nat 448:21-449:23  \n25 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 26 of 80\n122.  After informing her parents, Sabrina started to see a counselor, Cathy Campbell. Id. at \n452:3-10, 454:1-2 (Jennen); Tr. 72:16-18, ECF No. 282 (Campbell). Sabrina continues to \nsee Ms. Campbell regularly. (Tr. 454:3-8, ECF No. 220 (Jennen)).  \n123.  Ms. Campbell diagnosed Sabrina with gender dysphoria. Id. at 453:15-25(Jennen); Tr. \n77:12-78:2, ECF No. 282 (Campbell).  \n124.  In the Summer of 2020, Sabrina started socially transitioning— she began to go by the \nname Sabrina and use she/her pronouns while at home. At the time, she and her family \nhad just moved to Fayetteville, so she prepared to start the new school year as Sabrina. \n(Tr. 452:3-13, ECF No. 220 (Jennen)).  \n125.  Sabrina and Ms. Campbell first discussed hormone therapy in September 2020 when \nSabrina described her intense distress. (Tr. 75:15-76:7, ECF No. 282 (Campbell). After \nthat session, Sabrina discussed hormone therapy with her parents, who were initially \nhesitant. Id. at 76:20-24 (Campbell); Tr. 454:11-18, ECF No. 220 (Jennen).  \n126.  Because Ms. Campbell does not counsel patients about the medical risks of hormone \ntherapy, she gave the Jennens Dr. Stephanie Ho’s name and contact information so that \nthey could speak with a medical doctor in Fayetteville who could best answer their \nquestions. Id. at 76:25-77:8 (Campbell); Tr. 454:11-20, ECF No. 220 (Jennen)).  \n127.  Sabrina’s parents wanted to do more research and better understand the potential risks \nand benefits of hormone therapy before consenting to Sabrina beginning treatment. Id. at \n454:21-455:17, 456:10-17 (Jennen).  \n128.  Sabrina and her parents visited Dr. Ho’s office in December 2020. Id. at 455:18-22 \n(Jennen). They met with a certified nurse practitioner who independently diagnosed \nSabrina with gender dysphoria. (Tr. 82:18-83:1, ECF No. 282 (Ho). Dr. Ho’s staff also \n26 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 27 of 80\nprovided verbal and written information to the Jennens about hormone therapy, including \nthe risks and benefits and information related to fertility preservation, and answered the \nJennens’ questions. (Tr. 455:23-456:7, ECF No. 220 (Jennen)).  \n129.  Before starting hormone therapy, Sabrina had therapy sessions with Ms. Campbell every \nother week for several months. Id. at 454:5-18 (Jennen); (Tr. 75:1-4, ECF No. 282 \n(Campbell)). During that time, Sabrina’s parents participated in some joint family \nsessions with Ms. Campbell. Id. at 75:5-14 (Campbell); Tr. 453:18-23, ECF No. 220 \n(Jennen).  \n130.  Sabrina and her parents discussed and researched hormone therapy. They “took a lot of \ntime, thought and prayer” about whether Sabrina should undergo hormone treatment for \nher gender dysphoria, and they made the decision as a family to move forward with \nexploring hormone treatment. (Tr. 456:10-17, 457:15-19, ECF No. 220 (Jennen)).  \n131.  Dr. Ho did her own assessment and diagnosed Sabrina with gender dysphoria. (Tr. \n749:14- 16, ECF No. 224 (Ho)). She also reviewed with the family how hormone therapy \nworks and the potential risks and benefits of the treatment. (Tr. 456:25-457:11, ECF No. \n220 (Jennen)). Sabrina and her parents consented to Sabrina receiving hormone therapy, \nand Dr. Ho prescribed a testosterone blocker and estrogen. Id. at 457:15-19, 458:1-5 \n(Jennen).  \n132.  Aaron and Lacey Jennen routinely make medical decisions for their children. Id. at \n457:12-14 (Jennen).  \n133.  Ms. Campbell had no concerns about Sabrina’s ability to assent to hormone therapy. (Tr. \n77:25-78:2, ECF No. 282 (Campbell)).  \n27 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 28 of 80\n134.  Sabrina has regularly visited Dr. Ho for monitoring and treatment since January 2021. \nApproximately every three months, Dr. Ho reviews lab tests to monitor Sabrina’s \nhormone levels and check in about Sabrina’s dysphoria. (Tr. 458:6- 16, ECF No. 220 \n(Jennen)).  \n135.  Sabrina’s therapist and doctor agree that hormone therapy is benefitting Sabrina. (Tr. \n78:24-79:9, ECF No. 282 (Campbell); Tr. 749:20-21, ECF No. 224 (Ho)).  \n136.  Ms. Campbell could readily see the change in Sabrina’s mental health after starting \nhormone therapy; she was happier and more outgoing than Ms. Campbell had ever seen \nher. (Tr. 78:3-16, ECF No. 282 (Campbell).  \n137.  For Aaron Jennen, Sabrina not receiving gender-affirming medical care is “not an \noption.” Tr. 462:5-8, 462:20- 463:11, ECF No. 220 (Jennen)). He testified that he would \n“worry about her withdrawing back into the person that she was before she started it, a \nperson that was unhappy, that said things to her mother and I like, what’s the point of life. \nSaying things like, I don’t see a future for myself, which is difficult because how \namazing she is.” Id. at 463:12-20 (Jennen). Aaron testified that if Act 626 went into \neffect, they would either move or travel out of state to get treatment for Sabrina. Id. at \n462:5-19 (Jennen).  \nThe Saxton Family  \n138.  Parker Saxton was 17 years old at the start of trial. (Tr. 430:14-15, ECF No. 220 \n(Saxton)).  \n139.  Donnie Ray Saxton is Parker’s father. Id. at 430:9-19 (Saxton).  \n140.  The Saxtons live in Vilonia, Arkansas. Id. at 444:15-16 (Saxton).  \n28 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 29 of 80\n141.  Parker was assigned female at birth, but his gender identity is male. Id. at 431:15-20 \n(Saxton).  \n142.  Puberty caused significant distress for Parker. He suffered from anxiety and depression \nand would not socialize or answer his phone even with his closest friends. Id. at 432:12-\n15, 433:2-20 (Saxton). It was “troubling” for Donnie to watch. Id. at 433:2-7 (Saxton).  \n143.  Donnie took Parker to see a therapist and psychiatrist who treated him for anxiety and \ndepression. Id. at 434:7-18 (Saxton).  \n144.  Parker was aware of his gender identity since around age 9. (Tr. 557:21-22, ECF No. 275 \n(Hutchison). He informed his father in a letter in 2019 when he was approximately 14 \nyears old. (Tr. 431:24-432:4, 434:7-10; ECF No. 220 (Saxton)).  \n145.  At the time Donnie read Parker’s letter, he “didn’t have a clue what transgender meant \noutside of what we see in the news and everything.” Id. at 434:19-435:2 (Saxton).  \n146.  If someone were to stereotype the most unlikely parent of a transgender child, it would be \nDonnie Ray Sexton. Donnie is a good and loving father. \n147.  In June 2020, when Parker was 15, Parker’s psychiatrist referred him to the Gender \nClinic at ACH. Id. at 435:11-14, 25 (Saxton).  \n148.  At the ACH Gender Clinic, Parker initially was prescribed Depo-Provera as a menstrual \nsuppressant to alleviate the distress caused by his period. Id. at 437:20-21 (Saxton). \n149.  The menstrual suppression helped alleviate some of Parker’s gender dysphoria but did \nnot fully address it. Parker still had depression, social anxiety, compulsive bathing, and \nan aversion to his reflection. Id. at 437:22-438:9 (Saxton).  \n150.  Parker went to follow-up visits at the ACH Gender Clinic regularly. Id. at 438:14, 439:8 \n(Saxton).  \n29 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 30 of 80\n151.  About three or four months after his first visit, Parker expressed that he thought \ntestosterone might be helpful for him. Id. at 439:9-12 (Saxton).  \n152.  On May 27, 2021, Parker began testosterone therapy. Id. at 442:21-25 (Saxton). Before \nstarting treatment, Parker was evaluated by an ACH psychologist who confirmed the \ngender dysphoria diagnosis and conducted a psychological evaluation of Parker. Id. at \n440:4-19 (Saxton). At the May 27th appointment, Parker, Donnie, and Dr. Hutchison \nextensively discussed the risks and benefits of treatment—including the potential impact \non Parker’s fertility—and they ultimately decided to move forward. Id. at 439:11-441:3, \n442:25-443:15 (Saxton).  \n153.  As a parent, Donnie routinely makes medical decisions for his children. Id. at 430:21-25 \n(Saxton).  \n154.  Testosterone therapy has significantly alleviated Parker’s gender dysphoria. Id. at 443:18-\n20 (Saxton).  \n155.  Parker’s doctors also observed the positive impact of testosterone therapy on Parker’s \ngender dysphoria. (Tr. 559:9-23, ECF No. 275 (Hutchison); Tr. 619:13-15, EF No. 275 \n(Stambough).  \n156.  Before Parker turned 18 in November 2022, the Saxton family talked about what they \nwould do if Act 626 were to take effect and Parker could no longer receive testosterone \ntherapy in Arkansas. It was a “hard talk,” and they concluded that they’d “have to pick up \nand leave.” (Tr. 445:21-446:17, ECF No. 220 (Saxton)).  \n157.  After HB 1570 was introduced, the possibility of care being prohibited resulted in Parker \nSaxton going to such a “dark place” that his father started sleeping near him because of \nconcern he might hurt himself. Id. at 441:15-24, 442:2-14 (Saxton).  \n30 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 31 of 80\nThe Dennis Family  \n158.  Plaintiff Brooke Dennis is 10 years old and is in fifth grade. (Tr. 638:18-21, ECF No. 275 \n(Dennis).  \n159.  Plaintiffs Amanda and Shayne Dennis are her parents. Id. at 638:5-12 (Dennis).  \n160.  Brooke has an older brother and a younger sister. Id. at 638:17-18 (Dennis).  \n161.  The Dennises live in Bentonville, Arkansas. Id. at 650:3-10 (Dennis).  \n162.  Brooke was assigned male at birth, but her gender identity is female. Id. at 639:11-15 \n(Dennis).  \n163.  Brooke started identifying as a girl in second grade. Id. at 639:16-19 (Dennis).  \n164.  Brooke continues to have fear, anxiety, and distress about the fact she could go through a \ntypically male puberty. Id. at 620:21-621:6 (Stambough); 648:17-649:2 (Dennis).  \n165.  Shortly after Brooke expressed her female gender identity to her mother in April 2020, \nthe Dennises made an appointment for Brooke to see a therapist. Id. at 644:3-10 (Dennis). \nThe Dennises wanted to have “as much information as possible to be able to make a good \ndecision” on “how to move forward.” Id. at 643:22- 24, 649:24-650:2 (Dennis).  \n166.  After Brooke saw the therapist for a while, the therapist diagnosed Brooke with gender \ndysphoria. Id. at 644:13-17 (Dennis).  \n167.  After the Dennises discussed Brooke’s gender with her pediatrician, the pediatrician \nreferred them to the ACH Gender Clinic. Id. at 644:18-645:6 (Dennis).  \n168.  In October 2020, the Dennises had their first visit at the ACH Gender Clinic and met with \nDr. Hutchison and other staff. Id. at 645:7-12 (Dennis). The purpose of the first visit was \nto help the family learn about the Clinic and the care they provided and get information \nabout gender dysphoria and what they should be learning more about. Id. at 645:7-646:15 \n31 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 32 of 80\n(Dennis). They discussed Brooke’s history and childhood. Id. at 645:22-25 (Dennis). No \nmedical treatments for gender dysphoria were indicated for Brooke because she has not \nyet started puberty. Id. at 645:7-648:16 (Dennis); 620:18-20 (Stambough).  \n169.  Brooke continues to express “a lot” of distress about her body related to her gender. She \nis specifically anxious about going through puberty. Id. at 620:18-621:6 (Stambough); \n647:9-23, 648:7-649:11 (Dennis).  \n170.  Brooke is still receiving counseling related to her gender dysphoria. Id. at 649:12-14 \n(Dennis).  \n171.  As parents, Amanda and Shayne routinely make medical decisions for their three \nchildren. Id. at 649:15-17 (Dennis).  \n172.  Act 626 is causing great anxiety for the Dennis family. Amanda and Shayne have \ndiscussed what they would do if Act 626 takes effect and Brooke is not able to get \ngender-affirming medical treatment in Arkansas. They would need to regularly travel out \nof state or move out of state to get Brooke care, and either scenario would be logistically, \nfinancially, and emotionally difficult. Id. at 652:11-22 (Dennis).  \n173.  If the family were to move away, Amanda might have to give up her job as head of \nbusiness operations for the digital ad platform at Sam’s Club within the Walmart \nEnterprise, which would cause financial hardship for the family. Id. at 650:11- 14, \n651:17-652:1, 654:3-656:18, 653:2-655:22 (Dennis).  \n174.  Amanda Dennis testified about the financial impact on the family, as well as the impact \non the care of her other two children and an aging relative, her job, and Brooke’s \nattendance at school if she and Brooke had to regularly travel out of state for medical \ncare. Id. at 652:11-657:11 (Dennis).  \n32 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 33 of 80\nG. Studies and Findings on Treatments Prohibited by Act 626  \n175.  Decades of clinical experience have shown that adolescents with gender dysphoria \nexperience significant positive benefits to their health and well-being from gender- \naffirming medical care. (Tr. 67:8-12, ECF No. 219 (Karasic); 233:15-22 (Adkins); Tr. \n298:7-18, 305:2-19, ECF No. 220 (Turban); Tr. 543:3-544:11, ECF No. 275 (Hutchison); \nTr. 606:20-608:6, 609:22-610:1, ECF No. 275 (Stambough)).  \n176.  Clinical experience shows the long-term effectiveness of gender-affirming medical care \nas some adolescents with gender dysphoria are able to discontinue antidepressants and \nanti-anxiety medications after receiving gender-affirming medical care. (Tr. 231:23-\n232:7, ECF No. 219 (Adkins); Tr. 64:8-65:19, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)). \n177.  There are 16 scientific studies assessing the use of puberty blockers and hormone therapy \nto treat adolescents with gender dysphoria, and this body of research has found these \ntreatments are effective at alleviating gender dysphoria and improving a variety of mental \nhealth outcomes including anxiety, depression, and suicidality. (Tr. 295:16-18, 298:7-18, \n300:24-301:2, 301:5-17, 302:20-303:8, 303:22-305:1, ECF No. 220 (Turban); Tr. 68:15-\n69:14, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n178.  The studies evaluating the use of puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria saw \nimprovements in mental health or that patients did not experience worsening of mental \nhealth as is typically the case when children with gender dysphoria go through puberty. \n(Tr. 299:5-301:2, 318:5-22, ECF No. 220 (Turban)).  \n179.  The studies evaluating the use of hormone therapy to treat adolescents with \ngender dysphoria had findings similar to the results of dozens of studies of gender-\n33 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 34 of 80\naffirming hormones for adults—both sets of studies found significant improvements in \nmental health. Id. at 302:20-303:21 (Turban).  \n180.  Conclusions cannot be drawn from any single study (in any area of medical research), but \nthe body of medical research as a whole shows that gender-affirming medical treatments \nare effective at improving mental health outcomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria. \nId. at 300:21-301:2 (Turban).  \n181.  The evidence base supporting gender-affirming medical care for adolescents is \ncomparable to the evidence base supporting other medical treatments for minors. Id. at \n389:25-390:3; 409:9-15 (Antommaria).  \n182.  The evidence supporting gender-affirming medical care for adolescents with gender \ndysphoria includes scientific studies, that are cross-sectional and longitudinal, and \nclinical experience. Id. at 295:22-296:8, 299:5-14, 305:2-19 (Turban). Longitudinal \nstudies follow mental health before and after treatment. Id. at 296:24-2951 (Turban). \nCross-sectional studies compare people who receive treatment and do not receive \ntreatment at one point in time. Id. at 296:3-6 (Turban). \n183.  There are no randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of gender- \naffirming medical care for adolescents. Id. at 296:9-13 (Turban). Such research is not \npossible because it would not be ethical or feasible to have a study in which a control \ngroup is not provided treatment that is known from clinical experience and research to \nbenefit patients. Id. at 296:14-297:3 (Turban); 363:13-364:5, 385:23-386:7 \n(Antommaria). Additionally, it would not be possible to blind the studies to researchers \nand participants given the obvious physical effects of the treatments. Id. at 365:1-24, \n34 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 35 of 80\n387:16-388:2 (Antommaria); 296:14-297:11 (Turban); Tr. 67:19-68:14, ECF No. 219 \n(Karasic).  \n184.  It is common for clinical practice guidelines in medicine to make recommendations based \non low or very low-quality evidence such as cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. (Tr. \n377:24-378:2, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria); Tr. 1269:12-17, ECF No. 249 (Hruz)).  \n185.  The treatments banned by Act 626 are widely recognized in the medical community, \nincluding by the major professional medical associations, as effective treatments for \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, based on the clinical experience and \nscientific research. (Tr. 34:2-12, 102:3-103:12, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n186.  There are no other evidence-based treatments besides those prohibited by Act 626 that \nare known to alleviate gender dysphoria. (Tr. 326:16-327:5, ECF No. 220 (Turban)).  \nH. Potential Risks and Side Effects of the Gender-Affirming Care  \n187.  As with other medical treatments, gender-affirming medical treatments can have potential \nrisks and side effects that must be weighed by patients and their parents after being \ninformed of those risks and side effects by their doctors. (Tr. 390:4-392:4, 394:24-395:3, \n400:11-21, 401:4-15, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n188.  The risks of gender-affirming medical care are not categorically different than the types \nof risks that other types of pediatric healthcare pose. Id. at 390:24-391:6 (Antommaria).  \n189.  For many adolescents the benefits of treatment greatly outweigh the risks.  \n190.  For many adolescents, gender-affirming medical care significantly alleviates the distress \nof gender dysphoria, improves their mental health, and enables them to engage in school \nand social activities.  \n35 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 36 of 80\n191.  Adverse health effects from gender-affirming medical care are rare when treatment is \nprovided under the supervision of a doctor. (Tr. 220:25-221:9, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)).  \n192.  The evidence showed that the risks associated with the treatments prohibited by Act 626 \nare comparable to the risks associated with many other medical treatments that parents \nare free to choose for their adolescent children after weighing the risks and benefits. (Tr. \n930:17, ECF No. 246 (Levine); Tr. 1319:2-4, ECF No. 249 (Hruz)). Off-label use of \ndrugs is both permitted and common in Arkansas. (Pl.’s Ex. 9, at 137:21-25 (Embry)).  \n193.  There is nothing unique about the risks of gender-affirming medical care for adolescents \nthat warrants taking this medical decision out of the hands of adolescent patients, their \nparents, and their doctors.  \n194.  It is common for adolescents to undergo medical treatments that carry comparable or \ngreater risks than gender-affirming medical care. (Tr. 389:25- 390:3, 394:20-395:3, ECF \nNo. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n195.  There are treatments for conditions other than gender dysphoria that can impair a minor’s \nfertility, e.g., treatments for certain rheumatologic conditions, kidney diseases, and \ncancers. Id. at 391:6-9; 417:8-12 (Antommaria); Tr. 222:23:19-24, ECF No. 219 \n(Adkins). Some of these treatments are provided at ACH, when appropriate for the \nparticular patient. (Tr. 615:10-12, ECF No. 275 (Stambough)). Patients and families are \nsimilarly informed of the risk and weigh it in deciding whether to undergo the medical \ntreatment. (Tr. 222:19-24, 227:2-5, ECF No. 219 (Adkins); Tr. 615:13-25, ECF No. 275 \n(Stambough)).  \n196.  Except for the potential risk to fertility, the risks associated with puberty blockers, \ntestosterone, estrogen and anti-androgens are the same regardless of the condition for \n36 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 37 of 80\nwhich they are being used and whether they are used to treat birth- assigned males or \nbirth-assigned females. (Tr. 206:18-21, 217:4-25, 219:13-220:2, ECF No. 275 (Adkins)).  \n197.  Puberty blockers that are used to delay puberty as treatment for gender dysphoria are also \nused to treat other conditions, including central precocious puberty. Central precocious \npuberty is puberty that starts earlier than the typical age for the start of puberty. (Tr. \n204:11-18, ECF No. 219 (Adkins); Tr. 1223:6-10, ECF No. 249 (Hruz)). Precocious \npuberty can occur when a child is as young as two. (Tr. 211:3-5, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)).  \n198.  Decades of clinical experience and research on the use of puberty blockers, both for \ntreatment of central precocious puberty and gender dysphoria, have shown this treatment \nto be safe. (Tr. 212:25-213:2, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)).  \n199.  Patients on puberty blockers for precocious puberty are, on average, treated for a longer \nperiod of time than gender dysphoria patients. (Tr. 210:19-211:7, ECF No. 219 \n(Adkins)). For precocious puberty, pubertal suppression treatment can last as long as nine \nyears. For gender dysphoria, pubertal suppression treatment typically does not last for \nmore than three or four years. This is the case at the ACH Gender Clinic. (Tr. 210:19-\n211:7, ECF No. 220 (Adkins); Tr. 540:2-542:5, ECF No. 275 (Hutchison)).  \n200.  An expected effect of puberty blockers is the delay of rapid accrual of bone \nmineralization that occurs during puberty. (Tr. 205:16-207:12, ECF No. 219 (Adkins); \nTr. 390:8-16, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)). While patients are on puberty blockers, they \ncontinue to accrue bone mineralization at prepubertal rate. (Tr., 209:2-13, ECF NO. 219 \n(Adkins)). Once puberty blockers are stopped and puberty resumes—either the person’s \nendogenous puberty or an exogenous puberty prompted by hormone therapy—the accrual \nof bone mineralization increases at the usual pubertal rate. Id. at 209:2-210:1 (Adkins)).  \n37 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 38 of 80\n201.  Generally, a patient will reach the normal range of bone density within “two to three \nyears after [a patient is] on either gender-affirming hormones or go[es] through \n[endogenous] puberty.” Id. at 210:2-7 (Adkins).  \n202.  There have been some patients who do not achieve full bone density after treatment with \npuberty blockers. These patients tend to have had low bone density and risk factors for \nlow bone density to begin with. Such risk factors include a family history of osteoporosis, \nlow Vitamin D status, low physical activity, poor nutritional status, or low weight. Id. at \n210:8-18 (Adkins).  \n203.  Puberty blockers are fully reversible. If an adolescent discontinues such treatment, \nendogenous puberty will resume. Id. at 206:13-17, 208:21- 209:1 (Adkins).  \n204.  If a patient treated with puberty blockers stops treatment and resumes their endogenous \npuberty, the medication has no impact on fertility. Id. at 208:21- 209:1, 222:25-223:1 \n(Adkins).  \nMasculinizing Hormone Therapy  \n205.  Testosterone is used to treat cisgender adolescent male patients for a number of \nconditions including delayed puberty, hypogonadism (where the brain does not tell the \nbody to go through puberty), and micropenis. Id. at 213:11-19 (Adkins); Tr. 1248:19-\n1249:2, ECF No. 249 (Hruz).  \n206.  Risks associated with taking testosterone, regardless of the condition for which it is used \nor the birth-assigned sex of the patient, include changes in cholesterol profile and blood \nthickness (hematocrit) to the typical male range. Id. at 215:19-216:20, 217:4-9, 221:10-\n222:2, 278:8-12 (Adkins); Tr. 390:20-23, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria); Tr. 1249:23-\n1250:8, ECF No. 249 (Hruz).  \n38 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 39 of 80\n207.  When treatment is monitored by a doctor to ensure appropriate therapeutic levels, adverse \nhealth effects are rare. (Tr. 220:25-221:9, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)).  \n208.  When birth-assigned females are treated with testosterone, it can impact fertility. Id. at \n216:21-217:3 (Adkins).  \n209.  If testosterone therapy follows treatment with puberty blockers at Tanner 2 such that the \novaries never develop, it can cause infertility. This is discussed with patients and parents \nprior to initiating treatment. If maintaining fertility is important to the family, there are \nways to manage treatment to preserve fertility, for example, by delaying the start of \npuberty blockers until a later stage of puberty or temporarily stopping blockers to allow \novaries to develop. Id. at 225:12-226:4; 226:5-22. (Adkins).  \nFeminizing Hormone Therapy  \n210.  Hormone treatments used to treat transgender females with gender dysphoria— estrogen \nand anti-androgens—are used to treat many other conditions. (Tr. 203:1-25, ECF No. 219 \n(Adkins).  \n211.  Estrogen is used to treat cisgender adolescent girls for a number of conditions including \ndelayed puberty, ovarian failure, and Turner Syndrome (a congenital condition that \nprevents puberty from occurring). Id. at 214:3-11 (Adkins); Tr. 632:10-13, ECF No. 275 \n(Stambough); Tr. 1257:22-1258:10, ECF No. 249 (Hruz).  \n212.  Anti-androgens are used to treat cisgender adolescent girls and women with polycystic \novarian syndrome and hirsutism. (Tr. 213:20-214:2, ECF No. 219 (Adkins); Tr. 1245:10-\n25, ECF No. 249 (Hruz)).  \n213.  The risks of estrogen, regardless of the condition it is being used for and whether used on \nbirth-assigned females or birth-assigned males, include blood clots (increasing stroke \n39 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 40 of 80\nrisk), lower hemoglobin levels, and increase in prolactin. (Tr. 218:1-219:16, ECF No. 219 \n(Adkins); Tr.1259:15-24, 1261:18-21, ECF No. 249 (Hruz)). Adverse health effects of \nfeminizing hormone therapy present primarily among those who use excessive and \nunmonitored amounts of estrogen. (Tr. 278:13-279:8, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)).  \n214.  The risks and side effects of anti-androgens, regardless of the condition it is being used \nfor and whether used to treat birth-assigned females or birth-assigned males, include an \nincrease in potassium levels. Id. at 217:10-25 (Adkins).  \n215.  When treatment with estrogen or anti-androgens is monitored by a doctor to ensure \nappropriate therapeutic levels, adverse health effects are rare. Id. at 218:1-219:16; 220:6-\n21 (Adkins).  \n216.  When estrogen is used to treat birth-assigned males, it can impact fertility. This is \ntherefore discussed with patients and parents prior to initiating treatment and fertility \npreservation options are discussed. Id. at 219:17-220:12 (Adkins).  \n217.  If feminizing treatment follows treatment with puberty blockers at Tanner 2 such that the \ntesticles never developed, it can cause infertility. Id. at 225:17-226:4 (Adkins). \nChest Masculinization Surgery  \n218.  The surgical risks of chest masculinization surgery are comparable to the risks related to \nother chest surgeries adolescents may undergo, including mastectomy or breast reduction \nfor cisgender girls and gynecomastia surgery for cisgender boys. (Tr. 391:10-392:16, \nECF No. 220 (Antommaria). \nI. Desistance, Detransitioning and Regret  \n219.  There are some individuals who undergo gender-affirming medical treatment who later \ncome to regret that treatment and, for some, it was because they came to identify with \n40 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 41 of 80\ntheir birth-assigned sex (sometimes referred to as detransitioning). This can happen with \nindividuals who medically transitioned as adolescents or as adults. Regret over a medical \nprocedure is not unique to gender-affirming medical care and is common in medicine. \n(Tr. 77:1-16, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n220.  In Dr. Karasic’s clinical experience treating thousands of patients with gender dysphoria \nover 30 years, none of his patients came to identify with their sex assigned at birth after \nmedically transitioning. Id. at 72:11-18 (Karasic). Some of Dr. Karasic’s patients have \nhalted their medical transition for other reasons such as lack of insurance coverage or fear \nof losing family support. Some of these patients later resumed their medical transition. \nNone of his patients who stopped or paused medical transition did so because they came \nto identify with their sex assigned at birth. Id. at 72:19-73:17 (Karasic).  \n221.  Detransition is taken seriously by WPATH and medical providers. Parents and patients \nare advised of the potential that patients may ultimately come to a different understanding \nabout their gender later in life. Id. at 75:13-24 (Karasic). The desistance studies relied on \nby the State to assert that gender incongruence will naturally desist for most youth were \nfocused on prepubertal children and say nothing about the likelihood of gender \nincongruence desisting among adolescents, the group affected by Act 626. (Tr. 311:1-11, \nECF No. 220 (Turban); Tr. 88:2-89:6, 93:2-17, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)).  \n222.  “Watchful waiting” is an approach used by some health care providers with pre- pubertal \nchildren with gender dysphoria. It entails following prepubertal children with gender \ndysphoria and not encouraging social transition prior to puberty. It is not a recognized \napproach for adolescents with gender dysphoria because it is understood that, at that \npoint, gender incongruence is unlikely to desist. Even gender clinics using the “watchful \n41 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 42 of 80\nwaiting” approach for prepubertal children provide gender-affirming medical care to \npatients whose gender dysphoria persisted past the onset of puberty. Id. at 96:21-98:6 \n(Karasic).  \n223.  Providing gender-affirming medical care does not cause youth to persist rather than desist \nin their gender incongruence. Adolescents with gender dysphoria are unlikely to desist \nwhether or not they receive gender-affirming medical care. And youth do not receive \nmedical treatment unless their gender incongruence has persisted into adolescence. Id. at \n96:16-20, 99:4-25 (Karasic).  \n224.  Billy Burleigh and Laura Smalts testified about their experiences transitioning as adults \nand subsequently detransitioning. They stated they feel regret about their medical \ntransitions. The Court finds these anecdotal experiences credible but also irrelevant to the \nissues to be decided. These witnesses’ experiences are irrelevant to this case given that (i) \nneither sought nor received gender-affirming care as a minor (ii) both transitioned as \nadults (Tr. 1156:13-21, ECF No. 247 (Smalts); 1199:3-17, 1200:9-14 (Burleigh)); (iii) \nneither was treated in Arkansas Id. at 1157:2-11 (Smalts);  1210:15-23 (Burleigh)); (iv) \nthey both detransitioned as a result of a religious experience and (v) continued to struggle \nwith living consistently with their birth-assigned sex after deciding to detransition Id. at \n1158:2-13, 1159:2-1160:2 (Smalts); 1203:10-1206:3, 1206:16-1207:1, 1207:8-13, \n1207:22-25 (Burleigh)).  \nJ. Regulation of Medicine in Arkansas  \nThe Arkansas State Medical Board Regulates the Practice of Medicine in Arkansas  \n225.  All states have medical boards that safeguard the practice of medicine by evaluating \naccusations of unprofessional conduct and taking disciplinary action against providers, \n42 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 43 of 80\nwhich may include withdrawal of a medical professional’s license. (Tr. 402:17-20, ECF \nNo. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n226.  The Arkansas State Medical Board (the “Board”) is the state entity charged with \nregulating the practice of medicine in Arkansas. (Pl, Ex. 9 at p. 42:7-11 (Embry)). The \nBoard’s structure and functions are governed by the Arkansas Medical Practices Act \n(“AMPA”). (Pls.’ Ex. 11, at Subchapter 3, p. 21-25).  \n227.  The Board’s mission is “to protect the public and act as their advocate by effectively \nregulating the practices of medical doctors. . ..” (Pls.’ Ex. 12; Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 45:9-25 \n(Embry)). The Board regulates all the roughly 19,000-20,000 healthcare professionals \nwhom it licenses. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 42:20- 22, 43:19-25 (Embry)).  \n228.  The Board is authorized “to promulgate and put into effect such rules and regulations as \nare necessary to carry out the purposes of the Arkansas Medical Practices Act.” (Pls.’ Ex. \n9 at 46:2-6 (Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 11 Section 17-95-303(2) at 23). While the Board typically \nenacts regulations pursuant to explicit statutory requirements or requests made by \nlegislators, if the Board has a concern about how medical care is being provided in a \nparticular field, it can also draft a rule regarding that subject and submit it to the \nlegislature for approval. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 46:15-47:21, 49:4-10, 49:20-505, 54:15-20, 62:25-\n63:19 (Embry).)  \n229.  The Board tries to enact regulations that are consistent with best practices in a particular \nfield. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 60:22-61:3 (Embry)). The Board has worked with professional \nassociations such as the Arkansas Medical Society in drafting rules, reviewing their best \npractice guidelines, and soliciting their expertise as professionals within their field. (Pls.’ \n43 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 44 of 80\nEx. 9 at 59:8-60:21 (Embry)). The Board may also look to national groups like the \nAmerican Medical Association for information. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 63:20-64:10 (Embry)).  \nThe Board Investigates and Disciplines Medical Providers for Unprofessional \nConduct  \n \n230.  The Board is authorized to investigate and discipline the medical practitioners whom it \nlicenses for unprofessional conduct, including ethical violations as determined by the \nBoard. (Pls.’ Ex. 9, at 93:22-24, 96:6-976, 101:9-102:5 (Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 11 Section 17-\n95-409(a)(1) -(a)(2) at 28-29). Investigations are often based on complaints filed with the \nBoard. Sometimes issues come to the Board’s attention through other means, such as the \nnews. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 43:9-18, 44:8-9, 72:21-74:18 (Embry)).  \n231.  The Board may, and does, investigate whether doctors are practicing their profession in a \nway that could endanger the public health or welfare. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 72:6- 18 (Embry); \nPls.’ Ex. 11 at 17-80-106(c)(2) at 2).  \n232.  Failure to follow accepted medical practice can be a reason for investigation, and the \nBoard considers accepted standards in a field of medicine when assessing whether there \nhas been a violation of the AMPA. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 81:16-19, 83:17-23 (Embry)).  \n233.  The penalties that the Board may impose for unprofessional conduct include revoking or \nsuspending licenses, issuing reprimands, imposing probation, and levying fines. (Pls.’ Ex. \n9 at 109:17-113:6, 114:3-115:3 (Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 11 17-95-410(e)(3) at 29).  \n234.  When issues concerning particular medical care arise, the Legislature and the Board pass \nlaws and regulations to address how care is provided; they do not prohibit medical \ntreatments. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 137:11-20 (Embry)).  \n235.  When over-prescription of opioids resulted in the opioid epidemic and caused harm to the \npublic in Arkansas, the Legislature passed the Chronic Intractable Pain Treatment Act. \n44 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 45 of 80\n(Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 126:8-127:11 (Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 11 Section 17-95-701 at 34-35). Rather \nthan categorically banning opioids, the law provides a system of incremental sanctions \nfor doctors who overprescribe opioids, beginning with monitoring prescribing habits, \nthen voluntarily surrendering a DEA license for a period of time, then suspending the \nphysician’s license, and finally revoking the license. (Pls.’ Ex. 11 Section 704(c)(1) at \n35). Doctors have faced discipline for improper prescription of opioids under this section, \nincluding monitoring and the surrender of their DEA licenses. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 130:5-8, \n130:20-131:18 (Embry)). This system of incremental sanctions for improper prescription \nof opioids serves to effectively protect the public from harmful conduct. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at \n131:19-22 (Embry)).  \n236.  Because of serious risks related to gastric bypass surgery, the Legislature and Board \nestablished informed consent requirements before a doctor can perform gastric bypass \nsurgery. (Pls.’ Ex. at 132:13-133:2 (Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 11 Subsections A through M of \nRule 27 mandate a lengthy list of various complications and information that the \ninformed consent process must address; Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 133:23-134:6 (Embry)). This \nincludes 33 potential surgical complications, nutritional complications, psychiatric \ncomplications, eight pregnancy complications, and 22 additional complications. Id. at \n134:7-135:20 (Embry)). The rule further requires that licensees inform patients that there \nis no guarantee of weight loss or long-term weight management as a result of getting \nsurgery, and that a lifetime of follow-up medical care is required. Id. at 135:4-20 \n(Embry)). The informed consent provisions in the Board’s regulation related to gastric \nbypass surgery effectively protect the public from harm. Id. at 136:6-14 (Embry).  \n45 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 46 of 80\n237.  After the FDA concluded that it was “no longer reasonable to believe that oral \nformulations of [hydroxychloroquine] and [chloroquine] may be effective in treating \nCOVID-19, nor [was] it reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of \nthese products outweigh their known and potential risks,” (Pls.’ Ex. 15). The Arkansas \nDepartment of Health updated its guidance to indicate that this use “should be avoided” \nin hospital and outpatient settings. But the guidance noted that “Unapproved use (i.e., ‘off \nlabel use’) of these medications is left to the discretion of individual clinicians and their \npatients.” Id. The Board has not considered passing a regulation prohibiting the use of \nhydroxychloroquine to treat COVID. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 143:21-24 (Embry)). The Board has \nreceived several complaints about a doctor inappropriately prescribing ivermectin to treat \nincarcerated people with COVID at a county jail. Id. at 78:8-79:14, 144:14-23 (Embry). \nThe Board has not considered passing a rule prohibiting the use of ivermectin to treat \nCOVID-19. Id. at 148:13-16 (Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 18 at 81:21-82:21 (Branman).  \n238.  Arkansas does not ban medical treatments for lack of randomized controlled clinical trials \nsupporting their use. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 206:23-207:4 (Embry)).  \n239.  Arkansas does not ban medical treatments with a limited evidence base. Id. at 205:9-\n206:6 (Embry).  \n240.  Even where there are known risks of a treatment and no evidence of effectiveness, the \nBoard leaves treatment decisions to patients, parents, and their physicians. Id. at 208:10-\n16 (Embry).  \n241.  Arkansas does not ban medical treatments for minors on the rationale that minors cannot \nprovide informed assent. In Arkansas, parents usually are required consent to medical \n46 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 47 of 80\ntreatment for their minor children, and the decision about whether to undergo care is \nbetween the physician and the parent and the minor patient. Id. at 174:2-15 (Embry).  \n242.  The Board is not aware of any minors in Arkansas who have been harmed by gender-\naffirming care. Id. at 227:17-22 (Embry).  \n243.  The Board has never received a complaint regarding gender-affirming medical care for \nminors or adults. Id. at 152:3-16 (Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 18 at 103:7-10 (Branman).  \n244.  Since Embry became Executive Director in 2018, there has not been discussion about \ngender-affirming medical care for adults or minors at any Board meeting. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at \n152:25-153:25, 217:2-6 (Embry)).  \n245.  Since Embry has been director, the Board has not considered passing a regulation \nconcerning gender-affirming medical care. Id. at 154:2-6 (Embry). No one at the Board \never suggested to Embry that they saw a need for a regulation concerning gender-\naffirming medical care. Id. at 154:7-11 (Embry).  \n246.   If there is an issue regarding the over-prescription of gender-affirming medical \ntreatment, the Board can propose a regulation to address that, as it did for the over- \nprescription of opioids. Id. at 210:25-211:11, 211:25-212:10 (Embry).  \n247.  If there are doctors providing gender-affirming medical treatments to adolescents without \nadequately informing them of the risks of those treatments, the Board could propose an \ninformed consent regulation, as it did for gastric bypass surgeries. Id. at 212:11-21, \n213:20-25 (Embry).  \n248.  The Board is the licensing entity for physicians who are providing procedures prohibited \nby Act 626. Id. at 179:25-180:6, 180:11-14 (Embry). The Board is ready to field any \ncomplaints alleging violations of Act 626 as those arise. Id. at 182:13-19 (Embry).  \n47 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 48 of 80\n249.  If the Board receives a complaint that a doctor was providing gender-affirming medical \ncare to an adolescent, the Board will follow the same general process that it uses for other \ncomplaints to determine whether the Act was violated. Id. at 182:4-12, 182:20-183:14 \n(Embry); Pls.’ Ex. 18 at 108:3-110:3 (Branman).  \n250.  Under the Act, the referral for or provision of gender transition procedures to a minor \nconstitutes unprofessional conduct. (Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 178:20-179:6 (Embry)). If a doctor \nprovided gender-affirming care prohibited by Act 626, the Board would have to make a \nfinding of unprofessional conduct under the statute. Id. at 184:25-185:6 (Embry). The \ndoctor would then be subject to discipline by the Board, including the potential \nrevocation of their license to practice. Id. at 185:7-9, 185:22-186:2 (Embry).  \nK. Policy Concerns Expressed at Trial \n251.  The Arkansas chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Arkansas Academy of \nPediatrics, the American College of OB/GYN, the American Academy of Child \nAdolescent Psychologists, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \nthe Arkansas Psychological Association opined that HB1570 would penalize medical \nproviders for “simply following best medical practices to provide or even refer for \nappropriate effective care that is based in science and evidence,” cause immediate and \nirreversible harm to adolescents receiving care in-state, and limit physicians’ ability to \nrefer youth to care supported by medical experts. (Pls.’ Ex. 23 at 25:25-27:10, 27:11-21).  \nL.  The Harm to Plaintiffs and Others Should Act 626 Take Effect  \n252.  If Act 626 takes effect, adolescents whose parents and doctors agree that gender- \naffirming medical care is appropriate treatment for their gender dysphoria will be unable \nto receive that care in their home state and unable to get referrals from their doctors to \n48 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 49 of 80\nreceive care in other states. This will cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff adolescents, \nPlaintiff parents and Plaintiff doctor. \n253.  The harms are severe and irreparable for adolescents with gender dysphoria who need but \nare unable to access gender-affirming medical care.  \n254.  The fact that transgender adults face elevated rates of physical and mental health issues \ndue to stigma, discrimination, and having lived with gender dysphoria is not a reason to \ndeny treatment to adolescents with gender dysphoria; if anything, it supports the need for \naccess to treatment. (Tr. 47:16-25, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)) \n255.  Denying gender-affirming medical care to adolescents with gender dysphoria until they \nreach age 18 means their bodies would go through irreversible pubertal changes \ninconsistent with their gender identity. Id. at 234:18-235:7 (Adkins).  \n256.  Delaying gender-affirming medical care when indicated puts patients at risk of worsening \nanxiety, depression, hospitalization, and suicidality. Id. at 236:11- 19, 237:1-5 (Adkins); \n111:19-112:3 (Karasic)  \n257.  Act 626 will impact Arkansas adolescents with gender dysphoria who need but are \nunable to access care. After ACH changed its policy in February 2022 to stop initiating \ngender-affirming medical care for new patients given the possibility of Act 626 taking \neffect, many patients for whom puberty blockers or hormone therapy are indicated have \nbeen unable to access care elsewhere. (Tr. 611:10-20, ECF No. 275 (Stambough)). These \npatients are experiencing anxiety and distress. Id. at 611:21-612:6 (Stambough).  \n258.  Not all adolescents with gender dysphoria will live to age 18 if they are unable to get \ngender-affirming medical treatment. (Tr. 28:22-25, ECF No. 219 (Karasic) (testifying \nabout adolescent patients with gender dysphoria who made suicide attempts); 236:14-25 \n49 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 50 of 80\n(Adkins) (testifying about losing a patient to suicide); Tr. 612:20-613:15, ECF No. 275 \n(Stambough) (“I am not hyperbolic when I say that I have concerns that not every patient \nwould be able to make it to 18.”); 549:12-18 (Hutchison) (testifying that she is “worried \nthat we're going to lose some kids” if the law takes effect)).  \n259.  For those adolescents who are already being treated with puberty blockers or hormone \ntherapy and who would be forced to discontinue treatment, experts on both sides agree \nthat the harms are severe.  \n260.  The State’s expert, Dr. Levine, described the psychological impact of cutting off gender-\naffirming medical care for those currently receiving it as “shocking” and “devastating.” \nHe testified he would expect doctors to “find a way” to help those patients, even \nproviding treatment in violation of the law. (Tr. 913:6-914:4, 914:24-915:12, ECF No. \n246 (Levine) (suggesting doctors would provide care “privately . . . that you don’t know \nabout,” “under the radar”)).  \n261.  Discontinuing testosterone in transgender males would cause a decrease in facial and \nbody hair growth, a return to a more typically feminine body shape, and lower muscle \nmass, resulting in the body not being well-aligned with their gender identity. (Tr. 235:8-\n17, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)).  \n262.  Discontinuing testosterone suppression and estrogen in transgender females would result \nin the patient’s beard coming back and shifts in body fat—less hips and chest—that do \nnot align with their gender identity. Id. at 235:20-236:10 (Adkins).  \n263.  Accessing care out of state is a considerable challenge with significant financial costs, \nand it is not something all families have the resources to do. Having to regularly travel \nout of state to take a child to doctor visits can be a great financial and logistical challenge \n50 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 51 of 80\nto families. (Tr. 675:15-677:5, 696:13-24, ECF No. 275 (J. Brandt); 652:11-657:11 \n(Dennis); Tr. 462:20-463:11, ECF No. 220 (Jennen); 445:21-446:17 (Saxton). \n264.  Pursuant to Act 626, doctors who provide gender-affirming medical care to minor \npatients are engaging in unprofessional conduct and are subject to losing their medical \nlicense. (Pls.’ Ex. 16 at 20-9-1504(a)).  \n265.  Dr. Levine, the State’s expert, expressed concern about the possibility of doctors losing \ntheir licenses for continuing to provide gender-affirming medical care. He testified that \nwould be “[d]raconian” and a loss of a community resource. (Tr. 915:13-916:7, 917:16-\n918:11, ECF No. 246 (Levine)).  \n266.  Requiring doctors to discontinue gender-affirming medical care that they are currently \nproviding to adolescent patients—and prohibiting them from referring those patients to \nobtain care elsewhere—conflicts with their ethical obligation not to abandon patients \nunder the AMPA. (Pls.’ Ex. 14 at 20-6-202(a)(2); Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 244:2, 19-22; 244:23-24; \n236:17-237:4 (Embry)).  \n267.  The AMPA provides that “healthcare providers are prohibited legally and ethically from \nabandoning a patient before treatment has been concluded.” (Pls.’ Ex. 14 at 20-6- \n202(a)(2); Pls.’ Ex. 9 at 244:2, 19-22; 244:23-24; 236:17-237:4 (Embry)). Under this \nprovision, if a doctor who is treating a patient is required to stop care before treatment is \nconcluded, the doctor has an ethical obligation to help the patient find care from another \ndoctor. Id. at 199:13-20 (Embry).  \n268.  Doctors can be disciplined by the Board for abandoning a patient in violation of Ark. \nCode Ann. § 20-6-202.

He \ncompleted medical school at the Washington University School of Medicine and his \nresidency at the University of Utah. He is currently the director of the Ethics Center at \nCincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and a professor at the University of \nCincinnati School of Medicine. As director of the Ethics Center, Dr. Antommaria \nprovides clinical ethics consultation and works with a variety of medical teams to address \nethical issues that arise in the care that they provide, including the transgender clinic and \nthe differences of sex development clinic. He has also published numerous scholarly \narticles about medical ethics. (Pls.’ Ex. 4; Tr. 357:19-359:11, ECF No. 220 \n(Antommaria)). \nKathryn Stambough, M.D.  \n277.  Plaintiff Dr. Kathryn Stambough earned her medical degree from Washington University \nSchool of Medicine in St. Louis and completed a fellowship in Pediatric and Adolescent \nGynecology at Baylor College of Medicine Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. (Tr. \n598:2-9, ECF No. 275 (Stambough)).  \n278.  Dr. Stambough is an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical \nSciences (“UAMS”) and a member of the Division of Pediatric and Adolescent \nGynecology. Id. at 598:20-599:3 (Stambough).  \n279.  Dr. Stambough has a clinical appointment at ACH where she practices in multiple clinics: \nthe Gender Clinic; the Gynecology Clinic; the In-STEP Clinic, which cares for patients \nwith differences of sexual development; and the Spinal Cord Disorders Clinic. She also \n54 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 55 of 80\nhas a clinical appointment and serves as a member of the team at UAMS in the Adult \nGender Clinic. Id. at 599:14-600:22 (Stambough).  \n280.  Dr. Stambough has been practicing in the ACH Gender Clinic since August 2020. She \nhas been the Clinic’s medical director since July 2022. Id. at 601:10-24 (Stambough).  \n281.  Currently, 248 patients are being actively seen in the ACH Gender Clinic. Id. at 601:25-\n602:6 (Stambough).  \n282.  The Clinic currently is providing hormone therapy to 81 patients. Id. at 602:21-603:4 \n(Stambough).  \n283.  Dr. Stambough treats patients in the Gender Clinic, including with puberty blockers and \nhormone therapy. Id. at 604:2-20, 619:7-12 (Stambough).  \n284.  Dr. Stambough has seen the distress of gender dysphoria experienced by her adolescent \npatients and how gender-affirming medical care alleviates that distress and improves her \npatients’ health. Id. at 606:23-607:22 (Stambough).  \n285.  If Act 626 takes effect, Dr. Stambough would be unable to provide medically necessary \ncare to patients and would be forced to leave them to needlessly suffer. Id. at 610:2-21, \n612:3-613:15 (Stambough).  \n286.  In the course of her practice, Dr. Stambough sometimes refers patients to another \nhealthcare provider which involves discussions with the patients and their families. Id. at \n615:13-17 (Stambough). In making a referral, Dr. Stambough’s discussion with her \npatients includes options for where to obtain the care. Id. at 615:18-25 (Stambough).  \n287.  If Act 626 were to go into effect, Dr. Stambough would be unable to make all the \nreferrals necessary to care appropriately for her Gender Clinic patients. Id. at 616:1-5 \n(Stambough).  \n55 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 56 of 80\n288.  Some of Dr. Stambough’s gender dysphoria patients would not be able to bring a lawsuit \non their own behalf to challenge Act 626 for various reasons, including not being out to \nmembers of their extended family or keeping their gender identity private in certain other \ncontexts. Id. at 618:20-25 (Stambough).  \nPlaintiffs’ Expert Opinions Generally \n289.  Plaintiffs’ experts’ extensive experience, their testimony in court, and their demeanor and \nresponsiveness to questions asked by both sides and the Court, show that all four of \nPlaintiffs’ expert witnesses have deep knowledge of the subject matter of their testimony \nand were fully qualified to provide the opinion testimony they offered. They have \nprovided credible and reliable testimony relevant to core issues in this case. \nN. The State’s Experts \nStephen B. Levine, M.D. \n290.  Dr. Stephen Levine is a licensed physician and Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Case \nWestern Reserve University School of Medicine where he attended medical school. He \nco-created the first gender identity clinic in Ohio in 1974 and has been seeing patients \nsince that time. He has authored five books on sexual health, is the Senior Editor of the \nfirst three editions of the Handbook of Clinical Sexuality for Mental Health Professions. \nHe has authored numerous invited papers, commentaries, chapters, and book reviews and \nwas awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Society for Sex Therapy and \nResearch in March 2005. (Def. Tr. Ex. 1).  \n291.  Dr. Levine was the State’s only expert witness who has experience treating patients with \ngender dysphoria. In his practice, he has enabled minor patients with gender dysphoria to \naccess hormone therapy on a case-by-case basis. (Tr. 785:3-6, ECF No. 246 (Levine)). \n56 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 57 of 80\nDr. Levine does not support banning gender-affirming medical care for adolescents with \ngender dysphoria. He has concerns about Act 626’s impact on youth who are currently \nreceiving gender-affirming hormones.  \n292.   Dr. Levine testified that doctors who provide gender-affirming medical care to \nadolescents with gender dysphoria encourage patients to identify as transgender and \nprovide hormones immediately without assessing patients and addressing other mental \nhealth conditions or informing patients and their parents of the risks and the limitations of \nthe evidence regarding treatments. Id. at 809:18- 810:4; 811:21-812:10; 824:5-14 \n(Levine). He offered no evidence that treatment was being provided this way in Arkansas \nor anywhere in the United States. Dr. Levine conceded he has no knowledge of how most \ngender clinics provide care and, thus, does not know how common it is for care to be \nprovided in the way he described. Id. at 887:19-888:25 (Levine). He further does not \nknow how care is provided by doctors in Arkansas. Id. at 888:24-891:16 (Levine).  \n293.  The Court found Dr. Levine a very credible witness who struggles with the conflict \nbetween his scientific understanding for the need for transgender care and his faith.  \nMark Regnerus, Ph.D.  \n294.  Professor Mark Regnerus testified that all the major professional medical groups’ support \nfor gender-affirming medical care for adolescents with gender dysphoria is grounded in \nideology rather than science. (Tr. 994:22-996:10, 1000:17-1001:1, ECF No. 248 \n(Regnerus)). Professor Regnerus’ testimony did not offer any support for his conclusion, \nand the Court finds that there is no evidence to support this assertion.  \n295.  Professor Regnerus, a sociologist whose work has focused on sexual relationship \nbehavior and religion, has no training or experience related to the fields of medicine or \n57 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 58 of 80\nmental health care, or the treatment of gender dysphoria. Id. at 974:5-977:22 (Regnerus). \nHe has never worked in a medical or mental health clinical setting. Id. at 977:1-22 \n(Regnerus).  \n296.  The Court does not credit the testimony of Professor Regnerus and gives it no weight \nbecause the Court finds that he lacks the qualifications to offer his opinions and failed to \nsupport them.11  \nPatrick W. Lappert, M.D.  \n297.  Dr. Patrick Lappert is Board-Certified in Surgery and Plastic Surgery. He is the Founding \nDirector of both the Pediatric Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Deformities Clinic and the \nWound Care Center at Naval Hospital Portsmouth, Virginia. He served the Office of the \nSurgeon General-U.S. Navy as a Specialty Leader in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.  \n \n11 This is not the first time that Professor Regnerus’s testimony as an expert witness has been questioned by \na court. The district court in DeBoer v. Snyder found that Regnerus's research and testimony that gay \nparenting caused adverse outcomes in children was “entirely unbelievable and not worthy of serious \nconsideration” and a “fringe viewpoint that is rejected by the vast majority of [the studies' authors'] \ncolleagues across a variety of social science fields.” DeBoer v. Snyder, 973 F. Supp. 2d 757, 766-68 (E.D. \nMich.), rev'd on other grounds, 772 F.3d 388 (6th Cir. 2014), rev'd sub nom. Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 \nU.S. 644, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 192 L.

Dr. Lappert has no training or professional experience in mental health or gender \ndysphoria and has never provided gender-affirming surgery. He acknowledges that he is \nnot an expert in the treatment of gender dysphoria. (Tr. 1040:16-1042:18, ECF No. 248 \n(Lappert)).  \n299.  Like Professor Mark Regnerus and Dr. Paul Hruz, Dr. Lappert was recruited by the \nAlliance Defending Freedom (“ADF”) at a seminar held in Arizona. The meeting was \nheld to gather witnesses trained in various fields that would be willing to testify in favor \nof laws passed that limit transgender care. The ADF is an organization committed to \nprotecting God’s design for marriage and family. (Tr. 1029:16-1031:24, ECF No. 248 \n(Regnerus)). The ADF is not a scientific organization, but a Christian-based legal \nadvocacy group. Id. at 1080:21-25 (Lappert). While there is nothing nefarious about an \norganization recruiting witnesses to testify for their cause, it is clear from listening to the \ntestimony that Professor Mark Regnerus, Dr. Paul Hruz, and Dr. Lappert were testifying \nmore from a religious doctrinal standpoint rather than that required of experts by \nDaubert. \n300.  Dr. Lappert offered opinions regarding the circumstances under which he believes \ncosmetic or aesthetic surgeries are ethically appropriate in adults and minors and the \npotential risks of various surgeries outside of the context of gender transition. The \nrelevance of Dr. Lappert’s testimony was unclear. The Court finds that he is not qualified \nto offer relevant opinions given his lack of experience related to gender dysphoria. \n301.  Dr. Lappert does not meet the requirements under Daubert to give opinions relevant to \nthis case.  \n59 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 60 of 80\n302.  Dr. Lappert acknowledged that his opinions were his own and were inconsistent with his \npeers and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Id. at 1080:5-9, 1081:16-21 \n(Lappert). \nPaul W. Hruz, M.D., Ph.D.  \n303.  Dr. Paul Hruz is a Pediatric Endocrinologist. He is currently the Associate Professor of \nPediatrics, Endocrinology and Diabetes and the Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Cell \nBiology & Physiology at Washington University of St. Louis School of Medicine. He \nreceived his M.D. and Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the Medical College of Wisconsin. He \nreceived certification in Healthcare Ethics from the National Catholic Bioethics Center in \n2017. In addition to teaching and authorship of many articles and papers, Dr. Hruz \npractices Pediatric Endocrinology at St. Louis Children’s Hospital.  \n304.  Dr. Hruz has never treated a patient for gender dysphoria. (Tr. 1317:21-23, ECF No. 249 \n(Hruz)). \n305.  The legislative findings in Act 626 assert that there is insufficient evidence of the efficacy \nof gender-affirming medical care for minors. Some of the state’s expert witnesses—Dr. \nLevine and Dr. Hruz—offered opinions to that effect. (Tr. 833:12-16, ECF No. 246 \n(Levine); Tr. 1274:15-25, ECF No. 249 (Hruz)). The Court does not credit these opinions \nbecause it finds that the evidence showed that decades of clinical experience in addition \nto a body of scientific research demonstrate the effectiveness of these treatments. For the \nsame reason, the Court finds that the treatments banned by Act 626 are not \n“experimentation” on youth, as suggested by the Act’s title. ARK. CODE ANN. § 20-9-\n1501 (2021) (“Arkansas Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act”); Tr. \n382:25-383:4, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n60 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 61 of 80\n306.  Dr. Hruz suggested that the Court should disregard the body of research showing benefits \nof gender-affirming medical care for adolescents because it is low-quality research, and \nthe studies have methodological limitations such as lack of a control group or cross-\nsectional design. (Tr. 1275:20-1277:4, 1277:18-1278:21, 1279:7-1280:22, 1291:14-\n1292:8, ECF No. 249 (Hruz)). The Court declines to do that. The Court finds that the \nquality of the evidence supporting gender-affirming medical interventions for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria is comparable to the quality of evidence supporting many other \nmedical treatments minors and their families may pursue. And while the Court recognizes \nthat the studies on gender-affirming medical care for adolescents, like studies in all areas \nof medical research, have strengths and weaknesses, it does not credit Dr. Hruz’s \nassessment that the entire body of research is, therefore, meaningless. The body of \nresearch, taken as a whole, shows these treatments provide significant benefits to \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  \n307.  Dr. Hruz also testified about risks of puberty blockers, testosterone, anti-androgens, and \nestrogen, suggesting this is a basis to prohibit gender-affirming medical care for \nadolescents. Id. at 1247:4-10; 1257:11-20, 1261:18-25; 1262:1-1263:13 (Hruz). The \nweight of evidence speaks to the contrary. \n308.  Like Plaintiffs’ experts, Dr. Hruz recognized that apart from the potential impact on \nfertility, the risks of these treatments also exist when these medications are provided to \ntreat other conditions in cisgender patients. Compare Id. with 1229:24- 1230:22, 1249:14-\n1250:8, 1259:15-1260:3 (Hruz). These risks have not prevented Dr. Hruz from providing \nthese medications to cisgender patients in his pediatric endocrine practice. Id. at 1222:22-\n24, 1244:11-17, 1248:16-18, 1257:21-24 (Hruz).  \n61 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 62 of 80\nDefendant’s Expert Opinions Generally \n309.  The State suggests that Act 626 is consistent with medical guidelines issued by “nations \naround the world.” See Def. Tr. Br. at 21. Their experts referenced guidelines issued by \ngovernment health authorities in Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom. But the \nCourt finds that the evidence showed that none of these guidelines have prohibited \ngender-affirming medical care for minors. (Tr. 405:19-406:6, 406:20-407:24, ECF No. \n220 (Antommaria)).  \n310.  In Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom, gender-affirming medical care is provided \nto adolescents with gender dysphoria when indicated under their guidelines. For example, \nin Finland, the guidelines provide that hormone therapy can be provided to minors based \non a thorough case-by-case consideration if it can be ascertained that the adolescent’s \nidentity as the other sex is of a permanent nature and causes severe dysphoria. (Tr. \n938:23-939:3, ECF No. 246 (Levine)). In the United Kingdom, the National Health \nService has expanded care from one central clinic to regional clinics to broaden access to \ncare. (Tr. 406:20-407:19, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)).  \n311.  Most of the State’s expert witnesses, Professor Mark Regnerus, Dr. Stephen Lappert, and \nDr. Paul Hruz, were unqualified to offer relevant expert testimony and offered unreliable \ntestimony. Their opinions regarding gender-affirming medical care for adolescents with \ngender dysphoria are grounded in ideology rather than science. See also Doe v. Ladapo, \n2023 WL 3833848, at *2 (N.D. Fla. June 6, 2023) (comments on expert testimony of \nLappert and Hruz); Kadel v. Folwell, 620 F. Supp. 3d 339, 368 (M.D.N.C. 2022) (same). \n \n62 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 63 of 80\nIII.  Conclusions of Law \nA. Standing \nConstitutional standing requires that at least one plaintiff demonstrate they have \nsuffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged \naction and is likely to be redressed by a court ruling in the plaintiff’s favor. See Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). “To show standing under Article III \nof the U.S. Constitution, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) injury in fact, (2) a causal \nconnection between that injury and the challenged conduct, and (3) the likelihood that a \nfavorable decision by the court will redress the alleged injury.” Iowa League of Cities v. \nEPA, 711 F.3d 844, 869 (8th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). The undisputed evidence at \ntrial established that, if the Act were to go into effect, (i) three of the Minor Plaintiffs—\nParker Saxton, Dylan Brandt, and Sabrina Jennen—would have to discontinue treatment \nthat they, their parents, and their doctors all agree is medically indicated for them and \nbenefitting their health and well-being, and Minor Plaintiff Brooke Dennis would be \nunable to obtain treatment she will imminently need; (ii) the Parent Plaintiffs would have \nto watch their children suffer the loss of care or endure severe personal and financial \nhardship to access care for their children in other states, and (iii) the Physician Plaintiff, \nDr. Kathryn Stambough, would be unable to treat her patients who need care, leaving \nthem to suffer, and unable to refer them to other doctors to provide care when necessary. \nAs the Court has held, those injuries are directly traceable to the Act and would be \nredressed by a permanent injunction barring its enforcement. The evidence presented at \ntrial confirms that Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims. \n63 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 64 of 80\nB.  Equal Protection \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “is essentially a direction \nthat all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (citing Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982)). \n“Put another way, state action is unconstitutional when it creates ‘arbitrary or irrational’ \ndistinctions between classes of people out of ‘a bare ... desire to harm a politically \nunpopular group.’” Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 607 (4th Cir. \n2020), as amended (Aug. 28, 2020) (quoting Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446–47). It protects \nagainst intentional and arbitrary discrimination. See Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 \nU.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam). State action is generally presumed to be lawful and \nwill be upheld if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate \nstate interest. City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440.  \nThe rational basis test, however, does not apply when a classification is based upon \nsex. Rather, a sex-based classification is subject to heightened scrutiny, as sex \n“frequently bears no relation to the ability to perform or contribute to society.” Id. at \n440–41 (quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973)). Act 626 discriminates \non the basis of sex because a minor's sex at birth determines whether the minor can \nreceive certain types of medical care under the law. Brandt by & through Brandt v. \nRutledge, 47 F.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022). The evidence presented at trial supports this \nconclusion. A minor assigned male at birth is not prohibited under Act 626 from \nreceiving testosterone or surgical procedures “such as subcutaneous mastectomy, voice \nsurgery, liposuction, lipofilling, pectoral implants, or various aesthetic procedures” for \nthe purpose of aligning himself with his biological sex. Act 626 does not prohibit a minor \n64 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 65 of 80\nassigned female at birth from receiving estrogen or surgical procedures “such as \naugmentation mammoplasty, facial feminization surgery, liposuction, lipofilling, voice \nsurgery, thyroid cartilage reduction, gluteal augmentation, hair reconstruction or other \naesthetic procedures” to enhance her appearance as long as the enhancements align with \nher biological sex. “The biological sex of the minor patient is the basis on which the law \ndistinguishes between those who may receive certain types of medical care and those \nwho may not. The Act is therefore subject to heightened scrutiny.” Id. at 670 (citing \nHeckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 744 (1984)). \nThe Act also discriminates against transgender people. The law prohibits medical \ncare that only transgender people choose to undergo, i.e, medical or surgical procedures \nrelated to gender transition.12 “[T]ransgender people constitute at least a quasi-suspect \nclass.” Grimm v. Gloucester Cty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 607 (4th Cir. 2020); accord \nBostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1741 (2020) (discrimination for being \ntransgender is discrimination “on the basis of sex”). Transgender people satisfy all indicia \nof a suspect class: (1) they have historically been subject to discrimination; (2) they have \na defining characteristic that bears no relation to their ability to contribute to society; (3) \nthey may be defined as a discrete group by obvious, immutable, or distinguishing \ncharacteristics; and (4) they are a minority group lacking political power. See Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610-613. \n“[A]ll gender-based classifications today warrant heightened scrutiny.” United \nStates v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 555 (1996) (citing J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 \nU.S. 127,136 (9th Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Harrison v. \n \n12 The State argues that people who are not transgender may seek gender transition procedures. There is no \nevidence in the record to support this argument. \n65 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 66 of 80\nKernan, 971 F.3d 1069, 1077 (2020); Flack v. Wis. Dept. of Health Servs., 328 F. Supp. \n3d 931, 952 (W.D. Wisc. 2018) (recognizing that “heightened scrutiny may be \nappropriate either on the basis of sex discrimination or through recognizing of \ntransgender as a suspect or quasi-suspect class.”)). \n“Statutes that discriminate based on sex must be supported by an ‘exceedingly \npersuasive justification.’ The government meets this burden if it can show that the statute \nis substantially related to a sufficiently important government interest.” Brandt by & \nthrough Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 F.4th 661, 670 (8th Cir. 2022) (quoting United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-33 (1996)). Heightened or intermediate scrutiny imposes a \nburden “rest[ing] entirely on the State” to demonstrate an “exceedingly persuasive” \njustification for the differential treatment. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533. A state “must show \nat least that the [challenged] classification serves important governmental objectives and \nthat the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of \nthose objectives.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). And “[t]he \njustification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to \nlitigation.” Id. \nThe State claims that by banning gender-affirming care the Act advances the \nState’s important governmental interest of protecting children from experimental medical \ntreatment and safeguarding medical ethics. Throughout this litigation, the State has \nattempted to meet their heavy burden by offering the following assertions in support of \nbanning gender-affirming medical care for adolescents: (i) that there is a lack of evidence \nof efficacy of the banned care; (ii) that the banned treatment has risks and side effects; \n(iii) that many patients will desist in their gender incongruence; (iv) that some patients \n66 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 67 of 80\nwill later come to regret having received irreversible treatments; and (v) that treatment is \nbeing provided without appropriate evaluation and informed consent.  The evidence \npresented at trial does not support these assertions. \na.  Efficacy  \nThe evidence at trial showed that the prohibited medical care improves the health \nand well-being of many adolescents with gender dysphoria. Three of Plaintiffs’ experts \nand two Arkansas doctors detailed the significant mental health benefits of gender-\naffirming medical care for adolescents with gender dysphoria which they have observed \nclinically. Drs. Karasic, Turban, and Adkins have collectively treated thousands of \npatients with gender dysphoria and testified about their own clinical experiences \nwitnessing the positive, life-changing impact of gender-affirming medical interventions \non their adolescent patients as well as the comparable experiences of their colleagues \naround the country. (Tr. 67:8-12, ECF No. 219 (Karasic); 233:15-22 (Adkins); Tr. 298:7-\n18, 305:2-19, ECF No. 220 (Turban); Tr. 543:3-544:11, ECF No. 275 (Hutchison), \n606:20-610:1 (Stambough). Drs. Stambough and Hutchison similarly testified about the \nmany positive impacts of gender-affirming medical interventions on the health and well-\nbeing of their adolescent patients in Arkansas. (Tr. 543:3-544:11, ECF No. 275 \n(Hutchison), 606:20-610:1 (Stambough)). The testimony showed that the benefit of this \ncare is long lasting. Id.  \nThe State put forth no evidence contesting the extensive clinical experience of \nPlaintiffs’ witnesses. In fact, the State’s only expert witness to have ever treated patients \nfor gender dysphoria, Dr. Levine, testified that he felt a decision about whether an \nadolescent should pursue hormone therapy should be made by a “team of well-informed \n67 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 68 of 80\ndoctor[s], scientifically well-informed, parents that have a respect for the doctor and have \nmet with the doctor numerous times, and the doctor who has a relationship with the \npatient.” (Tr. 909:7:25, ECF No. 246 (Levine)). He went on the say that “after that patient \nhas had a process of psychotherapy where these matters, their ambivalence, the \nuncertainty, their eating disorders, and their self-harm episodes, et. cetera, have been \nthoroughly explored—if that team of doctors, patient, and parent want to do that \n[hormone therapy] that’s what doctors do. We do that for cancer as well, you know.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs’ experts testified about the body of research demonstrating that the \nbanned medical interventions improve patient health. (Tr. 295:16-18, 298:7-18, 300:24-\n301:17, 302:20-303:8, 303:22-305:1, ECF No. 220 (Turban); 219:68:15-69:14 (Karasic)). \nDr. Turban testified about the sixteen studies conducted in multiple countries over the \npast twenty years that collectively show that use of pubertal suppression and gender-\naffirming hormones to treat adolescents with gender dysphoria improves patient health \nand prevents the worsening of distress upon the onset of puberty. Id. at 295:16-18 \n(Turban). He testified as well that the studies about the efficacy of hormone therapy show \npositive outcomes consistent with dozens of studies about the efficacy of such therapy to \ntreat gender dysphoria in adults. Id. at 302:20-303:21 (Turban).  \nThis expert testimony about positive research and clinical evidence was bolstered \nby the unrebutted testimony of the Parent Plaintiffs who explained how gender-affirming \nmedical care positively transformed the lives of their adolescent children with gender \ndysphoria. For adolescents, like Minor Plaintiffs Parker Saxton, Dylan Brandt, and \nSabrina Jennen, this care allowed them to grow from depressed, anxious, and withdrawn \nyoung people into happy and healthy teenagers who looked forward to their futures.  \n68 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 69 of 80\nThe State offered no evidence to refute the decades of clinical experience \ndemonstrating the efficacy of gender-affirming medical care. Additionally, the State’s \nexperts offered no evidence-based treatment alternatives. When asked at trial what would \nhappen if a law like Act 626 were to go into effect, Dr. Turban explained: \nIt would be emotional to think about. Because the reality is that we frequently in \nclinic have families that are coming to us with these young people who are really \nstruggling with severe anxiety, depression, sometimes suicidal thoughts, \nsometimes their mental health is declining so dramatically that they can’t go to \nschool, and it’s my job to tell families what the evidence-based approaches are to \nhelp their child. So if these treatments were not an option, I’d be left without any \nevidence-based approaches to treat this young person’s gender dysphoria. \n \n(Tr. 326:16-327:5, ECF No. 220 (Turban)). \nThe evidence showed that based on the decades of clinical experience and \nscientific research, it is widely recognized in both the medical and mental health fields—\nincluding by major medical and mental health professional associations—that gender-\naffirming medical care can relieve the clinically significant distress associated with \ngender dysphoria in adolescents.13 The State failed to provide sufficient evidence that the \nbanned treatments are ineffective or experimental. \nb.  Risks and Side Effects \nIt is undisputed that puberty blocking hormones delay the rapid accrual of bone \nmineralization that occurs during puberty. (Tr. 205:16-201:12, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)); \nTr. 390:8-16, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria)). This is a risk for cisgender and transgender \n \n13 The State urges the Court to disregard the major medical organizations’ views about gender-affirming \nmedical care for adolescents with gender dysphoria, claiming they are based on ideology rather than \nscience. To support this claim, they offered the testimony of Professor Mark Regnerus, but his testimony \ndid not offer any support for this assertion. See Pls.’ Proposed FOF ¶ 383. To accept this claim would \nrequire the Court to both credit Professor Regnerus’ testimony and the notion that every major medical \nassociation in the United States is driven by ideology rather than science and patient well-being. There is \nno basis and no evidence supporting such a conspiratorial assessment of all the major medical associations. \n \n69 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 70 of 80\nadolescents. Puberty blocking hormones do not stop bone mineralization. Instead, \nadolescents on these hormones continue to accrue bone mineralization at a prepubertal \nrate. (Tr. 209:2-13, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)). Once puberty blockers are stopped and \npuberty resumes, either the person’s endogenous puberty or an exogenous puberty \nprompted by hormone therapy, the accrual of bone mineralization increases at the usual \npubertal rate. Id. at 209:2-210:1 (Adkins).  \nIt is undisputed that when adolescent birth-assigned females with gender \ndysphoria are treated with testosterone, their fertility can sometimes be impaired. If \ntestosterone follows puberty blockers at certain stages of the adolescent’s development, \nthe adolescent can become infertile. These risks are discussed with patients and parents \nand fertility options are discussed. There are also risks associated with testosterone \ntherapy given to cisgender adolescent males including changes in cholesterol profile and \nblood thickness. However, Dr. Adkins testified that when a doctor monitors treatment to \nensure appropriate therapeutic levels, adverse health effects are rare. Id. at 220:25-221:9 \n(Adkins). \nEstrogen and anti-androgens are used to treat birth-assigned males with gender \ndysphoria. It is undisputed that when estrogen is used to treat birth-assigned males, it can \nsometimes impair their fertility. If estrogen treatment follows puberty blockers at certain \nstages of the adolescent’s development, the adolescent can become infertile. When \nestrogen or anti-androgens are given to birth-assigned males, the hormones can limit the \npatient’s sexual arousal or ability to orgasm. Id. at 229:17-230:2 (Adkins). These risks are \ndiscussed with patients and parents. The risks can be managed by the doctor to preserve \nfertility or treatment can be provided to address a decrease in sexual satisfaction in most \n70 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 71 of 80\ncases. There are also risks for cisgender females from treatment with estrogen or anti-\nandrogens. Again, when a doctor monitors treatment to ensure appropriate therapeutic \nlevels, adverse health effects are rare. \nThe State failed to provide sufficient evidence that Act 626’s ban on transgender \ncare is justified by the risks of the treatment. As stated, the evidence at trial showed the \nrisks associated with gender-affirming care for adolescents are no greater than the risks \nassociated with many other medical treatments that are not prohibited by Act 626. (Tr. \n390, ECF No. 220 (Antommaria); Tr. 212:11-12, ECF No. 219 (Adkins)). The evidence \nshowed that the banned treatments are effective to treat gender dysphoria and the benefits \nof the treatments greatly outweigh the risks. The State failed to meet their burden to show \nthat the risks of gender-affirming care banned by Act 626 substantially outweigh the \nbenefits. \nc.  Desistance and Regret \nThe State argues that minors with gender dysphoria will desist with age. They \ncontend that there is a significant risk of harm to a minor who elects to undergo gender \nhormone therapy or surgery because they will eventually identify with their sex assigned \nat birth and regret the treatment they sought as a minor. The State offered the testimony \nof Dr. Levine to support this argument. The Court found Dr. Levine’s testimony to be \ninconsistent and unreliable in this area. To the contrary, the evidence proved that there is \nbroad consensus in the field that once adolescents reach the early stages of puberty and \nexperience gender dysphoria, it is very unlikely they will subsequently identify as \ncisgender or desist. (Tr. 310:13-25, ECF No. 220 (Turban)). The testimony confirmed \n71 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 72 of 80\nthat for most people gender identity is stable over their lifetime. (Tr. 31, ECF No. 219 \n(Karasic)). \nd.  Proper Evaluation and Informed Consent \nThe State spent a great deal of time at trial arguing that the number of children \nidentifying as transgender has increased in the last decade and researchers theorize that \nthe increase could be due to mental illness, social encouragement, or abuse. The State \nargues that the “affirmative” model of treating gender dysphoria which utilizes puberty \nblockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries allows doctors to “throw caution out the \nwindow.” (Post-Tr. Br., ECF No. 265 at 4). However, there was no evidence that doctors \nin Arkansas negligently prescribe puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones to minors.  \nThe State argues that many doctors do not require mental health counseling before \ntreatment and will let children get hormone therapy and permanently altering surgeries \nupon demand. The evidence at trial did not support the State’s argument. The State’s \nexperts admitted that they have had no contact with any Arkansas doctors or information \nabout how doctors in Arkansas treat minors with gender dysphoria. (Tr. 113:1-12, ECF \nNo. 246 (Levine)). There was no evidence presented that surgeons in Arkansas are \nperforming gender transforming surgeries on minors much less performing surgeries on \ndemand. In fact, the evidence confirmed that doctors in Arkansas do not perform gender \ntransition surgeries on any person under the age of 18, the age which Act 626 targets.  \nThere was testimony that WPATH Standards of Care, which are aligned with the \nACH Gender Clinic protocols, recommend a comprehensive bio-psychosocial assessment \nof adolescent patients who present with gender identity related concerns and seek gender \ntransition care. (Tr. 43:13-47:7, ECF No. 219 (Karasic)). The Standards of Care \n72 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 73 of 80\n“recommend healthcare professionals involve relevant disciplines including mental health \nand medical professionals to reach a decision about whether puberty suppression, \nhormone initiation, or gender-related surgery for gender diverse and transgender \nadolescents are appropriate and remain indicated throughout the course of treatment until \ntransition is made to adult care.” Id. Before initiating gender-affirming medical treatment \nto adolescents, the WPATH Standards of Care state that the patient should have a history \nof gender diversity lasting years and meet the criteria for a gender dysphoria diagnosis. \nId. at 50-51. The diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria includes six months of clinically \nsignificant distress or social or occupational impairment. Id. This six-month period is in \naddition to the years of gender diversity history that the Standards of Care require. Id. \n Dr. Hutchinson testified that while she was the medical director at the Arkansas \nChildren’s Hospital Gender Clinic she always did a full assessment of an adolescent \nseeking care for gender dysphoria. (Tr. 523:10-528:19, ECF No. 275 (Hutchison)). Her \nassessment included family history, physical history, and psychosocial evaluations. Id. \nBefore cross-sex hormone therapy could be prescribed in the Clinic, the adolescent had to \nmeet the criteria for a gender dysphoria diagnosis, meet with a clinical psychologist, have \nongoing therapy with a therapist, show consistent and persistent gender identity in their \naffirmed gender and show mood stability. Id. Dr. Cathey, an Arkansas doctor, testified \nthat she requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before prescribing feminizing or \nmasculinizing hormone therapy to minors (Tr. 754-759, 54-59, ECF No. 224 (Cathey)). \nAfter a diagnosis, she will prescribe hormones to minors aged 16 and older but only with \nparental consent. Id.  \n73 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 74 of 80\nRather than protecting children or safeguarding medical ethics, the evidence \nshowed that the prohibited medical care improves the mental health and well-being of \npatients and that, by prohibiting it, the State undermined the interests it claims to be \nadvancing. Further, the various claims underlying the State’s arguments that the Act \nprotects children and safeguards medical ethics do not explain why only gender-affirming \nmedical care—and all gender-affirming medical care—is singled out for prohibition. The \ntestimony of well-credentialed experts, doctors who provide gender-affirming medical \ncare in Arkansas, and families that rely on that care directly refutes any claim by the State \nthat the Act advances an interest in protecting children. \n  Based on the record, the Court concludes that Act 626 prohibits medical care on \nthe basis of sex and the State has failed to meet its demanding burden of proving the Act \nadvances its articulated interests. The Court finds that Act 626 violates Plaintiffs’ rights \nto equal protection. \nC.  Due Process \nEven if the Court found that Act 626 passed constitutional muster under the Equal \nProtection Clause, it fails under due process analysis. The Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment forbids states to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law....” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. The Clause also includes a \nsubstantive component that “provides heightened protection against government \ninterference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.” Washington v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719-20 (1997). “The liberty interest at issue in this case—the \ninterest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children—is perhaps the \noldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” Troxel v. Granville, \n74 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 75 of 80\n530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000); see also Kanuszewski v. Mich. Dep’t of Health and Human \nServ’s, 927 F.3d 396, 419 (6th Cir. 2019) (“[P]arents’ substantive due process right to \nmake decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children includes the \nright to direct their children’s medical care.”). Parents are presumed to be acting in the \nbest interest of their children. Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602 (1979). \n  As the Court has previously found, the Parent Plaintiffs have a fundamental right \nto seek medical care for their children and, in conjunction with their adolescent child’s \nconsent and their doctor’s recommendation, make a judgment that medical care is \nnecessary. “[T]the Fourteenth Amendment ‘forbids the government to infringe . . . \n‘fundamental’ liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided, unless the \ninfringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.’” Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. at 721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993)). Strict scrutiny is the \nappropriate standard of review for infringement of a fundamental parental right. \nHowever, even under the heightened scrutiny standard, Act 626 fails. \n  The State has a compelling interest in “safeguarding the physical and \npsychological well-being of a minor. . ..” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for \nNorfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982). As explained, the State has failed to present \nevidence that the gender-affirming procedures banned by Act 626 jeopardize the physical \nor psychological well-being of a minor with gender dysphoria. There is no evidence that \nthe Arkansas healthcare community is throwing caution to the wind when treating minors \nwith gender dysphoria.  \nMoreover, the evidence shows that the Arkansas Medical Board has successfully \nnavigated the regulation of the healthcare community in controversial areas such as the \n75 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 76 of 80\nopioid crisis and gastric bypass surgery. The Arkansas Medical Board is the best option \nfor regulating the ethical considerations as well as the duties of the healthcare community \nin circumstances like the treatment of gender dysphoria. Plaintiff Parents’ testimony at \ntrial confirmed that they have made the decision to get gender-affirming care for their \nchildren after discussions with and observations of their child, thorough research, \ncounseling, and consultation with a doctor. They are acting in the best interest of their \nchildren. Act 626 would take away these parents’ fundamental right to provide healthcare \nfor their children and give that right to the Arkansas Legislature.  \nFurther, Act 626’s ban of all gender transition procedures “including without \nlimitation physician's services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, or prescribed \ndrugs related to gender transition” is not narrowly tailored to achieve the State’s \narticulated interests. Though the State applauds the efforts of European countries to \nrestrict gender-affirming care for minors with gender dysphoria, the State’s expert \ntestified that no other country in the world has taken Arkansas’s broad stance. None of \nthese countries have imposed a ban on all gender-affirming care. \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that Act 626 violates the Parent Plaintiffs’ \nrights to substantive due process. \nD. First Amendment \nAct 626 provides that “[a] physician, or other healthcare professional shall not \nrefer any individual under eighteen (18) years of age to any healthcare professional for \ngender transition procedures.” Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-1502(b). Dr. Stambough claims \nthat Act 626 restricts her freedom of speech by barring her from referring her patients to \nother healthcare professionals for gender transition treatment in violation of the First \n76 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 77 of 80\nAmendment. The State argues that the Act targets conduct, not communication, by \nhealthcare professionals. In support, the State cites to the definition of “referral” on \nHealthcare.gov. (Defs.’ Post-Tr. Br., ECF 265 at 25.). The website defines referral as \nfollows:  \nA written order from your primary care doctor or you to see a specialist or get \ncertain medical services. In many Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), \nyou need to get a referral before you can get medical care from anyone except \nyour primary care doctor. If you don’t get a referral first, the plan may not pay for \nthe services.  \n \nhttps://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/referral (last visited May 24, 2023). \nThe State argues that writing an order, or “referring,” a patient to another \nphysician for gender transition procedures amounts to a treatment order. A treatment \norder is professional conduct subject to regulation by the State, even if it incidentally \ninvolves speech. The State argues that the Act’s purpose is to encourage speech in the \nform of psychotherapy for treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nThe Court is not persuaded by these arguments. The Act does not define the word \n“refer.” Prosecutors and the Arkansas State Medical Board are unlikely to rely on the \nHealth Insurance Marketplace’s website when determining whether a healthcare \nprofessional has violated Act 626. Had the Arkansas Legislature intended to bar \nphysicians from writing an order directing a patient to seek gender transition procedures \nfrom another provider it could have included that statement in the Act. See S.B. 184, \nALA. 2022 Reg. Sess. (2022); Eknes-Tucker v. Marshall, 603 F. Supp. 3d 1131, 1149 \n(M.D. Ala. 2022) (Alabama’s transgender healthcare ban legislation prohibits the \n“prescribing or administering” of gender transition treatment which is conduct not \nspeech.).  \n77 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 78 of 80\nAs written, Act 626 clearly regulates speech and not conduct as argued by the \nState. It prevents doctors from informing their patients where gender transition treatment \nmay be available. It effectively bans their ability to speak to patients about these \ntreatments because the physician is not allowed to tell their patient where it is available. \n“[A] State may not, under the guise of prohibiting professional misconduct, ignore \nconstitutional rights.” Nat'l Ass'n for Advancement of Colored People v. Button, 371 U.S. \n415, 439 (1963); see also Nat'l Inst. of Fam. & Life Advocs. v. Becerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, \n2371–72 (2018) (“[T]his Court has not recognized ‘professional speech’ as a separate \ncategory of speech. Speech is not unprotected merely because it is uttered by \n‘professionals.’”). \nAct 626 is a content and viewpoint-based regulation of speech because it restricts \nhealthcare professionals from making referrals for “gender transition procedures” only, \nnot for other purposes. As a content and viewpoint-based regulation, it is “presumptively \nunconstitutional” and is subject to strict scrutiny. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, \n163 (2015).  \nAgain, the State explains that it has a compelling interest in keeping children \naway from gender transition procedures because their efficacy and safety are doubtful. \nThe problem with this argument is that the State has failed to prove that gender-affirming \ncare for minors with gender dysphoria is ineffective or riskier than other medical care \nprovided to minors. The State also contends it has a compelling interest in regulating the \nethics of the medical profession. There was no evidence presented that an Arkansas \nphysician or healthcare provider has been ethically compromised in their treatment of \nadolescents with gender dysphoria or their communication with patients regarding gender \n78 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 79 of 80\ntransitioning procedures. As stated, the Arkansas Medical Board has proven to be an \neffective regulator of Arkansas healthcare professionals in controversial areas of \nmedicine. \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that the State has failed to prove that its \ninterests in the safety of Arkansas adolescents from gender transitioning procedures or \nthe medical community’s ethical decline are compelling, genuine, or even rational. Act \n626 violates Dr. Stambough’s rights under the First Amendment. \nE. Permanent Injunction \nPlaintiffs seek permanent injunctive relief. To obtain a permanent injunction, \nPlaintiffs were required to “show actual success on the merits.” Miller v. Thurston, 967 \nF.3d 727, 735 (8th Cir. 2020). Substantial evidence at trial demonstrated that Act 626 \nviolates Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. Testimony from the Minor Plaintiffs, their \nparents, Dr. Stambough and the experts proved that they would suffer immediate and \nirreparable harm from Act 626 if it were to go into effect. This harm to Plaintiffs and the \npublic interest is outweighed by any potential harm to the State of Arkansas caused by \nthe entry of a permanent injunction. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor these reasons, the Court hereby orders that Defendant Tim Griffin, in his \nofficial capacity as Attorney General of the State of Arkansas, and all those acting in \nconcert with him, including employees, agents, successors in office, and the members of \nthe Arkansas State Medical Board are permanently enjoined from enforcing House Bill \n79 \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 283   Filed 06/20/23   Page 80 of 80\n1570, Act 626 of the 93rd General Assembly of Arkansas, codified at Ark.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  On April 6, 2021, the Arkansas General Assembly passed HB 1570, enacted as Act \n626 (hereafter the \"Health Care Ban\"), overriding Governor Asa Hutchinson's veto of the bill \nwithin 24  hours and banning the provision of medically necessary and potentially lifesaving \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 2 of 47\nhealthcare  to  transgender  adolescents.  The  law  was  passed  over the  sustained  and  robust \nopposition of medical experts in Arkansas and across the country.  The law could be enforced as \nsoon as July 28, 2021.1 \n2.  Since long before the adoption of the Health Care Ban, there has been a well-\nestablished  medical  consensus  that  certain  medical  treatments  are  necessary  to  treat  some \nadolescents  diagnosed  with  gender  dysphoria-a  medical  and  mental  health  condition \ncharacterized by clinically significant distress caused by an incongruence between a person's \ngender identity and the sex they were assigned at birth.  Medical guidelines recognized by all the \nmajor medical  associations provide a framework  for  the  safe  and effective treatment of this \ncondition.  For some adolescent patients with gender dysphoria, puberty-delaying treatment and \nhormone therapy are medically indicated to alleviate severe distress.  Chest reconstruction surgery \nmay be medically necessary for some older adolescents. \n3.  The Health Care Ban, by prohibiting any medical treatment \"related to gender \ntransition,\" denies adolescents medically necessary treatment and prevents parents from obtaining \nmedically necessary care for their children.  It further prohibits doctors from treating their patients \nin accordance with the well-established standards of care or from referring patients to other doctors \nto receive the appropriate care. \nUnder the Arkansas Constitution, Acts of the General Assembly without an emergency \nclause or specified effective date, like HB 1570, become effective ninety (90) days after \nadjournment of the session where enacted. The General Assembly did not adjourn the \n2021 session; instead, the legislature took extended recess under HCR 1015, stating, \n\"should the General Assembly remain in extended recess for longer than ninety (90) \ndays, all acts that do not contain an emergency clause or a specific effective date shall \nbecome effective on the 91st day following April 30, 2021.\"  On May 20, 2021, Attorney \nGeneral Leslie Rutledge issued Opinion No. 2021-029, which opines that \"unless the \nGeneral Assembly reconvenes on or before July 27, 2021, acts with no emergency clause \nor specified effective date become effective on July 28, 2021.\" \n-2-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 3 of 47\n4.  While the Health Care Ban purports to protect young people from alleged risks \nassociated with the prohibited care, all of the medical care prohibited by the Health Care Ban is \npermitted for any reason except to affirm a gender identity that differs from a patient's sex assigned \nat birth. \n5.  After the General Assembly first passed the Health Care Ban on March 29, 2021, \nGovernor Hutchinson vetoed the bill, calling it \"overbroad,\" \"extreme,\" and \"a vast government \noverreach.\"  He said the legislation interfered with \"the guiding hand\" of both parents and the \nhealthcare professionals they have chosen to care for their children.  He also expressed concern \nthat,  if passed, the bill would lead to  significant harm to transgender youth as  cautioned by \nhealthcare experts. \n6.  If the Health Care Ban goes into effect, it will have devastating consequences for \ntransgender youth in Arkansas.  These young people will be unable to obtain medical care that \ntheir doctors and parents agree  they need-and those already receiving care will  have  their \ntreatment  abruptly  halted-which  could  have  serious  and  potentially  life-threatening \nconsequences. For some transgender youth, the prospect of losing this critical medical care, even \nbefore the legislation is in effect, is unbearable.  In the weeks after the bill passed, at least six \ntransgender adolescents in Arkansas attempted suicide. \n7.  Some parents of trans gender children are making plans to move out of state should \nthe law take effect out of fear for their children's health and safety if they are unable to get \nnecessary medical treatment.  They may have to leave their jobs, businesses, extended families, \nand communities to get the treatment their children need.  These families have already lived \nthrough the impact of untreated gender dysphoria on their children and have seen how treatment \nhas enabled them to thrive.  As one father put it, \"We can't go back.\"  But many families do not \n-3-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 4 of 47\nhave the resources to uproot their lives and they are terrified about what will happen to their \nchildren if the law takes effect. \n8.  The Health Care Ban not only threatens the health and well-being of transgender \nyouth in Arkansas, it is also unconstitutional.  It violates the Equal  Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment because it discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status by \nprohibiting certain medical treatments only for transgender patients and only when the care is \n\"related to gender transition.\"  This discrimination cannot be justified under heightened scrutiny \nor any level  of equal  protection  scrutiny.  In  addition,  by preventing parents  from  seeking \nappropriate medical care for their children when the course of treatment is supported by the child \nand their doctor, the Health Care Ban interferes with the right to parental autonomy guaranteed by \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Lastly, the Health Care Ban violates the \nFirst Amendment by prohibiting healthcare providers from referring their patients for medical \ntreatments that are in accordance with the accepted medical standards of care to treat gender \ndysphoria. \nII.

Plaintiff Dr.  Michele  Hutchison  is  a  pediatric  endocrinologist  and  Associate \nProfessor in the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for \nMedical Sciences.  She has been working at the Gender Spectrum Clinic at Arkansas Children's \nHospital (the \"Clinic\") since its inception in February, 2018.  Dr. Hutchison provides gender \naffirming care that would be prohibited by the Health Care Ban.  She is bringing her claims in her \nindividual capacity on behalf of herself and her patients. \n2.  Dr. Kathryn Stambough \n14.  Plaintiff Dr.  Kathryn  Stambough  is  a doctor  in  the  Division of Pediatric and \nAdolescent Gynecology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of \nArkansas for Medical Sciences. Her clinic is part of Arkansas Children's Hospital. Dr. Stambough \nrefers patients at her clinic to other doctors who provide gender-affirming care, which would be \nprohibited by the Health Care Ban.  In addition, Dr. Stambough works at the Gender Spectrum \n-7-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 8 of 47\nClinic one day each month.  When she is at the Clinic, Dr. Stambough provides gender-affirming \ncare that would be prohibited by the Health Care Ban.  She is bringing her claims in her individual \ncapacity on behalf of herself and her patients. \nC.  Defendants \n15.  Defendant Leslie Rutledge is the Attorney General of the State of Arkansas.  The \nAttorney General's offices are located at 323 Center Street, Suite 200, Little Rock, Arkansas. \nUnder the Health Care Ban, Defendant Rutledge is tasked with bringing legal actions to enforce \ncompliance with that law.  Defendant Rutledge is sued in her official capacity. \n16.  Defendant Amy E. Embry is the Executive Director of The Arkansas State Medical \nBoard (the \"Medical Board\").  The Medical Board is an agency of the State of Arkansas with the \npower to license physicians and revoke physicians' licenses, among other things. Under the Health \nCare  Ban,  the  Medical  Board  is  charged  with  disciplining  individuals  within  its  licensing \njurisdiction who violate the provisions of that law.  The Medical Board is located at 1401 West \nCapitol A venue, Suite 340, Little Rock, Arkansas.  Defendant Embry is sued in her official capacity. \n17.  Defendants  Sylvia D.  Simon,  Robert  Breving Jr.,  Veryl  D.  Hodges,  John  H. \nScribner, Elizabeth Anderson, Rhys L. Branman, Edward \"Ward\" Gardner, Rodney Griffin, Betty \nGuhman, Brian T. Hyatt, Timothy C. Paden, Don R. Philips, William L. Rutledge, and David L. \nStaggs (all, together with Defendant Embry, the \"Medical Board Defendants\") are members of the \nMedical Board.  The Medical Board Defendants are sued in their official capacity. \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This action arises in part under the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n19.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Article III of the United States \nConstitution and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1367. \n-8-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 9 of 47\n20.  This Court is authorized to issue a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202. \n21.  Venue in this district is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)(2), because one \nor more of the defendants resides in this district and because a substantial part of the events giving \nrise to the claims occurred in this district. \nIV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Standards of Care for Treating Adolescents with Gender Dysphoria \n22.  Doctors in Arkansas use well-established guidelines to diagnose and treat youth \nwith gender dysphoria. \n23.  \"Gender identity\" refers to a person's internal, innate, and immutable sense of \nbelonging to a particular gender. \n24.  Although the precise origin of gender identity is  unknown,  a person's gender \nidentity is a fundamental aspect of human development.  There is a general medical consensus that \nthere is a significant biological component to gender identity. \n25.  Everyone has a gender identity.  A person's gender identity is durable and cannot \nbe altered through medical intervention. \n26.  A person's gender identity usually matches the sex they were designated at birth \nbased on their external genitalia.  The terms \"sex designated at birth\" or \"sex assigned at birth\" are \nmore precise than the term \"biological sex\" because there are many biological sex characteristics \nand they may not align with each other in a single direction.  For example, some people with \nintersex characteristics may have a chromosomal configuration typically associated with a male \nsex designation but genital characteristics typically associated with a female sex designation.  For \nthese  reasons,  the  Endocrine  Society,  an  international  medical  organization  of over  18,000 \n-9-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 10 of 47\nendocrinology researchers and clinicians, warns practitioners that the terms \"biological sex\" and \n\"biological male or female\" are imprecise and should be avoided. \n27.  Most boys were designated male at birth based on their external genital anatomy, \nand most girls were designated female at birth based on their external genital anatomy.  But \ntransgender children have a gender identity that differs from the sex assigned to them at birth.  A \ntransgender boy is someone who was assigned a female sex at birth but persistently, consistently, \nand insistently identifies as male.  A transgender girl is someone who was assigned a male sex at \nbirth but persistently, consistently, and insistently identifies as female. \n28.  Gender identity is deeply rooted in early life.  Some transgender people become \naware of having a gender identity that does not match their assigned sex early in childhood.  For \nothers, the onset of puberty, and the resulting physical changes in their bodies, leads them to \nrecognize that their gender identity is not aligned with their sex assigned at birth. \n29.  The lack of alignment between one's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth \ncan cause significant distress. \n30.  According the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic & Statistical Manual \nof Mental  Disorders  (\"DSM-V''), \"gender dysphoria\"  is  the diagnostic term  for the  condition \nexperienced by some transgender people of clinically significant distress resulting from the lack of \ncongruence between their gender identity and the sex assigned to them at birth.  In order to be \ndiagnosed with gender dysphoria, the incongruence must have persisted for at least six months and \nbe accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other \nimportant areas of functioning. \n-10-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 11 of 47\n31.  Being transgender is not itself a medical condition to be cured.  But gender dysphoria \nis  a  serious  medical  condition that,  if left  untreated,  can result  in debilitating anxiety,  severe \ndepression, self-harm, and suicide. \n32.  The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (\"WPATH\") and the \nEndocrine Society have published widely accepted standards of care for treating gender dysphoria. \nThe medical treatment for gender dysphoria is to eliminate the clinically significant distress by \nhelping a transgender person live in alignment with their gender identity. This treatment is sometimes \nreferred to  as  \"gender transition,\" \"transition-related care,\" or \"gender-affirming care.\"  These \nstandards of care are recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which agrees that this care \nis safe, effective, and medically necessary treatment for the health and well-being of youth suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria. \n33.  The  precise  treatment  for  gender  dysphoria  depends  upon  each  person's \nindividualized needs, and the medical standards of care differ depending on whether the treatment is \nfor a pre-pubertal child, an adolescent, or an adult. \n34.  Before puberty, gender transition does not include any pharmaceutical or surgical \nintervention and is limited to \"social transition,\" which means allowing a transgender child to live \nand be socially recognized in accordance with their gender identity.  Typically, social transition can \ninclude allowing children to wear clothing, to cut or grow their hair, to use preferred names and \npronouns, and to use restrooms and other sex-separated facilities in line with their gender identity \ninstead of the sex assigned to them at birth. \n35.  Under the WPATH Standards of Care and the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines, \nmedical interventions may become medically necessary and appropriate as transgender youth reach \npuberty.  In providing medical treatments to adolescents, pediatric endocrinologists work in close \n-11-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 12 of 47\nconsultation with qualified mental health professionals experienced in diagnosing and treating gender \ndysphoria. \n36.  For many transgender adolescents, going through puberty in accordance with the sex \nassigned to them at birth can cause extreme distress. Puberty-delaying medication allows transgender \nadolescents to avoid this, therefore minimizing and potentially preventing the heightened gender \ndysphoria and permanent physical changes that puberty would cause. \n37 .  Under the Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines, trans gender adolescents may be \neligible for puberty-delaying treatment if: \n•  A qualified mental health professional has confirmed that: \no  the adolescent has demonstrated a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender \nnonconformity or gender dysphoria (whether suppressed or expressed); \no  gender dysphoria worsened with the onset of puberty; \no  any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere \nwith treatment ( e.g., that may compromise treatment adherence) have been \naddressed,  such that the adolescent's situation and functioning are stable \nenough to start treatment; \no  has sufficient mental capacity to give informed consent to this (reversible) \ntreatment. \n•  And the adolescent: \no  has been informed of the effects and side effects of treatment (including \npotential loss of fertility if the individual subsequently continues with sex \nhormone treatment) and options to preserve fertility; \no  has given informed consent and (particularly when the adolescent has not \nreached the age oflegal medical consent, depending on applicable legislation) \nthe parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to the treatment \nand  are  involved  in  supporting the  adolescent throughout the  treatment \nprocess. \n•  And a pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal assessment: \no  agrees with the indication for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (\"GnRH\") \nagonist treatment; \n-12-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 13 of 47\no  has confirmed that puberty has started in the adolescent; \no  has confirmed that there are no medical contraindications to GnRH agonist \ntreatment. \n38.  Puberty-delaying  treatment  is  reversible.  If  an  adolescent  discontinues  the \nmedication, puberty consistent with their assigned sex will resume. \n39.  For some youth, it may be medically necessary and appropriate to initiate puberty \nconsistent with the young person's gender identity through gender-affirming hormone therapy \n(testosterone for transgender boys, and estrogen and testosterone suppression for transgender \ngirls). \n40.  Under Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines, transgender adolescents may be eligible \nfor gender-affirming hormone therapy if: \n•  A qualified mental health professional has confirmed: \no  the persistence of gender dysphoria; \no  any coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could interfere \nwith treatment (e .g., that may compromise treatment adherence) have been \naddressed, such that the adolescent's environment and functioning are stable \nenough to start sex hormone treatment; \no  the adolescent has sufficient mental capacity to estimate the consequences of \nthis (partly) irreversible treatment, weigh the benefits and risks, and give \ninformed consent to this (partly) irreversible treatment. \n•  And the adolescent: \nhas been informed of the partly irreversible effects and side effects of \n0 \ntreatment  (including potential  loss  of fertility  and  options  to preserve \nfertility); \n0  has given informed consent and (particularly when the adolescent has not \nreached  the  age  of legal  medical  consent,  depending  on  applicable \nlegislation) the parents or other caretakers or guardians have consented to \nthe treatment and are involved in supporting the adolescent throughout the \ntreatment process. \n•  And a pediatric endocrinologist or other clinician experienced in pubertal induction: \n-13-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 14 of 47\no  agrees with the indication for sex hormone treatment; \no  has confirmed that there are no medical contraindications to sex hormone \ntreatment. \n41.  Adolescents who receive gender-affirming hormones after having received puberty-\ndelaying treatment never go through puberty in accordance with the sex assigned to them at birth and, \ninstead, go through puberty that matches their gender identity. \n42.  Pre-pubertal boys  and girls  are  indistinguishable  with respect to  secondary sex \ncharacteristics.  If a pre-pubertal child receives puberty-delaying treatment, they will never develop \nthe secondary sex characteristics of the sex assigned to them at birth, and when they are provided \nhormones in accordance with their gender identity,  they will  develop  only the  secondary sex \ncharacteristics that match their gender identity. \n43.  For example, transgender boys treated with puberty-delaying medication and then \ngender-affirming hormones, will receive the same amount of testosterone during puberty that non \ntransgender boys generate with their gonads or testes.  They will develop the phenotypic features of \nnon-transgender boys such as muscle mass, fat distribution, facial and body hair, and lower vocal \npitch.  Likewise,  transgender girls treated with puberty-delaying medication and then gender \naffirming hormones, will receive the same amount of estrogen during puberty that non-transgender \ngirls generate endogenously.  They will develop the same muscle mass, fat distribution, skin and \nfemale hair patterns, and breasts typically associated with non-transgender girls. \n44.  Adolescents who first receive treatment later in puberty and are only treated with \ngender-affirming hormone therapy (and not puberty-delaying treatment) also go through a puberty \nconsistent with their gender identity. However, they will have undergone physical changes associated \nwith their endogenous puberty that may not be wholly reversed by hormone therapy. \n-14-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 15 of 47\n45.  Under the WPATH standards of care, transgender young people may also receive \nmedically necessary chest reconstructive surgeries before the age of majority, provided the young \nperson has lived in their affirmed gender for a significant period of time.  Genital surgery is not \nrecommended until patients reach the age of majority. \n46.  Medical treatment recommended for and provided to transgender adolescents with \ngender dysphoria can substantially reduce lifelong gender dysphoria and can eliminate the medical \nneed for surgery later in life. \n47.  Providing gender-affirming medical care can be lifesaving treatment and can change \nthe short- and long-term health outcomes for transgender youth. \nB.  The General Assembly's Passage of the Health Care Ban \n48.  On March 29, 2021, the Arkansas General Assembly passed the Health Care Ban, \nprohibiting healthcare professionals from providing \"gender transition procedures\" to anyone \nunder 18 or \"refer[ ring]\" anyone under 18 to any healthcare professional for such procedures. The \nlaw stipulates that healthcare professionals who provide or refer minor patients for such care are \nsubject to discipline for unprofessional conduct by the appropriate licensing entity or disciplinary \nreview board, and may be sued by the Attorney General or private parties.  The Health Care Ban \nalso  prohibits  coverage  of gender transition procedures  for  minors  by Medicaid  or private \ninsurance. \n49.  The General Assembly titled the Health Care Ban the \"Save Adolescents from \nExperimentation (SAFE) Act,\" despite the fact that the banned medical treatment is part of the \nwell-established standards of care for the treatment of gender dysphoria in adolescents. \n50.  In passing the law, the General Assembly ignored testimony from Arkansas doctors \nabout  the  lifesaving benefits  of gender-affirming care  to  their transgender patients  and the \nunavoidable grave harm to the health and well-being of transgender youth if they are prohibited \n-15-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 16 of 47\nfrom receiving this care.  This included testimony in the Senate that after the Health Care Ban \npassed the House, in just one week, multiple transgender youth were admitted to the emergency \nroom because of an attempted suicide. \n51.  Not a single doctor with experience treating transgender youth testified in support \nof the bill. \n52.  The General Assembly ignored the testimony of transgender people who shared \ntheir painful experiences of depression and suicide attempts prior to receiving treatment for their \ngender dysphoria. \n53.  The General Assembly ignored the testimony of parents pleading for it not to risk \ntheir children's health and survival by stripping them of the medical care that has enabled them to \nthrive. \n54.  Not only did the  General  Assembly ignore  established medical  standards by \npassing the Health Care Ban, the majority of both chambers passed resolutions expressing their \nview that \"gender reassignment medical treatments\" are not \"natural.\"  HR 1018, SR 7. \n55.  Some members of the General Assembly further expressed their personal beliefs in \nopposition to gender-affirming care that had nothing to do with the purported medical concerns \nenumerated in the Health Care Ban's legislative findings.  Rep. Bentley, for example, stated that \n\"Father God, our Creator, has some very important things that he would like to say about [the \nHealth Care Ban],\" and that it is \"impossible to govern the world without God and the Bible.\" \nRep. Bentley went on to quote Biblical passages in support of the bill, including \"a woman shall \nnot wear anything that pertains to a man, nor a man put on a woman's garments, for all who do so \nare an abomination to the Lord your God.\"  Rep. Wooten, when addressing the bill, stated that \n-16-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 17 of 47\n\"God made you like you are,\" and \"this nation is based on God's word.\"  Rep. Wooten compared \ntransgender youth to a child who \"comes to you and says, 'I wanna be a cow.\"' \n56.  On April 5, 2021, Governor Hutchinson vetoed the Health Care Ban \"because it \ncreates new standards of legislative interference with physicians and parents as they deal with \nsome of the most complex and sensitive matters concerning our youths.\"  Governor Hutchinson \nexplained that \"[the Health Care Ban] puts the state as the definitive oracle of medical care, \noverriding parents, patients and healthcare experts\" which \"would be-and is-a vast government \noverreach.\" Governor Hutchinson further noted that \"[t]he leading Arkansas medical associations, \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics and medical experts across the country all oppose this law\" \nbecause \"denying best practice medical care to transgender youth can lead to significant harm to \nthe young person-from suicidal tendencies and social isolation to increased drug use.\" \n57.  Within 24 hours, with a simple majority vote, the General Assembly overrode the \nGovernor's veto and the Health Care Ban passed into law.  Only one senator was allowed to speak \nin support of the Governor's veto before debate was terminated, over objection, by a motion for \nimmediate consideration, and the Senate voted to override the veto. \n58.  The  Health Care  Ban was part of a barrage of bills in the  Arkansas General \nAssembly targeting transgender people during the 2021 legislative session. \n59.  SB 347 would have made it a felony for a healthcare provider to provide \"gender \ntransition services\" to anyone under 18 years of age. \n60.  There were two bills and a proposed constitutional amendment to ban transgender \nstudents from participating in school sports.  Both bills passed and were signed into law.  See \nSB 354 (sports ban which passed and is now Act 461), SB 450 (additional sports ban now Act \n953). \n-17-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 18 of 47\n61.  Another bill-HB 1749-would have provided that employees of public schools \nand colleges are not \"required to use a pronoun, title, or other word to identify a  ... student as \nmale or female that is inconsistent with the  ... student's biological sex.\" \n62.  There were also bills aimed at shielding students from hearing about transgender \npeople.  SB 389, which was enacted as Act 552, provides that parents be given notice and a right \nto opt their children out of any curriculum or school materials related to sexual orientation or \ngender identity (as well as sex education).  Moreover, SR 7 included a provision that \"every child \ndeserves an education ... free of ... politicized ideas about sexual orientation and gender identity.\" \n63.  Other bills would have barred transgender people from using restrooms or other \nfacilities that accord with their gender identity in schools and other public buildings. See HB 1882, \nHB 1905, and HB 1951. \n64.  The General Assembly's passage of the Health Care Ban had nothing to do with \nprotecting children and everything to do with expressing disapproval of trans gender people. \nC.  The Impact of the Health Care Ban on Plaintiffs \n1.  The Minor Plaintiffs and Their Families \n(1)  The Brandt Family \n65.  Dylan Brandt is about to finish his freshman year of high school, where his favorite \nsubject is psychology.  Outside school, he likes spending time on TikTok, a social media platform, \nwhere he makes short videos lip-synching to songs and shares motivational sentiments. \n66.  Dylan is transgender.  When he was born, he was designated as female on his birth \ncertificate but his gender identity is male. \n67.  Dylan knew from a young age that he did not feel comfortable with his gender.  In \nseventh grade he cut his hair short and started exclusively dressing in gender-neutral clothing.  By \nthe end of seventh grade, Dylan knew he was a boy and came out to his mother as transgender. \n-18-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 19 of 47\nDylan started his social transition that summer.  He chose the name Dylan and started eighth grade \nwith his new name and using male pronouns.  Since then, everyone who knows the Brandts in \nGreenwood recognizes Dylan as the boy he is. \n68.  Although Joanna, Dylan's mother, was initially surprised when Dylan told her he \nis a boy, it made sense to her upon reflection.  Dylan had \"rejected all things feminine\" from the \nmoment he could make decisions about his life.  He had also been experiencing depression as well \nas anxiety in social situations. \n69.  Joanna consulted Dylan's pediatrician about his realization that he was transgender \nand he was referred to the Gender Spectrum Clinic, where he had his first visit in January 2020. \nDuring that visit, he was diagnosed with gender dysphoria.  Dylan began receiving Depo-Provera \nto stop menstruation. \n70.  In  August  2020,  Dylan  began  treatment  with  testosterone,  which  has  been \ntransformative for him.  He has become a happy, confident teenager. He embraces social situations \nthat he would have avoided in the past.  Dylan's depression and anxiety substantially decreased. \nAs a result of the hormone therapy, Dylan's voice has dropped, he started growing facial hair, and \nhis body started to change in ways typical of a male puberty.  These changes have caused Dylan \nto feel more comfortable in his own skin.  According to Joanna, Dylan's \"eyes light up\" when \npeople recognize and affirm his male gender. Dylan's social transition and medical treatment have \nallowed him to be affirmed in all aspects of his life. \n71.  Dylan's name was legally changed in August 2020, and his birth certificate was \nupdated to reflect the legal name change. \n72.  The prospect of losing access to gender-affirming medical care has caused both \nDylan and Joanna tremendous stress.  Dylan has been on hormone therapy for over nine months. \n-19-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 20 of 47\nThe Brandts were informed at the inception of his treatment that abruptly stopping hormone \ntherapy would be detrimental to Dylan's health. \n73.  Joanna is also concerned about her son's mental health should his treatment be cut \noff.  Joanna fears Dylan will lose the happiness and self-confidence that he has experienced \nbecause of treatment, and is worried that Dylan's depression will return if his care is cut off and \nhis body begins to undergo permanent changes from the initiation of his endogenous puberty. \n74.  The Brandts have deep ties to Greenwood.  They have a community of friends and \nfamily there.  Joanna owns her home and a business.  Because she fears for her son's safety and \nwell-being should his healthcare be cut off, to ensure that Dylan can continue his treatment, Joanna \nis considering moving to another state if the Health Care Ban goes into effect. \n(2)  The Jennen Family \n75.  Sabrina Jennen is a high school sophomore and a dedicated student who made it to \nthe national championships for Quiz Bowl, an academic trivia competition.  Sabrina plays violin \nand acoustic guitar, earned a black belt in Taekwondo, and enjoys gaming with her friends.  After \nhigh school, Sabrina plans to attend college to study medical or environmental sciences. \n76.  Sabrina is transgender.  When she was born, she was designated as male on her \nbirth certificate but her gender identity is female. \n77.  Sabrina began to realize her gender identity in late 2019 and came out to her family \nin July 2020.  Lacey and Aaron, Sabrina's parents, found a therapist for Sabrina, who diagnosed \nher with gender dysphoria. \n78.  Since coming out to her family and friends, Sabrina started using female pronouns, \nwearing feminine clothing, and growing her hair.  Sabrina plans to legally change her name this \nsummer so that it will appear on her driver's license when she is old enough to get one. \n-20-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 21 of 47\n79.  In  or around January 2021,  with her parents'  support,  Sabrina began gender-\naffirming hormone therapy.  She was prescribed a testosterone suppressant and estrogen to initiate \npuberty consistent with her gender identity.  The treatment has been life-changing for her.  Before \ntreatment, Sabrina could not see a future for herself.  She experienced depression, struggled to \nsleep, and engaged in self-harm.  There were times her parents were worried about her being left \nalone.  Since starting hormone therapy, Sabrina has become genuinely happy and confident for the \nfirst time since she can remember.  Sabrina's depression has subsided; she has not engaged in self \nharm and she has become more engaged with her family. \n80.  The prospect oflosing access to her medical care causes Sabrina and her parents to \nfeel extremely anxious and terrifies them.  If her treatment is stopped, Sabrina worries that the \ndysphoria, depression, and anxiety will recur.  Her parents fear for her survival if the medical \ntreatment that has sustained her is cut off. They cannot bear to lose the happy and thriving daughter \nthat Sabrina has become, nor can they return to constant concern over her safety.  As Aaron put it, \n\"We can't go back.\" \n81.  The Jennens love their Fayetteville community.  Sabrina has a robust network of \nfriends, family, educators, and a church community that supports her that would be difficult, if not \nimpossible,  to  replace.  Sabrina's  sisters  are  also  deeply  connected  to  their  school  and \ncommunity-one is on her school cheerleading squad and competes on the track team and in Quiz \nBowl competitions; the other takes ice skating lessons and loves school and the friends she has \nmade there.  Lacey and Aaron are lifelong residents of Arkansas, and graduates of the University \nof Arkansas at Fayetteville.  Lacey is engaged with her local church community and serves on the \nUrban Forestry Board for the City of Fayetteville.  Aaron's job as a government lawyer is based \n-21-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 22 of 47\nin Fayetteville.  Lacey's and Aaron's parents and several of their siblings and their families live \nclose by in Northwest Arkansas.  All of their extended family live in Arkansas. \n82.  Lacey and Aaron want to continue to raise their children in Fayetteville and do not \nwant to leave, but if the Health Care Ban takes effect, they understand that they might have to \nleave to keep Sabrina healthy and safe. \n(3)  The Dennis Family \n83.  Brooke Dennis is in third grade and loves to read and write in her virtual diary.  She \ntakes gymnastics and wants to be a gymnast when she grows up.  Brooke likes jumping on the \ntrampoline in her backyard and can do backward somersaults. \n84.  Brooke is transgender.  When Brooke was born, she was designated as male on her \nbirth certificate, but her gender identity is female. \n85.  Although Amanda and Shayne, Brooke's parents, did not discuss Brooke's female \ngender with her until last year, as Amanda describes it, \"Brooke always knew who she was.\" From \nthe time she was 2 years old, Brooke gravitated towards all traditionally feminine activities. \nBrooke would often put a shirt on her head to create long \"hair\" for herself, and around the \nholidays, Amanda and Shayne could never keep the Christmas tree skirt on the tree because Brooke \nwould take it off and wear it.  Brooke's parents were buying her traditionally boys' clothes, but \nwhen she was 4 years old, her grandma bought her colorful sneakers from the girls' section of the \nstore.  From then on, Brooke chose to wear only traditionally feminine clothing. \n86.  It is confusing for  Brooke that others have not always recognized her as she \nrecognizes herself, and it causes her extreme distress.  For example, one Halloween, when Brooke \nwas in second grade, Amanda and Shayne took Brooke to the store and told her she could choose \na costume, but Brooke was paralyzed by anxiety.  Brooke knew what she wanted-the costumes \n-22-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 23 of 47\nin the girls' section-but she was fearful of what people would say if she picked one of the \ncostumes designated for girls.  The situation was even more difficult at school.  Brooke felt \ndistressed when the teacher would line up the boys and the girls for bathroom breaks and she would \nbe asked what she was doing in the boys' restroom, and when Brooke's classmates would debate \nwhether she is a boy or a girl.  Brooke frequently came home from school crying and started to act \nout.  She started seeing the school counselor regularly in the 2019-20 school year. \n87.  In April 2020, a photographer came to the house to take family portraits.  During \nthe photoshoot, the photographer used female pronouns with Brooke, and Amanda and Shayne \nnoticed that Brooke did not correct the photographer. After the photo shoot, Amanda asked Brooke \nhow that made her feel.  Brooke told her that she liked it and would prefer if people used female \npronouns.  Her parents told her that would be fine, and Brooke declared, \"I am Brooke and I'm a \nshe.\"  As Shayne put it, \"It was as if a cloud lifted and the smile came back.\" \n88.  Since then, she is known as Brooke and is referred to by female pronouns at home, \nby her grandparents, at school, and in the community.  Brooke has returned to being the happy, \nbright-eyed child she used to be.  Amanda and Shayne were relieved that Brooke's distress was \nbehind her and their child was once again flourishing. \n89.  After the conversation about pronouns last April, Amanda and Shayne had Brooke \nbegin therapy with a counselor experienced with youth experiencing an incongruence between \ntheir gender and assigned sex at birth.  The counselor diagnosed Brooke with gender dysphoria in \nJune 2020, and referred the family to the Gender Spectrum Clinic at Arkansas Children's Hospital. \n90.  Brooke and her parents went to the Clinic in October 2020.  They were provided \ninformation about gender dysphoria and the standards of care for treatment.  The doctor told \nAmanda and Shayne to closely watch Brooke for signs of puberty, and advised that puberty-\n-23-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 24 of 47\ndelaying treatment could begin at the onset of puberty.  Brooke and her parents will have regular \ncheck-in appointments with the Clinic to monitor her development. \n91.  At 9 years of age, puberty could begin for Brooke at any time.  Brooke is already \nanxious about the prospect of going through a typical male puberty.  Brooke openly worries about \nhow her body is different than the girls at school.  Brooke has observed the changes her older \nbrother is going through and recently cried and told her mom that she didn't want to get an Adam's \napple. \n92.  Because Brooke is already so anxious about puberty, when Brooke starts puberty \nAmanda and Shayne plan to start her on puberty-delaying treatment, which her doctors confirm \nwould be medically indicated.  They feel this is critical to prevent the distress of going through a \ntypical male puberty and to give the family time to assess whether gender-affirming hormone \ntherapy will be medically necessary to keep Brooke healthy. \n93.  Amanda and Shayne are worried about not being able to obtain puberty-delaying \ntreatment for Brooke when her endogenous puberty begins.  In the short-term, Amanda and Shayne \nhave explored their options for flying out-of-state for treatment.  However, this is not a sustainable \noption financially. Further, the Health Care Ban would prevent Brooke's physicians from referring \nher to a doctor in a state where gender-affirming care is not prohibited. \n94.  Amanda and Shayne's only other option is to move out-of-state, and they will do \nso if necessary to get the treatment Brooke needs.  But moving would impose significant hardship \non the Dennis family.  They have all developed close friendships in the community and the \nchildren's schools, and Amanda's job in leadership development at Walmart, is in Bentonville. \nThey would also be moving away from Shayne's elderly parents for whom they provide supportive \n-24-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 25 of 47\ncare.  Amanda and Shayne will do what is necessary to protect Brooke's health and well-being, \nbut they believe that they should not be forced to leave their state to do so. \n(4)  The Saxton Family \n95.  Parker Saxton is a sophomore in high school.  Parker sings in the school choir and \nis learning how to play the guitar. \n96.  Parker is transgender.  When he was born, he was designated as female on his birth \ncertificate but his gender identity is male. \n97.  When Parker was around 13 years old, he came out to his father as trans gender in \na letter.  Parker asked his dad to refer to him by male pronouns and to call him by a typically male \nversion of his birth name.  He later chose the name Parker.  Donnie was not surprised when he \nreceived the letter.  Parker had already taken steps to change his appearance-he had cut his hair \nshort when he was 11 years old, and, starting in the seventh grade, dressed exclusively in clothes \ntraditionally viewed as masculine.  Donnie could see that Parker was uncomfortable in his body \nParker had been struggling since pre-school when he would tell Donnie he did not want to be a \ngirl, and, for as long as Donnie can remember, Parker experienced debilitating anxiety about \nhaving to use public restrooms. As Parker started puberty, it distressed him seeing his body change \nin ways that felt even more divergent from his gender identity. \n98.  Donnie has not always understood what it means to be transgender and did not \nalways support transgender rights.  But as Donnie watched Parker suffer, and as he started to learn \nmore and understand Parker's feelings, his views shifted.  As Donnie put it, \"I wish that I could \nsay that my child has spent their entire life being comfortable in their skin, but that's just not true \nfor Parker.\"  It took Donnie some time to get used to using male pronouns with Parker.  But now \n-25-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 26 of 47\nthey flow easily for him as he sees Parker as \"my little dude.\"  Donnie is proud and supportive of \nhis son. \n99.  After Parker came out as transgender, he took further steps to socially transition. \nHe started introducing himself with a male name and asked that he be referred to by male pronouns. \nParker has  gradually come  out as  transgender to  his  school  choir community.  At a  choir \nperformance, he wore a tuxedo. \n100.  Though taking steps to socially transition helped Parker feel more like himself, he \ncontinued to struggle with gender dysphoria.  Parker began wearing four or five sports bras at a \ntime in an effort to change the physical appearance of his body; he feels uncomfortable getting out \nof the shower and viewing himself in a mirror, and he refuses to participate in activities that would \nrequire him to wear a bathing suit.  As Donnie put it, Parker ''just wants to look in the mirror and \nsee the person that he is on the inside staring back at him so that he can go about his day.\" \n101.  Parker asked Donnie to take him to receive medical care to change his physical \nappearance to match his male gender.  In 2019, Donnie took Parker to the Gender Spectrum Clinic. \nThere, Parker was diagnosed with gender dysphoria.  One of the first steps Parker's doctors \nrecommended was that he be treated with Depo-Provera to stop menstruation.  Parker has been \ngetting that treatment since the fall of 2019. \n102.  Parker's mental health greatly improved after he started receiving healthcare to treat \nhis gender dysphoria.  As a result, he was able to stop taking the Zoloft that he had been taking to \nmanage his anxiety and depression. \n103.  Because Parker responded so well to receiving this treatment, and because his \nunderstanding of his male gender has been persistent and consistent, Parker's doctor agreed with \n-26-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 27 of 47\nParker and Donnie that Parker would benefit from starting testosterone.  Parker is scheduled to \nbegin receiving testosterone injections at the end of this month. \n104.  After making great strides as a result of his treatment, Parker's anxiety worsened \nwhen he learned about the General Assembly's effort to pass the Health Care Ban, and he had to \nresume taking medication for anxiety.  The passage of the Health Care Ban was devastating to \nhim.  Donnie began sleeping on the couch close to Parker's bedroom because Parker's sleep has \nbeen disturbed, and Donnie wants to be available to provide emotional support in the event he \nneeds it.  Parker and Donnie worry about the physical and mental health consequences ofbeginning \ntestosterone and then having to stop.  But not taking testosterone is not an option given Parker's \nsevere dysphoria. \n105.  If the Health Care Ban goes into effect, the Saxtons would explore leaving the state \nso that Parker can receive the treatment that he, his father, and his doctors all agree is necessary. \nBut this would be difficult for the family.  Donnie, who is a plumber, has a business in Conway. \nMoving would jeopardize the family's financial stability.  It would also separate the family from \nDonnie's parents-with whom they have a close, supportive relationship--and other relatives. \nThe Saxton family has been part of their community all of their lives.  Donnie feels that because \neveryone knows Parker, he is safe there, and Donnie worries about having to go elsewhere. Donnie \nthinks it is wrong that the General Assembly is making it so hard for him to take care of his son. \n2.  Doctor Plaintiffs \n(1)  Dr. Michele Hutchison \n106.  Dr.  Hutchison  graduated  from  medical  school  at  the  University  of Texas \nSouthwestern Medical  School in  1999.  Following medical school,  Dr.  Hutchison completed \n-27-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 28 of 47\nresidency and fellowship programs in Endocrinology at the University of Texas Southwestern \nMedical School in 2002 and 2004, respectively. \n107.  Dr.  Hutchison  is  a  pediatric  endocrinologist  and  Associate  Professor  in  the \nDepartment of Pediatrics, College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, \nwhere she treats youth with a variety of endocrine conditions.  Since 2018, she has also been \ntreating patients at the Arkansas Children's Hospital's Gender Spectrum Clinic, which provides \nhealthcare to transgender youth with gender dysphoria. \n108.  The Clinic treats patients in accordance with the standards of care developed by \nWP ATH and the Endocrine Society.  The Clinic has an interdisciplinary team, including mental \nhealth providers, to ensure each child receives appropriate and necessary care. \n109.  Dr. Hutchison has treated about 200 youth at the Clinic since its opening.  There \nare around 160 patients currently under the Clinic's care. \n110.  At the Clinic, Dr. Hutchison provides puberty-delaying treatment for trans gender \npatients with gender dysphoria at the onset of puberty when medically indicated.  This treatment \npauses puberty and provides the patient and their family more time to determine the long-term \ncourse of treatment.  Such treatment also prevents patients from suffering the severe emotional \nand physical consequences of going through puberty that does not match their gender identity. \n111.  For  patients  whose  gender  identity  has  been  persistent  and  consistent,  Dr. \nHutchison will explore gender-affirming hormone therapy (e strogen and testosterone suppression \nfor transgender girls; testosterone for transgender boys) with patients and their families, beginning \naround the age of 14, and initiate such treatment if medically indicated.  There are no medical \ntreatments indicated or provided for pre-pubertal children with gender dysphoria. \n-28-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 29 of 47\n112.  The same treatments Dr.  Hutchison provides to her transgender patients at the \nClinic-puberty-delaying medication, testosterone, estrogen, and testosterone suppressants-she \nalso provides to non-transgender patients.  In her general pediatric endocrinology practice, Dr. \nHutchison provides  puberty-delaying treatment  to  non-transgender  children  with  precocious \npuberty.  She provides testosterone to non-transgender boys with delayed puberty or who have \ninsufficient testosterone for a variety of reasons.  Dr. Hutchison provides estrogen to treat non \ntransgender girls with primary ovarian insufficiency or Turner's Syndrome.  And she provides \ntestosterone suppressants to treat non-transgender girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome.  If the \nHealth Care Ban takes effect, Dr. Hutchison will be prohibited from providing these treatments to \nher transgender patients because they relate to \"gender transition,\" but she will be able to continue \nproviding the same treatments to her non-transgender patients to help bring their bodies into \nalignment with their gender. \n113.  When Clinic patients inform Dr. Hutchison that they are moving out of state, she \nwill provide them information about clinics in their new state that provide gender-affirming \nmedical care for transgender adolescents.  Dr. Hutchison considers it part of her obligation to care \nfor her patients to help them find the care they need if she is unable to continue providing such \ncare. \n114.  Given the administrative and civil penalties attached to the Health Care Ban, if it \ntakes effect, Dr. Hutchison will not be able to treat her transgender patients with gender dysphoria \nin accordance with the accepted standards of care.  If she were to follow the medically indicated \nprotocols for treating gender dysphoria, she would face adverse licensing action or other judicial \nor administrative consequences.  Moreover, Dr. Hutchison is concerned that if the Health Care \nBan goes into effect, the Gender Spectrum Clinic might have to close. \n-29-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 30 of 47\n115.  Dr. Hutchison knows from personal experience in treating hundreds of adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria that the Health Care Ban, if permitted to take effect, will significantly and \nseverely compromise the health of her patients. As Dr. Hutchison testified before the Senate Public \nHealth and Labor Committee on March 22, 2021, she \"had multiple kids in [the] emergency room \nbecause of an attempted suicide\" after the Health Care Ban passed out of the House.  After the law \nwas passed, her office received calls from numerous families panicking because their children \nwere expressing suicidal thoughts related to the prospect of losing the healthcare they rely on for \ntheir well-being. \n116.  Being forced to deny her patients medically necessary care that can be lifesaving \nfor some patients violates the tenets of Dr.  Hutchison's profession by leaving them to suffer \nneedless pain. \n117.  Dr. Hutchison has grave concerns about her patients' ability to survive, much less \nthrive, if the Health Care Ban takes effect. \n118.  Dr. Hutchison is bringing her claims in her individual capacity on behalf of herself \nand her patients. \n(2)  Dr. Kathryn Stambough \n119.  Dr. Stambough graduated from medical school in 2011 and completed a residency \nin Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2015 at Washington University in Saint Louis.  She completed a \nfellowship at Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children's Hospital that focused on Pediatric and \nAdolescent Gynecology.  During her residency and fellowship programs, Dr. Stambough trained \nin the provision of hormone therapy to treat various conditions, including gender dysphoria. \n120.  Dr.  Stambough is a pediatric and adolescent gynecologist at the University of \nArkansas for Medical Sciences.  For the past year, Dr. Stambough has also been attending one day \n-30-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 31 of 47\nper month at the Gender Spectrum Clinic.  As part of her work at the Clinic, Dr. Stambough \nprovides gender-affirming hormone therapy when medically indicated for patients with gender \ndysphoria diagnoses beginning around the age of 14. \n121.  The same treatments Dr.  Stambough provides to her transgender patients at the \nClinic, she also provides to non-transgender patients.  In her pediatric gynecology practice, Dr. \nStambough provides estrogen to non-transgender girls for a range of conditions, such as primary \novarian insufficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and Turner's Syndrome.  Dr. Stambough \nalso prescribes puberty-delaying medication for non-transgender patients undergoing precocious \npuberty.  She uses that same medication-GnRH agonist-to treat other conditions, including \nendometriosis.  In addition, Dr. Stambough provides other forms of hormone therapy to treat \npolycystic ovarian syndrome; menstrual issues including painful, irregular or heavy periods; and \nfor menstrual suppression for patients with many conditions including cancer and spinal cord \ndisorders, as well as transgender boys with gender dysphoria. \n122.  When Dr. Stambough sees patients in her gynecology practice who present signs \nof gender dysphoria, she refers them to the Gender Spectrum Clinic.  Her ability to make these \nreferrals is essential for her to connect her patients with appropriate and necessary care. \n123.  Given  the  penalties  attached  to  the  Health  Care  Ban,  if it  takes  effect,  Dr. \nStambough will not be able to provide gender-affirming medical care to her patients in accordance \nwith the accepted standards of care.  Nor will she be permitted to refer patients in her pediatric \ngynecology practice for such care.  If she were to do so, she would face adverse licensing action \nor other judicial or administrative consequences.  Moreover, Dr. Stambough is concerned that if \nthe Health Care Ban goes into effect, the Gender Spectrum Clinic might have to close. \n-31-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 32 of 47\n124.  Being  forced  to  withhold  referrals  from  patients  at  her pediatric  gynecology \npractice, and to deny her patients at the Clinic medically necessary care that can be lifesaving for \nsome patients, violates the tenets of Dr. Stambough's profession by leaving her patients to suffer \nneedless pain. \n125.  Dr.  Stambough worries greatly about the impact on her patients if they cannot \naccess the medically necessary and lifesaving treatment prohibited by the Health Care Ban. \n126.  Dr. Stambough is bringing her claims in her individual capacity on behalf of herself \nand her patients. \nV.  THERE ARE NO LEGITIMATE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE HEALTH CARE \nBAN \n127.  The  Health Care  Ban establishes a complete ban on well-established medical \ntreatments for minors when, and only when, they are provided to transgender youth for the purpose \nof \"assisting an individual with a gender transition.\" \n128.  In  relevant  part,  the  Health  Care  Ban  provides  that  \"[a]  physician  or  other \nhealthcare professional shall not provide gender transition procedures to any individual under \neighteen (18) years of age.\"  HB  1570 § 3, 20-9-1502(a).  The Health Care Ban also prohibits \nMedicaid or private insurance coverage for minors receiving such care.  HB  1570 § 4, 23-79-\n164(b). \n129.  The Health Care Ban defines \"gender transition\" as \"the process in which a person \ngoes from identifying with and living as a gender that corresponds to his or her biological sex to \nidentifying with and living as a gender different from his or her biological sex, and may involve \nsocial, legal, or physical changes.\"  HB 1570 §3, 20-9-1501(5). \n130.  The \"gender transition procedures\" prohibited by the  law are defined as \"any \nmedical or surgical service ... related to gender transition that seeks to ... [a]lter or remove \n-32-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 33 of 47\nphysical or anatomical characteristics or features that are typical for the individual's biological \nsex\" or \"[i]nstill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex different \nfrom the individual's biological sex, including without limitation medical services that provide \npuberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, or other mechanisms to promote the development of \nfeminizing or masculinizing features in the opposite biological sex, or genital or nongenital gender \nreassignment  surgery  performed  for  the  purpose  of assisting  an  individual  with  a  gender \ntransition.\"  HB 1570 §3, 20-9-1501(6). \n131.  While the Health Care Ban prohibits the use of well-established treatments for \ngender dysphoria in trans gender adolescents-including puberty-delaying drugs, hormone therapy \n(testosterone for transgender boys, and estrogen and testosterone suppressants for transgender \ngirls), and chest surgery-because these treatments are provided for the purpose of assisting \n\"gender transition,\" it permits the use of these same treatments for any other purpose. \n132.  The puberty-delaying drugs proscribed by the Health Care Ban for the treatment of \ngender dysphoria  because they assist  with \"gender transition\"  are  the  same  drugs  that  are \ncommonly used to treat central precocious puberty.  Central precocious puberty is the premature \ninitiation of puberty-before 8 years of age in people assigned female at birth and before 9 years \nof age  in people  assigned  male-by the  central  nervous  system.  When  untreated,  central \nprecocious puberty can lead to impairment of final adult height as well as antisocial behavior and \nlower academic achievement. The Health Care Ban permits puberty-delaying treatment for central \nprecocious puberty because it is not provided for purposes of assisting with \"gender transition\"; \nthat is, it is not prescribed to affirm a person's gender identity different from their sex assigned at \nbirth. \n-33-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 34 of 47\n133.  The Health Care Ban prohibits hormone therapy when the treatment is used to assist \nwith \"gender transition,\" but the same hormone therapy is permitted when prescribed to non \ntransgender patients to help bring their bodies into alignment with their gender.  For example, non \ntransgender boys with delayed puberty may be prescribed testosterone if they have not begun \npuberty by 14 years of age.  Without testosterone, for most of these patients, puberty would \neventually initiate naturally.  However, testosterone is prescribed to avoid some of the social \nstigma that comes from undergoing puberty later than one's peers and failing to develop the \nsecondary sex characteristics consistent with their gender at the same time as their peers. Likewise, \nnon-transgender  girls  with  primary  ovarian  insufficiency,  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism \n(d elayed puberty due  to  lack  of estrogen  caused by a problem  with the  pituitary gland  or \nhypothalamus), or Turner's Syndrome (a chromosomal condition that can cause a failure of ovaries \nto develop) may be treated with estrogen.  And non-transgender girls with polycystic ovarian \nsyndrome (a condition that can cause increased testosterone and, as a result, symptoms including \nfacial hair) may be treated with testosterone suppressants.  The same treatments that are permitted \nfor non-transgender minors--often to affirm their gender-are banned if provided to transgender \nminors for the same reason. \n134.  The Health Care Ban prohibits chest surgery on transgender young men to treat \ngender dysphoria because it assists with \"gender transition,\" but minors are permitted to undergo \ncomparable surgeries.  For example, non-transgender adolescent boys can have surgery to treat \ngynecomastia-the proliferation of ductal or glandular breast tissue, as opposed to adipose tissue, \nin individuals assigned male at birth.  And non-transgender adolescent girls can have breast \nreconstruction surgery, including to address conditions such as breast hypoplasia: a lack of breast \ndevelopment in people assigned female at birth. These kinds of surgeries are commonly performed \n-34-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 35 of 47\nto reduce psychosocial distress, often related to the incongruence with one's gender.  Therefore, a \ntransgender boy assigned female at birth cannot receive chest-masculinizing surgery to affirm his \ngender identity but a non-transgender boy can.  Likewise, a transgender girl cannot receive chest \nfeminizing surgery to affirm her gender identity but a non-transgender girl can. \n135.  The legislative findings in the Health Care Ban cite an alleged lack of sufficient \nevidence  to  support  the  banned treatments.  Specifically,  the  findings  reference  a  lack  of \nrandomized clinical trials on the use of hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria. This purported \nconcern about the evidentiary basis for such treatment does not justify prohibiting it only when \nused to provide gender-affirming care to treat transgender adolescents with gender dysphoria. The \nvery same evidence is deemed acceptable to provide the same treatments for any other purpose. \n136.  The absence of \"randomized clinical trials\" is no reason to discount the standards \nof care recommended by major medical associations.  Indeed, much of medicine is developed \nwithout \"randomized clinical trials.\"  This criticism of treatment for gender dysphoria could be \nextended to other essential care, including treatments that the law expressly permits. \n137.  There can be many reasons why conducting randomized trials is not necessary or \nappropriate for evaluating a course of treatment.  Clinical research focusing on children is less \nlikely to use randomized trials than is clinical research for adults and, it may, at times, be unethical \nto conduct randomized trials.  For randomized trials to be ethical, clinical equipoise must exist; \nthere must be uncertainty about whether the efficacy of the intervention or the control is greater. \nThat is not the case with respect to the medical protocols for treating adolescents with gender \ndysphoria, which are known to provide significant relief to patients.  It would be unethical to \nknowingly expose some trial participants to an inferior intervention or to withhold treatment \n-35-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 36 of 47\naltogether.  Accordingly, in the field of pediatrics, parents and their children must often make \ndecisions about medical care without the benefit of randomized trials. \n138.  One example of an accepted-and permitted-treatment that has not been tested \nthrough randomized clinical trials is the use of puberty-delaying drugs to treat precocious puberty. \nEven without randomized clinical trials, existing observational evidence is considered sufficiently \nstrong to establish the standard of care for treatment of central precocious puberty.  The very same \ntreatment with the very same evidence permitted to treat central precocious puberty is prohibited \nwhen used to assist transgender adolescents with \"gender transition.\" \n139.  Similarly, there are no randomized clinical trials of genital surgery on minors with \nintersex conditions.  The Health Care  Ban explicitly permits medical intervention, including \nsurgical intervention, when a minor has an intersex condition (referred to in the law as a \"disorder \nof sexual development\"), despite the lack of such evidence and significant ethical concerns raised \nby performing such procedures on infants too young to participate in the decision-making process. \nHB 1570 § 3, 20-9-1501(6)(B)(i). \n140.  The General Assembly's purported interest in protecting minors from  potential \nrisks associated with the prohibited medical care likewise cannot justify the Health Care Ban. \nUnder the Health Care Ban, the risks related to puberty-delaying drugs, hormone therapy, and \nchest surgeries are acceptable when used to treat non-transgender youth for other purposes, but not \nwhen used to treat gender dysphoria in transgender adolescents. \n141.  Every medical intervention carries potential risks and potential benefits.  Weighing \nthe potential benefits and risks of the treatment for gender dysphoria is a prudential judgment \nsimilar to other judgments made by healthcare providers, adolescent patients, and their parents. \n-36-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 37 of 47\nAdolescent patients and their parents often make decisions about treatments with less evidence \nand/or greater risks than the treatment prohibited by the Health Care Ban. \n142.  The current standards of care for treating gender dysphoria in minors are consistent \nwith general ethical principles of informed consent.  The Endocrine Society clinical practice \nguidelines extensively discuss the potential benefits, risks, and alternatives to treatment, and its \nrecommendations regarding the  timing of interventions are based in part on the  treatment's \npotential risks and the adolescent's decision-making capacity. \n143.  There  is  nothing  unique  about  any of the  medically accepted  treatments  for \nadolescents with gender dysphoria that justify singling out these treatments for prohibition based \non concern about adolescents' inabilities to assent or their parents' inabilities to consent. \n144.  The Health Care Ban subjects medical care for transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria to a double standard.  The law singles out such care for sweeping prohibitions while \npermitting the same medical treatments carrying the same potential risks when prescribed to treat \nnon-transgender patients for any other purpose. \n145.  The  legislative  findings  claim  \"that  studies  consistently demonstrate  that  the \nmajority [of gender non-conforming children]  come  to  identify with their biological  sex in \nadolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary.\"  But \nthis reflects a complete misunderstanding of the treatment for gender dysphoria.  No medical \ntreatments are indicated until adolescence.  And the evidence is clear that when gender dysphoria \nis present in adolescence, patients almost always persist in their gender identity in the long-term. \n146.  The goal of treatment for gender dysphoria is not to change someone's gender \nidentity; rather, it is to resolve the distress associated with the disconnect between their assigned \n-37-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 38 of 47\nsex at birth and their gender identity.  Denying treatment to transgender adolescents will not cause \nthem to stop being transgender, but it will cause them to experience distress from lack of treatment. \nVI.  THE HEALTH CARE BAN WILL CAUSE SEVERE HARM TO TRANSGENDER \nYOUTH \n147.  Withholding gender-affirming medical treatment from  adolescents with gender \ndysphoria when it is medically indicated puts them at risk of extreme harm to their health and well \nbeing. \n148.  Adolescents with untreated gender dysphoria suffer significant distress.  Many are \non medication for  depression and anxiety.  Self-harm and suicidal ideation are  exceedingly \ncommon.  Suicidality among transgender young people is a crisis.  In one survey, more than half \nof transgender youths had seriously contemplated suicide.  Studies have found that as many as \n40% of trans gender people have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. \n149.  When adolescents are able to access puberty-delaying drugs and hormone therapy, \nwhich prevents them from going through endogenous puberty and allows them to go through \npuberty consistent with their gender identity,  their distress  recedes  and their mental  health \nimproves.  Both clinical experience and medical studies confirm that for many young people, this \ntreatment is transformative, and they go from painful suffering to thriving. \n150.  If a healthcare provider is forced to immediately stop puberty-delaying drugs or \nhormone therapy due to the Health Care Ban, it will cause patients to immediately resume their \nendogenous puberty.  This could result in extreme distress for patients who have been relying on \nmedical treatments to prevent bodily changes that come with their endogenous puberty.  For a girl \nwho is transgender, this could mean that she would immediately start experiencing genital growth, \nbody hair growth, deepening of her voice and development of a more pronounced Adam's apple. \nFor a boy who is transgender, this could mean the initiation of a menstrual cycle and breast growth. \n-38-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 39 of 47\nThese changes can be extremely distressing for a young person who had been experiencing gender \ndysphoria that was relieved by medical treatments. \n151.  Additionally, the effects of undergoing one's endogenous puberty may not be \nreversible even with subsequent hormone therapy and surgery in adulthood, thus exacerbating \nlifelong gender dysphoria in patients who have this medically-indicated treatment withheld or cut \noff.  Bodily changes from puberty as to stature, genital growth, voice, and breast development can \nbe impossible or more difficult to counteract. \n152.  For  patients  who  are  currently  undergoing  treatment  with  gender-affirming \nhormones like estrogen or testosterone, abruptly withdrawing care can result in a range of serious \nphysiological and mental health consequences.  The body takes about six weeks to ramp up \nendogenous hormones, so if a healthcare provider is forced to abruptly stop treatment, a patient \nwill be without sufficient circulating hormones at all.  This can result in depressed mood, hot \nflashes, and headaches.  For patients on spironolactone-a testosterone suppressant-abruptly \nterminating treatment can cause a patient's blood pressure to spike, increasing a young person's \nrisk of heart attack or stroke.  The abrupt withdrawal of treatment also results in predictable and \nnegative mental health consequences including heightened anxiety and depression. \n153.  Prior to the Health Care Ban, none of the more than 200 youth who have been \ntreated by the Gender Spectrum Clinic had attempted suicide.  In the weeks since the Health Care \nBan passed, six transgender adolescent patients have attempted suicide. \n154.  Gender-affirming medical care can be lifesaving treatment for minors experiencing \ngender dysphoria. The major medical and mental health associations support the provision of such \ncare and recognize that the mental and physical health benefits to receiving this care outweigh the \n-39-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 40 of 47\nrisks.

CAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT ONE \nTHE HEALTH CARE BAN VIOLATES THE \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S GUARANTEE OF \nEQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW \n(MINOR AND DOCTOR PLAINTIFFS) \n155.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals and \ngroups from discrimination by the government. \n156.  The Health Care Ban harms transgender youth, including the Minor Plaintiffs and \nthe patients cared for by the Doctor Plaintiffs, by denying them medically necessary care and \ninsurance coverage for such care because of their sex and because of their transgender status. \n157.  Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, government \ndiscrimination based on sex, including discrimination based on stereotypes associated with a \nperson's  sex  assigned  at  birth,  is  subject  to  heightened  judicial  scrutiny  and  is  therefore \npresumptively unconstitutional. \n158.  Under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  government  discrimination  based  on \ntransgender  status  is  also  subject  to  at  least  heightened  scrutiny  and  is  presumptively \nunconstitutional. \n159.  Transgender people have obvious, immutable, and distinguishing characteristics \nthat define that class as a discrete group.  These characteristics bear no relation to transgender \npeople's abilities to perform in, or contribute to, society. \n160.  Transgender people have historically been subject to discrimination, and remain a \nvery small minority of the American population that lacks political power. \n161.  The Health Care Ban bars the provision of various forms of medically necessary \ncare, and insurance coverage for such care, only when the care is related to a patient's \"gender \n-41-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 42 of 47\ntransition,\" which is defined as \"the process in which a person goes from identifying with and \nliving as a gender that corresponds to his or her biological sex to identifying with and living as a \ngender different from his or her biological sex.\"  HB 1570 §3, 20-9-1501(5). \n162.  Treatment for gender dysphoria-a condition that only transgender people suffer \nfrom-is always aimed at affirming a gender identity that differs from a person's assigned sex at \nbirth. \n163.  Under the Health Care Ban, the same medical treatments that are prohibited when \nprovided to transgender adolescents to help align their bodies with their gender identity may be \nprovided to non-transgender patients to help align their bodies with their gender identity, or for \nany other purpose. \n164.  Under the Health Care Ban, the Doctor Plaintiffs are prohibited from providing \ncertain medically necessary care to their transgender adolescent patients that they are permitted to \nprovide to their non-transgender adolescent patients, and that doctors who do not treat transgender \nadolescent patients are permitted to provide to all of their patients. \n165.  Under the terms of the Health Care Ban, whether or not a person can receive certain \nmedical treatments turns on their assigned sex at birth. \n166.  Under the terms of the Health Care Ban, whether or not a person can receive certain \nmedical treatments turns on whether they are transgender. \n167.  Under the terms of the Health Care Ban, whether or not a person can receive certain \nmedical treatments turns on whether the care tends to reinforce or disrupt stereotypes associated \nwith a person's sex assigned at birth. \n-42-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 43 of 47\n168.  The Health Care Ban does nothing to protect the health or well-being of minors. \nTo the contrary, it gravely threatens the health and well-being of adolescents with gender dysphoria \nby denying them access to lifesaving care. \n169.  The Health Care Ban is not substantially related to any important government \ninterest, nor is it rationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n170.  The Health Care Ban's targeted ban on medically necessary care provided for \ntransgender  youth  is  based on  generalized  fears,  negative  attitudes,  stereotypes,  and  moral \ndisapproval of transgender people that are not legitimate bases for unequal treatment under any \nlevel of scrutiny. \n171.  Defendants are liable for their violation of the right to equal protection under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, and the Minor Plaintiffs and Doctor Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment \nthat the Health Care Ban violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCOUNT TWO \nTHE HEALTH CARE BAN VIOLATES THE RIGHT TO \nPARENTAL AUTONOMY GUARANTEED BY THE \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n(PARENT PLAINTIFFS) \n172.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental \nright of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. \n173.  That fundamental right of parental autonomy includes the right of parents to seek \nand to follow medical advice to protect the health and well-being of their minor children. \n174.  Parents' fundamental right to seek and follow medical advice is at its apogee when \nthe parents, their minor child, and that child's doctor all agree on an appropriate course of medical \ntreatment. \n-43-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 44 of 47\n175.  The Health Care Ban's prohibition against well-accepted medical treatments for \nadolescents with gender dysphoria stands directly at odds with parents' fundamental right to make \ndecisions concerning the care of their children.  The Health Care Ban barges into Arkansas \nfamilies' living rooms and strips Arkansas parents of the right to provide medical care for their \nchildren. \n176.  The Health Care Ban does nothing to protect the health or well-being of minors. \nTo the contrary, it gravely threatens the health and well-being of adolescents with gender dysphoria \nby denying their parents the ability to obtain lifesaving care for them. \n177.  The Health Care Ban's prohibition against the provision of medically accepted \ntreatments for adolescents with gender dysphoria is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernment interest; nor is it rationally related to any legitimate government interest. \n178.  Defendants are liable for their violation of the right to due process under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983, and the Parent Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Health Care Ban \nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCOUNT THREE \nTHE HEALTH CARE BAN VIOLATES THE FIRST \nAMENDMENT'S FREE SPEECH PROTECTIONS \n(ALL PLAINTIFFS) \n179.  The First Amendment's guarantee of the freedom of speech applies to the states \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. \n180.  The speech restricted by the Health Care Ban is fully protected by the Free Speech \nClause of the First Amendment.  The Doctor Plaintiffs have a First Amendment right to refer \npatients for medically accepted treatments for gender dysphoria, and would continue to do so when \nmedically appropriate absent the Health Care Ban.  The Minor Plaintiffs and Parent Plaintiffs have \n-44-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 45 of 47\na First Amendment right to hear their doctors' medical recommendations, including their referrals \nto other healthcare providers. \n181.  The  Health Care  Ban violates the  First Amendment because it impermissibly \nrestricts  what  physicians  and  other healthcare  providers  can  say about  medically accepted \ntreatment for gender dysphoria.  It prevents a \"physician, or other healthcare professional\" from \n\"refer[ring] any individual under eighteen (18) years of age to any healthcare professional for \ngender transition procedures.\"  HB 1570 § 3, 20-9-1502(b). \n182.  The Health Care Ban's referral prohibition prevents healthcare professionals from \nspeaking about medical treatments only in certain instances, specifically with respect to referring \ntransgender patients under 18 years of age for such procedures when they are for the purpose of \n\"gender transition.\"  Healthcare professionals are permitted to refer non-transgender patients for \nthe same treatments when for purposes other than gender transition. \n183.  The Health Care Ban is subject to strict scrutiny because it is neither viewpoint nor \ncontent neutral. \n184.  The Health Care Ban discriminates on the basis of viewpoint by penalizing speech \nonly when that speech is related to care that would affirm a gender identity when that gender \nidentity is different from a person's assigned sex at birth.  The law does not restrict speech related \nto care that would affirm a gender identity that matches a person's assigned sex at birth. \n185.  The Health Care Ban discriminates on the basis of content because it penalizes \nspeech related to transgender patients, gender transition, and treatment for gender dysphoria, thus \npenalizing healthcare professionals based on the content of their speech. \n186.  The Health Care Ban's referral prohibition cannot satisfy strict scrutiny, or any \nother level of First Amendment scrutiny. \n-45-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 1   Filed 05/25/21   Page 46 of 47\n187.  Defendants are liable for their violation of the right to freedom of speech under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983, and the Doctor, Minor, and Parent Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment \nthat the Health Care Ban violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. \nVIII.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court: \n1.  Enter a judgment declaring that the Health Care Ban violates the equal \nprotection clause, the right to parental autonomy guaranteed by the due \nprocess clause, and the right to freedom of speech protected by the First \nAmendment, and is therefore unenforceable; \nii.

The petition for panel rehearing \nis also denied. \nJudge Stras would grant the petition for rehearing en bane.  Judges Gruender, \nErickson, Grasz and Kobes join, dissenting from the denial. \nJudge Shepherd did not participate in the decision or consideration of this \nmatter. \nAppellate Case: 21-2875 Page: 1 Date Filed: 11/16/2022 Entry ID: 5218304\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 226   Filed 11/16/22   Page 2 of 9\nCOLLOTON,  Circuit Judge,  with whom SMITH,  Chief Judge,  and BENTON, \nCircuit Judge, join, concurring in the denial of rehearing en bane. \nWhatever the merits of the panel opinion, this case is not appropriate for \nrehearing en bane in its current procedural posture.  The present appeal concerns a \npreliminary injunction entered in July 2021  as to which there has been no request \nfor a stay by the State in fifteen months.  The case is now in the midst of a trial in \nthe district court that is scheduled to conclude in less than a month, on December 1, \n2022.  The present interlocutory appeal will be moot when the district court enters a \nfinal judgment after the trial, either because judgment for the State will dissolve the \npreliminary injunction or because the preliminary injunction will merge into a final \njudgment for the plaintiffs. See Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U.S. 27, 44 (1920). An appeal \nfrom  the  final  judgment  will  present  this  court  with  a  comprehensive  record \ndeveloped after more than ten months of discovery and a full trial, as opposed to the \npreliminary record that is before the court in the present appeal.  For these reasons, \nI concur in the denial of the petition for rehearing. \nSTRAS,  Circuit  Judge,  with  whom  GRUENDER,  ERICKSON,  GRASZ  and \nKO BES, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en bane. \nIn my judgment, this is a case of \"exceptional importance.\"  Fed. R. App. P. \n35(a)(2); Planned Parenthood Minn., ND., S.D. v. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 730 (8th \nCir. 2008) ( en bane) (granting en bane review of a preliminary injunction in an \nabortion case).  The panel opinion checks two boxes in that regard: it draws a major \npiece of Arkansas legislation into doubt and recognizes what amounts to a new \nsuspect class.1 \n1The panel may have drawn inspiration from Bostock v.  Clayton County, 140 \nS. Ct. 1731, 1747 (2020).  The Fourteenth Amendment, however, predates Title VII \nby nearly a century, so there is reason to be skeptical that its protections reach so far. \nSee id.  at 1739--41  (interpreting Title VII by looking at what the words meant in \n1964); see also Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2245--46 \n(2022) (stating that \"[t]he regulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can \nundergo does not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny\").  Indeed, their text is \nnot similar in any way.  Compare 42 U.S.C.  § 2000e-(2)(a)(l), with U.S. Const. \namend. XIV, § 1. \nAppellate Case: 21-2875 Page: 2 Date Filed: 11/16/2022 Entry ID: 5218304\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 226   Filed 11/16/22   Page 3 of 9\nIt is true, as my colleagues recognize, that this case is not the perfect vehicle \nfor answering these \"momentous\" questions.  Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty.  Coll., 853 \nF.3d 339, 359 (7th Cir. 2017) (en bane) (Sykes, J., dissenting).  There is a trial \nongoing, which means there is a chance that it will become moot before the appeal \nis over.  Even so, I think it is worth the risk.  The panel opinion will frame the debate \nin the future, if not effectively decide any later appeal.  And even if this case never \ncomes back, we may be dealing with its far-reaching consequences for years to \ncome. \nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the decision to deny rehearing \nen bane. \nNovember 16, 2022 \nOrder Entered at the Direction of the Court: \nClerk, U.S. Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit. \n/s/ Michael E. Gans \nAppellate Case: 21-2875 Page: 3 Date Filed: 11/16/2022 Entry ID: 5218304\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00450-JM   Document 226   Filed 11/16/22   Page 4 of 9\nJohn Hibbs\nFrom: ca08ml_cmecf_Notify@ca8.uscourts.gov\nSent: Wednesday, November 16, 2022 9:43 AM\nSubject: 21-2875 Dylan Brandt, et al v.

Menendez, United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Minnesota, sitting by designation. \n \n2The Honorable James M. Moody, Jr., United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Arkansas. \n-3- \n\nof Arkansas.  This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) to review an \ninterlocutory order granting a preliminary injunction, and we affirm. \n \nI. Background \n \nOn April 6, 2021, the Arkansas state legislature overrode the governor’s veto \nand enacted Act 626.  The Act prohibits a healthcare professional from “provid[ing] \ngender transition procedures to any individual under eighteen (18) years of age” or \n“refer[ring]  any  individual  under  eighteen  (18)  years  of  age  to  any  healthcare \nprofessional for gender transition procedures.”  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-1502(a), (b).  \n“Gender  transition  procedures”  is  defined  to  include  “any  medical  or  surgical \nservice, including without limitation physician’s services, inpatient and outpatient \nhospital  services,  or  prescribed  drugs”  that  are  intended  to  “[a]lter  or  remove \nphysical or anatomical characteristics or features that are typical for the individual’s \nbiological sex” or “[i]nstill or create physiological or anatomical characteristics that \nresemble  a  sex  different  from  the  individual’s  biological  sex.”    Id.  §  20-9-\n1501(6)(A).  Specifically identified services include “puberty-blocking drugs, cross-\nsex hormones, or other mechanisms to promote the development of feminizing or \nmasculinizing features in the opposite biological sex, or genital or nongenital gender \nreassignment surgery performed for the purpose of assisting an individual with a \ngender transition.”  Id.  “Gender transition procedures” specifically does not include \n“[s]ervices to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development.”  \nId. § 20-9-1501(6)(B). \n \nAct 626 was set to take effect on July 28, 2021.  In May, Plaintiffs in this \nmatter—transgender youth (Minor Plaintiffs), their parents (Parent Plaintiffs), and \ntwo  healthcare  professionals  (Physician  Plaintiffs)—filed  a  complaint  seeking \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  Plaintiffs allege that Act 626 violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it discriminates against \nMinor Plaintiffs and Physician Plaintiffs’ minor patients on the basis of sex and \ntransgender status.  Parent Plaintiffs further allege the Act violates the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment by limiting their fundamental right to seek and \n-4- \n\nfollow medical advice for their children.  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that, by banning \nreferrals, Act 626 violates their First Amendment rights by limiting what Physician \nPlaintiffs can say and what Minor and Parent Plaintiffs can hear.   \n \nIn June, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to stop Act 626 from \ngoing into effect.  Arkansas moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  After a hearing on the motions, the \ndistrict court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the motion for preliminary \ninjunction,  concluding  that  Plaintiffs  had  standing  and  showed  a  likelihood  of \nsuccess on the merits of each of their claims and a likelihood of irreparable harm.  \nArkansas appeals. \n \nII.  Standing \n \nAs  an  initial  matter,  the  State  challenges  Plaintiffs’  standing  to  seek  an \ninjunction of specific aspects of the Act.  Constitutional standing requires that at \nleast one plaintiff demonstrate they have suffered a concrete and particularized \ninjury that is fairly traceable to the challenged action and is likely to be redressed by \na court ruling in the plaintiff’s favor.  See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 560–61 (1992).  Arkansas argues that because no Minor Plaintiff has declared \nan  intent  to  undergo  gender-reassignment  surgery  as  a  minor,  no  Plaintiff  has \nestablished  standing  to  challenge  the  ban  as  to  that  type  of  gender  transition \nprocedure.  The State also argues that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the section \nof the statute that provides for private enforcement because no defendant is involved \nin enforcement of the Act by private right of action.  But Arkansas does not contest \nthat Plaintiffs have met their burden under Lujan to challenge other parts of the Act, \nand  this  court  declines  the  State’s  invitation  to  modify  well-established \nconstitutional standing principles to require that a plaintiff demonstrate an injury \n-5- \n\ntraceable to every possible application of the challenged statute in order to satisfy \nthe constitutional standing requirement.3 \n \nIII.  Preliminary Injunction \n \nA. Legal Standard \n \n“In reviewing the issuance of a preliminary injunction, we consider the threat \nof irreparable harm to the movant, the likelihood that the movant will succeed on the \nmerits, the balance between the harm to the movant and injury that an injunction \nwould inflict on other parties, and the public interest.”  Brakebill v. Jaeger, 932 F.3d \n671, 676 (8th Cir. 2019) (citing Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, \n113 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc)).  A party challenging a state statute must show that \nshe is likely to prevail on the merits.  See Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. \nRounds, 530 F.3d 724, 730 (8th Cir. 2008).  “The plaintiff[s] need only establish a \nlikelihood  of  succeeding  on  the  merits  of  any  one  of  [their]  claims.”  \nRichland/Wilkin Joint Powers Auth. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 826 F.3d 1030, \n1040 (8th Cir. 2016) (quotation omitted).   \n \nWe  review  the  decision  to  grant  a  preliminary  injunction  for  abuse  of \ndiscretion.  See Rodgers v. Bryant, 942 F.3d 451, 456 (8th Cir. 2019).  “An abuse of \ndiscretion occurs where the district court rests its conclusion on clearly erroneous \nfactual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.”  Rounds, 530 F.3d at 733 (quotation \nomitted).  “If a factual finding is supported by substantial evidence on the record, it \nis not clearly erroneous.”  Dixon v. Crete Med. Clinic, P.C., 498 F.3d 837, 847 (8th \nCir. 2007).  “Clear error exists when despite evidence supporting the finding, the \nevidence as a whole leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that the finding is \na mistake.”  Richland/Wilkin, 826 F.3d at 1036 (quotation omitted). \n \n3The State also argues that Physician Plaintiffs lack third-party standing to sue \non behalf of their minor patients.  But since there is at least one plaintiff with \nstanding to bring each of Plaintiffs’ claims, we need not address this argument at this \njuncture. \n-6- \n\nB. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n \nTo evaluate Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits of their equal \nprotection claim, we must first determine the appropriate level of scrutiny.  Cf. \nLibertarian  Party  of  Ark.  v.  Thurston,  962  F.3d  390,  399  (8th  Cir.  2020) \n(determining as a threshold matter what level of scrutiny applied to the challenged \nstatute governing ballot access).  Act 626 prohibits “gender transition procedures,” \nwhich are defined as procedures or medications that are intended to change “the \nindividual’s biological sex.”  Ark. Code Ann. § 20-9-1501(6)(A).  The statute \ndefines  “biological  sex”  as  the  person’s  sex  “at  birth,  without  regard  to  an \nindividual’s psychological, chosen, or subjective experience of gender.”  Id. § 20-9-\n1501(1).  Thus, under the Act, medical procedures that are permitted for a minor of \none sex are prohibited for a minor of another sex.  A minor born as a male may be \nprescribed testosterone or have breast tissue surgically removed, for example, but a \nminor born as a female is not permitted to seek the same medical treatment.  Because \nthe minor’s sex at birth determines whether or not the minor can receive certain types \nof medical care under the law, Act 626 discriminates on the basis of sex.   \n \nArkansas’s characterization of the Act as creating a distinction on the basis of \nmedical  procedure  rather  than  sex  is  unpersuasive.    Arkansas  argues  that \nadministering testosterone to a male should be considered a different procedure than \nadministering  it  to  a  female  because  the  “procedure  allows  a  boy  to  develop \nnormally” whereas for a girl it has the effect of “disrupting normal development.”  \nBut this conflates the classifications drawn by the law with the state’s justification \nfor it.  The biological sex of the minor patient is the basis on which the law \ndistinguishes between those who may receive certain types of medical care and those \nwho may not.  The Act is therefore subject to heightened scrutiny.  See Heckler v. \nMathews, 465 U.S. 728, 744 (1984).  Cf. Whitaker ex rel. Whitaker v. Kenosha \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d 1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding \nthat where “the School District’s policy cannot be stated without referencing sex, as \nthe School District decides which bathroom a student may use based upon the sex \nlisted on the student’s birth certificate,” the policy “is inherently based upon a sex-\n-7- \n\nclassification  and  heightened  review  applies”)  (abrogation  on  other  grounds \nrecognized by Ill. Republican Party v. Pritzker, 973 F.3d 760 (7th Cir. 2020)).4 \n \nStatutes that discriminate based on sex must be supported by an “exceedingly \npersuasive justification.”  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (1996).  The \ngovernment meets this burden if it can show that the statute is substantially related \nto a sufficiently important government interest.  Id. at 533.  Arkansas relies on its \ninterest in protecting children from experimental medical treatment and regulating \nethics in the medical profession to justify Act 626.   \n \nThe district court found that the Act prohibits medical treatment that conforms \nwith “the recognized standard of care for adolescent gender dysphoria,” that such \ntreatment “is supported by medical evidence that has been subject to rigorous study,” \nand that the purpose of the Act is “not to ban a treatment [but] to ban an outcome \nthat the State deems undesirable.”  The record at this stage provides substantial \nevidence to support these factual findings. \n \nArkansas complains the district court failed to consider the medical evidence \nit  submitted.    Both  parties  provided  scientific  literature  and  declarations  from \nmedical experts and discussed the expert opinions in their briefs and at the motion \nhearing.  The district court acknowledged at the hearing that “experts [on both] sides \nof this case don’t agree, and I get that.  That’s part of the deal.”  We find no clear \nerror in the district court’s weighing of the competing evidence.  See Med. Shoppe \nInt’l, Inc. v. S.B.S. Pill Dr., Inc., 336 F.3d 801, 803 (8th Cir. 2003) (“Our deferential \nreview  [of  preliminary  injunctions]  arises  from  the  district  court’s  institutional \nadvantages in evaluating witness credibility and weighing evidence.”). \n \n \n4The district court also concluded that heightened scrutiny was appropriate \nbecause the Act facially discriminates against transgender people, who constitute a \nquasi-suspect class.  We discern no clear error in the district court’s factual findings \nunderlying this legal conclusion, but we need not rely on it to apply heightened \nscrutiny because the Act also discriminates on the basis of sex. \n-8- \n\nFurthermore, substantial evidence in the record supports the district court’s \nfactual findings, despite the contrary assertions of the State’s experts.  For example, \nwhile Arkansas’s experts criticize the structure and scale of research on hormone \ntherapies for adolescents with gender dysphoria, study design is only one factor \namong  many  that  medical  professionals  properly  consider  when  they  review \nresearch and determine what course of action to recommend to a patient.  And there \nis evidence in the record that these hormone treatments have been evaluated in the \nsame manner as many other medical innovations.  According to surveys of the \nresearch on hormone treatment for adolescents done by the British National Institute \nfor Health & Care Excellence, several studies have shown statistically significant \npositive effects of hormone treatment on the mental health, suicidality, and quality \nof life of adolescents with gender dysphoria.  None has shown negative effects.   \n \nAdditionally,  there  is  substantial  evidence  to  support  the  district  court’s \nconclusion  that  the  Act  prohibits  medical  treatment  that  conforms  with  the \nrecognized  standard  of  care.    Even  international  bodies  that  consider  hormone \ntreatment for adolescents to be “experimental” have not banned the care covered by \nAct 626.  For example, Arkansas submitted to the district court a report from the \nCouncil for Choices in Health Care in Finland in which the council concluded that \n“[i]n light of available evidence, gender reassignment of minors is an experimental \npractice,” but the report still recommends that gender-affirming care be available to \nminors  under  appropriate  circumstances.    In  fact,  the  Finnish  council’s \nrecommendations for treatment closely mirror the standards of care laid out by the \nWorld  Professional  Association  for  Transgender  Health  (WPATH)  and  the \nEndocrine Society, two organizations the State repeatedly criticizes.  Like WPATH, \nthe  Finnish  council  concluded  that  puberty-suppressing  hormones  might  be \nappropriate for adolescents at the onset of puberty who have exhibited persistent \ngender nonconformity and who are already addressing any coexisting psychological \nissues.  Similarly, the WPATH Standards of Care and the Finnish council both \nrecommend that cross-sex hormones be considered only where the adolescent is \n-9- \n\nexperiencing persistent gender dysphoria, other mental health conditions are well-\nmanaged, and the minor is able to meet the standards to consent to the treatment.5 \n \nIn sum, having reviewed the evidence as a whole, we are not left with the \n“definite and firm conviction” that the district court’s factual findings are clearly \nerroneous.  Rather, substantial evidence in the record supports its factual findings.  \nIn light of those findings, the district court did not err in concluding Act 626 is not \nsubstantially related to Arkansas’s interests in protecting children from experimental \nmedical treatment and regulating medical ethics, and Plaintiffs have demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their equal protection claim. \n \nC.  Balance of the Equities \n \nIn considering the risk of irreparable harm to the Plaintiffs, the district court \nfound that if Act 626 went into effect, Minor Plaintiffs would be denied access to \nhormone treatment (including needing to stop treatment already underway), undergo \nendogenous puberty—a process that cannot be reversed—and suffer heightened \ngender  dysphoria.    These  factual  findings  are  supported  by  Minor  Plaintiffs’ \naffidavits and are not clearly erroneous.  The findings support the conclusion that \nPlaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction.   \n \nAdditionally, it is “always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a \nparty’s constitutional rights.”  Bao Xiong ex rel. D.M. v. Minn. State High Sch. \nLeague, 917 F.3d 994,  1004 (8th Cir. 2019) (quoting Awad v. Ziriax, 670 F.3d 1111, \n \n5The  State also emphasized the  judicial decision in Bell v. Tavistock  & \nPortman  NHS  Foundation  Trust,  2020  EWHC  (Admin)  3274,  in  the  United \nKingdom, in which the court decided that minors under 16 years old could not \nconsent to receive hormone therapies and required court approval because it is “a \nvery unusual treatment” with “limited evidence as to its efficacy.”  Id. at ¶ 134.  That \njudgment has since been reversed, however, with the court of appeals concluding \nthat  “[n]othing  about  the  nature  or  implications  of  the  treatment  with  puberty \nblockers allows for a real distinction to be made” from other medical treatment an \nadolescent might seek.  2021 EWCA (Civ) 1363, at ¶ 76. \n-10- \n\n1132 (10th Cir. 2012)).  These interests, weighed against the potential harm to \nArkansas of not enforcing Act 626 between now and a final ruling on the merits of \nthe litigation, convince us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in \ngranting Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n \nD. Scope of the Injunction \n \nArkansas’s final argument is that the district court abused its discretion by \ngranting a facial injunction.  It is true, as the State points out, that some minors \nexperiencing gender dysphoria may  choose not to pursue the gender transition \nprocedures  covered  by  the  Act  and  therefore  would  not  be  harmed  by  its \nenforcement.  A party bringing a facial challenge must “establish that no set of \ncircumstances exists under which the Act would be valid,” United States v. Salerno, \n481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987), but the State describes minors for whom the Act simply \nwould have no application, see City of Los Angeles v. Patel, 576 U.S. 409, 418–19 \n(2015) (“The proper focus of the [facial] constitutional inquiry is the group for whom \nthe law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.” (quotation \nomitted)).    Moreover,  Arkansas  has  failed  to  offer  a  more  narrowly  tailored \ninjunction that would remedy Plaintiffs’ injuries.  The district court did not abuse its \ndiscretion by granting a facial injunction.   \n \nIV.  Conclusion \n \nBecause we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting \na preliminary injunction based on Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim, we need not \naddress the State’s challenges to Plaintiffs’ other claims.  The decision of the district \ncourt is affirmed.   \n______________________________ \n \n-11- ",
