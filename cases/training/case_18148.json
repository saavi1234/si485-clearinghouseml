    "summary": "<p>An incarcerated individual in the custody of the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) filed this lawsuit on April 28, 2014, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals, against the Director of the MDOC and the general dentist of the MDOC (in their official capacities). MDOC policy detailed that a person became eligible for routine dental care only after being incarcerated for two years. The plaintiff claimed that the denial of routine dental care constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Specifically, the complaint alleged that MDOC was deliberately indifferent to incarcerated persons&rsquo; dental needs and thus caused serious health complications. Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiff was represented by a private attorney and the Michigan State law school's civil rights clinic; the case was assigned to District Judge Laurie J. Michelson.</p>\r\n<p>The MDOC divided dental services into three categories: emergency (delay in treatment may result in death or permanent impairment), urgent (conditions medically necessary in the opinion of a qualified medical professional) and routine (anything non-urgent or non-emergent). In 2013, the MDOC instituted the policy of providing routine dental services only after two years of uninterrupted incarceration. The rule reduced the wait list for dental care by 75% from 8,000 to 2,000 people.</p>\r\n<p>On February 2, 2015, the court allowed the plaintiff to amend his complaint to include five other named plaintiffs incarcerated in different facilities operated by MDOC. On February 3, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification of one &ldquo;General Class&rdquo; and five subclasses. The General Class constituted all prisoners confined in MDOC facilities denied dental care and treatment (including those whose custody was officially under MDOC but who located in local jails). The five subclasses referred to were individuals:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>to whom dental care was denied due to the written policy not providing routine dental care until at least two years after arrival at the prison;</li>\r\n<li>who were within one year of release date and denied dental care because of a different written policy;</li>\r\n<li>whose teeth were in need of repairs but were given only&nbsp;the option of extraction;</li>\r\n<li>whose dentures or bridge(s) were worn out, broken, or lost and replacement was denied based on another written policy of the defendant; and</li>\r\n<li>(5) who had been incarcerated more than two years and were not within one-year of release, and who have lost natural teeth that required replacement.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The magistrate judge recommended class certification on August 11, 2015. The defendants objected to all aspects of the magistrate judge&rsquo;s report and recommendation, prompting review of the report by the district judge. On September 25, 2015, the district judge denied without prejudice the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification and rejected the magistrate judge&rsquo;s report. The court denied the motion for three primary reasons: plaintiffs failed to offer sufficient proof of their as-applied claims constituting a systemic issue; plaintiffs might not have been \"adequate\" class representatives and their claims might have been atypical of those they sought to represent; and plaintiffs may have failed the definiteness requirement, also referred to as ascertainability, for the class definitions. 2015 WL 5634446.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants were given leave to move for summary judgment multiple times. On November 6, 2015, the magistrate judge recommended that the named plaintiffs who were no longer incarcerated be dismissed from the case. 2015 WL 10521551. On March 17, 2016, the district judge adopted this recommendation and dismissed the cases of the plaintiffs no longer incarcerated. 2016 WL 1060449.</p>\r\n<p>On January 19, 2016, the magistrate judge further recommended granting the defendants&rsquo; motion for summary judgment, in large part because all of the named plaintiffs except for the first one had failed to complete the MDOC&rsquo;s formal grievance process before bringing the case, which meant that many of the plaintiffs had not complied with the pre-lawsuit exhaustion requirement of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). Specifically, the magistrate judge found that because none of the plaintiffs&rsquo; grievances named the general dentist, plaintiffs did not properly exhaust their claims against her. 2016 WL 8231172. Defendants objected to the magistrate judge&rsquo;s finding because she did not address their broader argument that plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were more comprehensively unexhausted; defendants argued that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust all their claims, not merely those against the general dentist.</p>\r\n<p>On review, the district judge found for the plaintiffs; referring to Sixth Circuit precedent, the district judge found that the PLRA did not allow MDOC officials to complain during litigation of a defect it had previously overlooked or forgiven during the grievance process. Further, because failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense, defendants bore the burden of convincing the court that no reasonable jury could find that plaintiffs exhausted their claims. 2016 WL 1253266.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There was then yet another round of litigation over administrative exhaustion: another named defendant filed an exhaustion-related motion to dismiss or for summary judgment on the claims of two plaintiffs. Plaintiffs complained that exhaustion related to their diagnosis of periodontal disease was \"unavailable\" to them, under the statute, because dental staff never informed them of that diagnosis.&nbsp; The district judge disagreed on Sept. 12, 2017, dismissing plaintiffs&rsquo; claims that MDOC violated the Eighth Amendment by (1) denying necessary dental care during the first two years of incarceration; and (2) denying periodontal care. 2017 WL 4038890.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While and after the exhaustion issue was under consideration, the plaintiffs renewed their request for class certification. Then they filed a fourth amended complaint on January 14, 2018 with a broader list of named plaintiffs. In their response on February 22, 2018, defendants reiterated the following assertions: (1) plaintiffs failed to exhaust their available administrative remedies; (2) plaintiffs&rsquo; claims were moot, making them unsuitable as class representatives; and (3) class certification would be improper because the proposed classes lacked commonality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, class status was adjudicated on February 13, 2019. The district judge&rsquo;s order noted that the MDOC had revised policies for tracking and treating periodontal disease according to some of the alternatives outlined in plaintiffs&rsquo; expert report. In this opinion, as modified after a motion for reconsideration, the district court rejected certification for Proposed Class I (all prisoners with fewer than two years of consecutive incarceration), and Class IVA (all prisoners on the Routine Dental Appointment List); the court held these were too broad and likely to include significant variation in dental health. However, the court held, the lack of class certification did not preclude plaintiffs from pursuing their claim that the MDOC&rsquo;s two-year rule violated the Eighth Amendment. 330 F.R.D. 452.</p>\r\n<p>In total, the end result of class certification was:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Class IIA: &ldquo;prisoners incarcerated in an MDOC correctional facility who have caries [tooth decay] that have reached the dentin [the main part of the tooth] or have early (or worse) periodontitis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Class IIB: \"all prisoners incarcerated in an MDOC correctional facility with healthy gums or gingivitis\"</li>\r\n<li>Class IIC: &ldquo;all prisoners incarcerated in an MDOC correctional facility with early, moderate, or advanced periodontitis who have not received all necessary scaling and root planing and follow-up treatment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Class III: all imprisoned people who requested and qualified for dentures</li>\r\n<li>Class IVB: all prisoners whom the MDOC had identified as awaiting urgent dental care.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>330 F.R.D. 452; 2021 WL 3700867.</p>\r\n<p>On February 23, 2022, the court dismissed the claim of Class IVB (those awaiting urgent dental care) at the request of both parties.</p>\r\n<p>The parties each sought summary judgment in August 2022. On January 26, 2023, the court granted MDOC's motion in part, and denied the plaintiffs' motion. 2023 WL 424259. After dismissing several claims as moot or improperly raised, what was left was:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Class IIA: noting remaining faculty disputes whether the defendants had been deliberately indifferent to the risk of serious harm to the class members in failing to perform certain tests to determine if the inmates had periodontitis.</li>\r\n<li>Class IIB: the court allowed the survival of claims by class members with gingivitis who had not yet served two years, but dismissed claims for class members who had served two years and for those who had inadequate-diagnosis claims. (The court also dismissed claims from people in Class IIB with healthy gums because not having a cleaning for two and a half years, or not receiving tests that would lead to a periodontitis diagnosis, did not create a substantial risk for them.)</li>\r\n<li>Class IIC: noting remaining factual disputes about both whether MDOC dentists completed dental procedures such as scaling and root planing, as treatment for periodontitis, and also about whether people in this subclass were at &ldquo;a substantial risk of serious harm,&rdquo; because periodontitis progresses differently depending on how early it is caught, each individual&rsquo;s oral hygiene routine, and if and when treatment begins.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>With summary judgment out of the way, the case settled in October 2023.&nbsp; Under the settlement, all current or future MDOC inmates became eligible to receive:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>routine dental services as 12 months of continuous incarceration within the MDOC</li>\r\n<li>periodontal screening and recording at dental intake,</li>\r\n<li>treatment for periodontitis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, the settlement agreement stipulated that MDOC would update its dental policies and manual to be consistent with this settlement agreement and provide updates every 180 days for two years to plaintiffs' counsel so they could determine if \"material terms of the settlement agreement are being met.\" Lastly, the settlement agreement required MDOC to pay $600,000 in plaintiffs' attorney's fees, with costs of litigation (such as expert fees, depositions, and filing fees) to be paid by the plaintiffs' attorneys out of this amount.&nbsp; The settlement explained&nbsp; \"It is anticipated that the implementation of the Settlement Agreement will be completed within a total of 90 days of the Court&rsquo;s order approving the Settlement Agreement.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Several class members filed objections to the settlement, but on Feb. 23, 2024, the court approved it. A week later, the parties stipulated to the case's dismissal.&nbsp; There is nothing more on the docket (except a notice from one of the members of the plaintiffs' counsel team that he was withdrawing because he was retiring).&nbsp; &nbsp;Presumably the settlement remains in effect through Feb. 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

MDOC policy detailed that a person became eligible for routine dental care only after being incarcerated for two years. The plaintiff alleged that the denial of routine dental care constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Class certification was granted in 2019. After multiple motions to dismiss, the court granted in part and denied in part defendantsโ motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment on January 26, 2023.

Michelson \non behalf of themselves and those  Magistrate Judge Jonathan J.C. Grey \nsimilarly situated,   \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n              \nv.             \n     \nHEIDI WASHINGTON and  \nJONG CHOI, \n \n  Defendants. \n \nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART \nDEFENDANTSโ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [363] AND \nDENYING PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT [366] \nPlaintiffs Melvin Bownes, Anthony Richardson, James Gunnels, and Timothy \nBrownell each claim that they have not received adequate dental care while in the \ncustody of the Michigan Department of Corrections. In fact, they maintain that \nDefendants MDOC Director Heidi Washington and MDOC Dental Director Jong Choi \nare deliberately indifferent to their serious dental problems. In Plaintiffsโ view, this \nmakes their incarceration the type of โcruel and unusual punishment[]โ prohibited \nby the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nAnd Plaintiffs say they are not unique in this regard. In fact, each represents \na class of hundreds if not thousands of inmates who have dental conditions like theirs \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15496   Filed 01/26/23   Page 2 of 77\nand who believe they too are not being provided dental care that comports with the \nConstitution.  \nPrimarily, Plaintiffs challenge three aspects of MDOCโs dental care. One is \nMDOCโs policy that inmates are not eligible for routine dental care during their first \ntwo years of imprisonment. Plaintiffs also claim that MDOC neither adequately \ndiagnoses nor adequately treats periodontal disease (gum disease). And, they say, \nMDOC does not adequately diagnose or treat caries (tooth decay). Due to these \nalleged deficiencies in dental care, Plaintiffs say that MDOC inmates will experience \nserious harm like an abscess or tooth loss or, at a minimum, they are at substantial \nrisk of experiencing those serious harms. \nAs relief, Plaintiffs do not seek damages. Instead, they seek to improve the \ndental  care  provided  by  MDOC  going  forward.  Or  in  legal  terms,  they  seek  a \nprospective injunction. They ask the Court to order MDOC to change its dental \npolicies  and  practices  so  that  they  are  no  longer  subject  to  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment. \nAfter nine years of litigation, this case has finally reached the summary-\njudgment stage. Both sides seek summary judgment in their favor. Defendants argue \nthat no reasonable factfinder could conclude that they have violated the Eighth \nAmendment. While Defendants have made a strong case for summary judgment, and \nwhile certain claims will be dismissed, the Court will deny their motion for the most \npart. And Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment will be denied. The Court justifies \nthese rulings, in painstaking detail, below. \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15497   Filed 01/26/23   Page 3 of 77\n Background \nBecause this case centers on the two-year rule, the treatment and diagnosis of \nperiodontal  disease,  and  the  treatment  and  diagnosis  of  caries,  a  thorough \nunderstanding of these concepts is necessary. \n The Two-Year Rule \nIn 2013, about a year before this suit was filed, MDOC instituted a policy that \nmade inmates ineligible for โroutineโ dental care until they completed two years of \nuninterrupted incarceration. See (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9536); MDOC Dental \nService Manual at 4 (eff. Dec. 19, 2017), available at (ECF No. 363-2, PageID.8858). \nGenerally speaking, 15 to 20 percent of MDOCโs inmates serve less than two years in \nprison or, at least, have a minimum sentence of two years or less. (See ECF No. 363-\n10,  PageID.9507;  ECF  No.  384,  PageID.15415.)  Before  the  two-year  rule  was \nimplemented, there were almost 15,000 inmates on the waitlist for dental care. (ECF \nNo. 363-10, PageID.9534.) Following implementation of the rule, the waitlist dropped \nto about 6,700 inmates. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9534.) \nInmates subject to the two-year rule are still entitled to โemergencyโ and \nโurgentโ  dental  services;  but  they  do  not  receive  โroutineโ  dental  services. \nโGenerally,โ urgent needs include โfacial swelling, oral facial trauma, uncontrolled \npostoperative bleeding, or significant pain or discomfort.โ MDOC Policy Directive \n04.06.150 ยถ D (eff. May 1, 2018) available at (ECF No. 363-3). In contrast, โroutineโ \ndental services include โ[l]imited diagnostic, restorative, periodontal, prosthetic, and \nnon-urgent  oral  surgical  procedures.โ  Id.  at  ยถ C.  Dental  care  for  urgent  (and \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15498   Filed 01/26/23   Page 4 of 77\nemergent) needs are provided to inmates at any point during their incarcerationโ\neven if they have served less than two years. Id. at ยถ L. \nThree aspects of the two-year rule should be highlighted. \nFirst, prisoners are required to serve two years before requesting a โcompleteโ \ndental exam. When an inmate enters the correctional system, MDOC performs an \nโintakeโ or screening dental exam, which is not as thorough as a complete exam. At \nthe intake exam, a dentist reviews the new inmateโs dental-health history, completes \na visual inspection for (among other things) periodontal disease and caries, and \ninstructs on oral hygiene. Policy Directive 04.06.150 ยถ J. If the intake exam reveals \nan urgent dental need, the inmate is referred to MDOCโs stabilization clinic where \nthe urgent need can be addressed. Id. at ยถ K. In contrast, in a complete exam, dentists \ntake more detailed โbitewingโ x-rays and create a treatment plan. MDOC Dental \nServices Manual at 11 (eff. Dec. 19, 2017); (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9446).  \nAlthough inmates become eligible for a complete exam after serving two years, \nthey are not provided that exam at the two-year mark but are instead placed on a \nwaitlist. Thus, about 50% of inmates do not receive their complete exam until after \n28 months in prison and about 25% of inmates wait even longer for their complete \nexam, 34 months. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15446.) After the first complete exam, an \ninmate is eligible for one โperiodicโ exam each year. Dental Services Manual at 17. \nSecond, inmates are not eligible for a periodontitis treatment called โscaling \nand root planingโ until they serve two years in prison. See Policy Directive 04.06.150 \nยถ M.3; (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9414โ9415 (Choi discussing ยถ M.3)). If the intake \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15499   Filed 01/26/23   Page 5 of 77\nexam  reveals  urgent  periodontitis,  the  stabilization  clinic  will  only  provide  a \nโdebridement,โ which is a different type of cleaning than a scaling and root planing. \n(See ECF No. 363-5, PageID.8988โ8989, 9010โ9011; ECF No. 374-7, PageID.12862.) \nDuring the two-year period, inmates can make an urgent care request and so it is \npossible that a dentist could prescribe a scaling and root planing in connection with \nthat request. But neither party has indicated how often this occurs. \nA third aspect of the two-year rule is particularly relevant to the pending \nmotions: many (if not most) inmates will not receive fillings for their cavities until \nthey serve two years in prison. See Policy Directive 04.06.150 ยถ M. According to Carla \nMaxwell, a dentist that conducts intake examinations and provides treatment at the \nstabilization clinic, if a cavity is too shallow to be urgent, a filling is not provided; and \nif the cavity is so deep that the tooth is not restorable, the tooth is extracted.  (See \nECF No. 363-5, PageID.9040, 9058.) But, says Maxwell, there are circumstances \nwhere, during the two-year period, the cavity is deep enough to be urgent, but not so \ndeep to warrant extraction, and so a filling is provided. (ECF No. 363-5, PageID.9042, \n9059; see also ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9340 (Choi describing when a filling would be \nprovided at the stabilization clinic).) \n Periodontal Disease \n What is Periodontal Disease? \nFor purposes of this case, periodontal disease consists of periodontitis and \ngingivitis. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15500   Filed 01/26/23   Page 6 of 77\nBasically, gingivitis causes inflammation of the gums. (See ECF No. 366-6, \nPageID.10833.) One way to diagnose gingivitis is to touch the gums with a dental \nprobe; in patients with gingivitis, the gums will bleed. (ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12942; \nECF No. 366-6, PageID.10791.) Gingivitis is reversible and painless. (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15383, 15422โ15423.) Treatments for gingivitis include good oral hygiene \nand a gingivitis-specific cleaning that removes calculusโessentially bacteria that has \nhardened itselfโfrom above and below the gumline. (ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12943; \nECF No. 366-2, PageID.9865โ9866.) \nPeriodontitis  is  a  disease  that  attacks  the  alveolar  bone  and  periodontal \nligament,  which  are  structures  that  hold  the  tooth  in  place.  (ECF  No.  384, \nPageID.15380โ15381.) This drawing shows a healthy alveolar bone, ligament, and \ntooth and those same structures attacked by periodontitis: \n \n(ECF No. 384, PageID.15381.) As periodontitis progresses, the ligament and bone are \nincreasingly damaged. This results in a โpocketโ or โloss of attachmentโ between the \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15501   Filed 01/26/23   Page 7 of 77\ntoothโs root and the gums. (See ECF No. 384, PageID.15381.) This loss of attachment \ndistinguishes periodontitis from gingivitis. (ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12943.) These \npockets permit harmful calculus to form on the toothโs root (the portion of the tooth \nbelow  the  normal  gumline).  (See  ECF  No.  366-3,  PageID.9950;  ECF  No.  384, \nPageID.15426 n.197.) The damage caused to the alveolar ligament and bone by \nperiodontitis is not reversible. (ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10830.) \nPeriodontitis is a stealthy disease: usually it is not painful until it reaches an \nadvanced stage. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15420.) Thus, if a patient is not informed that \nshe has periodontitis, she might not seek treatment for it until an abscess forms or \nher teeth have become loose. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15422โ15423; ECF No. 366-3, \nPageID.9904.) At that point, the teeth are often not salvageable absent advanced \nsurgical procedures. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15425 n.191.) \nAs a result of a โWorld Workshopโ for periodontology in 2017, periodontitis is \nnow categorized in three dimensions: stage, grade, and extent. Stage is a measure of \nseverity.  Stage  I  is  the  least  severe  (โa  borderland  between  gingivitis  and \nperiodontitisโ) and Stage IV the most severe (significant alveolar bone loss and, \npossibly, tooth loss). (ECF No. 384, PageID.15386โ15387.) Grade is a measure of how \nfast the disease is progressing, with Grade A for slow progression and Grade C for \nrapid. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15388.) Several individualized factorsโreferred to as \nโhostโ factorsโaffect the rate of progression. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15388; ECF No. \n366-2,  PageID.9872.)  Among  these  host  factors  are  smoking,  diabetes,  and  oral \nhygiene. (Id.; ECF No. 384, PageID.15388.) As for extent, that is a measure of how \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15502   Filed 01/26/23   Page 8 of 77\nmany teeth (and which) the disease is attacking; periodontitis can be localized to a \nfew teeth or generalized throughout the mouth. (See ECF No. 384, PageID.15387.) \nAlthough neither party has discussed it, the concept of โactiveโ periodontitis \nmay  explain  some  of  the  inconsistent  diagnoses  in  inmatesโ  dental  charts. \nPeriodontitis is a chronic disease, but treatment may make the disease โstableโ or, \ngiven the partiesโ heated debate over that term, treatment may greatly slow the \ndisease. (ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12954; ECF No. 366-7, PageID.10980โ10981.) Thus, \nit appears that a dentist might diagnose say, moderate periodontitis based on bone \nloss, but that diagnosis does not necessarily mean the disease is active. (ECF No. 366-\n6, PageID.10869, 10871.) And, while also not addressed by the parties, it appears that \nonly  โactiveโ  periodontitis  requires  immediate  treatment.  (ECF  No.  366-6, \nPageID.10741 (Johnston testifying that after treatment, the patient is โreevaluate[d] \nto find out which sites are active or which sites are stableโ and that treatment is \ndiscontinued for stable sites); ECF No. 363-5, PageID.8990โ8991 (Maxwell testifying \nthat โmoderate bone lossโ is โmoderate periodontal diseaseโ but that โjust because \nyou have whatever percent bone loss you have, does not mean you are in an acute \nsituationโ); ECF No. 366-7, PageID.10980โ10981 (Gillette testifying that a patient \ncan โhave periodontal disease but they donโt need treatmentโ).) \nPeriodontitis is a common disease. About 45% of the adult population have \nsome form of the disease. (See ECF No. 384, PageID.15381 & n.14.) But in correctional \npopulations,  there  is  a  higher  percentage  of  people  with  moderate  to  severe \nperiodontal disease than in the general population. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15383.) \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15503   Filed 01/26/23   Page 9 of 77\nLeft untreated, periodontitis can result in periodontal abscesses (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15423,  15424โ15425  n.51,  15467)  and  tooth  loss  (ECF  No.  384, \nPageID.15376). \n How is Periodontitis Diagnosed? \nDiagnosis  of  Periodontitis  Generally.  Periodontitis  is  diagnosed  based  on \nseveral factors. Some of the factorsโinflammation of the gums and the patientโs oral \nhealth historyโdo not require a dentist to use any special tools. (See ECF No. 363-8, \nPageID.9217.) But a pair of tools for diagnosing periodontitis lie at the heart of this \ncase: periodontal probing and โbitewingโ x-rays. \nTake probing first. Periodontal probing is the process of measuring pocket \ndepths in millimeters using a periodontal probe. (See ECF No. 384, PageID.15381.) \nIn other words, the probe is placed in the space between the tooth and the gums to \ncheck  how  deep  the  probe  goes.  Some  might  recall  their  hygienist  reading  out \nnumbers as he works his way around the mouth, โ3, 2, 3; 2, 1, 2; . . .โ; that process is \nperiodontal probing and charting. A โperiodontal screening and recordingโ or โPSRโ \n(not to be confused with โSRP,โ a treatment for periodontitis) is an abbreviated \nprobing and charting used by many correctional departments and the military. (ECF \nNo. 384, PageID.15382.) A PSR takes only a couple of minutes to complete. (ECF No. \n366-9, PageID.11466.) In contrast, a comprehensive periodontal probing and charting \ninvolves measuring and recording six pocket depths of every tooth. (ECF No. 366-6, \nPageID.10718, 10833.) But even this more comprehensive process takes less than ten \nminutes. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9444; ECF No. 366-9, PageID.11465.) \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15504   Filed 01/26/23   Page 10 of 77\nIt is standard practice to perform periodontal probing to diagnose periodontitis. \nOne of Plaintiffsโ experts, Jay Shulman, DMD, opines, โ[periodontal probing has been \nthe] standard of care for ages.โ (ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12953.) In his opinion, โYou \ncannot  diagnose  periodontal  disease  without  probing.โ  (ECF  No.  374-8, \nPageID.12953.) Stephen Harrel, DDS, Plaintiffsโ other expert, similarly opines that \nperiodontal disease cannot be diagnosed โwithout the use of a periodontal probe to \nmeasure the depthโ of the โspace between the gum and the tooth/root.โ (ECF No. 366-\n2, PageID.9859; see also id. at PageID.9923 (opining that without probing, there were \nno situations where periodontal disease could be accurately diagnosed).) And even \nDefendantsโ expert, Jeffrey Johnston, DDS, believes that the โstandard of careโ \n(which he agreed was โthe minimum diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician \nshould  followโ  for  a  particular  illness  (ECF  No.  366-6,  PageID.10680))  required \ndentists to use probing to diagnose periodontitis. (ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10765, \n10850 (โI would agree that the probing is a standard of careโ).) \nMoreover, several MDOC dentists conceded that in private practice generally, \nor at least at their private practices, periodontal probing is performed to diagnose \nperiodontal disease. (See e.g., ECF No. 366-7, PageID.10979 (Gillette), ECF No. 363-\n5, PageID.8995, 9002 (Maxwell), ECF No. 366-5, PageID.10476 (Minnich).) Even \nJong Choi, MDOCโs Dental Director and the primary defendant in this case, conceded \nthat in private practice generally, and at his private practice specifically, periodontal \nprobing is used to diagnose periodontal disease. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9346, 9444; \nsee also id. at PageID.9323.) \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15505   Filed 01/26/23   Page 11 of 77\nDentists also use x-rays to diagnose periodontitis. Two types of x-rays are at \nissue in this case. One is the panoramic x-ray, which, as the name suggests, is taken \nby a device rotating in a half circle around the patientโs head; the result is an image \nof the entire mouth and upper and lower jaw. The other is the โbitewingโ x-ray, which \nis taken by placing a device inside the patientโs mouth; the result is an image of just \na few teeth in one area of the mouth. Here is a panoramic x-ray and a bitewing x-ray: \nPanoramic  Bitewing \n   \n \n(ECF No. 384, PageID.15400โ15401.) \nAlthough Plaintiffsโ experts made compound statementsโreferencing both \nprobing and x-rays at onceโit appears that they also believe that periodontitis \ncannot be accurately diagnosed without bitewing x-rays. For instance, Shulman \nopines that under โprofessional standards,โ a periodontitis treatment plan would be \nbased on โprobing and bitewing x-rays.โ (ECF No. 384, PageID.15402, 15434.) He \nfurther opines that without โbitewing x-rays and periodontal probing,โ a patientโs \nperiodontitis might be underdiagnosed. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15485.) Harrel, also \none of Plaintiffsโ experts, believes that โthe use of only panoramic radiographs for \nperiodontal diagnosis is inadequate and below the standard of care.โ (ECF No. 366-2, \nPageID.9872.) \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15506   Filed 01/26/23   Page 12 of 77\nDefendantsโ  expert  disagreesโto  an  extent.  Johnston  believes  that  if  a \npanoramic x-ray is of โdiagnosticโ quality, it can be used to stage periodontitis and, \nin more advanced cases, even diagnose it. (See ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10782; see also \nid. at PageID.10800, 10809.) Thus, Johnston believes that diagnosing periodontitis \nwith a high-resolution panoramic x-ray and probingโas opposed to bitewing x-rays \nand probingโwould not necessarily violate the standard of care. (See ECF No. 366-\n6, PageID.10783, 10785, 10850, 10857โ10858.) \nMDOC Diagnosis of Periodontitis. At the intake exam, probing is not used to \ndiagnose periodontitis. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9291โ9292, 9326 (Choi); ECF No. \n363-5, PageID.8985, 9157 (Maxwell, intake dentist).) Bitewing x-rays are not taken \nat the intake exam, either. (ECF No. 363-5, PageID.9158 (Maxwell); ECF No. 363-10, \nPageID.9324โ9325 (Choi).) Instead, MDOC takes a panoramic x-ray, which Shulman \nconcedes is โhigh resolution for a pano.โ (ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12936.) Thus, \nMDOCโs intake dentists assess periodontitis by conducting a visual inspection of the \nmouth (aided by a dental mirror), a review of the inmateโs oral-health history, and a \nreview  of  the  panoramic  x-ray.  (ECF  No.  363-10,  PageID.9321,  9362  (Choi).) \nFollowing that exam, MDOC dentists designate inmates as having normal gums, \ngingivitis,  early  periodontitis,  stable  moderate  periodontitis,  unstable  moderate \nperiodontitis,  or  advanced  periodontal  disease.  (ECF  No.  384,  PageID.15418 \n(Shulman); ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9505 (Choi memorandum).) \nAt the first complete exam, which takes place after serving two-and-half years \nor so in prison, MDOC dentists do take bitewing x-rays. But probing is still not \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15507   Filed 01/26/23   Page 13 of 77\nregularly  performed.  (ECF  No.  363-10,  PageID.9326  (Choi  testifying  that  at  a \ncomplete exam, there are no periodontal measurements and that pocket depths are \nnot recorded); see also ECF No. 384, PageID.15421 (Shulman).) And if probing is \nperformed, the pocket depths are not usually recorded, meaning that there are no \nbaseline depths to track periodontitis progression. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9326; \nECF No. 384, PageID.15421.) \nThus, to summarize, MDOC dentists diagnose periodontitis at intake without \nthe benefit of periodontal probing or bitewing x-rays. At complete exams, MDOC \ndentists  do  use  bitewing  x-rays  to  diagnose  periodontitis  but  rarely  perform \nperiodontal probing. Moreover, pocket depths are generally not recorded at any point \nduring an inmateโs incarceration. \n How is Periodontitis Treated? \nBefore describing periodontitis treatment, some additional terminology is in \norder.  Plaintiffs  stress  that  โprophylaxis,โ  โdebridement,โ  and  โscaling  and  root \nplaningโ are three different procedures. And at least according to Current Dental \nTerminology codes published by the American Dental Association, they are correct. \nUnder the CDT, a โdebridementโ involves โthe preliminary removal of plaque and \ncalculus that interferes with the ability of the dentist to perform a comprehensive \noral evaluation.โ (ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9866.) And a โprophylaxisโ is defined as the \nโ[r]emoval of plaque, calculus, and stains from the tooth structuresโโapparently a \nstandard cleaning at, say, a six-month checkup. (ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9865.) In \ncontrast  to  debridement  and  prophylaxis,  โscaling  and  root  planingโ  โinvolves \n13 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15508   Filed 01/26/23   Page 14 of 77\ninstrumentation of the crown and root surfaces of the teeth to remove plaque and \ncalculus  from  these  surfaces.โ  (ECF  No.  366-2,  PageID.9866  (emphasis  added).) \nScaling and root planing is โtherapeutic, not prophylactic, in natureโ and is intended \nto be performed only when there is loss of attachment between the tooth and gumsโ\notherwise โthere is no exposed root surface to plane.โ (ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9866โ\n9867.) In other words, while prophylaxis, debridement, and scaling and root planing \nall involve scaling the teeth to remove calculus, scaling and root planing is a specific \ntreatment for periodontitis and necessarily includes going into the pocket formed by \nthe disease and removing the tissue from the tooth root that has been permeated with \ncalculus.  (See  ECF  No.  366-2,  PageID.9866โ9867  (Harrel);  ECF  No.  366-3, \nPageID.9916โ9917 (Harrel); ECF No. 384, PageID.15426 (Shulman); ECF No. 366-6, \nPageID.10734 (Johnston).) \nAccording to Plaintiffsโ experts, neither prophylaxis nor debridement suffices \nto treat periodontitis. (ECF No. 366-3, PageID.9914, 9962, 9971 (Harrel); ECF No. \n384, PageID.15424โ15426 (Shulman).) And, on this point, it appears that Johnston, \nDefendantsโ  expert,  agrees.  (ECF  No.  366-6,  PageID.10750โ10751  (agreeing \ndebridement is not a treatment for โperiodontal diseaseโ and that a debridement \nwould  violate  the  standard  of  care  for  treating  periodontitis);  ECF  No.  366-6, \nPageID.10724 (testifying that prophylaxis is a treatment for gingivitis).) Moreover, \nthe experts largely agree that, typically, local anesthesia is used to perform a scaling \nand  root  planing,  further  distinguishing  that  treatment  from  prophylaxis  and \ndebridement. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15405 (Shulman); ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10734 \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15509   Filed 01/26/23   Page 15 of 77\n(Johnston).) The evidence also suggests that scaling and root planing takes longer \nthan a prophylaxis or debridement. (See ECF No. 384, PageID.15425 (Shulman); ECF \nNo. 366-6, PageID.10726, 10736 (Johnston).) \nBefore 2020, MDOC dental staff might not have treated periodontitis with \nscaling and root planing or, at least, did not document โscaling and root planingโ \nwhen they performed that procedure. Shulman reviewed 100 inmatesโ dental records \nfrom before 2020. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15432.) According to him, 61 of these 100 \ninmates were diagnosed with periodontitis at a complete exam, yet only a prophylaxis \nwas documented on their charts. (ECF No. 315-11, PageID.8020.) In some of the \ndental records Shulman reviewed, the term โperio scaleโ appeared. (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15465; ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12955.) But in Shulmanโs opinion, โperio \nscaleโ has โno clear definitionโ and โappears closer to an extended prophyโ than a \nscaling and root planing. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15470.) \nAccording to Choi, MDOCโs Dental Director, there is a simple explanation for \nthis.  Prior  to  2020,  MDOC  dentists  and  hygienists  would  use  โprophylaxis,โ \nโdebridement,โ and โperio scaleโ interchangeably and that each of these terms could \ninclude  scaling  and  root  planing.  (ECF  No.  374-9,  PageID.13074,  13079.)  Choi \nexplains, โscaling and root planing versus prophylaxis, they are all the same teeth \ncleaning . . . . [A]s MDOC[,] we have been using the gross terminology as โperio scalingโ \nor โscalingโ or โprophyโ for all the situations, because we did not differentiate each \nterminology from one case to another.โ (ECF No. 374-9, PageID.13074.) โ[The] bottom \nline,โ says Choi, โcan be summarized as one word, a patient received a teeth cleaning, \n15 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15510   Filed 01/26/23   Page 16 of 77\nour hygienists clean the teeth as needed.โ (ECF No. 374-9, PageID.13074, 13079; see \nalso ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9243, 9245, 9408.) \nThings changed starting in January 2020. That month, MDOC changed its \ncomputer system to the Corrections Offender Management System (COMS). (ECF \nNo. 363-7, PageID.9202; ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9239.) With this change, MDOC \nbegan using the Current Dental Terminology codes published by the American Dental \nAssociation. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9238.) As such, for the past three years, MDOC \nhas not used terms like โperio scaleโ and instead uses โPerio Scaling & Root Planingโ \nalong with the corresponding CDT codes for scaling and root planing. (ECF No. 379-\n1, PageID.14414.) Choi explains, COMS โprevent[s] . . . us [from] using the term[s] \ninterchangeably.โ (ECF No. 374-9, PageID.13165.) And Defendants have produced \nevidence that from January 2020 to October 2022โa period that includes a routine-\ncare hiatus due to COVID-19โMDOC dental staff โcompletedโ over 900 scalings and \nroot planings. (ECF No. 379-1, PageID.14368โ14447.) \nOne other fact about how MDOC treats periodontitis: during an inmateโs first \ntwo years of incarceration, he or she does not receive scaling and root planing for \nperiodontitis (unless, perhaps, it is part of an urgent-care appointment). See Policy \nDirective 04.06.150 ยถ C (eff. May 1, 2018); Dental Services Manual at 4โ5 (eff. Dec. \n19, 2017). Maxwell, an intake and stabilization dentist, explains that if an inmate is \ndiagnosed with acute periodontitis at intake, he or she would not be referred to the \nstabilization clinic for a scaling and root planing. (ECF No. 363-5, PageID.8989.) \nInstead, that inmate would be referred to the stabilization clinic for a debridement. \n16 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15511   Filed 01/26/23   Page 17 of 77\n(ECF No. 363-5, PageID.8987, 9010.) Maxwell explains, โWe refer for debridement \nbecause a debridement will allow for the hygienist to remove the large deposits of \ncalculus thatโs present. That is a contributing factor to his acute periodontal issue at \nthe point of exam.โ (ECF No. 363-5, PageID.8988.) Lisa Stout, an MDOC hygienist \nwho has done a stint or two at the stabilization clinic, agrees that scalings and root \nplanings are not performed at the clinic because โthe patient is not eligible for routine \ntreatment.โ (ECF No. 374-7, PageID.12862.) She explains that when she performed \na debridement at the stabilization clinic she would just โknock[] off the big stuffโ until \nthe  inmate  could  later  receive  a  scaling  and  root  planing.  (ECF  No.  374-7, \nPageID.12863.) \n Caries \nThis case also involves a separate, progressive disease: caries. The Court again \ntakes a three-part approach: it will describe the nature of the disease, its treatment, \nand its diagnosis. \n What is Caries? \nIn lay terms, caries is a cavity. For dentists, caries is โan infectious disease \ncharacterized by progressive destruction of tooth substance, beginning on the outer \n(enamel) surface or the exposed root surface.โ (ECF No. 384, PageID.15378.) An \nโincipientโ lesion is one that has only caused damage to the toothโs enamel (a very \ntough but thin shell of the tooth). (ECF No. 384, PageID.15379.) At this point, the \nlesion โhas the potential to re-mineralize, reversing the decay process.โ (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15379.) As the decay deepens, it reaches the toothโs dentin, a substance less \n17 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15512   Filed 01/26/23   Page 18 of 77\nresistant to decay than enamel. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15379.) According to Shulman, \nonce a cavity has reached the dentin, โthe patient should be scheduled for treatment.โ \n(ECF No. 384, PageID.15379; ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10842 (Johnston similarly \ntestifying, โIf I see caries that is getting halfway to the pulp, Iโm going to want to do \n[a comprehensive exam] as soon as possible.โ).) If the caries lesion is allowed to \nprogress further, it will eventually reach the toothโs pulp, i.e., the toothโs nerve and \nblood  supply.  (ECF  No.  384,  PageID.15379;  ECF  No.  366-6,  PageID.10882.) \nUntreated caries can cause pain, infection, tooth loss, and, in some cases, a systemic \ninfection. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15378.) \nLike periodontitis, caries progression depends on an individualโs host factors. \nThese factors include diet and โdry mouthโ caused by medications. (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15380.)  Because  there  are  several  factors  that  affect  the  rate  of  caries \nprogression, it is not possible to state, as a general matter, how much time it would \ntake  for  a  cavity  in  the  enamel  to  reach  the  dentin  or  pulp.  (ECF  No.  384, \nPageID.15430 (Shulman remarking that his โcrystal ball is too cloudy to tell [him] \nhow many months it [would] take the asymptomatic decay in [an inmateโs tooth] to \nbecome symptomaticโ); see also ECF No. 384, PageID.15430 (noting that the process \nโmay take several yearsโ); ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12936.) \n How is Caries Treated? \nCaries treatment depends on how far the lesion has extended into the tooth. \nFor  caries  in  the  enamel  only,  a  fluoride  treatment  with  continued  monitoring \nsuffices. (ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12938.) If a cavity has reached the dentin, a filling \n18 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15513   Filed 01/26/23   Page 19 of 77\nis typical treatment. (See ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12938.) Although MDOC provides \nfillings, they are not provided during an inmateโs first two years in prison unless the \ncavity  is  urgent  (but  not  so  urgent  to  require  extraction).  (ECF  No.  363-5, \nPageID.9042, 9059; see also ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9340.) Once a cavity has reached \nthe pulp, a root canal is a common treatment. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15379.) But \nMDOC does not provide root canals, so for an inmate, an extraction might be the only \nremedy for a tooth with deep decay. See Policy Directive 04.06.150 ยถ N; (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15379 n.6). \n How is Caries Diagnosed? \nIn terms of the tools for diagnosing caries, the experts in this case largely \nagree.  \nAccording to Shulman, incipient lesions that have only attacked the enamel \ncan be difficult to identify because โtoo little tooth has been affected to be seen on a \nradiograph.โ (ECF No. 384, PageID.15379.) Once caries has reached the dentin, it \nwill still not be visible on a panoramic x-ray but can be diagnosed using a bitewing x-\nray. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15401.) Further, says Shulman, when there is caries \nbetween teeth (i.e., interproximal decay), bitewing x-rays are needed to see it. (ECF \nNo. 374-8, PageID.12935.) The exception is โvery pronouncedโ interproximal cariesโ\nthat decay will show up on even a panoramic x-ray. (Id.; see also ECF No. 366-3, \nPageID.9914 (Harrel).) \nDefendantsโ expert largely agrees. In Johnstonโs opinion, a panoramic x-ray \nwill reveal โgrossโ interproximal caries, but โitโs much more difficult to see incipient \n19 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15514   Filed 01/26/23   Page 20 of 77\ncaries  on  a  panorex  than  on  a  bitewing.โ  (ECF  No.  366-6,  PageID.10785.)  And \nJohnston conceded that the โstandard of careโ requires a dentist to use bitewing x-\nrays (or another type of intra-oral x-ray) to diagnose incipient, interproximal caries. \n(ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10786.) \nAs discussed, MDOC dental staff do not take bitewing x-rays at intake but do \ntake them at the first complete exam. \n Plaintiffsโ Challenges to MDOCโs Dental Care \nNow to the legal issues at hand.  \nThis case is almost nine years old. Recounting the entire procedural history is \nnot productive, but here are a few highlights. Plaintiffs filed this suit in 2014. In 2015, \nthis Court denied Plaintiffsโ first motion for class certification in part because it \nbelieved that threshold issues โsuch as exhaustion and mootnessโ should be resolved \nfirst. Johannes v. Washington, No. 14-CV-11691, 2015 WL 5634446, at *10 (E.D. \nMich. Sept. 25, 2015). In 2016, the Court addressed Defendantsโ motion related to \nexhaustion and mootness and dismissed some of the named plaintiffsโ claims. See \ngenerally Johannes v. Washington, No. 14-11691, 2016 WL 1253266 (E.D. Mich. Mar. \n31, 2016). The case was then stayed for six months so that Plaintiffs could exhaust \ncertain claims, and in late 2016, Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. (ECF No. \n161, 168.) In 2018, following another motion by Defendants on the basis of exhaustion \nand some discovery, Plaintiffs filed their fourth amended complaint. (ECF No. 236.) \nAround this time, Plaintiffs also asked the Court to certify large classes consisting of \n20 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15515   Filed 01/26/23   Page 21 of 77\nthousands, if not tens-of-thousands, of inmates in the custody of MDOC. See (ECF \nNo. 242); Dearduff v. Washington, 330 F.R.D. 452, 456 (E.D. Mich. 2019). \nThe Court declined to certify some of the large classes Plaintiffs proposed. As \nthe Court explained, in a group of thousands of inmates, the dental-health diversity \nis great. See Dearduff v. Washington, 330 F.R.D. 452, 466โ67 (E.D. Mich. 2019). \nImagine Jessica, who has never smoked, is not diabetic, is generally very healthy, \nand is fastidious about oral hygiene. Now imagine Michael, who is diabetic, has \nsmoked for many years, is generally not very healthy, and has very poor oral hygiene. \nSuppose  that  at  intake,  Jessica  is  diagnosed  with  Stage  I  periodontitis,  โthe \nborderland  between  gingivitis  and  periodontitisโ  (ECF  No.  384,  PageID.15387), \nwhereas Michael is diagnosed with Stage II, i.e., โestablishedโ periodontitis. If both \nJessica and Michael go two-and-half years without scaling and root planing, there is \nat least a fair, and perhaps a very good chance that Jessicaโs periodontitis will not \nadvance  to  a  serious  medical  need,  but  just  the  opposite  is  true  of  Michaelโs \nperiodontitis. (See ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10772 (Johnston discussing host factors).) \nSo in a group of thousands of inmates, individualized inquiries abounded, meaning \nthat the Court could not decide an issue central to each inmateโs Eighth Amendment \nclaim in โone stroke.โ See Dearduff v. Washington, 330 F.R.D. 452, 456, 467 (E.D. \nMich. 2019) (citing Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)). \nBut the Court did find that smaller classes with less dental-health diversity \nsatisfied Rule 23โs requirements for certification. And, ultimately, the Court certified \n21 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15516   Filed 01/26/23   Page 22 of 77\nfive classes. Bownes v. Washington, No. 14-CV-11691, 2021 WL 3700867, at *11 (E.D. \nMich. Aug. 20, 2021). \nClass IIA consists of inmates who have caries that reached the dentin or early, \nmoderate,  or  advanced  periodontitis.  Bownes,  2021  WL  3700867,  at  *11.  The \nmembers of this class claim that MDOCโs failure to use intraoral x-rays at intake and \nfailure to conduct periodontal probing at any point during their incarceration violates \nthe Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. See id. \nClass IIB consists of inmates who have healthy gums or gingivitis. Bownes, \n2021 WL 3700867, at *11. The claims of this class will be clarified below but, for now, \nit suffices to say that these inmates claim that MDOCโs failure to conduct probing \nand charting, and failure to provide certain dental cleanings, violates the Eighth \nAmendment. \nClass IIC consists of inmates who have periodontitis but have not received all \nnecessary scaling and root planing and follow-up treatment. See Bownes, 2021 WL \n3700867, at *11. These inmates claim that MDOCโs failure to provide them with \nscaling  and  root  planing  and  the  associated  follow-up  care  violates  the  Eighth \nAmendment. See id. \nThe Court also certified two other classes. The members of Class III claim that \nMDOC does not provide dentures in a timely manner. See Bownes, 2021 WL 3700867, \nat *11. The members of Class IVB claimed that MDOC does not provide urgent care \nin a timely manner; by stipulation of the parties, the members of Class IVB agreed \nto dismiss their claim. (ECF No. 346, PageID.8486.) \n22 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15517   Filed 01/26/23   Page 23 of 77\nBoth sides now seek summary judgment. \n Legal Standards \n Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment \nWhen, as here, both sides seek summary judgment, the Court considers each \nmotion separately, and it is not necessarily the case that either party is entitled to \nsummary judgment. See Ohio State Univ. v. Redbubble, Inc., 989 F.3d 435, 442 (6th \nCir. 2021). When considering Plaintiffsโ motion, the evidence is viewed in the light \nmost favorable to Defendants and the initial (and ultimate) burden is on Plaintiffs to \nshow that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See id. The opposite is true \nwhen considering Defendantsโ motion. See id. \n Eighth Amendment Standards \nThe Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits โcruel and unusual \npunishments.โ  And  a  prison  official  subjects  an  inmate  to  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment if he is (1) deliberately indifferent to (2) a substantial risk that the \ninmate will suffer (3) serious harm. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). \nTo expand on the third element first, not all the hardships of prison amount to \nserious harm. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834. In the context of medicalโor dentalโcare, \nan inmate generally establishes sufficiently serious harm in one of two ways. See \nPhillips v. Tangilag, 14 F.4th 524, 534 (6th Cir. 2021). He might show that his \nmedical  need  โis  one  that  has  been  diagnosed  by  a  physician  as  mandating \ntreatment.โ Mattox v. Edelman, 851 F.3d 583, 598 (6th Cir. 2017). Or he can show \nthat his medical need was โso obvious that even a layperson would easily recognize \n23 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15518   Filed 01/26/23   Page 24 of 77\nthe necessity for a doctorโs attention.โ Id. Either way, the harm is serious enough to \ntrigger Eighth Amendment protection. \nWhat about โsubstantial riskโ? Inmates need not wait until serious harm \nbefalls them before coming to court. In Helling v. McKinney, the plaintiffโs cellmate \nsmoked five packs of cigarettes a day. 509 U.S. 25, 28 (1993). Prison officials argued \nthat to establish an Eighth Amendment claim, the plaintiff needed to show that he \nwas โcurrently suffering serious medical problemsโ from the second-hand smoke. Id. \nat 32. The Supreme Court was not persuaded: โWe have great difficulty agreeing that \nprison authorities . . . may ignore a condition of confinement that is sure or very likely \nto cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year.โ Id. \nat 33. Thus, โsubjecting individuals to a risk of future harmโnot simply actually \ninflicting painโcan qualify as cruel and unusual punishment.โ Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. \n35, 49 (2008). But โ[t]o establish that such exposure violates the Eighth Amendment,โ \nthe risk must be โsubstantial,โ i.e., โvery likely to cause serious illness and needless \nsuffering, and give rise to โsufficiently imminent dangers.โโ Id. (quoting Helling, 509 \nU.S. at 33, 34โ35).  \nThat leaves the subjective prong of an Eighth Amendment claim. Under the \ndeliberate-indifference standard, it is not enough that a reasonable prison official in \nthe  defendantโs  position  would  have  appreciated  that  the  plaintiff  was  at  a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm. Instead, the defendant, personally, must have \nappreciated that the plaintiff was at a substantial risk of serious harm, yet, despite \nthat understanding, failed to alleviate the risk. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 \n24 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15519   Filed 01/26/23   Page 25 of 77\n(1994) (โ[T]he official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be \ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the \ninference.โ).  \nCourts  have  tailored  this  deliberate-indifference  test  for  claims  based  on \ninadequate medical care. If a doctor (or dentist or hygienist) did nothing more than \nfail to provide the treatment that an ordinary doctor would have, that negligent care \ndoes not establish deliberate indifference. Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 738 (6th \nCir. 2018); see also Rouster v. Cnty. of Saginaw, 749 F.3d 437, 447 (6th Cir. 2014) \n(โWhen a prison doctor provides treatment, albeit carelessly or inefficaciously, to a \nprisoner, he has not displayed a deliberate indifference to the prisonerโs needs, but \nmerely a degree of incompetence which does not rise to the level of a constitutional \nviolation.โ (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nThat said, too many deviations below the mean can amount to deliberate \nindifference.  See  Richmond  v.  Huq,  885  F.3d  928,  940  (6th  Cir.  2018)  (โIt  is \ninsufficient for a doctor caring for inmates to simply provide some treatment for the \ninmatesโ medical needs.โ); Griffith v. Franklin Cnty., Kentucky, 975 F.3d 554, 568 (6th \nCir. 2020). Thus, where a doctor provides treatment, but that treatment is โso grossly \nincompetent[] [or] inadequateโ that it shocks the conscience, the doctor has acted with \ndeliberate indifference. See Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 737 (6th Cir. 2018). Or \nto make the point less abstractly: if a prisoner has a severed finger, โtake two and \ncall me in the morningโ will not do. Cf. Murray v. Depโt of Corr., 29 F.4th 779, 788 \n(6th Cir. 2022). \n25 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15520   Filed 01/26/23   Page 26 of 77\n Facial Challenge to the Two-Year Rule \nThe Court begins with Bownesโ facial challenge to the two-year rule. Although \nDefendants have not made a specific request for summary-judgment on this claim, \nthey  have  asked  the  Court  to  dismiss  the  entire  case.  (See  ECF  No.  363, \nPageID.8795.) Further, because Bownes sought summary judgment on his challenge \nto the two-year rule, the issue has been fully briefed. (See ECF No. 366, PageID.9844โ\n9850; ECF No. 369, PageID.11868โ11876.) So the Court will proceed as if both sides \nhad moved for summary judgment on this claim. \n The Two-Year Rule, Standing \nOddly, Bownes raised the issue of his standing to bring a facial challenge to \nthe two-year rule, which, apparently, prompted Defendants to argue that he lacks \nstanding. (ECF No. 366, PageID.9843; ECF No. 369, PageID.11872.) As Article III \nstanding implicates this Courtโs subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court must not only \naddress the issue, but it must do so before getting to the merits. See In re Flint Water \nCases, 53 F.4th 176, 188 (6th Cir. 2022). \nBownes has the burden of proving his standing to challenge the two-year rule. \nSee Buchholz v. Meyer Njus Tanick, PA, 946 F.3d 855, 860 (6th Cir. 2020). To carry \nhis  burden  at  the  summary-judgment  stage,  he  must  show  that  a  reasonable \nfactfinder could conclude that he โ(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly \ntraceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant[s], and (3) that is likely to be \nredressed by a favorable judicial decision.โ Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \n26 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15521   Filed 01/26/23   Page 27 of 77\nAlthough Defendants say Bownes cannot meet any of these three elements, the \nCourt homes in on their assertion that the Court cannot redress Bownesโ injury from \nthe two-year rule by granting an injunction. This is true. Bownes has now served \nenough time that he is no longer subject to the two-year rule.  \nBut this is more of a mootness argument than a standing one. After all, when \nBownes joined this suit, he was still subject to the two-year rule and, at that time, an \ninjunction would have provided Bownes a few months of relief. (Compare ECF No. \n236, PageID.6263 (fourth amended complaint filed in January 2018), with ECF No. \n384, PageID.15466 (indicating that Bownes completed two years in April 2018).)  \nBut whether addressed under standing or mootness the essential point is the \nsame: Bownes is no longer subject to the two-year rule. And he seeks only forward-\nlooking, injunctive relief. So his request for relief is moot. \nTrue,  there  is  a  capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review  exception  to \nmootness. And true, the evading-review requirement appears to be satisfied here: any \ninmate who challenges the two-year rule is likely to serve two years before the \nchallenge can be fully litigated. See In re Flint Water Cases, 53 F.4th 176, 189 (6th \nCir. 2022) (noting that Supreme Court has found two years โtoo short to obtain \ncomplete reviewโ).  \nBut Bownes cannot satisfy the capable-of-repetition part of the exception. \nFirst,  he  does  not  try.  Next,  to  satisfy  that  requirement,  generally  โthe  named \nplaintiffโ must make โa reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the \nalleged illegality.โ Flint Water, 53 F.4th at 189 (emphasis added) (internal quotation \n27 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15522   Filed 01/26/23   Page 28 of 77\nmarks omitted); see also Chirco v. Gateway Oaks, L.L.C., 384 F.3d 307, 309 (6th Cir. \n2004) (providing that exception applies where there is โa reasonable expectation that \nthe same complaining party would be subjected to the same action againโ (emphasis \nadded)). Here, the only way for Bownes to be again subject to the two-year rule is if \nhe is reincarcerated following release. Bownesโ earliest release date is in 2026โbut \nhis  latest  is  in  2038.  Michigan  Offender  Tracking  Information  System,  Melvin \nBownes, https://perma.cc/B9MW-5YSV. That alone makes it somewhat doubtful that \nBownes will again face the two-year rule. But even if Bownes is released relatively \nsoon, he would have to be convicted of another crime or parole violation. This Court \nwill not lightly infer recidivism. Cf. OโShea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 497 (1974) (โ[I]t \nseems to us that attempting to anticipate whether and when these respondents will \nbe charged with crime and will be made to appear before either petitioner takes us \ninto the area of speculation and conjecture.โ). \nIn short, the Court finds that Bownesโ facial challenge to the two-year rule is \nmoot, and thus, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over that claim. See \nLibertarian Party of Ohio v. Blackwell, 462 F.3d 579, 584 (6th Cir. 2006) (โ[A] federal \ncourt has a continuing duty to ensure that it adjudicates only genuine disputes \nbetween adverse parties. . . . The mootness inquiry must be made at every stage of a \ncase.โ). \n The Two-Year Rule, Merits \nSupposing that Bownesโ facial challenge is not moot, the claim would fare no \nbetter on the merits.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15523   Filed 01/26/23   Page 29 of 77\nIn fact, Bownesโ argument starts off on entirely the wrong track. He saysโand \nDefendants agreedโthat a facial challenge to a prison regulation should be analyzed \nunder Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987). (ECF No. 366, PageID.9844; ECF No. 369, \nPageID.11868.) And so, says Bownes, the question is whether the two-year rule is \nbacked by a legitimate penological interest. (ECF No. 366, PageID.9850.) \nBut Turner alleged that prison regulations violated the First Amendment and \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, 482 U.S. at 82, 93โ94; in contrast, Bownes says the two-\nyear rule violates the Eighth Amendment. The difference matters. โAlthough the \nSupreme Court has stated broadly that the standard of review [it] adopted in Turner \napplies to all circumstances in which the needs of prison administration implicate \nconstitutional rights, Turner has been applied only where the constitutional right is \none which is enjoyed by all persons, but the exercise of which may necessarily be \nlimited due to the unique circumstances of imprisonment.โ Jordan v. Gardner, 986 \nF.2d 1521, 1530 (9th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Yet \nโEighth Amendment rights do not conflict with incarceration; rather, they limit the \nhardships which may be inflicted upon the incarcerated as โpunishment.โโ Id. Thus, \nโthe Turner analysis does not apply to Eighth Amendment claims.โ Linderman v. \nVail, 59 F. Appโx 180, 182 (9th Cir. 2003).  \nIndeed, it would be odd that in analyzing an as-applied claim based on the \nEighth  Amendment,  the  question  is  whether  the  defendant  was  deliberately \nindifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm but that in analyzing a facial claim \nbased on the same text, the question changes  to  whether  there  is  a  legitimate \n29 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15524   Filed 01/26/23   Page 30 of 77\npenological interest for the prisonโs rule. See Bucklew v. Precythe, โ U.S. โ,139 S. \nCt. 1112, 1127โ28 (2019) (explaining, in the context of addressing a facial challenge \nbased on the Eighth Amendment, that the type of challenge โdoes not speak at all to \nthe substantive rule of law necessary to establish a constitutional violationโ). \nSo, under the proper standard, Bownes would need to show that MDOCโs two-\nyear rule violates the Eighth Amendment in all its applications. See United States v. \nSalerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (โA facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, \nthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish \nthat no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.โ); Payne v. \nSevier Cnty., Tennessee, 681 F. Appโx 443, 447 (6th Cir. 2017) (applying Salerno to \ncounty policy of permitting nurses to diagnose detainees); City of Los Angeles, Calif. \nv. Patel, 576 U.S. 409, 415 (2015) (applying Salerno to city code). \nThe Court is hard pressed to see how Bownes could make such a showing. \nGiven the many thousands of inmates subject to the two-year rule, surely there are a \nsignificant number who have no or only very minor dental problems and whose host \nfactors favor very slow progression. While these โdentally fitโ inmates might still \nprefer treatment like a cleaning or a filling, Bownes has not shown that they are at \nโsubstantialโ risk of โseriousโ harm during their two- or three-year wait for routine \ncare. In fact, in the context of addressing Class IIBโs claims below, the Court reaches \na very similar conclusion. \nAccordingly, even if Bownesโ challenge to the two-year rule were not moot, it \nwould almost certainly fail on the merits. \n30 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15525   Filed 01/26/23   Page 31 of 77\n Periodontitis Treatment Claim (Class IIC) \nBy definition, all members of Class IIC have some stage of periodontitis. As \nsuch,  each  member  potentially  requires  a  scaling  and  root  planing  or,  at  least, \nperiodontitis maintenance. Yet, according to the members of Class IIC, MDOC does \nnot provide scaling and root planing or the associated follow-up care. Accordingly, in \ntheir view, Defendants are deliberately indifferent to their periodontitis. And because \nthey believe that untreated periodontitis is serious harm or at least places them at a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm, they claim that MDOCโs failure to provide them \nwith scaling and root planing and the associated follow-up care violates their Eighth \nAmendment rights \n Class IIC, Deliberate Indifference \nThe  Court  begins  with  the  subjective  prong:  are  Defendants  deliberately \nindifferent to its inmatesโ periodontitis? \nThe members of Class IIC believe the answer is โyesโ and direct the Court to \ntheir expertsโ opinions. As noted, Shulman reviewed the dental records of 100 MDOC \ninmates and found that 61 of those were diagnosed with periodontitis at a complete \nor periodic exam. (ECF No. 315-11, PageID.8020.) Yet, says Shulman, the treatment \nplans for those inmates never included scaling and root planing; instead, MDOC \ndentists would prescribe a โprophy.โ (ECF No. 315-11, PageID.8020.) Or in his words: \nโTreatment plans for prisoners assessed with periodontal disease rarely include \nperiodontal treatment other than oral prophylaxis . . . . [A]nd while a dentist may \ntreatment plan a patient for a prophy (and not prescribe scaling and root planing), \n31 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15526   Filed 01/26/23   Page 32 of 77\nmy record review shows that dental hygienists often perform โperiodontal scaleโ sua \nsponte.โ (ECF No. 384, PageID.15377.) But Shulman also concedes, โIn my chart \nreviews, I often could not tell for certain from the clinical narrative, what periodontal \nprocedure was performed.โ (ECF No. 384, PageID.15428, 15470.) Harrel, also one of \nPlaintiffsโ experts, similarly opines, โThe term โperio scalingโ as it appears in some \nMDOC dental records is not routinely used in dentistry and is not contained in the \nCDT. Perio scaling does not accurately describe [scaling and root planing].โ (ECF No. \n366-2, PageID.9867.) Harrel further says, โ[the periodontal therapy provided by \nMDOC] is either inadequate or undocumented because the documentation does not \ntell me what was done. . . . I donโt know what perio scale is because that is not a \nrecognized form of documentation. Did they do root planing? They didnโt say.โ (ECF \nNo. 366-3, PageID.9961; see also ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9873.) \nAs this Court understands it, Shulman and Harrel essentially opine that \nMDOC dentists either (1) do not prescribe scaling and root planing to inmates with \nperiodontitis  (but  sometimes  hygienists  perform  that  procedure  anyway)  or  (2) \nprescribe scaling and root planing but improperly document that procedure as โperio \nscaleโ or โprophyโ or โdebridement.โ \nIn their reply brief, Defendants essentially take the position that Plaintiffsโ \nevidence is stale. (See ECF No. 379, PageID.13884.) As noted, beginning in 2020, \nMDOC started using the Corrections Offender Management System (COMS). And \nwith this change, MDOC dental staff began using the terminology and codes that are \nused in private practice, namely the Current Dental Terminology codes. And as part \n32 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15527   Filed 01/26/23   Page 33 of 77\nof their reply brief, Defendants produced the results of a query of the COMS database. \nThe query results show that from January 2020 to October 2022, MDOC hygienists \n(and sometimes dentists) have โcompletedโ over 900 scalings and root planings. (ECF \nNo. 379-1, PageID.14368โ14447.) \nThis new evidence substantially undermines Class IICโs claim of indifference. \nDental records from before MDOC implemented COMS are the foundation of their \nargument. According to Plaintiffsโ experts, those records rarely (if ever) used the term \nโscaling and root planing.โ And so Plaintiffsโ experts inferred that either MDOC was \nnot  providing  that  treatment  or,  at  minimum,  MDOCโs  documentation  was \nsubstandard. Indeed, Plaintiffs concede that they โrelied on the prior dental record \nsystem.โ (ECF No. 380-2, PageID.14598.) Thus, COMS introduced a crack in the \nfoundation of Plaintiffsโ theory: MDOCโs dental records now use CDT terminology \nand codes, including the codes for scaling and root planing, and the dental records \nnow expressly state, โD4341 Perio Scaling & Root Planing.โ (See e.g., ECF No. 379-1, \nPageID.14375.) \nUnfortunately for Defendants, while ultimately the COMS data (with some \nadditional supplementation) will likely win the day for them, it does not win the day \nfor them at the summary-judgment stage. To appreciate why, a bit of procedural \nhistory is in order. \nIn  their  opening  summary-judgment  brief,  Defendants  asserted,  โMDOC \ncontinues to treat periodontal diseases through providing oral hygiene instruction, \nprophylaxis[,] scaling and root planing, and providing extractions when necessary.โ \n33 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15528   Filed 01/26/23   Page 34 of 77\n(ECF No. 363, PageID.8838.) Yet that statement was not backed by a citation to the \nrecord.  (See  id.)  True,  Defendants  did  cite  evidence  of  โthousands  of  hygiene \nappointmentsโ (id. at PageID.8836), but they did not cite evidence of scaling and root \nplaning, specifically. Plaintiffs caught this, and asserted in their response brief, \nโDefendants offer no citation to depositions, dental records or manual to support its \nclaim that MDOC provides scaling and root planing.โ (ECF No. 374, PageID.12748.) \nThat prompted Defendants to attach the COMS data to their reply brief. \nAnd that spawned additional motion practice. (ECF Nos. 380, 381, 383.) To \nspare the details, Plaintiffs essentially say that Defendants have impermissibly \nintroduced  new  evidence  for  the  first  time  in  a  reply  brief  (ECF  No.  380-2, \nPageID.14598) and, in any event, this evidence should have been handed over in \ndiscovery  but  was  not  (ECF  No.  380-2,  PageID.14602โ14603;  ECF  No.  383, \nPageID.14665โ14666). Plaintiffs thus ask the Court to disregard the COMS data. \n(ECF No. 380-2, PageID.14597, 14606.) \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Defendants should not be able to use the \nCOMS  data  to  prevail  at  the  summary-judgment  stage.  To  start,  other  than  a \nreference  to  a  declaration  attaching  a  spreadsheet  that  identifies  COMS  data, \nDefendants did not discuss the COMS data, and in particular the number of recent \nscalings and root planings, in their opening brief. Sure, a defendant seeking summary \njudgment usually does not have to produce evidence to discharge its initial burden; it \nusually only has to show that the plaintiff lacks evidence supporting his or her claim. \nBut here, Defendants opted to affirmatively argue that they provided treatment for \n34 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15529   Filed 01/26/23   Page 35 of 77\nperiodontitis. So they probably should have directed Plaintiffs to the backup for that \nargument. See Mirando v. U.S. Depโt of Treasury, 766 F.3d 540, 548 (6th Cir. 2014) \n(โWhen new submissions and/or arguments are included in a reply brief, and a \nnonmovantโs ability to respond to the new evidence has been vitiated, a problem \narises with respect to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c).โ (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). \nMore troubling is the fact that Defendants did not produce the COMS data (or \nsomething similar) during the very lengthy discovery period. True, as Defendants \nsay, the switch to COMS was mentioned during many depositions. Indeed, during his \ndeposition, Choi explained, โ[W]e used to use terms โperio scaling,โ โprophy,โ and \nโscaling and root planingโ interchangeably. . . . Now with the new system, . . . we are \nfollowing the CDT code. . . . Now with the new system we do not have such a term \nlike โperio scale.โโ (ECF No. 374-9, PageID.13079โ13080.) That testimony should have \ntipped Plaintiffs off: after January 2020, MDOCโs dental records would have included \nthe CDT code for scaling and root planing if the procedure had been performed. Yet, \nas far as the Court can tell, Plaintiffs never specifically asked Defendants for a log \nshowing how many times the โscaling and root planingโ code had been used. In other \nwords, Plaintiffs did not adapt their case, which seeks forward-looking relief, to the \ncurrent MDOC practice. On the other hand, the COMS data may ultimately allow \nDefendants to prevail on one of the central claims in this case; so Defendants should \nhave supplemented their initial disclosures with those results (or like data). See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) (requiring the initial disclosure of information a party may use \n35 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15530   Filed 01/26/23   Page 36 of 77\nโto support its . . . defensesโ); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1) (requiring supplementation of \ninitial disclosures). \nIn sum, because the COMS data was attached to Defendantsโ reply brief, and \nbecause Defendants did not produce the COMS data during discovery, the Court will \nnot consider that data in deciding whether Defendants are entitled to summary \njudgment. \nThe question remains, though, have Defendants shown that every reasonable \nfactfinder would conclude that they are not indifferent to periodontitis? Without the \nCOMS data, the answer is โno.โ Defendantsโ opening brief only relied on โthousands \nof hygiene appointments annually,โ yet those are not necessarily scalings and root \nplanings. (See ECF No. 363, PageID.8836.) And it was reasonable for Shulman and \nHarrel to infer that because the term โscaling and root planingโ was not in the dental \nrecords they reviewed, MDOC might not be consistently providing that treatment. \nTrue, the dental records did include the terms โprophyโ or โperio scale,โ and Choi did \ntestify that prior to COMS, MDOC dental staff used โprophylaxis,โ โdebridement,โ \nand โperio scaleโ interchangeably and that each term could include a scaling and root \nplaning. (ECF No. 374-9, PageID.13074, 13079.) But Shulman also opined that he \nrarely saw local anesthesia prescribed in connection with prophylaxis or โperio scaleโ \nand that local anesthesia would typically be provided for a scaling and root planing. \n(ECF No. 384, PageID.15470.) Accordingly, absent the COMS data, a reasonable \nfactfinder could conclude that MDOC dental staff was not consistently providing \nscaling and root planing to inmates with periodontitis. See Williams v. Sutley, No. \n36 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15531   Filed 01/26/23   Page 37 of 77\n120302, 2014 WL 12967583, at *6 (C.D. Cal.

Cal. Apr. 1, 2014). \nIn advocating for a different result, Defendants cite several cases where courts \nfound that, as a matter of law, the defendant was not deliberately indifferent to the \nplaintiffโs periodontal disease. \nNone of these authorities are binding, and all addressed a different claim than \nthe one Class IIC pursues. The members of Class IIC claim that scaling and root \nplaning is necessary to treat their periodontitis, and yet, Defendants are not ensuring \nthat  MDOC  dental  staff  provide  that  necessary  treatment;  therefore,  say  these \ninmates, Defendants are indifferent to their periodontitis. Not one of the cases cited \nby Defendants addresses a similar claim. Instead, they largely address a dentistโs use \nof  medications  or  extractions  to  treat  pain  and  infection  caused  by  periodontal \ndisease. See Sands v. Cheesman, 339 F.

Oct. 2, 2006) (finding dentist not \nindifferent  to  inmateโs  tooth  pain  and  infection  from  periodontal  disease  where \ndentist  prescribed  pain  killers  and  antibiotics  and  ultimately  recommended \nextraction). None of these cases addressed a claim of indifference to periodontitis \nbecause dentists did not prescribe scaling and root planning and the associated \nfollow-up care. \nWilliamson v. Correctional Medical Services, another case cited by Defendants, \nis a bit closer to the mark. The plaintiff there sought an โorder requiring CMS to \nprovide standard dental treatment for periodontal diseaseโ and asserted that โCMS \nrefuses to treat active perio-infections and, when it did provide teeth cleaning, the \nprocess was substandard.โ Williamson v. Corr. Med. Servs., No. CIVA 06-379-SLR, \n2007 WL 2698256, at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 11, 2007). Perhaps the plaintiffโs request for \nthe โstandard dental treatment for periodontal diseaseโ includes a request for scaling \nand  root  planing.  Still,  Williamson  does  not  discuss  scaling  and  root  planing \nspecifically, and the evidentiary record in Williamson did not include multiple experts \nopining that scaling and root planing is necessary treatment for periodontitis. \nIn short, Defendantsโ authorities are not persuasive given the evidentiary \nrecord in this case. \nBefore turning to the objective prong, the Court addresses two loose ends \nregarding the subjective prong. Recall that Class IIC consists of all inmates with \n38 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15533   Filed 01/26/23   Page 39 of 77\nearly, moderate, or advanced periodontitis or, simply, all inmates with periodontitis. \nThat condition unites the members of Class IIC. But the two-year rule divides them. \nIn fact, the Eighth Amendment claim of those still under the two-year rule differs in \ntwo significant ways from the Eighth Amendment claim of those who have served two \nyears. \nFirst, unlike those who have served two years, it appears that there is no \ndispute that those who are subject to the two-year rule do not receive scaling and root \nplaning  (unless  it  is  part  of  urgent  care).  As  discussed,  MDOCโs  Dental  Policy \nDirective and Dental Services Manual classify โperiodontalโ procedures as โroutineโ \ndental  care.  That  means  that  as  a  matter  of  written  policy,  those  who  have \nperiodontitis but have not served two years do not receive scaling and root planing. \nAnd, as noted, practice bears this out. Maxwell, an intake dentist, states that inmates \ndiagnosed with active periodontitis at intake are not referred to the stabilization \nclinic for scaling and root planing. (ECF No. 363-5, PageID.8987, 8989.) And Stout, a \nhygienist who has done stints at the stabilization clinic, states that she only performs \ndebridements there, not scalings and root planings. (ECF No. 374-7, PageID.12862.) \nSecond, for members of Class IIC who are still under the two-year rule, the \nevidence of deliberate indifference differs.  \nIn April 2018, Choi, MDOCโs Dental Director, authored a memo to four dental \nsupervisors about treating periodontitis. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9504โ9505.) Choi \nwrote, โBased on the experience and research of the dentists on the [Dental Advisory \nBoard] and the presentation to [the Board] from Dr. Jeff Johnston, . . . it was \n39 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15534   Filed 01/26/23   Page 40 of 77\nacknowledged that periodontitis is generally a slowly developing immune response \ncondition[.]โ (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9504.) (Yes, the same Johnston that now \nserves as Defendantsโ expert in this case.) Choiโs memo continued, โThe slow rate of \nprogression of periodontitis, when coupled with appropriate self-care, means that as \na practical matter, there is no harm done by not specifically treating, beyond self-\ncare, early stage periodontal conditions during the first two years of incarceration.โ \n(ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9504.) โSimilarly,โ Choi wrote, โmoderate periodontitis, if \nstable with self-care, will not require intervening dental care in the first two years of \nincarceration to prevent the condition from becoming advanced.โ (Id.) On the other \nhand, โsome moderate periodontitis conditions are not stable at the time of the \nprisonerโs intake screening exam. . . . [U]nstable moderate periodontal condition \nshould be identified for stabilization care sufficient to attempt to change the condition \nfrom unstable to stable.โ (Id.) Finally, as to inmates with advanced periodontal \ndisease, Choiโs memo explained that these inmates โhave experienced too much bone \nloss to save the affected tooth or teethโ and recommended extraction โto reduce the \nrisk of infection and eliminate the source of the immune system provocation.โ (Id.) \nChoiโs memo goes a fair way toward showing that his (or the Dental Advisory \nBoardโs) decision not to treat periodontitis with scaling and root planing during an \ninmateโs  first  two  years  of  incarceration  was  not  the  result  of  indifference  to \nperiodontitis. To the contrary, it appears to have been the result of reasoned, medical \njudgment. To be sure, Plaintiffsโ experts strongly disagree that periodontitis is ever \nstable. (ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9875; ECF No. 366-3, PageID.9966.) And even if \n40 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15535   Filed 01/26/23   Page 41 of 77\nChoiโs  โstable  moderateโ  category  is  valid,  Plaintiffsโ  experts  argue  that  MDOC \ndentists  cannot  accurately  place  inmates  into  that  category  given  the  lack  of \nperiodontal probing and bitewing x-rays. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15419.) But all of \nthat sounds a lot like proof that Choi (or the Board) is falling short of the standard of \ncare  for  periodontitis,  not  that  they  are  indifferent  to  the  disease.  Or  stated \ndifferently, while Choi and the Boardโs approach to periodontitis may not be based on \nsound dental science, the proper question is whether Choi and the Board, personally, \nunderstand that their approach places inmates at substantial risk of serious harm \nfrom periodontitis, yet, despite that understanding, choose to pursue it anyway. See \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). \nThat said, a final determination as to Choiโs indifference must be deferred to \ntrial. Defendants did not even mention Choiโs memo in their summary-judgment \nmotion. And had Defendants raised the memo, perhaps Plaintiffs could have argued \nthat Choiโs approach to periodontitis treatment during an inmateโs first two years of \nincarceration  is  โso  grossly  incompetent[]  [or]  inadequateโ  that  it  shocks  the \nconscience. See Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 737 (6th Cir. 2018). After all, Harrel \nopines that it is โvery unlikelyโ that moderate periodontitis is stable and that there \nis no situation where it is acceptable to delay treatment of periodontitis for two years. \n(ECF No. 366-3, PageID.9966, 9969.) And even Defendantsโ expert, Johnston, states \nthat in his practice, he would never delay periodontitis treatment for two years. (ECF \nNo.  366-6,  PageID.10702โ10703.)  Most  persuasive,  though,  is  that  during  his \ndeposition, Choi admitted that moderate periodontitis requires scaling and planing \n41 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15536   Filed 01/26/23   Page 42 of 77\nand even admitted that early periodontitis requires scaling and planing. (ECF No. \n363-10, PageID.9281โ9282.) In other words, Choiโs testimony is arguably contrary to \nhis memo. Accordingly, Choiโs memo does not warrant summary judgment. \nThe second loose end relates to the COMS data. While the Court will not \nconsider that evidence at this stage of the case, it makes sense to consider it at trial. \nAs Defendants correctly state, this case is about prospective, injunctive relief. (ECF \nNo. 379, PageID.13884.) So what matters is not whether MDOC dental staff failed to \nprovide or document scaling and root planing in the past. What matters is whether \nthey are doing so now and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. After all, \nthe Court is not going to order MDOC to provide a treatment that it is already \nproviding.  And  the  COMS  data  bears  directly  on  whether  MDOC  is  currently \nproviding scaling and root planing. \nSo the Court will permit Defendants to use the COMS data (and any similar \nevidence that they produce to Plaintiffs) at the bench trial in this case. Until then, \nthe Court will have the parties engage in limited discovery on the extent that MDOC \nis providing scaling and root planing and periodontitis maintenance to inmates with \nperiodontitis. As it stands, the COMS data shows 900 scalings and planings. But does \nthat cover 90% of the inmates who needed the procedure? Or only 30%? The former \nindicates little indifference to periodontitis, the latter not so much. Accordingly, some \nadditional discovery is in order. The Court will detail the discovery process at the end \nof this opinion. \n42 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15537   Filed 01/26/23   Page 43 of 77\nIn sum, without the COMS data, Defendants have not shown that every \nreasonable factfinder would conclude that they are not deliberately indifferent to \ninmatesโ periodontitis. \n Class IIC, Substantial Risk of Serious Harm \nAside from arguing that they were not deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffsโ \nperiodontitis, Defendants also argue that periodontal disease, by itself, is not a \nserious medical need. They say that โthe case law establishes a high standardโ: โ[o]nly \nwhere periodontal disease presents with other symptoms and reaches an acute stage \ndoes it constitute a serious medical condition.โ (ECF No. 363, PageID.8830.) โOn its \nown,โ they argue, โperiodontal disease simply does not satisfy the Eighth Amendment \nstandard.โ (Id.) The law is not so clear. \nTo be sure, there are cases that state, โperiodontitis is not a serious medical \nneed.โ Moore v. Parham, No. 1:16CV1519, 2017 WL 4118458, at *5 (E.D. Va. Mar. 23, \n2017). Coward v. Clarke, No. 7:20CV00702, 2022 WL 1018407, at *2 (W.D. Va. Apr. \n5, 2022) (โ[A] diagnosis of periodontitis does not in itself create a serious medical \nneed[.]โ (internal quotation marks omitted)). \nBut there are also cases saying that โperiodontal disease or gingivitis . . . is a \nserious  medical  condition  which  is  manifested  by  the  loss  of  teeth.โ  Board  v. \nFarnham, 394 F.3d 469, 483 n.7 (7th Cir. 2005); Rucano v. Koenigsmann, No. 9:12-\nCV-00035, 2014 WL 1292281, at *10 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2014) (โDefendants concede \nthat periodontal disease is a serious medical condition, and we agree.โ). \n43 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15538   Filed 01/26/23   Page 44 of 77\nIn  this  Courtโs  opinion,  it  all  depends.  Remember  Jessica,  the  healthy, \nfastidious-oral-hygiene inmate with very early periodontitis? If she does not receive \nscaling and root planning for say, two-and-a-half years, she probably will only suffer \nminimal alveolar bone and ligament loss. So she probably is not at a substantial risk \nof serious harm during the two-and-a-half-year period. But what about Michael, the \nunhealthy, poor-oral-hygiene inmate with moderate periodontitis? If he goes without \nscaling and root planning for two-and-a-half years, his moderate periodontitis will \nquite likely reach the advanced stage with the attendant risk of abscess or tooth loss. \nSo  his  periodontitis  (coupled  with  the  two-year  rule)  probably  places  him  at  a \nsubstantial risk of serious harm. (See ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10803โ10804; cf. ECF \nNo. 374-9, PageID.13158 (Choi agreeing that an inmate can go from normal gums to \nmoderate periodontitis in two years). Or to say all this another way, there are quite \nlikely some inmates with periodontitis that due to their individual or โhostโ factors, \nhave a good chance of avoiding the worst the disease has to offer. But others in Class \nIIC will not be so fortunate. And virtually anyone who has experienced an abscess \nknows it is a serious medical need. See also MDOC Dental Service Manual (eff. Dec. \n19, 2017) (providing that โ[t]ooth or soft tissue abscess with infectionโ qualifies for \nโurgentโ or โemergencyโ services); Coward v. Clarke, No. 7:20CV00702, 2022 WL \n1018407, at *7 (W.D. Va. Apr. 5, 2022) (โ[P]eriodontal inflammation around one or \nmore teeth that reaches an acute stage may be considered โa serious medical need.โโ). \nIn any event, โif a plaintiff suffer[s] from a minor or non-obvious medical \ncondition, he can show that his condition was objectively serious โif it is โone that has \n44 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15539   Filed 01/26/23   Page 45 of 77\nbeen diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment.โโ Mattox v. Edelman, 851 \nF.3d 583, 598 (6th Cir. 2017). Here, Shulman, a dentist, has opined that periodontitis \nrequires treatment. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15384 (โUntreated, [periodontitis] could \nprogress, and the affected dentition may be lost.โ); ECF No. 384, PageID.15425 \n(โ[Scaling and root planing] is the standard of care for non-surgical treatment of \nperiodontal disease.โ).) Even Choi admits that a patient with periodontitis requires \nscaling and planing. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9281โ9282.) And, by definition, the \nmembers of Class IIC all have periodontitis. So under the would-a-doctor-mandate-\ntreatment test, there is at least a genuine dispute over whether the members of Class \nIIC have a serious medical need. \nAll that said, the Court agrees with Defendants to some extent. Quite likely \nthere are inmates in Class IIC who are not now experiencing serious harm and are \nnot even at a substantial risk of experiencing serious harm in the foreseeable future. \nSo the Court agrees with Defendants that a mere diagnosis of periodontitis does not, \nby itself, establish a substantial risk of serious harm. The problem, though, is neither \nparty  has  attempted  to  draw  a  tenable  dividing  line  between  those  whose \nperiodontitis does expose them to a substantial risk of serious harm and those whose \nperiodontitis does not. And because there are a significant number of people in Class \nIIC who a reasonable factfinder could conclude are at a substantial risk of serious \nharm, the Court sees no basis to grant summary judgment on Class IICโs claims. \nIndeed, neither party seeks partial summary judgment. And while Class IIC is \n45 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15540   Filed 01/26/23   Page 46 of 77\nperhaps not cohesive enough to meet Rule 23โs requirements, neither party has \nsought to redefine the class, either. \nIn sum, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that a significant number of \npeople in Class IIC are at a substantial risk of serious harm. So summary judgment \nis not warranted on the objective prong, either. \n Class IIC, Representativeโs Claims \nIn a similar vein, Defendants argue that Plaintiff Anthony Richardson, who \nrepresents Class IIC, and Plaintiff Melvin Bownes who, along with Richardson, \nrepresent Class IIA and Class IIB, โhave failed to show that they have suffered from \na serious medical need.โ (ECF No. 363, PageID.8833.) According to Defendants, \nโWhile both Bownes and Richardson have been diagnosed with periodontal disease, \nneither complains of pain related to their periodontal condition or any other side \neffects or symptoms that would cause their condition to become serious.โ (Id.) \nEven if Defendants are correct that Bownes and Richardson have not actually \nsuffered  serious  harm  attributable  to  their  periodontal  disease,  a  reasonable \nfactfinder could still conclude that MDOCโs treatment of their disease placed them at \na โsubstantial riskโ of serious harm. \nStart with Richardson. In spring 2017, he was diagnosed with โmoderateโ \nperiodontitis, and the calculus on his teeth was also โmoderate.โ (ECF No. 363-16, \nPageID.9698.) Yet the dental record indicates that Richardson was only given a \nโprophyโ and that his teeth were โ[s]caled and polishedโ; no local anesthesia is \nindicated. (ECF No. 363-16, PageID.9698.) About 18 months later, in fall 2018, \n46 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15541   Filed 01/26/23   Page 47 of 77\nRichardson was diagnosed with โmoderate advancedโ periodontitis with โmoderate \nheavyโ calculus. (ECF No. 363-16, PageID.9699.) Again, only a โprophyโ was provided \nand there is no indication that local anesthesia was used. (Id.) Those data points \nsupport an inference that Richardson needed, but was not provided, scaling and root \nplaning. And while that certainly does not mean that Richardson suffered serious \nharm, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that without scaling and root planing, \nhe was at a โsubstantial riskโ of serious harm. See Flanory v. Bonn, 604 F.3d 249, 255 \n(6th Cir. 2010) (โIn Helling, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected โpetitionersโ central \nthesis that only deliberate indifference to current serious health problems of inmates \nis actionable under the Eighth Amendment.โโ). \nNow consider Bownes. At his intake exam, he was diagnosed with โmoderateโ \nperiodontitis with โheavyโ calculus. (ECF No. 363-13, PageID.9628.) Yet Bownes was \nnot sent to the stabilization clinic. (See id.; ECF No. 363, PageID.8818.) Bownes did \nend up receiving a scaling and root planing but given the two-year rule, not until two-\nand-half years after his intake diagnosis.  (ECF No. 363-13, PageID.9635.) Although \nHarrel concedes that โsome people progress rapidly, some people progress slowly,โ he \nalso opines that โif you have moderate [periodontitis], itโs going to progress almost \nassuredly  more  quickly.โ  (ECF  No.  366-3,  PageID.9964.)  Johnston,  Defendantsโ \nexpert,  similarly  opines  that  in  his  practice,  he  would  not  let  a  patient  with \nperiodontitis go untreated for two years. (ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10702โ10703.) \nThus, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that toward the end of this two-and-half-\nyear period, Bownes was at โsubstantial riskโ of his periodontitis advancing to the \n47 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15542   Filed 01/26/23   Page 48 of 77\npoint of abscess or tooth loss. Accordingly, Defendants have not shown that, as a \nmatter of law, Bownes was not subjected to a substantial risk of serious harm.1 \n Periodontitis and Caries Diagnosis Claim (Class IIA) \nUnlike Class IICโs challenge to MDOCโs dental treatment, the members of \nClass IIA challenge MDOCโs dental diagnoses. In particular, the members of Class \nIIA, all of whom have periodontitis or caries that have reached the dentin, assert that \nMDOCโs failure to conduct periodontal probing and charting at any point during their \nincarceration, and MDOCโs failure to take bitewing x-rays during the intake exam, \nviolate the Eighth Amendment. Although the members of Class IIA believe that \nprobing, charting, and bitewing x-rays are necessary to establish a baseline so that \ndisease progression can be tracked over time, it appears that their primary concern \nis that without those diagnostic tools, their disease is at a substantial risk of being \nunderdiagnosed. For instance, because MDOC does not perform periodontal probing, \nan inmate with early periodontitis might be underdiagnosed with gingivitis. And, say \nthe members of Class IIA, underdiagnosis risks undertreatment. \nIn seeking summary judgment, Defendants have addressed the claims of Class \nIIA, Class IIB, and Class IIC together. (See ECF No. 363, PageID.8826 (arguing that \nprisoners in โClasses IIAโCโ have not established an Eighth Amendment claim).) And \nthe Court has already addressed Class IICโs claims. But, having studied the record, \n \n1 The Court reiterates that Plaintiffs seek prospective relief, so to the extent \nthat Bownes and Richardson may have in the past been exposed to a substantial risk \nof serious harm may not be a proper basis for seeking that relief. This was not \nadequately addressed in the summary-judgment briefing and thus, the Court expects \nthat it will be addressed during trial. \n48 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15543   Filed 01/26/23   Page 49 of 77\nthe Court believes that Class IIAโs claims materially differ from Class IICโs claims \nsuch that they should have been addressed separately. So the Court will do so below. \n Class IIA, Substantial Risk of Serious Harm \nFirst consider Defendantsโ argument that periodontitis, in and of itself, is not \na serious medical need. (ECF No. 363, PageID.8827โ8831.) Because Class IIA seeks \nimproved diagnostic techniques (as opposed to treatment), the proper question is \nwhether MDOCโs current method of diagnosing periodontitis and caries exposes the \nmembers of Class IIA to a substantial risk of serious harm. \nA simple thought experiment reveals the answer. Given the many thousands \nof inmates in Class IIA, there must be hundreds who have (1) early periodontitis and \n(2) host factors for rapid progression. For convenience, call one of these inmates \nโChristopher.โ The evidence suggests that at Christopherโs first complete exam, \nMDOC  dental  staff  will  not  perform  periodontal  probing.  (See  ECF  No.  384, \nPageID.15421; ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9326.) Yet Shulman and Harrel are adamant \nthat periodontitis cannot be accurately diagnosed without periodontal probing. (ECF \nNo. 374-8, PageID.12953 (Shulman); ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9859, 9923 (Harrel).) \nThus, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that there is a substantial risk that at \nChristopherโs first complete exam, he will be diagnosed with merely gingivitis when, \nin fact, he has early periodontitis. (See ECF No. 366-9, PageID.11461โ11462 (MDOC \ndentist Mark Cooks agreeing that without probing and bitewing x-rays, a patient \nwith early periodontitis might be diagnosed as having only gingivitis); ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15376 (Shulman opining that the lack of probing โresults in underdiagnosis \n49 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15544   Filed 01/26/23   Page 50 of 77\nof  periodontal  diseaseโ);  see  also  ECF  No.  384,  PageID.15385  (similar).)  And  if \nChristopher is underdiagnosed with gingivitis, he will not be scheduled for a scaling \nand root planingโthat treatment is reserved for periodontitis. (See ECF No. 366-6, \nPageID.10802.) This is especially problematic for Christopher given that he is one of \nthe members of Class IIA who has host factors favoring rapid progression. Thus, a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude that before Christopherโs next annual exam, \nthere is a substantial risk that his periodontitis will progress from early periodontitis \nto advanced periodontitis. (ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9872 (Harrel opining that โthe \nsystem wide lack of periodontal probing and charting in millimeters . . . is [a] practice \nbelow  the  standard  of  care  subjecting  inmates  to  risk  of  serious  harm,  tooth \nmorbidity,  and/or  mortalityโ);  ECF  No.  366-3,  PageID.9945  (similar).)  Yet,  if \nChristopher had been properly diagnosed, his early periodontitis could have been \narrested before advancing. \nA  similar  point  can  be  made  for  members  of  Class  IIA  who  have  caries. \nShulman opines that โdecay that has reached the dentin can be diagnosed using \nbitewing  x-rays  while  it  is  not  visible  on  a  panoramic  x-ray.โ  (ECF  No.  384, \nPageID.15401.) And both Shulman and Harrel are adamant that a panoramic x-ray \nwill only pick up โvery pronouncedโ interproximal caries (cavities between teeth). \n(ECF  No.  374-8,  PageID.12935;  ECF  No.  366-3,  PageID.9914.)  And  Johnston, \nDefendantsโ expert, agrees that interproximal caries will not show up on a panoramic \nx-ray unless they are โgross.โ (ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10785.) Yet, at intake, MDOC \nonly takes panoramic x-rays. (ECF No. 363-5, PageID.9158 (Maxwell), ECF No. 363-\n50 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15545   Filed 01/26/23   Page 51 of 77\n10, PageID.9324โ9325.) Thus, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that at intake, \nthere is a substantial risk that many inmatesโ moderate, interproximal caries will be \nmissed. Further, assuming that these inmates have host factors for rapid caries \nprogressionโwhich, undoubtedly numerous people in Class IIA haveโthere is a \nsubstantial risk that these inmatesโ moderate, interproximal caries will advance to \nthe pulp before their first bitewing x-rays in two-plus years. And once caries reach \nthe pulp, abscess or tooth loss is likely, especially given that MDOC does not provide \nroot canals. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15379 (โWhen decay reaches the pulp, the tooth \nwill  require  either  endodontic  (root  canal)  treatment  or  extractionโ).)  Thus,  a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude that many in Class IIA with cariesโfor example, \nthose  who  have  moderate,  interproximal  caries,  who  have  factors  for  rapid \nprogression, and who are still under the two-year ruleโare at a substantial risk of \nserious harm due to MDOCโs failure to take bitewing x-rays at intake.  \nIn  fact,  taking  the  evidence  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  Plaintiffs,  a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude that this very thing happened to Bownes. A \nreview of Bownesโ electronic dental record indicates that at his intake exam, where \nonly a panoramic x-ray was used, he was not diagnosed with caries.  (See ECF No. \n363-13, PageID.9628.) Yet, at his first complete exam, which included bitewing x-\nrays,  he  was  diagnosed  with  โgrossโ  interproximal  caries.  (ECF  No.  363-13, \nPageID.9632.) But by that point, the caries had progressed, and Bownes required a \ntooth extraction. (See ECF No. 363-13, PageID.9632.) Take the facts in the light most \n51 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15546   Filed 01/26/23   Page 52 of 77\nfavorable to Plaintiffs, a reasonable inference is that Bowens had caries at the time \nof intake, but the panoramic x-ray did not reveal them, i.e., he was underdiagnosed. \nIn short, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that for numerous members of \nClass IIA, MDOCโs failure to perform periodontal probing and charting at any point \nduring their incarceration, and MDOCโs failure to take bitewing x-rays during their \nintake exam, exposes them to a substantial risk of serious harm. \nThat said, as with Class IIC, the Court agrees with Defendants that, quite \nlikely, there are members of Class IIA who are not at a substantial risk of serious \nharm  from  MDOCโs  diagnostic  methods.  But,  again,  none  of  the  parties  have \nattempted to draw dividing lines. And, again, none of the parties have sought to \nredefine Class IIA more narrowly. No party seeks partial summary judgment, either. \nAnd given that there are likely hundreds of inmates in Class IIA who a reasonable \nfactfinder could conclude are at a substantial risk of serious harm from MDOCโs \ndiagnostic methods, the Court will not sua sponte revisit the Rule 23 requirements. \n Class IIA, Deliberate Indifference \nAs to the other prong of an Eighth Amendment claim, Defendants invoke the \nfamiliar line of cases where courts concluded that a plaintiffโs mere disagreement \nwith her medical providerโs treatment does not establish deliberate indifference. See \ne.g., Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 740 (6th Cir. 2018) (โAn inmateโs disagreement \nwith the testing and treatment he has received . . . does not rise to the level of an \nEighth Amendment violation.โ). Defendants point out that MDOC dentists use visual \ninspection, oral-health history, and a panoramic x-ray to diagnose periodontitis and \n52 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15547   Filed 01/26/23   Page 53 of 77\ncaries at intake. (ECF No. 363, PageID.8838.) Although Plaintiffs maintain that \nprobing and bitewing x-rays are needed to accurately diagnose periodontitis and \ncaries, in Defendantsโ view, this is a mere disagreement with how MDOC diagnoses \nthose diseases. (See id.) And, say Defendants, an inmateโs mere disagreement with a \ndiagnostic method is not an Eighth Amendment claim. (See id.) \nAlthough neither party has paid it enough attention, in this Courtโs view, \nChoiโs testimony is critical to answering the indifference question. Choi is MDOCโs \nDental Director, and between the two defendants, it is Choi who is much more \nresponsible for developing policies about probing, charting, and bitewing x-rays. (See \nECF No. 363-10, PageID.9253, 9255, 9435.) \nSo  what  did  Choi  say  at  his  deposition?  Choi  explained  that  he  has  not \nrecommended that MDOC implement a policy of periodontal probing and charting \nbecause he โd[id] not see the needโ for it; in his view, โit is not . . . absolutely necessary \nfor  [MDOC  dental  staff]  to  measure  each  pocket  depth.โ  (ECF  No.  363-10, \nPageID.9293.) Choi further explained, โWhat we have been doing for our patient[s] \nin terms of periodontal evaluation, just taking the x-ray, looking at the radiograph, \nthat  is  adequate  method  or  ways  of  providing  the  service.โ  (ECF  No.  363-10, \nPageID.9294.) And when asked if inmates are at a substantial risk of harm because \nintake dentists only perform a visual inspection and take a panoramic x-ray, Choi \nresponded, โ[t]here is minimal harm.โ (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9322.) Indeed, Choi \nโ[did] not agreeโ that periodontal disease would be understated because the intake \ndentists did not use probing and bitewing x-rays. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9336.) \n53 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15548   Filed 01/26/23   Page 54 of 77\nChoi even went so far as to say that it would not violate the standard of care in private \npractice to assess a patientโs periodontal status without probing and bitewing x-rays. \n(ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9297โ9298.) In short, Choi believes that probing is not \nnecessary to assess periodontal disease. And it appears that Choi further believes \nthat bitewing x-rays are not necessary to assess periodontal disease. \nThat gets Defendants a long way towards summary judgmentโat least on \nClass IIAโs challenge to MDOCโs diagnosis of periodontitis (as opposed to caries). This \nis not a dental-malpractice case. So proof that an objectively reasonable dentist would \nprobe and take bitewing x-rays to stage or diagnose periodontitis is not enough. \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976) (โ[A] complaint that a physician has been \nnegligent in diagnosing . . . a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical \nmistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Medical malpractice does not become a \nconstitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner.โ). What matters is \nwhether  Choi,  personally,  appreciates  that  without  probing  or  bitewing  x-rays, \ninmates are at a substantial risk of an improper periodontitis diagnosis and thus, are \nat a substantial risk of their disease progressing to the point of serious harm. See \nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). But Choiโs testimony indicates just the \nopposite: he believes that visual inspection, oral-health history, and a panoramic x-\nray suffice for a periodontal assessment. Indeed, Choi believes there is โminimal \nharmโ from assessing periodontitis that way. \nThat said, if a medical professional makes โa decision that represents such a \nsubstantial departure from accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards, \n54 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15549   Filed 01/26/23   Page 55 of 77\nas to demonstrate that [he] actually did not base the decision on such a judgment,โ it \nis reasonable to infer deliberate indifference. Jackson v. Kotter, 541 F.3d 688, 697 \n(7th  Cir.  2008).  Thus,  a  medical  professionalโs  treatment  decisions  will  not  be \naccorded deference if โno minimally competent professional would have so responded \nunder those circumstances.โ Id. at 698 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also \nGriffith v. Franklin Cnty., Kentucky, 975 F.3d 554, 568 (6th Cir. 2020) (providing that \na prisoner might show deliberate indifference by establishing that his medical care \nwas โso woefully inadequate as to amount to no treatment at allโ). \nHere, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Choiโs beliefs about MDOCโs \nability to assess particular cases of periodontitis deviates so far from the standard of \ncare, that it bespeaks of indifference to those cases.  \nConsider  the  evidence.  According  to  Shulman,  โperiodontal  probing  has \nbeen . . . the standard of care for ages, for 30 years as far as I can remember, maybe \nlonger, and it is beyond dispute that it is the standard of care. You cannot diagnose \nperiodontal disease without probing. . . . [P]robing is a sine qua non.โ (ECF No. 374-\n8, PageID.12953.) And Harrel similarly opines that there are no situations where \nperiodontitis  could  be  accurately  diagnosed  without  probing.  (ECF  No.  366-2, \nPageID.9859;  see  also  id.  at  PageID.9923.)  Even  Johnston,  Defendantsโ  expert, \nadmits that the โminimumโ diagnostic process involves probing. (ECF No. 366-6, \nPageID.10680, 10765, 10784โ10785 (testifying that the standard of care requires \nprobing).) And Mark Cooks, an MDOC dentist, believes that without probing and \nbitewing x-rays, it is more likely than not that periodontitis will be understated. (ECF \n55 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15550   Filed 01/26/23   Page 56 of 77\nNo. 366-9, PageID.11530.) Moreover, other departments of corrections, including the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons and departments that have emerged from class actions, \nperform some type of periodontal probing. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15382 & nn.19, 20, \nPageID.15396.) Choi himself admits that in dental school, he was not taught that a \nvisual inspection and panoramic x-ray were all that was needed to assess periodontal \ndisease, and he further admits to probing and charting in his own private practice. \n(ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9297, 9324โ9325, 9444.) \nTaking all this evidence together, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that \nthe universal standard, i.e., what even a half-decent dentist would do, is to perform \nperiodontal probing to diagnose periodontitis. As such, a reasonable factfinder could \nconclude that any method of diagnosing periodontitis that does not involve probing is \nsuch a deviation from the professional norm that the decision to use such a method \nwas not based on medical judgment but, instead, indifference. \nTrue, for many cases of periodontitis (and caries), it is quite likely that visual \ninspection, oral-health history, and panoramic x-ray are adequate for assessing the \ndisease or, at least, that approach would not expose inmates to a substantial risk of \nserious  harm.  In  fact,  although  it  was  unclear  if  he  was  referring  to  caries  or \nperiodontitis, Johnston opines that โmoderate to advanced cases requiring urgent \ncare can be easily recognized and diagnosed with panoramic images.โ (ECF No. 363-\n8, PageID.9220.) And so for many cases of periodontitis, Choiโs subjective belief that \nMDOC is adequately assessing periodontitis is probably not โsuch a substantial \ndeparture  from  accepted  professional  judgment,  practice,  or  standards,  as  to \n56 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15551   Filed 01/26/23   Page 57 of 77\ndemonstrate that [he] actually did not base the decision on such a judgment,โ Jackson \nv. Kotter, 541 F.3d 688, 697 (7th Cir. 2008). \nBut the Court is not yet convinced that Choi truly believes that MDOCโs \ndiagnostic methods are sufficient for some hard-to-diagnose cases of periodontitis or \ncaries. For instance, in the absence of probing, some early-stage periodontitis may be \ndiagnosed as gingivitis, resulting in the inmate not being prescribed scaling and root \nplaning. (See ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10800 (Johnston agreeing that a panoramic x-\nray might not show bone loss associated with early periodontitis).) And, as discussed, \nit appears to be undisputed that a panoramic x-ray will not reveal early or moderate \ninterproximal caries. \nIn  all,  while  Choiโs  testimony  goes  a  long  way  toward  establishing  that \nMDOCโs failure to use bitewing x-rays (at intake) and failure to perform periodontal \nprobing and charting (at any time) is not attributable to deliberate indifference to \nperiodontitis, the Court prefers a more complete record of Choiโs state of mind. In \nparticular, as the ultimate finder of fact in this case, the Court would like more \ntestimony on whether, for certain hard-to-diagnose cases of periodontitis and caries, \nChoi appreciates that MDOCโs method of diagnosing the disease risks not identifying \nits presence, and if he does, whether he further appreciates that a missed diagnosis \nrisks the disease advancing to the point of serious harm. \n Class IIA, Representativesโ Claims \nHereโalthough  neither  party  has  taken  care  to  do  soโBownesโ  and \nRichardsonโs individual claims of inadequate diagnosis must be analyzed separately \n57 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15552   Filed 01/26/23   Page 58 of 77\nfrom their individual claims of inadequate treatment (which the Court addressed \nabove). Class IIAโs claim is about diagnosis. Yet even without bitewing x-rays at \nintake or periodontal probing, MDOC dentists were still able to diagnose Bownesโ and \nRichardsonโs  periodontitis  and  caries.  Thus,  it  might  seem  that  no  reasonable \nfactfinder could find for Bownes and Richardson on their claim that MDOCโs method \nof diagnosing periodontitis and caries is constitutionally inadequate. \nBut, as discussed, Bownesโ electronic dental record indicates that he was not \ndiagnosed with caries at intake (where only a panoramic x-ray was taken), yet he was \ndiagnosed  with  โgrossโ  interproximal  caries  at  his  first  complete  exam  (where \nbitewing x-rays were taken). (ECF No. 363-13, PageID.9628โ9629, 9632.) And by the \ntime  of  Bownesโ  complete  exam,  his  tooth  was  beyond  salvaging  and  required \nextraction. (ECF No. 363-13, PageID.9632.) Thus, it is at least possible that MDOCโs \nuse of panoramic x-rays at intake exposed Bownes to a substantial risk of caries \nprogression. Yet Defendants have not addressed this possibility in their summary-\njudgment motion. \nAs for Richardson, after a long history of periodontitis, he was diagnosed with \ngingivitis in February 2019. (ECF No. 363-16, PageID.9700.) (It is unclear whether \nthe gingivitis diagnosis was because his periodontitis had been treated, whether \ngingivitis was in a different area of the mouth, or whether some of the diagnoses were \nincorrect.) It is at least possible that had probing been performed in February 2019, \nRichardsonโs gingivitis would have been more accurately diagnosed as periodontitis. \nAnd if it had been, Richardson should have been scheduled for a scaling and root \n58 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15553   Filed 01/26/23   Page 59 of 77\nplaning. So MDOCโs failure to perform periodontal probing in February 2019 may \nhave exposed Richardson to a substantial risk of serious harm. Defendants have not \naddressed this possibility in their summary-judgment motion. \nIn short, absent an argument focused on Bownesโ and Richardsonโs claims of \ninadequate diagnosis, summary judgment on those claims is not warranted. \n Class IIBโs Claims \n Class Scope and Class Claims \nBefore addressing Class IIBโs claims, it helps to both clarify the scope of the \nclass and the membersโ legal claims. \nClass IIB, as originally defined by the Court, consisted of inmates with healthy \ngums, gingivitis, early periodontitis, and stable moderate periodontitis. The Court \ndid not include inmates with more severe cases of periodontitis (unstable moderate \nor advanced) in Class IIB because, given the evidence at the time, it appeared that \nMDOC was treating those cases of periodontitis. See Dearduff v. Washington, 330 \nF.R.D. 452, 469 (E.D. Mich. 2019). \nAs the case wore on, Plaintiffs asked the Court to expand Class IIB to include \ninmates with the more severe cases of periodontitis. And given Plaintiffsโ request and \nthe evidence they cited, the Court elected to both redefine Class IIB and to create a \nnew class, Class IIC. Class IIC consisted of inmates with early, moderate, or severe \nperiodontitis, or, more simply, with periodontitis, while Class IIB was modified to \ninclude only inmates that did not have periodontitis, i.e., they had healthy gums or \n59 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15554   Filed 01/26/23   Page 60 of 77\ngingivitis. Bownes v. Washington, No. 14-CV-11691, 2021 WL 3700867, at *11 (E.D. \nMich. Aug. 20, 2021).  \nSome clarification of the scope of Class IIB and Class IIC is in order. On the \none hand, Class IIC could consist of inmates who MDOC has identified as having \nperiodontitis, with Class IIB consisting of inmates who MDOC has identified as \nhaving gingivitis or healthy gums. On the other hand, Class IIC could consist of those \ninmates who in fact have periodontitis, with Class IIB consisting of inmates who in \nfact have gingivitis or healthy gums. The Court now clarifies that Class IIB and Class \nIIC consist of the latter. This class definition is preferrable given Plaintiffsโ claims \nthat MDOC does not accurately diagnose periodontal disease. \nHaving clarified the scope of Class IIB, the Court turns to clarifying Class IIBโs \nlegal claims. When the Court redefined Class IIB, it articulated the legal claim as \nfollows: โEach [member of Class IIB] claims that he or she has a serious medical need \n(e.g., a baseline measurement or gingivitis), and that MDOCโs policy of treating that \nserious medical need (e.g., not obtaining a baseline measurement and not providing \na prophylaxis until two years in prison) amounts to deliberate indifference.โ Bownes, \n2021 WL 3700867, at *11. Although it was Plaintiffsโโnot the Courtโsโobligation to \nclearly articulate the claims of the class, the bottom line is that the claims of Class \nIIB should be stated clearly so that they can be properly adjudicated whether now or \nat trial. \nBased on the partiesโ summary-judgment briefing and the expert reports, the \nCourt believes that the members of Class IIB intended to make two types of claims. \n60 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15555   Filed 01/26/23   Page 61 of 77\nThe first claim is similar to Class IICโs claim, a treatment claim. For those in \nClass  IIB  who  have  healthy  gums  and  are  still  under  the  two-year  rule,  they \napparently claim that not being provided a prophylaxis for two to three years violates \nthe  Eighth  Amendment.  (Those  who  have  served  two  years  are  eligible  for  a \nprophylaxis on an annual basis, and the Court does not believe that any members of \nClass IIB are claiming that waiting one year for a cleaning is a concern of the \nConstitution.) For those in Class IIB who have gingivitis, they apparently claim that \nthey are not provided a treatment with CDT Code D4346, i.e., โthe removal of plaque, \ncalculus  and  stains  from  supra-and-sub-gingival  tooth  surfaces  when  there  is \ngeneralized moderate or severe gingival inflammation in the absence of periodontitis.โ \n(ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9865 (emphasis added).) For these members, MDOCโs failure \nto provide this D4346 scaling allegedly violates the Eighth Amendment. \nThe  second  type  of  claim  is  like  Class  IIAโs  claim,  a  diagnosis  claim. \nApparently, the members of Class IIB believe that they are entitled to periodontal \nprobing and charting at all their exams and bitewing x-rays at their intake exams. \nWithout these diagnostic tools, they believe they are at a substantial risk of serious \nharm. \nWith the scope of the class and the legal claims clearly defined, the Court turns \nto  analyzing  Class  IIBโs  claims.  The  Court  begins  with  the  claims  brought  by \nmembers of Class IIB with gingivitis, and then turns to the like claims brought by \nmembers of Class IIB with healthy gums. \n61 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15556   Filed 01/26/23   Page 62 of 77\n Class IIB, Members with Gingivitis \nThe claims brought by members of Class IIB with gingivitis can be divided into \na challenge to MDOCโs treatment for gingivitis and a challenge to MDOCโs diagnosis \nof gingivitis. And those claims can be still further divided depending on whether the \ninmate making the claim is still under the two-year rule. Again, the parties have \nfailed  to  address  the  issues  at  this  level  of  granularity,  but  a  proper  Eighth \nAmendment analysis demands it. \n Treatment Claims \nThe Court begins by considering the treatment claims of members of Class IIB \nwho have gingivitis and who are still under the two-year rule. All experts in this case \nagree that the proper treatment for gingivitis is good oral hygiene, smoking cessation, \nand either a prophylaxis or a gingivitis-specific cleaning (D4346). (ECF No. 242-7, \nPageID.6420  (Shulman);  ECF  No.  366-2,  PageID.9865  (Harrel  distinguishing \nprophylaxis from D4346); ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10721 (Johnston).) And it is not \ndisputed that cleanings are โroutineโ procedures, meaning that MDOC inmates are \nnot even eligible for them until they have served two years in prison and do not \nactually receive them until two-and-half or three years in prison. (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15446 (indicating that 50% of inmates wait 28 months for their first cleaning \nand that 25% of inmates wait 34 months for their first cleaning).) Thus, a reasonable \nfactfinder could conclude that inmates with gingivitis who are still under the two-\nyear rule will not receive full treatment for their gingivitis for two to three years. \n62 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15557   Filed 01/26/23   Page 63 of 77\nBut that alone does not answer the Eighth Amendment question. Instead, \nPlaintiffs must further show that not receiving full gingivitis treatment for two-and-\na-half years (1) exposes them to a substantial risk of serious harm and (2) Defendants \nknow of and are indifferent to that risk. On these two fronts, the Court doubts that \nPlaintiffs have the proofs they need. Even so, the Court will defer its final decision to \ntrial. \nStart with the objective prong. There is testimony from Defendantsโ expert \nsuggesting that untreated gingivitis will not progress to a serious harm in two-and-\na-half years. (ECF No. 363-8, PageID.9222; ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10769.) Indeed, \nit appears that an inmateโs gingivitis would have to progress from gingivitis to early \nperiodontitis  and  then  from  early  periodontitis  to  moderate  (or  advanced) \nperiodontitis before the inmate is at a substantial risk of abscess or tooth loss. In \nother words, an inmate with gingivitis is a few steps removed from serious harm. \nThat said, nothing in the record rules out a progression to serious harm in say, two-\nand-a-half years. And given that there are likely hundreds of inmates with gingivitis \nwho are still under the two-year rule, some of those inmates surely have host factors \nfor  rapid  progression.  (ECF  No.  374-8,  PageID.12943  (Shulman  testifying  that \nprogression depends on individualized factors); ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9872 (Harrel, \nsimilar);  ECF  No.  363-8,  PageID.9222  (Johnston,  similar).)  Thus,  a  reasonable \nfactfinder could conclude that there are numerous inmates with gingivitis who are \nstill under the two-year rule that are at a substantial risk of serious harm. (ECF No. \n63 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15558   Filed 01/26/23   Page 64 of 77\n384, PageID.15459 (Shulman noting Renetra Robinsonโs progression from gingivitis \nat intake to moderate periodontitis two years later).) \nThat leaves the question of Defendantsโ indifference. As with Class IIC, Choiโs \nmemo presents a considerable hurdle for Plaintiffs. Choiโs memo cited โthe research \nand experienceโ of MDOCโs Dental Advisory Board and a presentation to the Board \nby Johnston. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9504.) And the memo further stated, โThe slow \nrate of progression of periodontitis, when coupled with appropriate self-care, means \nthat as a practical matter, there is no harm done by not specifically treating, beyond \nself-care,  early  stage  periodontal  conditions  during  the  first  two  years  of \nincarceration.โ (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9504.) Although Choi was perhaps only \nexpressly talking about periodontitis, given that gingivitis is a less severe form of \nperiodontal disease, the ready inference is that he likewise believes that inmates with \ngingivitis are not at a substantial risk of serious harm if they do not receive a cleaning \nduring their first two years of incarceration. So Choiโs memo is strong evidence that \nhe is not indifferent to inmates with gingivitis who are under the two-year rule. \nBut as noted in addressing Class IICโs claim, Defendants did not rely on Choiโs \nmemo  in  seeking  summary  judgment.  So,  arguably,  Plaintiffs  had  no  reason  to \naddress it and should be given an opportunity to do so. Further, during his deposition, \nChoi agreed that a patient with gingivitis could progress to having early periodontitis \nif they are not treated for two years. (ECF No. 363-10, PageID.9348.) Choi further \nacknowledged  that  an  inmate  could  progress  from  healthy  gums  to  moderate \n64 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15559   Filed 01/26/23   Page 65 of 77\nperiodontitis in a two-year period. (ECF No. 374-9, PageID.13158.) Thus, while close, \nthe Court will not grant Defendants summary judgment on this claim. \nWhat about the members of Class IIB who have gingivitis and who have \nalready served two years? Here, the Court reaches a different result. Even setting \naside the COMS data (which might well show that the gingivitis-specific cleaning \n(D4346) is being provided), it is undisputed that inmates who have served two years \nare eligible for a prophylaxis once per year. See Dental Services Manual at 17; (ECF \nNo. 363-10, PageID.9449โ9450). Even though Harrel indicates that a prophylaxis is \nnot the same as the gingivitis-specific cleaning, both involve scaling to remove plaque \nand calculus. (ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9865โ9866.) So MDOC is providing some \ntreatment for gingivitis. And Plaintiffs have not directed the Court to evidence \nshowing that a prophylaxis annually, along with good oral hygiene (something in the \ninmateโs control), is โso grossly incompetent[] [or] inadequateโ that it shocks the \nconscience. See Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 737 (6th Cir. 2018). The most a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude is that by not providing the gingivitis-specific \ncleaning, but merely a prophylaxis annually, Choi has been negligent to inmatesโ \ngingivitis. But that does not establish deliberate indifference. See id. Accordingly, \nDefendants are entitled to summary judgment on the inadequate treatment claim \nbrought by inmates who have gingivitis and who have served two years in prison. \n Diagnosis Claims \nThe members of Class IIB with gingivitis also apparently challenge MDOCโs \nfailure to use bitewing x-rays at intake and failure to conduct periodontal probing \n65 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15560   Filed 01/26/23   Page 66 of 77\nand  charting  at  any  point  during  their  incarceration.  From  these  inmatesโ \nperspective, MDOCโs failure to probe and take bitewing x-rays places them at a \nsubstantial risk of underdiagnosis, which, in turn, places them at a substantial risk \nof not receiving needed treatment for their gingivitis. \nConceptually,  these  inmatesโ  claims  about  MDOCโs  diagnostic  techniques \ntrack  the  claims  of  Class  IIA.  The  members  of  Class  IIA,  all  of  whom  have \nperiodontitis or caries that have reached the dentin, assert that without probing and \nbitewing x-rays, their conditions risk being underdiagnosed and thus, undertreated. \nSimilarly, the members of Class IIB with gingivitis apparently maintain that without \nprobing and bitewing x-rays, they are at a substantial risk of being diagnosed with \nhealthy gums and thus, they will not receive treatment for their gingivitis. \nFactually, however, the inadequate-diagnosis claim brought by inmates with \ngingivitis is weaker than the analogous claim brought by inmates with periodontitis. \nObjectively, gingivitis is simply not as serious as periodontitis. So there is a lower \nrisk  of  serious  harm  from  underdiagnosing  gingivitis  than  underdiagnosing \nperiodontitis. (ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10769 (Johnston opining that โthereโs many \npatients  that  never  progress,  especially  in  the  gingivitis  stagesโ).)  Subjectively, \nalthough Choi may have only been referring to periodontitis, he testified that he \nbelieves that MDOCโs diagnostic methodsโvisual inspection, oral-health history, \nand panoramic x-rayโare sufficient to perform a periodontal evaluation. (ECF No. \n363-10, PageID.9294โ9295, 9297โ9298, 9336.) True, in addressing Class IIAโs claim, \nthe Court held that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that even a โhalf-decentโ \n66 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15561   Filed 01/26/23   Page 67 of 77\ndentist would perform probing to diagnose periodontitis. But it appears that probing \nto diagnose gingivitis is less universal. In particular, Johnston opines that even in \nprivate practice, the standard of care would permit a dentist to not probe a patient \nwith gingivitis for two years. (See ECF No. 366-6, PageID.10770, 10810โ10811.) \nAccordingly, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the claim brought by \nmembers of Class IIB with gingivitis who claim that MDOCโs failure to perform \nprobing or take bitewing x-rays at intake amounts to deliberate indifference to \ngingivitis.    \n Class IIB, Members with Healthy Gums \n Treatment Claims \nInmates who do not have gingivitis or periodontitis, i.e., inmates who have \nhealthy gums, are also part of Class IIB. Apparently, these inmates also bring claims \nof inadequate treatment and inadequate diagnosis. \nThe Court begins with treatment. Because these inmates have healthy gums, \nit appears that the only โtreatmentโ they seek is a standard cleaning or prophylaxis. \nHistorically, most new inmates waited around two-and-half years (or a bit longer) for \ntheir first prophylaxis. (ECF No. 384, PageID.15446.) Thus, for members of Class IIB \nwith healthy gums, this is the pertinent question: are they at a substantial risk of \nserious harm because they do not receive a cleaning for two-and-half years? On this \nrecord, every reasonable factfinder would answer โno.โ  \nTrue, as with other examples this Court has given, there are likely inmates \nwith healthy gums whose host factors make them particularly susceptible to rapid \n67 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15562   Filed 01/26/23   Page 68 of 77\nperiodontal  disease  progression.  Indeed,  among  the  dental  records  Shulman \nreviewed, only two inmates, Cody Ray and Reginald Harbin, were diagnosed as \nhaving healthy gums (โWNLโ or โwithin normal limitsโ) at intake. Yet, by the time of \ntheir  first  complete  exam  over  two  years  later,  Ray  had  โgeneralized  moderate \nperiodontal diseaseโ and Harbin had โmoderate/mildโ periodontitis with โclass 2 \nmobilityโ on one tooth and the prognosis for that tooth was โpoor/fair.โ (ECF No. 384, \nPageID.15444, 15467.)  \nBut at least in Rayโs case, it appears that he did not practice good oral hygiene. \n(ECF No. 374-9, PageID.13158 (Choi discussing Ray); ECF No. 374-3, PageID.12763โ\n12765 (Rayโs electronic dental record).) And Defendants cannot be faulted for that. \nIn any event, Rayโs and Harbinโs cases merely show that it is possible for an \ninmate with healthy gums to progress to a serious periodontal disease in two-and-\nhalf years. But the Eighth Amendment does not deal in possibilities. Instead, a \nโsubstantialโ risk in the Eighth Amendment context is one that is โvery likely to cause \nserious  illness  and  needless  suffering,  and  give  rise  to  โsufficiently  imminent \ndangers.โโ Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35, 49 (2008). Plaintiffs have not directed the Court \nto sufficient evidence that an inmate with healthy gums who practices good oral \nhygieneโsomething within the inmateโs controlโis โvery likelyโ to experience an \nabscess, tooth loss, or other serious harm because they do not receive a cleaning for \ntwo-and-half years. (See ECF No. 374-8, PageID.12943โ12944 (Shulman stating that \nthere is no typical amount of time for periodontal disease progression and that it \ndepends on host factors).) \n68 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15563   Filed 01/26/23   Page 69 of 77\nIn short, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the claim that they \nare violating the Eighth Amendment by not providing healthy inmates with a dental \ncleaning for two-and-half years. \nAnd to the extent that healthy inmates who are not subject to the two-year rule \nbring a similar claim, the Court notes that they are entitled to cleanings every year. \nBecause these inmates will receive cleanings more frequently than those subject to \nthe two-year rule, they are at even less risk of serious harm. It follows then, that \nDefendants are entitled to summary judgment on these inmatesโ treatment claim as \nwell. \n Diagnosis Claims \nNow consider members of Class IIB with healthy gums who claim that MDOCโs \nmethod of diagnosing periodontal disease violates their Eighth Amendment rights. \nInmates with healthy gums are at the bottom of the periodontal disease ladder. So \nunlike an inmate with gingivitis who, due to the lack of probing and bitewing x-rays, \ncan be underdiagnosed as having healthy gums, inmates with healthy gums cannot \nbe underdiagnosed. \nWhy, then, do inmates with healthy gums claim that they are at risk of harm \nabsent  probing,  charting,  and  bitewing  x-rays?  Like  inmates  with  periodontal \ndisease, these inmates believe that probing and charting and bitewing x-rays are \nnecessary  to  establish  their  baseline  periodontal  health.  That  way,  when  their \nperiodontal health is assessed in the future, there is a point of comparison, which, in \nturn, allows the dentist to gauge disease progression. \n69 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15564   Filed 01/26/23   Page 70 of 77\nSome evidence backs their position. For instance, Harrel opines, โ[Periodontal \ndisease] progression varies and for that reason, the standard of care requires dental \npractitioners to make comparisons over time using the original baseline derived from \nperiodontal probing and charting and intra-oral x-rays and comparing those objective \nresult[s] with subsequent periodontal probing and charting and intra-oral x-ray \nresults.โ (ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9872.) \nWhile the โstandard of careโ may require that patients with healthy gums \nreceive  probing,  charting,  and  bitewing  x-rays,  the  proper  question  is  whether \ninmates with healthy gums are at a substantial risk of serious harm if they do not \nreceive probing, charting, and bitewing x-rays. Plaintiffs have not directed the Court \nto any evidence that would permit a reasonable factfinder to answer that question \naffirmatively. Harrel did not equate the โstandard of careโ with Eighth Amendment \nstandards. (See ECF No. 366-2, PageID.9857.) And while Harrel did use Eighth \nAmendment terminology in opining that โ[t]he MDOCโs admitted failure to require \nperiodontal probing and charting is below the standard of minimum care placing all \nMDOC inmates at risk of serious harm of tooth morbidity and/or mortalityโ (ECF No. \n366-2, PageID.9871), this blanket statement is not tailored to inmates with healthy \ngums. And it appears much more important for inmates with periodontal disease to \nhave their pocket depths recorded so that dentists can gauge how fast the disease is \nprogressing. But inmates with healthy gums, by definition, do not have periodontal \ndisease that can progress. \n70 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15565   Filed 01/26/23   Page 71 of 77\nAccordingly, to the extent that inmates with healthy gums claim that their \nEighth Amendment rights are violated because they do receive periodontal probing, \ncharting, and bitewing x-rays, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. \n Class IIB, Representativesโ Claims \nAs noted, Defendants argue that Bownesโ and Richardsonโs dental records do \nnot reflect any serious medical need attributable to their periodontal condition. (ECF \nNo. 363, PageID.8832โ8833.) And so Defendants seek dismissal of Bownesโ and \nRichardsonโs individual claims.  \nThis Court has twice addressed this argument in the context of Class IIAโs and \nClass IICโs claims. Although Bownes and Richardson also are representatives of Class \nIIB, and although there are material, factual differences between the claims brought \nby Class IIA (periodontitis diagnosis), Class IIC (periodontitis treatment), and Class \nIIB  (gingivitis  treatment  and  diagnosis),  the  Court  is  not  inclined  to  address \nDefendantsโ  argument  a  third  time.  As  stated,  Defendants  have  not  separately \nanalyzed the claims of Class IIA, Class IIB, and Class IIC. Further, both Bownes and \nRichardson challenge MDOCโs failure to provide scaling and root planing (treatment) \nand failure to probe, chart, and use bitewing x-rays (diagnosis). Those challenges are \nanalogous to the challenges brought by members of Class IIB with gingivitis. \n Denture Claim (Class III) \nThe members of Class III challenge the time it takes for MDOC to provide \ndentures to inmatesโthey say it takes too long. See Bownes v. Washington, No. 14-\nCV-11691, 2021 WL 3700867, at *11 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 20, 2021). \n71 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15566   Filed 01/26/23   Page 72 of 77\nDefendants say things have changed in the nine years this case has been \npending. For instance, MDOC implemented โDentTrak,โ a database that tracks a \ndenture from start to finish. (ECF No. 363, PageID.8840.) According to Defendants, \nproviding an inmate with dentures involves seven steps and six shipments. (ECF No. \n363, PageID.8841.) As such, they say a 180-day time-to-completion is reasonable, and \nthat in the year preceding February 28, 2022, they hit that mark 83% of the time. \n(ECF No. 363, PageID.8841.) For these and other reasons, Defendants say they are \nentitled to summary judgment on Class IIIโs claim. \nIn their response to Defendantsโ summary-judgment motion, Plaintiffs use the \nword โdentureโ exactly once. (ECF No. 374, PageID.12743.) They make no argument \nin support of Class IIIโs claim. They do not dispute that a 180-day time-to-completion \nis reasonable or that MDOC is hitting that mark at an 83% clip. Even in their own \nmotion for summary judgment, dentures are mentioned only in the most cursory way. \n(ECF No. 366, PageID.9817.) \nBecause  Plaintiffs  have  opposed  other  aspects  of  Defendantsโ  summary-\njudgment motion but have not opposed Defendantsโ arguments about dentures, Class \nIII, and its representative, James Gunnels, have abandoned their claims. See Brown \nv. VHS of Michigan, Inc., 545 F. Appโx 368, 372 (6th Cir. 2013) (โ[A] plaintiff is \ndeemed to have abandoned a claim when a plaintiff fails to address it in response to \na motion for summary judgment.โ). Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants \nsummary judgment on Class IIIโs and Gunnelโs claims. \n72 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15567   Filed 01/26/23   Page 73 of 77\n Brownellโs Urgent Care Claim \nThe members of Class IVB challenged the time it took for MDOC to provide \nurgent care. By stipulation of the parties, Class IVBโs claim was dismissed. (ECF No. \n346, PageID.8486.) Apparently believing that this stipulation did not encompass the \nclaims of Class IVBโs representative, Timothy Brownell, Defendants seek summary \njudgment on Brownellโs individual claims. (ECF No. 363, PageID.8849โ8850.) \nAs with Class III claims, Plaintiffs have not opposed Defendantsโ arguments \non Brownellโs claims. According, the Court will grant Defendants summary judgment \non Brownellโs individual claims. \n Plaintiffsโ Motion for Summary Judgment \nSo far, the Court has largely focused on Defendantsโ motion for summary \njudgment. But Plaintiffs seek summary judgment too. \nUltimately, Plaintiffs have the burden of proving their Eighth Amendment \nclaims. That means to win summary judgment, Plaintiffs must show that even when \ntaking the facts in the light most favorable to Defendants, every reasonable factfinder \nwould find for them. See Surles v. Andison, 678 F.3d 452, 455โ56 (6th Cir. 2012); \nHotel 71 Mezz Lender LLC v. Natโl Ret. Fund, 778 F.3d 593, 601 (7th Cir. 2015). \nPlaintiffs have not carried this burden. What has been said so far probably \nmakes this apparent. But as a double check, the Court highlights a few points made \nearlier. \nThe members of Class IIA claim inaccurate diagnosis of their periodontitis and \ncaries. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that MDOCโs diagnostic methods are \n73 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15568   Filed 01/26/23   Page 74 of 77\naccurate for at least some easy-to-identify cases of periodontitis and caries. (See ECF \nNo.  366-10,  PageID.11730  (MDOC  dentist  Smith  testifying  that  she  can  often \ndiagnose periodontitis by visual inspection and panoramic x-rays); ECF No. 366-6, \nPageID.10784  (Johnston  testifying  that  it  is  โpossibleโ  to  diagnose  advanced \nperiodontitis with only visual inspection and panoramic x-ray).) Moreover, Plaintiffs \nhave not addressed Choiโs repeated statements that he believes that visual inspection \nand  a  panoramic  x-ray  suffice  to  evaluate  periodontitis.  (ECF  No.  363-10, \nPageID.9293-9294, 9297โ9298, 9322, 9336.) Indeed, Plaintiffsโ motion consists of \npage after page of deposition testimony that probing and bitewing x-rays are the \nstandard for diagnosing periodontitis, but Plaintiffs make little effort to map these \nfacts  onto  the  elements  of  an  Eighth  Amendment  claim.  (See  ECF  No.  366, \nPageID.9852โ9853.) So the Court will not grant Plaintiffs summary judgment on \nClass IIAโs claims. See Hotel 71 Mezz Lender LLC v. Natโl Ret. Fund, 778 F.3d 593, \n601 (7th Cir. 2015) (โWhere, as here, the movant is seeking summary judgment on a \nclaim as to which it bears the burden of proof, it must lay out the elements of the \nclaim, cite the facts which it believes satisfies these elements, and demonstrate why \nthe record is so one-sided as to rule out the prospect of a finding in favor of the non-\nmovant on the claim.โ). \nThe members of Class IIC claim inadequate treatment for their periodontitis. \nBut, as explained, for those past the two-year mark, COMS data suggests that MDOC \nis providing scalings and root planings. And, as discussed, Defendants should have \nthe opportunity to present that data at trial because this case is about prospective \n74 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15569   Filed 01/26/23   Page 75 of 77\ninjunctive relief. So members of Class IIC past the two-year mark are not entitled to \nsummary judgment. For those within the two-year window, Choiโs memoโright or \nwrongโsuggests that he is not indifferent to their periodontitis. Plaintiffs have not \naddressed Choiโs memo, and even though Plaintiffsโ experts disagree with the memo, \nthe evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to Defendants at the summary-\njudgment stage. So to the extent that Plaintiffs have sought summary judgment on \nClass IICโs claims (which their motion does not even make clear), their request will \nbe denied. \nThat leaves Class IIB. The Court has granted Defendants summary judgment \non the claims brought by members of this class with healthy gums. As for Class IIB \nmembers with gingivitis, Plaintiffs have not specifically argued that inmates with \ngingivitis are, as a matter of law, at a substantial risk of serious harm and further, \nthat Choi is indifferent to that harm. And the Court believes that a reasonable \nfactfinder could find that two to three years without treatment is not a substantial \nrisk of serious harm for some inmates with gingivitis (e.g., those with good oral \nhygiene and host factors favoring slow progression). And a reasonable factfinder could \nfind that Choi is not indifferent to at least those inmatesโ gingivitis. As for diagnosis, \na reasonable factfinder could likewise conclude that many inmates with gingivitis \nwho are underdiagnosed with healthy gums are not at a substantial risk of serious \nharm or, if they are, Choi is not indifferent to that risk. \nAccordingly, the Court will deny Plaintiffsโ motion for summary judgment. \n75 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15570   Filed 01/26/23   Page 76 of 77\n Conclusion and Order \nFor the reasons given, the Court DENIES Plaintiffsโ motion for summary \njudgment (ECF No. 366). Plaintiffsโ motion to file a sur-reply (ECF No. 380) is \nGRANTED to the extent that the Court did not consider the COMS data in addressing \nDefendantsโ motion for summary judgment. \nFurther, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendantsโ \nmotion for summary judgment (ECF No. 363) as follows: \n๏ท  Bownesโ facial challenge to the two-year rule is DISMISSED; \n๏ท  Class  IIAโs  Eighth  Amendment  claim  based  on  inadequate  diagnosis  of \nperiodontitis and caries will proceed to trial; \n๏ท  The inadequate-treatment claim under the Eighth Amendment brought by \nmembers of Class IIB with gingivitis who have not yet served two years will \nproceed to trial, but the same claim brought by members of Class IIB with \ngingivitis who have served two years will be DISMISSED; \n๏ท   The inadequate-diagnosis claim under the Eighth Amendment brought by \nmembers of Class IIB with gingivitis will be DISMISSED; \n๏ท  The inadequate-diagnosis and inadequate-treatment claims under the Eighth \nAmendment brought by members of Class IIB with healthy gums will be \nDISMISSED; \n๏ท  Class  IICโs  Eighth  Amendment  claim  based  on  inadequate  treatment  of \nperiodontitis will proceed to trial; \n76 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 387, PageID.15571   Filed 01/26/23   Page 77 of 77\n๏ท  Class IIIโs and James Gunnelsโ claim based on MDOCโs provision of dentures \nis DISMISSED; and \n๏ท  Timothy  Brownellโs  claim  based  on  MDOCโs  provision  of  urgent  care  is \nDISMISSED. \nThe parties are to complete a 90-day period of discovery that will close on April \n30, 2023. Defendants are to produce to Plaintiffs COMS data that Defendants intend \nto use at trial. As noted, the Court expects the trial proofs to reflect how often scalings \nand root planings are being performed. More probative than a pure count of the \nnumber of procedures would be data showing the number of times the treatment was \nprovided as compared to the number of times the treatment was needed. Additionally, \nit would be useful to separate data for inmates subject to the two-year rule, and those \nwho are not subject to that rule. Defendants are to produce the evidence they intend \nto use at trial to Plaintiffs on or before March 15, 2023. (The data provided need not \nbe in the exact format that Defendants will use it at trial.) Plaintiffs then have until \nApril 30, 2023 to conduct a two-hour deposition of one witness, with the scope of the \ndeposition limited to the discovery Defendants produced. If either side chooses to \nsupplement their expert reports based on the COMS data, they must provide the \nopposing side with the supplement on or before April 30, 2023. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated: January 26, 2023 \n \n     \n          s/Laurie J.

Plaintiff JOEY DEARDUFF, 732738 (hereafter Dearduff) is/was at \nall times relevant a prisoner confined with the Michigan Department of Corrections \n(hereafter MDOC) who sought dental care that was denied or delayed in violation \nof  the  Eighth  Amendment.  In  December  2013,  Dearduff  requested  dental \n\t 1\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6264   Filed 01/14/18   Page 2 of 38\ntreatment  including  partial  dentures  (โpartialsโ)  due  to  the  pain  that  he  was \nsuffering, but was denied partials and other treatment deemed to be routine because \nhe failed to meet the policy of being confined at least 24-months. In June 2015 \nwhen his 24-months wait was completed, Dearduff requested a dental examination \nso he could receive partial dentures due to the pain he suffered. He was informed \nthat he was โplaced on a list.โ Dearduff has continued to suffer pain and is unable \nto masticate food, eat hard foods or chew due to the loss of teeth extracted by \nagents of the Defendant and their refusal to provide partials and timely routine \ntreatment.  \n2.  Plaintiff NICHOLAS BAILEY, 970872 (hereafter Bailey) is/was at \nall times relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that \nwas  denied  or  delayed  in  violation  of  the  Eighth  Amendment.1  Upon  his \nimprisonment  in  October  2016,  Bailey  wrote  dental  that  he  needed  dentures \nbecause  he  had  no  teeth  and  could  not  eat  properly.  He  was  denied  dentures \nbecause he had not been confined for 24-months. \n3.  Plaintiff  TIMOTHY  BROWNELL,  656313  (hereafter  Brownell), \nis/was at all times relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental \ncare that was denied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Starting in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1 Bailey had filed in the Western District of Michigan. This case was transferred to \nthe Eastern District of Michigan and I believed was to be consolidated with this \nmatter. It has not yet been consolidated. \n\t 2\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6265   Filed 01/14/18   Page 3 of 38\nJanuary 2017, Brownell brought to the attention of the dental that he had a bad \ntoothache and he had not received a cleaning for approximately 16 or 17 months. \nHe was placed on the routine wait list and was informed that he would be called \nout when it was his turn. Over the next 6 to 7 months, Brownell submitted almost \nweekly kites informing dental that he was in pain, part of a tooth filling broke off, \nand  more  of  that  filling  broke  off.  He  saw  the  dentist  in  May  2017  and  was \ninformed that his condition had deteriorated such that he now needed root canal, \nbut the MDOC does not provide such. Brownell was told that the only thing that \ncould be done was extraction of the tooth. \n4.  Plaintiff MELVIN BROWNES, 172387 (hereafter Brownes), is/was \nat all times relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care \nthat was denied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In March 2016, \nBrownes begin his incarceration with MDOC.  Once he arrived at the first prison, \nhe  sought  a  routine  dental  exam,  so  he  could  receive  a  treatment  plan  and \nappropriate treatment. He was informed he could not receive routine dental care, \nincluding cleaning, until he had been imprisoned for 24-months. At the intake \ndental examination, Brownes was diagnosed with moderate  periodontal disease \n(โperioโ) and heavy calculus and he was denied appropriate treatment because he \nhad not been imprisoned for at least 24-months. This failure to treat allowed his \nperiodontal disease to become worst and created other dental issues. \n\t 3\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6266   Filed 01/14/18   Page 4 of 38\n5.  Plaintiff  TIMOTHY  FLESSNER,  703698  (hereafter  Flessner), \nis/was at all times relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental \ncare that was denied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In August \n2016, Flessner was confined with MDOC and requested dental care. He sought the \nrepair  of  two  teeth  by  dental  staff.  It  was  determined  that  one  tooth  was \nsalvageable  but  due  to  Flessner  not  having  completed  the  24-months \nimprisonment, no work could be done on that salvageable tooth. As a result of the \n19-month delay in providing dental care, tooth #29 deteriorated such that it was not \nsalvageable. Further, on April 14, 2017, Flessner was informed that when his 24-\nmonths were up in two months he could kite to have the tooth repaired. If he kited \nin two-months, Flessner would then have been placed on a waiting list for cleaning \nand  then  another  waiting  list  for  the  actual  dental  care  needed.  The  grievance \nresponder told Flessner that an outside dentist could repair these teeth if he could \npay for that care. \n6.  Plaintiff JAMES GUNNELS, 186011 (hereafter Gunnels), is/was at \nall times relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that \nwas denied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In October 2016, \nGunnels entered the prison system and he sought dentures because he had no \nteeth. He was denied any dental services as to his request for dentures because he \nhad not yet been imprisoned for 24-months. Gunnels informed dental staff that he \n\t 4\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6267   Filed 01/14/18   Page 5 of 38\nwas in great pain and suffering, which resulted from his inability to masticate food. \nHe was told to kite back on or after October 22, 2018.  \n7.  Plaintiff  LEON  MEANS,  131310  (hereafter  Means),  is/was  at  all \ntimes relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that was \ndenied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In July 2015, Means \narrived at the MDOC edentulous and promptly requested care because he was in \npain and his gums were torn from trauma resulting from chewing. He was told that \nhe had to complete 24-months of imprisonment, and he could then submit a kite for \ndental care. While at Saginaw Prison in 2015, he again requested dentures and a \nmechanical  soft  diet  but  was  again  told  to  wait  to  complete  24-months \nimprisonment to received these services. \n8.  Plaintiff JOHN PORTER, 154033 (hereafter Porter), is/was at all \ntimes relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that was \ndenied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In May 2017, prison staff \nbroke Porterโs upper and lower dentures. Porter sought to have these replaced but \ndental refused to replace based on the dental policy that dentures can only be \nreplaced every five years and he had received those dentures in November 2014. \nAfter he received the dentures and up to them being broken by prison staff, Porter \nhad  four  additional  teeth  removed,  which  would  have  prevented  the  broken \ndentures from being repaired due to poor occlusion. The dentist stated that the \n\t 5\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6268   Filed 01/14/18   Page 6 of 38\ndentures were denied not because Porterโs partial edentulism did not constitute a \nserious medical need but because of dental policy that limited new dentures to \nevery five years. \n9.  Plaintiff KENNETH REEVES, 717138 (hereafter Reeves), is/was at \nall times relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that \nwas denied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In January 2017, \nReeves was incarcerated. At the intake examination it was determined that he had \nearly periodontal disease and treatment of this disease will not be provided until \nafter a dental cleaning.  Reeves sought a dental cleaning but was told that he can \nkite  in  January  2019  for  such  care  after  he  had  completed  the  24-months \nimprisonment.  \n10.  Plaintiff  ANTHONY  RICHARDSON,  235980  (hereafter \nRichardson), is/was at all times relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who \nsought  dental  care  that  was  denied  or  delayed  in  violation  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment.  In  February  2014,  Richardson  was  diagnosed  with  moderate \nperiodontal disease. He sought treatment but none was provided. In February 2016, \nRichardson asked for treatment for pain in his teeth and requested periodontal \ntreatment  but  was  denied.  On  or  about  June  9,  2016,  Richardson  requested \ntreatment for pain in his upper teeth. The Step-two grievance response states that \nRichardson โrequest โtreatment for periodontal disease (and) cavity filling โ no \n\t 6\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6269   Filed 01/14/18   Page 7 of 38\nextraction.โโ This grievance response goes on to state the only treatment offered \nRichardson by the dentist was extraction. The dentist stated, โgrievant has been \ndiagnosed with periodontitis of the affect teeth (molars #1 & 2). Extraction of the \nteeth has been recommendation by the dentist.โ Richardson suffered pain in his \nteeth and gums and in the area of his molars and abscesses in his gums. When \nengaged in flossing, Richardsonโs gums would bleed. Over time, if periodontal \ndisease is not treated, the bone that supports the teeth may deteriorate and the \nprisoner  is  subjected  to  further  dental  issues.  Defendant  has  a  policy  and/or \npractice of not providing care to those with periodontal diseases. Based on the \nnature  of  periodontal  disease,  it  is  common  knowledge  among  dentists  that \nperiodontal disease should be treated timely or it may progress and cause other \ndental issues. \n11.    Plaintiff CARL ROMAN, 250050 (hereafter Roman), is/was at all \ntimes relevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that was \ndenied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In January 2017, Roman \nwas  incarcerated  with  the  MDOC.  Dental  staff  determined  that  he  had  early \nmoderate periodontal disease. Roman sought dental care, including a cleaning to \ndeal  with  the  diagnosis  of  early  periodontal  disease.  Due  to  his  not  being \nimprisoned for at least 24-months at the time of his request, MDOC refused to \nprovide  any  dental  care  deemed  to  be  routine.  Roman  was  told  to  kite  after \n\t 7\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6270   Filed 01/14/18   Page 8 of 38\n1/19/2019 to receive dental care.  Due to Roman not being imprisoned for 24-\nmonths when he sought a dental cleaning, no exam was provided to him by the \ndentist, no treatment plan was treated, and he wan not provided treatment for his \nearly periodontal disease. \n12.  Plaintiff BRYAN SLONE, 296250 (hereafter Slone) is/was at all time \nrelevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that was \ndenied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. In February 2014, Slone \nsought dental care for a broken tooth that was painful but was denied permanent \nrestoration due to the 24-months imprisonment wait policy. Due to Defendantsโ \npolicy,  the repair of a fractured tooth is considered routine care, and thus, Slone \nhad to suffer and endure tooth pain for at least the 24-months wait, or agree to \nextraction of the restorable fractured tooth.  Such a policy subjects prisoners to the \nrisk of preventable pain as well as tooth morbidity and tooth mortality.  On the \nother hand, prisoners who refuse the extraction must endure tooth pain until they \nemerge  from  quarantine  โ  waiting  for  as  much  as  24-months.  During  the  24-\nmonths wait, a restorable tooth may become unrestorable.   \n13.  Plaintiff TINA STOLL, 875525 (hereafter Stoll) is/was at all time \nrelevant a prisoner confined with the MDOC who sought dental care that was \ndenied or delayed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. During her first  24-\nmonths  of  confinement,  Stoll  had  at  least  20  teeth  extracted  but  was  denied \n\t 8\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6271   Filed 01/14/18   Page 9 of 38\ndentures because she had not been imprisoned for at least 24-months.  The initial \nIntake Exam was inadequate because it did not produce a treatment plan or dental \nprobing. Even though Stoll had requested a teeth-cleaning exam and was placed on \na waiting list on August 22, 2013, Stoll did not receive the cleaning for more than \n2 ยฝ years later on February 29, 2016. Stoll informed dental staff that while eating \nfood  her  gums  would  bleed;  she  would  swallow  food  whole  and  experience \nvomiting and other digestive problems every time she ate.  She was subjected to \nunreasonable  delay  in  the  production  of  dentures  that  caused  pain  and  other \ndiscomforts. She was also subjected to an untimely treatment plan, which resulted \nin Stoll being subjected to a cycle of episodic care, i.e., frequent toothaches; and \nthe dental staff did not offer her a mechanical soft diet. \n14.  Defendant  HEIDI  WASHINGTON  (hereafter  Washington)  is  the \nDirector of the Michigan Department of Correction and is sued in her official \ncapacity. At all times relevant hereto, she has acted under color of state law. She is \nresponsible  for  the  operation  of  the  State  of  Michigan  prisons  and  directs  its \npolicies and procedures pertaining to the providing of dental care. Presently she \nhas  one  Regional  Dental  Administrators  who  is  responsible  for  enforcing  her \nwritten and verbal policies and practices. \n15.  Defendant JONG CHOI is the Chief Dental Officer for MDOC and \nis sued in his official capacity. At all times relevant hereto, he has acted under \n\t 9\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6272   Filed 01/14/18   Page 10 of 38\ncolor of state law. Also, at all times mentioned in this complaint, Defendant Choi \nwas an agent of Defendant Washington and was acting within the course and scope \nof this agency, and all acts alleged to have been committed by Defendant Choi in \nthe ensuring that the dental policy was implemented was committed on behalf of \nDefendant Washington. \nJURISDICTION \n16.  This action arises under the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C.. \n1983.  Jurisdiction  is  proper  in  this  court  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  1331  and \n1343(a)(3). \n17.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ claims for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201and 2202. \n18.  Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs seek class certification \nbased on the method and manner that dental care is provided to those confined \nwithin the prison system today and in the future. \nVENUE \n19.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  Court  pursuant  to  28  U.C.C.  1391(b)(1) \nbecause  Defendant  resided  in  the  Eastern  District  of  Michigan;  venue  is  also \nperoper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to Plaintiffsโ claims occurred in the Eastern District of \nMichigan. \n\t 10\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6273   Filed 01/14/18   Page 11 of 38\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n20.  Defendant Washington is the Director of MDOC and is responsible \nfor  ensuring  that  all  prisoners  receive  dental  care  that  does  not  subject  the \nPlaintiffs,  or  the  proposed  class  members,  to  pain  in  violation  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment. \n21.  Defendant Washington is responsible for operation of all prison dental \nfacilities,  which  current  house  approximately  39,000  prisoners.  One  of  the \nmissions of the MDOC is to provide dental care on a professional manner like \ndental care provided in the communities. \n22.  Defendant Choi presently is the Chief Dental Officer for the entire \nMDOC  and  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  MDOCโs  Dental  Protocol  and \nPolicy Directive 04.06.150 are implemented. \n23.  There  are  approximately  8,000  prisoners  who  entered  and/or  are \nreturned to prison as parole violators each year that are subjected to the 24-months \nwait, which prevents and prohibits routine dental care even if the request is for \ntreatment of painful conditions. Routine dental care (per MDOC Policy Directive \n04.06.150  [R.124-8])  includes  all  dental  care  (excluding  urgent  and  emergent \ndental  care),  such  as  cleaning,  examinations  and  treatment  plans,  periodontal \nscreening and treatment, fillings, and dentures. \n\t 11\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6274   Filed 01/14/18   Page 12 of 38\n24.  Any prisoners that has a dental issue involving pain during this 24-\nmonths wait will be refused dental care, such as filling of a cavity, and will be \nrequired to wait for the completion of a 24-months imprisonment or will be offered \nextraction of the tooth even if that tooth is savagable. \n25.  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  members  were  denied  routine  dental  care \nbased on the single fact that they had not completed the 24-months imprisonment  \nmandated by Policy Directive 04.06.150. \n26.  Prior to October 2013, MDOC did not restrict the types of dental care \nprovided to prisoners who entered the prison system.  There existed no restrictions \nthat those who had not been imprisoned for less than 24-months could not receive \nroutine dental care. The only restriction, if it could be called a restriction, was that \nMDOC did not employ sufficient medical staff that a wait list of approximately \n8,000 prisoners had developed. \n27.  In 2013, MDOC decided to restrict, or one could say narrow, the type \nof dental care that would be provided during the first 24-months of imprisonment. \nAccording to the new policy directive, for the first 24-months of imprisonment that \nprisoners could not receive care if it involved the providing of routine dental care. \nThe policy said that care would only be provided to those with urgent needs. Based \non  this  new  policy,  within  months,  this  huge  wait  list  of  approximately  8,000 \nprisoners was reduced to around 2,000 prisoners. \n\t 12\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6275   Filed 01/14/18   Page 13 of 38\n28.  As part of the implementation of the new policy directive, Defendant \nand her agents did not define routine dental care during the first 24-months to \ninclude dental care to alleviate pain and to take steps to ensure that salvageable \nteeth were restored and/or preserved.  \n29.  Defendant Washington has created a policy that prisoners within the \nfirst 24-months of their imprisonment that have dental pain that require routine \ncare  to  eliminate  the  pain  will  not  receive  dental  services  to  fix  or  restore  or \neliminate the pain for those teeth, but are denied routine care to fix the teeth to \nensure that they are useable, instead they are told to either agree to extraction of \nthe teeth with pain, or continue to suffer pain during the remaining months of first \n24-months of imprisonment. \n30.  Defendants have established a practice that during intake there is a \nfailure to provide periodontal screening and diagnosis and proper diagnostic x-\nrays, which if done in compliance with national dental standards, could prevent the \nperiodontal  disease  going  from  โmildโ  or  โaverageโ  to  โmoderateโ  and  to \nโadvancedโ or โseriousโ, which could result in the inability to correct or control the \nperiodontal disease, as well as to prevent tooth loss. \n31.  The  periodontal  classification  made  at  the  intake  examination  is \ninadequate  and  understates  the  amount  and  severity  of  prisonersโ  periodontal \ndiseases because Panoramic x-rays that are used are not an acceptable diagnostic \n\t 13\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6276   Filed 01/14/18   Page 14 of 38\ntool  for  identifying  and  classifying  periodontal  disease.  Moreover,  since \nperiodontal probing (an accepted professional standard) is not documented, the \nseverity and location of periodontal disease is inadequately characterized. \n32.  The named Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are subjected to \nneedless  pain  based  on  the  first  24-months  of  imprisonment;  the  practice  of \nclassifying all dental procedures to eliminate pain as routine care during this 24-\nmonths wait; implementation of a policy of extraction for emergent dental issues \nduring  this  24-months  wait,  which  forces  the  prisoners  to  choose  between \ncontinuing pain or teeth extraction.  The policy further forces an inmate to request \neither extraction of a healthy tooth that was restorable or wait with pain and hope \nthe tooth remains restorable after the 24-months.  Thus, such a 24-months wait \nleads  to  restorable  teeth  becoming  unrestorable  and  thus,  unnecessary  loss  of \nhealthy teeth. At the end of the 24-months wait, prisoners are then placed on wait-\nlists that can result in not receiving dental care for 6-18 months before ever being \nseen for their routine dental needs.  Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are \nbringing a facial challenge to the policy directive implemented in October of 2013. \n33.  Due to the untimely care because no dental plan is made at intake and \nthe 24-months wait imprisonment, a fractured tooth left untreated allows decay to \nenter the tooth and such decay may progress increasing tooth morbidity because \nthe  progressing  untreated  decay  will  cause  a  tooth  once  restorable  to  become \n\t 14\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6277   Filed 01/14/18   Page 15 of 38\nunrestorable, thereby forcing extraction and confirming the defendantโs policy of \nfavoring extraction over tooth restoration to save teeth.  Such a policy violates the \nEighth Amendment as the policy causes unnecessary pain and unnecessary tooth \nloss thereby destroying the dentition. \n34.  Defendants have a practice that once prisoners have completed the \nfirst 24-months of imprisonment, they can submit a dental kite to receive a dental \ncleaning and to determine what dental care is needed for routine dental issues that \nhave been denied up to the last 24-months; the requesting prisoner is placed on a \nwaiting list for โdental cleaningโ, which can then take 6-12 months to receive the \ncleaning. At the cleaning, the prisoner will then see the dentist who will create a \ntreatment plan, i.e, fillings, which then results in the prisoner placement on another \nwait list for fillings, and can be on that wait list for 4-12 months. \n35.  Once prisoners have completed the first 24-months of imprisonment, \nthey can then wait up to 6-18 months to receive actual dental care. Due to the long \nwait lists these prisoners are deprived of timely dental care leading to unnecessary \ntooth pain, preventable progression of decay and/or tooth loss. \n36.  Defendants have created a policy and/or practice that during the first \n24-months of their imprisonment, prisoners who are in need of dentures due to loss \nof teeth or unrestorable teeth can have these unrestorable teeth pulled, but cannot \nreceive dentures even though those prisoners are not able to chew hard and chewy \n\t 15\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6278   Filed 01/14/18   Page 16 of 38\nfoods; the same policy does not allow old dentures that are broken or damaged, \ndentures  lost  by  prison  staff,  and/or  failure  to  provide  dentures  pursuant  to \nextenuating circumstances such as being assaulted by another inmate with a lock-\nn-sock causing a broken jaw and loss of teeth, to be replaced during the first 24-\nmonths of imprisonment.  As a result of this policy and/or practice, Washington \nand Choi have failed to provide timely dentures, which failure adversely impacted \nPlaintiffs and the untimely dentures Class ability to masticate food, achieve proper \nnutrition, and be free from pain. \n37.  Washington and Choi have failed to provide sufficient and/or timely \ndental care, such as dentists or other dental staff, which failure adversely impacted \nPlaintiffs and the four proposed Classesโs ability to masticate food, achieve proper \nnutrition, and be free from pain and/or includes untimely treatment of tooth pain \nand decay permitting the decay to worsen to the point o requiring extraction or loss \nof teeth unnecessarily which could have been prevented by timely care. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nA.  24-months No Routine Dental Care โ Class 1\n \n38.  Pursuant  to  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  23(a)  and \n23(b), Plaintiffs  BAILEY,  BROWNES,  FLESSNER,  GUNNELS,  MEANS, \nREEVES, ROMAN, and SLONE bring this action on behalf of themselves and a \nclass of all persons who are now, or will in the future be, subjected to the dental \n\t 16\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6279   Filed 01/14/18   Page 17 of 38\ncare policies and practices of Defendant Washington. Washington is aware that the \npolicy of denying MDOC prisoners routine care during their first 24 months of \nincarceration has no clinical basis and exposes them to a substantial risk of serious \nharm, including exposure to unnecessary tooth pain, decay, and unnecessary loss \nof teeth; yet she chooses not to alter the policy. \n(1) Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a(1); Impracticability of Joinder\n \n39.  The  24  months  no  routine  dental  care  (quarantine)  Class  is  so \nnumerous  that  joinder  of  all  class  members  is  impracticable.  There  are \napproximately 16,000 prisoners confined with the MODC who have entered the \nprison system within the last 24 months.  Every 12 months there are approximately \n8,000  new  potential  class  members:  prisoners  who  are  newly  admitted  to  the \nMDOC or parole violators sentenced / returned to serve more time. \n40.  At the end of the 24 months imprisonment, thousands of prisoners \nbecome eligible to receive routine dental care; however, they must then request a \ndental  cleaning  and/or  dental  exam,  which  results  in  their  being  placed  on  a \nwaiting list for that cleaning and/or dental exam. Based on the dental treatment \nplans  created  for  each  prisoner,  they  are  then  placed  on  other  wait  lists  for \ntreatment. Such wait lists are long due to insufficient staffing. Due to the long wait \nlists, these prisoners are deprived of timely dental care leading to unnecessary \n\t 17\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6280   Filed 01/14/18   Page 18 of 38\ntooth pain, preventable progression of decay and/or tooth loss. The practical effect \nof these delays is to make the quarantine substantially longer than 24 months. \n41.  These  prisoners  who  are  subjected  to  24-months  denial  of  routine \ndental  care  are  identifiable  using  records  maintained  in  the  ordinary  course  of \nbusiness by the MDOC. All prisoners who are incarcerated less than 24 months are \nclass members. \n(2) Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2): Commonality\n \n42.  There are questions of law and facts common to those prisoners who \nare defined as class members who have been imprisoned with the MDOC less than \n24 months. \na. Whether  Washingtonโs  failed  to  maintain,  supervise  and  operate  a \n \ndental system that provides minimally adequate dental care, which did \nnot pose a substantial risk of serious harm to those confined for less than \n24-months and needing routine care. \n \nb. Whether Washington was deliberately indifferent to the serious dental \n \nneeds  of  class  members,  and  to  the  risk  posed  by  the  failure  to  use \nsufficient  x-rays  to  diagnose  caries  and  bone  loss  and  document \nperiodontal probing to screen for and diagnose periodontal disease, and \nto  prepare  a  treatment  plan  and  provide  treatment  for  the  conditions \nidentified within the first 24 months of imprisonment. \n \n43.  Because  the  intake  exam  is  incomplete  and  below  accepted \nprofessional standards, all prisoners are subject to the risk of serious harm from \n\t 18\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6281   Filed 01/14/18   Page 19 of 38\nlack of untimely diagnosis of dental disease and creation of appropriate treatment \nplans. \n44.  Failure to provide periodontal screening and diagnosis (i.e., the PSR) \nand proper diagnostic x-rays at intake can result in the periodontal disease going \nfrom โmildโ or โaverageโ to โmoderateโ and to โadvancedโ or โseriousโ, which can \nresult  in  the  inability  to  correct  or  control  the  periodontal  disease,  as  well  as \npreventable tooth loss. \n45.  The  periodontal  classification  made  at  the  intake  examination  is \ninadequate and understates the amount and severity of a prisonerโs periodontal \ndisease because the Panoramic x-ray that is used is not an acceptable diagnostic \ntool  for  identifying  and  classifying  periodontal  disease.  Moreover,  since \nperiodontal probing (an accepted professional standard) is not documented, the \nseverity and location of periodontal disease is inadequately characterized. \n46.  Routine oral examinations (Service Codes 00120 and 00150), while \nusing  bite-wing  x-rays,  fail  to  document  periodontal  probing  (an  accepted \nprofessional  standard)  and  thus  periodontal  disease  is  under  diagnosed. \nConsequently, the resulting treatment plans for addressing periodontal disease are \ninadequate.  \n47.  Even when moderate or advanced periodontal disease is identified, \nappropriate non-surgical treatment (i.e., scaling and root planing โ which MDOC \n\t 19\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6282   Filed 01/14/18   Page 20 of 38\ncalls  โperio  scaleโ  (Service  Codes  0433,  0434,  and  0439))  is  not  scheduled, \nplanned, or is untimely performed. \n48.  These  individuals  who  are  subjected  to  inadequate  periodontal \nscreening and inadequate x-rays are identifiable using records maintained in the \nordinary course of business by MDOC. \n49.  Washington is expected to raise common defenses to these claims, \nincluding denying that her actions violated the law. \n(3) Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3): Typicality\n \n50.  The claims of the 24-month denial of routine care Plaintiffs are typical \nof those of the 24-month denial of routine care Class, as their claims arise from the \nsame policies, practice, and course of conduct, and their claims are based on the \nsame theory of law as the Class claims. \n(4) Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4): Adequacy of Representation \n51.   \n52.  Each of the 24 months no routine care Class Plaintiffs will fairly and \nadequately represent the interests of the 24 months no routine care Class and will \ndiligently serve as class representatives. Their interests are co-extensive with those \nof  the  24  months  no  routine  care  Class,  and  they  are  represented  by  counsel \nexperienced in class litigation and in litigation involving the rights of prisoners. \nPutative Class Counsel possesses the experience and resources necessary to fairly \nand adequately represent the Class. \n\t 20\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6283   Filed 01/14/18   Page 21 of 38\n(5) Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b) \n \n53.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. \n23(b)(1) because the number of class members is approximately 16,000, and the \nprosecution of separate actions by individuals would create a risk of inconsistent \nand varying adjudications, which in turn would establish incompatible standards of \nconduct  for  Defendants.  Additionally,  the  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by \nindividuals could result in adjudications with response to individual class members \nthat, as a practical matter, would substantially impair the ability of other members \nto protect their interests. \n54.  This  action  is  also  maintainable  as  a  class  action  pursuant  to \nFed.R.Civ.P.  23(b)(2)  because  Washingtonโs  policies,  practices,  actions,  and \nomissions that form the basis of the claims of the 24 months no routine care Class \nare common to and apply generally to all members of the class. The 24-months no \nroutine careโs policy and practices are centrally promulgated, disseminated, and \nenforced  from  the  headquarters  of  Defendants  Washington  and  Choi.

Washington and Choi have failed to provide sufficient and/or timely \ndental care, such as dentists or other dental staff, which failure adversely impacted \nPlaintiffs  and  the  wait  lists  Classโs  ability  to  masticate  food,  achieve  proper \nnutrition, and be free from pain and/or includes untimely treatment of tooth pain \nand decay permitting the decay to worsen to the point o requiring extraction or loss \nof teeth unnecessarily which could have been prevented by timely care. \n84.  These individuals who are subjected to placements on these wait lists \nare identifiable using records maintained in the ordinary course of business by the \nMDOC. \n(2)  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2): Commonality \n85.  There are questions of law and facts common to those prisoners who \nare defined as members who have been placed on dental wait lists. \na.  Whether Defendants failed to operate a dental system that provided \nminimally adequate dental care, which did not pose a substantial risk \nof  serious  harm  by  failing  to  provide  sufficient  dentists  and  other \nsupport staff. \n \nb.  Whether Defendants were deliberately indifferent to the serious dental \nneeds of Plaintiffs and class members by the placement of prisoners \non long wait lists subjecting them to untimely dental care resulting in \nunnecessary tooth loss, loss of tooth structure of the hard and soft \ntissues and/or tooth pain. \n \n\t 30\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6293   Filed 01/14/18   Page 31 of 38\n86.  Washington and Choi are expected to raise common defenses to these \nclaims, including denying that their actions violated the law. \n(3)  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3): Typicality  \n87.  The claims of those placed on long wait lists Plaintiffs are typical of \nthose placed on long wait list, as their claims arise from the same policy, practice, \nand course of conduct, and their claims are based on the same theory of law as the \nClass claims. \n(4)  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4): Adequacy of Representation  \n88.  Each  of  the  wait  lists  Class  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately \nrepresent the interests of the wait lists Class and will diligently serve as a class \nrepresentative. Their interests are co-extensive with those of the wait lists Class, \nand they are represented by counsel experienced in class litigation and in litigation \ninvolving the rights of prisoners. Putative Class Counsel possesses the experience \nand resources necessary to fairly and adequately represent the Class. \n(5)  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)  \n89.  This action is maintainable as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. \n23(b)(1) because the number of class members is approximately 23,000 and the \nprosecution of separate actions by individuals would create a risk of inconsistent \nand varying adjudications, which in turn would establish incompatible standards of \nconduct  for  Defendants.  Additionally,  the  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by \n\t 31\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6294   Filed 01/14/18   Page 32 of 38\nindividuals could result in adjudications with response to individual class members \nthat, as a practical matter, would substantially impair the ability of other members \nto protect their interests. \n90.  This  action  is  also  maintainable  as  a  class  action  pursuant  to \nFed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) because Washingtonโs policy, practice, action, and omission \nthat are implemented and enforced by Defendant Choi form the basis of the claims \nof the wait lists Class that are common to and apply generally to all members of \nthe  Class.  The  wait  listsโ  policy  and  practice  are  centrally  promulgated, \ndisseminated, and enforced from the headquarters of Defendants Washington and \nChoi. The injunctive and declaratory relief sought is appropriate and will apply as \na whole to all members of the 24-months class. \nEIGHTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION \n91.  Plaintiffs allege and incorporate by reference all prior paragraphs. \n92.  Dental health needs are serious medical necessities, because dental \ncare  is  one  of  the  most  important  needs  of  inmates  to  preserve  and  maintain \ngeneral  health,  including  the  ability  to  eat  and  chew  foods,  and  the  ability  to \nengage in a normal activity of eating, necessary for maintaining nutritional health, \nphysical-health, and dental health. Normal eating and chewing are a basic bodily \nfunction to sustain life, and deprivation of the ability to eat and chew constitutes \ncruel and unusual punishment. \n\t 32\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6295   Filed 01/14/18   Page 33 of 38\n93.  Deliberate  indifference  to  serious  dental  needs  is  evidenced  by \nsystemic deficiencies in dental care policies and practices in Michigan prisons that \nhave produced longstanding instances of inadequate care. The MDOCโs policies \nand practices โas-appliedโ to those not subjected to the 24-months wait constitute \ncruel and unusual punishment, thereby violating the Eighth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution when these serious dental needs of the Plaintiffs and \nproposed class members were/are not met.  \n94.  Defendants have created and engaged in systemic deficiencies in the \ndelaying  and  denying  needed  dental  care  to  the  Plaintiffs  and  proposed  class \nmembers,  such  that  Defendants  have  demonstrated  deliberate  indifference  to \nserious dental needs. \n95.  The named Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are subjected to \nneedless pain based on the 24-months wait; the practice of classifying all dental \nprocedures  to  eliminate  pain  as  routine  care  during  the  24-months  wait; \nimplementation of a policy of extraction for emergent dental issues during the 24-\nmonths wait, which forces the prisoners to choose between continuing pain or \nhaving their teeth extracted.  The policy further forces an inmate to either request \nextraction of a healthy tooth that was restorable or wait with pain and hope the \ntooth remains restorable after the 24-months.  Thus, such a 24-months wait leads to \nrestorable teeth becoming unrestorable and thus, unnecessary loss of healthy tooth. \n\t 33\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6296   Filed 01/14/18   Page 34 of 38\nAt the end of the 24-months wait, prisoners are then placed on wait-lists that can \nresult not receiving dental care for 6-months to over a year before even being seen \nfor their emergent dental needs.  Plaintiffs and the proposed class members are \nbringing a facial challenge to the policy directive implemented in October of 2013. \n96.  The implementation of the October 2013 policy directive on its face \nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment, thereby violating the Eighth Amendment \nof the United States Constitution when these serious dental needs of the Plaintiffs, \nand  proposed  class  members  were/are  not  met  during  the  first  24-months  of \nimprisonment. \n97.  Further, those prisoners who entered the system in need of dentures \nare denied such during this 24-months wait even though they are/may suffer pain \nand cannot properly chew food. Moreover, at the end of these 24-months wait \nthese prisoners are then placed on new wait lists that can result in waiting for 6-\nmonths to over a year before even being seen for an evaluation of the need for \ndentures. These prisoners then may wait years before they are provided dentures. \n98.  The named Plaintiffs and proposed class members are being subjected \nto needless pain and/or risk of unnecessary tooth loss based on Defendantโs policy \nof not providing scaling and root planing for those prisoners diagnosed with early \nto moderate to advanced periodontal disease. Failure to accurately diagnose (no \nprobing or x-rays at the intake examination), failure to establish a treatment plan \n\t 34\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6297   Filed 01/14/18   Page 35 of 38\nthat includes scaling and root planing for prisoners with moderate to advanced \nperiodontal  disease,  and  the  24-months  wait  policy  that  delays  even  a  prophy, \ncombines to create a dental system where prisoners are placed at risk of harm, such \nas loss of tooth support (bone), loss of teeth, and pain (from periodontal abscesses).  \nFurther, after the expiration of the 24-months wait, prisoners are subjected to long \nnew wait lists before any treatment is provided leading to further decay and/or \ntooth loss and progression of periodontal disease.  Defendant Washingtonโs policy \ndoes  not  properly  or  adequately  diagnose  periodontal  disease  by  failing  to \nperiodontally probe and measure pocket depths and chart such results and/or take \nproper  diagnostic  x-rays  and/or  Defendantโs  policy  does  not  treat  adequately \nperiodontal disease even when it is identified. \nRelief \n \nWHEREFORE, for the reasons stated above, this Court should: \nA.  Accept jurisdiction of this matter; \nB.  Certify this matter as a class action as to the four proposed classes; \nC.  Declare that the rights of Plaintiffs and class members were violated by the \nactions of the Defendants; \nD.  Find that the actions of the Defendants, as to the provision of dental care, \nsubjected  the  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  members  to  a  violation  of  their  Eighth \nAmendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment; \n\t 35\t\n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-MKM   ECF No. 236, PageID.6298   Filed 01/14/18   Page 36 of 38\nE.

If you are a prisoner who is scheduled for an intake \ndental screening or comprehensive exam or has requested dental \ncare, this Settlement may affect your rights. \nThis notice tells you about (1) the lawsuit; (2) who is impacted by the \nsettlement; (3) the proposed settlement agreement; (4) how to object or \ncomment on the agreement; and (5) how to get more information. \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 390, PageID.15578   Filed 10/12/23   Page 5 of 8\nI.  The Lawsuit \nThis case was first filed in 2014 by a prisoner who alleged that the \ndental care he received did not meet constitutional standards.  \nThroughout the years of litigation, this case became a proposed class \naction against the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nDirector and MDOC Dental Director.  This case was certified as a class \naction in February 2019.  After further litigation, the remaining class \nclaim alleged constitutional violations in the diagnosis and treatment of \nvarious stages of periodontal disease. \nThis lawsuit does not seek monetary damages.  Instead, the lawsuit \nasks the Court to order MDOC to ensure that those prisoners who are \ndetermined to be members of the class subject to this settlement \nagreement are provided certain dental services. \nThere is now a settlement agreement between the parties that provides \nthat all class members are eligible to receive routine dental services \nafter 12 months of continuous incarceration within the MDOC; will \nreceive a Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR) at dental intake, \ncomprehensive, and periodic examinations; and will receive certain \ntreatment of periodontitis depending on the stage of periodontitis \npresent.  This is explained more thoroughly in the follow sections.  \nII.  Who is Impacted by the Settlement? \nPrisoners who will benefit from the settlement are called the โclass \nmembers.โ \nAll current and future prisoners who are incarcerated within the MDOC \nare considered class members as any prisoner may receive an intake, \ncomprehensive, or periodic dental examination and has a periodontal \ncondition ranging from healthy gums to periodontitis. \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 390, PageID.15579   Filed 10/12/23   Page 6 of 8\nIII.  The Proposed Agreement \nIn the settlement agreement, Plaintiffs and MDOC have agreed to the \nfollowing key points: \n1. Routine Dental Care Eligibility Period โ Inmates will be \neligible for routine dental services after 12 months of \ncontinuous incarceration within the MDOC from the first day of \ntheir dental intake examination.1 \n2. Diagnosis of Periodontal Disease โ At intake, comprehensive, \nand periodic dental examinations, qualified dental staff will \nperform a Periodontal Screening and Recording (PSR). \na. A comprehensive periodontal examination will be performed \nwhen the PSR indicates it should be performed. \nb. Appropriate charting for the PSR and comprehensive \nperiodontal examination, as indicated, will be performed. \n3. Treatment of Periodontitis โ Treatment will be provided for \nperiodontitis as follows: \na. If at the intake exam it is determined that the inmate has \nStage III or IV periodontitis, the inmate will receive a \nreferral to the stabilization clinic for the appropriate \ntreatment (e.g., scaling and root planning or extraction). \nb. If at the intake exam it is determined that the inmate has \nStage I or II periodontitis, the inmate will receive \nappropriate treatment (e.g., scaling and root planning) \npursuant to their treatment plan that will be prescribed at \ntheir first comprehensive examination.  \n \n1 This provision applies to eligibility for routine dental care only; it does \nnot guarantee that routine dental services will be provided within any \nspecific timeframe.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-11691-LJM-JJCG   ECF No. 390, PageID.15580   Filed 10/12/23   Page 7 of 8\nc.  Qualified dental staff will be permitted to use local \nanesthesia during periodontitis treatment when necessary \nfor pain control. \n4. Updates to Policy and Dental Service Manual โ Where \napplicable, the MDOC Dental Policy Directive and/or Dental \nServices Manual will be updated to reflect the relief provided in \nthis agreement and will set out staging of periodontal disease \nin accordance with the American Dental Association standard. \n5.
