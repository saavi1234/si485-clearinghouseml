    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought challenging the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) prioritization of certain applications for emergency government assistance. Section 5003 appropriated $28.6 billion for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to be administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA initially accepted all applications for emergency grants, but was directed in the ARPA to give priority to certain grant applicants during an initial 21-day period, beginning on May 3, 2021. Those given priority included small businesses “owned and controlled by women, veterans, or socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns.” The ARPA incorporated the definition of socially disadvantaged individuals found in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. §637): “those subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities.” SBA regulations further defined “socially disadvantaged individuals” and “economically disadvantaged individuals” as those people belonging to certain racial groups.</p><p>The plaintiff was a white man who owned Jake’s Bar and Grill, LLC, in Harriman, Tennessee. He was represented by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a non-profit, conservative activist law firm. The plaintiff applied for an emergency grant under the Restaurant Revitalization Fund on May 3, 2021, and his application was put on hold. The plaintiff filed suit on May 12, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, with Judge Travis R. McDonough presiding. The plaintiff alleged that Section 5003 violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. The plaintiffs sought the following: a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining Section 5003’s racial classifications; a temporary injunction requiring SBA to process applications in the order in which they were made, again without regards to race or sex of the applicant; a declaratory judgment that the policy was unconstitutional; and an order permanently enjoining SBA from making such eligibility classifications in dispersing ARPA funding. The plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin SBA’s use of the classifications on the same day.</p><p>The government filed a motion in opposition to the TRO on May 17, 2021, arguing that the race-conscious classification was a necessary means to achieve a compelling government interest in remedying the effects of past or present racial discrimination. On May 19, 2021, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a TRO. The court determined that when Congress passed the ARPA, it had a compelling interest in remedying past racial discrimination against minority owned businesses, especially given racial disparities which appeared in previous COVID-19-relief programs such as the 2020 CARES Act. Plaintiffs moved to stay this order on May 19, 2021. This was denied the next day. The district court also denied the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction on May 25, 2021, citing reasoning similar to their denial of the TRO.</p><p>Plaintiff appealed the denial of the TRO to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on May 20, 2021. The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court, enjoining the government to pay plaintiff’s grant application, if approved, before all later-filed applications, without regard to processing time or the applicant’s race or sex. 999 F.3d 353. The Sixth Circuit determined that the government lacked a compelling interest because it relied only on \"broad statistical disparities.\" The Sixth Circuit also held that the prioritization of women-owned businesses failed to pass strict scrutiny.</p><p>The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 1, 2021. This added four additional plaintiffs, all of whom were white male business owners who had applied for ARPA funding during the initial 21-day period. The next day, the new plaintiffs filed a second emergency motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction. They sought relief similar to what the Sixth Circuit had given the initial plaintiff. The district court denied the preliminary injunction as moot on June 10, 2021, citing testimony of the Deputy Associate Administrator of Capital Access at SBA that the agency had already begun processing non-priority applications, including those of the additional plaintiffs, and that no new priority applications would be reviewed until preceding non-priority applications had been reviewed first. The plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew all appeals on July 15, 2021, likely due to the mootness issue mentioned above.</p><p>On August 6, 2021, the government moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction for substantially the same reasons. However, before the court could rule, parties filed a stipulation of dismissal without prejudice on August 25. The case is now closed.</p>",

The plaintiff filed suit on May 12, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (Knoxville); they sought to enjoin the use of racial classifications under section 5003. The Sixth Circuit granted the plaintiff an injunction on May 27, 2021, which ordered the government to pay the plaintiff’s grant application, if approved, before all later-filed applications, without regard to processing time or the applicant’s race or sex.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE \n \n \nANTONIO VITOLO and JAKE’S BAR AND  Case No. 3:21-cv-176-TRM-DCP \nGRILL, LLC,   \n  Chief Judge Travis R. McDonough  \nPlaintiffs,   \nv.  Magistrate Judge Debra C. Poplin  \n   \nISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN,    \n \nDefendant. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR TEMPORARY \nRESTRAINING ORDER \n \nINTRODUCTION  \n  In March 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) as a continuation \nof the federal government’s efforts to provide relief to American individuals and businesses suffering \nthe economic and public health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In enacting this latest installment \nof COVID-19 relief, Congress aimed to provide much-needed support to America’s restaurant \nindustry.  Congress was aware that the pandemic has had different effects on groups with different \nunderlying  characteristics—such  as  women,  veterans,  and  individuals  who  are  socially  and \neconomically disadvantaged—and thus aimed to target this crucial aid to small businesses owned by \nentrepreneurs who have experienced discrimination and who were not adequately served by earlier \npandemic relief efforts.  In particular, Section 5003 created and appropriated funds for a Restaurant \nRevitalization Fund (“RRF”) to provide grants to small businesses in the restaurant industry.  Section \n5003 also provided that for the first twenty-one days that the government provided grants under this \nprogram, it should prioritize applications from small businesses that are at least 51% owned and \ncontrolled by women, veterans, or socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  The Small \nBusiness Administration (“SBA”) is responsible for administering this program, and has already begun \nto accept applications and distribute funds consistent with this statutory mandate.  While SBA \n1 \n\nregulations and the application for the RRF presume that members of certain racial and ethnic groups \nare among those designated as socially disadvantaged, that category is not limited exclusively to \nmembers of those groups.  \n  Plaintiffs now seek a temporary restraining order enjoining SBA’s implementation of Section \n5003, claiming that the law discriminates on the basis of race and gender.  But Plaintiffs are unlikely \nto succeed on the merits of their claims.  Section 5003’s use of race and gender is constitutional \nbecause the race-based presumption is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, \nand the gender-based preference serves important governmental objectives and is substantially related \nto the achievement of those objectives.  In any event, Plaintiff Vitolo is not irreparably harmed by the \nchallenged race-based presumption because he has not established or even alleged that he is socially \ndisadvantaged, and thus would not be entitled to receive funds during the priority period even if the \nrace-based presumption were eliminated.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ TRO request should be denied.     \nBACKGROUND  \nI.  The Federal Government’s Early COVID-19 Relief Programs. \nIn January 2020, the first reported case of the novel coronavirus was identified in North \nAmerica, ushering in a series of federal government actions intended to combat both the public health \nand economic consequences of the emerging pandemic, which continue to this day.  SBA has been at \nthe forefront of many of those efforts.   \nOn  March  6,  2020,  Congress  passed  the  Coronavirus  Preparedness  and  Response \nSupplemental Appropriations Act of 2020, which deemed the coronavirus a disaster for purposes of \nsection 7(b)(2)(D) of the Small Business Act, allowing the SBA to make Economic Injury Disaster \nLoans (“EIDL”) available to eligible small businesses in response to the coronavirus.  See H.R. 6074, \nPub. L. No. 116-123, 134 Stat. 146 (2020).  On March 27, 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus \nAid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, which established the Paycheck Protection \nProgram (“PPP”), provided $349 billion to fund the program, and provided funding for a new EIDL \nadvance grant program.  H.R. 748, Pub. L. No. 116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (2020).  The PPP provides small \nbusinesses with SBA-backed loans that can be used to cover payroll (and certain other expenses) \n2 \n\nduring the COVID-19 crisis and are 100 percent forgivable if the money is used in accordance with \nthe program requirements.  The $349 billion in PPP funds were soon exhausted, and Congress enacted \nanother law appropriating additional funding for the PPP, EIDL loans, and EIDL advance grants.  \nPaycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, H.R. 266, Pub. L. No. 116-139, \n134 Stat. 620 (2020).  Congress has since continued to modify and extend the PPP program.  \n \nII.  Congress Focuses on Assistance to the Restaurant Industry, With an Emphasis on \nMinority- and Women-Owned Small Businesses. \nFollowing the initial rush to implement COVID relief, Congress’ attention turned to the \nparticular impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns on the restaurant industry and \non minority- and women-owned businesses in particular.  The United States House of Representatives \nCommittee on Small Business “held many hearings and forums . . . on a wide variety of subjects \nrelevant to pandemic aid programs,” including hearings that discussed lessons learned from prior \nCOVID relief programs and the needs of small businesses, including restaurants.  H.R. Rep. No. 117-\n7, at 457 (2021).  Two relevant themes emerged during these hearings—first, that special support was \nneeded for the restaurant industry (and the hospitality industry writ large), and second, that targeted \nrelief was needed for minority- and women-owned businesses, many of whom the prior relief \nprograms had failed to reach.  \nOn June 17, 2020, the Committee on Small Business held a remote hearing entitled “Paycheck \nProtection Program: Loan Forgiveness and Other Challenges.”  See Memo. from N. Velázquez, \nChairwoman,  Comm.  on  Small  Bus.  to  Members,  Comm.  on  Small  Bus.  (June  17,  2020), \nhttps://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/06-17-20_hearing_memo.pdf.    One  topic  of \ndiscussion at that hearing was “the impact the PPP has had on traditionally underserved businesses \ncommunities,” including reports that “more needs to be done to ensure minority-owned businesses \nare fully able to access the program.”  Id. at 3.   \nOn July 15, 2020, the Committee on Small Business held a full committee hearing entitled \n“Long-Lasting Solutions for a Small Business Recovery,” which addressed “recovery efforts to \nstimulate small business growth following the Great Recession, barriers to recovery, and some of the \n3 \n\nindustries that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.”  See Memo. from N. Velázquez, \nChairwoman, H. Comm. on Small Bus. to Members, H. Comm. on Small Bus. (July 15, 2020), \nhttps://smallbusiness.house.gov/uploadedfiles/07-15-20_memo.pdf (“July 15, 2020 Memo.”).  At \nthis hearing, the committee discussed efforts to shore up small businesses during the pandemic, with \na particular focus on minority- and women-owned businesses.  See generally Long-Lasting Solutions for a \nSmall Business Recovery: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Small Bus., 116th Cong. (2020).  In a memorandum \nreleased before the hearing, Chairwoman Nydia Velázquez stated that “[a]ny additional COVID-19 \nlegislative  packages  should  prioritize  lending  and  relief  to  the  smallest  businesses,  as  well  as \nunderserved businesses, given that these businesses had trouble accessing or were denied PPP and \nEIDL loans and grants.”  See July 15, 2020 Memo. at 6.   \nHearings on these topics continued into the following year.  On February 4, 2021, the House \nSubcommittee  on  National  Security,  International  Development,  and  Monetary  Policy  of  the \nCommittee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled “Supporting Small and Minority-Owned \nBusinesses Through the Pandemic,” which focused on “understand[ing] why aid to minority-owned \nbusinesses was delayed” and “helping to lay the groundwork for how [Congress] can do better going \nforward.”  Supporting Small Bus. & Minority-Owned Bus. Through the Pandemic: Virtual Hearing Before the \nSubcomm. on Nat’l Sec., Int’l Dev., & Monetary Policy of the H. Comm. on Fin. Servs., 117th Cong. 2-3 (2021) \n(statement of Rep. Jim A. Hines, Chairman, Subcomm. on Nat’l Sec., Int’l Dev. & Monetary Policy).  \nThat hearing examined the need for additional COVID-related assistance to small and minority-owned \nbusinesses.  See id.  \nIII.  The Proposed RESTAURANTS Act \nOn June 15, 2020, Representative Earl Blumenauer introduced the RESTAURANTS Act, \nwhich  proposed  “[t]o  establish  a  $120,000,000,000  Restaurant  Revitalization  Fund  to  provide \nstructured  relief  to  food  service  or  drinking  establishments  through  December  31,  2020.” \nRESTAURANTS Act of 2020, H.R. 7197, 116th Cong. (2020).1  The RESTAURANTS Act included \n                                                 \n1 The full title of the bill is the Real Economic Support That Acknowledges Unique Restaurant \nAssistance Needed To Survive Act of 2020.   \n4 \n\na priority scheme whereby “[d]uring the initial 14-day period in which the Secretary awards grants \nunder  this  section,  the  Secretary  shall  (1)  prioritize  awarding  grants  to  marginalized  and \nunderrepresented communities, with a focus on women and minority-owned and operated eligible \nentities; and (2) only award grants to eligible entities with annual revenues of less than $1,500,000.”  \nId.  § 4(d).  The RESTAURANTS Act did not expressly define “marginalized and underrepresented \ncommunities” or “women and minority-owned and operated . . . entities.”  Id.  The RESTAURANTS \nAct was not enacted in the 116th Congress.   \nOn February 4, 2021, Representative Blumenauer reintroduced the RESTAURANTS Act.  \nRESTAURANTS Act of 2021, H.R. 793, 116th Cong. (2021).  This version of the bill also provided \nfor a fourteen-day priority period, this time instructing the Secretary to “prioritize awarding grants to \nmarginalized and underrepresented communities, with a focus on women, veteran, and minority-\nowned and operated eligible entities” and to only award grants to eligible entities whose revenues were \nless than $1,500,000 in 2019.  Id. § 4(d).  The RESTAURANTS Act has not been enacted as a \nstandalone law; however, many of its features were included in Section 5003 of the American Rescue \nPlan Act.  See pages 5-8 (discussing Section 5003).   \nIV.  The American Rescue Plan Act and Restaurant Revitalization Fund  \nOn March 11, 2021, Congress enacted ARPA, which provides widespread COVID-related \nrelief to the American people and businesses, including restaurants.  See American Rescue Plan Act, \nPub. L. No. 117-2 (2021) (“ARPA”).  ARPA “takes a multipronged approach to tackle the public \nhealth and economic crises resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.”  H.R. Rep. No. 117-7 at 3 \n(2021).  The House Report accompanying the bill makes clear that Congress was focused on the ways \nin which the nation’s “most vulnerable communities are forced to bear the brunt of” both the \ncoronavirus pandemic and the resultant economic crisis “as underlying health and economic inequities \ngrow worse.”  Id. at 2.  The House Report explained that “underlying racial, wealth, social, and gender \ndisparities are exacerbated by the pandemic,” that “[w]omen – especially mothers and women of color \n– are exiting the workforce at alarming rates,” and that “eight out of ten minority-owned businesses \nare on the brink of closure.”  Id. at 2.  The Act is intended to “provide crucial support for the hardest-\n5 \n\nhit  small  businesses,  especially  those  owned  by  entrepreneurs  who  have  experienced  systemic \ndiscrimination.”  Id. at 3.  \nAs relevant here, Section 5003 of ARPA established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and \nappropriated $28.6 billion to the fund for fiscal year 2021.  ARPA § 5003(b)(1)-(2).  Section 5003 \nincludes a priority period for certain businesses.  Specifically, Section 5003 instructs that in the first 21 \ndays that grants are awarded through the Fund, the Small Business Administrator  \nshall prioritize awarding grants to eligible entities that are small business concerns \nowned and controlled by women (as defined in section 3(n) of the Small Business Act \n(15 U.S.C. 632(n)), small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans (as \ndefined in section 3(q) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q))), or socially and economically \ndisadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4)(A) of the Small \nBusiness Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A))).   \nARPA § 5003(c)(3)(A).  Under the relevant statute, a small business concern is “owned and controlled \nby women” if at least 51 percent of the business concern is owned by one or more women, and the \nmanagement and daily business operations of the business are controlled by one or more women.  15 \nU.S.C. § 632(n).  Similarly, a small business concern is “owned and controlled by veterans” if at least \n51 percent of the business is owned by one or more veterans and the management and daily operations \nof the business are controlled by one or more veterans.  Id. § 632(q)(3).  Under Section 8(a) of the \nSmall Business Act2, a “socially and economically disadvantaged small business concern” is at least 51 \nowned by “one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,” “an economically \ndisadvantaged Indian tribe,” or “an economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian organization,” \nwhere the management and daily business operations are controlled by the same.  Id. § 637(a)(4)(A)).   \n  Section 8(a) defines “socially disadvantaged individuals” to include “those who have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group \nwithout regard to their individual qualities.”  Id. § 637(5).  The RRF application adopts this statutory \n                                                 \n2 Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act permits the federal government to limit the issuance of certain \ngovernment contracts to certain small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically \ndisadvantaged individuals that participate in the Section 8(a) program.  15 U.S.C. § 637(1); see also 8(a) \nBusiness  Development  Program,  U.S.  Small  Bus.  Admin.,  https://www.sba.gov/federal-\ncontracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program.   \n6 \n\ndefinition, and its instructions further provide that individuals who are members of the following \ngroups are “presumed to be socially disadvantaged: Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native \nAmericans  (including  Alaska  Natives  and  Native  Hawaiians),  Asian  Pacific  Americans,  and \nSubcontinent Asian Americans.”  Declaration of Anthony Vitolo (“Vitolo Decl.”), ECF No. 12-3, Ex \n3.  Those designated groups track the groups identified in SBA regulations related to Section 8(a).  See \n13 C.F.R. § 124.103(b)(1).  Under those regulations, a presumption may be rebutted with “credible \nevidence to the contrary,” see id. at § 124.103(b)(3), and individuals who are not members of one of \nthese  groups  may  demonstrate  social  disadvantage  by  submitting  evidence  that  shows,  by  a \npreponderance of the evidence, that a distinguishing characteristic has contributed to substantial social \ndisadvantage, which has limited their entry or advancement in the business world.  Id. § 124.103(c)(1)-\n(2).  Thus, an individual’s race may create a presumption that he or she is socially disadvantaged, but \nindividuals who are not members of the enumerated groups may still be socially disadvantaged.   \nSection 8(a) defines “economically disadvantaged individuals” as “those socially disadvantaged \nindividuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished \ncapital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially \ndisadvantaged.”  Id. § 637(6)(A).  On the RRF application, the SBA states that in assessing economic \ndisadvantage, it will look at an individual’s net worth, average income over the past three years, and \nthe fair market value of the individual’s assets.3  Vitolo Decl., Ex. 3.  If an individual exceeds certain \nthresholds on any of those three metrics, he or she “will generally be deemed not to be economically \ndisadvantaged.”  Id.  This approach largely tracks SBA regulations related to Section 8(a).  13 C.F.R. § \n                                                 \n3 Specifically, “[i]n assessing economic disadvantage, SBA will look at whether the net worth of the \nindividual claiming disadvantage is less than $750,000, excluding his or her ownership interest in the \nApplicant, primary personal residence, contingent liabilities, funds invested in an official retirement \naccount, or income received from an S-corporation, LLC, or partnership if the individual provides \ndocumentation that the income was reinvested in the firm.  SBA will also look at whether the adjusted \ngross income of the individual averaged over the preceding three years exceeds $350,000. Income \nreceived from an S-corporation, LLC or partnership that is reinvested in the firm or used to pay taxes \narising in the normal operations of the firm is excluded.  Finally, SBA will look at whether the fair \nmarket value of all the individual’s assets (excluding his or her ownership interest in the Applicant, \nprimary personal residence, or funds invested in an official retirement account) exceeds $6 million.” \nVitolo Decl., Ex. 3.   \n7 \n\n124.104(c).  Because the priority period is open to “socially and economically disadvantaged” \nindividuals, a restaurant owner who is presumptively socially disadvantaged must also be economically \ndisadvantaged in order to participate in the priority period. \nShortly after ARPA’s enactment, SBA prepared to administer the RRF.  On May 3, 2021, SBA \nbegan accepting applications.  The RRF application explains that “[i]n accordance with the American \nRescue Plan Act of 2021, SBA will prioritize awarding funds to Applicants that are small business \nconcerns at least 51 percent owned and controlled by individuals who are women, veterans, and/or \nsocially and economically disadvantaged individuals.”  Decl. of Dianna L. Seaborn (“Seaborn Decl.”), \nEx. A at 1.  Applicants are then asked to check a box if “[a]s of the date of this application, Applicant \nis a small business concern at least 51 percent owned and controlled by: one or more women; \n[v]eteran(s);  [and/or]  [s]ocially  and  economically  disadvantaged  individual(s).”    Id.  at  2.    The \napplication does not require that an individual be predetermined by SBA to qualify as a socially and \neconomically disadvantaged individual.  Id.  The application does not ask whether an applicant is a \nmember of a particular racial or ethnic group that is presumed to be socially disadvantaged.  Id.  The \napplication does contain an optional request for each applicant’s demographic information.  Seaborn \nDecl., Ex B.   \nV.  This Litigation  \nOn May 12, 2021, Plaintiffs filed this action.  See Compl., ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs allege that the \npriority period set out in Section 5003 unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of race and sex, in \nviolation of the Equal Protection and Due Process guarantees of the United States Constitution.  \nCompl. ¶¶ 38-39.  That same day, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (ECF. \nNo. 12), a motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 11), and a brief in support of both motions \n(ECF No. 12-2 (“Pls.’ Br.”)).  Plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief later that evening (ECF No. 15).  \nThe Court ordered a hearing on the TRO motion for May 17, 2021.4  Order, ECF No. 16.   \n                                                 \n4 Although Plaintiffs filed only one brief in support of their request for both a temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction, the Court ordered a hearing only on the TRO motion.  While the \nlegal standard for TROs and preliminary injunctions overlap, Defendant respectfully requests that—\n8 \n\nLEGAL STANDARD  \n  “A temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy.”  Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. v. \nDees, No. 3:16-cv-222, 2016 WL 8738436 (Aug. 29, 2016) (quoting Hacker v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 450 \nF. Supp. 2d 705 710 (E.D. Mich. 2006)); see also Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 \n(2008).  The burden is on the party seeking the injunctive relief.  Thomas v. Schroer, 116 F. Supp. 3d \n869, 874 (W.D. Tenn. 2015); see also Hartman v. Acton, No. 2:20-cv-01952, 2020 WL 1932896, at *2 \n(S.D. Ohio Apr. 21, 2020) (“The ‘burden of proving that the circumstances ‘clearly demand’ such an \nextraordinary remedy is a heavy one’ since ‘the party seeking ‘the injunction must establish its case by \nclear and convincing evidence.’”). \nIn determining whether to issue a temporary restraining order, the Court examines (1) whether \nthe movant has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant will suffer \nirreparable harm if the injunction is not issued; (3) whether the issuance of the injunction would cause \nsubstantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuing the \ninjunction.  See Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cty. Gov’t., 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002).   The \nfinal two factors “merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n435 (2009).  “When a court considers the four factors as part of a constitutional challenge, ‘the \nlikelihood of success on the merits will often be the determinative factor.’”  Michigan Rest. & Lodging \nAss’n v. Gordon, No. 1:20-cv-1104, 2020 WL 6866649, at *1 (W.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2020) (quoting \nThompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 615 (6th Cir. 2020)); Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423,436 (6th \nCir. 2012) (quoting Jones v. Caruso, 569 F.3d 258, 265 (6th Cir. 2009)). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claim.  \nA.  The Government’s Prioritization of Businesses Owned by “Socially and Economically \nDisadvantaged Individuals” Is Constitutional.  \n                                                 \nin the event the Court grants the requested TRO—the Court provide Defendant an opportunity to \nsubmit supplemental briefing in response to the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \n9 \n\nAlthough the statutory definition of “socially disadvantaged individual” cited in Section 5003 \nis race-neutral, SBA regulations and the RRF application include a presumption of social disadvantage \nthat is race-conscious and subject to strict scrutiny.  See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, \n227 (1995) (holding that “all racial classifications” imposed by governmental actors “must be analyzed \nby the reviewing court under strict scrutiny”).  Under strict scrutiny, “[w]hen race-based action is \nnecessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional \nguarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.”  Grutter v. \nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326 (2003).  Although the test for strict scrutiny is rigorous, the Supreme Court \nhas cautioned that it should not be interpreted as “strict in theory, but fatal in fact.”  Adarand, 515 \nU.S. at 237 (internal quotation marks omitted).  “The unhappy persistence of both the practice and \nthe lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate \nreality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.”  Id.   \ni.  The Priority Application Period Serves a Compelling Government Interest.  \nTo survive strict scrutiny, the government must advance a compelling government interest \nand show a “strong basis in evidence supporting its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.”  \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabnik, 214 F.3d 730, 735 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting City of \nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 486-92 (1989)).  Congress is not entitled to deference in its \nultimate conclusion that race-based relief is necessary, but that “does not mean that Congress is \nentitled to no deference in its factfinding.”  Rothe Dev. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 262 F.3d 1306, 1321 \nn.14 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at 500).  After the government makes its initial showing, \nthe  burden  shifts  to  the  plaintiff  to  present  “credible,  particularized  evidence”  to  rebut  the \ngovernment’s “initial showing of a compelling interest.”  Concrete Works of Colo., Inc. v. City and Cnty. of \nDenver, 321 F.3d 950, 959 (10th Cir. 2003)). \nGovernments have a compelling interest in “remedying the effects of past or present racial \ndiscrimination.”  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 909 (1996); United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 166 \n(1987) (“It is now well established that government bodies, including courts, may constitutionally \n10 \n\nemploy racial classifications essential to remedy unlawful treatment of racial or ethnic groups subject \nto discrimination.”); Associated Gen. Contractors, 214 F.3d at 735 (“There is no question that remedying \nthe effects of past discrimination constitutes a compelling governmental interest”).  In particular, \n“[t]he federal government has a compelling interest in ensuring that its funding is not distributed in a \nmanner that perpetuates the effects of either public or private discrimination.”  W. States Paving Co., \nInc. v. Wash. State Dep’t of Transp., 407 F.3d 983, 991 (9th Cir. 2005).  The government can meet its \nburden without conclusively proving the existence of racial discrimination in the past or present.  See \nDynaLantic Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense, 885 F. Supp. 2d 237, 250 (D.D.C. 2012) (citing Wygant v. Jackson \nBd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 292 (1986) (O’Connor, J., concurring)); Concrete Works, 321 F.3d at 958.  \nPlaintiff suggests that the government can only have a compelling interest in remedying its own past \ndiscrimination, see Pls.’ Br. at 12 (citing Michigan Rd. Builders Ass’n v. Milliken, 834 F.2d 583, 589 (6th \nCir. 1987)), but “the government ‘has a compelling interest in assuring that public dollars . . . do not \nserve to finance the evil of private prejudice.”  Associated Gen. Contractors, 214 F.3d at 734-35 (citing \nCroson, 488 U.S. at 492).  And the Sixth Circuit has expressly held that a government may have a \ncompelling interest where the state “was a passive participant in private industry’s discriminatory \npractices.”  Associated Gen. Contractors, 214 F.3d at 735 (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at 486-92, 500).  \nMoreover, the case law that Plaintiff relies upon predates the Supreme Court’s decision in Grutter v. \nBollinger, where the Court expressly noted that it “ha[d] never held that the only governmental use of \nrace that can survive strict scrutiny is remedying past discrimination.”  539 U.S. at 328 (holding that a \nlaw school “has a compelling interest in attaining a diverse student body”). \nHere, the government has a compelling interest in remedying the effects of past and present \ndiscrimination that led to socially and economically disadvantaged business owners having less access \nto capital and credit, including capital and credit provided through prior COVID relief efforts.  The \ngovernment likewise has a compelling interest in supporting small businesses owned by socially and \neconomically disadvantaged small business owners who have borne an outsized burden of the \neconomic harms of COVID-19 pandemic.   \n11 \n\nCongress has long sought to remedy past discrimination against socially and economically \ndisadvantaged small business owners.  As explained above, Section 5003 imports the term “socially \nand economically disadvantaged” from Section 8(a) of Small Business Act, which the SBA has further \naddressed through the relevant regulations.  See ARPA § 5003(c)(3)(A) (citing 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A)); \nsee also 13 C.F.R. § 124.103; 13 C.F.R. § 124.104.  The legislative history of the Section 8(a) program \nand a significant body of post-enactment evidence supports the government’s compelling interest in \n“breaking down barriers to minority business development created by discrimination and its lingering \neffects.”  DynaLantic Corp., 885 F. Supp. 2d at 270 (D.D.C. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nFor example, in 1972, the House Select Committee on Small Business issued a report addressing the \nproblems confronting minority entrepreneurs, which recognized that minority small business owners \nexperience racial and ethnic prejudice that leads to “almost insurmountable obstacles to business \ndevelopment.”  H.R. Rep. No. 92-1615, at 18-19 (1972).  In 1975, another congressional report from \nthe Subcommittee on Small Business Administration Oversight and Minority Enterprise of the House \nCommittee on Small Business found that:  \n[T]he effects of past inequities stemming from racial prejudice have not remained in \nthe past. The Congress has recognized the reality that past discriminatory practices \nhave, to some degree, adversely affected our present economic system . . . . These \nstatistics are not the result of random chance. The presumption must be made that \npast discriminatory systems have resulted in present economic inequities.  In order to \nright this situation, the Congress has formulated certain remedial programs designed \nto uplift those socially or economically disadvantaged persons to a level where they \nmay effectively participate in the business mainstream of our economy. \nH.R. Rep. No. 94-468, at 1-2 (1975)).  In 1977, the House Committee on Small Business issued a \nreport reviewing the SBA’s Surety Bond Guarantee Program, which found that:  \nThe very basic problem disclosed by the testimony is that, over the years, there has \ndeveloped a business system which has traditionally excluded measurable minority \nparticipation. In the past more than the present, this system of conducting business \ntransactions overtly precluded minority input. Currently, we more often encounter a \nbusiness system which is racially neutral on its face, but because of past overt social \nand economic discrimination is presently operating, in effect, to perpetuate these past \ninequities. \nH.R. Rep. No. 94-1791, at 182 (1977).   \nWhen Congress codified the Section 8(a) program in 1978, it included the finding that  \n12 \n\nmany. . . persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members \nof certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar \ninvidious circumstances over which they have no control; [and] . . . that such groups \ninclude,  but  are  not  limited  to,  Black  Americans,  Hispanic  Americans,  Native \nAmericans, and other minorities. \nPub. L. No. 95-507 § 201 (1978).  The Conference Report explained that these findings “[e]stablish \nthe premise that many individuals are socially and economically disadvantaged as a result of being \nidentified as members of a certain group” and thus in many cases, “status as a minority can be directly \nand unequivocally correlated with social disadvantagement . . . regardless of the individual, personal \nqualities of that minority person.”  H.R Rep. No. 95-1714, at 20-21 (1978)).   \n  In the 1980s, Congress revisited the Section 8(a) program and concluded that disparities still \nexisted between minority and non-minority businesses and that such disparities were “not the result \nof random chance.”  H.R. Rep. No. 100-460, at 18 (1987).  A 1987 House Report explained that \n“discrimination and the present effects of past discrimination have hurt socially and economically \ndisadvantaged individuals in their entrepreneurial endeavors” and that “[i]t is a legitimate purpose of \ngovernment to correct the imbalance caused by discrimination.”  Id.  Over the past three decades, \nfurther evidence has shown that race-based denial of access to capital and credit has not diminished.  \nSee DynaLantic, 885 F. Supp. 2d at 257-62 (summarizing evidence of barriers to minority business \nformation from the 1990s and 2000s).  Because Section 8(a) addresses government contracting, much \nof  this  evidence  focuses  on  the  ways  in  which  discrimination  has  prevented  minority-owned \nbusinesses from competing for government contracts.  But many of the Congressional findings go \nbeyond that context and address larger problems for minority-owned small businesses in general.    \nIt is against this backdrop that Congress decided to create a priority period for RRF applicants \nowned by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.”  ARPA § 5003(c)(3)(A).  But \nCongress was not acting based solely on historical information about the hurdles faced by socially and \neconomically disadvantaged individuals.  Over the past year, Congress as a whole (and the House \nCommittee on Small Business in particular) recognized that COVID-19 has had a particularly \ndevastating impact on small businesses owned by minorities and women, and that prior COVID relief \nefforts have not always successfully reached these businesses due to financial disparities rooted in \n13 \n\nracial discrimination, particularly in the lending industry.  As the House Committee on the Budget \nexplained in the House Report on ARPA, Congress recognized that “underlying racial, wealth, social, \nand gender disparities are exacerbated by the pandemic,” that “[w]omen – especially mothers and \nwomen of color – are exiting the workforce at alarming rates,” and that “eight out of ten minority-\nowned businesses are on the brink of closure.”  H.R. Rep. 117-7, at 2 (2021).  ARPA intended to \nremedy that issue in part by “provid[ing] crucial support for the hardest-hit small businesses, especially \nthose owned by entrepreneurs who have experienced systemic discrimination.”  Id. at 3. \nCongress has consistently stressed its desire to provide this kind of support to the hardest-hit \nsmall businesses.  For example, during the June 17, 2020 Committee on Small Business hearing on \nPPP loans, the committee heard testimony from Ashley C. Harrington, the Federal Advocacy Director \nand Senior Counsel of the Center for Responsible Lending.  Ms. Harrington testified regarding a \nnumber  of  ways  in  which  structural  limitations  of  the  PPP  program  harmed  minority-owned \nbusinesses.  See Paycheck Protection Program: Loan Forgiveness & Other Challenges: Hearing Before the H. Comm. \non Small Bus., 116 Cong. 10 (June 17, 2020) (statement of Ashley C. Harrington, Fed. Advocacy Dir. & \nSr. Counsel, Ctr. for Responsible Lending).  In her written testimony, Ms. Harrington explained that \n“[b]usinesses headed by people of color are less likely to have employees, have fewer employees when \nthey do, and have less revenue compared to white-owned businesses” because of “structural inequities \nresulting from less wealth compared to whites who were able to accumulate wealth with the support \nof public policies,” and that having fewer employees or lower revenue made PPP loans to those \nbusinesses less lucrative for lenders.  Id. at 59 (written statement of Ashley C. Harrington, Fed. \nAdvocacy Dir. & Sr. Counsel, Ctr. for Responsible Lending).  She also explained that certain features \nof the PPP program ensured that “businesses with existing conventional lending relationships were \nmore likely to access PPP funds quickly and efficiently,” and that racial minorities are less likely to \nhave such relationships with lenders due to “pre-existing disparities in access to capital.”  Id. at 59-60.  \nMs. Harrington cited a study which showed that when Black and Hispanic individuals went to apply \nfor loans, they “were required to produce more documentation to support their loan application and \nreceived less information about fees, and less friendly service when visiting a small business lender.”  \n14 \n\nId. at 60 (citing Disinvestment, Discouragement and Inequality in Small Business Lending, Nat’l Community \nReinvestment  Coalition  (2019),  https://ncrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCRC-Small-\nBusiness-Research-FINAL.pdf).    Ms.  Harrington  ended  her  written  remarks  by  imploring  the \nCommittee that “[w]e cannot allow federal policies and investments to continue the centuries old \npractice of excluding people of color.”  Id. at 72.     \nDuring a July 15, 2020 hearing, the Committee on Small Business once again heard about the \nparticular impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority- and women-owned businesses.  Prior to \nthe  hearing,  Committee  Chairwoman  Velázquez  issued  a  memorandum  explaining  that  “[t]he \nCOVID-19 public health and economic crisis has disproportionally affected Black, Hispanic, and \nAsian-owned businesses, in addition to women-owned businesses” and that “minority-owned and \nwomen-owned businesses were particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, given their concentration in \npersonal services firms, lower cash reserves, and less access to credit.”  See July 15, 2020 Memo. at 4-\n5 (citing Robert W. Fairlie, The Impact of COVID-19 on Small Business Owners: Evidence of Early-Stage Losses \nfrom  the  April  2020  Current  Population  Survey,  NBER  (June  2020), \nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w27309).  Witnesses at the hearing also testified about the outsized \nimpact of the pandemic on minority-owned businesses.  See Long-Lasting Solutions for A Small Business \nRecovery: Hearing Before the Comm. on Small Bus., 116 Cong. 6 (2020) (statement of Brett Palmer, Pres., \nSmall Bus. Investor All.) (discussing the “catastrophic failure of minority-owned small businesses” \nincluding estimates that “while 22 percent of small businesses” overall, “32 percent of Hispanic-owned \nsmall businesses and up to 41-percent of Black-owned businesses” are now out of business); see also \nid. at 10 (statement of Dr. Lisa D. Cook, Prof. of Economics, Michigan State Univ.) (discussing how \n“[f]orty-one percent of African American businesses reported being closed compared to 35 percent \noverall” and that one study “reports that 45 percent of Black and Latino businesses will close by the \nend of the year without more relief.”).  During that hearing, witnesses explained that this discrepancy \nwas due in part to minority business owners’ difficulties in accessing capital.  Brett Palmer, President \nof the Small Business Investor Alliance, emphasized the “[u]nderrepresentation by women and \nminorities in both funds and in small businesses accessing capital.”  Id. at 6 (statement of Brett Palmer).  \n15 \n\nMr. Palmer further noted that “[t]he amount of startup capital that a Black entrepreneur has versus a \nWhite entrepreneur is about 1/36th.”  Id. at 16.  One study included in the hearing record confirmed \nthat “[g]ender and race influence small business owners’ ability to access credit.”  Id. at 55 (Brown, \nKenyon, Robinson, Filling the U.S. Small Business Funding Gap (Feb. 2020)).  The study acknowledges a \nnumber of reasons why that might be true, including (1) that “[m]inorities, on average, have a lower \nhousehold net worth than whites, which directly affects loan size and increases the rate of loan denial”; \n(2) that minority business owners typically have lower credit scores; (3) that women and minorities are \ndisproportionately more likely to not apply for credit due to fear of credit denial; and (4) that women \nand minority investment professionals are underrepresented in the venture capital and private equity \nindustry, which leads to less investment in diverse companies.  Id at 55-56.  Dr. Lisa Cook, a professor \nof economics at Michigan State University, noted that in many cases, minority-owned businesses \nstruggled to access earlier COVID relief funding, such as PPP loans, “due to the heavy reliance on \nlarge banks, with whom they have had historically poor relationships.”  Id. at 10 (statement of Dr. Lisa \nD. Cook).     \nOther testimony supported the conclusion that racial minorities’ struggles to access capital and \ncredit are rooted in historic and present-day discrimination.  In connection with the February 4, 2021 \nsubcommittee hearing on pandemic relief for small and minority-owned businesses, researchers from \nthe  Brookings  Institute  submitted  written  testimony  addressing  “long-standing  structural  racial \ndisparities in small business ownership and performance.”  Supporting Small Bus. & Minority-Owned Bus. \nThrough the Pandemic: Virtual Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Nat’l Sec., Int’l Dev., & Monetary Policy of the H. \nComm. on Fin. Servs., 117th Cong. 60 (Feb. 4, 2021) (written testimony of Sifan Liu, Sci. Res. Analyst, \n& Joseph Parilla, Fellow, Brookings Metro. Policy Program).  Specifically, the testimony highlighted \nstudies showing that “the playing field is uneven for entrepreneurs of color on key factors, including \nconsumer perceptions, access to finance, and social capital.”  Id.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s \n2020 Small Business Credit Survey shows that large banks “approve around 67% of loans sought by \nwhite small-business owners, 43% of those sought by Latino or Hispanic small-business owners, and \njust 29% of those sought by Black small-business owners.”  Id. (citing 2020 Small Business Credit \n16 \n\nSurvey, https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2020/report-on-employer-firms).  The testimony \nfurther  explained  that  “[b]ecause  the  enduring  impact  of  structural  racism  compounds  over \ngenerations, minority entrepreneurs also have less exposure to business ownership within their \nfamilies, and lower levels of family wealth to draw from as startup capital or collateral.”  Id.   \nAt that same subcommittee hearing, the Center for Responsible Lending submitted a written \nstatement addressing “overtly discriminatory practices by lenders” and “facially neutral practices with \ndisparate effects” that make it more difficult for minority-owned businesses to access capital than \nwhite-owned businesses.  Id. at 70 (statement for the record of Ctr. for Responsible Lending).  The \nCenter for Responsible Lending specifically recommended that a certain amount of “small business \nrelief dollars should be allocated for the purpose of supporting small minority-, women-, and veteran-\nowned businesses that have been neglected or otherwise underserved by the original Paycheck \nProtection Program, the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, or any other federal assistance \nprogram,” and that access to that grant program should be limited to “those that qualify as ‘socially \nand economically disadvantaged’ individuals as defined in the Small Business Act.”  Id. at 71.   \nii.  The Priority Period Is Narrowly Tailored to Achieve the Government’s Compelling \nInterest.   \nOnce the government has identified a compelling interest, the court’s attention turns to \nwhether “the means chosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose [are] specifically and \nnarrowly framed to accomplish that purpose.”  Grutter, 539 U.S. at 333.   \nIn order to assess whether the RRF priority period is narrowly tailored, it is important to \nunderstand how the SBA defines “socially and economically disadvantaged.”  Plaintiff asserts that the \n“SBA has treated [him] differently because of [his] race,” and suggests that he is not eligible for the \npriority period because he is white.  Vitolo Decl. ¶ 18.  But that claim is based on a misunderstanding \nof the definition of “socially disadvantaged individuals.”  Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act—and \nthus Section 5003 of ARPA, which adopts this definition—defines that term to include “those who \nhave been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member \nof a group without regard to their individual qualities.”  15 U.S.C. § 637(5).  That definition appears \n17 \n\nin the SBA’s online guide to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, which Plaintiff purports to have \nreviewed and relied upon.  See Vitolo Decl. ¶ 15 & Ex. 7.  SBA’s regulations similarly state that “socially \ndisadvantaged individuals are those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural \nbias within American society because of their identities as members of groups and without regard to \ntheir individual qualities” where “[t]he social disadvantage . . . stem[s] from circumstances beyond \ntheir control.”  13 C.F.R. § 124.103(a).  SBA’s Restaurant Revitalization Fund Program Guide cites \nthose  regulations.    See  Program  Guide  at  22  (Apr.  28,  2021),  available  at  \nhttps://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-\n04/Restaurant%20Revitalization%20Fund%20Program%20Guide%20as%20of%204.28.21-\n508_0.pdf.   \nNeither of these definitions categorically excludes white men like the plaintiff.  The SBA \nregulations (and the RRF application) do include a race-conscious presumption that certain individuals \nare socially disadvantaged, including Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian \nPacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans.  13 C.F.R. § 124.103(b)(1).  That presumption \nmay be “overcome with credible evidence to the contrary.”  Id. § 124.103(b)(3).  Moreover, the \nregulations expressly contemplate that an individual who is not a member of one of these groups \ncould still be “socially disadvantaged.”  See id. § 124.103(c).  To qualify as “socially disadvantaged” \nwithout the presumption, for purposes of the Section 8(a) program, an individual must point to “[a]t \nleast one objective distinguishing feature that has contributed to social disadvantage, such as race, \nethnic origin, gender, physical handicap, long-term residence in an environment isolated from the \nmainstream of American society, or other similar causes not common to individuals who are not \nsocially disadvantaged.”  Id. § 124.103(c)(2)(i).  The individual’s social disadvantage “must be rooted \nin treatment which he or she was experienced in American society,” “must be chronic and substantial,” \nand “must have negatively impacted . . . his or her entry into or advancement in the business world.”  \nId. § 124.103(c)(2)(ii)-(iv).  Thus, contrary to plaintiff’s assertion, a white man could be eligible for \npriority status as a “socially disadvantaged” individual.   \n18 \n\n  Because the regulations were initially written to apply to the Section 8(a) program, which \ninvolves a more detailed application and approval process, they contemplate a process by which an \nindividual claiming to be “socially disadvantaged” would present corroborating evidence, see id. § \n123.103(c); however, the RRF application does not require any evidence of an individual’s socially \ndisadvantaged status or a predetermination by SBA that the applicant would qualify for such status.  \nInstead, applicants are asked to check a box that states whether the applicant is “a small business \nconcern at least 51 percent owned and controlled by” one or more women; veteran(s); and/or socially \nand economically disadvantaged individuals.  Seaborn Decl., Ex. A; see also Vitolo Decl., Ex 3 (“To be \neligible for priority in awarding Restaurant Revitalization Funds, Applicants must self-certify that they \nmeet the definition of any of the following priority Applicants”).  Thus, a socially disadvantaged \nindividual could self-certify to that status regardless of his or her race, if he or she otherwise met the \nqualifications.5  \nThe Supreme Court has identified several factors that are relevant in determining whether a \nracial classification is narrowly tailored, including “the efficacy of alternative remedies; the flexibility \nand duration of the relief, including the availability of waiver provisions; the relationship of the \nnumerical goals to the relevant labor market; and the impact of the relief on the rights of third parties.”  \nParadise, 480 U.S. at 171.   \n“Narrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative,” \nthough it does “require serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.”  \nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 339; see also Adarand, 515 U.S. at 237-38 (courts must inquire “whether there was \n                                                 \n5  Plaintiff contends that his application was “pushed to the back of the queue” because he disclosed \non the application that his race was “white” and his gender was “male.”  See Compl. ¶ 21.  But Plaintiff \ndisclosed that demographic information in a separate section of the application, which indicated that \nsuch information was optional.  See Seaborn Decl., Ex. B.  The paper version of the RRF application \nmakes clear that such information is “[o]ptional,” “collected for program reporting purpose only,” \n“voluntary,” and “will have no bearing on the application decision.”  SBA Form 2172 at 11, \nhttps://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2021-\n04/SBA%20Form%203172%20RRF%20Application%204.20.21-508.pdf.  In other words, Plaintiff’s \ndemographic information was not used to determine whether he belonged to a priority group—that \ndetermination was based on the checkbox earlier in the application, which he declined to check.  \n19 \n\nany consideration of the use of race-neutral means” to achieve goal).  As an initial matter, Section \n5003 does not exist in a vacuum; rather, it was developed in the shadow of a year-long effort to provide \nrelief to small businesses suffering amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.  As noted during various \nCongressional hearings throughout 2020 and 2021, many of the government’s earlier race-neutral relief \nprograms did not reach minority-owned businesses, particularly during the first few days of those \nprograms.  See pages 13-17.  As a result, minority-owned business were often shut out of those relief \nprograms altogether.  Section 5003’s priority period is an effort to remedy this problem.   \nThe RRF priority period is also “appropriately limited such that it ‘will not last longer than the \ndiscriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate.’”  Adarand, 515 U.S. at 238 (quoting Fullilove v. \nKlutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 513 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring)).  The priority period runs for the first \ntwenty-one days of the program, ensuring that women and socially and economically disadvantaged \nbusiness owners have an opportunity to access available funding; however, after twenty-one days, any \nbusiness is eligible to receive funding.  Thus, this is a short duration program that will not outlast the \ndiscriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate.  Moreover, Congress only appropriated $28.6 billion \nto fund the RRF; if Congress wishes to provide more money to the fund, it will need to appropriate \nadditional funds (and in the process, evaluate whether imposition of a new priority period is \nappropriate).  Cf. W. States, 407 F.3d at 994 (finding that a program complies with this requirement \n“because it is subject to periodic reauthorization by Congress”); Sherbrooke Turf, Inc. v. Minn. Dep’t of \nTransp., 345 F.3d 964, 972 (8th Cir. 2003) (same).   \nThe RRF priority period includes a number of provisions designed to provide flexibility and \nminimize the burden on non-minority restaurant owners.  As explained above, a white male restaurant \nowner can still qualify for the priority period if he indicates that he is socially and economically \ndisadvantaged.  And the net worth, income, and asset limitations “ensure that wealthy minorities who \nhave not encountered discriminatory impediments do not receive an unwarranted windfall” through \nthe RRF priority period.  W. States, 407 F.3d at 995 (addressing net worth limitations in context of \nsimilar minority preference program set forth in U.S. Department of Transportation regulations); \nSherbrooke Turf, 345 F.3d 964 at 972 (same).  \n20 \n\nPlaintiffs specifically challenge the racial presumption as overinclusive because it includes a \nlarge number of minority groups and as underinclusive because it fails to include other minority groups \n(namely certain Asian-Americans).  But the priority period is not overinclusive.  First, it is not available \nto all “socially disadvantaged” business owners, but only those business owners who are also \n“economically disadvantaged,” and thus it is narrowly tailored to reach those business owners who \nare  experiencing  economic  effects  of  discrimination.    Additionally,  as  explained  above,  the \npresumption of social disadvantage set forth in SBA regulations is rebuttable, so a member of one of \nthe specified minority groups who is not actually socially disadvantaged would not qualify for the \npriority period.  13 C.F.R. § 124.103(b)(3).  Nor is the category of “socially disadvantaged” and \n“economically disadvantaged” individuals underinclusive.  Plaintiff’s sole argument on this point is \nthat the “SBA’s regulations pick and choose among Asian-Americans,” Pls.’ Br. at 15, but that \nargument misunderstands the definition of “socially disadvantaged,” which is not so limited.  It is true \nthat SBA regulations contain a rebuttable presumption that certain Asian-Americans are socially \ndisadvantaged, including “Asian Pacific Americans” and “Subcontinent Asian Americans.”  13 C.F.R. \n§ 124.103(b)(1).  But the regulations also provide that “[a]n individual who is not a member of one of \nthe groups presumed to be socially disadvantaged” can establish “individual social disadvantage” by a \npreponderance of the evidence.  Id. § 124.103(c)(1).  And as explained above, to be considered for the \npriority group in the RRF application process, an applicant need only self-certify that he is “eligible \nfor priority in awarding grants” by virtue of being “a small business concern at least 51 percent owned \nand controlled by” one or more women; veteran(s); and/or socially and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals.6  \n                                                 \n6 Moreover, the regulation also provides that “[r]epresentatives of an identifiable group whose \nmembers believe that the group has suffered chronic racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias may \npetition SBA to be included as a presumptively socially disadvantaged group under paragraph (b)(1) \nof this section.”  13 C.F.R. § 124.103(d)(1).  Although it is admittedly unlikely that a group could have \npetitioned SBA to be included in the time between the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act \nand the opening of RRF applications on May 3, 2021, the availability of this process demonstrates that \nthe SBA has made significant efforts to ensure that the rebuttable presumption available more \ngenerally in its programs applies to groups that have “suffered chronic racial or ethnic prejudice or \ncultural bias.”  Id.   \n21 \n\nB.  The Government’s Prioritization of Women-Owned Businesses Is Constitutional.   \nPlaintiffs also challenge Section 5003’s prioritization of women-owned businesses, see Pls.’ Br. \n11, but that too is constitutional.  At the outset, classifications based on gender are subject to \nintermediate  scrutiny,  meaning  that  the  challenged  classification  must  “serve[]  important \ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the \nachievement of those objectives.”  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 33 (1996) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nIn this case, Section 5003’s prioritization of women-owned businesses serves the important \ngovernmental objective of assisting with the economic recovery of women-owned businesses, which \nwere “disproportionately affected” by the COVID-19 pandemic for many of the same reasons as \nminority-owned businesses—namely, “their concentration in personal services firms, lower cash \nreserves, and less access to credit.”  July 15, 2020 Memo. at 4-5.  In enacting this gender preference, \nCongress did not rely on “overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or \npreferences of males and females.”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  Instead, it relied on actual data regarding \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women-owned businesses.  For example, a pre-hearing \nmemorandum from the Chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business highlighted that women-\nowned businesses have “struggled to receive pandemic relief from the Federal government.”  July 15, \n2020 Memo. at 5; see also id. (noting that “one-in-four (23%) women-owned businesses were shut out \nof the PPP loan application process” and that of women who were able to apply for a PPP loan, \n“women asked for 40 percent less than the average small business owner”). \nMoreover, Plaintiffs offer no argument that a priority period for women-owned businesses is \nnot “substantially related to the achievement of [that] objective[].”  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  Nor can \nthey, because prioritizing women-owned businesses is indisputably related to the goal of assisting \nthose underserved businesses with their pandemic recovery.   \nII.  Because the RRF Priority Periods Are Constitutional, Plaintiffs Will Not Suffer \nIrreparable Injury. \nPlaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claim because Section 5003 is \nconstitutional and Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are not impaired in the absence of an injunction; \n22 \n\ntherefore, there is no presumption of irreparable injury.  Cf. Obama for Am., 697 F.3d at 436 (“When \nconstitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable injury is presumed.”).    \nBy the same token, Plaintiffs cannot be injured by not receiving funds to which they are not \nentitled.  Because the priority period is constitutional, Plaintiffs are not injured in the event that they \nare unable to receive RRF funds because of the existence of the priority period for economically and \nsocially disadvantaged small businesses.  Moreover, Plaintiff Vitolo is not injured because he has not \nestablished or even alleged that he is socially disadvantaged, and thus would not be entitled to receive \nfunds during the priority period even if the race-based presumption were eliminated.   \nIII.  The Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest Weigh Against the Requested \nInjunction.  \nBecause Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim, an \ninjunction will not prevent a violation of their constitutional rights.  Although the Sixth Circuit has \nheld that “[i]t is always in the public interest to prevent violation of a party’s constitutional rights,” \nDeja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., Tenn., 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. \n2001), that does not mean that any plaintiff alleging a constitutional violation is entitled to a temporary \nrestraining order.   \nMoreover, the public interest would be harmed by the requested TRO, which would delay the \ndisbursement of much-needed funds to struggling restaurants at a critical moment in the COVID-19 \nrecovery.  The House Report on ARPA, issued nearly three months ago, explained that “[a]lmost \neleven months after shutdown orders and social distancing guidelines were implemented across our \ncountry, small businesses are still struggling to stay open, retain workers, and remain viable.”  H.R. \nRep. No. 117-7, at 457 (2021).  Critically, the report stated that in the wake of “full or partial \nshutdowns,” “many restaurants may not survive.”  Id. at 457.  The report cited a study by the New \nYork Restaurant Association which reported that “54 percent of all New York restaurateurs are in \ndanger of closing permanently if another federal relief package is not passed.”  Id.  Delaying this much-\nneeded aid could further threaten the viability of restaurants who are desperately counting on the RRF \nto stay afloat at this critical time.  \n23 \n\nCONCLUSION  \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order should be \ndenied.     \n   \nDated: May 17, 2021  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  BRIAN M.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE \n______________________________________________________________________________ \nJAKE’S BAR AND GRILL, LLC, and \nANTONIO VITOLO, \n                 \n    Plaintiffs,    \n  v.              \n       \nISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN,  \n \n  Defendant. \n______________________________________________________________________________ \nCOMPLAINT \n______________________________________________________________________________ \nPlaintiffs allege their complaint against Defendant as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  “The Constitution created a government dedicated to equal justice under \nlaw.” Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 19 (1958). The government may not frustrate this \nprinciple of equality by making “distinctions between individuals based solely on \ndifferences  that  are  irrelevant  to  a  legitimate  governmental  objective.”  Lehr  v. \nRobertson, 463 U.S. 248, 265 (1983). Whether it be discrimination based on race or \ngender, “unreasonable discrimination” by the government is never permitted. Bolling \nv. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954).  \n2.  In March 2021, the United States pushed aside equality under the law \nby enacting a grant program that gives special treatment based on race and gender. \nUnder Section 5003 of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), Congress appropriated \n$28.6 billion to create the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, to be administered by \n1 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 1 of 11   PageID #: 1\n\nDefendant, who runs the Small Business Administration (SBA). This fund provides \nrelief for restaurants impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the terms of the \nlaw, however, Defendant must administer the fund in a discriminatory manner. For \nthe first 21 days, which started May 3, 2021, Defendant is obligated to “prioritize \nawarding grants” to restaurants owned by certain minorities and women.  \n3.  To implement this discriminatory mandate, Defendant adopted a first-\ncome, first-serve queue to process grant requests until the money runs out, but has \nthen re-sorted applicants within the queue based on their race and gender, putting \nwhite  male  restaurant  owners  behind  certain  minority  or  female  applicants, \nregardless of when they filed an application. Given the limited pot of funds, this puts \nwhite male applicants at significant risk that, by the time their applications are \nprocessed, the money will be gone. Every day that goes by increases this risk, as \nDefendant pays out grants to minority and female applicants but holds requests from \nwhite male applicants.  \n4.  Antonio  Vitolo  is  a  white  male  who  owns  Jake’s  Bar  and  Grill  in \nHarriman, Roane County, Tennessee. Although his wife is Hispanic and owns 50% of \nthe restaurant, Jake’s Bar and Grill is not eligible for priority treatment because \nVitolo is a white male. Vitolo applied for a grant on the first day the application \nopened, but because of his race and gender, Defendant will not process his application \nuntil after applications from certain minority and female owners received during the \nfirst 21 days of the administration of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.  \n2 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 2 of 11   PageID #: 2\n\n5.  Defendant has no justification for granting these priorities based on race \nand gender. Therefore, the program is unconstitutional and should be enjoined. \nMoreover,  because  this program  involves a  limited  pot  of  funds that  is quickly \nrunning out, this Court should immediately enjoin Defendant from paying out any \nclaims until she stops discriminating on the basis of race and gender.  \nTHE PARTIES \n6.  Jake’s Bar and Grill, LLC, is a Tennessee limited liability company, with \nits principal place of business in Harriman, Roane County, Tennessee.  \n7.  Antonio Vitolo is a white male who owns Jake’s Bar and Grill, LLC. His \nwife is Hispanic and, by operation of state law, she owns 50% of the business. Vitolo \napplied for a grant from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund on May 3, 2021; however, \nVitolo’s application has been put on hold because he is a white male. Other restaurant \nowners’ applications, however, have been and are being processed because they are \nnot white males.  \n8.  Defendant  Isabella  Casillas  Guzman  is  the  Administrator  of  SBA. \nUnder Section 5003 of ARPA, Defendant Guzman is responsible for administering \nthe  Restaurant  Revitalization  Fund.  She  is  sued  in  her  official  capacity  for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n§ 2201, and 5 U.S.C. § 702, because this case presents a substantial question of federal \nlaw, specifically whether Section 5003 of ARPA—and Defendant’s implementation of \n3 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 3 of 11   PageID #: 3\n\nthat section—violates the United States Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection \nof the laws.  \n10.  This Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order \ninjunctive relief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202. \n11.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). A \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district and a \nsubstantial part of the property subject to this action is situated in this district. \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIM \n12.  On March 11, 2021, the President of the United States signed ARPA into \nlaw. \n13.  Through Section 5003 of ARPA, Congress appropriated $28.6 billion for \nthe Restaurant Revitalization Fund to be administered by Defendant who is the \nAdministrator of SBA. ARPA provides that the “Administer shall use amounts in the \nFund  to  make  grants”  to  restaurants  that  require  grant  support  due  to  “the \nuncertainty of current economic conditions.” \n14.  Section 5003(c)(3) of ARPA provides a priority to certain applicants: \n“During the initial 21-day period in which the Administrator awards grants under \nthis subsection, the Administrator shall prioritize awarding grants to eligible entities \nthat are small business concerns owned and controlled by women, [veterans], or \nsocially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns.”  \n4 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 4 of 11   PageID #: 4\n\n15.  ARPA incorporates another federal law called the Small Business Act, \nwhich provides that “[s]ocially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a \nmember  of  a  group  without  regard  to  their  individual  qualities.”  15  U.S.C. \n§ 637(a)(4)(A).  \n16.  SBA regulations further define “socially disadvantaged individuals” and \n“economically disadvantaged individuals” as those individuals who belong to certain \nracial groups. 13 C.F.R. §§ 124.103, .104. To fit into these groups, individuals must \nbe a member of one of the following groups: “Black Americans; Hispanic Americans; \nNative Americans (including Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians); Asian Pacific \nAmericans; or Subcontinent Asian Americans.” \n17.  Vitolo is not a member of any of the racial or ethnic groups identified in \n13  C.F.R.  §  124.103  or  any  other  group  identified  by  Defendant  as  “socially \ndisadvantaged” or “economically disadvantaged.” \n18.  Vitolo and Jake’s Bar and Grill, LLC are eligible for a grant under the \nRestaurant Revitalization Fund, except they are not eligible for priority consideration \nbecause Antonio Vitolo is a white male.  \n19.  On April 30, 2021, SBA sent an email to restaurants detailing the \nprocess for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. The email included the following \ninformation: “All businesses can and should apply on Monday. Due to limited funds \nand  the  first-come,  first-served  basis,  the  earliest  possible  submission  of  your \napplication is the best way to maximize your chance of receiving the grant. The law \n5 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 5 of 11   PageID #: 5\n\nmandates a 21-day priority window for businesses owned and controlled by women, \nveterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The SBA has \nindicated it will fund those applications first, as required.” \n20.  On  May  3,  2021,  Vitolo  applied  for  a  grant  under  the  Restaurant \nRevitalization  Fund  at  restaurant.sba.gov.  During  the  application  process,  SBA \nnotified Vitolo that “SBA will accept applications from all eligible applicants, but only \nprocess and fund priority group applications.” The website continued that priority \napplicants  include  businesses  owned  by  “women,  veterans,  or  socially  and \neconomically  disadvantaged  individuals.”  SBA’s  website  further  explains  that \n“socially disadvantaged individuals” and “economically disadvantaged individuals” \nmust be “a member of a group” that has “been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice \nor cultural bias.”  \n21.  Vitolo applied for the grant and chose “white” as his race and “male” as \nhis gender, which means his application is pushed to the back of the queue behind \ncertain minority applicants and women. \n22.  Vitolo would be “economically disadvantaged” were it not for the racial \nclassification in that definition.  \n23.  On May 4, 2021, SBA sent Vitolo an email explaining that because he is \na white male, he will not have the same privileges as other non-white and female \nrestaurant owners: “As outlined by Congress, the SBA will focus their reviews on the \npriority applications that have been submitted. Applicants who have submitted a \nnon-priority application will find their applications remain in a Review status while \n6 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 6 of 11   PageID #: 6\n\nthe priority applications are processed during the first 21 days. Applicants in this \nstatus should not anticipate any outreach from the SBA during this period.” \n24.  On May 7, 2021, SBA sent Vitolo an email stating that the SBA received \n186,200 applications in the first two days. The email goes on to explain that 46,400 \napplications  were  from  women  and  30,800  applications  were  from  minority \nrestaurant owners.  \n25.  Plaintiffs are harmed in multiple ways. First, they have been pushed to \nthe back of the line, regardless of when they applied, for a limited fund that may run \nout before their application is processed. Second, even if the fund does not run out, \nPlaintiffs are harmed by being treated differently because of their race and gender \nduring the application process for a grant under the Restaurant Revitalization Fund \nprogram. \n26.  Unless Defendant is immediately enjoined, Plaintiffs may never be able \nto recover from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund program if the funds run out \nbefore the application is processed.  \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nEQUAL PROTECTION VIOLATION \n \n27.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n28.  The Constitution forbids “discrimination by the general government . . .  \nagainst any citizen because of his race.” Gibson v. State of Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, \n591 (1896).  \n7 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 7 of 11   PageID #: 7\n\n29.  Gender  discrimination  is  also  unconstitutional.  Courts  “carefully \ninspect[ ] official action that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or to men).” \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532 (1996).  \n30.  “The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause \ncontains within it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection \nof the laws.” United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013). \n31.  “[A]ll racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by \na reviewing court under strict scrutiny.” Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 505 \n(2005) (citation omitted). “Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of \nproving  that  racial  classifications  are  narrowly  tailored  measures  that  further \ncompelling governmental interests.” Id. (citation omitted). \n32.  When gender discrimination is employed, the burden “rests entirely” on \nthe government to offer an “exceedingly persuasive” justification and to prove that \n“the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of \nthose objectives.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 532 (citations omitted). \n33.  Section  5003  of  ARPA  imposes  racial  classifications  and  grants  a \nbenefit—priority consideration—based on those racial classifications.  \n34.  Section 5003 of ARPA likewise uses gender discrimination as a method \nof distributing funds through a gender-based priority consideration. \n35.  Defendant is responsible for interpreting and implementing Section \n5003 of ARPA. \n8 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 8 of 11   PageID #: 8\n\n36.  Although  Plaintiffs  suffered  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  are \notherwise eligible for a grant under the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, Plaintiffs \nare ineligible for priority consideration and instead are pushed to the back of the line, \nbecause Vitolo is a white male. \n37.  Plaintiffs applied for a grant under Section 5003 of ARPA and were \ndenied priority consideration because Vitolo is a white male. \n38.  The  racial  classifications  under  Section  5003  of  ARPA  are \nunconstitutional  because  they  violate  the  Equal  Protection  and  Due  Process \nguarantees in the United States Constitution. These racial classifications under \nSection 5003 of ARPA are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government \ninterest.  \n39.  The  gender-based  classification  under  Section  5003  of  ARPA  is \nunconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection and Due Process guarantees \nin the United States Constitution. This gender-based classification is not supported \nby an exceedingly persuasive objective, and the discriminatory means employed are \nnot substantially related to the achievement of any such objective. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n  Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.  Immediately enter a temporary restraining order prohibiting Defendant \nfrom  paying  out  any  grants  from  the  Restaurant  Revitalization  Fund,  unless \nDefendant begins processing applications and paying grants in the order that the \napplications were received, without regard to the race or gender of the applicant.  \n9 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 9 of 11   PageID #: 9\n\nB.  Enter  a  temporary  injunction  requiring  Defendant  to  process \napplications and pay grants, including Plaintiffs’ application, in the order that they \nwere received, regardless of the applicant’s race or gender.  \nC.   Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  race-  and  gender-based \nclassifications under Section 5003 of ARPA are unconstitutional.   \nD.  Enter an order permanently enjoining Defendant from applying race- \nand  gender-based  classifications  when  determining  eligibility  or  priority \nconsideration for grants under Section 5003 of ARPA.  \n  E.  Grant Plaintiffs such other and further relief as the court deems \nappropriate. \n \n \n   \n10 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 1   Filed 05/12/21   Page 10 of 11   PageID #: 10\n\nDated: May 11, 2021      WISCONSIN INSTITUTE FOR LAW & LIBERTY \nRick Esenberg (pro hac vice pending) \nrick@will-law.org \n/s/ Daniel P.

For the following reasons, the Court DENIES \nPlaintiffs’ motion.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The COVID-19 Pandemic and Early Federal Relief Efforts \nIn February and March 2020, portions of the United States economy ground to a halt as \nan emergent coronavirus began to cause severe sickness and death on a wide scale, especially \namong older individuals and those with preexisting conditions.  Many state and local \ngovernments issued stay-at-home orders, directed restaurants and other customer-facing \nbusinesses to shut down, and severely restricted social gatherings to slow the person-to-person \nspread of the virus.  The sudden and severe drop in consumer economic activity reverberated \nthrough the economy, harming many consumer-facing businesses and permanently shuttering \nsome.  Real gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2020 dropped a staggering 31.4%, \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 1 of 30   PageID #: 185\n\nby far the most severe quarterly contraction ever recorded.  Table 1.1.1 Percent Change from \nPreceding Period in Real Gross Domestic Product, U.S. BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (last \nrevised Apr. 29, 2021), available at https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm.   \nFaced with twin public-health and economic crises, Congress reacted with extraordinary \nstimulus spending aimed at both controlling the virus and containing its economic fallout.  On \nMarch 27, 2020, § 1102 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES \nAct”) created the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a $349 billion federally guaranteed loan \nprogram for businesses distressed by the pandemic.  Pub. L. No. 116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (2020).  \nAlthough federal funds guaranteed the PPP loans, they were administered by commercial \nlenders.  Id.  On April 24, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement \nAct appropriated an additional $310 billion to the fund.  Pub. L. No. 116-139, 134 Stat. 620 \n(2020).   \nThe PPP loans were not administered equally to all kinds of businesses, however.  \nCongressional investigation revealed that minority-owned and women-owned businesses had \nmore difficulty accessing PPP funds relative to other kinds of business.  See, e.g., Supporting \nSmall and Minority-Owned Businesses Through the Pandemic, at 60–62 (Feb. 4, 2021) \n(footnotes and emphases removed), available at https://www.congress.gov/117/chrg/CHRG-\n117hhrg43965/CHRG-117hhrg43965.pdf (analysis noting that black-owned businesses were \nmore likely to be denied PPP loans than white-owned businesses with similar application profiles \ndue to outright lending discrimination, and that funds were more quickly disbursed to businesses \nin predominantly white neighborhoods).  This was due in significant part to the lack of historical \nrelationships between commercial lenders and minority-owned and women-owned businesses.  \nSee, e.g., Long-Lasting Solutions for a Small Business Recovery: Hearing Before the Committee \n  2 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 2 of 30   PageID #: 186\n\non Small Business, at 72 (July 15, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.congress.gov/116/chrg/CHRG-116hhrg41297/CHRG-116hhrg41297.pdf (written \ntestimony of Dr. Lisa Cook, an economist, explaining that minority-owned businesses had \ngreater difficulty accessing PPP credit due to the PPP’s “heavy reliance on large banks, with \nwhom [minority-owned businesses] have had historically poor relationships”).  The historical \nlack of access to credit also meant that minority-owned and women-owned businesses tended to \nbe in more financially precarious situations entering the pandemic, rendering them less able to \nweather an extended economic contraction of the sort COVID-19 unleashed.  Id. at 9–10 (Dr. \nCook explaining that prior to the pandemic, “27 percent of small White firms report[ed] that they \nwere at risk or in distress” while “49 percent of small Hispanic firms and 57 percent of small \nBlack firms reported being at risk or distressed”).   \nB.  The Restaurant Revitalization Fund \nAgainst this backdrop, on March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue \nPlan Act of 2021 (the “ARPA”).  H.R. 1319, 117th Cong. (2021).  As part of the ARPA, \nCongress appropriated $28,600,000,000 to a “Restaurant Revitalization Fund” and tasked the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration with disbursing funds to restaurants and \nother eligible entities that suffered COVID-19 pandemic-related revenue losses.  See id. § 5003.  \nUnder the ARPA, the Administrator “shall award grants to eligible entities in the order in which \napplications are received by the Administrator,” except that  \n[d]uring the initial 21-day period in which the Administrator awards grants . . . , \nthe Administrator shall prioritize awarding grants to eligible entities that are small \nbusiness concerns owned and controlled by women (as defined in section 3(n) of \nthe Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(n))), small business concerns owned and \ncontrolled by veterans (as defined in section 3(q) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q))), \nor socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined \nin section 8(a)(4)(A) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A))).   \nId. § 5003(c)(1), (3).   \n  3 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 3 of 30   PageID #: 187\n\nTitle 15, United States Code, Section 632(n) provides that a small business concern is \n“owned and controlled by women” if:   \n(1) at least 51 percent of small business concern is owned by one or more women, \nor in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of the stock of \nwhich is owned by one or more women; and (2) the management and daily \nbusiness operations of the business are controlled by one or more women.   \nSimilarly, 15 U.S.C. § 637(a)(4)(A) provides: \nthe term “socially and economically disadvantaged small business concern” \nmeans any small business concern which meets the requirements of subparagraph \n(B) and-- \n(i) which is at least 51 per centum unconditionally owned by-- \n(I) one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, \n(II) an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned \nbusiness entity of such tribe), or \n(III) an economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian organization, \nor \n(ii) in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 per centum of \nthe stock of which is unconditionally owned by-- \n(I) one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, \n(II) an economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned \nbusiness entity of such tribe), or \n(III) an economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian organization. \n15 U.S.C § 637(a)(5) defines “socially disadvantaged individuals” as individuals “who have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a \ngroup without regard to their individual qualities.”  Federal regulations promulgated by the Small \nBusiness Administration further state that there is a rebuttable presumption that the following \nindividuals are socially disadvantaged:   \nBlack Americans; Hispanic Americans; Native Americans (Alaska Natives, \nNative Hawaiians, or enrolled members of a Federally or State recognized Indian \nTribe); Asian Pacific Americans (persons with origins from Burma, Thailand, \n  4 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 4 of 30   PageID #: 188\n\nMalaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Japan, China (including Hong Kong), \nTaiwan, Laos, Cambodia (Kampuchea), Vietnam, Korea, The Philippines, U.S. \nTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Republic of Palau), Republic of the \nMarshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands, Guam, Samoa, Macao, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu, or \nNauru); Subcontinent Asian Americans (persons with origins from India, \nPakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives Islands or Nepal); and \nmembers of other groups designated from time to time by SBA according to \nprocedures set forth at paragraph (d) of this section. \n13 C.F.R. § 124.103.  Thus, while the SBA has created a regulatory presumption that certain \nindividuals are socially disadvantaged, nothing precludes other individuals who “have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a \ngroup without regard to their individual qualities” from being defined as socially disadvantaged.   \n“[E]conomically disadvantaged individuals” are defined as “those socially disadvantaged \nindividuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to \ndiminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who \nare not socially disadvantaged.”  15 U.S.C. § 637(a)(6)(A).  “In determining diminished capital \nand credit opportunities, [the Small Business Administration] will examine factors relating to the \npersonal financial condition of any individual claiming disadvantaged status, including income \nfor the past three years . . . personal net worth, and the fair market value of all assets, whether \nencumbered or not.”  13 C.F.R. § 124.04(c).       \nOn April 27, 2021, the Small Business Administration announced that it would open the \napplication period for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund on May 3, 2021.  (Doc. 12-3, at 2, 6–\n9.)   The Small Business Administration announcement also stated, consistent with the ARPA, \nthat “[f]or the first 21 days that the program is open, the SBA will prioritize funding applications \nfrom businesses owned and controlled by women, veterans, and socially and economically \ndisadvantaged individuals.”  (Id.)   \n  5 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 5 of 30   PageID #: 189\n\nC.  Antonio Vitolo and Jake’s Bar and Grill \nAntonio Vitolo is a white male who owns and operates Jake’s Bar and Grill, LLC in \nHarriman, Tennessee.  (Doc. 12-3, at 1.)  Beginning in March 2020, the effects of the COVID-19 \npandemic caused Vitolo to close his restaurant on weekdays and only offer to-go orders on \nweekends.  (Id.)  As a result, sales declined significantly during the pandemic, with gross \nreceipts in 2020 $104,590.20 less than gross receipts in 2019.  (Id. at 2.)   \nVitolo applied for a grant from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund through the Small \nBusiness Administration on May 3, 2021, the first day of the application period.  (Id.)  According \nto Vitolo, the application included a section entitled “Priority in Awarding Restaurant \nRevitalization Funds” and included instructions for priority applications.  (Id. at 2, 10.)  Vitolo’s \napplication also asked him to identify his race and gender, and he selected “white” and “male.”  \n(Id. at 3, 12.)  The application also allowed applicants to self-certify that the business concern at \nissue is at least 51% owned by individuals who are “socially and economically disadvantaged,” \nalthough Vitolo did not so certify.1  (Id. at 10.)  After completing his application, the Small \nBusiness Administration notified him that his application was “under review” and that his \n“calculated award amount” was $104,590.20.  (Id. at 3, 13.)  The next day, the Small Business \nAdministration emailed Vitolo and notified him that “[a]pplicants who have submitted a non-\npriority application will find their application remain in a Review status while priority \napplications are processed during the first 21 days.”  (Id. at 3, 14–15.)  On May 7, 2021, the \nSmall Business Administration again emailed Vitolo and noted that in the first two days of the \n \n1 At the TRO hearing, Vitolo’s counsel indicated that he does not have any basis for asserting \nthat he is socially and economically disadvantaged, with or without the SBA’s race-based, \nrebuttable presumption.  Accordingly, even if the regulatory presumption were removed, Vitolo \napparently has no argument that he is entitled to priority consideration under the plain text of \n§ 5003 of the ARPA.   \n  6 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 6 of 30   PageID #: 190\n\napplication window, it received:  (1) 186,200 applications from restaurants, bars, and other \neligible businesses; (2) 97,600 applications from restaurants, bars, and other eligible businesses \ncontrolled by women, veterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; and \n(3) 61,700 applications from businesses with under $500,000 in annual pre-pandemic revenue.  \n(Id. at 3, 30–31.)   \nOn May 12, 2021, Vitolo and Jake’s Bar and Grill, LLC initiated the present action \nagainst Defendant Isabella Casillas Guzman, the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration.  (Doc. 1.)  In their complaint, Vitolo and Jake’s Bar and Grill assert that the \nARPA’s twenty-one-day priority period violates the United States Constitution’s equal \nprotection clause and due process clause because it impermissibly grants benefits and priority \nconsideration based on race and gender classifications.  (Id. at 8–9.)  Based on allegations in the \ncomplaint and averments made in Vitolo’s sworn declaration dated May 11, 2021, Vitolo and \nJake’s Bar and Grill request that the Court enter:  (1) a temporary restraining order prohibiting \nthe Small Business Administration from paying out grants from the Restaurant Revitalization \nFund, unless it processes applications in the order they were received without regard to the race \nor gender of the applicant; (2) a temporary injunction requiring the Small Business \nAdministration to process applications and pay grants in the order received regardless of race or \ngender; (3) a declaratory judgment that race- and gender-based classifications under § 5003 of \nthe ARPA are unconstitutional; and (4) an order permanently enjoining the Small Business \nAdministration from applying race- and gender-based classifications in determining eligibility \nand priority for grants under § 5003 of the ARPA.  (Id. at 9–10.)   \nII.  STANDARD OF LAW \n  7 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 7 of 30   PageID #: 191\n\nThe purpose of a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) is to preserve and maintain the \nstatus quo for a very short period of time “so that a reasoned resolution of a dispute may be had.”  \nProctor & Gamble Co. v. Bankers Trust Co., 78 F.3d 219, 226 (6th Cir. 1996).  The Court may \nonly issue a TRO without written or oral notice to the adverse party or his attorney where the \nparty seeking the TRO demonstrates it has fulfilled the following requirements:  \n(a) specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that \nimmediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before \nthe adverse party can be heard in opposition; and  \n(b) the movant’s attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and \nthe reasons why it should not be required.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(b).  The court must also require the movant to give “security in an amount that \nthe court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have \nbeen wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).   \n  When reviewing motions for TROs, courts must consider the following: (1) the movant’s \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant will suffer irreparable injury without \nan injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) \nwhether the public interest would be served by granting the injunction.   McNeilly v. Land, 684 \nF.3d 611, 615 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Am. Imaging Servs., Inc. v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 963 \nF.2d 855, 858 (6th Cir. 1992)); Midwest Retailer Associated, Ltd. v. City of Toledo, 563 F. Supp. \n2d 796, 802 (N.D. Ohio 2008) (“The same standard generally applies to the issuance of \ntemporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.”).   In the constitutional context, the \nlast three factors often hinge on the first.  Cf. Liberty Coins, LLC v. Goodman, 748 F.3d 682, 690 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (“In cases implicating the First Amendment, the other three factors often hinge \non this first factor.”).  These considerations are factors to be balanced; they are not prerequisites \nthat must each be satisfied before relief may issue.  Eagle-Picher, 963 F.2d at 859.  Nor are they \n  8 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 8 of 30   PageID #: 192\n\n“rigid and unbending requirements”; rather, “[t]hese factors simply guide the discretion of the \ncourt.”  Id.  The party seeking injunctive relief bears the burden of justifying such relief.  Id.   \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \ni.  Equal Protection Under the Law \nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person may be \n“deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  “The liberty protected by the \nFifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains within it the prohibition against denying to any \nperson the equal protection of the laws.”  United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013); \nsee also Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954); Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform v. Napolitano, \n648 F.3d 365, 379 (6th Cir. 2011) (“The Fifth Amendment, of course, does not itself contain a \nguarantee of equal protection, but instead incorporates, as against the federal government, the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”).  Courts therefore “evaluate equal \nprotection claims against the federal government under the Fifth Amendment just as [they] \nwould evaluate equal protection claims against state and local governments under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.”  Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform, 648 F.3d at 379; see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1, 93 (1976) (“Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.”); U.S. Const. amend. XIV (“No State shall . . . deny to any person \nwithin its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws.”).  Equal protection prevents the government \nfrom “making distinctions that (1) burden a fundamental right; (2) target a suspect class; or (3) \nintentionally treat one individual differently from others similarly situated without any rational \nbasis.”  Johnson v. Bredesen, 624 F.3d 742, 746 (6th Cir. 2010).   \n  9 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 9 of 30   PageID #: 193\n\nThe level of scrutiny a government-sponsored distinction receives depends on the nature \nof the distinction.  Certain classifications are subject to strict scrutiny—meaning they are \nconstitutional “only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental \ninterests.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995).  Other classifications \nare subject to intermediate scrutiny, which requires that the challenged action further an \nimportant government interest by means substantially related to that interest.  See Craig v. \nBoren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976).  Classifications that are not subject to a higher level of scrutiny \nreceive rational-basis review, which is satisfied if the government’s actions are rationally related \nto a legitimate government interest.  F.C.C. v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993) \n(“In areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds along \nsuspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal \nprotection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a \nrational basis for the classification.”).  In light of these varying standards, the Court will address \nPlaintiffs’ likelihood of success with respect to the race- and gender-based distinctions in the \nSBA program separately. \nii.  Historical Treatment of Race-Based Affirmative-Action Measures \nIn 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Regents of University of California v. Bakke, \n438 U.S. 265 (1978).  Bakke was brought by a white male after the Medical School of the \nUniversity of California at Davis twice denied him admission.  438 U.S. at 269–76.  The Medical \nSchool had two separate admissions programs—a general-admissions program and a special-\nadmissions program designed to increase minority representation among the admitted students.  \nId.  The plaintiff, who was only considered for admission through the general-admissions \n  10 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 10 of 30   PageID #: 194\n\nprogram, challenged the legality of the special-admissions program under § 601 of Title VI of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.  See id at 277–78.  Section 601 provides: \nNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance. \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d.2  A plurality of justices determined that the special-admission program was \nunlawful, either under Title VI or the Equal Protection Clause, but no specific standard of review \nobtained majority support.  See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 290–91 (advocating for the application of \nstrict scrutiny to racial classifications); id. at 369 (Brennan, J. concurring in the judgment and \ndissenting in part) (advocating for the application of intermediate scrutiny); id. at 408–09 \n(Stevens, J. concurring in part) (declining to reach the constitutional issue).   \n  Shortly after Bakke, the Supreme Court decided Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 \n(1980).  Fullilove examined the constitutionality of the “minority business enterprise” (or \n“MBE”) provision of the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, which required that at least ten \npercent of grants for goods and services related to local public-works projects be awarded to \nminority-owned businesses.  448 U.S. at 453–54.  Six justices held that the MBE provision was \nconstitutional.  Id. at 491–92.  The plurality opinion concluded that “[a]ny preference based on \nracial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to make sure that \nit does not conflict with constitutional guarantees,” but adopted no particular level of scrutiny.  \nId. (“This opinion does not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas articulated in such \n \n2 Five justices concluded that this provision “must be held to proscribe only those racial \nclassifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Fifth Amendment.”  Bakke, \n438 U.S. at 287.  Of these, Justice Powell, who delivered the opinion of the Court, determined \nthat the program violated the Equal Protection Clause, while the other four justices would have \nupheld the program.  The remaining four justices concluded that the program violated Title VI \nwithout reaching the equal-protection issue.   \n  11 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 11 of 30   PageID #: 195\n\ncases as [Bakke]” but “our analysis demonstrates that the MBE opinion would survive judicial \nreview under either ‘test’ articulated in the several Bakke opinions.”).   \n  In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267 (1986), a four-justice plurality \napplied strict scrutiny to a school district’s layoff system that limited the number of minority \nteachers that could be laid off in connection with the percentage of minority students attending \nthe school.  476 U.S. at 270–74.  The plurality rejected the argument that “remedy[ing] societal \ndiscrimination by providing ‘role models’ for minority schoolchildren” was a compelling interest \nsupporting the policy, holding that the policy “allow[ed] the Board to engage in discriminatory \nhiring and layoff practices long past the point required by any legitimate remedial purpose.”  Id. \nat 275–76.   \n  In 1989, a majority of justices agreed with Wygant that race-based classifications by state \nand local governments are subject to strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See City \nof Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493–94 (1989).  In Croson, the Supreme Court \nreviewed a “Minority Business Utilization Plan” adopted by the Richmond City Council, which \n“required prime contractors to whom the city awarded construction contracts to subcontract at \nleast 30% of the dollar amount of the contract” to minority-owned businesses.  488 U.S. at 477–\n78.  A majority of justices declared the program unconstitutional, holding that generalized past \nsocietal discrimination, absent specific “identified discrimination,” is not a compelling interest to \nsupport state-sponsored racial preferences.  Id. at 505–06.  The majority also concluded that the \nthirty-percent quota was not narrowly tailored to its purported remedial purpose.  Id. at 507 \n(“[T]he 30% quota cannot be said to be narrowly tailored to any goal, except perhaps outright \nracial balancing.”).     \n  12 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 12 of 30   PageID #: 196\n\n  Following Croson, a four-justice plurality applied intermediate scrutiny to Federal \nCommunications Commission policies aimed at increasing broadcasting diversity, holding that: \nbenign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress—even if those measures \nare not “remedial” in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past \ngovernmental or societal discrimination—are constitutionally permissible to the \nextent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of \nCongress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives. \nMetro Broad., Inc. v. F.C.C., 497 U.S. 547, 564–65 (1990).   \nHowever, not long thereafter, Metro Broadcasting was overruled by Adarand \nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena.  Adarand concerned a prime contract between a private contractor \nand the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Central Federal Lands Highway Divisions.  515 \nU.S. at 205.  The contract provided that the contractor would receive additional compensation if \nit hired subcontractors operated by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.”  Id.  \nThe Adarand plurality held that all racial classifications—state or federal, invidious or benign—\nare subject to strict scrutiny and remanded for further proceedings under that standard.  Id. at 224 \n(“[A]ny person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to \nthe Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under \nthe strictest judicial scrutiny.”).   \n  Cases since Adarand have not strayed from the strict-scrutiny standard of review.  \nInstead, affirmative-action cases—in the Supreme Court and in lower courts—have focused on \nascertaining which governmental interests are sufficiently compelling to support racial \nclassifications and whether the challenged measures are narrowly tailored to the interests they \nseek to promote.   \niii.  Whether the SBA’s Grant-Distribution Policy Is Likely to Withstand \nStrict Scrutiny \n  13 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 13 of 30   PageID #: 197\n\nAlthough § 5003 of the ARPA does not itself use a facially race-based prioritization \nsystem, the Small Business Administration’s regulations use race as a basis to establish a \npresumption that an applicant is socially and economically disadvantaged.   See 13 C.F.R. \n§ 124.103.  The parties agree that this system is subject to strict scrutiny.  See Adarand, 515 U.S. \nat 212–13.  Accordingly, whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their race-based \nequal-protection claims turns on whether Defendant has a compelling government interest in \nusing a race-based classification, and whether that classification is narrowly tailored to that \ninterest. \na.  Compelling Government Interest \nTo satisfy the compelling-interest prong, the government must both identify a compelling \ninterest and provide evidentiary support concerning the need for the proposed remedial action.  \nSee Croson, 488 U.S. at 498–504; see also Associated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabik, \n214 F.3d 730, 735 (6th Cir. 2000) (citing Croson for the proposition that the government must \nestablish either that it “discriminated in the past” or “was a passive participant in private \nindustry’s discriminatory practices”).  Though the burden remains on the challenger to ultimately \ndemonstrate the unconstitutionality the program, without evidence that the remedial action is \nwarranted, it is immensely difficult for reviewing courts to determine whether the program is \njustified.  Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277–78. \nHere, the Government asserts that it has a compelling interest in “remedying the effect of \npast or present racial discrimination” as related to the formation and stability of minority-owned \nbusinesses.  (Doc. 18, at 10.)  Indeed, over the past year, Congress has gathered myriad evidence \nsuggesting that small businesses owned by minorities (including restaurants, which have a \ndisproportionately high rate of minority ownership) have suffered more severely than other kinds \n  14 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 14 of 30   PageID #: 198\n\nof businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the Government’s early attempts at \ngeneral economic stimulus—i.e., the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”)—disproportionately \nfailed to help those businesses directly because of historical discrimination patterns.  For \nexample, one congressional committee received the following testimony: \nSince the start of the crisis, business owners of color had been especially and \nunfairly hard hit. Active black- and Latino-owned businesses have declined by 41 \npercent and 32 percent respectively.  Asian American-owned business owners \ndropped by 26 percent.  By comparison, active white business owners declined by \n17 percent. These business owners of color are from the same communities that \nwere the most adversely affected by the Great Recession, and unfortunately, they \nare the ones most likely to have been underserved by the PPP. \nThis program disadvantages the smallest businesses. Businesses owned by people \nof color on average have fewer employees than white-owned businesses. [The \nCenter for Responsible Lending]’s analysis of the latest government study shows \nthat for 95 percent of black-owned businesses, and 91 percent of Latino-owned \nbusinesses, the owner is the only current employee as compared with 78 percent \nof white-owned businesses. These businesses are the least likely to be served by \nthe PPP. \nBusiness owners of color are less likely than white owners to have a relationship \nwith a commercial lender. This puts them at a sharp disadvantage, especially \nduring the first-come, first-served opening round of PPP, which caused serious \nfair lending concerns. \nBusinesses of color have historically lacked access to SBA loans and credit \ngenerally. A recent study found steep reductions in SBA 7(a) lending to black \nbusinesses between 2008 and 2016. In 2018 and 2019, only 5 percent of all SBA \n7(a) loans were made to black-owned businesses, and only 9 percent were made \nto Latino-owned businesses. \nPaycheck Protection Program: Loan Forgiveness & Other Challenges: Hearing Before the \nHouse Committee on Small Business, at 10–11 (June 17, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.congress.gov/116/chrg/CHRG-116hhrg41293/CHRG-116hhrg41293.pdf (testimony \nof Ashley Harrington); see also id. at 18 (“I think historically communities, individuals and \nbusiness owners of color have lacked access to credit through traditional means, even through \nthe SBA, which is a government guaranteed program.”); id. at 58 (Harrington testifying in \n  15 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 15 of 30   PageID #: 199\n\nwriting that commercial lenders administering the PPP prioritize lending to businesses with more \nemployees, while minority-owned businesses tend to have fewer employees, thereby \nsystematically directing PPP funds away from minority-owned businesses); id. at 74–92 \n(Harrington written statement explaining how the PPP disproportionately failed to assist \nminority-owned businesses).  Similarly, Dr. Lisa Cook, an economist from Michigan State \nUniversity, testified before the same committee during a different hearing: \nPrior to the pandemic, most small firms reported being in good shape and 73 \nreported that their financial health was good or stable. Nonetheless, the financial \nhealth of small firms varied greatly, depending on the race or ethnicity of the \nowner. Compared to 27 percent of small White firms reporting that they were at \nrisk or in distress, 49 percent of small Hispanic firms and 57 percent of small \nBlack firms reported being at risk or distressed. Black and Hispanic firms were \nless prepared to weather an adverse shock like this pandemic.  \n \nAccording to the Federal Reserve, distressed firms are three times more likely to \nclose relative to healthy firms due to a 2-month revenue shock. Further, the \nconcentration of small minority-owned firms in certain sectors makes them more \nvulnerable in the wake of COVID-19. These sectors in which many \nsmall minority-owned firms are overrepresented are accommodation and food \nservices, personal and laundry services, and retail.   \n. . .  \nThe burden of small business closures is also unevenly distributed. Forty-one \npercent of African American businesses reported being closed compared to 35 \npercent overall.   \nIn the only survey providing demographic data on PPP loan recipients, the Color \nof Change reports that 45 percent of Black and Latino businesses will close by the \nend of the year without more relief. Minority-owned businesses also report not \nbeing able to access PPP loans due to the heavy reliance on large banks, with \nwhom they have had historically poor relationships. \nLong-Lasting Solutions for a Small Business Recovery: Hearing Before the Committee on Small \nBusiness, at 9–10 (July 15, 2020), available at https://www.congress.gov/116/chrg/CHRG-\n116hhrg41297/CHRG-116hhrg41297.pdf; see also id. at 55–57 (academic study detailing higher \nloan denial rates, and concomitant lack of access to necessary credit, for minority- and woman-\n  16 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 16 of 30   PageID #: 200\n\nowned businesses); id. at 71 (written testimony of Dr. Lisa Cook explaining that before the \npandemic, 27% of white-owned businesses were financially “at risk” or “in distress,” compared \nto 49% of small Hispanic-owned firms and 57% of small black-owned firms, meaning that \nminority-owned firms were more exposed to an adverse economic shock, and were especially \nvulnerable to COVID-19 because they are “overrepresented [in] accommodation and food \nservices, personal and laundry services, and retail”); id. at 72 (written testimony of Dr. Lisa \nCook explaining that minority-owned businesses had greater difficulty accessing PPP credit due \nto the PPP’s “heavy reliance on large banks, with whom [minority-owned businesses] have had \nhistorically poor relationships”).  In a hearing before the Subcommittee on National Security, \nInternational Development and Monetary Policy of the House Committee on Financial Services, \na submission by analysts Sifan Liu and Joseph Parilla explained: \nThe near-term pressures from the COVID-19 recession have intersected with a \nsecond crisis that is longer-standing and equally damaging: the racial disparities \nin business ownership that undermine the nation 's economic dynamism and \nexacerbate wealth inequities. Below, we review three unique challenges that \nminority-owned small businesses currently face. \nThe first challenge is the continuous and long-standing structural racial disparities \nin small business ownership and performance. Nationally, people of color \nrepresent about 40% of the population, but only 20% of the nation’s 5.6 million \nbusiness owners with employees. Minority-owned small businesses also have \nfewer employees, lower profit margins, and higher failure rates. Importantly, \nthese trends represent structural impediments to starting and scaling businesses, \nand do not reflect the inherent entrepreneurial abilities or interests of different \ngroups. Several studies indicate that the playing field is uneven for entrepreneurs \nof color on key factors, including consumer perceptions, access to finance, and \nsocial capital. A Brookings analysis found that businesses located in majority-\nBlack neighborhoods receive lower Yelp ratings, and earn less revenue than \nbusinesses with similar quality ratings in other neighborhoods. The Federal \nReserve’s 2020 Small Business Credit Survey shows that large banks approve \naround 67% of loans sought by white small-business owners, 43% of those sought \nby Latino or Hispanic small-business owners, and just 29% of those sought by \nBlack small-business owners. Because the enduring impact of structural racism \ncompounds over generations, minority entrepreneurs also have less exposure to \nbusiness ownership within their families, and lower levels of family wealth to \ndraw from as startup capital or collateral. \n  17 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 17 of 30   PageID #: 201\n\n. . . \nThis second challenge is the acute economic disruptions induced by COVID-19 \nthat disproportionately affected minority-owned businesses. These long-standing \nstructural impediments have consequences on the financial health of minority-\nowned businesses, putting them in a more vulnerable position during economic \ndownturns. Minority-owned small businesses are more likely to operate in retail \nservices, accommodation and food services, and personal care services industries \nthat rely on foot traffic, which were hit hardest from a nationwide lockdown. In \naddition, COVID-19 infection rates are higher in communities of color, which \ncoincides with minority-owned business locations. Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork found that among the counties with highest share of Black-owned \nbusinesses, two-thirds were among the top 50 COVID-affected areas in July 2020. \n. . . \nThe third challenge is the delay and failure in getting federal small business relief \nto communities of color. While we do not have definitively reliable data on the \ndemographics of PPP loan recipients, a range of evidence strongly suggests that \naccess to PPP was not equal. A matched-pair test conducted in April found that \nBlack business owners in Washington, DC were more likely to be denied PPP \nloans compared to white business owners with similar application profiles due to \noutright lending discrimination. Brookings research shows that small businesses \nin majority-white neighborhoods received PPP loans much more quickly than \nsmall businesses in majority-Black and majority-Latino or Hispanic \nneighborhoods.  \n. . .  \nA new NBER report released last month indicates that the second tranche of PPP \nreached small businesses in underserved and majority-minority communities, but \nthese delays are likely costly to businesses in those communities that operate on \nvery short cash buffers.  \nSupporting Small and Minority-Owned Businesses Through the Pandemic, at 60–62 (Feb. \n4, 2021) (footnotes and emphases removed), available at \nhttps://www.congress.gov/117/chrg/CHRG-117hhrg43965/CHRG-117hhrg43965.pdf.  \nThese excerpts are nowhere near exhaustive but demonstrate the sort of evidence on \nwhich Congress based § 5003 of the ARPA.   \n  To the extent that Plaintiffs argue that evidence racial disparity or disparate \nimpact alone is not enough to support a compelling government interest, Congress also \n  18 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 18 of 30   PageID #: 202\n\nheard evidence that racial bias plays a direct role in these disparities.  For example, the \nprepared statement Everett K. Sands, which was presented at the February 4, 2021 \nhearing, stated: \nA study conducted and published in 2020 by the National Community \nReinvestment Coalition - part of a series of ‘matched pair mystery \nshopping’ studies of bias in small business lending conducted by NCRC since \n2017 - found racial bias by several Washington, D.C. banks in PPP lending, with \nwhite candidates receiving more favorable treatment than similarly-qualified \nBlack candidates in 43% of tests, as evidenced by differences in:   \n•  levels of encouragement in applying for a loan (including, in 44% of \ntests that exhibited bias, discouragement of the Black candidate from \napplying at all, alongside encouragement of the white candidate to \napply for more one or more loan products);   \n•  products offered;   \n•  information provided by the bank representative. \nId. at 54. \n  At this preliminary stage, the record before the Court supports a finding that the \nGovernment has a compelling interest in remediating past racial discrimination against minority-\nowned restaurants through § 5003 the ARPA and in ensuring public relief funds are not \nperpetuating the legacy of that discrimination.  At the very least, Congress had evidence before it \nsuggesting that its initial COVID-relief program, the PPP, disproportionately failed to reach \nminority-owned businesses due (at least in part) to historical lack of relationships between banks \nand minority-owned businesses, itself a symptom of historical lending discrimination.  Croson, \n488 U.S. at 492 (“It is beyond dispute that any public entity, state or federal, has a compelling \ninterest in assuring that public dollars drawn from the tax contributions of all citizens do not \nserve to finance the evil of private prejudice.”); cf. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater, 228 \nF.3d 1147, 1169 (10th Cir. 2000) (“The government’s evidence is particularly striking in the area \nof the race-based denial of access to capital, without which the formation of minority \n  19 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 19 of 30   PageID #: 203\n\nsubcontracting enterprises is stymied.”); DynaLantic Corp v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 885 F. Supp. 2d \n237, 258–262 (D.D.C. 2012) (rejecting facial challenge to the Small Business Administration’s \n§ 8(a) program in part because “the government [had] presented significant evidence on race-\nbased denial of access to capital and credit”).  Put another way, the PPP—a government-\nsponsored COVID-19 relief program—was stymied in reaching minority-owned businesses \nbecause historical patterns of discrimination are reflected in the present lack of relationships \nbetween minority-owned businesses and banks.  This same phenomenon caused minority-owned \nbusinesses to enter the pandemic with more financial precarity, and therefore to falter at \ndisproportionately higher rates as the pandemic has unfolded.  The Government has a compelling \ninterest in remediating the present effects of historical discrimination on these minority-owned \nbusinesses, especially to the extent that the PPP disproportionately failed those businesses \nbecause of factors clearly related to that history.  Plaintiff has not rebutted this initial showing of \na compelling interest, and therefore has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits in this \nrespect. \nb.  Narrow Tailoring \n“Even in the limited circumstance when drawing racial distinctions is permissible to \nfurther a compelling state interest, government is still ‘constrained in how it may pursue that end:  \n[T]he means chosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted purpose must be specifically and \nnarrowly framed to accomplish that purpose.’”  Grutter v. Bollinger, 529 U.S. 306, 333 (2003) \n(quoting Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 908 (1996)) (alterations in original).  This requirement is \naimed at ensuring “the means chosen ‘fit’ th[e] compelling goal so closely that there is little or \nno possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or \nstereotype.”  Id. (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at 493) (alteration in original).     \n  20 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 20 of 30   PageID #: 204\n\nSection 5003 of the ARPA is a one-time grant program with a finite amount of money \nthat prioritizes small restaurants owned by women and socially and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals because Congress had evidence before it showing that those businesses were \ninadequately protected by earlier COVID-19 financial relief programs.  While individuals from \ncertain racial minorities are rebuttably presumed to be “socially and economically \ndisadvantaged” for purposes of § 5003, Defendant correctly points out that the presumption does \nnot exclude individuals like Vitolo from being prioritized, and that the prioritization does not \nmean individuals like Vitolo cannot receive relief under this program.  Section 5003 is therefore \ntime-limited, fund-limited, not absolutely constrained by race during the priority period, and not \nconstrained to the priority period.3  And while Plaintiffs asserted during the TRO hearing that the \nSBA is using race as an absolute basis for identifying “socially and economically disadvantaged” \nindividuals, that assertion relies essentially on speculation rather than competent evidence about \nthe SBA’s processing system.  The Court therefore cannot conclude on the record before it that \nPlaintiffs are likely to show that Defendant’s implementation of § 5003 is not narrowly tailored \nto the compelling interest at hand.   \nIn support of Plaintiffs’ motion, they argue that the priority period is not narrowly \ntailored to achieving a compelling interest because it does not address “any alleged inequities or \npast discrimination.”  (Doc. 12-2, at 13–14.)  However, the Court has already addressed the \ninequities that were present in the past relief programs.  At the hearing, Plaintiffs argued that a \nbetter alternative would have been to prioritize applicants who did not receive PPP funds or \n \n3 Plaintiffs assert that funds may run out before the program even begins to process non-priority \napplications.  While this is certainly unfortunate, Congress cannot reasonably have been \nexpected to predict with precision the level of demand for funds nor how the demand would \nbreak down between priority and non-priority applications.   \n  21 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 21 of 30   PageID #: 205\n\napplicants who had “a weaker income statement” or “a weaker balance sheet.”  (Doc. 22, at 11–\n12.)  But “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral \nalternative,” only “serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives” to \npromote the stated interest.  Grutter v. Bollinger, 529 U.S. at 333 (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at \n507; Wygant, 476 U.S. at 280 n.6).  The Government received evidence that the race-neutral PPP \nwas tainted by lingering effects of past discrimination and current racial bias.  Accordingly, the \nrace-neutral approach that the Government found to be tainted did not further its compelling \ninterest in ensuring that public funds were not disbursed in a manner that perpetuated racial \ndiscrimination.  Indeed, the Government not only considered but actually used race-neutral \nalternatives during prior COVID-19 relief attempts.  It was precisely the failure of those race-\nneutral programs to reach all small businesses equitably that appears to have motivated the \npriority period at issue here.     \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that the priority period is simultaneously overinclusive and \nunderinclusive based on the racial, ethnic, and cultural groups that are presumed to be “socially \ndisadvantaged.”  (Doc. 12-2, at 14–15.)  However, the race-based presumption is just that:  a \npresumption.  Counsel for the Government explained at the hearing, consistent with other \nevidence before the Court, that any individual who felt they met § 5003’s broader definition of \n“socially and economically disadvantaged” was free to check that box on the application.  (Doc. \n22, at 24 (“[E]ssentially all that needs to be done is that you need to self-certify that you fit \nwithin that standard on the application, . . . you check that box”).)  For the sake of prioritization, \nthere is no distinction between those who were presumptively disadvantaged and those who self-\ncertified as such.  Accordingly, the priority period is not underinclusive in a way that defeats \nnarrow tailoring. \n  22 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 22 of 30   PageID #: 206\n\nFurther, the priority period is not overinclusive.  Prior to enacting the priority period, the \nGovernment considered evidence relative to minority-business owners generally as well as data \npertaining to specific groups.  It is also important to note that the Restaurant Revitalization Fund \nis a national relief program.  As such it is distinguishable from other regional programs that the \nSupreme Court found to be overinclusive.  See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 506.  The inclusion in \nthe presumption, for example, of Alaskan and Hawaiian natives is quite logical for a program \nthat offers relief funds to restaurants in Alaska and Hawaii.  This is not like the racial \nclassification in Croson, which was premised on the interest of compensating Black contractors \nfor past discrimination in Richmond, Virginia, but would have extended remedial relief to “an \nAleut citizen who moves to Richmond tomorrow.”  Id.  Here, any narrowly tailored racial \nclassification must necessarily account for the national scale of prior and present COVID-19 \nprograms.  \niv.  Historical Treatment of Gender-Based Classifications \nThe Supreme Court has historically declined to review sex- or gender-based \nclassifications under strict scrutiny.  For decades, women were not considered a protected class \nfor equal-protection purposes.  See, e.g., Bradwell v. People of State of Illinois, 83 U.S. 130, 131 \n(1873) (holding that Illinois’s policy refusing to license women as attorneys did not violate the \nFourteenth Amendment because, “[i]f we were to admit [women], we should be exercising the \nauthority conferred upon us in a manner which, we are fully satisfied, was never contemplated \nby the legislature”).  However, in 1971, the Supreme Court held, for the first time, that a statute \nfavoring males over females violated the Equal Protection Clause.  See Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. \n71, 77 (1971).  In Reed, the Court unanimously struck down an Idaho statute mandating that \nmale relatives were to be preferred over female relatives as estate administrators.  Id. at 76–77.  \n  23 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 23 of 30   PageID #: 207\n\nIn deciding the case, the Court applied the lowest level of scrutiny applicable to equal-protection \nchallenges:  rational-basis review.  Id.  The Reed court determined that the Idaho statute could \nnot withstand even this low-level of scrutiny, because it did not “bear[] a rational relationship to \n[the] state objective that it sought to be advanced.”  Id. at 75–76 (“A classification [based on sex] \n‘must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair \nand substantial relation to the object of the legislation[.]’” (quoting Royster Guano Co. v. \nVirginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920))).   \nThe Supreme Court’s next opportunity to examine the appropriate standard of review for \nsex-based distinctions resulted in a fractured plurality opinion.  See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 \nU.S. 677 (1973).  Eight justices agreed that a federal statute which assumed spouses of male \nuniformed-service members were dependents for quarters allowances and benefits but required \nproof of dependence for female members’ spouses violated equal protection.  See id. at 678–79.  \nA four-justice plurality applied strict-scrutiny to the classification, while a three-justice \nconcurrence urged the application of rational-basis review under Reed.  See id. at 691–92 \n(Powell, J., concurring) (“In my view, we can and should decide this case on the authority of \nReed and reserve for the future any expansion of its rationale.”).   \nNot long after Frontiero, the Supreme Court decided Craig v. Boren.  The majority in \nCraig applied an intermediate level of scrutiny to an Oklahoma statute allowing females to \npurchase 3.2% beer at age 18 but requiring males to reach age 21 before purchasing.  429 U.S. at \n197–98.  The Court held, “[t]o withstand constitutional challenge, . . . classifications by gender \nmust serve important governmental objective and must be substantially related to achievement of \nthose objectives,” and struck down the Oklahoma statute under this standard.  Id. at 197–204.  \n  24 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 24 of 30   PageID #: 208\n\nSince Craig, this intermediate scrutiny has continued to govern equal-protection challenges to \nclassifications based on sex. \na.  Important Governmental Interest \n“[A] gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and \ndirectly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened.”  Miss. Univ. for Women \nv. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 728 (1982) (citing Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975)); see \nalso Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 318 (“Reduction of the disparity in economic condition \nbetween men and women caused by the long history of discrimination against women has been \nrecognized as such an important governmental interest.”).   \nSex classifications may be used to compensate women “for particular economic \ndisabilities [they have] suffered,” [Califano, 430 U.S. at 320], to “promot[e] equal \nemployment opportunity,” see California Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, 479 \nU.S. 272, 289 (1987), [and] to advance full development of the talent and \ncapacities of our Nation’s people.  But such classifications may not be used, as \nthey once were, see [Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464, 467 (1948)], to create or \nperpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women. \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533–34 (1996). \nHowever, remedying past discrimination cannot serve as an important governmental \ninterest when there is no empirical evidence of discrimination within the field being legislated.  \nSee Hogan, 458 U.S. at 728; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 648 (1975) (“[T]he mere \nrecitation of a benign, compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield which protects against \nany inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.”).  “[A] State can evoke a \ncompensatory purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classification only if members of \nthe gender benefited by the classification actually suffer a disadvantage related to the \nclassification.”  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 728.  Under this framework, the Supreme Court has upheld \npro-women policies in areas where women had historically been discriminated against and has \nstruck down such policies in fields from which women had not historically been excluded.  \n  25 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 25 of 30   PageID #: 209\n\nCompare Califano, 430 U.S. at 318 (upholding provision of the Social Security Act that awarded \nmore favorable retirement benefits to female employees because they had been “unfairly \nhindered from earning as much as men”) and Schlesinger, 419 U.S. at 508 (upholding longer \ntenure prior to mandatory discharge for female line officers in the Navy because they “had less \nopportunity for promotion than did their male counterparts”), with Hogan, 458 U.S.at 729–30 \n(holding a nursing school’s policy of admitting only women unconstitutional because the school \n“made no showing that women lacked opportunities to obtain training in the field of nursing or to \nattain positions of leadership in that field”) and Weinberger, 420 U.S. at 648–48 (striking down a \nprovision of the Social Security Act that provided benefits to a widow with minor children but \nnot a widower with minor children because it was based upon stereotypes related to work and \nchildcare rather than a legitimate attempt to compensate women for economic difficulties).   \nAs with the strict-scrutiny analysis above, Congress had before it evidence showing that \nwoman-owned businesses suffered historical discrimination that exposed them to greater risks \nfrom an economic shock like COVID-19, and that they received less benefit from earlier federal \nCOVID-19 relief programs.  See, e.g., Long-Lasting Solutions for a Small Business Recovery: \nHearing Before the Committee on Small Business, at 55 (July 15, 2020), available at \nhttps://www.congress.gov/116/chrg/CHRG-116hhrg41297/CHRG-116hhrg41297.pdf (academic \nstudy noting that “female-owned companies are less likely to receive private investment”); \nSupporting Small and Minority-Owned Businesses Through the Pandemic, at 35 (Feb. 4, 2021), \navailable at https://www.congress.gov/117/chrg/CHRG-117hhrg43965/CHRG-\n117hhrg43965.pdf (prepared statement of Nneka Brown-Massey noting survey results showing \nthat “[w]omen-owned businesses had to wait longer, and in some cases were 10 times less likely \nto hear in a couple days from their lenders compared to their male counterparts” when seeking \n  26 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 26 of 30   PageID #: 210\n\nrelief from earlier federal COVID-19 relief programs); id. (noting that women were “twice as \nlikely . . . to not receive what they applied for” relative to male applicants, meaning they were \nforced to reduce pay and make other financial sacrifices at a higher rate).  Accordingly, \nDefendant has identified an important governmental interest in protecting women-owned \nbusinesses from the disproportionately adverse effects of the pandemic and failure of earlier \nfederal relief programs.  The Court therefore cannot conclude that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \non their gender-based equal-protection challenge in this respect.    \nb.  Substantial Relation \nTo be constitutional, the particular measure including a gender distinction must also be \nsubstantially related to the important interest it purports to advance.  “The purpose of requiring \nthat close relationship is to assure that the validity of a classification is determined through \nreasoned analysis rather than through the mechanical application of traditional, often inaccurate, \nassumptions about the proper roles of men and women.”  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 726.  For example, \nthe Supreme Court held that the Social Security policy of benefitting widows with young \nchildren but not widowers with young children was not substantially related to compensating \nwomen for economic difficulties because the policy did not award benefits to widows without \nminor children until they reached the age of 60 or suffered a disability.  Weinberger, 420 U.S. at \n651–52.  Similarly, in Hogan, the Supreme Court held that a nursing school’s female-only \nadmissions policy was not substantially related to the goal of “compensate[ing] for \ndiscrimination against women” because it was rooted in outdated gender stereotypes rather than \nempirical data about access to training.  458 U.S. at 727–30 (“Rather than compensate for \ndiscriminatory barriers faced by women, MUW’s policy of excluding males from admission to \n  27 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 27 of 30   PageID #: 211\n\nthe School of Nursing tends to perpetuate the stereotyped view of nursing as an exclusively \nwoman’s job.”). \nBy contrast, the statute allowing female naval line officers longer tenures before \nmandatory discharge was substantially related to the interest in providing female officers with \n“fair and equitable career advancement programs,” because the statute only applied to certain \ngroups officers in which men and women were not similarly situated with respect to \nopportunities for promotion.  Schlesinger, 419 U.S. at 508–09 (“The complete rationality of this \nlegislative classification is underscored by the fact that in corps where male and female \nlieutenants are similarly situated, Congress has not differentiated between them with respect to \ntenure.”) \nHere, as above, § 5003 of the ARPA is a one-time grant program with a finite amount of \nmoney that prioritizes small restaurants owned by veterans, women, and socially and \neconomically disadvantaged individuals because Congress had evidence before it showing that \nthose businesses were disproportionately exposed to harm from the COVID-19 pandemic and \ninadequately protected by earlier COVID-19 financial relief programs.  The prioritization of \nwomen-owned businesses under § 5003 is substantially related to the problem Congress sought \nto remedy because it is directly aimed at ameliorating the funding gap between women-owned \nand man-owned businesses that has caused the former to suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic at \ndisproportionately higher rates.  Accordingly, on the record before it, the Court cannot conclude \nthat Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their gender-based equal-protection claim.   \nB.  Irreparable Harm \n“[W]hen reviewing a motion for a preliminary injunction, if it is found that a \nconstitutional right is being threatened or impaired, a finding of irreparable injury is mandated.”  \n  28 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 28 of 30   PageID #: 212\n\nBonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 809 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976)).  However, the Court has not concluded that Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights are likely \nbeing violated.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are likely not suffering any legally impermissible \nirreparable harm.     \nC.  Harm to Others \nWere the Court to enjoin distributions under § 5003 of the ARPA, others would certainly \nsuffer harm, as these COVID-19 relief grants—which are intended to benefit businesses that \nhave suffered disproportionate harm—would be even further delayed.  \nD.  Public Interest \nIn the constitutional context, whether an injunction serves the public interest is \ninextricably intertwined with whether the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the \nmerits.  Cf. Liberty Coins, 748 F.3d at 690 (“[T]he determination of where the public interest lies \n[ ] is dependent on a determination of the likelihood of success on the merits of the First \nAmendment challenge because it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a \nparty’s constitutional rights.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  Plaintiff has not \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  The Court therefore cannot conclude that the \npublic interest would be served by enjoining disbursement of funds under § 5003 of the ARPA.     \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs’ motion for temporary restraining order (Doc. 12) \nis DENIED.  Plaintiffs are ORDERED to inform the Court on or before May 21, 2021, whether \nthey wish to persist in their motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. 11).  If so, the Court will \nlikely order expedited briefing and another hearing.   \n  29 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 24   Filed 05/19/21   Page 29 of 30   PageID #: 213\n\nSO ORDERED.        \n            /s/ Travis R.

Pearson, S & K \nSoup Co., Alfred Castiglioni, The 579 LLC, Chardonnays Inc., Zinfandel LLC, Denis Flanagan, \nand 3KAD LLC (collectively, the “Additional Plaintiffs”).  (Doc. 39.)  For the following reasons, \nthe Court DENIES the Additional Plaintiffs’ motion.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nAs part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARPA”), Congress appropriated \n$28,600,000,000 to a Restaurant Revitalization Fund (the “RRF”) and tasked the Administrator \nof the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) with disbursing funds to restaurants and other \neligible entities that suffered COVID-19 pandemic-related revenue losses.  The ARPA directs \nthe Administrator to “award grants to eligible entities in the order in which applications are \nreceived,” except that “during the initial 21-day period in which the Administrator awards \ngrants,” the Administrator “shall prioritize” awarding grants to: (1) business concerns owned and \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 44   Filed 06/10/21   Page 1 of 8   PageID #: 356\n\ncontrolled by women; (2) business concerns owned and controlled by veterans; and (3) socially \nand economically disadvantaged business concerns. \nOn May 12, 2021,1 Plaintiffs Antonio Vitolo and Jake’s Bar and Grill (the “Original \nPlaintiffs”) filed a complaint asserting that the ARPA’s twenty-one-day priority period violates \nthe United States Constitution’s equal protection clause and due process clause because it \nimpermissibly grants benefits and priority consideration based on race and gender classifications.  \n(Doc. 1, at 8–9.)  The Original Plaintiffs requested that the Court enter both a temporary \nrestraining order prohibiting the Small Business Administration from paying out grants from the \nRRF unless it processes applications in the order they were received (without regard to the race \nor gender of the applicant) and a preliminary injunction requiring the SBA to process \napplications and pay grants in the order received regardless of race or gender, among other forms \nof relief.  (Id. at 9–10.)   \nThe Court denied the Original Plaintiffs’ motion for temporary restraining order on May \n17, 2021.  (Docs. 20, 24.)  The Court subsequently denied the Original Plaintiffs’ motions for an \ninjunction pending appeal of the temporary restraining order (Doc. 27) and for a preliminary \ninjunction (Doc. 32.)  The Original Plaintiffs appealed the Court’s orders denying a temporary \nrestraining order (Doc. 25) and preliminary injunction (Doc. 33) to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit.  On May 27, 2021, the Sixth Circuit granted the Original \nPlaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending appeal, finding that the Original Plaintiffs were \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their case.  (Doc. 37.)  The injunction required the Government \n \n1 On the same day, the Original Plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order (Doc. \n12) and a motion for preliminary injunction (Doc. 11).  The Original Plaintiffs also filed a single \nmemorandum in support of their motions for temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction.  (Doc. 12-2.) \n2\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 44   Filed 06/10/21   Page 2 of 8   PageID #: 357\n\nto “fund the [Original Plaintiffs’] grant application, if approved, before all later-filed \napplications, without regard to processing time or the applicants’ race or sex.”  (Id. at 17.)   \nOn June 1, 2021, the Original Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add the Additional \nPlaintiffs.  (Doc. 34.)  Plaintiffs Sackett, Pearson, Castiglioni, and Flanagan allege that they all \napplied for grants from the RRF on May 3, 2021 and were “denied a priority preference based on \n[their] race and gender.”  (Id. at 3; see also Doc. 39-1, at 2; Doc. 39-2; Doc. 39-3; Doc 39-4.)  \nThe Additional Plaintiffs then filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction on June 2, 2021  (Doc. 39.) \nIn responding to the Additional Plaintiffs’ motion, the Government submitted the \ndeclaration of John A. Miller, Deputy Associate Administrator of Capital Access at SBA.  (Doc. \n41-1.)  In his declaration, Miller declared, under the penalty of perjury, that SBA:  (1)  has \nalready commenced processing non-priority applications, including the Additional Plaintiffs’ \napplications, in a sequential order based on its ordinary review practices; (2) is not currently \nprocessing any priority applications and will only resume processing for priority applications \nonce it completes processing for all previously filed non-priority applications, and only then if \nthe RRF is not first exhausted; and (3) has already initiated processing and consideration for all \nof the Additional Plaintiffs’ applications.  (Id. at 3–5.) \nII.  ANALYSIS \nThe Additional Plaintiffs seek an injunction identical to the one that the Sixth Circuit \nentered for the Original Plaintiffs, “ordering [the Government] to pay Additional Plaintiffs’ grant \napplications, if approved, before all later-filed applications, without regard to processing time or \n3\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 44   Filed 06/10/21   Page 3 of 8   PageID #: 358\n\nthe applicant’s race or sex.”2  (Doc. 39, at 1.)  In opposing the Additional Plaintiffs’ motion for \ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, the Government argues that the \nAdditional Plaintiffs’ claims are moot because the priority period has already expired, so there is \nno additional relief that the Court could afford the Additional Plaintiffs under SBA’s current \nprocessing procedures.  (Doc. 41, at 6–7.)  \n“Article III, § 2 of the United States Constitution vests federal courts with jurisdiction to \naddress ‘actual cases and controversies.’”  Thomas v. City of Memphis, No. 20-6118, 2021 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 12953, at *8 (6th Cir. Apr. 30, 2021) (citing Coal. for Gov’t Procurement v. Fed. \nPrison Indus., Inc., 365 F.3d 435, 458 (6th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted)).  Federal courts are \nprohibited from rendering decisions that “do not affect the rights of the litigants.”  Id. (citations \nomitted).  “A case becomes moot ‘when the issues presented are no longer live or parties lack a \nlegally cognizable interest in the outcome.’”  Id. (citing Cleveland Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. City of \nParma, Ohio, 263 F.3d 513, 530 (6th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted)).  “The ‘heavy burden’ of \ndemonstrating mootness falls on the party asserting it.”  Id. at *8–*9 (citing Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Envt’l. Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000)). \n“Voluntary cessation of [] alleged illegal conduct does not, as a general rule, moot a case \nand ‘deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case.’  Voluntary cessation will only \nmoot a case where there is ‘no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur,’ and \n‘interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged \nviolation.’”  Speech First, Inc. v. Schlissel, 939 F.3d 756, 767 (6th Cir. 2019) (citing Los Angeles \n \n2 This Court acknowledges that it is bound by the Sixth Circuit’s decision granting the Original \nPlaintiffs an injunction pending appeal, which found that the Original Plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claim.  The Additional Plaintiffs are nearly identical to the \nOriginal Plaintiffs in that they are white male business owners who applied for relief from the \nRRF on May 3, 2021, and were denied priority status on the basis of their gender and race. \n4\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 44   Filed 06/10/21   Page 4 of 8   PageID #: 359\n\nCnty. v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (quotation omitted)).  “[T]he burden in showing \nmootness is lower when it is the government that has voluntarily ceased its conduct,” because \n“‘cessation of [] allegedly illegal conduct by government officials has been treated with more \nsolicitude by the courts than similar action by private parties’ and [] ‘[the Government’s] self-\ncorrection provides a secure foundation for a dismissal based on mootness so long as it appears \ngenuine.’”  Id. at 767 (quoting Bench Billboard Co. v. City of Cincinnati, 675 F.3d 974, 981 (6th \nCir. 2012) (quotation omitted)). The Court “presume[s] that the same allegedly wrongful conduct \nby the government is unlikely to recur.”  Id. (citing Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189).  \nHowever, determining whether the ceased action could reasonably be expected to recur “takes \ninto account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the voluntary cessation, including the \nmanner in which the cessation was executed.”  Id. at 768.  “If the discretion to effect the change \nlies with one agency or individual, or there are no formal processes required to effect the change, \nsignificantly more than the bare solicitude itself is necessary to show that the voluntary cessation \nmoots the claim.”  Id. (citations omitted). \nA.  The Additional Plaintiff’s Claims are Moot Because an Injunction Would \nNot Affect Their Rights. \n \n  The Additional Plaintiffs joined this lawsuit on June 1, 2021, a week after the twenty-\none-day statutory priority period expired.   Because the twenty-one-day priority period has \nexpired, the Government is:  (1) processing non-priority applications, including the Additional \nPlaintiffs’ applications, in a sequential order based on its ordinary review practices; and (2) not \ncurrently processing any priority applications and will only resume processing priority \napplications once it completes processing all previously filed non-priority applications, and only \nthen if the RRF is not first exhausted.   \n \n5\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 44   Filed 06/10/21   Page 5 of 8   PageID #: 360\n\nAccordingly, there is no need for an order enjoining the Government to fund the \nAdditional Plaintiffs’ grant applications, “if approved, before all later-filed applications, without \nregard to processing time or the applicants’ race or sex.”  (See Doc. 37, at 17.)  SBA is already \nprocessing the Additional Plaintiffs’ applications without regard to race or sex, so an injunction \nwould not “affect the rights of the litigants” because “the issues presented are no longer live.”  \nThomas, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 12953, at *8 (citations omitted).   \n  Further, because SBA is no longer processing any priority applications, there is no need \nfor an injunction with respect to processing time.  In its order granting an injunction pending \nappeal, the Sixth Circuit was concerned about the “processing head start” that priority \napplications received compared to the Original Plaintiffs.  (Doc. 37, at 8.)  Specifically, the Sixth \nCircuit noted that: \n[T]he [RRF] program’s race and sex preferences did not end with the priority \nphase. That just marks when the Small Business Administration starts processing \napplications from non-priority restaurants. The agency says processing takes \napproximately 14 days.  So all of the “priority” applications that were received in \nthe 21-day window are still being processed first. And no application is paid out \nbefore going through the 14-day processing window. So with these preferences in \nplace, the fund may be depleted before the plaintiffs’ application has been \nprocessed. . . . Vitolo submitted his application on May 3. Restaurants that \nsubmitted “priority” applications on May 24 will likely receive their grants before \nthe agency has time to finish processing Vitolo’s application. . . . Since it \nnormally takes 14 days to process an application, this means that the agency \nshould be almost through priority applications received between May 3 and May \n11. But that leaves all the priority applications received between May 12 and May \n24, which have gotten a processing head start relative to Vitolo’s application. \nThere is a real risk that the funds will run out, unless the agency processes \nVitolo’s application before the May 12 to May 24 batch.  \n \n(Id. (citations omitted).)  Plaintiffs argue that entering an injunction identical to that ordered by \nthe Sixth Circuit “will avoid arbitrariness in which applicants get paid based on how long they \ntake time to process.”  (Doc. 43, at 2.)  However, the case at bar does not challenge the ordinary \ninternal review practices of SBA in processing RRF applications, but rather the SBA’s use of a \n6\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 44   Filed 06/10/21   Page 6 of 8   PageID #: 361\n\nrace- and gender-based priority period that gave priority applicants a “head start” on having their \napplication processed.  The SBA is no longer processing any priority applications.  The Court, \ntherefore, declines to enjoin the Government to require that the Additional Plaintiffs’ \napplications be approved without respect to processing time when processing time is no longer \naffected by the race- or gender-based priority period challenged in this suit. \nB.  The Government Has Clearly Shown that the Allegedly Wrongful Behavior \nCannot Reasonably Be Expected to Recur. \n \nSBA Deputy Associate Administrator Miller has sworn under penalty of perjury that the \nAdditional Plaintiffs’ applications are being processed sequentially without regard to race or \ngender, and that no additional priority applications will be processed by SBA unless and until all \npreviously-filed non-priority applications, including the Additional Plaintiffs’ applications, have \nbeen processed.  Although formal legislative processes are not required to change the SBA’s \ninternal application-review procedures, the Court considers the totality of the circumstances, \nincluding the Government’s self-corrections throughout this case, and determines that there is a \nsecure foundation for a dismissal based on mootness because the Government’s cessation \nappears genuine and has completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged \nConstitutional violation against the Additional Plaintiffs.  Therefore, the Court finds that it is \nclear that the allegedly wrongful behavior harming the Additional Plaintiffs cannot reasonably be \nexpected to recur, and therefore the Additional Plaintiffs’ claims are moot. \nHowever, the Government is ORDERED to file a notice with the Court as soon as \npossible if and/or when:  (1) the Additional Plaintiffs’ applications have been funded, and (2) \nSBA decides to resume processing of priority applications, before SBA begins to process said \npriority applications. \n   \n7\n   \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 44   Filed 06/10/21   Page 7 of 8   PageID #: 362\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated herein, the Additional Plaintiffs’ motion for temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction (Doc. 39) is DENIED.  The Government is ORDERED to file \na notice with the Court as soon as possible if and/or when:  (1) the Additional Plaintiffs’ \napplications have been funded, and (2) SBA decides to resume processing of priority \napplications. \nSO ORDERED.        \n            /s/ Travis R.

We hold that it cannot.\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page3 of 30 PageID#: 291\n\nCase: 21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:2 (4of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 2\nThus, we enjoin the government from using these unconstitutional criteria when processing\nAntonio Vitolo’s application.\nI.\nAs part of the most recent coronavirus relief bill (the American Rescue Plan Act of\n2021), Congress allocated nearly $29 billion for grants to help restaurant owners meet payroll\nand other expenses. Pub. L. No. 117-2, § 5003(b)(2)(A), (c) (Restaurant Revitalization Fund).\nThe fund was created to aid small privately owned restaurants, not large chains. Id.\n§ 5003(a)(4)(C). The Small Business Administration, a federal agency, processes the\napplications and distributes the funds. During the application process, restaurant owners must\ncertify to the agency that the grant is necessary to support ongoing operations. Id.\n§ 5003(c)(2)(A).\nThe key to getting a grant isto get in the queue before the money runs out. The Small\nBusiness Administration distributes money on a first come, first served basis. But there is a\ncatch. During the first 21 days the agency gives grants to priority applicants only. Id.\n§ 5003(c)(1). Priority applicants are restaurants that are at least 51% owned and controlled by\nwomen, veterans, or the “socially and economically disadvantaged.” Id.§ 5003(c)(3)(A); see\n15U.S.C. §§ 632(n), (q)(3), 637(a)(4)(A). Non-priority restaurants may apply during this time,\nbut they will not receive a grant until the initial period expires. Pub. L. No. 117-2,\n§ 5003(c)(3)(A). Ifthe fund is depleted by then, the non-priority restaurants are out of luck; the\nAct doesnot provide for its replenishment.\nAntonio Vitolo andhiswife own a restaurant calledJake’s Bar andGrill. Vitolo iswhite\nand his wife is Hispanic, and they each own 50% of the restaurant. Like many restaurants,\nJake’s Bar hasstruggled during the pandemic—it closed on weekdays and offered to-go orders\non weekends. It lost workers and a considerable amount in sales. So on the first day that the\nSmallBusinessAdministrationallowedapplications,Vitolo submittedone.\nSince the restaurant is not 51% owned by a woman or veteran, Vitolo had to qualify as\n“socially and economically disadvantaged” to get priority status. Id.§ 5003(c)(3)(A). The relief\nbill defines social and economic disadvantage by reference to the Small Business Act. See id.\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page4 of 30 PageID#: 292\n\nCase: 21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:3 (5of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 3\nUnder the Small BusinessAct, a personis considered“socially disadvantaged” if he has been\n“subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice” or “cultural bias” based solely on his immutable\ncharacteristics. 15 U.S.C. § 637(a)(5); 13 C.F.R. §124.103(a). A person is considered\n“economicallydisadvantaged”if (1)he is socially disadvantaged;and (2)he faces“diminished\ncapital and credit opportunities”comparedto non-sociallydisadvantagedpeople who operate in\nthe sameindustry. 15U.S.C.§637(a)(6)(A).\nThe Small Business Administration has injected explicit racial and ethnic preferences\ninto the priority process. See 13 C.F.R. § 124.103. Under a regulation that predates the\npandemic, the agency presumes certain applicants are socially disadvantaged based solely on\ntheir race or ethnicity. Groups that presumptively qualify as socially disadvantaged—and thus\nget to jump to the front of the line for priority consideration—include “Black Americans,”\n“Hispanic Americans,” “Asian Pacific Americans,” “Native Americans,” and “Subcontinent\nAsian Americans.”1 Id.§ 124.103(b)(1). If you are inone of these groups, the Small Business\nAdministration assumes you qualify as socially disadvantaged. Indeed, the only way not to\nqualify is if someone comes forward “with credible evidence to the contrary.” Id.\n§ 124.103(b)(3).\nApplicants who do not get the presumptionmust prove they have experienced racial or\nethnic discriminationor cultural bias by a preponderance of the evidence. Id.§ 124.103(c)(1).\nAfter reviewingthat evidence, the Small Business Administration will consider an applicant a\nvictim of “individualsocial disadvantage” ifitdeterminesthat (i)the applicant sufferedepisodes\nof discrimination;(ii)each episode “negatively impactedthe individual’sentry or advancement\n1Other than those considered black, Hispanic, or Native American, a person receives a rebuttable\npresumptionof socialdisadvantageonly ifhe or she has“originsfrom” a country identifiedby the SmallBusiness\nAdministration. 13C.F.R.§ 124.103(b)(1). Itisunclear what it meansto have“originsfrom” a specific country,\nbutthe agency tells usthat“[b]eingbornina country does not,by itself,suffice.” Id.\nAsian Pacific Americans qualify only if they have origins from Burma,Thailand,Malaysia,Indonesia,\nSingapore,Brunei,Japan,China (includingHongKong),Taiwan,Laos,Cambodia (Kampuchea),Vietnam,Korea,\nthe Philippines,U.S.Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Republic of Palau),Republic of the MarshallIslands,\nFederated Statesof Micronesia,the Commonwealthof the NorthernMariana Islands,Guam,Samoa,Macao,Fiji,\nTonga,Kiribati,Tuvalu,or Nauru.Id.\nSubcontinentAsianAmericansmusthaveoriginsfromIndia,Pakistan,Bangladesh,SriLanka,Bhutan,the\nMaldivesIslands,or Nepal.Id.\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page5 of 30 PageID#: 293\n\nCase: 21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:4 (6of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 4\nin the business world”; and(iii)together, those episodes caused the applicant to suffer “chronic\nandsubstantial social disadvantage.” Id.§ 124.103(c)(6).\nThe added evidentiary burden faced by white men and other non-presumptively\ndisadvantaged groups stands in marked contrast with lenient evidentiary standards set by the\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act. Congress recognized the urgency of providing relief to small\nrestaurants struggling to weather the pandemic. So it sought to cut as much redtape as possible.\nTo avoid “imposing additional burdens on applicants,” the Act requires the Small Business\nAdministration to accept the applicant’s “existing business identifiers” to show eligibility for a\ngrant, rather than requiring “other forms of registration or identification that may not be common\nto their industry.” Pub. L. No. 117-2, § 5003(c)(2)(B). The government relies on restaurant\nowners to self-certify that they meet these eligibility criteria when applying for a grant. Id.\n§ 5003(c)(2)(A).\nVitolo sued to end the race and sex preferences in grant funding, claiming that they\nviolated his constitutional rights. With the funds rapidly depleting, Vitolo asked for a temporary\nrestraining order and ultimately a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the government\nfrom handing out grants based on the applicants’ race or sex. The district court declined to issue\na restraining order and said that Vitolo was unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim. Vitolo\nfiled a notice of appeal, and he asked the district court to enjoin the race and sex preferences\nuntil his appeal was decided. The district court denied that motion too. Finally,the district court\ndenied the motion for a preliminary injunction.2 Vitolo also appealed that order.\nVitolo has fileda motion to expedite the appeal, which we grant. Before turning to the\nmeritsof the preliminaryinjunction,we handlea couple issuesthe government hasraised.\nII.\nFirst, during the briefing for the preliminary injunction in the district court, the\ngovernment argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the Small Business\n2While we ultimately disagree with the district court,we appreciate the district judge’s diligence in\nhandlingthismatter.

But\nthe district court correctly rejected that argument. The injury here is “the denial of equal\ntreatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the\nbenefit.” Ne. Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656,\n666 (1993); see also Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1,551U.S. 701,\n719 (2007) (“[O]ne form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause isbeingforced to compete\nin a race-based system that may prejudice the plaintiff.” (citations omitted)). The government’s\nuse of racialpreferences causes that injury. And that injury isredressable by a decision ordering\nthe government not to grant priority consideration based on the race of applicants. See Lujan v.\nDefs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,560 (1992); see also Waskul v.Washtenaw Cnty. Cmty. Mental\nHealth,900 F.33250, 255 n.3(6thCir.2018) (noting that at the preliminary injunction stage the\nplaintiff must show“a substantial likelihood of standing”).\nItdoes not matter that the plaintiffs might not otherwise qualify for priority consideration.\nFor if the court enjoined use of “the race-based presumption of the SBA regulations or the race-\nconscious portions of the definition of ‘socially disadvantaged,’. ..the playing field inqualifying\nfor the priority period would be ‘leveled.”’ R. 32, Pg. ID268. Why? Because the race of the\napplicant “would not factor into the order in which applications are processed by SBA.” Id.\nThat is enough to show a substantial likelihood of success on standing—and, indeed, the\ngovernment hasnot claimed otherwise on appeal.\nSecond,the governmentarguesthat the plaintiffs’claim ismoot. Whilethis case was on\nappeal, the 21-day “priority” phase of the grant program ended. The statute now requires the\nSmall Business Administration to begin processing grant requests in the order they were\nreceived,without regard to the applicants’ race or sex. Thus, the government says, there is no\nusefor a court order requiringitto do the same.\nMootness is a high hurdle. The government must show that a court could order no\n“effectual reliefwhatever” for the plaintiffs’injury. Chafinv. Chafin,568U.S.165,172(2013)\n(citation omitted). What’s more, the government must show that it has “completely and\nirrevocablyeradicatedthe effects” of the program’srace andsex preferences. LosAngelesCnty.\nv. Davis,440 U.S.625, 631(1979). But the government hasn’t cleared the bar. Race and sex\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page7 of 30 PageID#: 295\n\nCase: 21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:6 (8of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 6\npreferencescontinueto bear onwhetheranapplicant receivesa grant before the money runsout.\nAnda court order endingthose preferenceswill relievethe plaintiffs’injury (andallow Vitolo’s\napplicationto beconsideredsoonerthanitotherwisewould).\nMost fundamentally, the program’s race and sex preferences did not end with the priority\nphase. That just marks when the Small Business Administration starts processing applications\nfrom non-priority restaurants. The agency says processing takes approximately 14 days. Miller\nDecl.¶ 14. So all of the “priority” applications that were received inthe 21-day window are still\nbeing processed first. And no application ispaid out before going through the 14-day processing\nwindow. Id. ¶ 15. So with these preferences in place, the fund may be depleted before the\nplaintiffs’ application has been processed. There is an obvious solution to this of course: The\nagency can simply fund grantsinthe order they were received—without regard to priority status,\nand without regard to the processing head start that many applications received on the basis of\nrace and sex.\nTurning to this case, plaintiffs continue to suffer a real and concrete injury by having\ntheir application considered behind the priority applications because of race and sex. Vitolo\nsubmitted hisapplication on May 3. Restaurants that submitted “priority” applications on May\n24 will likely receive their grants before the agency has time to finish processing Vitolo’s\napplication. Add to this the fact that over half the funds have been approved to be distributed as\nof May 25, 2021, to priority applicants. Miller Decl. ¶ 22. Since it normally takes 14 days to\nprocess anapplication, this means that the agency should be almost through priority applications\nreceived between May 3 and May 11. But that leaves all the priority applications received\nbetween May 12 and May 24, which have gotten a processing head start relative to Vitolo’s\napplication. There isa real risk that the funds will run out,unless the agency processes Vitolo’s\napplication before the May 12 to May 24 batch. For these reasons, the government has failed to\nshowthat the case ismoot.\nIII.\nWe consider four factors in determiningwhether a preliminaryinjunctionshould issue:\n(1)whether the movingparty has showna likelihoodof success on the merits;(2)whether the\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page8 of 30 PageID#: 296\n\nCase: 21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:7 (9of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 7\nmoving party will be irreparably injured absent an injunction; (3)whether issuing an injunction\nwill harm other parties to the litigation; and (4)whether an injunction is in the public interest.\nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009). In constitutional cases, the first factor is typically\ndispositive. Roberts v. Neace, 958 F.3d 409, 416 (6th Cir. 2020) (order) (per curiam). That’s\nbecause “[w]hen constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable injury is presumed.”\nObama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012). And no cognizable harm results\nfrom stopping unconstitutional conduct, so “it isalways inthe public interest to prevent violation\nof a party’s constitutional rights.” Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville\n& Davidson Cnty., 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). We thus focus our\nanalysis on the plaintiffs’ likelihood of successon the merits.\nVitolo challenges the Small Business Administration’s use of race and sex preferences\nwhen distributing Restaurant Revitalization Funds. The government concedes that it uses race\nand sex to prioritize applications, but it contends that its policy is still constitutional. We\ndisagree.\nA.\nWe start with race. Government policies that classify people by race are presumptively\ninvalid. U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 234, 235\n(1995) (applying equal-protection principles to federal policies that discriminate by race). To\novercome that presumption, the government must show that favoring one race over another is\nnecessary to achieve a compelling state interest. Id.at 235. And even when the government can\nshow that it has a compelling interest, it must narrowly tailor its remedy to advance that interest.\nThis is a very demanding standard, which few programs will survive. See Parents Involved,\n551U.S.at 720.\nThe government concedes that strict scrutiny applies to its methodof distributingthese\nfunds. Andfor goodreason: The policygrantsprivilegesto individualsbasedexplicitly ontheir\nrace.\nCompellingInterest. Becausestrict scrutiny applies,we must first consider whether the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in giving some races priority access to the Restaurant\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page9 of 30 PageID#: 297\n\nCase: 21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:8 (10of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 8\nRevitalization Funds, and for presumptively sending men from non-favored racial groups\n(includingwhites, some Asians,and most Middle Easterners)to the back of the line. We hold\nthat it doesnot.\nThe government says it has a compelling interest in remedying past societal\ndiscriminationagainst minority businessowners. The Supreme Court has told us that remedial\npoliciescan sometimesjustify preferential treatment based on race. City of Richmondv. J.A.\nCrosonCo.,488U.S.469,493–94(1989)(pluralityopinion);Adarand,515 U.S.at 237. Butthe\nbar is a highone. The governmenthasa compellinginterest inremedyingpast discrimination\nonly whenthreecriteriaaremet:\nFirst,the policymust target a specific episode of past discrimination. Itcannot rest ona\n“generalizedassertionthat therehasbeenpast discriminationinanentire industry.” J.A. Croson\nCo., 488 U.S.at 498; see also Adarand, 515 U.S.at 226; Aiken v. City of Memphis,37 F.3d\n1155,1162–63(6thCir.1994)(enbanc)(explainingthat societal discriminationisnot enoughto\njustify racialclassificationsandthat there must be priordiscriminationby the governmentalunit\ninvolved).\nSecond, there must be evidence of intentional discriminationin the past. J.A. Croson\nCo., 488 U.S. at 503 (requiring an “inference of discriminatory exclusion”). Statistical\ndisparities don’t cut it, although they may be used as evidence to establish intentional\ndiscrimination. See Aiken, 37 F.3dat 1163; United Black FirefightersAss’n v. City of Akron,\n976F.2d999,1011(6thCir.1992).\nThird,the governmentmust have had a hand inthe past discrimination it now seeksto\nremedy. Soifthe government“show[s]that it hadessentiallybecomea ‘passiveparticipant’ina\nsystem of racialexclusionpracticedby elementsof [a] local... industry,”thenthe government\ncanact to undothe discrimination. J.A.CrosonCo.,488U.S.at 492 (pluralityopinion). But if\nthe governmentcannot show that it actively or passively participatedin this past discrimination,\nrace-basedremedialmeasuresviolateequal-protectionprinciples.\nThe government’sassertedcompellinginterestmeetsnone of these requirements. First,\nthe government points generally to societal discriminationagainst minority business owners.\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page10of 30 PageID#: 298\n\nCase: 21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:9 (11of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 9\nButitdoes not identifyspecific incidentsof past discrimination. Andsince “aneffort to alleviate\nthe effects of societaldiscrimination isnot a compellinginterest,”the government’s policy isnot\npermissible. Shaw v. Hunt,517 U.S.899,909–10 (1996); see also ParentsInvolved,551U.S.at\n731(plurality opinion) (“remedying past societal discrimination does not justify race-conscious\ngovernment action”).\nSecond, the government offers little evidence of past intentional discrimination against\nthe many groups to whom it grants preferences. Indeed, the schedule of racial preferences\ndetailed in the government’s regulation—preferencesfor Pakistanis but not Afghans; Japanese\nbut not Iraqis;Hispanicsbut not Middle Easterners—isnot supportedby any recordevidence at\nall.\nWhen the government promulgates race-based policies, it must operate with a scalpel.\nAnd its cuts must be informed by data that suggest intentional discrimination. The broad\nstatistical disparities cited by the government are not nearly enough. For example, a witness\ntestified before a congressional committee that 32% of Hispanic-owned small businesses and\n41% of black-owned small businesses have gone under during the pandemic, compared to only\n22% of white-owned small businesses. When there is a single decisionmaker behind\nthe disparity, extreme differences among races may permit an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination—for example, when a city hires one race at a disproportionate rate. See United\nBlack FirefightersAss’n,976 F.2dat 1011(noting that “[w]here a gross disparity exists between\nthe expected percentage of minorities selected and the actual percentage of minoritiesselected,\nthen prima facie [but rebuttable] proof exists to demonstrate intentional discrimination in the\nselection of minorities to those particular positions”). But when it comes to general social\ndisparities, there are simply too many variables to support inferences of intentional\ndiscrimination. See J.A.CrosonCo., 488 U.S.at 501–03; Associated Gen. Contractors of Ohio,\nInc.v.Drabik,214 F.3d730,736–37 (6thCir.2000).\nThird, the government has not shown that it participated inthe discrimination it seeks to\nremedy. When opposing the plaintiffs’ motions at the district court, the government identified\nstatements by members of Congress as evidence that race- and sex-based grant funding would\nremedy past discrimination. For example, the government points to a House subcommittee\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page11of 30 PageID#: 299\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:10 (12of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 10\nhearing aimed at “understanding why aid to minority-owned businesses was delayed.” R.18,Pg.\nID 109 (cleaned up). But rather than telling the court what Congress learned and how that\nsupports its remedial policy, it said only that Congress identified a “theme” that “minority- and\nwomen-owned businesses” needed targeted relief from the pandemic because Congress’s “prior\nrelief programs had failed to reach” them. Id.,Pg. ID 108. A vague reference to a “theme” of\ngovernmental discrimination is not enough. To satisfy equal protection, the government must\nidentify “prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved” or “passive participa[tion] in a\nsystem of racial exclusion.” J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 492 (plurality opinion) (cleaned up).\nAn observation that prior, race-neutral relief efforts failed to reach minorities is no evidence at\nallthat the government enacted or administered those policies ina discriminatory way.\nFor these reasons, we conclude that the government lacks a compelling interest in\nawardingRestaurantRevitalizationFundsbased on the race of the applicants. And as a result,\nthe policy’suseof raceviolatesequal protection.\nNarrow Tailoring. Even if the government had shown a compelling state interest in\nremedying some specific episode of discrimination, the discriminatory disbursement of\nRestaurantRevitalizationFundsisnotnarrowlytailoredto further that interest.\nFor a policy to survive narrow-tailoring analysis, the government must show “serious,\ngood faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.” Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.\n306, 339 (2003); J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 507. This requires the government to engage in a\ngenuine effort to determine whether alternative policies could address the alleged harm. And, in\nturn, a court must not uphold a race-conscious policy unlessitis “satisfied that no workable race-\nneutral alternative” would achieve the compelling interest. Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin,\n570 U.S. 297, 312 (2013). Inaddition, a policy is not narrowly tailored if it iseither overbroad\nor underinclusive inits use of racial classifications. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.at 507–08; Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S.244, 273–75 (2003).\nHere, the government could have used any number of alternative, nondiscriminatory\npolicies. Yet it failed to do so. For example, the government contends that minority-owned\nbusinesses disproportionately struggled to obtain capital and credit during the pandemic. But an\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page12of 30 PageID#: 300\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:11 (13of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 11\nobvious race-neutralalternativeexists: The government couldgrant priority considerationto all\nbusinessownerswho were unableto obtainneededcapital or credit duringthe pandemic.\nOr consider another of the government’s arguments. It contends that earlier coronavirus\nrelief programs “disproportionately failed to reach minority-owned businesses.” Gov’t Resp. 15\n(citation omitted). But a simple race-neutral alternative exists again: The government could\nsimply grant priority consideration to all small business owners who have not yet received\ncoronavirus relief funds. Indeed, the government already requires applicants to disclose what\nprior assistance they have received—it need only make that criterion dispositive.\nBecause these race-neutral alternatives exist, the government’s use of race is\nunconstitutional. Aside from the existence of race-neutral alternatives, the government’s use of\nracial preferences isboth overbroad and underinclusive. This isalso fatal to the policy. Gratz,\n539 U.S.at 273–75.\nThe government argues its program is not underinclusive because people of all colors can\ncount as suffering “social disadvantage.” Gov’t Resp. 17–18. But there is a critical difference\nbetween the designated races and the non-designated races. The designated races get a\npresumption that others do not. And that presumption can only be overcome if someone comes\nforward with written evidence that the applicant has not been “subjected to racial or ethnic\nprejudice or cultural bias.” 13 C.F.R. § 124.103(a), (b)(3). Since proving someone else has\nnever experienced racial or ethnic discrimination is virtually impossible, this “presumption” is\ndispositive.\nThe non-designated races start with a much higher hurdle. They must bring forward\nevidence that they suffered episodes of discrimination, which have “negatively impacted” their\n“advancement inthe businessworld,” and which causedthem to suffer “chronic andsubstantial\nsocialdisadvantage.” Id.§ 124.103(c)(6). Putthis high hurdle against the rapiddepletionof the\nmoney andthe 21-day window,andthe hurdlebecomesa wall.\nThe government’s policy is plagued with other forms of underinclusivity. Consider the\nrequirement that a business must be at least 51% owned by women or minorities. How does that\nhelp remedy past discrimination? Black investors may have small shares in lots of restaurants,\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page13of 30 PageID#: 301\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:12 (14of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 12\nnone greater than 51%. But does that mean those owners did not suffer economic harms from\nracial discrimination? Indeed, the restaurant at issue, Jake’s Bar, is 50% owned by a Hispanic\nfemale. It is far from obvious why that 1% difference in ownership is relevant. Yet the\ngovernment fails to explain why that cutoff relatesto its stated remedial purpose.\nThe dispositive presumption enjoyed by designated minorities bears strikingly little\nrelation to the asserted problem the government istrying to fix. For example, the government\nattempts to defend its policy by citing a study showing it was harder for black business ownersto\nobtain loans from Washington, D.C., banks. Gov’t Resp. 15. Rather than simply designating\nthose owners as the harmed group, the government relied on the Small Business\nAdministration’s 2016 regulation granting racial preferences to vast swaths of the population.\nFor example, individuals who trace their ancestry to Pakistan and India qualify for special\ntreatment. But those from Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq do not. Those from China, Japan, and\nHong Kong all qualify. But those from Tunisia, Libya, and Morocco do not. This scattershot\napproach does not conform to the narrow tailoring strict scrutiny requires.\nThe stark realities of the Small Business Administration’s racial gerrymandering are\ninescapable. Imagine two childhood friends—one Indian, one Afghan. Both own restaurants,\nand both have suffered devastating losses during the pandemic. If both apply to the Restaurant\nRevitalization Fund, the Indian applicant will presumptively receive priority consideration over\nhis Afghan friend. Why? Because of his ethnic heritage. It is indeed “a sordid business” to\ndivide “us up by race.” League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Perry,548 U.S.399, 511(2006)\n(opinion of Roberts, C.J.). And the government’s attempt to do so here violates the Constitution.\nB.\nThe plaintiffs also challenge the government’s prioritization of women-owned\nrestaurants. Like racial classifications, sex-based discrimination is presumptively invalid. U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV; United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (1996). Government policies\nthat discriminate based on sex cannot stand unless the government provides an “exceedingly\npersuasive justification.” Virginia, 518 U.S.at 531. To meet this burden, the government must\nprove that (1) a sex-based classification serves “important governmental objectives,” and (2)the\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page14of 30 PageID#: 302\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:13 (15of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 13\nclassification is “substantially and directly related” to the government’s objectives. Miss. Univ.\nfor Womenv.Hogan,458 U.S.718,724,730 (1982)(cleanedup).\nThe government fails to satisfy either prong. For starters, it fails to show that prioritizing\nwomen-owned restaurants serves an important governmental interest. The government claims an\ninterest in “assisting with the economic recovery of women-owned businesses, which were\n‘disproportionately affected’ by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Gov’t Resp. 20. But while\nremedying specific instances of past sex discrimination can serve as a valid governmental\nobjective, general claims of societal discrimination are not enough. Hogan, 458 U.S. at 727–29.\nInstead,to have a legitimate interest in remedying sex discrimination, the government\nfirst needs proof that discrimination occurred. Thus, the government must show that the sex\nbeing favored “actually suffer[ed] a disadvantage” as a result of discrimination in a specific\nindustry or field. Id.at 728; see Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 648 (1975) (“[T]he\nmere recitation of a benign, compensatory purpose is not an automatic shield which protects\nagainst any inquiry into the actual purposes underlying a statutory scheme.”); see also Craig v.\nBoren, 429 U.S. 190,200–04 (1976) (describing the high bar to using statistics as evidence of\ndiscrimination and concluding that “proving broad sociological propositions by statistics is a\ndubious business”). The government fails that burden here. It gives only a few examples of\nstatistical disparities between women-owned and male-owned businesses. For just one: The\ngovernment cites a survey that purportsto show that women who received Paycheck Protection\nProgram loansasked for 40% lessfunding on average than their male counterparts. Statements\nof this nature do nothingto support aninference of intentional discrimination. Without proof of\nintentional discrimination against women, a policy that discriminates on the basis of sex cannot\nserve a valid governmental objective.\nAdditionally,the government’sprioritizationsystem is not “substantiallyrelatedto” its\npurported remedial objective. See Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. at 651–53. The priority system is\ndesignedto fast-track applicantshardest hit by the pandemic. Yet under the Act, all women-\nowned restaurantsare prioritized—evenif they are not “economicallydisadvantaged.” Pub.L.\nNo. 117-2, §5003(c)(3)(A). So whether a given restaurant did better or worse than a male-\nowned restaurant next door is of no matter—aslongas the restaurant is at least 51% women-\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page15of 30 PageID#: 303\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:14 (16of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 14\nowned and otherwise meets the statutory criteria, it receives priority status. Because the\ngovernment made no effort to tailor its priority system, we cannot find that the sex-based\ndistinction is “substantially related” to the objective of helping restaurants disproportionately\naffected by the pandemic.3\nThe government contends that women “struggled to receive pandemic relief from the\nFederal government” from prior aid programs. Gov’t Resp. 20 (citation omitted). But as we\npreviously discussed,the government hasa ready alternative: Givepriority to restaurant owners\nwho didnot receiveprior aid. There isnoneedto use sex as a proxy when the government seeks\nto remedy a problem that ispurely economic.\nHow does the government respond to all this? It faults the plaintiffsfor offering“no\nmeaningful argument that a priority period for women-owned businesses is not substantially\nrelatedto the achievementof that objective.” Id.(cleanedup). But that getsthingsbackwards:\nIt was the government’s burden to show that its discriminatory policy passes the substantial-\nrelationtest. Virginia,518 U.S. at 533 (“The burdenof justificationis demandingand it rests\nentirelyonthe State.”). Onthis score,the plaintiffsdidnot needto say a word.\nThus,the government has failed to provide an exceedinglypersuasive justification that\nwouldallowtheclassificationto stand.\nC.\nThe plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction pending appeal. Since the government failed\nto justify its discriminatory policy, the plaintiffs will win on the merits of their constitutional\nclaim. And like in most constitutional cases, that is dispositive here. See Roberts, 958 F.3d at\n416; Husted, 697 F.3d at 436; Deja Vu, 274 F.3d at 400; see also Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241F.3d\n800, 809 (6th Cir. 2001) (“[W]hen reviewing a motion for a preliminary injunction, if it is found\nthat a constitutional right is being threatened or impaired, a finding of irreparable injury is\nmandated.”).\n3Ourcourthaspreviouslyappliedstrictscrutinyto sex-basedaffirmative-actionprograms.Brunetv.City\nof Columbus,1 F.3d390,404(6thCir.1993).

It took nearly200years for the\nSupreme Court to firmly establish that our Constitution permits the government to use race-\nbased classifications to remediate past discrimination. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\n438 U.S.265 (1978). It took only seven days for the majority to undermine that longstanding\nandenduringprinciple.\nThe majority’s conclusion that Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief requires us to\nmake several assumptions. The majority’s reasoning suggests we live in a world in which\ncenturies of intentional discrimination and oppression of racial minorities have been eradicated.\nThe majority’s reasoning suggests we live ina world in which the COVID-19 pandemic did not\nexacerbate the disparities enabled by those centuries of discrimination. The majority’s reasoning\nsuggests that we live in a world in which Congress passed the Restaurant Revitalization Fund\n(“RRF”) not to aid the nation’s economic recovery, but to arbitrarily provide special treatment to\nracial minorities and women.\nThe majority’s reasoning leads it to a puzzling, if not predictable, conclusion that the\ntwenty-one-day priority period in the RRF—a short-term, narrowly tailored, carefully calibrated\nmeasure designed to assist businesses most devastated by the pandemic—is unconstitutional.\nBecause I find that the RRF is a carefully targeted measure necessitated by an unparalleled\npandemic, and because Plaintiffs have not demonstrated irreparable harm or a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, I dissent.\nI.\nThe constitutional issues involvedin this case are controversial,thorny, and unsettled.\nHowever,I start by expressingmydisappointmentin our Court’suse of the emergency appellate\ndocket. Last year,I opinedonthis issue inthe contextof a caseinvolvingthe constitutionalityof\ntwo COVID-19-related executive orders issued by the Governor of Kentucky. Pleasant View\nBaptistChurch v.Beshear,838F.App’x 936,939-42 (6thCir.2020). I warnedagainst the “use\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page18of 30 PageID#: 306\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:17 (19of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 17\nof the Court’s emergency docket” as a “forum to advocate for abrupt and sweeping change to\nwell-settledfederal law.” Id. My concerninthat casewas withthe parties;today,myconcernis\nfocusedonthe Court.\nHere, Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought injunctive relief in the district court averring that\nthe RRF’s 21-day priority period was unconstitutional. During the priority period, the Small\nBusiness Administration (“SBA”) provides grants to restaurants that are at least 51% owned and\ncontrolled by women, veterans, or “socially and economically disadvantaged” individuals. Pub.\nL. No. 117-2, § 5003(c)(3)(A); see 15 U.S.C. §§ 632(n), (q)(3), 637(a)(4)(A). The RRF—by\nway of SBA regulation—establishes rebuttable presumptions that individuals of certain races or\nethnicities are “socially disadvantaged.” 13 C.F.R. § 124.103. The district court denied\nPlaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order that would have prohibited the government\nfrom prioritizing funding based on an applicant’s race or sex. In doing so, the district court\nrejected Plaintiffs’ claimsthat the applicable provisionsof the RRF violate the Constitution.\nThis case initially came to us on appeal after Plaintiffsfiled an “emergency motion,”\ncontendingthat they wouldbeirreparablyharmedabsentimmediateinterventionfromthis Court\nbecause the pool of money in the RRFwas shrinkingeveryday.1 Specifically,they argued that\n“[i]fthis Court d[id] not promptlyhalt all paymentsfrom the [RRF],the limitedavailablefunds\nw[ould] befully depleted before the disfavoredgroups(largely white males)ever have a shot at\nthismuch-neededrelief.” (Mot.at 23).\nAt the time of Plaintiffs’ initial filing in this Court, Plaintiffs stated that, as of May 12,\nRRF applications amounted to a total of $29 billion inrequests, which exceeded the $28.6 billion\nthat Congress appropriated for the entire program. (Mot. at 9). Plaintiffs conceded, however,\nthat the SBA had only depleted about 20 percent of the available funds. (Id. at 9-10). Plaintiffs\neffectively asked the Court to assume that the government would pay out every application\ncurrently pending, such that no funds would remain at the conclusion of the prioritization period.\nPlaintiffs did not cite to any provision inthe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARA”), nor\nany facts in the record, to suggest that such an outcome was likely to occur. In short, Plaintiffs\n1Asoutlined above by the majority,the districtcourt eventuallyalso denied Plaintiffs’motionfor a\npreliminaryinjunction,butthatcameseveraldayslater,afterPlaintiffshadalreadyfiledtheirappealinthisCourt.\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page19of 30 PageID#: 307\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:18 (20of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 18\nhad failed to meet their burdenof showing irreparable harm. See D.T. v. Sumner Cnty.Schs.,\n942 F.3d324, 327 (6thCir. 2019) (“To merit a preliminary injunction,an injury must be both\ncertainandimmediate,notspeculativeor theoretical.”)(internalquotationmarksomitted).2\nThis Court asked the government for additional facts relatedto “the status of the [RRF],\nincluding but not limited to the amount of unallocated funds remaining, what the daily\ndisbursements have been for the past week, and any projections as to when the fund will run\nout[.]” (Doc. No. 11). Of course, these facts would help the district court—and then this\nCourt—better understand the priority program framework, and, in turn, whether Plaintiffs were\ntruly at risk of not beingable to receivefunds. But by requestingthat the government provideus\nwith this information,we effectively shifted the burden to the government to prove that Plaintiffs\nwould not suffer irreparable harm. This perverts the Rule 65 standard for injunctive relief. See\nGranny Goose Foods, Inc.v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Loc. No. 70, 415 U.S.\n423,443 (1974) (“The burdenwas on employers to show that they were entitled to a preliminary\ninjunction,not on the Union to show that they were not.”)(emphasis added); N.Am. CoalCorp.\nv. Loc. Union 2262, United Mine Workers of Am., 497 F.2d 459, 465 (6th Cir. 1974) (“[T]he\nburden of proof remains upon the party seeking the extraordinary relief […] until all necessary\nelements to the issuance of aninjunctionhavebeenestablished.”).3\nUnder such novel standards,plaintiffsseeking injunctive relief will only have to show\nthat there is some possibility that they might suffer possible irreparableharm. Ostensibly,they\ncould label their appeal as an “emergency,” and the appellate court could hold the case\n2We could have also dismissed this case on jurisdictional grounds. Plaintiffs’ initial emergency motion\naddressed onlythe districtcourt’s denial oftheir request for a temporary restraining order. “Asa generalrule,we do\nnot entertain appealsfrom a district court’sdecision to grant or deny a temporary restraining order. That’s because\ntemporary restraining orders are usually of short duration and usually terminate with a prompt ruling on a\npreliminary injunction, from which the losing party has an immediate right of appeal.” Maryville Baptist Church,\nInc.v. Beshear,957 F.3d610,612(6thCir.2020) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Before the districtcourt\nruled on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the government provided sworn testimony to us indicating\nthat it was reservingthe full amountof the money Plaintiffs requested. Assuch,evenif we had dismissed Plaintiffs’\ninitialemergency motion,it wouldnothave affectedtheir abilityto obtainrelief.\n3The impropriety of the burden-shifting aside, it is improper to ask any party to “reinvent the evidentiary\nwheel and engage inunnecessarily duplicative, costly, and time-consuming factfinding[,]” when only the Court—\nand not the parties themselves—seeks that additional information. City of Richmond v. JA Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n469,547 (1989) (Marshall,J.,dissenting).\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page20of 30 PageID#: 308\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:19 (21of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 19\nindefinitely until the facts develop to the point where imminent harm is discernable. We have\nnever recognized such a low burden for such extraordinary relief; such a process isantithetical\nto Rule 65. To even consider issuing an injunction on pure speculation that a constitutional\nviolation might arise inthe future isinappropriate and beyond our role as a reviewing court.\nI do not subscribe to new procedures that place this Court in a quasi-fact-finding role,\nespecially where Plaintiffs themselves failed to ask for limited discovery or otherwise explain\nwhy any new facts were necessary to the resolution of their claims. They were the party\nasserting an emergency, and “our adversary system is designed around the premise that the\nparties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments\nentitling them to relief.” Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237, 244 (2008) (internal\nquotation and citation omitted). See also Carducci v. Regan,714 F.2d171,177 (D.C.Cir.1983)\n(“The premise of our adversarial system isthat appellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards\nof legal inquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued\nby the partiesbefore them.”) (emphasisadded).\nInany case, the record should be developed before the district court, not here. Simply\nput, Plaintiffsdidnot present any evidence with their initialemergency motion that they were at\nrisk of irreparable harm,andit isnot our role as a reviewing court to find merit in a claim when\nit isnot apparent from the record.\nII.\nOther aspects of this appeal concern me as well. If Plaintiffs’ initial emergency motion\nwas limited solely to their request for injunctive relief as to their individual claims, the appeal\nwould have been limited in scope, “allow[ing] us to provide immediate resolution to factually\nunique circumstances[.]” Pleasant View Baptist Church, 838 F. App’x at 942. Moreover,\nPlaintiffs’ appeal would now arguably be moot, in light of (1) the expiration of the priority\nperiod and (2) the SBA’s sworn testimony indicating that the RRF funds are not depleted and\nthat the government had set aside the full amount of money that Plaintiffs requested.

This request was extraordinary and would have had consequences reaching far beyond\nPlaintiffs’ quest to obtain RRFfunding for a single business. The majority properly declinedto\ngo that far. Witha favorable ruling to Plaintiffs,all eligible restaurant owners within the Sixth\nCircuit who had already filed applications under the program would have had to wait\nindefinitely, if not permanently,to learn if they would receive desperately neededmonetary aid.\nThese restaurant owners are not partiesto this case, and there was no need to subject them to\npotentially devastating consequences.5 After all, courts are arbiters of disputes, not disrupters of\nemergency relief efforts. The potential nationwide public harm that could have resulted\noverwhelmingly outweighs any relief that might have inured to Plaintiffs had we granted their\nclaim to freeze the RRFentirely.6 Forusto evenconsider grantingthat type of relief would have\nbeen irresponsible without “the careful deliberation that we would normally undertake in a\ntraditional meritscase.” PleasantView BaptistChurch,838 F.App’x at 942.\nIII.\nThis case also presents dense and delicate issues of constitutional law regardinghow\ncourtsshouldscrutinizerace-basedgovernmentaction. We shouldnotbeaddressingtheseissues\napplication. While that might be theoretically possible, it looks highly unlikely based on the SBA’s sworn\ndeclaration that, as of May 23,2021, the SBA had disbursed only approximately $11,345,177,844 of the total $28.6\nbillion that Congress appropriated for the RRF. (See Doc. 13 at 3). As we have explained, “[i]f after filing a\ncomplaint the claimant losesa personal stake inthe action,‘making it impossible for the court to grant any effectual\nrelief whatever,’ the case must be dismissed as moot.” Hrivnak v. NCO Portfolio Mgmt., Inc.,719 F.3d 564, 567\n(6th Cir.2013) (quoting Church of Scientology v.United States,506 U.S.9,12 (1992)). Here,the expiration of the\npriority period seems to “have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of [Plaintiffs’] alleged violation[s].”\nLosAngeles Cty.v.Davis,440U.S.625,631(1979).\n5Although notbriefed extensively by the parties,I note that even if there were merit to Plaintiffs’ claims,\nthe Supreme Court has clearly stated that an injunction “should be no more burdensome to the defendant than\nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.” Califano v. Yamaskai, 442 U.S.682, 702 (1979). Plaintiffs\nhave not indicated that any other parties will join this case or that Plaintiffs have attempted to raise any claims on\ntheir behalf, so I am not convinced that Plaintiffs even have standing to ask us to declare the entire RRF\nunconstitutional or otherwise halt the processing of RRFpayments. Nevertheless, I make my point above simply to\nunderscore the appropriateness of the emergency motionmechanism for suchrelief.\n6Thisconsideration obviously goestothe merits ofthe case,not just the propriety of addressing the issue\non anemergency motion,and,in any event,the majority limits injunctive relief toPlaintiffs’ claims only.\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page22of 30 PageID#: 310\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:21 (23of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 21\nona whim, particularly when the SupremeCourt hasinformed usthat the strict scrutiny analysis\nas to race-based classifications is not subject to a rigid formula. As Justice O’Connor statedin\nGrutter v. Bollinger, “[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under\nthe Equal ProtectionClause.” 539 U.S.306,327 (2003). “Not every decisioninfluencedby race\nis equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully\nexamining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental\ndecisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.” Id.(emphasis added); see also\nAdarand Constructors, Inc.v. Pena,515 U.S.200, 268 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Court’s\nvery recognitiontoday that strict scrutiny can be compatible with the survival of a classification\nso revieweddemonstrates that our concepts of equal protection enjoy a greater elasticity than the\nstandard categories might suggest.”); Croson, 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion)\n(“Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is\nsimply no way of determining what classifications are ‘benign’ or ‘remedial’ and what\nclassifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial\npolitics.”);EvanGerstmann& Christopher Shortell, The ManyFacesof Strict Scrutiny:Howthe\nSupreme Court Changes the Rules in Race Cases, 72 U.Pitt.L. Rev.1,34 (2010) (explaining\ndifferent levelsof “deferentialscrutiny” appliedby courts asto race-basedgovernment action).7\nHere, context matters. The statutory and regulatory provisions at issue are complex, and\nthe RRF is just one component of broad-based emergency legislation designed to fight business\nfallout that is uniquely and directly tied to the COVID-19 pandemic. Inthis sense, the RRF is\nnot so much traditional legislation inwhich the government has sought to encourage a long-term\nchange in public policy but rather a one-off monetary lifeline aimed at ameliorating short-term\neconomic devastation. That distinction is important, and it might call for a different kind of\ndeference to the legislature, even within the broader strict scrutiny framework. We must avoid\nhurried judicial decision-making under such circumstances.\n7I also note that althoughcourts havelargelyoperatedunder the frameworkthat strict scrutinyreview\nappliesto “allracialclassifications,”Adarand,515 U.S.200,227 (1995),even that notionhas been calledinto\nquestion. See,e.g.,Johnsonv.California,543U.S.499,516 (2005)(Ginsburg,J.,concurring)(opining“thatthe\nsamestandardofreviewoughtnottocontroljudicialinspectionof everyofficialraceclassification”);seealsoGratz\nv.Bollinger,539U.S.244,301(2003)(Ginsburg,J.,dissenting)(“Actionsdesignedto burdengroupslongdenied\nfull citizenship stature are not sensibly ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched\ndiscriminationanditsaftereffectshavebeenextirpated.”).\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page23of 30 PageID#: 311\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:22 (24of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 22\nIV.\nDespite my reservations as to whether we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal—and,\nmore generally, whether this kind of appeal warrants anything other than the narrowest of\ndispositions—I also conclude that Plaintiffs’ appeal would likely fail on the merits.\nPlaintiffs argue that the priority period amounts to impermissible race- and gender-based\ndiscrimination inviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. “[T]he government has the burden of\nproving that racial classifications ‘are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling\ngovernmental interests.’” Johnson, 543 U.S. at 505 (quoting Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227). The\ngovernment asserted “a compelling interest in remedying the effects of past and present\ndiscrimination that led to socially and economically disadvantaged business owners having less\naccess to capital and credit, including capital and credit provided through prior COVID relief\nefforts.” The government also argued that it “has a compelling interest in supporting small\nbusinesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged small business owners who have\nborne an outsized burden of the economic harms of [the]COVID-19 pandemic.”\nCongress heardsignificant testimony from restauranteurs, economists, experts in finance,\nand public interest advocates in the lead-up to the passage of the RRF. See Supporting Small\nand Minority-Owned Businesses Through the Pandemic (Feb. 4, 2021)\n(“Supporting”), available at https://www.congress.gov/117/chrg/CHRG-117hhrg43965/CHRG-\n117hhrg43965.pdf; Long-Lasting Solutions for a Small Business Recovery (July 15, 2020)\n(“Solutions”), available at https://www.congress.gov/116/chrg/CHRG-116hhrg41297/CHRG-\n116hhrg41297.pdf; Paycheck Protection Program: Loan Forgiveness & Other\nChallenges: Hearing Before the House Committee on Small Business (June 17, 2020)\n(“Challenges”), available at https://www.congress.gov/116/chrg/CHRG-116hhrg41293/CHRG-\n116hhrg41293.pdf.\nThose experts offered evidence showing that minority-owned businesses were more\nvulnerable to economic distress than businesses owned by white entrepreneurs—they were more\nlikely to operate in retail, accommodation, food services, and personal care services industries,\nwhich were hardest hit by government shut-down orders and a decrease in foot traffic.\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page24of 30 PageID#: 312\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:23 (25of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 23\nSupporting, at 61.

In doing so, the majority\noverstates and mischaracterizes Congress’ objectives in establishing the RRF. As the district\ncourt explained, the RRF was specifically targeted to provide aid to businesses who suffered\ndramatic losses because of the pandemic, not simply to provide aid in the abstract to certain\nminorities who have suffered past discrimination. The analysis does not change simply because\nsome of the factors that might have contributed to general historical discrimination of certain\nminorities overlap to some degree with Congress’ justifications for establishing the priority\nperiod.\nThe majority nevertheless contends that the priority period was overly broad in\nattempting to accomplish that purpose, because, in the majority’s view, Congress did not\neffectively consider possible race-neutral alternatives to the program. To that end, the majority\nsuggests that Congress could have “simply grant[ed] priority consideration to all small business\nowners who had not yet received coronavirus relief funds” or that Congress could have more\neffectively provided relief by “grant[ing] priority consideration to all business owners who were\nunable to obtain needed capital or credit during the pandemic.” (emphasis added).\nHowever, completely absent from the majority’s analysis on these points is that the\npriority period was created expressly because the PPP—a prior, race-neutral attempt to assist\nrestauranteurs—failedto reach minority business owners. Moreover, “[n]arrow tailoring does\nnot require exhaustionof every conceivable race-neutralalternative.” Grutter,539 U.S.at 339.\nLegislationisnotalwaysperfect,butimperfectiondoes notequateto unconstitutionality.\nThe majority’s suggested alternatives presuppose that Congress had ample time to think\nof all possible ways inwhich it could distribute relief to small business owners. Innormal times,\nthere may be some force to the majority’s position. But these are not normal times, and\nCongress deemed that it needed to act fast. The principal purpose of the RRF—and the ARA\nmore generally—was to flood the nation with cash in order to keep economic activity moving\nalong. The statute at issue here is benign and not restrictive, and when emergency legislation\nCase3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP Document37 Filed06/02/21 Page26of 30 PageID#: 314\n\nCase:21-5517 Document:22-2 Filed:05/27/2021 Page:25 (27of 30)\nNos.21-5517/5528 Vitolo,et al.v.Guzman Page 25\nmeets that standard, we must afford special deference to the legislature, which is far better\npositionedthan the Court to assesswhat isbest for the nationduringanemergency.9\nFurther, as the government argues, while the SBA presumes certain races of people\nqualify as “sociallyandeconomicallydisadvantaged,”that definitiondoes not preclude peopleof\nother races from qualifying as well—including white men like Vitolo. On the other hand,\nbecause the presumption is rebuttable, individuals who have not suffered the disadvantage\ntargetedby the RRFmayproperlybe excludedduringthe priorityperiod.\nFinally, the district court correctly noted that the twenty-one-day priority period was\nnarrow in scope: it “istime-limited, fund-limited, not absolutely constrainedby race” and “does\nnot meanindividualslike Vitolo cannot receivereliefunder this program.” Plaintiffshave not,at\nthis juncture, demonstrated that they are likely to succeed on their argument that the priority\nperiodfailsstrict scrutiny.\nV.\nPlaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed on the merits of their argument that the RRF’s\ngender-based priority is unconstitutional. Gender-based discrimination must serve “important\ngovernmental objectives” and “the discriminatory means employed [must be] substantially\nrelated to the achievement of those objectives.” United States v.

McDonough \nPlaintiffs, \nv.  Magistrate Judge Debra C. Poplin  \nISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN, \nDefendant. \nDEFENDANT’S OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nSection  5003  of  the  American  Rescue  Plan  Act  (“ARPA”)  created  the  Restaurant \nRevitalization Fund (“RRF”) to provide much-needed aid to one of the hardest-hit industries \nstruggling with the public health and economic crises stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.  In \nenacting Section 5003, Congress provided for a twenty-one day “priority period,” during which the \nSmall Business Administration (“SBA”) would prioritize applications from businesses owned or \ncontrolled by women, veterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Plaintiffs \nseek to enjoin the SBA from implementing that priority period because it offers applicants priority \nbased on gender and (in some, but not all cases) race.  But not all race- and gender-conscious programs \nare  inherently  unconstitutional.    Rather,  race-conscious  programs  must  serve  a  compelling \ngovernment interest and be narrowly-tailored to further that interest, and gender-conscious programs \nmust further an important government interest by means substantially related to that interest.  As this \nCourt already determined in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, the RRF \npriority period meets those standards.  See Mem. Op. at 20-21, 28, ECF No. 24.  Plaintiffs have not \nadvanced any new information that would call this conclusion into question, and therefore the Court \nshould also deny Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.   \n1 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 1 of 15   PageID #: 226\n\nBACKGROUND \nThe facts underlying this action are set out in detail in Defendant’s Opposition to Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Temporary Restraining Order, and in this Court’s opinion denying Plaintiffs’ motion.  See \nDefs.’ Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for Temporary Restraining Order at 2-8 (“Defs.’ Opp.”), ECF No. 18; Mem. \nOp. at 1-7.   \nOn May 20, 2021, this Court issued a text order directing Defendant to respond to Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for preliminary injunction by May 21, 2021.  See Text Order, ECF No. 29.  Plaintiffs filed only \none brief in support of both their motion for a temporary restraining order and their motion for a \npreliminary injunction.  See Pls.’ Mem. in Support of Mot. for Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction (“Pls.’ Mem.”, ECF No. 12-2).  Defendant filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a temporary restraining order and requested that “in the event the Court grant[ed] the \nTRO,” Defendant be allowed an opportunity to submit supplemental briefing in response to the \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  Defs.’ Opp. at 8 n.4.   \nBecause Plaintiffs have not yet responded to Defendant’s opposition or this Court’s opinion \ndenying the temporary restraining order, much of Defendant’s prior briefing remains relevant and \nresponsive to Plaintiffs’ motion.  Thus, Defendant continues to stand on its initial briefing before this \nCourt, which demonstrates that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim, and thus \nnot entitled to injunctive relief.  See generally Defs.’ Opp.; see also Mem. Op. at 20-21, 28.  In this \nsupplemental brief, Defendant primarily responds to issues raised in the TRO hearing, in the Court’s \nopinion, and in Plaintiffs’ post-hearing filings.1  Defendant also addresses standing and the scope of \nthe relief requested at the preliminary injunction stage.   \n                                                           \n1    Defendant recognizes that because of the expedited schedule in this case, Plaintiffs have not \nyet had the opportunity to respond in writing to the arguments raised in Defendant’s brief or to this \nCourt’s opinion denying the TRO motion.  Plaintiffs have requested that the Court provide “a short \nperiod for Plaintiffs to file a reply” in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.  See Pls.’ \nResponse Regarding Pending Preliminary Injunction Mot. at 1 (“Pls.’ Response”), ECF No. 28.  \nDefendant respectfully requests that, to the extent Plaintiffs are permitted to file a reply, and to the \nextent that reply raises new arguments beyond those included in its initial brief, Defendant be \npermitted to respond to those arguments in a short supplemental brief.   \n2 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 2 of 15   PageID #: 227\n\nLEGAL STANDARD \nIn determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the court considers “(1) whether the \nmovant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant would suffer \nirreparable injury absent the injunction; (3) whether the injunction would cause substantial harm to \nothers; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by the issuance of an injunction.”  Am. \nCivil Liberties Union Fund of Mich. v. Livingston Cty., 796 F.3d 636, 642 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Bays v. \nCity of Fairborn, 668 F.3d 814, 818-19 (6th Cir. 2012)).  A preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary \nand drastic” remedy, “never awarded as of right.”  Id. (quoting Platt v. Bd. of Comm’rs on Grievances & \nDiscipline of Ohio Supreme Ct., 769 F.3d 447, 453 (6th Cir. 2014)).  Accordingly, “[t]he party seeking a \npreliminary injunction bears the burden of justifying such relief.”  Id. (quoting McNeilly v. Land, 684 \nF.3d 611, 615 (6th Cir. 2012)).   \nARGUMENT  \nI.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown That They Are Likely To Succeed On The Merits Of Their \nClaim.    \nIn order to prevail on a motion for preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that \nthey are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim.  Plaintiffs have not made that showing here.  As \nan initial matter, Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the race-conscious presumption regarding \n“socially and economically disadvantaged” individuals because Plaintiffs acknowledge that Vitolo is \nnot socially disadvantaged even under the race-neutral statutory definition of that term.  See Mem. Op. \nat 6 n.1.  Further, in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, this Court \ndetermined that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their equal-\nprotection claims, and thus that injunctive relief was not appropriate.  See Mem. Op. at 29.  Nothing \n                                                           \nPlaintiffs also requested that this Court “rule on the preliminary injunction motion on the \nmerits, without another hearing.”  See Pls.’ Response at 1.  Defendant takes no position on whether a \nhearing is necessary, and Defendant stands ready to participate in a hearing to the extent it would be \nbeneficial to the Court.  However, Defendant believes that an opportunity to respond to any reply \nbrief would be particularly beneficial in the event that the Court declines to hold a hearing because \notherwise Defendant will not have any opportunity to respond to new arguments that might be raised \nin Plaintiffs’ brief. \n3 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 3 of 15   PageID #: 228\n\nhas changed since the Court entered its order that would disturb that conclusion.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim.  \nA.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Challenge Section 5003’s Prioritization of “Socially and \nEconomically Disadvantaged” Individuals.  \nWhether plaintiffs have standing to sue is a threshold jurisdictional question.  See Steel Co. v. \nCitizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998); Mason v. Adams Cnty. Recorder, 901 F.3d 753, 756 (6th \nCir. 2018).  Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution limits federal judicial power to cases and \ncontroversies. See Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 102.  The doctrine of standing is “an essential and unchanging \npart of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.”  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n560 (1992).  Strict enforcement of standing requirements is particularly important where, as here, a \ncourt is asked to rule on the constitutionality of action by the executive and legislative branches.  See \nValley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473-74 (1982). \nIt is well-settled that the “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” contains three \nrequirements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact; (2) that is fairly traceable to the \nchallenged conduct of the defendant; and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial \ndecision.  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  The plaintiff \nbears the burden of establishing these elements.  Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1547. At the pleading stage, the \nplaintiff must “clearly . . . allege facts demonstrating” each element.  Id. at 1547.    \nPlaintiff Vitolo asserts he is injured because his application cannot be processed during the \npriority period required by Section 5003.  But Plaintiff fails to allege that his injury is traceable to the \nrace-conscious presumption in the SBA regulations or that elimination of the presumption would \nredress his injuries.  That is because, regardless of the race-conscious presumption at issue in this case, \nPlaintiff has not alleged that he is otherwise socially disadvantaged.  And as this Court explained in its \nrecent opinion, “[e]ven if the regulatory presumption were removed, Vitolo apparently has no \nargument that he is entitled to priority consideration under the plain text of” Section 5003.  Mem. Op. \nat 6 n.1.    \n4 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 4 of 15   PageID #: 229\n\nThe Sixth Circuit, and numerous other circuits, have held that discrimination cannot be the \ncause of injury to a plaintiff who would not have obtained the desired benefit even in the absence of \ndiscrimination.  See Stefanovic v. Univ. of Tenn., 173 F.3d 856, 1999 WL 196570, at *4 (6th Cir. 1999) \n(affirming dismissal of equal protection claim for lack of standing where the plaintiff failed to \ndemonstrate a direct relationship between the existence of a gender-conscious program and the \ndecision not to hire him because the university had separate, nondiscriminatory reasons for not hiring \nhim); see also Wilson v. Glenwood Intermountain Props., Inc., 98 F.3d 590 (10th Cir. 1996) (plaintiffs lacked \nstanding to challenge rental of gender-segregated student apartments because as non-students they \nwould not have qualified to rent the student apartments even absent the alleged discrimination); \nDonaghy v. City of Omaha, 933 F.2d 1448, 1455 (8th Cir. 1991) (white applicant for promotion to police \nlieutenant had standing to challenge promotion of minority officers out of rank only after he would \nhave ranked high enough to be considered for promotion if strict rank order had been followed); \nDoherty v. Rutgers Sch. of Law-Newark, 651 F.2d 893, 899-902 (3d Cir. 1981) (unsuccessful white applicant \nfor admission to law school lacked standing to challenge minority admissions program because he was \nnot qualified for admission even in the absence of the minority admissions program).  In those \ncircumstances, “[t]he discrimination does not deprive the person of the ability to compete because he \nor she is disqualified from competing for other, legitimate reasons.”  Wilson, 98 F.3d at 593.  And “[a] \nfavorable decision on the discrimination claim could not redress the injury because the person would \nstill be disqualified from competing.”  Id.   \nPlaintiff Vitolo alleges that he is “not a member of any racial or ethnic groups identified in 13 \nC.F.R.  §  124.103  or  any  other  group  identified  by  Defendant  as  [presumptively]  ‘socially \ndisadvantaged’ or ‘economically disadvantaged.’”  Compl. ¶ 17. Plaintiff Vitolo does not allege that he \nis otherwise socially disadvantaged as defined by the statute.  Thus, Plaintiff fails to allege, much less \nestablish,  that,  even in  the  absence  of  the  race-based  presumption,  he qualifies  as  a  “socially \ndisadvantaged” individual.  Plaintiff therefore lacks standing to challenge the race-based presumption.  \nPlaintiff likewise fails to establish that his alleged injury would be redressed by the relief he seeks.  \nWhile Plaintiff seeks an order requiring SBA to “process applications for grants from the Restaurant \n5 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 5 of 15   PageID #: 230\n\nRevitalization Fund in the order that they were received, without regard to the race or gender of the \napplicant,” Pls.’ Mot., ECF No. 11, he fails to establish that he would qualify for prioritization even \nin the absence of a racially-conscious presumption (and thus even if applications were processed \n“without regard to the race . . . of the applicant\").   \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs have not established standing for purposes of their race-based equal-\nprotection claim, and thus are unlikely to succeed on the merits of that claim.    \nB.  The  Priority  Period  for  Businesses  Owned  by  “Socially  and  Economically \nDisadvantaged” Individuals Is Constitutional.  \nPlaintiffs contend that Section 5003 is unconstitutional because the definition of “socially \ndisadvantaged individual” used by the SBA in administering the Restaurant Revitalization Fund \nincludes a race-conscious presumption, but “[w]hen race-based action is necessary to further a \ncompelling governmental interest, such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal \nprotection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.”  Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. \n306, 326 (2003).  Here, the Court has already found that the government has advanced a compelling \ngovernment interest and shown a strong basis in evidence supporting its conclusion that race-\nconscious remedial action was necessary.  Mem. Op. at 19-20.  And to date, Plaintiff has not offered \nany rebuttal of this initial showing of a compelling interest.  Id. at 20.  \n1.  As this court has already recognized, the priority period advances a compelling \ngovernmental interest and there is a strong basis in evidence supporting the \nconclusion that remedial action was necessary.   \nPlaintiffs’ primary argument is that the priority period cannot be justified by reference to \nsystemic or societal discrimination.  See Pls.’ Mem. at 13; see also Pls.’ Emergency Mot. for an Injunction \nPending Appeal at 3, ECF No. 23 (“Pls.’ Emergency Mot.”).  But, as this Court recently found, \nCongress did not rely solely on allegations of broad societal or structural racism in enacting Section \n5003.  Rather, it relied on specific evidence that (1) “small businesses owned by minorities (including \nrestaurants, which have a disproportionately high rate of minority ownership) have suffered more \nseverely  than  other  kinds  of  businesses  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,”  and  (2)  “that  the \nGovernment’s early attempts at general economic stimulus—i.e., the Paycheck Protection Program \n6 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 6 of 15   PageID #: 231\n\n(“PPP”)—disproportionately  failed  to  help  those  businesses  directly  because  of  historical \ndiscrimination patterns.”  Mem. Op. at 14-15.  Upon consideration of that evidence, Congress \ndetermined that it could not be a “passive participant” in the lending industry’s discriminatory \npractices or otherwise allow public funding to “‘serve to finance the evil of private prejudice.’” \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabnik, 214 F.3d 730, 735 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting City of \nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 486-92 (1989)). \nAs this Court recognized in denying Plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, \nDefendant has already provided ample evidence to support its “compelling interest in remediating the \npresent effects of historical discrimination on these minority-owned businesses, especially to the \nextent that the PPP disproportionately failed those businesses because of factors clearly related to that \nhistory.”  Mem. Op. at 20; see Defs.’ Opp. at 13-17 (discussing evidence before Congress).   \nAnd there is even more evidence that demonstrates that throughout 2020 and into 2021, \nCongress was preoccupied with understanding and resolving this lack of access to PPP loans.  For \nexample, on July 9, 2020, the House Committee on Financial Services’ Subcommittee on Diversity \nand Inclusion held a hearing addressing challenges faced by women and minority-owned businesses \nin attempting to access capital and financial services during the pandemic.  See Access Denied: Challenges \nfor Women- and Minority-Owned Businesses Accessing Capital and Financial Services During the Pandemic: Virtual \nHearing Before the H. Subcomm. on Diversity & Inclusion of the Comm. on Fin. Servs., 116th Cong. (2020) \n(“Access Denied Hearing”).  The subcommittee’s chairwoman, Representative Joyce Beatty, opened \nthe hearing by addressing the struggles that women- and minority-owned businesses face during the \npandemic, and she expressly called out an analysis that found that “only 1 in 10 African-American and \nLatinx-owned businesses received the requested funds” through the first round of PPP funding.  See \nid. at 2.  At the same hearing, the President and CEO of the U.S. Black Chambers, Incorporated, \ntestified that SBA and Treasury records showed that of more than 650,000 PPP loans of amounts \nabove $150,000, only 143 loans went to Black-owned businesses.  Id. at 6 (statement of Ron Busby, \nSr., Pres. & CEO, U.S. Black Chambers, Inc.).  He further testified that 90 percent of his organization’s \nmembers “reported that they have found far less of what they asked for, or none at all.”  Id.  Another \n7 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 7 of 15   PageID #: 232\n\nwitness testified that “[w]hile the bipartisan CARES Act got money out the door quickly and helped \nmany small businesses, the distribution channels of the first tranche of the funding underscored how \nthe  traditional  financial  system  leaves  many  small  businesses  behind,  particularly  women-  and \nminority-owned businesses.”  Id. at 9 (statement of Karen Kerrigan, Pres. & CEO, SBE Council).   \nAfter listening to witness testimony, one Congressman remarked that the hearing had “shined \na light on” something the committee already knew, “which is that the PPP program is not perfect” \nand “it just didn’t hit our minority communities in a way that maybe we would want.”  Id. at 22 \n(question from Rep. Gonzalez).  Thus, he explained that as Congress goes forward, “retooling it or \nhaving a different program probably makes the most sense frankly.”  Id.  Another representative \nexplained that “[w]hile this crisis is unprecedented, the disparities revealed in our economic system \nand subsequent Federal response are unfortunately very familiar,” by which she meant that “Black \nAmericans have historically been locked out of large-scale government intervention and investment” \nand that Congress “must not repeat exclusionary policies of past Federal responses.”  Id. at 26 \n(question from Rep. Pressley).  She also noted that “[f]rom the onset, experts estimated that up to 95 \npercent of Black women business owners would be left out of the [PPP].”  Id. at 27.   \nCongress also heard testimony that these disparities in access to capital and credit are due not \njust to system or societal discrimination, but discrimination in the lending industry.  For example, in \nthe July 9, 2020 hearing, one witness testified that “closed financial networks” and “longstanding \ninstitutional biases . . . work against the efforts of women and minority entrepreneurs who need capital \nto start up, operate, and grow their businesses.”  Access Denied Hearing at 9 (statement of Karen \nKerrigan, Pres. & CEO, SBE Council).  Her written statement further explained that “[m]inority and \nwomen-owned business owners who lack relationships with banks or other financial institutions \nparticipating in PPP lacked early access to the program.”  Id. at 78.  On February 24, 2021, the House \nCommittee on Financial Services’ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation held a hearing \nentitled “How Invidious Discrimination Hurts: An Examination of Lending Discrimination and Its \nLong-Term Economic Impacts on Borrowers of Color,” which focused on “examin[ing] invidious \ndiscrimination, its modern manifestations, and its lasting intergenerational effects.”  Memo. from Fin. \n8 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 8 of 15   PageID #: 233\n\nServs.  Comm.  Majority  Staff  to  Members,  Comm.  on  Fin.  Servs.  (Feb.  19,  2021), \nhttps://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/111236/documents/HHRG-117-BA09-20210224-\nSD002-U1.pdf.  Witnesses at the hearing were tasked with “address[ing] barriers to asset building, \nincluding current and previous public policies and implicit and explicit discrimination.”  Id.  That \nhearing included testimony from an analyst at the Congressional Research Service, who identified \n“[r]acial, ethic, or other disparities” in access to financial services and stated that “[o]ne factor \ninfluencing these disparities is likely the intergenerational effects of discrimination.”  Cheryl Cooper, \nHow Invidious Discrimination Works and Hurts: An Examination of Lending Discrimination and Its Long-Term \nEconomic  Impacts  on  Borrowers  of  Color,  Cong.  Res.  Serv.  (Feb  24,  2021), \nhttps://www.congress.gov/117/meeting/house/111236/witnesses/HHRG-117-BA09-Wstate-\nCooperC-20210224.pdf; see also id. at 3 (noting that “discrimination, such as violations in fair lending \nlaws, can also prevent consumers from accessing financial services”).   \nAgain,  this  testimony  supports  the  conclusion  that  many  socially  and  economically \ndisadvantaged individuals lack ongoing relationships with banks and financial services because of racial \nand ethnic discrimination—and, as explained above, that lack of relationships led to their being shut \nout of early rounds of COVID relief.   \n2.  To date, Plaintiffs have made no effort to rebut Defendant’s initial showing of \na compelling interest.   \nOnce the government makes an initial showing of compelling interest, the burden shifts to the \nplaintiff to present “credible, particularized evidence” to rebut the government’s “initial showing of a \ncompelling interest.”  Concrete Works of Colo., Inc. v. City and Cnty. of Denver, 321 F.3d 950, 959 (10th Cir. \n2003)); see also Aiken v. City of Memphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1163 (6th Cir. 1994) (relying on statistical evidence \nof disparities to infer discrimination and thus compelling interest where “plaintiffs have not offered \nany evidence to rebut the inference of discrimination that arises from the[] statistics”).  Plaintiffs have \npresented no such evidence.  At the TRO hearing, when asked directly about the government’s \nevidence that minority- and women-owned businesses were unable to access PPP funds because of \nthe present effects of historical discrimination in the lending industry, Plaintiffs resorted to their same \n9 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 9 of 15   PageID #: 234\n\narguments that mere disparities in outcome and allegations of societal discrimination could not \nsupport  a  race-conscious  program.2    See  also  Pls.’  Emergency  Mot.  at  2-3  (raising  these  same \narguments).  But as this Court has already recognized, it is simply untrue that the government is relying \nsolely on disparate impact—rather, the record demonstrates that “Congress . . . heard evidence that \nracial bias plays a direct role in these disparities.”  Mem. Op. at 19.  And, as explained above, Congress \nsought to remedy more than just societal discrimination; instead, it sought to remedy the specific \nlegacy of historical discrimination in the financial services industry that prevented prior federal \nCOVID relief efforts from reaching the particular types of small business owners targeted by the \npriority period for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.  Because Plaintiffs have not put forth any \ncredible, particularized evidence to rebut the government’s showing of a compelling interest, they have \nnot demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, and their motion for preliminary injunction \nshould be denied.   \n3.  As this Court has already recognized, the priority period is narrowly tailored to \nachieve this compelling government interest.   \n“When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest,” as it is \nhere, “such action does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection so long as the \nnarrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.”  Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326 (2003).  In this \ncase, Defendant has demonstrated that “the means chosen to accomplish the [government’s] asserted \npurpose”—namely, the inclusion of a priority period for socially and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals—is “specifically and narrowly framed to accomplish that purpose.”  Id. at 333.  As this \nCourt found in denying the TRO motion, the priority period at issue in this case meets that criteria.  \nSee Mem. Op. at 20-23 (discussing narrow tailoring).   \nAt the TRO hearing and in a subsequent motion before this Court, Plaintiffs argued that the \npriority period is not narrowly tailored because the government failed to consider race-neutral \n                                                           \n2  At the TRO hearing, Plaintiffs’ counsel also argued that the government’s evidence was too general \nand that the government failed to consider race-neutral alternatives, but those arguments go to narrow \ntailoring rather than the existence of a compelling government interest.  See pages 10-12 (discussing \nnarrow tailoring).    \n10 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 10 of 15   PageID #: 235\n\nalternatives.  Pls.’ Emergency Mot. at 3.  In particular, Plaintiffs questioned why the government did \nnot instead create a priority “for those who had not participated in earlier relief programs or who are \nin a weaker financial position” rather than a priority for socially and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals.  Id.  But simply proposing certain race-neutral alternatives does not demonstrate that a \nrace-conscious scheme is not narrowly tailored.  The Supreme Court is clear that “[n]arrow tailoring \ndoes not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-neutral alternative,” but only “serious, good \nfaith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.”  Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339.  In this case, the \ngovernment not only considered race-neutral alternatives—it actually implemented them.  And it was \nprecisely the gaps left by those race-neutral programs that led the government to conclude that a \npriority period was necessary.  See Mem. Op. at 22.  Moreover, Section 5003 does contain limitations \nbased on prior access to federal relief—it provides that “the pandemic-related revenue losses for an \neligible entity” (i.e., the grant amount that the entity may claim from the RRF) “shall be reduced by \nany amounts received from” the Paycheck Protection Program in 2020 or 2021.  American Rescue \nPlan Act § 5003(a)(7), Pub. L. No. 117-2 (2021) (“ARPA”); see also Cross-program eligibility on SBA \nCOVID-19  relief  options,  U.S.  Small  Bus.  Admin.,  https://www.sba.gov/funding-\nprograms/loans/covid-19-relief-options/cross-program-eligibility-sba-covid-19-relief-options.  And \nSection 5003 expressly excludes any business that “has a pending application for or has received a \ngrant under section 324 of the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues \nAct,” which provided grants for “shuttered venue operators.”  ARPA § 5003(a)(4)(C)(III).  These \nrequirements do not go to priority, but rather to overall eligibility and the extent of aid available.  They \nensure that small businesses that were able to access prior COVID relief do not receive a windfall, \nregardless of whether they are owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.   \nAs the Court explained, the priority period is “time-limited, fund-limited, not absolutely \nconstrained by race during the priority period, and not absolutely constrained to the priority period.”  \nMem. Op. at 21; see also Defs.’ Opp. at 17-21 (explaining how priority period is narrowly tailored to \nachieve compelling interest).  It is neither overinclusive nor underinclusive (Mem. Op. at 22-23), and \nPlaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary rest on a misunderstanding of the race-conscious presumption that \n11 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 11 of 15   PageID #: 236\n\ncertain individuals are socially and economically disadvantaged.  “[T]he race-based presumption is just \nthat: a presumption,” and individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged for reasons \nother than their racial identity are still included in the priority period.  Mem. Op. at 22.   \nC.  The Priority Period for Women-Owned Businesses Is Constitutional.  \nPlaintiffs also argue that Section 5003 is unconstitutional because it includes a priority period \nfor women-owned businesses.  See Pls.’ Mem. at 11.  But of course, the mere fact that a statute takes \ngender into account does not render it unconstitutional.  Rather, such classifications are permissible \ninsofar as they “serve an important governmental objective” and are “substantially related to the \nachievement of those objectives.”  Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976).  As this Court has already \nrecognized in denying the TRO, Section 5003 meets this standard.  \n1.  As this Court has already recognized, the priority period for women-owned \nbusinesses serves an important governmental objective.  \nIt is well-established that “[r]eduction of the disparity in economic condition between men \nand women caused by the long history of discrimination against women” can serve as an important \ngovernmental interest.  Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313, 317 (1977).  Plaintiffs have taken the position \nthat a mere disparity in economic condition or access to funding is insufficient to establish an \nimportant governmental interest.  But that is not all that exists here.  Rather, the Court has already \nfound  that  “Congress  had  before  it  evidence  showing  that  women-owned  businesses  suffered \nhistorical discrimination that exposed them to greater risks from an economic shock like COVID-19, \nand that they received less benefit from earlier COVID-19 relief programs” and thus concluded that \nthere is “an important governmental interest in protecting women-owned businesses from the \ndisproportionately adverse effects of the pandemic and failure of earlier federal relief programs.”   \nMem. Op. at 26-27.  Again, Plaintiffs have offered nothing to rebut that conclusion, and the Court’s \nanalysis should stand.   \n2.  The priority period is substantially related to the achievement of that objective.   \nBecause prioritizing women-owned businesses serves an important governmental interest, it \nis constitutional so long as it is substantially related to the achievement of that objective.  Plaintiffs \n12 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 12 of 15   PageID #: 237\n\noffer no real argument on this point.  First, they contend that “Defendant cannot successfully argue \nthat a neutral process would somehow disadvantage women,” Pls.’ Mem. at 14, but there is indeed \nevidence that in the past, neutral processes have disadvantaged women.  See Mem. Op. at 26-28.  Next, \nthey argue that the government cannot show that “a targeted 21-day ‘priority period’ is the only way to \nlevel the playing field.”  Pls.’ Mem at 14 (emphasis added).  But there is no requirement that a gender-\nbased classification be “the only way” to achieve the government’s interest.  Indeed, that is not even \nthe standard for racial classifications subject to strict scrutiny.  See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339 (explaining \nthat narrow tailoring under strict scrutiny “does not require exhaustion of every conceivable race-\nneutral alternative”).  Plaintiffs offer no authority for their claim that such a requirement exists under \nintermediate scrutiny.   \nThis Court is correct that “[t]he prioritization of women-owned businesses under § 5003 is \nsubstantially related to the problem Congress sought to remedy because it is directly aimed at \nameliorating the funding gap between women-owned and man-owned businesses that has caused the \nformer to suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic at disproportionately higher rates.”  Mem. Op. at 28.  \nAs such, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claim and the preliminary injunction \nshould be denied.   \nII.  The  Remaining  Preliminary  Injunction  Factors  Weigh  Against  A  Preliminary \nInjunction.    \nBoth parties agree that “[w]hen a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the basis of a potential \nconstitutional violation, ‘the likelihood of success on the merits often will be the determinative factor.”  \nObama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Jones v. Caruso, 569 F.3d 258, 265 \n(6th Cir. 2009)).  If there is no constitutional violation, then there is no legally impermissible harm to \nthe plaintiffs, third parties, or the public interest.  See Mem. Op. at 28-29.  That is exactly the case here.  \nId.  Because Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their constitutional rights are being violated, they \nhave not shown that an injunction is needed to halt that violation.  Cf. Obama for Am., 697 F.3d at 436 \n(“When constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, irreparable injury is presumed”); Deja Vu of \nNashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., Tenn., 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. 2001) (“[I]t \n13 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 13 of 15   PageID #: 238\n\nis always in the public interest to prevent violation of a party’s constitutional rights.”).  To hold \notherwise would be to allow a plaintiff to obtain a preliminary injunction merely by alleging a \nconstitutional violation, regardless of the strength of those allegations.   \nAnd the stakes here are high.  The Restaurant Revitalization Fund is aimed at providing grants \nto some of the hardest-hit members of a struggling industry in the midst of an ongoing public health \nand economic crisis.  See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 117-7, at 2 (2021) (explaining that “eight out of ten \nminority-owned businesses are on the brink of closure”); id. at 457 (discussing struggles faced by small \nbusinesses, including restaurants).  Plaintiffs insist that under their proposed injunction, “no one will \nbe injured” because “all applicants, regardless of race and gender, will be treated equally.”  Pls.’ Mem. \nat 20.  But that argument presupposes that the priority period is unconstitutional.  Id.  Because the \npriority period is constitutional, Plaintiffs’ proposed injunction would eliminate the priority period \naimed at remedying the disparities created by prior race-neutral COVID relief programs—thus \nperpetuating the very problems that the priority period seeks to solve.   \nIII.  Any Injunctive Relief Should Be Tailored To The Injury Plaintiffs Have Alleged.  \nFor the foregoing reasons (as well as those set out in Defendant’s prior briefing), the Court \nshould not grant a preliminary injunction in this case.  But even if the Court were inclined to grant a \npreliminary injunction, it should not grant the broad relief requested by Plaintiffs.  Article III requires \nthat injunctive relief “must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury.”  Gill v. Whitford, 138 \nS. Ct. 1916, 1934 (2018).  Equitable principles likewise require that an injunction be “no more \nburdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.”  Madsen v. \nWhole Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994).  The injunctive relief that plaintiffs seek flouts \nthese  principles.    Plaintiffs  ask  for  a  preliminary  injunction  “requiring  Defendant  to  process \napplications for grants from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund in the order they were received, \nwithout regard to the race of gender of the applicant,” Pls.’ Mot. for Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. \n11; Pls.’ Mem. at 21, but that remedy bears no relation to the injuries plaintiffs claim.  Plaintiffs allege \nharm from the possibility that they will not be able to obtain the RRF grant money they requested \n14 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 30   Filed 05/21/21   Page 14 of 15   PageID #: 239\n\nbecause the funds might run out before the SBA processes their application.  That harm could be fully \naddressed without depriving other restauranteurs of critically-needed funds by requiring SBA to set \naside the amount that plaintiffs requested ($104,590.20), and to hold those funds until the termination \nof this litigation.   \nPlaintiffs give no indication why broader relief is necessary, and the Court should deny their \nrequest for overbroad injunctive relief, and indeed any injunctive relief whatsoever.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction should be denied.   \n \n   \nDated: May 21, 2021  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  BRIAN M.

Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 19 (1958). The government may not frustrate this \nprinciple of equality by making “distinctions between individuals based solely on \ndifferences  that  are  irrelevant  to  a  legitimate  governmental  objective.”  Lehr  v. \nRobertson, 463 U.S. 248, 265 (1983). Whether it be discrimination based on race or \ngender, “unreasonable discrimination” by the government is never permitted. Bolling \nv. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499 (1954).  \n2.  In March 2021, the United States pushed aside equality under the law \nby enacting a grant program that gives special treatment based on race and gender. \n1 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 1 of 10   PageID #: 273\n\nUnder Section 5003 of the American Rescue Plan (ARPA), Congress appropriated \n$28.6 billion to create the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to be administered by \nDefendant, who runs the Small Business Administration (SBA). This fund provides \nrelief for restaurants impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the terms of the \nlaw, however, Defendant must administer the fund in a discriminatory manner. For \nthe first 21 days, which started May 3, 2021, Defendant is obligated to “prioritize \nawarding grants” to restaurants owned by certain minorities and women.  \n3.  To implement this discriminatory mandate, Defendant adopted a first-\ncome, first-serve queue to process grant requests until the money runs out, but has \nthen re-sorted applicants within the queue based on their race and gender, putting \nwhite  male  restaurant  owners  behind  certain  minority  and  female  applicants, \nregardless of when they filed an application. Given the limited pot of funds, this puts \nwhite male applicants at significant risk that, by the time their applications are \nprocessed, and grants awarded, the money will be gone.  \n4.  Defendant has no justification for granting these priorities based on race \nand gender. Therefore, the priority program should be declared unconstitutional and \nenjoined.   \nTHE PARTIES \n5.  Antonio Vitolo is a white male who owns a Jake’s Bar and Grill, LLC, a \nTennessee limited liability company, with its principal place of business in Harriman, \nRoane County, Tennessee. His wife is Hispanic and, by operation of state law, she \nowns  50%  of  the  business.  Vitolo  applied  for  a  grant  from  the  Restaurant \n2 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 2 of 10   PageID #: 274\n\nRevitalization Fund on May 3, 2021, but he was denied a priority preference based \non his race and gender.  \n6.  Byron Sackett is a white male who owns a catering/concessions company \ncalled Homesteads Management, LLC, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Sackett applied \nfor a grant from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund on May 3, 2021, but he was \ndenied a priority preference based on his race and gender. \n7.  Kevin Pearson is a white male who owns S & K Soup Co., doing business \nas Zoup! in Mishawaka, Indiana. Pearson applied for a grant from the Restaurant \nRevitalization Fund on May 3, 2021, but he was denied a priority preference based \non his race and gender. \n8.  Alfred Castiglioni owns The 579 LLC, Chardonnays Inc., and Zinfandel \nLLC, doing business as 579 Benefit Street Restaurant in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, \nChardonnay’s Restaurant in Seekonk, Massachusetts, and Meritage Restaurant in \nEast Greenwich, Rhode Island. Castiglioni applied for a grant from the Restaurant \nRevitalization Fund on May 3, 2021, but he was denied a priority preference based \non his race and gender. \n9.  Denis Flanagan is a member of 3kad LLC, which does business as \nDraught 55 in New York City, New York. Mr. Flanagan and the other members of \n3kad LLC are white males, with the sole exception of his wife, who is female. 3kad \nLLC, through its members, applied for a grant from the Restaurant Revitalization \nFund on May 3, 2021, but the company was denied priority consideration because its \nmembers were white males. \n3 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 3 of 10   PageID #: 275\n\n10.  Defendant  Isabella  Casillas  Guzman  is  the  Administrator  of  SBA. \nUnder Section 5003 of ARPA, Defendant Guzman is responsible for administering \nthe  Restaurant  Revitalization  Fund.  She  is  sued  in  her  official  capacity  for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n§ 2201, and 5 U.S.C. § 702, because this case presents a substantial question of federal \nlaw, specifically whether Section 5003 of ARPA—and Defendant’s implementation of \nthat section—violates the United States Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection \nof the laws.  \n12.  This Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order \ninjunctive relief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2201 and 2202. \n13.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). A \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district, a \nsubstantial part of the property subject to this action is situated in this district, and \na plaintiff resides in this district. \nSTATEMENT OF CLAIM \n14.  On March 11, 2021, the President of the United States signed ARPA into \nlaw. \n15.  Through Section 5003 of ARPA, Congress appropriated $28.6 billion for \nthe Restaurant Revitalization Fund, to be administered by Defendant, who is the \n4 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 4 of 10   PageID #: 276\n\nAdministrator of SBA. ARPA provides that the “Administer shall use amounts in the \nFund  to  make  grants”  to  restaurants  that  require  grant  support  due  to  “the \nuncertainty of current economic conditions.” \n16.  Section 5003(c)(3) of ARPA provides a priority to certain applicants: \n“During the initial 21-day period in which the Administrator awards grants under \nthis subsection, the Administrator shall prioritize awarding grants to eligible entities \nthat are small business concerns owned and controlled by women, [veterans], or \nsocially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns.”  \n17.  ARPA incorporates another federal law called the Small Business Act, \nwhich provides that “[s]ocially disadvantaged individuals are those who have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a \nmember  of  a  group  without  regard  to  their  individual  qualities.”  15  U.S.C. \n§ 637(a)(4)(A).  \n18.  SBA regulations further define “socially disadvantaged individuals” and \n“economically disadvantaged individuals” as those individuals who belong to certain \nracial groups. 13 C.F.R. §§ 124.103, .104. Individuals in the following groups are \nautomatically  granted  priority  status:  “Black  Americans;  Hispanic  Americans; \nNative Americans (including Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians); Asian Pacific \nAmericans; or Subcontinent Asian Americans.” \n19.  Plaintiffs  are  not  a  member  of  any  of  the  racial  or  ethnic  groups \nidentified in 13 C.F.R. § 124.103 or any other group identified by Defendant as \n“socially disadvantaged” or “economically disadvantaged.” \n5 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 5 of 10   PageID #: 277\n\n20.  Plaintiffs are eligible for a grant under the Restaurant Revitalization \nFund, except they are not eligible for priority consideration because their owners are \nwhite males. \n21.  On April 30, 2021, SBA sent out an email to restaurants detailing to \nprocess for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. The email included the following \ninformation: “All businesses can and should apply on Monday. Due to limited funds \nand  the  first-come,  first-served  basis,  the  earliest  possible  submission  of  your \napplication is the best way to maximize your chance of receiving the grant. The law \nmandates a 21-day priority window for businesses owned and controlled by women, \nveterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The SBA has \nindicated it will fund those applications first, as required.” \n22.  On May 3, 2021, Plaintiffs applied for a grant under the Restaurant \nRevitalization  Fund  at  restaurant.sba.gov.  During  the  application  process,  SBA \nnotified Plaintiffs that “SBA will accept applications from all eligible applicants, but \nonly  process  and  fund  priority  group  applications.”  The  website  continued  that \npriority applicants include businesses owned by “women, veterans, or socially and \neconomically  disadvantaged  individuals.”  SBA’s  website  further  explains  that \n“socially disadvantaged individuals” and “economically disadvantaged individuals” \nmust be “a member of a group” that has “been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice \nor cultural bias.”  \n23.  On May 4, 2021, SBA sent email to applicants explaining as follows: “As \noutlined by Congress, the SBA will focus their reviews on the priority applications \n6 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 6 of 10   PageID #: 278\n\nthat have been submitted. Applicants who have submitted a non-priority application \nwill find their applications remain in a Review status while the priority applications \nare processed during the first 21 days. Applicants in this status should not anticipate \nany outreach from the SBA during this period.” \n24.  Plaintiffs are harmed in multiple ways. First, they have been pushed to \nthe back of the line behind priority applicants, regardless of when they applied, for a \nlimited fund that may run out before their application is processed. Second, even if \nthe fund does not run out, Plaintiffs are harmed by being treated differently because \nof their race and gender during the application and award process for a grant under \nthe Restaurant Revitalization Fund program. \n25.  Unless Defendant is immediately enjoined, Plaintiffs may never be able \nto recover from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund program if the funds run out \nbefore their applications are processed and awarded.  \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nEQUAL PROTECTION VIOLATION \n \n26.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n27.  The Constitution forbids “discrimination by the general government . . .  \nagainst any citizen because of his race.” Gibson v. State of Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, \n591 (1896).  \n28.  Gender  discrimination  is  also  unconstitutional.  Courts  “carefully \ninspect[ ] official action that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or to men).” \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532 (1996).  \n7 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 7 of 10   PageID #: 279\n\n29.  “The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause \ncontains within it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection \nof the laws.” United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013). \n30.  “[A]ll racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by \na reviewing court under strict scrutiny.” Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 505 \n(2005) (citation omitted). “Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of \nproving  that  racial  classifications  are  narrowly  tailored  measures  that  further \ncompelling governmental interests.” Id. (citation omitted). \n31.  When gender discrimination is employed, the burden “rests entirely” on \nthe government to offer an “exceedingly persuasive” justification, and to prove that \nthe “the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement \nof those objectives.” Virginia, 518 U.S. at 532 (citations omitted). \n32.  Section  5003  of  ARPA  imposes  racial  classifications  and  grants  a \nbenefit—priority consideration—based on those racial classifications.  \n33.  Section 5003 of ARPA likewise uses gender discrimination as a method \nof distributing funds through a gender-based priority consideration. \n34.  Defendant is responsible for interpreting and implementing Section \n5003 of ARPA. \n35.  Although  Plaintiffs  suffered  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  are \notherwise eligible for a grant under the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, Plaintiffs \nare ineligible for priority consideration, and instead are pushed to the back of the line \n8 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 8 of 10   PageID #: 280\n\nfor processing and awarding, because they are white males (or in the case of plaintiff-\nentities, controlled by white males). \n36.  Plaintiffs applied for a grant under Section 5003 of ARPA and were \ndenied priority consideration because they are white males (or in the case of plaintiff-\nentities, controlled by white males). \n37.  The  racial  classifications  under  Section  5003  of  ARPA  are \nunconstitutional  because  they  violate  the  Equal  Protection  and  Due  Process \nguarantees in the United States Constitution. These racial classifications under \nSection 5003 of ARPA are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government \ninterest.  \n38.  The  gender-based  classification  under  Section  5003  of  ARPA  is \nunconstitutional because it violates the Equal Protection and Due Process guarantees \nin the United States Constitution. This gender-based classification is not supported \nby an exceedingly persuasive objective, and the discriminatory means employed are \nnot substantially related to the achievement of that objective \nRELIEF REQUESTED \n  Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.  Immediately enter a temporary restraining order ordering Defendant to \npay Plaintiffs’ grant applications, if approved, before all other later-filed applications, \nwithout regard to processing time or the applicants’ race or sex. \n9 \n \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 34   Filed 06/01/21   Page 9 of 10   PageID #: 281\n\nB.  Enter a preliminary injunction requiring Defendant to pay Plaintiffs’ \ngrant applications if approved, before all other later-filed applications, without regard \nto processing time or the applicants’ race or sex.  \nC.   Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  race-  and  gender-based \nclassifications under Section 5003 of ARPA are unconstitutional.   \nD.  Enter an order permanently enjoining Defendant from applying race- \nand  gender-based  classifications  when  determining  eligibility  or  priority \nconsideration for grants under Section 5003 of ARPA.  \n  E.  Grant Plaintiffs such other and further relief as the court deems \nappropriate. \nDated: June 1, 2021      WISCONSIN INSTITUTE FOR LAW & LIBERTY \nRick Esenberg (pro hac vice) \nrick@will-law.org \n/s/ Daniel P.

McDonough  \nPlaintiffs,   \nv.  Magistrate Judge Debra C. Poplin  \n   \nISABELLA CASILLAS GUZMAN,    \n \nDefendant. \n \n \nDEFENDANT’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFFS’ SECOND EMERGENCY MOTION \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \nCongress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) in March 2021 as a continuation \nof the federal government’s efforts to provide relief to American individuals and businesses suffering \nthe economic and public health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Act allocated $28.6 billion \ntowards  a  Restaurant  Revitalization  Fund  (“RRF”)  to  be  administered  by  the  Small  Business \nAdministration (“SBA”) that could grant eligible restaurants relief equal to revenue losses caused by \nthe pandemic.  In creating the RRF, Congress permitted all eligible restaurants to apply for relief but \ninstructed SBA, for the first 21 days the RRF operated, to prioritize processing claims from restaurants \nowned by women, veterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.1  The priority \nperiod operated from when the RRF portal opened on May 3, 2021 through May 24, 2021.2 \nSBA opened the portal for RRF applications on May 3, 2021.  Due to overwhelming demand \nfrom restaurants, claims on the RRF rapidly dwarfed the allocation of funds set aside by Congress \n                                                 \n1 SBA often uses the shorthand term “priority applications” or “priority applicants” to refer to small \nbusinesses that fall into these categories, and those terms are used throughout this brief.   \n2 In crafting this priority period, Congress was motivated by extensive evidence showing its prior \nCOVID-19 relief efforts exacerbated existing inequalities between different groups of small business \nowners—including women and socially and economically disadvantaged restaurant owners—due to \npast and present discrimination within public and private lending markets. Congress also analyzed \nsimilar evidence showing that these businesses have borne an outsized burden during the pandemic \ndue to past and present discrimination, including the lack of access to earlier COVID-19 relief funds. \n1 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 1 of 11   PageID #: 333\n\nand, accordingly, the SBA stopped accepting new applications for the RRF on May 24, 2021.  Because \nthe period Congress established for focusing on priority applications has ended, SBA also has stopped \napproving and disbursing funds for priority applications and is now focused solely on processing and \napproving eligible applications filed by individuals who did not identify themselves as falling into one \nof the priority groups identified by Congress.3  SBA will continue to process and pay out pending \nclaims until the fund is exhausted.   \n  On May 12, 2021, Plaintiffs Antonio Vitolo and Jake’s Bar and Grill LLC filed this action \nchallenging the priority period under Section 5003.  As explained in more detail below, SBA disbursed \nfunds to Plaintiffs under the RRF on June 1, 2021.  Also on June 1, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an Amended \nComplaint in this action adding several Additional Plaintiffs.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6-9.  These Additional \nPlaintiffs now seek to enjoin the priority period provision of the RRF, but their claim is moot because \nthat provision has already ceased operation by its own terms.  Because SBA is already processing non-\npriority  applications—including  the  Additional  Plaintiffs’  applications—without  regard  for  the \nowner’s race or sex and because SBA has halted processing of priority applications until it has \ncompleted processing of all previously filed non-priority applications, Plaintiffs’ claims are moot and \nno further injunctive relief is necessary or appropriate.  \nBACKGROUND \n  The American Rescue Plan Act and the Restaurant Revitalization Fund     \nOn March 11, 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act, which provides \nwidespread COVID-related relief to the American people and businesses, including restaurants. \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act, Pub. L. No. 117-2 (2021) (“ARPA”).  As relevant here, section 5003 of \nARPA established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (“RRF”) and appropriated $28.6 billion to the \nfund for fiscal year 2021.  ARPA § 5003(b)(1)-(2).  Section 5003 instructs that in the first 21 days that \ngrants are awarded through RRF, the SBA:   \n                                                 \n3 SBA often uses the shorthand term “non-priority applications” or “non-priority applicants” to \nrefer to small businesses that fall into this group, and those terms are used throughout this brief.   \n2 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 2 of 11   PageID #: 334\n\nshall prioritize awarding grants to eligible entities that are small business concerns \nowned and controlled by women (as defined in section 3(n) of the Small Business \nAct(15 U.S.C. 632(n)), small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans (as \ndefined in section 3(q) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 632(q))), or socially and economically \ndisadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4)(A) of the Small \nBusiness Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)(A))). \nARPA § 5003(c)(3)(A).  The details of that prioritization scheme are set out in detail in Defendant’s \nearlier filings and in this Court’s prior order.  See, e.g., Def.’s Opp. to Pls’. Mot. for Temporary \nRestraining Order 2-8, ECF No. 18 (“Defs.’ TRO Opp.”); Mem. Op. 1-5, ECF No. 24.   \n  Operation of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and Closing of the Priority \nPeriod \n  SBA began accepting applications through the RRF portal on May 3, 2021.  See SBA, SBA \nAdministrator Guzman Announces Application Opening for $28.6 Billion Restaurant Revitalization \nFund,  https://www.sba.gov/article/2021/apr/27/sba-administrator-guzman-announces-\napplication-opening-286-billion-restaurant-revitalization-fund.  Per section 5003, the opening of the \nRRF application process triggered the beginning of the 21-day priority period.  Declaration of John \nA. Miller ¶ 7 (“Miller Decl.”).  Consistent with those provisions, SBA began processing applications \nfrom applicants who self-certified as qualifying for priority status.  Id ¶ 12.   \nDemand for RRF grants was immediate and overwhelming from priority and non-priority \napplicants  alike.    On  May  5,  2021,  SBA  reported  that  it  had  received  approximately  186,000 \napplications in two days from both priority and non-priority businesses.  See SBA, Administrator \nIsabella  Casillas  Guzman  Announces  Initial  Results  of  Restaurant  Revitalization  Fund, \nhttps://www.sba.gov/article/2021/may/05/administrator-isabella-casillas-guzman-announces-\ninitial-results-restaurant-revitalization-fund.  On May 18, 2021, SBA announced that it had received \n303,000 applications, requesting over $69 billion in funds.

SBA announced that it would close the RRF application \nportal on Monday, May 24, at 8 p.m. ET.  Id.  \n3 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 3 of 11   PageID #: 335\n\nDuring the priority period from May 3 to May 24, 2021, SBA prioritized initiating processing \nof RRF applications from veteran-owned and women-owned restaurants, as well as restaurants owned \nby socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Miller Decl. ¶ 12.  After the expiration of the \npriority period, SBA made changes in order to comply with section 5003’s instruction that the agency \nprioritize “awarding grants to eligible entities” only during the “initial 21-day period.”  ARPA § \n5003(c)(3)(A).  On May 25, 2021, SBA began processing applications from non-priority applicants \nwith FY 2019 gross revenues less than $50,000.  Miller Decl. ¶ 12.  On May 27, 2021, SBA began \ninitiating the processing of non-priority applications.  Id. ¶ 14.  SBA booked the final priority \napplications into SBA’s E-Tran system for disbursement of funds on the afternoon of May 27, 2021.  \nId. ¶ 16.  This group of approximately 2,002 priority applicants had previously been approved prior to \nthe time SBA stopped further processing of priority applications on May 26, 2021, but were returned \ndue to technical errors.  Id.  The funds for these applicants were disbursed by the Treasury Department \non the morning of May 28, 2021.  Id.  SBA will only resume processing priority applications once it \ncompletes processing for the previously filed non-priority applications, and only then if the RRF is \nnot first exhausted.  Id. ¶ 15.  In the meantime, SBA is continuing to process non-priority applications \nin a sequential order based on its ordinary review practices.  Id. ¶ 14.   \n  Plaintiffs And This Litigation  \nOn May 12, 2021, Plaintiffs Antonio Vitolo and Jake’s Bar and Grill LLC filed the initial \ncomplaint in this action challenging the RRF priority period.  See generally Compl., ECF No. 1.  \nPlaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, both of which were \ndenied by this Court.  See Order, ECF No. 20; Order, ECF No. 27.  On May 27, 2021, the Sixth Circuit \nissued an opinion enjoining the SBA to “fund the plaintiffs’ grant application, if approved, before all \nlater-filed applications, without regard to processing time or the applicants’ race or sex.”  Vitolo v. \nGuzman, No. 21-5517, 2021 WL 2172181, at *9 (6th Cir. May 27, 2021).  On June 1, 2021, SBA \ndisbursed $104,590.20 in RRF funds to Jake’s Bar and Grill LLC.  Miller Decl. ¶ 20.   \n4 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 4 of 11   PageID #: 336\n\n  Also on June 1, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in this action which added several \nAdditional Plaintiffs, each of whom identifies as a white male and each of whom contends that “he \nwas denied a priority preference based on his race and gender.”  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6-9.4  On June 2, \n2021, the Additional Plaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and \nPreliminary Injunction, asking this Court to enjoin Defendant “to pay Additional Plaintiffs’ grant \napplications, if approved, before all other later-filed applications, without regard to processing time or \nthe applicants’ race or sex.”  See Pls.’ Second Emergency Mot. for a Temporary Restraining Order & \nPreliminary Injunction 1 (“Pls.’ Second Emergency Mot.”).  The Court ordered Defendant to respond \nto Plaintiffs’ motion on or before June 3, 2021.  See Text Order, ECF No. 40.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“A temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy.”  Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. v. \nDees, No. 3:16-cv-222, 2016 WL 8738436 (Aug. 29, 2016) (quoting Hacker v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 450 \nF. Supp. 2d 705 710 (E.D. Mich. 2006)); see also Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 \n(2008).  The burden is on the party seeking the injunctive relief.  Thomas v. Schroer, 116 F. Supp. 3d \n869, 874 (W.D. Tenn. 2015); see also Hartman v. Acton, No. 2:20-cv-01952, 2020 WL 1932896, at *2 \n(S.D. Ohio Apr. 21, 2020) (“The ‘burden of proving that the circumstances ‘clearly demand’ such an \nextraordinary remedy is a heavy one’ since ‘the party seeking ‘the injunction must establish its case by \nclear and convincing evidence.’”). \nIn determining whether to issue a temporary restraining order, the Court examines (1) whether \nthe movant has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the movant will suffer \nirreparable harm if the injunction is not issued; (3) whether the issuance of the injunction would cause \nsubstantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuing the \ninjunction.  See Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cty. Gov’t., 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002).  The \nfinal two factors “merge when the Government is the opposing party.”   Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n                                                 \n4 Although the Amended Complaint does not expressly identify Plaintiff Alfred Castiglioni as a white \nmale, Am. Compl. ¶ 8, his later-filed declaration identifies him as such.  See Declaration of Alfred \nCastiglioni ¶ 6, ECF No. 39-1.   \n5 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 5 of 11   PageID #: 337\n\n435 (2009).  “When a court considers the four factors as part of a constitutional challenge, ‘the \nlikelihood of success on the merits will often be the determinative factor.’”  Michigan Rest. & Lodging \nAss’n v. Gordon, No. 1:20-cv-1104, 2020 WL 6866649, at *1 (W.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2020) (quoting \nThompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 615 (6th Cir. 2020)); Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423,436 (6th \nCir. 2012) (quoting Jones v. Caruso, 569 F.3d 258, 265 (6th Cir. 2009)). \nARGUMENT \n  Plaintiffs Are Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims Because Their \nClaims Are Moot.  \nTo obtain a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must demonstrate \nthat they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim, including by establishing jurisdiction.  \nPlaintiffs cannot make that showing here because their claim is moot and accordingly Plaintiffs lack \nstanding to pursue their requested injunctive relief.  \n“[A] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest in the outcome.’”  L.A. Cty. v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979); see also Cullen v. \nGibson, 124 F.3d 197, 1997 WL 547932 at *3 (6th Cir. 1997) (“A case is moot when no live controversy \nremains, and no live controversy remains when a court cannot provide effective relief.”).  “No matter \nhow vehemently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the conduct that precipitated the \nlawsuit, the case is moot if the dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the \nplaintiffs’ particular legal rights.”  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).   \nPlaintiffs’ claims are moot because the statutory provision that they challenge—the priority \nperiod subsection of section 5003—expired by its own terms approximately one week before Plaintiffs \nfiled their Amended Complaint.  When, as here, a challenged action expires by its own terms, there is \nno longer a live case or controversy.  The Sixth Circuit has previously recognized that “[o]nce a law is \noff the books and replaced with a ‘new rule’ that does not injure the plaintiff, a case becomes moot, \nleaving [the court] with an absence of jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.”  Pleasant View Baptist Church \nv. Beshear, 838 F. App’x 936, 938 (6th Cir. 2020).  In Pleasant View Baptist Church, the Sixth Circuit held \nthat a challenge to a state executive order prohibiting certain social gatherings due to COVID-19 was \n6 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 6 of 11   PageID #: 338\n\nmoot because the order had expired and the Commonwealth had replaced it with a voluntary \nrecommendation.  Id. (citing N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n Inc. v. City of N.Y., 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1526 \n(2020) (per curiam); and citing Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 377, 377 (2017) (per curiam)); see also Maryville \nBaptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear, 957 F.3d 610, 612 (6th Cir. 2020) (recognizing that a challenge to a stay-\nat-home order “will become moot . . . when the Governor has agreed to permit places of worship to \nreopen”).   \nThis approach is firmly rooted in Supreme Court case law.  In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme \nCourt initially granted certiorari to hear a challenge concerning a temporary order regarding the \nadmission of refugees.  See Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 377.  But the Court found that after the “provisions of \nthe  Order  have  ‘expired  by  [their]  own  terms,’  the  appeal  no  longer  presents  a  ‘live  case  or \ncontroversy.’”  Id. (quoting Burke, 479 U.S. at 363).  Similarly, in Burke the Supreme Court heard an \nappeal from members of Congress challenging the President’s use of a “pocket-veto” over a specific \nbill.  See 479 U.S. at 362.  But the “bill in question expired by its own terms on September 30, 2018, a \nfew weeks after the Court of Appeals entered its judgment.”  Id. at 363.  The Supreme Court therefore \nconcluded the case was moot.  Id.; cf. Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami, Florida, Inc., 404 U.S. \n412 (1972) (per curiam) (finding claim seeking declaratory relief that Florida law was constitutionally \nmoot after statute’s repeal). \nSection 5003 directed the SBA to prioritize awarding grants to restaurants owned by women, \nveterans, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals “[d]uring the initial 21-day period \nin which the Administrator awards grants” through the RRF.  ARPA § 5003(c)(3)(A).  That 21-day \nperiod has ended, and the priority period subsection of Section 5003 no longer dictates how SBA \nprocesses RRF applications.  Thus, although the subsection is technically still “on the books,” it no \nlonger governs SBA’s implementation of the program.   \nNothing in Plaintiffs’ complaint indicates that there is additional relief the Court can provide \nto Plaintiffs now that the priority period has concluded and SBA has begun processing non-priority \napplications and paused processing of priority applications.  The Sixth Circuit previously held that the \nexpiration of the priority period under Section 5003 did not render plaintiffs’ challenge moot because \n7 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 7 of 11   PageID #: 339\n\nit found that “the program’s race and sex preferences did not end with the priority phase” due to its \nunderstanding that “all of the ‘priority applications that were received in the 21-day window are still \nbeing processed first’” and “no application is paid out before going through the 14-day processing \nwindow.”  Vitolo, 2021 WL 2172181 at *3.  Plaintiffs argue that the same logic should apply here.  \nHowever, the Sixth Circuit reached its decision without the benefit of additional information regarding \nthe SBA’s current approach to processing applications.  Because the Sixth Circuit issued its decision \nminutes before Defendant intended to file the Second Miller Declaration in that case, the Sixth Circuit \npanel did not have before it the information that “SBA is not currently processing any priority \napplications” and that “SBA will only resume processing these applications once it completes \nprocessing for all previously filed non-priority applications, and only then if the RRF is not first \nexhausted.”  Miller Decl. ¶ 15.  Those additional details make clear that this case is indeed moot.   \nPlaintiff suggests that “if SBA is continuing to process any later-filed priority applications . . . \nthen the priority period continues to have an effect.”  Pls.’ Second Emergency Mot. 3.  However, SBA \n“is not currently processing any priority applications.”  Miller Decl. ¶ 15.  And SBA has expressly \nstated that it “will only resume processing these applications once it completes processing for all \npreviously filed non-priority applications, and only then if the RRF is not first exhausted”  Id.  Because \nSBA is not currently processing any priority applications, the priority period does not continue to have \nan effect.5  Accordingly, the Additional Plaintiffs’ applications are already being processed and \nconsidered “without regard to . . . the applicants’ race or sex.”  Vitolo, 2021 WL 2172181 at *9; see also \nMiller Decl. ¶¶ 22-26.   \nRRF grants are not necessarily funded strictly in the order they were received.  However, these \ndifferences in processing time are not based on an applicant’s race or gender.  Rather, it is a question \nof logistics: for example, “[s]ome applications are more complicated than others and take longer to \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiffs suggest that “priority applicants could completely deplete the fund before any white, male \napplicants received a shot at any funds.”  Pls.’ Second Emergency Mot. 3.  But SBA has already \napproved a number of non-priority applicants.  Miller Decl. ¶ 17 (“SBA approved approximately \n17,231 non-priority applications for grants of less than $360,000.”).   \n8 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 8 of 11   PageID #: 340\n\nreview”6  Miller Decl. ¶ 10.  In particular, SBA’s processing guidelines require additional review of \napplications seeking more than $360,000 in funds; this more extensive review was adopted as a \nprogram decision to manage risk and protect against waste, fraud, and abuse.  Id. ¶ 11.  Processing \nthese larger claims requires Form 4506-T verification of the applicant’s tax returns from the IRS, \nwhich potentially takes as long as 8 business days.  Id.  Thus, an application for less than $360,000 in \nfunds that does not require this Form 4506-T verification may be processed and considered faster \nthan an application that does require verification.  Id.   \nAnd SBA’s pause on priority applications ensures that grants to non-priority applicants are \nfunded “without regard to the processing head start that many applications received on the basis of \nrace and sex.”  Vitolo, 2021 WL 2172181 at *3.  In other words, although applications are not \nnecessarily funded “without regard to processing time,” those differences in processing time are not \nbased on an applicant’s race or gender.  Moreover, “the actual order in which processing an application \nbegins is determined by the order in which [applications] were received, subject only to the priority \nperiod rules.”  Miller Decl. ¶ 10.  Plaintiffs have provided no explanation why the agency must fund \ngrant applications in the order they were received “without regard to processing time”  if the \ndifferences in processing time are not related to the priority period.  SBA is currently “processing non-\npriority applications, including the additional Plaintiffs’ applications, in a sequential order based on its \nordinary review practices.”  Miller Decl. ¶ 14.  An injunction requiring the SBA to fund all applications \nin the order in which they were received, regardless of processing time, would allow a single deficient \nor particularly complex application to gum up the works, as no applicant would be able to be funded \nuntil that deficient or complex application was fully resolved and the funds were disbursed.  Such a \ncondition could slow SBA’s ability to disburse much-needed aid.   \n                                                 \n6   In fact, one of the original Plaintiffs in this action, Jake’s Bar and Grill LLC, encountered a brief \ndelay in the processing and funding of its application because the applicant’s name did not match the \nname on the bank account provided in the application.  Miller Decl. ¶ 19.  SBA has since disbursed \nfunds to Jake’s Bar and Grill LLC, id. ¶ 20; however, this provides one example of a scenario where \nan applicant’s funding may be delayed for reasons unrelated to the priority period.    \n9 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 9 of 11   PageID #: 341\n\nBecause the priority period has already expired and because SBA is already processing non-\npriority applications prior to continuing processing later-filed priority applications, this action is moot \nand no injunctive relief is necessary or appropriate.7 \n  Plaintiffs Have Not Alleged An Irreparable Injury.   \nBecause SBA is already processing the Additional Plaintiffs’ applications without regard to \ntheir race and gender, the Additional Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they are “likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, \n20 (2008).  Preliminary relief is therefore moot and cannot aid Plaintiffs in preventing any potential \nfuture harm.  \n  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Weigh Against Injunctive Relief.   \nPreliminary relief at this stage cannot aid the Additional Plaintiffs and can only possibly delay \ndesperately needed aid for thousands of American restaurants.  See Def.’s TRO Opp. 23.  Requiring \nSBA to further pause disbursement of funds to comply with an injunctive order risks delaying this \nmuch-needed aid.  Such a delay is not in the public interest, particularly where such an order is not \nnecessary to prevent or remedy any alleged constitutional injury.  Accordingly, the public interest \ndramatically weighs against a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.    \n  Any Injunctive Relief Should Be Tailored To The Injury Plaintiffs Have Alleged.  \nAlthough Plaintiffs “move[d] . . . for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary \ninjunction, ordering Defendant to pay Additional Plaintiffs’ grant applications, if approved, before all \nother later-filed applications, without regard to processing time or the applicants’ race or sex,” \nPlaintiffs request in a footnote that this court enter a “national injunction” regarding the RRF.  As \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiffs state in a footnote that “[i]f the government continues to assert that an injunction is \nunnecessary without clearly explaining what it is doing,” the Court should enter a brief injunction and \nallow Plaintiffs to submit interrogatories to the government “to get to the bottom of how the SBA is \nprocessing and funding applications.”  Pls.’ Second Emergency Mot. 4 n.2.  Defendant has provided \na detailed declaration clearly explaining how SBA is processing applications and the conditions \nnecessary  for  the  agency  to  recommence  processing  priority  applications.    That  explanation \ndemonstrates that an injunction is unnecessary and that discovery into SBA’s procedures is thus \nunnecessary at this juncture.  In any event, Plaintiffs are not entitled to an injunction simply to pursue \ndiscovery into SBA’s procedures, particularly where SBA has demonstrated that their claims are moot.  \n10 \nCase 3:21-cv-00176-TRM-DCP   Document 41   Filed 06/03/21   Page 10 of 11   PageID #: 342\n\nexplained above, the Court should not grant a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction \nin this case.  But even if the Court were inclined to grant injunctive relief, that relief “must be tailored \nto redress the plaintiff’s particular injury.”  Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1934 (2018).  As Defendant \nhas previously explained, a nationwide injunction is not so tailored.  See Def.’s Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for \nPreliminary Injunction 14-15, ECF No. 30.  And in considering an earlier appeal in this very case, the \nSixth Circuit declined to provide nationwide relief, instead limiting its injunction to the plaintiffs alone.  \nSee Vitolo, 2021 WL 2172181 at *9.   \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ second emergency motion for a temporary restraining \norder and preliminary injunction should be denied.  \n \n   \nDated: June 3, 2021  Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n  BRIAN M.
