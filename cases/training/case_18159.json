    "summary": "<p>This is a case about the treatment of children in the care of the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) with behavioral health and/or developmental disabilities. On January 28th, 2021, three children under the care of DCYF brought a class-action suit along with Disability Rights Washington against DCYF in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. The case was assigned to Judge Barbara J. Rothstein. Disability Rights Washington argued that the consistent mistreatment of these children caused a significant drain on their resources and that the organization had previously requested that DCYF change these practices several times.</p>\r\n<p>The three children and Disability Rights Washington alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Fourteenth Amendment for unwarranted government interference with family and substantive due process, and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. Represented by a mixture of private firm and organizational attorneys, the plaintiffs hoped to end the state&rsquo;s policy of &ldquo;exceptional placements&rdquo; for children with behavioral health and/or developmental disabilities in their care. In addition, they hoped to move DCYF to provide more stability for children with behavioral health or developmental disabilities.</p>\r\n<p>The class-action complaint alleged misconduct by DCYF in its treatment of children with behavioral health and/or developmental disabilities, especially in regards to the long term stability of those children. The complaint specifically alleged misconduct by DCYF in regards to the three children plaintiffs &ndash; each of whom qualified under DCYF&rsquo;s definition as a child with behavioral health and/or developmental disabilities. The complaint noted the usage of &ldquo;exceptional placements'' for such children and the common usage of &ldquo;Behavioral Rehabilitation Services&rdquo; in Congregate Care Facilities.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Exceptional placements&rdquo; is how DCYF referred to the policy of one-night and short-term stay housing arrangements for youth in their care. Examples of &ldquo;exceptional placements&rdquo; included shuttling between motels, one-night foster care status, and overnight stays at DCYF offices. The complaint alleged that the only other option given to plaintiffs and other children in their situation was placement in &ldquo;Congregate Care Programs,&rdquo; where they were segregated with other youth who had behavioral health and developmental disabilities. These were not permanent placements, and were often far from their families, sometimes out of state.</p>\r\n<p>On April 12th, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, which was granted in part on June 29, 2021, and ordered to last until June 30, 2022. The preliminary injunction set limits on where children under the care of DCYF may sleep and laid out requirements for what DCYF must provide children in its care. It also regulated the way in which DCYF must respond should a child in its care deny placement and ordered regularly scheduled meetings for any child who lacked long-term placement until long-term placement was identified. The order also required DCYF to maintain and keep healthy food and beverage options in their offices, provide transportation to school or provide a quiet study space for online school, and provide age-appropriate activities if school was not in session.</p>\r\n<p>On September 22, 2021, the Court approved a stipulated motion for class certification of children with behavioral health and/or developmental disabilities in the care of DCYF. The parties agreed that the class would be defined as individuals who are or in the future will be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Under the age of 18, AND</li>\r\n<li>Be in the care of DCYF during a dependency proceeding until dismissed; AND</li>\r\n<li>One or more of the following\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have experienced five or more placements (not including temporary placements, trial return home, in-home dependency placements); OR</li>\r\n<li>Have been referred for or at an out-of-state group care; OR</li>\r\n<li>Have experienced an office or hotel stay in the past six months; OR</li>\r\n<li>Are awaiting a Children&rsquo;s Long-Term Inpatient Program(CLIP) bed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A bench trial was scheduled for late 2022, however, on June 24, 2022, the Court granted preliminary approval for a class action settlement, directing notice of the settlement to the class members and their representatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 9, 2022, the final settlement was approved by the court. The Settlement agreement included the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Establishing trauma informed, culturally responsible and LQBTQIA+ affirming alternatives to then short term solutions, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An Emerging Adulthood Housing Program for 16-21 year olds, with independent living and 24/7 staffing and case management,</li>\r\n<li>Developing a Professional Therapeutic Foster Parenting Program, creating a licensing category for them, and</li>\r\n<li>Establishing a statewide Hub Home Model to support immediate, extended and chosen family foster care solutions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Revising licensing standards for foster care placements,</li>\r\n<li>Establishing a statewide Kinship Engagement Unit,</li>\r\n<li>Reviewing Shared Planning Meeting and Family Team Decision Meeting policies,</li>\r\n<li>Developing trauma-informed referral and transition protocols,</li>\r\n<li>Creating a comprehensive evaluation process for determining the appropriateness of congregate case settings for children, and</li>\r\n<li>Hiring a Stakeholder Facilitator and appointing a Monitor to manage and review compliance with the settlement agreement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On September 21, 2022, the case was dismissed, but the court retained jurisdiction over the matter to enforce the provisions of the Settlement Agreement, if needed. The Court also approved the unopposed motion for attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs in the amount of $2,150,000. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since May 3, 2023, the court has granted numerous stipulated motions for attorney&rsquo;s fees. The court granted such motions on July 5, 2023, September 21, 2023, January 24, 2024, March 7, 2024, April 17, 2024, July 17, 2024, and October 11, 2024. The court also approved a stipulated modification to the settlement on both April 17, 2023 and August 3, 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Monitoring of the Settlement Agreement remains ongoing as of February 2025.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n2 Plaintiffs and Defendants (together the “Parties”), respectfully request an order from the \n3 Court granting final approval of the Parties’ Settlement Agreement. Kas Decl. Ex. A, ECF No. \n4 93-1. The Court granted preliminary approval of the Parties’ Settlement Agreement on June 24, \n5 2022, finding its terms “fair, reasonable, and adequate for the Class.” Ord. Granting Prelim. App. \n6 2, ECF No. 97. The Court also approved the Parties’ proposed Notice and Notice Plan, \n7 established a schedule for submitting comments to the Settlement Agreement, and set a date for \n8 the final approval hearing. Id. at 3-5. Preliminary approval was entered “pending the outcome of \n9 the final settlement approval hearing.” Id. at 2. \n10 In  accordance  with  the  Court’s  Order,  the  Parties  have  fully  complied  with  the \n11 requirements of the Notice Plan and have submitted declarations to that effect to the Court. See \n12 Def.’s Report Re Compliance with Notice Plan, ECF No. 98; Walvatne Decl., ECF No. 99; Pls.’ \n13 Decl. of Compliance With Notice Plan, ECF No. 100.  \n14 The Parties respectfully request that the Court grant final approval of the Settlement \n15 Agreement and issue an order that: A) expressly incorporates the terms of the Settlement \n16 Agreement; B) provides that the Court has and will retain jurisdiction over the judgment and \n17 order to enforce the Parties’ compliance with the Settlement Agreement; and C) otherwise \n18 dismisses this action. \n19 II.  BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE LITIGATION \n20 This suit seeks to ensure that children with disabilities placed in the Washington State \n21 child welfare system receive the individualized services and supports necessary to allow them to \n22 return promptly and safely to their families and communities and avoid harmful temporary, \n23 emergency, or congregate placements. Compl. ¶¶ 5-6, ECF No. 1. To this end, the Named \n24 Plaintiffs, acting on behalf of a class of children with behavioral health and developmental \n25 disabilities in the custody of Washington State’s child welfare system, and the non-profit \n26 organization, Disability Rights Washington (“DRW”) (together “Plaintiffs”), filed suit against \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  1  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 3 of 16\n \n1 the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (“DCYF”) and its Secretary \n2 Ross Hunter (together “Defendants”). Id.1 \n3 The complaint alleged that Defendants have failed to develop an adequate array of \n4 placement options and supportive services, instead relying on a patchwork of hotels, one-night \n5 stays, government offices, and out-of-state placements to warehouse children with disabilities.  \n6 Compl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants’ failures violated the rights of the \n7 Class under the United States Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n8 12131 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the Adoption \n9 Assistance and Child Welfare Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621, 670 et seq. Plaintiffs sought declaratory \n10 and injunctive relief. Compl. ¶¶ 107-28, ECF No. 1. Defendants denied liability for Plaintiffs’ \n11 claims. Def.’s Answer 13, ECF No. 23. \n12 Prior to filing this suit, Plaintiffs’ counsel undertook a lengthy investigation of the claims \n13 at issue in this case. Kas Decl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 93. Counsel visited foster youth placed in out-of-\n14 state congregate settings, prepared a report raising concerns about these out-of-state facilities, \n15 spoke with foster youth and stakeholders across the state, analyzed case files and other records, \n16 and conducted additional legal and factual research. Id. Plaintiffs’ counsel initially sought to \n17 address the concerns about out-of-state placements through engaging with Defendants directly, \n18 and the Parties engaged in negotiations for a year, from approximately September 2019 through \n19 September 2020. Id. ¶ 4. After initial negotiations failed to resolve their concerns, Plaintiffs filed \n20 their Complaint. Id.   \n21 On  June  29,  2021,  the  Court  granted  in  part  Plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  preliminary \n22 injunction. Order Granting in Part Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. 2, ECF No. 63. The preliminary \n23 injunction: (1) restricted the keeping of children overnight in cars, (2) addressed the use of hotels, \n24\n \n1 This case’s litigation history and the Settlement Agreement are summarized in more detail in the Parties’ \n25\npreliminary approval motion and attached declarations. See ECF Joint Motion for Prelim. App. Class Action \nSettlement, ECF No. 92; Kas Decl., ECF No. 93. To avoid duplication, the parties have included a more concise \n26\nsummary here.  \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  2  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 4 of 16\n \n1 and government offices (“placement exceptions”), (3) required Defendants to develop a plan to \n2 cease the use of hotel and office stays by November 1, 2021, and (4) directed additional detailed \n3 requirements and procedural protections regarding DCYF’s use of placement exceptions. Id. at \n4 2-4.   \n5 In June 2021, the Parties reengaged in settlement negotiations. The Parties met virtually \n6 for more than a dozen negotiation sessions over the course of a year, between June 15, 2021, and \n7 June 2, 2022. Kas Decl. ¶ 8, ECF No. 93. These negotiation sessions benefitted from the \n8 participation of a skilled mediator and subject matter expert, Kathleen Noonan. Id. ¶ 6. The \n9 Parties continuously exchanged settlement drafts and communication over the course of these \n10 negotiations. Id. ¶ 8.  \n11 The Parties concurrently continued their discovery efforts while engaging in mediation.   \n12 Id. ¶ 5. Plaintiffs have served multiple document requests, including two sets of interrogatories, \n13 requests for production, and negotiated search terms for electronically stored information. Id. In \n14 total, Defendants have produced more than 190,000 pages of documents. Id. Plaintiffs have also \n15 taken the depositions of two DCYF employees. Id.  \n16 On September 22, 2021, the Court granted the Parties’ stipulation to the certification of \n17 a class, which defined the class as all individuals who are or in the future will be (a) under the \n18 age of 18, (b) in DCYF’s placement during a dependency proceeding, and (c) have experienced \n19 five or more placements, excluding temporary placements, or have been referred for or are in \n20 out-of-state group care placement, or have experienced a hotel or office stay in the past six \n21 months, or are awaiting a Children’s Long-Term Inpatient Program (CLIP) bed.2 Stip. and Order \n22 Regarding Definition of Class Action and Amend.

The Parties have reached agreement, and \n15 together with this motion are simultaneously filing a separate Unopposed Motion for Attorneys’ \n16 Fees and Costs. \n17 III.  SUMMARY OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  \n18 As explained in more detail in Plaintiffs’ preliminary approval motion, the Parties’ \n19 Settlement Agreement addresses the issues raised in this action through a series of substantive \n20 system improvements. See Joint Motion for Prelim. App. Class Action Settlement, ECF No. 92; \n21 Kas Decl. Ex. A, ECF No. 93-1. First, the Settlement Agreement requires Defendants to establish \n22 alternatives to out-of-state, hotel, office, and one-night foster care placements: including (1) \n23 establishing an Emerging Adulthood Housing Program, which will provide opportunities for \n24 youth ages sixteen to twenty-one who prefer to live in an independent setting, supported by 24/7 \n25 staffing and intensive case management; (2) developing a Professional Therapeutic Foster \n26 Parenting  Program,  which  will  create  a  licensing  category  for  therapeutic  foster  parent \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  4  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 6 of 16\n \n1 professionals;  and  (3)  establishing  a  statewide  Hub  Home  Model  to  provide  support  for \n2 immediate, extended, and chosen families supporting eligible foster children and youth. Kas \n3 Decl. Ex. A ¶¶ 6-8, ECF No. 93-1. Each of these must be provided in a trauma-informed, \n4 culturally responsive, and LGBTIQA+ affirming manner. Id.  \n5 Second, the Settlement Agreement also requires Defendants to address other issues raised \n6 in this action, including (1) revising licensing standards for foster care placements to be more \n7 developmentally appropriate and meet the needs of individual youth; (2) establishing a statewide \n8 Kinship Engagement Unit, which will identify and engage Class members’ extended family \n9 members and friends; (3) review Shared Planning Meeting and Family Team Decision Meeting \n10 policies and practices for possible amendment following stakeholder feedback to better support \n11 the child and family’s preferences and decisions; (4) developing trauma-informed referral and \n12 transition protocols; and (5) creating a more comprehensive evaluation process to determine \n13 whether it is necessary and appropriate to place a child in a congregate care setting. Id.  ¶¶ 9-13.  \n14 Finally,  the  Settlement  Agreement  requires  Defendants  to  engage  in  specified \n15 implementation processes and procedures to ensure compliance with the terms of the Agreement.  \n16 Defendants have agreed to hire a Stakeholder Facilitator who will collect input from key \n17 stakeholders regarding certain improvement practices required under the Settlement. Id. ¶ 21. In \n18 addition, the Parties agreed to appoint a Monitor to review Defendants’ compliance with the \n19 Settlement Agreement. Id. ¶ 14. The Parties have agreed Kathleen Noonan will serve in this role.  \n20 Id. Further, within 90 days of the final approval of the Settlement Agreement, Defendants will \n21 draft an Implementation Plan, describing how they will implement the requirements of the \n22 agreement.  Id.  ¶  22.  The  Implementation  Plan  must  include  consideration  of  stakeholder \n23 feedback, be made publicly available, and must be submitted to Plaintiffs, the Monitor, and the \n24 Stakeholder Facilitator for comment before it is finalized. Id. ¶¶ 22-23.  \n25 Defendants’ obligations terminate under the Settlement Agreement when Defendants \n26 fulfill the Settlement terms and meet specified Exit Criteria. Id. ¶ 36.

Id. ¶¶ 37-39. \n4 IV.  THE PARTIES HAVE PROVIDED NOTICE TO THE CLASS. \n5 Before approving a settlement agreement under Rule 23(e), “the court must direct notice \n6 in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal.” Fed. R. Civ. \n7 P. 23(e)(1)(B). Here, the Court has approved the Notice and Notice Plan proposed by the Parties \n8 in its preliminary approval order, finding the Notice Plan was “reasonably calculated to provide \n9 adequate  notice  to  Class  members  of  the  proposed  Settlement  Agreement”  and  met  “the \n10 requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, due process, and applicable law.” Ord. \n11 Granting Prelim. App. To Class Action Settlement 2-3, ECF No. 97. \n12 The Court-approved Notice explained what the lawsuit was about, stated who qualified \n13 as a Class member, summarized the topics addressed by the Settlement Agreement, and provided \n14 instructions on how individuals could obtain full copies of the Settlement Agreement. See Kas \n15 Decl. Ex. B, ECF No. 93-2; Ord. Granting Prelim. App. To Class Action Settlement, ECF No. \n16 97. The Notice also advised recipients what to do if they had questions and described the \n17 procedures for providing comments in favor of or in objection to the Settlement Agreement. Id.  \n18 Finally, the Notice specified the date, time, place, and manner of attendance for the fairness \n19 hearing set by the Court. Id.  \n20 The Court-approved Notice Plan set out detailed steps the Parties would undertake to \n21 provide reasonable notice to members of the Class. See Kas Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 93-3; Ord. \n22 Granting Prelim. App. To Class Action Settlement ECF No. 97. The Plan required DCYF to \n23 “translate the written Notice,” and to “prominently post a copy of the Notice” both online and in \n24 DCYF offices. Ord. Granting Prelim. App. To Class Action Settlement 2-3, ECF No. 97. The \n25 Plan further required DCYF to “disseminate the Notice to the individuals and organizations” \n26 specified in detail in the Notice Plan, including Class members and their representatives.

Def.’s Report Re \n8 Compliance with Notice Plan, ECF No. 98; Walvatne Decl., ECF No. 99; Pls.’ Decl. of \n9 Compliance with Notice Plan, ECF No. 100. The notice requirements of Rule 23(e)(1)(B) have \n10 thus been met. \n11 V.  THE SETTLEMENT IS FAIR, REASONABLE, AND ADEQUATE AND    \n12 SHOULD BE APPROVED. \n13 Before approving  a  class  action  settlement, the  court must  find that  the  proposed \n14 agreement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate.” Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(e)(2). The Court must consider \n15 whether: (A) “the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class;” \n16 (B) “the proposal was negotiated at arm’s length;” (C) “the relief provided for the class is \n17 adequate;” and (D) “the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other.” Id.  \n18 There is a “strong judicial policy that favors settlement, particularly where complex class action \n19 litigation is concerned.” In re Syncor ERISA Litig. v. Cardinal Health, Inc., 516 F.3d 1095, 1101 \n20 (9th Cir. 2008), see also Class Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir. 1992). \n21 The court’s role in approving a negotiated settlement agreement is limited. The court \n22 should only intrude on “what is otherwise a private consensual agreement negotiated between \n23 the parties” “to the extent necessary to reach a reasoned judgment that the agreement is not the \n24 product of fraud or overreaching by, or collusion between, the negotiating parties” and to \n25 determine “whether the settlement, taken as a whole, is fair, reasonable and adequate to all \n26 concerned.” Officers for Just. v. Civ. Serv. Comm'n of City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 688 F.2d \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  7  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 9 of 16\n \n1 615, 625 (9th Cir. 1982). This review process serves to protect the interests of class members \n2 not involved in constructing the settlement. Davis v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco, 890 F.2d \n3 1438, 1445 n.4 (9th Cir. 1989).  \n4 The court may weigh a number of factors in assessing the adequacy of the settlement.  \n5 These include, among others, the amount offered in the agreement, the extent of discovery \n6 completed, the likely duration of further litigation, and the experience and views of counsel.  \n7 Churchill Vill., L.L.C. v. Gen. Elec., 361 F.3d 566, 575 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Hanlon v. Chrysler \n8 Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1025 (9th Cir. 1998)). The factors the court considers and the weight of \n9 each factor will “vary depending on the unique circumstances of each case.” Officers for Just., \n10 688 F.2d at 625; see also Torrisi v. Tucson Elec. Power Co., 8 F.3d 1370, 1376 (9th Cir. 1993) \n11 (list  of  factors  “not  exclusive  and  different  factors  may  predominate  in  different  factual \n12 contexts”). However, “[a] presumption of fairness and adequacy attaches to a class action \n13 settlement reached in arm’s-length negotiations by experienced class counsel after meaningful \n14 discovery.” Dunakin v. Quigley, No. 2:14-CV-00567-JLR, 2017 WL 123011, at *2 (W.D. Wash. \n15 Jan. 10, 2017), Officers for Just., 688 F.2d at 625. The Parties’ Settlement Agreement meets \n16 these requirements. \n17 A.  The  Settlement  Agreement  Is  the  Result  of  Extensive  Arm’s-Length \n18 Negotiations after Significant Discovery. \n19 The Parties’ Settlement Agreement is the result of extensive, informed, and non-collusive \n20 mediation sessions between the Parties. As the Court found in its preliminary approval order, \n21 “the Settlement Agreement resulted from arm’s length negotiations” between the Parties, and \n22 there has been no “fraud, collusion, or overreaching.” Ord. Granting Prelim. App. To Class \n23 Action Settlement 2, ECF No. 97; see also Fed. R. Civ. P.  23(e)(2).  \n24 As discussed above, the Parties reached a settlement only after nearly a year of intense \n25 mediation sessions. Kas Decl. ¶ 8, ECF No. 93. This has included over a dozen virtual mediation \n26 sessions with both lawyers and principals present, between June 15, 2021 and June 2, 2022, as \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  8  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 10 of 16\n \n1 well as an all-day in-person mediation on April 21, 2022. Id. These sessions were moderated by \n2 a subject matter expert and experienced mediator, Kathleen Noonan, who provided an additional \n3 layer of expertise in assisting the Parties to reach an agreement that adequately addressed the \n4 concerns of the Class. Id. ¶ 6. Prior to the filing of this case, the Parties had already spent nearly \n5 a year unsuccessfully attempting to reach a mediated agreement. Id. ¶ 4. \n6 In addition, these mediation sessions were informed by significant formal and informal \n7 discovery efforts, providing the Parties more than “sufficient information to make an informed \n8 decision about settlement.” Linney v. Cellular Alaska P'ship, 151 F.3d 1234, 1239 (9th Cir. \n9 1998). Prior to filing this litigation, Plaintiffs’ counsel undertook a lengthy investigation process, \n10 gathering copious informal discovery, including meeting with foster youth and stakeholders \n11 across the state, visiting congregate facilities, preparing a report, analyzing case files and other \n12 records, and conducting legal and factual research and analysis regarding the violations at issue. \n13 Kas Decl. ¶ 3, ECF No. 93.  \n14 After litigation commenced, Plaintiffs engaged in substantial additional discovery \n15 efforts, including serving multiple interrogatories and requests for production, totaling more \n16 than 190,000 pages of produced discovery. Id. ¶ 5. Plaintiffs have also taken two depositions of \n17 DCYF employees. Id. In addition, over the course of litigation Plaintiffs have consulted with a \n18 variety of subject matter experts and have continued to collect information from stakeholders \n19 across the state. Id. These extensive investigation and discovery efforts have provided \n20 Plaintiffs’ counsel with a thorough understanding of the facts and law at issue, and have \n21 allowed Plaintiffs’ counsel to mediate a comprehensive and meaningful settlement. Id. ¶ 9.  \n22 B.  The Class Representatives and Class Counsel Have Adequately Represented \n23 the Class at Every Stage of the Case. \n24 In this case, “the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the \n25 class” at every stage of the litigation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). “Parties represented by competent \n26 counsel are better positioned than courts to produce a settlement that fairly reflects each party’s \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  9  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 11 of 16\n \n1 expected outcome in litigation.” In re Pac. Ent. Sec. Litig., 47 F.3d 373, 378 (9th Cir. 1995). As \n2 this Court found in its preliminary approval, here “counsel has sufficient experience in similar \n3 litigation” to adequately ensure the interests of the Class have been met. Ord. Granting Prelim. \n4 App. To Class Action Settlement 2, ECF No. 97.  \n5 Plaintiffs’ counsel in this case have extensive experience in complex civil litigation—\n6 including specifically litigating class actions on behalf of children in child welfare custody and \n7 individuals with disabilities—as well as negotiating and implementing settlements in such cases.  \n8 Kas  Decl.  ¶  9,  ECF  No.  93.  Plaintiffs’  counsel  collectively  have  litigated,  settled,  and \n9 implemented numerous institutional reform cases on behalf of children in government systems. \n10 See Kas Decl. ¶ 9, ECF No. 93 (listing relevant cases). Defendants too are represented by \n11 attorneys with significant experience in complex civil and constitutional litigation and in \n12 settlement negotiations and mediation sessions.  \n13 Plaintiffs have “aggressively litigated” this case in the interest of the Class every step of \n14 the way. Officers for Just., 688 F.2d at 627. Plaintiffs have labored over many years to investigate \n15 and bring this case, and spent an additional year mediating the final Settlement Agreement. Kas \n16 Decl. ¶ 9, ECF No. 93. At each stage of the litigation, Counsel have adequately represented the \n17 interests of the Class.  \n18 Where counsel is competent to represent the class, the “experience and views of counsel” \n19 are entitled to weight in determining whether a settlement agreement is fair, reasonable, and \n20 adequate. Officers for Just., 688 F.2d at 625. Here, both parties, relying on their significant \n21 experience in complex civil and constitutional litigation and in representing children with \n22 disabilities, have determined that the Settlement Agreement is in the best interests of the Class.  \n23 C.  The Relief Provided to the Class Adequately Addresses the Allegations in \n24 Plaintiffs’ Complaint and is in the Best Interest of the Class. \n25 The relief provided for the Class by the Settlement Agreement is substantial. The \n26 Settlement Agreement contains enforceable commitments by DCYF to redress each of the \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  10  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 12 of 16\n \n1 concerns raised in Plaintiffs’ Complaint and will yield significant benefits to Class members. \n2 Plaintiffs  Complaint  alleges  that,  “foster  children  with  behavioral  health  and \n3 developmental disabilities are separated from their families because of Defendants’ failure to \n4 correct systemic deficiencies and maintain a system that ensures the provision of the services \n5 and supports they need to remain or reunify with their families.” Compl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 1. As a \n6 result, “children are enduring extreme and dehumanizing placement instability that has them \n7 cycling between temporary shelters, group homes, out-of-state facilities, one-night foster care \n8 stays, hotel stays, and government offices.” Compl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 1. The parties’ Settlement \n9 Agreement addresses the conditions alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  \n10 As described above and in the Parties’ motion for preliminary approval, DCYF has \n11 agreed  to  provide  the  following  trauma-informed,  culturally  responsive,  and  LGBTIQA+ \n12 affirming system improvements to better support children to live in their own communities or \n13 with  their  own  families,  rather  than  out-of-state,  hotel/office,  and  one-night  foster  care \n14 placements: \n15   Emerging Adulthood Housing Program: DCYF has agreed to develop and implement \n16 an array of supported housing programs statewide for sixteen- to twenty-year-old young \n17 people in foster care or extended foster care who qualify for the program and would \n18 prefer to live independently rather than in a family setting. (Kas Decl. Ex. A 8-10, ECF \n19 93-1.) \n20   Professional  Therapeutic  Foster  Parenting:  DCYF  has  agreed  to  develop  and \n21 implement a contract and licensing category for therapeutic foster parent professionals \n22 who are trained to care for children with developmental disabilities or behavioral health \n23 needs and support reunification with families of origin. (Id. at 10-12.) \n24   Statewide Hub Home Model Program: DCYF has agreed to develop and implement a \n25 statewide Hub Home Model (HHM) program for foster, extended, and chosen families \n26 supporting foster children. (Id. at 12-14.) \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  11  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 13 of 16\n \n1 In addition, DCYF has agreed to implement a series of practice improvements for the \n2 benefit of children and their families. These include amending its licensing requirements for \n3 foster care placements to be more developmentally appropriate and flexible to meet the needs of \n4 individual youth; establishing a statewide Kinship Engagement Unit to identify and engage Class \n5 members’ extended family members and friends; developing referral and transition protocols; \n6 reviewing DCYF’s Shared Planning Meeting and Family Team Decision Meeting policies and \n7 practices for possible revision following stakeholder feedback, including to elicit and value child \n8 and family’s preferences and decisions; and establishing a more comprehensive evaluation \n9 process for determining whether it is appropriate and necessary to place a child in a group care \n10 facility. Id. at 14-18. \n11 Each of these system improvements improve the likelihood that the needs of the Class \n12 are better met, that children are supported in appropriate placements, and that children are better \n13 able to remain or reunify with their families.  \n14 As described above, the Settlement Agreement also establishes procedural safeguards to \n15 oversee the implementation of the Agreement, including the development of an Implementation \n16 Plan, the engagement of a qualified Stakeholder Facilitator to solicit stakeholder input regarding \n17 improvement efforts, and the appointment of a Monitor who will review on an ongoing basis \n18 data regarding DCYF’s performance, and will submit annual public reports on DCYF’s progress. \n19 Finally, the Settlement Agreement provides criteria the Judge should consider when determining \n20 whether DCYF has complied with the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Id. at 19-27. \n21 In considering whether “the relief provided for the class is adequate,” the Court must also \n22 consider “the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2); see also \n23 Officers for Just., 688 F.2d at 625. Class actions place an enormous financial burden upon the \n24 parties. Litigating this case through trial and any subsequent appeals would not only add further \n25 risk and expense, but substantially delay potential relief to Class members. In light of these \n26 considerations, the Parties’ Settlement Agreement affords the Class substantial benefits that far \nJOINT MOTION FOR FINAL  12  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n  \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 101   Filed 08/05/22   Page 14 of 16\n \n1 outweigh the costs, risks, and delay that would certainly result from trial and potential appeal on \n2 the merits.  \n3 D.  The Proposed Settlement Treats Class Members Identically. \n4 Finally, the Parties’ Settlement Agreement “treats class members equitably relative to \n5 each other.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(D). The Settlement does not differentiate between Class \n6 members but rather requires DCYF to make policy and practice improvements that benefit all \n7 Class members. The Settlement Agreement thus treats all Class members identically. \n8 VI.

Dkt. Nos. 57, 58. \n4  It is, therefore, \n5  ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED IN PART \n6  as follows: \n7  1.  No  later than September  1,  2021, Defendants will  submit a proposed plan for \n8  Plaintiffs' review for how Defendants will cease by November 1, 2021 using hotels, \n9  motels, or DCYF office space for youth in Department of Children, Youth, and \n10  Families (DCYF) custody under Wash.

Code §13.34 may spend the night \n12  hours (between 10 pm and 6 am) in cars (not including transport time). \n13  3.  Subject to the availability of hotel space, appropriate to the youth's health, welfare, \n14  and safety needs, no youth in DCYF custody under Wash. Rev. Code §13.34 may \n15  spend the night hours (between 10 pm and 6 am) in DCYF offices, with the following \n16  exception: in the event a youth returns to or enters DCYF custody between these \n17  hours, best efforts must be made to provide the youth with a hotel room to sleep for \n18  the remainder of the night. If this is not possible or some other emergency arises, a \n19  youth spending the night in a DCYF office must be provided with a pillow, blanket, \n20  and cot or other equivalent bedding. \n21  4.  Prior to November 1, 2021, subject to the availability of hotel space appropriate to \n22  the youth's health, welfare, and safety needs, youth in DCYF custody under Wash. \n23  Rev.

If the youth does not have an attorney or GAL/CASA, \n11  notice shall be provided to Plaintiffs' counsel at Disability Rights Washington. \n12  6.  Within two days of a youth's refusal of a foster care placement, the assigned case \n13  worker and/or supervisor shall conduct a Family Team Decision Meeting (FTDM) \n14  inviting the youth, the youth's attorney and GAUCASA, and the youth's family \n15  (unless the youth objects to the family being present due to specific safety concern) \n16  to seek a resolution. \n17  7.  For any youth who has been in an office or hotel stay, or a combination of office, \n18  hotel, and foster care placement intended to be night to night for five consecutive \n19  nights, DCYF must schedule a Shared Planning Meeting (SPM) for the earliest \n20  practicable date (but no later than three business days after the fifth night) and must \n21  invite the youth, the youth's attorney and GAL/CASA, the youth's family (unless the \n22  youth objects to the family being present due to specific safety concern), in addition \n23  to including the assigned case worker and the supervisor, placement desk staff, and \n24  other regional staff as appropriate. If the youth continues to be placed in hotel or \n25  office stays, an SPM shall be held every ten days thereafter until the youth is reunified \n26  with family or a long-term placement is identified. An SPM shall not be required \n3 \n\n1  when (1) the youth has rejected multiple placements authorized under Wash. Rev. \n2  Code § 13.34; (2) the Department determines and documents that the next SPM would \n3  not be productive;  and (3)  the youth  and  youth's  attorney  are  notified of the \n4  Department's determination and do not object. \n5  8.

The Court’s \n17 \npreliminary approval is subject to change pending the outcome of the final \n18 \nsettlement approval hearing established herein. \n19 \n2.  The Court finds that the Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement (“Notice”), \n20 \nattached as Exhibit B to the Declaration of Susan Kas, meets the requirements of \n21 \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, due process, and applicable law.

The Court’s \n17 \npreliminary approval is subject to change pending the outcome of the final \n18 \nsettlement approval hearing established herein. \n19 \n2.  The Court finds that the Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement (“Notice”), \n20 \nattached as Exhibit B to the Declaration of Susan Kas, meets the requirements of \n21 \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, due process, and applicable law.

Named Plaintiffs D.Y., D.S., and H.A.,1 by and through their next friends and \n19  acting on behalf of a class of children with behavioral health and developmental disabilities who \n20  are in the custody of Washington State’s child welfare system, and the non-profit organization, \n21  Disability Rights Washington (“DRW”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), bring this civil rights action \n22 \n23                                                   \n1 Plaintiffs will seek permission to use pseudonymous initials for the minor Named Plaintiffs. \n   \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 1  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 2 of 49\n \n1  against the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (“DCYF”) and its \n2  Secretary (“Defendants”).   \n3  2.  Children have a fundamental right to grow up in the care of their own families, \n4  absent imminent safety risks that cannot otherwise be resolved with appropriate supports.  The \n5  mission and objective of Washington State’s child welfare program is to help preserve and \n6  reunify families in a safe manner.  When the state does remove children from their homes, it \n7  owes them a duty of care to provide for their health, safety and well-being.  However, across the \n8  state, foster children with behavioral health and developmental disabilities are separated from \n9  their families because of Defendants’ failure to correct systemic deficiencies and maintain a \n10  system that ensures the provision of the services and supports they need to remain or reunify \n11  with their families.  Compounding the trauma associated with this separation, these children are \n12  enduring extreme and dehumanizing placement instability that has them cycling between \n13  temporary shelters, group homes, out-of-state facilities, one-night foster care stays, hotel stays, \n14  and government offices.  Far from ensuring children and families experience support and \n15  healing, DCYF’s practices are re-traumatizing children, destroying their ability to bond with and \n16  trust adults, interrupting delivery of mental health care, disrupting educational attainment, and \n17  extinguishing any hope that children and their families will have the long-term stability they \n18  need and deserve. \n19  3.  Named Plaintiffs D.Y., D.S., and H.A. and hundreds of other similarly-situated \n20  foster children with behavioral health and developmental disabilities have been deprived of the \n21  services and supports they need for family reunification or another permanent placement.  While \n22  removed from their families and communities, they have endured multiple days, weeks, or \n23  months when they were denied an actual placement altogether.  Instead, DCYF shuttled them \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 3 of 49\n \n1  between motels, one-night foster care stays, and DCYF offices.  This practice, known as \n2  “exceptional placements” or one-night stays, results from DCYF’s lack of a system to ensure \n3  stable placements in safe and supportive home environments, preferably with family.  \n4  Defendants’ actions have deprived Named Plaintiffs and many other children with disabilities of \n5  relationships with their families, while essentially rendering them homeless for extended periods \n6  of time.  \n7  4.  All too often the only alternative offered to Named Plaintiffs and other similarly \n8  situated children has been placement in a congregate care facility, where they are segregated \n9  with other youth who have behavioral health and developmental disabilities.  These congregate \n10  care programs provide what is called “Behavioral Rehabilitation Services” (BRS).  They are not \n11  permanent placements and are often located far away from children’s families and home \n12  communities.  If there are no available BRS programs, DCYF has placed some foster children in \n13  out-of-state institutions located hundreds if not thousands of miles away.  Despite knowledge of \n14  the severe harm to children associated with a lack of lasting nurturing relationships and extreme \n15  placement instability, Defendants have neglected to address their failure to support children with \n16  disabilities in being raised and nurtured by their own families.  Defendants have also failed to \n17  address their rapidly growing pattern and practice of using hotels, one-night stays, and offices to \n18  warehouse children in their custody, most of whom have behavioral health and developmental \n19  disabilities.     \n20  5.  First, Defendants have failed to correct systemic deficiencies and maintain a \n21  system to ensure children with disabilities have the necessary child welfare services and supports \n22  to allow them to return promptly and safely to their own families and communities.  For \n23  example, by denying children visitation with parents and siblings and case plans that address the \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 4 of 49\n \n1  services and supports needed for reunification, DCYF is failing to nurture the family unit, which \n2  should remain intact unless there is a direct threat to the child’s “basic nurture, physical and \n3  mental health, and safety.”  WASH. REV. CODE § 13.34.020 (1998).  Instead, DCYF engages in \n4  practices that deprive children of reasonable opportunities to form, repair, or maintain bonds \n5  with their families, which makes reunification more difficult, less likely, and painfully delayed.  \n6  Where reunification is not possible, DCYF is failing to provide stable and reliable supports \n7  necessary to address the trauma that children who have lost their families suffer.  Defendants’ \n8  failure is robbing children of the long-term, reliable connections that are essential for them to \n9  grow into healthy adults.   \n10  6.  Second, Defendants have failed to develop an adequate array of placement \n11  options to support the individualized needs of children in foster care with disabilities and provide \n12  them with a pathway to safely return home.  When children must be separated from their \n13  families, each child in DCYF’s custody is entitled to a “safe, stable, and permanent home and a \n14  speedy resolution” of their case.  Id.  But Defendants’ reliance on a patchwork of hotels, one-\n15  night stays, and government offices has instead become the default system for warehousing \n16  children with disabilities.  Defendants are failing to recruit, license, train, and support an \n17  adequate number of intensive foster care placements to address the individualized needs of \n18  children with disabilities and failing to hire, train, and support sufficient staff and service \n19  providers with appropriate expertise to support these placements.   \n20  7.  Defendants’ shadow foster care system comes with grave societal, economic, \n21  human, and moral costs.  For example, because of Defendants’ systemic failures, Plaintiff H.A. \n22  spent three years cycling through abusive out-of-state institutions, only to end up living in a \n23  DCYF office for several months before being placed in yet another temporary congregate care \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 4  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 5 of 49\n \n1  facility.  Today, he is no closer to being reunified with his family than when he was first shipped \n2  away to a pricey out-of-state residential care facility.  In addition to the staggering economic \n3  costs associated with prolonged institutionalization and hotel usage, Defendants’ systemic \n4  failures are exacting a harrowing toll on children and families.   \n5  8.  Because the very system designated to protect and heal children instead causes \n6  them harm and exacerbates their trauma, growing up in “the system” is all too often the fate of \n7  foster children with behavioral health and developmental disabilities.  Rather than providing \n8  them the supports they need to be loved and cared for by their own families—a need that every \n9  child has—Defendants have turned to restrictive, isolating, and inhumane practices that unfairly \n10  punish children for exhibiting behaviors that bear the signs of their accumulating trauma and \n11  disabilities.  This vicious cycle must come to an end.  As one Washington foster child explained \n12  in an interview about his experience being placed in an out-of-state institution, “It’s not easy \n13  being a foster kid.  You don’t know anyone’s story.  So don’t judge them by how they may act \n14  or how they may look because they could have something really bad going on in their life.” \n15  Susannah Frame, Report finds prison-like conditions for Washington foster kids sent out of state, \n16  KING 5 NEWS (Oct. 18, 2018, 11:14 PM PDT), https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/report-\n17  finds-prison-like-conditions-for-washington-foster-kids-sent-out-of-state/281-605444408. \n18  9.  Defendants’ failures violate the rights of disabled foster children under the United \n19  States Constitution, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 \n20  et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation Act”), 29 U.S.C. § 794 et \n21  seq., and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), 42 U.S.C. \n22  §§ 621 et seq., 670 et seq.  To redress these ongoing violations, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and \n23  injunctive relief on behalf of themselves, DRW’s constituents, and the putative Class.  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 5  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 6 of 49\n \n1  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2  10.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises \n3  under the laws of the United States, and under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3) and (4), which confer on \n4  the federal district courts original jurisdiction over all claims asserted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n5  § 1983 to redress deprivations of rights, privileges, or immunities guaranteed by Acts of \n6  Congress and the United States Constitution.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive \n7  relief are authorized under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules \n8  of Civil Procedure. \n9  11.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  A substantial part of the events \n10  or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in the Western District of Washington and \n11  Defendants may be found here. \n12  III.   PARTIES \n13  12.  Plaintiff D.Y. is a thirteen-year-old child who is currently in DCYF foster care \n14  custody and is now in his fiftieth foster care placement.

H.A. \n2  has been in DCYF’s custody for five years.  Over the years, he has been diagnosed by various \n3  clinicians with numerous conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention \n4  Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Mood Disorder Not \n5  Otherwise Specified, and he is viewed by DCYF as having a behavioral health and \n6  developmental disability.  H.A. currently resides in Pierce County, in this judicial district.  \n7  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), he is represented in this action by his Next \n8  Friend, Kristen Bishopp.  Kristen Bishopp is sufficiently familiar with the facts of H.A.’s \n9  situation and is dedicated to fairly and adequately representing H.A.’s interests in this litigation. \n10  14.  Plaintiff D.S. is a sixteen-year-old transgender youth who is currently in DCYF \n11  foster care custody and is an enrolled member of the Council of Tlingit and Haida Tribes of \n12  Alaska through her biological father.  D.S. has been in DCYF custody for nine months.  D.S. has \n13  not had a stable placement since April 2020, and is currently cycling between one-night stays, \n14  hotels, and DCYF offices.  D.S. has been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, and is viewed \n15  by DCF as having a behavioral health disability.  D.S. is from and is currently residing in King \n16  County, in this judicial district.

Tara Urs is sufficiently familiar with the \n18  facts of D.S.’s situation and is dedicated to fairly and adequately representing D.S.’s interests in \n19  this litigation. \n20  15.  Plaintiff Disability Rights Washington, a nonprofit corporation duly organized \n21  under the laws of the State of Washington, is the statewide protection and advocacy system \n22  designated by the Governor of the State of Washington to protect and advocate for the legal and \n23  civil rights of those residents of this state who have disabilities, pursuant to the Developmental \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 7  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 8 of 49\n \n1  Disabilities (DD) Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 15041-45, the Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with \n2  Mental Illness (PAIMI) Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-51, and WASH. REV. CODE § 71A.10.080(2).  \n3  DRW is governed by a board of directors comprised predominantly of people with disabilities \n4  and their family members.  This board is advised by two advisory councils, the Disability \n5  Advisory Council and the statutorily mandated Mental Health Advisory Council, also primarily \n6  comprised of people with disabilities and their family members.  DRW’s constituents include \n7  people with disabilities across Washington, including, but not limited to, Plaintiffs D.Y., A.H., \n8  and D.S. and other Washington foster children with behavioral health and developmental \n9  disabilities.  DRW provides services statewide, including in this judicial district.  \n10  16.  Defendant DCYF is the state agency whose mandate is to ensure the rights of \n11  children to “a safe, stable, and permanent home.”  WASH. REV. CODE § 13.34.020 (1998).  This \n12  mandate declares that “the family unit is a fundamental resource of American life which should \n13  be nurtured.”  Id.  DCYF is charged with the care and custody of the Named Plaintiffs, putative \n14  Class Members, and DRW constituents who have been separated from their families.  DCYF is a \n15  public entity that receives federal funding under Title IV-E and Title XIX of the Social Security \n16  Act to serve foster children.  \n17  17.  Defendant Ross Hunter is sued in his official capacity as the Secretary of DCYF.  \n18  Secretary Hunter is responsible for developing and administering or supervising the child welfare \n19  program activities, which includes the care and placement of foster children as well as the \n20  services delivered to their families.  All alleged acts and omissions by Secretary Hunter and \n21  DCYF were taken under color of state law.  \n22 \n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 8  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 9 of 49\n \n1  IV.  CLASS ALLEGATIONS \n2  18.  Named Plaintiffs D.Y., H.A., and D.S. bring this action pursuant to Federal Rule \n3  of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2) on behalf of themselves and the following similarly situated \n4  proposed Class: \n5  All minors who are now, or in the future will be, in DCYF custody pursuant to Chapter \n6  13.34 of the Revised Code of Washington and who now, or in the future will, have a \n7  behavioral health and/or developmental disability.2 \n8  19.  The class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder of all members impracticable.  \n9  20.  According to DCYF data, there are approximately 8,100 children in foster care.  \n10  Washington’s most recent Adoption and Foster Care Statistics (“AFCARS”) data indicates that \n11  approximately 28% of youth who exited foster care in 2018 had a diagnosed disability. \n12  21.  A 2020 report issued by the Washington State Family and Children’s Ombuds \n13  (“OFCO”) indicated that, in 2020, 220 youth experienced “placement exceptions,” meaning that \n14  hotels or DCYF offices were used as emergency placements.

The common questions of fact shared by the Named Plaintiffs and the members of \n5  the Class they seek to represent include, but are not limited to: (1) whether Defendants have a \n6  pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of failing to ensure Class Members have visitation with \n7  parents and siblings and access to an adequate array of support services and placements \n8  necessary for family reunification or other permanency; (2) whether Defendants have a pattern, \n9  custom, policy, and/or practice of failing to develop case plans that (a) address treatment, \n10  services and supports to assure that children receive safe, stable, and appropriate placements and \n11  safe and proper care while in foster care, (b) facilitate reunification of children with their own \n12  families or with another permanent placement, and (c) ensure educational stability; and \n13  (3) whether Defendants have a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of failing to develop an \n14  adequate placement array and instead utilizing inappropriate hotel stays, office stays, one-night \n15  stays, and out-of-state placements, exposing the Class to psychological, emotional, and physical \n16  harm and/or an ongoing immediate risk of such harm. \n17  25.  The common questions of law shared by the Named Plaintiffs and members of the \n18  Class they seek to represent include, but are not limited to: (1) whether Defendants’ pattern, \n19  custom, policy, and/or practice of failing to ensure Class Members have visitation with parents \n20  and siblings and access to an adequate array of support services and placements necessary for \n21  family reunification or other permanency subject the Class to continuing deprivation or risk of \n22  deprivation of their rights conferred by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the \n23  Rehabilitation Act, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, and the Fourteenth \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 10  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 11 of 49\n \n1  Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) whether Defendants’ failure to develop case \n2  plans that (a) address treatment, services, and supports to assure that children receive safe, \n3  stable, and appropriate placements and safe and proper care while in foster care, (b) facilitate \n4  reunification of children with their own families or with another permanent placement, and \n5  (c) ensure educational stability subjects the Class to continuing deprivation or risk of \n6  deprivation of their rights conferred by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act; and \n7  (3) whether Defendants’ pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice of failing to develop an \n8  adequate placement array resulting in severe placement instability subject the Class to a \n9  continuing deprivation or risk of deprivation of their rights conferred by the Americans with \n10  Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Adoption Assistance and Child \n11  Welfare Act of 1980, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n12  26.   The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class.  \n13  There are no conflicts of interest between the Named Plaintiffs and other Class Members.  The \n14  Named Plaintiffs will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the Class.  The Named \n15  Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill and experience in civil \n16  rights and class action litigation, who will vigorously prosecute this case on behalf of the Class. \n17  27.  Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \n18  entire Class, and their patterns, customs, policies and/or practices harm and/or present an \n19  ongoing imminent risk of harm to all members of the Class.  Accordingly, final injunctive and \n20  declaratory relief is appropriate for the Class as a whole.   \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 12 of 49\n \n1  V.  NAMED PLAINTIFF FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS   \n2  Plaintiff D.Y. \n3  28.  Plaintiff D.Y. was separated from his family in 2016 based upon allegations of \n4  abuse.  Having been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, D.Y. has unique needs that \n5  DCYF has failed to meet and indeed has exacerbated.  After taking him from his mother, DCYF \n6  placed D.Y. in thirty different foster and group homes located all over the state.  In addition, \n7  DCYF has forced D.Y. to stay in a hotel and/or DCYF office on at least twenty separate \n8  occasions.  These episodes lasted from one to two nights, to a week, to even almost two \n9  consecutive months.  \n10  29.  A case note written by a DCYF case manager in April 2018 provides a summary \n11  of D.Y.’s life as a foster child in the care of DCYF: \n12  [D.Y.’s] placement has been unstable since November 2017. He left Ryther \nfollowing a 30 day discharge notice, then was night-to-night for 3 weeks, then at \n13  Helping Hands in Spokane for a month, then following a 30 day discharge notice \n[D.Y.] went to a [Behavioral Rehabilitation Services] home in Yakima; the \n14  placement in Yakima did not last even 30 days.  [D.Y.] is back in night-to-night \nplacements.  He is not currently enrolled in school because the local school cannot \n15  meet the needs in his [Individual Education Plan], so [D.Y.] is spending his days \nat the Kent CPS office.  [D.Y.] needs a stable placement where he can safely \n16  spend his days and nights.  \n \n17  30.  In November 2018, D.Y. was placed in a foster home, but he then moved to \n18  another foster home in January 2019.  While at this placement, he received in-home behavior \n19  services and had visits with his parents every other week.  During one visit with his mother, \n20  D.Y. told her, “I don’t want to get adopted.”  His mother sought a reunification plan, but despite \n21  returning one of D.Y.’s siblings to her custody, DCYF refused her request to pursue \n22  reunification with D.Y. because it determined she was not capable of meeting his complex \n23  behavioral needs.  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 12  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 13 of 49\n \n1  31.  In June of 2019, D.Y.’s foster home gave notice that they could no longer keep \n2  him due to his behavioral health symptoms, and his placement ended on July 31, 2019.  Over \n3  the next three and a half months, D.Y. again bounced between short hotel stays, one-night foster \n4  care stays, and foster placements that would last for only a few weeks at a time.  \n5  32.  In November 2019, DCYF placed D.Y. in a BRS congregate care program that \n6  had been designated as a Qualified Residential Treatment Program (“QRTP”), based on its own \n7  determination that this placement was necessary.  D.Y. sought a less restrictive placement with \n8  another sibling, and the dependency court ordered that DCYF was required to make efforts to \n9  place the siblings together or to “develop a solid plan regarding how [D.Y.] can be discharged \n10  from the QRTP program.”  \n11  33.  DCYF did not create a plan for reunifying the siblings or discharging D.Y. from \n12  the QRTP program, where he remains.  D.Y. continues to be separated from his family while in \n13  this program.  In-person family visitations were suspended for several months due to the \n14  QRTP’s COVID restrictions, and due to scheduling and technical issues, many virtual visits did \n15  not take place, or were cut short.  \n16  34.  As of July 2020, D.Y.’s permanency plan was still to return home by fall 2020, \n17  and D.Y. had no prospects for long-term foster care or adoption.  However, although DCYF had \n18  no other plans for providing D.Y. with a stable, long-term home, DCYF filed a petition to \n19  terminate both of his parents’ rights on May 8, 2020, asserting that termination is in his best \n20  interest because he is “adoptable” and “cannot be adopted unless parental rights are terminated.”  \n21  35.  In January 2021, there was a permanency planning hearing.  The dependency \n22  court found, “The Department has not made the efforts to prepare the child for return home or \n23  placement with a relative, legal guardian, adoptive parent, or foster family home” because it \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 13  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 14 of 49\n \n1  “had not identified what needs to be done to prepare the child for return home or to another less \n2  restrictive placement.”  The Permanency Planning Order confirmed reunification as the primary \n3  permanency plan, although DCYF proposed to make adoption D.Y.’s primary permanency plan \n4  and has continued to assert that he cannot reunify with his mother due to her inability to manage \n5  his exceptional needs.  DCYF has not offered or provided any in-home behavioral health \n6  services for D.Y. to facilitate a safe return home. \n7  36.  Defendants’ actions, inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices have \n8  violated and continue to violate D.Y.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights.  Defendants \n9  have failed to protect D.Y. from harm and a risk of harm by denying visitation, case planning, \n10  and support services and placements necessary for family reunification or other permanency and \n11  by utilizing inappropriate hotel stays, office stays, one-night stays, short-term placements, \n12  and/or out-of-state placements. \n13  Plaintiff H.A. \n14  37.  Plaintiff H.A. was removed from his mother’s care in November 2015, when he \n15  was eleven years old.  Within the first month that he was in DCYF custody, H.A. changed foster \n16  care placements three times before being placed for a year in a residential treatment program in \n17  Seattle.  Upon discharge from the residential program in December 2016, H.A. was placed in a \n18  group home for two weeks and then sent to a juvenile detention center.  After he was released \n19  the next day, DCYF placed him in four separate short-term foster homes over the following nine \n20  days.  Although DCYF then placed him in another group home, his social worker sought an out-\n21  of-state placement for him because there were “not openings” and an “unfortunate amount of \n22  declines” for him.  \n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 14  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 15 of 49\n \n1  38.  At a planning meeting on December 14, 2016, H.A.’s mother reported she “would \n2  like [H.A.] to come home at some time but they do not have a bond at this time,” and expressed \n3  concerns that “she would be unable to protect her children and [H.A] at her home at this time.”  \n4  DCYF did not offer or provide in-home services that would help rebuild a parent-child bond or \n5  enable H.A.’s mother to safely care for him and his siblings.  Instead, DCYF removed H.A. \n6  from the Washington program where he was living and placed him at Mountain Home Academy \n7  in Idaho, run by Sequel Youth and Family Services, in January 2017.  \n8  39.  Soon after H.A. left Washington, he told his DCYF social worker about a painful \n9  restraint incident.  H.A. continued to struggle over the next few months and was reportedly \n10  restrained 23 times in the first two months.  He continued to suffer frequent and severe physical \n11  restraints, which were often unjustified and abusive.  He reported these to his social worker, \n12  who did not investigate his treatment.  \n13  40.  While H.A. was in Idaho, the permanency plan continued to be to return home.  \n14  However, H.A.’s opportunities to visit with his mother and siblings were extremely limited \n15  because he was placed out of state.  In March 2018, DCYF held a planning meeting that did not \n16  identify any permanency plan, but noted that his behaviors were increasing “due to being \n17  anxious [and] wanting out” of the facility.  In April 2018, one of the Washington social workers \n18  wrote in a case note about concerns that H.A. was not making progress and observed: “The \n19  facility, SEQUEL is located in Idaho and is punitive and leaves little room for a child to be a \n20  child.”  However, the social worker did not investigate, and Washington kept H.A. in the facility \n21  and continued to place other foster children there.  \n22  41.  On June 15, 2018, H.A. was transferred to another treatment facility in Tennessee.  \n23  During his June planning meeting, his team again failed to identify any permanency plan, but \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 15  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 16 of 49\n \n1  did document the placement decision to continue group care at the new facility.  That facility \n2  gave a notice of termination of the placement soon after H.A. was admitted.  \n3  42.  In August 2018, DCYF held a meeting with two mental health professionals to \n4  discuss options for H.A. and a potential inpatient admission in one of Washington’s long-term \n5  psychiatric facilities for children.  The meeting minutes stated the clinicians’ opinions that long-\n6  term inpatient treatment was “not appropriate” and that “the appropriate and proven to be \n7  successful treatment for [H.A.] would be Multisystemic Therapy (MST) at his parental home or \n8  at a foster placement where the focus would be on the family.”  In the alternative, the clinicians \n9  indicated their opinions that if H.A. could be placed in a BRS home with a 24-hour case aide \n10  and supervision, MST could also be provided, which they believed would benefit H.A. \n11  43.  H.A.’s mother suggested that H.A. be placed with a particular individual with \n12  whom H.A. had previously been placed, but H.A.’s DCYF social worker rejected her \n13  suggestion, as well as the clinician’s suggestion that he be placed in a Washington group home \n14  with MST, because the DCYF social worker determined he needed a more restrictive level of \n15  care.  Over the recommendations of the two mental health clinicians, DCYF refused to place \n16  H.A. in a more integrated setting that the clinical professionals had determined to be more \n17  appropriate, and obtained another out-of-state placement at a facility in Utah.  \n18  44.  H.A. was transferred to the treatment facility in Utah in October 2018.  The \n19  November planning meeting again identified no permanency plan for H.A., but documented that \n20  H.A. wanted more visits with his mother and visits with his siblings.  The appointed Guardian \n21  ad Litem recommended that he be placed in a BRS home in Washington because “[b]eing so far \n22  away from family is usually not conducive for reunification.”  The Guardian ad Litem further \n23  reasoned that “[e]ven if reunification cannot be achieved, [H.A.] would still appear better served \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 17 of 49\n \n1  if he came to Washington State so he could be closer to family.”  DCYF ignored these \n2  recommendations and continued confining H.A. at the facility in Utah. \n3  45.  While in Utah, H.A. continued to experience painful physical restraints for \n4  unjustified reasons.  H.A. reported at his April 2019 planning meeting that he would like to go \n5  home and was “concerned about the use of restraint in his current facility,” but once again, \n6  DCYF did not investigate and documented no permanency plan for him.  H.A. later reported the \n7  restraints to the contracted social worker and to DCYF, who again, failed to investigate his \n8  allegations. \n9  46.  In October 2019, at the request of his appointed counsel, H.A. was referred for a \n10  Foster Care Assessment Program (“FCAP”) evaluation “regarding permanency” and specifically \n11  whether he should “move to a less restrictive setting.”  The evaluator concluded that H.A. had \n12  been receiving inadequate treatment at the Utah facility, where he spent “most of his day \n13  isolated in his room,” and recommended that he be returned to Washington as soon as possible \n14  where he should be provided evidence-based treatment to address his depressive symptoms.  \n15  47.   DCYF held a planning meeting on January 21, 2020 to discuss H.A.’s court-\n16  ordered transition back to Washington.  The new placement was discussed, but no permanency \n17  plan was identified.  \n18  48.  H.A. was placed in a group home in Washington on January 27, 2020, where he \n19  stayed for six months.  At a planning meeting in April, it was noted that his permanency plan is \n20  “long term foster [c]are and [Extended Foster Care].”  H.A. ran away from the group home on \n21  June 7 and was missing from care until July 2, when a family friend who identified as his fictive \n22  kin “uncle” called to report that H.A. had been staying with him.  Law enforcement picked H.A. \n23  up a few days later and he was placed in a foster home, where he reportedly did very well.  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 17  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 18 of 49\n \n1  However, this was a temporary placement, and the foster parents chose to terminate services on \n2  July 31, 2020. \n3  49.  For almost a full month, DCYF provided no other home for H.A., and he lived in \n4  DCYF offices with no therapeutic or structured activities.  When she had time, his social worker \n5  would take him to appointments or brief outings, but for the most part, he spent his days \n6  sleeping or playing video games.  Although H.A. was able to sleep in a hotel for a few nights, he \n7  spent most nights at the DCYF office sleeping on a couch.  He continued to live this way until \n8  August 26, when he was arrested for allegedly assaulting another teen living in the office with \n9  him.  He was released a day later and continued living at the DCYF office until September 11, \n10  2020. \n11  50.  In September 2020, H.A. was placed in a group home in Tacoma pursuant to an \n12  Emergent Placement Services Contract.  It took several months for H.A. to get enrolled in \n13  school.  Due to lack of transportation, his mother, who lives several hours away, has been \n14  unable to consistently visit him.  Although his permanency plan is to return home, as of this \n15  filing, he is receiving no services to facilitate reunification with his family.  \n16  51.  Defendants’ actions, inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices have \n17  violated and continue to violate H.A.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights.  Defendants \n18  have failed to protect H.A. from harm and a risk of harm by denying visitation, case planning, \n19  and support services and placements necessary for family reunification or other permanency and \n20  by utilizing inappropriate hotel stays, office stays, one-night stays, short-term placements, \n21  and/or out-of-state placements. \n22 \n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 18  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 19 of 49\n \n1  Plaintiff D.S. \n2  52.  Plaintiff D.S. was adopted in May 2009 by her maternal biological aunt and uncle \n3  after her biological parents’ rights were terminated.  In 2019, she was sentenced to 455 days in \n4  one of DCYF’s Juvenile Rehabilitation Centers.  After she finished serving her sentence, her \n5  adoptive parents, who had been caring for her since she was an infant, refused to care for her.  \n6  As D.S. was completing her sentence, one of her “homework” assignments was to “look for \n7  people who may be able to let her live in their custody from her local community,” but she “did \n8  not find anybody that was a viable option.”  \n9  53.  Upon release from the Juvenile Rehabilitation Center, D.S. was again found \n10  dependent due to having no parent capable of meeting her needs, and placed in DCYF custody.  \n11  Because DCYF had no suitable placement for her, D.S. was released on April 10, 2020, to a \n12  temporary youth shelter serving as an “emergency crisis placement.”  \n13  54.  D.S. had previously been diagnosed with “a mental health diagnosis of \n14  Depression with severe psychotic features, generalized anxiety disorder and intermittent \n15  explosive disorder” during an inpatient hospitalization for suicidal ideations.  DCYF \n16  documented that she disclosed her mental health conditions upon entering its custody and \n17  expressed a desire to begin mental health therapy and to continue receiving medication \n18  management to address her mental health.  The plan was that she would be referred for mental \n19  health services “once there is a stable placement.” \n20  55.  The temporary shelter where DCYF placed D.S. turned out to be a nightmare for \n21  her.  She was isolated from her family, denied access to mental health therapy, and could not \n22  attend school.  As a trans girl, D.S. requested an alternative placement due to the lack of gender-\n23  affirming care in the shelter and being bullied by other youth who made her feel scared and \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 19  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 20 of 49\n \n1  physically unsafe.  She reported that in addition to not receiving any mental health care, a staff \n2  member had stated to her: “You’re always going to be a boy. Stop acting like a girl.”  Although \n3  DCYF acknowledged that this placement was not its preference for D.S., the agency claimed \n4  that it had no other options at that time and required that she continue living in this setting.  \n5  56.  On May 8, 2020, D.S. left the emergency shelter where she was being forced to \n6  live, but because the shelter had a COVID-19 outbreak, she had to quarantine at a DCYF office \n7  for two days due to her exposure while at the shelter.  With no other placement options, she \n8  began living at DCYF offices and hotels.  She slept in hotels at night and spent her days in a \n9  DCYF office lobby where other youth with COVID-19 exposure and infection had also been \n10  placed.  While living in these conditions, D.S.’s mental health medication was often not \n11  available, and she was not provided with the medical and mental health appointments she \n12  needed.  DCYF briefly placed her at a BRS facility in Yakima as an emergency short-term stay, \n13  but when that placement ended, she resumed living in various DCYF offices and hotels.  \n14  57.  On June 12, 2020, DCYF held a shared planning meeting to discuss placement.  \n15  Although D.S. had no parole or conditions of release from the Juvenile Rehabilitation Center, \n16  DCYF insisted that she submit to a stringent supervision plan that was highly restrictive for \n17  D.S., as well as extremely onerous for any placement resource to implement.  Because the \n18  supervision plan was a barrier to D.S. finding a suitable placement, D.S. and her adoptive \n19  mother asked that DCYF relax the supervision requirements.  However, DCYF insisted, “it is \n20  required, and as her guardians the department has a say in it.”   \n21  58.  Throughout her dependency, D.S. has expressed her desire to be placed in a \n22  LGBTQ-supportive family home rather than a group home.  Although her adoptive parents have \n23  stated that she cannot return home, D.S. has continued to seek close contact with her mother. \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 20  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 21 of 49\n \n1  Without a stable placement close to her family’s community, D.S. has been faced with \n2  continuous obstacles to maintain this relationship.  DCYF has failed to provide her with stable \n3  local and gender-affirming care that she needs to be safe, stay connected with her family, and \n4  work towards integrating into another stable and permanent home.  Instead of delivering the \n5  care she needs, DCYF searched for group home placements across Washington as well as out of \n6  state.  At one point in July 2020, when D.S. resisted DCYF’s attempt to place her at an all-boys \n7  facility, DCYF forced her to spend the night in a DCYF social worker’s car, parked outside one \n8  of the DCYF offices.  \n9  59.  D.S. still has no stable placement and has made no progress towards permanency.  \n10  Over the past several months, she has been spending her days in a DCYF office and her nights \n11  either in a hotel or a one-night placement that lasts from 7 PM to 7 AM.  On numerous \n12  occasions, she has had to sleep at the DCYF office because Defendants did not provide a hotel \n13  or one-night placement.  She is not currently participating in school because she does not have \n14  access to a computer to enable virtual attendance and she has no other structured activities \n15  during the day.  \n16  60.  Defendants’ actions, inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices have \n17  violated and continue to violate D.S.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights.  Defendants \n18  have failed to protect D.S. from harm and a risk of harm by denying visitation, case planning, \n19  and support services and placements necessary for family reunification or other permanency and \n20  by utilizing inappropriate hotel stays, office stays, one-night stays, short-term placements, \n21  and/or out-of-state placements. \n22 \n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 22 of 49\n \n1  Plaintiff Disability Rights Washington \n2  61.  Plaintiff DRW serves as the protection and advocacy system for the State of \n3  Washington.  As such, DRW is mandated under the DD and PAIMI Acts to investigate \n4  allegations of abuse and neglect, including allegations of inadequate services and failure to \n5  implement care or discharge plans.  DRW’s federal mandates provide for broad access authority \n6  to access records, treatment facilities, and individuals for purposes of monitoring conditions, \n7  providing outreach to constituents, and investigating alleged abuse and neglect.  Congress \n8  provided this access based on its findings that individuals with developmental disabilities \n9  deserve support to “achieve full integration” and that “State systems for monitoring compliance \n10  with respect to the rights of individuals with mental illness vary widely and are frequently \n11  inadequate.”  DRW’s constituents include the three Named Plaintiffs and other foster children in \n12  DCYF custody who have behavioral health and developmental disabilities. \n13  62.  DRW has received and is responsible for investigating complaints about other \n14  constituents of DRW who are facing fates similar to those faced by the Named Plaintiffs.  \n15  Specifically, DRW has continued to receive credible allegations regarding DCYF’s failure to \n16  provide DRW constituents with behavioral and developmental disabilities—including, but not \n17  limited to, the three Named Plaintiffs—with adequate housing, care, and supports to reunify \n18  with their families or otherwise find permanency and stability.  Additionally, DRW has \n19  investigated and found evidence of abuse and neglect of foster children with disabilities placed \n20  in out-of-state facilities.  For example, after discovering that there were several children placed \n21  in Iowa institutions, DRW diverted its limited resources to conduct onsite outreach and \n22  monitoring at these facilities.  DRW learned that most of the youth placed in these institutions \n23  had no or very limited contact with their Washington social workers and heard allegations from \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 22  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 23 of 49\n \n1  many of the youth about abusive conditions.  As the designated Protection and Advocacy \n2  system for these children, DRW diverted additional resources to investigate these allegations, \n3  and issued a 2018 report, “Let Us Come Home,” about the use of abusive practices at one of the \n4  institutions, Clarinda Academy.  See DISABILITY RIGHTS WASHINGTON, WASHINGTON’S OUT-\n5  OF-STATE YOUTH PLEAD: LET US COME HOME (2018), \n6  https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/reports/let-us-come-home/. \n7  63.  DRW continued monitoring out-of-state facilities where DCYF has been placing \n8  foster children with disabilities.  DRW asked DCYF to stop placing youth in facilities owned by \n9  Sequel Youth and Families, the same company that owned Clarinda Academy, after a child died \n10  in the spring of 2020 at the hands of staff restraining him at a Sequel-owned institution in \n11  Michigan.  See Tyler Kingkade, Video shows fatal restraint of Cornelius Frederick, 16, at \n12  Michigan foster facility, NBC NEWS (July 22, 2020, 3:05 PM PDT), \n13  https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/video-shows-fatal-restraint-cornelius-fredericks-16-\n14  michigan-foster-facility-n1233122.  Based on its own monitoring and investigations—as well as \n15  an abundant collection of additional reports by investigative reporters, other Protection and \n16  Advocacy systems, and state licensing agencies—about physical, emotional, and sexual abuse \n17  occurring in other Sequel-owned facilities across the country, DRW diverted its limited \n18  resources to spend several weeks gathering support from other child welfare advocates as well \n19  as the public to join in their demand for DCYF to stop sending foster children needing mental \n20  health treatment to out-of-state Sequel facilities.  In December 2020, DCYF eventually decided \n21  to stop placing youth in Sequel facilities, but it has not stopped placing youth in other out-of-\n22  state institutions.  DCYF claims that this practice may never end for children with “specialized \n23  needs.”  Rachel Nielsen, Washington Misses Its Deadline To Bring Foster Kids Home From \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 23  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 24 of 49\n \n1  Troubled Out-Of-State Group Facilities, INVESTIGATEWEST (Dec. 3, 2020, 7:20 PM), \n2  https://www.invw.org/2020/12/02/washington-misses-its-deadline-to-bring-foster-kids-home-\n3  from-troubled-out-of-state-group-facilities/.   \n4  64.  Investigating and addressing complaints and allegations when a child is \n5  experiencing placement instability or placed out of state is extremely resource- and time-\n6  intensive for DRW staff.  Being able to meet with and privately communicate with constituents \n7  is challenging when constituents are frequently moved with little notice, and establishing and \n8  maintaining contact with individuals who are in out-of-state facilities is difficult due to distance.  \n9  Moreover, monitoring out-of-state facilities requires many times more resources than \n10  monitoring in-state facilities, which are easier to access due to their location as well as \n11  familiarity with DRW’s access authority.  In sum, out-of-state and exceptional placements \n12  require that DRW divert its limited resources to provide services to constituents in unstable or \n13  distant settings and impair DRW’s ability to efficiently and effectively serve its constituents \n14  subjected to these conditions. \n15  65.  Because DRW’s constituency includes the Named Plaintiffs and other foster \n16  children with disabilities who are suffering from prolonged separation from their families and \n17  communities and inappropriate placements, the interests of DRW and the affected individuals in \n18  this case are aligned.  DRW and its constituents have and are being injured by Defendants’ \n19  conduct.  As such, DRW has direct standing as well as associational standing in this matter \n20  under Hunt v. Wash.

FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nFRAMEWORK \n2   \n66.  Parents and children have a fundamental liberty interest in being with their \n3 \nfamilies.  This “substantive due process right to family integrity or to familial association is well \n4 \nestablished.”  Rosenbaum v. Washoe Cty., 663 F.3d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 2011).  The U.S. \n5 \nConstitution protects family relationships as “highly personal relationships” that are owed a \n6 \n“substantial measure of sanctuary from unjustified interference by the State.”  Roberts v. U.S. \n7 \nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 618 (1984); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982) \n8 \n(holding that parents and children have a well-elaborated constitutional right to live together \n9 \nwithout government interference); Ching v. Mayorkas, 725 F.3d 1149, 1157 (9th Cir. 2013) \n10 \n(“The right to live with and not be separated from one’s immediate family is ‘a right that ranks \n11 \nhigh among the interests of the individual’”); D.B. v.

States may only interfere with family relationships when necessary to protect the \n18 \nhealth, safety, and welfare of children who would otherwise be harmed by their parents’ \n19 \nmaltreatment.  Indeed, in passing the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, \n20 \nCongress made “clear that States must make reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of \n21 \nchildren from their homes … through the provision of home-based services … before removing \n22 \nthe child and turning to foster care.”  126 CONG.

REP. NO. 96-136, at 6 (1979) (“[N]o child will be placed in foster care, except in \n2  emergency situations, either voluntarily or involuntarily, unless services aimed at preventing the \n3  need for placement have been provided or refused by the family.”).  More recently, Congress \n4  passed the Families First Prevention Services Act of 2018 (“FFPSA”), which provides federal \n5  funding for child welfare services to “prevent foster care placements through the provision of \n6  mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services, in-home parent skill-based \n7  programs, and kinship navigator services.”  Family First Prevention Services Act, Pub. L. No. \n8  115-123, § 50702, 132 Stat. 132 (2018). \n9  68.  When necessary to interfere with children’s relationships with their parents, the \n10  State assumes a “special relationship” with the children who have been separated from their \n11  own families, which imposes a Constitutional duty of care on the State to provide for the \n12  children’s health, safety, and well-being.  States must exercise professional judgment and refrain \n13  from taking actions that fall below professional standards of care or ignoring known or obvious \n14  risks of harm.  Henry A. v. Willden, 678 F.3d 991, 998 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal citations \n15  omitted); see also DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 197-202 \n16  (1989). \n17  69.  DCYF is designated as the State child welfare agency responsible for delivering \n18  and coordinating services to children and their parents in Washington State.  Under Chapter \n19  13.34 of the Revised Code of Washington, DCYF is authorized to separate families and take \n20  custody of “dependent children” who have been abandoned, are being abused or neglected, or \n21  are in dangerous circumstances due to having no parent capable of adequately caring for them.  \n22  DCYF’s overarching purpose is to ensure “children and youth grow up safe and healthy—\n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 26  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 27 of 49\n \n1  thriving physically, emotionally, academically, nurtured by family and community.”  H.B. 1661, \n2  65th Leg., 3d Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2017). \n3  70.  To achieve this objective, DCYF receives federal funding under Title IV-E and \n4  Title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide for foster care, adoption assistance, and supports \n5  to kinship guardians, as well as behavioral health services.  States that receive federal funding \n6  under Title IV-E must ensure that each child in foster care has a written case plan that, among \n7  other things, ensures that the child receives safe and appropriate care and placements while in \n8  foster care, and that services are provided to the child and their parents to facilitate the child’s \n9  safe return home.  42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1).  In addition to family preservation services \n10  and remedial services designed to help separated families reunify and remain intact, DCYF also \n11  provides residential services for children in foster and kinship care settings and in congregate \n12  care settings that are part of its Behavioral Rehabilitation Services program for children with \n13  complex physical and emotional conditions that result in high-level needs.  DCYF also provides \n14  residential and behavioral health services in out-of-state institutions, which are supposed to be \n15  used only as a last resort. \n16  71.  Under the recently enacted FFPSA, Congress further amended Title IV-E to \n17  include protections against overuse of congregate care settings as well as to promote services to \n18  prevent the need for foster care.  In order for a congregate care placement to qualify for Title \n19  IV-E funding, the provider must be accredited as a QRTP and the placement of each child in a \n20  congregate care program must be pursuant to an approved evaluation process.  Although the \n21  FFPSA requires that the evaluation be completed by a qualified professional who is unaffiliated \n22  with the child welfare agency, states may seek a waiver of the “independent” evaluator \n23  requirement.    \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 27  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 28 of 49\n \n1  72.  Under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“Title II”), “no qualified \n2  individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in \n3  or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be \n4  subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Section 504 of the \n5  Rehabilitation Act similarly precludes discrimination against people with disabilities by entities \n6  that receive federal funding.  29 U.S.C. § 794. \n7  73.  Under Title II and Section 504, public entities specifically must not provide less \n8  effective services to individuals with disabilities or use methods of administration that have “the \n9  effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the public \n10  entity’s program with respect to individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii), \n11  (3)(ii); see also 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(iii), (4).  \n12  74.  Title II as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act further prohibit the \n13  unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities and require public entities to administer \n14  their services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \n15  qualified individuals with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12132; 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 29 U.S.C. \n16  § 794, 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2).  Public entities may not deliver services in a way that places \n17  people with disabilities at risk of unnecessary segregation in settings that limit their interactions \n18  with non-disabled peers, family, and members of their community.  \n19  75.  If necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, public entities must \n20  make reasonable modifications to their policies, practices, or procedures.  28 C.F.R. \n21  § 35.130(b)(7).  \n22 \n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 28  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 29 of 49\n \n1  VII.  DCYF HAS FAILED TO CORRECT SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES AND \nMAINTAIN A SYSTEM TO MEET THE FAMILY REUNIFICATION AND \n2  PLACEMENT NEEDS OF FOSTER CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL \nHEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. \n3   \nA.  DCYF has failed to ensure children with disabilities receive the necessary \n4  child welfare services and supports to allow them to return promptly and \nsafely to their own families and communities.   \n5   \n76.  DCYF was established in 2017 by 2E2S HB 1661 in order to create “a \n6 \ncomprehensive agency dedicated to the safety, development, and well-being of children” which \n7 \nemphasizes “supporting parents to be their children’s first and most important teachers.”  H.B. \n8 \n1661, 65th Leg., 2017 3d Spec.

As such, one of the primary objectives of this program is to give children the \n11 \nsupports they need in order to be taught, cared for, and nurtured by their own parents.  \n12 \nAccordingly, DCYF was mandated to seek and measure outcomes that must include \n13 \n“(A) Increasing family reunification; and (B) increasing the number of youth who are reunified \n14 \nwith their family of origin.”  Id. at § 101. \n15 \n77.  It is indisputable that separation from family is detrimental to the health and well-\n16 \nbeing of children.  Children who are separated from their family members lose access to critical \n17 \nsocial and family supports, including the psychological relief that results from co-regulation and \n18 \nprotective support from a trusted caregiver.  In addition, the chronic distress, worry, and anxiety \n19 \ncaused by separation from family affects children’s ability to engage in typical tasks of \n20 \ndevelopment, including learning, and can lead to worse mental health outcomes.  Indeed, the \n21 \nmere prospect of long-term separation and restriction from being with and communicating with \n22 \nfamily is a cause of stress to children.  According to American Academy of Pediatrics’ research, \n23 \n“the psychological distress, anxiety, and depression associated with separation from a parent \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 29  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 30 of 49\n \n1  would follow the children well after the immediate period of separation.”  Jacinto-Castanon de \n2  Nolasco v.

Defendants, charged with the care and custody of vulnerable children, are or \n6  should be aware that family separation risks long-term emotional harm to children, and that \n7  reasonable efforts to prevent removal and, if removal is necessary, to finalize a permanency plan \n8  “have the potential to dramatically reduce unnecessary family separation, decrease child and \n9  parent trauma, promote child and parent well-being, and expedite permanency.”  Jerry Milner & \n10  David Kelly, Reasonable Efforts as Prevention, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION (Nov. 5, 2018), \n11  https://bit.ly/2zsEjo8 (last accessed Jan. 27, 2021). \n12  79.  In 2018, the Children’s Bureau of the U.S. Children and Families Administration \n13  issued a report of its Child and Family Services Review (“CFSR”) for the state of Washington \n14  to assess performance of Washington’s federally funded child welfare programs.  \n15  ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES CHILDREN’S BUREAU, CHILD AND FAMILY \n16  SERVICES REVIEWS WASHINGTON FINAL REPORT 2018, \n17  https://www.dcyf.wa.gov/sites/default/files/CFSR/WA_CFSR_Final_Report_2018.pdf (last \n18  accessed Jan. 27, 2021).  The CFSR report found that Washington was not in “substantial \n19  conformity” with any of the seven identified outcomes regarding safety, permanency, or well-\n20  being.  Notably, the report underscored the lack of permanency for many children, stating: \n21  “[t]he achievement of timely permanency for children in the state’s foster care system is a \n22  particular concern.  The review found that the agency and court did not consistently make \n23  concerted efforts to achieve permanency.”  In addition to finding frequent failures to make \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 30  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 31 of 49\n \n1  concerted efforts to preserve family relationships, the CFSR found only 17% of the 95 \n2  applicable cases reviewed had substantially achieved the outcome of having “permanency and \n3  stability in their living situations,” in part because DCYF often failed to make “concerted \n4  efforts” to achieve “reunification, guardianship, adoption, or other permanent living \n5  arrangement,” and failed to provide for placement stability.  \n6  80.  DCYF has not remediated its failures.  For example, although consistent contact \n7  with family is vital to children’s mental health and well-being and is an essential component of \n8  meaningfully working toward permanency when the goal is family reunification, Defendants \n9  still often fail to provide children with disabilities in foster care consistent family visits and \n10  calls.  Visits are often suspended due to visitation provider issues, canceled, never scheduled, or \n11  made infeasible because of placements across the state or, worse, across the country.   \n12  81.  Defendants have also not addressed their failure to support children with \n13  behavioral health and developmental disabilities to reunify with their families.  They have failed \n14  to establish policies and practices to help families safely reunify, particularly when a child has \n15  more intensive support needs.  Defendants have failed to create a system in which case plans \n16  meaningfully assure that services are in fact provided to families to improve the conditions in \n17  the child’s own home and facilitate the return of the child home.  Although DCYF’s purpose \n18  under WASH. REV. CODE ANN. § 13.34.020 (West 1998) should be to nurture the family unit as a \n19  “fundamental resource” for raising children, its policy on “reasonable efforts” to prevent or end \n20  out-of-home placements does not define “reasonable efforts” or identify services the social \n21  workers must offer families to facilitate prompt reunification or other strategies that would \n22  enable families to safely welcome their children with unique or complex needs back home.  \n23 \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 31  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 32 of 49\n \n1  82.  Defendants have failed to establish policies and practices to engage families in \n2  planning supports and placements that will address the unique and individual needs of each \n3  child.  DCYF policies and practices marginalize family input and preferences for placements, \n4  services, and permanency planning.  Defendants’ failure to establish strategies to include and \n5  prioritize family participation in placement planning and decisions is resulting in an overall \n6  failure to achieve reunification and permanency.   \n7  83.  Defendants also fail to establish policies and practices to ensure delivery of \n8  services that families need in order to reunify.  The DCYF policy regarding Family Preservation \n9  Services and Intensive Family Preservation Services has strict eligibility requirements and broad \n10  exceptions to when services should be delivered.  Defendants’ failure to establish policies and \n11  practices to provide necessary services for families to reunify is resulting in prolonged and \n12  unnecessary family separations. \n13  84.  State law further sets forth expectations that foster and kinship caregivers will \n14  assist parents “by helping them understand their child's needs and correlating appropriate \n15  parenting responses,” participate in activities with families, and transport children to family time \n16  visits.  WASH. REV. CODE § 13.34.260 (2011).  However, Defendants have established no \n17  policies or practices to train foster parents in how to understand and appropriately respond to \n18  children with disabilities and do not have any policies that require foster parents to fulfill their \n19  vital role of collaboratively sharing their skills and knowledge with families so that they can \n20  raise their own children.  \n21  85.  Because foster placements are neither trained nor required to provide lasting \n22  supports for the children with disabilities and their families, foster children with the highest \n23  needs are at risk of being quickly rejected or kicked out by placements that are unprepared and \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 32  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 33 of 49\n \n1  unwilling to continue serving them and their families.  As a result, Defendants are failing to \n2  provide stable, nurturing homes for foster children while out-of-home placement is necessary \n3  for their safety. \n4  86.  Defendants are or should be aware of the harm that placement disruptions create. \n5  In addition to the emotional trauma of experiencing further abandonment, placement moves \n6  often mean disruptions in school and mental health or other therapies, as well as friendships.  \n7  Yet, according to publicly available data from the Center for Social Sector Analytics and \n8  Technology, placement instability has continued to be an ongoing problem that Defendants have \n9  failed to solve: in January 2020, 1,795 of the 8,105 children in out-of-home placements (22.2%) \n10  had experienced five or more placements.

According to this same public database, placement instability disproportionately \n15  affects Black/African American children, who are already grossly over-represented in the foster \n16  care system.3  Black/African American children make up 9.35% of children in out of home \n17  placements.

LGBTQ youth are similarly at risk of suffering extreme placement instability.  \n4  While in foster care, LGBTQ youth, who are also grossly over-represented,4 are more likely \n5  than their peers to experience harassment, hostility, and even violence due to their identities.  \n6  Laura Baams, et. al., LGBTQ Youth in Unstable Housing and Foster Care 2, Pediatrics (Feb 11, \n7  2019), available online at https://www.childrensrights.org/wp-\n8  content/uploads/2019/04/2019.02.12-LGBTQ-Youth-in-Unstable-Housing-and-Foster-Care.pdf \n9  [hereinafter Baams]; Bianca D.M.

Further, LBGTQ youth have far worse permanency outcomes than their non-\n17  LGBTQ peers.  As many as one out of four LGBTQ youth exit foster care without having found \n18  a permanent home.

While 11.2% of youth not in foster care \n21  identify as LBGTQ, 30.4% of youth in foster care identify as LBGTQ.

The disparity is also stark for trans youth, who make up 2.25% of youth not in foster care but 5.6% \nof foster youth.  Bianca D.M.

This lack of permanency \n3  often leads directly to homelessness for LBGTQ former foster youth.  Id. at 10. \n4  B.  DCYF has failed to develop an adequate array of placement options to \nsupport the individualized needs of children in foster care with disabilities \n5  and instead relies on harmful hotel, office, one-night, and out-of-state \nplacements. \n6   \n90.  Defendants’ systemic deficiencies further harm the children that DCYF separates \n7 \nfrom their families.  For example, rather than providing children with stable family-like settings \n8 \nin their communities, DCYF subjects them to dangerous, orphanage-style facilities in remote \n9 \nlocations, which may be located in other states such as Utah, Illinois, Florida, Tennessee, and \n10 \nIdaho.  While placed out of state, children typically visit with families only three or four times \n11 \nper year and are often only allowed one phone call per week.   \n12 \n91.  Most if not all of the out-of-state placements require complete segregation from \n13 \nnon-disabled peers, requiring that children attend school, receive medical care, and engage in \n14 \nstructured activities occurring on-site.  Some of the out-of-state placements have been the \n15 \nsubject of allegations including ineffective management, failure to properly train staff, \n16 \ndangerous use of restraints, and physical and sexual abuse and neglect, including incidents \n17 \nwhere children have died at the hands of staff.  These placements are generally locked or staff-\n18 \nsecure facilities, and they are located in remote areas, making it difficult to visit for both state \n19 \nworkers and children’s family members.  \n20 \n92.  Out-of-state facilities are not subject to Washington State foster care licensing \n21 \nrequirements.  When children are placed out of state, DCYF does not directly investigate \n22 \nallegations of abuse or neglect, and instead relies upon the limited information gathered by the \n23 \nfacilities and/or licensing agencies in the state where the facilities are located.  DCYF contracts \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 35  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 36 of 49\n \n1  with social workers in the state where the facilities are located to conduct monthly health and \n2  welfare checks.  Although DCYF began conducting quarterly in-person monitoring in 2018, \n3  DCYF social workers have been unable to visit most out-of-state placements in 2020 due to the \n4  COVID-19 pandemic.  \n5  93.  While the number of children placed out of state has decreased over the last year, \n6  the number of instances when children are deprived of an actual placement and must stay \n7  overnight in hotels, referred to as “exceptional stays,” has sharply increased.  Since 2014, the \n8  Washington State Office of the Family and Children’s Ombuds (“OFCO”) has been tracking \n9  “placement exceptions” in which hotels and DCYF offices are used as emergency placements.  \n10  In 2016, OFCO began reporting significant concerns about this growing practice, noting the \n11  increase from years past.  In its 2016 Annual Report, OCFO stated: \n12  “From September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016, OFCO received notice of 883 placement \nexceptions involving 221 different children.  This is a dramatic increase from the year \n13  before where OFCO documented 120 placement exceptions involving 72 children.  The \nvast majority of these placement exceptions (870) involved children spending the night in \n14  hotels/offices.  There were thirteen known instances of children spending the night in \nDCFS offices.” \n15   \nSTATE OF WASH.

Every year since, the number of exceptional placements has grown.  OFCO’s \n19 \n2019 Annual Report described interviews with DCYF Regional Administrators (“R.A.s”), who \n20 \nacknowledged that DCYF was increasingly relying upon hotels and office placements for \n21 \nchildren with disabilities whose needs exceeded the supports that DCYF’s foster parents were \n22 \nwilling to provide.

The report \n2  explained:  \n3  The R.A.s uniformly agreed the problem of placement exceptions is getting worse \nand is not necessarily due to a lack of licensed foster homes.  In fact, R.A.s noted \n4  many foster homes are empty while children languish in a series of hotel stays.  \nThey assert that placement exceptions continue because of major changes in the \n5  population that DCYF serves, -specifically an increase in youth with serious \nmental health concerns, youth involved with the juvenile justice system, and \n6  youth who suffer from major developmental disabilities. While these new \npopulations of children have grown, the recruiting and training of foster homes \n7  remains tied to a traditional view of a foster child that does not address the \nplacement needs for these types of youth. \n8   \n95.  OFCO also noted other alarming data showing glaring racial disproportionality.  \n9 \nIn its 2020 Annual Report, OFCO explained, “Of the children who experienced placement \n10 \nexceptions, 16.4 percent were Black/African American, while Black/African American children \n11 \ncomprise 13 percent of the out-of-home care population in Regions 4 and 6 and 9.4 percent of \n12 \nthe out-of-home care population statewide.”  OFFICE OF THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN’S OMBUDS, \n13 \n2020 ANNUAL REPORT 19 (2020), https://ofco.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-\n14 \n12/2020%20OFCO%20Annual%20Report.pdf.  It also included data showing that of the \n15 \ntwenty-four children who spent twenty or more nights in placement exceptions, five (20.8%) \n16 \nwere Black/African American, and seven (29%) were Multi-Racial.

DCYF R.A.s also \n23 \nadmitted to OFCO that they had concerns about children’s safety while in placement exceptions, \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 37  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 38 of 49\n \n1  citing examples of children assaulting one another and engaging in self-harm.  In its 2019 \n2  Annual Report, OFCO observed, “Placement exceptions seem to have a dysregulating effect on \n3  all youth, and youth presenting with major mental health issues are particularly at risk.”  The \n4  2019 report also described how youth reported feeling that “no one wants them and they are \n5  unlovable.”  STATE OF WASH. OFFICE OF THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN’S OMBUDS, 2019 ANNUAL \n6  REPORT at 12-13. \n7  97.  Yet, despite Defendants’ understanding that this practice is deeply harmful and \n8  potentially dangerous, the number of placement exceptions continued to increase over the next \n9  year.  In 2020, OFCO issued an Annual Report showing how the number of placement \n10  exceptions had grown to over 1,863 from September 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020, involving 220 \n11  different children.  STATE OF WASH. OFFICE OF THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN’S OMBUDS, 2020 \n12  ANNUAL REPORT at 14 (2020).  This figure represented a fifteen-fold increase since 2015 and \n13  was the highest number ever recorded.  In almost 300 instances, the location of the placement \n14  exception was a DCYF office.  According to this 2020 report, exceptional placements “can \n15  extend for days, weeks or even months,” and the vast majority of the children who experienced \n16  these extended exceptional placements had significant mental health needs.  Id. at 23. \n17  98.  The report went on to describe the highly destabilizing conditions that the \n18  children in extended exceptional placements experience: \n19  DCYF requires that each morning these children leave the hotel or office where \nthey spent the previous night, taking all of their belongings with them, with the \n20  expectation they will not be returning to the same room, or perhaps even the same \nhotel.  Frequently, due to staff shortages and logistics, these children also spend \n21  their evenings transporting other youth who are out of placement.  Their meals are \nconsequently improvised as well, and they frequently eat fast food or food from \n22  grocery or convenience stores.  They also endure ever shifting arrangements of \nboth the other children and the supervising staff that they spend the night with, a \n23  remarkable lack of continuity for the intimacy of these arrangements.  A variety \nof community members report to OFCO that these young people are inadequately \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 38  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 39 of 49\n \n1  served in this environment.  The concerns relate to gaps in education, inadequate \naccess to nutritious food, emotional dysregulation, children losing their \n2  belongings in transit, and other issues. \n \n3  99.  OFCO’s 2020 Annual Report alluded to another practice of having children sleep \n4  in cars, recommending that DCYF “[e]nsure that children do not sleep in cars even when being \n5  transported for much of the night.”  OFFICE OF THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN’S OMBUDS, 2020 \n6  ANNUAL REPORT at 14 (2020).  The director of OFCO previously stated in the media, “We have \n7  received reports – not many – but we have received reports of children staying in cars.”  \n8  Elizabeth Amon, Homeless and in Foster Care: Hundreds of Washington Youth Sleeping in \n9  Offices, Hotels, and Even Cars, THE IMPRINT (Oct. 1, 2020, 7:29 AM), \n10  https://imprintnews.org/youth-homelessness/homeless-foster-care-washington-youth-sleeping-\n11  offices-hotels-cars/47889.  DCYF also publicly admitted that if a child refuses placement, social \n12  workers stay in their cars with the youth until they agree, or “make another plan which may \n13  involve going to a hotel.”  Id.  \n14  100.  In its 2020 Annual Report, OFCO further recommended that DCYF institute \n15  measures to provide a “humane experience for the youth who continue to experience \n16  [exceptional placements], given the intractability of the problem.”  STATE OF WASH. OFFICE OF \n17  THE FAMILY AND CHILDREN’S OMBUDS, 2020 ANNUAL REPORT at 23.  For example, for children \n18  who are experiencing a series of nights in exceptional placements, OFCO suggested that DCYF \n19  allow them to stay in the same hotel room instead of making them check out each morning, \n20  which OFCO argued would help alleviate children’s anxiety about where they will be sleeping \n21  each night.  OFCO also recommended other practice changes, such as keeping office kitchens \n22  stocked with healthy food so that children would have access to better nutrition and creating \n23  spaces in the offices for children to engage in virtual education and other activities.  However, \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 39  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 40 of 49\n \n1  DCYF has thus far not adopted any policies or provided any guidance to establish these or other \n2  practices that might help alleviate some of the daily chaos experienced by youth who are \n3  deprived a placement.  \n4  101.   This year, Defendants are on track to again break their record for placement \n5  exceptions.  The number of exceptional placements has continued to rise dramatically.  DCYF \n6  data shows that, between September and November 2020 alone, 591 hotel or office stays have \n7  occurred, as compared to 250 placement exceptions during the same time period in 2019.  \n8  102.  Foster children with behavioral health and developmental disabilities are also at \n9  risk of having to suffer one-night foster care stays.  Like exceptional placements, children \n10  provided one-night stays typically must spend all of their waking hours at a DCYF office, where \n11  they have limited access to nutritious meals, exercise, education, and other constructive \n12  activities.  Only, rather than spending the night at a hotel or at the office, children are dropped \n13  off at a foster home late in the evening and picked up in the early morning.  This relentless cycle \n14  often repeats for weeks or months.  Although these one-night stays are with licensed homes, \n15  these sites often do not even afford children a warm meal, let alone the care, stability, or \n16  nurturing that all children need.    \n17  103.  Despite the daily harm suffered by children subjected to these practices, \n18  Defendants have still failed to develop an appropriate array of services and supports to allow \n19  children to live in a stable and nurturing home, either with their families or other caring \n20  individuals, in the least restrictive and most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.  \n21  Instead, Defendants sought new funding for more in-state congregate care facilities as well as \n22  long-term hospitalizations, which further segregate children, strain their family units, and do not \n23  provide for permanency.  \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 40  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 41 of 49\n \n1  104.  In a December 2020 statement, DCYF indicated that it is also seeking to increase \n2  congregate care provider payments and the amount of capacity in congregate care and \n3  institutional settings in Washington.  Nothing in Defendants’ statement described any changes \n4  in policies, practices, or resources to improve the frequency or timeliness of reunifications or \n5  provide for long-term and potentially permanent homes.  In January, Defendant Secretary \n6  Hunter testified in a legislative committee hearing and presented information about DCYF’s \n7  increase in congregate care “beds” and plan to add twenty additional BRS-Intensive Mental \n8  Health (BRS+) beds by March 1, 2020.  Ross Hunter, Dep’t of Child., Youth and Fams., \n9  Exceptional Placements (Jan. 19, 2021), \n10  https://app.leg.wa.gov/committeeschedules/Home/Document/224692. \n11  105.  Defendants also sought and obtained approval to weaken federal Title IV-E \n12  protections against inappropriate use of congregate care in QRTP settings.  Rather than setting \n13  up a system for an independent assessment by an unaffiliated evaluator to determine whether \n14  these placements are necessary as normally required by Title IV-E, DCYF will continue to use \n15  its own social workers’ unilateral determinations to place children in congregate care settings.  \n16  In addition, Defendants continue to maintain that “States retain the right to place youth in group \n17  care programs regardless of QRTP status.”  Letter from Ross Hunter, Sec’y, DCYF, to Tara Urs \n18  (Oct. 30, 2020). \n19  106.  While all foster children who need intensive supports for their behavioral health or \n20  developmental disabilities are at increased risk of being placed in segregated foster care \n21  facilities, Black/African American children are also disproportionately placed in congregate \n22  care.  In January 2020, when 9% of the children in out-of-home placements were Black/African \n23  American, 109 of the 950 children placed in group care as their “initial placement setting” \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 41  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 42 of 49\n \n1  (11.4%) were Black/African American.

Plaintiffs re-allege the paragraphs above. \n4  120.  Named Plaintiffs, putative Class Members, and Plaintiff DRW’s constituents have \n5  a right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be free of \n6  unwarranted governmental interference with the integrity of their families.  This right is part of \n7  their constitutionally protected right to privacy. \n8  121.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants have denied Plaintiffs their \n9  right to be free of unwarranted governmental interference with the integrity of their families \n10  through their ongoing and preventable separations from their families.  \n11  FOURTH CLAIM: DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATIONS \nOF FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT \n12  (Substantive Due Process)  \n \n13  122.  Plaintiffs re-allege the paragraphs above. \n14  123.  When the State takes a child into foster care custody, it assumes an affirmative \n15  duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to protect the child \n16  from harm and to keep the child reasonably free from harm and risks of harm. \n17  124.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a failure to meet \n18  their affirmative duty to protect Plaintiffs from harm and keep Plaintiffs reasonably free from \n19  harm and risk of harm.  These failures are a substantial factor leading to, and proximate cause \n20  of, the violation of the constitutionally-protected liberty interests of the Plaintiffs.  \n21  125.  Defendants’ failures constitute a pattern, custom, policy, and/or practice that are \n22  contrary to law and any reasonable professional standards, are substantial departures from \n23  accepted professional judgment, and are conducted with deliberate indifference to known harms \n \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY  Disability Rights Washington \nAND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 44  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729 \n \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 1   Filed 01/28/21   Page 45 of 49\n \n1  and imminent risk of known harms and to Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected rights and liberty \n2  interests, such that Defendants were plainly placed on notice and chose to ignore the dangers in \n3  a manner that shocks the conscience. \n4  126.  As a result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Plaintiffs have been harmed or \n5  are at continuing and imminent risk of harm and have been deprived of their substantive due \n6  process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, including but not limited to the right \n7  to be reasonably free from harm while in state custody. \n8  FIFTH CLAIM: DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR VIOLATIONS OF \nTHE ADOPTION ASSISTANCE AND CHILD WELFARE ACT, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., \n9  670 et seq. \n \n10  127.

The Court GRANTS the Motion and ORDERS as follows: \n9 \n1.  Based on the record before it, the Court tentatively finds, pursuant to Federal Rule \n10 \nof Civil Procedure 23(e), that the terms of the Settlement Agreement, attached as \n11 \nExhibit A to the Declaration of Susan Kas, are fair, reasonable, and adequate for the \n12 \nClass.

The Court’s \n17 \npreliminary approval is subject to change pending the outcome of the final \n18 \nsettlement approval hearing established herein. \n19 \n2.  The Court finds that the Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement (“Notice”), \n20 \nattached as Exhibit B to the Declaration of Susan Kas, meets the requirements of \n21 \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, due process, and applicable law.  The Notice \n22 \n23  (a) describes the terms of the Settlement Agreement; (b) gives notice of the time \n24  and place of the Fairness Hearing; and (c) describes how a Class member may \n25 \n26 \n \nORDER GRANTING PRELIMINARY  2  Disability Rights Washington \n315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \nAPPROVAL OF CLASS ACTION \nSeattle, Washington 98104 \nSETTLEMENT AND DIRECTING  Phone: (206) 324-1521 Fax: (206) 957-0729  \nNOTICE TO THE CLASS \nNO.  2:21-CV-00113 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 97   Filed 06/24/22   Page 3 of 7\n \n1  comment on, object to, or support the Settlement Agreement.

FEES AND COSTS FOLLOWING \n  MEDIATION \n16 \nWASHINGTON STATE \n17  DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN, \nYOUTH, AND FAMILIES; and ROSS \n18  HUNTER, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of the Washington State \n19 \nDepartment of Children, Youth, and \nFamilies, \n20 \n \n21    Defendants. \n \n22 \nTHIS MATTER having come before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Unopposed Motion for Order \n23 \nApproving Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Following Mediation, and having been duly considered, the \n24 \n25  Court makes the following findings:  \n26 \n  ORDER - 1 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 124   Filed 09/21/22   Page 2 of 6\n \n \n1.  Plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit on January 28, 2021, alleging that they and \n1 \n2  a class of foster children with disabilities were being harmed by Defendants’ failure to correct \n3 \nsystemic deficiencies in Washington State’s child welfare system.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory \n4 \nand injunctive relief, alleging that Defendants’ failures violate the rights of foster children with \n5 \ndisabilities under the United States Constitution; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n6 \n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Rehabilitation \n7 \nAct”), 29 U.S.C. § 794; and the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), \n8 \n9  42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., 670 et seq.  Dkt. 1.   \n10  2.  On June 29, 2021, the Court granted in part Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \n11 \ninjunction, which required Defendants to address practices for children in “placement exceptions,” \n12 \nincluding the use of hotel and government offices.  Dkt. 63.  Plaintiffs’ counsel subsequently \n13 \nnegotiated with Defendants to stipulate to the definition of a class, which was certified on \n14 \nSeptember 22, 2021.  Dkt. 77. \n15 \n3.  On June 15, 2021, the parties began engaging in mediation.  Over the course of the \n16 \n17  next year, they met over a dozen times and continuously exchanged numerous written proposals \n18  and settlement drafts, while also engaging in discovery.  These efforts resulted in the Settlement \n19 \nAgreement, which was executed on June 6, 2022, and was granted preliminary approval by the \n20 \nCourt on June 24, 2022.  Dkt. 97.  The Settlement Agreement provides for a comprehensive array \n21 \nof remedies to expand placement options and improve practices to better serve the complex and \n22 \nintersectional needs of the Class and their families.   \n23 \n4.  The Settlement Agreement itself affirms “an agreement that attorneys’ fees, costs, \n24 \n25  and expenses shall be paid to Plaintiffs’ Counsel for the litigation, mediation, and post-settlement \n26 \nmonitoring through the date Defendants’ obligations under this Agreement terminate.”  Dkt. 94-1 \n  ORDER - 2 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 124   Filed 09/21/22   Page 3 of 6\n \n \n¶ 56.  After the parties negotiated and submitted their Settlement Agreement for preliminary \n1 \n2  approval, they mediated on June 21, 2022, and reached an agreement for Defendants to pay \n3 \nPlaintiffs $2,150,000.00 for their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs from case inception to the \n4 \ndate this Court enters final approval on the Settlement Agreement.  Plaintiffs represent that their \n5 \nactual attorneys’ fees and costs, after the exercise of billing judgment to remove any excess, \n6 \nredundant, or unreasonably duplicative time, and applying a lodestar, is at least approximately \n7 \n$2,601,434.30, and their expenses are $19,258.27 as of July 20, 2022. \n8 \n9  5.  Plaintiffs have filed an unopposed motion seeking approval of the mediated total \n10  amount of $2,150,000.00 attorneys’ fees and costs.  They submit with their motion detailed time \n11 \nlogs and declarations of Plaintiffs’ counsel, documentation to support their billing rates, and \n12 \nrecords of necessary litigation expenditures.  The Court has reviewed these documents and the \n13 \nsummary of the time spent in this litigation.  These fees and costs are for necessary time spent \n14 \nengaging in extensive pre-lawsuit negotiation and investigation; filing the complaint and obtaining \n15 \na preliminary injunction and class certification; conducting wide-ranging discovery; and mediating \n16 \n17  extensively  with  the  State  of  Washington  toward  the  Settlement  Agreement  that  requires \n18  implementation of child welfare reforms across the state.  The litigation costs and expenditures \n19 \nincurred by Plaintiffs’ counsel were necessary and are also fully documented.  \n20 \n6.  The Court has reviewed the hourly rates of the attorneys and paralegals that \n21 \nrecorded time in this litigation, which the Court finds to be in line with the hourly rates charged in \n22 \nthe Seattle market for reasonably comparable work performed by attorneys of reasonably similar \n23 \nskill, experience, and reputation.  \n24 \n25  7.  Plaintiffs are the prevailing party and are entitled to their reasonable attorneys’ fees \n26 \nand costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  Plaintiffs represent the amount of time expended, hourly rates \n  ORDER - 3 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 124   Filed 09/21/22   Page 4 of 6\n \n \nrequested,  and  reasonable  costs  for  the  covered  period  results  in  a  potential  lodestar  of \n1 \n2  $2,620,692,57.  The $2,150,000.000 agreed fee award thus represents approximately an 18% \n3 \nreduction in the lodestar and costs that might otherwise be recoverable by Plaintiffs’ counsel.  \n4 \nGiven the scope and complexity of this litigation, the amount of time expended and documented \n5 \nin the course of representing Plaintiffs in this matter, the discovery undertaken by Plaintiffs, the \n6 \nhourly rates Plaintiffs’ counsel have requested, the costs Plaintiffs’ counsel have incurred and \n7 \ndocumented, and the favorable results achieved, the Court finds that the stipulated $2,150,000.00 \n8 \n9  attorneys’ fees and costs award is fair and reasonable in this matter.  \n10  8.  As indicated on the Notice of Proposed  Class Action Settlement, which was \n11 \ndistributed to the Class in accordance with the approved Notice Plan (see Dkts. 97-100), Plaintiffs \n12 \nhave posted their Unopposed Motion for Approval of Attorneys’ Fees and Costs on the Disability \n13 \nRights Washington website at https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/cases/d-s-v-washington-state-\n14 \ndepartment-of-children-youth-and-families and the National Center for Youth Law website at \n15 \nhttps://youthlaw.org/settlement-ds-v-washington-state-dcyf.  Notice has been directed to class \n16 \n17  members in a reasonable manner pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h). \n18  9.  On  August  12,  2022,  James  and  Shaylee  Medicraft  filed  objections  to  the \n19 \nSettlement Agreement on behalf of their children.  Dkt. 111.1  Their objections point to certain \n20 \nsigns of collusion between class counsel and defendants in reaching a settlement agreement, laid \n21 \nout in In re Bluetooth Headset Product Liability Litigation, 654 F.3d 935 (9th Cir. 2011), that the \n22 \nMedicrafts suggest are present in this case.  Specifically, according to the Medicrafts, (1) “the class \n23 \n24 \n \n25  1 As counsel for the Medicrafts conceded during the final approval hearing held before the Court on September 15, \n2022, the Medicrafts are not class members and thus have no standing to object to the proposed settlement.  See Fed. \n26  R. Civ. P. 23(e)(5)(A) (“[a]ny class member may object to the propos[ed] [settlement] if it requires court approval” \n(emphasis added)).  \n  ORDER - 4 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 124   Filed 09/21/22   Page 5 of 6\n \n \nreceive[d] no monetary distribution but class counsel are amply rewarded”; (2) “the parties \n1 \n2  negotiate[d] a ‘clear sailing’ arrangement providing for the payment of attorneys’ fees separate \n3 \nand apart from class funds”; and (3) “the parties arrange[d] for fees not awarded to revert to \n4 \ndefendants rather than be added to the class fund.”  Id. at 947.  The Court finds that none of these \n5 \nBluetooth factors are present or otherwise suggest collusion here.  As to the first Bluetooth factor, \n6 \nPlaintiffs’ lawsuit never sought damages, but instead pursued only injunctive relief of the sort \n7 \ncontemplated by the Settlement Agreement.  As to the second factor, the Settlement Agreement \n8 \n9  contained no agreed amount for attorneys’ fees that Defendants promised not to challenge.  Rather, \n10  as noted above, negotiations as to attorneys’ fees did not begin until the Settlement Agreement \n11 \nwas already signed, and the Agreement contemplated a contested motion if the parties could not \n12 \nreach consensus on the amount of fees.  Finally, the third Bluetooth factor concerning a “reverter” \n13 \nclause does not apply to a settlement, as here, for injunctive relief.  See Campbell v. Facebook, \n14 \nInc.,  951  F.3d  1106,  1127  (9th  Cir.  2020)  (“An  injunctive-relief-only  class  settlement,  by \n15 \ndefinition, has no fund into which any fees not awarded by the court could possibly revert.”).  For \n16 \n17  the above reasons, the Court finds that the Medicrafts’ objections to Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees lack \n18  merit.     \n19 \n10.  Absent any meritorious objection to the stipulated $2,150,000.00 attorneys’ fees \n20 \nand costs award, and finding it to be fair and reasonable in this matter, the Court approves the \n21 \naward.   \n22 \nNow, therefore, the Court hereby ORDERS that, pursuant to Rule 23(h) of the Federal \n23 \nRules  of  Civil  Procedure  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1988,  Plaintiffs’  Unopposed  Motion  for  Order \n24 \n25  Approving Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Following Mediation is GRANTED and the parties’ agreed \n26 \nupon attorneys’ fees and costs award of $2,150,000.00 to Plaintiffs is approved.  In accordance \n  ORDER - 5 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 124   Filed 09/21/22   Page 6 of 6\n \n \nwith their agreement, Defendants shall pay $2,150,000.00 to Plaintiffs’ counsel within thirty (30) \n1 \n2  days following the entry of this Order. \n3 \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n4 \nDated:  September 21, 2022 \n5 \n6 \n            _______________________________ \n7            Barbara Jacobs Rothstein \n          U.S. District Court Judge \n8 \n \n9 \n \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n  ORDER - 6 \n ",

Venue is proper in the Western District of Washington pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n3 \n1391(b).  \n4 \nThe Court, in its June 24, 2022 Order, preliminarily approved the parties’ proposed \n5 \nSettlement Agreement.  Dkt. 97.  The Court’s Order further approved the parties’ notice to class \n6 \nmembers regarding the proposed settlement (see Declaration of Susan Kas (“Kas Decl.,” Dkt. 93-\n7 \n2), Ex. B), and the method for distributing the notice as described in the Notice Plan (see Kas \n8 \n9  Decl., Ex. C).  The Order also provided class members until August 12, 2022 to submit written \n10  objections.   \n11 \nThe Court conducted a final approval hearing, via Zoom, on September 15, 2022.  Counsel \n12 \nfor Plaintiffs and Defendants presented argument as to why the Settlement Agreement is fair, \n13 \nreasonable, and adequate and should be approved.  The Court also heard arguments from counsel \n14 \nfor James and Shaylee Medicraft, who filed objections to the Settlement Agreement on behalf of \n15 \ntheir children.  See Dkt. 111.  The Medicrafts, while not objecting to the substance of the \n16 \n17  Settlement Agreement, argued that they did not receive individual notice; that the proposed \n18  settlement did not provide class members with an opt-out procedure; and that this case should \n19 \nproceed to trial in order to benefit class members with factual findings that would collaterally estop \n20 \nDefendants in subsequent individual litigations for damages.  See id.  Finally, the Court heard from \n21 \nseveral social work practitioners, and parents of children who had been in Defendants’ custody, \n22 \nwho expressed both satisfaction and concerns with the proposed Settlement Agreement.  The Court \n23 \nfinds that class members and others affected by the proposed Settlement Agreement received \n24 \n25  adequate opportunity to object.  \n26 \n  ORDER - 2 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 123   Filed 09/21/22   Page 3 of 4\n \n \nAs stated on the record during the final approval hearing, the Court finds, as counsel for \n1 \n2  the Medicrafts conceded, that the Medicrafts are not class members and therefore have no standing \n3 \nto object to the proposed settlement.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(5)(A) (“[a]ny class member may \n4 \nobject to the propos[ed] [settlement] if it requires court approval” (emphasis added)).  The Court \n5 \nalso finds that the parties complied with the Notice Plan in all material respects, meeting the due \n6 \nprocess requirements of the United States Constitution and Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n7 \nProcedure.  See Dkts. 98-100.  Given that the class in this case was certified under Rule 23(b)(2) \n8 \n9  (see Dkt. 77), individual notice to class members was not required.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(A); \n10  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 363 (2011) (recognizing that Rule 23(b)(2) “does \n11 \nnot require that class members be given notice”).  For the same reason, the proposed settlement \n12 \nwas not required to provide class members with an opt-out procedure.  See Wal-Mart Stores, 564 \n13 \nU.S. at 362 (recognizing that Rule 23 “provides no opportunity for … (b)(2) class members to opt \n14 \nout”).   \n15 \nThe Court finds that the proposed Settlement Agreement (Dkt. 94-1) is fair, reasonable, \n16 \n17  adequate, and beneficial to class members in light of the relief Plaintiffs have obtained in \n18  settlement to achieve the goals of the litigation.  Further litigation would expose both sides to risk \n19 \nand expense, given the complexity of this lawsuit and the likely duration of litigation.  The \n20 \nSettlement Agreement is the result of arms’ length negotiations, conducted with the assistance of \n21 \na skilled neutral mediator and after thorough factual and legal investigation and discovery, and is \n22 \nnot the product of fraud, collusion, or overreaching.  While the proposed settlement will not result \n23 \nin factual findings that could later be used in prosecuting individual lawsuits seeking damages, \n24 \n25  Plaintiffs, in this case, never sought damages, but instead pursued only injunctive relief of the sort \n26 \ncontemplated by the Settlement Agreement.  No class member or interested party has raised \n  ORDER - 3 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00113-BJR   Document 123   Filed 09/21/22   Page 4 of 4\n \n \nconcerns that alter the  underlying fairness,  reasonableness,  and adequacy of the Settlement \n1 \n2  Agreement. \n3 \nThe Court, having fully considered the matter and good cause appearing, hereby ORDERS: \n4 \n1.  The parties’ Joint Motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement Agreement is \n5 \nGRANTED.  The Court finds and concludes that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and \n6 \nadequate. \n7 \n2.  The parties’ Settlement Agreement and Order, attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration \n8 \n9  of Susan Kas in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Approval (Dkt. 94-1) is \n10  APPROVED and incorporated herein. \n11 \n3.  The parties to the Settlement Agreement and Order shall perform all of their obligations \n12 \nthereunder.  The case is DISMISSED, but the Court shall retain jurisdiction over the \n13 \nmatter  to  enforce  the  provisions  of  the  Settlement  Agreement  and  Order  until \n14 \nDefendants’ obligations terminate under paragraph 36 of the Agreement.  \n15 \n4.  The Settlement Agreement and Order is binding on class members.  It settles all of \n16 \n17  Plaintiffs’ claims for class-wide injunctive relief against Defendants that were asserted \n18  in the Complaint filed on January 28, 2021. \n19 \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n20 \nDated:  September 21, 2022 \n21 \n \n22 \n          _______________________________ \n23 \n          Barbara Jacobs Rothstein \n          U.S. District Court Judge \n24 \n \n25 \n \n26 \n  ORDER - 4 \n ",
