    "summary": "<p>This class action, brought on behalf of approximately 1,200 prisoners in the custody of the Kentucky Department of Corrections diagnosed with Hepatitis C, and those who might be diagnosed in the future, was filed in Kentucky state court in 2015, and removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on December 7, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by the civil rights firm Belzley, Bathurst &amp; Bentley, plaintiffs sued the Kentucky Department of Corrections, several individual employees of the Department, and CorrectCare Solutions, Inc., which provides medical services to inmates of the Department. They challenged the Department&rsquo;s treatment of inmates with Hepatitis C, in particular the practice of triaging direct-acting antiviral treatment based on a priority level categorization of infected inmates. In a claim brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, they asserted that these treatment practices constituted deliberate indifference to serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. They further asserted that such care failed to reasonably accommodate persons with Hepatitis C, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1978. Finally, plaintiffs alleged negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress in violation of state law. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief and punitive damages.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2019, Judge Gregory F. Van Totenhove denied plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a permanent injunction, finding that they had not established that the procedures at issue amounted to grossly inadequate treatment or that the Department of Corrections operated with the requisite culpable state of mind. In the same order, however, the Court granted class certification, defining the class as &ldquo;all inmates in Kentucky prisons who have been diagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) for the purpose of injunctive relief.&rdquo; 2019 WL 3068447. Ultimately, on February 4, 2020, the Court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to the federal claims&mdash;holding that the plaintiffs failed to show that the Department&rsquo;s practice of screening and monitoring inmates with Hepatitis C and prioritizing use of direct-acting antiviral treatment was inadequate or detrimental to their health, or that the defendants had acted with deliberate indifference to substantial risk of harm. The Court closed the federal case, and remanded the action to state court as to the state law claims. 2020 WL 556391.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs appealed, and on July 6, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in a panel of Judges Alice M. Batchelder, Richard A. Griffin, and Jane B. Stranch, affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the federal claims. Agreeing with the District Court, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs failed to show that the Department&rsquo;s treatment plan put them at substantial risk of serious harm. 861 Fed.Appx. 654.</p>\r\n<p>The status of the case on remand in state court is unknown at this time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Introduction \n \n  1.  The Hepatitis C virus – HCV -- poses an unreasonable and substantial risk of \nserious present and future medical and physical harm to those who are infected with it, and to the \ngeneral public when infected inmates are released from prison. Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843 (7th \nCir. 2011).  \n  2.  Conscious delay, denial, or interference in medical treatment of HCV for non-\nmedical reasons -- standing alone -- states a plausible claim against prison officials for deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of a prisoner in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. \n89, 90 (2007).  \n  3.  Plaintiffs are all inmates of the Kentucky Department of Corrections (“KDOC”) \nwho are infected with the Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”).  Defendants have refused Plaintiffs’ repeated \nrequests to be treated commensurate with the standard of care, or delayed such treatment, for non-\nmedical reasons of administrative convenience or cost, which are not related to the individual \nmedical needs of Plaintiffs.  \n  4.  This is a class action that seeks injunctive relief and recovery of damages, under 42 \nU.S.C.  §1983  and  other  applicable  state  claims,  for  Defendants’  violation  of  the  Eighth \nAmendment as a result of their deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of Plaintiffs \nand all others similarly situated.   \nType text here\n  5.  HCV, if left untreated, may progress toward end-stage liver disease and death. \nMajor  advances  in  treatment  have recently  been  made  with  the  introduction  of medication \nregimens having increasingly higher success rates, fewer side effects, and much shorter treatment \n  2 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 3 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1391\ndurations. The KDOC has prepared a new HCV treatment plan (“the New Plan”).  However, the \nNew Plan does not meet the prevailing standard of care, future developments in treatment are likely \nto  render  it  obsolete,  and  the  lack  of  training  and  supervision  means  there  will  likely  be \ninconsistencies, inaccuracies and unwarranted deviations in its implementation, particularly given \nthe expense of new treatment regimens.  In addition, the New Plan is the first amendment to the \nKDOC’s old HCV treatment plan (“the Old Plan”) since 2007, and many members of the class \nmay have been harmed by Defendants’ failure to regularly and consistently update the plan to \nmirror the established standard of care.  Finally, there may be issues concerning the reliability of \nthe testing to which HCV-infected inmates are subjected, raising questions as to the integrity of \nand motivations underlying, such testing. \n  6.   It is the purpose of this litigation not only to protect Plaintiffs and the class, but the \ngeneral public into which Plaintiffs and members of the class will be released. \nII.  Jurisdiction and Venue \n  7.  Plaintiffs and the class seek injunctive relief and damages under the Civil Rights \nAct of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for Defendants’ violations of the rights, privileges and immunities \nguaranteed Plaintiffs and the class by the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs \nand the class also seek damages for negligence, gross negligence, outrageous conduct, intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and violations of applicable Kentucky regulations and KDOC \npolicies.  Defendants are all domiciled in Franklin County, Kentucky, and venue is therefore proper \nin this Court. \nIII.  Parties \n  8.  Plaintiffs are all inmates of the KDOC who are infected with HCV.  \n  3 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 4 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1392\n  9.  The KDOC is the entity charged with the care and custody of Plaintiffs, and has \nbeen described by former Defendant Commonwealth of Kentucky as an indispensable party to this \nlitigation (DN 121-1, pp. 4-5).  The KDOC is sued for injunctive relief only. \n  10.  Jim Erwin is presently Commissioner of the KDOC and has ultimate responsibility \nfor  all  operations  of  institutions  within  the  KDOC,  the  promulgation,  implementation  and \nenforcement of all of the KDOC’s policies, procedures, protocols, customs and practices, and the \nemployment, training and supervision of employees of the KDOC.  Mr. Erwin is sued in his \nindividual capacity for injunctive relief and damages. He is sued in his official capacity for \ninjunctive purposes only. \n  11.  Rodney Ballard was formerly, at times pertinent to this litigation, Commissioner of \nthe KDOC, and had ultimate responsibility for all operations of institutions within the KDOC, the \npromulgation,  implementation  and  enforcement  of  all  of  the  KDOC’s  policies,  procedures, \nprotocols, customs and practices, and the employment, training and supervision of employees of \nthe KDOC. \n  12.  LaDonna  Thompson  was  formerly,  at  times  pertinent  to  this  litigation, \nCommissioner of the KDOC, and had ultimate responsibility for all operations of institutions \nwithin the KDOC, the promulgation, implementation and enforcement of all of the KDOC’s \npolicies,  procedures,  protocols,  customs  and  practices,  and  the  employment,  training  and \nsupervision of employees of the KDOC. \n  13.  Denise  Burkett,  APRN,  is  the  Medical  Director  of  the  KDOC,  and  has \nresponsibility  for  all  operations  of  institutions  within  the  KDOC,  the  promulgation, \nimplementation and enforcement of all of the KDOC’s policies, procedures, protocols, customs \n  4 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 5 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1393\nand practices, and the employment, training and supervision of employees of the KDOC, that \nconcern inmates’ medical care. \n  14.  Doug Crall, MD, was formerly, at times pertinent to this litigation, the Medical \nDirector of the KDOC, and had responsibility for all operations of institutions within the KDOC, \nthe promulgation, implementation and enforcement of all of the KDOC’s policies, procedures, \nprotocols, customs and practices, and the employment, training and supervision of employees of \nthe KDOC, that concern inmates’ medical care. \n15.  Cookie Crews is, and has been at all times pertinent to this litigation, the Health \nServices Administrator of the KDOC, and she has responsibility for all operations of institutions \nwithin the KDOC, the promulgation, implementation and enforcement of all of the KDOC’s \npolicies,  procedures,  protocols,  customs  and  practices,  and  the  employment,  training  and \nsupervision of employees of the KDOC, that concern the health services that are available to the \nKDOC’s inmates. \n  16.  Frederick Kemen, MD, is, and has been at all times pertinent to this litigation, the \nperson responsible for managing the KDOC’s HCV treatment plan at all institutions within the \nKDOC, and as such, has responsibility for training on, and supervision and enforcement of both \nthe Old and New Plans, and their satisfaction of the applicable standard of care.  \n  17.  Defendant CorrectCare Solutions, Inc., for all periods relevant to this complaint \nbeginning March 1, 2014: is registered with the Kentucky Secretary of State to do business in \nKentucky;  provided  medical  services  to  inmates  of  the  KDOC;  employed  the  medical \nprofessionals who dealt directly with Plaintiffs and the class and are therefore vicariously liable \nfor the injuries caused by their wrongful conduct in the course and scope of their employment \nunder the doctrine of respondeat superior; were responsible for the health, welfare, and medical \n  5 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 6 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1394\nneeds of Plaintiffs and the class, for complying with their reasonable medical requests, and for \nseeing that they were treated commensurate with the prevailing standard of care; and were \nresponsible for training and supervising the medical professionals in their employ to insure that \nthey properly attended to the medical needs of Plaintiffs and the class.   \n18.  Plaintiff’s assertion of liability against the individual Defendants identified above \nis based upon: (a) their failure to employ qualified individuals for positions of responsibility (or to \nterminate individuals upon demonstration of their lack of qualifications); (b) their failure to \npromulgate, implement and enforce policies, procedures, protocols, customs and practices for the \ncare of inmates with HCV in the KDOC’s institutions; (c) their failure to properly train and \nsupervise the employees for whom they were responsible; (d) and their knowing participation or \nacquiescence  in,  contribution  to,  encouragement  of,  explicit  or  implicitly  authorization  of, \napproval of, or ratification of the failure to properly treat inmates with HCV, and to implement, \nupdate and enforce the HCV plan to maintain its compliance with the prevailing standard of care. \nIV.  Class Action Allegations \n  19.  This is a class action under Rule 23(a) and (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n  20.  Plaintiffs are representatives of a Class composed of all prisoners in the custody of \nthe KDOC who have been diagnosed as having HCV. \n  21.  Because the prevalence of HCV is estimated to be anywhere from 9.6% to 41.1% \nof the prison population nationally, membership in the class among the KDOC’s total inmate \npopulation of 21,833 individuals (as of November 6, 2015) is probably between 2,000 and 9,000 \nindividuals.  Defendant Kemen has testified that there are approximately 1200 current inmates of \n  6 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 7 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1395\nthe KDOC who have been diagnosed with HCV. The class is therefore so numerous that joinder \nof all members is impracticable. \n  22.  Plaintiffs’ claims involve common questions of law and fact that are typical of the \nclaims of the Class as a whole. The claims concern Defendants’ protocol and practice for treating \nHCV, which is applicable to all prisoners with HCV. Common questions include (1) whether \nDefendants have been deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of Plaintiffs and the \nmembers of the Class; (2) whether Defendants have failed and refused to provide the necessary \nstaging  of  HCV  patients in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  standard  of  care,  including the \npretreatment testing and specialist consults that are needed to determine the severity of the disease \nand the need for treatment; (3) whether Defendants have failed and refused to provide treatment \nfor Plaintiffs and the members of the Class with the newest, most effective medications for HCV \nin accordance with the prevailing standard of care; and (4) whether Defendants’ failure to provide \ntreatment to Plaintiffs and the Class in accordance with the prevailing standard of care for \ntreatment of HCV has caused them compensable injury. \n  23.  Each day treatment is postponed, the likelihoods of cirrhosis of the liver, liver \ncancer, a liver transplant, and death from HCV grow for each member of the Class, as does the \nlikelihood of infection for those with whom they come in contact in KDOC facilities and for \nmembers of the general public after they are released.  \n  24.  These common questions predominate over any questions affecting only individual \nclass members. Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nClass so that final declaratory and injunctive relief would be appropriate to the class as a whole. \n  7 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 8 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1396\n  25.  Plaintiffs have a strong personal interest in the outcome of this litigation, and they \nare represented by competent, class-action experienced counsel who will adequately and fairly \nprotect the interests of the Class. \n  26.  A class action is superior to any other available method for a fair and efficient \nadjudication of this controversy. Separate actions by individual members of the Class would create \na risk of inconsistent or differing adjudications and delay the ultimate resolution of the issues at \nstake. \nV.  Facts \na.  HCV Defined \n  27.  Hepatitis C is a blood borne disease caused by the Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”). The \nvirus brings about inflammation that damages liver cells. It is a leading cause of liver disease and \nliver transplants. \n  28.  There are several different genotypes of HCV, with subtypes. Genotype 1 is the \nmost common type of HCV in the United States. \n  29.  Approximately 80% of people who become infected with the HCV virus will \ndevelop chronic HCV. \n  30.  Chronic HCV patients develop fibrosis (liver scarring), which can worsen liver \nfunction until the patient develops cirrhosis. Ultimately, patients may end up with end-stage liver \ndisease, cancer, or other serious illnesses. Some patients will need a liver transplant, and others \nwill die. \n  31.  HCV is transmitted by infected blood. Methods of transmission include:  (a) \nphysical activity in sports, (b) tattooing, (c) use of a needle not properly cleaned and sterilized, (d) \nexposure to an infected person’s blood in the course of medical care, (e) barber and cosmetology \n  8 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 9 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1397\ncare, (f) sexual activity, (g) sharing of eating utensils and food, (h) sharing razors or other personal \ngrooming supplies, (i) sharing bathrooms or shower facilities, (j) sharing living quarters, or (k) \nphysical violence between inmates or involving staff.  \n  32.  It  is  widely  accepted  that  the  number  of  reported  cases  of  HCV  nationwide \nunderstates its actual prevalence. In 2000, the United States Surgeon General called HCV a “silent \nepidemic,” and estimated that as much as two percent of the adult U.S. population had HCV. \n  33.  The last decade has seen a spike in reported cases of HCV among young people. \nThis increase in new cases of HCV is largely attributable to the increase in opioid addiction and \nthe resulting use of intravenous drugs. \n  34.  The incidence of HCV is not diminishing, and its effects are worsening. In 2011, \nthe CDC reported that HCV had overtaken HIV as a cause of death. \n  35.  The Commonwealth of Kentucky has the highest HCV infection rate in the nation. \nb.  HCV in Prison \n  36.  The prevalence of HCV in prison is higher than in the general population. It is \nestimated to be anywhere from 9.6% to 41.1% of the prison population nationally.  Defendant \nKemen’s testimony that 1200 of more than 12,000 current KDOC inmates have been diagnosed \nwith HCV likely vastly understates its presence in Kentucky prisons.  \n  37.  In 1997, according to one study, 29% to 43% of all people infected with HCV in \nthe United States passed through a correctional facility.  Combatting HCV demands effective \nresponse in the correctional setting, particularly in states with serious intravenous drug problems \nlike Kentucky. \n  38.  For the same reason, prison affords an unparalleled opportunity for diagnosis and \ntreatment of HCV. \n  9 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 10 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1398\nc.  History of HCV Treatment \n  39.  Treatment exists for chronic HCV. The available treatments have changed over \ntime. \n  40.  In 1991, a drug called Interferon was approved to be used alone. Seven years later, \nthe FDA approved the use of Ribavirin alongside Interferon, and in 2001, Ribavirin was paired \nwith Pegylated Interferon. This regimen was referred to as combination therapy.  \n  41.   The standard of care after 2001 was to treat Genotypes 2 or 3 with combination \ntherapy, and to treat Genotype 1 with combination therapy if the patient had reached a certain stage \nof liver damage, typically measured by a liver biopsy. If, after treatment, the virus was not \nsuppressed, or if it was suppressed during treatment but later returned, there was no other treatment \navailable for the so-called nonresponder or relapser. \n  42.  2011 saw the FDA approval of two protease inhibitors that produced better results \nwhen either one was taken with combination therapy, especially for Genotype 1 (SVR of 60-80%). \n  43.  In 2013 and 2014, the FDA approved more new antiviral medications. These \nmedications can now be taken as part of an Interferon-free regimen. The change is dramatic; the \nworst side effects are avoided. The regimen is a much shorter duration – 12 weeks for some, 24 \nweeks for others. Best of all, the success rate for these regimens is better than combination or triple \ntherapy – well over 90%, including for nonresponders and relapsers. \n  44.  In October 2013, the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) announcement of \nnew “breakthrough” direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs to cure HCV caused the American \nAssociation for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and the Infectious Disease Society of \nAmerica (IDSA), the two relevant professional medical associations concerned with the treatment \nand cure of HCV, to convene the AASLD/IDSA “HCV Guidance Panel.” Thirty national experts, \n  10 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 11 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1399\nincluding gastroenterologists and hepatologists with experience in treating HCV, comprise the \nHCV Guidance Panel.  \n  45.  The  AASLD/IDSA  adopted  the  “breakthrough”  drug  12-week  daily  oral \nmedication protocol with the 95% cure rate, as the HCV medical treatment community medical \nstandard of care in January 2014, consistent with the medical treatment community standard of \nmedical care definition of U.S. v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111 (1979).  \n  46.  By June 2014, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP), the Center for Disease \nControl, the United States Public Health Service, the FDA, and the United States Department of \nVeterans Affairs had all recognized the changed standard of care for HCV patients in their approval \nand implementation of one-pill-per-day, 12-week protocols for the treatment of HCV patients.  \n  47.  In October 2014, the FDA approved more advanced HCV breakthrough DAA drugs \nthat cure at a 95% rate, and eliminate Interferon injections completely – Harvoni and Viekira-Pak.  \nOn June 29, 2015, the AASLD/IDSA updated the HCV standard of care, which now requires that \ntreatment providers eliminate Interferon in any form as a recommended treatment for HCV. Only \nthe October 2014 non-Interferon \"breakthrough\" DAA drugs, Harvoni and Viekira-Pak, now meet \nthe undisputed community standard of care for all HCV treatment providers.  \n  48.  Current  AASLD/IDSA  standard-of-care  also  requires  that  HCV  treatment \nproviders treat all HCV-infected patients as soon as possible with the most-recently approved DAA \ndrugs to remove the HCV infection, no matter what the level of infection. Chemical dependency \ntesting and treatment are not relevant, nor is a correction facility’s claim of lack of resources to \njustify treating some more severely symptomatic patients, and not others.  \n  49.  As of June 29, 2015, all HCV treatment providers are professionally obligated to \nprescribe non-Interferon DAA drugs (currently Harvoni or Viekira-Pak) to any HCV patient, with \n  11 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 12 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1400\nrecommended treatment to begin immediately at any level of infection, no matter how recent or \nlow the level of infection. This is  the case for all treatment providers irrespective of their \nemployment situation. \n   50.  The standard of care evolved to include so-called triple therapy – one of the two \nprotease inhibitors, taken with Interferon and Ribavirin – for Genotype 1 patients. Triple therapy \nwas effective on nonresponders and relapsers, giving them a new option and potential cure.  \n  51.   The  duration  of  treatment  with  triple  therapy  remained  the  same  as  with \ncombination therapy, as did the side effects. The expense increased because of the additional \nmedication.  \n  52.   There have also been changes in how the disease is monitored. To measure fibrosis, \nproviders now generally forego a liver biopsy in favor of non-invasive tests. Blood tests can offer \nan accurate assessment of liver fibrosis, and these tests can be coupled with certain types of \nscanning if desired.  \n  53.   These new developments in staging the disease, and treating it, have eliminated the \nbarriers to a cure. \nd.  History of HCV Treatment in the KDOC \n  54.  The KDOC’s Old HCV Plan was developed in 2007 by state officials in response \nto litigation by prisoners complaining of their HCV treatment. See Paulley v. Chandler, No. 3:99-\nCV-00549, 2000 WL 33975579, at *1 (W.D. Ky. 2000). When a prisoner was diagnosed with \nHCV, the Old Plan laid out the procedure for treating and controlling the disease. \n  55.  Even though the Old Plan required compliance with the prevailing standard of care, \nand despite the advances in HCV treatment over the last decade, it was not updated until March \n2017.  The Old Plan made no mention of the triple therapy treatment that had been the standard of \n  12 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 13 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1401\ncare since 2011. Without policy and procedure guidance, testing and treatment of HCV by \nthe  KDOC  was  ad  hoc,  arbitrary  and  capricious,  and  responsive  to  administrative \nconvenience, not the medical needs of Plaintiffs and the Class.  Moreover, beginning in \nJuly 2014 and for a period of time thereafter, other than the most serious cases of HCV in \nthe KDOC’s institutions, no one with HCV was treated pending developments in HCV \ntreatment options.  Defendant Kemen testified in August 2014 that the KDOC was in “the earlier \nstages of … revising or maybe replacing the [HCV] algorithm now.” But the New Plan did not \ntake effect until March 2017.   \n  56.  The  New  Plan  purports  to  “summarize[]  the  current  best  practices  in  the \npharmacological treatment of chronic Hepatitis C infection as mirrored by the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons [FBOP] guidelines” that were issued in October 2016.  Indeed, most correctional systems \nthese days are following the lead of the FBOP in the care and treatment of HCV-infected inmates.   \nHowever: \n  a.  A simple comparison of the HCV Plan with the FBOP Guidelines shows \nthat the FBOP Guidelines are significantly longer and more detailed than the HCV Plan.  \nAmong other things, the FBOP Guidelines now require that all inmates be tested for HCV \nunless they opt out;  the KDOC’s New Plan leaves it to the provider to decide whether an \ninmate needs to be tested based on their “Health History.”  The FBOP Guidelines also \nrequire cohort testing, while the New Plan does not. \n  b.  The HCV Plan’s “summary” of the FBOP Guidelines was prepared by \nDefendant Kemen, who has no specialty in infectious disease, and Defendant Burkett who, \ndespite being the KDOC’s current medical director, is not a physician at all. \n  c.  Although the FBOP Guidelines on which the HCV Plan was purportedly \nbased was issued in October 2016, the HCV Plan was not prepared and circulated until \nMarch 9, 2017, and it does not incorporate new FBOP Guidelines that were issued in \nJanuary 2018. \n  13 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 14 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1402\n  c.  HCV-infected inmates will not be treated, regardless of the severity of their \ncondition, if they will be released in 24 weeks or less, even though the course of treatment \nnow is only 12 weeks. \n  d.  Although some training is provided to the physician and advanced practice \nregistered nurses (APRN) who care for HCV-infected inmates, it is not clear what training \nif any is provided their subordinates, or whether there is any system of supervision to insure \nthe HCV Plan is properly and consistently implemented in the various KDOC penal \ninstitutions.  Supervision is essential in a correctional environment to insure that diagnosis \nand treatment of HCV does not become a tool of coercion or retaliation in an already \npunitive environment. \ne.  The Named Plaintiffs \ni.  Brian Woodcock \n  57.   Mr. Woodcock is an inmate at the Kentucky State Penitentiary (“KSP”). A biopsy \nof Mr. Woodcock’s liver in December 2011 showed that the fibrosis in his liver – an indication of \nthe severity of his condition -- had progressed from Stage 1 to Stage 2. For that reason, no less an \nauthority than Dr. Steven Shedlofsky, the creator and then-director of the Old Plan, found that Mr. \nWoodcock qualified for antiviral prescription medication under the provisions of the Old Plan. \nHowever, after the KDOC terminated its association with Dr. Shedlofsky, a dispute arose over \nwhether Mr. Woodcock qualified for treatment under the Old Plan and, if so, the appropriate \ntreatment for his condition. \n  58.   It was not until almost four years after filing a pro se lawsuit in federal court \n(Woodcock v. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections, et al., Case No. 5:12-cv-135 (W.D.Ky.)) that Mr. \nWoodcock began receiving treatment for his condition, but not before his infection had progressed \nalmost to Stage 4 cirrhosis.      \nii.  Ruben Rios Salinas \n  59.  Mr. Salinas is an HCV-infected inmate at the Kentucky State Penitentiary (“KSP”). \n  14 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 15 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1403\n  60.  Mr. Salinas has been denied testing and treatment of his chronic HCV infection. \nOn October 26, 2011, Mr. Salinas was told that he would receive the new HCV “triple-therapy” \nonce it became available to the KDOC.  When, on February 27, 2015, Mr. Salinas filed a “Petition \nfor Mandamus” that initiated this litigation in state court, in order to obtain testing and treatment \nfor his condition, his petition was met by Defendants not with testing and treatment, but with a \nmotion to dismiss his petition. \niii.  Keath Bramblett \n  61.  Mr. Bramblett is an inmate at Luther Luckett Correctional Complex, who acquired \nhis HCV as a consequence of one of the infection-control positions he has held during his \nincarceration.  Mr. Bramblett’s ALT/AST levels – a measure of the severity of his infection – were \nso high that he was denied participation in any educational or reentry programming involving \nworking with food. When the electric razor he had been prescribed for his own personal use due \nto his HCV condition ceased working, KSR’s administration rejected doctor’s orders that he be \nprovided another one, and have required him to use “community” razors that are shared by other \ninmates. \n  62.  Mr. Bramblett was denied any treatment for his condition before he was named a \nPlaintiff in this case.  Although he has now received treatment, he has been told that it was too late \nto prevent severe liver damage and Mr. Bramblett continues to experience the signs and symptoms \nof such injury. \niv.  Jessica Lawrence \n  63.  Ms. Lawrence suffers from chronic HCV. Her medical records clearly indicate her \nHCV diagnosis. \n  15 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 16 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1404\n  64.   In response to a grievance filed by Ms. Lawrence, Defendants represented to her \nthat “there is no current cure for Hepatitis C” and that treatment of her HCV infection “is not \nindicated.”  To date, Ms. Lawrence has not received treatment for her HCV. \nVI.  Causes of Action  \nCount 1:  Violation of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to U.S. Constitution \n  65.  Paragraphs  1-64  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 65. \n  66.  Plaintiffs and the class have HCV, an obviously serious medical need.  Instead of \nreceiving effective treatment for their condition, compliant with the standard of care, they have \neither been denied any treatment, and/or have had their treatment interrupted or delayed by its \ninept  implementation,  and/or  have  been  required  to  engage  in  practices  that  are  entirely \ninconsistent with treatment and may actually be hastening a spread of the infection.  Defendants' \nconduct that directly or indirectly contributed to a worsening of the condition of Plaintiffs and any \nmember of the class was intentional, reckless, deliberate, wanton and/or malicious, and was \nindicative of their total, deliberate and reckless disregard of and indifference to the lives and \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the class. \n  67.  Plaintiffs believe and, after reasonable discovery, will show that their treatment by \nDefendants was not unusual, but was part of a continuing policy, procedure, protocol, custom \nand/or practice of Defendants of willfully and deliberately ignoring the medical needs of inmates \nwith HCV, and/or leaving their fates in the hands of correctional and medical employees that were \nill-trained and ill-supervised, and that had long demonstrated their lack of qualifications to \nresponsibly discharge their duties.  Such conduct is the result of policies, procedures, protocols, \ncustoms and/or practices of Defendants, either written or unwritten, which are systematically \n  16 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 17 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1405\napplied to all persons who are diagnosed with HCV while incarcerated in KDOC institutions.  Such \npractices constitute an arbitrary use of government power, and evince a total, intentional, deliberate \nand unreasonable disregard for and indifference to the lives and constitutional and common law \nrights of Plaintiffs and the Class, and the wholesale violations of those rights likely to result from \nthe  regular  and  systematic  pursuit  of  such  policies,  procedures,  protocols,  customs  and/or \npractices. \n  68.  As  a  result  of  the  foregoing,  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class,  through  Defendants' \ndeliberately indifferent -- if not reckless, intentional and/or malicious -- conduct, were subjected \nto cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. §1983. \nCount 2:  Violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1978, 29 U.S.C. §§791-794a  \nand the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§12131-32. \n \n  69.  Paragraphs  1-68  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 69. \n  70.  Plaintiffs and the Class are handicapped individuals with a disability, specifically, \ntheir HCV infection, a physical impairment that substantially affects the major life activities of \ndigestive systems, circulatory systems, and life itself. \n  71.   Defendants have failed and refused to reasonably accommodate the handicaps and \ndisabilities of Plaintiffs and the Class, so as not to exclude them from participation in, or deny \nthem the benefits of, the federally-funded services, programs, or activities of the KDOC, and by \nfailing to provide treatment compliant with the standard of care.  \nCount 3:  Negligence/Gross Negligence \n  72.  Paragraphs  1-70  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 72. \n  17 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 18 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1406\n  73.  By virtue of the foregoing, all Defendants were negligent and grossly negligent in \ntheir treatment of Plaintiffs and the class; in addition, the medical professionals responsible for the \ncare of Plaintiffs and the class failed to meet the standard of care applicable to their professions in \ntheir treatment of Plaintiffs and the class. \nCount 4:  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress/Outrage \n74.  Paragraphs  1-73  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 74. \n  75.  Defendants' intentional treatment of Plaintiffs and the class caused extreme mental \nand emotional distress that cannot be compensated by any other cause of action in this Complaint, \nand was so beyond the bounds of human decency that it exemplifies the tort of outrage.  \nVII.  Injunctive Relief Against All Defendants \n  76.  Paragraphs  1-75  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 76. \n  77.  Plaintiffs and the Class seek declaratory and injunctive relief against all Defendants \nrequiring that they meet the standard of care in the diagnosis and treatment of HCV-infected \ninmates or, at a minimum, adopt in toto and comply with the FBOP Guidelines. \nVIII.  Damages Against the Individual Defendants in Their Individual Capacities \n  78.  Paragraphs  1-77  above  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference  and  made  this \nParagraph 78. \n  79.  The injuries suffered by Plaintiffs and the class was unnecessary and preventable.  \nLack of monitoring and treatment of HCV-infected inmates commensurate with the standard of \ncare is inexcusable.  A delay in treatment can increase susceptibility to liver cancer, shorten life \nexpectancy, and increase future medical monitoring and treatment costs.  As a consequence, \n  18 \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 126   Filed: 01/15/19   Page: 19 of 20 - Page ID#:\n1407\nPlaintiffs and the class are entitled to recover actual damages to compensate them for (a) any loss \nof their power to labor and earn money, (b) their past and future mental and physical pain and \nsuffering, and (c) any future medical and medication expenses they must bear as a result of \nDefendants' misconduct. In addition, Defendants' violations of the constitutional and common law \nrights of Plaintiffs and the class were cruel, malicious, and evinced a total and reckless disregard \nfor their lives and rights, warranting an award of punitive damages from Defendants in order to \ndeter such conduct in the future. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the class request certification of the class defined above, \ninjunctive relief as and where appropriate, and that they be awarded: (a) actual damages for (i) \ntheir lost power to labor and earn money, (ii) their past and future mental and physical pain and \nsuffering, and (iii) any future medical and medication expenses they must bear as a result of \nDefendants' misconduct; (b) punitive damages; (c) costs; (d) attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§1988; (e) pre- and post-judgment interest on all sums awarded; and (f) all other relief to which \nthey are entitled under law or in equity. \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Gregory A.

In this class action brought pursuant to \n42 U.S.C.  § 1983,  approximately  1,200  Kentucky  inmates  with  Hepatitis  C  Virus  (HCV) \n(“Plaintiffs”) sued eight defendants who manage the Kentucky prison system’s HCV-treatment \nprogram (“Defendants”).  Plaintiffs claim that by triaging the HCV cure for the most seriously \naffected inmates, Defendants were deliberately indifferent to their serious medical needs, in \nviolation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The district court granted summary judgment \nfor Defendants, holding that Defendants adequately treated Plaintiffs.  We AFFIRM. \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 2\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nI.  FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA.  Hepatitis C Virus \nHCV is a bloodborne virus commonly spread by sharing contaminated needles, using \nunsterilized  tattoo  equipment,  and  engaging  in  sexual  behavior.    The  most  common  HCV \nsymptoms range from fatigue and jaundice to severe inflammation, skin lesions, and cognitive \nimpairment.  HCV is categorized as either acute or chronic.  In the acute phase, HCV does not \ncause noticeable symptoms and some people clear the virus from their systems within six to twelve \nmonths.  Those who do not clear the virus suffer from chronic HCV.1  In the chronic phase, HCV \nis progressive and attacks the liver, which, over time, causes scarring or fibrosis.  The rate at which \nthe virus causes scarring varies from person to person.  Some people might not develop scarring \nfor 20 to 30 years, while others might suffer accelerated scarring.  Between 20 and 40 percent of \npeople who have chronic HCV eventually develop cirrhosis, which is a severe condition causing \nthe liver’s affected areas to stop functioning.   \nThere is no vaccine for HCV.  In years past, doctors treated the virus with an injectable \nmedication called interferons.  This treatment is marginally effective; it requires that patients stay \nsober, causes several unpleasant side effects, and has a success rate of 30 percent.  Fortunately, in \n2011, the FDA approved a new class of drugs called direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which cure \nnearly all the HCV patients who take them.  But the treatment comes at a price; a single course of \ntreatment costs between $13,000 and $32,000. \n \n1 Medication is necessary to cure chronic HCV. \n-2- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 3\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nB.  HCV in Kentucky State Prisons \n  HCV infects about one percent of the United States population, but it is far more prevalent \nin prisons.  The Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC) estimates that about 1,200 of its \n12,000 inmates have HCV.   \n  In 2015, the KDOC implemented a new “HCV Treatment Plan,” which it updated in 2017, \n2018, and 2020.  This HCV Treatment Plan mostly mimics the Federal Bureau of Prison’s HCV \ntreatment protocol.  The 2018 version of the HCV Treatment Plan is at issue in this appeal and has \nseveral components, ranging from inmate screening to DAA treatment.   \nFirst, the KDOC screens its inmates for HCV.  It obtains all inmates’ health history and \ntests for antibodies inmates who (1) have certain clinical conditions such as a reported history of \nHCV or elevated levels of Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), (2) have risk factors such as blood-\ntransfusion treatment or sharing needles and tattoo guns, or (3) request HCV testing.   \nIf an inmate tests positive for HCV antibodies, the KDOC (1) evaluates the inmate for signs \nand symptoms of liver disease, (2) obtains additional laboratory tests, (3) calculates the inmate’s \nAPRI score (which is used to assess the degree of liver fibrosis, if any), (4) offers vaccines for \nhepatitis A, influenza, and pneumococcal, and (5) educates the inmate about chronic HCV.   \nFinally, the KDOC places each infected inmate into one of three priority groups based on \nseveral factors.  Inmates placed in priority level one, the highest level, have an APRI score of \nabove 2.0 and/or other comorbid medical conditions that warrant immediate treatment.  Inmates \nwith APRI scores between .07 and 2.0 and those with advanced fibrosis, diabetes, liver disease, or \nkidney disease comprise priority level two.  The KDOC places all other infected inmates in level \nthree.  There are, however, exceptions to the priority-level treatment system.  For example, an \n-3- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 4\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v.

As part of the inmate’s individualized care, KDOC Regional Medical Director, \nDr. Frederick Kemen, subject to his medical judgment, might order further testing as he deems \nnecessary, such as HCV genotyping or a FibroScan2 of the inmate’s liver.   \nBefore 2020, the HCV Treatment Plan required that HCV-infected inmates qualify for \nDAA treatment.  For example, an inmate is disqualified from receiving treatment if, among other \nthings, he or she (1) has a life expectancy of fewer than eighteen months, (2) had finished DAA \ntreatment and has since been reinfected with HCV, (3) had demonstrated an unwillingness or \ninability to adhere to rigorous medication regimens, or (4) did not have a clear conduct record for \ntwelve months before treatment (i.e., no positive drug tests, prison tattoos, nor inappropriate sexual \nbehavior).   \nC.

And Jessica Lawrence has been diagnosed with HCV but has not received DAA \ntreatment.   \nDefendants are various persons or entities charged with formulating and managing the \nHCV Treatment Plan and each person is sued in his or her individual capacity.  Rodney Ballard \nand LaDonna Thompson are former KDOC Commissioners.  Doug Crall, M.D., is the former \nMedical Director of the KDOC.  Cookie Crews is the KDOC Health Services Administrator.  \nFrederick Kemen, M.D., is responsible for managing the HCV Treatment Plan.  Denise Burkett is \nthe KDOC Medical Director, responsible for policies, procedures, and employment concerning the \ninmates’ medical care.  And Correct Care Solutions, Inc. provides medical services to KDOC \ninmates.   \nIn 2015, Ruben Salinas sued in Kentucky state court seeking a writ of mandamus to order \nthen-Commissioner LaDonna Thompson, the KDOC, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, to \ntreat his HCV.  In November 2016, Salinas filed a “First Amended Class-action Complaint,” \nadding Woodcock and Bramblett as plaintiffs, and Ballard, Crall, Crews, Kemen, and Correct Care \nSolutions as defendants.  In December 2016, Defendants removed the case to the District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Kentucky.  Nine months later, Lawrence moved to intervene, adding \nThompson’s successor and former Commissioner James Erwin, which the magistrate judge \ngranted.3  The district court certified Plaintiffs’ class as “all inmates in Kentucky prisons who have \nbeen diagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) for the purpose of \ninjunctive relief.”  The court appointed Salinas and Lawrence as class representatives.  Woodcock \nv. Correct Care Sols., LLC, No. 3:16-CV-00096-GFVT, 2019 WL 3068447, at *11 (E.D. Ky. July \n12, 2019). \n \n3 The district court eventually dismissed Erwin upon Plaintiffs’ motion. \n-5- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 6\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nAfter considerable motion practice, Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Class-action \nComplaint in which they alleged that Defendants, following the 2018 HCV Treatment Plan, failed \nto provide medical treatment to HCV inmates because they did not treat all HCV-infected inmates \nwith DAAs.  Specifically, Plaintiffs brought claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the \nEighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  on  the  ground  that  Defendants  acted  with  deliberate \nindifference to their serious medical needs, and under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nRehabilitation Act of 1978 for failure to reasonably accommodate their medical needs.  Plaintiffs \nalso brought state-law tort claims of negligence, gross negligence, and intentional infliction of \nemotional distress.  \nDefendants moved for summary judgment on all claims.  The district court dismissed \nWoodcock and Bramblett’s claims because they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies \nand because, inasmuch as their HCV has been cured, they cannot be members of the class.  The \ncourt granted summary judgment to Defendants on the § 1983, disability, and punitive damages \nclaims, and returned their state-law claims to Kentucky state court.  Woodcock v. Correct Care \nSols., LLC, No. 3:16-CV-00096, 2020 WL 556391, at *9 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 4, 2020). \nImportant to this appeal, the district court held that Plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendment  claims  failed  because  Plaintiffs  did  not  provide  evidence  demonstrating  that \nDefendants were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs.  According to the \ndistrict court, Plaintiffs failed to prove either the objective or subjective component of deliberate \nindifference.  In analyzing the objective component, the court determined that the KDOC provided \nadequate treatment for HCV-infected inmates by diagnosing HCV and monitoring its progression.  \nId. at *6.  As for the subjective component, the court concluded that the treatment was not so \ngrossly incompetent or excessive as to shock the conscience.  Id. at 6–7.  \n-6- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 7\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nPlaintiffs timely appeal the order granting summary judgment to Defendants on the § 1983 \nand punitive damages claims.  They argue that Defendants’ refusal to provide DAAs to every \nHCV-infected inmate amounts to deliberate indifference in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  \nII.  DISCUSSION \nWe review de novo the grant of summary judgment.  Laster v. City of Kalamazoo, 746 F.3d \n714, 726 (6th Cir. 2014).  In doing so, we view the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving party, but we need not draw unreasonable inferences in the \nnonmovant’s favor.  Audi AG v. D’Amato, 469 F.3d 534, 545 (6th Cir. 2006).  Summary judgment \nis appropriate if “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, \n322–23 (1986).  “The ultimate question is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement \nto require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter \nof law.”  Yates v. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharms., Inc., 808 F.3d 281, 290 (6th Cir. 2015) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). \nA.  Mootness \nBefore we reach the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, we must assess whether KDOC’s 2020 \namendments to the HCV Treatment Plan moot Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief.  In late 2020, \nwhile this appeal was pending, the KDOC informed the court that it had made several changes to \nthe HCV Treatment Plan.  First, it created an opt-out testing protocol by which all KDOC inmates \nare offered voluntary screening for HCV, including screening for those who initially refused.  \nSecond, it added birth cohort 1945–1965 to the plan’s priority-level-two criteria.  Third, it removed \nthe disqualification factor based on re-infection after previously receiving DAAs.  And fourth, it \n-7- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 8\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nelucidated that for patients who have not received DAAs, the no-disciplinary-infractions-within-\ntwelve-months exclusionary factor applies only to conduct that would compromise treatment.   \nArticle III of the United States Constitution limits the power of the federal courts to cases \nor controversies.  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  “The ‘case-or-controversy requirement subsists through \nall stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.’”  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, \n172 (2013) (quoting Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 (1990)).  A federal court \n“lacks jurisdiction to consider any case or issue that has lost its character as a present, live \ncontroversy and thereby becomes moot.”  Demis v. Sniezek, 558 F.3d 508, 512 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  “Simply stated, a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or \nthe parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Id. (quoting Int’l Union v. Dana \nCorp.,  697  F.2d  718,  720–21  (6th  Cir.  1983)  (en  banc)).    Therefore,  “[i]f  an  intervening \ncircumstance deprives the plaintiff of a ‘personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit,’ at any point \nduring litigation, the action can no longer proceed and must be dismissed as moot.”  Campbell-\nEwald Co. v. Gomez, 136 S. Ct. 663, 669 (2016) (quoting Genesis Healthcare Corp. v. Symczyk, \n569 U.S. 66, 72 (2013)).  But there is an exception to mootness that applies in this case.  That \nexception applies when “one issue in a case has become moot, but the case as a whole remains \nalive because other issues have not become moot.”  Dana Corp., 697 F.2d at 721 (quoting Univ. \nof Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 394 (1981)).  \nThe 2020 HCV Treatment Plan updates address only a portion of Plaintiffs’ challenges to \nthe 2018 HCV Treatment Plan.  Most notably, the changes do not address the core of Plaintiffs’ \n§ 1983 claim: whether Defendants are deliberately indifferent by refusing to treat each HCV-\ninfected  inmate  with  DAAs.    Defendants’  changes,  therefore,  do  not  divest  this  court  of \njurisdiction.   \n-8- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 9\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nB.  § 1983 Claim \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants’ refusal to provide DAAs to every HCV-infected inmate \namounted to deliberate indifference in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and \ntherefore the court erroneously granted Defendants summary judgment. \n“Section 1983 provides a federal cause of action against government officials who, while \nacting under color of state law, deprived the claimant of rights, privileges or immunities secured \nby the Constitution or laws of the United States.”  Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 735 (6th Cir. \n2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  A state prisoner’s Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights are “violated when prison doctors or officials are deliberately indifferent to the \nprisoner’s serious medical needs.”  Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 702 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976)); see Villegas v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville, 709 F.3d \n563, 569 (6th Cir. 2013) (prisoners’ claims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments “are \nanalyzed under the same rubric”).  To succeed on that claim, Plaintiffs must prove both an \nobjective and a subjective component.  Atkins v. Parker, 972 F.3d 734, 739 (6th Cir. 2020).  The \nobjective component “requires that the inmate have a sufficiently serious medical need such that \nshe is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.”  Ford v. County of \nGrand Traverse, 535 F.3d 483, 495 (6th Cir. 2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe subjective component requires proof that Defendants understood yet consciously disregarded \nthe substantial risk that the serious medical need posed to infected inmates.  Comstock, 273 F.3d \nat 703.  \nPlaintiffs’ § 1983 claim fails on the objective component, so we do not reach the subjective \ncomponent.  Here, the parties do not dispute that Plaintiffs have a serious medical need.  So, \nPlaintiffs need only prove that “the alleged deprivation of medical care was serious enough to \n-9- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 10\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nviolate  the  Eighth  Amendment,”  Rhinehart,  894  F.3d  at  737;  that  is,  that  it  amounted  to \nincarceration “under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,” Ford, 535 F.3d at 495 \n(citation omitted).  We apply two different standards to decide whether an inmate suffered a \nconstitutional deprivation.  One applies when an inmate receives no treatment for a serious medical \nneed, and the other applies when an inmate receives ongoing treatment.  \nUnder the no-treatment standard, when a physician diagnoses a serious medical need, “the \nplaintiff can establish the objective component by showing that the prison failed to provide \ntreatment.”  Rhinehart, 894 F.3d at 737.  Under the ongoing-treatment standard, a plaintiff can \nestablish the objective component by showing that the treatment was “so grossly incompetent, \ninadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.”  \nId. at 740 (citation omitted).  The inmate must proffer evidence that the care was inadequate and \nthat he or she suffered a detrimental effect as a result.  Id. at 737–38. \nThe district court applied the ongoing-treatment standard and determined that screening \nand monitoring HCV-infected inmates under the HCV Treatment Plan constituted treatment and \nthat that treatment was adequate under the Eighth Amendment.  Woodcock, 2020 WL 556391, at \n*5–6.  Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have applied the no-treatment standard because \nthe 2018 HCV Treatment Plan neither “alleviated” nor “cured” Plaintiffs’ HCV.  They assert that \nonly the cure provided by DAAs suffices as treatment.  \nWe cannot agree that Plaintiffs received no treatment at all, and at least two of our sister \ncircuits and the Supreme Court have held similarly.  In Roy v. Lawson, 739 F. App’x 266, 266–67 \n(5th Cir. 2018) (per curiam), the Fifth Circuit rejected an inmate’s argument that even though the \nprison’s “medical personnel regularly . . . monitor[ed] his condition through lab work and blood \ntesting,” he received no treatment because the prison failed to give him “the optimum drug \n-10- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 11\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \ntherapies for Hepatitis C.”  In Black v. Alabama Dep’t of Corr., 578 F. App’x 794, 795–96 (11th \nCir. 2014) (per curiam), the Eleventh Circuit rejected an inmate’s characterization of the case as \n“a case of denied or delayed treatment” because the prison did not “consider[ ] [him] for antiviral \ndrug treatment,” and noted that the prisoner “received regular care and monitoring for his Hepatitis \nC and medication for his symptoms.”  And the Supreme Court has held that “X-ray[s] or additional \ndiagnostic techniques” are “forms of treatment.”  Gamble, 429 U.S. at 107.  Like the prisons’ plans \nin Roy and Black, the KDOC plan provides for treatment in the form of diagnosing and monitoring \nHCV-infected inmates.  \nPlaintiffs are ultimately complaining about the adequacy of their treatment.  But an \ninmate’s  “disagreement  with  the  testing  and treatment  he  has  received,”  or  his  “desire  for \nadditional or different treatment,” does not amount to an Eighth Amendment violation.  Rhinehart, \n894 F.3d at 740 (citation omitted).  Here, Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that would allow \nany reasonable factfinder to conclude that Plaintiffs’ treatment was “so grossly incompetent, \ninadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.”  \nId. at 737 (citation omitted).   \nThe 2018 HCV Treatment Plan provided treatment for Plaintiffs that consisted of several \nprotocols to diagnose and monitor HCV inmates and ultimately administer the expensive DAA \ntreatments to those in immediate need.  All inmates could opt-in for testing and, for those who \ntested positive, the KDOC regularly evaluated their health status, monitored their APRI score, and \nvaccinated them to mitigate further health risks.  Perhaps most importantly, the KDOC’s flexible \nprioritization system enabled Dr. Kemen to exercise his medical judgment and order for inmates \nmore accurate diagnostic testing such as HCV genotyping or a FibroScan so Defendants could \n-11- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 12\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \ntreat with DAAs those inmates in serious need of immediate antiviral treatment, regardless of their \nplace in the prioritization system.  \nBecause Plaintiffs failed to show that the 2018 HCV Treatment Plan put them at substantial \nrisk of serious harm, they cannot show that Defendants were deliberately indifferent.  There is no \nEighth or Fourteenth Amendment violation.  \nC.  Punitive Damages \nPlaintiffs are not entitled to punitive damages for two reasons.  First, Plaintiffs failed to \nshow that Defendants were deliberately indifferent.  See Brown v. Brown, 46 F. App’x 324, 325 \n(6th Cir. 2002) (explaining that punitive damages are only available in actions brought under \n§ 1983 “when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when \nit involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of the plaintiff” (citing \nSmith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983)).  Second, the class-action complaint sought only injunctive \nrelief.  Plaintiffs moved for class certification without mention of punitive damages and the district \ncourt’s Rule 23(b)(2) analysis and subsequent certification limited the class action to injunctive \nrelief.   \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. \n   \n-12- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 13\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nJANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.  Inmate \npopulations in prisons across America have significantly higher percentages of chronic Hepatitis \nC infections than occur in the general public.  Many inmates are infected while in correctional \nfacilities.  Kentucky has a measured incidence of HCV that is more than twice the national rate.  \nThis case challenges the constitutionality of Defendants’ policies governing testing and medical \nresponse to inmates with HCV.  I agree with the majority that the changes to KDOC’s HCV plan \ndo not divest us of jurisdiction and that punitive damages are not available to the class that was \ncertified by the district court.  I respectfully dissent from the remainder of the opinion.   \nThe Sixth Circuit has repeatedly held that HCV is a serious medical condition under the \nEighth Amendment.  And this record contains testimony from which a reasonable jury could find \nthat most Defendants were aware of the risks posed to Plaintiffs by chronic, untreated HCV, and \nrecklessly disregarded those risks by rationing the prescription of DAAs and by conducting opt-in \nHCV testing of inmates rather than opt-out testing.  That evidence creates issues of fact as to \nwhether Defendants were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiffs’ serious medical needs, making the \nsummary judgment grant to Defendants on Plaintiffs’ Eighth Amendment claim inappropriate.  \nI begin with Plaintiffs’ claim that Defendants’ failure to provide them with DAAs violates \nthe Eighth Amendment.  As the majority explains, the objective component is satisfied when an \ninmate is incarcerated under conditions posing a “substantial risk of serious harm,” Farmer v. \nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828 (1994), such as when he has a serious medical need and receives no \ntreatment for it, Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 737 (6th Cir. 2018).  Where the inmate has \nreceived some treatment for a serious medical need, however, he must present evidence from \nwhich  a  reasonable  jury  could  conclude  that  the  treatment  was  “so  grossly  incompetent, \ninadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.”  \n-13- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 14\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nId. at 737 (quoting Miller v. Calhoun Cnty., 408 F.3d 803, 819 (6th Cir. 2005)).  This is a \n“particularized, fact-specific inquiry.”  Miller, 408 F.3d at 819 (quoting Terrance v. Northville \nReg’l Psychiatric Hosp., 286 F.3d 834, 844 (6th Cir. 2001)).  \nWe have held—and the parties and the majority do not dispute—that hepatitis C is an \nobjectively serious medical condition.  See Atkins v. Parker, 972 F.3d 734, 739 (6th Cir. 2020).  \nThe question, then, is whether a reasonable jury could find that the monitoring provided to \nPlaintiffs by the KDOC constitutes no treatment or grossly inadequate treatment.   \n“Treatment,” as defined in relevant part by Merriam-Webster, is “the action or way of \ntreating a patient or condition medically or surgically: management and care to prevent, cure, \nameliorate or slow progression of a medical condition.”  Treatment, Merriam-Webster.com, \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/treatment (last visited June 23, 2021).  Similarly, \nthe American Heritage Dictionary defines “treatment” as “[t]he use of an agent, procedure, or \nregimen, such as a drug, surgery, or exercise, in an attempt to cure or mitigate a disease, condition, \nor  injury.”    Treatment,  The  American  Heritage  Dictionary  of  the  English  Language, \nhttps://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=treatment (last visited June 23, 2021).  In \nother words, a “treatment” is a course of decisions and actions intended to improve a medical \ncondition in some way.   \nInmates with HCV who do not qualify for DAAs do not receive medical care aimed at \ncuring or mitigated their disease.  Instead, they are simply monitored, undergoing retests every \nthree or six months depending on the current status of their disease, using tests that Plaintiffs argue \nare frequently inaccurate.1  The results of these tests are used to determine whether, under the \n \n1 According to Plaintiffs, APRI scores indicate only whether a patient’s liver is irritated \nand emitting AST enzymes, not whether it is scarred—indeed, a heavily scarred liver may be \nincapable of emitting any enzymes.  High APRI scores only detect cirrhosis at a rate of 48 percent, \n-14- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 15\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nKDOC plan, Plaintiffs are eligible for treatment with DAAs.  So the tests themselves do nothing \nto alleviate an inmate’s symptoms or mitigate the progression of the disease, and they have no \ndiagnostic function.  Instead, viewing the record in Plaintiffs’ favor, as we must, the tests are a \ntool for Defendants to assess whether a given inmate’s disease has cleared the bureaucratic \nthreshold—sufficiently advanced fibrosis—to be eligible for treatment under the protocol.  Testing \nof how far HCV has advanced in harming an inmate’s body is not treatment.  Indeed, throughout \nhis deposition, Dr. Kemen referred to the testing protocol as “monitoring” that helped him decide \nwhich inmates would receive “treatment.”   \nEven if we assume that monitoring qualifies as treatment, there is substantial evidence from \nwhich  a  jury  might  conclude  that  treatment  is  constitutionally  inadequate.    “The  objective \ncomponent of an Eighth Amendment claim is . . . contextual and responsive to ‘contemporary \nstandards  of  decency.’”    Hudson  v.  McMillian,  503  U.S.  1,  8  (1992)  (quoting  Estelle  v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976)).  HCV may manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including \ndiabetes, neurocognitive dysfunction, porphyria cutanea tarda (a condition that causes painful \nlesions on sun-exposed skin), headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and skin conditions.  And \nit causes mostly irreversible liver scarring, increasing patients’ risk of liver cancer and liver failure \neven after their HCV has been cured.  Indeed, once an individual develops advanced liver disease, \nhe must undergo cancer screening at regular intervals for the rest of his life, even after being cured \nof the underlying HCV infection.  Chronic untreated HCV also increases a patient’s risk of heart \ndisease,  cancer,  kidney  disease,  immune  disease,  and  diabetes.    According  to  studies, \nadministering HCV treatment at an early stage of fibrosis increases overall survival rates for \n \nwhich Plaintiffs argue means that Defendants’ screening criteria may be missing 52 percent of \nindividuals whose livers are actively cirrhotic. \n \n-15- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 16\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \npatients compared with treatment at a later stage.  As a result of the increased risk to life posed by \nlate treatment, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious \nDiseases  Society  of  America  (AASLD/IDSA)  recommend  administering  DAAs—which  are \nhighly efficacious and nearly side-effect-free—to most patients with chronic HCV without regard \nto their degree of fibrosis.  No other treatment is recommended.  Treatment with DAAs regardless \nof fibrosis score is also the standard of care set by the Centers for Disease Control, the Centers for \nMedicare  &  Medicaid  Services,  the  Veteran’s  Administration,  and  multiple  state  Medicaid \nsystems, including Kentucky’s.

(2017), available at https://stateofhepc.org/wp-\ncontent/themes/infinite-child/reports/HCV_Report_Kentucky.pdf.  \nPlaintiffs’ evidence suggests that by flouting the recognized standard of care, KDOC \nconsigns thousands of prisoners with symptomatic, chronic HCV to years of additional suffering \nand irreversible liver scarring, despite the availability of early treatment with effective, easily \ntolerated alternatives that would prevent those long-term harms.  Indeed, “delaying treatment for \n-16- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 17\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \ninmates  with  chronic  hepatitis  C  causes  precisely  the  type  of  ‘substantial  risk  of  serious \nharm,’ see Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837 [], routinely recognized in the Eighth Amendment context.”  \nAtkins, 972 F.3d at 741 (Gilman, J., dissenting).  Plaintiffs’ claim is therefore more than a mere \n“disagreement” with the essentially adequate testing and treatment they have already received.  \nRhinehart, 894 F.3d at 740.  Instead, they offered substantial evidence that Defendants’ decision \nto withhold that treatment from most inmates and provide only testing for administrative purposes \nis “so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable \nto fundamental fairness.”  Id. at 737 (quoting Miller, 408 F.3d at 819).  A reasonable jury could \nagree, and so summary judgment on the objective prong is inappropriate. \nThe majority opinion concludes, however, that KDOC’s testing is undisputedly adequate \ntreatment.  In deciding to apply the “ongoing treatment” standard, the majority relies on two \nunpublished, out-of-circuit cases, which do not govern here, and the Supreme Court’s decision in \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 107 (1976)).  But in Gamble, unlike in this case, the plaintiff had \nalready received some treatment—the doctor identified his injury as a lower back strain, and \nprescribed bed rest and medications.  Id.  The plaintiff objected that his doctor was constitutionally \nrequired to do more “by way of diagnosis and treatment,” but the Supreme Court disagreed, \nholding that “the question whether an X-ray or additional diagnostic techniques or forms of \ntreatment is indicated is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment,”2 and the decision \n“not to order . . . like measures[] does not represent cruel and unusual punishment.”  Id.  This \ndiscussion was focused on whether the doctor, who had undisputedly provided some treatment and \n \n2 A close reading of this language illustrates the majority opinion is incorrect in stating that \n“the Supreme Court has held that ‘X-ray[s] or additional diagnostic techniques’ are ‘forms of \ntreatment.’”  Maj. Op. at 11 (quoting Gamble, 429 U.S. at 107).  The Court’s use of the disjunctive \n“or” suggests instead that X-rays and diagnostic techniques are not forms of treatment. \n \n-17- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 18\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \ndecided that further action was not medically necessary, had the subjective state of mind required \nfor an Eighth Amendment claim.  It is not applicable to the issue here:  whether a protocol that \nauthorizes only testing for most inmates and allocates treatment according to an administrative \nguideline  rather  than  medical  judgment,  is  objectively  adequate  under  the  Constitution.  \nA reasonable jury could conclude that the protocol is not an exercise of medical judgment that \nresults in an excusable “inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care.”  See id. at 105.   \nThat  the  KDOC  plan  permits  the  medical  director  to  order  further  testing  or  make \nexceptions to the prioritization system does not alter this conclusion.  First, there is evidence in the \nrecord to suggest Dr. Kemen rarely exercised that discretion.  He testified that at the time of his \ndeposition, no priority level 3 inmates were receiving treatment, only monitoring.  And an undated \npatient log of his  shows that at the time, only 13 of 76 priority level 2 patients had received \ntreatment, while 2 of 68 priority level 3 patients had received treatment.  Moreover, his testimony \nsuggested that when he did make exceptions, his decisions were constrained by the KDOC’s \nmedically unsupported, cost-driven administrative rule that only patients with advanced fibrosis \nmay receive treatment.  For example, he testified, he reviews the “chronic care labs and notes” for \npatients at priority levels 1 and 2 to determine “whether they’re progressing or not.”  A reasonable \njury could therefore find that even though the KDOC plan gives the medical director some level \nof flexibility, he is not ultimately exercising independent medical judgment. \nOur recent decision in Atkins further demonstrates that issues of fact remain as to the \nobjective prong.  In that case, a class of inmates challenged the HCV treatment policy of the \nTennessee Department of Corrections (TDOC), under which infected inmates receive blood testing \nand monitoring, and the inmates with the most extensive liver scarring receive treatment with \nDAAs.  972 F.3d at 737–38.  Like the majority today, the Atkins district court concluded that the \n-18- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 19\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nTDOC policy constituted treatment that was not “so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive \nas to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness,” and so the objective prong \nwas not met.  Atkins v. Parker, 412 F. Supp. 3d 761, 778, 782 (M.D. Tenn. 2019) (quoting \nRhinehart, 894 F.3d at 749).  On appeal, however, we simply concluded that “[e]veryone agree[d] \nthat hepatitis C is an objectively serious medical condition,” and that the defendant understood the \nrisks of the disease; the only question was whether he had the requisite subjective intent.  Atkins, \n972 F.3d at 739.  We did not ask whether the defendant’s monitoring plan constituted treatment or \nwhether it was adequate, despite the district court’s conclusions and the parties’ briefing on the \nissue.  (See Br. of Plaintiff-Appellant at 22–30, Atkins v. Parker, 972 F.3d 734 (6th Cir. 2020); Br. \nof Defendant-Appellee at 23–35, Atkins v. Parker, 972 F.3d 734 (6th Cir. 2020))  This suggests \nthe Atkins decision recognized that the objective prong was satisfied, as it is here. \nThe subjective prong requires that defendants knew of and disregarded an excessive risk \nto the inmate’s health and safety.  Winkler v. Madison Cnty., 893 F.3d 877, 890–91 (6th Cir. 2018).  \nFor that prong, “a decision to provide an ‘easier and less efficacious treatment’ may suffice to \nestablish deliberate indifference.”  Darrah v. Krisher, 865 F.3d 361, 372 (6th Cir. 2017) (quoting \nWarren v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., 576 Fed. App’x. 545, 552 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Estelle, \n429 U.S. at 104 n. 10)).   \nHere, there is ample evidence that Defendants were well aware of the long-term harm \ncaused  by delaying  treatment  for HCV  and  the  universal  medical  recommendation  that  all \nindividuals  with  chronic  HCV  should  be  prescribed  DAAs.    Yet  according  to  Defendants \nthemselves, they chose not to administer DAAs to all inmates because of the cost of the drugs, a \ndecision that exposed inmates to ongoing suffering and long-term organ damage.  That is not a \nmedical judgment to which deference could be granted—it is an impermissible decision to avoid \n-19- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 20\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nproviding “the only effective treatment” to most inmates on the sole basis that rationing care is \n“easier” and cheaper.  Darrah, 865 F.3d at 372.  As Judge Gilman persuasively argued in his \ndissent in Atkins, lack of funding is no excuse for a constitutional violation.  972 F.3d at 742–46; \nsee also Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 537 (1963).  Doctors may consider cost in \nchoosing among several reasonable options, but they may not “refuse to treat a patient who has a \nserious medical need . . . merely to avoid paying the bill.”  Id. (citing Darrah, 865 F.3d at 372); \nsee also Petties v. Carter, 836 F.3d 722, 730 (7th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (“While the cost of treatment \nis a factor in determining what constitutes adequate, minimum-level care, medical personnel \ncannot simply resort to an easier course of treatment that they know is ineffective.”).  A reasonable \njury could therefore find that the KDOC plan violates the Eighth Amendment. \nThe majority opinion does not address the branch of Plaintiffs’ claim based on KDOC’s \nHCV testing protocol.  Under the 2018 KDOC plan, new inmates had to opt in to receive HCV \ntesting; Plaintiffs contend testing should be opt-out.3  Due to the significantly higher HCV rates \n \n3 The 2020 KDOC plan implements opt-out testing, which Defendants argue moots \nPlaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.  Voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct will only moot a \ncase when “subsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could \nnot reasonably be expected to occur.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Servs. \n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export \nAss’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)).  Although governmental actions are presumed to be in good \nfaith, ad hoc or discretionary administrative actions receive less solicitude.  Speech First, Inc. v. \nSchlissel, 939 F.3d 756, 767–68 (6th Cir. 2019).  Here, KDOC has offered no guarantees that it \nwill  not  revert  to  the  opt-in  testing  protocol,  and  it  maintains  that  its  previous  plan  was \nconstitutional.  “Although not dispositive, the Supreme Court has found whether the government \n‘vigorously defends the constitutionality of its . . . program’ important to the mootness inquiry.”  \nId. at 770 (alteration in original) (quoting Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. \n1, 551 U.S. 701, 719 (2007)).  Further, this Court has held, the cessation of conduct in response to \nlitigation “shows a greater likelihood that it could be resumed.”  Northland Family Planning \nClinic, Inc. v. Cox, 487 F.3d 323, 342–43 (6th Cir. 2007); Schlissel, 939 F.3d at 769 (university’s \naction after complaint was filed “raise[d] suspicions that its cessation [was] not genuine” and \n“increase[d] [its] burden to prove that its change is genuine”).  KDOC failed to satisfy its burden \nof demonstrating that it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not \nreasonably be expected to recur.”  Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189. \n-20- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 21\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nwithin correctional facilities, the AASLD/IDSA and the federal Bureau of Prisons recommend \nconducting opt-out testing in prisons.  Opt-in testing, Plaintiffs argue, fails to capture many \ninfected inmates, placing them at substantial risk of disease and long-term harm without diagnosis \nand treatment, and exposes uninfected inmates to a high risk of infection.   \nDefendants testified that they are aware of the increased risk of HCV transmission within \nprisons and recognize that undetected HCV infections pose a risk to other inmates.  Burkett, for \nexample, explained that when infected people do not know they have HCV, that “absolutely” \ncontributes to the spread of infection.  And it is KDOC policy that once someone tests positive for \nHCV, they are prohibited from working in food services or beauty shops because of the risk of \ntransmission.  Defendants could offer no reason for implementing opt-in testing, except Kemen’s \nclaim that this is the “tradition.”  But that decision is at odds with the fact that KDOC tests inmates \nfor syphilis and tuberculosis at intake, and the fact that an HCV antibody test costs only eight \ndollars. \nA reasonable jury could determine from this evidence that Defendants are aware HCV \ninfection is widespread among KDOC inmates and in KDOC facilities and poses a risk to the \nprison population at large.  That jury could also conclude that Defendants chose to turn a blind eye \nto these dangers by implementing opt-in testing.  Refusing to confirm or act on inferences of risk \nthat a medical professional “strongly suspect[s] to exist” is the essence of recklessness.  See \nRouster v. Cty. of Saginaw, 749 F.3d 437, 451 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 843 \nn.8). \nChronic HCV subjects infected inmates to substantial risks of serious harm—from pain to \ndisabling conditions to cirrhosis and to death.  No one disputes that those risks increase the longer \na person is infected.  Yet instead of providing testing and treatment once an infection is detected—\n-21- \n \n\nCase: 20-5170     Document: 42-2     Filed: 07/06/2021     Page: 22\nNo. 20-5170, Woodcock v. Correct Care Solutions \n \n \nthe  standard  of  care  universally  advocated  by  medical  and  public  health  professionals—\nDefendants have implemented a care-rationing plan that withholds medical treatment until the \ndamage caused by an inmate’s chronic Hepatitis C infection has progressed too far to be reversible.  \nAnd while that disease is spreading throughout the Kentucky prison system, the KDOC protocol \ntests only those inmates who opt in, exposing other inmates to a heightened risk of infection.  A \nreasonable jury could find this to be evidence of deliberate indifference to a substantial risk to \ninmate health, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  I would therefore reverse the judgment of \nthe district court and remand this case for trial. \n \n-22- \n ",

The Plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of all Kentucky \ninmates also diagnosed with the Hepatitis C virus who are also under the care of Defendants.  \nAdditionally, they seek injunctive relief regarding the Defendants’ diagnostic and treatment \npractices.  For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees that class certification is appropriate.  \nHowever, the Plaintiffs’ motion for injunctive relief fails to allege sufficient facts to establish a \nconstitutional violation. \nI  \n  The facts necessary to resolve these issues are largely uncontested.  The named Plaintiffs \nin this matter, Ruben Rios Salinas, Brian Woodcock, Keath Bramblett, and Jessica Lawrence, are \ninmates, incarcerated with the Kentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC).  [R. 1-2 at ¶ 3; R. \n36 at ¶ 1.]  Each has been diagnosed with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Id.  Defendants are \nvarious official and nonofficial entities, all sued in their individual capacities, charged with \nmanaging the HCV treatment plan for and providing care to inmates.  [R. 1-2 at ¶¶ 5–15.] \n\n  Plaintiffs believe they have not been provided constitutionally adequate treatment for \ntheir HCV infections.  [R. 134; R. 135.]  Defendants do not contest the facts surrounding the care \nPlaintiffs have received, but disagree that such care is inadequate.  [R. 140 at 3–4.]  According to \nresearch provided by the Plaintiffs, only around 1% of Americans suffer from HCV, but \nincarcerated populations experience a significantly higher incidence: at least ten percent, and as \nmany as forty percent, of the inmate population suffers from HCV.  [R. 134 at 2.]  KDOC has \nallegedly diagnosed approximately ten percent of their inmates with HCV, though Plaintiffs \nbelieve the true number of HCV-positive inmates could be higher.  Id. at 3.   \n  According to literature provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC), HCV is a blood-borne virus which causes a liver infection known as Hepatitis C.  \nHepatitis C Information, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv (last visited June 5, 2019).  The infection begins as “acute \nhepatitis C,” which occurs within the first six months after exposure, but left untreated can \nevolve into “chronic hepatitis C.”  Hepatitis C Questions and Answers for the Public, CENTERS \nFOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/cfaq.htm#overview \n(last visited June 5, 2019).  The CDC indicates people with acute hepatitis C should only be \nconsidered for treatment if the infection becomes chronic.  Id. \n  Since approval in 2011, direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have been successful in \neliminating the virus in HCV patients.  [R. 135-1 at 3.]  DAAs boast both a higher cure rate as \nwell as a higher initial price tag.  Id. at 3–7.  Plaintiffs bring this action, in part, because the \nDefendants “ration” DAA treatment, only giving DAA treatment to approximately five percent \nof the infected population.  [R. 134 at 3.]  Defendants do not disagree with Plaintiffs’ facts, and \ndo not claim to be giving DAA treatment to all HCV patients.  Instead, Defendants argue that \n2 \n \n\ngiving DAAs to all HCV-infected is not recommended, and “inmates receive differing levels of \nmonitoring and testing specific to their HCV.”  [R. 139 at 8; R. 140 at 4–5.] \nII \nA \n  As an initial matter, Plaintiffs have requested the Court certify a class of “all HCV-\ninfected inmates in Kentucky prisons for the purpose of injunctive relief.”  [R. 134 at 9.]  \nFollowing that request, Plaintiffs have also filed a motion for permanent injunction “requiring \nDefendants to adopt policies that meet the standard of care,” specifically requesting opt-out \nscreening and direct acting antiviral treatment for all HCV-infected inmates.  [R. 135 at 4.]   \nThis Court has broad discretion in deciding whether to certify a proposed class.  \nPipefitters Local 636 Ins. Fund v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mich., 654 F.3d 618, 629 (6th Cir. \n2011); In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir. 1996).  This is so because a  “class \naction is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the \nindividual named parties only,’” and is subject to strict requirements under Rule 23.  Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 348 (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, \n700–01 (1979)).  To warrant certification, class members must not only satisfy Article III \nstanding requirements, but must also “satisfy all four of the Rule 23(a) prerequisites—\nnumerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate representation—and fall within one of the \nthree types of class actions listed in Rule 23(b).”  Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d \n532, 537 (6th Cir. 2012) (citing Sprague v. Gen. Motors Corp., 133 F.3d 388, 397 (6th Cir. 1998) \n(en banc)).  “The party seeking class certification has the burden to prove the Rule 23 \ncertification requirements.”  Id. (citing In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d at 1079).  The party \nopposing certification need not disprove the requirements.  See id.  \n3 \n \n\nThe requirements for standing outlined by Article III of the United States Constitution \napply equally to class action lawsuits.  Sutton v. St. Jude Medical S.C., Inc., 419 F.3d 568, 570 \n(6th Cir. 2005).  The “irreducible” constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements: \nan injury in fact, a causal connection, and likely redressability.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  The plaintiff in a suit must have suffered an “injury in fact,” \ndefined as “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, \nand (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Id. at 560 (internal citations \nomitted).  Next, the plaintiff must demonstrate a “causal connection” between this injury and the \nalleged conduct of the defendant; “the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of \nthe defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the \ncourt.”  Id. (internal citations omitted).  Finally, a favorable decision for the plaintiff must likely \nredress this injury, and relief must be more than merely speculative.  Id. at 561.  \nPlaintiffs seeking the certification of a class must prove two additional components in \norder to show they have standing to proceed as a class.  The proposed class must be identifiable \nand unambiguous, and the named representatives must be members of the proposed class.  \nPilgrim v. Universal Health Card, LLC, No. 5:09-cv-879, 2010 WL 1254849, *1 (N.D. Ohio \nMar. 25, 2010), aff’d, 660 F.3d 943 (6th Cir. 2011).  In a properly defined class, only members \nwho have standing to file suit in their own right would be included.  Chaz Concrete Co., LLC v. \nCodell, No. 3:03-cv-52-KKC, 2006 WL 2453302, at *6 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 23, 2006).  For that \nreason, the Court may deem a proposed class overly broad if such a class would incorporate \nmembers who neither have suffered harm nor are at risk to suffer such harm at the hands of the \ndefendant.  Id. (quoting McGee v. East Ohio Gas Co., 200 F.R.D. 382, 388 (S.D. Ohio 2001).   \n4 \n \n\nThe Court is not required to inquire into the merits of the case in order to determine \nwhether a person is a member of a class.  Bostick v. St. Jude Med., Inc., No. 03-2626 BV, 2004 \nWL 3313614, *16 (W.D. Tenn. 2004).  Rather, “[f]or a class to be sufficiently defined, the court \nmust be able to resolve the question of whether class members are included or excluded from the \nclass by reference to objective criteria.”  Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532, 538 \n(6th Cir. 2012) (quoting 5 James W. Moore, et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 23.21[3] \n(Matthew Bender, 3d ed. 1997)).  Plaintiffs, as the party invoking jurisdiction, bear the burden of \nproof on each requirement for standing.  Id.; see also Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, \n560 (6th Cir. 2007).  The parties generally agree on the pertinent facts, arguing instead over \nwhether the care provided by Defendants is inadequate as a matter of law. \nDefendants arguments that the proposed class lacks standing, specifically because \nPlaintiffs Brian Woodcock and Keath Bramblett have received anti-viral treatments and are \ntherefore “cured,” are misplaced.  [R. 138 at 15.]  The proposed class includes only those \ninmates who are infected with HCV.  [R. 134 at 9.]  However, if Mr. Woodcock and Mr. \nBramblett are no longer infected with HCV, neither Mr. Woodcock nor Mr. Bramblett would be \nconsidered a member of the class.  Their infection status does not destroy standing for the \nmembers of the proposed class who are infected with HCV.  The Court therefore denies \nDefendants’ claims that the class, defined as “all HCV-infected inmates in Kentucky prisons,” \n[R. 134 at 9], lacks standing.  However, in doing so, the Court reserves ruling on whether Mr. \nWoodcock and Mr. Bramblett are proper members of the class until that issue is properly before \nthe Court. \nBecause at this stage any Article III issues in this case are dependent on whether a class is \ncertified, the final determination of standing will be resolved as informed by Rule 23.  Amchem \n5 \n \n\nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 612–13 (1997).  This Court “therefore follow[s] the path” \ntaken by the Supreme Court, “mindful that Rule 23’s requirements must be interpreted in \nkeeping with Article III constraints, and with the Rules Enabling Act, which instructs that rules \nof procedure ‘shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.’”  Id. at 613 (quoting \n28 U.S.C. § 2072(b)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 82. \n1 \nA prospective class must meet a total of seven independent requirements.  Two of these \ncriteria stem from Article III’s standing mandates: “an identifiable class must exist, and the \ndefinition of the class must be unambiguous, and the named representative must be a member of \nthe class.”  Pilgrim v. Universal Health Card, LLC, No. 5:09-cv-879, 2010 WL 1254849, *1 \n(N.D. Ohio Mar. 25, 2010), aff'd, 660 F.3d 943 (6th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  The \nremaining five requirements originate in Rule 23(a) and 23(b): \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there \nare questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the \nrepresentative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \nFinally, “In addition to the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), a party seeking class \ncertification must show that the class action is maintainable under Rule 23(b).” \n \nId. (citations omitted).  There must be a statement of the facts indicating that each requirement of \nthe rule is fulfilled.  Pipefitters Local 636 Ins. Fund v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mich., 654 F.3d \n618, 629 (6th Cir. 2011). \n“Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard.  A party seeking class certification \nmust affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, \n564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011).  Dukes verified that the district court should not merely presume that \nthe plaintiffs’ allegations in the complaint are true for the purposes of class motion without \nresolving factual and legal issues.  See Gooch v. Life Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 672 F.3d 402, 417 \n6 \n \n\n(6th Cir. 2012); see also In re Am. Med. Sys. Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1081 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding \nthat individual proofs, which “vary from plaintiff to plaintiff,” do not satisfy Rule 23(a)).  \nRather, this Court must “probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification \nquestion.”1  Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 \n(1982)). \na \nInitially, Rule 23(a)(1) requires a proposed class to be “so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”  A proposed class may satisfy this requirement by demonstrating the \nimpracticality of joinder.  See, e.g., Fox v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., 172 F.R.D. 653, 660 (E.D. \nMich. 1995) (“The numerosity requirement mandates that the joinder of all plaintiffs be \nimpracticable—not impossible.”).  There is no magic number or strict test for determining \nimpracticality of joinder.  Senter v. General Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 523 n. 24 (6th Cir. \n1976).  “When class size reaches substantial proportions . . . the impracticability requirement is \nusually satisfied by the numbers alone.”  In re Am. Med. Sys. Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1079 (6th Cir. \n1996); see also 1 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions, § 3.11 (3d ed. \n2011).   \nRegardless, in determining practicability, a court should also consider the geographic \ndispersion of the proposed class, the sophistication of proposed class members, and the \nreluctance of individual class members to sue.  7A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and \nProcedure § 1762 (3d. ed.); see also Roman v. Korson, 152 F.R.D. 101, 105–06 (W.D. Mich. \n                                                 \n1 Generally, courts should not consider the merits of a suit at the class certification stage.  Eisen v. Carlisle and \nJacqueline, 417 U.S. 156, 177–78 (1974) (“We find nothing in either the language or history of Rule 23 that \ngives a court any authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine \nwhether it may be maintained as a class action.”).  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, however, indicates some \nflux within the law, noting that “some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim” is inevitable \nat the class certification stage.  564 U.S. at 351. \n7 \n \n\n1993); Young v. Trailwood Lakes, Inc., 61 F.R.D. 666, 668 (E.D. Ky. 1974).  “When a class \nnumbers in the hundreds or thousands, the impracticability of joinder is obvious.”  Mich. State \nUniv. Faculty Ass’n v. Mich. State Univ., 93 F.R.D. 54, 56 n. 1 (W.D. Mich. 1981); see also \nNewberg at § 3:12.  For that reason, proposed classes with hundreds of members are routinely \nheld to satisfy the numerosity requirement.  Mich. State Univ. Faculty Ass’n, 93 F.R.D. at 56.  In \nfact, courts have certified classes with as few as eighteen members.  See, e.g., Cypress v. \nNewport News Gen. and Nonsectarian Hosp. Ass’n, 375 F.2d 648, 653 (4th Cir. 1967) (“We \nfurther are of the opinion that eighteen is a sufficiently large number to constitute a class.”); see \nalso Brady v. Thurston Motor Lines, 726 F.2d 136, 145 (4th Cir. 1984) (“[W]e are unwilling as a \nmatter of law to hold that a class of 74 persons does not meet the requirement of numerosity.”).  \nSome courts hold that “a class of 40 or more members is sufficient to establish numerosity.”  \nAppoloni v. United States, 218 F.R.D. 556, 561 (W.D. Mich. 2003).  All of this leads to the \nconclusion that, in determining whether to certify a class, it is not necessary for a court to know \nthe precise number of class members.  Rather, the Court may rely upon reasonable inferences \ndrawn from the known facts.  In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d at 1079. \nPlaintiffs assert their proposed class would contain at least 1,200 Kentucky inmates, and \npossibly as many as 5,000 Kentucky inmates, who are infected with HCV.  [R. 134 at 6.]  None \nof the Defendants contest Plaintiff’s claims of numerosity.  [R. 138; R. 141 at 3–4.]  Because the \nnumber of potential class members reaches into the thousands, in addition to the geographic \ndispersion of the potential members across the state of Kentucky, the Court finds Plaintiffs have \nsatisfied the requirement to prove numerosity. \n \n \n8 \n \n\nb \nNext, in order for a class to be certified under Rule 23(a)(2), there must be “questions of \nlaw or fact common to the class.”  This is because, where there are common questions of law or \nfact, “the class-action device saves the resources of both the courts and the parties by permitting \nan issue potentially affecting every class member to be litigated in an economical fashion under \nRule 23.”  Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 155 (1982) (quoting Califano v. \nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700–01 (1979)).  Traditionally, it has been the rule that to satisfy the \ncommonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2), only one single issue that is common to all members \nof the class is required, not multiple issues.2  In re Am. Med. Sys. Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1080 (6th \nCir. 1996); Alkire v. Irving, 330 F.3d 802, 820 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Although Rule 23(a)(2) refers to \ncommon questions of law or fact, in the plural, there need only be one question common to the \nclass—though that question must be a ‘common issue the resolution of which will advance the \nlitigation.’”) (quoting Sprague v. Gen. Motors, 133 F.3d 388, 397 (6th Cir. 1998)).  The language \nof commonality, however, “is easy to misread, since ‘[a]ny competently crafted class complaint \nliterally raises common “questions.”’”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011) \n(quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 97, 131–132 (April 2009)).  The essential commonality inquiry, therefore, is not whether \ncommon questions exist, “but rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common \nanswers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.”  Id. at 350 (quoting Nagareda, supra, at \n132).  Dissimilarities between members of the proposed class can potentially impede the \n                                                 \n2 Many courts have held that when the legality of the defendant’s standardized conduct toward all members of \nthe proposed class is at issue, the commonality factor is ordinarily met.  See Appoloni v. United States, 218 \nF.R.D. 556, 561 (W.D. Mich. 2003); Bentley v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc., 223 F.R.D. 471, 481 (S.D. Ohio 2004) \n(“Where, as here, Plaintiffs allege a common course of conduct by Defendants that caused harm, class \ncertification is proper.”). \n9 \n \n\nsatisfaction of this requirement.  Id.  Indeed, “[c]ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate \nthat the class members ‘have suffered the same injury.’”  Id. at 349–50 (emphasis added) \n(quoting Falcon, 457 U.S. at 157). \nDefendants here argue that Plaintiffs cannot present a common question of law or fact \nbecause their medical conditions present individualized inquiries.  [R. 138 at 9–10; R. 141 at 5–\n6.]  However, this is not fatal to Plaintiffs’ request for class certification.  Collectively, Plaintiffs \nhave alleged that the Defendants’ policies, procedures, protocols, customs, and/or practices \nviolate the rights granted to inmates by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution.  [R. 126 at 16.]  Plaintiffs also claim violations under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act.  Id. at 17.  These unconstitutional claims present the \nsame questions of law: do the Defendants’ systemic treatment of inmates diagnosed with chronic \nHCV constitute deliberate indifference to a serious medical need?  The same questions exist for \nwhether the practices of the Defendants constituted negligence, gross negligence, and intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress.  \nOther courts have reached the same conclusion.  See, e.g. Postawko v. Mo. Dept. of \nCorrections, 910 F.3d 1030, 1038–39 (8th Cir. 2018) (affirming class certification of inmates \nchallenging Missouri Department of Corrections’ policies relating to screening and care of HCV: \n“Here the physical symptoms eventually suffered by each class member may vary, but the \nquestion asked by each class member is susceptible to common resolution.”); Buffkin v. Hooks, \nCase No. 1:18CV502, 2019 WL 12827835 (M.D. N.C. Mar. 20, 2019) (granting class \ncertification to “all current and future prisoners in DPS custody who have or will have chronic \nhepatitis C virus and have not been treated with direct-acting antiviral drugs”); Stafford v. \nCarter, No. 1:17-cv-00289-JMS-MJD, 2018 WL 1140388 at *5 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 2, 2018) (finding \n10 \n \n\ncommon questions of law in whether defendants’ practices involving treatment of HCV violated \nthe Eighth Amendment, Americans with Disabilities Act, or Rehabilitation Act, and ultimately \ngranting class certification); Hoffer v. Jones, 323 F.R.D. 694, 697–98 (N.D. Fl. Nov. 17, 2017) \n(granting class certification for “all current and future prisoners in the custody of the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections who have been diagnosed, or will be diagnosed with chronic hepatitis \nC virus” after finding common questions of law); Graham v. Parker, Case No. 3-16-cv-01954, \n2017 WL 1737871 at *4 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, 2017) (finding plaintiffs’ claims “that Defendants’ \ncurrent protocols and the failure to diagnose and treat Hepatitis C with the most recent and \ngenerally accepted community standards of treatment violated the U.S. Constitution” satisfied \nthe commonality requirement); B.E. v. Teeter, CASE NO. C16-0227-JCC, 2016 WL 3939674 at \n*3 (W.D. Wash. July 21, 2016) (finding plaintiffs had presented a common question of law, \nwhether the HCV treatment policy violated the Medicaid Act, and ultimately certifying the \nproposed class).  Plaintiffs have requested certification for the purposes of injunctive relief and \ndetermining whether the Defendants’ practices regarding HCV violate the law.  Deciding this \nquestion will be dispositive of all Plaintiffs’ claims, and therefore, the Court finds commonality \nhere. \nc \nUnder Rule 23(a)(3), “the claims or defenses of the representative parties” must be \n“typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  This requirement seeks to ensure that the \ninterests of the named representatives align with the interests of the members of the proposed \nclass.  In re Am. Med. Sys. Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. 1996).  A named plaintiff's claim is \ntypical if the claim arises from the same practice, event, or course of conduct giving rise to the \nother class members’ claims, and if all claims are based on the same legal theory.  Id.  Although \n11 \n \n\nthe class representatives’ claims must be typical, “Rule 23 does not require absolute \nhomogeneity.”  Tucker v. Union Underwear Co., Inc., 144 F.R.D. 325, 329 (W.D. Ky. 1992).  \nRather, “Rule 23(a)(3) typicality ‘determines whether a sufficient relationship exists between the \ninjury to the named plaintiff and the conduct affecting the class, so that the court may properly \nattribute a collective nature to the challenged conduct.’”  Stout v. J.D. Byrider, 228 F.3d 709, 717 \n(6th Cir. 2000) (quoting Sprague v. General Motors Corp., 133 F.3d 388, 399 (6th Cir. 1998)).  \nThe inquiry focuses special attention on “differences between class representative claims and \nclass claims that would defeat the representative nature of the class action.”  Van Vels v. Premier \nAthletic Center of Plainfield, Inc., 182 F.R.D. 500, 510 (W.D. Mich. 1998) (citations omitted). \nPlaintiffs assert they were not diagnosed with HCV as early as they should have been, \ntheir treatment for HCV did not begin as early as it should have begun, and when they did \nreceive treatment, it did not meet the established standard of care.  [R. 134 at 6.]  Defendants \nargue the Plaintiffs’ individualized timelines, treatments, and symptoms are fatal to the typicality \nrequirement here.  [R. 138 at 10–11; R. 141 at 6–7.]  Additionally, because two of the named \nplaintiffs, Bramblett and Woodcock, have received testing and treatment, Defendants argue they \nhave no claims left to pursue.  Id. \nThese differences, however, do not destroy typicality.  The requirements of commonality \nand typicality overlap significantly.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 n.5 \n(2011).  Plaintiffs’ claims regarding HCV treatment and diagnoses arise from the same practice, \nevent, or course of conduct giving rise to the other class members’ claims, and all claims are \nbased on the same legal theory.  In re Am. Med. Sys. Inc., 75 F.3d at 1082.  Again, other courts \nhave agreed, finding typicality among inmates suffering from HCV, regardless of their \nindividualized treatments.  See, e.g. Postawko v. Mo. Dept. of Corrections, 910 F.3d 1030, 1039 \n12 \n \n\n(8th Cir. 2018) (finding “factual variations” among inmates with HCV did not undermine \ntypicality); Stafford v. Carter, No. 1:17-cv-00289-JMS-MJD, 2018 WL 1140388 at *7 (S.D. Ind. \nMar. 2, 2018) (finding the specifics of inmates’ diagnoses for HCV and medical histories did not \ndestroy typicality); Hoffer v. Jones, 323 F.R.D. 694, 698–99 (N.D. Fl. Nov. 17, 2017) (finding \ntypicality even among inmates with HCV diagnoses who exhibited no symptoms); Graham v. \nParker, Case No. 3-16-cv-01954, 2017 WL 1737871 at *4–5 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, 2017) (finding \ntypicality among inmates with varying severity of HCV because all plaintiffs sought the same \ninjunctive relief); B.E. v. Teeter, CASE NO. C16-0227-JCC, 2016 WL 3939674 at *3–4 (W.D. \nWash. July 21, 2016) (finding plaintiffs’ claims were typical, even if they previously suffered \nvarying injuries or currently experienced different health care needs).   \nd \nFinally, Rule 23(a)(4) allows a class to be certified only if “the representative parties will \nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.”  This is an essential prerequisite for due \nprocess, as a final judgment in a class action binds all class members.  In re Am. Med. Sys. Inc., \n75 F.3d 1069, 1083 (6th Cir. 1996) (citing Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940)).  This circuit \napplies a two-part test for determining the adequacy of representation.  First, the named \nrepresentatives “must have common interests with the unnamed members of the class,” and \nsecond, it must be apparent that the named representatives “will vigorously prosecute the \ninterests of the class through qualified counsel.”  Senter v. General Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, \n525 (6th Cir. 1976).  This “adequate representation requirement overlaps with the typicality \nrequirement because in the absence of typical claims, the class representative has no incentives \nto pursue the claims of the other class members.”  In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d at 1083.   \n13 \n \n\nThe named Plaintiffs in this matter seek injunctive relief declaring the current practices of \nDefendants to be a violation of law.  In response, Defendants argue that Mr. Woodcock and Mr. \nBramblett have already received treatment, and therefore, cannot adequately represent the class.  \n[R. 138 at 17–18.]  However, Mr. Woodcock and Mr. Bramblett are not the only named \nrepresentatives, and none of the Defendants specifically contest the adequacy of Plaintiffs Ruben \nRios Salinas and Jessica Lawrence, neither of which have received treatment.  If, in fact, Mr. \nWoodcock and Mr. Bramblett no longer are infected with HCV, neither of them would be \nincluded as class members for the proposed class of “all HCV-infected inmates in Kentucky \nprisons for the purpose of injunctive relief.”  Instead, Mr. Salinas and Ms. Lawrence would \nremain in the class as representatives.  \nDefendants have not argued that Mr. Woodcock’s and Mr. Bramblett’s interests are \nadverse or in conflict with the interests of the potential class members.  Both Mr. Woodcock and \nMr. Bramblett have also asserted claims of damages on behalf of themselves, meaning injunctive \nrelief on behalf of the class would also be favorable to their claims.  Adequacy is met if the \nrepresentative parties would “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,” and \nDefendants have presented no indication that the named Plaintiffs here would not do so.  Fed. R. \nCiv. Pro. 23(a)(4).  However, because the Plaintiffs seem to concede potential shortfalls with Mr. \nWoodcock and Mr. Bramblett as named Plaintiffs [R. 142 at 6], and because none of the \nDefendants contest the adequacy of Mr. Salinas or Ms. Lawrence [R. 138; R. 141], the Court \nfinds it appropriate to name only Mr. Salinas and Ms. Lawrence as representatives of the class.  \nFurthermore, Plaintiffs are represented by counsel who has litigated numerous class actions and \nmatters involving inmate health care.  [R. 134 at 6.]  Defendants do not contest the adequacy of \nPlaintiffs’ counsel, and the Court finds Plaintiffs have met the requirements under Rule 23(a)(4). \n14 \n \n\n2 \nPlaintiffs seeks certification only pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  [R. 134 at 6.]  Rule 23(b)(2) \napplies exclusively in cases when class members seek the same declaratory or injunctive relief \nand do not assert individualized claims for damages.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 360–61 (2011).  Generally, claims for monetary relief are inappropriate under Rule \n23(b)(2).  Id.; see also id. at 363 (“Rule 23(b)(2) ‘does not extend to cases in which the \nappropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages’” (quoting Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23, Advisory Committee’s Note to 1966 Amendment, 39 F.R.D. 69, 102 (1966))).  \nRather, “‘[c]ivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination \nare prime examples’ of what (b)(2) is meant to capture.”  Id. at 361 (quoting Amchem Prods., \nInc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997)).  Rule 23(b)(2) “reflects a series of decisions \ninvolving challenges to racial segregation—conduct that was remedied by a single classwide \norder.”  Id.  “In none of the cases cited by the Advisory Committee as examples of (b)(2)’s \nantecedents did the plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide \ninjunction.”  Id. (emphasis added) (citing Advisory Committee’s Note, 39 F.R.D. at 102).  This is \nbecause permission to combine individualized and classwide relief within a single Rule 23(b)(2) \nclass is inconsistent with the structure of Rule 23(b).”  Id.  \nThe named Plaintiffs in this case have asserted claims for damages.  [R. 126.]  However, \nthe request for class certification pertains only to the claims of injunctive relief.  Defendants \nargue the requests for damages invalidates Plaintiffs’ standing under Rule 23(b)(2) but cite to no \nlaws requiring that result.  [R. 141 at 9–10.]  The key to class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is \n“the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that the \nconduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \n15 \n \n\nto none of them.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360 (citing Richard Nagareda, Class Certification in \nthe Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. REV. 97, 132 (April 2009)).  Plaintiffs’ request here, \nthe injunctive relief regarding screening and treatment, is indivisible as to the class members.  \nPlaintiffs have challenged a lack of conduct applicable to all inmates with HCV.  Specifically, in \nthe Sixth Circuit, “certifying declaratory relief under Rule 23(b)(2) is permissible even when the \ndeclaratory relief serves as a predicate for later monetary relief, which would be certified under \nRule 23(b)(3).”  Gooch v. Life Inv’rs Co. of Am., 672 F.3d 402, 427–49 (6th Cir. 2012).  Final \ninjunctive relief would be appropriate to the entire class, and the Court will certify the class only \nfor the purposes of injunctive and declaratory relief.  Because the established procedures for \ntreating and diagnosing HCV remain the same for all inmates, certification under Rule 23(b)(2) \nis appropriate for such relief.  Id., see also, Clemons v. Norton Healthcare Inc. Ret. Plan, 890 \nF.3d 254, 279–80 (6th Cir. 2018). \n3 \nThe proposed class action meets all requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n23(a).  Additionally, Plaintiffs’ requests for injunctive relief satisfy the requirements for \ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2).  Defendants further argue that the class certification is not a \nsuperior method to resolve this matter, but the Court disagrees.  As is the case with many other \ncertified classes, there are individualized concerns, in this case, those regarding specific inmates’ \ntreatment plans and varying stages of the disease.  However, in resolving a request for injunctive \nor declaratory relief, the Court would not be “‘second guessing’ the decisions of healthcare \nproviders” as Defendants allege.  [R. 138 at 19.]  Instead, Plaintiffs request the Court review the \nestablished procedures to ensure Defendants’ are providing a standard of care that does not \nviolate constitutional standards.  Furthermore, the Court’s decision is buttressed by various other \n16 \n \n\nUnited States District Courts, each of which have granted certification to similarly situated \ninmates diagnosed with HCV and requesting injunctive or declaratory relief.  See, e.g. Postawko \nv. Mo. Dept. of Corrections, 910 F.3d 1030 (8th Cir. 2018); Stafford v. Carter, No. 1:17-cv-\n00289-JMS-MJD, 2018 WL 1140388 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 2, 2018); Hoffer v. Jones, 323 F.R.D. 694, \n698 (N.D. Fl. Nov. 17, 2017); Graham v. Parker, Case No. 3-16-cv-01954, 2017 WL 1737871 at \n*4–5 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, 2017); B.E. v. Teeter, CASE NO. C16-0227-JCC, 2016 WL 3939674 \nat *3–4 (W.D. Wash. July 21, 2016).   \nB \nTo obtain a permanent injunction, a plaintiff “must first establish that [he has] suffered a \nconstitutional violation.”  Women’s Med. Prof’l Corp. v. Baird, 438 F.3d 595, 602 (6th Cir. \n2006).  And even if the Court finds that a violation occurred, the plaintiff must also \n“demonstrate: (1) that [he] has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, \nsuch as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the \nbalance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and \n(4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.”  eBay Inc. v. \nMercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).3  The moving party bears the burden of \ndemonstrating these elements.  See O’Toole v. O’Connor, 802 F.3d 783, 788 (6th Cir. 2015); see \nalso Waskul v. Wawshtenaw Cty. Cmty. Mental Health, 900 F.3d 250, 255–56 (6th Cir. 2018).  \n                                                 \n3 Although the Defendants do not argue that Kentucky’s sovereign immunity bars this suit, the Court will \nbriefly note that this case falls comfortably within the boundaries of the Ex Parte Young exception.  This \ndoctrine empowers federal courts to “enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements \nof federal law,” notwithstanding the state’s typical immunity from suit.  Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 337 \n(1979) (citing Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)).  The exception “rests on the premise–less delicately \ncalled a ‘fiction’–that when a federal court commands a state official to do nothing more than refrain from \nviolating federal law, he is not the State for sovereign immunity purposes.”  Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. \nStewart, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 1638 (2011).  \n17 \n \n\n           The primary claim brought by the Plaintiffs concerns an alleged violation of their \nconstitutional rights.  Such allegations are properly brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Section \n1983 does not create substantive rights but, rather, “provides a remedy for deprivations of rights \nsecured by the Constitution and laws of the United States . . ..” Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 \nU.S. 922, 924 (1982); Mertik v. Blalock, 983 F.2d 1353, 1359 (6th Cir. 1993).  “To state a claim \nunder § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws \nof the United States and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person \nacting under color of state law.” West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988).  “The first step in any \nsuch claim is to identify the specific constitutional right allegedly infringed.” Albright v. Oliver, \n510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994) (citing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989) (additional \ncitations omitted)). \n            Plaintiffs and Defendants agree, Defendants offer DAA treatment to some prisoners \ninfected with HCV, but not all infected prisoners, and Defendants test a sample population of \nprisoners for HCV, but testing is not standard for all prisoners.  [R. 139 at 8–9.]  Parties disagree \non whether the Defendants’ practices are constitutionally adequate as a matter of law.  [R. 135; \nR. 139; R. 140.]  The Constitution guarantees “a right to adequate medical treatment” for both \nconvicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.  Estelle v. Gamble, 424 U.S. 97 (1976).  Inadequate \ncare can only constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment if the government actor knew that \nthe care provided or withheld would pose a serious risk to the inmate, but consciously \ndisregarded that risk all the same.  Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 736 (6th Cir. 2018).  Mere \nfailure to provide adequate care does not per se rise to the level of constitutional violation.  Id. at \n737.  To succeed on an action for deliberate indifference to medical needs, plaintiffs have been \nrequired to show: (i) an objectively substantial risk of serious harm, and (ii) that the jail or \n18 \n \n\ncounty officials were “subjectively aware of the risk.”  Harbin v. City of Detroit, 147 F. App'x \n566, 570 (6th Cir. 2005).   \nThe first component of this inquiry is an objective one; a plaintiff must demonstrate the \nalleged deprivation was serious enough to violate the Eighth Amendment.  Rhinehart, 894 F.3d \nat 737.  If a prison fails to provide treatment for an inmate’s “serious medical condition,” such \nsatisfies this objective inquiry.  Id. (citing Blackmore v. Kalamazoo Cty., 390 F.3d 890, 896–99 \n(6th Cir. 2004).  A plaintiff can also succeed at demonstrating this objective component by \nindicating the care was grossly inadequate, defined as “so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or \nexcessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.”  Miller v. \nCalhoun Cty., 408 F.3d 803, 819 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Terrance v. Northville Reg’l Psych. \nHosp., 286 F.3d 834, 843 (6th Cir. 2001).  In order to show the care received was “grossly \ninadequate,” plaintiffs must introduce medical proof that the treatment afforded was inadequate \nto treat their condition or their pain.  Santiago v. Ringle, 734 F.3d 585, 591 (6th Cir. 2013).  This \noften requires expert testimony. \nDefendants do not deny that the Plaintiffs have HCV, but rather, that the Plaintiffs are, \nand will continue to be, afforded constitutionally adequate medical treatment.  Plaintiffs \ndisagree; however, their motion for injunctive relief is woefully insufficient as to allegations of \nthe alleged deprivation.  In less than six pages, Plaintiffs conclude that HCV is a serious medical \ncondition and that Defendants are systematically failing to provide treatment that meets the \naccepted standard of care.  [R. 135.]  Throughout, Plaintiffs point to expert testimony and expert \nreports provided by Stacey Beth Trooskin, M.D., Ph.D., MPH, who states that she believes the \nprocedures established by Defendants do not meet the standard of care.  [R. 135-1.]  Plaintiffs \n19 \n \n\nalso contrast Dr. Trooskin’s report with the report of Defendants’ expert Louis Shicker, M.D., \nwho claims the procedures, in fact, do meet the standard of care.  [R. 135-2.] \nHowever, Plaintiffs fail to identify specific procedures they believe to be constitutionally \ninadequate care, relying merely on the attachment of the two conflicting expert reports and \nconclusory statements alleging “unreasonable and substantial risk of serious present and future \nmedical and physical harm” to inmates infected with HCV.  [R. 135 at 5.]  The Court has no \ndoubt that failure to properly diagnose and/or treat HCV causes discomfort or pain to those \nliving with its symptoms.  But Plaintiffs here have not met their burden to establish that the \nprocedures amount to grossly inadequate treatment, as a mere failure to provide adequate care \ndoes not require a finding of constitutional inadequacy.  Rhinehart, 894 F.3d 737. \n  Even if a moving plaintiff can demonstrate objectively that the care provided or withheld \nwas substantially serious, the plaintiff must also show a “sufficiently culpable state of mind” on \nbehalf of the government actors.  Santiago, 734 F.3d at 591.  This state of mind is more than \nmere negligence, amounting instead to criminal recklessness.  Id.  Prison doctors have more than \na simple duty to provide “some treatment” to inmates with serious medical needs; instead they \nmust “provide medical treatment to the patient without consciously exposing the patient to an \nexcessive risk of serious harm.”  Id. (quoting LeMarbe v. Wisneski, 266 F.3d 429, 439 (6th Cir. \n2001).  Errors in medical judgment to do not constitute deliberate indifference, instead, officials \nmust have subjectively perceived facts from which they may have inferred substantial risk to the \ninmates, subjectively inferred that risk, but then disregarded the perceived risk, particularly by \nfailing to attempt to abate the risk.  Rhinehart, 894 F.3d at 738 (citations omitted).  Because \ndefendants rarely admit their subjective perceptions on this matter, plaintiffs are permitted to \nprove subjective recklessness relying only on circumstantial evidence.  Id. \n20 \n \n\nPlaintiffs’ motion lacks any mention at all of the subjective component.  [R. 135.]  Even \nif the Court assumes that Defendants failed to provide a constitutionally adequate level of care \nfor Plaintiffs’ HCV, Plaintiffs have failed to even allege a “sufficiently culpable state of mind.”  \nIn their discussion, Plaintiffs mention Defendants had failed to provide care because it was too \nexpensive, but do not argue this is criminal recklessness.  Id. at 5–6.  True, Dr. Shicker believes \nthat mandating DAA treatment for all inmates testing positive for HCV would be an \n“unnecessary onus” financially for the Defendants and for Kentucky taxpayers.  [R. 135-2 at 5–\n6.]  But Plaintiffs then require the Court to infer, based on this information alone, that a limited \nscope of treatment necessarily infers a substantial risk and that Defendants deliberately ignored \nthis risk.  Without substantially more evidence on the matter, the Court cannot assume a mens \nrea simply because Plaintiffs imply one.  See Santiago, 734 F.3d at 592–93.  \nThe lack of information provided by the Plaintiffs necessarily leads the Court to conclude \nthe Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof to establish a constitutional violation.  See \nHarbin v. City of Detroit, 147 F. App'x 566, 570 (6th Cir. 2005).  Therefore, the Court need not \ndiscuss the other requirements for granting a permanent injunction.  However, because the \nCourt’s decision is based entirely on the Plaintiffs’ failure to meet the burden required to \nestablish a constitutional violation, the Court also exercises its duty to avoid unnecessary \ndecisions of constitutional questions.  See Tower Realty v. City of East Detroit, 196 F.2d 710, \n724 (6th Cir. 1952).  Specifically, the Court declines to reach a conclusion on whether the \npractices of the Defendants in diagnosing and treating inmates with HCV violates the United \nStates Constitution. \n \n \n21 \n \n\nIII \nClass certification is appropriate here; all requirements under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23 have been established.  Furthermore, other District Courts have agreed that class \ncertification is appropriate for inmates seeking improved HCV care.  However, the Court cannot \nresolve a constitutional question on bare assertions and speculations simply because the Plaintiffs \nbelieve Defendants should be distributing DAAs to all infected inmates.  Accordingly, and the \nCourt being sufficiently advised, it is hereby ORDERED as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Motion to Certify Class [R. 134] is GRANTED; \n2.  The Court CERTIFIES a class defined as “all inmates in Kentucky prisons who \nhave been diagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) for the purpose \nof injunctive relief”; \n3.  Plaintiff Ruben Rios Salinas and Plaintiff Jessica Lawrence SHALL SERVE as \nclass representatives; \n4.  Gregory Allen Belzley, Camille Bathurst, and Aaron Joseph Bentley, attorneys \nfrom the law firm Belzley, Bathurst & Bentley, are APPOINTED as class council; \n5.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Permanent Injunction [R. 135] is DENIED;  \n6.  Hearing on this matter, scheduled for July 25, 2019, is CANCELLED; and \n7.  The parties’ Joint Motion to Continue Evidentiary Hearing [R. 159] is DENIED \nAS MOOT. \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \n\nThis the 12th day of July, 2019. \n \n \n23 \n ",

Plaintiffs challenge whether the failure of current \nKentucky Department of Corrections (KDOC) policies and protocols to timely provide Direct \nActing Antiviral drugs (DAA) to treat all HCV inmates constitutes deliberate indifference to \ntheir serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, or otherwise \nconstitutes negligence or gross negligence.  In response, Defendants contend KDOC’s HCV \ntreatment policies and protocols are objectively reasonable and are the result of subjective \nmedical judgment.  The Defendants have moved for summary judgment on the Plaintiffs’ claims, \nand for the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS the Defendants’ motion as to the claims \nunder the Rehabilitation Act and American with Disabilities Act and the § 1983 Eighth \nAmendment claim and REMANDS the Plaintiffs’ remaining state law Negligence and \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress claims for further consideration by the state court. \n \n\nI \nA \nThis case began in 2015 in Franklin Circuit Court in Franklin County, Kentucky.  [R. 38 \nat 1.]  Mr. Salinas filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus against then-Commissioner LaDonna \nThompson, asking the Court to order treatment for his HCV infection.  [Id. at 1–2].  On \nNovember 14, 2016, Mr. Salinas filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, naming additional \nplaintiffs and defendants.  [Id. at 2].  The case was removed to this Court on December 7, 2016.  \n[R. 1.]  On August 18, 2017, Ms. Lawrence moved to intervene, adding Mr. Erwin as an \nadditional defendant.  [R. 33.]  Magistrate Judge Edward B. Atkins permitted intervention.  [R. \n35.]  On March 1, 2018, Plaintiffs filed motions to certify their class under Rule 23(b)(2).  On \nJuly 12, 2019, this Court issued a Memorandum Opinion & Order that certified the Plaintiffs’ \nclass of “all inmates in Kentucky prisons who have been diagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with \nchronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) for the purpose of injunctive relief.”  [R. 162 at 22.]  Also, this \nCourt appointed Plaintiffs Salinas and Lawrence as class representatives, appointed Plaintiff \nClass’s counsel, and denied Plaintiffs’ motion for a permanent injunction. [Id.]  \nB \nThe Plaintiffs in this matter are inmates, incarcerated with the Kentucky Department of \nCorrections.  [R. 1-2 at ¶ 3.]  Each of them have been diagnosed with the Hepatitis C virus.  [Id.]  \nDefendants are various official and nonofficial entities, all sued in their individual capacities, \ncharged with managing the HCV treatment plan for and providing care to inmates.  [R. 1-2 at ¶¶ \n5–15.]  Defendant James Erwin was the former Commissioner of the KDOC, responsible for its \noperations, policies, and employment.  [R. 36 at ¶ 4; R. 178.]  The original Plaintiffs did not sue \nMr. Erwin, but he was added to this lawsuit by Intervening Plaintiff Jessica Lawrence.  However, \n2 \n \n\nPlaintiffs have recently dismissed Defendant James Erwin from the suit in his individual \ncapacity.  [R. 186.]  Defendants Rodney Ballard and LaDonna Thompson are former \nCommissioners of the KDOC.  [Id. at ¶ 5–6.]  Defendant Doug Crall, M.D., is the Medical \nDirector of the KDOC, responsible for policies, procedures, and employment concerning the \ninmates’ medical care.  [R. 1-2 at ¶ 12.]  Defendant Cookie Crews is the Health Services \nAdministrator of the KDOC.  [Id. at ¶ 13.]  Defendant Frederick Kemen, M.D., is responsible for \nmanaging the HCV treatment plan for KDOC inmates.  [Id. at ¶ 14.]  Defendant Denise Burkett \nis the medical director of the KDOC.  [R. 126 at ¶ 13.]  Defendant Correct Care Solutions, Inc., \nprovides medical services to inmates of the KDOC.  [Id. at ¶ 15.]   \n  Plaintiffs believe they have not been provided constitutionally adequate treatment for \ntheir HCV infections.  [R. 134; R. 135.]  According to their complaint, Defendants did not \nemploy qualified individuals, did not adequately train these employees, and did not create or \nenforce necessary policies and procedures to ensure proper care.  [R. 1-2 at ¶ 16.]  Plaintiff Brian \nWoodcock is housed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary (KSP).  [Id. at ¶ 52.]  In December 2011, \na biopsy indicated the fibrosis in his liver had advanced from Stage 1 to Stage 2.  [Id.]  Under Dr. \nSteven Shedlofshky’s standards, he was first told he qualified for antiviral prescription \nmedication.  [Id.]  But Dr. Shedlofsky then left KDOC, and KDOC found Mr. Woodcock did not \nqualify for medication.  [Id.]  Four years later, after his infection further progressed, he began \nreceiving treatment.  [Id. at ¶53.]  Plaintiff Ruben Rios Salinas is also housed in KSP and has \nbeen denied testing and treatment of his HCV infection.  [Id. at ¶¶ 54–55.]  Plaintiff Keath \nBramblett, another inmate at KSP, contracted HCV during incarceration.  [Id. at ¶ 56.]  He has \nbeen denied both participation in any program working with food and treatment for his \ncondition.  [Id. at ¶¶ 56–57.]  Mr. Bramblett has been ordered to share razors with other inmates.  \n3 \n \n\n[Id. at ¶ 57.]  Plaintiff Jessica Lawrence has been diagnosed with HCV but has not received any \ntreatment.  [R. 36 at 5.] \n Defendants do not contest the facts surrounding the care Plaintiffs have received, but \ndisagree that such care is inadequate.  [R. 140 at 3–4.]   Plaintiffs sue Defendants on four \nseparate theories.  First, Plaintiffs sue Defendants under § 1983 for violations of the Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  [R. 1-2 at ¶ 61.]  Also, Plaintiffs \nclaim Defendants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of \n1978 for failure to reasonably accommodate their infections.  [Id. at ¶ 64.]  Based on the failure \nto meet the standard of care, Plaintiffs also believe Defendants acted with negligence and gross \nnegligence.  [Id. at ¶ 66.]  Finally, Plaintiffs sue for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.  \n[Id. at ¶ 68.]  They seek both injunctive relief for care and damages for lack of treatment.  [R. 1-2 \nat 19; R. 36 at 9.] \nB \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, summary judgment is appropriate where “the \npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with \naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  A fact’s materiality is \ndetermined by the substantive law, and a dispute is genuine if “the evidence is such that a \nreasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \n477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).   \nIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view the evidence and draw \nall reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith \nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  The burden is initially on the moving party to inform \n4 \n \n\n“the district court of the basis of its motion, and [to identify] those portions of ‘the pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any,’ \nwhich it believes demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of a material fact.”  Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Once this burden is met, the nonmoving party, “must set \nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).  Further, \n“the trial court no longer has a duty to search the entire record to establish that it is bereft of a \ngenuine issue of material fact.”  Street v. J.C. Bradford & Co., 886 F.2d 1472, 1479-80 (6th Cir. \n1989).  Instead, “the non-moving party has an affirmative duty to direct the Court’s attention to \nthose specific portions of the record upon which it seeks to rely to create a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact.”  In re Morris, 260 F.3d 654, 665 (6th Cir. 2001).   \nII \nA \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs Woodcock and Bramblett failed to exhaust available \nadministrative remedies prior to filing this action.  [R. 168 at 23.]  The Prison Litigation Reform \nAct requires prisoners to exhaust all available administrative remedies before filing suit under § \n1983.  Lee v. Wiley, 789 F.3d 673, 677 (6th Cir. 2015).  The Sixth Circuit holds that since the \nlanguage of § 1997e(a) makes exhaustion a condition precedent for the filing of a § 1983 claim, \n\"The prisoner . . . may not exhaust administrative remedies during the pendency of the federal \nsuit.\"  Freeman v. Francis, 196 F.3d 641, 645 (6th Cir. 1999).  This remains true even if \nexhaustion of the remedies is perceived as \"futile,\" Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 n.6, 121 \nS. Ct. 1819, 149 L. Ed. 2d 958 (2001), or if the various stages of the appeals process within the \nprison system are optional, Owens v. Keeling, 461 F.3d 763, 770  n.4. (6th Cir. 2006).  \n5 \n \n\nDefendants have discovered that Mr. Woodcock filed a Healthcare Grievance prior to \nfiling this lawsuit in regard to his inadequate medical treatment for HCV, requesting a re-biopsy \nof his liver.  [R. 168 at 24.]  As Defendants point out, Mr. Woodcock’s only Grievance submitted \n“did not raise any grievances against CCS, Dr. Kemen, KDOC Defendants, or the HCV \ntreatment protocol in place at that time.”  [Id.]  Mr. Bramblett filed two Grievances relating to his \ntreatment for HCV, but he did not appeal either of these Grievances according to his deposition \ntaken.  [Id.]  Plaintiffs Woodcock and Bramblett’s cases are therefore reasonably simple to \ndecide: because they did not fulfill their obligation to seek complete redress through the \nadministrative process in prison as an initial matter, both of their § 1983 claims were prematurely \nfiled, and must be dismissed. \n  In addition, it has also been discovered that Plaintiffs Woodcock and Bramblett have \nbeen cleared of HCV.  [R. 168 at 26; R. 182 at 35.]  Therefore, Mr. Woodcock and Mr. \nBramblett can no longer be part of the class that represents all inmates in Kentucky prisons who \nhave been diagnosed, or will be diagnosed, with chronic HCV.  The requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies is mandatory, and “applies to all federal claims seeking redress for \nprison circumstances or occurrences regardless of the type of relief being sought.”  Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677.  Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that contradicts Defendants’ arguments and \nonly request that the Court stay Woodcock’s and Bramblett’s claims pending exhaustion.  \nHowever, due to the fact that neither Defendant is able to be apart of class and failed to exhaust \nall administrative remedies according to KRS 454.415, all claims by Woodcock and Bramblett \nagainst the Defendants must be dismissed.   \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nB \nThe primary claim brought by Plaintiffs concerns an alleged violation of their \nconstitutional rights.  Such allegations, as well as allegations concerning a prisoner’s medical \nneeds, are properly brought under 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Section 1983 does not create substantive \nrights but, rather, \"provides a remedy for deprivations of rights secured by the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States. . . .\"  Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 924, 102 S. Ct. 2744, \n73 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1982); Mertik v. Blalock, 983 F.2d 1353, 1359 (6th Cir. 1993).  \"To state a \nclaim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution \nand laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a \nperson acting under color of state law.\"  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48, 108 S. Ct. 2250, 101 L. \nEd. 2d 40 (1988). \"The first step in any such claim is to identify the specific constitutional right \nallegedly infringed.\"  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 \n(1994) (citing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 \n(1989) (additional citations omitted)).   \n“The government has an obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is \npunishing by incarceration.  But mere failure to provide adequate medical care to a prisoner will \nnot violate the Eighth Amendment.”  Rhinehart v. Scutt, 894 F.3d 721, 736 (6th Cir. 2018).  In \nthose circumstances, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the prison doctors and/or prison officials \nwere deliberately indifferent to the prisoner’s medical needs.  Richmond v. Huq, 885 F.3d 928, \n937 (6th Cir. 2018).  “Deliberate indifference” requires both that the injury be objectively serious \nand that the defendant subjectively knew of the risk but disregarded it.  Id. at 938–39.  “A prison \nofficial exhibits deliberate indifference and thus violates the Eighth Amendment by, inter alia, \nintentionally denying or delaying access to medical care for serious medical needs.”  Johnson v. \n7 \n \n\nMillion, 60 F. App’x 548, 549 (6th Cir. 2003) (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104–05 \n(1976)).  This is the standard because \"only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain \nimplicates the Eighth Amendment.\"  Rhinehart, 894 F.3d at 737 (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 \nU.S. 294, 297, 111 S. Ct. 2321, 115 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1991)) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \n1 \nThe objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim based on a lack of medical care \nrequires that a prisoner have a serious medical need.  Blackmore v. Kalamazoo Cnty., 390 F.3d \n890, 895 (6th Cir. 2004); Brooks v. Celeste, 39 F.3d 125, 128 (6th Cir. 1994).  \"[A] medical need \nis objectively serious if it is 'one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment \nor one that is so obvious that even a lay person would readily recognize the necessity for a \ndoctor's attention.'\"  Blackmore, 390 F.3d at 897; see also Johnson v. Karnes, 398 F.3d 868, 874 \n(6th Cir. 2005).   \nWhen the claim consist of whether a particular treatment should be provided, the inmate \nmust show that \"the inmate's symptoms 'would [ ] be[ ] alleviated by' the treatment and the \ninmate's condition require[s] that treatment.\"  Rhinehart, 894 F.3d 721, at 749 (citing Anthony v. \nSwanson, 701 F. App'x 460, 464 (6th Cir. 2017)).  If the inmate is able to establish this, he or she \nmust then move on to show that the treatment actually being provided is \"so grossly  \nincompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to \nfundamental fairness.\"  Id.  (citing Miller v. Calhoun Cty., 408 F.3d 803, 819 (6th Cir. \n2005)).  “To meet this burden, Plaintiffs must present two types of medical proof: (1) that the \nprovided treatment was not adequate medical treatment for the inmate's condition, and (2) the \ntreatment provided had a detrimental effect.”  Atkins v. Parker, 2019 LEXIS 168976, 2019 WL \n8 \n \n\n4748299 at *38 (M.D. Tn Sept. 30, 2019) (citing Santiago v. Ringle, 734 F.3d 585, 591 (6th Cir. \n2013); Blackmore , 390 F.3d 890, at 898; Napier v. Madison Cty., Ky., 238 F.3d 739, 742 (6th \nCir. 2001); Anthony, 701 F. App'x 460, at 464).   \nThe Sixth Circuit noted in making its determination in Rhinehart that “the Eighth \nAmendment does not require that prisoners receive ‘unqualified access to health care’ of their \nchoice.”  Id.  (citing Rhinehart, 894 F.3d at 750 (quoting Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9, \n112 S. Ct. 995, 117 L. Ed. 2d 156 (1992)).  Also, the Court points out that “an inmate is entitled \nto adequate medical care, but ‘not the best care possible.’”  Id.  (quoting Rhinehart, 894 F.3d at \n750 (citing Miller, 408 F.3d at 819)).  “Neither an inmate's ‘disagreement with the testing and \ntreatment he has received,’ nor ‘a desire for additional or different treatment,’ rises to the level of \nan Eighth Amendment violation unless the treatment actually being provided is objectively \nharmful enough to establish a constitutional violation.”  Id. at 38–39 (citing Rhinehart, 894 F.3d \nat 740 (quoting Dodson v. Wilkinson, 304 F. App'x 434, 440 (6th Cir. 2008)).  Additionally, the \nCourt has held that \"as a general rule, a patient's disagreement with his physicians over the \nproper course of treatment alleges, at most, a medical-malpractice claim, which is not cognizable \nunder § 1983.\"  Darrah v. Krishar, 865 F.3d 361, 372 (6th Cir. 2017).  \nThe court in Rhinehart applied these specific components to analyze the objective \nelement to the Eighth Amendment claim.  Even though the plaintiffs’ expert \"testified that a \nTIPS procedure is the 'gold standard' of treatment for patients with ESLD,\" the alternative \ntreatment the inmate actually received, “which included ‘regular monitoring and pain \nmedication,’ did not rise to the level of constitutional inadequacy.”  Atkins, 2019 LEXIS 168976 \nat *39 (quoting Rhinehart, 894 F.3d at 750 (citing Johnson v. Million, 60 F. App'x 548, 549 (6th \nCir. 2003)).  Specifically, the Court of Appeals in Johnson held “that an inmate with liver \n9 \n \n\ndisease could not establish deliberate-indifference claim against his prison healthcare providers \nwhen the inmate was repeatedly examined for his pain and prescribed medications, ordered \nblood tests, and advised about his diet.”  Id. \na \n  As Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Trooskin has explained, HCV can lead to end-stage liver disease \nor even death for many patients if left untreated.  [R. 182 at 2.]  Other symptoms of the disease \noften include increased risk of diabetes, muscle and joint pain, headaches, fatigue, porphyria, \ncutanea tarda, and neurocognitive dysfunction.  [Id. at 4.]  This testimony given by Plaintiffs’ \nexpert clearly proves that chronic HCV is a serious medical condition, as many other courts \nagree including the Sixth Circuit.  See, e.g., Hix v. Tennessee Dep’t of Corr., 196 F. App’x 350, \n356 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[H]epatitis C likely constitutes a serious medical need sufficient to satisfy \nthe objective component of our Eighth Amendment analysis[.]”); Owens v. Hutchinson, 70 F. \nApp’x 159, 161 (6th Cir. 2003) (“Owens has adequately alleged that he suffered from an \nobjectively serious medical condition – [HCV].”).  Plaintiffs have also shown through factual \ndata and expert testimony, that DAAs alleviate and cure HCV for the vast majority of HCV \npatients.  [R. 182 at 7.] \n  Following the analysis previously outlined, the Court must next determine whether \nKDOC’s HCV treatment policy is “so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock \nthe conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness.”  Atkins, 2019 LEXIS 168976, at \n*46–47.  Plaintiffs argue that the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and \nInfectious Disease Society of America (AASLD/IDSA) Guidelines set the standard of care for \nHCV treatment, including treatment for inmates.  [R. 182 at 11.]  Plaintiffs explain that KDOC’s \nHCV treatment policies fall short of this standard of care by refusing to treat every inmate with \n10 \n \n\nchronic HCV.  [Id.]  Plaintiffs also rely upon the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) plan on \ntreating HCV patients, and explain five ways on how the KDOC plan differs including opt-out \ntesting.  [Id. at 10.] \n  Dr. Trooskin opines that she does not find the FBOP Guidelines to be an acceptable \nstandard of care because the prioritization and delay in treatment cause damage and risks for a \nperson throughout their entire life even if they are later cured.  [R. 182, Exh. A, at 25.]  However, \nlike KDOC and FBOP policies, Dr. Trooskin explains that the AASLD/IDSA Guidelines update \nand change frequently as policies become outdated.  [Id. at 38.]  Likewise, it has been shown that \nKDOC updates its policies frequently, as there were revisions made to the HCV plan in 2017 and \n2018 as new developments and guidance were discovered.  [R. 168 at 10.]  The KDOC plan \ncurrently mirrors the FBOP priority scale based upon patients’ aspartate aminotransferase to \nplatelet ratio index (APRI) scores to prioritize treatment among infected individuals.  [Id.] \nAs Atkins v. Parker points out, “The AASLD/IDSA Guideline consists of treatment \nrecommendations, not mandatory practice requirements.”  2019 LEXIS 168976, at *48.  The \nCourt explains that the AASLD/IDSA Guideline can be relied upon, but that its \nrecommendations are a source to gain “helpful understanding” of the “best possible practice, and \nprovide ‘evidence of a preferred public health policy,’ but do ‘not necessarily determine the \nstandard for judging [constitutional] deliberate indifference.’”  Id.  (quoting Buffkin v. Hooks, \n2019 LEXIS 45790, 2019 WL 1282785, at *6 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 20, 2019) (“noting that the \nAASLD/IDSA disclaims that its guidelines should not be relied on to suggest a course of \ntreatment for a particular individual and cautioning against use of the AASLD/IDSA Guideline \nas a legal measure of Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference”).  \n Further, even the AASLD/IDSA Guidelines recognize the barriers that still impact \n11 \n \n\nability to treat all patients infected with HCV, causing there to be a priority system.  [R. 168 at \n9.]  For example, the AASLD/IDSA Guidelines identify individuals for whom immediate \ntreatment would not be indicated in a correctional facility, such as individuals who would not be \nincarcerated long enough to complete the treatment.  [Id. at 14.]  Most importantly, the \nAASLLD/IDSA Guidelines quote that “in certain settings there remain factors that impact access \nto medications and the ability to deliver them to patients.  In these settings, clinicians may still \nneed to decide which patients should be treated first.”  [Id. at 9–10.] \nAs noted earlier, inmates are entitled to adequate care under the Eighth Amendment, but \nthis does not mean they are entitled to the best standard of care or “the gold standard.”  Atkins, \n2019 LEXIS 168976, at *50 (citing Rhinehart, 894 F.3d at 750).  The KDOC HCV treatment \nplan consists of many different policies and protocols on how to administer DAA treatments to \nits inmates.  All inmates have the choice and are recommended to be screened for HCV \ninfection.  [R. 168-29 at 7.]  After such inmates test positive, they are evaluated on a regular \nbasis depending on their APRI score to be considered for antiviral therapy.  [Id. at 8.]   \nThe past revisions to the KDOC HCV Guidance are improvements from the past \nprotocols that closely mirror the FBOP Guidelines.  Most notably, changes in the priority scale in \nthe KDOC 2018 plan include a reduction of the patient’s APRI score to trigger a referral to the \npatient for further evaluation and consideration of antiviral therapy.  [Id. at 11.]  The KDOC \nGuidelines establish a flexible prioritization system, that allows the medical providers to make \nexceptions based upon their individual medical judgments, thereby giving access to DAA \ntreatment to patients outside the guidelines.  [Id. at 11–12.]  The changes to the 2018 KDOC \nHCV Guidance were incorporated to increase the number of HCV inmates treated with DAAs, as \nDefendants have shown more inmates are currently being treated or have been approved for \n12 \n \n\nDAA treatment.  [Id. at 13–14.]  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not satisfied the objective component \nof the Eighth Amendment analysis.   \n2 \n  Plaintiffs have also not established the subjective element of their Eighth Amendment \nclaim.  A prisoner must demonstrate that the defendants acted with the requisite intent, which \nincludes that they had a “sufficiently culpable state of mind.”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, \n834 (1994); see also Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 302–03 (1991).  The plaintiff must show that \nsuch officials acted with “deliberate indifference” to a substantial risk that the prisoner would \nsuffer serious harm.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834; Wilson, 501 U.S. at 303; Dominguez v. Corr. \nMed. Servs., 55 F.3d 543, 550 (6th Cir. 2009); Woods v. Lecureux, 110 F.3d 1215, 1222 (6th Cir. \n1997).  “[D]eliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than negligence.”  \nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 835.  A prison official cannot be deemed liable under the Eighth \nAmendment “unless he subjectively knows of an excessive risk of harm to an inmate’s health or \nsafety and disregards that risk.”  Owen v. Hendrix, 2019 LEXIS 179539, at *5 (W.D. Tn Oct. 17, \n2019); Id. at 837.  However, “a plaintiff need not show that the official acted ‘for the very \npurpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.’”  Comstock v. McCrary, 273 \nF.3d 693, 703 (6th Cir. 2001) (quoting Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835).  As long recognized, \n“deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner is the equivalent of \nrecklessly disregarding that risk.”  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 836.  \nDifferences in judgment between an inmate and prison medical personnel regarding the \nappropriate medical diagnosis or treatment are not enough to state a deliberate indifference \nclaim.  Hill v. Haviland, 68 F. App’x 603, 604 (6th Cir. 2003) (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. \n97, 107 (1976)).  Furthermore, when “a prisoner has received some medical attention and the \n13 \n \n\ndispute is over the adequacy of the treatment, federal courts are generally reluctant to second \nguess medical judgments and to constitutionalize claims that sound is state tort law.”  Graham ex \nrel. Estate of Graham v. County of Washtenaw, 358 F.3d 377, 385 (6th Cir. 2004).  However, \nprison officials may not entirely insulate themselves from liability under § 1983 simply by \nproviding some measure of treatment.  Deliberate indifference can be established in cases where \nit can be shown that a defendant rendered “grossly inadequate care” or made a “decision to take \nan easier but less efficacious course of treatment.”  Terrance. v. Northville Reg’l Psychiatric \nHosp., 286 F.3d 834, 843 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1255 \n(11th Cir. 1999)).  \na \nPlaintiffs have not presented any proof that Dr. Kemen nor any of the other medical \nproviders acted with a culpable state of mind equivalent to criminal recklessness.  Defendants \nhave shown that Dr. Kemen and other providers have exercised their medical judgment to \nprovide reasonable care for KDOC HCV inmates by updating KDOC policies and treatment \nprotocols for HCV inmates and providing treatment where such resources are limited.  [R. 168 at \n9–10.]  Changes in the treatment protocol used by KDOC and the decision of which specific \npatients should be treated first are all processes that involve reasoned medical judgment.  \nThe KDOC medical staff carefully monitor and evaluate HCV patients on a consistent \nbasis.  [R. 168 at 12.]  According to Dr. Kemen, “When a patient tests positive for the antibody, \nadditional testing is conducted to determine whether the HCV virus is active.  After identifying \npatients with an HCV infection, treatment with direct acting antiviral therapy is prioritized based \nupon the virus’s progressions and the exercise of independent medical judgment.”  [Id.] \nHowever, Defendants claim that prisoners should receive HCV treatment of DAA drugs as soon \n14 \n \n\nas possible to remove the HCV infection, no matter what the level infection.  [R. 126 at 11.]  As \nthe Sixth Circuit has pointed out, “such ongoing and responsive medical treatment is the \nantithesis of deliberate indifference.”  Villarreal v. Holland, 3016 WL 673750, at *25 (E.D. Ky. \nFeb. 17, 2011) (citing Brooks v. Celeste, 39 F.3d 125, 128 (6th Cir. 1994); see also Lara-Portela \nv. Stine, 2008 LEXIS 111, 2008 WL 45398, at *7–9 (E.D. Ky. Jan. 2, 2008)).  Likewise, the \nCourt in Hix v. Tennessee Dep’t of Corrections, concluded that the inmate’s claim that prison \ndoctors mistreated his HCV and “made a deliberate decision to await Plaintiff’s death by his \nliver shutting down” amounted to a claim of medical malpractice and did not state an Eighth \nAmendment claim.  196 F. App’x at 357.  \nUltimately, the court must consider the wide discretion allowed to prison officials in their \ntreatment of prisoners under authorized medical procedures.  See Westlake, 537 F.2d at 860.  \n“[W]hether . . . additional diagnostic techniques or forms of treatment is indicated is a classic \nexample of a matter for medical judgment.”  Estelle, 429 U.S. at 107.  A decision to not \nadminister a certain form of medical treatment does not represent cruel and unusual punishment.  \nId.  Because the record reflects and Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence in opposition, Dr. \nKemen, along with the other medical providers have consciously exercised KDOC’s HCV \ntreatment policies and protocols and the Court cannot conclude that the KDOC medical \nproviders have acted or will act with a culpable state of mind regarding the inmates’ HCV \ntreatment.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not met their burden of establishing the subjective element \nof their Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim against Defendants.  \nC \n  Defendants have set out legally compelling and sound arguments for summary judgment \non the claims arising under the Rehabilitation and Americans with Disabilities Act.  [R. 168.]  \n15 \n \n\nHowever, Plaintiffs have failed to respond to these arguments in their Response to Summary \nJudgment.  [See R. 182.]  Under the Local Rules for the Eastern District of Kentucky, “[f]ailure \nto timely respond to a motion may be grounds for granting the motion.”  LR 7.1(c); see also \nHumphrey v. U.S. Attorney General’s Office, 279 Fed. App’x 328, 331 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(recognizing that in certain instances a party’s lack of response to a motion or argument may be \ngrounds for the district court to assume that the non-moving party waives opposition and grant \nthe motion).  However, in cases involving motions for summary judgment, a lack of response to \nthe motion does not lessen the burden of the moving party to demonstrate the absence of a \ngenuine issue of material fact, nor does the lack of response lessen the burden of the Court “to \nexamine the movant’s motion … to ensure that he has discharged that burden.”  Carver v. Bunch, \n946 F.2d 451, 454–55 (6th Cir. 1991).  \n  Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, “no qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  Medical care in prisons constitutes such “services, programs, \nor activities” contemplated.  United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 (2006).  Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act similarly protects any “otherwise qualified individual” from “be[ing] \nexcluded from the participation in, be[ing] denied the benefits of, or be[ing] subjected to \ndiscrimination” under specified programs “solely by reason of her or his disability.”  29 U.S.C. § \n794(a). \n  The proper defendant in a claim arising under the American with Disabilities Act is a \npublic entity or an official acting in his official capacity.  Carten v. Kent State Univ., 282 F.3d \n391, 396–97 (6th Cir. 2002).  Therefore, Defendants sued in their individual capacities do not \n16 \n \n\nmeet the criteria to qualify as proper defendants under the American with Disabilities Act claim.  \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs’ American with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act claims still fail as \nto all Defendants because Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that they are being \ndiscriminated against because of their disability.  The policies and protocol apply to all HCV \npositive inmates and therefore “all similarly situated inmates are treated equally and obtain the \nbenefits of the program in the same way.”  [R. 168 at 43.]  In addition, Plaintiffs are not being \nexcluded or denied treatment, as they are put on a waiting list to receive treatment, while they are \nmonitored for viral progression.  [Id.]  \n  “The failure to provide medical treatment to a disabled prisoner, while perhaps raising \nEighth Amendment concerns in certain circumstances, does not constitute an American with \nDisabilities Act violation.”  Stevens v. Hutchinson, 2013 WL 4926813, at *13 (W.D. Mich. Sept. \n12, 2013);  See Bryant v. Madigan, 84 F.3d 246, 249 (7th Cir. 1996) (concluding that the \nAmerican with Disabilities Act “would not be violated by a prison simply failing to attend to the \nmedical needs of its disabled prisoners” and that the statute “does not create a remedy for \nmedical malpractice”); McNally v. Prison Health Servs., 46 F.Supp.2d 49, 58 (D. Me. 1999) \n(distinguishing between “claims that the medical treatment received for a disability was \ninadequate from claims that a prisoner has been denied access to services or programs because \nhe is disabled,” and concluding that only the latter class of claims states an American with \nDisabilities Act violation).  Thus, Defendants have adequately shown that no genuine issue of \nfact exists in regard to Plaintiffs’ claims arising under the American with Disabilities Act and \nRehabilitation Act.  \n \n \n17 \n \n\nD  \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  In order to hear a suit, the Court must \nhave subject-matter jurisdiction over it.  See, e.g., Thornton v. Southwest Detroit Hosp., 895 F.2d \n1131, 1133 (6th Cir. 1990) (explaining a “federal court lacks authority to hear a case without \nsubject matter jurisdiction”).  The Plaintiffs’ American with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, \nand § 1983 claims were removable to this Court because the claims arose under federal law.  See \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 (“The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising \nunder the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”).  The remainder of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are based on Kentucky’s Negligence and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Stress \nstandards.  They are not federal questions, but were removed to this Court on the basis of \nsupplemental jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (“[I]n any civil action of which the district \ncourts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all \nother claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they \nform part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.”).  \nWithout the American with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, and § 1983 claims, however, \nthere is no longer a basis for supplemental jurisdiction over the state law violations. \nHaving already dismissed the claims arising under federal law, any remaining state law \nclaims are best reserved for the state courts.  See, e.g., Moon v. Harrison Piping Supply, 465 F.3d \n719, 728 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that “a federal court that has dismissed a plaintiff’s federal-law \nclaims should not ordinarily reach the plaintiff’s state law claims”).  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ \nclaims related to Negligence and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress arising under \nKentucky law in Counts Three and Four of the complaint are properly remanded.   \n \n18 \n \n\nE \nPlaintiffs also are not entitled to punitive damages against any Defendant.  Punitive \ndamages are only available in an action brought under § 1983 \"when the defendant's conduct is \nshown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous \nindifference to the federally protected rights of the plaintiff.\"  Brown v. Brown, 46 Fed. App'x. \n324, 325 (6th Cir. 2002) (citing Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S. Ct. 1625, 75 L. Ed. 2d \n632 (1983)).  As explained above, the Court has found that the evidence presented does not \nsupport a finding that any Defendant acted with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional rights, and there has certainly been no evidence presented of an evil motive or of \ncallous indifference to their rights. Thus, no reasonable jury could award punitive damages to \nPlaintiffs on their federal claims.   \nIII \n  Therefore, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently advised, it is hereby ORDERED as \nfollows: \n1.  The Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment [R. 168] is GRANTED as to \nCounts One and Two of the Plaintiffs’ Complaint; \n2.  Counts Three through Four of the Plaintiffs’ Complaint regarding state law \nviolations are REMANDED for further consideration by the state court; \n3.  The pending motions [R. 179; R. 180; R. 183; R. 188] are DENIED AS MOOT;  \n4.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for leave to Seal a Document [R. 184] is GRANTED; and \n5.  This case is STRICKEN from the Court’s active docket. \n  This the 4th day of February, 2020. \n \n19 \n \n\n \n \n \n20 \n ",

Introduction \nI.  The Hepatitis C virus - HCV -- poses an unreasonable and substantial risk of \nserious present and future medical and physical harm to those who are infected with it, and to the \ngeneral public when infected inmates are released from prison. Roe v. Elyea, 631 F.3d 843 (7th \nCir. 2011). \n2.  Conscious delay, denial, or interference in medical treatment of HCV for non-\nmedical reasons -- standing alone -- states a plausible claim against prison officials for deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical needs of a prisoner in violation of the Eighth and Founeenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. §1983.  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 \nu.s. \n89, 90 (2007). \n3.  Plaintiffs are all inmates of the Kentucky Department of Corrections (\"KDOC\")  .e.n.  \n0 \ng0  \nwho are infected with  the Hepatitis C  virus (\"HCV\").

This is a class action that seeks injunctive relief where and as appropriate, and \nrecovery of damages, under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and other applicable state claims, for Defendants' \nviolation of the Eighth Amendment as  a result of their deliberate indifference to the serious \nmedical needs of Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated. \n5.  HCY, if left untreated, may progress toward end-stage liver disease and death. \nMajor advances  in  treatment  have  recently  been  made \"vith  the  introduction of medication \nregimens having increasingly higher success rates, fewer side effects, and much shorter treatment \ndurations. The Kentucky Department of Corrections (\"KDOC\") is currently preparing a new \nHCY treatment plan (\"the New Plan\").  However, even if the New Plan meets the prevailing \nstandard of care,  future developments in treatment are likely to  render it obsolete, and it is \nanticipated that  there will  be  inconsistencies,  inaccuracies and unwarranted deviations in its \nimplementation, particularly given the expense of new treatment regimens.  In addition, the New \nPlan is the first amendment to the KDOC's old HCY treatment plan (\"the Old Plan\") since 2007, \nand many members of the class may have been harmed by Defendants' failure to regularly and \nconsistently update the plan to  mirror the established standard of care.  finally, there may be \nissues concerning the reliability of the testing to which HCV- infected inmates are subjected, \nraising questions as to the integrity of and motivations underlying, such testing. \n6.  It is the purpose of this litigation not only to protect Plaintiffs and the class, but \nthe general public into which Plaintiffs and members of the class will be released.  ... \nC1> \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n.0.,  \ng \n0 \n0 \n0 \n3 \nTendered  15-CI-00063  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Franklin Circuit Clerk \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 1-2   Filed: 12/07/16   Page: 5 of 54 - Page ID#: 10J \nTendered  15-CI-0006~  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Fra ....l in Circuit Clerk \nII. Jurisdiction and Venue \n7.  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  seek injunctive  relief where  and  as  appropriate,  and \ndamages under the Civil Rights Act of 1871,42 U.S.C. § 1983, for Defendants' violations ofthe \nrights, privileges and immunities guaranteed Plaintiffs and the class by the Eighth Amendment to \nthe  U.S.  Constitution.  Plaintiffs  and  the  class  also  seek  damages  for  negligence,  gross \nnegligence, outrageous conduct, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violations of \napplicable Kentucky regulations and KDOC policies.  Defendants are all domiciled in Franklin \nCounty, Kentucky, and venue is therefore proper in this Court. \nIII. Parties \n8.  Plaintiffs are all inmates of the KDOC who are infected with HCV. \n9.

Common questions include (1) whether \nDefendants have been deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of Plaintiffs and the \n\"...'.  \n0 \n0 \nmembers of the class; (2) whether Defendants have failed and refused to provide the necessary  00  \n'0 \n<D \nstaging  of HCV patients  in accordance  with  the prevailing  standard  of care,  including the  0~  \n0 \n0 \n6 \nTendered  15-CI-00063  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Franklin Circuit Clerk \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 1-2   Filed: 12/07/16   Page: 8 of 54 - Page ID#: 13\nTendered  15-CI-00063  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Fran •... tl Circuit Clerk \npretreatment testing and specialist consults that are needed to determine the  severity of the \ndisease and the need for treatment; (3) whether Defendants have failed and refused to provide \ntreatment for Plaintiffs and the members of the class with the newest, most effective medications \nfor HCV in accordance with the prevailing standard of care; and (4) whether Defendants' failure \nto provide treatment to Plaintiffs and the class in accordance with the prevailing standard of care \nfor treatment of HCV has caused them compensable injury. \n21.  Each day treatment is postponed, the likelihoods of cirrhosis of the liver, liver \ncancer, a liver transplant, and death from HCV grow for each member of the Class, as does the \nlikelihood of infection for those with whom they come in contact in KDOC facilities and for \nmembers of the general public after they are released. \n22.

Facts \na.  HCV Defined \n25.  Hepatitis C is a blood borne disease caused by the Hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\"). \nThe virus brings about inflammation that damages  liver cells.  1t  is  a  leading cause of liver \ndisease and liver transplants. \n26.  There are several different genotypes of HCV, with subtypes. Genotype 1 is the \nmost common type ofHCV in the United States. \n27.  Approximately 80% of people who become infected with the HCV virus will \ndeYelop chronic HCV. \n28.  Chronic HCV patients develop fibrosis (liver scarring), which can worsen liver \nfunction until the patienr develops cirrhosis. Ultimately, patients may end up with end-stage liver \ndisease, cancer, or other serious illnesses. Some patients will need a liver transplant, and others \nwill die. \n29.  HCV  is  transmitted by  infected blood.  Methods of transmission  include:  (a) \nphysical activity in sports, (b) tattooing, (c) use of a needle not properly cleaned and sterilized, \n(d)  exposure  to  an  infected  person's  blood  in  the  course  of medical  care,  (e)  barber  and \ncosmetology care, (f) sexual activity, (g) sharing of eating utensils and food, (h) sharing razors or \nother personal grooming supplies, (i} sharing bathrooms or shower facilities, (j) sharing living \nquarters, or (k) physical violence between inmates or involving staff. \n30.  It is  widely  accepted  that  the  number  of reported  cases  of HCV  nationwide \nunderstates its acntal prevalence. ln 2000, the United States Surgeon General called HCV a \n\"' \nC~>  \nC> \n\"silent epidemic,'' and estimated that as much as rn·o percent of the adult U.S. population had  CC>>  \n0 \no:> \nC> \nHCV.

The last decade has seen a spike in reported cases of HCV among young people. \nThis increase in new cases of HCV is largely attributable to the increase in opioid addiction and \nthe resulting use of intravenous drugs. \n32.  The incidence of HCV is not diminishing, and its effects are worsening. ln 2011, \nthe CDC reported that HCV had overtaken HIV as a cause of death. \nb.  HCV in Prison \n33.  The prevalence of HCV in  prison is  higher than in the general population. It is \nestimated to be anywhere from 9.6% to 41.1% of the prison population nationally. \n34.  In 1997, according to one study, 29% to 43% of all people infected with HCV in \nthe United States passed through a correctional facility.  Combatting HCV demands effective \nresponse in the correctional setting, particularly in states with serious intravenous drug problems \nlike Kentucky. \nc.  History of HCV Treatment \n35.  Treatment exists for chronic HCV. The available treatments have changed over \ntime. \n36.  In  1991, a drug called Interferon was approved to  be used alone.  Seven years \nlater, the FDA approved the use of Ribavirin alongside Interferon, and in 2001, Ribavirin was \npaired with Pegylated Interferon. This regimen was referred to as combination therapy. \n37.·  The standard of care after 2001  was to treat Genotypes 2 or 3 with combination \ntherapy, and to treat Genorype 1 with combination therapy if the patient had reached a certain \nstage of liver damage, typically measured by a liver biopsy. lf, after treatment, the virus was not  ... \nC1l \n0 \n0 \nsuppressed,  or if it  was suppressed during treatment but later returned, there  was no other  8 \n0 \n\"g'  \ntreatment available for the so-called nonresponder or relapser.  0g  \n9 \nTendered  15-CI-00063  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Franklin Circuit Clerk \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 1-2   Filed: 12/07/16   Page: 11 of 54 - Page ID#:\nTendered  15-CI-0006~  11/02/2016  16Amy Feldman, Fra. ,,fin Circuit Clerk \n38.  20 II saw the FDA approval of two protease inhibitors that produced better results \nwhen either one was taken with combination therapy, especially for Genotype 1 (SVR of 60-\n80%). \n39.  ln 2013  and  2014, the  FDA approved more new antiviral medications. These \nmedications can now be taken as part of an Interferon-free regimen. The change is dramatic; the \nworst side effects are avoided. The regimen is a much shorter duration- 12 weeks for some, 24 \nweeks for others. Best of all, the success rate for these regimens is better than combination or \ntriple therapy - well over 90%, including for nonresponders and relapsers. \n40.  In October 2013, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) announcement of \nnew \"breakthrough\"  direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs to  cure HCV caused the American \nAssociation for the  Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and the Infectious Disease Society of  0 \n\"' \nN \nCIO \nAmerica  (TDSA),  the  two  relevant  professional  medical  associations  concerned  with  the  ! \nQ \na:: \nw \ntreatment and cure of HCV,  to  convene  the  AASLD/IDSA ''HCV Guidance  Panel.\"  Thirty  X \n0w..  \nX \nIll \nnational  experts,  including  gastroenterologists  and  hepatologists  with experience  in treating  -; \n0.. \n:::i \n....1 \nHCV. comprise the HCV Guidance Panel.

In October 2014, the FDA approved more advanced HCV breakthrough DAA \ndmgs that cure at a 95% rate,  and eliminate Interferon injections completely - Harvoni and \nViekira-Pak.  On June 29, 2015, the AASLD/IDSA updated the HCV standard of care, which \nnow  requires  that  treatment providers  eliminate  Interferon  in  any  form  as  a  recommended \ntreatment for HCV. Only the October 2014 non-Interferon \"breakthrough\" DAA drugs, Harvoni \nand Yie.kira-Pak, now meet the undisputed community standard of care for all I:ICV treatment \nproviders. \n44.  Current  AASLD/IDSA  standard-of-care  also  reqUires  that  HCV  treatment \nproviders treat all HCV-infected patients as soon as possible with the most-recently approved  0 \n\"' \nN \n0;e0.  \nDAA drugs  to  remove the HCV infection,  no  matter what the  level of infection.

The expense increased because of the additional \nmedication. \n48.  There  have  also  been  changes  in  how the  disease  is  monitored.  To measure \nfibrosis, providers now generally forego a liver biopsy in favor of non-invasive tests. Blood tests \ncan offer an accurate assessment of liver fibrosis, and these tests can be coupled with certain \ntypes of scanning if desired. \n49.  These new developments in staging the disease, and treating it, have eliminated \nthe barriers to a cure. \nd.  History of HCV Treatment in the KDOC \n50.  The KDOC's Old HCV Plan was developed in 2007 by state officials in response \nto  litigation by prisoners complaining of their HCV treatment.  See Paulley v.  Chandler, No. \n3:99-CV-00549, 2000 WL 33975579, at *I  (W.D. Ky. 2000). When a prisoner was diagnosed \nwith HCV, the Old Plan laid out the procedure for treating and controlling the disease. \n51.  Even though the Old Plan required compliance with the prevailing standard of \ncare, and despite  the advances in  HCV  treatment over the last decade,  it  bas not yet been \n. \nupdated.  The Old Plan made  no  mention of the triple therapy treatment that had been the \nstandard of care since 20 II. Without policy and procedure guidance, testing and treatment \nof HCV by the KDOC has been ad hoc, arbitrary and capricious, and responsive to cost \nand  administrative  convenience,  not  the  medical  needs  of Plaintiffs  and  the  class. \nMoreover, since around July 2014, other than the  most serious cases of HCV in the \nKDOC's  institutions,  no  one  with  HCV  was  treated  pending  developments  in  HCV  .<.1.>.  \n.0 . \n0 \n8 \ntreatment options.

Whether the f\\Jew Plan meets the applicable standard of care is currently \nthe subject of litigation in Woodcock v. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections, et al., Case No. 5: 12-cv-\n135 (W.D.Ky.). Whether the New Plan will be followed and implemented in all deserving cases, \ntogether with the damages incurred from the delay in its implementation, is the subject of this \ncase. \ne.  The Named Plaintiffs \ni.  Brian Woodcock \n52.  :vlr. Woodcock is an inmate at the Kentucky State Penitentiary (\"KSP\"). A biopsy \nof Mr. Woodcock's liver in December 2011 showed that the fibrosis in his liver - an indication \nof the severity of his condition-- had progressed from Stage I to Stage 2. For that reason, no less \nan authority than Dr. Steven Shedlofsky, the creator and then-director of the Old Plan, found that \nMr. Woodcock qualified for antiviral prescription medication under the provisions of the Old \nPlan. However, after the KDOC terminated its association with Dr. Shedlofsky, a dispute arose \nover  whether  Mr.  Woodcock  qualified  for  treatment  under  the  Old  Plan  and,  if so,  the \nappropriate treatment for his condition. \n53.  It was not until almost four years after filing a pro se lawsuit in federal court \n(Woodcock v. Kentucky Dept. of Corrections, et al., Case No. 5:12-cv-135 (W.D.Ky.)) that Mr. \nWoodcock  began  receiving  treatment  for  his  condition,  but  not  before  his  infection  had \nprogressed almost to Stage 4 cirrhosis.  His request for leave to amend his complaint in that case \nto  assert a claim  for  actual damages resulting from  the delay in his  treatment was  recently \ndenied.  ... \n<1) \nC> \nCg>  \n'0 \nM \n0 \nCg>  \n13 \nTendered  15-CI-00063  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Franklin Circuit Clerk \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 1-2   Filed: 12/07/16   Page: 15 of 54 - Page ID#:\n20\nTendered  15-CI-00063  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Fran.\"m Circuit Clerk \nii.

Salinas has been denied testing and treatment of his chronic HCV infection. \nOn October 26, 2011, Mr. Salinas was told that he would receive the new HCV \"triple-therapy\" \nonce it became available to the  KDOC.  When, on February 27, 2015, Mr.  Salinas filed  a \n\"Petition for Mandamus\" that initiated this litigation, in order to obtain testing and treatment for \nhis condition, his petition was met by Defendants not with testing and treatment, but with a \nmotion to dismiss his petition to this Court for relief. \niii.  Keath Bramblett \n56.  Mr. Bramblett is an inmate at KSR, who acquired his HCV as a consequence of  0 \n(.0 \n\"' \n<0 \none of the infection-control positions he has  held during his incarceration.

Plaintiffs and the class have HCV, an obviously serious medical need.  Instead of \nreceiving effective treatment for their condition, compliant with the standard of care, they have \neither  been  denied  any  treatment,  and/or  have  had  their treatment  intenupted  by  its  inept \nimplementation, and/or have been required to engage in practices that are entirely inconsistent \nwith treatment and may actually be hastening a spread of the infection.  Defendants' conduct that \ndirectly or indirectly contributed to a worsening of the condition of Plaintiffs and any member of \nthe class was intentional. reckless, deliberate, wanton and/or malicious, and was indicative of \ntheir total, deliberate and reckless disregard of and indifference to the lives and constitutional \nrights of Plaintiffs and the class. \n60.  Plaintiffs believe and, after reasonable discovery, will show that their treatment \nby Defendants was not unusual, but was part of a continuing policy, procedure, protocol, custom \nand/or practice of Defendants of willfully and deliberately ignoring the medical needs of inmates \nwith HCV, and/or leaving their fates in the hands of correctional and medical employees that \nwere ill-trained and ill-supervised, and that had long demonstrated their lack of qualifications to \nI \nresponsibly discharge their duties.  Such conduct is the result of policies, procedures, protocols, \ncustoms and/or practices of Defendants, either written or unwritten, which are systematically \napplied to all persons who are diagnosed with HCV while incarcerated in KDOC institutions. \nSuch practices constitute an arbitrary use of government power, and evince a total, intentional, \ndeliberate and unreasonable disregard for and indifference to the lives and constitutional and \ncommon law rights of Plaintiffs and the class. and the wholesale violations of those rights likely \nto result from the regular and systematic pursuit of such policies, procedures, protocols, customs  a. \n0~  \n0 \n0 \nand/or practices.  00  \n.... \nc; \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n1-\n15 \nTendered  15-CI-00063  11/02/2016  Amy Feldman, Franklin Circuit Clerk \n\nCase: 3:16-cv-00096-GFVT-EBA   Doc #: 1-2   Filed: 12/07/16   Page: 17 of 54 - Page ID#:\n22\nTendered  15-CI-0006=>  11/0212016  Amy Feldman, Fra .... 1in Circuit Clerk \n61.  As  a  result  of the  foregoing.
