    "summary": "<p>This is a case about content regulation of social-media providers in Florida. On May 27, 2021, NetChoice and Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association (two trade associations that seek to promote and protect free speech and free enterprise on the Internet) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. The trade associations sued Florida state officials, including the Attorney General of Florida, Deputy Secretary of the Florida Department of Management Services, and the Florida Elections Commission under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 and Ex parte Young. Represented by private counsel, the trade associations sought an immediate injunction on a new state law that was set to go into effect on July 1, 2021. They also sought a declaration that the law was unconstitutional. They claimed that this law, Senate Bill 7072 (\"Bill\"), adopted by the 2021 Florida Legislature, infringed on freedom of speech, equal protection, and due process under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. They also claimed that this law exceeded the state of Florida&rsquo;s authority under the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s Commerce Clause and was preempted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.<br />&nbsp;<br />Among other provisions, the Bill would have prohibited social-media providers in Florida from barring posts by any candidate for office, even if they posted alleged misinformation, incitements to violence, or other content that violated the providers&rsquo; standards. The Bill would also have limited providers&rsquo; ability to deploy algorithms for these candidates&rsquo; posts. Furthermore, while imposing a size requirement for providers to whom it was applicable, the Bill carved out an exception for local businesses.<br />&nbsp;<br />In June 2021, several large public interest organizations filed amicus briefs in support of the plaintiffs. These included the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Internet Association.<br />&nbsp;<br />On June 30, 2021, after briefs and oral arguments from both parties, Judge Robert Hinkle granted a preliminary injunction, enjoining &ldquo;enforcement of the parts of the legislation that are preempted or violate the First Amendment.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />In its ruling, the court agreed with the plaintiffs that the Bill&rsquo;s regulatory impositions about deplatforming and content control appeared to contradict federal law. Additionally, the court clarified that the First Amendment concerns government control of free speech&mdash;not private entities&rsquo; control, as the defendants suggested. Based on Supreme Court case law, the court determined that the Bill required analysis via the standard of strict scrutiny, and ultimately would not withstand it because &ldquo;promoting speech on one side of an issue or restricting speech on the other . . . is not a legitimate state interest.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />In addition to plaintiffs&rsquo; likelihood of success, the court found the other factors for preliminary injunction easily satisfied: there would be irreparable injury to the plaintiffs without the injunction; there would be greater potential damages to plaintiffs without the injunction than damages from the injunction to defendants; and the injunction would not harm the public interest.<br />&nbsp;<br />On July 12, 2021, Florida state officials appealed the preliminary injunction decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. No. 21-12355-GG. Accordingly, on August 25, 2021, the district court stayed further proceedings until resolution of the appeal.<br />&nbsp;<br />On May 23, 2022, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed and vacated in part the district court&rsquo;s opinion and remanded it back down for revision according to its judgment. Circuit Judge Kevin C. Newsom held that the media platforms engaged in First-Amendment-protected activity, and the media platforms were not common carriers. All but one of the statutory provisions triggered First Amendment strict scrutiny because the entire bill was motivated by the state&rsquo;s viewpoint-based purpose to defend conservatives&rsquo; speech from perceived liberal big tech bias.<br />&nbsp;<br />The circuit court further held the media platforms were not likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that every challenged provision was per se invalid because of the Bill's viewpoint-based motivation. The relevant provisions of S.B. 7072&mdash;which are codified at Fla. Stat. &sect;&sect; 106.072 and 501.20412&mdash;could be divided into three categories: (1) content-moderation restrictions, (2) disclosure obligations, and (3) a user-data requirement.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />However, the platforms were likely to succeed on three claims:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>That prohibitions against de-platforming candidates, deprioritizing and &ldquo;shadow-banning&rdquo; content, and censoring &ldquo;journalistic enterprises&rdquo; violated the First Amendment,&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>That requiring media platforms to apply their standards in a consistent manner and allowing users to opt-out of their algorithms, and limiting changes to their user agreements violated First Amendment, and</li>\r\n<li>That the requirement that they provide notice and detailed justification for every content-moderation action was unduly burdensome.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The circuit court thus left the injunction against the provisions relevant to the above claims. The court vacated the injunction on the disclosure provision because it was not likely a constitutional violation. 34 F.4th 1196.<br />&nbsp;<br />On June 16, 2022, the parties jointly filed a motion to stay the case in the Eleventh Circuit. The court granted it five days later pending their future petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The parties filed similar motions to extend the stay in the district court on June 16, 2022. The district court granted the motion on June 18. The defendants filed their notice for a writ of certiorari on September 23, 2022. As of October 29, 2022, the case is pending.</p>",

(Fla. 2021) (hereinafter, the “Act”),1 which infringes on the rights \nto freedom of speech, equal protection, and due process protected by the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  The Act also exceeds the State of \nFlorida’s authority under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause and is preempted by \nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act.  Because the Act violates the \nconstitutional rights of Plaintiffs’ members and contravenes federal law, it should be \npromptly enjoined before it takes effect on July 1, 2021.  \nOverview \n \n1.  The Act, a first-of-its-kind statute, was enacted on May 2, 2021 and \nsigned into law on May 24, 2021 to restrict the First Amendment rights of a targeted \nselection of online businesses by having the State of Florida dictate how those \nbusinesses must exercise their editorial judgment over the content hosted on their \n \n1 The Act is codified in scattered sections of the Florida Statutes, including §§ 106.072, 287.137, \n501.2041, 501.212.  Below, the Act’s specific provisions are identified by Section (e.g., “Act § 2”), \nas well as the provision of the Florida Statutes where they will be codified (e.g., “§ 106.072”). \n  -2-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 3 of 70\n \n \nprivately owned websites.  The Act discriminates against and infringes the First \nAmendment rights of these targeted companies, which include Plaintiffs’ members, \nby compelling them to host—and punishing them for taking virtually any action to \nremove or make less prominent—even highly objectionable or illegal content, no \nmatter how much that content may conflict with their terms or policies.   \n2.  These unprecedented restrictions are a blatant attack on a wide range of \ncontent-moderation choices that these private companies have to make on a daily \nbasis to protect their services, users, advertisers, and the public at large from a      \nvariety  of  harmful,  offensive,  or  unlawful  material:    pornography,  terrorist \nincitement, false propaganda created and spread by hostile foreign governments, \ncalls  for  genocide  or  race-based  violence,  disinformation  regarding  Covid-19 \nvaccines, fraudulent schemes, egregious violations of personal privacy, counterfeit \ngoods and other violations of intellectual property rights, bullying and harassment, \nconspiracy theories denying the Holocaust or 9/11, and dangerous computer viruses.  \nMeanwhile, the Act prohibits only these disfavored companies from deciding how \nto arrange or prioritize content—core editorial  functions protected by the First \nAmendment—based on its relevance and interest to their users.  And the Act goes \nso far as to bar those companies from adding their own commentary to certain \ncontent  that  they  host  on  their  privately  owned  services—even  labeling  such \n  -3-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 4 of 70\n \n \ncommentary as “censorship” and subjecting the services to liability simply for \n“post[ing] an addendum to any content or material posted by a user.”   \n3.  Under the Act, these highly burdensome restrictions apply only to a \nselect group of online businesses, leaving countless other entities that offer similar \nservices wholly untouched by Florida law—including any otherwise-covered online \nservice that happens to be owned by The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”) or other \nlarge  entities  that  operate  a  “theme  park.”    This  undisguised  singling  out  of \ndisfavored companies reflects the Act’s true purpose, which its sponsors freely \nadmitted: to target and punish popular online services for their perceived views and \nfor  certain  content-moderation  decisions  that  state  officials  opposed—in  other \nwords, to retaliate against these companies for exercising their First Amendment \nrights  of  “editorial  discretion  over  speech  and  speakers  on  their  property.”  \nManhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck, 139 S. Ct. 1921, 1931 (2019).  \n4.  Rather than preventing what it calls “censorship,” the Act does the \nexact opposite:  it empowers government officials in Florida to police the protected \neditorial judgment of online businesses that the State disfavors and whose perceived \npolitical  viewpoints  it  wishes  to  punish.    This  is  evident  from  Governor  Ron \nDeSantis’ own press release that touts the Act as a means to “tak[e] back the virtual \npublic  square”  from  “the  leftist  media  and  big  corporations,”  who  supposedly \n  -4-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 5 of 70\n \n \n“discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology.”2  The Governor’s \npress release also leaves no doubt about the Legislature’s unconstitutional viewpoint \ndiscrimination:  quoting a state legislator, it proclaims that “our freedom of speech \nas conservatives is under attack by the ‘big tech’ oligarchs in Silicon Valley.  But in \nFlorida, [this] … will not be tolerated.”3   \n5.  Although  the  Act  uses  scare  terms  such  as  “censoring,”  “shadow \nbanning,”  and  “deplatforming”  to  describe  the  content  choices  of  the  targeted \ncompanies, it is in fact the Act that censors and infringes on the companies’ rights \nto free speech and expression; the Act that compels them to host speech and speakers \nthey disagree with; and the Act that engages in unconstitutional speaker-based, \ncontent-based, and viewpoint-based preferences.  The legislative record leaves no \ndoubt that the State of Florida lacks any legitimate interest—much less a compelling \none—in  its  profound  infringement  of  the  targeted  companies’  fundamental \nconstitutional  rights.    To  the  contrary,  the  Act  was  animated  by  a  patently \nunconstitutional and political motive to target and retaliate against certain companies \nbased on the State’s disapproval of how the companies decide what content to \ndisplay and make available through their services.   \n \n2 Press Release, Governor Ron DeSantis Signs Bill to Stop the Censorship of Floridians by Big \nTech (May 24, 2021) (“May 24, 2021 Gov. DeSantis Press Release”), www.flgov.com/2021/05/24\n/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-to-stop-the-censorship-of-floridians-by-big-tech  (last  accessed \nMay 26, 2021). \n3 Id.  \n  -5-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 6 of 70\n \n \n6.  The  Act  is  a  frontal  assault  on  the  First  Amendment  and  an \nextraordinary intervention by the government in the free marketplace of ideas that \nwould  be  unthinkable  for  traditional  media,  book  sellers,  lending  libraries,  or \nnewsstands.  Could Florida require that the Miami Herald publish, or move to the \nfront page, an op-ed or letter to the editor that the State favored, or demand that the \nHerald publish guest editorials in a state-sanctioned sequence?  The answer is \nobviously no—as the Supreme Court unanimously held five decades ago in Miami \nHerald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974).  Yet the State now seeks to \nrepeat that history—and to go even further by, for example, compelling the targeted \ncompanies to alter and disclose their editorial standards and to provide “detailed” \ninformation about the algorithms they use to curate content.        \n7.  The Act is so rife with fundamental infirmities that it appears to have \nbeen enacted without any regard for the Constitution.  The Act imposes a slew of \nhopelessly vague content-based, speaker-based, and viewpoint-based restrictions on \nthe editorial judgments and affirmative speech of the selected online businesses that \nit targets.  These include the following unconstitutional provisions (the “Moderation \nRestrictions”), all of which facially violate the First Amendment:    \na.  Through  its  unprecedented  “deplatforming”  provision,  the  Act \nprohibits targeted online services from terminating or suspending the accounts of \n  -6-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 7 of 70\n \n \n“candidate[s]” for state or local political office.4  This ban applies no matter how \negregious or illegal the candidate’s conduct on a platform is—and regardless of \nwhether that conduct violates the online businesses’ terms of use and community \nstandards.  Its prohibition on the use of judgment over the display of content \nfavored by the Legislature is backed by draconian fines of $250,000 per day.5 \nb.  The  Act  simultaneously  bans  the  use  of  algorithms  to  organize, \nprioritize, or otherwise curate “content and material posted by or about” anyone \npaying the filing fee necessary to qualify as a political candidate.6  Under this \nsweeping moderation restriction, any post that even mentions a candidate is \nvirtually immune from algorithmic moderation.  This provision makes it unlawful \nfor covered online businesses to use their editorial discretion to curate content \nposted by or about candidates in ways that respond to their users’ interests.  It \nwould even prevent them from removing defamatory statements or “deepfake” \nfalsifications of a candidate’s words or movements.  One Florida legislator who \nvoted for the Act succinctly describes the issue: “My concern is about potential \n \n4 Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(2)).

The Act bans covered online businesses from engaging in a broad \nrange of constitutionally protected moderation activities—not only removing or \ntaking down content, but also editing content and even “post[ing] an addendum \nto any content” (i.e., engaging in their own affirmative speech)—with respect to \nthe novel and loosely defined concept of a “journalistic enterprise.”8  The term \n“journalistic enterprise” reaches far beyond traditional media outlets (sweeping \nin online propaganda outlets and conspiracy theorists, among others), without \naffording protections to prevent imposters, foreign agents, or insurrectionists \nfrom exploiting these rigid content-based mandates.  And these mandates make \nno exception for violent, sexually explicit, fraudulent, or otherwise unlawful \ncontent.9   \nd.

Like \nthe provisions discussed above, the chilling effect on speech is amplified by a \nnew private right of action authorizing awards of up to $100,000 in statutory \ndamages per claim and potential “punitive damages.”11 \ne.  The Act compels covered online businesses to allow users to “opt \nout” of algorithms governing content moderation altogether12—again without \nregard  to  the  egregious,  unlawful,  or dangerous  nature  of  the  content—and \nrequires targeted businesses to publicly disclose and justify their exercise of \ncuratorial  judgment,  including  revealing  highly  confidential  and  proprietary \nmethodologies used to moderate content.13  The Act further prohibits covered \nonline businesses from changing their editorial policies more than once every 30 \n \n10 Id.

The Act further violates the First Amendment and Equal Protection \nClause by (i) targeting only larger digital services and social media companies, while \n(ii) irrationally  exempting  Disney  and  Universal  Studios  (owned  by  Comcast \nCorporation) from its scope, simply because they own well-attended “theme parks” \nin Florida.15  The Act’s legislative sponsors acknowledged that they chose this \nprotectionist  carveout to ensure that  companies with especially large economic \nfootprints in Florida—like Disney—are not “caught up in this.”16  None of the \nModeration Restrictions apply to traditional media or non-digital hosts of third-party \nmaterial (such as book publishers or businesses that use traditional bulletin boards).  \nNor do they apply to online businesses that offer the same types of services, but do \nnot meet the arbitrary statutory requirements of having $100 million in annual \nrevenues or 100 million users anywhere in the world and thus qualifying as covered \n“social media platforms.”17  None of these arbitrary distinctions are supported by \nany legislative findings, or anything other than the impermissible desire to punish \n \n14 Id.

This underscores that the Act unconstitutionally \ndiscriminates  against  only  certain  speakers,  that  it  is  gravely  under-  and \noverinclusive, that it is neither narrowly tailored nor closely drawn, and that it is not \njustified by any legitimate (much less compelling) governmental interest.   \n9.  The Act doubles down on its unconstitutional singling out of “social \nmedia platforms” (a misleading term that also covers other digital services) by \nallowing the State Attorney General to create a blacklist of companies (and a broad \nrange of related persons) that may be banned from bidding on or doing business with \nthe State merely because they are accused of violating state or federal antitrust \nlaws.18  This blacklist applies only to targeted “social media platforms”—not to any \nother kind of business that may have been accused of violating or found to have \nactually violated antitrust laws.  The legislative and public record of the Act shows \nthat this punitive provision, like the rest of the Act, was designed to retaliate against \nthe targeted digital companies precisely because of their exercise of core First \nAmendment free speech rights, including their perceived political viewpoints, their \nprior exercise of editorial judgment, and their alleged views on particular political \ncandidates and office holders.  The statements about the Act by the Governor of \nFlorida and the law’s sponsors confirm that its passage was motivated by retaliatory \nand discriminatory animus, including their characterizations of Plaintiffs’ members \n \n18 Act § 3 (adding § 287.137(2)(a)-(b)). \n  -11-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 12 of 70\n \n \nas part of “leftist media” that are advancing a supposedly “dominant Silicon Valley \nideology.”19   \n10.  The Act is also unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.  It fails to \ndefine with sufficient definiteness what conduct is punishable.  It sets nebulous \nstandards for enforcement that encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement \nof the law.  And its astronomical fines and punitive damages for violations of these \nopaque provisions will inevitably chill constitutionally protected practices and the \navailability of protected expression.20    \n11.  The Act exceeds the limitations on state authority under federal law by \nseeking  to  regulate  wholly  extraterritorial  conduct  in  ways  prohibited  by  the \nConstitution’s Commerce and Due Process Clauses. First, the Act impermissibly \nengages in protectionist discrimination against online businesses—and at the same \ntime,  discrimination  in  favor  of  major  Florida-based  businesses  and  Florida \ncandidates.  Second, the Act regulates large swaths of content-moderation decisions \nthat have no meaningful connection to (and indeed nothing at all to do with) the State \nof Florida, based on business operations and transactions conducted outside of \nFlorida.  \n \n19 May 24, 2021 Gov. DeSantis Press Release. \n20 Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(2)), § 4 (adding § 501.2041(6)).  \n  -12-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 13 of 70\n \n \n12.  On top of all these constitutional infirmities, the Act’s restrictions on \ncontent moderation conflict with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, \na federal statute enacted with the specific goal of protecting the decisions of online \nservices from state-based regulation and liability.  As Congress intended, Section \n230 affords online service providers the freedom to make their own decisions about \nwhether and how to restrict objectionable content.21  Because the Act purports to \napply “to the extent not inconsistent with federal law,” including Section 230, its \nlimitations on content moderation are not only preempted by federal law, but also \nrendered unenforceable under the Act itself.  And given the vague sweep of the Act \nand its harsh penalties, its inclusion of a one-line claim that it, in effect, does not do \nany of the things it otherwise purports to do will not avoid its chilling effect on the \nmoderation of content protected by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. \n13.  For all these reasons, and as described further below, Plaintiffs seek \n(1) an order declaring the Act unconstitutional on its face and (2) a preliminary and \npermanent injunction enjoining its enforcement.22   \n \n21 See 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(2), (e)(3). \n22 Plaintiffs separately reserve all rights to challenge the lawfulness of the Act under the Florida \nConstitution in the state courts of Florida.  This Complaint is limited to claims arising under federal \nlaw, and it does not raise issues of state constitutional law. \n  -13-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 14 of 70\n \n \nJurisdiction \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction over this federal civil rights action under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 because the claims in this action arise under the U.S. Constitution and \nfederal law.  Plaintiffs’ claims arise under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, \nand seek to invalidate certain provisions of the Act based on federal preemption \nunder the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.   \n15.  This Court has authority to grant relief under the Declaratory Judgment \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202, and the Civil Rights Act, 28 U.S.C. 1343(a), 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983.  \n16.  In addition, this Court has authority to issue injunctive relief under the \nAll Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. \n17.  This Court’s jurisdiction is properly exercised over the Defendants in \ntheir official capacities, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), as Plaintiffs are \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  \n18.  There  is  an  actual  controversy  of  sufficient  immediacy  and \nconcreteness relating to the legal rights and duties of Plaintiffs’ members to warrant \nrelief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202.  The harm to Plaintiffs’ \nmembers as a direct result of the actions and threatened actions of Defendants is \nsufficiently real and imminent to warrant the issuance of a conclusive declaratory \njudgment and prospective injunctive relief. \n  -14-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 15 of 70\n \n \n19.  The restrictive and discriminatory provisions of the Act will become \nlaw effective July 1, 2021.

See  Act  §  4  (adding \n§ 501.2041(1)(g)).  Accordingly, the members have standing to challenge the Act. \n23.  In addition, the Act’s Moderation Restrictions compel members to host \ncontent or speakers contrary to their policies and community standards, require that \nthey fundamentally change the types of content available on their privately owned \nplatforms, and force them to subject certain of their users and posters to arbitrary \nand  irrational  disfavored  treatment because of the  content- and  speaker- based \nrestrictions that the State of Florida has imposed.  These requirements will have \nlong-term reputational effects on Plaintiffs’ members, which are enduring and thus \nirreparable.  Failure to comply would expose members to severe penalties, including \ncivil and administrative actions by the Attorney General, fines of $250,000 per day \nby the Florida Elections Commission, as well as private rights of action that include \nup to $100,000 in statutory damages per claim, “[a]ctual damages,” “equitable \nrelief,” and potential “punitive damages.”  Id. (adding § 501.2041(6)).  That risk \ncasts  a  serious  chilling  effect  on  activity  protected  by  the  First  Amendment, \nincluding  both  members’  content-moderation  practices  and  their  own  speech \nconcerning user-generated content.   \n24.  Given  the  Act’s  inevitable  and  imminent  impact  on  Plaintiffs’ \nmembers’ ability to engage in their moderation practices consistent with their terms \nof service and community standards, the Act will harm Plaintiffs’ members in \n  -16-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 17 of 70\n \n \nnumerous ways, including by (i) interfering with their content judgments on their \nprivately owned sites, (ii) exposing them to potential liability at the hands of the \nState Attorney General and Florida Elections Commission, (iii) exposing them to \npotential  liability  under  the  new  private  right  of  action  discussed  above, \n(iv) subjecting them to unlawful compelled disclosure of private, competitively \nsensitive and proprietary business information, and (v) making it harder for them to \nprovide high-quality services to their users and customers.  Specifically, the Act \nwould compel Plaintiffs’ members to degrade the services they provide and the \ncontent they host on their private platforms:  the Act requires members to display \nand prioritize user-generated content that runs counter to their terms, policies, and \nbusiness  practices;  content  that  will  likely  offend  and  repel  their  users  and \nadvertisers;  and  even  content  that  is  unlawful,  dangerous  to  public  health  and \nnational security, and grossly inappropriate for younger audiences.   \n25.  In addition, Plaintiffs’ members will be required to expend time and \nsubstantial resources to change the operations of and redesign their privately owned \nservices  and  platforms  to  comply  with  numerous  arbitrary  and  State-mandated \nrequirements.  These include obligations to (i) “[c]ategorize algorithms used for \npost-prioritization and shadow banning,” Act § 4 (adding § 501.2041(2)(f)(1)); \n(ii) develop processes and procedures to track and manage user opt-outs, id. (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(f)(2)); (iii) “allow a user who has been deplatformed to access or \n  -17-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 18 of 70\n \n \nretrieve all of the user’s information, content, material, and data for at least 60 days” \nafter receipt of notice, id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(i)); (iv) “[p]rovide a mechanism \nthat allows a user to request the number of other individual platform participants \nwho  were  provided  or  shown  the  user’s  content  or  posts,”  id.  (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(e)(1)); and (v) “[p]rovide, upon request, a user with the number of \nother  individual  platform  participants  who  were  provided  or  shown  content  or \nposts,” id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(e)(2)).  And if Plaintiffs’ members do not comply \nwith these highly burdensome obligations, they face the imminent threat of massive \npenalties  under  an  unconstitutional  and  federally  preempted  law.    Plaintiffs’ \nmembers will thus suffer an immediate injury or would be threatened by one if the \nAct  were  allowed  to  stand.    Plaintiffs  anticipate  that  their  members  will  face \nenforcement  actions,  brought  by  the  Attorney  General  or  by  private  litigants, \nimmediately after the law goes into effect because they are engaging in and intend \nto continue engaging in moderation activity that is covered by the Act and that the \nAttorney General would likely allege to be a violation of the Act.      \n26.       Because the statute so clearly targets, and was specifically intended \nto target, Plaintiffs’ members and their activities, this fear is well-founded and \ncredible.    The  statements  of  Governor  Ron  DeSantis  and  the  law’s  sponsors \ndemonstrate  that  Defendants  and  the  State  of  Florida  plan  to  target  Plaintiffs’ \nmembers in state proceedings to enforce the Act’s unconstitutional restraint of their \n  -18-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 19 of 70\n \n \neditorial judgment, content-moderation practices, and First Amendment rights.  For \nexample, Governor DeSantis proclaimed in his May 24 press release that “[i]f Big \nTech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant \nSilicon  Valley  ideology,  they  will  now  be  held  accountable.”24    Similarly,  on \nFebruary 2, 2021, Governor DeSantis stated that “if a technology company uses their \ncontent- and user-related algorithms to suppress or prioritize the access of any \ncontent related to a political candidate or cause on the ballot, that company will also \nface daily fines,” and added that “[t]he message is loud and clear: When it comes to \nelections in Florida, Big Tech should stay out of it.”25  Governor DeSantis also \ndeclared that Florida was “going to take aim at those companies,” which include \nPlaintiffs’ members.26    \n27.  Plaintiffs have associational standing to bring this suit on behalf of their \nmembers.  As described above, Plaintiffs’ members have standing to challenge the \nstatute.    See  supra  ¶¶  20-26.    Further,  the  Act  is  fundamentally  at  odds  with \nPlaintiffs’  policy  objectives,  and  challenging  the  Act  is  germane  to  Plaintiffs’ \n \n24 May 24, 2021 Gov.

See supra ¶¶ 32-34.  The claims and relief sought do not require \nproof specific to particular members and, in any event, Plaintiffs are able to provide \nevidence about the Act’s impact on the companies they represent.  The members’ \nindividual participation is thus not required.   \n28.  This  Court’s  immediate  review  of  the  Act’s  constitutionality  is \nnecessary to prevent an imminent infringement of Plaintiffs’ members’ fundamental \nconstitutional rights. \n29.  Under these circumstances, judicial intervention is warranted to resolve \na  genuine  case  or  controversy  within  the  meaning  of  Article  III  of  the  U.S. \nConstitution regarding the constitutionality and legality of the Act. \n30.  A declaration that the Act is unconstitutional and preempted by federal \nlaw would definitively resolve that controversy for the parties. \nVenue \n31.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)-(2).  The \nDefendants are considered to reside in the Northern District of Florida because this \nis where they perform their official duties.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1).  Additionally, \nthe Attorney General of Florida, in her official capacity, regularly conducts business \nand proceedings in her offices in this District, and the events giving rise to Plaintiffs’ \nclaims occurred in this District.  \n  -20-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 21 of 70\n \n \nThe Parties \nPlaintiffs \n32.  Plaintiff NetChoice is a national trade association of online businesses \nwho share the goal of promoting free speech and free enterprise on the Internet.  \nNetChoice is a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.  \n33.  For  over  two  decades,  NetChoice  has  worked  to  promote  online \ncommerce and speech and to increase consumer access and options through the \nInternet, while minimizing burdens on businesses that are making the Internet more \naccessible and useful.    \n34.

Section 4 expressly authorizes the Attorney General to \n“investigate” a “suspect[ed] violation” of that section of the Act and “to bring a civil \nor administrative action under this part.”  Section 3 instructs the Attorney General \nto determine whether “there is probable cause that a person has likely violated the \nunderlying antitrust laws,” and, if so, to initiate procedures for temporarily placing \nthat person on the Antitrust Violator Vendor List.  Defendant Moody is sued for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief in her official capacity as the Attorney General of \nthe State of Florida. \n36.  Defendant Joni Alexis Poitier is a Commissioner of and the Vice Chair \nof the Florida Elections Commission, which is the administrative agency charged \nwith enforcing, among other things, Chapter 106 of Florida’s Election Code and thus \nhas jurisdiction under Florida law to investigate and determine violations of Section \n2 of the Act.27  Section 2 expressly authorizes the Elections Commission to find a \nviolation of subsection (2) of that Section and to assess fines of up to $250,000 per \nday for “deplatforming” a candidate for statewide office, and of $25,000 per day for \n“deplatforming” a candidate for any other office.  Ms. Poitier is sued for declaratory \nand  injunctive  relief  in  her  official  capacity  as  Florida  Elections  Commission \nCommissioner and Vice Chair. \n \n27 The term of service for each of the Commissioners of the Florida Elections Commission has \nexpired.  However, the named individuals are still serving as Commissioners and will continue to \ndo so until Florida’s Governor makes new appointments to their positions.  \n  -22-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 23 of 70\n \n \n37.  Defendant Jason Todd Allen is a Commissioner of the Florida Elections \nCommission, which is the administrative agency charged with enforcing, among \nother things, Chapter 106 of Florida’s Election Code and thus has jurisdiction under \nFlorida law to investigate and determine violations of Section 2 of the Act.  Mr. \nAllen is sued for declaratory and injunctive relief in his official capacity as Florida \nElection Commissions Commissioner.  \n38.  Defendant  John  Martin  Hayes  is  a  Commissioner  of  the  Florida \nElections Commission, which is the administrative agency charged with enforcing, \namong other things, Chapter 106 of Florida’s Election Code and thus has jurisdiction \nunder Florida law to investigate and determine violations of Section 2 of the Act.  \nMr. Hayes is sued for declaratory and injunctive relief in his official capacity as \nFlorida Elections Commission Commissioner.   \n39.  Defendant Kymberlee Curry Smith is a Commissioner of the Florida \nElections Commission, which is the administrative agency charged with enforcing, \namong other things, Chapter 106 of Florida’s Election Code and thus has jurisdiction \nunder Florida law to investigate and determine violations of Section 2 of the Act.  \nMs. Smith is sued for declaratory and injunctive relief in her official capacity as \nFlorida Elections Commission Commissioner.   \n40.  Defendant  Patrick  Gillespie  is  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  Business \nOperations of the Florida Department of Management Services (the “Department”).  \n  -23-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 24 of 70\n \n \nUnder Florida law, the Department is responsible for developing and overseeing the \nprocedures  under  which  the  State  and  its  agencies  purchase  commodities  and \nservices.  The Act tasks the Department and the Deputy Secretary with enforcing \nSection 3 of the Act by, among other things, creating and maintaining the “Antitrust \nViolator Vendor List.”  In February 2021, the Secretary of the Department resigned, \nand Governor DeSantis has not appointed a replacement.  Accordingly, Deputy \nSecretary Gillespie is currently responsible for enforcing Section 3 of the Act.   \n41.  The above-identified Defendants (collectively, the “Defendants”) are \ncharged with enforcing the provisions of the Act challenged by this action.  The \nDefendants have the authority under the Act to investigate, fine, and otherwise \npenalize Plaintiffs’ members for exercising their constitutional rights under the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.   \n42.  The Defendants are charged to act—and would continue to act if not \nenjoined—under color of state law. \n43.  Plaintiffs sue the Defendants here in their official capacities to prevent \nimminent violations of the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs’ members.  \nPlaintiffs’ Members Engage In Beneficial Content Moderation That Is \nDirectly Restricted By The Act  \n44.  Plaintiffs’ members operate online services that host and publish an \nenormous amount and variety of user-generated content, including text, videos, \naudio clips, and photographs.  The material that is uploaded to these services comes \n  -24-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 25 of 70\n \n \nfrom  all  over  the  world  and  is  unfathomably  diverse.    These  online  services \nshowcase the best of human thought:  material that is endlessly creative, humorous, \nintellectually  stimulating,  educational,  and  politically  engaging.    Unfortunately, \nhowever, some of the material submitted to these services is none of these things.  \nThe openness of the Internet is a magnet for some of the best and worst aspects of \nhumanity, and any online service that allows users to easily upload material will find \nsome of its users attempting to post highly offensive, dangerous, illegal, or simply \nunwanted content.  This content may be problematic in a variety of ways, including \n(among  other  things)  featuring  hardcore  and  illegal  “revenge”  pornography, \ndepictions of child sexual abuse, terrorist propaganda, efforts by foreign adversaries \nto foment violence and manipulate American elections, efforts to spread white \nsupremacist and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, misinformation disseminated by \nbot networks, fraudulent schemes, malicious efforts to spread computer viruses or \nsteal people’s personal information, spam, virulent racist or sexist attacks, death \nthreats, attempts to encourage suicide and self-harm, efforts to sell illegal weapons \nand drugs, pirated material that violates intellectual property rights, and false and \ndefamatory statements.    \n45.  Without serious and sustained effort by online services to stop, limit, \nand control such content—and the people or entities who seek to disseminate it—\n  -25-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 26 of 70\n \n \nthese services could be flooded with abusive and objectionable material, drowning \nout the good content and making their services far less enjoyable, useful, and safe.  \n46.  That  is  why  Plaintiffs’  online  service  members—and  nearly  every \nonline  service  that  is  open  to  hosting  user-generated  content—have  rules  and \npolicies setting out what content and activities are, and are not, permitted on their \nservices.  And it is why those services devote enormous amounts of time, resources, \npersonnel, and effort to engaging in content moderation.  As is clear from the above \ndiscussion of their moderation practices, Plaintiffs’ members make individualized \ndecisions and do not serve the public indiscriminately.  They are private speech \nforums operated by private companies that “exercise editorial control over speech \nand speakers on their properties or platforms.”  Manhattan Community Access Corp., \n139 S. Ct. at 1932.       \n47.  Content moderation can take many different forms, involving both \nhuman review and algorithmic or other automated moderation tools.  Sometimes, \ncontent  moderation  involves  removing  objectionable  or  unlawful  content  or \nterminating the accounts of users who post such material.  Sometimes it is more \nnuanced, involving decisions about how to arrange and display content, what content \nto recommend to users based on their interests, and how easy or difficult it should \nbe to find or search for certain kinds of content.  Content moderation sometimes can \ntake  the  form  of  “zoning”  or  “age-gating,”  whereby  certain  content  is  made \n  -26-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 27 of 70\n \n \naccessible to adults but not minors, or to teenagers but not younger children.  In other \ninstances, content moderation involves empowering users with tools so they can \ndecide for themselves what content to avoid, such as by blocking or muting others, \nmaking certain content inaccessible to their children, or opting into special sections \nof  an  online  service  that  exclude  material  likely  to  offend  or  upset  especially \nsensitive users.  Content moderation can also involve direct speech by service \nproviders themselves, in the form of warning labels, disclaimers, or commentary \nappended  to  certain  user-submitted  material.    For  example,  an  online  service \nprovider might inform users that the relevant content was posted by a hostile foreign \ngovernment, that it has not been verified by official sources, that the information has \nbeen found to be false, or that it contains sensitive or potentially upsetting imagery \nthat is not appropriate for everyone.  It would then be up to the user to decide whether \nto review the content.  Content moderation is even necessary for the most basic \nonline functions that users may take for granted, like searching for local businesses, \nmovie  showtimes,  or  weather  reports.    Without  organizing  and  curating  the \nunfathomable volume of online content, online services would have no way to \nidentify and deliver to users the content that they want—or may critically need—to \nsee. \n48.   Content moderation, in these myriad forms, serves many significant \nfunctions.  First, it is the means by which the online service expresses itself.  Just as \n  -27-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 28 of 70\n \n \na newspaper or magazine has the freedom to choose a cover story, leave out certain \nletters to the editor, or ban profanity from its pages, an online service performs the \nsame curation function according to its terms and policies.  At the same time, a \nservice’s policies concern more than just what is does or does not publish:  they \ninfluence the kind of online community, environment, and atmosphere that users \nexperience.  A website aiming to be family-friendly, for example, cannot produce \nthat experience for its users if it is prevented from limiting or removing graphic or \nviscerally  offensive posts.    Content  moderation  thus goes  to  the heart of their \neditorial judgment, just as it does when a newspaper like the Miami Herald decides \nwhether to publish a letter to the editor. \n49.  Second,  moderating  content  on  services  open  to  billions  of  users, \nincluding families and children, is essential to ensure safer communities online.  For \ninstance,  restricting  access  for  younger  users  to  adult  content  is  analogous  to \napplying age-based ratings to movies or scheduling mature programming for later \nhours.    To  constrain  how  the  online  service  can  manage  offensive  content, \nconspiracy theories, incitements to violence, and other egregious forms of content is \nto require them, against their will, to offer their virtual tools and space for unintended \nuses that endanger the public.  \n50.  Third,  aside  from  public  safety,  State-mandated  controls  on  how \nplatforms must permit, organize, and present content also renders an online service \n  -28-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 29 of 70\n \n \nless useful and undermines Plaintiffs’ members’ core business models.  Imagine if a \nsearch engine or social media company returned its results in a random or purely \nchronological order instead of prioritizing what is most helpful or relevant to the \nuser based on her own activities and demonstrated preferences.  As a result, the user \nmight miss content from her close friends and family and instead see a slew of more \nrecent, but less relevant content.  Or imagine if an e-commerce website presented a \nrandom assortment of products or listings instead of those for which the user is \nsearching.  The main value many online services offer is curating, sorting, and \ndisplaying the vast amount of information available online.         \n51.  Florida’s Act directly targets—and would profoundly disrupt—these \nvital,  and  constitutionally  protected,  content  moderation  efforts.    As  discussed \nbelow, the Act’s expansive restrictions constrain and burden nearly every type of \ncontent moderation activity that is critical to online services’ ability to express their \neditorial judgments; protect users from offensive, harmful or dangerous material; \nand provide useful online tools on which billions of people rely every day.  The Act \napplies not merely to decisions removing content or users from a service.  It equally \ncovers—in some instances outright prohibits—more fine-grained approaches, such \nas limiting the exposure of younger or more sensitive users to potentially upsetting \ncontent.  The Act goes so far as to control how the services can use automated \nprocesses like algorithms to arrange and curate content, and it seeks to limit these \n  -29-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 30 of 70\n \n \nservices’ own direct speech by prohibiting them from posting warning labels or \ncommentary.  In short, the Act subjects nearly every content-moderation judgment \na covered service might make to the State’s  regulatory control, saddling those \njudgments  with  burdensome  new  obligations,  restrictions,  and  the  ever-present \nthreat of government or private enforcement action.  The Act thus threatens not just \nthe types of experience and community those services can offer, but also how they \nfundamentally operate.  \nFlorida’s Unconstitutional Act  \n52.  The Act was enacted by the Florida Legislature on May 2, 2021, signed \ninto law by Governor DeSantis on May 24, 2021, and goes into effect on July 1, \n2021.  Act § 7.  \n53.  The Act’s legislative history, as well as public statements by state \nlegislators and public officials, make clear that the Act was motivated by animus \ntoward popular technology companies—animus specifically driven by disapproval \nof the companies’ perceived political and other viewpoints.  See supra ¶¶ 3-4.  One \nof the Act’s sponsors declared during the signing ceremony, “[D]o not think a \nhandful of kids behind a desk in Silicon Valley get to be the arbiter of what free \nspeech is … it’s about time someone took them head on.”28  Lieutenant Governor \n \n28  Governor  Ron  DeSantis  press  conference  in  Miami,  YouTube  (May  24,  2021), \nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=O67BF-2IWiY, at 18:08 (last accessed May 26, 2021) (statement of \nRep.

This animus toward disfavored online businesses is well documented \nin the public record.  When discussing the proposed legislation in February 2021, \nGovernor DeSantis described online businesses targeted by the Act as “big brother,” \nbecause of his stated view that these companies are “tougher on those on the political \nright than left.”31  Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Chris Sprowls, \nhas expressed similar sentiments.32  \ni.  “Social Media Platforms” \n55.  The Act targets various online businesses (including operators of social \nmedia  platforms,  search  engines,  and  online  marketplaces)  that  the  Florida \nLegislature sweeps under the misleading term, “social media platforms.”   \n56.  Consistent with the legislative history described above, the Act was \ndrafted to target popular technology companies, while carving out Florida-based \n \n29 May 24, 2021 Gov.

Nothing in the Act, including the \nlegislative findings, explains how or why the perceived problems that the statute \nsupposedly addresses is limited to these entities.  \n57.  For openly protectionist reasons, the Act excludes companies that are \npolitically influential in Florida from its definition of “social media platform,” even \nwhen  those  companies  operate  online  services  that  would  otherwise  meet  the \nstatutory definition.  The Act carves out companies that own and operate well-\nattended theme parks—an exemption that conveniently covers Disney and Universal \nStudios (owned by Comcast Corporation).33  No legitimate government interest \n \n33 Under the law, “social media platform” does not include any “information service, system, \nInternet search engine, or access software provider operated by a company that owns and operates \na  theme  park  or  entertainment  complex  as  defined  in  s.  509.013.”    Act  §  4  (adding \n§ 501.2041(1)(g)).    \n  -32-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 33 of 70\n \n \ncould be advanced by such an exemption, nor was any such interest identified.  \nRather, as one of the law’s sponsors remarked, the exemption was added with the \nundisguised  objective  of  ensuring  that  certain  companies  with  big  economic \nfootprints in Florida—like Disney—are not “caught up in this.”34  The decision to \nexempt those major companies confirms that the law’s true objective is to control \nthe private speech of politically disfavored companies who have online platforms, \nbut not to control the speech of similarly situated but politically favored companies \nwith power and influence in the State of Florida.  \n58.  As explained above (see supra ¶¶ 20-22 & n.23), several of Plaintiffs’ \nmembers fall within the statutory definition of “social media platform,” and do not \n“own and operate a theme park or entertainment complex.”        \n59.  The Act infringes on the rights of Plaintiffs’ members in numerous \nways.  Key provisions of the Act are summarized below.   \nii.  Ban on Restricting Postings by Candidates (Section 2)  \n60.  Section  2  of  the  Act  prohibits  any  “social  media  platform”  from \n“willfully deplatforming a candidate for office who is known by the social media \nplatform to be a candidate, beginning on the date of qualification and ending on the \n \n34  Jim  Saunders,  Florida’s ‘Big  Tech’ crackdown  bill  goes  to  DeSantis,  but  with  a  special \nexemption for Disney, CL Tampa Bay (Apr. 30, 2021), www.cltampa.com/news-views/florida-\nnews/article/21151908/floridas-big-tech-crackdown-bill-goes-to-desantis-but-with-a-special-\nexemption-for-disney (last accessed May 26, 2021).   \n  -33-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 34 of 70\n \n \ndate of the election or the date the candidate ceases to be a candidate.”  Act § 2 \n(adding § 106.072(2)).  Section 2 further requires covered online businesses to \n“provide each user a method by which the user may be identified as a qualified \ncandidate and which provides sufficient information to allow the platform to confirm \nthe user’s qualifications.”  Id.  \n61.  Under the Act, “deplatform” is broadly defined to mean the “action or \npractice by a social media  platform to permanently delete or ban a user or to \ntemporarily delete or ban a user from the social media platform for more than 14 \ndays.”  Act § 4 (adding § 501.2041(1)(c)); cf. Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(1)(b)). \n62.  The Act inexplicably contains exemptions that allow online businesses \nto favor paid content by third parties or candidates over unpaid content—seemingly \nin violation of the “post-prioritization” and “shadow banning” prohibitions.  Act § 4 \n(adding § 501.2041(1)(e)-(f), (2)(d)). \n63.  The  Florida  Elections  Commission  is  vested  with  jurisdiction  to \ndetermine whether Section 2 has been violated, and to impose fines as high as \n$250,000  per  day  for  violations  involving  candidates  for  statewide office  (and \n$25,000 per day for candidates for other offices).  Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(3)). \n64.  The Act provides that Section 2 may not be enforced if it is inconsistent \nwith federal law or 47 U.S.C. 230(e)(3).  Id. (adding § 106.072(5)).  Section 2 is \n  -34-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 35 of 70\n \n \ninconsistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and \nother federal law, for the reasons explained below.  \niii.  Additional Moderation Restrictions (Section 4) \n65.  Section 4 of the Act is a frontal attack on the constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs’  members  to  make  editorial  judgments  about  speech  hosted  on  their \nproperty.  It directly restricts and burdens the content moderation judgments of \ncovered online businesses.  In particular, Section 4 enacts restrictions that effectively \nban most, if not all, moderation of content posted “by or about” political candidates.  \nAnd it severely restricts and burdens moderation practices with respect to postings \nor  content  from  a  loosely defined  category  of  “journalistic  enterprises.”  These \nprovisions  compel  a  disfavored  group  of  private  businesses  to  host—and \ndramatically limit their ability to restrict, decide how to display, or even offer their \nown commentary on—highly objectionable or even illegal content, such as sexually \nexplicit material, user posts that incite or glorify violence and acts of terrorism, \nonline harassment and bullying, anti-Semitic and racist hate speech, defamation, and \nmisinformation (such as hoaxes involving public health issues).   \n66.  Section  4  also  imposes  on  covered  online  businesses  a  broad,  but \nwholly undefined, mandate to apply any possible editorial judgments they might \nmake about the virtually unlimited amount of content they host “in a consistent \nmanner among [their] users”—an obligation that is all but impossible to understand, \n  -35-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 36 of 70\n \n \nmuch less comply with.  And Section 4 imposes onerous notice and other affirmative \nrequirements regarding the editorial judgments made by these businesses.  The \nnotice  requirements  are  particularly  burdensome  and  problematic  because  by \nprescribing specific disclosures about the reason for the removal of virtually any \ncategory of content, covered online businesses would be providing a host of bad-\nfaith actors (from terrorists to hostile foreign governments and spammers) a roadmap \nfor  how  to  post  unwanted,  harmful  content  by  circumventing  the  protections \ncurrently in place.   \n67.  In  sum,  Section  4  impermissibly  subordinates  covered  businesses’ \njudgments about what content to display on their services and in what manner to the \nState’s fiat.  This is the modern-day equivalent of the unconstitutional attempt to \nforce the Miami Herald to publish a letter affording a “right of reply,” which the \nSupreme Court soundly rejected in Tornillo.  And it is eerily reminiscent of efforts \nby authoritarian regimes around the world to control private online services and \nforce them to conform to a state-approved message.  As just one example, Human \nRights  Watch  has  noted  Russia’s  enactment  of  “increasingly  oppressive”  laws \ntargeting  social  media  platforms  that  “forc[e]  them”  to  alter  their  moderation \npractices  concerning  “online  content  deemed  illegal  by  the  government.”35  A \n \n35 See Russia: Social Media Pressured to Censor Posts, Human Rights Watch (Feb. 5, 2021), \nwww.hrw.org/news/2021/02/05/russia-social-media-pressured-censor-posts  (last  accessed  May \n \n  -36-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 37 of 70\n \n \nRussian  bill  currently  under  consideration  “proposes  fines  for  social  media \ncompanies that ‘illegally block users,’” and “aims to prevent the potential blocking \nof Russian politicians’ social media profiles.”36   \n68.  Section 4 specifically delineates a list of “[u]nlawful acts and practices \nby social media platforms,” Act § 4 (adding § 501.2041), all of which seek to deprive \ncovered online businesses of their editorial discretion and replace it with state-\ncompelled  speech  by  prohibiting  numerous  activities  protected  by  the  First \nAmendment.  For example: \na.  Covered online businesses must not edit the content of a “journalistic \nenterprise,”  “post  an  addendum  to”  any  content  of  such  an  enterprise,  or \n“deplatform” the enterprise based on “the content of its publication or broadcast.”  \nId. (adding § 501.2041(2)(j), (1)(b)).37  A “journalistic enterprise” is broadly \n \n26, 2021).  For instance, one recently enacted law “empower[s] the authorities to block websites” \nthat restrict access to “Russian state media content.”  Id. \n36 Id.; see also Adam Satariano & Oleg Matsnev, Russia Raises Heat on Twitter, Google and \nFacebook in Online Crackdown, N.Y. Times (May 26, 2021), www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/\ntechnology/russia-twitter-google-facebook-censorship.html (last accessed May 26, 2021). \n37 While “censorship” is traditionally used to refer to the actions of government officials to limit \nfree expression, the Act uses the misleading scare-terms “censorship” and “shadow banning” to \ncover routine moderation practices, such as editing objectionable content.  See Act § 4 (adding \n§ 501.2041(1)(b) (defining “censor” as “any action taken by a social media platform to delete, \nregulate, restrict, edit, alter, inhibit the publication or republication of, suspend a right to post, \nremove, or post an addendum to any content or material posted by a user.  The term also includes \nactions to inhibit the ability of a user to be viewable by or to interact with another user of the social \nmedia platform.”); see also id. (adding § 501.2041(1)(f)) (defining “shadow ban” as “action by a \nsocial media platform, through any means, whether the action is determined by a natural person or \nan algorithm, to limit or eliminate the exposure of a user or content or material posted by a user to \nother users of the social media platform.”).  Under these definitions, a decision that sexually \n \n  -37-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 38 of 70\n \n \ndefined as “an entity doing business in Florida” that (1) publishes more than \n100,000  words  online  and  has  at  least  50,000  paid  subscribers  or  100,000 \nmonthly active users; (2) publishes online at least 100 hours of audio or video \nand has at least 100 million viewers annually; (3) “operates a cable channel that \nprovides more than 40 hours of content per week to more than 100,000 cable \ntelevision subscribers”; or (4) “[o]perates under a broadcast license issued by the \nFederal Communications Commission.”  Id. (adding § 501.2041(1)(d)).  This \nsweeping definition would shield many outlets that publish foreign propaganda \nand conspiracy theories.   \nb.  Covered online businesses must not use any algorithms to curate and \narrange “content and material posted by or about” a candidate.  Id. (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(h)) (characterizing actions as “post-prioritization” and “shadow \nbanning”). \nc.  Covered  online  businesses  must  not  edit  a  user’s  content  or \n“deplatform” the user, unless the social media platform gives the user detailed \nwritten notice, including “a thorough rationale” justifying such actions, a “precise \nand thorough explanation of how the social media platform became aware of the \ncensored content or material, including a thorough explanation of the algorithms \n \nexplicit or violent content should be restricted to users above the age of 18 would potentially \nconstitute forbidden “shadow banning.”   \n  -38-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 39 of 70\n \n \nused, if any, to identify or flag the user’s content or material as objectionable.”  \nId. (adding § 501.2041(2)(d), (3)) (characterizing actions as “censoring” and \n“shadow banning”).  This obligation to thoroughly justify content  decisions \napplies even if the online business takes action to protect its users from highly \nobjectionable material posted by terrorist groups or hostile foreign governments.  \nd.  Covered  online  businesses  must  not  use  algorithms  that  arrange \ncontent  other than in chronological order if the user has opted  out of such \nalgorithms  under  the  mandatory  opt-out  provision.    Id.  (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(f)(2)). \ne.  Covered online businesses must not change editorial policies more \nthan once every 30 days, even if responding to new and changed circumstances \nand threats.  Id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(c)). \n69.  Section  4  also  includes  the  vague  mandate  that  these  censorship, \ndeplatforming, and shadow banning standards be implemented in a “consistent \nmanner” among users on the platform.  Act § 4 (adding § 501.2041(2)(b)).  This \nsubjective standard is not defined in the Act and may serve as the basis for a private \ncause  of  action  by  users  with  statutory  damages  of  $100,000  per  day,  actual \ndamages,  and  “punitive”  damages.    Id.  (adding  § 501.2041(6)).    The  Act  also \nincludes the vague requirement that covered websites must “[c]ategorize algorithms \nused for post-prioritization and shadow banning.”  Id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(f)(1)).  \n  -39-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 40 of 70\n \n \nSimilarly  vague  is  the  requirement  that  covered  online  businesses  “inform”  a \ncandidate if they have “willfully provide[d] free advertising for” the candidate, in \nwhich case the Act treats this “free advertising” (an undefined concept) as an “in-\nkind  contribution”  for  purposes  of  Florida’s  election  laws.    Act  §  2  (adding \n§ 106.072(4)).38  \n70.  In addition, the Act places numerous affirmative burdens on covered \nonline businesses to: \na.  “inform each user about any changes to its user rules, terms, and \nagreements before implementing the changes” (in addition to the ban on changes \nmore frequent than once a month).  Id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(c)). \nb.  “provide users with an annual notice on the use of algorithms for \npost-prioritization  and  shadow  banning  and  reoffer  annually  the  opt-out \nopportunity in subparagraph (f)2.”  Id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(g)).  \nc.  “allow a user who has been deplatformed to access or retrieve all of \nthe user’s information, content, material, and data for at least 60 days after the \nuser  receives  the  notice  required  under  subparagraph  (d)1.”    Id.  (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(i)). \n \n38 The Act merely states that certain things will not be deemed free advertising, without specifying \nwhat will be considered to fall within that category.  See id. (“Posts, content, material, and \ncomments by candidates which are shown on the platform in the same or similar way as other \nusers’ posts, content, material, and comments are not considered free advertising.”).  \n  -40-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 41 of 70\n \n \nd.  “publish the standards, including detailed definitions, it uses or has \nused for determining how to censor, deplatform, and shadow ban.”  Id. (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(a)).  \ne.  “provide a mechanism that allows a user to request the number of \nother individual platform participants who were provided or shown the user’s \ncontent or posts.”  Id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(e)(1)). \nf.  “[p]rovide, upon request, a user with the number of other individual \nplatform participants who were provided or shown content or posts.”  Id. (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(e)(2)). \n71.  A covered online business that fails to comply with Section 4 is deemed \nto  have  committed  “an  unfair  or  deceptive  act  or  practice  as  specified  in \n[§] 501.204,” and is subject to an investigation by the Department of Legal Affairs \nand civil or administrative enforcement action.  Id. (adding § 501.2041(5)).  The Act \nalso empowers the State to use its subpoena power to intrusively investigate the \nhighly confidential and competitively sensitive methodologies online companies use \nto exercise their content judgment.  Id. (adding § 501.2041(8)).  Finally, the Act \ncreates a private right of action against any platform that (i) applies its “censorship, \ndeplatforming,  and  shadow  standards  in  an  [in]consistent  way,”  or  that \n(ii) “censor[s] or shadow ban[s] a user’s content or material” without giving written \nnotice of its reasons for doing so.  Id. (adding § 501.2041(6)). \n  -41-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 42 of 70\n \n \niv.  Antitrust Blacklist (Section 3) \n72.  Section 3 of the Act creates a new statutory provision, F.S. § 287.137, \nthat imposes state contracting restrictions for covered online businesses that are \nalleged to have violated antitrust laws and placed on a newly established “Antitrust \nViolator Vendor List.”  Act § 3 (adding § 287.137(2)(a)-(b)).  The targeted “social \nmedia platforms” are the only businesses that may be placed on the antitrust vendor \nlist.  Id. (adding § 287.137(1)(b), (1)(f)).   Again, other large businesses—including \nthe favored theme-park owners—are exempted.  \n73.  Section 3 is another example of the Act’s irrational targeting of a select, \ndisfavored  group  of  online  businesses.    Although  federal  antitrust  laws—and \nFlorida’s  counterpart  statutes—apply  across  different  industries,  Section  3 \nirrationally singles out only the defined “social media platforms” for disfavored \ntreatment  because  of  their  role  in  hosting  and  moderating  online  content.    Id.   \nSection  3  establishes  an  “Antitrust  Violator  Vendor  List”  of  companies  and \nindividuals subject to an absolute contracting bar with the State of Florida.  Id. \n(adding § 287.137(3)(b)).  These persons and affiliates are also prohibited from \nreceiving “economic incentives” such as “state grants, cash grants, tax exemptions, \ntax refunds, tax credits, state funds, and other state incentives” under Florida law.  \nId. (adding § 287.137(5)). \n  -42-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 43 of 70\n \n \n74.  The Antitrust Violator Vendor List may include those merely “accused \nof” violations by the Florida “Attorney General,” “a state attorney,” or federal \nauthorities (subject to a cumbersome and inadequate process for contesting the \nAttorney General’s decision before a state administrative law judge).  The Act \nempowers the Florida Attorney General to place an accused company “temporarily” \non the Antitrust Violator Vendor List upon a finding of mere “probable cause that a \nperson  has  likely  violated  the  underlying  antitrust  laws.”    Id.  (adding \n§ 287.137(3)(d)(1)).  The absolute state contracting bar extends to an ill-defined \ngroup  of  officers,  directors,  shareholders,  and  even  employees  involved  in \n“management”  of  a company placed on the List,  as well as  a  broad group  of \n“affiliates” of companies that are permanently placed on the List.   Id. (adding \n§ 287.137(1)(a), (f)-(g)).    \n*  *  * \n75.  The Act is a smorgasbord of constitutional violations.  Sections 2, 3, \nand  4—specifically,  those  provisions  adding  F.S.  §§  106.072,  287.137  and \n510.2041(2)(a)-(j)—violate the First Amendment, due process, and equal protection \nprinciples, and run afoul of the Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause. \n  -43-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 44 of 70\n \n \nCOUNT I \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \nViolation of Free Speech and Free Press Rights Under the First and \nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States  \n(Challenge to Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act) \n(As to All Defendants) \n \n76.

Sections 2 and 4 of the Act—specifically, those sections adding F.S. \n§§ 106.072 and 510.2041(2)(a)-(j)—violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \nAs  discussed  above,  in  numerous,  interrelated  ways,  all  of  the  Moderation \nRestrictions,  as  well  as  the  affirmative  obligations  discussed  above,39  impose \ncontent-based,  viewpoint-based,  and  speaker-based  restrictions  and  burdens  on \ncovered online businesses’ speech rights and editorial judgment entitled to full First \n \n39 This includes the requirements to (i) “inform” a candidate if the covered online business \n“willfully provide[d] free advertising for” the candidate, Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(4)); (ii) provide \nusers with a “a thorough rationale explaining the reason” for a covered online business’ moderation \ndecision, including a “precise and thorough explanation of how the [business] became aware of \nthe … content or material” and “a thorough explanation of the algorithms used, if any, to identify \nor  flag  the  user’s  content  or  material  as  objectionable,”  Act  §  4  (adding  §  501.2041(3)); \n(iii) “inform  each  user  about  any  changes  to  its  user  rules,  terms,  and  agreements  before \nimplementing the changes,” id.

These provisions also unconstitutionally compel covered \nonline  businesses  to  speak  in  ways  that  significantly  burden  and  chill  their \nconstitutionally protected content judgments and speech.  In addition, the provisions \nlack  the  scienter  requirements  that  the  First  Amendment  demands,  effectively \nimposing  a  set  of  strict-liability  speech  bans  and  mandates.    Separately  and \ncollectively, these provisions single out the covered online businesses for disfavored \ntreatment.  Because Sections 2 and 4 restrict speech based on its content and based \non  its  speaker,  they  are  subject  to  strict  scrutiny  and  are  presumptively \nunconstitutional.  Further, the Act authorizes the State to engage in highly intrusive \ninvestigations of content moderation processes and judgments, separately burdening \nspeech.  Because the State has no legitimate (much less compelling) governmental \ninterest that supports these provisions, and because none of the provisions  are \nnarrowly tailored, they do not survive strict scrutiny.  Indeed, they would fail under \nany standard of review.  \n78.  Plaintiffs’ members include online businesses subject to the Act.  They \nare private companies that have the right to choose what content they host on their \nplatforms  and  how  to  arrange,  display,  organize,  and  curate  such  content, \nirrespective of the platforms’ popularity.  The operative provisions of Sections 2 and \n4 of the Act violate those rights. \n  -45-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 46 of 70\n \n \n79.  Government action that compels speech by forcing a private social \nmedia platform to carry content that is against its policies or preferences violates the \nFirst Amendment.   \n80.  The First Amendment is not limited to traditional forms of media and \nexpression,  but  applies  with  equal  force  to  modern  media,  technology,  and \ncommunications.  Online businesses that make editorial decisions regarding what \ncontent to publish, including content created or posted by third parties, engage in \nspeech that is fully protected by the First Amendment.  Reno v. Am. Civil Liberties \nUnion, 521 U.S. 844, 870 (1997).   \n81.  In  addition  to  prohibiting  the  government  from  directly  restricting \nspeech, the First Amendment prohibits the government from compelling a person or \nbusiness to communicate a message (including host a third party’s message).  In \nother words, it “prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.”  \nRumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Inst. Rights, 547 U.S. 47, 61 (2006).  A State may \nnot require an online or other business to host or promote another’s speech unless it \nmeets the extraordinarily demanding standard of “strict scrutiny.”  Riley v.

A compelled-speech edict is presumptively invalid unless the State can \nshow  that  its  regulation  is  necessary  to  advance  a  “compelling”  governmental \ninterest, is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, and is the least restrictive means \n  -46-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 47 of 70\n \n \navailable for establishing that interest.  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 \n(2015); United States v. Playboy Entm’t Grp., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).  Unless a \nState can satisfy this extremely demanding standard, it may not interfere with a \nprivate company’s choices about what to say or not to say, and what content to \ndistribute or not to distribute.  See, e.g., Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  These settled \nprinciples apply with full force to protect the rights of online businesses, including \n“social media platforms” as defined in the Act.  \n83.  Laws that regulate speech (1) based on its content or (2) based on the \nidentity  of  the  speaker  are  presumptively  unconstitutional  under  the  First \nAmendment.  Reed, 576 U.S. at 163, 170.  Moreover, “[w]hen the government \ntargets not subject matter, but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the \nviolation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant.  Viewpoint discrimination \nis thus an egregious form of content discrimination.  The government must abstain \nfrom regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or \nperspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.”  Rosenberger v. Rector \nand Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995). \n84.  Further, where, as here, a regulation elevates certain speakers over \nothers and disfavors the latter, it “suggests that the goal of the regulation is not \nunrelated  to  suppression  of  expression,  and  such  a  goal  is  presumptively \n  -47-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 48 of 70\n \n \nunconstitutional.”  Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co., 460 U.S. 575, 585, 592–93 \n(1983); Arkansas Writers’ Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221 (1987).  \n85.  Content-based, viewpoint-based, and speaker-based discrimination can \nbe discerned from both the text of the statute and evidence of the State’s purposes in \nenacting the statute.  Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 564–65 (2011).  Thus, \nwhere, as here (see supra ¶¶ 3-4, 53), a statute is animated by a desire to target \nselected speakers for disfavored treatment, and especially where the motive is to \npunish or retaliate against private parties for their perceived political or ideological \nviewpoints, evidence of that improper motive can further confirm that the statute \namounts to impermissible speech regulation.  Sorrell, 564 U.S. at 564–65. \n86.  First Amendment rights “‘are protected not only against heavy-handed \nfrontal attack, but also from . . . more subtle governmental interference.’”  Gibson v. \nFla. Legislative Investigation Comm., 372 U.S. 539, 544 (1963) (citation omitted).  \nThus, a requirement that a company publish and disclose the rationale, processes, \ndata,  or  methods  concerning  its  editorial  decisions  runs  afoul  of  the  First \nAmendment.  United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 57 (1953) (Douglas, J., joined \nby Black, J., concurring).  “It is the presence of compulsion from the state itself that \ncompromises the First Amendment,” which “extends ‘not only to expressions of \nvalue, opinion, or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the speaker would \nrather avoid.’” Washington Post v. McManus, 944 F.3d 506, 518 (4th Cir. 2019) \n  -48-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 49 of 70\n \n \n(quoting Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Grp. of Boston, 515 \nU.S. 557, 570 (1995)).   \n87.  These principles—both collectively and individually—establish that \nSections 2 and 4 of the Act violate the First Amendment. \n88.  Sections 2 and 4 force covered online businesses to host content they \notherwise would not allow under their policies and standards, or do not wish to \nfeature, organize, display, or prioritize in the way that the Act mandates.  No one, \nnot  even  someone  who  has  paid  a  filing  fee  to  run  for  office,  has  a  First      \nAmendment right to compel a private actor to carry speech on their private property.  \nOn  the contrary, the online businesses subject to the Act  (including Plaintiffs’ \nmembers) have a First Amendment right to free speech—and may therefore decide \nwhom they will and will not host and with which speakers and speech they wish to \nassociate (or not associate). \n89.  Sections 2 and 4 also limit and burden the exercise of covered online \nbusiness’ judgments about the display of content in myriad ways—including, but \nnot limited to, by restricting their ability to (i) edit, remove, organize, de-prioritize, \nor prioritize certain third-party content or postings, (ii) to add commentary on or \nadvisories  or  warnings  to  accompany  such  content  or  postings  (e.g.,  flagging \nunverified factual claims), or (iii) curate or filter content so it is appropriate for \ncertain audiences (e.g., restricting access to adult content based on parental settings).  \n  -49-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 50 of 70\n \n \n90.  Sections 2 and 4 also unconstitutionally restrict, burden, compel, and \notherwise regulate speech based on its content.  These sections reflect legislative \npreferences for certain types of content (i.e., postings by or about political candidates \nand by certain “journalistic enterprises,” as well as paid versus unpaid content).  This \ntriggers strict scrutiny.   \n91.  The Act is also motivated by a viewpoint-based attack on the “social \nmedia platforms” it targets.  As the Act’s champions trumpeted when the bill was \nsigned into law, the core goal of the Act was to punish the targeted companies \nspecifically because the Legislature and Governor dislike the perceived political and \nideological viewpoints that those private businesses supposedly express through \ntheir  content  judgments.    This  is  the  essence  of  impermissible  viewpoint-\ndiscrimination, and it violates the First Amendment.   \n92.  Strict scrutiny also applies on the independent ground that the Act \nengages in speaker-based discrimination and targets a discrete category of speakers \nfor  disfavored  treatment.  The  speech  restrictions  and  compelled-speech \nrequirements under Sections 2 and 4 apply only to covered online businesses that \nqualify as “social media platforms,” but do not apply to (a) non-digital hosts of third-\nparty content with large audiences (such as certain book publishers or hosts of \ntraditional bulletin boards); (b) online businesses that provide the same types of \nservices but do not meet the arbitrary thresholds to qualify as a “social media \n  -50-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 51 of 70\n \n \nplatform” under the Act; and (c) any business that would otherwise be subject to the \nAct  except  that  it  also  happens  to  own  and  operate  a  large  “theme  park  or \nentertainment complex” (defined to include Disney and Universal Studios).  This \nspeaker-based discrimination is also evidenced by the legislative history and public \nrecord discussed above.  \n93.  By forcing covered online businesses to prioritize postings by or about \ncandidates  and  content  from  the  loosely  defined  category  of  “journalistic \nenterprises,” the Act further exacerbates the speaker-based discrimination, including \nin an area (political speech) where the covered online businesses’ First Amendment \nprotections are strongest.   \n94.  The Act compounds these First Amendment violations by authorizing \nthe State to conduct highly intrusive investigations into how the targeted companies \norganize and select content for inclusion on their private platforms, which separately \nburdens First Amendment rights.    \n95.  For  each  of  these  independent  reasons,  Sections  2  and  4  are \npresumptively unconstitutional, and the State bears the burden of establishing that \nthese requirements satisfy strict scrutiny.     \n96.  Section 3—which adds F.S. § 287.137—also violates the First and \nFourteenth  Amendments.    As  discussed  above,  that  section  singles  out  certain \nspeakers  and  online  media  businesses—covered  “social  media  platforms”—for \n  -51-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 52 of 70\n \n \ndiscriminatory treatment, including prohibiting covered entities from contracting \nwith the State and from receiving tax breaks, refunds, and other economic incentives.  \nAnd the Act’s irrational exceptions for favored entities show that “the State has left \nunburdened” other, favored speakers, in violation of the First Amendment.  Nat’l \nInst. of Family & Life Advocs. v. Becerra, 138 S. Ct. 2361, 2378 (2018) (quoting \nSorrell, 564 U.S. at 580).  For each of those reasons, Section 3 is presumptively \nunconstitutional and subject to strict scrutiny. \n97.  Additionally,  as  discussed  above,  Section  3  burdens  “affiliates”  of \ncompanies placed on an antitrust blacklist, where “affiliates” is defined to include \nany entities controlled by agents who are active in the management of the blacklisted \ncompany.  If a company is blacklisted, its affiliates are subject to blacklisting as well, \nand a showing that the entity is an affiliate “constitutes a prima facie case” that \nblacklisting is warranted for the affiliate.  An affiliate on the list may not bid on or \nbe awarded any work under a public contract, or transact business with the State, \nand it may be ineligible for economic incentives.  Section 3’s use of guilt by \nassociation  violates  the  First  Amendment  rights  of  Plaintiffs,  as  well  as  their \naffiliates.  It is not an “appropriate requirement” for the State to require disaffiliation \nin order to access public contracting and benefits. \n98.  The State of Florida’s decision to subject “social media platforms” (as \ndefined  in  the  Act)  to  “differential  treatment,  unless  justified  by  some  special \n  -52-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 53 of 70\n \n \ncharacteristic of [their services], suggests that the goal of the regulation is not \nunrelated  to  suppression  of  expression,  and  such  a  goal  is  presumptively \nunconstitutional.”  Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 585.  Section 3’s imposition of \nnon-generally applicable burdens on “social media platforms,” including Plaintiffs’ \nmembers, is not justified by any special characteristic of their services, and therefore \ntriggers strict scrutiny. \n99.  Sections 2, 3, and 4 do not meet the requisite standard of strict scrutiny \n(and would fail any standard of constitutional review).  \n100.  First, the State cannot show that there is any real problem in need of \nsolving and that these statutory provisions further a “compelling” governmental \ninterest (or even any legitimate governmental interest). \n101.  Second, the State cannot show that Sections 2, 3, and 4 are narrowly \ntailored to meet the State’s asserted interest.  To the contrary, these provisions are \nboth over- and underinclusive in numerous respects.  See supra ¶¶ 56-57.  Among \nother fatal defects, they arbitrarily and punitively target speech by some companies \nwith larger platforms, but not other companies that the Legislature favors. \n102.  Additionally, Section 4 of the Act regulates the speech of covered \nonline businesses without the necessary scienter protections required by the First \nAmendment.  For example, while the Act broadly prohibits covered businesses from \n“deplatforming,” “censoring,” or “shadow banning” a “journalistic enterprise,” there \n  -53-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 54 of 70\n \n \nis no requirement that the business know (or have reason to know) that the content \nat issue was posted by such an enterprise.  Thus, a covered business that removes or \nposts an addendum to a video (even one posted by a propaganda outlet) could be \nheld strictly liable and subject to severe penalties if it turns out that, unbeknownst to \nthe  provider,  the  video  was  posted  by  an  entity  deemed  to  be  a  “journalistic \nenterprise.”  The chilling effect of the lack of a scienter requirement is exacerbated \nby the breadth and vagueness of the Act’s terms.  \n103.  The same is true of the Act’s notice provisions, which apply only where \nactions are taken with respect to a poster or content provider “who resides in or is \ndomiciled in Florida.”  There is no requirement that the covered online business \nknow, or have reason to know, where that person actually lives.  Nor is this residency \ninformation something that many covered online businesses should be expected to \nhave.  As a result, a covered business that takes moderation actions concerning an \naccount could face strict liability if it turns out that, unbeknownst to the business, \nthe person happens to live in Florida.  The First Amendment forbids such strict-\nliability speech regulations. \n104.  Unless they are enjoined, Sections 2, 3, and 4 will operate to unlawfully \ndeprive Plaintiffs’ members of their fundamental First Amendment rights, including \nthe  chilling  of  Plaintiffs’,  their  members’,  and  their  affiliates’  exercise  of \nassociational freedoms. \n  -54-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 55 of 70\n \n \nCOUNT II \n (42 U.S.C. § 1983) \nViolation of Due Process Rights Under the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States  \n(Challenge to Sections 2 and 4 of the Act) \n(As to the Commissioners of the Florida Elections Commission  \nand the Florida Attorney General) \n105.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 to  75 above as if fully \nand separately set forth herein.   \n106.  The U.S. Constitution guarantees all persons the right to due process.  \nU.S. Const. amend. V.  The Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of due process applies to \nstate governments through the Fourteenth Amendment.  U.S. Const. amend. XIV. \n107.  The Act violates due process because it fails to provide fair warning of \nwhat conduct is being regulated.  FCC v.  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. \n239 (2012).  A law is unconstitutionally vague when people “of common intelligence \nmust necessarily guess at its meaning,” Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, \n391  (1926),  or  where  the  law  lacks  definite  and  explicit  standards  thereby \nencouraging “arbitrary and discriminatory” application, Kolender v. Lawson, 461 \nU.S. 352 (1983).   \n108.  These  concerns  are  especially  acute  where,  as  here,  the  Act  both \nregulates the content of speech and permits state enforcement actions.  See Reno, \n521 U.S. at 871.   \n  -55-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 56 of 70\n \n \n109.  Various provisions of the Act, including Sections 2 and 4, regulate \nspeech in vague terms that do not give businesses subject to the Act reasonable and \nfair notice of the conduct that is expected of them and the conduct that may be \nsubject to penalties.  The Act is also riddled with such vague terms that it invites \narbitrary  and  discriminatory  enforcement,  including  the  arbitrary  imposition  of \ndraconian civil penalties.  These infirmities include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing: \na.  The Act establishes an undefined requirement that a social media \nplatform engage in content moderation “in a consistent manner among its users \non the platform.”  Act § 4 (adding § 501.2041(2)(b)).  In addition to facing “civil \nor administrative action” by the Florida Attorney General for an alleged violation \nof this provision, the Act provides a private cause of action for violations of this \nrequirement, with statutory damages of $100,000 per claim and potential punitive \ndamages.  Id. (adding § 501.2041(6)(a)).           \nb.  The  Act  prohibits  “censoring,”  “deplatforming,”  or  “shadow \nbanning” of “a journalistic enterprise,” but employs a vague and amorphous \ndefinition to describe what entities qualify as a “journalistic enterprise.”  Id. \n(adding  §  501.2041(2)(j),  (1)(d)).    This  vagueness  places  covered  online \nbusinesses in the impossible position of having to conduct extensive and costly \ninvestigations to determine whether the State might consider a poster to be a \n  -56-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 57 of 70\n \n \n“journalistic  enterprise”—all  without  any  clear  understanding  of  what  that \ndefinition actually covers.  \nc.  The Act requires covered online businesses to “inform” a candidate \nif they have “willfully provide[d] free advertising for” the candidate, in which \ncase  the  Act  treats  this  “free  advertising”  as  an  “in-kind  contribution”  for \npurposes of Florida’s election laws.  Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(4)).  But, other \nthan a confusing definition of what does not count as “free advertising,” id., the \nAct  provides  no  guidance  as  to  what  will  fall  within  that  vague  category \ntriggering election-law compliance requirements.40  \nd.  The  Act  prohibits  applying  or  using  any  “post-prioritization  or \nshadow banning algorithms for content and material posted by or about a user \nwho is known by the social media platform to be a candidate.”  Id. (adding \n§ 501.2041(2)(h)).  The definition of “post-prioritization” covers any “action by \na social media platform to place, feature, or prioritize certain content or material \nahead of, below, or in a more or less prominent position than others in a newsfeed, \na feed, a view, or in search results.”  It is impossible to understand what this \nprovision allows and does not allow.  Read according to its terms, the provision \n \n40 If the Florida Elections Commission construed the Act to govern candidates for federal office, \nsee Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(6), adopting the definition of “candidate” in F.S. § 106.011(3)(e)), \nthat would raise additional federal preemption concerns given the comprehensive regulation of in-\nkind contributions involving such candidates under the Federal Election Campaign Act.  See 52 \nU.S.C. § 30116(a)(7)(B)(i); 11 C.F.R. § 109.20(a); see also Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 505 \nU.S. 504, 516 (1992). \n  -57-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 58 of 70\n \n \nwould suggest that a search engine is forbidden from placing content “by or \nabout” a political candidate (whether or not it is defamatory or otherwise illegal \nor objectionable) ahead of—or below—any other content.  It forbids placing such \ncontent in a more prominent position—or a less prominent position—than other \ncontent.  Due process does not allow the State to enforce such a paradoxical, self-\ndefeating, and incomprehensible prohibition.    \n110.  Because covered businesses lack fair notice about what conduct is \nallowed  and  what  is  prohibited—subject  to  exposure  to  potentially  massive \npenalties, including fines of $250,000 per day—these provisions of the Act violate \nbasic principles of due process.  Id. (adding § 106.072(3)). \n111.  Vagueness is also rife in other aspects of the Act, including its key \ndefinitions  of  concepts  such  as  “shadow  banning,”  “deplatforming,”  and \n“censoring.”  Because these are the operative provisions under Sections 2 and 4, they \nrender  the  entirety  of  those  Sections  void  for  vagueness  under  due  process \nprotections.  \n112.  Unless  it  is  enjoined,  the  Act  will  operate  to  unlawfully  deprive \nPlaintiffs’ members of their fundamental due process rights.  \n  -58-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 59 of 70\n \n \nCOUNT III \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \nViolation of Equal Protection Rights Under the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States  \n(Challenge to Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act) \n(As to All Defendants) \n113.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 to 75 above as if fully \nand separately set forth herein.   \n114.  The  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution \nguarantees to all citizens “equal protection of the laws,” and it forbids any state \ngovernment from denying that protection “to any person within its jurisdiction[.]”  \nU.S. Const. amend. XIV.  At a minimum, it forbids state governments from engaging \nin arbitrary discrimination against its citizens.  The Equal Protection Clause “is \nessentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.”  \nCity of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  \n115.  Distinctions “affecting fundamental rights,” including the exercise of \nFirst Amendment rights, trigger strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, \neven  if  the  distinctions  do  not  themselves  constitute  suspect  or  invidious \nclassifications.  Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461 (1988).  “The Equal Protection \nClause  requires  that  statutes  affecting  First  Amendment  interests  be  narrowly \ntailored to their legitimate objectives.”  Police Dep’t of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. \n92, 101 (1972). \n  -59-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 60 of 70\n \n \n116.  Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act all purport to regulate the conduct of \n“social  media  platforms.”    The  Act’s  definition  of  that  term  is  arbitrary  and \ndiscriminatory, thereby rendering Sections 2, 3, and 4 in violation of basic equal \nprotection principles.   \n117.  First, the Act’s carveout for companies that own large theme parks \nviolates equal protection.  Whether or not a company owns a theme park has no \nconceivable bearing on whether that company’s social media platform presents the \npurported risks against which the Act was designed to protect.  The Act would not \napply to a targeted company that, for example, bought a zoo or other “theme park or \nentertainment  complex”  that  met  the  following  statutorily  defined  criteria:  “a \ncomplex comprised of at least 25 contiguous acres owned and controlled by the same \nbusiness  entity  and  which  contains  permanent  exhibitions  and  a  variety  of \nrecreational activities and has a minimum of 1 million visitors annually.”  F.S. § \n509.013(9); see Act § 4 (adding § 501.2041(1)(g)).  These specific thresholds have \nnothing to do with any government interest in free speech or online policy.   Nor is \nthere any reason to believe that the State’s purported interest in protecting against \n“unfair” conduct from social media platforms is furthered by protecting theme park \noperators (specifically including Disney and Universal Studios).   \n118.  Second, the definition of businesses that are subject to the Act further \nirrationally discriminates against larger and more popular websites and social media \n  -60-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 61 of 70\n \n \ncompanies by targeting them for restrictions and disfavored governmental treatment.  \nIt targets only select companies that have either (i) at least $100 million in annual \ngross revenues, or (ii) over 100 million monthly participants, while irrationally \nexcluding other companies.  See supra ¶¶ 8, 56-57.  Such arbitrary distinctions \ndemonstrate that the Act unconstitutionally discriminates against  the speech  of \ncertain speakers, that it is gravely under- and over-inclusive, and that it is not \njustified by any legitimate (much less compelling) governmental interest.  \n119.  Because the definition of “social media platforms” is both arbitrary and \ndiscriminatory, Sections 2, 3, and 4 will operate to unlawfully deprive Plaintiffs’ \nmembers of their fundamental equal protection rights.  \n120.  Additionally,  Section  4  establishes  multiple  new  affirmative  and \nonerous obligations that would impact Plaintiffs’ members, but irrationally exclude \nother, favored entities.  See supra ¶¶ 56-57, 65-71.  This separately violates equal \nprotection. \n121.  Similarly, the antitrust provisions in Section 3 suffer from the same \nflaws  by  irrationally  targeting  the  covered  online  businesses,  but  not  other \ncompanies.  See supra ¶¶ 72-74. \n122.  The State cannot show any rational basis for crafting this statutory \nscheme—much  less  satisfy  strict  scrutiny—and,  accordingly,  the  statutory \n  -61-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 62 of 70\n \n \nprovisions  discussed  above  violate  the  equal  protection  rights  of  Plaintiffs’ \nmembers.   \nCOUNT IV \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \nViolation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States  \nand the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment  \nto the Constitution of the United States  \n(Challenge to Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act) \n(As to All Defendants) \n123.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 to 75 above as if fully \nand separately set forth herein.   \n124.  The U.S. Constitution entrusts the regulation of commerce “among the \nseveral States” to the federal government.  U.S. Const. art. I., § 8, cl. 3.  Thus, an \nindividual State may not usurp this authority by regulating interstate commerce \nunilaterally.  See, e.g., C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, 511 U.S. 383 \n(1994). \n125.  “[T]he  Commerce  Clause  by  its  own  force  restricts  state \nprotectionism.”  Tennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Assoc. v. Thomas, 139 S.

Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 \nU.S. 278, 287 (1997) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). \n127.  Courts have long recognized that state laws that attempt to regulate the \ninherently global communications medium that is the Internet must respect the \nconstitutional limits on state authority under the Commerce Clause.  Am. Libraries \nAss’n v. Pataki, 969 F. Supp. 160, 169,173-74 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); Am. Booksellers \nFound. v. Dean, 342 F.3d 96, 103-104 (2d Cir. 2003). \n128.  The  Act  violates  the  Commerce  Clause  by  imposing  uniquely \nburdensome  operational  requirements  on  businesses  headquartered  (and  with \nsubstantial  business  operations)  outside  of  Florida,  while  expressly  exempting \nfavored  in-state  businesses  through  a  status-based  “theme  park”  ownership \nexemption that is based on economic protectionism.  Cf. Tennessee Wine & Spirits, \n139  S.  Ct.  at  2472-74.    Both  on  its  face  and  in  its  practical  effects,  the  Act \nimpermissibly  discriminates  against  out-of-state  businesses,  and  favors  in-state \nbusinesses.    The  Act  also  imposes  onerous  and  undue  burdens  on  interstate \ncommerce by predominantly targeting online businesses headquartered outside the \nState.    Florida  has  no  legitimate  reason  for  discriminating  against  interstate \ncommerce—and in favor of companies with in-state theme parks—and the burden \non interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to any of the purported \n  -63-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 64 of 70\n \n \nbenefits that the State claims will result from the Act.  The State cannot show that \nits stated goals could not be served by other available nondiscriminatory means.  \n129.  In addition, the Act regulates wholly out-of-state conduct because there \nis no requirement that the moderation take place in Florida or that the content being \nmoderated is posted in Florida.  Such extraterritorial regulation is forbidden by the \nCommerce Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \n130.  Unless  enjoined,  Sections  2,  3,  and  4  of  the  Act  will  operate  to \nunconstitutionally burden interstate commerce and effect extraterritorial regulation \nin violation of the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause. \nCOUNT V \n(Declaratory Judgment Act) \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \nPreemption under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution  \nof the United States and 47 U.S.C. 230(e)(3) \n(Challenge to Sections 2 and 4 of the Act) \n(As to the Commissioners of the Florida Elections Commission  \nand the Florida Attorney General) \n131.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 to 75 above as if fully \nand separately set forth herein.  \n132.  Section 2 of the Act  permits  the Florida Elections  Commission to \nimpose fines of up to $250,000 per day against any “social media platform” that \nchooses to “permanently delete or ban a user or to temporarily delete or ban a user \nfrom the social media platform for more than 14 days,” if that user is a candidate for \nstatewide public office.  Act § 2 (adding § 106.072(2)).  The Commission may \n  -64-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 65 of 70\n \n \nimpose fines of up to $25,000 per day against a platform that bans the account of a \ncandidate for a local public office.  Id. \n133.  Section 4 of the Act permits any private individual to bring a cause of \naction against a platform that has applied its “censorship” standards inconsistently, \nand/or against a platform that has “censor[ed]” or “shadow ban[ned]” a user without \nproviding adequate notification.  Act § 4 (adding § 501.2041(2)(b), (d)(1)).  Such a \ncivil action could, for instance, be brought against a platform that removed content \nposted by one user, but not similar content posted by another user.   \n134.  Section 4 also permits the Department of Legal Affairs to bring “a civil \nor administrative action” against any platform suspected of violating any provision \nof Section 4.   Id. (adding § 501.2041(5)).  Such violations include the decision to \n“censor, deplatform or shadow ban a journalistic enterprise,” or to “shadow ban[]” \na candidate for elected office.  Id. (adding § 501.2041(2)(h), (2)(j)).  They also \ninclude violations of the other Moderation Restrictions and affirmative obligations \ncontained in Section 4.  \n135.  Under 47 U.S.C. § 230, it is federal policy “to promote the continued \ndevelopment  of  the  Internet  and  other  interactive  computer  services  and  other \ninteractive  media”  and  “preserve  the  vibrant  and  competitive  free  market  that \npresently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered \nby Federal or State regulation.”  47 U.S.C. § 230(b)(1), (2).  Among the important \n  -65-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 66 of 70\n \n \npurposes advanced by Section 230, Congress sought “to encourage service providers \nto self-regulate the dissemination of offensive material over their services.”  Fair \nHousing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157, \n1163 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  This is its principal purpose.  Id. at n.12.       \n136.   Under Section 230, “[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer \nservice shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by \nanother  information  content  provider.”    47  U.S.C.  §  230(c)(1).    Section  230 \n“establish[es] broad ‘federal immunity to any cause of action that would make \nservice providers liable for information originating with a third-party user of the \nservice.’” Almeida v. Amazon.com, Inc., 456 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir. 2006) \n(quoting Zeran v. Am. Online, Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir. 1997)).  Under \nSection 230, laws or claims that “seek[] to hold a service provider liable for its \nexercise of a publisher’s traditional editorial functions—such as deciding whether to \npublish, withdraw, postpone or alter content—are barred.”  Zeran, 129 F.3d at 330.   \n137.  Moreover, under Section 230, “[n]o provider or user of an interactive \ncomputer service shall be held liable on account of . . . any action voluntarily taken \nin good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user \nconsiders to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or \notherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.”  \n47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(2).   \n  -66-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 67 of 70\n \n \n138.  Section 230 similarly prohibits liability for “any action taken to enable \nor make available to information content providers or others the technical means to \nrestrict access to material” that falls within the Section 230(c)(2) category above.  Id. \n§ 230(c)(2)(B).  This provision applies to tools that online service providers make \navailable  to  users  to  help  them  avoid  or  limit  their  exposure  to  potentially \nobjectionable content.  \n139.  For purposes of Section 230, an “interactive computer service” is “any \ninformation service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables \ncomputer access by multiple users to a computer server.”  Id. § 230(f)(2).  The \n“provider” of such a service includes those who own or operate websites, such as \nsocial media platforms, and therefore covers Plaintiffs’ members who are subject to \nthe Florida Act.   \n140.  Section  230  expressly  provides  that  “[n]o  cause  of  action  may  be \nbrought  and  no  liability may  be imposed  under  any  State or  local law  that  is \ninconsistent with this section.”  Id. § 230(e)(3).  This provision expressly preempts \ninconsistent state laws that seek to hold online service providers liable for engaging \nin content moderation covered by Section 230(c).  Preemption applies equally to \nprivate causes of action and public enforcement actions.  \n141.  Sections 2 and 4 of the Act are inconsistent with Section 230 and \ntherefore are expressly preempted because they (i) purport to impose liability on \n  -67-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 68 of 70\n \n \n“social media platforms” covered by Section 230 for taking actions protected by \nSections 230(c)(1) and (c)(2), and (ii) would impermissibly treat the platforms as \npublishers of third-party content.  Id. § 230(c)(1) & (2)(A).  \n142.  Sections 2 and 4 are also preempted under the principles of implied \npreemption and “obstacle preemption.”  Sections 2 and 4 frustrate and undermine \nthe basic purposes and policy goals of Section 230.  See Geier v. Am. Honda Motor \nCo., 529 U.S. 861, 873 (2000). \n143.  The  Court  should  issue  a  declaration  confirming  that  preemption \napplies to the Act.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs request the following relief: \n(1)  An order declaring the Act unconstitutional on its face for violating \nPlaintiffs’ members’  rights under the  First and  Fourteenth Amendments  to the \nConstitution  of  the  United  States  (including  the  Fourteenth  Amendment’s  due \nprocess and equal protection requirements) and for violating the Commerce Clause \nand the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause;  \n(2)   An order declaring Sections 2 and 4 of the Act preempted by federal \nlaw, including 47 U.S.C. § 230(e)(3) and principles of implied preemption;   \n(3)  An order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the defendants from \nenforcing Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act; \n  -68-   \n \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 1   Filed 05/27/21   Page 69 of 70\n \n \n(4)  An order for costs incurred in bringing this action; \n(5)  An order for reasonable attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b); and \n(6)  Such other relief as the Court deems appropriate. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n   \nDate: May 27, 2021  /s/ Christopher G.

Docket No. 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF \n____________________ \n \nBefore NEWSOM, TJOFLAT, and ED CARNES, Circuit Judges. \nNEWSOM, Circuit Judge: \nNot in their wildest dreams could anyone in the Founding \ngeneration have imagined Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Tik-\nTok.  But “whatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 3 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 3 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  3 \never-advancing  technology,  the  basic  principles  of  freedom  of \nspeech and the press, like the First Amendment’s command, do not \nvary when a new and different medium for communication ap-\npears.”  Brown v. Ent. Merchs. Ass’n, 564 U.S. 786, 790 (2011) (quo-\ntation marks omitted).  One of those “basic principles”—indeed, \nthe most basic of the basic—is that “[t]he Free Speech Clause of the \nFirst Amendment constrains governmental actors and protects pri-\nvate actors.”  Manhattan Cmty. Access Corp. v. Halleck, 139 S. Ct. \n1921, 1926 (2019).  Put simply, with minor exceptions, the govern-\nment can’t tell a private person or entity what to say or how to say \nit.   \nThe question at the core of this appeal is whether the Face-\nbooks and Twitters of the world—indisputably “private actors” \nwith First Amendment rights—are engaged in constitutionally pro-\ntected expressive activity when they moderate and curate the con-\ntent that they disseminate on their platforms.  The State of Florida \ninsists that they aren’t, and it has enacted a first-of-its-kind law to \ncombat what some of its proponents perceive to be a concerted \neffort by “the ‘big tech’ oligarchs in Silicon Valley” to “silenc[e]” \n“conservative” speech in favor of a “radical leftist” agenda.  To that \nend, the new law would, among other things, prohibit certain so-\ncial-media companies from “deplatforming” political candidates \nunder any circumstances, prioritizing or deprioritizing any post or \nmessage “by or about” a candidate, and, more broadly, removing \nanything posted by a “journalistic enterprise” based on its content. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 4 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 4 of 67 \n4  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nWe hold that it is substantially likely that social-media com-\npanies—even the biggest ones—are “private actors” whose rights \nthe First Amendment protects, Manhattan Cmty., 139 S. Ct. at \n1926, that their so-called “content-moderation” decisions consti-\ntute protected exercises of editorial judgment, and that the provi-\nsions of the new Florida law that restrict large platforms’ ability to \nengage in content moderation unconstitutionally burden that pre-\nrogative.  We further conclude that it is substantially likely that one \nof  the  law’s  particularly  onerous  disclosure  provisions—which \nwould require covered platforms to provide a “thorough rationale” \nfor each and every content-moderation decision they make—vio-\nlates the First Amendment.  Accordingly, we hold that the compa-\nnies are entitled to a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforce-\nment of those provisions.  Because we think it unlikely that the \nlaw’s remaining (and far less burdensome) disclosure provisions vi-\nolate the First Amendment, we hold that the companies are not \nentitled to preliminary injunctive relief with respect to them. \nI \nA \nWe begin with a primer:  This is a case about social-media \nplatforms.  (If you’re one of the millions of Americans who regu-\nlarly use social media or can’t remember a time before social media \nexisted, feel free to skip ahead.) \n  At their core, social-media platforms collect speech created \nby third parties—typically in the form of written text, photos, and \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 5 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 5 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  5 \nvideos, which we’ll collectively call “posts”—and then make that \nspeech available to others, who might be either individuals who \nhave chosen to “follow” the “post”-er or members of the general \npublic.  Social-media platforms include both massive websites with \nbillions of users—like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok—\nand niche sites that cater to smaller audiences based on specific in-\nterests or affiliations—like Roblox (a child-oriented gaming net-\nwork), ProAmericaOnly (a network for conservatives), and Vegan \nForum (self-explanatory).     \nThree  important  points  about  social-media  platforms:  \nFirst—and this would be too obvious to mention if it weren’t so \noften lost or obscured in political rhetoric—platforms are private \nenterprises, not governmental (or even quasi-governmental) enti-\nties.  No one has an obligation to contribute to or consume the \ncontent that the platforms make available.  And correlatively, while \nthe Constitution protects citizens from governmental efforts to re-\nstrict their access to social media, see Packingham v. North Caro-\nlina, 137 S. Ct. 1730, 1737 (2017), no one has a vested right to force \na platform to allow her to contribute to or consume social-media \ncontent. \nSecond, a social-media platform is different from traditional \nmedia outlets in that it doesn’t create most of the original content \non its site; the vast majority of “tweets” on Twitter and videos on \nYouTube, for instance, are created by individual users, not the \ncompanies that own and operate Twitter and YouTube.  Even so, \nplatforms do engage in some speech of their own:  A platform, for \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 6 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 6 of 67 \n6  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nexample, might publish terms of service or community standards \nspecifying the type of content that it will (and won’t) allow on its \nsite, add addenda or disclaimers to certain posts (say, warning of \nmisinformation or mature content), or publish its own posts. \nThird, and relatedly, social-media platforms aren’t “dumb \npipes”:  They’re not just servers and hard drives storing infor-\nmation or hosting blogs that anyone can access, and they’re not \ninternet service providers reflexively transmitting data from point \nA to point B.  Rather, when a user visits Facebook or Twitter, for \ninstance, she sees a curated and edited compilation of content from \nthe people and organizations that she follows.  If she follows 1,000 \npeople and 100 organizations on a particular platform, for instance, \nher “feed”—for better or worse—won’t just consist of every single \npost created by every single one of those people and organizations \narranged in reverse-chronological order.  Rather, the platform will \nhave exercised editorial judgment in two key ways:  First, the plat-\nform will have removed posts that violate its terms of service or \ncommunity standards—for instance, those containing hate speech, \npornography, or violent content.  See, e.g., Doc. 26-1 at 3–6; Face-\nbook  Community  Standards,  Meta,  https://transpar-\nency.fb.com/policies/community-standards (last accessed May 15, \n2022).  Second, it will have arranged available content by choosing \nhow to prioritize and display posts—effectively selecting which us-\ners’ speech the viewer will see, and in what order, during any given \nvisit to the site.  See Doc. 26-1 at 3.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 7 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 7 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  7 \nAccordingly, a social-media platform serves as an intermedi-\nary between users who have chosen to partake of the service the \nplatform provides and thereby participate in the community it has \ncreated.  In that way, the platform creates a  virtual space in which \nevery user—private individuals, politicians, news organizations, \ncorporations, and advocacy groups—can be both speaker and lis-\ntener.  In playing this role, the platforms invest significant time and \nresources into editing and organizing—the best word, we think, is \ncurating—users’ posts into collections of content that they then dis-\nseminate to others.  By engaging in this content moderation, the \nplatforms develop particular market niches, foster different sorts of \nonline communities, and promote various values and viewpoints. \nB \nThe State of Florida enacted S.B. 7072—in the words of the \nAct’s sponsor, as quoted in Governor DeSantis’s signing state-\nment—to combat the “biased silencing” of “our freedom of speech \nas conservatives . . . by the ‘big tech’ oligarchs in Silicon Valley.”  \nNews Release: Governor Ron DeSantis Signs Bill to Stop the Cen-\nsorship of Floridians by Big Tech (May 24, 2021).1  The bill, the \nGovernor explained, was passed to take “action to ensure that ‘We \nthe People’—real Floridians across the Sunshine State—are guar-\nanteed protection against the Silicon Valley elites” and to check the \n“Big Tech censors” that “discriminate in favor of the dominant \n \n1 See https://www.flgov.com/2021/05/24/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-\nto-stop-the-censorship-of-floridians-by-big-tech.  \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 8 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 8 of 67 \n8  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nSilicon Valley ideology.”  Id.  By signing the bill, the Governor \nsought to “fight[] against [the] big tech oligarchs that contrive, ma-\nnipulate, and censor if you voice views that run contrary to their \nradical leftist narrative.”  Id. \nS.B. 7072’s enacted findings are more measured.  They assert \nthat private social-media platforms are important “in preserving \nfirst amendment protections for all Floridians” and, comparing \nplatforms to “public utilities,” argue that they should be “treated \nsimilarly to common carriers.”  S.B. 7072 § 1(5), (6).  That, the Act \nsays, is because social-media platforms “have unfairly censored, \nshadow banned, deplatformed, and applied post-prioritization al-\ngorithms to Floridians” and because “[t]he state has a substantial \ninterest in protecting its residents from inconsistent and unfair ac-\ntions” by the platforms.  Id. § 1(9), (10).  \nTo these ends, S.B. 7072 contains several new statutory pro-\nvisions that apply to “social media platforms.”  The term “social \nmedia platform” is defined using size and revenue thresholds that \nappear to target the “big tech oligarchs” about whose “narrative” \nand “ideology” the bill’s sponsor and Governor DeSantis had com-\nplained.  Even so, the definition’s broad conception of what a “so-\ncial media platform” does may well sweep in other popular web-\nsites, like the crowdsourced reference tool Wikipedia and virtual \nhandmade craft-market Etsy: \n[A]ny information service, system, Internet search en-\ngine, or access software provider that:  \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 9 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 9 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  9 \n1.  Provides or enables computer access by multiple \nusers to a computer server, including an Internet plat-\nform or a social media site; \n2.  Operates as a sole proprietorship, partnership, \nlimited liability company, corporation, association, or \nother legal entity; \n3.  Does business in the state; and \n4.  Satisfies at least one of the following thresholds: \na.  Has annual gross revenues in excess of $100 \nmillion . . . \nb.  Has at least 100 million monthly individual \nplatform participants globally. \nFla. Stat. § 501.2041(1)(g).  As originally enacted, the law’s defini-\ntion of “social media platform” expressly excluded any platform \n“operated by a company that owns and operates a theme park or \nentertainment complex.”  Id.  But after the onset of this litigation—\nand after Disney executives made public comments critical of an-\nother recently enacted Florida law—the State repealed S.B. 7072’s \ntheme-park-company exemption.  See S.B. 6-C (2022).   \n  The relevant provisions of S.B. 7072—which are codified at \nFla. Stat. §§ 106.072 and 501.20412—can be divided into three cate-\ngories: (1) content-moderation restrictions; (2) disclosure obliga-\ntions; and (3) a user-data requirement.   \n \n2 While S.B. 7072 also enacted antitrust-related provisions, only §§ 106.072 and \n501.2041 are at issue in this appeal. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 10 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 10 of 67 \n10  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nContent-Moderation Restrictions \n•  Candidate deplatforming:  A social-media platform “may \nnot willfully deplatform a candidate for office.”  Fla. Stat. \n§ 106.072(2).  The term “deplatform” is defined to mean “the \naction or practice by a social media platform to permanently \ndelete or ban a user or to temporarily delete or ban a user \nfrom the social media platform for more than 14 days.”  Id. \n§ 501.2041(1)(c). \n•  Posts by or about candidates:  “A social media platform may \nnot apply or use post-prioritization or shadow banning algo-\nrithms for content and material posted by or about . . . a can-\ndidate.”  Id. § 501.2041(2)(h).  “Post prioritization” refers to \nthe practice of arranging certain content in a more or less \nprominent position in a user’s feed or search results.  Id. \n§ 501.2041(1)(e).3  “Shadow banning” refers to any action to \n“limit or eliminate the exposure of a user or content or ma-\nterial posted by a user to other users of [a] . . . platform.”  Id. \n§ 501.2041(1)(f).   \n•  “Journalistic enterprises”:  A social-media platform may not \n“censor, deplatform, or shadow ban a journalistic enterprise \nbased on the content of its publication or broadcast.”  Id. \n§ 501.2041(2)(j).  The term “journalistic enterprise” is de-\nfined broadly to include any entity doing business in Florida \n \n3 For purposes of this appeal, the State does not defend the Act’s post-prioriti-\nzation provisions.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 11 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 11 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  11 \nthat either (1) publishes in excess of 100,000 words online \nand has at least 50,000 paid subscribers or 100,000 monthly \nusers, (2) publishes 100 hours of audio or video online and \nhas at least 100 million annual viewers, (3) operates a cable \nchannel that provides more than 40 hours of content per \nweek to more than 100,000 cable subscribers, or (4) operates \nunder an FCC broadcast license.  Id. § 501.2041(1)(d).  The \nterm “censor” is also defined broadly to include not only ac-\ntions taken to “delete,” “edit,” or “inhibit the publication of” \ncontent, but also any effort to “post an addendum to any \ncontent or material.”  Id. § 501.2041(1)(b).  The only excep-\ntion to this provision’s prohibition is for “obscene” content.  \nId. § 501.2041(2)(j).       \n•  Consistency:  A social-media platform must “apply censor-\nship, deplatforming, and shadow banning standards in a con-\nsistent  manner  among  its  users  on  the  platform.”   Id. \n§ 501.2041(2)(b).  The Act does not define the term “con-\nsistent.”  \n•  30-day restriction:  A platform may not make changes to its \n“user rules, terms, and agreements . . . more than once every \n30 days.”  Id. § 501.2041(2)(c). \n•  User opt-out:  A platform must “categorize” its post-prioriti-\nzation and shadow-banning algorithms and allow users to \nopt out of them; for users who opt out, the platform must \ndisplay material in “sequential or chronological” order.  Id. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 12 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 12 of 67 \n12  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \n§ 501.2041(2)(f).  The platform must offer users the oppor-\ntunity to opt out annually.  Id. § 501.2041(2)(g).   \nDisclosure Obligations \n•  Standards:  A social-media platform must “publish the stand-\nards, including detailed definitions, it uses or has used for \ndetermining how to censor, deplatform, and shadow ban.”  \nId. § 501.2041(2)(a). \n•  Rule changes:  A platform must inform its users “about any \nchanges to” its “rules, terms, and agreements before imple-\nmenting the changes.”  Id. § 501.2041(2)(c). \n•  View counts:  Upon request, a platform must provide a user \nwith the number of others who viewed that user’s content \nor posts.  Id. § 501.2041(2)(e). \n•  Candidate free advertising:  Platforms that “willfully pro-\nvide[] free advertising for a candidate must inform the can-\ndidate of such in-kind contribution.”  Id. § 106.072(4).    \n•  Explanations:  Before a social-media platform deplatforms, \ncensors, or shadow-bans any user, it must provide the user \nwith a detailed notice.  Id. § 501.2041(2)(d).  In particular, the \nnotice must be in writing and be delivered within 7 days, and \nmust include both a “thorough rationale explaining the rea-\nson” for the “censor[ship]” and a “precise and thorough ex-\nplanation of how the social media platform became aware” \nof the content that triggered its decision.  Id. § 501.2041(3).  \n(The notice requirement doesn’t apply “if the censored con-\ntent or material is obscene.”  Id. § 501.2041(4).)  \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 13 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 13 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  13 \nUser-Data Requirement \n•  Data access:  A social-media platform must allow a deplat-\nformed user to “access or retrieve all of the user’s infor-\nmation, content, material, and data for at least 60 days” after \nthe  user  receives  notice  of  deplatforming.    Id. \n§ 501.2041(2)(i).     \nEnforcement of § 106.072—which contains the candidate-\ndeplatforming provision—falls to the Florida Elections Commis-\nsion, which is empowered to impose fines of up to $250,000 per day \nfor violations involving candidates for statewide office and $25,000 \nper  day  for  those  involving  candidates  for  other  offices.   Id. \n§ 106.072(3).  Section 501.2041—which contains S.B. 7072’s remain-\ning provisions—may be enforced either by state governmental ac-\ntors or through civil suits filed by private parties.  Id. § 501.2041(5), \n(6).  Private actions under this section can yield up to $100,000 in \nstatutory damages per claim, actual damages, punitive damages, \nequitable  relief,  and,  in  some  instances,  attorneys’  fees.    Id. \n§ 501.2041(6). \nC \nThe plaintiffs here—NetChoice and the Computer & Com-\nmunications  Industry  Association  (together,  “NetChoice”)—are \ntrade associations that represent internet and social-media compa-\nnies like Facebook, Twitter, Google (which owns YouTube), and \nTikTok.  They sued the Florida officials charged with enforcing \nS.B. 7072 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In particular, they sought to \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 14 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 14 of 67 \n14  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nenjoin enforcement of §§ 106.072 and 501.2041 on a number of \ngrounds,  including,  as  relevant  here,  that  the  law’s  provisions \n(1) violate the social-media companies’ right to free speech under \nthe First Amendment and (2) are preempted by federal law. \nThe district court granted NetChoice’s motion and prelimi-\nnarily enjoined enforcement of §§ 106.072 and 501.2041 in their en-\ntirety.  The court held that the provisions that impose liability for \nplatforms’ decisions to remove or deprioritize content are likely \npreempted by 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(2), which states that “[n]o pro-\nvider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable \non account of . . . any action voluntarily taken in good faith to re-\nstrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user \nconsiders to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively vio-\nlent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such \nmaterial is constitutionally protected.”   \nOn  NetChoice’s  free-speech  challenge,  the  district  court \nheld that the Act’s provisions implicated the First Amendment be-\ncause they restrict platforms’ constitutionally protected exercise of \n“editorial judgment.”  The court then applied strict First Amend-\nment scrutiny because it concluded that some of the Act’s provi-\nsions were content-based and, more broadly, because it found that \nthe entire bill was motivated by the state’s viewpoint-based pur-\npose to defend conservatives’ speech from perceived liberal “big \ntech” bias:  “This viewpoint-based motivation, without more, sub-\njects the legislation to strict scrutiny, root and branch.”  Doc. 113 \nat 23–26.  The court held that the Act’s provisions “come nowhere \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 15 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 15 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  15 \nclose” to surviving strict scrutiny because, it said, “leveling the \nplaying field” for speech is not a legitimate state interest, the provi-\nsions aren’t narrowly tailored, and the State hadn’t even argued \nthat the provisions could survive such scrutiny.  Id. at 27.  The court \nfurther noted that even if more permissive intermediate scrutiny \napplied, the provisions wouldn’t survive because they don’t meet \nthe narrow-tailoring requirement and instead “seem designed not \nto achieve any governmental interest but to impose the maximum \navailable burden on the social media platforms.”  Id. at 28.  The \ncourt concluded that the plaintiffs easily met the remaining re-\nquirements for a preliminary injunction.    \nThe State appealed.  Before us, the State first argues that the \nplaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their preemption challenge be-\ncause some applications of the Act are consistent with § 230.  Sec-\nond, and more importantly for our purposes, the State contends \nthat S.B. 7072 doesn’t even implicate—let alone violate—the First \nAmendment because the platforms aren’t engaged in protected \nspeech.  Rather, the State asserts that the Act merely requires plat-\nforms to “host” third-parties’ speech, which, it says, they may con-\nstitutionally be compelled to do under two Supreme Court deci-\nsions—PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), \nand Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional Rights, Inc., \n547 U.S. 47 (2006).  Alternatively, the State says, the Act doesn’t \ntrigger First Amendment scrutiny because it reflects the State’s per-\nmissible decision to treat social-media platforms like “common car-\nriers.”   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 16 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 16 of 67 \n16  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nNetChoice responds that platforms’ content-moderation de-\ncisions—i.e., their decisions to remove or deprioritize posts or de-\nplatform users, and thereby curate the material they disseminate—\nare “editorial judgments” that are protected by the First Amend-\nment under longstanding Supreme Court precedent, including Mi-\nami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), Pacific \nGas & Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 475 \nU.S. 1 (1986), Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. \n622 (1994), and Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual \nGroup of Boston, 515 U.S. 557 (1995).  According to NetChoice, \nstrict scrutiny applies to the entire law “several times over” because \nit is speaker-, content-, and viewpoint-based.  Moreover, and in any \nevent, NetChoice says, the law fails any form of heightened scru-\ntiny  because  there  is  no  legitimate  state  interest  in  equalizing \nspeech and because the law isn’t narrowly tailored.  NetChoice \nbriefly defends the district court’s preemption holding, but focuses \non the First Amendment issues because they fully dispose of the \ncase and because, it contends, a First Amendment violation is a \nquintessential irreparable injury for injunctive-relief purposes.   \nD \n  “We review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse \nof discretion, reviewing any underlying legal conclusions de novo \nand any findings of fact for clear error.”  Gonzalez v. Governor of \nGa., 978 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir. 2020).  Ordinarily, “[a] district \ncourt may grant injunctive relief only if the moving party shows \nthat: (1) it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 17 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 17 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  17 \n(2) irreparable injury will be suffered unless the injunction issues; \n(3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever dam-\nage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and \n(4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public in-\nterest.”  Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000) (en \nbanc).  Likelihood of success on the merits “is generally the most \nimportant” factor.  Gonzalez, 978 F.3d at 1271 n.12 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  \n*   *   * \n  We  will  train  our  attention  on  the  question  whether \nNetChoice has shown a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits of its First Amendment challenge to Fla. Stat. §§ 106.072 and \n501.2041.  Because we conclude that the Act’s content-moderation \nrestrictions are substantially likely to violate the First Amendment, \nand  because  that  conclusion  fully  disposes  of  the  appeal,  we \nneedn’t reach the merits of the plaintiffs’ preemption challenge.4   \n \n4 The only provisions that NetChoice challenges as preempted are, for reasons \nwe’ll explain, also substantially likely to violate the First Amendment.  Of \ncourse, federal courts should generally “avoid reaching constitutional ques-\ntions if there are other grounds upon which a case can be decided,” but that \nrule applies only when “a dispositive nonconstitutional ground is available.”  \nOtto v. City of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, 871 (11th Cir. 2020) (quotation marks  \nand emphasis omitted).  Here, whether or not the preemption ground is “dis-\npositive,” but cf. id., it isn’t “nonconstitutional” because federal preemption is \nrooted in the Supremacy Clause of Article VI.  See La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. \nFCC, 476 U.S. 355, 368 (1986).        \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 18 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 18 of 67 \n18  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nIn assessing whether the Act likely violates the First Amend-\nment, we must initially consider whether it triggers First Amend-\nment scrutiny in the first place—i.e., whether it regulates “speech” \nwithin the meaning of the Amendment at all.  See Coral Ridge Min-\nistries Media, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 6 F.4th 1247, 1254 (11th \nCir. 2021).  In other words, we must determine whether social-me-\ndia platforms engage in First-Amendment-protected activity.  If \nthey do, we must then proceed to determine what level of scrutiny \napplies and whether the Act’s provisions survive that scrutiny.  See \nFort Lauderdale Food Not Bombs v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 11 \nF.4th 1266, 1291 (11th Cir. 2021) (“FLFNB II”).   \nFor reasons we will explain in the balance of the opinion, we \nhold as follows:  (1) S.B. 7072 triggers First Amendment scrutiny \nbecause  it  restricts  social-media  platforms’  exercise  of  editorial \njudgment and requires them to make certain disclosures; (2) strict \nscrutiny  applies  to  some  of  the  Act’s  content-moderation  re-\nstrictions  while  intermediate  scrutiny  applies  to  others;  (3) the \nAct’s disclosure provisions should be assessed under the standard \narticulated in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. \n626 (1985); (4) it is substantially likely that the Act’s content-mod-\neration restrictions will not survive even intermediate scrutiny; \n(5) it is also substantially likely that the requirement that platforms \nprovide a “thorough rationale” for each content-moderation deci-\nsion will not survive under Zauderer; (6) it is not substantially \nlikely that the Act’s remaining disclosure provisions are unconsti-\ntutional; and (7) the preliminary-injunction factors favor enjoining \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 19 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 19 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  19 \nthe provisions of the Act that are substantially likely to be uncon-\nstitutional. \nII \nA \n  Social-media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, \nand TikTok are private companies with First Amendment rights, \nsee First Nat’l Bank of Bos. v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 781–84 (1978), \nand when they (like other entities) “disclos[e],” “publish[],” or “dis-\nseminat[e]” information, they engage in “speech within the mean-\ning of the First Amendment.”  Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. \n552, 570 (2011) (quotation marks omitted).  More particularly, \nwhen a platform removes or deprioritizes a user or post, it makes \na judgment about whether and to what extent it will publish infor-\nmation to its users—a judgment rooted in the platform’s own \nviews about the sorts of content and viewpoints that are valuable \nand appropriate for dissemination on its site.  As the officials who \nsponsored and signed S.B. 7072 recognized when alleging that “Big \nTech” companies harbor a “leftist” bias against “conservative” per-\nspectives, the companies that operate social-media platforms ex-\npress themselves (for better or worse) through their content-mod-\neration decisions.  When a platform selectively removes what it \nperceives to be incendiary political rhetoric, pornographic content, \nor public-health misinformation, it conveys a message and thereby \nengages in “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 20 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 20 of 67 \n20  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nLaws that restrict platforms’ ability to speak through con-\ntent moderation therefore trigger First Amendment scrutiny.  Two \nlines of precedent independently confirm this commonsense con-\nclusion: first, and most obviously, decisions protecting exercises of \n“editorial judgment”; and second, and separately, those protecting \ninherently expressive conduct. \n1 \nWe’ll  begin  with  the  editorial-judgment cases.    The  Su-\npreme Court has repeatedly held that a private entity’s choices \nabout whether, to what extent, and in what manner it will dissem-\ninate speech—even speech created by others—constitute “editorial \njudgments” protected by the First Amendment.     \nMiami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo is the pathmarking \ncase.  There, the Court held that a newspaper’s decisions about \nwhat content to publish and its “treatment of public issues and pub-\nlic officials—whether fair or unfair—constitute the exercise of edi-\ntorial control and judgment” that the First Amendment was de-\nsigned to safeguard.  418 U.S. at 258.  Florida had passed a statute \nrequiring any paper that ran a piece critical of a political candidate \nto give the candidate equal space in its pages to reply.  Id. at 243.  \nDespite the contentions (1) that economic conditions had created \n“vast accumulations of unreviewable power in the modern media \nempires” and (2) that those conditions had resulted in “bias and ma-\nnipulative reportage” and massive barriers to entry, the Court con-\ncluded that the state’s attempt to compel the paper’s editors to \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 21 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 21 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  21 \n“publish that which reason tells them should not be published is \nunconstitutional.”  Id. at 250–51, 256 (quotation marks omitted).  \nFlorida’s “intrusion into the function of editors,” the Court held, \nwas barred by the First Amendment.  Id. at 258. \nThe Court subsequently extended Miami Herald’s protec-\ntion of editorial judgment beyond newspapers.  In Pacific Gas & \nElectric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California, the Court \ninvalidated a state agency’s order that would have required a utility \ncompany to include in its billing envelopes the speech of a third \nparty with which the company disagreed.  475 U.S. at 4, 20 (plural-\nity op.).  A plurality of the Court reasoned that the concerns under-\nlying Miami Herald applied to a utility company in the same way \nthat they did to the institutional press.  Id. at 11–12.  The challenged \norder required the company “to use its property as a vehicle for \nspreading a message with which it disagree[d]” and therefore was \nsubject to (and failed) strict First Amendment scrutiny.  Id. at 17–\n21.   \nSo too, in Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc. v. FCC, the \nCourt held that cable operators—companies that own cable lines \nand choose which stations to offer their customers—“engage in \nand transmit speech.”  512 U.S. at 636.  “[B]y exercising editorial \ndiscretion over which stations or programs to include in [their] rep-\nertoire,” the Court said, they “seek to communicate messages on a \nwide variety of topics and in a wide variety of formats.”  Id. (quo-\ntation marks omitted); see also Ark. Educ. TV Comm’n v. Forbes, \n523 U.S. 666, 674 (1998) (“Although programming decisions often \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 22 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 22 of 67 \n22  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \ninvolve the compilation of the speech of third parties, the decisions \nnonetheless constitute communicative acts.”).  Because cable oper-\nators’ decisions about which channels to transmit were protected \nspeech,  the  challenged  regulation  requiring  operators  to  carry \nbroadcast-TV channels triggered First Amendment scrutiny.  512 \nU.S. at 637.5 \nMost  recently,  the  Court  applied  the  editorial-judgment \nprinciple to a parade organizer in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, \nLesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, explaining that parades (like \nnewspapers and cable-TV packages) constitute protected expres-\nsion.  515 U.S. at 568.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts \nhad attempted to apply the state’s public-accommodations law to \nrequire the organizers of a privately run parade to allow a gay-pride \ngroup to march.  Id. at 564.  Citing Miami Herald, and using words \nequally applicable here, the Court observed that “the presentation \nof an edited compilation of speech generated by other persons . . . \nfall[s] squarely within the core of First Amendment security” and \nthat the “selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled to \nsimilar protection.”  Id. at 570.  The Court concluded that it didn’t \nmatter that the state was attempting to apply a public-accommo-\ndations statute because “once the expressive character of both the \nparade and the marching [gay-rights] contingent [was] understood, \n \n5 In Turner, the Court applied intermediate scrutiny because the law was con-\ntent-neutral.  See 512 U.S. at 662.  The point for present purposes is that the \nCourt held that the must-carry provision triggered First Amendment scrutiny. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 23 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 23 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  23 \nit bec[ame] apparent that the state courts’ application of the statute \nhad the effect of declaring the [parade] sponsors’ speech itself to be \nthe public accommodation,” which “violates the fundamental rule \nof . . . the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to \nchoose the content of his own message.”  Id. at 573.  Nor did it \nmatter, the Court explained, that the parade didn’t produce a “par-\nticularized message”:  The parade organizer’s decision to “exclude \na message it did not like from the communication it chose to make” \nwas “enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to shape its \nexpression by speaking on one subject while remaining silent on \nanother”—a choice “not to propound a particular point of view” \nthat is “presumed to lie beyond the government’s power to con-\ntrol.”  Id. at 574–75. \nTogether,  Miami Herald,  Pacific Gas,  and  particularly \nTurner and Hurley establish that a private entity’s decisions about \nwhether, to what extent, and in what manner to disseminate third-\nparty-created content to the public are editorial judgments pro-\ntected by the First Amendment.  For reasons we will explain, social-\nmedia  platforms’  content-moderation  decisions  constitute  the \nsame sort of editorial judgments and thus trigger First Amendment \nscrutiny. \n2 \nSeparately,  we  might  also  assess  social-media  platforms’ \ncontent-moderation  practices  against  our  general  standard  for \nwhat constitutes inherently expressive conduct protected by the \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 24 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 24 of 67 \n24  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nFirst Amendment.  We recently explained that standard in Coral \nRidge Ministries, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.:  \nIn determining whether conduct is expressive, we ask \nwhether the reasonable person would interpret it as \nsome  sort  of  message,  not  whether  an  observer \nwould necessarily infer a specific message.  If we find \nthat the conduct in question is expressive, any law \nregulating that conduct is subject to the First Amend-\nment. \n6 F.4th at 1254 (cleaned up).   \nIn Coral Ridge, a Christian ministry and media organization \nsued Amazon.com, alleging that Amazon’s decision to exclude the \norganization from the company’s “AmazonSmile” charitable-giv-\ning program—based on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s desig-\nnation of the organization as a “hate group”—constituted religious \ndiscrimination in violation of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \nId. at 1250–51.  We held that “Amazon’s choice of what charities \nare eligible to receive donations through AmazonSmile” was ex-\npressive conduct—and notably, in so holding, we analogized Ama-\nzon’s determination to the parade organizer’s decisions in Hurley \nabout which groups to include in the march.  Id. at 1254–55.  “A \nreasonable person would interpret” Amazon’s exclusion of certain \ncharities from the program based on the SPLC’s hate-group desig-\nnations, we said, “as Amazon conveying ‘some sort of message’ \nabout the organizations it wishes to support.”  Id.  (quoting Fort \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 25 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 25 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  25 \nLauderdale Food Not Bombs v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 901 F.3d \n1235, 1240 (11th Cir. 2018) (“FLFNB I”)).   \nThe Coral Ridge case built on our earlier decision in Fort \nLauderdale Food Not Bombs.  That case concerned a non-profit \norganization that distributed free food in a city park to communi-\ncate its view that society should end hunger and poverty by redi-\nrecting resources away from the military.  901 F.3d at 1238–39.  \nWhen the city enacted an ordinance that would have prohibited \ndistributing food in parks without prior authorization, the organi-\nzation sued, arguing that its food-sharing events constituted inher-\nently expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment.  Id. at \n1239–40.  We held that given the surrounding context, the organi-\nzation’s food-sharing events would convey “some sort of message” \nto the reasonable observer—and were therefore “‘a form of pro-\ntected expression.’”  Id. at 1244–45 (quoting Spence v. Washington, \n418 U.S. 405, 410 (1974)). \n3 \n  Whether we assess social-media platforms’ content-moder-\nation activities against the Miami Herald line of cases or against our \nown decisions explaining what constitutes expressive conduct, the \nresult is the same:  Social-media platforms exercise editorial judg-\nment that is inherently expressive.  When platforms choose to re-\nmove  users  or  posts,  deprioritize  content  in  viewers’  feeds  or \nsearch results, or sanction breaches of their community standards, \nthey engage in First-Amendment-protected activity.    \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 26 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 26 of 67 \n26  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \n  Social-media platforms’ content-moderation decisions are, \nwe think, closely analogous to the editorial judgments that the Su-\npreme Court recognized in Miami Herald, Pacific Gas, Turner, and \nHurley.  Like parade organizers and cable operators, social-media \ncompanies are in the business of delivering curated compilations of \nspeech created, in the first instance, by others.  Just as the parade \norganizer exercises editorial judgment when it refuses to include in \nits lineup groups with whose messages it disagrees, and just as a \ncable operator might refuse to carry a channel that produces con-\ntent it prefers not to disseminate, social-media platforms regularly \nmake choices “not to propound a particular point of view.”  Hur-\nley, 515 U.S. at 575.  Platforms employ editorial judgment to con-\nvey some messages but not others and thereby cultivate different \ntypes of communities that appeal to different groups.  A few exam-\nples:   \n•  YouTube seeks to create a “welcoming community for \nviewers” and, to that end, prohibits a wide range of con-\ntent, including spam, pornography, terrorist incitement, \nelection  and  public-health  misinformation,  and  hate \nspeech.6 \n•  Facebook engages in content moderation to foster “au-\nthenticity,” “safety,” “privacy,” and “dignity,” and accord-\ningly,  removes  or  adds  warnings  to  a  wide  range  of \n \n6 Policies and Guidelines,  YouTube,  https://www.youtube.com/crea-\ntors/how-things-work/policies-guidelines (last accessed May 15, 2022). \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 27 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 27 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  27 \ncontent—for example, posts that include what it considers \nto be hate speech, fraud or deception, nudity or sexual ac-\ntivity, and public-health misinformation.7  \n•  Twitter aims “to ensure all people can participate in the \n \npublic conversation freely and safely” by removing con-\ntent, among other categories, that it views as embodying \nhate, glorifying violence, promoting suicide, or containing \nelection misinformation.8  \n•  Roblox, a gaming social network primarily for children, \n \nprohibits “[s]ingling out a user or group for ridicule or \nabuse,” any sort of sexual content, depictions of and sup-\nport for war or violence, and any discussion of political par-\nties or candidates.9\n•  Vegan Forum allows non-vegans but “will not tolerate \n \nmembers who promote contrary agendas.”10  \n \n7 Facebook Community Standards, Meta, https://transparency.fb.com/poli-\ncies/community-standards (last accessed May 15, 2022).    \n8 The Twitter Rules, Twitter, https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-poli-\ncies/twitter-rules (last accessed May 15, 2022).    \n9 Roblox Community Standards, Roblox, https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/203313410-Roblox-Community-Standards (last accessed May 15, \n2022). \n10  Membership  Rules,  Vegan  Forum,  https://www.vegan-\nforum.org/help/terms (last accessed May 15, 2022). \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 28 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 28 of 67 \n28  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nAnd to be clear, some platforms exercise editorial judgment to pro-\nmote explicitly political agendas.  On the right, ProAmericaOnly \npromises “No Censorship | No Shadow Bans | No BS | NO \nLIBERALS.”11  And on the left, The Democratic Hub says that its \n“online community is for liberals, progressives, moderates, inde-\npendent[s] and anyone who has a favorable opinion of Democrats \nand/or liberal political views or is critical of Republican ideol-\nogy.”12      \nAll such decisions about what speech to permit, disseminate, \nprohibit, and deprioritize—decisions based on platforms’ own par-\nticular  values  and  views—fit  comfortably  within  the  Supreme \nCourt’s editorial-judgment precedents. \n  Separately, but similarly, platforms’ content-moderation ac-\ntivities qualify as First-Amendment-protected expressive conduct \nunder Coral Ridge and FLFNB I.  A reasonable person would likely \ninfer “some sort of message” from, say, Facebook removing hate \nspeech or Twitter banning a politician.  Indeed, unless posts and \nusers are removed randomly, those sorts of actions necessarily con-\nvey some sort of message—most obviously, the platforms’ disa-\ngreement with or disapproval of certain content, viewpoints, or us-\ners.  Here, for instance, the driving force behind S.B. 7072 seems to \nhave been a perception  (right or wrong) that some  platforms’ \n \n11 ProAmericaOnly, https://proamericaonly.org (last accessed May 15, 2022).   \n12 The Democratic Hub, https://www.democratichub.com (last accessed \nMay 15, 2022). \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 29 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 29 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  29 \ncontent-moderation decisions reflected a “leftist” bias against “con-\nservative” views—which, for better or worse, surely counts as ex-\npressing a message.  That observers perceive bias in platforms’ con-\ntent-moderation decisions is compelling evidence that those deci-\nsions are indeed expressive. \nIn an effort to rebut this point, the State responds that be-\ncause the vast majority of content that makes it onto social-media \nplatforms is never reviewed—let alone removed or deprioritized—\nplatforms aren’t engaged in conduct of sufficiently expressive qual-\nity to merit First Amendment protection.  See Reply Br. of Appel-\nlant at 16.  With respect, the State’s argument misses the point.  \nThe “conduct” that the challenged provisions regulate—what this \nentire appeal is about—is the platforms’ “censorship” of users’ \nposts—i.e., the posts that platforms do review and remove or depri-\noritize.13  The question, then, is whether that conduct is expressive.  \nFor reasons we’ve explained, we think it unquestionably is.14   \n \n13 The fact that some social-media platforms choose to allow most content \ndoesn’t undermine their claim to First Amendment protection.  See U.S. Tel-\necom Ass’n v. FCC, 855 F.3d 381, 429 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dis-\nsental) (explaining that the fact that platforms “have not been aggressively ex-\nercising their editorial discretion does not mean that they have no right to ex-\nercise their editorial discretion”). \n14 Texas and several other states as amici insist that social-media platforms’ \n“censorship, deplatforming, and shadow banning” activities aren’t inherently \nexpressive conduct for First Amendment purposes because the platforms \ndon’t “inten[d] to convey a particularized message.”  States’ Amicus Br. at 6–\n7 (quoting FLFNB I, 901 F.3d at 1240).  They note that the platforms’ most \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 30 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 30 of 67 \n30  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nB \nIn the face of the editorial-judgment and expressive-conduct \ncases, the State insists that S.B. 7072 doesn’t even implicate, let \nalone  violate,  the  First  Amendment.    The  State’s  first  line  of \n \nprominent CEOs have denied accusations that their content rules are based \non ideology or political perspective.  But while an “intent to convey a particu-\nlarized message” was once necessary to qualify as expressive conduct, FLFNB \nI explained that “[s]ince then . . . the [Supreme] Court has clarified that a ‘nar-\nrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional protec-\ntion’ because ‘if confined to expressions conveying a “particularized message” \n[the First Amendment] would never reach the unquestionably shielded paint-\ning of Jackson Pollack, music of Arnold Schoenberg, or Jabberwocky verse of \nLewis Carroll.’”  FLFNB I, 901 F.3d at 1240 (last alteration in original) (quoting \nHurley, 515 U.S. at 569)).  Instead, as explained in text, we require only that a \n“reasonable person would interpret [the conduct] as some sort of message.”  \nId. (quoting Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, 370 F.3d 1252, 1270 (11th \nCir. 2004)).   \nTo the extent that the states argue that social-media platforms lack the \nrequisite “intent” to convey a message, we find it implausible that platforms \nwould engage in the laborious process of defining detailed community stand-\nards, identifying offending content, and removing or deprioritizing that con-\ntent if they didn’t intend to convey “some sort of message.”  Unsurprisingly, \nthe record in this case confirms platforms’ intent to communicate messages \nthrough their content-moderation decisions—including that certain material \nis harmful or unwelcome on their sites.  See, e.g., Doc. 25-1 at 2 (declaration \nof YouTube executive explaining that its approach to content moderation “is \nto remove content that violates [its] policies (developed with outside experts \nto  prevent  real-world  harms),  reduce  the  spread  of  harmful  misinfor-\nmation . . . and raise authoritative and trusted content”); Facebook Commu-\nnity Standards, supra (noting that Facebook moderates content “in service of” \nits “values” of “authenticity,” “safety,” “privacy,” and “dignity”).    \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 31 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 31 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  31 \nargument  relies  on  two  cases—PruneYard Shopping Center v. \nRobins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), and Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic \n& Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47 (2006) (“FAIR”)—in which \nthe Supreme Court upheld government regulations that effectively \ncompelled private actors to “host” others’ speech.  The State’s sec-\nond argument seeks to evade—or at least minimize—First Amend-\nment scrutiny by labeling social-media platforms “common carri-\ners.”  We find neither argument convincing.   \n1 \nWe begin with the “hosting” cases.  The first decision to \nwhich  the  State  points,  PruneYard,  is  readily  distinguishable.  \nThere, the Supreme Court affirmed a state court’s decision requir-\ning a privately owned shopping mall to allow members of the pub-\nlic to circulate petitions on its property.  447 U.S. at 76–77, 88.  In \nthat case, though, the only First Amendment interest that the mall \nowner asserted was the right “not to be forced by the State to use \n[its] property as a forum for the speech of others.”  Id. at 85.  The \nSupreme Court’s subsequent decisions in Pacific Gas and Hurley \ndistinguished and cabined PruneYard.  The Pacific Gas plurality ex-\nplained that “[n]otably absent from PruneYard was any concern \nthat access to this area might affect the shopping center owner’s \nexercise of his own right to speak: the owner did not even allege \nthat he objected to the content of the pamphlets.”  475 U.S. at 12 \n(plurality op.); see also id. at 24 (Marshall, J., concurring in the judg-\nment) (“While the shopping center owner in PruneYard wished to \nbe free of unwanted expression, he nowhere alleged that his own \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 32 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 32 of 67 \n32  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nexpression was hindered in the slightest.”); Hurley, 515 U.S. at 580 \n(noting that the “principle of speaker’s autonomy was simply not \nthreatened in” PruneYard).  Because NetChoice asserts that S.B. \n7072 interferes with the platforms’ own speech rights by forcing \nthem to carry messages that contradict their community standards \nand terms of service, PruneYard is inapposite. \nFAIR may be a bit closer, but it, too, is distinguishable.  In \nthat case, the Supreme Court upheld a federal statute—the Solo-\nmon Amendment—that required law schools, as a condition to re-\nceiving federal funding, to allow military recruiters the same access \nto campuses and students as any other employer.  547 U.S. at 56.  \nThe schools, which had restricted recruiters’ access because they \nopposed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy regarding \ngay servicemembers, protested that requiring them to host recruit-\ners and post notices on their behalf violated the First Amendment.  \nId. at 51.  But the Court held that the law didn’t implicate the First \nAmendment because it “neither limit[ed] what law schools may say \nnor require[d] them to say anything.”  Id. at 60.  In so holding, the \nCourt  rejected  two  arguments  for  why  the  First  Amendment \nshould apply—(1) that the Solomon Amendment unconstitution-\nally required law schools to host the military’s speech, and (2) that \nit restricted the law schools’ expressive conduct.  Id. at 60–61.   \nWith respect to the first argument, the Court distinguished \nMiami Herald, Pacific Gas, and Hurley on the ground that, in those \ncases, “the complaining speaker’s own message was affected by the \nspeech it was forced to accommodate.”  Id. at 63.  The Solomon \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 33 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 33 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  33 \nAmendment’s requirement that schools host military recruiters did \n“not affect the law schools’ speech,” the Court said, “because the \nschools [were] not speaking when they host[ed] interviews and re-\ncruiting receptions”:  Recruiting activities, the Court reasoned, \nsimply aren’t “inherently expressive”—they’re not speech—in the \nway that editorial pages, newsletters, and parades are.  Id. at 64.  \nTherefore, the Court concluded, “accommodation of a military re-\ncruiter’s message is not compelled speech because the accommo-\ndation  does  not  sufficiently  interfere  with  any  message  of  the \nschool.”  Id.  Nor did the Solomon Amendment’s requirement that \nschools send notices on behalf of military recruiters unconstitution-\nally compel speech, the Court held, as it was merely incidental to \nthe law’s regulation of conduct.  Id. at 62.   \nThe FAIR Court also rejected the law schools’ second argu-\nment—namely, that the Solomon Amendment restricted their in-\nherently expressive conduct.  The schools’ refusal to allow military \nrecruiters on campus was expressive, the Court emphasized, “only \nbecause [they] accompanied their conduct with speech explaining \nit.”  Id. at 66.  In the normal course, the Court said, an observer \n“who s[aw] military recruiters interviewing away from the law \nschool [would have] no way of knowing” whether the school was \nexpressing a message or, instead, the school’s rooms just happened \nto be full or the recruiters just preferred to interview elsewhere.  Id.  \nBecause “explanatory speech” was necessary to understand the \nmessage conveyed by the law schools’ conduct, the Court con-\ncluded, that conduct wasn’t “inherently expressive.”  Id. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 34 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 34 of 67 \n34  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nFAIR isn’t controlling here because social-media platforms \nwarrant First Amendment protection on both of the grounds that \nthe Court held that law-school recruiting services didn’t.    \nFirst, S.B. 7072 interferes with social-media platforms’ own \n“speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment.  Social-me-\ndia platforms, unlike law-school recruiting services, are in the busi-\nness of disseminating curated collections of speech.  A social-media \nplatform that “exercises editorial discretion in the selection and \npresentation of” the content that it disseminates to its users “en-\ngages in speech activity.”  Ark. Educ. TV Comm’n, 523 U.S. at 674; \nsee Sorrell, 564 U.S. at 570 (explaining that the “dissemination of \ninformation” is “speech within the meaning of the First Amend-\nment”); Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 527 (2001) (“If the acts \nof  ‘disclosing’  and  ‘publishing’  information  do  not  constitute \nspeech, it is hard to imagine what does fall within that category.” \n(cleaned up)).  Just as the must-carry provisions in Turner “re-\nduce[d] the number of channels over which cable operators exer-\ncise[d] unfettered control” and therefore triggered First Amend-\nment scrutiny, 512 U.S. at 637, S.B. 7072’s content-moderation re-\nstrictions reduce the number of posts over which platforms can ex-\nercise their editorial judgment.  Because a social-media platform \nitself “spe[aks]” by curating and delivering compilations of others’ \nspeech—speech that may include messages ranging from Face-\nbook’s promotion of authenticity, safety, privacy, and dignity to \nProAmericaOnly’s “No BS | No LIBERALS”—a law that requires \nthe  platform  to  disseminate  speech  with  which  it  disagrees \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 35 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 35 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  35 \ninterferes with its own message and thereby implicates its First \nAmendment rights.  \nSecond, social-media platforms are engaged in inherently ex-\npressive conduct of the sort that the Court found lacking in FAIR.  \nAs we were careful to explain in FLFNB I, FAIR “does not mean \nthat conduct loses its expressive nature just because it is also ac-\ncompanied by other speech.”  901 F.3d at 1243–44.  Rather, “[t]he \ncritical question is whether the explanatory speech is necessary for \nthe reasonable observer to perceive a message from the conduct.”  \nId. at 1244.  And we held that an advocacy organization’s food-shar-\ning events constituted expressive conduct from which, “due to the \ncontext surrounding them, the reasonable observer would infer \nsome  sort  of  message”—even  without  reference  to  the  words \n“Food Not Bombs” on the organization’s banners.  Id. at 1245.  \nContext, we held, is what differentiates “activity that is sufficiently \nexpressive [from] similar activity that is not”—e.g., “the act of sit-\nting down” from “the sit-in by African Americans at a Louisiana \nlibrary” protesting segregation.  Id. at 1241 (citing Brown v. Loui-\nsiana, 383 U.S. 131, 141–42 (1966)).  \nUnlike the law schools in FAIR, social-media platforms’ con-\ntent-moderation decisions communicate messages when they re-\nmove or “shadow-ban” users or content.  Explanatory speech isn’t \n“necessary  for  the  reasonable  observer  to  perceive  a  message \nfrom,” for instance, a platform’s decision to ban a politician or re-\nmove what it perceives to be misinformation.

Id. at 1245; see also Coral Ridge, 6 F.4th at 1254.  Given the \ncontext, a reasonable observer witnessing a platform remove a user \nor item of content would infer, at a minimum, a message of disap-\nproval.15  Thus, social-media platforms engage in content modera-\ntion that is inherently expressive notwithstanding FAIR.     \n \n15 One might object that users know that social-media platforms remove con-\ntent, deplatform users, or deprioritize posts only because of the platforms’ \nspeech explaining those decisions—so the conduct itself isn’t inherently ex-\npressive.  See FAIR, 547 U.S. at 66.  But unlike the person who observes mili-\ntary recruiters interviewing away from a law school and has no idea whether \nthe school is thereby expressing a message, see id., we find it unlikely that a \nreasonable observer would think, for instance, that the reason he rarely or \nnever sees pornography on Facebook is that none of Facebook’s billions of \nusers ever posts any.  The more reasonable inference to be drawn from the \nfact that certain types of content rarely or never appear when a user browses \na social-media site—or why certain posts disappear or prolific Twitter users \nvanish from the platform after making controversial statements—is that the \nplatform disapproves. \nIt might be, we suppose, that some content-moderation decisions—\nfor instance, to prioritize or deprioritize individual posts—are so subtle that \nusers wouldn’t notice them but for the platforms’ speech explaining their ac-\ntions.  But even if some subset of content-moderation activities wouldn’t \ncount as inherently expressive conduct under FAIR and FLFNB I, many are \nsufficiently transparent that users would likely notice them and, in context, \ninfer from them “some sort of message”—even in the absence of explanatory \nspeech.  Specifically, it’s likely clear to viewers that platforms take down indi-\nvidual posts, remove entire categories of content, and deplatform other us-\ners—and that such actions express messages.  “Shadow-banning” would also \nlikely be apparent and communicate a message to a reasonable user who \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 37 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 37 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  37 \n*   *   * \nThe State asserts that Pruneyard and FAIR—and, for that \nmatter, the Supreme Court’s editorial-judgment decisions—estab-\nlish three “guiding principles” that should lead us to conclude that \nS.B. 7072 doesn’t implicate the First Amendment.  We disagree.   \nThe first principle—that a regulation must interfere with the \nhost’s ability to speak in order to implicate the First Amendment—\ndoes find support in FAIR.  See 547 U.S. at 64.  Even so, the State’s \nargument—that S.B. 7072 doesn’t interfere with platforms’ ability \nto speak because they can still affirmatively dissociate themselves \nfrom the content that they disseminate—encounters two difficul-\nties.  As an initial matter, in at least one key provision, the Act de-\nfines the term “censor” to include “posting an addendum,” i.e., a \ndisclaimer—and thereby explicitly prohibits the very speech by \nwhich a platform might dissociate itself from users’ messages.  Fla. \nStat. § 501.2041(1)(b).  Moreover, and more fundamentally, if the \nexercise of editorial judgment—the decision about whether, to \nwhat  extent,  and  in  what  manner  to  disseminate  third-party \n \nknows that she follows a particular poster but doesn’t see that poster’s content, \nfor instance, in her feed or search results.  Thus, even if some content moder-\nation isn’t inherently expressive, much of it is.  See United States v. Stevens, \n559 U.S. 460, 473 (2010) (noting that a statute facially violates the First Amend-\nment if “a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged \nin relation to its plainly legitimate sweep” (quotation marks omitted)).  As ex-\nplained in text, S.B. 7072’s content-moderation restrictions all regulate plat-\nforms’ inherently expressive conduct and trigger heightened scrutiny.  See in-\nfra Part II.C.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 38 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 38 of 67 \n38  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \ncontent—is itself speech or inherently expressive conduct, which \nwe have said it is, then the Act does interfere with platforms’ ability \nto speak.  See Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at 10–12, 16 (plurality op.) (not-\ning that if the government could compel speakers to “propound . . . \nmessages with which they disagree,” the First Amendment’s pro-\ntection “would be empty, for the government could require speak-\ners to affirm in one breath that which they deny in the next”). \nThe State’s second principle—that in order to trigger First \nAmendment scrutiny a regulation must create a risk that viewers \nor listeners might confuse a user’s and the platform’s speech—finds \nlittle support in our precedent.  Consumer confusion simply isn’t a \nprerequisite to First Amendment protection.  In Miami Herald, for \ninstance, even though no reasonable observer would have mis-\ntaken a political candidate’s statutorily mandated right-to-reply col-\numn for the newspaper reversing its earlier criticism, the Supreme \nCourt deemed the paper’s editorial judgment to be protected.  See \n418 U.S. at 244, 258.  Nor was there a risk of consumer confusion \nin Turner:  No reasonable person would have thought that the ca-\nble operator there endorsed every message conveyed by every \nspeaker on every one of the channels it carried, and yet the Court \nstated categorically that the operator’s editorial discretion was pro-\ntected.  See 512 U.S. at 636–37.  Moreover, it seems to us that the \nState’s confusion argument boomerangs back around on itself:  If a \nplatform announces a community standard prohibiting, say, hate \nspeech, but is then barred from removing or even disclaiming posts \ncontaining what it perceives to be hate speech, there’s a real risk \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 39 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 39 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  39 \nthat a viewer might erroneously conclude that the platform doesn’t \nconsider those posts to constitute hate speech. \nThe State’s final principle—that in order to receive First \nAmendment protection a platform must curate and present speech \nin  such  a  way  that  a  “common  theme”  emerges—is  similarly \nflawed.  Hurley held that “a private speaker does not forfeit consti-\ntutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices, or by \nfailing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message as the exclu-\nsive subject matter of the speech.”  515 U.S. at 569–70; see FLFNB \nI, 901 F.3d at 1240 (citing Hurley for the proposition that a “partic-\nularized message” isn’t required for conduct to qualify for First \nAmendment protection).  Moreover, even if one could theoreti-\ncally attribute a common theme to a parade, Turner makes clear \nthat no such theme is required:  It seems to us inconceivable that \none could ascribe a common theme to the cable operator’s choice \nthere to carry hundreds of disparate channels, and yet the Court \nheld that the First Amendment protected the operator’s editorial \ndiscretion.  512 U.S. at 636.16   \n \n16 Of course, to the extent that one might say that a cable operator is pursuing, \nsay, a “theme” of non-obscenity, the very same sort of thing could be said of \nsocial-media platforms.  See Facebook Community Standards, supra (explain-\ning that Facebook prohibits many categories of content as it seeks to foster the \nvalues of “authenticity,” “safety,” “privacy,” and “dignity”). \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 40 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 40 of 67 \n40  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nIn short, the State’s reliance on PruneYard and FAIR and its \nattempts to distinguish the editorial-judgment line of cases are un-\navailing. \n2 \n  The State separately seeks to evade (or at least minimize) \nFirst  Amendment  scrutiny  by  labeling  social-media  platforms \n“common carriers.”17  The crux of the State’s position, as expressed \nat oral argument, is that “[t]here are certain services that society \ndetermines people shouldn’t be required to do without,” and that \n \n17 We say “or at least minimize” because it’s not entirely clear what work a \ncommon-carrier designation would perform in a First Amendment analysis.  \nWhile the Supreme Court has suggested that common carriers “receive a \nlower level of First Amendment protection than other forms of communica-\ntion,” it has never explained the precise level of protection that they do re-\nceive.

League of Women Voters \nof Cal., 468 U.S. 364, 378 (1984) (noting only that “[u]nlike common carriers, \nbroadcasters are entitled under the First Amendment to exercise the widest \njournalistic freedom consistent with their public duties” (cleaned up)).  More-\nover, at common law, even traditional common carriers like innkeepers were \nallowed to exclude drunks, criminals, diseased persons, and others who were \n“obnoxious to [ ] others,” and telegraph companies weren’t required to accept \n“obscene, blasphemous, profane or indecent messages.”  See TechFreedom \nAmicus Br. at 29 (quoting 1 Bruce Wyman, The Special Law Governing Public \nService Corporations, and All Others Engaged in Public Employment  §§ 632–\n33 (1911)).  Because S.B. 7072 prevents platforms from removing content re-\ngardless of its impact on others, it appears to extend beyond the historical ob-\nligations of common carriers. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 41 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 41 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  41 \nthis is “true of social media in the 21st century.”  Oral Arg. at 18:37 \net seq.  For reasons we explain, we disagree. \nAt the outset, we confess some uncertainty whether the \nState means to argue (a) that platforms are already common carri-\ners, and so possess no (or only minimal) First Amendment rights, \nor (b) that the State can, by dint of ordinary legislation, make them \ncommon carriers, thereby abrogating any First Amendment rights \nthat they currently possess.  Whatever the State’s position, we are \nunpersuaded.   \na \n  The first version of the argument fails because, in point of \nfact, social-media platforms are not—in the nature of things, so to \nspeak—common carriers.  That is so for at least three reasons. \nFirst, social-media platforms have never acted like common \ncarriers.  “[I]n the communications context,” common carriers are \nentities that “make a public offering to provide communications \nfacilities whereby all members of the public who choose to employ \nsuch facilities may communicate or transmit intelligence of their \nown design and choosing”—they don’t “make individualized deci-\nsions, in particular cases, whether and on what terms to deal.”  FCC \nv. Midwest Video Corp., 440 U.S. 689, 701 (1979) (cleaned up).  \nWhile it’s true that social-media platforms generally hold them-\nselves open to all members of the public, they require users, as pre-\nconditions of access, to accept their terms of service and abide by \ntheir community standards.  In other words, Facebook is open to \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 42 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 42 of 67 \n42  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nevery individual if, but only if, she agrees not to transmit content \nthat violates the company’s rules.  Social-media users, accordingly, \nare not freely able to transmit messages “of their own design and \nchoosing” because platforms make—and have always made—“in-\ndividualized”  content-  and  viewpoint-based  decisions  about \nwhether to publish particular messages or users.    \nSecond, Supreme Court precedent strongly suggests that in-\nternet companies like social-media platforms aren’t common carri-\ners.  While the Court has applied less stringent First Amendment \nscrutiny to television and radio broadcasters, the Turner Court cab-\nined that approach to “broadcast” media because of its “unique \nphysical limitations”—chiefly, the scarcity of broadcast frequen-\ncies.  512 U.S. at 637–39.  Instead of “comparing cable operators to \nelectricity providers, trucking companies, and railroads—all enti-\nties subject to traditional economic regulation”—the Turner Court \n“analogized the cable operators [in that case] to the publishers, \npamphleteers, and bookstore owners traditionally protected by the \nFirst Amendment.”  U.S. Telecom Ass’n v. FCC, 855 F.3d 381, 428 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissental); see Turner, 512 U.S. at \n639.  And indeed, the Court explicitly distinguished online from \nbroadcast media in Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, em-\nphasizing that the “vast democratic forums of the Internet” have \nnever been “subject to the type of government supervision and reg-\nulation that has attended the broadcast industry.”  521 U.S. 844, \n868–69 (1997).  These precedents demonstrate that social-media \nplatforms should be treated more like cable operators, which retain \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 43 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 43 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  43 \ntheir First Amendment right to exercise editorial discretion, than \ntraditional common carriers. \nFinally, Congress has distinguished internet companies from \ncommon carriers.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 explicitly \ndifferentiates “interactive computer services”—like social-media \nplatforms—from “common carriers or telecommunications ser-\nvices.”  See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(6) (“Nothing in this section shall \nbe construed to treat interactive computer services as common car-\nriers or telecommunications carriers.”).  And the Act goes on to \nprovide protections for internet companies that are inconsistent \nwith the traditional common-carrier obligation of indiscriminate \nservice.  In particular, it explicitly protects internet companies’ abil-\nity to restrict access to a plethora of material that they might con-\nsider “objectionable.” Id. § 230(c)(2)(A).  Federal law’s recognition \nand protection of social-media platforms’ ability to discriminate \namong messages—disseminating some but not others—is strong \nevidence that they are not common carriers with diminished First \nAmendment rights. \nb \nIf social-media platforms are not common carriers either in \nfact or by law, the State is left to argue that it can force them to \nbecome  common  carriers,  abrogating  or  diminishing  the  First \nAmendment rights that they currently possess and exercise.  Nei-\nther law nor logic recognizes government authority to strip an en-\ntity of its First Amendment rights merely by labeling it a common \ncarrier.  Quite the contrary, if social-media platforms currently \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 44 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 44 of 67 \n44  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \npossess the First Amendment right to exercise editorial judgment, \nas we hold it is substantially likely they do, then any law infringing \nthat  right—even  one  bearing  the  terminology  of  “common \ncarri[age]”—should be assessed under the same standards that ap-\nply to other laws burdening First-Amendment-protected activity.  \nSee Denver Area Educ.

See Miami Herald, 418 U.S. at \n251, 258.   \nIn short, because social-media platforms exercise—and have \nhistorically exercised—inherently expressive editorial judgment, \nthey aren’t common carriers, and a state law can’t force them to \nact as such unless it survives First Amendment scrutiny.   \nC \nWith one exception, we hold that the challenged provisions \nof S.B. 7072 trigger First Amendment scrutiny either (1) by restrict-\ning social-media platforms’ ability to exercise editorial judgment or \n(2) by imposing disclosure requirements.  Here’s a brief rundown. \nS.B.  7072’s  content-moderation  restrictions  all  limit  plat-\nforms’ ability to exercise editorial judgment and thus trigger First \nAmendment scrutiny.  The provisions that prohibit deplatforming \ncandidates  (§ 106.072(2)),  deprioritizing  and  “shadow-banning” \ncontent by or about candidates (§ 501.2041(2)(h)), and censoring, \ndeplatforming,  or  shadow-banning  “journalistic  enterprises” \n(§ 501.2041(2)(j)) all clearly restrict platforms’ editorial judgment \nby preventing them from removing or deprioritizing content or us-\ners and forcing them to disseminate messages that they find objec-\ntionable.        \nThe consistency requirement (§ 501.2041(2)(b)) and the 30-\nday  restriction  (§ 501.2041(2)(c))  also—if  somewhat  less  obvi-\nously—restrict  editorial  judgment.    Together,  these  provisions \nforce platforms to remove (or retain) all content that is similar to \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 47 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 47 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  47 \nmaterial that they have previously removed (or retained).  Even if \na platform wants to retain or remove content in an inconsistent \nmanner—for instance, to steer discourse in a particular direction—\nit may not do so.  And even if a platform wants to leave certain \ncontent up and continue distributing it to users, it can’t do so if \nwithin the past 30 days it’s removed other content that a court \nmight find to be similar.  These provisions thus burden platforms’ \nright to make editorial judgments on a case-by-case basis or to \nchange the types of content they’ll disseminate—and, hence, the \nmessages they express.   \nThe  user-opt-out  requirement  (§ 501.2041(2)(f),  (g))  also \ntriggers First Amendment scrutiny because it forces platforms, \nupon a user’s request, not to exercise the editorial discretion that \nthey otherwise would in curating content—prioritizing some posts \nand deprioritizing others—in the user’s feed.  Even if a platform \nwould prefer, for its own reasons, to give greater prominence to \nsome posts while limiting the reach of others, the opt-out provision \nwould prohibit it from doing so, at least with respect to some users. \nS.B. 7072’s disclosure provisions implicate the First Amend-\nment, but for a different reason.  These provisions don’t directly \nrestrict editorial judgment or expressive conduct, but indirectly \nburden platforms’ editorial judgment by compelling them to dis-\nclose certain information.  Laws that compel commercial disclo-\nsures and thereby indirectly burden protected speech trigger rela-\ntively  permissive  First  Amendment  scrutiny,  which  we  will \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 48 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 48 of 67 \n48  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nexplain.

Ct. 2361, 2378 (2018) (“NIFLA”).     \nFinally, the exception:  We hold that S.B. 7072’s user-data-\naccess requirement (§ 501.2041(2)(i)) does not trigger First Amend-\nment scrutiny.  This provision—which requires social-media plat-\nforms to allow deplatformed users to access their own data stored \non the platform’s servers for at least 60 days—doesn’t prevent or \nburden to any significant extent the exercise of editorial judgment \nor compel any disclosure.18   \n*   *   * \nTaking stock:  We conclude that social-media platforms’ \ncontent-moderation activities—permitting, removing, prioritizing, \nand deprioritizing users and posts—constitute “speech” within the \nmeaning of the First Amendment.  All but one of S.B. 7072’s oper-\native provisions implicate platforms’ First Amendment rights and \nare therefore subject to First Amendment scrutiny.   \n \n18 It is theoretically possible that this provision could impose such an inordi-\nnate burden on the platforms’ First Amendment rights that some scrutiny \nwould apply.  But at this stage of the proceedings, the plaintiffs haven’t shown \na substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that it implicates \nthe First Amendment.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 49 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 49 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  49 \nIII \nA \nHaving determined that it is substantially likely that S.B. \n7072 triggers First Amendment scrutiny, we must now determine \nthe level of scrutiny to apply—and to which provisions.   \nWe begin with the basics.  “[A] content-neutral regulation of \nexpressive conduct is subject to intermediate scrutiny, while a reg-\nulation based on the content of the expression must withstand the \nadditional rigors of strict scrutiny.”  FLFNB II, 11 F.4th at 1291; see \nalso Turner, 512 U.S. at 643–44, 662 (noting that although the chal-\nlenged provisions “interfere[d] with cable operators’ editorial dis-\ncretion,” they were content-neutral and so would be subject only \nto intermediate scrutiny).  A law is content-based if it “suppress[es], \ndisadvantage[s], or impose[s] differential burdens upon speech be-\ncause of its content,” Turner, 512 U.S. at 642—i.e., if it “applies to \nparticular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or mes-\nsage expressed,” Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.S. 155, 163 (2015).  \nA law can be content-based either because it draws “facial distinc-\ntions . . . defining regulated speech by particular subject matter” or \nbecause, though facially neutral, it “cannot be justified without ref-\nerence to the content of the regulated speech.”  Id. at 163–64 (quo-\ntation marks omitted).   \nViewpoint-based  laws—“[w]hen  the  government  targets \nnot subject matter, but particular views taken by speakers on a sub-\nject”—constitute “an egregious form of content discrimination.”  \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 50 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 50 of 67 \n50  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 \n(1995).  They “are prohibited,” seemingly as a per se matter.  Minn. \nVoters All. v. Mansky, 138 S. Ct. 1876, 1885 (2018); see Turner, 512 \nU.S. at 642 (“The government may not regulate speech based on \nhostility—or  favoritism—towards  the  underlying  message  ex-\npressed.” (quotation marks omitted and alteration adopted)). \n1 \nNetChoice asks us to affirm the district court’s conclusion \nthat S.B. 7072’s “viewpoint-based motivation” subjects the entire \nAct—every provision—“to strict scrutiny, root and branch.”  Doc. \n113 at 25 (emphasis added).  It’s certainly true—as already ex-\nplained—that at least a handful of S.B. 7072’s key proponents can-\ndidly acknowledged their desire to combat what they perceived to \nbe the “leftist” bias of the “big tech oligarchs” against “conserva-\ntive” ideas.  Id.  It’s also true that the Act applies only to a subset of \nspeakers consisting of the largest social-media platforms and that \nthe law’s enacted findings refer to the platforms’ allegedly “unfair” \ncensorship.  See S.B. 7072 § (9), (10); Fla. Stat. § 501.2041(1)(g).  But \ngiven the state of our (sometimes dissonant) precedents, we don’t \nthink that NetChoice is substantially likely to succeed on the merits \nof its claim that the entire Act is impermissibly viewpoint-based.  \nHere’s why. \nWe have held—“many times”—that “when a statute is fa-\ncially constitutional, a plaintiff cannot bring a free-speech challenge \nby claiming that the lawmakers who passed it acted with a consti-\ntutionally impermissible purpose.”  In re Hubbard, 803 F.3d 1298, \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 51 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 51 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  51 \n1312 (11th Cir. 2015).  In Hubbard, we cited (among other deci-\nsions) United States v. O’Brien for the proposition that courts \nshouldn’t look to a law’s legislative history to find an illegitimate \nmotivation  for  an  otherwise  constitutional  statute.   Id. (citing \nUnited States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383 (1968)).  The plaintiffs \nin O’Brien had challenged a law prohibiting the burning of draft \ncards on the ground that Congress’s “purpose”—as evidenced in \nthe statements of several legislators—was “to suppress freedom of \nspeech.”  391 U.S. at 382–83.  The Supreme Court refused to void \nthe statute “on the basis of what fewer than a handful of Congress-\nmen said about it” given that Congress “had the undoubted power \nto enact” it if legislators had only made “‘wiser’ speech[es] about \nit.”  Id. at 384; see also Arizona v. California, 283 U.S. 423, 455 \n(1931) (“Into the motives which induced members of Congress to \nenact the [statute], this court may not inquire.”).  Even though the \nstatute in O’Brien regulated expressive conduct and its legislative \nhistory  suggested  a  viewpoint-based  motivation,  the  O’Brien \nCourt declined to invalidate the statute as a per se matter, or even \napply strict scrutiny, but rather upheld the law under what we have \ncome to call intermediate scrutiny.  391 U.S. at 382. \nTo be fair, there is some support for NetChoice’s motiva-\ntion-based argument for invalidating S.B. 7072 in toto, but not  \nenough to overcome the clear statements in Hubbard and O’Brien.  \nIt’s true that the Supreme Court said in Turner that “even a regu-\nlation neutral on its face may be content based if its manifest pur-\npose is to regulate speech because of the message it conveys.”  \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 52 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 52 of 67 \n52  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nTurner, 512 U.S. at 645–46 (emphasis added).  And Turner cited, \nwith a hazy “cf.” signal, Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hi-\naleah, 508 U.S. 520, 534–535 (1993), which held that in the free-ex-\nercise context, it was appropriate to look beyond “the text of the \nlaws at issue” to identify discriminatory animus against a minority \nreligion.  But NetChoice hasn’t cited—and we’re not aware of—\nany Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit decision that relied on leg-\nislative history  or statements by proponents  to characterize as \nviewpoint-based a law challenged on free-speech grounds.19  The \nclosest the Supreme Court seems to have come is in Sorrell v. IMS \nHealth, Inc., in which it looked to a statute’s “formal legislative \nfindings” to dispel “any doubt” that the challenged statute was \n \n19 To be sure, in Ranch House, Inc. v. Amerson, we observed that in deter-\nmining whether a law prohibiting nude-dance establishments had the purpose \nof “suppress[ing] protected speech,” a court could examine the statute’s “leg-\nislative findings[,] . . . legislative history, and studies and information of which \nlegislators were clearly aware.”  238 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir. 2001).  But \nRanch House is largely inapposite.  First, Ranch House seems, at most, to have \nratified the possibility that a legislature’s content-neutral purpose—combat-\nting nude-dance establishments’ “secondary effects”—could save a law that fa-\ncially discriminated on the basis of content.  Id. at 1279–80 (citing City of Ren-\nton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 46–48 (1986)).  That’s the opposite \nof what NetChoice asks us to do here—i.e., to invalidate a facially viewpoint-\nneutral law on the basis of its legislative history.  Second, Ranch House recog-\nnized that the “[s]econdary effects doctrine is an exception to the general rule \nthat a statute which on its face distinguishes among particular types of speech \nor expression by content is subject to the strictest scrutiny.”  Id. at 1282.  We \ndecline to extend Ranch House’s limited endorsement of legislative-history re-\nviews beyond the unique nude-dancing and secondary-effects contexts.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 53 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 53 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  53 \ncontent-based.  564 U.S. at 564–65.  But the only evidence of view-\npoint-based motivation in S.B. 7072’s enacted findings are the ref-\nerences to “unfair[ness].”  Those, we think, are far less damning \nthan the findings in Sorrell, which expressly—and startlingly—\nstated that the regulated speakers conveyed messages that were \n“often in conflict with the goals of the state.”  564 U.S. at 565 (quo-\ntation marks omitted).  \nFinally, the fact that S.B. 7072 targets only a subset of social-\nmedia platforms isn’t enough to subject the entire law to strict scru-\ntiny or per se invalidation.  It’s true that the Supreme Court’s “prec-\nedents are deeply skeptical of laws that distinguish among different \nspeakers, allowing speech by some but not others” because they \n“run the risk that the State has left unburdened those speakers \nwhose messages are in accord with its own views.”  NIFLA, 138 S. \nCt. at 2378 (quotation marks omitted); cf. Minneapolis Star & Trib-\nune Co. v. Minn. Comm’r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 592 (1983) \n(noting that the power to “single[] out a few members of the press \npresents such a potential for abuse that no interest suggested by \n[the State] can justify the scheme”).  But “[i]t would be error to \nconclude . . . that the First Amendment mandates strict scrutiny for \nany speech regulation that applies to one medium (or a subset \nthereof) but not others”:  “[H]eightened scrutiny is unwarranted \nwhen the differential treatment is ‘justified by some special charac-\nteristic of’ the particular medium being regulated.”20  Turner, 512 \n \n20 NetChoice suggests that speaker-based laws trigger strict scrutiny, but on \nour reading of precedent, speaker-based laws don’t constitute an analytical \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 54 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 54 of 67 \n54  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nU.S. at 660–61 (quoting Minneapolis Star, 460 U.S. at 585).  S.B. \n7072’s application to only the largest social-media platforms might \nbe viewpoint-motivated, or it might be based on some other “spe-\ncial characteristic” of large platforms—for instance, their market \npower.  See Appellant’s App’x at 237–46.  Given Hubbard and \nO’Brien—and in the absence of clear precedent enabling us to find \na viewpoint-discriminatory purpose based on legislative history—\nwe conclude that NetChoice hasn’t shown a substantial likelihood \nof success on the merits of its argument that S.B. 7072 should be \nstricken, or subject to strict scrutiny, in its entirety.21   \n2 \nHaving determined that we cannot use the Act’s chief pro-\nponents’ statements as a basis to invalidate S.B. 7072 “root and \n \ncategory distinct from content-based and viewpoint-based laws.  Rather, \nspeaker-based distinctions trigger strict scrutiny—or perhaps face per se inval-\nidation—when they indicate underlying content- or viewpoint-based discrim-\nination.  See Turner, 512 U.S. at 658 (“[L]aws favoring some speakers over \nothers demand strict scrutiny when the legislature’s speaker preference re-\nflects a content preference.” (emphasis added)); Reed, 576 U.S. at 170 (“Char-\nacterizing a distinction as speaker-based is only the beginning—not the end—\nof our inquiry.”).  While the Sorrell Court noted that the challenged law im-\nposed “a content- and speaker-based burden” that warranted “heightened \nscrutiny,” it’s not clear that the law’s speaker-based distinctions would have \nmandated heightened scrutiny had the law not also been content- and view-\npoint-based.  564 U.S. at 570–72.          \n21 Given the somewhat unsettled state of precedent, we needn’t—and don’t—\ndecide whether courts can ever refer to a statute’s legislative and enactment \nhistory to find it viewpoint-based. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 55 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 55 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  55 \nbranch,” we must proceed on a more nuanced basis to determine \nwhat sort of scrutiny each provision—or category of provisions—\ntriggers.   \nTo start, we hold that it is substantially likely that what we \nhave called the Act’s content-moderation restrictions are subject to \neither strict or intermediate First Amendment scrutiny, depending \non whether they are content-based or content-neutral.  See FLFNB \nII, 11 F.4th at 1291–92.  Some of these provisions are self-evidently \ncontent-based and thus subject to strict scrutiny.  The journalistic-\nenterprises provision, for instance, prohibits a platform from mak-\ning content-moderation decisions concerning any “journalistic en-\nterprise based on the content of ” its posts, Fla. Stat. § 501.2041(2)(j) \n(emphasis added), and thus applies “because of the . . . message” \nthat the platform’s decision expresses, Reed, 576 U.S. at 163:  Re-\nmoving a journalistic enterprise’s post, for instance, because it is \nduplicative or too big is permissible, but removing a post to com-\nmunicate disapproval of its content isn’t.  Similarly, the restriction \non deprioritizing posts “about . . . a candidate,” id. § 501.2041(2)(h), \nregulates speech based on “the topic discussed,” Reed, 576 U.S. at \n163, and is therefore clearly content-based.  At the other end of the \nspectrum, the candidate-deplatforming (§ 106.072(2)) and user-opt-\nout (§ 501.2041(2)(f), (g)) provisions are pretty obviously content-\nneutral.  Neither a prohibition on banishing political candidates nor \na requirement that platforms allow users to decline content cura-\ntion depends in any way on the substance of platforms’ content-\nmoderation decisions.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 56 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 56 of 67 \n56  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nSome of the provisions—for instance, § 501.2041(2)(b)’s re-\nquirement that platforms exercise their content-moderation au-\nthority “consistently”—may exhibit both content-based and con-\ntent-neutral characteristics.  Ultimately, though, we find that we \nneedn’t precisely categorize each and every one of S.B. 7072’s con-\ntent-moderation restrictions because it is substantially likely that \nthey are all “regulation[s] of expressive conduct” that, at the very \nleast, trigger intermediate scrutiny, FLFNB II, 11 F.4th at 1291–\n92—and, for reasons we’ll explain in the next Part, none survive \neven that, cf. Sorrell, 564 U.S. at 571 (noting that because “the out-\ncome is the same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or \na stricter form of judicial scrutiny is applied . . . there is no need to \ndetermine whether all speech hampered by [the law] is commer-\ncial”). \nA different standard applies to S.B. 7072’s disclosure provi-\nsions—§ 106.072(4) and § 501.2041(2)(a), (c), (e), (4).  These are \ncontent-neutral regulations requiring social-media platforms to dis-\nclose “purely factual and uncontroversial information” about their \nconduct toward their users and the “terms under which [their] ser-\nvices will be available,” which are assessed under the standard an-\nnounced in Zauderer.  471 U.S. at 651.  While “restrictions on non-\nmisleading commercial speech regarding lawful activity must with-\nstand intermediate scrutiny,” when “the challenged provisions im-\npose a disclosure requirement rather than an affirmative limitation \non speech . . . the less exacting scrutiny described in Zauderer gov-\nerns our review.”  Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 57 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 57 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  57 \nStates, 559 U.S. 229, 249 (2010).  Although this standard is typically \napplied in the context of advertising and to the government’s inter-\nest in preventing consumer deception, we think it is broad enough \nto cover S.B. 7072’s disclosure requirements—which, as the State \ncontends, provide users with helpful information that prevents \nthem from being misled about platforms’ policies. \nB \nAt last, it is time to apply the requisite First Amendment \nscrutiny.  We hold that it is substantially likely that none of S.B. \n7072’s content-moderation restrictions survive intermediate—let \nalone strict—scrutiny.  We further hold that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the “thorough explanation” disclosure requirement \n(§ 501.2041(2)(d)) is unconstitutional.  As for the remaining disclo-\nsure provisions, we hold that it is not substantially likely that they \nare unconstitutional.22  \n \n22 We agree with the State that only those provisions of the Act that are sub-\nstantially likely to be unconstitutional should be enjoined.  The Act contains a \nseverability clause that says that the invalidity of any provision “shall not affect \nother provisions or applications of the act which can be given effect without” \nit.  S.B. 7072 § 6.  Under Florida law, “[t]he severability of a statutory provision \nis determined by its relation to the overall legislative intent of the statute of \nwhich it is a part, and whether the statute, less the invalid provisions, can still \naccomplish this intent.”  Emerson v. Hillsborough County, 312 So. 3d 451, 460 \n(Fla. 2021).  The plaintiff bears the burden to establish that the measure isn’t \nseverable.  Id.  Here, the severability clause reflects the Florida legislature’s \nintent to give effect to every constitutionally permissible provision of the Act, \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 58 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 58 of 67 \n58  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \n1 \nWe’ll start with S.B. 7072’s content-moderation restrictions.  \nWhile some of these provisions are likely subject to strict scrutiny, \nit is substantially likely that none survive even intermediate scru-\ntiny.  When a law is subject to intermediate scrutiny, the govern-\nment must show that it “is narrowly drawn to further a substantial \ngovernmental interest . . . unrelated  to the suppression of free \nspeech.”  FLFNB II, 11 F.4th at 1291.  Narrow tailoring in this con-\ntext means that the regulation must be “no greater than is essential \nto the furtherance of [the government’s] interest.”  O’Brien, 391 \nU.S. at 377.   \nWe think it substantially likely that S.B. 7072’s content-mod-\neration restrictions do not further any substantial governmental in-\nterest—much less any compelling one.  Indeed, the State’s briefing \ndoesn’t even argue that these provisions can survive heightened \nscrutiny.  (The State seems to have wagered pretty much every-\nthing on the argument that S.B. 7072’s provisions don’t trigger First \nAmendment scrutiny at all.)  Nor can we discern any substantial or \ncompelling  interest  that  would  justify  the  Act’s  significant  re-\nstrictions on platforms’ editorial judgment.  We’ll briefly explain \nand reject two possibilities that the State might offer. \nThe State might theoretically assert some interest in coun-\nteracting  “unfair”  private  “censorship”  that  privileges  some \n \nand, with the exception of its argument that the entire Act is viewpoint-based, \nNetChoice hasn’t argued that any of the provisions are inseverable. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 59 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 59 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  59 \nviewpoints over others on social-media platforms.  See S.B. 7072 \n§ 1(9).  But a state “may not burden the speech of others in order \nto tilt public debate in a preferred direction,” Sorrell, 564 U.S. at \n578–79, or “advance some points of view,” Pacific Gas, 475 U.S. at \n20 (plurality op.).  Put simply, there’s no legitimate—let alone sub-\nstantial—governmental interest in leveling the expressive playing \nfield.  Nor is there a substantial governmental interest in enabling \nusers—who, remember, have no vested right to a social-media ac-\ncount—to say whatever they want on privately owned platforms \nthat would prefer to remove their posts:  By preventing platforms \nfrom conducting content moderation—which, we’ve explained, is \nitself  expressive  First-Amendment-protected  activity—S.B.  7072 \n“restrict[s] the speech of some elements of our society in order to \nenhance the relative voice of others”—a concept “wholly foreign \nto the First Amendment.”  Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 48–49 \n(1976).  At the end of the day, preventing “unfair[ness]” to certain \nusers or points of view isn’t a substantial governmental interest; \nrather, private actors have a First Amendment right to be “un-\nfair”—which is to say, a right to have and express their own points \nof view.  Miami Herald, 418 U.S. 258.  \nThe State might also assert an interest in “promoting the \nwidespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of \nsources.”  Turner, 512 U.S. at 662.  Just as the Turner Court held \nthat the must-carry provisions served the government’s substantial \ninterest in ensuring that American citizens were able to access their \n“local broadcasting outlets,” id. at 663–64, the State could argue \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 60 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 60 of 67 \n60  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nthat S.B. 7072 ensures that political candidates and journalistic en-\nterprises are able to communicate with the public, see Fla. Stat. \n§§ 106.072(2); 501.2041(2)(f), (j).  But it’s hard to imagine how the \nState  could  have  a  “substantial”  interest  in  forcing  large  plat-\nforms—and only large platforms—to carry these parties’ speech:  \nUnlike the situation in Turner, where cable operators had “bottle-\nneck, or gatekeeper control over most programming delivered into \nsubscribers’ homes,” 512 U.S. at 623, political candidates and large \njournalistic enterprises have numerous ways to communicate with \nthe public besides any particular social-media platform that might \nprefer not to disseminate their speech—e.g., other more-permis-\nsive platforms, their own websites, email, TV, radio, etc.  See Reno, \n521 U.S. at 870 (noting that unlike the broadcast spectrum, “the in-\nternet can hardly be considered a ‘scarce’ expressive commodity” \nand that “[t]hrough the use of Web pages, mail exploders, and \nnewsgroups, [any] individual can become a pamphleteer”).  Even \nif other channels aren’t as effective as, say, Facebook, the State has \nno substantial (or even legitimate) interest in restricting platforms’ \nspeech—the messages that platforms express when they remove \ncontent they find objectionable—to “enhance the relative voice” of \ncertain candidates and journalistic enterprises.  Buckley, 424 U.S. at \n48–49. \nThere is also a substantial likelihood that the consistency, 30-\nday, and user-opt-out provisions (§ 501.2041(2)(b), (c), (f), (g)) fail \nto advance substantial governmental interests.  First, it is substan-\ntially  unlikely  that  the  State  will  be  able  to  show  an  interest \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 61 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 61 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  61 \nsufficient to justify requiring private actors to apply their content-\nmoderation  policies—to  speak—“consistently.”    See \n§ 501.2041(2)(b).  Is there any interest that would justify a state forc-\ning, for instance, a parade organizer to apply its criteria for partici-\npation in a manner that the state deems “consistent”?  Could the \nstate require the organizer to include a group that it would prefer \nto exclude on the ground that it allowed similar groups in the past, \nor vice versa?  We think not.  See Hurley, 515 U.S. at 573–74.  Be-\ncause  social-media  platforms  exercise  analogous  editorial  judg-\nment, the same answer applies to them.  Second, there is likely no \ngovernmental interest sufficient to justify prohibiting a platform \nfrom changing its content-moderation policies—i.e., prohibiting a \nprivate speaker from changing the messages it expresses—more \nthan once every 30 days.  See § 501.2041(2)(c).   Finally, there is \nlikely no governmental interest sufficient to justify forcing plat-\nforms to show content to users in a “sequential or chronological” \norder, see § 501.2041(2)(f), (g)—a requirement that would prevent \nplatforms from expressing messages through post-prioritization \nand shadow banning. \nMoreover, and in any event, even if the State could establish \nthat its content-moderation restrictions serve a substantial govern-\nmental interest, it hasn’t even attempted to—and we don’t think it \ncould—show that the burden that those provisions impose is “no \ngreater  than  is  essential  to  the  furtherance  of  that  interest.”  \nO’Brien,  391  U.S.  at  377.    For  instance,  §§ 106.072(2)  and \n501.2041(2)(h) prohibit deplatforming, deprioritizing, or shadow-\n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 62 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 62 of 67 \n62  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nbanning candidates regardless of how blatantly or regularly they \nviolate a platform’s community standards and regardless of what \nalternative avenues the candidate has for communicating with the \npublic.  These provisions would apply, for instance, even if a can-\ndidate repeatedly posted obscenity, hate speech, and terrorist prop-\naganda.  The journalistic-enterprises provision requires platforms \nto allow any entity with enough content and a sufficient number \nof users to post anything it wants—other than true “obscen[ity]”—\nand even prohibits platforms from adding disclaimers or warnings.  \nSee Fla. Stat. § 501.2041(2)(j).  As one amicus vividly described the \nproblem, the provision is so broad that it would prohibit a child-\nfriendly platform like YouTube Kids from removing—or even add-\ning an age gate to—soft-core pornography posted by PornHub, \nwhich qualifies as a “journalistic enterprise” because it posts more \nthan 100 hours of video and has more than 100 million viewers per \nyear.  See Chamber of Progress Amicus Br. at 12.23  That seems to \nus the opposite of narrow tailoring. \nWe conclude that NetChoice has shown a substantial likeli-\nhood of success on the merits of its claim that S.B. 7072’s content-\nmoderation restrictions—in Fla. Stat. §§ 106.072(2), 501.2041(2)(b), \n(c), (f), (g), (h), (j)—violate the First Amendment. \n \n23 Even worse, S.B. 7072 would seemingly prohibit Facebook or Twitter from \nremoving a video of a mass shooter’s killing spree if it happened to be re-\nposted by an entity that qualifies for “journalistic enterprise” status.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 63 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 63 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  63 \n2 \nWe  assess  S.B.  7072’s  disclosure  requirements—in \n§§ 106.072(4),  501.2041(2)(a),  (c),  (d),  (e))—under  the Zauderer \nstandard:  A commercial disclosure requirement must be “reason-\nably related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of con-\nsumers” and must not be “[u]njustified or unduly burdensome” \nsuch that it would “chill[] protected speech.”  Milavetz, 559 U.S. at \n250 (citing Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 651).   \nWith one notable exception, it is not substantially likely that \nthe disclosure provisions are unconstitutional.  The State’s interest \nhere is in ensuring that users—consumers who engage in commer-\ncial transactions with platforms by providing them with a user and \ndata for advertising in exchange for access to a forum—are fully \ninformed about the terms of that transaction and aren’t misled \nabout platforms’ content-moderation policies.24  This interest is \nlikely legitimate.  On the ensuing burden question, NetChoice \nhasn’t established a substantial likelihood that the provisions that \nrequire  platforms  to  publish  their  standards  (§ 501.2041(2)(a)), \n \n24 This interest likely applies to all of the disclosure provisions with the possi-\nble exception of the candidate-free-advertising provision (§ 106.072(4)).  Nei-\nther party has addressed that provision in any detail, but it might serve a legit-\nimate purpose in ensuring that candidates who purchase advertising from plat-\nforms are fully informed about the “free advertising” that the platform has \nalready provided so that they can make better ad-purchasing decisions.  While \nthere is some uncertainty in the interest this provision serves and the meaning \nof “free advertising,” we conclude that at this stage of the proceedings, \nNetChoice hasn’t shown that it is substantially likely to be unconstitutional.   \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 64 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 64 of 67 \n64  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \ninform users about changes to their rules (§ 501.2041(2)(c)), pro-\nvide users with view counts for their posts, (§ 501.2041(2)(e)), and \ninform candidates about free advertising (§ 106.072(4)), are unduly \nburdensome or likely to chill platforms’ speech.  So, these provi-\nsions aren’t substantially likely to be unconstitutional.25 \nBut  NetChoice does  argue  that  § 501.2041(2)(d)—the  re-\nquirement that platforms provide notice and a detailed justification \nfor every content-moderation action—is “practically impossible to \nsatisfy.”  Br. of Appellees at 49.  We conclude that it is substantially \nlikely that this provision is unconstitutional under Zauderer be-\ncause it is unduly burdensome and likely to chill platforms’ pro-\ntected speech.  The targeted platforms remove millions of posts per \nday; YouTube alone removed more than a billion comments in a \nsingle quarter of 2021.  See Doc. 25-1 at 6.  For every one of these \nactions, the law requires a platform to provide written notice de-\nlivered within seven days, including a “thorough rationale” for the \ndecision and a “precise and thorough explanation of how [it] be-\ncame aware” of the material.  See § 501.2041(3).  This requirement \nnot only imposes potentially significant implementation costs but \nalso exposes platforms to massive liability:  The law provides for \nup to $100,000 in statutory damages per claim and pegs liability to \nvague terms like “thorough” and “precise.”  See § 501.2041(6)(a).  \nThus, a platform could be slapped with millions, or even billions, \n \n25 Of course, NetChoice still might establish during the course of litigation \nthat these provisions are unduly burdensome and therefore unconstitutional. \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 65 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 65 of 67 \n21-12355   Opinion of the Court  65 \nof dollars in statutory damages if a Florida court were to determine \nthat it didn’t provide sufficiently “thorough” explanations when re-\nmoving posts.  It is substantially likely that this massive potential \nliability  is  “unduly  burdensome”  and  would  “chill[]  protected \nspeech”—platforms’  exercise  of  editorial  judgment—such  that \n§ 501.2041(2)(d) violates platforms’ First Amendment rights.  Mila-\nvetz, 559 U.S. at 250. \n*   *   * \nIt is substantially likely that S.B. 7072’s content-moderation \nrestrictions (§§ 106.072(2), 501.2041(2)(b), (c), (f), (g), (h), (j)) and its \nrequirement that platforms provide a thorough rationale for every \ncontent-moderation  action  (§ 501.2041(2)(d))  violate  the  First \nAmendment.  The same is not true of the Act’s other disclosure \nprovisions (§§ 106.072(4), 501.2041(2)(a), (c), (e)) and its user-data-\naccess provision (§ 501.2041(2)(i)).26 \n \n26 Nor are these provisions substantially likely to be preempted by 47 U.S.C. \n§ 230.  Neither NetChoice nor the district court asserted that § 230 would \npreempt the disclosure, candidate-advertising, or user-data-access provisions.  \nIt is not substantially likely that any of these provisions treat social-media plat-\nforms “as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by” their users, \n47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1), or hold platforms “liable on account of” an “action vol-\nuntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that \nthe provider considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively vio-\nlent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable,” id. § 230(c)(2)(A).       \n\nCase 4:21-cv-00220-RH-MAF   Document 131   Filed 05/23/22   Page 66 of 69\nUSCA11 Case: 21-12355     Date Filed: 05/23/2022     Page: 66 of 67 \n66  Opinion of the Court  21-12355 \nIV \nFinally, we turn to the remaining preliminary-injunction fac-\ntors.  Our conclusions about which provisions of S.B. 7072 are sub-\nstantially likely to violate the First Amendment effectively deter-\nmine the result of this appeal because likelihood of success on the \nmerits “is generally the most important of the four factors.”  Gon-\nzalez, 978 F.3d at 1271 n.12 (quotation marks omitted).  With re-\nspect to the second factor, we have held that “an ongoing violation \nof the First Amendment”—as the platforms here would suffer in \nthe absence of an injunction—“constitutes an irreparable injury.”  \nFF Cosms. FL, Inc. v. City of Miami Beach, 866 F.3d 1290, 1298 \n(11th Cir. 2017); see also Otto v. City of Boca Raton, 981 F.3d 854, \n870 (11th Cir. 2020).  The third and fourth factors—“damage to the \nopposing party” and the “public interest”—“can be consolidated” \nbecause “[t]he nonmovant is the government.”  Otto, 981 F.3d at \n870.  And “neither the government nor the public has any legiti-\nmate interest in enforcing an unconstitutional ordinance.”  Id.  \nTherefore, the preliminary-injunction factors weigh in favor of en-\njoining the likely unconstitutional provisions of the Act. \n*   *   * \nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion \nwhen it preliminarily enjoined those provisions of S.B. 7072 that \nare substantially likely to violate the First Amendment.  But the \ndistrict court did abuse its discretion when it enjoined provisions of \nS.B.  7072  that  aren’t  likely  unconstitutional.
