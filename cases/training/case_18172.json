    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several brought challenging the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s (USDA) classification of &ldquo;socially disadvantaged groups.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>A farmer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee Eastern Division (Jackson) on June 15, 2021. The sole defendant was the Secretary of Agriculture who leads the USDA. Plaintiff challenged Section 1005 of the ARP which provided loan forgiveness to farmers during the COVID-19 pandemic only if they qualified as &ldquo;socially disadvantaged.&rdquo; The USDA defined &ldquo;socially disadvantaged&rdquo; as a farmer or rancher who was from one or more of the following ethnic groups: African Americans, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asians, Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders. Plaintiff alleged this debt relief program discriminated on the basis of race in violation of equal protection. Relief sought included declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney's fees. Plaintiff was represented by the Liberty Justice Center, a non-profit that seeks to protect those claiming their &ldquo;constitutional rights have been violated.&rdquo; Chief Judge S.

VILSACK, in his official  ) \ncapacity as Secretary of Agriculture,  ) \n  ) \n  Defendant.  ) \n \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nDEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS PENDING  \nRESOLUTION OF RELATED CLASS ACTION \n______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nFor the reasons stated below,  Defendant Thomas J. Vilsack,  in his  official  capacity as \nSecretary of Agriculture  (USDA or Defendant), moves to stay the proceedings in this case until \nfinal  resolution  related litigation  that has been certified as a class action under Federal Rule of \nCivil  Procedure 23(b)(2).   \nPlaintiff  Adam Joyner filed  this action to challenge USDA’s implementation  of Section \n1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) on equal protection grounds.  Plaintiff’s \nlawsuit is not the only  challenge  to Section 1005.  Twelve such lawsuits are currently  pending \nbefore courts across the country.  This Court recently granted a request for a preliminary  injunction \nin one of those cases, Holman v. Vilsack, 1:21-cv-1089,  and enjoined  disbursement  of Section \n1005 funds on a nationwide  basis during  the pendency of the litigation.   Two other courts have \ndone likewise. \n1 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 2 of 12    PageID 27\nRecent developments in the earliest-filed  challenge to Section 1005 warrant a stay of this \ncase.  Specifically,  on July 2, 2021,  the Northern District of Texas certified two Rule 23(b)(2) \nclasses of farmers and ranchers bringing  an equal protection challenge to Section 1005 like the one \nPlaintiff  brings here. See Order on Class Cert. & PI, Miller v. Vilsack, 4:21-cv-595  (N.D. Tex.) \n(attached as Ex. A).  At the same time, that court issued an injunction  that (like the one this Court \nissued) prevents the Government from disbursing  Section 1005 funds while the case is adjudicated \non the merits.  Id.  Plaintiff is a member of the classes certified by Miller, and Defendant will  be \nbound by any relief granted to the classes with respect to Plaintiff  should  their equal protection \nclaim prevail.  Thus, continued adjudication  of Plaintiff’s claims in this Court, separate from the \nclasses to which he belongs, would be unnecessarily duplicative  and risk inconsistent  results.  A \nstay, on the other hand, would not prejudice Plaintiff,  who will be bound by and benefit from any \njudgment  applicable to the classes and in the meantime is protected by the preliminary  injunction \nentered by the Miller court as well as this Court.  But a stay would preserve judicial  resources and \nprevent hardship to Defendant, who would otherwise be required to continue  defending  against \nduplicative  claims in separate courts.  For these very reasons, courts routinely  stay proceedings \npending  resolution  of  a class  action—particularly  those  under  Rule  23(b)(2)—to  which  the \nplaintiff  belongs.  This Court should do likewise and stay the case until final resolution of the class \nchallenge to Section 1005 in Miller.1  \nBACKGROUND \nOn June 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed this case, alleging that USDA’s implementation  of Section \n1005, which authorizes debt relief to socially  disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, violates his right \nto equal protection.  See Compl., ECF No. 1.  This case is one of twelve brought in courts around \n                                              \n1 The Government is filing  stay motions in all of the other related cases challenging  Section 1005. \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 3 of 12    PageID 28\nthe country that challenge the implementation  of Section 1005 on equal protection grounds.2  Three \ncourts, including  this one, have preliminarily  enjoined disbursement of programmatic funds.  See \nHolman, PI Order, ECF No. 41; Order on Class Cert. & PI, Miller; PI Order, Wynn, ECF No. 41.3 \nMiller, the first-filed case, commenced on April 26, 2021.  Compl., Miller, ECF No. 1.  On \nJune 2, the five Miller plaintiffs moved to certify two classes of farmers and ranchers, Br. in Supp. \nof Mot. for Class Cert., id., ECF No. 13, and for a preliminary  injunction,  Br. in Supp. of Mot. for \nPI, id., ECF No. 18.4  And on June 30, 2021, the Miller court granted both motions.   Order on \nClass Cert. & PI, id.  Adopting  the plaintiffs’  proposed class definitions  in full, the court certified \nthe following  two classes under Rule 23(b)(2): \n1.  All farmers and ranchers in the United States who are encountering,  or who will \nencounter,  racial  discrimination  from  the  United  States  Department  of \nAgriculture on account of section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act.  \n \n2.  All farmers and ranchers in the United States who are currently excluded from \nthe definition  of “socially  disadvantaged  farmer or rancher,” as defined  in 7 \nU.S.C. § 2279(a)(5)–(6)5 and as interpreted by the Department of Agriculture. \n \nId. at 5-6.  Although Miller certified two classes, the plaintiffs  and the court emphasized that the \nclasses were specific to the plaintiffs’  challenge to Section 1005.  Id. at 13; Class Cert. Reply 1, \n                                              \n2 Miller, 4:21-cv-595;  Holman, 1:21-cv-1085;  Wynn v. Vilsack, 3:21-cv-514 (M.D. Fla.); Faust v. \nVilsack, 1:21-cv-548  (E.D. Wis.); Carpenter v. Vilsack, 21-cv-103-F  (D. Wyo.); McKinney v. \nVilsack, 2:21-cv-212  (E.D. Tex.); Kent v. Vilsack, 3:21-cv-540  (S.D. Ill.); Dunlap v. Vilsack, 2:21-\ncv-942  (D. Or.); Rogers v.  Vilsack,  1:21-cv-1779  (D.  Colo.);  Tiegs  v.  Vilsack,  3:21-cv-147 \n(D.N.D.); Nuest v. Vilsack, 21-cv-1572 (D. Minn.).  Defendant has not yet been served in all of \nthese cases, and the Government does not waive any objections regarding service. \n3 The court in  Faust had entered a temporary  restraining  order on June 8, 2021,  but recently \ndissolved  that order and stayed the Faust plaintiffs’  motion  for preliminary  injunction  in light  of \nthe preliminary  injunction  entered in Wynn.  Order 7, Faust, ECF No. 49.  \n4 Although  the plaintiffs  in Miller assert equal  protection,  Title  VI, and statutory construction \nclaims,  their preliminary  injunction  and class certification  motions  relied solely  on their  equal \nprotection challenge to Section 1005 that is virtually  identical to plaintiffs’ challenge here. See Br. \nin Supp. of Mot. for Class Cert. 4.  \n5 Section 1005 incorporates the definition  of “socially  disadvantaged farmer or rancher” set out in \n7 U.S.C. § 2279(a). \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 4 of 12    PageID 29\nECF No. 41 (“The plaintiffs—at  this point  in the litigation—are  seeking  classwide relief only \nagainst the continued enforcement of the racial exclusions in section 1005 of the American Rescue \nPlan Act.”); id. at 4 (“These classes are being proposed for the purpose of obtaining  preliminary \nclasswide relief against the racial exclusions in section 1005.”). \nAdditionally,  in granting the plaintiffs’  preliminary-injunction  motion,  the court enjoined \nDefendant \nfrom discriminating  on account of race or ethnicity  in administering  section 1005 \nof [ARPA] for any applicant  who  is a member  of the Certified  Classes. This \nprohibition  encompasses: (a) considering  or using  an applicant  Class Member’s \nrace or ethnicity as a criterion in determining  whether that applicant will obtain loan \nassistance, forgiveness, or payments; and (b) considering or using any criterion that \nis intended  to serve as a proxy  for race or ethnicity  in determining  whether an \napplicant Class member will obtain loan assistance, forgiveness, or payments. \n \nOrder on Class Cert. & PI 22-23,  id.  Like the nationwide  injunction  in Wynn and Holman, the \nMiller injunction  precludes disbursement of Section 1005 funds while the case is adjudicated  on \nthe merits.  Finally,  the Miller court ordered the parties to submit a proposed schedule for resolving \nthe case on the merits by July 16.6 \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n“The District Court has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to \ncontrol  its  own  docket.”  Clinton v. Jones, 520  U.S. 681,  706  (1997).   That  power  applies \n“especially in cases of extraordinary public moment,” when “a plaintiff  may be required to submit \nto delay not immoderate in extent and not oppressive in its consequences if the public welfare or \nconvenience will thereby be promoted.” Id. at 707 (modifications  omitted).  \nWhen determining  whether to grant a stay, courts consider multiple  factors, including \n                                              \n6 On June 29, Defendant filed a partial answer and partial motion to dismiss the Miller plaintiffs’ \nnon-Section 1005 claims.  See ECF Nos. 49, 51. \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 5 of 12    PageID 30\npotential prejudice to the non-movant,  hardship to the movant if required to go forward, and “the \ninterest in economical use of judicial  time and resources.”  Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Loc. Union \nNo. 2020, AFL-CIO v. AT&T Network Sys., 879 F.2d 864, 1989 WL 78212, at *8 (6th Cir. 1989) \n(Table).  “Relevant  to this  consideration  is the question  of whether a separate suit in  another \njurisdiction  involves  the same issues and parties and is likely  to consider adequately all interests \nbefore the court considering  a stay.”  Id.  “Allowing  the same issue to be decided more than once \nwastes litigants’  resources and adjudicators’  time.”  B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargus Indus., Inc., \n575 U.S. 138, 140 (2015); see also Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 \nU.S. 800,  817 (1976) (“As between federal district  courts, . . . the general principle  is to avoid \nduplicative  litigation.”).   Courts  should  be mindful  of  the interests  in  “conserv[ing]  judicial \nresources,” “minimizing  duplicative  or piecemeal litigation,”  and “protect[ing] the parties and the \ncourts from the possibility  of conflicting  results.” Baatz v. Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC, 814 \nF.3d 785, 789 (6th Cir. 2016).  When actions involving  the same parties and issues are filed in two \ndifferent courts, stay or dismissal of the later-filed case is the proper course.  Id. \nARGUMENT \nThe Court  should  stay the proceedings  in  this  case until  final  resolution  of the class \nchallenge to Section 1005 in Miller.7  All relevant factors support this proposed stay.  First—and \nmost significantly—a  stay serves the interests of judicial  economy.  Because Plaintiff is a member \nof the classes challenging  Section 1005 and will directly benefit from any relief granted in Miller, \nstaying this case will avoid unnecessarily duplicative  litigation  and potentially  inconsistent results. \nSecond,  a stay will  not  prejudice  Plaintiff,  who  is already  protected by  multiple  preliminary \n                                              \n7 Defendant has not appealed the order granting a preliminary  injunction  and certifying the classes \nin Miller but reserves its right to do so.  If the classes in Miller are decertified for any reason, the \nparties can brief this Court on whether to lift the stay. \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 6 of 12    PageID 31\ninjunctions  and who may receive all the relief he is entitled  to upon entry of final  judgment  in \nMiller.  Third,  a stay would  avoid hardship  to Defendant, who otherwise would  be required to \ndefend against identical claims in multiple courts at the same time—including  in eleven other cases \naround the country.  Finally,  courts regularly stay cases pending resolution  of related class actions.  \nThis Court should do likewise.  \nI.  A stay would promote judicial economy and avoid inconsistent results. \nStaying this case would promote judicial  economy by avoiding simultaneous,  duplicative \nlitigation  of Plaintiff’s  claim  in multiple  courts and protecting  the parties and the courts from \nconflicting  results.  Plaintiff undisputedly  falls within the definition  of the Miller classes: He is a \nfarmer who alleges that he is being subjected to racial discrimination  due to USDA’s provision  of \nSection  1005 debt relief to socially  disadvantaged  farmers, because the definition  of “socially \ndisadvantaged  farmer or rancher” does not  automatically  include  farmers like  him  who self-\nidentify as white.  And the classes in Miller were certified under Rule 23(b)(2), which means that \nPlaintiff  cannot opt out of any judgment  applicable  to the classes. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338,  361-63  (2011).  Thus, any relief ordered in Miller will  apply  equally  to \nPlaintiff as it does to all other class members.  Id. at 361-62 (noting that the relief sought in a Rule \n23(b)(2) class “perforce affect[s] the entire class at once”); Juris v. Inamed Corp., 685 F.3d 1294, \n1312 (11th Cir. 2012) (“Class action judgments  will  typically  bind  all members of the class.”).  \nIndeed, that relief will be binding on Plaintiff and preclude him, like all other class members, from \nobtaining  an  alternative  judgment  in  another  proceeding.  Cooper v.  Fed.  Rsrv.  Bank of \nRichmond, 467 U.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAccordingly,  permitting  Plaintiff  to continue  litigating  his claims  in this Court, separate \nfrom the rest of the classes to which he belongs,  would create a risk of inconsistent  results that \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 7 of 12    PageID 32\ncould  undermine  the  preclusive  effect  of  a  classwide  judgment  and  confuse  Defendant’s \nobligations  to different class members.  See Dunn v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, 836 F. Supp. 1574, \n1584 (S.D. Fla. 1993), aff’d, 193 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir. 1999) (expressing concern with “avoid[ing] \nconflicting  orders”).  For instance, if the plaintiff  class succeeds in its equal protection challenge \nto Section 1005 in Miller but Plaintiff  loses his claim here (or vice versa), Defendant would be \nsubject to conflicting  judgments concerning the constitutionality  of Section 1005 and, importantly, \nits obligations  toward this Plaintiff.  Staying this case pending resolution  of the class challenge to \nSection 1005 would promote judicial  efficiency by avoiding  this risk of contradictory outcomes. \nThat Miller was certified as a class action after Plaintiff filed his case does not undermine \nthe preclusive effect of any classwide judgment  or justify  Plaintiff’s  continued  litigation  of his \nclaims separately in this Court.  Miller was the first-filed case, and under the first-filed rule, “when \nactions involving  nearly identical parties and issues have been filed in two different district courts, \n‘the court in which the first suit was filed should generally proceed to judgment.’”  Baatz, 814 F.3d \nat 789 (emphasis and citation omitted); see also Sutter Corp. v. P&P Indus., Inc., 125 F.3d 914, \n917 (5th Cir. 1997) (noting the concern with avoiding  “piecemeal resolution of issues that call for \na uniform result”).  The parties and issues in this case and Miller are more than “nearly identical”—\nthey are one and the same.  Because Plaintiff  is a class member, this Plaintiff’s claim is being \nsimultaneously  litigated  in two courts.  And because Plaintiff  and Defendant will  both be bound \nby  any classwide  judgment  on Section  1005,  litigating  the cases separately does  not benefit \nPlaintiff; it only burdens judicial  resources at the risk of creating conflicting  outcomes.  \nFurthermore, both cases are still in their early stages.  A proposed case schedule is due in \nMiller by July 16.  Order, Miller, ECF No. 66.  And the sole upcoming  deadline in this case is \nDefendant’s August 30 deadline to respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  Thus, staying this case at this \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 8 of 12    PageID 33\nearly stage of the proceedings  would  not unnecessarily  disrupt  or delay litigation  of Plaintiff’s \nclaim but would only promote its efficient resolution  before any case deadlines have passed.  \nII.  A stay would not prejudice Plaintiff  and would avoid hardship to the Government. \n \nFor similar  reasons, staying this case pending resolution  of the class challenge to Section \n1005 in Miller would not prejudice Plaintiff.  Again, the classes certified in Miller challenge the \nsame agency action and seek the same relief as Plaintiff challenges and seeks here. Compare Pls.’ \nBr. in Supp. of Prelim. Inj. ECF No. 18, Miller (challenging  the implementation  of Section 1005 \nbased on USDA’s interpretation  of “socially  disadvantaged farmer or rancher” with reference to \nrace), with Compl.  (same).  Because Defendant will  be bound  by a final judgment  in the class \naction with respect to this Plaintiff,  staying his duplicative  case in this Court will  not impede his \nability  to obtain the relief he seeks.  And no harm could possibly  befall Plaintiff while his case is \nstayed  and  the  class  litigation  continues,  as  three  overlapping  preliminary  injunctions  are \n“preserv[ing] the status quo” in the meantime.  Order 7, Faust (staying the plaintiffs’  preliminary \ninjunction  motion because the Wynn nationwide injunction  adequately protected the plaintiffs). \nBy contrast, staying this case would avoid hardship  to the Government.  As stated, there \nare currently  eleven  other  substantively  similar  lawsuits  pending  around  the  country,  with \nadditional  requests for preliminary  injunctive  relief pending in some of those cases.8  Particularly \ngiven the importance of the issues at stake, requiring  the Government to defendant against any one \nof them separately from the class action—contending  with differing case schedules and discovery \nobligations—would  run contrary to the Government’s and the public’s interest in just and efficient \nresolution  of all cases, but especially those of “extraordinary  public moment.”  Clinton, 520 U.S. \nat 707 (“[E]specially  in cases of extraordinary  public  moment,  a plaintiff  may be required  to \n                                              \n8 See ECF No. 9, McKinney, 2:21-cv-212;  ECF No. 11, Dunlap, 2:21-cv-942. \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 9 of 12    PageID 34\nsubmit  to delay.” (modifications  omitted)).  Requiring  the Government  to defend against up to \ntwelve  cases  simultaneously—on  varying  schedules  and  in  different  jurisdictions—would \nsubstantially  burden the Government’s (and the courts’) resources without benefitting Plaintiff. \nIII.  Courts regularly stay cases pending resolution of related class actions. \nFinally,  a stay here would be consistent with other courts’ recognition  that a stay (or even \ndismissal)  is generally warranted upon certification  of a class of which the plaintiff  is a member.9  \nSee, e.g.¸ Jiaming Hu v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 4:17-cv-02363, 2018 WL 1251911, at *4 \n(E.D. Mo. Mar. 12, 2018) (“Since class members generally cannot relitigate issues raised in a class \naction  after it has been resolved,  a class member should  not be able to prosecute a separate \nequitable action once his or her class has been certified.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing \ncases dismissing  actions where the plaintiff  was a member of certified class in another case)); see \nalso Mackey v. Bd. of Educ. for Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., 112 F. App’x 89, 91 (2d Cir. 2004) \n(affirming  dismissal  without  prejudice  “based on the rule against duplicative  litigation”  where \nplaintiff’s  allegations  “duplicated  claims that had been included  in separate class actions” against \nthe defendant, and plaintiffs  “were members of those classes”); Aleman ex rel. Ryder Sys., Inc. v. \nSancez, 21-cv-20539,  2021 WL 917969,  at *2 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 10, 2021) (noting  that “the Court \nentered an order staying proceedings” pending  resolution  of a related class action,  “recognizing \nthat the cases are related, and that the resolution  of the issues raised in  the Class Action  will \nnecessarily impact the proceedings in” the case); Richard K. v. United Behavioral Health, 18-cv-\n6318, 2019 WL 3083019,  at *7 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2019),  report and recommendation  adopted, \n                                              \n9 Indeed, federal courts regularly  stay cases when a class certification  motion  is only  pending, \nrather than already granted,  in  an earlier-filed  related case. See, e.g., Sanchez-Cobarrubias v. \nBland, CV609-005, 2011 WL 841082, at *1 (S.D. Ga. Mar. 7, 2011) (reciting case history); Bargas \nv. Rite Aid Corp., CV1303865MWFJEMX,  2014 WL 12538151,  at *3 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2014). \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 10 of 12    PageID 35\n18-cv-6318,  2019 WL 3080849  (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2019) (stay and dismissal  without  prejudice \n“are routinely  found appropriate where, as here, the claims made in an individual  lawsuit overlap \nwith the claims being pursued by a certified class of which the individual  plaintiff  is a member”).   \nIn such cases, courts have ordered a stay of the same scope Defendant seeks here: a stay of \nall proceedings until final resolution of the related class action. E.g., Gonzales v. Berryhill, 18-cv-\n603, ECF No. 28 (D.N.M. Mar. 5, 2019) (staying proceedings until  the district court in a related \ncase “issues a decision on the forthcoming  motion for class certification  and, if a class is certified \nin [the related case], until the conclusion of all proceedings in [that case], including  any appeals.”). \nThe First Circuit’s decision in Taunton Gardens Co. v. Hills illustrates the propriety of a \nstay in  circumstances strikingly  similar  to this  case. 557  F.2d 877 (1st Cir. 1977).  There, the \nplaintiffs  challenged  “the administration  of a major federal program and the disbursement  of a \nsignificant  amount of federal money,” and the case thus “present[ed] issues of ‘public moment.’”  \nId. at 879.  And there, much like  here, the implementation  of that federal program had spurred \nlitigation  “in more than ten district courts” around the country, and the Government  was subject \nto multiple  injunctions.   Id.  Moreover, like this case, a related action was certified as a class action. \nSee Taunton Gardens Co. v. Hills, 421 F. Supp. 524, 526 (D. Mass. 1976).  Although the plaintiffs \nin Taunton Gardens were not members of that class, the court noted that they challenged the same \nprogram and sought identical  relief and, thus, that the class action determined the merits of the \ncase. Id. Accordingly,  the district  court  found  it  was in  “the  interest  of justice”  to  stay all \nproceedings—including  litigation  of the pending  motion  for preliminary  injunction—“pending \nentry of a final  judgment  in the class action case.” Id.  The First Circuit  upheld  the stay, also \nemphasizing  that it was in the “public  interest, the court’s interest in efficient procedures, and the \ninterest of justice” to stay the case and afford the Government “a reasonable opportunity  to resolve \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 11 of 12    PageID 36\nits obligations  in the national  class action.”  557 F.2d at 879.  It also pointed  out that the stay’s \nduration, lasting until an appeal of the class action judgment was resolved, was reasonable. Id.  \nAll of the factors considered by Taunton Gardens support a stay here: Plaintiff challenges \na significant  federal program presenting issues of “public  moment,” and undersigned  counsel are \ndefending against claims in twelve courts around the country.  Additionally,  the recently certified \nclasses in Miller seek the same relief Plaintiff  seeks in this case—and indeed, since Plaintiff is a \nmember of those classes, resolution  of the challenge  to Section 1005  in Miller, and any relief \ngranted by  that court,  will  operate to protect Plaintiff  together with  all  other class members.  \nFinally,  the scope of the stay requested here—until  resolution  of the class action—is the same as \nthat approved in Taunton Gardens and other cases.  There, as here, the “public interest, the court’s \ninterest in efficient procedures, and the interest of justice” support a stay of all procedures pending \nresolution  of the class challenge to Section 1005 in Miller.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should stay proceedings in this case pending resolution of the \nclass challenge to Section 1005 in Miller.  \n   \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 12   Filed 07/16/21   Page 12 of 12    PageID 37\nDated: July 16, 2021        Respectfully submitted,  \n \nJOSEPH C.

(ECF No. 12.) Defendants seek to stay proceedings in this \ncase in light of the certification of classes in the Northern District of Texas that, Defendants argue, \ninclude the Plaintiff in this case.  Plaintiff has responded in opposition.  (ECF No. 14.) Also before \nthe Court is Defendants’ Reply to Plaintiff’s Response. (ECF No. 18.) For the following reasons, \nDefendants’ Motion is GRANTED.  \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiff is a self-described non-minority “small farmer” specializing in growing corn and \nbeans, who lives and works in Gibson, County, Tennessee, which is located in the Western District \nof Tennessee.  On June 15, 2021, Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this case, alleging that the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) implementation of Section 1005 of the American Rescue \nPlan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”) is violative of the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause under \n1 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 21   Filed 08/19/21   Page 2 of 7    PageID 114\nthe United States Constitution.   Section 1005 of ARPA, the Farm Loan Assistance Program for \nSocially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers, appropriates funds to “provide a payment in an \namount up to 120 percent of outstanding indebtedness” of USDA farm loans held by “socially \ndisadvantaged” famers or ranchers.  Pub. L. No. 117-2, § 1005 (2021).  The USDA interprets the \nphrase  “socially  disadvantaged”  to  mean  the  racial  classifications  of  “Black,  American \nIndian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, or Asian, or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.” See American Rescue \nPlan  Debt  Payments  FAQ,  Question  1,  https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq.  \nBecause Plaintiff does not fall under the definition of a “socially disadvantaged” farmer based on \nhis race, he is ineligible for debt relief under Section 1005, notwithstanding his substantial \noutstanding farm debt.  Challenges to Section 1005 are pending in several courts across the \ncountry.  In a distinct case also challenging the constitutionality of ARPA’s Section 1005, Holman \nv. Vilsack, 1:21-cv-1085, this Court has granted a request for a preliminary injunction and imposed \na nationwide injunction on the disbursement of Section 1005 funds pending a resolution in the \ncase.   \nIn their Motion to Stay, Defendants indicate that a related class action, Miller v. Vilsack, \n4:21-cv-595, is pending in the Northern District of Texas.  The court in that case has certified a \nclass  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  23(b)(2)  and  also  enjoined  Defendants  from \nadministering Section 1005’s loan program.  Defendants argue that the instant case should be \nstayed pending the resolution of the Miller case because Plaintiff is a mandatory member of the \nclass certified in Miller and Defendant will be bound by any relief granted to the class with respect \nto Plaintiff should the class prevail on their equal protection claim.  Therefore, because the claims \nbeing litigated in this case and in Miller are identical and are dispositive for this case, Defendants \nargue that a stay is necessary to preserve judicial resources and prevent duplicative litigation.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 21   Filed 08/19/21   Page 3 of 7    PageID 115\nPlaintiff opposes a stay, arguing that Plaintiff would be prejudiced by submitting to the result in a \ncase  over  which  he  can  exercise  no  control  over  the  legal  strategies  employed.    Plaintiff \nadditionally argues that he will be substantially burdened by having to wait for the resolution of \nthe Texas class action and that the Miller litigation is not duplicative in that the Miller plaintiffs \nrequest relief that is contrary to that in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n“A district court’s power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every \ncourt to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for \nitself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). However, \n“it is also clear that a court must tread carefully in granting a stay of proceedings, since a party has \na right to a determination of its rights and liabilities without undue delay.” Ohio Envtl. Council v. \nU.S. Dist. Court, S. Dist. of Ohio, E. Div., 565 F.2d 393, 396 (6th Cir. 1977). When determining \nwhether to grant a stay, courts may consider multiple factors.  The most important consideration \nis the balance of hardships; the moving party has the burden of proving that the non-moving party \nwill not be injured by a stay.  Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Loc. Union No. 2020, AFL-CIO v. AT&T \nNetwork Sys. (Columbia Works), 879 F.2d 864 (6th Cir. 1989) (Table) (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. \n248, 255.) Also relevant is whether granting a stay will further the interest of judicial efficiency, \nparticularly whether a “separate suit in another jurisdiction involves the same issues and parties \nand is likely to consider adequately all interests before the court considering a stay.”  Id. “[T]he \nburden is on the party seeking the stay to show that there is pressing need for delay, and that neither \nthe other party nor the public will suffer harm from entry of the order.” Ohio Envtl. Council, 565 \nF.2d 393, 396. \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 21   Filed 08/19/21   Page 4 of 7    PageID 116\nANALYSIS \n  In considering the balance of hardships, the Court finds that Defendants have met their \nburden of showing that neither the Plaintiff nor the public will suffer harm from the proposed stay.  \nPlaintiff argues that he was not consulted on the approach in the Texas case and that he will be \nprejudiced by potentially being inadequately represented by the plaintiffs’ attorneys in Miller.  \nFurther, Plaintiff asserts that he “owes hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal loans – for which \nmore payments are due, and more and more interest is charged as time goes on” – therefore, asking \nhim to wait in uncertainty for a resolution in the Miller case will be extremely burdensome for \nhim.   These arguments are unavailing considering, first, that this Court and others have imposed \na preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo for Plaintiff and, second, because Plaintiff \nwould be bound by the decision in Miller, regardless of the result in the instant case.   \n  The Court notes that it has issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the distribution of \nSection 1005 funds in Holman v. Vilsack1, which was filed in this Court prior to the instant case \nand is litigating an identical issue.  That case is further along than the instant case, a Scheduling \nConference having been set for September 2, 2021. Therefore, even in the absence of the Miller \ncase, Plaintiff’s status with regard to Section 1005 litigation will be preserved pending the \nresolution of another case, Holman.  Further, as Plaintiff notes in his Response, Plaintiff is not \nrequesting that the definition of “socially disadvantaged farmer” be extended to encompass him.  \nRather, in his “Prayer  for Relief” Plaintiff requests that the Court enjoin Defendants from \nimplementing Section 1005 on the basis of race.  Even if Plaintiff had requested that the Court \nfashion a “non-discriminatory” basis for implementing Section 1005, which it did not, the Court \nwould not be inclined to re-write an act of Congress.  Thus, Plaintiff would still owe hundreds of \n \n1 Holman is distinguishable from the present action because Plaintiff in that case raised an additional claim \nconcerning the meaning of “debt forgiveness,” which is not raised in Miller or the instant case.   \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 21   Filed 08/19/21   Page 5 of 7    PageID 117\nthousands of interest-accumulating USDA loans should the case be resolved in his favor according \nto the relief he requested, undercutting Plaintiff’s argument that he is burdened by the time \nnecessary to resolve this case because of financial uncertainty.  Additionally, while the Court \nappreciates that Plaintiff has an interest in controlling the pace of the litigation and the legal \ntheories employed, that ability would be curtailed to some extent in this Court notwithstanding the \nTexas class action because of the ongoing litigation in Holman.  Also, the Court credits the Miller \ncourt’s finding that counsel for that class action “will adequately represent the interests of class \nmembers similarly situated in zealously pursuing the requested relief.”  (ECF No. 12-1 at 12.)  \nPlaintiff would also not be voiceless as a class member in Miller, as Defendants state, mechanisms \nsuch as intervention are available to him should he wish to raise any concerns in the Texas \nlitigation.  The fact that this case is still in a very early stage, especially relative to Miller, the sole \nupcoming deadline being Defendants’ August 30 deadline to respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint, also \nmitigates in favor of finding that Plaintiff would not be greatly prejudiced by a stay.  On balance \ntherefore, Plaintiff will be minimally prejudiced by a stay whereas Defendants will be significantly \nprejudiced by having to litigate identical cases in two different courts. \n   Not only will Defendants be prejudiced by litigating identical claims in two separate courts, \nbut the judicial system itself will be harmed by the inefficiencies arising from such.  Plaintiff \ndisagrees, arguing that a stay would not serve the interests of judicial economy because the Miller \nlitigation is not duplicative of the present action.  Plaintiff incorrectly states that the class action in \nMiller requests that the court extend the definition of “socially disadvantaged” to encompass white \nethnic groups that have suffered past prejudice and discrimination.  This ignores the language of \nthe Miller court’s certification order which clearly establishes classes only as to the challenge to \nthe validity of Section 1005 on Equal Protection grounds, excluding all other claims, among them \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 21   Filed 08/19/21   Page 6 of 7    PageID 118\nthe request to extend the definition of “socially disadvantaged.” (ECF No. 12-1 at 6) Plaintiff does \nnot dispute that he is a member of the classes which include “all farmers and ranchers in the United \nStates who are encountering, or who will encounter, racial discrimination from the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture on account of section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act”  and “all \nfarmers and ranchers in the United States who are currently excluded from the definition of \n‘socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher,’ as defined in 7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(5)–(6)5 and as \ninterpreted by the Department of Agriculture.”  (ECF No. 12-1 at 5-6.)  Plaintiff also allows that \nthe Miller litigation was the first-filed case and under the first-filed rule, when two federal courts \nhave concurrent jurisdiction, the first court in which jurisdiction attaches has priority over the case.  \nSee Zide Sport Shop of Ohio, Inc. v. Ed Tobergte Assocs., Inc., No. 00–3183, 2001 WL 897452, \n*3 (6th Cir. July 31, 2001) (“The first-to-file rule is a well-established doctrine that encourages \ncomity among federal courts of equal rank.”)  Most compellingly, Plaintiff is bound by the class \ncertification in Miller, which was certified under Rule 23(b)(2).  The Supreme Court has instructed \nthat classes certified under Rule 23(b)(2) are mandatory, providing “no opportunity” for class \nmembers to opt out and not even requiring district courts to afford class members notice of the \ncertification.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 361-62 (2011).  Accordingly, Plaintiff \nwill not be deprived of “his day in court” as he asserts, because he is a member of a mandatory \nclass action litigating the same claim he brings in this Court. Given Plaintiff’s inability to opt out \nof the Miller class action, the identical nature of the class action claim, and the fact that Miller was \nfiled first and is substantially more developed than this case, it is an inefficient use of judicial \nresources to continue litigation in this Court while the Miller case is ongoing.  Judicial efficiency \nmitigates in favor of a stay pending resolution of Miller.  \n \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089-STA-jay   Document 21   Filed 08/19/21   Page 7 of 7    PageID 119\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Defendants have met their burden to warrant \na stay in this case pending the resolution of the class challenge to the validity of Section 1005 in \nMiller v. Vilsack, 4:21-cv-595.  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending \nResolution of Related Class Action (ECF No. 12) is GRANTED.  Plaintiff may move to lift the \nstay for good cause should Plaintiff seek and be permitted to opt-out of the classes in Miller or if \nthe Miller court takes action to decertify the classes of which Plaintiff is a member.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \ns/ S.

On March 11, 2021, the President signed into law the American Rescue \nPlan Act of 2021. Included as Section 1005 of the Act was the little noticed but \nconsequential program at issue in this case: a debt relief program for farmers that \ndiscriminates on the basis of race. Under Section 1005, the Department of Agriculture \nwill provide debt relief to farmers equal to 120% of their outstanding loans—but only \nif  they  check  the  right  racial  box.  This  explicit  racial  preference  violates  the \nFourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal treatment. \n2.  Plaintiff  Adam  Joyner  is  a  small  farmer  in  West  Tennessee  with \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in farm loans that would qualify for the program, if \nnot for his race. He, therefore, brings this action for declaratory and injunctive relief \nto vindicate his right to the equal protection of the law.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089   Document 1   Filed 06/15/21   Page 2 of 8    PageID 2\nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff, Adam Joyner, is a farmer who lives and works in Gibson \nCounty, Tennessee, in the Western District of Tennessee. \n4.  Defendant Thomas Vilsack is sued in his official capacity as the United \nStates  Secretary  of  Agriculture.  The  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA)  is \nheadquartered at 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Washington DC 20250. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This case raises claims under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. The Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1343, and 2201. \n6.  Venue is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial \nportion of the events giving rise to the claims occurred in the Western District of \nTennessee. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n7.  Plaintiff, Adam Joyner, is a farmer in Gibson County, Tennessee, a rural \ncommunity of approximately 49,000 residents in the western grand division of the \nstate. \n8.  After  several  years  working  the  land  of  others,  in  2016,  Joyner \npurchased a farm of his own, totaling 100 acres, approximately 82 of which are \ntillable. Joyner specializes in growing corn and beans. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089   Document 1   Filed 06/15/21   Page 3 of 8    PageID 3\n9.  In order to fulfill his dream of owning his own farm, also in 2016 Joyner \navailed  himself  of  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  Farm  Service \nAgency’s loan program, securing a loan from USDA of $300,000 dollars, in addition \nto a smaller amount of financing from a private bank. As of this filing, Joyner still \nowes approximately $265,000 on his USDA loan. \n10.  On March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act \nof 2021 into law. See Public Law No. 117-2. The American Rescue Plan Act was an \nomnibus  piece  of  legislation  appropriating  $1.9  trillion  for  various  purposes \nostensibly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n11.  Section 1005 of the Act, the “Farm Loan Assistance Program for Socially \nDisadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers,” appropriates money and directs Defendant \nVilsack to use that money to “provide a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of \nthe outstanding indebtedness of each socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher as of \nJanuary 1, 2021” for each farm loan either made directly or guaranteed by USDA.  \n12.  Section 1005(b)(3) defines “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” as \nhaving “the meaning given the term in section 2501(a) of the Food, Agriculture, \nConservation, and Trade Act of 1990,” which is codified at 7 U.S.C. § 2279(a). \n13.  7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(5) defines “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” \nas “a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group.” \n14.  7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(6) defines “socially disadvantaged group” as “a group \nwhose members have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their \nidentity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities.” \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089   Document 1   Filed 06/15/21   Page 4 of 8    PageID 4\n15.  The UDSA’s website for the program explains that under this definition \n“[e]ligible borrowers include those who identify as one or more of the following: \nBlack/African American, American Indian, Alaskan native, Hispanic/Latino, Asian \nAmerican, or Pacific Islander.” This is consistent with the past practice of USDA in \ninterpreting § 2279(a) programs using this definition to provide benefits only to \nmembers of racial and ethnic minorities. \n16.  The  Act  does  not  specify  the  size  of  the  appropriation,  instead \nappropriating whatever moneys necessary. Estimates suggest the total payouts from \nthe Section 1005 program will equal approximately $4 billion. The Section 1005 \nprogram, therefore, provides that some farmers will have 120% of their indebtedness \npaid off, based solely on the color of their skin. \n17.  Section 1005 imposes no requirement that any application show any \nkind of special need, personal experience of discrimination, evidence that the debt \nwas the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or anything specific to the applicant other \nthan his or her race—if you’re a minority farmer, your debt is paid off; if you’re not, \nyou are not entitled to debt relief. In passing the bill, supporters of Section 1005 \nargued that other recent programs to help farmers went disproportionally to types of \ncrops favored by larger, more well-organized farming interests, and Section 1005 \nwould, therefore, provide help to others: \nBlack  and  other  minority-group  farmers  deserve  attention,  said \n[Congressman  David  Scott  (D-GA)]  and  other  Democrats,  because \nTrump-era aid programs were directed toward the major crops, such as \ncorn, wheat, soybeans, and cotton, with big operators getting the largest \nshare of the money. Socially disadvantaged farmers tend to have smaller \nfarms and to grow specialty crops, such as fruits and vegetables. Scott \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089   Document 1   Filed 06/15/21   Page 5 of 8    PageID 5\nalso  pointed  to  the  government’s  admission  in  court  to  decades  of \ndiscriminatory USDA treatment of Black farmers.1 \n \n18.  But the program is not tailored to this justification: if prior assistance \nprograms went disproportionally to certain type of crops, Congress could have passed \na program that assisted growers of previously neglected crops. If prior programs went \ndisproportionally to larger operations, Congress could have passed a program that \nassisted smaller producers. Neither of these rationales justifies a response base solely \nand exclusively on race. \n19.  Joyner has significant farm debt and could benefit from relief. \n20.  Despite  this  fact,  he  does  not  qualify  as  a  “socially  disadvantaged” \nfarmer; therefore, he is excluded from the Section 1005 relief program solely based \non his race. \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nDefendant’s debt relief program \ndiscriminates on the basis of race \nin violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n21.  The allegations in the preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by \nreference.  \n22.  “When the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of \nindividual  racial  classifications,  that  action  is  reviewed  under  strict  scrutiny.” \nParents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, \n719 (2007); see also Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 224 (1995) (“[A]ny \n \n1 https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/multibillion-dollar-debt-relief-for-\nminority-farmers-is-backed-by-house-committee \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089   Document 1   Filed 06/15/21   Page 6 of 8    PageID 6\nperson, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor \nsubject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to \nunequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny”). \n23.  When the government creates race-based policies, it must only do so \n“informed by data that suggest intentional discrimination.” Vitolo v. Guzman, Nos. \n21-5517/5528, slip op. at 9 (6th Cir. May 27, 2021). Broad disparities “are not nearly \nenough.” Id.  \n24.  The fact that there may be a history of social disadvantage for one or \nmore groups does not justify resort to racial classification. City of Richmond v. J.A. \nCroson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 500-501 (1989) (when a legislative body chooses to employ \na  suspect  classification,  it  cannot  rest  upon  a  generalized  assertion  as  to  the \nclassification’s relevance to its goals. A governmental actor cannot render race a \nlegitimate proxy for a particular condition merely by declaring that the condition \nexists) (citing McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 190-192 (1964)).  \n25.  Creating new forms of discrimination to remedy old ones is not a solution \nto past racism. Rather, “[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop \ndiscriminating on the basis of race.” Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 748. \n26.  Even where a policy is not racially discriminatory on its face, it can still \nbe shown to be discriminatory where in practice it discriminates by race in its \napplication. Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267 \n(1977). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089   Document 1   Filed 06/15/21   Page 7 of 8    PageID 7\n27.  In implementing the Section 1005 program, Defendant Vilsack is acting \nunder color of law. \n28.  Plaintiff  is  a  member  of  a  suspect  class  and  is  being  unlawfully \ndiscriminated against on account of his race. \n29.  Plaintiff is similarly situated in all relevant aspects to other farmers \nwho will receive debt relief under the program. \n30.  The Section 1005 program includes an invidious racial classification \nthat discriminates against famers on the basis of race. \n31.  Defendant has a policy and practice of apportioning the benefits of the \nSection 1005 program among farmers on account of their race. \n32.  There is no compelling government interest in Defendant discriminating \namong famers on account of their race. See Faust v. Vilsack, No. 1:21-cv-00548-WCG \n(E.D. Wis. June 10, 2021) at *5 (“Defendants have not established that the loan-\nforgiveness program targets a specific episode of past or present discrimination.”). \n33.  The Section 1005 program’s racial classification is not narrowly tailored \nto serve any government interest. While Defendant may attempt to argue that this \nprogram is needed because of prior discrimination by USDA, “the obvious response \nto a government agency that claims it continues to discriminate against farmers \nbecause of their race or national origin is to direct it to stop: it is not to direct it to \nintentionally discriminate against others on the basis of their race and national \norigin.” Id. at *6. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01089   Document 1   Filed 06/15/21   Page 8 of 8    PageID 8\n34.  There is no important government interest in the racial classification \ncontained in the Section 1005 program. \n35.  The racial classification in the Section 1005 program is not substantially \nrelated to any government interest. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \na.  Declare that Section 1005 of Public Law No. 117-2 unlawfully \ndiscriminates on the basis of race; \nb.  Enjoin Defendant Vilsack from implementing Section 1005 on the \nbasis of race; \nc.  Award Plaintiff his costs and attorney’s fees; and \nd.  Award Plaintiff any other relief to which he may be entitled. \nDated: June 15, 2021   Respectfully Submitted, \n                   s/ Brian K. Kelsey     \n  Brian K.
