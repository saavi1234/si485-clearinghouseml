    "summary": "<p>On July 22, 2019, fourteen Iranian American families represented by a private immigration lawyer filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief and for a writ of mandamus in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (in Santa Ana) to contest the administrative delays in the adjudication of case-by-case waivers to Presidential Proclamation 9645. (Proclamation 9645 was the third of four executive orders issued by President Trump that placed restrictions on people who sought to travel from a number of majority Muslim countries into the US and is referred to as EO-3 below and in other entries in <a href=https://clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=44>this collection</a>). Plaintiffs classified themselves as belonging to one of two groups in the original complaint: “petitioner plaintiffs” who were US citizens and lawful permanent residents, and “beneficiary plaintiffs” the relatives or fiancées of the petitioners who were visa applicants and Iranian nationals. The plaintiffs claimed that the beneficiary group met all the requirements for obtaining family or fiancée based visas before their applications were refused pursuant to EO-3 and that the waiver process provided for by Sec. 3(c) of EO-3 was not properly followed by the State Department. The complaint named (in their official capacity) the Secretary of State, the State Department’s Passport and Visa Examiner, two members of the State Department’s “PP 9645 Brain Trust,” the acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and seven consular officials as defendants. The “PP 9645 Brain Trust” was, according to the complaint, a team within the State Department that promulgated the Department’s rules for the adjudication of Sec. 3(c) waivers. </p><p>The plaintiffs’ claims were based on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. First, the plaintiffs alleged that the federal government violated the APA’s requirement under 5 U.S.C. §555(b) to “conclude a matter presented to it” “within a reasonable time” by failing to adjudicate the beneficiary plaintiffs waiver applications within 90 days. Second, the plaintiffs alleged that the State Department’s “unlawful designation” policy of requiring final approval from consular managers (namely visa chiefs and consular section chiefs) of consular officers’ decisions regarding who should receive a Sec. 3(c) waiver was not authorized by EO-3 and thus amounted to a violation of the APA’s prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action (5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A) and (D)). The due process claims involved both substantive and procedural elements. The plaintiffs argued that the State Department’s policy on Sec. 3(c) waivers infringed on their liberty interest in maintaining the “integrity of the[ir] family unit” and that this policy deprived them of their ability to show that they met the statutory requirements for a visa. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney’s fees to remedy these alleged violations. The case was assigned to District Judge James V. Selna and Magistrate Judge Douglas F. McCormick. </p><p>Five days after they filed their complaint, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on July 27, 2019. In this motion, they asked the district court to declare the government’s failure to “process, adjudicate, and issue” a reasonable decision on the plaintiffs waiver applications unlawful and to order the government to adjudicate waiver requests for the beneficiary plaintiffs within 15 days. Before any rulings were made on the merits of the complaint and preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited production of administrative records on July 31, 2019. Here, the plaintiffs requested the promulgating guidance and policies of EO-3 and argued that this information was necessary so that the waiver adjudication process could be “clearly and definitively defined” for the district court before the hearing on the preliminary injunction. The government filed oppositions to both plaintiff motions on August 16, 2019. Magistrate Judge McCormick heard arguments on this expedited discovery motion on August 27, 2019, and denied the motion on the same day. The magistrate determined that the plaintiffs had not shown that the requested information was necessary for the court to fairly rule on the merits of the preliminary injunction. </p><p>The government filed a supplemental declaration in opposition to the preliminary injunction request on September 6, 2019. In this notice, they informed the court that the consular officer had granted waivers and issued nonimmigrant visas to two of the beneficiary plaintiffs and that a third beneficiary plaintiff was being considered for a waiver. In addition to providing these facts, the government asked the court to deny the motion for preliminary injunction and dismiss the claims of the three plaintiff-families as moot. </p><p>Based on a sentence in the government’s August 16 filing in opposition to the preliminary injunction that said “were the Court to order the State Department to decide the waiver requests within the next two weeks, the State Department would likely deny the waivers on the ground that the national-security and public-safety vetting required by the Proclamation has not yet been completed,” the plaintiffs filed a Rule 11 motion for sanctions on September 9, 2019, against the government defendants and their counsel for what the plaintiffs described as “implicit threatened retaliation.” </p><p>District Judge Selna heard arguments on the motion for preliminary injunction on September 16, 2019, and issued an order and opinion denying the motion on September 24. The court found that the question of whether the requested preliminary injunction would save the plaintiffs from irreparable harm was speculative because there was no guarantee that an injunction mandating the government to process the waiver requests would result in a grant of those waivers. As a result, the court held that the plaintiffs did not meet the high standard necessary for a preliminary injunction. 2019 WL 6841991. The district judge ruled on the sanctions issue on October 3, 2019, holding that the government’s reasoning for opposing the 15 day adjudication mandate requested by the plaintiffs in their preliminary injunction motion was not improper or meritorious of sanctions. 2019 WL 6872902.</p><p>On October 15, 2019, the government filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to state a claim. Before a hearing could be held on this motion, four of the plaintiff families voluntarily dismissed their claims on November 13, 2019, leaving ten families remaining as plaintiffs. </p><p>The district court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on December 3, 2019, and issued an order granting the motion on the same day. While the district court disagreed with the government’s argument that the plaintiffs’ claims were not justiciable under the APA, it was persuaded by the government’s arguments that those claims failed on the merits. First, the plaintiff’s unreasonable delay APA claim failed, according to the district court, because neither EO-3 nor the Immigration and Nationality Act (that EO-3 was issued pursuant to) required a 90 day deadline for the State Department to adjudicate decisions on waivers to visa denials. Second, District Judge Selna disagreed with the plaintiff’s argument that the State Department’s alleged practice of requiring consular section chiefs to agree with consular officers’ determinations regarding waivers constituted an unlawful agency action under the APA (5 U.S.C. §706(2)(a) and (d)) and dismissed this claim. Third, the district court held that the complaint’s Fifth Amendment claim failed, citing the 2015 Supreme Court decision <i>Kerry v. Din</i> (135 S.Ct. 2128), because unadmitted nonresident aliens do not have a right of entry to the US. and because the right to live with non-citizen family members is not a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. Lastly, the court made a finding that the plaintiffs did not adequately allege that the government owed them a clear, non-discretionary duty, and as a result, the mandamus claim was dismissed. Because the plaintiffs’ counsel declined leave to amend at the hearing, the court initially ordered that the dismissal would be with prejudice. 2019 WL 7195621. </p><p>Three days after their complaint was dismissed, the plaintiffs’ counsel filed a paper exaplaining that his decision during the hearing to decline the opportunity to file an amended complaint had been in error; he asked the court to amend its December 3 order to allow for a re-filing of the complaint. The court granted this request in a December 10, 2019 order, amending the dismissal to be without prejudice to allow re-pleading within twenty days. </p><p>The plaintiffs met this deadline and filed an amended complaint on December 30, 2019. Despite their dismissal on December 3, 2019, the plaintiffs included the exact same arguments for their APA claims and mandamus claim in this amended complaint as those in the original complaint. The due process claim was also reproduced in the amended complaint but included an additional four paragraphs that elaborated on why the State Department’s implementation of the waiver scheme constituted a violation of liberty and property interests. The amended complaint added a Fifth Amendment equal protection claim that was not included in the original complaint. In this claim, the plaintiffs argued that new visa applicants seeking waivers to EO-3 have their waivers adjudicated by an automated process that was not in place for the beneficiary plaintiffs and that the failure to use this process for the beneficiary plaintiffs amounted to a violation of their right to equal protection.</p><p>In response to the amended complaint, the government filed another motion to dismiss on January 13, 2020. A plaintiff family left the lawsuit on January 18, 2020, and another family voluntarily dismissed their claims on February 20, 2020, leaving eight families as plaintiffs. </p><p>While a hearing on the renewed motion to dismiss was originally scheduled for March 16, 2020, the district court vacated the hearing date and asked the parties to submit requests for oral argument. The plaintiffs requested a hearing but the district court found that oral argument would not be necessary to decide the motion and instead issued an opinion granting the motion to dismiss on March 18, 2020. District Judge Selna held that the plaintiffs did have standing to bring their claims against the government and that the plaintiffs’ APA claims were justiciable by the district court. However, on the merits of the APA and Fifth Amendment claims, the district court made the same findings as its December 3, 2019, order and opinions. As for the added equal protection claim, the court found that the only distinguishing factor between the plaintiffs and those visa applicants whose claims were processed by the automated system was “when the new processing system went into effect.” Because classifications based on timing are not “suspect or quasi-suspect,” the district court applied rational basis review and held that the system did not violate equal protection. All substantive claims were dismissed without prejudice including the mandamus claim as Judge Selna found that the plaintiffs had not established that the government owed them a “clear non-discretionary duty.” 2020 WL 3051089.</p><p>Two days after the amended complaint was dismissed, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which opened a new docket (No. 20-55325) on March 20, 2020. The case was released from mediation on July 29, 2020, and the parties filed their briefs later that year. The Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for March 2, 2021. However, this hearing was never held because President Biden revoked the travel ban EOs upon his inauguration on January 20, 2021. As a result, the Ninth Circuit held that the case was moot and ordered that the action be dismissed on February 9, 2021. The Court of Appeals noted that President Biden’s <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01749/ending-discriminatory-bans-on-entry-to-the-united-states\">inaugural proclamation</a> which undid the travel ban also directed the State Department to resume visa processing “in a manner similar to that which Plaintiff-Appellants seek in their operative complaint.” 2021 WL 1226734. </p><p>The Court of Appeals issued its mandate on April 6, 2021, ending the case.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This lawsuit, filed July 22, 2019, challenged the State Department’s implementation of President Trump’s September 24, 2019, Executive Order (EO-3) which was the third of four orders by the former President that restricted travel to the US for nationals of majority Muslim countries. The plaintiffs were 14 Iranian American families who claimed that the State Department failed to properly adjudicate case-by-case waivers to the travel ban’s restrictions on visa issuance in contravention of the waiver process that EO-3 itself laid out and sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the State Department’s Constitutional and Administrative Procedure Act violations. District Court Judge James Selna denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction in September 2019 and granted two separate motions to dismiss by the government first in December 2019 and later in March 2020. The plaintiffs appealed the later dismissal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Before a hearing could be held on the appeal, President Biden rescinded EO-3 upon his inauguration; the Ninth Circuit held that the case was moot in February 2021 and issued its final mandate on April 6, 2021, ending the case.",

This case challenges the U.S. Government Defendants’ withholding of case-\n6 \nby-case adjudications of waivers of Presidential Proclamation 9645, Enhancing \n7 \nVetting Capabilities and Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the \n8 \n9  United States by Terrorists or Other Public-Safety Threats. 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 \n10 \n(“PP 9645”). This case also challenges the patterns and policies causing the \n11 \nwithholdings, including Defendants’ usurpation of the authority and discretion \n12 \n13  to approve case-by-case waivers from consular officers, and the designation of \n14 \nthat authority to consular managers, visa chiefs, consular section chiefs, \n15 \nconsular management, the Visa Office, and even non-Department of State \n16 \n17  (“DOS”) employees, such as Quality Support, Inc. contractors, which is \n18 \nunlawful under PP 9645. \n19 \n2.  Plaintiffs in this action are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents \n20 \n21  (“Petitioner Plaintiffs”), other affected family members, and their Iranian \n22 \nnational immediate relatives who are visa applicants (“Beneficiary Plaintiffs”), \n23 \nwho through Defendants’ unreasonable delays, have been denied timely \n24 \n25  adjudication of their case-by-case PP 9645 waivers. These unreasonable delays \n26 \nimpede the Beneficiary Plaintiffs’ ability to immigrate to the United States and \n27 \n28 \n \n \n \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 6 of 55   Page ID #:1530\n \n1  have caused injuries to Petitioner Plaintiffs, Beneficiary Plaintiffs, and to the \n2 \nUnited States. \n3 \n3.  Individually, Plaintiffs fulfilled all requirements to obtain family-based \n4 \n5  immigrant visas, before their applications were eventually refused pursuant to \n6 \nPP 9645 between 15 and 25 months ago (since PP 9645 was implemented). \n7 \nFurther, as Plaintiffs had already experienced unbearable burdens like travel, \n8 \n9  costs, and other administrative delays – sometimes over a period of years - \n10 \nbefore finally getting their visas denied under PP 9645, Plaintiffs’ injuries \n11 \ncaused by Defendants’ delays in adjudicating their waivers are even more \n12 \n13  egregious and heartbreaking. \n14 \n4.  PP 9645 currently prohibits the entry of all immigrants and certain categories \n15 \nof non-immigrants for nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, \n16 \n17  and provides for case-by-case waivers from the ban for individuals who can \n18 \n“demonstrate” that denial of entry “would cause undue hardship, . . .would not \n19 \npose a threat to national security, . . . and would be in the national interest.” \n20 \n21 \nPresidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (Sept. 27, 2017), § \n22 \n3(c). \n23 \n5.  Sec. 3(c) of PP 9645 provides that “a consular officer, or the Commissioner, \n24 \n25 \nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner’s \n26 \ndesignee, as appropriate, may, in their discretion, grant waivers on a case-by-\n27 \ncase basis…” (emphasis added). \n28 \n \n2 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 7 of 55   Page ID #:1531\n \n1  6.  Plaintiffs suffer a range of ongoing harms because of Defendants’ policies, \n2 \ndecisions and actions to unreasonably delay case-by-case waiver adjudications, \n3 \nwhich includes extending an arbitrary and capricious authority and discretion \n4 \n5  to consular managers, visa chiefs, consular section chiefs, consular \n6 \nmanagement, the Visa Office, and even non-DOS employees, such as Quality \n7 \nSupport, Inc. contractors. \n8 \n9  7.  PP 9645 itself requires the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland \n10 \nSecurity to adopt guidance establishing when waivers may be appropriate for \n11 \nforeign nationals who would otherwise be banned. \n12 \n13  8.  Defendants, through a team called the “PP 9645 Brain Trust,” have secretly \n14 \npromulgated guidance on the waiver adjudication scheme that is inconsistent \n15 \nwith PP 9645 itself. To wit, Defendants have disclosed a requirement for \n16 \n17  consular manager concurrence with consular officers on case-by-case waiver \n18 \nadjudications. Further, Defendants have issued guidance that extends authority \n19 \nand discretion over case-by-case waiver adjudications to visa chiefs, and \n20 \n21 \nconsular section chiefs. Finally, Defendants have represented that for a \n22 \nconsular officer to approve a waiver and issue a visa, consultation with \n23 \nconsular management and the Visa Office is required. \n24 \n25 \n9.  Collectively, this means Defendants, through the PP 9645 Brain Trust, have \n26 \nunlawfully extended the authority and discretion - that PP 9645 granted only \n27 \nwith individual consular officers - to consular managers, visa chiefs, consular \n28 \n \n3 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 8 of 55   Page ID #:1532\n \n1  section chiefs, consular management, the Visa Office, and even non-DOS \n2 \nemployees, such as Quality Support, Inc. contractors. Requirements contrary to \n3 \nPP 9645, such as these that extend authority and discretion over case-by-case \n4 \n5  waiver adjudications, demonstrate Defendants’ pattern and policy of \n6 \nunreasonable delay in dealing with waiver adjudication, as well as actions that \n7 \nare arbitrary and capricious. Consular officers are “charged with adjudicating \n8 \n9  visas under rules prescribed by law…’\" Allen v. Milas, 896 F.3d 1094, 1107 \n10 \n(9th Cir. 2018). The PP 9645 Brain Trust’s rules designating authority and \n11 \ndiscretion over case-by-case waiver adjudication to people and departments \n12 \n13  other than individual consular officers,  are rules not prescribed by law. \n14 \n10.  Requirements contrary to PP 9645, such as these that extend authority and \n15 \ndiscretion over case-by-case waiver adjudications, demonstrate Defendants’ \n16 \n17  pattern and policy of unreasonable delay in dealing with waiver adjudication, \n18 \nas well as actions that are arbitrary and capricious. \n19 \n11. Defendants have unlawfully crafted a waiver adjudication scheme that, in its \n20 \n21 \napplication, leads to the ongoing untimely and unfair processing of case-by-\n22 \ncase waivers for Beneficiary Plaintiffs, as well as the case-by-case waivers of \n23 \nall visa applicants similarly situated, and visa applicants who have been denied \n24 \n25 \nvisas as a result of the unlawful waiver adjudication scheme. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n4 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 9 of 55   Page ID #:1533\n \n1  12.  As a result of Defendants’ unreasonable administrative delays, Beneficiary \n2 \nPlaintiffs have waited for travel ban waivers an average of 676 days since their \n3 \napplications were refused pursuant to PP 9645. \n4 \n5  13.  Those days have been filled with unbearable hardships and a constant state of \n6 \ndistress that, absent intervention, will last indefinitely. \n7 \n  \n8 \n9  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n10 \n14.  This Court has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 702, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1361, \n11 \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n12 \n13  15. Declaratory relief is authorized by Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n14 \nProcedure. The Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory \n15 \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act \n16 \n17  (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq. \n18 \n16. Venue properly lies within the Central District of California pursuant to 28 \n19 \nU.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because two Plaintiffs reside in this district, and \n20 \n21  Defendants are officers and employees of the United States sued in their \n22 \nofficial capacities. \n23 \n17. Since at least one Plaintiff resides in the Central District of California, venue is \n24 \n25  proper before this court for all Plaintiffs. Mosleh v. Pompeo, No. 1:19-cv-\n26 \n00656-LJO-BAM, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102765, at *5 (E.D. Cal. June 19, \n27 \n2019); Also see Californians for Renewable Energy v. United States Envtl. \n28 \n \n5 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 10 of 55   Page ID #:1534\n \n1  Prot. Agency, No. C 15-3292 SBA, 2018 WL 1586211, at *5-6 (N.D. Cal. Mar. \n2 \n30, 2018)(ruling only one Plaintiff must reside within the forum district for \n3 \nvenue purposes, and collecting cases holding the same). Plaintiffs PARTO \n4 \n5  KAVOOSIAN, and N.F. reside in Irvine, California.  \n6 \n18. Because Defendants administer a pattern and policy of delay in dealing with all \n7 \nwaiver adjudications, including the waiver adjudications for all Beneficiary \n8 \n9  Plaintiffs, the connection amongst Plaintiffs is sufficient to satisfy permissive \n10 \njoinder requirements. Coughlin v. Rogers, 130 F.3d, 1348 (9th Cir.1997). \n11 \n \n12 \n13  PLAINTIFFS \n \n14 \nParto Kavoosian Family \n15   \n19. Petitioner Plaintiff PARTO KAVOOSIAN and Plaintiff N.F. are U.S. \n16 \n17  Citizens and the daughter and granddaughter of Beneficiary Plaintiffs \n18 \nBEHNAZ KAVOOSIAN and KIYOUMARS KAVOOSIAN.  \n19 \n20. Petitioner Plaintiff PARTO KAVOOSIAN filed a Form I-130, Petition for \n20 \n21  Alien Relative in 2017 for Beneficiary Plaintiffs BEHNAZ KAVOOSIAN and \n22 \nKIYOUMARS KAVOOSIAN and the NVC created a case for the petitions on \n23 \nJune 16, 2017.  \n24 \n25  21. PARTO KAVOOSIAN and N.F. reside in Irvine, California, while BEHNAZ \n26 \nKAVOOSIAN and KIYOUMARS KAVOOSIAN reside in Tehran, Iran. \n27 \n28 \n \n6 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 11 of 55   Page ID #:1535\n \n1  22.  BEHNAZ KAVOOSIAN and KIYOUMARS KAVOOSIAN attended their \n2 \nconsular interview on January 18, 2018, at which time they were notified that \n3 \nbecause of PP 9645, their visa applications and waiver had to go through \n4 \n5  administrative processing. Their applications have remained in that status ever \n6 \nsince.  \n7 \n23. In November 2017, PARTO KAVOOSIAN gave birth to her baby girl, N.F., \n8 \n9  without her mother to help her in the delivery room. She was terrified, and all \n10 \nshe could do was wish for her mother’s presence. The delivery of the baby girl \n11 \nwas supposed to be one of the best days of her life, but instead, it was one of \n12 \n13  the worst. PARTO KAVOOSIAN is desperate to be reunited with her parents. \n14 \n24.  N.F. is growing up quickly and her grandparents are being forced to miss it. \n15 \n25. In addition to working fulltime, caring for a two-year-old at home, and \n16 \n17  worrying about her parents, PARTO KAVOOSIAN is currently pregnant with \n18 \nher second child. \n19 \n26. PARTO KAVOOSIAN’s obstetrician has warned that the increased emotional \n20 \n21 \nstress caused by separation from her parents “could adversely affect the \n22 \npatient’s health as well as the health of her unborn child,” and that \n23 \n“[r]eunification with her parents would greatly help her both emotionally and \n24 \n25 \nphysically.” Her obstetrician also notes “[s]he does not have any other family \n26 \nliving in close proximity to assist her.” \n27 \n28 \n \n7 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 12 of 55   Page ID #:1536\n \n1  27.  As the three-year anniversary for filing her parents’ visa applications \n2 \napproaches, PARTO KAVOOSIAN cannot help but to realize how tragic it is \n3 \nthat the family will never get this time back. \n4 \n5  28. Considerations of BEHNAZ KAVOOSIAN and KIYOUMARS \n6 \nKAVOOSIAN’s waivers have been pending for 720 days, since January 9, \n7 \n2018. \n8 \n9   \n10 \nMansour Hardanian Family \n11   \n29. Petitioner Plaintiff MANSOUR HARDANIAN is a U.S. Citizen and the wife \n12 \n13  of Beneficiary Plaintiff ELAHEH ALIKHAN ZADEH. \n14 \n30. Petitioner Plaintiff MANSOUR HARDANIAN filed a Form I-130, Petition for \n15 \nAlien Relative for Beneficiary Plaintiff ELAHEH ALIKHAN ZADEH, and the \n16 \n17  NVC created a case for the petition on March 21, 2018.  \n18 \n31.  MANSOUR HARDANIAN resides in Boca Raton, FL, while ELAHEH \n19 \nALIKHAN ZADEH resides in Tehran, Iran.  \n20 \n21  32. MANSOUR HARDANIAN met ELAHEH ALIKHAN ZADEH in 2012 \n22 \nthrough friends back in Iran. They started talking and they fell in love. \n23 \n33. MANSOUR HARDANIAN married ELAHEH ALIKHAN ZADEH on March \n24 \n25  22, 2013, in Ankara, Turkey in a religious ceremony. They were issued a \n26 \nreligious marriage certificate that was unlawfully rejected by the U.S. Embassy \n27 \nduring ELAHEH ALIKHAN ZADEH’s first consular interview on February \n28 \n \n8 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 13 of 55   Page ID #:1537\n \n1  23, 2017. They subsequently obtained a government-issued marriage certificate \n2 \nand started the process all over again from scratch. Thus, they had already been \n3 \nwaiting since March of 2013 for an opportunity to reunite and live together as a \n4 \n5  family. Thus, MANSOUR HARDANIAN has been maintaining two separate \n6 \nhouseholds since March of 2013. \n7 \n34.  MANSOUR HARDANIAN’s neurologist has warned him that he is now at a \n8 \n9  higher risk for stroke and that he must eliminate the stress from his life, but he \n10 \ndoes not know how that is possible. He is worried sick for his wife. His \n11 \ninability to do anything to expedite the process causes him to be frustrated, \n12 \n13  which causes him to be angry and thus, his blood pressure rises, and that \n14 \nconcerns his neurologist and his family doctor as well. Currently, he is taking \n15 \nblood pressure medicine on a daily basis. MANSOUR HARDANIAN’s \n16 \n17  neurologist has also wrote a letter stating that having his wife with him, and \n18 \navoiding stress, would greatly benefit his health. \n19 \n35. Additionally, MANSOUR HARDANIAN suffers from diabetes, so despite his \n20 \n21 \nstress, he has to watch everything he eats. \n22 \n36. For important occasions in their marriage, MANSOUR HARDANIAN buys \n23 \nflowers at Whole Foods, and takes them home where he takes a photo of them \n24 \n25 \nand sends the photo to his wife. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n9 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 14 of 55   Page ID #:1538\n \n1  37. In December, MANSOUR HARDANIAN was able to visit ELAHEH \n2 \nALIKHAN ZADEH for the first time in nine months in Istanbul, but the trip \n3 \nwas cut short because her grandmother unexpectedly passed away. \n4 \n5  38. MANSOUR HARDANIAN is extremely depressed, and it is tearing him apart. \n6 \nThings he used to do in the past, like exercise and cooking, he does not do \n7 \nthose things anymore because he no long has joy in his life. \n8 \n9  39. Consideration of ELAHEH ALIKHAN ZADEH’s waiver has been pending for \n10 \n468 days, since September 17, 2018.  \n11 \nMasoud Abdi Family \n12 \n \n13  40. Petitioner Plaintiff MASOUD ABDI is a LPR and the husband of Beneficiary \n14 \nPlaintiff SHIMA MONTAKHABI.  \n15 \n41. Petitioner Plaintiff MASOUD ABDI  filed a Form I-130, Petition for Alien \n16 \n17  Relative for Beneficiary Plaintiff SHIMA MONTAKHABI, and the NVC \n18 \ncreated a case for the petition on November 1, 2016. \n19 \n42. MASOUD ABDI resides in Champagne, IL, while SHIMA MONTAKHABI \n20 \n21  resides in  Tehran, Iran. \n22 \n43. MASOUD ABDI met SHIMA MONTAKHABI in February 2012 while \n23 \nvisiting his family in Iran, as he returned there periodically to care for his \n24 \n25  mother’s chronic health condition. They had much in common, including that \n26 \nthey were both highly educated. SHIMA MONTAKHABI is famous in the \n27 \npharmaceutical field in Iran and has worked very hard in her career. MASOUD \n28 \n \n10 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 15 of 55   Page ID #:1539\n \n1  ABDI immediately realized that she was a very good person, and he fell in love \n2 \nwith her. They married five months later in August 2012. \n3 \n44.  MASOUD ABDI’s separation from his wife has caused him great hardship. \n4 \n5  SHIMA MONTAKHABI is almost 43 years old and desperately wants to be a \n6 \nmother, but her time for this is very limited. Every day, when they talk to each \n7 \nother, she tells him how badly she wants to be a mother. It breaks MASOUD \n8 \n9  ABDI’s heart that, due the travel ban, he cannot give her this wish.   \n10 \n45. Consideration of SHIMA MONTAKHABI’s waiver has been pending for 642 \n11 \ndays, since March 29, 2018. \n12 \n13  Fatemeh Karimi Alamdari Family \n \n14 \n46. Petitioner Plaintiff FATEMEH KARIMI ALAMDARI, is a LPR and the \n15 \nwife of Beneficiary Plaintiff FARSHAD AMIRKHANI.  \n16 \n17  47. Petitioner Plaintiff FATEMEH KARIMI ALAMDARI filed a Form I-130, \n18 \nPetition for Alien Relative for Beneficiary Plaintiff FARSHAD AMIRKHANI, \n19 \nand the NVC created a case for the petition on May 8, 2015. \n20 \n21  48. FATEMEH KARIMI ALAMDARI resides in Lexington, Kentucky, with the \n22 \ncouple’s LPR 14-year-old daughter Plaintiff S.A.(1) and LPR 11-year-old son \n23 \nPlaintiff S.A.(2), while FARSHAD AMIRKHANI resides in Tehran, Iran. \n24 \n25  49. FATEMEH KARIMI ALAMDARI has been a LPR since January 2015, after \n26 \nwinning the Diversity Visa Lottery. At the time she applied for the lottery, she \n27 \nwas married to FARSHAD AMIRKHANI and they had children S.A.(1) and \n28 \n \n11 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 16 of 55   Page ID #:1540\n \n1  S.A.(2). However, when the family attended their interview at the embassy in \n2 \nJuly 2014, they were told there was a glitch in the system and there was no visa \n3 \nfor FARSHAD AMIRKHANI. The family made the difficult decision to come \n4 \n5  to the U.S., counting on the ability of FATEMEH KARIMI ALAMDARI to \n6 \npetition for her husband once they were here, which she did January 2015. \n7 \n50. FATEMEH KARIMI ALAMDARI has been raising their two kids in \n8 \n9  Lexington, Kentucky, without her husband, ever since, and it has been really \n10 \nhard on the family. Her children are always sad. They miss their dad. \n11 \n51. In August, S.A.(1) started high school, and S.A.(2) started middle school. \n12 \n13  These are important milestones that carry with them lot of anxiety, but the only \n14 \nsupport and comfort their father, FARSHAD AMIRKHANI could offer them \n15 \nwas through video chat.  \n16 \n17  52. For half of 11-year-old Plaintiff S.A.(2)’s life, and a one-third of Plaintiff \n18 \nS.A.(1)’s life, the children have been separated from their father. \n19 \n53. Consideration of FARSHAD AMIRKHANI’s waiver has been pending for 753 \n20 \n21 \ndays, since December 8, 2017, the day PP 9645 went into effect. However, that \n22 \ndoes not tell the whole story because his consular interview was more than ten \n23 \nmonths before that, on Jan. 24, 2017, and his original consular interview, for \n24 \n25 \nwhich there was a glitch preventing him from receiving a visa, was in July \n26 \n2014. \n27 \nArash Rafii Sereshki Family \n28 \n \n \n12 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 17 of 55   Page ID #:1541\n \n1  54. Petitioner Plaintiff ARASH RAFII SERESHKI is a U.S. Citizen and the son \n2 \nof Beneficiary Plaintiff BIJAN RAFII SERESHKI, who is 73 years old.  \n3 \n55. Petitioner Plaintiff ARASH RAFII SERESHKI  filed a Form I-130, Petition \n4 \n5  for Alien Relative for his father Beneficiary Plaintiff BIJAN RAFII SERESHKI \n6 \nand his mother, Ghazaleh Sharifi, and the NVC created cases for their petitions \n7 \non April 22, 2016.  \n8 \n9  56. When the couple attended their consular interview on February 23, 2017, \n10 \nGhazaleh Sharifi was issued a visa but her husband, BIJAN RAFII \n11 \nSERESHKI, was not. \n12 \n13  57. ARASH RAFII SERESHKI resides in Carmel, California, while BIJAN RAFII \n14 \nSERESHKI resides in Iran.  \n15 \n58. BIJAN RAFII SERESHKI is lonely and depressed, as his entire family, \n16 \n17  including his wife, lives in the U.S. He is totally alone. Even his nephews are \n18 \nin the U.S. He is the last member of his family who remains in Iran.  \n19 \n59. It is difficult for BIJAN RAFII SERESHKI to miss being a part of his two \n20 \n21 \ngrandkids’ lives. \n22 \n60. ARASH RAFII SERESHKI recognizes that the family can never get this time \n23 \nthat they have been separated back, and that makes him sad. \n24 \n25 \n61. Consideration of BIJAN RAFII SERESHKI’s waiver has been pending for 753 \n26 \ndays, since December 8, 2017, the day PP 9645 went into effect. However, that \n27 \n28 \n \n13 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 18 of 55   Page ID #:1542\n \n1  does not tell the whole story because his consular interview was more than nine \n2 \nmonths before that, on February 23, 2017. \n3 \n \n4 \n5  DEFENDANTS \n \n6 \n62. Defendant MICHAEL R. POMPEO (“POMPEO”) is the Secretary of State. \n7 \nDefendant POMPEO is responsible for implementing and administering PP \n8 \n9  9645 in the U.S. DOS, including the waiver process created by Section 3(c) of \n10 \nPP 9645. POMPEO is sued in his official capacity. By overseeing unreasonable \n11 \nsystematic delays, POMPEO is not applying the system of case-by-case \n12 \n13  waivers that PP 9645 contains, calling the lawfulness of Proclamation itself \n14 \ninto question. \n15 \n63. Defendant JOEL D. NANTAIS (“NANTAIS”) was a Passport and Visa \n16 \n17  Examiner with DOS, but he is now employed as the Director of Domestic \n18 \nOperations, Visa Office, Bureau of Consular Affairs, DOS. On September 9, \n19 \n2019, NANTAIS signed a declaration under penalty of perjury revealing that \n20 \n21  consular officers do not have the discretion to approve case-by-case waivers of \n22 \nPP 9645 because of what he called a “safety feature” in the software. See \n23 \nExhibit B. NANTAIS is sued in his official capacity. \n24 \n25  64. Defendants ERIN R. HOFFMAN, DEAN M. KAPLAN, AND DANIEL E. \n26 \nMICKELSON are DOS employees who are members of what Defendants call \n27 \nthe “PP 9645 Brain Trust.” They are the architects of the waiver adjudication \n28 \n \n14 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 19 of 55   Page ID #:1543\n \n1  scheme’s implementation in a manner that is both responsible for unreasonable \n2 \nadministrative delays, and inconsistent with PP 9645’s waiver provision. They \n3 \nare sued in their official capacities. \n4 \n5  65. Defendant DOS is a federal cabinet agency responsible for implementing and \n \n6 \nadministering PP 9645, including the waiver process created by Section 3(c) of \n7 \nPP 9645, and the family-based immigrant visa program, including but not \n8 \n9  limited to holding visa interviews; conducting administrative processing of \n10 \napplications for family-based immigrant visas; making final decisions on the \n11 \nissuance of family-based immigrant visas; issuing family-based immigrant \n12 \n13  visas; and receiving, adjudicating, and making final decisions regarding \n14 \napplications for waivers under Section 3(c) of PP 9645. DOS is a Department \n15 \nof the Executive Branch of the United States Government and is an agency \n16 \n17  within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). DOS is not applying the system of \n18 \ncase-by-case waivers that PP 9645 mandates, calling the lawfulness of \n19 \nProclamation itself into question. One component of DOS is the National Visa \n20 \n21 \nCenter (“NVC”), which arranges for interviews of Beneficiary Plaintiffs on \n22 \ntheir visa applications. \n23 \n66. Defendant CHAD WOLF (“WOLF”)is the Acting Secretary of Homeland \n24 \n25 \nSecurity and is sued in his official capacity. WOLF is responsible for \n26 \nadministration of the INA by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n27 \n28 \n \n15 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 20 of 55   Page ID #:1544\n \n1  (“DHS”) and for overseeing enforcement and implementation of PP 9645 by \n2 \nall DHS staff.  \n3 \n67. Defendant DHS is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government. \n4 \n5  Its components include U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), \n6 \nCBP, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). USCIS’s \n7 \nresponsibilities include adjudicating requests for immigration benefits for \n8 \n9  individuals located within the United States. PP 9645 assigns DHS a variety of \n10 \nresponsibilities regarding its enforcement. \n11 \n68. PP 9645 states that “The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland \n12 \n13  Security shall coordinate to adopt guidance addressing the circumstances in \n14 \nwhich waivers may be appropriate for foreign nationals seeking entry as \n15 \nimmigrants or nonimmigrants.” \n16 \n17  69. Defendant DOES 3-10 are the consular and other officials employed by the \n18 \nDOS who are responsible for unreasonable delays in the waiver process created \n19 \nby Section 3(c) of PP 9645, including but not limited to designating consular \n20 \n21 \nmanagers, visa chiefs, consular section chiefs, consular management, and the \n22 \nVisa Office with discretion and authority over the adjudication of waivers. \n23 \nTheir identities are not publicly disclosed by the DOS. They are sued in their \n24 \n25 \nofficial capacities. \n26 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n27 \n \n28 \n \n16 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 21 of 55   Page ID #:1545\n \n1  70. Issued September 24, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of PP \n2 \n9645 in Trump v. Hawaii on June 26, 2018, in the context of challenges based \n3 \nupon the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 66 Stat. 187, as amended, \n4 \n5  and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The decision that also \n6 \nlifted an injunction against PP 9645’s enforcement. \n7 \n71. For Iranian nationals, entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants was suspended, \n8 \n9  “except that entry by such nationals under valid student (F and M) and \n10 \nexchange visitor (J) visas is not suspended, although such individuals should be \n11 \nsubject to enhanced screening and vetting requirements.” \n12 \n13  72. PP 9645 provided some examples of circumstances when a waiver would be \n14 \nappropriate, including example “(D)” in which all Beneficiary Plaintiffs in this \n15 \naction fit: \n16 \n17  “(D) the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with \na close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States \n18 \ncitizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid \n19  nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry would cause the foreign national \nundue hardship;”  \n20 \n \n21 \n73. Defendants have implemented a policy that, if a visa applicant does not fit \n22 \nunder one of the waiver examples, but the interviewing consular officer and \n23 \nconsular manager believe that the applicant meets the undue hardship and \n24 \n25 \nnational interest requirements for the waiver for other reasons, the consular \n26 \nofficer must email countries-of-concern-inquiries@state.gov, staffed only by \n27 \nthe PP 9645 Brain Trust and Quality Support, Inc. contractors, and include the \n28 \n \n17 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 22 of 55   Page ID #:1546\n \n1  facts they believe meet the undue hardship and national interest requirements. \n2 \nOnly if the Visa Office concurs that a waiver may be justified, can the visa \n3 \napplicant receive a waiver of the travel ban. These emails are mostly lost, with \n4 \n5  consular officers rarely receiving responses from the PP 9645 Brain Trust and \n6 \nQuality Support, Inc. contractors. This policy unlawfully usurps the authority \n7 \nexplicitly granted to consular officers in PP 9645 §3(c) and serves to defeat the \n8 \n9  purpose and outcome of the PP 9645 waiver provision. This policy is well-\n10 \ndemonstrated by the blue box that is not redacted in DOS’ adjudicator \n11 \nflowchart submitted in the certified administrative record on the PP 9645 \n12 \n13  waiver provision on June 13, 2019, in litigation in the Northern District of \n14 \nCalifornia, Emami, et al. v. McAleenan, et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-01587-JD \n15 \n(N.D. Cal. 2019). See below: \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28   \n \n18 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 23 of 55   Page ID #:1547\n \n1    \n2 \n74. On November 17, 2017, Katherine O. Ray (“Ray”), with Office of Field \n3 \nOperations, Visa Services of Defendant DOS, forwarded an inquiry from Sean \n4 \n5  Whalen (“WHALEN”) with the Office of Field Operations, Visa Services \n6 \nabout PP 9645’s implementation to a group she called “My PP 9645 brain \n7 \ntrust.” Members of the PP 9645 brain trust include Defendants ERIN R. \n8 \n9  HOFFMAN, DEAN M. KAPLAN, AND DANIEL E. MICKELSON. \n10 \n75. On December 13, 2017, WHALEN with the Office of Field Operations, Visa \n11 \nServices, a division of Defendant DOS, sent an email about PP 9645, \n12 \n13  announcing they would begin sending answers via countries of concern, adding \n14 \n“I'll loop back to the brain trust if we need additional guidance/clarification on \n15 \nany of  them.” \n16 \n17  76. On January 24, 2018, Defendant DOS employee Chloe J. Dybdahl,  Attorney \n18 \nAdvisor in the Advisory Opinions Division, Office of Legal Affairs of the Visa \n19 \nOffice, Bureau of Consular Affairs, responds to an email with the subject line \n20 \n21 \n“Iranian PP 9645 waiver case” from Jeremy P. Little, Consular Chief at the US \n22 \nEmbassy in Baku, by asking Visa Office employees she cc’d, including \n23 \nWHALEN and the “countries-of-concern” email address, “do you have any \n24 \n25 \ntemplate waiver requests that could be useful to post?”  \n26 \n77.  In an April 11, 2018 email, Quality Support, Inc. Syria/Lebanon Visa Analyst \n27 \nContractor Kunduz Jenkins, informs Visa Office employees, “we’ve sent today \n28 \n \n19 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 24 of 55   Page ID #:1548\n \n1  refusals under EO 17  for the following PP Waiver [Security Advisory \n1\n2 \nOpinions] back to post: [redacted information] Please let us know if you have \n3 \nany questions.” See Exhibit A. Other redacted emails available in the DOS \n4 \n5  FOIA reading room reveal Quality Support, Inc. contractors Ryan J. Huff, \n6 \nJenny Chang, and Joe Brown also adjudicating waiver requests.  \n7 \n78. Quality Support, Inc. contractors are not employees of DOS, therefore, they are \n8 \n9  not consular officers in any context whatsoever.  \n10 \n79. Since Defendants designated Quality Support, Inc. contractors to make \n11 \nadjudications of the national security and public safety prong of the waiver \n12 \n13  adjudications, it is clear consular officers have been usurped of the authority \n14 \nand discretion to make final case-by-case adjudications, powers designated to \n15 \nthem not by the State Department, but by President Donald J. Trump in the \n16 \n17  plain language of PP 9645.  \n18 \n80. Defendants, through a team called the “PP 9645 Brain Trust,” have \n19 \npromulgated guidance on the waiver adjudication scheme that is inconsistent \n20 \n21 \nwith the PP 9645 itself because it allows for nonconsular officers to make case-\n22 \nby-case waiver adjudications. In addition to the evidence cited above \n23 \ndemonstrating that a Quality Support, Inc. contractor refused multiple waivers, \n24 \n25 \nin a February 22, 2018 letter from Defendant DOS to Senator Chris Van Hollen \n26 \n(“Van Hollen Letter”), Defendants disclosed a requirement for consular \n27 \n \n28 \n  1  “EO 17” is the refusal code for PP 9645 refusals.  \n20 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 25 of 55   Page ID #:1549\n \n1  manager concurrence with consular officers on visa waiver adjudications. \n2 \nFurther, Defendant DOS’s “Operational Q&As on P.P. 9645,”  released \n3 \npursuant to a request through the Freedom of Information Act, also extends \n4 \n5  authority and discretion over case-by-case waiver adjudications to visa chiefs, \n6 \nand consular section chiefs. Also, in an April 11, 2019 “Department of \n7 \nState/AILA Liaison Committee Meeting,” Defendant represented that for a \n8 \n9  consular officer to approve a waiver and issue an applicant a visa, consultation \n10 \nwith consular management and the Visa Office is required. Collectively, this \n11 \nmeans Defendants have unlawfully extended the authority and discretion that \n12 \n13  PP 9645 granted only with individual consular officers to consular managers, \n14 \nvisa chiefs, consular section chiefs, consular management, the Visa Office, and \n15 \neven non-DOS employees, such as Quality Support, Inc. contractors. \n16 \n17  81. On July 8, 2019, Mary Elizabeth Taylor, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of \n18 \nLegislative Affairs, DOS, sent a letter to U.S. Representative Ami Bera, \n19 \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs, Committee on Foreign \n20 \n21 \nAffairs, via a letter confirming that “consular officers confer with both a \n22 \nconsular manager and the Visa Office’s Office of Field Operations prior to \n23 \nissuing a waiver, to facilitate uniform implementation.” The letter also \n24 \n25 \nconfirmed that “(Defendant DOS) determined that, until an automated \n26 \nenhanced screening and vetting process could be put in place, applicants for \n27 \nvisas subject to PP 9645 who are being considered for a waiver under Section \n28 \n \n21 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 26 of 55   Page ID #:1550\n \n1  3(c) of the Proclamation should undergo a post-interview security review by \n2 \nthe interagency (sic) to resolve whether their entry would not pose a threat to \n3 \nthe national security or public safety.” The letter did not define “the \n4 \n5  interagency.” \n6 \n82. According to a report called Presidential Proclamation 9645 Monthly Public \n7 \nReporting -November 2019, between December 8, 2017 and November 30, \n8 \n9  2019, 45,778 nonimmigrant visa applications and 31,534 immigrant visa \n10 \napplications (for a total of  77,312 visa applicants) were refused under PP \n11 \n9645. See Exhibit D. \n12 \n13  83.  According to that same report, in that same period, Iranian nationals accounted  \n14 \nfor 27,250 of the  nonimmigrant visa applications refused, and 13,986 \n15 \nimmigrant visa applications refused. That means 35% of the total visa \n16 \n17  applications affected by PP 9645 affect the visa applications of Iranian \n18 \nnationals. However, for the refusal of immigrant visas, the percentage of \n19 \nIranian nationals affected by PP 9645 is over 44% of the total affected in all \n20 \n21 \neight countries. See Exhibit D. \n22 \n84. From December 8, 2017 to November 30, 2019, Defendant DOS issued only \n23 \n2,610 immigrant visas to Iranian nationals. See Exhibit D. \n24 \n25 \n85. As of November 30, 2019, there were 10,625 immigrant applications in the \n26 \nbacklog from Iranian nationals, which makes up over 64% of the total 16,439 \n27 \nimmigrant visa applications in the backlog. See Exhibit D. \n28 \n \n22 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 27 of 55   Page ID #:1551\n \n1  Overview of Defendants’ Waiver Adjudication Scheme for Iranian National \nImmigrant Visa Applicants Who Attended Consular Interviews Prior to the \n2 \nearly-July 2019 Implementation of Automated Pre-Vetting  \n3   \n4 \n86. The Iranian national immigrant visa applicant applies for a visa, and then \n5 \nappears for an interview at a U.S. Embassy for an interview. Since the U.S. \n6 \n7  Embassy in Iran has been closed since 1979, Iranian national visa applicants \n8 \nmust travel to Armenia, United Arab Emirates, or Turkey for visa interviews.  \n9 \n87. Provided the Iranian national visa applicant otherwise qualifies for the visa, the \n10 \n11  consular officer refuses the visa application of the Iranian national in \n12 \naccordance with PP 9645. The consular office then enters the refusal code \n13 \n“EO17” in the Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) database.  This \n14 \n15  refusal, however, is only part of the process as PP 9645 provides that consular \n16 \nofficers adjudicate waivers of PP 9645’s entry restrictions as part of the visa \n17 \napplication process based on information provided in the standard visa \n18 \n19 \napplication and in-person interview of the applicant. That adjudication is based \n20 \nupon three criteria: \n21 \n(1) undue hardship if entry is denied; \n22 \n(2) entry would be in the national interest; and \n23 \n(3) entry would not pose a threat to national security or public safety. \n \n24 \n88. Based upon these criteria, a consular officer then finds an Iranian national visa \n25 \napplicant eligible or ineligible for a waiver. If found eligible for a waiver of PP \n26 \n27  9645’s entry restrictions, the consular officer has the applicant complete a \n28 \nForm DS-5535 to collect information, including the applicant’s use of social \n \n23 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 28 of 55   Page ID #:1552\n \n1  media. At that point, the consular officer must then seek to obtain concurrence \n2 \nfrom consular managers, visa chiefs, consular section chiefs, and/or consular \n3 \nmanagement and the Visa Office. Defendants require this concurrence before \n4 \n5  the consular officer is allowed to issue the applicant a visa, even though that \n6 \nusurpation of consular officer authority is unlawful under PP 9645.  \n7 \n89. If the consular officer finds that a visa applicant’s situation does not fit within \n8 \n9  one of the examples provided in the text of PP 9645, Defendant DOS, through \n10 \nits Visa Office, instructs consular officers to provide it information about a visa \n11 \napplicant’s undue hardship, national interest, and identity and criminal history \n12 \n13  concerns,  and that they can count on a Visa Office's response “within one \n14 \nbusiness day…” In cases where additional information is needed or if a case \n15 \nrequires further discussion with other offices and agencies, including \n16 \n17  consultation with the PP 9645 Brain Trust, the Visa Office warns that its \n18 \nresponse \"could take a week or more.”  \n19 \n90. If found ineligible for a waiver of PP 9645’s entry restrictions, the consular \n20 \n21 \nofficer may, upon reconsideration, and concurrence from consular managers, \n22 \nvisa chiefs, consular section chiefs, and/or consular management the Visa \n23 \nOffice, and even non-DOS employees, such as Quality Support, Inc. \n24 \n25 \ncontractors (pursuant to Defendants’ implementation of PP 9645 waiver \n26 \nprovision), find the applicant eligible for a waiver of PP 9645’s entry \n27 \nrestrictions and issue the applicant a visa. \n28 \n \n24 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 29 of 55   Page ID #:1553\n \n1  91. Defendants represent that waiver adjudication eligibility is automatic. \n2 \nDefendants also represent that waiver adjudication eligibility is not \n3 \nautomatic. In the Van Hollen Letter, DOS states that in order to be considered \n4 \n5  for a waiver, visa applicants must meet the criteria for a waiver. Under that \n6 \nrepresentation, all applicants who are under waiver consideration have already \n7 \nbeen found by a consular officer to meet all criteria for a waiver, and the only \n8 \n9  fruit of further administrative processing is unreasonable administrative delay. \n10 \n92. Defendants have unlawfully extended the authority and discretion that PP 9645 \n11 \ngranted only with individual consular officers to: consular managers, visa \n12 \n13  chiefs, consular section chiefs, consular management, the Visa Office, and \n14 \neven non-DOS employees, such as Quality Support, Inc. contractors.  \n15 \n93. As consular officers typically want to issue visas, especially to women, \n16 \n17  children, the elderly, and families experiencing hardship - all of whom have \n18 \nalready been vetted to get to the consular interview stage- this unlawful and \n19 \nunnecessary usurpation of consular officer authority and discretion \n20 \n21 \ndemonstrates how and why the travel ban itself is a boondoggle of a \n22 \ngovernment program that, absent judicial interference, will continue to cause \n23 \nsenseless irreparable injuries to American families.  \n24 \n25 \n94. When Defendants do adjudicate PP 9645 waivers, which belies the norm, they \n26 \ndo not adjudicate them in order, as they do with other immigration benefits. In \n27 \nfact, on November 12, 2019, Defendants, through Department of Justice \n28 \n \n25 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 30 of 55   Page ID #:1554\n \n1  counsel Joseph A. Darrow, admitted “Defendants were employing a figure of \n2 \nspeech and did not, of course, mean that every waiver applicant had been \n3 \nassigned one specific number in line and that Defendants were proceeding \n4 \n5  number by number, as if at a deli counter.”   \n6 \n95. On July 18, 2019, the Foreign Affairs Manual, section 9 FAM 302.14-10(E)(2), \n7 \nwas updated giving consular officers five specific instructions again usurping \n8 \n9  their authority and discretion to adjudicate case-by-case waivers, even after the \n10 \nVisa Office has concurred that those waivers may be justified. Defendants have \n11 \nkept these instructions secret from visa applicants subject to PP 9645, as well \n12 \n13  as the general public, by redacting them when released by asserting law \n14 \nenforcement privilege. See below. \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n \n28 \n \n26 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 31 of 55   Page ID #:1555\n \n1  96. In early July 2019, Defendants DOS implemented a new enhanced automated \n2 \nscreening and vetting process for all immigrant and nonimmigrant visa \n3 \napplicants subject to the Proclamation. The new enhanced review is automated, \n4 \n5  occurs prior to the interview, and provides consular officers with the \n6 \ninformation required to make most P.P. 9645 waiver determinations much \n7 \nmore quickly. It is now possible that many cases may be issued within days of \n8 \n9  the application, should the security check done prior to the interview not show \n10 \nany concerns – once the consular officer has established all three criterion of \n11 \nthe waiver, the visa may be issued. However, this is not the case with visa \n12 \n13  applicants like Beneficiary Plaintiffs, who have already had their interviews, \n14 \nand are not benefitting from the automated system. See Exhibit C, at 3. \n15 \nConsequences of Defendants’ Waiver Adjudication Scheme on Plaintiffs \n16 \n17  97. As a direct result of Defendants’ PP 9645 waiver adjudication scheme, \n18 \nBeneficiary Plaintiffs in this action have waited unreasonable amounts of time, \n19 \nfrom 468 up to 753 days, for the adjudication of their waivers. See Table A, \n20 \n21 \nbelow. \n22 \n \n23 \n \n24 \n25 \n \n26 \n \n27 \n \n28 \n \n27 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 32 of 55   Page ID #:1556\n \n1  Table A \n \n2 \nU.S. CITIZEN OR LEGAL  IRANIAN NATIONAL  DATE CASE  DATE VISA REFUSED  DAYS \n     \nPERMANENT RESIDENT BENEFICIARIES CREATED BY  UNDER PP 9645  AWAITING \n3     \nPETITIONER  NVC  WAIVER \n(per CEAC  ADJUDICATION \n4  website)   (as of Dec. 30, \n \n2019)\n5 \nParto   Behnaz Kavoosian;  16-JUNE-2017  09-JAN-2018  720 \nKavoosian   Kiyoumars Kavoosian  &   720 \n6  16-JUN-2017  \n7  Mansour Hardanian   Elaheh Alikhan Zadeh    21-MAR-2018  17-SEP-2018  468 \n8 \nMasoud Abdi  Shima Montakhabi   01-NOV-2016   29-MAR-2018  642 \n9 \n10  Fatemeh Karimi  Farshad Amirkhani   08-MAY-2015  08-DEC-2017  753 \nAlamdari  * \n11 \nArash Rafii Sereshki    Bijan Rafii Sereshki   22-APR-2016  08-DEC-2017  753 \n12  ** \n*FARSHAD AMIRKHANI’s consular interview was Jan. 24, 2017, but PP 9645 was technically \n13 \nnot implemented until December 08, 2017. \n14  ** BIJAN RAFII SERESHKI’s consular interview was Feb. 23, 2017, but PP 9645 was technically \nnot implemented until December 08, 2017. \n15 \n- \n16 \n98. As a result of Defendants’ withholding of adjudications of travel ban waivers, \n17 \nvisa applicants, and all Beneficiary Plaintiffs in this action, suffer unreasonable \n18 \n19 \nhardship as their criminal status checks, medical examinations, and security \n20 \nadvisor opinions perpetually expire during the post-refusal administrative \n21 \nprocessing. This perverse outcome leads to visa applicants, including Plaintiffs \n22 \n23 \nin the action, repeatedly incurring expenses for no good reason.   \n24 \n99. In the statistically unlikely event that stars align so that all the parties \n25 \nunlawfully designated by Defendants with authority over waiver adjudication \n26 \n27 \nconcur that an applicant is deserving of a waiver, that applicant must act \n28 \nquickly because, of course, the waivers themselves expire as well. \n \n28 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 33 of 55   Page ID #:1557\n \n1  100.  As a result of Defendants’ unreasonable administrative delays in the \n2 \nadjudication of travel ban waivers, Iranian nationals visa applicants, including \n3 \nsome of the Plaintiffs in this action, are stranded in third countries different \n4 \n5  from their national origin. The cost of maintaining a separate residence in a \n6 \nforeign country is financially draining on Plaintiffs. \n7 \n101.  As a result of Defendants’ unreasonable administrative delays in the \n8 \n9  adjudication of their waiver, Plaintiffs have faced severe familial hardships. \n10 \nFor example, Plaintiffs MASOUD ABDI and SHIMA MONTAKHABI dream \n11 \nof starting a family, but she is 42 years old and the window for their dream is \n12 \n13  closing. In another example, Beneficiary Plaintiff BIJAN RAFII SERESHKI, \n14 \nwho is 73 years old, continues to be separated from his wife of many years, \n15 \nbecause following their consular interview on February 23, 2017, her visa was \n16 \n17  issued while his went into administrative processing. In another example, \n18 \nPlaintiff MANSOUR HARDANIAN married his wife in 2013 and they have \n19 \nwaited nearly SEVEN years to be together. In another example, Plaintiff N.F. \n20 \n21 \nis now two years old and she still has not met her grandparents in person.  \n22 \n102.  As a result of Defendants’ unreasonable administrative delays in the \n23 \nadjudication of their waiver, Plaintiffs have faced all kinds of severe economic \n24 \n25 \nhardship. For example, Plaintiff MASOUD ABDI is limited in how he can \n26 \nassist his wife financially because of U.S. sanctions.  \n27 \n28 \n \n29 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 34 of 55   Page ID #:1558\n \n1  103.  Beneficiary Plaintiffs have faced a uniquely severe economic hardship \n2 \nbecause, unlike most families on earth, their loved ones in the United States are \n3 \nprohibited from giving them financial assistance due to the sanctions against \n4 \n5  Iran. \n6 \n104.  Plaintiffs have also faced severe economic hardship for the costs of \n7 \nvisiting each other as a substitute for reunification. However, because of the \n8 \n9  expense of a visit for their family, FATEMEH KARIMI ALAMDARI, SA.(1), \n10 \nand S.A.(2), who have been separated from FARSHAD AMIRKHANI, her \n11 \nhusband and their father, since 2014, have only been able to afford one short \n12 \n13  visit in the summer of 2015, nearly five years ago. \n14 \n105.  Further, since Iran is so dangerous for U.S. citizens and, in fact, \n15 \nDefendant DOS advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran, many of Plaintiffs’ \n16 \n17  family visits were in other countries, further exacerbating Plaintiffs’ hardship. \n18 \nFor example, Plaintiff MANSOUR HARDANIAN has spent between $7,000-\n19 \n$8,000 on each visit with his wife in third countries such as Turkey, and that is \n20 \n21 \nfor trips of only a couple weeks in duration at most. MANSOUR \n22 \nHARDANIAN says the beginning of the visits are great, but the end, when he \n23 \nmust leave the airport without his wife, there is sadness and he is devastated. \n24 \n25 \n106.  Plaintiffs have also faced economic hardship in the form of missed \n26 \nopportunities. For example, Plaintiff MASOUD ABDI has not had the time or \n27 \nenergy to continue his professional education as a physician and study for other \n28 \n \n30 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 35 of 55   Page ID #:1559\n \n1  exams and certifications to further his career. He is working 10 to 12 hours a \n2 \nday without days off to support two households and pay for expenses incurred \n3 \nas a result of Defendants’ withholding of his wife’s waiver adjudication. \n4 \n5  107.  If not for Defendants’ unreasonable delays, Plaintiffs would not be \n6 \nsuffering their current state of anxiety connected to the active conflict between \n7 \nthe United States and Iran. While Plaintiffs have awaited their PP 9645 waiver \n8 \n9  adjudication, the conflict between the U.S. and Iran continues to escalate, \n10 \namplifying Plaintiffs’ anxiety. Sample moments of anxiety-causing \n11 \nescalation include: \n12 \n13  •  May 8, 2018: President Trump announces that the U.S. will pull out of the Iran \nnuclear deal.  \n14 \n•  August 2018: U.S. implements sanctions against Iran.  \n•  November 2018: U.S. implements more sanctions against Iran.  \n15 \n•  April 8, 2019: the President designates the IRGC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \n16  •  April 2019: U.S. implements more sanctions against Iran.  \n•  May 5, 2019: National Security Adviser John Bolton issues a statement referring to \n17  impending Iranian attacks and announces U.S. aircraft carrier is en route to the \nregion. \n18 \n•  May 8, 2019: On the anniversary of Trump’s withdrawal of Iran nuclear deal, Iran \nannounces it will increase uranium production. \n19 \n•  May 9, 2019: Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presents plans for 120,000 \n20  U.S. troops to be deployed to the Middle East in the event of an Iranian attack. \n•  May 10, 2019: The U.S. sends additional military hardware, including a warship, to \n21  the Middle East.  \n•  May 12, 2019: Four oil tankers — two Saudi, one Emirati, one Norwegian — are \n22 \nattacked near the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. later accuses Iran. \n23  •  May 14, 2019: Armed drones strike two Saudi pumping stations. Houthi rebels \noperating in Yemen, who the U.S. alleges are backed by Iran, claim responsibility. \n24  •  May 15, 2019: The U.S. orders a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq. \n•  June 13, 2019: Two tankers, one Norwegian and one Japanese, are struck near the \n25 \nStrait of Hormuz. In a statement, Defendant POMPEO bundles the attack with four \nincidents he alleges were carried out by surrogates, declaring they collectively \n26 \n“present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the \n27  freedom of navigation, and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran.” \n•  June 17, 2019: Iran announces that it will breach uranium enrichment levels under \n28  the 2015 deal in 10 days. \n \n31 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 36 of 55   Page ID #:1560\n \n1  •  June 17, 2019: The U.S. announces it will send an additional 1,000 troops to the \nMiddle East. \n2 \n•  June 20, 2019: Iran shoots down a U.S. drone it says was in its airspace. The U.S. \nprovides evidence it was over international waters. \n3 \n•  June 20, 2019: Trump tweets “Iran made a very big mistake!” He then approves \n4  strikes \"on a handful of Iranian targets\" but calls them off at the last minute. \n•  June 21, 2019: Iranian officials tell Reuters they received a message from Trump \n5  warning of impending U.S. attacks and seeking dialogue as Trump confirms he felt \nthe planned strikes were \"not proportionate.\" \n6 \n•  June 24, 2019: President Trump announces new sanctions and tells reporters that he \ndid not need congressional consent for an initial strike on Iran. \n7 \n•  June 28, 2019: U.S. deploys nearly a dozen F-22 Raptor fighter jets to Qatar to \n8  \"defend American forces and interests\". \n•  July 16, 2019: U.S. announces it will send another 1,000 troops to the Middle East to \n9  counter Tehran, adding to the many thousands already in the region. \n•  July 18, 2019: U.S. claims to have taken defensive action against a drone in the \n10 \nPersian Gulf, but Iran denies any of the country’s drones were brought down. \n•  July 19, 2019: Saudi King Salman approves hosting US Armed Forces in the \n11 \nKingdom.  \n12  •  July 20, 2019: Iran seizes British tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. \n•  July 21, 2019: Brazil, pursuant to stranglehold sanctions imposed by the U.S., \n13  refuses to refuel ships picking up grain from Brazil, stranding both the ships, and the \ngrain from the people who need it.  \n14 \n•  August 16, 2019: US files complaint for forfeiture of oil aboard Iranian tanker Grace \nI in U.S. District Court for District of Columbia. \n15 \n•  Sept. 14, 2019: Defendant Secretary of State Pompeo blames Iran for armed drone \n16  attacks on Saudi Arabia’s massive Abqaiq oil processing facility, even though \nYemen's Houthi rebels took responsibility, and sources suggest support for the attack \n17  originated in Iraq, not Iran. \n•  Sept. 18, 2019 President Trump tweets that he “just instructed the Secretary of the \n18 \nTreasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!” \n19  •  Oct. 11, 2019 Following two missiles hitting an Iranian oil tanker near the Saudi port \nof Jeddah, the Pentagon announces an additional 1,800 troops will be sent to Saudi \n20  Arabia, bringing the total number deployed within last month to 3,000 troops. \n•  Nov. 17, 2019 Following protests over Iran’s 50 percent increase of government-set \n21  gasoline prices, the Iranian government implemented marshal law, turning off the \ncountry’s internet for several days. Curfews were implemented, and an undisclosed \n22 \nnumber of protesters were slaughtered. \n23  •  Dec. 29, 2019 US forces conducted airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against five facilities \nthe Pentagon says are tied to an Iranian-backed militia blamed for a series of attacks \n24  on joint US-Iraq military facilities housing American forces, causing Iranian Foreign \nMinistry spokesman Abbas Mosavi to say the US has \"openly shown its support to \n25 \nterrorism and shown its negligence to the independence and national sovereignty of \ncountries\" and that “it must accept responsibility of the consequences of the illegal \n26 \nattacks.\" \n27   \n \n28 \n \n32 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 37 of 55   Page ID #:1561\n \n1  Individually, these escalations and the rhetoric surrounding them \n2 \ncompound Plaintiffs’ anxiety about their loved ones’ safety and security. \n3 \nCollectively, they have lodged Plaintiffs into a constant state of distress \n4 \n5  that, absent intervention, will last for what appears to be an indefinite period \n6 \nof time. \n7 \n8 \n108.  When the Iranian government cut off the internet in the country on \n9 \nNovember 16, 2019, Petitioner Plaintiffs feared the worst. For example, minor \n10 \n11  Plaintiffs S.A.(1) and S.A.(2) normally talk to their father every day on video \n12 \nchat, but even they knew something was wrong when they couldn’t, causing \n13 \nS.A.(1) to cry and ignore everyone in her house, saying she only wants to talk \n14 \n15  to her dad. Similarly, Plaintiff PARTO KAVOOSIAN could not get ahold of \n16 \nher parents to know if they were ok, causing her to feel numb. Even though \n17 \nPlaintiff MANSOUR HARDANIAN was still able to communicate with his \n18 \n19  wife using a landline phone instead of video calls, he was very concerned for \n20 \nher safety, worrying what they would do if the government cut the landline \n21 \nphones, or even worse, closed the airports. \n22 \n23    \n24 \n \n25 \n \n26 \n27   \n28 \n \n \n33 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 38 of 55   Page ID #:1562\n \n1  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n  \n2 \nCOUNT ONE \n3  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b), 706(1) \n \n4 \n5  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n6 \nthe preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n7 \n109.   Pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), Defendants have a \n8 \n9  nondiscretionary duty “to conclude a matter presented to it” “within a \n10 \nreasonable time.” Defendants have failed to adjudicate the waivers of PP 9645 \n11 \nfor Beneficiary Plaintiffs, and thus, have not concluded matters presented. \n12 \n13  Defendants have failed to adjudicate Beneficiary Plaintiffs visa waivers within \n14 \n90 days, and thus, have not concluded matters presented within a reasonable \n15 \ntime. \n16 \n17  110.  Because the actions Defendants take in adjudicating Plaintiffs’ waivers, \n18 \nthrough unlawful designations, is prohibited by the Proclamation, adjudication \n19 \nof waivers has been unlawfully withheld. \n20 \n21 \n111.  On December 14, 2017, DEFENDANT NANTAIS sent an email to \n22 \nthen-Consular Section Chief at U.S. Embassy Djibouti Brian Sells, explicitly \n23 \ninstructing him: “Please be clear that the goal of this effort is not to create \n24 \n25 \ntimely processing of waivers for any applicant who is ineligible under the \n26 \nproclamation.” \n27 \n28 \n \n34 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 39 of 55   Page ID #:1563\n \n1  112.  Defendant DOS unlawfully designated consular managers, visa chiefs, \n2 \nconsular section chiefs, and consular management, the Visa Office, and even \n3 \nnon-DOS employees, such as Quality Support, Inc. contractors, to have \n4 \n5  authority and discretion over final decisions about case-by-case waivers. \n6 \n113.  Defendants’ requirement for consular manager concurrence for final \n7 \nwaiver decisions, as exposed in the Van Hollen Letter, demonstrates a pattern \n8 \n9  and policy of delay in dealing with waiver adjudications. Defendants’ \n10 \nrequirement for visa chief and consular section chief concurrence with final \n11 \nwaiver decisions, as exposed in Defendant’s “Operational Q&As on P.P. \n12 \n13  9645,” demonstrates a pattern and policy of delay in dealing with waiver \n14 \nadjudications. \n15 \n114.  Defendants’ requirement for consular management and Visa Office \n16 \n17  concurrence with final waiver decisions, as exposed in an April 11, 2019 \n18 \n“Department of State/AILA Liaison Committee Meeting,” demonstrates a \n19 \npattern and policy of waiver adjudications delays. \n20 \n21 \n115.  Because Defendants administer a pattern and policy of delay in dealing \n22 \nwith all waiver adjudications, including the waiver adjudications for all \n23 \nBeneficiary Plaintiffs, the connection amongst Plaintiffs is sufficient to satisfy \n24 \n25 \njoinder requirements. \n26 \n116.  Pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), a court may compel agency \n27 \naction “unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” \n28 \n \n35 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 40 of 55   Page ID #:1564\n \n1   \n \n2 \nCOUNT TWO \n3  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, § 706(2)(A) and (D) \n \n4 \nPlaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n5 \nthe preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n6 \n7  117.  The APA prohibits federal agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an \n8 \nabuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” or is conducted \n9 \n“without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and \n10 \n11  (D). \n12 \n118.  Defendants’ requirement for consular manager concurrence for final \n13 \nwaiver decisions, as expressed in the Van Hollen Letter, is an appointment of \n14 \n15  the consular manager as designee to the consular officer, which is unlawful as \n16 \nit was not authorized by PP 9645. \n17 \n119.  Defendants’ requirement for visa chief and consular section chief \n18 \n19 \nconcurrence with final waiver decisions, as exposed in Defendant’s \n20 \n“Operational Q&As on P.P. 9645,”  is an appointment of visa chief and \n21 \nconsular section chief as designees to the consular officer, which is unlawful as \n22 \n23 \nit was not authorized by PP 9645. \n24 \n120.  Defendants’ requirement for consular management and Visa Office \n25 \nconcurrence with final waiver decisions, as exposed in an April 11, 2019 \n26 \n27 \n“Department of State/AILA Liaison Committee Meeting,” is an appointment of \n28 \n \n36 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 41 of 55   Page ID #:1565\n \n1  consular management and the Visa Office as designees to the consular officer, \n2 \nwhich is unlawful as it was not authorized by PP 9645. \n3 \n121.  While Section 3(C) of PP 9645 explicitly allows for the Commissioner \n4 \n5  of CBP to appoint a designee “as appropriate, in their discretion,” it does not \n6 \nallow for the consular officer to appoint a designee. Nor does PP 9645 extend \n7 \nthe authority to appoint a designee to POMPEO, or DOS. Further, PP 9645 was \n8 \n9  specific as to “their discretion,” where “their” refers to the consular manager, \n10 \nthe CBP Commissioner, and the CBP Commissioner’s designee. Therefore, \n11 \ndesignations of authority for waiver adjudications was settled within the four \n12 \n13  corners of PP 9645. PP 9645 was silent as to any authority or discretion placed \n14 \nwith consular managers, visa chiefs, consular section chiefs, and consular \n15 \nmanagement, the Visa Office, and even non-DOS employees, such as Quality \n16 \n17  Support, Inc. contractors, to adjudicate case-by-case waivers, so their required \n18 \nconcurrence is unlawful. \n19 \n122.  Thus, since Defendants’ appointment of consular managers, visa chiefs, \n20 \n21 \nconsular section chiefs, and consular management, the Visa Office, and even \n22 \nnon-DOS employees, such as Quality Support, Inc. contractors, as designees to \n23 \nadjudicate final waiver decisions is also forbidden by, and unlawful under, PP \n24 \n25 \n9645, the decision to make the unauthorized grant of discretion to the consular \n26 \nmanager, by Defendants POMPEO, DOS, and/or DOES #3-#10, was an \n27 \narbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion, and it is without observance of \n28 \n \n37 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 42 of 55   Page ID #:1566\n \n1  procedure required by law, because it conflicts explicitly with the text of PP \n2 \n9645. \n3 \n123.  On March 27, 2019, Defendant POMPEO appeared before the House \n4 \n5  Foreign Affairs Committee. When asked by U.S. Representative David Trone \n6 \nto talk about the usurpation of consular officer authority and discretion in the \n7 \nimplementation of PP 9645 waiver scheme, Defendant POMPEO answered, “I \n8 \n9  actually think we have the authorities here precisely right.” \n10 \n \n11 \nCOUNT THREE \n12 \nMANDAMUS \n13   \nPlaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n14 \n15  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n16 \n \n17  124.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation \n18 \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n19 \n125.  As noted in Count One, the APA requires agencies to “proceed to \n20 \n21 \nconclude a matter presented” to the agency “within a reasonable time.” 5 \n22 \nU.S.C. § 555(b). As a result of Defendants’ waiver adjudication scheme, \n23 \nPlaintiffs in this action have been awaiting final waiver decisions from between \n24 \n25 \n15 to 25 months. In failing to adjudicate their applications, Defendants have \n26 \nfailed to act “within a reasonable time” in violation of the APA. \n27 \n28 \n \n38 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 43 of 55   Page ID #:1567\n \n1  126.  Further, and as noted in Count Two, the APA prohibits federal agency \n2 \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \n3 \naccordance with law,” or is conducted “without observance of procedure \n4 \n5  required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (D). \n6 \n127.  Defendants’ requirement for consular manager concurrence with final \n7 \nwaiver decisions, as exposed in the Van Hollen Letter, is an appointment of the \n8 \n9  consular manager as designee to the consular officer, and not authorized by PP \n10 \n9645. Thus, the requirement is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, as \n11 \nwell as not in accordance with law. \n12 \n13  128.  Defendants’ requirement for visa chief and consular section chief \n14 \nconcurrence with final waiver decisions, as exposed in Defendant’s \n15 \n“Operational Q&As on P.P. 9645,”  is an appointment of visa chief and \n16 \n17  consular section chief as designees to the consular officer, and not authorized \n18 \nby PP 9645. Thus, the requirement is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \n19 \ndiscretion, as well as not in accordance with law. \n20 \n21 \n129.  Defendants’ requirement for consular management and Visa Office \n22 \nconcurrence with final waiver decisions, as exposed in an April 11, 2019 \n23 \n“Department of State/AILA Liaison Committee Meeting,” is an appointment of \n24 \n25 \nconsular management and the Visa Office as designees to the consular officer, \n26 \nand not authorized by PP 9645. Thus, the requirement is arbitrary, capricious, \n27 \nan abuse of discretion, as well as not in accordance with law. \n28 \n \n39 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 44 of 55   Page ID #:1568\n \n1  130.  Finally, Defendants have a non-discretionary duty to develop guidance \n2 \non the waiver process that results in the full, fairly, and adjudication of \n3 \nBeneficiary Plaintiffs’ considerations for waivers under PP 9645 within a \n4 \n5  reasonable time. Instead, Defendants have developed inconsistent guidance that \n6 \nleads to a waiver adjudication scheme that never gives individual consular \n7 \nofficers the discretion and authority PP 9645 requires. As designed by the PP \n8 \n9  9645 Brain Trust, this scheme places visa applicants, including Plaintiffs, in a \n10 \nperpetual loop of administrative processing.   \n11 \n131.  Because there are no other adequate remedies available to Plaintiffs, \n12 \n13  mandamus is appropriate. See 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n14 \n \n15 \nCOUNT FOUR \n16 \nPROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n17   \nPlaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in \n18 \n19  the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n20 \n132.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o \n21 \nperson . . . shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of \n22 \n23  law.” \n24 \n133.  Plaintiffs’ fundamental rights include their right to the \"integrity of the \n25 \nfamily unit.\" Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972). This includes a \n26 \n27  cognizable liberty interest in their family members’ ability to travel to the \n28 \nUnited States. See Bustamante v. Mukasey, 531 F.3d 1059, 1062 (9th Cir. \n \n40 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 45 of 55   Page ID #:1569\n \n1  2008); see also Kerry v. Din, 135 S.Ct. 2128, 2139 (2018) (Kennedy, J., \n2 \nconcurring); Cardenas v. United States, 826 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir. 2016) \n3 \n(noting that J. Kennedy’s concurrence in Din is controlling). Individuals must \n4 \n5  be given due process prior to the deprivation of these liberty interests. \n6 \n134.  For example, due to Defendants’ withholding of PP 9645 waiver \n7 \nadjudication for FARSHAD AMIRKHANI, S.A.(1), his 14-year-old daughter \n8 \n9  S.A.(1), and 11-year-old son S.A.(2), have already been separated from their \n10 \nfather for two years more than they would have been without the withholding \n11 \nof PP 9645 waiver adjudication.  \n12 \n13  135.  Congress has created statutory rights and prescribed procedures \n14 \napplicable to prospective immigrants. Due process rights attach to those \n15 \nstatutory rights, which create cognizable liberty and property interests for both \n16 \n17  Petitioner Plaintiffs and Beneficiary Plaintiffs. See Lanza v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d \n18 \n917, 927 (9th Cir. 2004) (“The due process afforded aliens stems from those \n19 \nstatutory rights granted by Congress and the principle that ‘[m]inimum due \n20 \n21 \nprocess rights attach to statutory rights.’”) (alteration in original) (quoting Dia \n22 \nv. Ashcroft, 353 F.3d 228, 239 (3d Cir. 2003). Those interests include reliance \n23 \ninterests on the basis of which Plaintiffs have spent significant resources. See \n24 \n25 \nPerry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601 (1972)(mutually explicit expectations \n26 \ngive rise to property interests). \n27 \n28 \n \n41 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 46 of 55   Page ID #:1570\n \n1  136.  Federal agencies have likewise created regulatory rights related to the \n2 \npetitioning and issuance of visas. Individuals must be given due process prior \n3 \nto the deprivation of these statutory and regulatory rights. \n4 \n5  137.  The “very essence” of due process is the “protection of the individual \n6 \nagainst arbitrary action.” Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, \n7 \n584 (1972). Any deprivation of liberty and property interests must, at the very \n8 \n9  least, have a rational basis. \n10 \n138.  Defendants’ policies, decisions, and actions that caused and continue to \n11 \ncause unreasonable administrative delays in the adjudication of Beneficiary \n12 \n13  Plaintiffs’ waivers has already deprived and continues to deprive Plaintiffs of \n14 \nprotected liberty and property interests without due process of law. \n15 \n139.  There is no queue for visa applicants awaiting adjudications of PP 9645 \n16 \n17  waivers. Rather, Defendants have implemented a waiver adjudication scheme \n18 \nthat is at its heart, arbitrary madness. This is due in part to Defendants \n19 \nimplementing a system that, in addition to usurping consular officer authority \n20 \n21 \nand discretion, fails to fully integrate a system for tracking which applications \n22 \nwere awaiting concurrence before the consular officer could approve the visas. \n23 \nWaiver requests were submitted by consular officers to the countries-of-\n24 \n25 \nconcern@state.gov email address, with that email being the only digital, and \n26 \nfor that matter - the last, record of the requests. \n27 \n28 \n \n42 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 47 of 55   Page ID #:1571\n \n1  140.  Most Iranian visa applicants, including all Beneficiary Plaintiffs in this \n2 \naction, have seen other applicants who attended interviews months if not years \n3 \nafter them, have their visas issued already. Further, as a result of Defendants’ \n4 \n5  early-July implementation of automated pre-vetting, Iranian national visa \n6 \napplicants attending their first consular interview today, are likely to have their \n7 \nPP 9645 waiver adjudicated within months, and at least one to two years before \n8 \n9  Iranian national visa applicants who attended their consular interviews prior to \n10 \nearly-July 2019. \n11 \n141.  By extending, by unlawful designation, authority and discretion to \n12 \n13  consular managers to adjudicate, or have input to the adjudication of Plaintiffs’ \n14 \nwaivers,  Defendants have already deprived, and continue to deprive Plaintiffs \n15 \nof protected liberty and property interests without due process of law. \n16 \n17  142.  Further, the waiver process Defendants have implemented is inherently \n18 \narbitrary and has deprived Plaintiffs of even the most minimal process that \n19 \nattaches to the statutory benefits conferred on them by Congress. By not \n20 \n21 \nallowing them or their family members the opportunity to be considered for a \n22 \nwaiver, Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of the opportunity to show that \n23 \nthey meet the eligibility criteria for visa categories for which they or their \n24 \n25 \nfamily members are eligible by statute. In doing so, Defendants have already \n26 \ndeprived, and continue to provide Plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, of \n27 \nprotected liberty and property interests without due process of law. \n28 \n \n43 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 48 of 55   Page ID #:1572\n \n1  143.  Defendants’ implementation of the PP 9645 waiver provision in such a \n2 \nway as to guarantee visa applicants incurring the guaranteed and senseless \n3 \nduplicative expenses like medical reports and travel to embassies in third \n4 \n5  countries (Armenia, Turkey, and the U.A.E.) violates their property interests.  \n6 \n144.  Defendants’ violations of Plaintiffs’ constitutionally guaranteed rights \n7 \nhave caused Plaintiffs to suffer and continue to suffer irreparable harm (by \n8 \n9  indefinitely denying them access to their families and unnecessarily burdening \n10 \nthem with extraordinary expenses), and entitle them to declaratory, injunctive \n11 \nand other relief. \n12 \n13   \n14 \nCOUNT FIVE \n15  VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION PRINCIPLES \nEMBEDDED IN THE FIFTH AMENDMENT \n16 \n \n17  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference each of the allegations set \n18 \nforth above.  \n19 \n145.  Defendants have violated the equal protection principles of the \n20 \n21 \nFourteenth Amendment, embedded in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \n22 \nAmendment. \n23 \n146.  The affirmative aggregate acts of Defendants in usurping consular \n24 \n25 \nofficer authority and withholding Plaintiffs’ waiver adjudications irreversibly \n26 \ndiscriminates against Plaintiffs’ exercise of their fundamental rights to life, \n27 \nliberty, and property, and abridge central precepts of equality. The affirmative \n28 \n \n44 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 49 of 55   Page ID #:1573\n \n1  aggregate acts of Defendants in usurping consular officer authority has caused \n2 \nand continues to cause irreparable injury and hardship to Plaintiffs.  \n3 \n147.  As a result, the irreparable injury and hardship caused by Defendants has \n4 \n5  denied Plaintiffs the same protection of fundamental rights afforded to visa \n6 \napplicants who had the arbitrary fortune to have their consular interviews \n7 \nscheduled for after early-July 2019, and thus benefit from Defendants’ new \n8 \n9  automated processing.  \n10 \n148.  The imposition of this disability on Plaintiffs serves to disrespect and \n11 \nsubordinate them. The Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the Fifth \n12 \n13  Amendment’s equal protection principles are connected but set forth distinct \n14 \nprinciples, which are implicated here.  \n15 \n149.  Beneficiary Plaintiffs in this action are all Iranian nationals who attended \n16 \n17  consular interviews prior to the Visa Office’s early-July 2019 implementation \n18 \nof an automated processing system, and they are members of a separate suspect \n19 \nclass in need of protection from the political process pursuant to the principles \n20 \n21 \nof Equal Protection. As evidenced by their affirmative aggregate acts, \n22 \nDefendants have a long history of deliberately discriminating against Iranian \n23 \nnationals. In fact, the reason they implemented the automated processing \n24 \n25 \nsystem when they did was to increase the number of approved waivers in \n26 \nadvance of a congressional hearing of the House Judiciary Committee \n27 \nSubcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship and Foreign Affairs Committee \n28 \n \n45 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 50 of 55   Page ID #:1574\n \n1  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, that eventually took place on \n2 \nSeptember 24, 2019.  \n3 \n150.  At that congressional hearing, Edward Ramotowski, Deputy Assistant \n4 \n5  Secretary, Bureau of Consular Affairs for Defendant DOS (“Mr. \n6 \nRamotowski”), revealed that the new automated processing “occurs prior to [a \n7 \nvisa applicant’s] interview,” before bragging that, “[i]n the short time this \n8 \n9  system has been in place, the month-to-month change in visas issued pursuant \n10 \nto a waiver rose from a steady 10 to 12 percent from before the new system, to \n11 \nmore than 50 percent each month.” Yet, in the same testimony, for the waiver \n12 \n13  adjudications of Beneficiary Plaintiffs and those similarly situated, Mr. \n14 \nRamotowski would only say “the Department is working diligently to review \n15 \nand process to conclusion existing P.P. 9645-subject cases,  and that “[w]e \n16 \n17  anticipate that a majority of pre-July 2019 waiver cases pending with the \n18 \nDepartment, most of which require some degree of manual review, should be \n19 \ncompleted by the end of 2019 or soon thereafter.” See Exhibit C.       \n20 \n21 \n151.  Beneficiary Plaintiffs are an insular minority with no voting rights and \n22 \nno political power or influence over Defendants and their actions concerning \n23 \nDefendants’ waiver adjudication scheme. Beneficiary Plaintiffs have \n24 \n25 \nimmutable characteristics, national origin and consular interview date, that they \n26 \ncannot change.  \n27 \n28 \n \n46 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 51 of 55   Page ID #:1575\n \n1  152.  Beneficiary Plaintiffs do not have present political power or influence, \n2 \nhave immutable characteristics, and are also an insular minority. \n3 \n153.  Beneficiary Plaintiffs have no avenues of redress other than this court, as \n4 \n5  Beneficiary Plaintiffs cannot challenge or alter the acts of Defendants usurping \n6 \nconsular officer authority or withholding their waiver adjudications. Plaintiffs \n7 \nhave experienced and will continue to suffer the irreparable impacts of \n8 \n9  Defendants’ indefinite withholding of their waiver adjudications, while visa \n10 \napplicants attending their visa interviews today will suffer no such hardship.  \n11 \n154.  No rational basis exists for why Defendants are using an efficient \n12 \n13  automated process for adjudicating waivers for new visa applicants, but not \n14 \nusing the automated process for adjudicating waivers for Beneficiary Plaintiffs, \n15 \nwho have waited so long and endured so much hardship already. \n16 \n17   \n18 \n \n19   \n \n20 \n \n21 \n \n \n22 \n \n23 \n \n \n24 \n \n25 \n \n \n26 \n \n27 \n \n \n28 \n \n \n47 \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77   Filed 12/30/19   Page 52 of 55   Page ID #:1576\n \n1  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n2 \n \n3  “Visa adjudication software does not permit a consular officer to overcome \nthe refusal [entered by the consular officer at the end of the interview] and \n4 \nissue a visa while a formal request…is pending a response from the \n5  Department.

Today I am \nhonored to represent the many career consular officers dedicated to adjudicating visas according \nto the law and regulations set forth by the President and Congress.  In my over 33 years of \nservice with the State Department, I have observed first-hand how committed these career staff \nare to providing the best customer service possible, and to ensuring that each and every consular \nadjudication is made in adherence with the established requirements.  As laws and regulations \nchange, these career staff work hard to quickly adapt and implement new procedures in a \nprofessional manner. \nPresident Trump issued Presidential Proclamation 9645, titled “Enhancing Vetting Capabilities \nand Processes for Detecting Attempted Entry into the United States by Terrorists or other Public-\nSafety Threats,” on September 24, 2017.  The issuance of the Proclamation was prompted by a \nglobal review conducted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with \nthe Department of State (the Department) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).  \nThe 2017 review evaluated whether additional information would be needed from each foreign \ncountry to assess adequately if their nationals seeking to enter the United States pose a security \nor safety threat.  That review focused on the integrity of documents required to travel to the \nUnited States, whether the country makes available certain types of information on terrorists, \ncriminals, fraudsters and the traveling population; and a national security and public-safety risk \nassessment of the country.   \nThe President deemed it necessary to impose certain restrictions on the entry of certain \nnonimmigrants and immigrants from nationals of eight countries, including Chad, Iran, Libya, \nNorth Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.  P.P. 9645’s travel restrictions were \nintended to address the information-sharing and other security risks to the United States and to \nencourage host governments to remedy these deficiencies.  On April 10, 2018, a new Presidential \nProclamation amended P.P. 9645 of September 24, 2017, removing the visa restrictions imposed \non nationals of Chad based on the notable improvements of the government of Chad in identity \nmanagement practices, handling of lost and stolen passports, and information sharing.      \nAlthough certain federal courts enjoined the government from enforcing P.P. 9645, on December \n4, 2017, the Supreme Court allowed P.P. 9645 to be fully implemented.  In accordance with that \ndecision, on December 8, 2017, the Department undertook to fully implement the Proclamation.  \nOn June 26, 2018, the Supreme Court issued a decision that the Proclamation was a lawful \nUNCLASSIFIED \nAILA Doc. No. 19092638. (Posted 9/26/19)\nUnclassified \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77-3   Filed 12/30/19   Page 2 of 4   Page ID #:1601\nUNCLASSIFIED \n-2- \nexercise of the President’s authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Consistent with \nthe Court’s decision, the Department continued processing visa applications in accordance with \nthe Proclamation for subject nationals of the seven affected countries.   \nThe Department of State’s main role in the implementation of P.P. 9645 is to adjudicate visa \napplications from nationals of the seven designated countries and, where legally appropriate, to \napply exceptions and waivers.  This is a multi-step process.   \nFirst, a consular officer must determine whether an applicant is otherwise eligible for a visa \nunder the immigration laws of the United States.  Many applicants will be found ineligible at this \nstage, especially those seeking a temporary visitor visa who are unable to demonstrate that they \nhave a residence abroad that they have no intention of abandoning.   \nSecond, if otherwise eligible for the visa, the consular officer determines whether the applicant \nqualifies for an exception to the Proclamation’s travel restrictions or, if not, whether the \napplicant is eligible for a waiver under the Proclamation, which allows for issuance of a visa.  \nThe restrictions imposed by the Proclamation vary by country, so that some nationals experience \nonly limited impact.  For example, only certain government officials from Venezuela are subject \nto the Proclamation’s restrictions, while for Yemeni and Libyan nationals, the Proclamation only \nrestricts short-term tourist and business nonimmigrant visas.  Somali nationals face no \nrestrictions on any nonimmigrant visa category. \nThe Department of State has devoted substantial efforts to ensure that the Proclamation’s entry \nrestrictions, exceptions and waivers are applied correctly and consistently by consular officers at \nembassies and consulates overseas.  The Department has updated guidance as necessary for \nconsular officers in the field to accomplish this task.     \n \nSome applicants benefit from the exceptions provided by the Proclamation.  An applicant whose \nsituation fits into one of the exceptions set forth in the Proclamation, and who is otherwise \neligible for a visa, may be issued a visa without going through the Proclamation’s waiver \nprocess.   As specified in the Proclamation, these exceptions include:   \n \n•  Individuals who were present in the United States when the proclamation went into effect \n•  Individuals who had valid visas when the proclamation went into effect \n•  Anyone whose visa was revoked or canceled as a result of E.O. 13769 who still qualifies \n•  Any Lawful Permanent Resident \n•  Anyone who subsequently travels to the United States under a proclamation waiver, or \nany other lawful means. \n•  Any dual national traveling on the passport of a non-subject country \n•  Diplomats and officials traveling to the United Nations and NATO \n•  Individuals who have been granted asylum, admitted to the United States as refugees, or \nhave been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or projection under the \nConvention Against Torture \n \nUNCLASSIFIED \n \n  \nAILA Doc. No. 19092638. (Posted 9/26/19)\nUnclassified \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77-3   Filed 12/30/19   Page 3 of 4   Page ID #:1602\nUNCLASSIFIED \n-3- \nWith respect to Proclamation waivers, if a visa applicant subject to P.P. 9645’s visa restrictions \nhas established eligibility for a visa (for example, has overcome INA section 214(b) and is not \nineligible for a visa on a ground under INA 212(a)), the consular officer will automatically \nconsider the applicant for a waiver based upon the criteria set forth in the Proclamation.  There is \nno separate waiver application and no additional fee.  As specified in the Proclamation, consular \nofficers determine on a case-by-case basis if an applicant is eligible for a waiver, based on the \nfollowing criteria:  issuance of the visa is in the national interest; denial of the visa would cause \nthe applicant undue hardship; and, the applicant poses no national security or public safety threat \nto the United States.   \n \nConsular officers, in consultation with their supervisors, determine whether applicants meet the \nwaiver criteria, especially the first two (national interest and undue hardship) based on general \nguidance provided by the Department.  Consular officers are in the best position to assess the \napplicant’s personal circumstances and purpose of travel as part of the visa application process, \nand they can ask for additional information directly from the applicant if needed.  For the third \nwaiver criterion (national security) consular officers, until recently, were required to send the \ncase to Washington for review, in a process similar to the security advisory opinion (SAO) \nprocedure for other visa cases.  A clear response on the security review would allow the consular \nofficer to approve the waiver and issue the visa.   \n \nUp until July 2019, to comply with the national security criterion of the waiver process, \napplicants subject to P.P. 9645 underwent an intensive post-interview interagency security \nreview, to provide consular officers information on whether or not the applicant’s entry into the \nUnited States would pose a threat to national security or public safety.  Until very recently, this \ninteragency review was a time-consuming manual process, which led to a large backlog of \nwaiver cases.  During this time, the Department worked closely with consular officers in the field \nto identify and expedite processing of the most urgent cases, while maintaining the rigorous \nnature of the security review.   \n \nThe Department, after extensive work with interagency partners and consistent with the March 6, \n2017 Presidential Memorandum, “Implementing Immediate Heightened Screening and Vetting of \nApplications for Visas and Other Immigration Benefits…,” and Section 5 of P.P. 9645 started in \nearly July 2019 to run a new enhanced automated screening and vetting process for all immigrant \nand nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to the Proclamation.  The new enhanced review is \nautomated, occurs prior to the interview, and provides consular officers with the information \nrequired to make most P.P. 9645 waiver determinations much more quickly.  It is now possible \nthat many cases may be issued within days of the application, should the security check done \nprior to the interview not show any concerns – once the consular officer has established all three \ncriterion of the waiver, the visa may be issued.  \n \nWhile it is too early to ascertain the full impact on new P.P. 9645-subject applications, initial \nevidence indicates that consular officers are now able to make most waiver decisions within a \nfew days of the visa interview.  In the short time this system has been in place, the month-to-\nmonth change in visas issued pursuant to a waiver rose from a steady 10 to 12 percent from \nbefore the new system, to more than 50 percent each month.  This is evidence that under the new \nsystem, applicants who qualify for a waiver will receive their visas much sooner.  Meanwhile, \nUNCLASSIFIED \n \n  \nAILA Doc. No. 19092638. (Posted 9/26/19)\nUnclassified \n\nCase 8:19-cv-01417-JVS-DFM   Document 77-3   Filed 12/30/19   Page 4 of 4   Page ID #:1603\nUNCLASSIFIED \n-4- \nthe Department is working diligently to review and process to conclusion existing P.P. 9645-\nsubject cases.  Since September 14, 2019 the Department issued more than 7,600 visas pursuant \nto a waiver of P.P. 9645.  We anticipate that a majority of pre-July 2019 waiver cases pending \nwith the Department, most of which require some degree of manual review, should be completed \nby the end of 2019 or soon thereafter.  The new automated system is intended to significantly \nincrease the speed and efficiency of the vetting process for both currently pending and future \nP.P. 9645-subject applications while enhancing security standards. \n \nFinally, it should be noted that the Department is working closely with a number of other \ncountries around the world to address other security and information sharing deficiencies that \nwere identified by the Department of Homeland Security’s ongoing P.P. 9645 review process.  \nThis policy of constructive diplomatic engagement aims to mitigate or eliminate the security \ndeficiencies in a cooperative manner, without resorting to sanctions.  As such, it will improve not \nonly U.S. national security, but the security of the international community as well.   \nThank you Madam Chairwoman and Mr. Chairman.  I look forward to answering your questions \nand those of other members of the Subcommittees. \nUNCLASSIFIED \n \n  \nAILA Doc. No. 19092638.
