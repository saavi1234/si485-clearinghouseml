    "summary": "<p>This Clearinghouse entry discusses the post 1970 proceedings in <em>Lee v. Macon County</em>, a seminal Alabama desegregation case. That case originated in the Middle District of Alabama and was transferred to a three-judge district court which supervised school desegregation across the state. However, after 1970, the statewide case was dissolved and desegregation cases in individual school districts were sent to the judicial districts that encompassed them. This Clearinghouse entry describes the <em>Lee</em> litigation in the Southern District of Alabama after 1970. To read about what happened between 1963, when the case was filed, and 1970, please see <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=10878&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <em>Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Ed.</em></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Washington County</strong></p>\r\n<p>In September of 1976 in Washington County Alabama, the National Education Association (NEA), a teachers union, intervened in the case to challenge the district's policies with respect to the hiring and placement of Black teachers. The NEA alleged that the district's policies violated the 1970 desegregation order and whether several individual staffing decisions were lawful. 456 F. Supp. 1175. This litigation reached the Court of Appeals (the Fifth, and later Eleventh, Circuits) twice. 625 F.2d 1235; 682 F.2d 894.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conecuh County</strong></p>\r\n<p>In Conecuh County, both the United States and the NEA both intervened to allege deficiencies in the county's desegregation order. Both motions were denied, but the NEA later appealed to the Fifth Circuit to challenge the hiring and firing of Black teachers. Finding that additional fact finding was needed, the Fifth Circuit remanded the case in July of 1973. 482 F.2d 1253. The District Court eventually dismissed the case in 1974 (1974 WL 10550) and was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit later that year (498 F.2d 1090).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Marengo County</strong></p>\r\n<p>After the adoption and implementation of a desegregation plan, District Judge William Brevard Hand found that Marengo County's schools had reached unitary status in 1977. The United States objected to Judge Hand's decision and filed a motion requesting that the county develop a new plan to desegregate. Judge Hand agreed, finding in an August 7, 1978, opinion that the district had \"done little in complying\" with the desegregation orders and imposing additional requirements on it. 454 F. Supp 918. However, more information about that litigation is not publicly available.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dockets</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the Southern District, Lee was assigned a new docket number, not reflected in the record but later changed to 1:70-cv-05945-M. It is unclear how this docket was used, as it is not available in the record. The following cases and docket numbers are off-shoots of the original 1963 litigation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lee v. Washington County Board of Education (docket: 5945-70-H)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lee v. Conecuh County Board of Education (docket: 5945-79-H)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lee v. Marengo County Board of Education (docket: 5945-70-H)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, these cases probably represent only a portion of the <em>Lee</em> desegregation litigation conducted in the Southern District of Alabama. Given that these cases happened prior to the advent of electronic filing, it is difficult for the Clearinghouse to find records for them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

On \nJuly 31, 1978, the Department of Justice reasserted its objection to the district courtโs February 10, 1977, order by \n4 \n \n\n \n \nLee v.

Washington County Bd. of Educ., 456 F.Supp. 1175, 1187 \n(S.D.Ala.1978). The Department of Justice did not appeal. \n \n2  The NEA presented six individual claims of employment discrimination to the district court. The court held that the \n  Board discriminated against Rubye Nelson on the basis of race by failing to hire her as a summer school English \nteacher in 1977. It also held that the Board discriminated against Brenda Fancher on the basis of race by failing to \nrenew her contract as a special education teacher for the 1977-78 school year. The district court granted relief to \nboth Nelson and Fancher and the Board did not appeal. \nIn addition to rejecting the individual claims of employment discrimination brought on behalf of Roberts, \nStephens, and Breech, the district court denied relief to George Holcombe, an applicant for the position of high \nschool principal for the 1976-77 school year. Prior to the hearing before the district court in this action, George \nHolcombe was appointed to and accepted a position as middle school principal in the Washington County public \nschool system. The NEA does not assert his claim of employment discrimination on appeal. \n \n3  Rather, the court expressed its concern โthat mere word of mouth notification is not in keeping with the sound \n  administrative procedures that the Board is bound by law to follow.โ 456 F.Supp. at 1181 n.9. It further announced \nits conviction โthat the notice policy previously employed by the Board (or lack thereof) ought to be reconsidered,โ \nid. at 1182 n.9, and indicated its intention โto insist that the Board adopt an appropriate advertisement policy.โ Id. \nat 1191. Counsel for the Board at oral argument advised this Court that, in compliance with the district courtโs \nadmonitions, the Board now has developed and fully implemented a policy of advertising to the general public the \nemployment opportunities that arise within the school system. \n \n4  See id. at 1191 n.31. But see generally Long v. Sapp, 502 F.2d 34, 41 (5th Cir. 1974); Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., \n  495 F.2d 398, 419 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1050, 95 S.Ct. 625, 42 L.Ed.2d 644 (1974); United States v. Georgia \nPower Co., 474 F.2d 906, 925 (5th Cir. 1973). \n \n5  Roberts applied for the position of principal at McIntosh High School for the 1976-77 school year. Stephens applied \n  for the position of principal at Leroy High School for the 1976-77 school year. Superintendent Wood testified that, in \nhis opinion, both Roberts and Stephens were qualified in 1976 to serve as principals of these schools. \n \n6  The district court cited and the Board on appeal relies upon Lee v. Chambers County Bd. of Educ., 533 F.2d 132 (5th \n  Cir. 1976), for the proposition that an individual asserting a claim of employment discrimination must prove that he \nwas the most qualified applicant for the position. This misapprehends the holding in Chambers County. As \nevidenced by our subsequent decision in Davis v. Board of School Commโrs, Chambers County can only support the \nproposition that โ(w)here the defendant offers sufficient proof that white recipients of promotions are better \nqualified than the black individual who alleges discrimination, then the district courtโs denial of injunctive relief and \ndamages to that plaintiff is proper.โ 600 F.2d at 474. \n \n7  The NEA also attempted to show that (1) Roberts and Stephens belong to a racial minority, (2) they applied and \n  were qualified for positions for which the Board was seeking applicants, (3) the Board rejected them despite their \nqualifications, and (4) the Board appointed nonminorities to the positions. It thus attempted to raise an inference of \npurposeful discrimination through proof of the four-prong test established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell \nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 677 (1973). A party may utilize proof \nof the McDonnell Douglas factors to raise an inference of purposeful employment discrimination in a case brought \nunder 42 U.S.C. s 1981. See Crawford v. Western Elec. Co., 614 F.2d 1300, 1315 (5th Cir. 1980). We need not decide \nwhether the evidence presented by the NEA was sufficient to raise an inference of purposeful discrimination \nbecause, in the context of this case, any showing by clear and convincing proof that Roberts and Stephens would not \nhave been employed absent the class-based discrimination clearly would suffice to rebut the inference of purposeful \n5 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Washington County Bd. of Ed., 625 F.2d 1235 (1980)   \n24 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 31,253 \n \ndiscrimination raised by proof of the McDonnell Douglas factors. See generally id. at 1320-21. \nIt is appropriate to note one other matter. If an employer is unable to prove by clear and convincing evidence that \nthe individual member of the class seeking relief would not have been hired absent the discrimination, individual \nrelief must be awarded unless special circumstances are present. See McCormick v. Attala County Bd. of Educ., \n541 F.2d 1094, 1095 (5th Cir. 1976); Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d 211, 253 (5th Cir. 1974).

The district court placed no weight on Breechโs failure to apply \nfor the specific position of special education coordinator and assumed that the NEA proved a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. See 456 F.Supp. at 1189. However, the district court rejected Breechโs individual claim for relief, \nholding that, by showing that the successful applicant for the position of special education coordinator had more \nexperience than Breech in the area of special education, the Board articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreason for its hiring decision. See id. On the facts of this case, we agree with the district courtโs denial of individual \nrelief to Breech. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n8 \n ",

Marengo County was among the systems required by the decree to adopt a desegregation \nplan for the 1967-68 school year (Id., at p. 7), and the three judge panelโs proposal (Id., Exhibit A) conceived the \nfreedom of choice plan later instituted in Marengo County. \n \n2  Circuit Judge Richard Rives and District Judge Frank Johnson authored this decree. \n   \n3  The plan adopted by the panel was, for the most part, that of the United States Office of Education, but the panel \n  added provisions concerning faculty assignment, majority to minority transfers, and other matters. \n \n4  Zone 1โs eastern boundary touches briefly on the Wilcox County line. \n   \n5  The panel required, for the most part, compliance with the faculty and staff provisions set out in Singleton v. Jackson \n  Municipal Separate School District, 419 F.2d 1211 (5th Cir. 1970). \n \n6  In this zone, the Putnam School was to be closed and consolidated with the Sweetwater-Coxheath complex. The \n  Myrtlewood School was to be closed and its students were to be sent to the Linden City School System. Some \n19 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Marengo County Bd. of Ed., 454 F.Supp. 918 (1978)   \n \n \ninterchanging was to occur on the Sweetwater and Coxheath campuses, since most subjects were offered only at \none or the other. \n \n7  Pupils from the two high schools were to interchange campuses for required subjects and extracurricular activities \n  that were offered at only one campus. \n \n8  The Board proposed in Zone 1 to convene all students in all grades at one school for one required class, then to \n  return them to their respective schools. The same proposal was advanced for students in Zone 2. \n \n9  Such a plan required the bussing of entire grades from one school to the other, but the effect was to eliminate any \n  course duplication in required or vocational courses. \n \n10  The 1973 order set up the tri-zone plan and required, Inter alia, that there be no duplication of required courses or \n  of vocational home economics or agribusiness in grades 10-12 at Marengo and Sweetwater; that the required \ncourses of English, Social Studies, and Physical Education be equitably allocated between the two schools; and that \ncourses in grades 7-9 at Sweetwater and Coxheath be equitably allocated to the extent that there be no course \nduplication in these grades. Lee v. Marengo County Board of Education, Civil Action No. 5945-70-H (S.D.Ala., July 16, \n1973). \n \n11  Although the Superintendent of the Board has conceded that the primary responsibility for the course-sharing \n  program is his (Deposition of Fred Ramsey, intervenorโs Exhibit 18, at p. 15), the evidence is clear that day-to-day \noversight was vested in the Principals at Marengo and Sweetwater High Schools. \n \n12  Exhibit 1 to the deposition of J.

Testimony of the Superintendent \n(Ramsey Deposition, intervenorโs Exhibit 18, at pp. 7-8) indicates that he did not conceive of there being any specific \nboundaries in the county system and that student assignment was based on tradition, with students in any given \narea attending the school that has always served that area. However, in view of the remedy adopted, Infra, \nrescinding the use of zone lines, the Court notes that such violations will not be able to occur in the future. \n \n20  Whether the white students would attend the majority black schools is a separate question which, in light of this \n  Courtโs experience with the Wilcox County School System, would most probably be answered in the negative. See \nUnited States v. Wilcox County Board of Education, Civil Action No. 3934-65-H (S.D.Ala.). Thus the Court faces \nlimited options: some desegregation through artificial maintenance of majority white schools in a majority black \nsystem; or complete segregation to the extent that the system will have only black students.

Washington County Bd. of Educ., Not Reported in F.2d (1980)   \n23 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1472 \n \n \n1  On February 10, 1977, the district court entered an order that, among other things, found the Washington County \n  public school system โhas achieved a unitary status and is desegregated in nature.โ The United States Department \nof Justice on March 16, 1977, objected to the order, expressly noting that the pending motion for further relief filed \nby the NEA โraised some question as to whether the school district has ever operated in compliance with the \n[January 22, 1970] Court Order.โ The district court denied the objection without opinion on October 13, 1977. On \nJuly 31, 1978, the Department of Justice reasserted its objection to the district courtโs February 10, 1977, order by \nfiling a post-trial brief in the present motion proceeding, requesting that the district court reconsider its prior order. \nThe district court declined reconsideration. See Lee v. Washington County Bd. of Educ., 456 F.Supp. 1175, 1187, 23 \nFEP Cases 1459, 1467 (S.D.Ala.1978). The Department of Justice did not appeal. \n \n2  The NEA presented six individual claims of employment discrimination to the district court. The court held that the \n  Board discriminated against Rubye Nelson on the basis of race by failing to hire her as a summer school English \nteacher in 1977. It also held that the Board discriminated against Brenda Fancher on the basis of race by failing to \nrenew her contract as a special education teacher for the 1977-78 school year. The district court granted relief to \nboth Nelson and Fancher and the Board did not appeal. \nIn addition to rejecting the individual claims of employment discrimination brought on behalf of Roberts, \nStephens, and Breech, the district court denied relief to George Holcombe, an applicant for the position of high \nschool principal for the 1976-77 school year. Prior to the hearing before the district court in this action, George \nHolcombe was appointed to and accepted a position as middle school principal in the Washington County public \nschool system. The NEA does not assert his claim of employment discrimination on appeal. \n \n3  Rather, the court expressed its concern โthat mere word of mouth notification is not in keeping with the sound \n  administrative procedures that the Board is bound by law to follow.โ 456 F.Supp. at 1181 n.9, 23 FEP Cases at 1463. \nIt further announced its conviction โthat the notice policy previously employed by the Board (or lack thereof) ought \nto be reconsidered,โ id. at 1182 n.9, 23 FEP Cases at 1463, and indicated its intention โto insist that the Board adopt \nan appropriate advertisement policy.โ Id. at 1191, 23 FEP Cases at 1470. Counsel for the Board at oral argument \nadvised this Court that, in compliance with the district courtโs admonitions, the Board now has developed and fully \nimplemented a policy of advertising to the general public the employment opportunities that arise within the school \nsystem. \n \n4  See id. at 1191 n.31, 23 FEP Cases at 1470. But see generally Long v. Sapp, 502 F.2d 34, 41, 8 FEP Cases 1079, 1084 \n  (5th Cir. 1974); Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 495 F.2d 398, 419, 8 FEP Cases 66, 80-81 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 \nU.S. 1050, 95 S.Ct. 625, 42 L.Ed.2d 644, 8 FEP Cases 1280 (1974); United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906, \n925, 5 FEP Cases 587, 601 (5th Cir. 1973). \n \n5  Roberts applied for the position of principal at McIntosh High School for the 1976-77 school year. Stephens applied \n  for the position of principal at Leroy High School for the 1976-77 school year. Superintendent Wood testified that, in \nhis opinion, both Roberts and Stephens were qualified in 1976 to serve as principals of these schools. \n \n6  The district court cited and the Board on appeal relies upon Lee v. Chambers County Bd. of Educ., 533 F.2d 132, 19 \n  FEP Cases 572 (5th Cir. 1976), for the proposition that an individual asserting a claim of employment discrimination \nmust prove that he was the most qualified applicant for the position. This misapprehends the holding in Chambers \nCounty. As evidenced by our subsequent decision in Davis v. Board of School Commโrs, Chambers County can only \nsupport the proposition that โ[w]here the defendant offers sufficient proof that white recipients of promotions are \nbetter qualified than the black individual who alleges discrimination, then the district courtโs denial of injunctive \nrelief and damages to that plaintiff is proper.โ 600 F.2d at 474, 22 FEP Cases at 1581. \n8 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Washington County Bd. of Educ., Not Reported in F.2d (1980)   \n23 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1472 \n \n \n7  The NEA also attempted to show that (1) Roberts and Stephens belong to a racial minority, (2) they applied and \n  were qualified for positions for which the Board was seeking applicants, (3) the Board rejected them despite their \nqualifications, and (4) the Board appointed nonminorities to the positions. It thus attempted to raise an inference of \npurposeful discrimination through proof of the four-prong test established by the Supreme Court in McDonnell \nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 677, 5 FEP Cases 965, 969 (1973). A \nparty  may  utilize  proof  of  the  McDonnel  Douglas  factors  to  raise  an  inference  of  purposeful  employment \ndiscrimination in a case brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981. See Crawford v. Western Elec. Co., 614 F.2d 1300, 1315, 22 \nFEP Cases 819, 829 (5th Cir. 1980). We need not decide whether the evidence presented by the NEA was sufficient \nto raise an inference of purposeful discrimination because, in the context of this case, any showing by clear and \nconvincing proof that Roberts and Stephens would not have been employed absent the classbased discrimination \nclearly would suffice to rebut the inference of purposeful discrimination raised by proof of the McDonnell Douglas \nfactors. See generally id. at 1320-21, 22 FEP Cases at 833-834. \nIt is appropriate to note one other matter. If an employer is unable to prove by clear and convincing evidence that \nthe individual member of the class seeking relief would not have been hired absent the discrimination, individual \nrelief must be awarded unless special circumstances are present. See McCormick v. Attala County Bd. of Educ., \n541 F.2d 1094, 1095, 18 FEP Cases 1759, 1760 (5th Cir. 1976); Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d \n211, 253, 7 FEP Cases 1115, 1148 (5th Cir. 1974). The record is devoid of evidence of special circumstances that \nwould prevent relief in this action. \n \n8  The evidence presented to the district court discloses the following statistical information: \n   \n9  The evidence presented to the district court discloses the following statistical information: \n   \n*  Includes teachers employed under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \n   \n10  The evidence presented to the district court discloses the following statistical information: \n   \n*  Includes teachers employed under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \n   \n11  The evidence presented to the district court discloses the following statistical information: \n   \n12  The NEA also introduced evidence showing that (1) Breech belongs to a racial minority, (2) she expressed an interest \n  in and was qualified for a position for which the Board was seeking applicants, (3) the Board rejected her despite her \nqualifications, and (4) the Board appointed a nonminority to the position. As in the case of Roberts and Stephens, \nthe NEA thus attempted to raise an inference of purposeful discrimination through proof of the fourprong test \nestablished in McDonnell Douglas. See note 7, supra. The district court placed no weight on Breechโs failure to apply \nfor the specific position of special education coordinator and assumed that the NEA proved a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination. See 456 F.Supp. at 1189.23 FEP Cases at 1469. However, the district court rejected Breechโs \nindividual claim for relief, holding that, by showing that the successful applicant for the position of special education \ncoordinator had more experience than Breech in the area of special education, the Board articulated a legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for its hiring decision. See id. On the facts of this case, we agree with the district courtโs \ndenial of individual relief to Breech. \n \n12  The NEA also introduced evidence showing that (1) Breech belongs to a racial minority, (2) she expressed an interest \n  in and was qualified for a position for which the Board was seeking applicants, (3) the Board rejected her despite her \nqualifications, and (4) the Board appointed a nonminority to the position.

Beyond the fact that the principalโs original \n  decision would have resulted in a 50/50 racial composition, there was testimony revealing that the 1975 and 1976 \nsummer school teachers corps, selected by a black principal, had both contained three blacks and one white. \n \n2  The AA certificate indicates that the holder has 30 hours beyond a masterโs degree. \n   \n3  The rank 2 certificate indicates that the holder possesses a bachelorโs degree. \n   \n4  The position was as a temporary replacement for a teacher who was ill and was unable to teach for the first few \n  weeks of school. The position was filled by Mrs. Allen, who was supposed to teach only until Mrs. Horn, the sick \n14 \n \n\n \n \nLee v.

When Mrs. Horn returned, however, Mrs. Allen was retained as a permanent \nteacher due to an increase in enrollment. Reedโs testimony was that he had already promised the position to Mrs. \nAllen at the time that Fancher spoke with him. \n \n5  Merely from a certificate standpoint, the Court finds that Fancher was qualified to teach at the second grade level. \n  Additionally, from an experience standpoint, Fancher was likely qualified to teach special education. However, there \nis no evidence indicating that she was qualified to teach english. \n \n6  Testimony revealed that at the time that Finley was hired in the early summer of 1976 it was fully expected by both \n  Finley and by the Board that she would be certified in special education by the commencement of the 1976-77 \nschool year. However, due to a miscalculation of her credit hours, she was two hours short of graduation at the start \nof the school year. She completed her requirements at Troy State University during the fall of 1977 and is now \ncertified to the requisite degree. In order to teach in the fall of 1977, the Board was compelled to obtain a \nprovisional certificate for Finley from the Alabama Department of Education. \n \n7  The testimony of Superintendent Wood revealed that Fancherโs non-renewal had been suggested by Principal Jerry \n  Reed on the ground that Fancher had not been doing her work and could not handle children. However, Reedโs \nevaluation report on Fancher (intervenorโs Exhibit 2) does not reveal that her efforts were seriously lacking. Other \ntestimony by Mary Katherine Metzger, special education coordinator for the Board, indicated that she found \nFancher to be an โaverage to below averageโ special education teacher. \n \n8  Metzgerโs personnel file (intervenorโs Exhibit 12) reveals that she had been doing course work toward her masterโs \n  degree at the University of South Alabama in 1974, and institutional records (defendantโs Exhibit 18) indicate that \nshe had her masterโs degree during the 1974-75 school year. \n \n9  While the Court is convinced that there was no showing that the lack of notice served to discriminate against \n  anyone by reason of race, the Court is concerned that mere word of mouth notification is not in keeping with the \nsound administrative procedure that the Board is bound by law to follow. Therefore, in the interest of assuring that \nthe most qualified persons are made available, the Court is convinced that the notice policy previously employed by \nthe Board (or lack thereof) ought to be reconsidered. \n \n10  The January 26, 1978 report by the Board (intervenorโs Exhibit 6) indicates that Leroy High School has 345 white \n  students and 230 black students, a 60%/40% Ratio. \n \n11  The 1978 report (note 10, Supra ) indicates that there are 29 white teachers and 9 black teachers at Leroy, a ratio of \n  76%/24%. \n \n12  Since the Court has concluded, Supra at note 9, that the failure to advertise did not serve to discriminate by race \n  against anyone, the Court rejects the intervenorโs theory that each applicant for any position ought to have been \nconsidered for every position. Rather, since most applications sought specific positions, the Court will limit its \nanalysis to those applicants seeking specific positions. \n \n13  Testimony by Superintendent Wood indicated that the Board considers Holcombeโs complaints mooted by his \n  appointment to a principalship position at the Chatom Middle School prior to the 1977-78 school year. Wood \ntestified that Holcombe was only interested in the Chatom Middle School position, in spite of his letter of \napplication (intervenorโs Exhibit 26) indicating an interest in any administrative opening. This testimony was \nunsubstantiated so the Court will consider Holcombeโs qualifications along with all the others. \n \n14  The 1978 report (note 10, Supra ) indicates that McIntosh High has 196 white students and 340 black students, a \n15 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Washington County Bd. of Ed., 456 F.Supp. 1175 (1978)   \n23 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1459 \n \n  37%/63% Ratio. \n \n15  The 1978 report (note 10, Supra ) indicates that McIntosh High has 13 white teachers and 14 black teachers, a \n  48%/52% Ratio. \n \n16  Two other individuals were considered by the McIntosh Board of Trustees at its July 3, 1976 meeting, Irby Windham \n  Pittman of Prattville and Fred Thomas, Jr. of Selma (intervenorโs Exhibit 23). No evidence was adduced at trial with \nrespect to the qualifications of either of these individuals. \n \n17  See Findings of Fact 25(b), (c), (d) & (f), Supra. \n   \n18  It is clear from the institutional records (defendantโs Exhibits 14-19) that Weaver had at least 6 years experience as a \n  principal, but it is not clear whether he had served as principal at any time prior to 1970-71. \n \n19  It is interesting to note that although Gallasneed Weaver is a member of the intervenorโs organization (defendantโs \n  Exhibit 13) and was considered to be one of the two best qualified applicants on an objective basis (see text), the \nNEA has not raised the issue of whether he was discriminated against by reason of his race. It is perhaps likely that \nthe NEA finds some races more worthy of representation than others. \n \n20  The 1978 report (note 10, Supra ) indicates that Washington County High School has 283 white students and 92 \n  black students, a ratio of 75%/25%. \n \n21  The 1978 report (note 10, Supra ) reveals that Washington County High has 19 white teachers and 4 black teachers, \n  a ratio of 83%/17%. \n \n22  See Findings of Fact 25(a), (c), (d), & (f), Supra. \n   \n23  George Holcombe was the head basketball coach at Washington County High for two years, while Mamie Johnson \n  and Doris Bonds are presently coaching girlsโ basketball at Leroy and McIntosh High Schools, respectively. Other \nblacks, the evidence revealed, have served as assistant coaches in various sports in various schools. \n \n24  The Court does not place any weight on the fact that Breech did not apply for the position since, as a result of the \n  Boardโs advertising policies, See Note 9, Supra, and accompanying text, Breech did not learn of the position until it \nhad already been filled. \n \n25  The Roberts application is limited, in the Courtโs opinion, to the opening at McIntosh High School (See intervenorโs \n  Exhibit 21). Similarly, the Court concludes that the Stephens application was limited to Leroy (See intervenorโs \nExhibit 24). Holcombe, however, was apparently interested in any principalship in the system. \n \n26  The Court acknowledges that its conclusion that the Board failed to utilize non-racial objective criteria in its selection \n  process is a sufficient basis for this Court to throw out the 1976 selections and require new selections to be made. \nThis would be a futile requirement, however, since the experience obtained by each of the principals selected, \nwhether selected properly or improperly, would make them the most objectively qualified candidate in each school. \n \n27  See Note 25 Supra. \n   \n28  See note 26 Supra. \n   \n29  See note 25 Supra. \n16 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Washington County Bd. of Ed., 456 F.Supp. 1175 (1978)   \n23 Fair Empl.Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1459 \n \n   \n30  See note 26 Supra. \n   \n31  Without concluding that the advertising procedures necessarily discriminate against black persons, the Court does \n  conclude that such procedures mitigate against the search for the most qualified applicants and therefore requires \nthat new procedures be installed. The intervenor contends that this is not enough and that the Board should be \nrequired to affirmatively seek out and employ qualified persons for the head coaching and central office positions. \nWhile such an affirmative remedy is well within this Courtโs authority by virtue of the past history of segregation in \nthis district, See Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978), \nthe Court is convinced that the failure of the record to indicate that the advertising policies have actually served to \ndiscriminate militates against such an affirmative remedy. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n17 \n ",
