    "summary": "<p>This Clearinghouse entry discusses the post 1970 proceedings in <em>Lee v. Macon County</em>, a seminal Alabama desegregation case. That case originated in the Middle District of Alabama and was transferred to a three-judge district court which supervised school desegregation across the state. However, after 1970, the statewide case was dissolved and desegregation cases in individual school districts were sent to the judicial districts that encompassed them. This Clearinghouse entry describes the <em>Lee</em> litigation in the Middle District of Alabama after 1970. To read about what happened between 1963, when the case was filed, and 1970, please see <a href=\"../../../../case/10878/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <em>Lee v. Macon County Bd. of Ed</em></a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Pre-1997 Litigation</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Chambers County</strong></p>\r\n<p>Like many other Alabama jurisdictions, Chambers County was bound by a desegregation plan created by the original <em>Lee</em> three-judge district court. In the 1980s, some portions of the county chose to incorporate their communities into the new city of Valley, Alabama. Valley residents hoped to operate their own school district, but when they sought preclearance from the DOJ &ndash; as required by the Voting Rights Act at the time &ndash; they were denied. In February of 1992, the city then moved to intervene in the <em>Lee</em> case concerning Chambers County. After making changes to the structure of its elected school board, Valley received pre-clearance from the DOJ in July 1992. However, the county Board of Education still opposed the split. However, after a bench trial, on August 8, 1994 District Judge W. Harold Albritton III found that allowing Valley to operate its own school system would impede desegregation in Chambers County schools, and accordingly barred it. 849 F.Supp. 1474. Valley later moved to alter that judgment, but Judge Albritton denied that motion. 859 F.Supp. 1470.</p>\r\n<p>Around the same time as the splinter district litigation, Chambers County also received judicial scrutiny for allowing some students to attend schools in neighboring counties, which violated the 1970 desegregation order. Judge Albritton enjoined this practice as well in a February 1994 order. 1994 WL 241165.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Geneva County</strong></p>\r\n<p>Geneva County Alabama was also bound by a desegregation plan created by the three-judge district court. After a high school in the county was destroyed by fire in December of 1994, the county and the state of Alabama went to federal court to decide where a replacement would be sited. In July of 1995, Judge W. Harold Albritton III approved a new site, however, he retained supervision of the county under the desegregation plan. 892 F.Supp. 1387.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Randolph County</strong></p>\r\n<p>The <em>Lee</em> case was reopened in Randolph County, Alabama when Hulond Humphries, the principal of the county high school, apparently canceled prom after learning that mixed race student couples would attend and referred to a mixed race student in attendance as a &ldquo;mistake.&rdquo; (This was not Principal Humphries first interaction with the <em>Lee</em> litigation &ndash; in 1974 the Fifth Circuit had found that an attempt by Humphries to expel two apparently Black students from school violated the students&rsquo; Due Process rights. 490 F.2d 458.) After an investigation by the DOJ Civil Rights Division, the county school board and the DOJ reached a consent decree in 1994 that included numerous provisions aimed at improving the integration of Randolph County schools. Later, the DOJ and the county agreed that Humphries could continue to work for the County as a consultant but would not be allowed to appear on school campuses or have contact with students. Members of the local Black community objected to this settlement; however, after a fairness hearing, Judge Myron Thompson approved it on February 17, 1995. 160 F.R.D. 642. Judge Thompson later granted the attorneys representing Black Randolph residents attorney&rsquo;s fees under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1988. 885 F.Supp. 1526.</p>\r\n<p>Randolph County operated its schools under court supervision until June of 2021. Prior to that, it had been bound by the 1994 consent decree, except for some small modifications made in the early 2010s. In early 2021, the County moved for unitary status, and the DOJ did not object. Judge Thompson thus released Randolph County schools from federal supervision for the first time in over fifty years. 2021 WL 2554622.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Russell County</strong></p>\r\n<p>Russell County, Alabama was also bound by a desegregation plan created by the three-judge district court. After it refused to renew the employment contracts of several teachers of color in 1979, the county school board was challenged in federal court by the National Education Association as part of the greater <em>Lee</em> litigation. The district court found that the school board acted properly. However, it was later reversed by the Eleventh Circuit, which found that the district court did not properly apply the test for determining whether an employment discharge was racially motivated set out by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</em>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). 684 F.2d 769. However, on remand, the school board prevailed again in a bench trial before District Judge Robert E. Varner, and the result of that trial was later affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit. 744 F.2d 768.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Unitary Status and the End of the </em>Lee<em> Litigation</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Various <em>Lee</em> cases continued to be litigated across Alabama through the 80s and 90s. However, in February of 1997, Judge Myron H. Thompson began the process of ending many of the Middle District <em>Lee</em> cases. (Interestingly, Judge Thompson was a 1965 graduate of Tuskegee Institute High School, one of the high schools implicated in the original <em>Lee. v. Macon County</em> case. <em>See</em> <a href=\"https://www.almd.uscourts.gov/judges/honorable-myron-h-thompson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Honorable Myron H. Thompson: Biography</a>.) Judge Thompson ordered the DOJ to begin the process by conferring with each defendant school district (in the Middle District) and submitting joint proposals as to how the court should proceed in each of those cases toward a declaration of unitary status. This new, proactive stance from the court was at least partially motivated by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s opinion in <a href=\"../../../../detail.php?id=11120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Freeman v. Pitts</em>, 503 U.S. 467 (1992)</a>, which states, &ldquo;Returning schools to the control of local authorities at the earliest practicable date is essential to restore their true accountability in our governmental system.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>This new initiative prompted the Government to ask the court whether the statewide parties in the original 1963 litigation (the Governor and the State Board of Education) were still party to each of <em>Lee</em>&rsquo;s progeny cases. On April 21, 1997, the court decided that they were, 963 F.Supp. 1122, meaning winding down the <em>Lee</em> litigation would involve the state of Alabama, as well as the individual districts. As a result, on February 3, 1998, the court ordered the parties to report to the court on the status of all statewide issues, and on July 31, 1998, the parties submitted a joint statement identifying two unresolved statewide issues: (1) the over-representation of Black students in learning and emotionally disabled classifications and the under-representation of Black students in gifted and talented programs; and (2) facilities. A sign of <em>Lee</em>'s status as a legacy case, the joint statement was signed by Fred Gray Jr., son of the Fred Gray (Sr.) who filed the initial complaint in 1963. On August 30, 2000, the court approved the consent decree, with the express goal of having them addressed so that the court could remove itself from the schools&rsquo; administration. 2000 WL 33680483.</p>\r\n<p>Over the next decade Judge Thompson found that school districts across the Middle District had reached unitary status. 2002 WL 237032 (City of Opelika); 2002 WL 237091 (City of Auburn); 2002 WL 31102679 (City of Alexander); 2002 WL 360000 (Russell County); 2002 WL 31757973 (Tallapoosa County); 183 F.Supp.2d 1359 (Butler County); 2002 WL 1268395 &amp; 2005 WL 2850111 (Lee County); 2004 WL 1809877 (Elmore County); 2004 WL 1699068 (Autauga County); 2005 WL 2850392 (City of Phenix); 2006 WL 269942 (Covington County); 2007 WL 1196482 (City of Roanoke)</p>\r\n<p>On March 8 and April 28, 2007, Judge Thompson declared that the state of Alabama had fulfilled its constitutional duties as to the two remaining aspects of its statewide injunction and, on May 22, 2006, declared that Macon County itself had reached unitary status (2006 WL 1381873), thus dissolving the core substantive and symbolic components of the case. Some aspects of the case still dragged on though. In 2009, Judge Thompson found that school facilities across the state came into compliance with a 2006 consent order. 2009 WL 1231497. And in some counties, <em>Lee</em> lasted over a decade after most defendants were dismissed. <em>See e.g.</em>, 2021 WL 2554622.</p>\r\n<p>The case is officially closed; however, the record does leave uncertainty as to whether there are any outstanding injunctions in effect, for instance, in counties that had their initial desegregation proposals approved and thus were never made party to any post-1970 litigation and thus were never formally declared unitary. The unusual and convoluted history of this case potentially leaves several such elements up for interpretation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dockets</strong></p>\r\n<p>When the statewide case was split up, the original Macon County case was given a new docket number, 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB, and the remaining school districts were assigned the following captions and docket numbers:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Lee v.

The defendants are the Macon\nCounty  Board  of  Education  and  its  members  and\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 2 of 21\nsuperintendent, as well as the Alabama State Board of\nEducation,  its  members,  the  State  Superintendent  of\nEducation and the Governor of Alabama.  The Macon County\nBoard  of  Education  and  its  members  and  superintendent\nhave  moved  for  declaration  of  unitary  status  and\ntermination of this litigation.  Based on the evidence\npresented, the court concludes that the motion should be\ngranted and that this litigation should be terminated as\nto the Macon County Board of Education and its members\nand superintendent.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Early Litigation\nThis case began in 1963 when several black students\nand  their  parents  sued  the  Macon  County  Board  of\nEducation and its superintendent seeking relief from the\ncontinued  operation  of  a  racially  segregated  school\nsystem.  On July 16, 1963, the United States was added as\nplaintiff-intervenor and amicus curiae in order that the\n2\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 3 of 21\npublic interest in the administration of justice would be\nrepresented.  Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 267\nF.Supp.  458,  460  (M.D.  Ala.  1967)  (three-judge  court)\n(per curiam).  In a hearing before a single-judge court,\nthe Macon County Board was enjoined to make an immediate\nstart to desegregate its schools โwithout discrimination\nbased on race or color.โ  Lee v. Macon County Board of\nEducation, 221 F.Supp. 297, 300 (M.D. Ala. 1963).  \nAfter  actions  by  the  State  of  Alabama  to  prevent\nimplementation of this order, the Macon County plaintiffs\nfiled an amended and supplemental complaint in February\n1964 alleging that the Alabama State Board of Education,\nits members, the State Superintendent, and the Governor\nas president of the state board, had asserted general\ncontrol and supervision over all public schools in the\nState in order to maintain a de jure segregated school\nsystem.  The court found that it was the policy of the\nState to promote and encourage a dual school system based\non race, and the state officials were made defendants.\n3\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 4 of 21\nLee v. Macon County Board of Education, 231 F.Supp. 743\n(M.D. Ala. 1964) (three-judge court) (per curiam).  In\nsubsequent  orders,  the  Lee  Court  ordered  the  State\nSuperintendent of Education to require school districts\nthroughout the State to desegregate their schools.  Lee\nv. Macon County Bd. of Educ., 292 F.Supp. 363 (M.D. Ala.\n1968)  (three-judge  court)  (per  curiam);  Lee  v.  Macon\nCounty Bd. of Educ., 267 F.Supp. 458 (M.D. Ala. 1967)\n(three-judge court) (per curiam).  On June 24, 1970, the\nthree-judge  court  in  Lee  transferred  the  jurisdiction\nover 35 school districts involved in the Lee litigation,\nincluding the Macon County School District, to a single\ndistrict judge of the United States District Court for\nthe  Middle  District  of  Alabama,  where  the  school\ndistricts were located. \nOver  the  next  several  years,  this  court  granted\nseveral  requests  by  the  Macon  County  School  Board  to\nalter and change the boundaries of the school district\nlines or to alter school plans.  In 1991, the board moved\n4\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 5 of 21\nto consolidate all of the high school grades in Macon\nCounty into a single high school facility in Tuskegee.\nA group of students, parents and others who opposed the\nclosure  of  the  high  school  at  Notasulga  were  granted\nleave to intervene.  At that time, the student enrollment\nat  Notasulga  High  School  was  42  %  white.    The\nconsolidated high school was projected to be 94 % black.\nThe  intervenors  objected  to  the  closure  of  the  only\nnonracially identifiable high school in the district.  On\nAugust  1,  1991,  Judge  Robert  E.  Varner  of  this  court\ndenied  the  boardโs  petition  as  it  applied  to  the\nNotasulga High School, but granted the petition in all\nother respects.  That decision was affirmed on appeal.\nLee v. Macon County Bd. of Educ., 970 F.2d 767 (11th Cir.\n1992), rehโg granted and opinion vacated, 987 F.2d 1521\n(11th Cir. 1993), affโd by an equally divided court, 995\nF.2d 184 (11th Cir. 1993).\nOn August 19, 2005, this court granted the boardโs\nmotion to close two elementary schools and open a new\n5\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 6 of 21\nelementary  school  in  the  Tuskegee  area.    Notasulga\nstudents  were  not  affected.    A  motion  to  intervene\nopposing the closure of South Macon Elementary School was\ndenied.\nB.  School District Profile\nThe  Macon  County School District  is  the  only \npublic school  system in  Macon County.  As noted above,\naccording  to  2000  census  data,  Macon  County  has  a\npopulation that is 84.6 % black.  The  Macon  County\nBoard of Education is  comprised  of five board members,\ntwo    black    females    and    three    black  males.    The\nSuperintendent  of  the Macon County schools is a black\nmale. \nThere are seven schools in the district, including\nLewis  Adams  Early  Childhood  Center,  George  Washington\nCarver  Elementary  School,  Tuskegee  Public  Elementary\nSchool,  Tuskegee  Institute  Middle  School,  Booker  T.\nWashington High School, Deborah Cannon Wolfe School, and\n6\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 7 of 21\nNotasulga High School.  All of the Macon County schools\nare accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges\nand Schools.  The budget of the Macon County schools is\nalmost $ 30 million per year. \nDuring this 2005-2006 school year, 3,441 students are\nenrolled  in  the  district,  3,368  or  98  %  of  whom  are\nblack.  Almost all of the white students attend Notasulga\nwhere they now make up 14 % of the student enrollment.\nThe  Macon  County  School  System  employs  242  certified\nstaff  members,  of  whom  96  %  are  black.    Another  168\nemployees  are  non-certified  staff,  of  whom  95  %  are\nblack.  \nC.  State-wide Issues\nOver the course of years, as litigation affecting the\nindividual school districts was dealt with by the courts\nas separate matters, the state defendants (that is, the\nAlabama State Board of Education, its board members, the\nState Superintendent of Education, and the Governor of\n7\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 8 of 21\nAlabama) did not participate in litigation affecting the\nMacon County school system.  The question arose as to\nwhether the state defendants were even parties in the\nlocal off-shoots of the Lee cases.  Previous rulings,\nparticularly  Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 267\nF.Supp.  458  (M.D.  Ala.  1967)  (three-judge  court)  (per\ncuriam), aff'd sub nom.  Wallace v. United States, 389\nU.S.  215  (1967),  held  that  the  state  defendants  were\nresponsible  for  the  creation  and  maintenance  of\nsegregated public education in the State of Alabama.  The\ncourt found that state officials had \"engaged in a wide\nrange  of  activities  to  maintain  segregated  public\neducation ... [which] controlled virtually every aspect\nof public education in the state.\"  Lee, 267 F.Supp. at\n478.  \nThis  court  subsequently  affirmed  that,  despite\ncessation of participation by the state defendants when\nthe individual district cases were transferred, the state\ndefendants continue as parties in not only the state-wide\n8\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 9 of 21\nlitigation, but in all the off-shoot cases.  Lee v. Lee\nCounty Board of Education, 963 F.Supp. 1122, 1124, 1130\n(M.D.  Ala.  1997).    The  parties  identified  two  issues\nremaining  in  the  state-wide  litigation,  โspecial\neducationโ and โfacilities.โ  The state-wide issues were\nresolved, and orders adopting the consent decrees were\nentered on August 30, 2000, and April 20, 2006.  Lee v.\nButler County Board of Education, 2000 WL 33680483 (M.D.\nAla. 2000); Lee v. Lee County Board of Education, 2006 WL\n1041994 (M.D. Ala. 2006). \nD.  Motion for Declaration of Unitary Status\nIn an order dated June 27, 2005, this court stated\nthat โthe parties should now move toward โunitary statusโ\nfor this school system and for the termination of this\nlitigation.โ  The parties proposed a period of informal\ndiscovery.  In a status conference on October 24, 2005,\nthe  parties  advised  the  court  that  the  board  should\nproceed with its motion for declaration of unitary status\n9\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 10 of 21\nwhich was filed on October 28, 2005.  A fairness hearing\nwas set for December 19, 2005, and required the board to\ngive all plaintiff class members appropriate notice of\nthe motion as well as procedures for lodging objections.\nAfter the court approved the notice form, the board\npublished, in the local newspaper over a three-week time\nperiod,  notice  of  the  proposed  termination  of  this\nlitigation and the date of the fairness hearing as well\nas historical information about the case.  The notice\nalso provided procedures for class members and interested\npersons to file comments and objections with the court\nregarding  the  proposed  dismissal  and  where  such\ninformation  could  be  obtained.    Documents  about  the\nprocess were made available at the school district office\nfrom November 3, 2005, through December 16, 2005.  Forms\nfor objections and comments were made available at the\ndistrict office and at the principalโs office at each\nMacon County public school.  Actual notice was provided\nto each parent or guardian of a student enrolled in the\n10\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 11 of 21\nMacon County School District.  On December 19, 2005, the\ncourt  held  a  fairness  hearing  on  the  motion  for\ndeclaration of unitary status and termination.\nThe court concludes that the Macon County Board of\nEducation complied with the directives of the court in\nproviding adequate notice of the proposed dismissal to\nclass members as well as to the community.  Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 23(e).\nII.  DISCUSSION\nA.   Standards for Termination of a School\nDesegregation Case\nIt has long been recognized that the goal of a school\ndesegregation case is to convert promptly from a de jure\nsegregated  school  system  to  a  system  without  โwhiteโ\nschools or โblackโ schools, but just schools.  Green v.\nCounty School Bd. Of New Kent, 391 U.S. 430, 442 (1968).\nThe  success  of  this  effort  leads  to  the  goal  of\nultimately returning control to the local school board\nsince  โlocal  autonomy  of  school  districts  is  a  vital\n11\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 12 of 21\nnational tradition.โ  Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 490\n(1992) (quoting Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman,\n433  U.S.  406,  410  (1977)).  Returning  schools  to  the\ncontrol of local authorities โat the earliest practicable\ndate is essential to restore their true accountability in\nour governmental system.โ  Id.\nThe  ultimate  inquiry  concerning  whether  a  school\ndistrict operating under a school desegregation order to\ndismantle a de jure segregated school system should be\ndeclared  unitary  is  whether  the  school  district  has\ncomplied in good faith with the desegregation decree, and\nwhether the vestiges of prior de jure segregation have\nbeen  eliminated  to  the  extent  practicable.    NAACP,\nJacksonville  Branch  v.  Duval  County  School  Board,  273\nF.3d  960,  966  (11th  Cir.  2001)  (citing  Missouri  v.\nJenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 88 (1995), and quoting Freeman v.\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 492 (1992)); see also Manning v.\nSchool Board of Hillsborough County, 244 F.3d 927, 942\n(11th  Cir.  2001),  cert.  denied,  534  U.S.824  (2001);\n12\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 13 of 21\nLockett v. Board of Education of Muscogee County), 111\nF.3d  839,  843  (11th  Cir.  1997).    Regardless,  โ[t]he\nmeasure of a desegregation plan is its effectiveness.โ\nDavis v. Board of School Commissioners, 402 U.S. 33, 37\n(1971).\nB.  December 19, 2005, Fairness Hearing\nAfter the Macon County Board of Education and its\nmembers  and  superintendent  filed  their  motion  for\ndeclaration  of  unitary  status  and  termination  of  this\nlitigation, the court required publication and notice of\nthe proposed dismissal, scheduled a fairness hearing, and\nestablished  procedures  for  filing  comments  and\nobjections.  Ten comments were filed with the court, all\nfrom  the  Notasulga  community,  expressing  concern\nregarding possible closure of the Notasulga school and\nthe loss of the only integrated school in the district.\nTwo members of the Notasulga community testified at\nthe hearing, both of whom had filed written comments.\n13\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 14 of 21\nThe first was Frank Tew, Mayor of the Town of Notasulga.\nHe testified about the importance of the school to the\ncommunity  and  requested  that  any  order  dismissing  the\ncase include a provision that the Notasulga school remain\nopen.  \nThe second community member to testify was Robert\nAnderson, the principal at the Notasulga school from 1971\nto  2002,  whose  extraordinary  personal  commitment  to\ndesegregation led to the successful integration of the\nschool.  Principal Anderson objects to unitary status and\ndismissal of this case because he believes that judicial\nsupervision is needed to ensure that the Notasulga school\nremains open, particularly the high school grades.  He\nstated that, if the community knew that the high school\ngrades  would  remain  at  Notasulga,  enrollment  would\nstabilize.  Student enrollment has declined over the past\nfew years, particularly for white students.  \nPrincipal  Anderson  also  stated  that  he  suspected\nillegal interdistrict transfers were occurring because\n14\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 15 of 21\nschool  enrollment  had  declined  quickly.    Upon\nquestioning, he indicated that he thought Macon County\nstudents  were  enrolling  in  schools  in  neighboring\ncounties, but he was unable to provide specific details\nor  the  names  of  any  students  who  are  living  in  Macon\nCounty and attending a public school in another district.\nThe final witness was the Superintendent of the Macon\nCounty School District, Willie C. Thomas, Jr., who has\nserved  in  the  position  for  three  years.    He  gave\ntestimony regarding the nondiscriminatory operation of\nthe school system and recent new school construction as\nwell as to the enrollment and census information for the\ncounty.    Superintendent  Thomas  testified  that,  on\nNovember  30,  2005,  he  sent  a  letter  to  parents  of\nstudents in the Notasulga community stating that there\nare no current plans to change the grade configuration at\nthe Notasulga school and that the five-year capital plan\nindicates  that  facility  renovations  at  the  school  are\ndistrict priorities over the next two to four years.  He\n15\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 16 of 21\nalso  testified  that  district  officials  suspected  that\nillegal interdistrict-student transfers may have occurred\nand had investigated various reports of such transfers.\nHowever,  he  was  unable  to  state  the  results  of  these\ninvestigations  nor  was  he  able  to  respond  with  any\nspecificity to the transfer allegations made by Principal\nAnderson.  \nCounsel  for  the  plaintiff  parties  cross  examined\nthese witnesses and addressed the issues raised in the\ncomments  and  in  the  testimony  of  the  witnesses,\nparticularly regarding the student-transfer allegations.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, it was determined that\nthe  Macon  County  School  Board  should  investigate  the\ninterdistrict-transfer allegations.\nC.  Post-Hearing Investigation\nThe Macon County School District has experienced a\ndecline  in  student  enrollment  over  the  past  several\nyears, and particularly during the past year.  Following\n16\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 17 of 21\nthe  fairness  heari  g,  the  board  conducted  an\ninvestigation  to  determine  if  this  decrease  is\nattributable  to  improper  student  transfers--that  is,\nwhether  students  residing  within  Macon  County  are\nattending  public  schools  outside  of  the  Macon  County\nSchool System and, if so, whether these transfers impede\ndesegregation.  \nThe  investigation  by  the  school  district  staff\nestablished  that  the  decline  in  student  enrollment  is\nattributable to several factors.  A large number of Macon\nCounty  students,  many  of  whom  are  African-American,\nattend private school, are home schooled, or have dropped\nout of school.  A number of students have moved out of\nthe county.  Of the 24 students who withdrew from the\nMacon  County  system  and  transferred  to  another  public\nschool  system  in  Alabama  this  school  year,  four  are\nwhite.  The board determined that these students are no\nlonger  residing  in  the  county.    Based  on  the  boardโs\ninvestigation, it does not appear that the decline in\n17\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 18 of 21\nstudent  enrollment  at  the  Notasulga  school  is\nattributable to improper student transfers.\nD. Compliance Efforts\n  Under the de jure system, the board assigned students\nand employees to schools based on their race.  Schools\nare  now  operated  on  a  nondiscriminatory  basis.    The\nprovision of transportation services, the operation of\nfacilities, and the assignment of students and staff are\nmade without regard to race.  Extracurricular activities\nare provided on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The board\nadvertises  for  employees  nationally,  state-wide,  and\nlocally.  No person is denied employment, or excluded\nfrom  participation,  or  is  denied  benefits  of,  or  is\nsubjected to discrimination in any program or activity on\nthe basis of disabil ty, sex, race, religion, national\norigin, color or age.\n18\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 19 of 21\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nOn  the  basis  of  the  record  evidence,  witness\ntestimony, and averments of counsel, the court finds that\nthe Macon County Board of Education and its members and\nsuperintendent  have  met  the  standards  entitling  the\nschool district to a declaration of unitary status and\ntermination of this litigation.  \nThe  Macon  County  School  Board  has  fully  and\nsatisfactorily complied with the orders of this court.\nThe  vestiges  of  the  prior  de  jure  segregated  school\nsystem have been eliminated to the extent practicable.\nThe court also finds that the board and its members and\nsuperintendent have demonstrated a good-faith commitment\nto  the  whole  of  the  courtโs  decrees  and  to  those\nprovisions of the law and the Constitution that were the\npredicate for judicial intervention in this school system\nin the first instance.  Through their compliance with the\ncourtโs  orders  over  the  years,  they  have  demonstrated\ntheir commitment to the operation of a school system in\ncompliance with the Constitution. \n19\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 20 of 21\nThe plaintiff parties have succeeded in the task they\nbegan decades ago to seek the end of the de jure system\nof  school  segregation  in  Macon  County.    This  lawsuit\nsought to bring the district into compliance with the\nconstitutional requirement of equal protection under the\nlaw, and the court states today that they have succeeded.\nNAACP, Jacksonville Branch v. Duval County Schools, 273\nF.3d 960, 976 (11th Cir. 2001).\nTherefore, with the judgment the court will enter\ntoday, control over the Macon County School System is\nreturned to the Macon County Board of Education and its\nmembers and superintendent.  The motion for declaration\nof  unitary  status  and  termination  of  this  litigation\nfiled  by  the  Macon  Board  and  its  members  and\nsuperintendent  is  granted,  all  outstanding  orders  and\ninjunctions  will  be  dissolved,  and  this  litigation\npartially dismissed as to the Macon County School Board\nand its members and superintendent.  However, the state\ndefendants are not dismissed, and the orders dealing with\n20\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00846-MHT-DRB     Document 124      Filed 05/22/2006     Page 21 of 21\nthe  state-wide  โspecial  educationโ  and  โfacilitiesโ\nissues are not dissolved.  \nDONE, this the 22nd day of May, 2006.\n   /s/ MYRON H.

Background \n\nCase 3:70-cv-00847-MHT-TFM   Document 364   Filed 04/16/13   Page 2 of 8\n  On December 15, 1994, a Consent Decree established a workforce goal of \n23% Black Category 1 Certified Employees. Between December 15, 1994 and \nMarch 31, 2009 the Court issued a series of orders aimed at achieving the Courtโs \nmandate of eliminating the vestiges of past racial discrimination and desegregating \nthe school system. \n  On  March  31,  2009  the  Court  entered  an  order  requiring  the  parties  to \nsubmit a joint report addressing โwhat issues remain in litigation.โ  On October 15, \n2009,  the  parties  filed  a  Joint  Status  Report  indicating  that  the  two  remaining \ndesegregation issues in dispute were (1) personnel hiring and assignments and (2) \nstudent discipline. \n  On  March  31,  2011  the  Court  entered  a  Consent  Order  setting  forth \nrequirements designed to resolve the outstanding issues of personnel hiring and \nassignment and student discipline. \n  On March 15, 2013 the Court held a telephone conference. All parties to the \nlitigation participated in the telephone conference.  The parties represented to the \nCourt during this telephone conference that the District had met its obligations \nwith respect to student discipline, and that the parties had reached an agreement on \nthe two remaining issues in dispute:  personnel hiring and interim employment of \n  2\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00847-MHT-TFM   Document 364   Filed 04/16/13   Page 3 of 8\nteachers.    The  parties  represented  to  the  Court  during  this  conference  that  all \nremaining issues in this case had been resolved. \n  Based on the representation of the parties made to the Court during the \nconference call on March 15, 2013, the Court issued an Order on March 19, 2013 \nrequiring the parties to submit their proposed settlement by April 1, 2013. \n  In an effort to avoid further litigation, the parties have engaged in good faith \nnegotiations and voluntarily agreed, as indicated by the signatures of their counsel \nbelow,  for  entry  of  this  Consent  order  to  resolve  the  outstanding  issues  of \npersonnel hiring and assignment. \n  Accordingly, after reviewing the agreed to terms, the Court concludes that \nentry of this Consent Order1 is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited  States  Constitution  and  federal  laws,  and  that  its  entry  will  further  the \norderly  desegregation  of  the  Randolph  County  School  System.    Therefore,  the \nDistrict is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DIRECTED to implement the \nprovisions set forth below. \nII.  PERSONNEL HIRING \n  In the December 15, 1994 Consent Decree, the Court stated, among other \nthings, that the percentage of Black employees in certified positions had decreased \nsignificantly.  Based on the relevant labor pool, the Court ordered, among other \n                                                 \n1 Where this Consent Order conflicts with sections of prior Consent Orders of this Court, it shall supersede and \nreplace those sections. \n  3\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00847-MHT-TFM   Document 364   Filed 04/16/13   Page 4 of 8\nthings, that within four years of the entry of the 1994 Consent Decree the District \nshall  attain  a  23%  Black  workforce  in  the  category  consisting  of  assistant \nsuperintendent,  speech  therapists,  nurses,  special  education  coordinator,  federal \nprograms coordinator, principals, assistant principals, director of vocational school, \nteachers, itinerant teachers, librarians, itinerant librarians, coaches, counselors, and \nitinerate counselors.  Id. at 7.  (Collectively referenced as โCategory 1โ.) \n  Because  the  District  had  not  met  the  23%  goal  of  Black  Category  1 \npersonnel,  the  Court  on  March  3,  2011  entered  a  Consent  Order  substantially \nmodifying the procedures, practices and policies contained in the 1994 Consent \nDecree. \n  During the telephone conference with the Court on March 12, 2013, the \nparties recommended that the Court leave in place all of the remedial steps set \nforth in the Consent Decree of March 31, 2011 but change the Category 1 goal \nfrom 23% Black to 16% Black with the following conditions:  The District must \nobtain the Category 1 goal of 16% Black within three years.  Once the District \nobtains the Category 1 goal of 16% Black, the District must maintain the Category \n1 percentage of 16% Black for two consecutive years whenever that benchmark \noccurs within the three-year requirement.  Stated otherwise, if the District obtains \nthe Category percentage of 16% Black in year one after the date of this Consent \n  4\n\nCase 3:70-cv-00847-MHT-TFM   Document 364   Filed 04/16/13   Page 5 of 8\nOrder, the District from that date forward must maintain a Category 1 percentage \nof 16% Black for two consecutive years.  If the District obtains a Category 1 \npercentage of 16% Black in year two or year three, the District shall maintain 16% \nBlack Category 1 employment for two consecutive years thereafter. \nIII.  Interim Employment of Teachers \n  Personnel decisions made by the Randolph County Board of Education must \nbe  made  in  conformity  with  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Consent  Order \nadopted by the Court on March 31, 2011, and the relevant provisions of the 1994 \nConsent Decree that are not in conflict therewith. \n  While  all  personnel  decisions  made  by  the  District  must  be  made  in \nconformity with the March 31, 2011 Consent Order together with the relevant \nprovisions of the 1994 Consent Decree that are not in conflict therewith, the parties \nrequested  the  Court  to  approve  a  procedure  regarding  unanticipated  teaching \nvacancies at the start of each school  year.  When such vacancies occur at the start \nof  each  school  year,  they  create  a  significant  impediment  for  the  education \nprogram of affected students if the teaching positions are not filled expeditiously. \n  Under the general requirements set forth in the March 31, 2011 Consent \nDecree, a three step process for each vacancy must be followed:  (1) the positions \nmust  be  posted  in  compliance  with  Ala.

This has been done in prior similar cases. See, e.g., Lee v. Washington County Board of Education, 625 F.2d \n1235 (5th Cir. 1980). For convenience we will refer to Crenshaw and Walker as plaintiffs. \n \n2  There is no Chavala Junior High School as a separate institution. The parties sometimes referred to Chavala Junior \n  High, however, as a designation of the junior high grades at Chavala High School. \n \n3  The court subsequently issued written findings and conclusions with no substantial deviations from its bench ruling \n  except for that discussed in note 5 infra. \n5 \n \n\n \n \nLee v.

No difference in analysis is contended \n  to result from this second theory of action and so we limit our discussion in text to a s 1983 analysis. We note, \nhowever, that where the controversy arises out of a school desegregation order the nature of defendantโs rebuttal \nburden may be greater. See note 7 infra; McWilliams v. Escambia County School Board, 658 F.2d 326, 331 n.2 (5th \nCir. 1981); Lee v.

See note 5, supra. \n \n8  And in the case of Dr. Barnes, motivated by his support for racial minority teachers. \n   \n9  See Golf City, Inc. v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 555 F.2d 426, 435 (5th Cir. 1977): \n \nโWe have concluded that the findings of the district court do not provide a sufficiently \ndefinite  predicate  for  proper  appellate  review.  Many  of  the  findings  are  couched  in \nconclusory terms. Some are announced solely as ultimate findings without support which \nclearly reflected a choice between conflicting accounts of events or between alternative \nlegal interpretations of those events.

There is no evidence concerning the relative qualifications of those retained, and \nCrenshaw is the only one shown to have been replaced by a nonminority person. Moreover, there is some doubt \nwhether Barnesโ case is properly analyzed under the traditional McDonnell Douglas factors at all, as discussed \nabove. \n \n12  The nonrenewal of an untenured teacher is not unconstitutional simply because it was done for no reason.

The Court has \nconsidered that testimony but chooses to make no findings on that issue since effect and impact rather than intent \nis the critical inquiry under these circumstances. Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 462, 92 S.Ct. \n2196, 2203, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972); United States v.

The court \ndoes note that the evidence shows no racial motivation on the part of Arnold or Doss Leak, Rodney Fuller or Bobby \nCrowder. The court further notes, however, that considering all the evidence there is ample justification for \nPlaintiffsโ contention that a reasonable perception has been created in the AfricanโAmerican community in the \ncounty that racial considerations were a factor in the decision to create a separate school system in Valley. Plaintiffs \ncontend that, because of this perception, formation of the separate system will convey a sense of exclusion to the \nAfricanโAmerican community in Chambers County. They point out that this is the purpose of this evidence, not an \neffort to prove actual intent. The court, however, does not base its decision on any such perception. \n \n7  Contrary to the reference in VโEx 2 at 7, the identified site is outside the current Valley City limits and voting district \n  6 in Valley. 3B Tr. 236, 237; 5 Tr. 38 [A. Leak]. \n \n8  Despite not having examined the facts, Dr. Hall expressed the opinion that the quality of education in Chambers \n  County would continue to improve under current leadership even after Valley withdrew. 2 Tr. 38 [Hall]. \n29 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Chambers County Bd. of Educ., 849 F.Supp. 1474 (1994)   \n91 Ed. Law Rep. 166 \n \n \n9  Excluded from these calculations were expenditures for special programs funded from categorical aid sources, \n  including Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, CNP [child nutrition programs], vocational, adult, adult basic and community \neducation. 8 Tr. 51โ52 [Riley]. \n \n10  Riley assumed that the surviving county district would reimburse Valley for the cost of transporting students in \n  grades 1โ6 to Huguley Elementary School. CCโEx 4, at 3; 7 Tr. 64, 75 [Riley]. \n \n11  A number of witnesses testified that transportation costs would be much higher in a sparsely populated rural area \n  like the surviving Chambers County district than in an urban area such as Valley. 3โA Tr. 39โ40 [McClain]; 7 Tr. 62 \n[Riley]; 10 Tr. 43 [Winecoff]. \n \n12  The total of these amounts is slightly less than the total budgeted for the existing system in 1992โ93. See CCโEx 4, \n  at 4. However, that figure included a one-time carryover of $404,661 that was used to repay short-term debt during \nthe school year. 7 Tr. 73โ74, 93, 8 Tr. 56โ58 [Riley]. \n \n13  Working with Riley and the central office staff, the United Statesโ expert witness Dr. Larry Leslie analyzed \n  expenditures projected for the two systems in a slightly different format, excluding certain (mostly federal tax and \nteacher retirement) expenditures and revenues; he also calculated that the surviving county system would bear \nabout 48% of the total costs of operating the two districts. USโEx 44, at 8, 9. \n \n14  The proceeds from this county-wide tax are subject to apportionment on the same basis as the one-mill and \n  three-mill levies. Ala.Code ยง 16โ13โ34(1)b.2. \n \n15  In 1978 Ala.Const. amend. 373, known as the โlid bill,โ became effective. The lid bill established a new maximum \n  millage for all state or local purposes based upon the โfair and reasonable market valueโ of property. Ala.Const. art. \nXI, ยง 217(i), as amended by Ala.Const. amend. 373. \nIt  also  imposed  uniform  assessment  ratios  and  required  reassessment  of  property  throughout  the  state. \nRecognizing  that  reassessment  might  result  in  unexpected  lower  revenues  for  governmental  units,  the \namendment permitted taxing authorities (acting pursuant to criteria to be established by the legislature) to adjust \nmillages within the first two years after its effective date so as to produce revenues amounting to no more than \n120% of revenues from the previous millage in the 1977โ78 tax year. Id. at 217(e). \nPursuant to this authorization, effective in 1979 in Chambers County, the previous four-mill county-wide school \ntax was raised to 6.6 mills, and the three-mill district school tax was raised to 4.1 mills. See PโEx. 29. Therefore, \nthe 4.1 mill โdistrictโ tax currently levied (and referred to extensively in the testimony) is the same as the \nthree-mill โdistrictโ tax authorized by Ala.Const. amend. 3. \n \n16  It is pursuant to this legislative authorization that the one-cent sales tax to which reference has previously been \n  made was levied in Chambers County. \n \n17  The tax district should be coextensive with the cityโs boundaries by operation of law. See Ala.Code ยง 16โ13โ193 (city \n  need not furnish new tax map). It appears from the testimony in this case, however, that district tax revenues from \nareas annexed to Lanett in recent years are not yet being paid over to Lanett. 7 Tr. 242, 8 Tr. 91, 272 [Riley]. \n \n18  The new figures would be: Valley, deficit of $86,219; county, deficit of $341,794. As previously noted, Lanett did not \n  agree that industrial park properties which it now surrounds would be excluded from its taxing district. These \nproperties are valued at approximately $9.5 million and would produce a 4.1 mill tax revenue of about $39,000. See \n30 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Chambers County Bd. of Educ., 849 F.Supp. 1474 (1994)   \n91 Ed. Law Rep. 166 \n \n7 Tr. 114โ15, 8 Tr. 238 [Riley]. \n \n19  It should be noted that Valley explicitly declined, at trial, to waive any right it may have to receive a pro rata (ADA) \n  split of district tax funds from the balance of existing District # 1โthe area within which students residing outside \nthe city limits will attend city schools. 8 Tr. 87โ89. Of the $85,991 in revenues generated by application of the 4.1 \nmill tax in this area, 56%, or $48,078 would go to Valley, and 44%, or $37,914 would go to the county system. \n \n20  These figures are subject to some additional reduction in light of the fact that pursuant to the 1993 Agreed Order, \n  the Chambers County High School facility has been closed. Utility costs at that school were particularly large. See 9 \nTr. 140 [Leslie]. \n \n21  The base against which the tax would be levied consists of the total $30,988,530 assessed valuation of current tax \n  district # 2 [Chambers County outside of Lanett and the Valley attendance area], plus the $20,973,610 assessed \nvaluation of West Point Pepperell industrial park properties except those claimed by the City of Lannett, plus 44% of \nthe $20,252,280 corrected assessed valuation of tax district # 1 outside the city limits of Valley (the total \n$29,718,480 valuation corrected by deducting the valuation of the two West Point Pepperell properties claimed by \nLannett that are currently included within District # 1), or $60,873,143. See CCโEx 19; 7 Tr. 109โ11 [Riley]. A \nthree-mill tax on that valuation yields $182,619. \n \n22  This point was reiterated by other witnesses. E.g., 11 Tr. 59 [Bryan: Lanett voters more likely to support local tax \n  measure than tax whose proceeds would be split with Chambers county system]; 9 Tr. 74, 82โ83 [Fannings]; 9 Tr. \n126โ27 [Leslie]. \n \n23  It may well be that if Leak is correct, sales taxes paid on a county-wide basis result in county area sales subsidizing \n  Valley area schools. \n \n24  It was also suggested that any financing difficulties which are anticipated in the surviving Chambers County school \n  district will be taken care of by the remedy in the โequity fundingโ suit decided in the state court system. Alabama \nCoalition for Equity, Inc., et al. v. Hunt, et al., CVโ90โ883โR, 1993 WL 204083, Circuit Court of Montgomery County, \nAlabama. It suffices to say that if and when a remedy is devised and implemented in that litigation and its effect on \nthe Chambers County school district can be gauged, the parties will be free to return to this Court to seek \nmodification of its Orders. Cf. 3โA Tr. 78 [McClain: he would not suggest that Valley postpone its efforts to establish \na separate system until the outcome of the equity funding suit is known]. \n \n25  Although the State Superintendent of Education has final, binding authority to decide disputes under state law, \n  Ala.Code ยง 16โ4โ8; 3โB Tr. 189โ90 [Teague], this court has the responsibility to ensure that federal Constitutional \nrequirements, which are supreme, are carried out. It thus would be necessary to permit a party dissatisfied with a \ndecision by Dr. Teague the opportunity to demonstrate to this court that it has a viable constitutional claim \nrequiring that the state decision be superseded. \n \n26  In Bonner v. City of Pritchard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding \n  precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit issued prior to October 1, 1981. \n \n27  The court notes that at this particular time in its history Chambers County is fortunate to have a number of leaders \n  who are sincerely dedicated to improving public education for the children of the county. Its citizens would be \ndoubly blessed if circumstances could now lead two of them, Leonard Riley and Arnold Leak, away from competition \nand toward cooperation and coordination of their talents, to the end of assuring that a school system of outstanding \n31 \n \n\n \n \nLee v. Chambers County Bd. of Educ., 849 F.Supp. 1474 (1994)   \n91 Ed. Law Rep. 166 \n \neducational quality, unitary and devoid of past constitutional violations, could at last be achieved in Chambers \nCounty and the operations and control of the schools returned to local authorities. What a legacy they would leave. \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n32 \n ",

Unfortunately, when the court compared the expenses requested \nin these two filings with what the plaintiffs represented in their April 24 submission to be the total of the February \n22, March 1, and April 3 filings, the court found some minor discrepancies.
