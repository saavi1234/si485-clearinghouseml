In light of the parties' responses to this Court's January 22, 2021, Order to Show Cause, and President Biden's Executive Order issued on February 2, 2021, which directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"promptly review and consider whether to modify, revoke, or rescind\" the expedited removal designation that is challenged in the instant matter, it is hereby ORDERED that this case is STAYED until further Order of this Court. See Save Jobs USA v. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 942 F.3d 504, 508 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (noting that the D.C. Circuit \"held the case in abeyance\" after a \"change of presidential administrations,... initially to allow the incoming administration time to consider the case and later because the Department expected to begin the process of rescinding the rule\"). It is FURTHER ORDERED that, notwithstanding this stay, the parties shall file a status report on or before April 9, 2021, which shall include a proposed schedule for further proceedings if litigation is going to be necessary.

    "summary": "<p>This case concerns the Trump Administration&rsquo;s decision to expand &ldquo;expedited removal,&rdquo; under which low-level Department of Homeland Security (&ldquo;DHS&rdquo;) immigration officers were allowed to summarily deport individuals from the United States without a court hearing or opportunity for meaningful review. The plaintiffs were a number of nonprofits, including Make the Road New York, La Union del Pueblo Entero, WeCount, the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, and a number of private plaintiffs. The ACLU helped represent the plaintiffs. The states of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, as well as Washington D.C., signed on as movants.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on August 6, 2019. The plaintiffs argued the expedited removal policy: 1) violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. &sect;553) by not complying with notice and comment rulemaking procedures; 2) violated the APA for being arbitrary and capricious; 3) violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. &sect;1225(a)) for depriving persons faced with expedited removal with minimal safeguards of due process; 4) violated the INA for restricting access to counsel for those facing expedited removal; 5) violated the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment; and 6) violated the Suspension Clause (Art. 1 &sect;9, cl. 2) by depriving subjected individuals to removal without federal court review. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the policy was unconstitutional and a violation of law, injunctive relief ordering the government to refrain from implementing the rule, and reasonable attorney fees. The same day the case was filed, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the government from applying the Notice Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal.</p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2019, Judge Jackson granted the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion for preliminary injunction and enjoined the Secretary of DHS from enforcing the policy changes in question. Judge Jackson found that the Department of Homeland Security had likely violated the APA since the decision to alter the expedited removal rule had likely resulted from arbitrary and capricious decision making&mdash;this was based on evidence provided by the plaintiffs of flaws in the pre-existing expedited scheme which the agency failed to account for. 405 F.Supp.3d 1.</p>\r\n<p>The government appealed the decision on the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals of the D.C. Circuit on October 25, 2019. The appeal was expedited after a government request. On June 23, 2020, the D.C. Circuit Court reversed the preliminary injunction, finding that while DHS&rsquo;s actions were subject to judicial review, the rule change implemented constituted agency action committed to agency discretion by law. The circuit court pointed to the language of the Designation Provision of the INA (8 U.S.C. &sect;1225(b)) as evidence of congressional intent to leave decisions regarding the scope of expedited removal within the Secretary&rsquo;s independent judgement. The relevant text read: &ldquo;Such designation shall be in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the [Secretary] and may be modified at any time.&rdquo; The court remanded the case back to the district court. The plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en banc on September 4, 2020; the D.C. Circuit Court denied this on September 22.</p>\r\n<p>Back at the district court, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on October 19, 2020. This complaint added a claim that DHS&rsquo;s policy violated the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C. &sect;113(g)). The plaintiffs filed a second motion for preliminary injunction on October 19, 2020.</p>\r\n<p>Before the district court ruled on the second motion for preliminary injunction, Joe Biden won the 2020 Presidential election. On January 20, 2021, the Biden-led DHS issued a memo indicating the department would be reviewing its rules, policies, and practices concerning immigration enforcement. Judge Jackson stayed the case on February 8, 2021, pending the Biden Administration&rsquo;s review and possible alteration of the expedited removal policy. Judge Jackson was elevated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in mid-2021 and the case was reassigned to Judge Jia M. Cobb.</p>\r\n<p>On March 21, 2022, DHS rescinded the expanded expedited removal policy. On June 3, 2022, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case, and it is now closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case concerns the Trump Administration’s decision to dramatically expand “expedited removal,” under which low-level Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) immigration officers were allowed to summarily deport individuals from the United States without a court hearing or opportunity for meaningful review. In 2019, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson granted the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction and permanently enjoined the Secretary of DHS from enforcing the policy changes in question. The D.C. Circuit Court subsequently reversed the preliminary injunction, finding that while DHS’s actions were subject to judicial review, the rule change implemented constituted agency action committed to agency discretion by law. When the Biden Administration took office, DHS issued a memo indicating the department would be reviewing its rules, policies, and practices concerning immigration enforcement. Although the issue seems resolved for the moment, the plaintiffs argue that the case is still live because the memo did not resolve the underlying issue, which DHS still contended was subject to reasonable interpretation. On March 21, 2022, DHS rescinded the expanded expedited removal policy. On June 3, 2022, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case, and it is now closed.",

See Rescission of the Notice of July 23, 2019, \nDesignating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 87 Fed. Reg. 16022 (March 21, 2022).  As explained \nbelow, the parties agree that the case should remain stayed for now to allow the parties to meet \nand confer regarding remaining issues, if any, in the case, and to propose further steps for \nresolution of this case. The parties further propose that the parties submit a status report on June \n3, 2022, 60 days from the date of this filing. \n1.  As explained in the parties’ prior submissions, several intervening events impact \nthis case. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order revoking Executive \nOrder 13768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, issued January 25, 2017. \nSee Executive Order 13993 on the Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement Policies and \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-JMC   Document 87   Filed 04/04/22   Page 2 of 5\nPriorities, 86 Fed. Reg. 7051 (Jan. 25, 2021). Executive Order 13768 directed the Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) to, among other things, prioritize the removal of certain non-citizens \ndescribed in 8 U.S.C. § 1225, the provision authorizing expedited removal of non-citizens.  \n2.  That  same  day,  the  DHS  separately  issued  a  memorandum  directing  its \n“components to conduct a review of policies and practices concerning immigration enforcement.” \nSee Review of and Interim Revision to Civil Immigration Enforcement and Removal Policies and \nPriorities,  available  at \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/21_0120_enforcement-memo_signed.pdf \n(last accessed April 6, 2021).  Among other things, this memorandum identified interim civil \nenforcement  priorities:  national  security,  border  security,  and  public  safety,  and  directed \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to issue further interim guidance. Id. at 2.  \n3.  On February 18, 2021, ICE issued that guidance. See Interim Guidance: Civil \nImmigration  Enforcement  and  Removal  Priorities,  available  at \nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2021/021821_civil-immigration-enforcement_interim-\nguidance.pdf  (last  accessed  April  6,  2021). The  guidance  applies  to  “all  civil  immigration \nenforcement and removal decisions made after the issuance of this memorandum,” including \n“when and under what circumstances to execute final orders of removal.” Id. at 3. The guidance \nprovides that only certain categories of noncitizens will be “presumed to be priorities” for \nenforcement or removal actions, including noncitizens who (1) have engaged in or  are suspected \nof engaging in terrorism or terrorism-related activities or espionage or espionage-related activities, \n(2) unlawfully entered or were not physically present in the United States on or after November 1, \n2020, or (3) have been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) or \nan offense for which an element is active participation in a criminal street gang. Id. at 4-5.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-JMC   Document 87   Filed 04/04/22   Page 3 of 5\n4.  In addition, on February 2, 2021, the President issued an Executive Order directing \nDHS to “promptly review and consider whether to modify, revoke, or rescind” the designation at \nissue in this case. Executive Order 14010, Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to \nAddress the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, \nand to Provide a Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border § \n4.b.ii, 86 Fed. Reg. 8267, 8270 (Feb. 5, 2021). The Executive Order also directed DHS to take \nreview numerous other policies impacting asylum, expedited removal, and the border, including \n“ensuring a timely and fair expedited removal process.” Id., § 4.b.i, see id, §§ 3, 4. \n5.  On September 29, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas issued further guidance, clarifying the \ncurrent Administration’s enforcement priorities with respect to noncitizens who are threats to \nnational security, public safety, or border security. See Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil \nImmigration Law 1-7, https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/guidelines-civilimmigrationlaw.pdf. \n6.  DHS completed the review of the designation at issue in this case on March 18, \n2022, and concluded in “its sole and unreviewable discretion” subject to modification at “any time” \nto rescind the designation. That decision became effective on March 21, 2022.   \n7.  In light of the foregoing, the parties respectfully submit that the case should remain \nin abeyance, to allow the parties to meet and confer in light of the Secretary’s rescission of the \ndesignation at issue in this case, and inform the Court of any next steps.  . The parties further \npropose that the parties submit a status report on June 3, 2022, 60 days from the date of this filing, \nto update the Court on the status of the designation. \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-JMC   Document 87   Filed 04/04/22   Page 4 of 5\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n    BRIAN M.

In July \n2019,  the  Secretary  decided  to  expand  the  reach  of  the \nexpedited removal process to its statutory limit, sweeping in all \nindividuals without documentation who have resided in the \nUnited States for less than two years.   \nThree organizations whose members are covered by that \nexpansion  (“Associations”)  filed  suit,  contending  that  the \nSecretary’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”),  5  U.S.C.  §§ 551  et  seq.,  the  Immigration  and \nNationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(a)–(b), 1362, the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, U.S. CONST. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 5 of 63\n5 \nAmend. V, and the Suspension Clause, U.S. CONST., Art. I, § 9, \ncl. 2.    The  district  court  granted  a  preliminary  injunction \nagainst the expansion based only on the APA claims, leaving \nthe INA and constitutional claims unaddressed. \nWe  hold  that  the  district  court  properly  exercised \njurisdiction over the Associations’ case.  But because Congress \ncommitted the judgment whether to expand expedited removal \nto the Secretary’s “sole and unreviewable discretion,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I), the Secretary’s decision is not subject \nto  review  under  the  APA’s  standards  for  agency \ndecisionmaking.  Nor is it subject to the APA’s notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking requirements.  For those reasons, we \nreverse the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction and \nremand for further proceedings consistent with this decision. \nI \nA \n1 \nCongress created the process of “expedited removal” as \npart  of  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208, \n§ 302, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-579 (1996) (codified at 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1225, 1252).  Before IIRIRA, an individual in the \nUnited  States  without  proper  documentation  could  be \nconsidered “deportable,” 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a) (1995), if, among \nother things, that person had “entered the United States without \ninspection or at any time or place other than as designated by \nthe Attorney General[,]” see id. § 1251(a)(1)(B) (1995).  A \ndetermination  of  deportability  entailed  a  hearing  before  a \nspecial inquiry officer in which the individual had the right to \nbe represented, to examine the government’s evidence, and to \npresent evidence on his or her behalf.  See id. § 1252(b) (1995).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 6 of 63\n6 \nAn officer’s determination that an individual was deportable \nwas subject to judicial review.  See id. § 1105a (1995). \nCongress adopted IIRIRA’s expedited removal scheme \nto substantially shorten and speed up the removal process.  \nExpedited removal may be applied to those “who [are] arriving \nin the United States[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), as well as \nto individuals who are not admitted or paroled and who have \n“not  affirmatively  shown”  to  the  immigration  officer’s \nsatisfaction that they have been “physically present in the \nUnited States continuously for the 2-year period immediately \nprior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility[,]” id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).  IIRIRA leaves it to the Secretary to \ndesignate which groups of individuals who fall within the two-\nyear statutory range will be subject to expedited removal, in a \nprovision we shall refer to as the “Designation Provision.”  See \nid. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) (“The Attorney General may apply \n[expedited  removal]  to  any  or  all  aliens  described  in \n[§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II)].”)  (emphasis  added).    Any  such \ndecision about the scope of expedited removal’s operation \nwithin  statutory  limits  is  expressly  committed  to  the \nSecretary’s  “sole  and  unreviewable  discretion,”  and  the \nSecretary may modify such a decision “at any time.”  Id.1  \nExpedited removal lives up to its name.  Under IIRIRA, an \nimmigration  officer  may  determine  that  an  individual  is \ninadmissible because she does not have a valid entry document \nor other suitable travel document, or because she has obtained \na  visa  through  misrepresentation.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); see also id. § 1182(a)(6)(C), (7).  If that \nindividual falls within the class of persons subject to expedited \n \n1 IIRIRA confers this authority on the Attorney General, but that \npower has since been transferred to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a); see also 6 U.S.C. § 251; Clark v. \nMartinez, 543 U.S. 371, 374 n.1 (2005).   \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 7 of 63\n7 \nremoval,  an  immigration  “officer  shall  order  the  alien \nremoved * * * without further hearing or review unless the \nalien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum * * * or \na fear of persecution.”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  Absent such an \nindication, all that stands between that individual and removal \nis a paper review by the officer’s supervisor.  See 8 C.F.R. \n§ 235.3(b)(7). \nThe process is scarcely more involved for individuals who \nassert an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A).  Those persons are referred for \nan interview with an immigration officer who decides whether \nthey  have  a  “credible  fear  of  persecution[.]”    Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B)(ii).  The interviewing officer prepares \na written record of the credible-fear determination, including \nthe  facts  relied  upon  and  the  officer’s  analysis.    See  id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II).  If the officer finds no credible fear of \npersecution, the individual’s only recourse is review by an \nimmigration judge.   See id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III).  That \nhighly expedited review is meant to conclude within 24 hours.  \nId.  The immigration judge’s review is final—no administrative \nor  judicial  review  follows.    See  id.  § 1225(b)(1)(C);  id. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii). \nBecause of the Executive Branch’s past concerns about \nexpedited  removal’s  administrability  and  accuracy  in \napplication,  the  Secretary  had  long  chosen  to  apply  those \nabrupt procedures only to narrow classes of individuals.  See \nInspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens, 62 Fed. Reg. \n10,312, 10,313 (March 6, 1997).  In particular, the government \nhas expressed concerns that the “application of the expedited \nremoval  provisions”  to  individuals  “already  in  the  United \nStates will involve more complex determinations of fact and \nwill be more difficult to manage[.]”  Id.  For that reason, the \nSecretary initially opted to apply expedited removal only to \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 8 of 63\n8 \n“arriving” individuals, defined as those “who seek[] admission \nto or transit through the United States * * * at a port-of-entry,” \nor who are “interdicted in international or United States waters \nand brought into the United States by any means[.]”  Id. at \n10,313,  10,330;  see  also  id.  at  10,313  (rejecting  one \ncommenter’s suggestion that the definition of “arriving alien” \n“be expanded to include aliens who have been present for less \nthan  24  hours”  because  of  the  “difficulty  not  only  in \nestablishing that the alien entered without inspection, but also \nin determining the exact time of the alien’s arrival”). \nIn 2002, the Secretary expanded expedited removal to all \nunadmitted individuals who arrived by sea and who had been \ncontinuously present in the United States for less than two \nyears.  See Notice Designating Aliens Subject to Expedited \nRemoval Under Section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Immigration \nand  Nationality  Act,  67  Fed.  Reg.  68,924,  68,925–68,926 \n(Nov. 13, 2002).  \nIn 2004, the Secretary again expanded expedited removal \nto include all individuals, not paroled or admitted, who were \nencountered within fourteen days of entry and within 100 air \nmiles  of  any  United  States  international  border.    See \nDesignating  Aliens  for  Expedited  Removal,  69  Fed.  Reg. \n48,877,  48,879  (Aug.  11,  2004).    With  the  exception  of \nexpedited removal’s expansion to Cuban nationals, the 2004 \ndesignation remained in place for the next fifteen years.  See \nDesignating  Aliens  for  Expedited  Removal,  84  Fed.  Reg. \n35,409 (July 23, 2019); see also Eliminating Exception to \nExpedited  Removal  Authority  for  Cuban  Nationals \nEncountered in the United States or Arriving by Sea, 82 Fed. \nReg. 4902, 4904 (Jan. 17, 2017). \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 9 of 63\n9 \n2 \nOn January 25, 2017, President Trump directed the then-\nSecretary  of  Homeland  Security  John  Kelly  to  expand \nexpedited removal to its full statutory limits.  See Exec. Order \nNo. 13,767, Border Security and Immigration Enforcement \nImprovements, 82 Fed. Reg. 8793, 8796 (Jan. 30, 2017).   \nThat directive, though, remained unimplemented for the \nnext two and a half years.  Not until July 2019 did the then-\nActing Secretary Kevin McAleenan publish an announcement \nin the Federal Register expanding expedited removal to its full \nstatutory limits so that it would reach all covered individuals \nwho had been in the United States for less than two continuous \nyears.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,413–35,414.  The Secretary cited \nas  the  basis  for  his  decision  the  “increasing  numbers”  of \nindividuals who “have been detained after being apprehended \nwithin the interior of the United States[.]”  Id. at 35,411.  The \nSecretary also emphasized how fast such expedited removals \noccur—on  average,  within  11.4  days.    Id.    Like  prior \nexpansions, the July 2019 notice—which we will refer to as the \n“Expansion Designation”—went into immediate effect.  Id. at \n35,413. \n3 \nIIRIRA also adopted a web of jurisdictional provisions \ngoverning review of both the Secretary’s designation decisions \nand of removals.  Three of them are at issue here. \nFirst,  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(a)(2)(A)  is  the  jurisdictional \nprovision that governs the expedited removal program.  It \nprovides  that  “no  court  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  review” \nmatters relating to expedited removal, including “procedures \nand  policies  adopted  by  the  [Secretary]  to  implement  the \n[expedited removal] provisions of section 1225(b)(1)[.]”  8 \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 10 of 63\n10 \nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(iv); see also id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i)–\n(iii).   \nSecond, Subsection 1252(a)(2)(A)’s bar on judicial review \nof the expedited removal process is subject to enumerated \nexceptions.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i, ii, & iv); see also \nid. § 1252(e).  As relevant here, Congress expressly provided \nthat an action may be “instituted in the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia” to review whether “any \nregulation  issued  to  implement  [Section 1225(b)]  is \nconstitutional,” and whether “a regulation, or a written policy \ndirective, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued \nby * * *  [the  Secretary]  to  implement”  Section 1225(b)  “is \notherwise in violation of law.”  Id. § 1252(e)(3)(A).  \nThird, Subsection 1252(a)(2)(B) bars judicial review of \n“any judgment regarding the granting of relief” under various \nstatutory  provisions  involving  “[d]enials  of  discretionary \nrelief,”  and  “any  other  decision  or  action  of  the * * * \nSecretary * * * the authority for which is specified under this \nsubchapter to be in the discretion of the * * * Secretary,” other \nthan a grant of asylum.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B).  That bar \non judicial review does not apply to “constitutional claims or \nquestions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an \nappropriate court of appeals[.]”  Id. § 1252(a)(2)(D).  \nB \nIn August 2019, shortly after the Secretary issued the \nExpansion  Designation,  several  organizations  filed  suit  on \nbehalf of their individual members against the Secretary, the \nAttorney General, and three other federal officials within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.  The Associations are Make \nthe  Road  New  York,  La  Union  Del  Pueblo  Entero,  and \nWeCount!.    Each  one  is  a  membership  organization  that \nadvocates on behalf of its members in immigrant communities \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 11 of 63\n11 \nand  that  includes  among  its  members  individuals  directly \ncovered by the new expedited removal designation.   \nThe  Associations  asserted  multiple  claims,  including \nstatutory claims under the APA and the INA, along with two \nconstitutional claims.  Specifically, the Associations contend \nthat  the  Secretary  violated  the  APA  by  failing  both  (i) to \nengage in reasoned decisionmaking, and (ii) to promulgate the \nExpansion  Designation  through  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.  The Associations also alleged violations of (i) the \nINA,  8  U.S.C.  §§ 1225(a)–(b),  1362,  contending  that  the \nexpansion impermissibly deprived individuals of a meaningful \npre-removal process and restricted the participation of counsel; \n(ii) the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, U.S. \nCONST. Amend. V, for failure to provide meaningful process \nprior to removal; and (iii) the Suspension Clause, U.S. CONST. \nArt. I, § 9, cl. 2, because the designation deprived individuals \nof the right to seek judicial review of a removal order.  The \nAssociations requested, among other things, a declaration that \nthe Expansion Designation was contrary to law, vacatur of the \nExpansion  Designation,  and  an  injunction  barring  its \napplication to the expanded group of individuals.  J.A. 38–39. \nBecause  the  Expansion  Designation  took  effect \nimmediately,  the  Associations  promptly  moved  for  a \npreliminary injunction.  After conducting a hearing, the district \ncourt granted a preliminary injunction, determining that the \nAssociations were likely to succeed in establishing jurisdiction \nand on the merits of their APA claims, and that the balance of \ninterests favored the Associations.  Given those rulings, the \ncourt  found  it  unnecessary  at  that  time  to  address  the \nAssociations’ INA and constitutional claims.2  \n \n2 Because the district court only addressed the APA notice-and-\ncomment  rulemaking  and  reasoned  decisionmaking  claims,  see \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 12 of 63\n12 \nRegarding jurisdiction, the district court held that it had \njurisdiction to consider the claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and \nthat  the  jurisdiction-stripping  provisions  of  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)  by  their  express  terms  do  not  apply  to \nconstitutional and statutory challenges to regulations, written \npolicy directives, and written policy guidelines issued by the \nSecretary to implement expedited removal.  See Make the \nRoad, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 28 (“[T]his court has little doubt that \n[the Associations’] APA claims assailing DHS’s July 23rd \nNotice qualify as challenges to ‘a regulation, or a written policy \ndirective, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued \nby or under the authority of the Attorney General to implement’ \nsection 1225(b).”) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii)). \nThe district court also determined that the Associations \nhad standing to litigate on behalf of their members who are \nsubject  to  the  Expansion  Designation,  pointing  to  three \ndeclarations from the Associations’ members stating that they \nwere subject to and adversely affected by the new designation.  \nThe court further found that depriving those individuals of the \nmore robust procedural protections afforded in regular removal \nproceedings was a “recognized harm[.]”  Make the Road, 405 \nF. Supp. 3d at 33.  Nor was there anything “speculative about \na  threatened  injury  if  the  one  who  makes  the  threat \n \nMake the Road New York v. McAleenan, 405 F.

See \nLiberty Property Trust v. Republic Properties Corp., 577 F.3d 335, \n341 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“Although we * * * have the discretion to \nconsider questions of law that were not passed upon by the District \nCourt, this court’s normal rule is to avoid such consideration.”) \n(formatting  modified);  see  also  Washington  Alliance  of  Tech. \nWorkers v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 892 F.3d 332, 346 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018) (similar).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 13 of 63\n13 \nsimultaneously and unequivocally states that he intends to \ninflict the threatened harm as soon as possible and without \nfurther warning” on such individuals.  Id. at 34. \nThe court next found that the APA provided a cause of \naction to challenge the Expansion Designation, even though the \ndecision was statutorily committed to the Secretary’s “sole and \nunreviewable discretion[.]”  See Make the Road, 405 F. Supp. \n3d at 39–43.  In the district court’s view, it was “more likely \nthat Congress intended to confer [on] the agency the ultimate \nauthority  to  make  the  decision  of  who  will  be  subject  to \nexpedited removal under the statute, which is not the same \nthing as giving the agency sole discretion to determine the \nmanner in which that decision will be made.”  Id. at 39.  In the \ndistrict court’s estimation, the Associations’ APA claims were \nrelated to the process and not to the substance of the Expansion \nDesignation itself.   \nMoving to the merits, the district court concluded that the \nAssociations  were  likely  to  succeed  on  their  notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking and arbitrary and capricious claims.  The \ncourt  determined  that  the  Expansion  Designation  was  a \nsubstantive rule, not a general statement of policy, and no good \ncause existed to justify the failure to proceed through notice-\nand-comment  rulemaking.    The  court  also  ruled  that  the \nExpansion  Designation  was  not  a  product  of  reasoned \ndecisionmaking because the Secretary failed to weigh “the \nconsiderable downsides of adopting a policy that, in many \nrespects, could significantly impact people’s everyday lives in \nmany substantial, tangible, and foreseeable ways.”  Make the \nRoad, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 55.  \nFinally, the district court ruled that the balance of interests \nfavored issuing a preliminary injunction.  The Associations’ \nmembers  would  be  subject  to  irreparable  harm  when  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 14 of 63\n14 \nExpansion Designation subjected them to expedited removal.  \nAnd  while  the  public  had  an  interest  in  the  efficient \nadministration of immigration laws, the public also “ha[d] a \nsignificant interest in avoiding the erroneous application of a \npolicy that can result in the swift and largely unreviewable \ndeportation * * *  of  members  of  the  public  that  have \nestablished strong ties to their communities.”  Make the Road, \n405 F. Supp. 3d at 65.  \nBased  on  those  determinations,  the  district  court \npreliminarily  enjoined  the  Secretary  from  enforcing  the \nExpansion Designation against all newly covered individuals.   \nThe Secretary filed a timely notice of appeal.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(C).  Upon the joint request of the parties, the \ndistrict  court  stayed  further  proceedings  pending  the \ndisposition  of  this  statutorily  expedited  appeal.    Id. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(D).   \nII \nThe district court exercised federal question jurisdiction \nover the APA claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  This court has \nappellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). \nWe review the issuance of a preliminary injunction for an \nabuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Atlas Air, Inc. v. International \nBhd. of Teamsters, 928 F.3d 1102, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  The \ndistrict court’s underlying legal conclusions are reviewed de \nnovo, while its factual findings are reviewed for clear error.  Id. \nIII \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, the Associations must \nestablish that (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir  APA  claims,  (2) their  members  are  likely  to  suffer \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 15 of 63\n15 \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) the \nbalance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) an injunction is \nin the public interest.  See Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  As part of establishing a likelihood \nof  success  on  the  merits,  the  Associations  must  first \ndemonstrate a likelihood of success in establishing jurisdiction.  \nSee, e.g., Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, \n913 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nWe hold that the Associations established jurisdiction for \ntheir APA claims.  But they do not have a likelihood of success \non  their  APA  notice-and-comment  and  reasoned \ndecisionmaking  claims  because  the  Secretary’s  decision  to \nexpand the scope of expedited removal within statutory limits \nis committed to agency discretion by law. \nA \nOn the question of jurisdiction, we decide this case against \nthe backdrop of “a familiar principle of statutory construction:  \nthe  presumption  favoring  judicial  review  of  administrative \naction.”  Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 140 S. Ct. 1062, 1069 \n(2020) (quoting Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 251 (2010)); \nsee id. (“Consider first” the presumption in favor of judicial \nreview.); SAS Inst., Inc. v.

See \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at 1069–1070; see also Kucana, \n558  U.S.  at  251–252  (also  applying  the  presumption  to \nSubsection 1252(a)(2)(B));  cf.  McNary  v.  Haitian  Refugee \nCtr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 496 (1991) (applying presumption to \na predecessor INA provision).   \nThat “well-settled” presumption can be overcome only by \n“clear and convincing evidence” of congressional intent to \npreclude judicial review.  See, e.g., Kucana, 558 U.S. at 252 \n(quoting Reno v. Catholic Social Servs., Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 64 \n(1993)).  \nFoundational  tenets  of  statutory  construction  likewise \napply with equal force in the jurisdictional context.  That means \nthat, when interpreting a jurisdiction-stripping provision, we \nstart with the text, and then read those words in light of the \nstatutory structure and context.  See Guerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. \nCt. at 1070–1071; see also Kucana, 558 U.S. at 245 (same); \nOral Arg. Tr. 74:15–17 (Secretary agreeing that the provisions \nare “not divorced,” and that the court must “read the entire \ncontext of the statute”). \nApplying those principles of statutory construction, we \nhold  that  IIRIRA’s  text  and  statutory  structure  expressly \npreserve the district court’s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 \nover the Associations’ APA challenges. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 18 of 63\n18 \n1 \nWhile  the  statutory  provisions  at  issue  are  complex, \nstraightforward  rules  of  statutory  construction  knit  them \ntogether and, at every turn, expressly preserve jurisdiction over \nchallenges  like  the  Associations’  claims  of  legal  or \nconstitutional  error  in  the  Secretary’s  rules  implementing \nexpedited removal. \nFirst,  the  statute’s  plain  language  says  that  there  is \njurisdiction.  In the midst of a statutory section that largely \nlimits  and  channels  judicial  relief  directly  into  the  federal \nappellate  courts  or  habeas  corpus  proceedings,  Congress \nspecifically provided in the expedited removal context for more \ntraditional judicial review of “[c]hallenges on validity of the \nsystem[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3) (formatting modified).  For \nthose  claims,  Congress  authorized  “[j]udicial  review”  by \nmeans of “an action instituted in the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia[.]”  Id. § 1252(e)(3)(A).4   \n \n4 Subsection 1252(e)(3)(A) provides in full: \n(3)  Challenges On Validity Of The System \n(A)  In general \nJudicial  review  of  determinations  under  section \n1225(b) of this title and its implementation is available in \nan action instituted in the United States District Court for \nthe  District  of  Columbia,  but  shall  be  limited  to \ndeterminations of— \n(i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to \nimplement such section, is constitutional; or \n(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy \ndirective,  written  policy  guideline,  or  written \nprocedure issued by or under the authority of the \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 19 of 63\n19 \nThat review specifically includes “determinations under \nsection 1225(b) of this title and its implementation[.]”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A) (emphasis added).  The natural meaning of the \nsingular  “its”  points  directly  to  litigation  over \nSection 1225(b)’s  implementation.    See  United  States  v. \nBarnes,  295  F.3d  1354,  1364  (D.C.  Cir.  2002).  \n“[S]ection 1225(b) of this title” is also the last antecedent to \nwhich the word “its” refers.  See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. \n20, 26 (2003) (Under the “rule of the last antecedent,” a clause \nor phrase “should ordinarily be read as modifying only the \nnoun or phrase that it immediately follows[.]”).5 \nSecond, a basic rule of statutory construction is to “[r]ead \non.”  Arkansas Game & Fish Comm’n v. United States, 568 \nU.S. 23, 36 (2012); see Local Union 1261, Dist. 22, United \nMine  Workers  v.  Federal  Mine  Safety  &  Health  Review \nComm’n, 917 F.2d 42, 45 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (“If the first rule of \nstatutory  construction  is  ‘Read,’  the  second  rule  is  ‘Read \nOn!’”).  The ensuing provisions of Subsection 1252(e)(3)(A) \nconfirm that the Subsection’s opening paragraph means what it \nsays.    Congress  enumerated  the  judicial  challenges  the \nprovision  allows,  which  include  whether  “any  regulation \nissued  to  implement  such  section[]  is  constitutional,”  and \nwhether “a regulation, or a written policy directive, written \npolicy guideline, or written procedure issued by or under the \nauthority of the [Secretary] to implement [expedited removal] \n \nAttorney General to implement such section, is not \nconsistent  with  applicable  provisions  of  this \nsubchapter or is otherwise in violation of law. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e). \n5 There is no dispute that jurisdiction under this provision \nextends as well to this court’s appellate review of a district court \ndecision.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(C)–(D).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 20 of 63\n20 \nis not consistent with applicable provisions of [the INA] or is \notherwise in violation of law.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). \nThird, earlier in Section 1252, Congress underscored its \npreservation of judicial review over legal challenges to the \nrules implementing the expedited removal system by thrice \nqualifying  its  limitations  on  judicial  review  “relating  to \nsection 1225(b)(1)”  by  emphasizing  that  review  is  barred \n“except  as  provided  in  subsection  (e)[.]”    8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)  (formatting  modified);  see  also  id. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)(i, ii, & iv). \n2 \nNotwithstanding  Subsection 1252(e)(3)’s  plain  textual \ncoverage of the types of legal and constitutional claims leveled \nby the Associations, the Secretary points back to the general \nlimitations  on  judicial  review  catalogued  in \nSubsection 1252(a)(2).  That argument does not work. \nThe  Secretary  is  correct  that  Subsection 1252(a)(2) \nidentifies three categories of “[m]atters not subject to judicial \nreview.”  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)–(C).  Those include \nmatters  relating  to  (A) expedited  removal,  (B) denials  of \ndiscretionary relief, and (C) orders against criminals (which the \nSecretary agrees is not relevant here).  Id.  Reading the statute \nas a whole, the Secretary’s argument against judicial review \nruns aground on the statutory text. \n(i)  Subsection A   \nSubsection A  is  entitled  “[r]eview  relating  to \nsection 1225(b)(1),” and so speaks specifically to and directly \ngoverns jurisdiction over challenges to the expedited removal \nscheme.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A) (formatting modified).  The \nSecretary  notes  that  Subsection A  generally  bars  judicial \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 21 of 63\n21 \nreview of (i) “any individual determination or to entertain any \nother  cause  or  claim  arising  from  or  relating  to  the \nimplementation  or  operation  of  an  order  of  [expedited] \nremoval”; (ii) “a decision by the [Secretary] to invoke the \nprovisions  of  such  section”;  (iii) “the  application  of  [the \nexpedited removal] section to individual aliens, including the \n[credible-fear  determination]”;  and  (iv) “procedures  and \npolicies adopted by the [Secretary] to implement the provisions \nof section 1225(b)(1)[.]”  Id. § 1252(a)(2)(A).6 \nThose provisions hurt rather than help the Secretary’s \nargument.  That is because, as noted earlier, romanettes (i), (ii), \n \n6 Subsection A provides in full: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory \nor nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any \nother habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 \nof such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to review— \n(i)  except  as  provided  in  subsection  (e),  any \nindividual determination or to entertain any other \ncause  or  claim  arising  from  or  relating  to  the \nimplementation or operation of an order of removal \npursuant to section 1225(b)(1) of this title, \n(ii) except as provided in subsection (e), a decision by \nthe Attorney General to invoke the provisions of such \nsection, \n(iii)  the  application  of  such  section  to  individual \naliens,  including  the  determination  made  under \nsection 1225(b)(1)(B) of this title, or \n(iv) except as provided in subsection (e), procedures \nand  policies  adopted  by  the  Attorney  General  to \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 22 of 63\n22 \nand (iv) each expressly reserve jurisdiction “as provided in \nsubsection (e)” for constitutional and legal challenges to the \nSecretary’s rules and procedures implementing the expedited \nremoval  system.    Those  provisions  textually  embrace  the \nSecretary’s decision in the Expansion Designation “to invoke” \nand “to implement” both in “procedure[] and polic[y]” the full \nreach of authority conferred by Congress in the expedited \nremoval provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(ii & iv).  So the \nstatute’s  plain  text  steers  us  right  back  to  the  grant  of \njurisdiction in Subsection 1252(e)(3) over precisely the type of \nlegal claims that the Associations press.7 \nThe Secretary resists that straightforward reading in two \nways. \nFirst,  the  Secretary  argues  that  Section 1252(e)  only \nallows the initiation of a lawsuit in district court in Washington, \nD.C. by an individual during those few short days that the \nperson is in expedited removal proceedings (which almost \ninvariably is conducted somewhere outside of Washington, \nD.C.).  The Secretary points out that Section 1252(e) is titled \n“[j]udicial  review  of  orders  under  section 1225(b)(1)[.]”  \nSecretary  Br.  22–23.    But  read  as  a  whole,  the  text  says \n \nimplement the provisions of section 1225(b)(1) of \nthis title. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A). \n7  Romanette (iii)  applies  specifically  to  a  challenge  to  the \n“application” of the expedited removal process to an “individual[.]”  \nThose individuals must funnel their challenges to their final orders \nof  removal  into  habeas  corpus  review  rather  than  through \nSection 1252(e).  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii), (e)(2).   \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 23 of 63\n23 \notherwise.8    While  romanettes (i)  and  (iii)  refer  to  claims \npressed by individuals to whom the expedited removal scheme \nis  being  “appli[ed]”  or  an  order  of  removal  is  being \n“implement[ed],” the other two romanettes for which review \nunder Subsection 1252(e)(3) is specifically authorized are not \ntextually confined to claims arising from individual removal \nactions.  Compare 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i & iii), with id. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)(ii) (covering challenges to “a decision by the \n[Secretary] to invoke the [expedited removal] provisions”), and \nid.   1252(a)(2)(A)(iv)  (encompassing  claims  related  to  the \n“procedures  and  policies  adopted  by  the  [Secretary]  to \nimplement the [expedited removal] provisions”).  So Congress \nincluded  within  Subsection 1252(e)(3)  two  categories  of \nclaims that, by their terms, are not confined to individual \nexpedited-removal proceedings, including specifically the type \nof legal challenge to the Expansion Designation rule advanced \nhere.  Id. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(i and ii). \nThe dissenting opinion echoes this argument, contending \nthat  “Section 1252(e)  simply  does  not  address \ndesignations * * * rather it explicitly preserves judicial review \nof policies only in the context of ‘determinations[.]’”  Dissent \nOp. at 15.  But that reading forsakes the text of the statute, \nwhich  expressly  permits  review  of  “determinations  under \nsection 1225(b) * * *  and  its  implementation,”  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)  (emphasis  added).    And  again  in \nSubsection 1252(a)(2)(A)(iv), the statute expressly assigns to \nSubsection 1252(e)(3)’s  jurisdiction  claims  that  exclusively \n \n8 Section headings “are tools available for the resolution of a \ndoubt about the meaning of a statute.”  Florida Dep’t of Revenue v. \nPiccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., 554 U.S. 33, 47 (2008) (quoting Porter \nv. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 528 (2002)).  But they “cannot substitute for \nthe operative text of the statute.”  Id.; see also Pennsylvania Dep’t of \nCorrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212 (1998) (“[T]he title of a \nstatute * * * cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.”).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 24 of 63\n24 \ninvolve challenges to “procedures and policies adopted by the \n[Secretary]  to  implement  [the  statute]”  divorced  from  any \nindividual determination.  Id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(iv).  \nSecond, the Secretary points to this court’s rejection of a \nchallenge  to  an  expedited-removal  rule  in  American \nImmigration  Lawyers  Association  v.  Reno,  199  F.3d  1352 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000).  That mixes apples and oranges.  American \nImmigration rejected third-party organizational standing by the \nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association itself as a basis to \nsue under Subsection 1252(e)(3).  See id. at 1354.  The case did \nnot address associational standing to prosecute a case on behalf \nof individuals directly regulated and affected by the challenged \nrule.  Id. at 1357 (explaining that the Association alleged that \nthe challenged rule violated “not their rights or the rights of \ntheir members, but the constitutional and statutory rights of \nunnamed aliens who were or might be subject to the statute and \nregulations”). \nIn fact, American Immigration specifically contemplated \nthat  litigation  could  be  brought  by  affected  individuals \nthemselves.  See 199 F.3d at 1359 (“From all we can gather, \nCongress must have contemplated that lawsuits challenging \n[actions] would be brought, if at all, by individual aliens who—\nduring the sixty-day period—were aggrieved by the statute’s \nimplementation.”). \nThat makes sense.  Whether aggrieved individuals sue on \ntheir own or band together through a representative association \ndoes not change the nature of the lawsuit as seeking to remedy \nthe individual members’ injuries arising from the Expansion \nDesignation.  That is because associational (sometimes called \n“representational”)  standing  is  derivative  and  reflective  of \nindividual standing.  See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 \n(1975) (“[A]n association may have standing solely as the \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 25 of 63\n25 \nrepresentative  of  its  members.”); see  also  American  Legal \nFound. v. FCC, 808 F.2d 84, 90 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Associations \ncan  “be  described  as  ‘but  the  medium  through  which \nindividuals * * * seek to make more effective the expression of \ntheir own views[.]’”) (quoting Telecommunications Research \n& Action Ctr. v. Allnet Commc’n Servs., Inc., 806 F.2d 1093, \n1095–1096 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).9 \nTo sum up, Subsection 1252(e)(3) expressly provides for \njurisdiction over the very type of claim that the Associations \nare bringing on behalf of their individual members.10 \n \n9 Associational standing is particularly common in situations \nlike this where proceeding as individuals would identify the plaintiffs \nto the government as targets of the very enforcement actions they \nchallenge as unlawful.  \n10 The dissenting opinion proffers a lengthy analysis of the \ndifferences  between  designations,  orders,  and  determinations, \nDissent Op. at 14–16, that not even the Secretary advanced.  The \ndissenting  opinion  contends  that  Subsection 1252(e)(3)  permits \nreview only of orders of removal and determinations, both of which \n“are directed to individual aliens[.]”  Dissent Op. at 14–15.  The plain \nstatutory text says otherwise, specifically providing for review of \nSection 1225(b)’s  “implementation,”  “regulation[s],”  “written \npolicy  directive[s],  written  policy  guideline[s],  or  written \nprocedure[s].”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(i & ii); see also H.R. REP. \nNO.  828,  104th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  219  (1996)  (explaining  that \n“procedures and policies to implement [8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)]” are \nreviewable  under  Section 1252(e),  while  “[i]ndividual \ndeterminations under [8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)] may only be reviewed \nunder new [Subsections § 1252(e)(1)–(2)]”).  That difference is \nborne out in the statutory text.  Subsection 1252(e)(2), which is titled \n“[h]abeas corpus proceedings[,]” permits “[j]udicial review of any \ndetermination under section 1225(b)(1) of this title[.]”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(2)  (formatting  modified).    By  contrast, \nSubsection 1252(e)(3) sweeps more broadly, permitting “[j]udicial \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 26 of 63\n26 \n(ii)  Subsection B \nThe Secretary next points to Subsection B of Section 1252 \nas  foreclosing  jurisdiction  over  the  Associations’  legal \nchallenges.    But  that  provision  addresses  what  Congress \nlabeled  “[d]enials  of  discretionary  relief[.]”    8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)  (formatting  modified).    The  Secretary’s \ndecision to exercise his conferred statutory powers to expand \nthe scope of expedited removal, id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I), is a \ngeneral rulemaking governing the removal procedures to be \napplied in a certain context, not a denial of discretionary relief. \nThe plain text of Subsection B bears its title out.  That \nprovision  is  divided  into  Clause (i)  and  Clause (ii),  which \nspecify the decisions not subject to judicial review.  See 8 \nU.S.C.  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i  &  ii).    Clause (i)  provides  an \nenumerated list of discretionary forms of individual relief from \nremoval or exclusion that are generally immune from judicial \nreview.    Id.  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).    Those  include  individual \nwaivers of inadmissibility that were based on certain criminal \noffenses, id. § 1182(h), or based on fraud or misrepresentation, \nid. § 1182(i); cancellation of removal, id. § 1229b; permission \nfor voluntary departure, id. § 1229c; and adjustment of status, \nid. § 1255.  See id. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); see also Kucana, 558 \nU.S.  at  247–248.    Clause (i)  makes  no  mention  of \nadministrative  decisions  generally  implementing  the \n \nreview of determinations under section 1225(b) of this title and its \nimplementation[.]”  Id. § 1252(e)(3) (emphasis added) (formatting \nmodified).    Congress  knew  how  to  limit  judicial  review  to \n“determinations” under the statute if it wished but chose not to do so \nin Section 1252(e)(3).  See Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 \n(1983)  (“[W]here  Congress  includes  particular  language  in  one \nsection of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it \nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely \nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”). \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 27 of 63\n27 \nexpedited-removal  procedure  or  anything  of  that  nature.  \n(Understandably, as that subject is already specifically and \nexhaustively covered by Subsection A.) \nThe  Secretary  relies  on  Clause (ii),  which  removes \njurisdiction over “any other decision or action of the Attorney \nGeneral or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority \nfor  which  is  specified  under  this  subchapter  to  be  in  the \ndiscretion  of  the  Attorney  General  or  the  Secretary  of \nHomeland Security[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). \nThe problem for the Secretary is that the Supreme Court \nhas instructed that Clause (ii)’s reference to “any other decision \nor action” is a “catchall provision,” the meaning of which is \n“instruct[ed]” by “[t]he [C]lause (i) enumeration.”  Kucana, \n558 U.S. at 246–247.  In Kucana, the government argued to the \nSupreme  Court  that  Clause (ii)  pertains  only  to  those \n“substantive  decisions * * *  made  by  the  Executive  in  the \nimmigration context as a matter of grace, things that involve \nwhether aliens can stay in the country or not.”  Id. \nBased on the statutory structure, the Supreme Court held \nthat those “[o]ther decisions specified by statute ‘to be in the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General,’ and therefore shielded \nfrom court oversight by § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), are of a like kind” \nas those identified in Clause (i).  Kucana, 558 U.S. at 248.  The \nCourt’s  recitation  of  the  type  of  decisions  covered  by \nClause (ii) proves the point.  The Court interpreted Clause (ii)’s \nreach as capturing decisions under “§ 1157(c)(1) (discretion to \nadmit  refugees  ‘determined  to  be  of  special  humanitarian \nconcern to the United States’); § 1181(b) (discretion to waive \nrequirement  of  documentation  for  readmission;  [and] \n§ 1182(a)(3)(D)(iii)  (discretion  to  waive,  in  certain  cases, \ninadmissibility of aliens who have affiliated with a totalitarian \nparty).”  Kucana, 558 U.S. at 248.   \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 28 of 63\n28 \nThat reading is bolstered by the reference at the end of \nClause (ii).  After specifying that those types of discretionary \ndecisions are nonreviewable, the provision explicitly carves out \nfrom  the  jurisdictional  bar  another  type  of  discretionary \nsubstantive  relief  from  removal  for  individuals—asylum \nclaims.    See  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  (excluding  “the \ngranting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title” from the \nprohibition on judicial review). \nThe  Supreme  Court  repeated  that  understanding  of \nSubsection B’s  scope  recently  in  Nasrallah  v.  Barr, \nNo. 18-1432, 2020 WL 2814299, at *8 & n.5 (U.S. June 1, \n2020).    There,  the  Court  again  described  Subsection B  as \nbarring  judicial  review  of  “challenges  to  orders  denying \ndiscretionary  relief,  including  cancellation  of  removal, \nvoluntary  departure,  adjustment  of  status,  certain \ninadmissibility  waivers,  and  other  determinations  ‘made \ndiscretionary by statute.’”  Id. at *8 (emphasis added) (quoting \nKucana,  558  U.S.  at  248).    The  Court  then  specifically \ndistinguished  the  procedures  for  “expedited  removal \nproceedings,”  which  the  Court  noted  are  governed  by \nSubsection A and Section 1252(e).  Id. at *8 n.5; see also \nKucana, 558 U.S. at 248 (stating that Subsection B applies not \nto discretionary judgments about removal procedures, but to \nindividualized discretionary judgments regarding relief from \nremoval that, if overturned on judicial review, would “direct \nthe  Executive  to  afford  the  alien  substantive  relief”  from \nremoval); Zhu v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 292, 293–294 (D.C. Cir. \n2005) (applying the ban on judicial review in Clause (ii) to the \nAttorney  General’s  decision,  in  response  to  individual \napplications,  not  to  exercise  his  discretion  to  waive  work \ncertification requirements).   \nIn short, the statutory text, confirmed by the Supreme \nCourt’s  holding  in  Kucana  and  reaffirmed  in  Nasrallah, \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 29 of 63\n29 \nfocuses  Clause (ii)’s  bar  on  individualized  forms  of \ndiscretionary relief from removal or exclusion, which is not the \ntype of generally applicable rulemaking governing removal \nprocedures undertaken by the Secretary in this case.11 \nA wider view of Section 1252 affords still more relevant \nperspective  on  the  Secretary’s  argument.    Even  where  it \napplies, Subsection B’s jurisdictional bar does not apply to \nchallenges  based  on  “constitutional  claims  or  questions  of \nlaw.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).  Instead, the statute allows \nsuch claims to be “raised upon a petition for review filed with \nan appropriate court of appeals[.]”  Id.; see also Guerrero-\nLasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at 1068–1069.12  That tells us two things. \n \n11 The dissenting opinion asserts that Kucana stands for the \nproposition that all decisions statutorily committed to the Secretary’s \ndiscretion fall within Subsection B’s ambit.  See Dissent Op. at 10–\n11.  But Kucana teaches two things—not just one.  First, decisions \nmade discretionary by regulation do not fall within Subsection B’s \njurisdictional bar.  See Kucana, 558 U.S. at 237.  Second, Clause (i) \n“is instructive in determining the meaning of [Clause] (ii)[.]”  Id. at \n247.  We draw on that second teaching in interpreting Clause (ii)’s \nreach here.  The dissenting opinion also points to the government’s \nbrief  in  Kucana,  which  identified  the  Designation  Provision  as \n“explicitly  grant[ing]  the  Attorney  General * * *  ‘discretion’  to \nmake a certain decision.”  See 558 U.S. at 247 n.14 (referring \ngenerally  to  Respondent’s  Br.  19–20  n.11,  Kucana  v.  Holder, \nNo. 08-911, 2009 WL 2028903 (July 13, 2009)).  The Designation \nProvision  certainly  does  confer  expansive  discretion  on  the \nSecretary.  But that footnote served only to distinguish statutory from \nregulatory conferrals of discretion, which is not an issue in this case.  \nKucana, 558 U.S. at 247 & n.14.   \n12 The dissenting opinion claims that we “mistakenly rel[y]” on \nSubsection D.  Dissent Op. at 17.  Not so.  As directed by the \nSupreme Court, we just look to Subsection D as part of the relevant \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 30 of 63\n30 \nFirst, whatever Subsection B’s jurisdictional bar covers, it \nis not the type of challenges to the Secretary’s regulations, \norders, policies, and directives specifically implementing the \nexpedited  removal  scheme  for  which  Section 1252(e) \nexpressly  grants  jurisdiction—and  that  are  brought  by  the \nAssociations here.  What IIRIRA does in Section 1252 is route \nthose legal and constitutional challenges to two different fora.  \nThose  involving  orders  denying  discretionary  relief  in \nindividual cases are covered by Subsection B and are routed to \nfederal courts of appeals across the United States.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(D); see also Nasrallah, 2020 WL 2814299, at *8 \nn.5 (treating separately Subsection B’s area of application and \nthe statutory provisions that govern in the expedited removal \ncontext,  including  Section 1252(e)).    And  those  challenges \npertaining to the expedited removal program must be filed in \nthe District of Columbia district court.  See id. § 1252(e)(3).13   \nSecond,  what  pervades  Subsection 1252(a)(2)  is \nCongress’s  commitment  to  preserving  the  jurisdiction  of \nfederal courts to review constitutional and legal challenges to \nthe decisions otherwise covered by its general bars on judicial \nreview.  See Guerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at 1072–1073 \n(discussing Congress’s calibration of the statute to allow for \nlegal and constitutional challenges in the wake of INS v. St. \nCyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001)).  The Secretary’s and dissenting \nopinion’s proposed interpretation of the statute, by contrast, \n \nstatutory context.  See Guerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at 1070–1071; \nsee also Kucana, 558 U.S. at 245 (same).   \n13 It is well established “that the specific governs the general.”  \nRadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, \n645 (2012) (quoting Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 384 (1992)). \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 31 of 63\n31 \nwould broadly preclude such review in the expedited removal \ncontext.  \nB \nWhile  establishing  jurisdiction  gets  the  Associations \nthrough the courthouse door, it does not keep them there.  They \nalso need a cause of action to prosecute.  That is where the \nAssociations’  APA  notice-and-comment  and  reasoned \ndecisionmaking claims founder. \n1 \nThe APA’s judicial review provisions, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–\n706, “provide ‘a limited cause of action for parties adversely \naffected by agency action.’”  Oryszak v. Sullivan, 576 F.3d 522, \n525 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, \n185 (D.C. Cir. 2006)); see also Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 \nU.S. 281, 317 n.47 (1979) (“Jurisdiction to review agency \naction under the APA is found in 28 U.S.C. § 1331.”). \nBut that cause of action is not available where, among \nother things, “agency action is committed to agency discretion \nby law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see Department of Commerce \nv. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2567 (2019); Oryszak, 576 F.3d \nat 525 (“Because the APA does not apply to agency action \ncommitted  to  agency  discretion  by  law,  a  plaintiff  who \nchallenges  such  an  action  cannot  state  a  claim  under  the \nAPA.”). \nThe  APA  exception  for  actions  committed  to  agency \ndiscretion by law is read “quite narrowly, restricting it to those \nrare circumstances where the relevant statute is drawn so that a \ncourt would have no meaningful standard against which to \njudge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Department of \nCommerce, 139 S. Ct. at 2568 (quoting Weyerhaeuser Co. v. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 32 of 63\n32 \nUnited  States  Fish  &  Wildlife  Serv.,  139  S.  Ct.  361,  370 \n(2018)). \nBut rare does not mean never.  The Designation Provision, \nwhich empowers the Secretary to decide the extent to which \nexpedited  removal  will  operate  within  statutory  bounds,  8 \nU.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I),  falls  squarely  within \nSection 701(a)(2)’s restrictive mold. \nThe  Designation  Provision  allows  the  extension  of \nexpedited  removal  procedures  “as  designated  by”  the \nSecretary”  “to  any  or  all”  individuals  who  have  not  been \nadmitted or paroled into the United States and who cannot \ndemonstrate that they have been continuously present in the \nUnited States for two years.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I); \nsee id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).  Critically, “[s]uch designation \nshall  be  in  the  sole  and  unreviewable  discretion  of  the \n[Secretary]  and  may  be  modified  at  any  time.”    Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \nThere could hardly be a more definitive expression of \ncongressional intent to leave the decision about the scope of \nexpedited removal, within statutory bounds, to the Secretary’s \nindependent  judgment.    The  “forceful  phrase  ‘sole  and \nunreviewable discretion,’” by its exceptional terms, heralds \nCongress’s judgment to commit the decision exclusively to \nagency discretion.  See Bourdon v. United States Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., 940 F.3d 537, 542 (11th Cir. 2019).  For \nexample, in Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592 (1988), the Supreme \nCourt  stressed  that  an  agency’s  power  to  terminate  an \nemployee whenever the official “shall deem such termination \nnecessary or advisable” “fairly exudes deference[.]”  Id. at 600; \nsee also Drake v. Federal Aviation Admin., 291 F.3d 59, 72 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2002)  (statute  that  permits  an  official  to  act \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 33 of 63\n33 \nwhenever she “is of the opinion” affords “virtually unbridled \ndiscretion”). \nCongress’s  addition  of  the  phrase  “and  unreviewable \ndiscretion” to “sole” doubles down on the confinement of the \njudgment to one decisionmaker, and one decisionmaker alone.  \nThe natural meaning of the statutory text is that, unless the \nSecretary crosses the statute’s bounds (which is not argued in \nthis appeal), no second opinions are allowed. \nTripling down, Congress teamed “sole and unreviewable \ndiscretion”  with  the  additional  authority  to  modify  that \nunreviewable  decision  “at  any  time.”    8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  That statutory language confines the \njudgment to the Secretary’s hands and, in so doing, inescapably \nseeks to withdraw the decision from APA review. \nOf course, a statute’s grant of “broad discretion to an \nagency  does  not  render  the  agency’s  decisions  completely \nnonreviewable under the ‘committed to agency discretion by \nlaw’  exception”  unless  the  court  also  determines  that  the \n“statutory  scheme[,]  taken  together  with  other  relevant \nmaterials,  provides  absolutely  no  guidance  as  to  how  that \ndiscretion is to be exercised.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, \n45 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam).  If no standards for judging \nthe agency action “are discernable, meaningful judicial review \nis impossible, and agency action is shielded from the scrutiny \nof the courts,” Drake, 291 F.3d at 70, “at least [as] long as the \nagency’s  action  does  not  otherwise  infringe  some \nconstitutional right or protection,” id. at 72. \nThe Designation Provision checks that box as well.  It \nprovides  no  discernible  standards  by  which  a  court  could \nevaluate the Secretary’s judgment.  In the hunt for applicable \nguidance, we consider “both the nature of the administrative \naction at issue and the language and structure of the statute that \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 34 of 63\n34 \nsupplies  the  applicable  legal  standards  for  reviewing  that \naction.”  Secretary of Labor v. Twentymile Coal Co., 456 F.3d \n151, 156 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Drake, 291 F.3d at 70). \nWith  respect  to  the  nature  of  the  agency  action,  the \nAssociations are correct that the designation is not the type of \njudgment  that,  as  a  matter  of  tradition,  is  presumptively \ncommitted to agency discretion.  Certain actions, like refusals \nto  initiate  enforcement  proceedings,  criminal  charging \ndecisions,  and  the  allocation  of  funds  from  a  lump-sum \nappropriation, have long been regarded as committed to agency \ndiscretion.  See Twentymile, 456 F.3d at 156 & n.6.  The \ndesignation decision does not fall within one of those almost-\nautomatically-unreviewable categories. \nBut that does not move the ball far in the Associations’ \nfavor.    It  means  only  that  a  “presumption  of  [APA] \nreviewability” attaches.  Sierra Club v. Jackson, 648 F.3d 848, \n856 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \nSo the question becomes whether the language or structure \nof the statute provides substantive legal standards for a court to \napply.  The Designation Provision does not.  The Provision \nstates only that the Secretary “may” apply expedited removal \n“to any or all [eligible] aliens” under the statute.  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  The individuals statutorily subject to \nexpedited removal are those “who ha[ve] not been admitted or \nparoled  into  the  United  States,  and  who  ha[ve]  not \naffirmatively  shown,  to  the  satisfaction  of  an  immigration \nofficer, that the[y] ha[ve] been physically present in the United \nStates continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to \nthe  date  of  the  determination  of  inadmissibility[.]”    Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).  The Associations do not allege that \nthe Secretary’s expansion of the designation exceeded those \nstatutory bounds. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 35 of 63\n35 \nThat is it.  Neither the statutory text nor structure provides \nany  other  legal  standards  constraining  the  Secretary’s \ndiscretionary  judgment.    The  statute  says  only  that  the \nSecretary is authorized to designate the groups that fall within \nstatutory bounds in his “sole and unreviewable discretion” and \nmay modify such designation “at any time.”  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  In looking for judicially administrable \nstandards by which to judge the Secretary’s decision, that \nlanguage is an empty vessel. \nThe Associations insist that “[t]he INA is not ‘drawn so \nthat it furnishes no meaningful standard.’”  See Associations’ \nResponse Br. 36 (quoting Department of Commerce, 139 S. Ct. \nat 2568).  But they do not back that up by identifying any such \nmeaningful standard.  Instead, they reason that “[t]he expedited \nremoval statute delineates a process by which officers decide \nwhether expedited removal applies and whether noncitizens \nshould  receive  further  proceedings  on  their  claims  for \nprotection or regarding lawful status.”  Id.  As a result, the \nAssociations claim the Secretary was “required to consider the \nability to administer these standards accurately and fairly when \napplying expedited removal to the new class of noncitizens.”  \nId. \nThat argument misses the mark.  The standards identified \nby the Associations apply to the screening process laid out in a \ndifferent  part  of  Section 1225(b).    See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i)–(ii).  The Secretary’s designation authority, \nhowever, derives from a separate statutory provision.  See id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  And Congress deliberately chose in the \nDesignation  Provision  to  commit  such  enforcement  and \nresource judgments to the Secretary’s “sole and unreviewable \ndiscretion[.]”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 36 of 63\n36 \nAt  bottom,  while  the  Associations  want  the  court  to \nsubstantively superintend the Secretary’s designation judgment \neven when the Secretary stays within statutory bounds, the \nsearch  for  governing  standards  comes  up  empty.    That \njudgment is committed to agency discretion by law and, under \nSection 701 of the APA, there is no cause of action to evaluate \nthe merits of the Secretary’s judgment under APA standards.14 \n2 \nWhile there is no APA cause of action for substantive \nreview  of  the  Secretary’s  designation,  the  Associations \nseparately argue that the Secretary was obligated to make the \ndesignation  through  the  formal  APA  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking  process.    The  Associations  are  correct  in  one \nrespect:    Even  when  a  decision  is  committed  to  agency \ndiscretion by law, and so is immune from substantive review, \nthe  agency’s  decision  may  still  be  subject  to  notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking.  See Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 195 \n(1993); see also American Med. Ass’n v. Reno, 57 F.3d 1129, \n1134 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“[W]e note that under the APA the \nultimate availability of substantive judicial review is distinct \nfrom the question of whether the basic rulemaking strictures of \nnotice and comment and reasoned explanation apply.”).  But \n \n14 Because there is no argument before us that the Secretary’s \ndesignation decision exceeded the bounds of statutory authority \ngranted by the INA and because the district court did not address the \nAssociations’ statutory claims under the INA and constitutional \nclaims in granting a preliminary injunction, see Make the Road, 405 \nF. Supp. 3d at 25 n.12, we do not address whether there would be a \ncause of action under the APA or otherwise if the Secretary expanded \nexpedited removal beyond the statute’s bounds or otherwise violated \nthe INA, or if the Secretary’s actions were unconstitutional. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 37 of 63\n37 \nhere,  the  statute  renders  the  formal  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking regime inapplicable. \nFor  starters,  a  central  purpose  of  notice-and-comment \nrulemaking is to subject agency decisionmaking to public input \nand to obligate the agency to consider and respond to the \nmaterial comments and concerns that are voiced.  See Perez v. \nMortgage Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) (“An agency \nmust consider and respond to significant comments received \nduring the period for public comment.”); see also Lilliputian \nSys., Inc. v. Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Admin., \n741 F.3d 1309, 1312 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“An agency’s failure to \nrespond to relevant and significant public comments generally \n‘demonstrates that the agency’s decision was not based on a \nconsideration of the relevant factors.’”) (quoting Thompson v. \nClark, 741 F.2d 401, 409 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).   \nBut the Designation Provision is explicit that the Secretary \nis under no duty to consider the views of others in expanding \nor contracting the scope of the designation.  That decision is in \nthe  Secretary’s  “sole”  discretion.    8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  That means that the Secretary alone \nhas the power to make the designation entirely independent of \nthe views of others. \nOn top of that, “part of the purpose of notice and comment \nrulemaking is to ensure the parties develop a record for judicial \nreview.”  American Clinical Lab., 931 F.3d at 1206; see also \nInternational Union, United Mine Workers v. Mine Safety & \nHealth  Admin.,  407  F.3d  1250,  1259  (D.C.  Cir.  2005) \n(“[Rulemaking n]otice requirements are designed * * * to give \naffected parties an opportunity to develop evidence in the \nrecord  to  support  their  objections  to  the  rule  and  thereby \nenhance the quality of judicial review.”). \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 38 of 63\n38 \nYet there is no need to create a record for judicial review \nwhere there is no cause of action for substantive judicial review \nof the designation decision.  The decision is in the Secretary’s \n“unreviewable discretion.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \nFinally,  the  Secretary  is  permitted  to  modify  the \ndesignation “at any time,” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I), \nwhich in this context necessarily means without taking the time \nto first go through the usually lengthy notice-and-comment \nrulemaking process.  The power to modify “at any time” and in \nhis “sole discretion” also means that the Secretary would be \nfree  to  ignore  the  comments  that  the  notice-and-comment \nprocess produces.  Under those circumstances, the notice-and-\ncomment procedure would be an empty, yet time-consuming, \nexercise—all form and no substance.  Where Congress leaves \nthe notice-and-comment process no work to do and expressly \nauthorizes the Executive Branch to exercise its unreviewable \ndiscretion “at any time,” the APA does not require an agency \nto undertake the process for its own sake. \nOne last point.  The dissenting opinion discusses, at length, \nwhether  the  district  court  possessed  authority  to  issue  an \ninjunction and whether nationwide injunctions are appropriate.  \nIt seems rather obvious that, having held that there is no APA \ncause of action for the Associations to pursue in this appeal, we \nneed  not  address  whether  an  injunctive  remedy  would  be \navailable if there were a cause of action.   \nOf course, to the extent the dissenting opinion implies \nsome  jurisdictionally  troublesome  lack  of  redressability, \nDissent Op. at 18, then we must dispel that concern.  Which is \neasily done.   \nSection 1252(f)  prohibits  only  injunctions  against  “the \noperation of the provisions of part IV of this subchapter” as \namended by IIRIRA.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(f).  It does not proscribe \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 39 of 63\n39 \nissuance of a declaratory judgment, which the Associations \nsought  here,  see  J.A.  38–39.    The  Supreme  Court  has \nspecifically held that Section 1252(f) does not bar declaratory \nrelief.  Nielsen v. Preap, 139 S. Ct. 954, 962 (2019).  So, like \nthe Supreme Court, we “need not resolve whether we would \nhave jurisdiction” to enter an injunction to establish Article III \nredressability because the district court “had jurisdiction to \nentertain the plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief[.]”  Id.; \nsee also Alli v. Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013 (3d Cir. 2011) \n(“[I]t  is  apparent  that  the  jurisdictional  limitations  in \n[Section 1252(f)]  do  not  encompass  declaratory  relief.”); \nRodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1119 (9th Cir. 2010) \n(holding that Section 1252(f) covers only injunctive relief); \nArevalo v. Aschroft, 344 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2003) (same).   \nIV \nWe  hold  that  the  district  court  properly  exercised \njurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e) over the Associations’ \nclaims, but that there is no cause of action under the APA to \nscrutinize the Secretary’s designation decision so long as it \nfalls within statutory and constitutional bounds.  We therefore \nreverse the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction and \nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \nSo ordered. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 40 of 63\n \nRAO, Circuit Judge, dissenting: Citing national security \nand resource allocation concerns, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity designated additional aliens for expedited removal \nfrom our borders. See 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409 (July 23, 2019) \n(“Expansion  Designation”).  Although  no  alien  has  been \nremoved under the new designation, several immigrant rights \norganizations  (“plaintiffs”)  brought  a  preenforcement \nchallenge to the Secretary’s policy. The district court granted a \nnationwide preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the \nExpansion Designation. While the majority reverses the district \ncourt’s preliminary injunction on the merits, I would dismiss \nplaintiffs’  claims  at  the  threshold.  The  Immigration  and \nNationality  Act  (“INA”)  expressly  bars  the  courts  from \nreviewing  the Secretary’s discretionary decisions regarding \nexpedited removal. One of the few checks on the independent \njudiciary comes from Congress’s ability to set the jurisdiction \nof the inferior federal courts. Because the majority exercises \njurisdiction over a claim that Congress explicitly withholds \nfrom our review, I respectfully dissent. \nI. \nAlthough  the  majority  begins  with  the  statutory \npresumption of reviewability, I begin from a different starting \npoint,  the  constitutional  power  of  Congress  to  strip  lower \nfederal  courts  of  jurisdiction  over  a  class  of  cases.  The \nConstitution vests Congress with the power “[t]o constitute \nTribunals inferior to the supreme Court,” U.S. CONST. art. I,  \n§ 8, cl. 9, a power that naturally “includes [the] lesser power to \n‘limit the jurisdiction of those Courts,’” Patchak v. Zinke, 138 \nS. Ct. 897, 906 (2018) (quoting United States v. Hudson, 11 \nU.S. (7 Cranch) 32, 33 (1812)). See also Sheldon v. Sill, 49 U.S. \n441, 449 (1850); John Harrison, The Power of Congress to \nLimit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts and the Text of Article \nIII, 64 U. Chi. L. Rev. 203, 209 (1997) (“Congress may give \n[inferior federal courts] all the jurisdiction the Constitution \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 41 of 63\n2 \npermits, or none at all, or anything in between, as far as Article \nIII is concerned.”).   \nUnder our Constitution, inferior federal courts have no \npower except that which is specifically granted by Congress. \n“[O]nly  Congress  may  determine  a  lower  federal  court’s \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.” Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, \n211 (2007) (quotation omitted); Hudson, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) at \n33 (“All … Courts created by the general Government possess \nno jurisdiction but what is given them by the power that creates \nthem.”).  In  consequence,  Congress  may  withhold  inferior \nfederal court jurisdiction “in the exact degrees and character \nwhich to Congress may seem proper for the public good.” Cary \nv. Curtis, 44 U.S. 236, 245 (1845). Indeed, “[t]o deny this \nposition would be to elevate the judicial over the legislative \nbranch of the government, and to give to the former powers \nlimited by its own discretion merely.” Id. Congress’s power to \nconfer or to withhold inferior federal court jurisdiction is a vital \nelement of the Constitution’s structure of separated and limited \npowers. See Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 907 (citing Steel Co. v. \nCitizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998)).1  \n \n1  Congress,  of  course,  cannot  “violate  other  constitutional \nprovisions” in the exercise of its control over jurisdiction. Patchak, \n138 S. Ct. at 906. Neither plaintiffs nor the majority suggest that the \nINA’s denial of jurisdiction over this non-habeas preenforcement \nchallenge would transgress a constitutional boundary. Nor could \nthey,  given  Congress’s  broad  power  over  immigration  and \nlongstanding limits on judicial review. See Jennings v. Rodriguez, \n138 S. Ct. 830, 856 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment) (“[I]n the context of deportation … \nlimits on the courts’ jurisdiction have existed for almost as long as \nfederal immigration laws, and … this Court has repeatedly affirmed \nthe constitutionality of those limits.”); see also Zadvydas v. Davis, \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 42 of 63\n3 \nCongress’s  constitutional  power  over  inferior  federal \njurisdiction means any presumption of reviewability must give \nway to “clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent \nto preclude judicial review.” Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 140 \nS. Ct. 1062, 1069 (2020) (quotation marks omitted); Kucana v. \nHolder, 558 U.S. 233, 252 (2010). Despite this fundamental \nprecept, the majority begins its analysis with the presumption \nof reviewability and then interprets each separate jurisdiction \nstripping provision in light of that presumption. Maj. Op. 15–\n17.  Yet  the  presumption,  originally  a  creature  of  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, does not operate to place a \nthumb on the scale when interpreting jurisdiction stripping \nprovisions. For example, in Kucana v. Holder, the Supreme \nCourt  looked  to  the  presumption  only  after  an  extensive \ndiscussion of the text and structure of the INA, and to dispel \n“[a]ny lingering doubt about the proper interpretation.” 558 \nU.S. at 251. And as the majority notes, the presumption applies \nonly when a statute is “reasonably susceptible to divergent \ninterpretation.” Maj. Op. 16 (quoting Guerrero-Lasprilla, 140 \nS. Ct. at 1069). The majority does not cite a single case in \nwhich a court employs the presumption at the outset to evade a \nclear jurisdiction stripping provision. Maj. Op. 15–17.2 The \n \n533 U.S. 678, 687 (2001) (noting these longstanding limits  on \nreview). \n2 The cases cited by the majority provide no support for applying the \npresumption to statutory text that explicitly strips jurisdiction. The \nmajority’s  reliance  upon  Guerrero-Lasprilla  is  particularly \nmisleading.  Maj.  Op.  15.  Interpreting  the  INA’s  jurisdictional \nprovisions, the Court first “consider[ed] the statute’s language.” \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at 1068. Only after concluding that \nnothing in the “language of the statute” stripped jurisdiction, did the \nCourt refer to the presumption. Far from considering the presumption \nat the outset or as part of its textual analysis, the Court used it “first” \nonly  in  a  series  of  rebuttals  against  the  government’s \ncounterarguments. Id. at 1069–70. See also SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 43 of 63\n4 \nSupreme Court employs the presumption in the immigration \ncontext  only  after  examining  the  text  and  structure  of  a \njurisdiction  stripping  statute  and  finding  an  ambiguity,  or \nsometimes in response to litigants’ counterarguments. See, e.g., \nMcNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 494–96 \n(1991) (analyzing first the text of the INA and only employing \nthe presumption to rebut the petitioner’s argument); see also \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at 1069 (same).  \nIn  the  non-habeas  INA  context,  this  court,  like  the \nSupreme Court, either leaves the presumption of reviewability \nas a final consideration or declines to apply it at all. See, e.g., \nNasrallah v. Barr, No. 18-1432, 2020 WL 2814299, at *8 & \nn.5 (U.S. June 1, 2020) (interpreting INA jurisdiction stripping \nprovision with no mention of the presumption); Kucana, 558 \nU.S. at 251–52 (looking to the presumption only to resolve \n“lingering doubt”); Zhu v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 292, 294 (D.C. \nCir.  2005)  (holding  that  section  1252(a)(2)(B)  stripped \njurisdiction without mentioning the presumption). Whatever \nthe merits of applying the APA’s presumption of reviewability \nto a discretionary immigration policy determination, it can be \nemployed only as a tiebreaker, a last resort in the face of \nambiguous text. Although the majority places great weight \nupon the presumption of reviewability, it has no application \n \n138 S. Ct. 1348, 1359 (2018) (applying a precedent holding that an \nadministrative no-appeal provision in the America Invents Act does \nnot preclude judicial review); NetCoalition v. SEC, 715 F.3d 342, \n348 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (noting in review of a jurisdiction stripping \nprovision, “[w]e begin, as we must, with the text of the statute” and \nwhen “[t]he language is not ambiguous … this court simply is not at \nliberty to displace, or to improve upon, the jurisdictional choices of \nCongress”) (quotation marks omitted); El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. \nUnited States, 632 F.3d 1272, 1276 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (holding that a \nstatute stripped jurisdiction because it is “not ‘reasonably susceptible \nto divergent interpretation’”) (quoting Kucana, 558 U.S. at 251).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 44 of 63\n5 \nhere, where the statute’s plain meaning is not ambiguous and \nnot  susceptible  to  divergent  interpretations.  As  discussed \nbelow,  Congress  could  hardly  have  been  clearer  in \nsystematically leaving expedited removal designations to the \nSecretary’s  discretion  and  then  removing  discretionary \ndecisions  from  judicial  review.  The  majority  ignores  a \nfundamental constitutional limit on the courts in favor of a \npresumption of recent mint and uncertain grounding.3  \nWhile courts should not shy from exercising jurisdiction \nproperly conferred, we cannot decide cases explicitly withheld \nfrom our decision. The Supreme Court has explained that we \nmust interpret jurisdiction stripping statutes to mean what they \nsay. Cheng Fan Kwok v. INS, 392 U.S. 206, 212 (1968) (“[A] \njurisdictional statute … must be construed both with precision \nand with fidelity to the terms by which Congress has expressed \nits wishes.”); Bruner v. United States, 343 U.S. 112, 116 (1952) \n(“[W]hen [the] terms [of a jurisdiction stripping statute] are \nunambiguous  we  may  not  speculate  on  probabilities  of \nintention.”) (quoting Merchants’ Ins. Co. v. Ritchie, 72 U.S. \n541, 545 (1866)). In the immigration context no less than other \nareas, “[j]udicial review provisions … are jurisdictional in \nnature and must be construed with strict fidelity to their terms.” \nStone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 405 (1995); see also Kokkonen v. \n \n3 The presumption of reviewability is rooted in the Administrative \nProcedure Act rather than the Constitution. See Abbott Labs. v. \nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967). It has since drifted into the \njurisdictional setting. See, e.g., Guerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at \n1077–78 (Thomas, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court, however, has \nlong held the presumption in favor of review must yield when it \nconflicts with Congress’s plenary power over jurisdiction and the \npolitical branches’ power over immigration. See Heikkila v. Barber, \n345 U.S. 229, 234 (1953) (noting that the APA presumption of \nreviewability  does  not  displace  Congress’s  plenary  power  over \njurisdiction and the political branches’ control over aliens).   \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 45 of 63\n6 \nGuardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) \n(federal jurisdiction “is not to be expanded by judicial decree”). \nA narrow reading of jurisdiction stripping provisions runs the \ndanger that inferior federal courts will arrogate to themselves a \npower withheld by Congress.4 With these principles in mind, I \nevaluate whether this court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ \nchallenge to the Expansion Designation. \nII. \n  In  1996,  “Congress  amended  the  INA  aggressively  to \nexpedite removal of aliens lacking a legal basis to remain in the \nUnited States.” Kucana, 558 U.S. at 249. These amendments \nto the INA established a category of aliens eligible for an \nexpedited removal process that substantially shortens the time \nbetween  the  apprehension  and  deportation  of  an  illegally \npresent alien. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. L. No. 104-208,  \n§ 302, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-579 (1996) (codified at 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225). The statutory class includes aliens who entered \nthe United States unlawfully and have been physically present \nin the country for less than a continuous two-year period. 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). Section 1225(b) entrusts the \nSecretary  of  Homeland  Security  with  the  “sole  and \nunreviewable” discretion to designate which aliens within the \n \n4 The Supreme Court has long admonished that lower courts should \nexercise only the jurisdiction conferred by Congress. Kline v. Burke \nConst. Co., 260 U.S. 226, 234 (1922) (“The Constitution simply \ngives to the inferior courts the capacity to take jurisdiction in the \nenumerated cases, but it requires an act of Congress to confer it. And \nthe jurisdiction having been conferred may, at the will of Congress, \nbe taken away in whole or in part.”) (citations omitted); cf. Turner v. \nBank of N. Am., 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 8, 10 (1799) (“[T]he fair presumption \nis … that a cause is without [an inferior federal court’s] jurisdiction, \nuntil the contrary appears.”). \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 46 of 63\n7 \nstatutory  class  will  be  subject  to  expedited  removal \nproceedings. Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). In section 1252, also \nadded  by  IIRIRA,  Congress  reinforced  the  Secretary’s \nauthority  by  stripping  the  courts  of  jurisdiction  to  review \ndiscretionary policies and various other decisions relating to \nthe  expedited  removal  provisions,  subject  only  to  limited \nexceptions. See id. §§ 1252(a)(2)(A), (B).  \nFollowing the Supreme Court’s approach in Kucana, 558 \nU.S. 233, which also interpreted section 1252’s jurisdiction \nstripping provisions, I look to the text and structure of the INA \nand conclude that Congress withdrew judicial review over \nplaintiffs’  challenge  to  the  Expansion  Designation.  First, \nsection 1252(a)(2)(B) withdraws jurisdiction to review any \ndecision committed to the Secretary’s discretion by the INA. \nSee  8  U.S.C.  §  1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  Because  the  Expansion \nDesignation  was  committed  to  the  Secretary’s  “sole  and \nunreviewable discretion,” we have no jurisdiction to review it. \nSee id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). Second, section 1252(a)(2)(A) \nprecludes challenges to the Secretary’s policies implementing \nexpedited  removal,  unless  the  challenge  is  brought  in  the \ncontext  of  an  individual  determination.  See  id.  \n§§  1252(a)(2)(A),  1252(e)(3)(A).  Because  the  Expansion \nDesignation is a policy implementing expedited removal and \nno individual determination has been made here, we have no \njurisdiction under section 1252(a)(2)(A). Finally, there is no \nlongstanding tradition of judicial review of expedited removal \ndesignations.  Contrary  to  the  majority’s  strained  reading, \nCongress  stripped  jurisdiction  from  the  federal  courts  to \nconsider  this  preenforcement  challenge  to  the  Expansion \nDesignation. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 47 of 63\n8 \nA. \nWhile the INA is complex, it unambiguously strips the \nfederal  courts  of  jurisdiction  to  review  the  Secretary’s \nExpansion  Designation.  See  Kucana,  558  U.S.  at  243–45 \n(looking first to the INA’s text). Quite simply, Congress left \nexpedited removal to the Secretary’s discretion and then barred \ndiscretionary decisions from judicial review.  \nUnder  the  INA,  expedited  removal  designations  are \ncommitted  to  the  Secretary’s  “sole  and  unreviewable \ndiscretion.”  8  U.S.C.  §  1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  Since  the \ninclusion of the expedited removal provision, the Secretary has \ndesignated various subgroups of aliens for expedited removal. \nSee Maj. Op. 7–9. The Expansion Designation under review is \na further exercise of this  discretionary authority to  extend \nexpedited  removal  to  inadmissible  aliens  within  “the  full \nremaining scope of [the Department’s] statutory authority” \nsubject to “limited exceptions.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,409.  \nSection 1252(a)(2)(B) explicitly shields a wide range of \ndiscretionary  decisions  from  judicial  review,  namely  “any \nother decision or  action of … the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity  the  authority  for  which  is  specified  under  this \nsubchapter[5] to be in the discretion of … the Secretary.” 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). The phrase “any other” “suggests a \nbroad meaning.” Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, \n218–19  (2008)  (quotation  marks  omitted).  The  term  “any \nother” is so broad the Court has found it displaces “the rule of \nejusdem generis” because such “expansive language offers no \nindication  whatever  that  Congress  intended  [a]  limiting \nconstruction” of the class of covered subjects. Harrison v. PPG \n \n5  “[T]his  subchapter”  refers  to  8  U.S.C.  §§  1151–1381.  The \nexpedited removal provision is codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1225.   \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 48 of 63\n9 \nIndus., Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 588–89 (1980). By including the \nsweeping phrase “any other,” the statute removes power to \nreview any discretionary decision assigned to the Secretary by \nthe INA. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). As the majority \nrecognizes, Maj. Op. 32–33, expedited removal designations \nare  explicitly  assigned  to  the  Secretary’s  “sole  and \nunreviewable  discretion.”  8  U.S.C.  §  1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \nReading  section  1252(a)(2)(B)  and  the  expedited  removal \nprovision  together  provides  a  clear  statutory  directive \nwithdrawing judicial review over the Secretary’s Expansion \nDesignation.  \n  Moreover,  this  interpretation  is  consistent  with  the \nSupreme Court’s analysis of section 1252(a)(2)(B). In Kucana, \nthe Court held that the term “any other decision” “barred court \nreview of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set \nout the [Secretary’s] discretionary authority in the statute.” 558 \nU.S. at 247 (interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)). The Court \ndefined  the  type  of  decisions  protected  by  this  “catchall \nprovision” to broadly include “those made discretionary by \nstatute” rather than those made discretionary by regulation. Id. \nat  246–48.  The  Expansion  Designation  unmistakeably  fits \nwithin this class because the INA, rather than a regulation, \nconfers  upon  the  Secretary  the  “sole  and  unreviewable \ndiscretion” to designate aliens for expedited removal.  \nSimilarly, in Zhu v. Gonzales, this court enforced section \n1252(a)(2)(B)’s jurisdiction stripping provision according to \nits terms. 411 F.3d at 294–95. We held it was a discretionary \ndecision  for  purposes  of  section  1252(a)(2)(B)  when  the \nAttorney  General6  used  his  authority  to  waive  certain \n \n6 The Attorney General’s INA authority over the “detention and \nremoval program” was transferred to the Secretary of Homeland \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 49 of 63\n10 \nrequirements he “deems … to be in the national interest.” Id. at \n293 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(2)(B)(i)). We first noted that \na provision need not specifically use the term “discretion” to \nbring  a  decision  within  the  jurisdictional  bar  of  section \n1252(a)(2)(B). Id. at 294–95. It was enough that the statute \nentrusted the decision to the Attorney General’s “expertise and \njudgment unfettered by any statutory standard whatsoever.” Id. \nat 295.7 Here the INA is even more explicit and places the \ndesignation of expedited removal in the “sole and unreviewable \ndiscretion”  of  the  Secretary.  The  majority’s  interpretation \ncannot be reconciled with our decision in Zhu. \nMoreover, the Court in Kucana clarified that discretionary \ndecisions such as the Expansion Designation would not be \nsubject to judicial review. The Court construed the “character \nof the decisions” insulated from judicial review by section \n1252(a)(2)(B) to include “substantive decisions … made by the \nExecutive in the immigration context as a matter of grace, \nthings that involve whether aliens can stay in the country or \nnot.”  Kucana,  558  U.S.  at  247  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted).8  The  Secretary’s  designation  authority  over \n \nSecurity under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. See 6 U.S.C.  \n§§ 251, 557.  \n7 After determining “§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes judicial review,” \nthe Zhu court explained it need not reach the government’s argument \nthat the Attorney General’s decision was “committed to agency \ndiscretion by law” under the APA. 411 F.3d at 294.  \n8 In determining that the INA included numerous “decisions falling \nwithin § 1252(a)(2)(B)’s compass,” the Court cited the respondent’s \nidentification of “over thirty provisions in the relevant subchapter of \nthe INA” that “explicitly grant the Attorney General … ‘discretion’ \nto make a certain decision.” Kucana, 558 U.S. at 247 n.14 (quoting \nBrief for Respondent 19–20 & n.11). One of the “thirty provisions” \nwas the expedited removal designation provision at issue here, 8 \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 50 of 63\n11 \nexpedited removal involves precisely this type of substantive \ndiscretionary  policy.  Kucana  therefore  undermines  the \nmajority’s interpretation of section 1252(a)(2)(B) to cover only \n“individualized forms of discretionary relief from removal or \nexclusion”  and  not  broader  policy  decisions  such  as  the \nExpansion Designation. Maj. Op. 29. The text plainly bars \njudicial review of more than individual claims because it bars \nreview  of  “any  other  decision  or  action”  of  the  Secretary  \n“regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is \nmade in removal proceedings.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B). \nThe majority also asserts that the Expansion Designation \nis not “of a like kind” as the other decisions covered by section \n1252(a)(2)(B), Maj. Op. 27, but the Court expressly defined the \n“genre” of decisions shielded from review as “those made \ndiscretionary by legislation.” Kucana, 558 U.S. at 246–47. No \nparty disputes that the text of the INA, not a regulation, entrusts \nthe  Secretary  with  discretion  over  designating  aliens  for \nexpedited  removal.  Therefore,  consistent  with  Kucana, \nplaintiffs’ challenge to the Expansion Designation is barred by \nsection 1252(a)(2)(B).  \nFinally, the majority’s reliance upon Nasrallah v. Barr, \n2020 WL 2814299, is misplaced. Maj. Op. 28, 30. The Court \nexplicitly  stated  that  its  decision  “has  no  effect”  on  the \njurisdiction stripping provisions of sections 1252(a)(2)(A) and \n(B). See Nasrallah, 2020 WL 2814299, at 8 & n.5.9     \n \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). Brief for Respondent 19–20 n.11, \nKucana v. Holder, 2009 WL 2028903 (U.S. 2009). \n9 Contrary to the majority’s assertion, Maj. Op. 28, Nasrallah did not \ninterpret section 1252(a)(2)(B) to apply only to “orders,” a reading \nthat would ignore the statute’s text, which explicitly applies to “any \nother [discretionary] decision or action.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B). \nThe Court addressed section 1252(a)(2)(B) to answer a potential \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 51 of 63\n12 \nB. \nThe  structure  and  context  of  the  INA’s  jurisdictional \nprovisions  also  confirm  that  the  Secretary’s  Expansion \nDesignation is barred from judicial review. Cf. Kucana, 558 \nU.S. at 245 (looking to statutory context in interpreting section \n1252(a)(2)(B)). Section 1252(a)(2) includes two jurisdiction \nstripping provisions that are relevant here. As I have already \nexplained, the Secretary’s Expansion Designation plainly falls \nwithin  section  1252(a)(2)(B)  because  it  is  a  discretionary \npolicy. The majority maintains, however, that the Expansion \nDesignation  fits  only  within  section  1252(a)(2)(A),  which \napplies to expedited removal decisions, and that jurisdiction is \npreserved  through  one  of  the  exceptions  found  in  section \n1252(e). Maj. Op. 18–25. Yet as the majority’s analysis proves, \nthe Expansion Designation is both a discretionary action and \nan action that pertains to expedited removal, and therefore fits \nwithin  both  sections  1252(a)(2)(A)  and  (B).  Because  both \nprovisions begin with the clause “Notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law,” 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(2)(A), (B), jurisdiction \ncan  be  ousted  by  either  provision,  but  jurisdiction  can  be \npreserved only by finding an exception to both provisions.  \nThis interpretation is directly supported by the Supreme \nCourt’s recent decision in Nasrallah, which maintains that each \nof section 1252(a)(2)’s jurisdiction stripping provisions can \nserve as an independent ground to bar jurisdiction. See 2020 \nWL 2814299, at *8 & n.5 (noting that even if a claim is not \n \n“slippery slope” argument: “If factual challenges to [Convention \nAgainst Torture] orders may be reviewed, what other orders will now \nbe subject to factual challenges in the courts of appeals?” Nasrallah, \n2020 WL 2814299, at *8. In addressing orders, the Court did not \nthereby  eliminate  section  1252(a)(2)(B)’s  application  to  other \ndiscretionary  decisions  or  actions,  such  as  the  Expansion \nDesignation.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 52 of 63\n13 \nbarred under section 1252(a)(2)(C), it can be independently \nbarred  under  sections  1252(a)(2)(A)  or  (B)).  Nasrallah \nreinforces that even if jurisdiction over the expedited removal \ndesignation is not precluded by section 1252(a)(2)(A), it is still \nindependently precluded by section 1252(a)(2)(B). \nThus,  even  assuming  the  majority  is  correct  that  an \nexception to section 1252(a)(2)(A) preserves jurisdiction over \nthe Expansion Designation, the majority fails to explain how \nsection 1252(a)(2)(B) does not bar jurisdiction, since it applies \n“notwithstanding” anything in section 1252(a)(2)(A). The best \nreading of the statute must harmonize the application of both \nof these provisions to the Secretary’s Expansion Designation, \nbecause “there can be no justification for needlessly rendering \n[these two provisions] in conflict if they can be interpreted \nharmoniously.” Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, READING \nLAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 180 (2012). The \nplain meaning of sections 1252(a)(2)(A) and (B) readily allows \nsuch  harmonization  because  both  sections  prohibit  judicial \nreview  of  the  Secretary’s  designation  policies  regarding \nexpedited removal.  \nAlthough the jurisdictional ouster in section 1252(a)(2)(B) \nis  sufficient  to  bar  judicial  review  of  plaintiffs’  claims,  it \nprovides useful context to explain how jurisdiction over the \nExpansion Designation is also barred by section 1252(a)(2)(A), \nwhich states that “no court shall have jurisdiction to review … \nexcept as provided in subsection (e), procedures and policies \nadopted by the [Secretary] to implement the provisions of \nsection  1225(b)(1).”  8  U.S.C.  §  1252(a)(2)(A)(iv).  The \nExpansion Designation is a policy adopted by the Secretary to \nimplement  the  expedited  removal  provision,  section \n1225(b)(1). Therefore, we have no jurisdiction to review the \nDesignation,  unless  an  exception  can  be  found  in  section \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 53 of 63\n14 \n1252(e). Contrary to the majority’s arguments, section 1252(e) \ndoes not save jurisdiction here.  \nSection 1252(e) covers “Judicial review of orders under \nsection  1225(b)(1).”  Id.  §  1252(e).  In  section  1225(b)(1), \nCongress created three classes of decisions: orders of removal, \ndeterminations, and designations. See id. § 1225(b)(1). Orders \nof removal and determinations are directed to individual aliens, \nwhile  designations  apply  broadly  to  “any  or  all  aliens” \ndesignated  by  the  Secretary  for  expedited  removal.  Id.  \n§  1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  Moreover,  the  power  to  enter \ndeterminations and orders of removal is placed in immigration \nofficers while designations are entrusted exclusively to the \nSecretary’s  discretion.10  Both  section  1252(a)(2)(A)  and \nsection 1252(e) treat these three types of decisions differently.  \n \n10 Section 1225(b) authorizes immigration officers to make several \n“determination[s],” all of which are made in the context of an \nindividual alien. For example, immigration officers can “determine[] \nthat an alien … is inadmissible” and can also “determine[]” whether \n“an  alien  has  a  credible  fear  of  persecution.”  8  U.S.C.  \n§§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), (b)(1)(B)(ii). Immigration officers may also \nenter “orders” of removal to an individual alien. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C.  \n§  1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(I)  (“[T]he  officer  shall  order  the  alien \nremoved.”).  Finally,  the  Secretary  is  authorized  to  make  two \n“designations”:  the  expedited  removal  designation,  id.  \n§  1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I),  and  the  designation  of  where  asylum \ninterviews will take place, id. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(i). “Designations” \nthus differ from “orders” and “determinations” in two ways. First, \nthey apply broadly rather than in the context of an individual alien. \nSecond, they are assigned to the Secretary rather than an immigration \nofficer. Contrary to the majority’s implication, Maj. Op. 25 n.10, \nwhen properly presented with a case concerning the scope of a \nstatute, judges have an obligation to read the words of that statute, \nwith or without assistance from the Executive Branch.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 54 of 63\n15 \nAs relevant here, the Expansion Designation fits within \nsection  1252(a)(2)(A)(iv),  which  precludes  review  of \n“procedures and policies” implementing expedited removal, \nexcept  as  preserved  by  section  1252(e).  Section  1252(e) \nexpressly addresses orders and determinations. It constrains \nreview of orders, id. § 1252(e)(5), and grants review of certain \naspects of determinations, id. § 1252(e)(2), (3). Yet section \n1252(e) nowhere authorizes judicial review of an expedited \nremoval “designation.” Instead, it allows courts to review a \n“written policy directive,” which arguably would include the \nExpansion  Designation,  but  clarifies  that  such  review  is \nauthorized solely in the context of individual “determinations \nunder  section  1225(b)  …  and  its  implementation.”  Id.  \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A). Thus, an expedited removal “determination” \nis a necessary condition to obtain judicial review of a policy \nregarding expedited removal.   \nSection 1252(e) simply  does not  address  designations, \nwhich are discretionary  policies of the Secretary; rather it \nexplicitly  preserves  judicial  review of policies  only  in  the \ncontext of “determinations,” a term with a specific meaning \nunder  section  1225(b).  See  supra  n.10.  Contrary  to  the \nmajority,  the  term  “its  implementation”  cannot  be  read \nexpansively to include the Secretary’s “designations,” because \nthese are a separate category of decisions regarding expedited \nremoval.11 It would be inconsistent with the text and structure \n \n11 The majority reads section 1252(e)’s authorization of challenges \nto “determinations under section 1225(b) … and its implementation” \nto  allow  for  a  preenforcement  challenge  to  designations in the \nabsence  of an  individual determination.  This  reading,  however, \nrenders  the  term  “determinations”  surplusage.  Section  1252(e) \nallows a court to overturn an individual determination only on the \nground that a written policy or procedure is contrary to law; it does \nnot allow an alien to challenge the factual or legal conclusions \nunderpinning the determination. The “determination” is thus the \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 55 of 63\n16 \nof the statute for Congress to permit preenforcement challenges \nto policies such as the Expansion Designation in a subpart that \nallows limited review only of individual determinations. \nBecause section 1252(e) does not revive jurisdiction for \npreenforcement  challenges  to  designation  policies,  the \nExpansion Designation cannot be reviewed under the plain \nmeaning of section 1252(a)(2)(A), which bars judicial review \nof policies implementing expedited removal. See  8 U.S.C.  \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)(iv).  \nThus, both sections 1252(a)(2)(A) and (B) bar judicial \nreview of this suit.12  Congress coherently and systematically \nremoved  jurisdiction  to  review  the  Secretary’s  Expansion \nDesignation in the absence of any affected individual. As this \ncourt has previously explained, the structure of section 1252 \n \nnecessary procedural vehicle to challenge policies implementing the \nINA.  If  an  alien  or  group  could  rely  on  the  phrase  “its \nimplementation”  to  bring  a  challenge  absent  an  individual \ndetermination,  the  term  “determinations  under  section  1225(b)” \nwould be  superfluous. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A);  see also  Am. \nImmigration Lawyers Ass’n (AILA) v. Reno, 199 F.3d 1352, 1359–\n60 (D.C. Cir. 2000). \n12  The  majority’s  attempt  to  use  the  general-specific  canon  of \ninterpretation, Maj. Op. 30 n.13, fails because the canon applies only \nwhen statutory provisions conflict. See READING LAW 183 (general-\nspecific canon applies only “when the attribution of no permissible \nmeaning  can  eliminate  the  conflict”).  Here  the  provisions  read \ntogether create no conflict, but instead consistently strip the courts of \njurisdiction over plaintiffs’ preenforcement suit. Moreover, it is \nhardly clear that one provision here is general and the other specific. \nCompare 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A) (addressing expedited removal), \nwith id. § 1252(a)(2)(B) (addressing discretionary decisions). The \nExpansion Designation is both an expedited removal policy and a \ndiscretionary policy, a fact the majority’s reading cannot square.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 56 of 63\n17 \ndemonstrates that “Congress meant to allow actions only by \naliens who have been subjected to the summary procedures \ncontained in § 1225(b) and its implementing regulations.” Am. \nImmigration Lawyers Ass’n (AILA) v. Reno, 199 F.3d 1352, \n1359 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  \nIn  addition,  the  majority  mistakenly  relies  on  section \n1252(a)(2)(D).13 Maj. Op. 29–30.  This section allows review \nof  certain  constitutional  and  legal  claims  “raised  upon  a \npetition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.” \n8  U.S.C.  §  1252(a)(2)(D).  But  it  has  no  applicability  to \nexpedited removal designations, which can be reviewed, if at \nall, only in an action brought in federal district court pursuant \nto the procedures set forth in section 1252(e). See 8 U.S.C.  \n§  1252(a)(2)(A).  To  the  extent  the  majority  suggests  the \nstructure  of  section  1252(a)(2)  evinces  a  commitment  to \npreserve review, the Supreme Court has reached precisely the \nopposite conclusion: “[M]any provisions of IIRIRA are aimed \nat  protecting  the  Executive’s  discretion  from  the  courts—\nindeed,  that  can  fairly  be  said  to  be  the  theme  of  the \nlegislation.” Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., \n525  U.S.  471,  486–87 (1999)  (citing,  inter  alia,  8  U.S.C.  \n§§ 1252(a)(2)(A), (B)).  \nReading on in the statute, section 1252(f) further confirms \nthat courts cannot engage in preenforcement review of the legal \n \n13 Congress added section 1252(a)(2)(D) to provide an “adequate \nsubstitute for habeas.” Guerrero-Lasprilla, 140 S. Ct. at 1071–72 \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Contrary  to  the  majority’s \nassertion, Maj. Op. 29–30, this provision tells us little about this case \nbecause “[i]mmigration law has long drawn a distinction between … \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief … and habeas relief.” Jennings, 138 \nS. Ct. at 858 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment) (citing INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 309–10 (2001)); see \nalso Heikkila, 345 U.S. at 230.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 57 of 63\n18 \nvalidity  of  an  expedited  removal  designation.  8  U.S.C.  \n§ 1252(f)(1). Section 1252(f) allows for injunctive relief only \n“with  respect  to  the  application  of  such  provisions  to  an \nindividual alien against whom proceedings under such part \nhave been initiated.” Id. Yet no individual proceedings have \nbeen  initiated  against  any  member  of  the  plaintiff \norganizations. Cf. AILA, 199 F.3d at 1359 (noting that section \n1252(f)  bolsters  the  conclusion  that  “Congress  must  have \ncontemplated that lawsuits challenging its enactment would be \nbrought, if at all, by individual aliens who … were aggrieved \nby the statute’s implementation”).  \nCongress cannot confer jurisdiction on the courts to issue \na merely advisory opinion; but that would be the consequence \nof reading section 1252(e)(3)(A) to confer jurisdiction over \nplaintiffs’  suit.  Even  if  the  court  found  the  Expansion \nDesignation to be unlawful, it is precluded from providing any \ninjunctive relief. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1); cf. AILA, 199 F.3d \nat 1359–60 (“Congress meant to allow litigation challenging \nthe new system by, and only by, aliens against whom the new \nprocedures had been applied.”).  \nThe text and structure of the INA’s jurisdiction stripping \nprovisions demonstrate that we lack the authority to review \nplaintiffs’ claims regarding the Expansion Designation. \nC. \nReading the INA’s jurisdictional bars to bar jurisdiction is \nfurther supported by the fact that there is no “longstanding \nexercise of judicial review” of expedited removal designations. \nKucana, 558 U.S. at 237. Twenty years ago, this court upheld \nthe expedited removal system generally against constitutional \nchallenge. See AILA, 199 F.3d 1352. Since that time, no court \nhas examined the merits of the Secretary’s expedited removal \ndesignations. See 82 Fed. Reg. 4,902 (Jan. 17, 2017); 69 Fed. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 58 of 63\n19 \nReg. 48,877 (Aug. 11, 2004); 67 Fed. Reg. 68,924 (Nov. 13, \n2002). Moreover, the Expansion Designation is not like the \nindividual  immigration  determinations  courts  generally \nreview. Instead, it is more like an enforcement policy, because \nthe agency must balance different factors, including ordering \nits immigration priorities, contending with limited resources, \nand fulfilling statutory requirements. Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, \n470 U.S. 821, 831–32 (1985).  \nIn the Expansion Designation, the Secretary made clear he \nwas exercising his discretion pursuant to his statutory authority \nunder the INA and “issuing the New Designation to use more \neffectively and efficiently [the agency’s] limited resources to \nfulfill its mission to enforce the immigration laws and ensure \nthe security of the Nation’s borders.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,411. \nExercises of enforcement discretion are not ordinarily subject \nto judicial review. See, e.g., Ass’n of Irritated Residents v. EPA, \n494 F.3d 1027, 1032 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“These [enforcement] \njudgments—arising from considerations of resource allocation, \nagency priorities, and costs of alternatives—are well within the \nagency’s expertise and discretion.”); Brock v. Cathedral Bluffs \nShale Oil Co., 796 F.2d 533, 538 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Scalia, J.) \n(“[T]he statement here in question pertains to an agency’s \nexercise of its enforcement discretion—an area in which the \ncourts have traditionally been most reluctant to interfere.”).  \nThe INA leaves expedited removal designations to the \n“sole and unreviewable discretion” of the Secretary and he may \nmodify them “at any time.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \nCongress  clearly  placed  designations  within  the  class  of \ndiscretionary enforcement policies not traditionally subject to \njudicial review. Cf. Kucana, 558 U.S. at 237. Such an explicit \nconferral of discretion “reflects a congressional recognition” \nthat  the  Secretary  “can  make  necessary  adjustments  for \nunforeseen developments and changing requirements” without \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 59 of 63\n20 \njudicial interference. Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 (1993) \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  This  historical  lack  of \njudicial review reinforces the plain meaning of the text and \nstructure of the INA to preclude review of the Secretary’s \nExpansion Designation. See Kucana, 558 U.S. at 251–52.   \n*** \nThe  majority  concludes  that  plaintiffs’  claims  are  not \nbarred and are properly reviewed under (apparently) either \ngeneral federal question jurisdiction or jurisdiction conferred \ndirectly by the INA. Maj. Op. 18 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1331), 39 \n(citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)). Yet the INA strips jurisdiction over \ndiscretionary  decisions  as  well  as  policies  to  implement \nexpedited removal absent an individual “determination.” These \nprovisions  separately  and  independently  preclude  judicial \nreview  of  the  Expansion  Designation  and  apply \n“notwithstanding any other provision of law.” See 8 U.S.C.  \n§§ 1252(a)(2)(A), (B). This means the INA’s jurisdictional \nousters  apply  notwithstanding  general  federal  question \njurisdiction under section 1331. See Patchak, 138 S. Ct. at 905. \nIn sum, neither the INA nor section 1331 allow us to exercise \njurisdiction over plaintiffs’ suit. \n III. \n  Even on the majority’s view that the district court had \njurisdiction  over  plaintiffs’  suit,  the  INA  categorically \nprohibits  injunctive  relief  absent  proceedings  against  an \nindividual alien. The anti-injunction provision states in full: \nRegardless of the nature of the action or claim \nor of the identity of the party or parties bringing \nthe action, no court (other than the Supreme \nCourt) shall have jurisdiction or authority to \nenjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 60 of 63\n21 \nof part IV of this subchapter,[14] as amended by \nthe [IIRIRA], other than with respect to the \napplication of such provisions to an individual \nalien against whom proceedings under such part \nhave been initiated. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). This provision speaks in the broadest \npossible  terms  and  unambiguously  prohibits  the \npreenforcement injunction the district court entered here.  \nThe expedited removal provision allows the Secretary in \nhis “sole and unreviewable discretion” to designate classes of \naliens up to the statutory maximum for expedited removal “at \nany  time.”  Id.  §  1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  The  Secretary  is \nentrusted with carrying this provision into operation. See id. By \nenjoining the Secretary’s Expansion Designation, the district \ncourt “enjoin[ed] … the operation” of the expedited removal \nprovision. See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 431–32 (2009) \n(noting  the  anti-injunction  provision  demonstrates \ncongressional  “concern[]  about  the  possibility  that  courts \nwould enjoin application of particular provisions of the INA”). \nThe anti-injunction provision carves out a single exception \nfor “the application of such provisions to an individual alien \nagainst  whom  proceedings  under  such  part  have  been \ninitiated.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). Here, the exception has not \nbeen triggered because expedited removal proceedings have \nnot  “been  initiated”  against  any  member  of  the  plaintiff \norganizations, nor indeed, against any individual. Thus, no \ncourt “other than the Supreme Court” has jurisdiction to enjoin \nthe operation of the Expansion Designation. Id.; see American-\nArab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. at 481–82 (the \n \n14 “[P]art IV of this subchapter” refers to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1221–1231. \nThe expedited removal provision is codified as 8 U.S.C. § 1225.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 61 of 63\n22 \nanti-injunction provision “is nothing more or less than a limit \non injunctive relief”); Padilla v. ICE, 953 F.3d 1134, 1150 (9th \nCir. 2020) (“Congress intended [the anti-injunction provision] \nto  prohibit  injunctive  relief  with  respect  to  organizational \nplaintiffs.”). The anti-injunction provision thus runs in parallel \nto the jurisdiction stripping provisions, which allow judicial \nreview  only  in  the  context  of  concrete  individual \n“determinations.” See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(2)(A), 1252(e)(3).  \nThe  district  court  reached  an  opposite  conclusion  by \nrelying on a dubious distinction between enjoining the statute \nand  enjoining  the  Secretary  from  carrying  the  statute  into \noperation. See Make the Rd. New York v. McAleenan, 405 F. \nSupp.  3d  1,  68  n.37  (D.D.C.  2019).  If  the  anti-injunction \nprovision applies only to injunctions restraining the statutory \ntext, it is a nullity, indeed an absurdity, because injunctions run \nagainst  an  officer,  not  statutory  text.  The  anti-injunction \nprovision prohibits injunctions restraining “the operation of the \nprovisions of part IV of this subchapter.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). \nOf course the Expansion Designation is not part of the statute; \nhowever,  designations  are  the  mechanism  by  which  the \nSecretary  carries  his  expedited  removal  authority  into \n“operation.”  By  enjoining  the  Secretary  from  issuing  the \nExpansion  Designation,  the  district  court  “enjoin[ed]  or \nrestrain[ed]  the  operation  of”  the  expedited  removal \ndesignation provision in violation of the INA.15 The district \n \n15 The Sixth Circuit rejected a similar argument that “the district \ncourt was not enjoining or restraining the statutes” under section \n1252(f)(1) as “implausible on its face” because “[t]he district court \n… created out of thin air a requirement … that does not exist in the \nstatute; and adopted standards that the government must meet.” \nHamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 879–80 (6th Cir. 2018). So too \nhere. “If these limitations on what the government can and cannot do \nunder the … provision are not ‘restraints,’ it is not at all clear what \nwould qualify as a restraint” under section 1252(f). Id. \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 62 of 63\n23 \ncourt thus not only lacked jurisdiction over the case, it also \nlacked jurisdiction to enter this injunctive remedy.16  \n* * * \nAlthough I generally agree with the majority’s conclusion \nthat the expedited removal designation is committed to agency \ndiscretion  by  law,  we  have  an  antecedent  duty  to  ensure \njurisdiction.  Here,  the  INA  unambiguously  withholds \njurisdiction  over  plaintiffs’  suit  to  enjoin  the  Expansion \nDesignation. Courts must respect limits on their jurisdiction, \nparticularly in areas such as immigration that implicate power \ntraditionally wielded by the political branches. See Fiallo v. \nBell, 430 U.S. 787, 792 (1977) (“[T]he power to expel or \nexclude aliens [is] a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised \nby the Government’s political departments largely immune \nfrom judicial control.”) (quotation marks omitted); Heikkila, \n345 U.S. at 233–34 (noting the “peculiarly political nature of \nthe legislative power over aliens”). Decisions of the Supreme \nCourt  and  this  circuit  have  consistently  read  the  INA’s \njurisdiction stripping provisions to mean what they say.  \n \n16  The  district  court’s  entry  of  nationwide  relief is  particularly \negregious in light of the INA’s anti-injunction provision, which \nexplicitly limits relief to an alien “against whom proceedings … have \nbeen  initiated.”  8  U.S.C.  §  1252(f)(1).  While  the  legality  of \nnationwide injunctions is in doubt under both the Constitution and \nfederal statutes, see Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424–29 \n(2018) (Thomas, J., concurring), it is especially problematic here \ngiven the INA’s unambiguous foreclosure of any injunctive relief \noutside a proceeding against an individual alien. Rather than limiting \nrelief to individual affected aliens, as required by the statute, the \ndistrict court upended the Secretary’s discretion through a “cosmic” \ninjunction extending across the land. DHS v. New York, 140 S. Ct. \n599, 600 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the grant of stay).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #19-5298      Document #1848499            Filed: 06/23/2020      Page 63 of 63\n24 \nIn light of these precedents, the majority manages to “knit” \ntogether an argument to preserve jurisdiction only by glossing \nover  the  plain  meaning  of  the  INA  and  relying  on  the \npresumption of judicial review. Maj.  Op. 18.  Yet because \nCongress possesses plenary authority over the jurisdiction of \nthe lower federal courts, the presumption of reviewability must \nyield to a clear statement removing jurisdiction. “[W]hat the \nCongress gives, the Congress may take away.” Knapp Medical \nCenter v. Hargan, 875 F.3d 1125, 1128 (D.C. Cir. 2017). With \nrespect to expedited removal, Congress was crystal clear in \nconferring  designations  to  the  Secretary’s  discretion  and \nbarring  our  review  over  preenforcement  challenges.  By \ndisregarding the INA’s multi-layered jurisdictional bar, the \nmajority  encroaches  upon  Congress’s  plenary  power  over \njurisdiction and upon the political branches’ authority over \nimmigration. We witness yet another marker on the road to \ngovernment by injunction. I respectfully dissent. \n ",

INTRODUCTION \nAdministrative agencies have long been required by law to adhere to certain \nprocedural standards when they evaluate options and assess alternatives with respect to \nthe implementation of policy objectives.  See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c) (requiring \nagencies to provide notice and solicit public participation as part of agency rulemaking, \ncommonly known as “notice and comment”).  This is by design; statutory requirements \nthat pertain to how an agency conducts its internal deliberations are intended to promote \ntransparency and to prevent arbitrary decision making by unelected government \nofficials.  See Batterton v. Marshall, 648 F.2d 694, 703 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (“The essential \npurpose of according . . . notice and comment opportunities is to reintroduce public \nparticipation and fairness to affected parties after governmental authority has been \ndelegated to unrepresentative agencies.” (footnote omitted)); see also Wong Yang Sun v. \nMcGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 40–41 (1950), superseded by statute on other grounds \n(explaining that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., was enacted \nto supplant unregulated rule making by independent commissions, and that one of the \nAct’s “fundamental . . . purpose[s]” was “to curtail and change the practice of \nembodying in one person or agency the duties of prosecutor and judge”).  Thus, even \nwhen an agency has the authority to make a final policy decision, procedural mandates \nthat constrain its decision making processes operate as safeguards of individual liberty, \nand therefore, are entirely consistent with foundational democratic and constitutional \nnorms.   \nThe instant case requires this Court to determine whether, inter alia, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) unlawfully dispensed with core procedural \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 4 of 126\nprerequisites when it suddenly announced that the agency was designating \nundocumented non-citizens who have been in this country for up to two years, and who \nare located far beyond the border, as eligible for “expedited removal” from the United \nStates.  Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409, 35,409 (July \n23, 2019).1  Generally speaking, expedited removal is the statutory authorization that \nenables federal immigration officers to slate certain undocumented non-citizens for \nrapid deportation “without further hearing or review[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).   \nPrior to July 23, 2019, DHS had authorized expedited removal with respect to \nundocumented non-citizens who arrived in the United States by land only if such \npersons were encountered near the border and had been in the country for no longer \nthan 14 days.  See 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,409.  In a “Notice” that DHS published in the \nFederal Register on July 23, 2019 (more than two and half years after President Donald \nTrump issued an executive order that demanded that DHS expand its established \nexpedited removal practices), the agency instantly authorized line immigration-\nenforcement agents to apply expedited removal to non-citizens encountered anywhere in \nthe United States for up to two years after the non-citizen arrived in the United States, \neffective immediately.  See id.  This abrupt change in the official policies that govern \nDHS’s deportation practices is the subject of the legal claims that have been presented \nto the Court in this case. \nThree immigrant-rights organizations—Make the Road New York, La Union Del \nPueblo Entero (“LUPE”), and WeCount! (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)—have filed the \n \n1 The Court uses the term “undocumented non-citizens” throughout this Memorandum Opinion to refer \nto persons born abroad—the federal immigration statutes call them “aliens”—who are deemed \n“inadmissible” under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) because they have not received \nauthorization to come into, or remain, in the United States. \n2\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 5 of 126\ninstant lawsuit against DHS, its Secretary, and other agency officials (collectively, \n“DHS” or “Defendants”).  Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that DHS’s July 23rd \nNotice violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), because the agency did not \nengage in notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to issuing the July 23rd Notice, and \nalso because DHS failed to take the established flaws in the preexisting expedited \nremoval system into account before it reached the conclusion that the expedited \nremoval process should be applied to a broader category of non-citizens.  (See Compl., \nECF No. 1, ¶¶ 129–34, 149–51.)2\nBefore this Court at present is a motion for a preliminary injunction that \nPlaintiffs have filed “to prevent severe and irreparable harm” to their members while \nthe parties litigate the myriad legal issues that this legal action raises.  (Pls.’ Mot. for a \nPrelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Mot.”), ECF No. 13, at 2.)3  The array of legal issues that this Court \nmust ultimately decide includes whether the APA even applies to the expedited-removal \ndesignations that the DHS Secretary makes under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I), and \nthe parties have made various arguments that, at bottom, relate to that key question.  As \na threshold matter, Plaintiffs contend that this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over \ntheir APA challenges under the circumstances that are expressly addressed in the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and that at least \n \n2 Plaintiffs also assert that, under the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the July 23rd Notice \nprovides insufficient process to people who are apprehended in the interior of the United States (far \nfrom the border), and who have lived continuously in this country for extended periods of time.  (See, \ne.g., Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for a Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 13-1, at 48–49.)  This Court need not \nevaluate the merits of Plaintiffs’ Due Process claim, or their similar Suspension Clause accusation, for \nthe reasons explained in this Memorandum Opinion (see infra, n.12), and it has not done so. \n \n3 Page-number citations to the documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the \nCourt’s electronic filing system automatically assigns.   \n3\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 6 of 126\nseven of their members have Article III standing to pursue the instant APA claims.  \nPlaintiffs also assert that they have a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims \nthat DHS has violated the APA, and that without a preliminary injunction to prevent \nenforcement of the policy change announced in the July 23rd Notice, their members \nwill suffer irreparable harm.  Defendants respond that this Court cannot review \nPlaintiffs’ claims consistent with its power under Article III, either because Congress \nintended to preclude the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction over the Secretary’s \nexpedited removal designations or because Plaintiffs lack standing and a cause of action \nto bring these kinds of claims.  Defendants also maintain that Plaintiffs are unlikely to \nsucceed on the merits of their contention that the July 23rd Notice was procedurally \ndefective or otherwise violates the law.  \nFor the reasons explained fully below, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction will be GRANTED, and as a result, DHS will be PRELIMINARILY \nENJOINED from enforcing the expedited removal expansion that the Acting DHS \nSecretary prescribed in the July 23rd Notice while the instant claims are being litigated, \npending further order of this Court.  In short, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to \nbe able to establish successfully that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under \nsection 1331 of Title 28 of the United States Code; that the INA’s section 242 (8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252) does not strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over APA claims like the ones \nthat Plaintiffs are asserting; that the APA, rather than the INA, provides the cause of \naction for Plaintiffs’ procedural claims; and that Congress did not intend to commit \nimplementation of the expedited removal process it authorized entirely to agency \ndiscretion such that the APA cause of action is precluded.  In addition, given Plaintiffs’ \n4\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 7 of 126\nidentification of members who attest to being subject to the challenged policy, these \nPlaintiff-organizations are also likely to be able to demonstrate that they have \nassociational standing, and the Court further finds, at least preliminarily, that the effect \nof the July 23rd Notice is likely sufficiently binding to qualify as a rule to which the \nAPA’s notice-and-comment procedures apply.   \nPlaintiffs are also likely to succeed on the merits of their contention that the July \n23rd Notice is arbitrary and capricious, and therefore unlawful, because DHS did not\naddress significant flaws in the expedited removal system, nor does it appear that the \nagency considered the potential impact of the expansion of that system on settled \nundocumented non-citizens and their communities.  Unlike private citizens, government \nofficials are required by law to engage in reasoned decision making that takes into \naccount all of the facts and circumstances that are relevant to their consequential policy \ndeterminations.  Based on the record presented here, the Court finds it likely that, with \nrespect to the July 23rd Notice, DHS failed to do so.  \nThe Court also concludes that a preliminary injunction is warranted while this \nlawsuit is pending, because Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they have members who \nare subject to the expanded expedited removal policy, and that those members, and \nothers, might suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.  The \nrecord also supports a finding that the fear caused by DHS’s current threat to commence \nenforcement of its expanded expedited removal policy may be presently harming \nPlaintiffs’ members and others in immigrant communities. Moreover, given the \npotential for mistaken application of the expedited removal practice to persons who are \nnot otherwise subject to deportation, which has serious implications for society writ \n5\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 8 of 126\nlarge, the Court finds that interim injunctive relief is in the public’s interest, while, on \nthe other hand, it is unlikely that the issuance of such an injunction would harm DHS or \nthe public to such an extent that that injury would outweigh the benefits of preserving \nthe status quo while this matter is under review. \nFinally, in ordering the preliminary relief that Plaintiffs have requested, this \nCourt squarely rejects DHS’s argument that any injunctive relief that is issued in this \ncase, whether preliminary or permanent, can only prohibit application of the agency’s \nunlawful rule as it applies to these plaintiffs.  (See Defs.’ Mem. in Opp’n to the Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), ECF No. 25, at 75–76.)  This contention is not only \nflatly inconsistent with the plain language of the APA, it is also entirely impractical \nwhen invoked in the realm of judicial review of administrative action.  The APA states \nin no uncertain terms that, to remedy defective rulemaking after a plaintiff successfully \nchallenges the process that an agency has used to promulgate a rule, the reviewing court \nmust “hold unlawful and set aside” the challenged agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), \nand that is precisely what this Court’s injunction does, as a preliminary matter, pending \nfull litigation of the issues in this case.  This statutorily prescribed remedy has nothing \nto do with the standing or status of the plaintiff-challengers.  Nor is there anything \n“nationwide” about the resulting prohibition (Defs.’ Opp’n at 75); indeed, such an \ninjunction pertains only to an agency’s act of enacting the defective rule; it is addressed \nonly to the agency that has failed to adhere to the required rulemaking procedures; and \nit binds only that particular entity with respect to the rule in question.  Thus, the \ninjunctive relief that the APA plainly prescribes is a targeted restriction that, by statute, \n6\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 9 of 126\nessentially treats an unlawfully promulgated agency rule as void ab initio due to the \nagency’s failure to adhere to the APA’s procedural mandates.  \nApparently unwilling to accept that required result, the government has conjured \nup a strawman by insisting that, even when a plaintiff successfully establishes that an \nagency’s rulemaking is fatally flawed, federal district courts must avoid enjoining an \nagency rule on a “nationwide” basis.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 75.)  As explained below, \ninjunctions that invalidate procedurally deficient agency rules on APA grounds, and \nthereby prohibit an agency from enforcing those rules, do no such thing.  If this Court’s \nOrder preliminarily prohibiting DHS from enforcing the expedited removal policy the \nagency announced in the July 23rd Notice reverberates nationally, that is simply and \nsolely because DHS previously decided to apply its potentially defective rule \nnationwide.   \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Immigration And Nationality Act’s Expedited Removal Provision \n“The Immigration and Nationality Act sets forth the conditions under which a \nforeign national may be admitted to and remain in the United States and grants the \nDepartment of Homeland Security the discretion to initiate removal proceedings.”  \nR.I.L.-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 171 (D.D.C. 2015) (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1181–\n82, 1184, 1225, 1227–29, 1306, 1324–25).  With respect to the removal of unauthorized \nnon-citizens, the INA, which was enacted in 1952, has always generally provided that \n“[a]n immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or \ndeportability of an alien[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(1), and in the context of such \nproceedings before an immigration judge, the INA makes clear that non-citizens are to \n7\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 10 of 126\nbe afforded certain rights, including the right to counsel, to examine and cross-examine \nwitnesses, to present evidence, and to appeal, see id. § 1229a(b).  However, 44 years \nafter the INA was enacted, Congress undertook an extensive border-security reform \neffort that ultimately resulted in its adoption of a piece of legislation known as the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (“IIRIRA”), Pub. \nL. No. 104-208, Div. C., Title I, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (1996), which authorized an \nalternative, truncated process for the removal of certain non-citizens.  \nTo understand the IIRIRA’s impact, it is helpful to have a sense of what \npreceded it.  “Before IIRIRA’s passage, United States immigration law established ‘two \ntypes of proceedings in which aliens can be denied the hospitality of the United States: \ndeportation hearings and exclusion hearings.’”  Vartelas v. Holder, 566 U.S. 257, 261 \n(2012) (quoting Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. 21, 25 (1982)).  “The deportation \nhearing [was] the usual means of proceeding against an alien already physically in the \nUnited States, and the exclusion hearing [was] the usual means of proceeding against an \nalien outside the United States seeking admission.”  Landon, 459 U.S. at 25.  \nDeportation hearings provided more procedural safeguards than exclusion hearings did, \nsuch as notice, the right to appeal, and the right to designate the country of deportation.  \nSee id. at 26.  However, “[i]n IIRIRA, Congress abolished the distinction between \nexclusion and deportation procedures and created a uniform proceeding known as \n‘removal.’”  Vartelas, 566 U.S. at 262 (citing 8 U.S.C. §§ 1229, 1229a; Judulang v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 42, 45–46 (2011)).  \nThe impetus for this statutory change was, apparently, Congress’s determination \nthat “[e]xisting procedures to deny entry to and to remove illegal aliens from the United \n8\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 11 of 126\nStates [were] cumbersome and duplicative[.]”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, at 107 (1996).  \nThus, Congress reformed those procedures in the IIRIRA, and created a removal \nprocess that contained procedural options that varied based on the undocumented non-\ncitizen’s arrival status.  The House Committee on the Judiciary explained at the time of \nthe IIRIRA’s enactment that “[a]liens who arrive in the United States with no valid \ndocuments will be removed on an expedited basis[,]” except for those “with credible \nasylum claims[,]” who would be allowed to pursue those claims, and “[f]or illegal \naliens already present in the U.S., there will be a single form of removal proceeding, \nwith a streamlined appeal and removal process.”  Id. at 107–08; see also O.A. v. Trump, \nCiv. No. 18-2718, 2019 WL 3536334, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 2, 2019) (noting that, \n“[a]mong other changes, IIRIRA established two types of removal proceedings”).   \nAs relevant here, the IIRIRA explicitly designates certain non-citizens as \npotentially subject to the fast-track, near-immediate ejection removal procedure that is \ncommonly referred to as “expedited removal.”  Specifically, Congress amended section \n235 of the INA (presently codified as 8 U.S.C. § 1225) to address “Inspections of aliens \narriving in the United States and certain other aliens who have not been admitted or \nparoled[,]” and to provide for the “[s]creening” of such individuals, as follows:  \n(i)  In general \n \nIf an immigration officer determines that an alien . . . who is \narriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is \ninadmissible . . . , the officer shall order the alien removed \nfrom  the  United  States  without  further  hearing  or  review \nunless  the  alien  indicates  either  an  intention  to  apply  for \nasylum . . . or a fear of persecution. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).4  Thus, under the IIRIRA’s expedited removal process, “an \n \n4 The inadmissibility determination under this provision is governed by Title 8, sections 1182(a)(6)(C) \n9\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 12 of 126\narriving alien can be denied entry into the U.S. by an immigration officer because of \nmisrepresentation, use of fraudulent documents, or lack of any documents[,]” and “[t]he \nalien may be ordered removed without a hearing before an immigration judge, and \nwithout administrative or judicial review.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, at 157.  \nNotably, under federal immigration statutes and their accompanying regulations \nas they currently exist, there is a substantial difference between being permitted to \nengage in regular removal proceedings and being subjected to expedited removal.  \n“Regular, or ‘formal,’ removal proceedings allow aliens to challenge their removal in \nadministrative proceedings with various procedural guarantees, including the rights to \nwritten notice of the charge of removability, to counsel, to appear at a hearing before an \nimmigration judge and to present evidence, to appeal an adverse decision to the Board \nof Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’), and to seek judicial review.”  O.A., 2019 WL \n3536334, at *3; see also id. (explaining, further, that “[a]n alien placed in formal \nremoval proceedings may avoid removal by establishing, through the adversarial \nprocess, that she is eligible for asylum, withholding of deportation, or some other form \nof relief”).  By contrast, the Code of Federal Regulations makes clear that, for \nexpedited removal, an immigration officer need only question and record the non-\ncitizen’s statement concerning her “identity, alienage, and inadmissibility,” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 235.3(b)(2)(i), and allow the non-citizen to present evidence that she has been \nadmitted or paroled, see id. § 235.3(b)(6), before ordering the non-citizen removed.  \n \nand 1182(a)(7).  The former makes inadmissible “[a]ny alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting \na material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, \nor admission into the United States[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), while the latter makes inadmissible \nany immigrant who does not have “a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing \nidentification card, or other valid entry document . . . and a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable \ntravel document or document of identity and nationality[,]” id. § 1182(a)(7).   \n10 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 13 of 126\nThe immigration officer “will attempt to verify the alien’s status through a check of all \navailable Service data systems”; however, “[t]he burden rests with the alien to satisfy \nthe examining immigration officer of the claim of lawful admission or parole.”  Id.5\nThe regulations do require that “[i]nterpretative assistance . . . be used if \nnecessary to communicate with the alien,” id. § 235.3(b)(2)(i), and if the non-citizen \n“indicates an intention to apply for asylum, or expresses a fear of persecution or torture, \nor a fear of return to his or her country, the inspecting officer shall not proceed further \nwith removal of the alien until the alien has been referred for an interview by an asylum \nofficer[,]” id. § 235.3(b)(4).  Once the immigration officer orders the non-citizen \nremoved, a supervisor reviews the order before it is considered final, see id. \n§ 235.3(b)(7), but there is no right to appeal of the order of removal or to any hearing \nbefore an immigration judge, see id. § 235.3(b)(2)(ii). \nAccording to the House Judiciary Committee, when Congress adopted expedited \nremoval in the IIRIRA in 1996, it specifically found that rapid removal procedures were \n“necessary” because “thousands of aliens arrive in the U.S. at airports each year \nwithout valid documents and attempt to illegally enter the U.S.[,]” and it determined \nthat “[u]nless such aliens claim to be U.S. nationals, or state a fear of persecution, there \nis no requirement under the Constitution or international treaty to do anything other \nthan return them, as promptly as possible, to where they boarded the plane to come \n \n5 If “[a]n alien[’s] claim to lawful permanent resident, refugee, asylee status, or U.S. citizen status \ncannot be verified,” the non-citizen “will be advised of the penalties for perjury, and will be placed \nunder oath or allowed to make a declaration[.]”  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(5)(i).  Once this has occurred, \n“[t]he immigration officer shall issue an expedited order of removal . . . and refer the alien to [an] \nimmigration judge for review of the order[.]”  Id.  Pending that review, “[t]he person shall be \ndetained[,]” unless deemed eligible for parole.  Id.; see also id. § 235.3(b)(5)(iv).  Also, “[t]here is no \nappeal from the decision of the immigration judge” reviewing the immigration officer’s order of \nremoval.  Id. § 235.3(b)(5)(iv). \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 14 of 126\nhere.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, at 158.  Thus, “[t]he purpose of [the IIRIRA’s expedited \nremoval] provisions is to expedite the removal from the United States of aliens who \nindisputably have no authorization to be admitted to the United States, while providing \nan opportunity for such an alien who claims asylum to have the merits of his or her \nclaim promptly assessed by officers with full professional training in adjudicating \nasylum claims.”  H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 209 (1996) (Conf. Rep.). \nB.  Agency Implementation Of The INA’s Expedited Removal Provision\nAs noted, the statutory provision that authorizes expedited removal—\nsection 1225(b)(1) of Title 8 of the United States Code, which is also sometimes \nreferred to as “section 235(b)(1)” of the INA—specifically states that an undocumented \nnon-citizen is subject to removal without a hearing or review if he is “arriving in the \nUnited States” or if he is “described in clause (iii)” of that provision.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  Clause (iii), in turn, authorizes the Attorney General to “apply” the \nexpedited removal process to “any and all aliens” that fit a broad category of \nundocumented non-citizens that Congress generally describes, “as designated by the \nAttorney General[.]”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  And the statute further describes the \ncategory of persons from which the Attorney General may choose to designate classes \nof individuals for expedited removal, as follows:  “[a]n alien described in this clause is \nan alien . . . who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has \nnot affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has \nbeen physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period \nimmediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility[.]” Id. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).  \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 15 of 126\nThe statute also states that the designation of which particular classes of “aliens” \nwill be subject to expedited removal within the scope of this provision will be made “in \nthe sole and unreviewable discretion” of the Attorney General and “may be modified at \nany time.”  Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I); see also H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 209 (“The \nprovisions also may be applied, in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the Attorney \nGeneral, to an alien who has not been paroled or admitted into the United States and \nwho cannot affirmatively show to an immigration officer that he or she has been \ncontinuously present in the United States for a period of 2 years immediately prior to \nthe date of the officer’s determination.”).  To date, the Attorney General and DHS (the \nagency to whom the Attorney General has now delegated his authority to make clause \n(iii) designations) have identified classes of non-citizens that will be subject to the \nINA’s expedited removal process, per section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii), on four occasions. \n1. Prior Section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) Expedited Removal Designations\nFirst, when the IIRIRA’s expedited removal provision initially went into effect \n(on April 1, 1997), Attorney General Janet Reno opted to subject to expedited removal \nonly “arriving aliens” seeking entry into the United States.  See 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312, \n10,312–13 (Mar. 6, 1997).6  Thus, no foreign national who was already inside the \nUnited States and who had not been admitted or paroled was initially exposed to the \nexpedited removal process.  See id.  Moreover, the Attorney General expressly \n“acknowledge[d] that application of the expedited removal provisions to aliens already \nin the United States [would] involve more complex determinations of fact and [would] \nbe more difficult to manage”; therefore, the government sought “to gain insight and \n \n6 Attorney General Reno’s Notice also delegated her authority to designate who can be subject to \nexpedited removal to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  See 62 Fed. Reg. at 10,312. \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 16 of 126\nexperience by initially applying these new provisions on a more limited and controlled \nbasis.”  Id.\nIn 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service invoked the authority that \nhad been given to it under section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) to designate as subject to \nexpedited removal “all aliens who arrive in the United States by sea, either by boat or \nother means, who are not admitted or paroled, and who have not been physically present \nin the United States continuously for the two-year period prior to a determination of \ninadmissibility by a Service officer[.]”  67 Fed. Reg. 68,924, 68,925 (Nov. 13, 2002).  \nThe agency justified this new designation by stating that it “believe[d] that \nimplementing the expedited removal provisions, and exercising its authority to detain \nthis class of aliens . . . , will assist in deterring surges in illegal migration by sea, \nincluding potential mass migration, and preventing loss of life.”  Id. at 68,924.  \nAccording to the agency, the designation “will deter additional aliens from taking to the \nsea and traveling illegally to the United States.  Illegal migration by sea is perilous and \nthe Department of Justice has repeatedly cautioned aliens considering similar attempts \nto reject such a hazardous voyage.”  Id. at 68,925.\nIn 2004, DHS7 exercised its designation authority once more, expanding \nexpedited removal beyond those individuals who arrive by sea, to include \n“[a]liens . . . who are encountered by an immigration officer within 100 air miles of any \nU.S. international land border, and who have not established to the satisfaction of an \nimmigration officer that they have been physically present in the U.S. continuously for \n \n7 In 2002, Congress abolished the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and thus transferred its \ndesignation authority under the INA to DHS.  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.

Reg. 48,877, \n48,880 (Aug. 11, 2004).  According to the agency, “exercising its statutory authority to \nplace these individuals in expedited removal proceedings will enhance national security \nand public safety by facilitating prompt immigration determinations, enabling DHS to \ndeal more effectively with the large volume of persons seeking illegal entry, and ensure \nremoval from the country of those not granted relief, while at the same time protecting \nthe rights of the individuals affected.”  Id. at 48,877.  The agency maintained that \nexpedited removal is “a valuable tool[,]” and that, “[p]resently DHS officers cannot \napply expedited removal procedures to the nearly 1 million aliens who are apprehended \neach year in close proximity to the borders after illegal entry”; the agency also \nemphasized that “[i]t is not logistically possible for DHS to initiate formal removal \nproceedings against all such aliens.”  Id. at 48,878.   \nDHS further acknowledged that “[t]his is primarily a problem along the southern \nborder, and thus the majority of such aliens are Mexican nationals, who are \n‘voluntarily’ returned to Mexico without any formal removal order[,]” and “[b]ased \nupon anecdotal evidence, many of those who are returned to Mexico seek to reenter the \nU.S. illegally, often within 24 hours of being voluntarily returned[.]”  Id.  Additionally, \n“[b]ecause DHS lacks the resources to detain all third-country nationals (aliens who are \nneither nationals of Mexico nor Canada) who have been apprehended after illegally \ncrossing into the U.S. from both the northern and southern land borders, many of these \naliens are released in the U.S. each year with a notice to appear for removal \nproceedings[,]” but, the agency noted, “[m]any of these aliens subsequently fail to \nappear for their removal proceedings, and then disappear in the U.S.”  Id. \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 18 of 126\n2. Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan’s Notice Of July 23, 2019 \nDHS’s third and most recent expansion of the expedited removal designation \noccurred on July 23, 2019, and is the subject of Plaintiffs’ complaint.  On that date, the \nActing Secretary of DHS issued a “Notice” in the Federal Register that stated that he \nwas “exercising his statutory authority through this Notice to designate for expedited \nremoval the following categories of aliens not previously designated[,]” 84 Fed. Reg. at \n35,409, effective immediately:  \n[a]liens . . . who either (a) did not arrive by sea, are encountered by \nan immigration officer anywhere in the United States more than 100 \nair miles from a U.S. international land border, and have not been \nphysically present in the United States continuously for the two-year \nperiod  immediately  prior  to  the  date  of  the  determination  of \ninadmissibility, or (b) did not arrive by sea, are encountered by an \nimmigration officer within 100 air miles from a U.S. international \nland border, and have been physically present in the United States \ncontinuously at least 14 days but less than two years immediately \nprior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility. \n \nId. at 35,414; see also id. at 35,410.  According to the Notice, this “New Designation” \n(as the Notice refers to it) is intended to “harmonize the authorization for aliens \narriving by land with the existing authorization for aliens arriving by sea.”  Id. at \n35,409.  Thus, while distance from the border, means of arrival, and the relative \nrecency of an undocumented non-citizen’s arrival in the United States had previously\nbeen distinguishing factors that determined one’s risk of being subjected to expedited \nremoval, under DHS’s New Designation, an undocumented non-citizen who arrives by \nland and is “encountered” anywhere in the United States “bears the affirmative burden \nto show to the satisfaction of an immigration officer that the alien has been present in \nthe United States continuously” for at least two years, id. at 35,414, and if he is unable \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 19 of 126\nto satisfy this burden, he can be subjected to expedited removal, at the discretion of an \nimmigration official.8\nActing DHS Secretary McAleenan’s July 23rd Notice spells out reasons for the \nagency’s reasons for pursuing this policy change.  The Notice maintains that the New \nDesignation will “enhance national security and public safety—while reducing \ngovernment costs—by facilitating prompt immigration determinations.”  Id. at 35,409.  \nThe agency states that it “is issuing the New Designation to use more effectively and \nefficiently its limited resources to fulfill its mission to enforce the immigration laws \nand ensure the security of the Nation’s borders[,]” and that “[f]ully implementing \nexpedited removal will help to alleviate some of the burden and capacity issues \ncurrently faced by DHS and [the Department of Justice] by allowing DHS to remove \ncertain aliens encountered in the interior more quickly, as opposed to placing those \naliens in more time-consuming removal proceedings.”  Id. at 35,411.  Additionally, \n“ICE will be able to use expedited removal for certain aliens who[m] it arrests in the \ninterior, which will likely result in those aliens spending less time in ICE detention than \nif they were placed in full removal proceedings[,]” which “will more quickly make \navailable additional ICE bed space, which can be used for additional interior arrests and \nremovals.”  Id.  Finally, the agency explains that it “expects that the New Designation \n \n8\nThe July 23rd Notice does not alter the substantial degree of officer discretion that DHS has always \nafforded with respect to whether expedited removal will be imposed in any given case.  That is, even if \nan undocumented non-citizen is covered by the expanded designation, the immigration officer who is \nconsidering the matter has “broad discretion to apply expedited removal” or to “permit certain aliens \notherwise eligible for placement into expedited removal proceedings” to resolve their immigration \nstatus through other means, including by placement in “full removal proceedings[.]”  84 Fed. Reg. at \n35,412.  Moreover, if an undocumented non-citizen who has been pegged for expedited removal claims \n“under oath, after being warned of the penalties for perjury,” that he is entitled to remain in the United \nStates as an authorized permanent resident, refugee, asylum asylee, or citizen, the Notice provides that \nhe will receive “prompt review of th[e] determination” that he is subject to expedited removal.  Id. at \n35,411.    \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 20 of 126\nwill help mitigate additional backlogs in the immigration courts and will reduce the \nsignificant costs to the government associated with full removal proceedings before an \nimmigration judge, including the costs of a longer detention period and government \nrepresentation in those proceedings.”  Id. at 35,412. \nWhatever its motivation, per the July 23rd Notice, DHS has now designated for \nexpedited removal the entire category of persons that the INA’s section \n235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) describes.  DHS implemented this policy change approximately 30 \nmonths after President Trump signed an Executive Order specifically calling on DHS to \nexpand expedited removal to its full possible scope, see Exec. Order No. 13,767, Border \nSecurity and Immigration Enforcement Improvements, 82 Fed. Reg. 8,793, 8,796 (Jan. \n30, 2017), and some 29 months after former Secretary of DHS John Kelly issued a \nmemorandum that expressed DHS’s intention to expand the application of the expedited \nremoval process, as the President requested.9 In the time that elapsed between then-\nDHS Secretary Kelly’s memorandum of February 20, 2017, and the Federal Register \nNotice of July 23, 2019, DHS did not issue a proposed rule that notified the public that \nthe agency was considering this change, nor did it otherwise solicit public comment \nregarding its generally expressed intent to expand the expedited removal designation to \nthe fullest extent authorized by statute.  However, the July 23rd Notice itself invites \n“[i]nterested persons” to “submit written comments” about the New Designation, via \nthe federal government’s rulemaking website.  84 Fed. Reg. at 35,410.  \n \n9 See Implementing the President’s Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvement \nPolicies, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 5–7 (Feb. 20, 2017), \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/17_0220_S1_Implementing-the-Presidents-Border-\nSecurity-Immigration-Enforcement-Improvement-Policies.pdf. \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 21 of 126\nC. Judicial Review Of Legal Claims Regarding Expedited Removal\nThe IIRIRA not only establishes that certain undocumented non-citizens can be \ndesignated in the sole discretion of administrative authorities as subject to the expedited \nremoval process, it also addresses whether and to what extent the federal courts can \nentertain challenges to various aspects of the statutorily prescribed expedited removal \nscheme.  Indeed, as part of its enactment of the IIRIRA, Congress crafted an entirely \nnew judicial review provision within the INA that is expressly entitled “Judicial review \nof orders of removal[,]” 8 U.S.C. § 1252, which is codified at section 1252 of Title 8 of \nthe United States Code, and is also known as “section 242.”  See also IIRIRA, Pub. L. \nNo. 104-208, Div. C., Title I, § 306, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 607–12 (1996).   \nTwo subsections of the aforementioned judicial review provision plainly pertain \nto this Court’s review of claims relating to the statutory section that authorizes \nexpedited removal (8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)): namely, section 1252(a)(2)(A) and section \n1252(e).  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A) (“Review relating to section 1225(b)(1)”); id. \n§ 1252(e)(“Judicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)”).  To aid the reader, \nrelevant portions of these two sections, and others, are appended to this Memorandum \nOpinion in their entirety.  (See infra, Appendix.) \nSection 1252(a)(2)(A) is the first of a series of judicial review provisions that \nCongress lays out in the IIRIRA regarding “[m]atters not subject to judicial review.”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2) (emphasis added).  Prior to broaching this subject, the statute \nplainly distinguishes, on the one hand, judicial review of final orders of removal that \nresult from standard removal procedures (which are reviewed by Courts of Appeals), \nsee id. § 1252(a)(1); see also O.A., 2019 WL 3536334, at *9, from, on the other hand, \njudicial review of final orders of removal that result from the section 1225(b)(1) \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 22 of 126\nexpedited removal process.  Section 1252(a)(2) then lists “[r]eview relating to section \n1225(b)(1)” as the first of four categories of matters concerning removal orders in \nwhich judicial review has been restricted.  That section reads, in relevant part:  \n(2) Matters not subject to judicial review \n(A) Review relating to section 1225(b)(1) \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or \nnonstatutory),10 . . . no court shall have jurisdiction to review—\n(i)  except as provided in subsection (e), any individual \ndetermination or to entertain any other cause or claim arising \nfrom or relating to the implementation or operation of an order \nof removal pursuant to section 1225(b)(1) of this title,\n \n(ii)  except as provided in subsection (e), a decision by the Attorney \nGeneral to invoke the provisions of such section, \n \n(iii) the application of such section to individual aliens, including \nthe determination made under section 1225(b)(1)(B) of this \ntitle, or  \n \n(iv) except as provided in subsection (e), procedures and policies \nadopted by the Attorney General to implement the provisions of\nsection 1225(b)(1) of this title.  \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A).   \nThe IIRIRA’s judicial review provision thus plainly homes in on the expedited \nremoval process prescribed in section 1225(b)(1), and generally prohibits courts from \nexercising jurisdiction with respect to four categories of legal actions—to wit, actions \nthat challenge: (1) “individual determinations” or bring “any other cause or claim \narising from or relating to the implementation or operation of an order of [expedited] \nremoval,” id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i); (2) the Attorney General’s decision “to invoke the \nprovisions” of the expedited removal statute, id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(ii); (3) “the \n \n10 The “(statutory or nonstatutory)” language was added in 2005.  See REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. \nNo. 109-13, Div. B., Title I, § 106, 119 Stat. 231, 310 (2005). \n20 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 23 of 126\napplication of” the expedited removal statute “to individual aliens,” including the \nconsideration and resolution of asylum claims made by individuals subject to expedited \nremoval, id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii); and (4) the “procedures and policies” that the \nAttorney General adopts “to implement the provisions” of the expedited removal \nstatute, id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(iv).  See also H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 219 (explaining \nthat, in general, under section 1252(a)(2)(A), “no court shall have jurisdiction to review \nany individual determination or cause or claim arising from the implementation or \noperation of an order of removal” under the expedited removal statute, and no court can \n“review . . . a decision by the Attorney General to invoke [the expedited removal \nstatute], the application of such section to individual aliens (including the \ndetermination . . . regarding credible fear of persecution), or . . . procedures and \npolicies to implement [the expedited removal provision]”).  Significantly for present \npurposes, with one exception, Congress has made each of these jurisdictional \nlimitations expressly subject to the provisions of subsection (e).  See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A)(i), (ii), (iv) (opening with “except as provided in subsection (e)” \n(emphasis added)).  And in so doing, the statute carves out exceptions to the \njurisdictional restrictions, and also further clarifies what courts can and cannot do with \nrespect to legal challenges that relate to the expedited removal process. \n  For its part, section 1252(e) is entitled “Judicial review of orders under section \n1225(b)(1)[.]”  Id. § 1252(e).  The section has five subdivisions, each of which speaks \nto one or more aspects of a federal court’s power to review certain types of claims \nand/or afford certain types of relief.  See, e.g., id. § 1252(e)(1) (addressing \n“[l]imitations on relief[,]” and prohibiting, among other things, “declaratory, injunctive \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 24 of 126\nor other equitable relief in any action pertaining to an order to exclude an alien in \naccordance with section 1225(b)(1)” except under specified circumstances); id.\n§ 1252(e)(2) (permitting habeas review of expedited removal orders, with limitations); \nid. § 1252(e)(5) (providing, with respect to a case in which “an alien has been ordered \nremoved under section 1225(b)(1)[,]” that the court’s “[s]cope of inquiry” is restricted \nto a determination of “whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to \nthe petitioner” and does not include “whether the alien is actually inadmissible”); see \nalso H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at 219 (explaining that “[i]ndividual determinations under \n[section 1225(b)(1)] may only be reviewed under [section 1252(e)(1)–(2)]”).  It is the \nthird subdivision of subsection (e)—8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)—that is most pertinent for \npresent purposes, as it forms the basis for many of the jurisdictional claims and \narguments that are at issue in this case.   \nThe title of section 1252(e)(3) is “[c]hallenges on validity of the system[.]”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  In their entirety, the provisions of that statute state: \n(3) Challenges on validity of the system \n(A) In general \nJudicial review of determinations under section 1225(b) of this \ntitle and its implementation is available in an action instituted in \nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia, but \nshall be limited to determinations of— \n(i) whether  such  section,  or  any  regulation  issued  to \nimplement such section, is constitutional; or \n(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, \nwritten policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or \nunder the authority of the Attorney General to implement \nsuch section, is not consistent with applicable provisions \nof this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law. \n \n22 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 25 of 126\n(B) Deadlines for bringing actions\nAny action instituted under this paragraph must be filed no later than 60 days \nafter the date the challenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or \nprocedure described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) is first \nimplemented.\n \n(C) Notice of appeal \nA notice of appeal of an order issued by the District Court under this \nparagraph may be filed not later than 30 days after the date of issuance of \nsuch order.\n \n(D)  Expeditious consideration of cases\nIt shall be the duty of the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and the \nSupreme Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to expedite \nto the greatest possible extent the disposition of any case considered under \nthis paragraph. \nId. From the plain language of the text of this provision, it is clear that the statute \ncomprehensively addresses the particular circumstances under which challenges to the \nvalidity of the expedited removal system are permitted, see H.R. Rep. No. 104-828, at \n220–21 (“[J]udicial review . . . is limited to whether [section 1225(b)(1)], or any \nregulations issued pursuant to that section, is constitutional, or whether the regulations, \nor a written policy directive, written policy guidance, or written procedures issued by \nthe Attorney General are consistent with the INA or other law.”), as well as the time \nframe in which any such challenge must be brought and considered.   \nIII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nAs explained in Part I.B.2, above, on July 23, 2019, Acting DHS Secretary Kevin \nMcAleenan announced that the agency was “exercis[ing] the full remaining scope of its \nstatutory authority to place in expedited removal, with limited exceptions, aliens \ndetermined to be inadmissible . . . who have not been admitted or paroled into the \n23 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 26 of 126\nUnited States, and who have not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an \nimmigration officer, that they have been physically present in the United States \ncontinuously for the two-year period immediately preceding the date of the \ndetermination of inadmissibility.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 35,409.  Plaintiffs filed the instant \nlawsuit on August 6, 2019 (see Compl.), bringing six claims under the APA, the INA, \nand the Constitution.  Plaintiffs specifically allege that, “[i]n addition to violating the \nAPA, expanding expedited removal to individuals apprehended in the interior of the \nUnited States who have been living in the country for extended periods of time violates \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it deprives them a meaningful \nopportunity and process to contest removal before they are deported.”  (Id. ¶ 11.)  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs claim that “the expanded use of expedited removal violates \nfederal statutes requiring that noncitizens appearing before an immigration officer or \nimmigration judge be permitted to be represented by counsel.”  (Id.)   \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on August 8, 2019, seeking \nto enjoin Defendants from applying expedited removal as laid out in the notice of July \n23, 2019, pending the resolution of their lawsuit.  (See Pls.’ Mot.)  Per an Order of the \nCourt that issued on August 14, 2019 (see Min. Order of Aug. 14, 2019), the parties \nproceeded to brief the issues raised in Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion, \nincluding concerns that defense counsel had raised in a conference call with Plaintiffs \nand the Court regarding Plaintiffs’ standing to pursue their claims.  (See Pls.’ Suppl. Br. \nin Supp. of Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Suppl. Br.”), ECF No. 23; Defs.’ Opp’n, ECF No. 25; \nPls.’ Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Reply”), ECF No. 28.)11 \n \n11 Seventeen states and the District of Columbia also filed an amicus brief in support of Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a preliminary injunction on August 21, 2019.  (See ECF No. 24-1.)  In their brief, the states \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 27 of 126\nIn the motion for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs argue that they have \nassociational standing to bring this lawsuit (see generally Pls.’ Suppl. Br.); that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their individual claims (see Pls.’ Mem. in Supp. of \nPls.’ Mot. (“Pls.’ Mem.”), ECF No. 13-1, at 25–52); and that the remaining factors that \nthe Court must consider in assessing whether or not to grant preliminary injunctive \nrelief weigh in their favor (see id. at 52–55).  Defendants respond in opposition that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not justiciable, because the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction \n(see Defs.’ Opp’n at 33–36); that Plaintiffs lack standing (see id. at 36–41); and that \nPlaintiffs lack a cause of action to bring their claims under the APA (see id. at 41–46).  \nDefendants further maintain that Plaintiffs’ claims are meritless (see id. at 46–72), and \nthat the remaining preliminary-injunction factors weigh in DHS’s favor (see id. at 72–\n75).  Finally, Defendants insist that “any interim relief must be sharply limited.”  (Id. at \n75 (capitalization altered).) \nThis Court held a hearing regarding Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction on September 6, 2019, and took the motion under advisement.  (See Min. \nEntry of Sept. 6, 2019; Hr’g Tr. (“AM Hr’g Tr.”), ECF No. 32; Hr’g Tr. (“PM Hr’g \nTr.”), ECF No. 33.)   \nIV.  MOTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS IN CASES \nCHALLENGING AGENCY ACTION \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 authorizes a plaintiff who fears that a \ndefendant’s actions will irreversibly and irremediably injure the plaintiff’s interests \n \nargue that DHS’s expansion of expedited removal will undermine their ability to protect the rights and \ninterests of their residents, and will harm “individuals, families, communities, and the public served by \namici states[.]”  (Id. at 26 (capitalization altered).) \n25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 28 of 126\nbefore the court can rule on legal claims that the plaintiff has filed to seek a court order \nthat “preserve[s] the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be \nheld[,]” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. \n2006); in other words, an order that preserves the status quo, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  \nWhen a plaintiff invokes this rule to claim that he will be irreparably injured by the \nunlawful actions of a federal administrative agency, the typical request asks the court to \nsuspend implementation of the challenged agency action during the pendency of the \nlawsuit, which is an authorized means of preserving the status quo and preventing harm \nto the plaintiff pending the outcome of the litigation.  See, e.g., League of Women \nVoters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 14–15 (D.C. Cir. 2016); League of Women Voters \nof U.S. v. Newby, 671 Fed. App’x 820, 821 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (per curiam); Nat’l Ass’n of \nFarmworkers Orgs. v. Marshall, 628 F.2d 604, 622–23 (D.C. Cir. 1980).  It is well \nestablished that “[t]he grant or denial of a [requested] preliminary injunction rests in \nthe discretion of the trial court.”  11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary \nKay Kane, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2949 (3d ed. 2019). \nRegardless of whether a plaintiff is seeking a preliminary injunction in a case \nchallenging agency action or in a standard civil action brought against a private \ndefendant, a motion for a preliminary injunction “require[s] the Court to assess \nprospectively the merits of the plaintiffs’ case and their need for immediate judicial \nintervention.”  Shelley v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 775 F. Supp. 2d 197, 203 (D.D.C. \n2011).  Moreover, any such injunction is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be \nawarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. \nNat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) (citation omitted); see also Guedes \n26 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 29 of 126\nv. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 920 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(per curiam).  Indeed, “[i]t frequently is observed that a preliminary injunction is an \nextraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, by \na clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. \n968, 972 (1997) (internal quotation marks, citation, and emphasis omitted). \nGive the movant’s burden of persuasion, “[e]vidence that goes beyond the \nunverified allegations of the pleadings and motion papers must be presented to support \nor oppose a motion for a preliminary injunction.”  Id.; see also id. (explaining that the \nstrict evidentiary standards required for summary judgment do not necessarily apply for \npreliminary injunctions, given the need for speedy resolution, and because issuing a \npreliminary injunction does not replace the need for a trial on the merits).  In particular, \nto be granted a preliminary injunction, the movant “must establish (1) that it is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, (2) that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, (3) that the balance of equities tips in its favor, and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.”  Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Dep’t of Justice, 15 F. \nSupp. 3d 32, 38 (D.D.C. 2014) (alterations omitted) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20)).  \nAnd when analyzing these four factors, “a district court must balance the strengths of \nthe requesting party’s arguments in each of the four required areas.  If the showing in \none area is particularly strong, an injunction may issue even if the showings in other \nareas are rather weak.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted) (quoting \nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297).  That being said, “a movant \nmust demonstrate ‘at least some injury’ for a preliminary injunction to issue.”  \nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297 (citation omitted). \n27 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 30 of 126\nIt is also clear beyond cavil that the most significant factors of the preliminary \ninjunction test are likelihood of the movant’s success on the merits of his claims and\nwhether or not he is likely to suffer irreparable injury while the lawsuit is pending, \nbecause these factors relate directly to the purpose of a preliminary injunction.  “It is \nparticularly important for the movant to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success \non the merits[,]” because “absent a ‘substantial indication’ of likely success on the \nmerits, ‘there would be no justification for the court’s intrusion into the ordinary \nprocesses of administration and judicial review.’”  Hubbard v. United States, 496 F. \nSupp. 2d 194, 198 (D.D.C. 2007) (quoting Am. Bankers Ass’n v. Nat’l Credit Union \nAdmin., 38 F. Supp. 2d 114, 140 (D.D.C. 1999)).  Moreover, “the basis of injunctive \nrelief in the federal courts has always been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal \nremedies,” Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 88 (1974) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted), since a preliminary injunction entitles the movant to judicial \nintervention before a ruling on the merits precisely because “the applicant is likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be rendered.”  Wright, \nMiller, & Kane, § 2948.1.\nV. ANALYSIS \nAs noted above, a federal court that invokes its authority to enjoin an agency’s\nconduct preliminarily pending the court’s final order in the matter is thereby effectively \naccelerating provision of the relief that the plaintiff seeks, prior to the conclusion of the \nlitigation.  Thus, before a preliminary injunction issues, this Court must be persuaded \nthat there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiff will eventually prevail on the \nmerits and that interim injunctive relief is warranted because the plaintiff will suffer \n28 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 31 of 126\nirreparable harm without such relief.  See Sampson, 415 U.S. at 88; Apotex, Inc. v. \nSebelius, 700 F. Supp. 2d 138, 140 (D.D.C. 2010).  For the reasons explained below, \nthis Court concludes that Plaintiffs Make the Road New York, LUPE, and WeCount! are \nlikely to be successful with respect to the merits of the APA claims they have brought \nin this case, and that the irreparable injury, balance of the harms, and public interest \nfactors also support the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  The Court further imposes \na preliminary injunction that prevents DHS from enforcing the expanded expedited \nremoval policy announced in the July 23rd Notice with respect to anyone to whom the \ndesignation in the Notice would apply while the question of the legal propriety of the \nagency’s action is pending in this Court, consistent with the plain language of the APA.      \nA.  Plaintiffs Have A Likelihood Of Succeeding With Respect To Their \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) Claims \nA court’s determination of a plaintiff’s likelihood of success with respect to the \nlegal claims they have brought involves various considerations, including the plaintiff’s \npotential of carrying threshold burdens such as the requirement that a plaintiff \ndemonstrate subject-matter jurisdiction and Article III standing.  See Shelley, 775 F. \nSupp. 2d at 203 (“[I]n evaluating plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits, the \nCourt must determine that it may properly exercise jurisdiction over the action.”); Elec. \nPrivacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 928 F.3d 95, 104 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (“In \ndetermining whether the plaintiff has ‘a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits,’ . . . [courts] have considered whether the plaintiff has a ‘substantial likelihood \nof standing’—that is, whether the plaintiff is likely to be able to demonstrate standing \nat the summary judgment stage.”).  In the instant case, it is likely that the Court has \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA claims and that Plaintiffs have associational standing.  \n29 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 32 of 126\nPlaintiffs are also likely to be successful with respect to their claims that the APA’s \nprocedural mandates apply and that DHS’s July 23rd Notice violated its notice-and-\ncomment and non-arbitrary rulemaking requirements.12 \n1. Plaintiffs Are Likely To Be Able To Demonstrate That Article III’s \nJurisdictional And Standing Requirements Are Satisfied\nBecause federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, the threshold concern of \nany plaintiff is to demonstrate that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction to review \nthe claims alleged and that the plaintiffs themselves have standing to bring such claims \nin federal court.  See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (“It \nis to be presumed that a cause lies outside [federal courts’] limited jurisdiction, and the \nburden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction[.]” \n(internal citations omitted)); Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (“The \nparty invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing [the] elements [of \nArticle III standing].” (citation omitted)).  Here, Plaintiffs maintain that this Court has \nsubject matter jurisdiction over their APA claims pursuant to two federal statutes: 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  (See Compl. ¶ 16 (alleging that section \n1252(e)(3) provides jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia over “‘[c]hallenges [to the] validity of the system,’” and stating that “[t]he \nCourt also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331” (first and second alterations in \n \n12 Given this Court’s finding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of those two claims \n(Counts One and Five of Plaintiffs’ complaint), the Court need not address Plaintiffs’ other \nallegations—i.e., their claims that DHS’s expanded expedited removal designation breaches: the \nConstitution’s Due Process Clause (Count Two), the INA and the APA’s requirement that DHS provide \nmeaningful process (Count Three), the INA’s and APA’s right to counsel in particular (Count Four), \nand the Constitution’s Suspension Clause (Count Six).  See infra Part V.A; see also, e.g., FTC v. \nMallett, 818 F. Supp. 2d 142, 148 n.5 (D.D.C. 2011) (noting that “[b]ecause the Court finds that the \nFTC has shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its first claim . . . , it need not address whether \nthe FTC has also established a likelihood of success on the merits of its [other] claims”). \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 33 of 126\noriginal)).)  Plaintiffs also assert that “[a]ll three Plaintiff Organizations . . . have \nassociational standing to challenge” the July 23rd Notice (Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 5), because \n“[e]ach Plaintiff Organization has one or more members with standing to challenge” the \nJuly 23rd Notice (id.); the interests Plaintiffs seek to protect are germane to the \norganizations’ purposes (see id. at 10); and the issues involved in this matter do not \nrequire the participation of individual members to be resolved properly (see id. at 11).  \nTesting these propositions requires this Court to evaluate the jurisdictional basis \nfor its own power to review claims like the ones Plaintiffs have raised, which \nnecessarily includes an examination of the interaction between federal question \njurisdiction under section 1331 and the INA’s judicial review provision under the \ncircumstances presented here.  The Court must also determine whether it is likely that \nthese Plaintiff organizations have members who have a redressable injury-in-fact that is \nsufficient to support Plaintiffs’ assertion of Article III standing.  For the following \nreasons, this Court finds, as a preliminary matter, that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in \nestablishing that their APA claims satisfy Article III’s jurisdiction and standing \nrequirements. \na.  It is likely that this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to \nconsider Plaintiffs’ APA claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1331  \nPlaintiffs’ argument that this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction under section \n1331 of Title 28 to consider their APA claims is likely correct, as a general matter, \nsince the D.C. Circuit has long held that a federal court’s jurisdiction to consider claims \nchallenging agency action under the APA derives from the “so-called ‘federal question’ \nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which grants the district court ‘original jurisdiction o[ver] all \ncivil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States[.]” \n31 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 34 of 126\nOryszak v. Sullivan, 576 F.3d 522, 524–25 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  Indeed, it is by now well \nestablished that “while many APA claims are brought pursuant to a separate substantive \nstatute, a court may alternatively have jurisdiction under Section 1331 over a claim \nunder the APA, based on allegations that an agency action was arbitrary and capricious \nor that an agency took action without observing procedures required by law.”  Seeger v. \nDep’t of Defense, 306 F. Supp. 3d 265, 276 (D.D.C. 2008) (citing Trudeau v. FTC, 456 \nF.3d 178, 185 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). \nFor what it’s worth, in this Court’s view, it is doubtful that the INA provides a \nseparate font of jurisdictional authority, as Plaintiffs assert.  This is because the \nstatutory provision upon which Plaintiffs rely for this jurisdictional argument—section \n1252(e)(3)—is not couched in jurisdictional terms.  Cf. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 \nU.S. 500, 515 (2006) (explaining that a statutory restriction on judicial review that \n“does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the \ndistrict courts” is not jurisdictional).13  Moreover, the only part of the INA’s judicial \nreview provision that expressly references “jurisdiction” is section 1252(a), and that \nprovision is plainly devoted to laying out restrictions on the court’s jurisdiction to \n \n13 It is well established that not every statute that addresses the circumstances under which judicial \nreview is “available,” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3), qualifies as a jurisdictional provision.  See, e.g., Califano \nv. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 104–05 (1977) (holding that the APA does not grant subject-matter \njurisdiction to review agency action, despite the fact that “the statute undoubtedly evinces Congress’ \nintention and understanding that judicial review should be widely available to challenge the actions of \nfederal administrative officials”).  And while section 1253(e) plainly places review authority for the \nclaims that it preserves in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in the absence of any \njurisdictional language, it is likely that the better reading of this part of the provision is that it indicates \nCongress’s intent regarding venue rather than establishing subject-matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g., \nPanhandle E. Pipe Line Co. v. Fed. Power Comm'n, 324 U.S. 635, 638–39 (1945) (interpreting statute \nthat authorized plaintiffs to “obtain a review of such order in the circuit court of appeals of the United \nStates for any circuit wherein the natural-gas company to which the order relates is located or has its \nprincipal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia” and \nholding that the language “goes to venue not to jurisdiction”); cf. Oryszak, 576 F3d at 524 (interpreting \nthe APA’s own judicial review provision to provide a limited cause of action, but not jurisdiction). \n32 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 35 of 126\nconsider certain claims.  Subdivision (a) unquestionably pertains to when jurisdiction is \nnot available, and makes no affirmative statement about what a federal court does have \nthe power to consider with respect to claims pertaining to orders for expedited removal \nand the implementation of the INA’s expedited removal procedures.  Thus, in this \nCourt’s view, section 1252(a) reads much more like a jurisdiction-stripping provision \nthan one that establishes subject-matter jurisdiction independent of any other source.  \nSee, e.g., 22 U.S.C. § 6450 (“No court shall have jurisdiction to review any Presidential \ndetermination or agency action under this chapter or any amendment made by this \nchapter.”); 42 U.S.C. § 9622(e)(3)(C) (“[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review the \nnonbinding preliminary allocation of responsibility.”). \nIn any event, as already mentioned, section 1331 of Title 28 provides subject-\nmatter jurisdiction for a federal court to consider challenges to agency action such as \nthe APA claims that Plaintiffs bring here, as a general matter.  See Chrysler v. Brown, \n441 U.S. 281, 417 n.47 (1979).  Given the language of the judicial review provision of \nthe INA, however, the key jurisdictional question becomes whether the INA divests this \nCourt of the power that it would otherwise have had to review Plaintiffs’ APA claims.  \nSee Tex. Alliance for Home Care Servs. v. Sebelius, 681 F.3d 402, 408 (D.C. Cir. 2012); \nsee also Ass’n of Nat’l Advertisers v. FTC, 617 F.2d 611, 619 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (holding \nthat “[g]eneral federal question jurisdiction . . . gives the district courts the power to \nreview agency action absent a preclusion of review statute” (emphasis added)); Am. \nImmigr. Laws. Ass’n v. Reno, 18 F. Supp. 2d 38, 58 (D.D.C. 1998) (rejecting plaintiffs’ \nargument that, “even if the Court finds that the plaintiffs’ claims are not reviewable \nunder INA § 242(e)(3), the Court would still have federal question jurisdiction under 28 \n33 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 36 of 126\nU.S.C. § 1331 over many of these claims”).  After a careful review of the statutory \nprovisions at issue, this Court concludes that the INA does not bar the Court’s exercise \nof subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA claims.    \nFirst of all, when considered in context, the language of the INA’s section 1252 \nestablishes that, while Congress has revoked the jurisdiction of the federal courts to \nconsider certain claims pertaining to the expedited removal process, this Court’s power \nto consider claims that relate to a regulation or a written policy of DHS “to implement” \nexpedited removal is plainly preserved.  Beginning with section 1252(a)(2)(A), \nCongress makes clear that “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or \nnonstatutory) . . . no court shall have jurisdiction to review” legal claims concerning \nexpedited removal—including claims that challenge “a decision by [DHS] to invoke the \nprovisions” of the expedited removal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(ii), or \n“procedures and policies adopted by [DHS] to implement the provisions” of the \nexpedited removal statute, id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(iv)—“except as provided in subsection \n(e),” id. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i), (ii), (iv) (emphasis added).  Subsection (e) thus operates as \na carveout from subdivision (a)(2)’s jurisdiction-stripping function. \nSubdivision (e)(3) then specifically states that United States District Court for \nthe District of Columbia has the power to review “determinations under section 1225(b) \nof this title and its implementation[,]” id. § 1252(e)(3)(A), so long as the claim at issue \nconcerns (1) whether section 1225(b), or “any regulation issued to implement [that] \nsection,” is unconstitutional, id. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(i), or (2) whether “a regulation, or a \nwritten policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or \nunder the authority of the Attorney General to implement” section 1225(b) is \n34 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 37 of 126\ninconsistent with the INA “or is otherwise in violation of law[,]” id.\n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii).  Consequently, in practical effect, “[s]ection 1252(e)(3) vests \nexclusive jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to \nreview ‘[c]hallenges [to the] validity of the [expedited removal] system[]’” and “[s]uch \nsystemic challenges include . . . challenges claiming that a given regulation or written \npolicy directive, guideline, or procedure is inconsistent with law.”  Grace v. Whitaker, \n344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 115 (D.D.C. 2018) (alterations in original) (ellipsis added) (quoting \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3))).   \nAs relevant here, this Court has little doubt that Plaintiffs’ APA claims assailing \nDHS’s July 23rd Notice qualify as challenges to “a regulation, or a written policy \ndirective, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or under the authority \nof the Attorney General to implement” section 1225(b).  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii) \n(emphasis added).  Far from attacking any particular expedited removal determination \nor the substance of DHS’s expanded expedited removal designation, Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint claims that the procedures DHS used (or failed to use) when exercising its \nauthority under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii) to designate a new class of non-citizens as \nsubject to expedited removal pursuant to that provision violates the APA.  (See Compl. \n¶¶ 129–34, 149–51.)  This Court agrees with Plaintiffs that a challenge to the \nprocedures DHS used when it exercised its discretion to designate categories of persons \nas subject to expedited removal is an attack on DHS’s implementation of the expedited \nremoval scheme.  (See Pls.’ Reply at 18 (explaining that Plaintiffs are challenging “the \nmanner in which Defendants implement the designation decision, including the process \nby which that designation is made, as well as the manner in which Defendants \n35 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 38 of 126\nimplement the expedited removal statute through written rules and policies that set out \nthe procedures that apply in expedited removal proceedings” (emphasis in original)).)  \nThus, per the plain text of section 1252(e)(3), the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia retains the power to review claims that a written policy of DHS \nhas implemented the agency’s designation authority as set forth in the INA’s section \n1225(b) in a manner that violates law (namely, the APA), despite the jurisdiction-\nstripping force of section 1252(a)(2).   \nThe primary thrust of Defendants’ opposition to this jurisdictional analysis is the \nstrange contention that only individuals who are subject to an expedited removal order \nunder the INA’s section 1225(b)(1) can challenge the implementation of the expedited \nremoval scheme under section 1252(e)(3), yet “no Plaintiff [in the instant case] is an \nindividual who is presently subject to expedited removal procedures.”  (Defs.’ Opp’n at \n34; see also id. (“The triggering provision’s reference to ‘determinations under section \n1225(b)’ requires just that—a ‘determination.’”).)  This amounts to an argument that an \nactual removal order—or at least its potential—is a prerequisite to this Court’s power to \nconsider challenges to the expedited removal system under section 1252(e).  (See id.)  \nBut that articulation of the scope of this Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction finds no \nsupport in the relevant statutory text. \nTo understand why this is so, one must first acknowledge that “[t]he INA plainly \ndistinguishes among three different [DHS] decisions—‘designation,’ ‘implementation,’ \nand ‘determination’—and expresses a clear intent to provide judicial review over the \nlatter two.”  (Pls.’ Reply at 18–19 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)).)14  Contrary to \n \n14 Black’s Law Dictionary defines “designation” as “[t]he act of choosing someone or something for a \nparticular purpose[,]” Black’s Law Dictionary 541 (10th ed. 2014), and “determination” as “[t]he act of \n36 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 39 of 126\nDefendants’ contentions, nothing in the text of the INA’s section 242(e)(3)(A) requires \nthat a determination that a particular individual will be placed in expedited removal \nproceedings be made in order for the D.C. district court to have the power to consider a \nchallenge to the implementation of the statutory provision governing expedited removal.  \nIndeed, as the judge in O.A. v. Trump, Civ. No. 18-2718, 2019 WL 3536334, (D.D.C. \nAug. 2, 2019), recently observed, “[t]he language of § 1252(e)(3) is plain: it applies to \nboth ‘judicial review of determinations’ made under the expedited removal provision \nand to judicial review of the ‘implementation’ of that provision[,]” id. at *19 (emphasis \nadded).   \nThis Court, too, has no doubt that Congress intended to authorize the federal \ndistrict court in the District of Columbia to review challenges to both “determinations” \nmade under section 1225(b) and the “implementation” of the process of expedited \nremoval that that statutory provision establishes.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Thus, this \nCourt rejects defense counsel’s vigorous efforts to characterize section 1252(e)(3)’s \nreference to “implementation” as relating to the decision to subject a particular \nindividual to the expedited removal process. (See AM Hr’g Tr. at 35:21–23 (“You have \nto have an individual who is in these proceedings to have jurisdiction under Section \n1252(e)(3).”).)  Not only does this characterization make little sense in the context of \n \ndeciding something officially; esp[ecially], a final decision by a court or administrative agency[,]” id. \n544.  Black’s Law Dictionary does not define “implementation,” but Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate \nDictionary defines “implement” as “carry out, accomplish; esp[ecially] to give practical effect to and \nensure of actual fulfillment by concrete measures[.]”  Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 624 \n(11th ed. 2003).  While the INA does not itself provide definitions for these terms, the distinction \nbetween the terms “designation,” “implementation,” and “determination” appears to have been \nmaintained consistently throughout the relevant sections of the INA.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(A) (precluding jurisdiction over “any individual determination” or “any other cause of \naction or claim arising from or relating to implementation or operation of an order of removal” \n(emphasis added)); id. § 1252(e)(3)(A) (governing judicial review of “determinations under section \n1225(b) of this title and its implementation” (emphasis added)). \n37 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 40 of 126\nsection 1252(e)(3)’s preservation of challenges to the validity of the system, it is also \nunfaithful to language that Congress uses in that provision.  As the court in O.A. ably \nexplained, although “[o]ne might argue that ‘its implementation’ refers to \nimplementation of the removal order, and not to implementation of § 1225(b)[,] \n[t]hat . . . is not the best reading of the provision[;] [a]mong other things, the reference \nto ‘implementation’ is in the singular, as is the reference to ‘section 1225(b),’ while the \nreference to ‘determinations’ is in the plural.”  2019 WL 3536334, at *19 n.12. \nDefendant’s best argument in this regard is the fact that section 1252(e) itself is  \nentitled “[j]udicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e).  \nBut this language cannot be read to mean that judicial review is limited to challenges \nthat pertain to expedited removal determinations when, within that very provision, \nCongress says in no uncertain terms judicial review is also available for challenges to \nthe “implementation” of section 1225(b)(1).  Id. § 1252(e)(3)(A); see also O.A, 2019 \nWL 3536334, at *19 (rejecting argument that section 1252(e) limited the court’s \njurisdiction to cases in which DHS has issued a final expedited-removal order).  Along \nthese same lines, Defendants have not explained how the being-in-expedited-removal-\nproceedings prerequisite that they insist lurks in the interstices of the provisions of \nsection 1252 could have been overlooked by Congress when it spelled out in \nconsiderable detail the exact circumstances under which the federal district court in the \nDistrict of Columbia may consider (and the appellate courts may review) a challenge to \nthe implementation of section 1225(b)(1).  Defendants also fail to say how the removal-\norder requirement jibes with Congress’s unambiguous mandate that any legal action \nchallenging the “section, regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure” must be filed in \n38 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 41 of 126\ncourt “no later than 60 days after the date” such provision or practice “is first \nimplemented.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B); see also O.A., 2019 WL 3536334, at *19 \n(noting that the “suggestion that review is nonetheless unavailable unless and until \n[DHS] makes a final determination of expedited removal is both unsupported by the text \nand at odds with the fact that a challenge must be brought within sixty days of the ‘first \nimplement[ation]’ of a challenged regulation[.]” (second alteration in original) (citing \nAm. Immigr. Laws. Ass’n v. Reno, 199 F.3d at 1354)).\nPerhaps most importantly for present purposes, Defendants have offered no \nreason why Congress would possibly have predicated this Court’s jurisdiction to review \nclaims regarding the implementation of the expedited removal scheme (which the INA \nexplicitly references and expressly preserves) on the existence of a determination that \nan individual be subject to expedited removal procedures, and this unanswered inquiry \nis especially mysterious given that the INA restricts the exercise of federal court \njurisdiction to review the propriety of individual expedited removal determinations.  \nSee, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i).  In other words, does it make any sense that a \nCongress that would take care to carve out and preserve implementation challenges, as \ndistinguished from challenges to individual determinations regarding removal, would \nthen implicitly tether these two types of claims together, by making implementation\nchallenges available only if brought by a person who has received an individualized \nexpedited-removal determination that cannot itself be challenged unless he can \nplausibly claim that his own determination is unconstitutional or unlawful (as opposed \nto merely imprudent or wrong)?  To agree with Defendants’ reading of section \n1252(e)(3), one would have to assume that Congress intended to erect a virtually \n39 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 42 of 126\nunscalable threshold barrier to this Court’s power to consider claims that its statute \nplainly authorizes—a set of circumstances that this Court finds highly unlikely. \nNor can Defendants rely on American Immigration Lawyers Association v. Reno\n(hereinafter referred to as “AILA”), 199 F.3d 1352 (D.C. Cir. 2000), to propel this \njurisdictional argument forward.  To be sure, the D.C. Circuit did state in that case that \n“Congress meant to allow litigation challenging the [expedited removal] system by, and \nonly by, aliens against whom the new procedures had been applied.”  Id. at 1360; (see \nalso Defs.’ Opp’n at 18.)  But that statement was made in the specific context of an \nanalysis of whether or not the plaintiff organizations in that case could assert third-\nparty standing on behalf of “unnamed aliens who were or might be subject to \n[expedited removal][.]”  AILA, 199 F.3d at 1357.  The panel was particularly focused on \nthe broad “sweep” of those plaintiffs’ proposition that they had standing to represent \n“nearly all aliens anywhere in the world who have tried or will try to enter the United \nStates[,]” id. at 1359, and in analyzing that question, the court searched for “signs” in \nsection 1252 regarding what Congress meant to authorize, id., and came away with “the \ndistinct impression” that Congress did not intend to override the traditional presumption \nagainst third-party standing, id. at 1360; see also id. at 1357 (“[O]ne of the judicially \nself-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the general prohibition on a \nlitigant’s raising another person’s legal rights.” (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted)).  Thus, AILA does not speak to the question before this Court, which is \nwhether the provision of the INA that authorizes challenges to the validity of the \nexpedited removal system permits the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \nto exercise jurisdiction over challenges to the implementation of section 1225(b)’s \n40 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 43 of 126\nexpedited removal process, even if the plaintiff has not been placed in expedited \nremoval proceedings under section 1225(b)(1).15 And in this Court’s view, section \n1252 undoubtedly reflects Congress’s intent to preserve the subject-matter jurisdiction \nof at least one federal district court (the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia) to review challenges to the implementation of the expedited removal\nprocess; challenges that necessarily extend beyond mere claims regarding an expedited \nremoval determination.  \nDefendants’ other tack on the jurisdictional waters is an attempt to invoke \nsection 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the INA as the statutory provision that bars this Court’s \nsubject-matter jurisdiction under the circumstances presented here.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 34–35.)  This approach fares no better.  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) states in relevant \npart that, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or \nnonstatutory), . . . and regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made \nin removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to review” any “decision or \naction of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for \nwhich is specified under this subchapter to be in the[ir] discretion.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  At first glance, one might think that this provision obviously \nprecludes this Court’s exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA \nclaims, because section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the INA grants the Attorney General “the \nsole and unreviewable discretion” to designate the classes of non-citizens subject to \nexpedited removal, within the limits that Congress has established.  Id. \n \n15\nNot only is AILA inapposite as far as this jurisdictional question is concerned, given that it was \nissued in 2000—which “was like a million years ago in terms of standing jurisprudence” (AM Hr’g Tr. \n78:18–20)—it most certainly also fails to capture the current state of the law with respect to Article III \nstanding. \n41 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 44 of 126\n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  But recall that section 1252(a)(2)(B) is the second of four \ncategories of “[m]atters not subject to judicial review” that are laid out in the INA’s \njudicial review provision (see supra Part II.C), and the first category—section \n1252(a)(2)(A)—is the one that expressly relates to Plaintiffs’ challenges to the \nexpedited removal process.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A) (entitled “[r]eview relating to \nsection 1225(b)(1)”).   \nWhat is more, section 1252(a)(2)(B) relates to judicial review of “[d]enials of \ndiscretionary relief[,]” id. § 1252(a)(2)(B), and nothing about Plaintiffs’ claims \nchallenges relief at all, much less discretionary relief or denials thereof.  Plaintiffs do \nnot even attempt to challenge DHS’s new “designation,” i.e., “the decision as to what \ncategories of noncitizens will be subject to expedited removal.”  (Pls.’ Reply at 18.)  \nRather, Plaintiffs claim that “the manner in which Defendants [have] implement[ed] the \ndesignation decision, including the process by which that designation [was] made, as \nwell as the manner in which Defendants [have] implement[ed] the expedited removal \nstatute through written rules and policies that set out the procedures that apply in \nexpedited removal proceedings” is unlawful.  (Id. (emphasis in original).)  And as the \nCourt will explain below (see infra Part V.A.2.b), it appears that the requirement that \nDHS proceed through notice-and-comment rulemaking, as well as the requirement that \nthe agency’s decision making be reasoned, are not within the agency’s discretion, even \nif the final designation can be determined by DHS in its “sole and unreviewable \ndiscretion[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).\nTherefore, Defendants are hard pressed to maintain that section 1252(a)(2)(B) \nprevents this Court from exercising jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA claims.  See \n42 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 45 of 126\nHeredia Mons v. McAleenan, Civ. No. 19-1593 (JEB), 2019 WL 4225322, at *4 (D.D.C. \nSept. 5, 2019) (“Where plaintiffs challenge an overarching agency action as \nunlawful[,] . . . Supreme Court and Circuit precedent dictate that such a challenge does \nnot fall within § 1252’s jurisdictional bar.” (citing Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, \n688 (2001); R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 176–77 (D.D.C. 2015)).16 \nb. It is likely that Plaintiffs have associational standing\nDefendants’ arguments concerning Plaintiffs’ lack of Article III standing to bring \nthe APA claims at issue here fail for similar reasons.  To begin, the Court recognizes \nthat Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing that they have standing to sue, see Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561; and, for present purposes, Plaintiffs assert that they “have \nassociational” standing to pursue this legal action.  (Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 5.)  In order to \ndemonstrate associational standing, an organization must show that: “(a) its members \nwould otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to \nprotect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor \nthe relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  \nAm. Chem. Council v. Dep’t of Transp., 468 F.3d 810, 815 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).  Moreover, to satisfy the first prong of this \nassociational standing test, Plaintiffs must show that they have “at least one member” \nwho has suffered, or imminently will suffer, an injury-in-fact, meaning an injury that is \n \n16 Defendants also argue that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ claims \nbecause Plaintiffs “necessarily also challenge the existing regulations and policies implementing \nexpedited removal themselves, because [Plaintiffs’] APA and due process claims assert that those \nregulations provide insufficient process to safeguard Plaintiffs’ putative members’ alleged due process \nrights” (Defs.’ Opp’n at 35 (emphasis altered) (citing Pls.’ Mem. at 34–47)), and the Court is time-\nbarred from considering those claims (see id.); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B).  Because the Court \ndoes not address Plaintiffs’ due-process and due-process-related claims in this Opinion, it similarly \ndoes not address Defendants’ jurisdictional argument with respect to those claims. \n43 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 46 of 126\n(1) “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or \nhypothetical”; (2) “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant”; and (3) \n“likely, as opposed to merely speculative, . . . [to] be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Food & Water \nWatch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 914 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  In this Court’s view, \nPlaintiffs are likely to be able to satisfy these associational standing requirements for \nseveral reasons.   \nFirst, Plaintiffs have offered evidence that demonstrates that some of their \nmembers would probably have standing in their own right.  Plaintiff Make the Road \nNew York, for example, has provided sworn declarations (including affidavits from \nthree pseudonymous members), and based on these statements, asserts that “at least \nthree members . . . could be placed in expedited removal proceedings pursuant to the \n[July 23rd] Rule, because they entered without inspection, and have been continuously \npresent in the United States for less than two years.”  (Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 6; see also, \ne.g., Exs. 1–3 to Pls.’ Reply, ECF Nos. 28-2, 28-3, 28-4 (declarations of pseudonymous \nmembers).)  Thus, Plaintiffs have shown that at least one identified member faces an \ninjury that is “concerted and particularized[,]” Am. Chem. Council, 468 F.3d at 815 \n(internal quotation marks omitted)—i.e., (a) the member could be placed in expedited \nremoval, rather than the traditional removal proceedings that would otherwise have \nbeen required and that would have afforded the individual significantly more procedural \nsafeguards; (b) the injury is “fairly traceable to the challenged action of the \ndefendant[s][,]” id. (internal quotation marks omitted), i.e., that the member could not \nhave been subject to expedited removal had the agency not issued the July 23rd \n44 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 47 of 126\ndesignation; and (c) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable opinion, i.e., that \nif the Court finds the July 23rd designation invalid, the member could not be subjected \nto expedited removal.17   \nWith respect to whether these individual members’ alleged injury is “actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical[,]” id. (internal quotation marks omitted), this \nCourt concludes, at least preliminarily, that it is.  Being deprived of the procedural \nprotections that would otherwise be available prior to a consequential determination \nsuch as removal from the United States is a recognized harm, so long as the plaintiff \n“show[s] that ‘the procedures in question are designed to protect some threatened \nconcrete interest of his that is the ultimate basis of his standing.’” Ctr. for Law & \nEduc. v. Dep’t of Educ., 396 F.3d 1152, 1157 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (emphasis omitted) \n(quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573 n.8).  And while none of Plaintiffs’ members have \nalready been placed into the expedited removal process pursuant to the July 23rd Notice \n—to date, apparently no individuals have been so treated (see Joint Statement \nConcerning the Court’s Sept. 6, 2019 Min. Order (“Joint Statement”), ECF No. 31, at \n2)—Plaintiffs’ members plainly face sufficiently imminent injury to have Article III \nstanding.  This is because, by its own terms, the July 23rd Notice publicly authorized \nimmigration officers to subject undocumented non-citizens who are apprehended \n \n17 Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs cannot establish associational standing without identifying the \nallegedly injured members by name.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 38 (“[Plaintiffs] fail to identify the alleged \ninjured members ‘by name’ or ‘allege facts sufficient to establish harm to those members.’” (quoting \nAm. Immigration Laws. Ass’n, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 51 (alterations omitted)).)  Not so.  See, e.g., NAACP \nv. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 225 & n.10 (D.D.C. 2018).  And, once again, Defendants quote a D.C. \nCircuit case out of context.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 38 (“This requires showing that at least ‘one \nspecifically-identified member has suffered an injury-in-fact.’” (emphasis in original) (quoting Am. \nChem. Council, 468 F.3d at 820).)  Plaintiffs have specifically identified at least three members who \naver that they are within the category of persons to whom the July 23rd Notice is directed, and that they \nwill be injured if that new policy is enforced anytime soon.  The Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have \nmet their burden of identifying members who likely meet the standing criteria. \n45 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 48 of 126\nanywhere in the United States and have been present here for two years or less to \nexpedited removal “effective immediately,” 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,410, and in the context \nof this litigation, DHS has repeatedly represented that the agency’s enforcement of \nthese newly expanded expedited removal procedures would begin as early as September \n1, 2019 (see, e.g., Teleconf. Tr., ECF No. 22, at 3:7–8 (“[T]hey intend to deport \nbeginning September 1st.”)).18  DHS has also vigorously maintained that there was \nsimply not enough time for the agency to adhere to the APA’s notice-and-comment \nprocedures prior to the adoption of the New Designation, given the pressing need for \nswift application of this new policy.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 49–50); see also 84 Fed. Reg. \nat 35,413 (implying that, given the state of affairs at the border, DHS needs to begin \nenforcing the New Designation policy immediately).  It is well established that, with \nrespect to Article III standing, “threatened” agency action in the form of an announced \npolicy change must be taken just as seriously as already-completed injury, “because \nadministrative action, like arrest or prosecution, may give rise to harm sufficient to \njustify pre-enforcement review.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 165 \n(2014).  Thus, this Court finds that DHS’s own words and actions are likely to be \nsufficient to support Plaintiffs’ argument that there now exists a substantial threat of \nimminent harm to their members.   \nDHS’s only retort is to point to platitudes plucked from cases and to suggest \ngenerally that a plaintiff’s injuries cannot be speculative.  (See, e.g., Defs.’ Opp’n at 39 \n(“‘It is not enough for the [organization] to assert that it [or its members] might suffer \nan injury in the future, or even that it is likely to suffer an injury at some unknown \n \n18 DHS has since stated that it would start enforcing the new designation as soon as September 27, \n2019.  (See Joint Statement at 2.) \n46 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 49 of 126\nfuture time.  Such “someday” injuries are insufficient.’” (alterations and emphasis in \noriginal) (quoting J. Roderick MacArthur Found. v. FBI, 102 F.3d 600, 606 (D.C. Cir. \n1996))); id. at 40 (“‘[P]otentially’ does not mean ‘certainly impending,’ and it certainly \ndoes not mean that Plaintiffs’ Doe members will be placed in expedited removal.”  \n(quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013))).) But there is \nnothing speculative about a threatened injury if the one who makes the threat \nsimultaneously and unequivocally states that he intends to inflict the threatened harm as \nsoon as possible and without further warning.  And that, in effect, is precisely what \nDHS has done, even as it now maintains that there is no imminent risk of harm.  In this \ncontext, DHS cannot expect to have its cake (by purposefully threatening to subject \nsettled undocumented non-citizens to expedited removal in a manner that elicits \nwidespread fear) without eating it, when representatives of the targeted individuals seek \naccess to the courts on the grounds that their members are afraid.  (See Pls.’ Reply at 43 \n(“Defendants’ position is illogical; they cannot implement a wide-ranging and \naggressive policy but nevertheless claim that individuals subject to that policy are not at \nrisk.”).) \nIt is also clear that, as a matter of law, a plaintiff need not even show that harm \nis “certainly impending” to establish Article III standing; she “may instead show a \n‘substantial risk’ that the anticipated harm will occur.”  N.Y. Republican State Comm. v. \nSEC, 927 F.3d 499, 504 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (citing Susan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at\n158).  The D.C. Circuit has affirmed that “the proper way to analyze an increased-risk-\nof-harm claim is to consider the ultimate alleged harm . . . as the concrete and \nparticularized injury and then to determine whether the increased risk of such harm \n47 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 50 of 126\nmakes injury to an individual citizen sufficiently ‘imminent’ for standing purposes.”\nId. (ellipsis in original) (quoting Attias v. Carefirst, Inc., 865 F.3d 620, 627 (D.C. Cir. \n2017)); cf. Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019) (finding that \n“the predictable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties” was \nsufficient to establish standing).  Moreover, the series of events that failed to persuade \nthe Supreme Court that the plaintiffs in Clapper v. Amnesty International USA faced \nsuch imminent injury involved “a series of independent actors, including intelligence\nofficials and Article III judges, [exercising] their independent judgment in a specific \nway.”  Attias, 865 F.3d at 628.  Here, on the other hand, DHS alone made the New \nDesignation effective as of July 23, 2019, see 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,410, and no other \nindependent policymakers need to take any action in order for the feared injury to be \ninflicted on the undocumented non-citizens to whom the new policy might apply.  Thus, \nDefendants’ contention that the July 23rd Notice does not pose a “substantial risk” of \nharm to Plaintiffs’ identified members is untenable. \nAs a final note, there seems to be agreement that Plaintiffs have a high likelihood \nof establishing that they have they have satisfied the other associational standing \ncriteria, given that Defendants do not appear to dispute that the interests Plaintiffs seek \nto protect are germane to the organizations’ purposes, or that this matter does not \nrequire individual members’ participation.  (See Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 10–11.)  Thus, based \non its finding that Plaintiffs are likely to be able to establish that at least one identified \nindividual member would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right for the \nreasons just explained, this Court concludes that Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood \n48 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 51 of 126\nof being able to demonstrate associational standing.  See Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr., 928 \nF.3d at 104.\n2. Plaintiffs Are Likely To Be Able To Establish That The APA \nProvides A Cause Of Action For Their Claims That DHS Has \nCommitted Procedural Violations\nTurning to another potential impediment to Plaintiffs’ success with respect to the \nclaims it has brought in this Court, the Court notes that any plaintiff must have a cause \nof action (i.e., legal authorization to pursue the claim he brings), and this requirement \nimplicates a different set of issues than the question of whether the Court has subject-\nmatter over each such claim.  See, e.g., Brown v. FEC, 386 F. Supp. 3d 16, 28 (D.D.C. \n2018) (concluding that plaintiffs were “unlikely to succeed on the merits of” a count \nthat “contains no discernible cause of action”); see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a \nBetter Envt., 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998) (“It is firmly established in our cases that the \nabsence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-\nmatter jurisdiction.”).  In the instant case, Plaintiffs appear to maintain that both the \nINA and the APA provide a cause of action that Plaintiffs can rely upon with respect to \ntheir procedural challenges to the July 23rd Designation.  (See, e.g., Pls.’ Reply at 18–\n21.)  And it is true that, as a general matter, under the APA, any person “adversely \naffected or aggrieved” by agency action has a statutory right to seek “judicial review” \nof that agency decision.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  But it is also clear that “‘if an adequate \nremedy at law exists’ for the agency action about which the plaintiff complains, then \n‘equitable relief is not available under the APA.’”  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. \nDep’t of Agric., 130 F. Supp. 3d 356, 378 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Cohen v. United \nStates, 650 F.3d 717, 731 (D.C. Cir. 2011); see also 5 U.S.C. § 704 (“Agency action \n49 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 52 of 126\nmade reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court are subject to judicial review.”).  \nThus, if the INA provides a cause of action with respect to Plaintiffs’ claims, \nthen the APA cannot also provide a cause of action, as Plaintiffs have suggested.  (See, \ne.g., Pls.’ Reply at 20–21.)19 Furthermore, even when the APA provides the only \nremedy and thus might otherwise apply, that statute contains an exception, such that the \nAPA will not be deemed to provide a cause of action to challenge agency decisions that \nhave been “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); see also \nOryszak, 576 F.3d at 526 (holding that “the APA provides no cause of action” for the \ncourt to review an agency determination that has been committed to agency discretion \nby law).   \nConsequently, whether or not the INA provides a cause of action for the \nprocedural claims that Plaintiffs bring here, and whether or not Plaintiffs’ claims \nconcern matters that are “committed to agency discretion by law” and thus do not give \nrise to a cause of action under the APA, are crucial threshold questions that might well \nextinguish Plaintiffs’ likelihood of being able to succeed on their claims that DHS has \nengaged in unlawful action in violation of the APA.  The Court has examined these \npossibilities, and concludes for the following reasons that the APA’s authorization to \n \n19 To be fair, Plaintiffs have provided mixed messages regarding their position as to whether or not the \nINA’s “[s]ection 1252(e)(3) . . . provid[es] a specific cause of action for injunctive relief for Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.”  (Pls.’ Reply at 20–21 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)).)  In Plaintiffs’ briefs and during the \nmotion hearing, Plaintiffs’ counsel stated that section 1252(e)(3) “does specifically provide \nfor . . . review of certain types of claims and, as such, is a cause of action.”  (AM Hr’g Tr. at 10:23–\n25.)  But, later, counsel clarified that the INA provides the cause of action only for Plaintiffs’ “second \nand . . . fourth claims” (id. at 12:1–2; see also id. at 12:20–24)—i.e., Plaintiffs’ claims that the July \n23rd designation violates either the substantive requirements of the Due Process Clause or the INA (see \nPls.’ Mem. at 32–47), and that the July 23rd designation violates the right to counsel under the INA \n(see id. at 49–52).  Thus, at this point, Plaintiffs may be relying solely on the APA for the cause of \naction for their notice-and-comment and arbitrary-and-capricious claims.  (See AM Hr’g Tr. at 13:6–8.) \n50 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 53 of 126\nbring a claim against an administrative agency on the grounds that the agency has \ncommitted procedural violations of the type the APA prohibits is a cause of action this \nis likely to be deemed available to these Plaintiffs.\na.  It is unlikely that the INA provides a cause of action for \nPlaintiffs’ procedural claims \nTo start, it is significant that the text of the INA does not prescribe particular  \nprocedural requirements for the Attorney General (or his assignees) to follow when he \nexercises his discretion to designate the categories of persons who will be subject to \nexpedited removal pursuant to the INA’s section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii), nor does that \nstatute explicitly provide aggrieved persons with the opportunity to police the \ngovernment’s conduct in this regard by filing an action in court.  Yet, section \n1252(e)(3) does make a legal action “available” if a plaintiff maintains that the \n“implementation” of the expedited removal process is unconstitutional or unlawful.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  In this Court’s view, rather than providing plaintiffs with a \ncause of action to challenge the government’s implementation of the expedited removal \nsystem, section 1252(e)(3), read in conjunction with section 1252(a)(2), is doing the \nwork of clarifying that, despite the severely restricted scope of jurisdiction to consider \nclaims involving expedited removal that the INA imposes, the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia is still open for business as far as implementation \nclaims that allege a violation of the Constitution or other laws are concerned.  This \nCourt has previously expressed its skepticism about whether section 1252(e)(3) confers \njurisdiction on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or any other federal \ncourt.  (See, supra, Part V.A.1.a.)  Here, the Court observes that the text of section \n1252(e)(3) also raises doubts about whether Congress intended to authorize plaintiffs \n51 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 54 of 126\nwho have implementation challenges to utilize that statute to bring claims, particularly \nclaims for which there is no other authorization.  \nThe first clue that section 1252(e)(3) is merely clearing a path for this Court’s \nreview of existing legal claims, rather than crafting a new cause of action, is the \nlanguage that Congress has used; indeed, typically, a statute that creates a cause of \naction expressly confers upon an aggrieved party the right to bring an action in court to \nchallenge specified conduct.  See Lee v. USAID, 859 F.3d 74, 77 (D.C. Cir. 2017); see, \ne.g, 5 U.S.C. § 702 (“A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or \nadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” (emphasis added)); 8 U.S.C. § 1503 (“If \nany person who is within the United States claims a right or privilege as a national of \nthe United States and is denied such right or privilege by any department or \nindependent agency, or official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the \nUnited States, such person may institute an action[.]” (emphasis added)).  Not so here: \nthe most Congress has mustered is the statement that judicial review of the \nimplementation of the expedited removal system is “available,” which is hardly the type \nof ringing endorsement of legal action that courts have generally required as indicative \nof a statute that confers on plaintiffs the right to be in federal court.  See O.A., 2019 WL \n3536334, at *18 (“[Defendants] fail to identify any feature of § 1252(e)(3) suggesting \nthat it provides a cause of action, much less an exclusive cause of action for claims \nbrought challenging implementation of the expedited removal statute.”); cf. Holloway v. \nBristol-Myers Corp., 485 F.2d 986, 988–89 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (noting, with respect to the \nFTC Act, that “[t]he Act nowhere purports to confer upon private individuals, either \n52 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 55 of 126\nconsumers or business competitors, a right of action to enjoin the practice prohibited by \nthe Act or to obtain damages following the commission of such acts”).  And, indeed, “in \nthose cases finding . . . implied private remedies, the statute in question at least \nprohibited certain conduct or created federal rights in favor of private parties.”  Touche \nRoss & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 569 (1979) (collecting cases).  Section \n1252(e)(3) “neither confers rights on private parties nor proscribes any conduct as \nunlawful.”  Id. \nSecond, the breadth of the potential legal claims that might be brought due to the \navailability of a right to challenge the implementation of expedited removal system as \nviolative of “the law” under section 1252(e)(3) is staggering, and that, too, cuts against \ninterpreting that statutory provision as creating a cause of action in and of itself.  A \ncomplex administrative program can violate provisions of law in innumerable ways, \nonly some of which Congress may have intended to give rise to a legal action in federal \ncourt.  Cf. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan, No. 18-cv-655, 2019 WL \n4228362, at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 4, 2019) (explaining that, in another part of the IIRIRA, \nCongress’s use of the phrase “all law” rather than “all legal requirements” as it relates \nto the DHS Secretary’s waiver authority clarified the legislature’s intent to permit the \nagency to address “any local, state[,] or federal statute, regulation, or administrative \norder that could impede expeditious construction of border security infrastructure’” \n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  This Court finds it \nhighly unlikely that, through the enactment of section 1252(e)(3), Congress’s intent was \nto create a vehicle for this Court’s review of any and all claimed violations of any and \nall legal provisions that might relate to the implementation of the INA’s expedited \n53 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 56 of 126\nremoval process.  Moreover, at the very least, reading section 1252(e) to open the door \nto all sorts of challenges based on any potentially violative conduct cuts against the \nprimary thrust of the INA’s judicial review provision, which is indisputably to limit, \nrather than expand, the number and nature of the attacks that can be launched against \nthe expedited removal process. \nThird, and similarly, with the possible exception of an ultra vires claim, it is not \nat all clear that Congress envisioned allowing plaintiffs to bring challenges to the \nvalidity of the expedited removal system pursuant to section 1252(e)(3) if such \nchallenges are not of the type that could otherwise have been made to enforce the \nprovisions of law that the defendant has allegedly violated.  Section 1252(e)(3)(ii) \nplainly permits a plaintiff to claim that DHS’s implementation of the expedited removal \nprocess is “not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter” (i.e., is ultra \nvires) or “is otherwise in violation of law.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(ii).  The question is \nwhether, through this language, Congress sought to permit plaintiffs to police DHS’s \ncompliance with the universe of potentially applicable legal requirements under \ncircumstances in which there would have otherwise been no relief with respect to that \nviolation?  This Court finds that doubtful.  Cf. Inst. for Truth & Marketing v. Total \nHealth Network Corp., 321 F. Supp. 3d 76, 86 (explaining that “[t]he fact that Congress \ndid not provide a federal cause of action for violations of the FTC Act in the first place \nstrongly suggests that Congress did not believe that this federal issue was substantial \nenough in the context of the federal system to authorize private claims of this type to be \nadjudicated in a federal forum.”)  And it is also, quite frankly, impractical to view the \nINA as establishing a cause of action for claims relating to the designation of categories \n54 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 57 of 126\nof person subject to expedited removal under section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii), because that \nstatute itself does not establish standards that govern DHS’s exercise of its discretion to \nmake such designations.  So, if section 1252(e)(3)’s judicial review provision is \ninterpreted to create a cause of action for the claims that Plaintiffs bring, what \nsubstantive standards is this Court to use to determine whether DHS has committed an \nactionable violation?  \nThe takeaway is that this Court finds it highly unlikely that the INA itself \nprovides a cause of action for judicial relief with respect to a claim that DHS has \nimplemented the expedited removal process in violation of the law.20 In this Court’s \nview, both the substantive standards for making any such claim, and the authorization \nfor seeking to enforce those substantive standards, must come from elsewhere.  Luckily \nfor Plaintiffs, the procedural standards that an agency must use, as well as the \nauthorization for Plaintiffs to sue to enforce them, are present in the APA.  See Block v. \nCmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 345 (1984) (explaining that, among other things, \n“[t]he APA confers a general cause of action upon persons ‘adversely affected or \naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute’” (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n \n20 The possible exception to this is a plaintiff’s claim that an implementation action “is not consistent \nwith [the] applicable provisions of [the INA],” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(ii), which, of course, necessarily \nrelates to the substantive standards that the INA itself prescribes.  Arguably, however, the claim that \nDHS has violated provisions of the INA does not need, and does not rely upon, an authorization to \npursue relief that is embedded in the statute; instead, the authority to bring a claim of that nature exists, \npresumptively, with respect to every statute that confers guided discretion upon agency actors.  See \nAdamski v. McHugh, 304 F. Supp. 3d 227, 236–37 (D.D.C. 2015) (describing “ultra vires claim that can \nbe brought in federal court ‘[i]f a plaintiff is unable to bring his case predicated on either a specific or \na general statutory review provision[,]’” and explaining that “this type of ultra vires claim derives from \nthe contention that the agency has acted without the authority to do so” (first alteration in original) \n(quoting Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1327 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).  In any event, \nhere, Plaintiffs are generally maintaining that their claims concerning the notice-and-comment and \narbitrariness violations that DHS allegedly committed with respect to its July 23rd Notice can proceed \ndespite the restrictions in the INA because the agency has acted “otherwise in violation of law.”  (See \nPls.’ Mem. at 13 (explaining that “[t]he July 23 Rule is illegal[,]” in part because it violates the APA).       \n55 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 58 of 126\n§ 702)); see also North Am.’s Bldg. Trade Unions v. OSHA, 878 F.3d 271, 282 (D.C. \nCir. 2017) (“The APA governs the procedural challenge to ensure the Rule is not \npromulgated “without observance of procedure required by law.” (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(D)); Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, 541 F.2d 1, 34 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A) as governing arbitrary-and-capricious review). \nb.  It is unlikely that the INA commits to agency discretion the \nprocess by which the section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) expedited \nremoval designation is to be determined\nThat all said, what the APA giveth, it can also taketh away.  Indeed, it is well \nestablished that “[t]he APA confers a general cause of action upon persons ‘adversely \naffected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,’ but \nwithdraws that cause of action to the extent the relevant statute ‘preclude[s] judicial \nreview[.]’”  Block, 467 U.S. at 340 (emphasis added) (second alteration in original) \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 701(a)(1)).  And, thus, we arrive at Defendants’ primary \nargument with respect to the key question of whether the APA even applies to the \nmatter at hand:  Defendants insist that Plaintiffs have no cause of action to pursue their \nAPA claims in this Court, because the Acting DHS Secretary’s July 23rd designation \nwas an “agency action . . . committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2); (see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 41–43).  \nTo support this contention, Defendants rely primarily if not exclusively on the \nlanguage of the INA’s section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I), which does provide DHS with the \n“sole and unreviewable discretion” to designate which categories of undocumented non-\ncitizens will be subject to expedited removal (within the outer limits that Congress has \nset), and further states that any such designation “may be modified at any time.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).  Defendants take this statutory authorization to mean \n56 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 59 of 126\nthat the DHS Secretary can make any determination that he wants to with respect to the \nsection 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) designation, and that there are no “meaningful standards” for \nthis Court to apply when it is asked to determine whether the agency’s implementation \nof its discretion is unlawful.  But it is more likely that Congress intended to confer to \nthe agency the ultimate authority to make the decision of who will be subject to \nexpedited removal under the statute, which is not the same thing as giving the agency \nsole discretion to determine the manner in which that decision will be made.  Moreover, \ndistinguishing between substance and procedure in this manner is entirely consistent \nwith Congress’s ordinary practices when it sets outer boundaries and gives an \nadministrative agency authority to fill in the details.  See, e.g., Nat’l Ass’n of Clean \nWater Agencies v. EPA, 734 F.3d 1115, 1147–48 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (ruling that \nEnvironmental Protection Agency’s rulemaking was procedurally flawed in context of \nsetting emissions standards under 42 U.S.C. § 7429(a)(2), in which Congress set floor \nbut afforded agency broad discretion otherwise); 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(4) (requiring that \nthe Food and Drug Administration proceed through notice-and-comment rulemaking if \nit opts to depart from any maximum residue level for a pesticide chemical established \nby the Codex Alimentarius Commission).  \n  So it is here.  In the text of the INA, Congress specifies, inter alia, that an \nimmigration officer “shall order [an] alien removed from the United States without \nfurther hearing or review” upon determining that said “alien” is a person “described in \nclause (iii)” and is “inadmissible.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  Clause (iii) both \ndelegates to the agency the “sole and unreviewable” discretion to designate the \ncategories of aliens who fit these circumstances that will be subjected to expedited \n57 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 60 of 126\nremoval, id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I), and also establishes the outside parameters within \nwhich this designation determination must be made, see id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) \n(“An alien described in this clause is an alien . . . who has not been admitted or paroled \ninto the United States, and who has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an \nimmigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States \ncontinuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of \ninadmissibility under this subparagraph.”).  Nothing in this statute speaks to how the \nagency is to reach its conclusion regarding the category of aliens to which expedited \nremoval will apply; moreover, and significantly for present purposes, nothing in the \nstatute relieves the agency from its obligation to make that discretionary decision in the \nordinary course, consistent with any otherwise applicable procedural requirements.  \nIndeed, Congress was undoubtedly aware of the APA’s procedural mandates when it \npenned the amendments to the INA that gave birth to the expedited removal process, yet \nit was silent about whether or not the agency had a duty to make the discretionary \nsection 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) designation determination after providing public notice and \nreceiving comment, and whether or not the agency had to engage in reasoned decision \nmaking to select the categories of persons who would be subject to expedited removal \nunder the statute.  In this Court’s view, it is also quite telling that Congress did not\nstand idly by with respect to the prospect that the agency might be held to account for \nflaws in the implementation of the expedited removal system; to the contrary, it \nexpressly allowed for review of such challenges under section 1252(e)(3).  Thus, \ninsofar as Plaintiffs here are claiming that “the manner in which Defendants implement \nthe designation decision, including the process by which that designation is made” is \n58 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 61 of 126\nunlawful (Pls.’ Reply at 18 (emphasis in original)), there is nothing in the INA that \ndemonstrates that Congress intended to commit that matter to the agency’s discretion, \nand in fact, the language of section 1252(e)(3) appears to leave the door wide open for \n“[j]udicial review of . . . section 1225(b)[’s] . . . implementation[.]”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3). \nNotably, this analysis of Defendants’ “committed to agency discretion” argument \nis entirely consistent with binding precedent about how that exception to APA review \nmust be interpreted.  “To give effect to § 706(2)(A) and to honor the presumption of \nreview, [the Supreme Court] ha[s] read the exception in § 701(a)(2) quite narrowly, \nrestricting it to ‘those rare circumstances where the relevant statute is drawn so that a \ncourt would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise \nof discretion.’”  Weyerhaeuser Co., 139 S. Ct. at 370 (quoting Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. \n182, 191 (1993)).  Indeed, “[t]he few cases in which [the Supreme Court] ha[s] applied \nthe § 701(a)(2) exception involved agency decisions that courts have traditionally \nregarded as unreviewable, such as the allocation of funds from a lump-sum \nappropriation, or a decision not to reconsider a final action.”  Id. (internal citations \nomitted).  Defendants struggle valiantly to shoehorn the instant case into this narrow \nframework (see Defs.’ Opp’n at 45 (arguing that Plaintiffs’ notice-and-comment claims \nare barred due to the “‘sole and unreviewable’ nature of the designation”), but doing so \nrequires them to distort Plaintiffs’ claims beyond all recognition (see, e.g., id. \n(characterizing Plaintiffs’ claims concerning substantive violations of the INA as \n“nothing more than a challenge how the Secretary chooses to implement his \ndiscretionary authority,” which, according to Defendants, is barred by language of \n59 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 62 of 126\nsection 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I)).  But, again, Plaintiffs’ core contention with respect to the \nAPA is that Acting DHS Secretary McAleenan failed to use the required procedures to \nimplement the expedited removal authority provided to him by Congress when the \nagency issued the July 23rd New Designation, not that the agency’s designation, in and \nof itself, was unlawful.  (See Pls.’ Reply at 18 (“Plaintiffs are not challenging the \n‘designation’ at all.”).)  And no one appears to dispute that there are procedural \nstandards established in the APA that address the process that an agency must follow \nwhen it undertakes its discretionary power to promulgate a rule.   \nThus, even if Congress has granted DHS broad discretion—and perhaps even the \n“most possible discretion[,]” as defense counsel insisted at the motion hearing (AM \nHr’g Tr. at 68:18)—to make the final section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) designation, due to the \nagency’s foreign policy chops or otherwise (see Defs.’ Opp’n at 42), that grant does not \nnecessarily carry with it the freedom to make the ultimate discretionary determination \nhowever the agency wants to (see AM Hr’g Tr. at 67:15–20 (Court explains that this \nmay be “a world in which discretion is conferred, and in so doing, Congress is saying \n[the agency] get[s] the final word. . . . [B]ut that does not necessarily indicate \nCongress’s intent to allow [the agency] to use a Ouija board[.]”); see also id. at 67:21–\n23 (“That the APA still applies as to how [the agency] make[s] that determination [is] \nnot inconsistent with language in which Congress says [the agency] get[s] to decide [the \nfinal policy].”).  Moreover, and similarly, the fact that an agency might well reach the \nsame conclusion about the ultimate discretionary issue if it makes the decision \nrandomly as it would have if it followed the necessary process is neither here nor there \nwhen it comes to deciding whether Congress intended for the APA’s procedures to be \n60 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 63 of 126\nfollowed.  (See id. at 61:13–17 (“The Ouija board can come up with the ultimate \ndecision that the agency also comes up with once [the agency] does the right \nprocedures.  But the APA says they’ve got to do the right procedures.  They can’t just \ndo it randomly.”).); cf. Pierce v. Dist. of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d 250, 271 (D.D.C. \n2015) (observing that “even a broken clock gets the time right twice a day” (citing \nCharles Clay Doyle et al., Dictionary of Modern Proverbs 287 (2012)).  In other words, \nwithout regard to Congress’s intent to vest an agency with unreviewable discretion to \nmake a substantive decision, it can also intend for the APA to apply to constrain an \nagency’s decision making process with respect to that entirely discretionary judgment \ncall, and when it does, an agency that fails to follow the mandated process risks having \nits policy decision “held unlawful and set aside” under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).21  \nThe cases that Defendants cite do not detract from this conclusion, for the very \nsimple reason that each of those cited authorities involves a challenge to the substantive \ndecision that the agency has made, and not to its decision making process.  See, e.g., \nGebhardt v. Nielsen, 879 F.3d 980, 984–85 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding that judicial review \nwas precluded with respect to the Secretary’s “‘sole and unreviewable discretion’ to \nmake ‘no risk’ determinations” under the Adam Walsh Act, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1154(a)(1)(A)(viii)(I)); Bremer v. Johnson, 834 F.3d 925, 930 (8th Cir. 2016) (same); \nBernardo ex rel. M & K Eng’g, Inc. v. Johnson, 814 F.3d 481, 484 (1st Cir. 2016) \n(finding that decision to revoke an individual’s visa petition “is discretionary, and so \nnot subject to judicial review”); Jilin Pharm. v. Chertoff, 447 F.3d 196, 203–04 (3d Cir. \n \n21 As this Court suggested at the outset, one might argue that Congress’s intent to constrain an agency’s \ndecision making process through application of the APA is an even more evident (and important) when \na statute simultaneously provides an agency with a substantial amount of discretion to make a \nconsequential policy determination.   \n61 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 64 of 126\n2006) (same); cf. Amgen, Inc. v. Smith, 357 F.3d 103, 112–13 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“[W]e \nconstrue [the relevant statutory provision] to prevent review only of those ‘other \nadjustments’ that the Medicare Act authorizes the Secretary to make; in other words, \nthe preclusion on review of ‘other adjustments’ extends no further than the Secretary’s \nstatutory authority to make them.”).  And DHS gets no additional traction from its \nobservation that Congress has authorized the agency to modify the discretionary \ndesignation regarding who will be subject to expedited removal “at any time.”  (Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 19, 42 (emphasis omitted) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)).)  This \nlanguage comes nowhere close to expressing clearly Congress’s intention to override \nthe presumptive applicability of the APA.  See Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 126, \n140 (1967), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977) \n(noting that the APA “embodies the basic presumption of judicial review to one \n‘suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by \nagency action within the meaning of a relevant statute,’ so long as no statute precludes \nsuch relief or the action is not one committed by law to agency discretion” (quoting 5 \nU.S.C. § 702; citing 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)). see also, e.g., Sackett v. EPA, 566 U.S. 120, \n129–30 (2012) (outlining cases in which the Supreme Court has ruled that statutes had \novercome the APA’s presumption of reviewability); Eagle Trust Fund v. USPS, 365 F. \nSupp. 3d 57, 64–65 (D.D.C. 2019) (“Congress has expressly exempted USPS actions \nfrom review under the APA, with limited exceptions.” (emphasis omitted) (citing 39 \nU.S.C. § 410(a))).   \nCongress’s “at any moment” reference could just as easily be construed to mean \nthat DHS can modify the section designation at any time after the enactment of the \n62 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 65 of 126\nIIRIRA in 1996, without additional authorization from Congress, rather than as an \nindication of Congress’s intent to authorize DHS to be able to change the designation at \na moment’s notice and without public input.  And, of course, even if Congress intended \nthe moment’s-notice reading of “at any time,” that interpretation is not necessarily \ninconsistent with the APA’s application under the circumstances presented here, \nbecause the APA itself permits an agency to respond to changed circumstances \nquickly—without first engaging in notice and comment or similar procedures—when \nthere is “good cause” for doing so.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B); (see also infra Part V.3.b.) \nIn short, the key to understanding why Defendants’ cause-of-action argument \nfails is the recognition that Plaintiffs here are clearly claiming that the process that \nDHS employed to arrive at its conclusion that the Acting DHS Secretary should \nexercise his discretion to expand the expedited removal process to the fullest extent \nallowed by the law was fatally flawed under the standards laid out in the APA.  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 129–34 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 553, which requires agencies to employ notice-\nand-comment procedures when “[r]ule making”); id. ¶¶ 149–51 (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(a), which requires that courts “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, . . . or otherwise not in accordance with law”); Pls.’ Mem. at \n26–32 (arguing that DHS violated the APA by failing to engage in notice-and-comment \nrulemaking); id. at 47–49 (arguing that DHS violated the APA by implementing the July \n23rd Notice without “accounting for the serious procedural flaws” in the existing \nexpedited removal system).)  Given these claims, this Court finds it unlikely that the \nINA (which places the designation decision in the sole and exclusive purview of the \nagency, but says nothing about the process the agency employs to reach that \n63 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 66 of 126\nconclusion) commits the agencies’ decision making process to DHS’s discretion in a \nmanner that renders the APA’s procedural mandates inapplicable.  \nTo put a finer point on this conclusion, the Court offers the following concrete \nexample:  DHS might well be right that Congress intended to commit entirely to the \nagency the discretion to decide whether to expose to expedited removal undocumented \nnon-citizens who have been in the this country for, say, six months or less, versus 12 \nmonths or less, versus 18 months or less, and so on (up to the statutory limit of two \nyears).  And it is also true that there is no meaningful legal standard that this Court can \nemploy to determine whether the agency’s selection of six or 12 or 18 months as the \nrequired term of residence to avoid expedited removal constitutes a violation of the \nINA.  But the INA also plainly preserves this Court’s power to review a claim that \nDHS’s implementation of the expedited removal process is unlawful; therefore, the \nINA’s plain text unambiguously indicates that Congress did not intend to remove claims \nabout the manner in which DHS exercises its discretion entirely off the table of \npotential claims for relief that can be brought against the agency.  Moreover, as this \nCourt has already determined, the APA itself provides a fitting and available cause of \naction to bring such a procedural-violation claim in this Court.  See Delta Air Lines, \nInc. v. Export-Import Bank of the U.S., 718 F.3d 974, 977 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (per curiam) \n(noting that a ‘statute can confer on an agency a high degree of discretion, and yet a \ncourt might still have an obligation to review the agency’s exercise of its discretion to \navoid abuse,’ especially on procedural grounds” (quoting 3 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., \nAdministrative Law Treatise § 17.6 (4th ed. 2002)); cf. Nation v. Dalton, 107 F. Supp. \n2d 37, 42–43 (D.D.C. 2000) (“Because adjudication of plaintiff’s ‘claims requires the \n64 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 67 of 126\n[Court] to determine only whether the Secretary’s decision making process was \ndeficient, not whether his decision was correct,’ it would not require the Court to \nsubstitute its judgment for that of the Secretary in the sensitive area of military \npersonnel decisions.” (alteration in original) (quoting Kreis v. Sec’y of the Air Force, \n866 F.2d 1508, 1511–12 (D.C. Cir. 1989))).\n3. Plaintiffs Are Likely To Succeed On The Merits Of Their APA \nArguments\nThe Court has now concluded that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in establishing \nthat this Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the procedural claims they have \nbrought under the APA and also in demonstrating that they have associational standing. \n(See supra Part V.A.1)  It is also likely that the APA provides a cause of action for the \nprocedural violations that Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges, notwithstanding the fact that the \nINA commits the section 1225(b)(1) designation decision entirely to DHS’s discretion. \n(See supra Part V.A.2.)  This brings us to the heart of the claims that Plaintiffs are \nmaking in this action regarding the alleged impropriety of DHS’s decisionmaking \nprocess.  As explained above, Plaintiffs maintain that DHS failed to engage in required\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking before implementing the July 23rd Notice, in violation \nof the APA (see Compl. ¶¶ 129–34), and that the July 23rd Notice was adopted in an\narbitrary and capricious fashion, also in violation of the APA (see id. ¶¶ 149–51).  For \nthe purpose of the instant motion for a preliminary injunction, and given the well-worn \nprocedural standards that the APA establishes for the proper conduct of administrative \nagencies, this Court concludes that Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of these \nclaims.\n65 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 68 of 126\na. The APA requires that agencies seek public comment prior \nto rulemaking, and that they conduct their deliberations so \nas to minimize the risk of reaching arbitrary and capricious \nconclusions \nOne must be clear eyed about the particular duties that a statute imposes in order \nto evaluate properly the likelihood that a plaintiff will be able to demonstrate that the \ndefendant has breached those obligations, as a matter of fact and law.  To this end, here, \nit is important to understand that a key component of the Administrative Procedure Act\nis Congress’s requirement that an agency provide notice to the public, and an \nopportunity for members of the public to comment, prior to agency rulemaking \n(whether promulgation, amendment, modification, or repeal).  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–\n(c); see also Am. Hosp. Ass’n v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037, 1044 (D.C. Cir. 1987)\n(explaining that notice-and-comment requirements fulfill “policy goals of maximum \nparticipation and full information”).  Specifically, the APA generally requires that the \nagency publish “notice of proposed rulemaking . . . in the Federal Register,” and that \nsuch notice include “a statement of the time, place, and nature of public rule making \nproceedings”; “reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed”; and \n“either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and \nissues involved.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b), (b)(1)–(3).  Then, after publishing the notice of \nproposed rulemaking, “the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to \nparticipate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or \narguments[.]”  Id. § 553(c).  Furthermore, “[a]fter [its] consideration of the relevant \nmatter presented,” the APA directs that “the agency shall incorporate in the rules \nadopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.”  Id.; cf. Home Box \nOffice, Inc. v. FCC, 567 F.2d 9, 35–36 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (“[T]he opportunity to comment \n66 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 69 of 126\nis meaningless unless the agency responds to significant points raised by the public.”\n(citation omitted)). \nNotably, not every kind of action that an agency undertakes is subject to the \nAPA’s notice-and-comment requirements.  Indeed, the APA expressly exempts \n“interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, \nprocedure, or practice[.]”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  What is left (i.e., those rules that are \nnot exempted from notice and comment by section 553(b)(A)) are typically referred to \nas “substantive” or “legislative” rules.  See Clarian Health West, LLC v. Hargan, 878 \nF.3d 346, 356 (D.C. Cir. 2017); U.S. Tel. Ass’n v. FCC, 28 F.3d 1232, 1234 (D.C. Cir. \n1994).  The question of whether an agency action qualifies as a substantive rule that is \nrequired to proceed through notice-and-comment rulemaking is a pure question of law \nthat does not require any special “deference . . . to an agency’s characterization of its \nown rule.”  Clarian Health West, LLC v. Burwell, 206 F. Supp. 3d 393, 407 (D.D.C. \n2016), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Clarian Health West, LLC v. Hargan, 878 F.3d \n346 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (citations omitted); see also Am. Hosp. Ass’n, 834 F.2d at 1056 \n(“[W]e are not compelled to defer to agency characterizations of rules as ‘general \nstatements of policy[.]’”); Citizens to Save Spencer Cty. v. EPA, 600 F.2d 844, 879 \nn.171 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (finding that agency’s “characterizations of these rules as \ninterpretive . . . are of no avail”). \nEven when an agency promulgates a substantive rule that would otherwise be \nrequired to proceed through notice and comment, the APA does not require the agency \nto engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking “when the agency for good cause finds \n(and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefore in the rules \n67 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 70 of 126\nissued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or \ncontrary to the public interest.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B).  Notice-and-comment is \nconsidered “‘impracticable’ when an agency finds that due and timely execution of its \nfunctions would be impeded by the notice otherwise required in § 553,” Util. Solid \nWaste Activities Grp. v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 754 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (citation and \nalteration omitted), and notice-and-comment has been deemed “contrary to the public \ninterest” when “delay could result in serious harm[,]” Jifry v. FAA, 370 F.3d 1174, 1179 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004). \nHowever, courts need not defer to an agency’s own finding of good cause, see \nSorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2014), and \n“circumstances justifying reliance on [the good cause] exception are indeed rare and \nwill be accepted only after the court has examined closely proffered rationales \njustifying the elimination of public procedures.”  Council of S. Mountains, Inc. v. \nDonovan, 653 F.2d 573, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (internal quotation marks, citation, and \nalteration omitted).  “[T]he good-cause inquiry is ‘meticulous and demanding[,]’” \nSorenson Commc’ns, 755 F.3d at 706 (quoting N.J. Dep’t of Envtl. Prot. v. EPA, 626 \nF.2d 1038, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1980)), and the agency must point to “more than an \nunsupported assertion[,]” including “factual findings” and “record support proving the \nemergency,” id. at 707.   \nIn addition to requiring notice-and-comment rulemaking where applicable, the \nSupreme Court has also made quite clear that, under the APA, an administrative agency \ncannot promulgate rules in an arbitrary or capricious fashion.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42–43 (1983).  The \n68 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 71 of 126\nAPA itself requires that a court that is reviewing a challenged agency decision shall \n“hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be[,]” \namong other things, “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law[.]”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Furthermore, a trusted text—Black’s \nLaw Dictionary—defines “arbitrary” as “[d]epending on individual discretion; of, \nrelating to, or involving a determination made without consideration of or regard for \nfacts, circumstances, fixed rules, or procedures” or “founded on prejudice or preference \nrather than on reason or fact.”  Black’s Law Dictionary 125 (10th ed. 2014).  Likewise, \na “capricious” decision is defined as a decision that is “contrary to the evidence or \nestablished rules of law.”  Id. at 254.  Thus, by prohibiting “arbitrary” or “capricious” \nrulemaking, the APA mandates that agencies must consider relevant “facts, \ncircumstances, fixed rules, or procedures[,]” and must ignore “prejudice or preference” \nthat is not grounded in fact, id. at 125, when they undertake to exercise the discretion \nthat they have been given under the law.   \nNotably, when it evaluates agency actions for alleged arbitrariness, a federal \ncourt must be satisfied that the agency has “examine[d] the relevant data and \narticulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  This standard is “very deferential[,]” and the \nlaw “forbids a court from substitut[ing] its judgment for that of the agency.”  Van \nHollen, Jr. v. FEC, 811 F.3d 486, 495 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (second alteration in original) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, at the end of the day, an agency \naction must “be upheld as long as the [agency has] considered the relevant factors” and \n69 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 72 of 126\nhas “articulated” a rational explanation for the choice it made, given the facts that it \nfound.  Am. Rivers v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm’n, 895 F.3d 32, 45 (D.C. Cir. \n2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The required deference does not \ncountenance “rubber stamp[ing] agency actions,” however.  Nat’l Parks Conservation \nAss’n v. Jewell, 965 F. Supp. 2d 67, 74 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  To the contrary, “courts retain a role, and an important one, in \nensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking[,]” Judulang v. \nHolder, 565 U.S. 42, 53 (2011), and the Supreme Court has long held that if “the \nagency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely \nfailed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its \ndecision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,” or reached a decision that \n“is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of \nagency expertise[,]” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, then the reviewing court must “hold \nunlawful and set aside” the agency action, as the APA requires, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nThis all means that, as this Court explained during the motion hearing, \ngovernment officials are different from private actors when it comes to determining \npolicy; agencies have to seek public input and engage in reasoned deliberations, at the \nrisk of having a federal court invalidate their policy decisions, while, of course, private \ndecision makers have no similar duty.  (See, e.g., AM Hr’g Tr. at 67:15–23.)  Indeed, \nprivate individuals are free to engage in whatever decision making process suits their \nfancy when they choose their course of conduct.  By contrast, under federal law, \ngovernment actors who make policy decisions in their official capacities cannot \nsuccumb to whims or passions while rulemaking; instead, they must carefully evaluate \n70 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 73 of 126\nall of the relevant facts and circumstances and take into account the feedback they have \nto solicit and receive from interested members of the public.  See 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b)–\n(c), 706(2)(A).  Put in common parlance, if a policy decision that an agency makes is of \nsufficient consequence that it qualifies as an agency rule, then arbitrariness in deciding \nthe contours of that rule—e.g., decision making by Ouija board or dart board, \nrock/paper/scissors, or even the Magic 8 Ball—simply will not do.  There are well-\nestablished legal constraints on the manner in which an agency exercises its discretion \nto make discretionary policy decisions, and there are also legally established \nconsequences if an agency does not adhere to these procedural requirements when it \ndetermines the policies that it imposes.  See, e.g., Nat’l Envtl. Dev. Ass’n’s Clean Air \nProject v. EPA, 752 F.3d 999, 1008–09 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (invalidating EPA action under \nsection 706(2)(A) of the APA); Daimier Trucks N. Am. LLC v. EPA, 737 F.3d 95, 103 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (vacating EPA rule for failure to proceed through notice-and-comment\nrulemaking); Nat’l Fuel Gas Supply Corp. v. FERC, 468 F.3d 831, 839, 845 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) (vacating FERC actions under section 706(2)(A) of the APA); Sprint Corp. v. \nFCC, 315 F.3d 369, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (vacating FCC rule for failure to proceed \nthrough notice-and-comment rulemaking). \nb. It is likely that DHS needed to proceed through notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking prior to issuing the July 23rd Notice \nand that no good cause existed for the agency not to have \ncomplied with these mandates in this instance \nDHS points out that, in order to succeed with respect to a notice-and-comment \nclaim brought under the APA, the plaintiff must show that that the defendant-agency’s \nchallenged activity constitutes a “final agency action” and that the agency took that \naction without first engaging in the mandated notice-and-comment procedures (see \n71 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 74 of 126\nDefs.’ Opp’n at 45–46), and it maintains that Plaintiffs will fail to satisfy these\nelements with respect to a notice-and-comment claim that they have brought to \nchallenge Acting Secretary McAleenan’s July 23rd Notice for various reasons, the most\nsignificant of which is that, according to DHS, the July 23rd Notice does not qualify as \n“a reviewable ‘final agency action[.]’”  (Id. at 45 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704).)22  This \nCourt explains, in the discussion that follows, why DHS’s characterization of the July \n23rd Notice must be rejected, and why the Court has concluded that it is by far more \nlikely that the New Designation that is set forth in the July 23rd Notice counts as a final \nagency action that the agency needed to promulgate pursuant to the APA’s notice-and-\ncomment procedure.  \nFirst of all, there can be no dispute that, for APA purposes, “[a]n ‘agency action’ \nincludes any ‘rule,’” which the APA defines in relevant part as “‘an agency statement \nof general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, \nor prescribe law or policy[.]’”  Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(13), (4)).  Moreover, any such “[a]gency action is considered final to the extent \nthat it imposes an obligation, denies a right, or fixes some legal relationship.” Reliable \nAutomatic Sprinkler Co. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 324 F.3d 726, 731 (D.C. \nCir. 2003) (citation omitted).  Thus, a “[f]inal agency action ‘mark[s] the consummation \nof the agency’s decisionmaking process’ and is ‘one by which rights or obligations have \n \n22 While, technically, DHS’s brief casts this argument as a reason why the APA does not provide a \ncause of action (see Defs.’ Mem. at 41), this Court perceives it as a reason why these Plaintiffs cannot \navail themselves of the cause of action that the APA provides.  Thus, DHS’s lack-of-final-agency-\naction contention relates to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims, and the Court considers it in this part of the \nMemorandum Opinion accordingly. \n72 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 75 of 126\nbeen determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.’”  Id. (second alteration \nin original) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997)).  \nTo the Court, it seems fairly obvious that “legal consequences will flow” from \nActing DHS Secretary McAleenan’s July 23rd designation.  Bennet, 520 U.S. at 178. \nThe Notice itself specifically acknowledges that, before the agency issued that \nstatement, immigration officers could not have subjected an undocumented non-citizen \nwho had arrived by land and had been present in the United States for more than 14 \ndays to the expedited removal process, whereas, as of July 23, 2019, pursuant to the \nissuance of the Notice, such officers were authorized to do so.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at \n35,411 (notifying the public that Acting Secretary McAleenan was “[f]ully exercising \nDHS’s statutory expedited removal authority to include certain aliens who would not be \nsubject to expedited removal under the Previous Designations”); see also id. (“Under \nthe New Designation, ICE will be able to use expedited removal for certain aliens \nwho[m] it arrests in the interior[.]”).  Furthermore, it appears that, just as with the \nregulation that the Supreme Court found to be a final agency action in Abbott \nLaboratories v. Gardner, the July 23rd Notice published here “is quite clearly \ndefinitive.  There is no hint that this regulation is informal, or only the ruling of a \nsubordinate official, or tentative.”  387 U.S. at 151 (internal citations omitted).  \nAdditionally, and importantly, the policy change that the Notice announced “was made \neffective upon publication,” id., and the DHS Secretary made clear that the “immediate \nimplementation of DHS’s full statutory authority over expedited removal” was \n“warrant[ed][,]” 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,412 (emphasis added).   \n73 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 76 of 126\nDefendants’ insistence that “unless and until an alien is placed in expedited \nremoval proceedings as [a] result of the [July 23rd] Notice,” the designation is not a \nfinal agency action (Defs.’ Opp’n at 46) is clearly misguided, and thus easily dismissed.  \nFrom the start, DHS relies on the questionable proposition that “Plaintiffs cannot \ncredibly argue that the Notice is or will be imminently applied to a single Plaintiff in \nthis lawsuit,” and on this basis, it argues that “until ‘further administrative action’ in \nthe form of an order of expedited removal occurs, no final agency action is present.”  \n(Id.)  But DHS’s has not offered a single case that supports its spurious suggestion that \na plaintiff’s standing to sue (which is it likely that these Plaintiffs have, as the Court \nexplains in Part V.A.1.b, supra), or lack thereof, has anything whatsoever to do with \nwhether or not a challenged regulation constitutes a final agency action.  And try as \nthey might to muddy the waters by floating this untenable theory, buoyed by inapposite \ncase law, Defendants have done little to sink this Court’s confidence that the \nappropriate point of reference when evaluating whether an agency has engaged in a \nfinal agency action is the agency’s conduct, not its purported effect on the plaintiff, and \nthat the July 23rd Notice is sufficiently definitive to qualify as a final agency action, \ndespite the fact that it has yet to be applied to these Plaintiffs or, for that matter, anyone \nelse.  See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178 (explaining that final agency action “mark[s] the \n‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” as opposed to “be[ing] of a \nmerely tentative or interlocutory nature” (citation omitted)). \nDefendants’ argument that Plaintiffs still cannot succeed on the merits of their \nclaim that the agency has improperly promulgated a final rule because Acting Secretary \nMcAleenan’s July 23rd Notice is merely a general statement of policy, rather than a \n74 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 77 of 126\nsubstantive rule that needed to be subjected to notice-and-comment procedures (see \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 19), is also seemingly mistaken.  DHS urges the Court to conclude that \nthe July 23rd Notice “merely ‘advise[s] the public prospectively of the manner in which \nthe agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power’” (id. at 19 (quoting Lincoln v. \nVigil, 508 U.S. 182, 197 (1993)); see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 48–49)), insofar as the \nNotice states only “that DHS intends to exercise its discretionary authority to the full \nextent permitted under section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) going forward” (id. at 48), and “does \nnot require officers to exercise discretion in any particular way” (id.).  Indeed, says \nDHS, the Notice quite clearly “provides—through repeated use of the word ‘may’—that \nofficers retain authority ‘as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion’ to choose whether \nto place aliens subject to the Notice in either expedited or full removal proceedings \neven where aliens are ‘otherwise eligible for placement into expedited removal \nproceedings.’”  (Id. (quoting 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,412).) \nDHS appears to misunderstand the established distinction between substantive \nrules that require notice-and-comment rulemaking and general statements of policy, \nwhich do not.  The D.C. Circuit has explained that “a substantive rule ‘establishes a \nstandard of conduct which has the force of law’ in subsequent proceedings,” whereas \n“‘[a] general statement of policy, on the other hand, does not establish a ‘binding \nnorm[]’” and “is not finally determinative of the issues or rights to which it is \naddressed.”  Am. Hosp. Ass’n, 834 F.2d at 1046 (quoting Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v. Fed. \nPower Comm’n, 506 F.2d 33, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1974)).  In other words, unlike a substantive \nrule, “[t]he agency cannot apply or rely upon a general statement of policy as law[.]’”  \nId.   \n75 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 78 of 126\nThis binding D.C. Circuit precedent plainly supports a finding that the July 23rd\nNotice, which was published in the Federal Register and expressly purports to be a \ndesignation under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) that provides immigration officers with \npreviously unavailable authority to place certain undocumented non-citizens on the \nexpedited removal track, counts as a substantive rule that DHS needed to promulgate \nthrough the notice and comment process.23 The hallmarks of agency rulemaking are \nclearly evident: the DHS-proclaimed New Designation “modifies or adds to a legal \nnorm based on the agency’s own authority.”  Syncor Int’l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, \n95 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (emphasis in original).  And, as noted, prior to July 23, 2019, \nimmigration officers under DHS’s command could not have subjected the newly \ndesignated class of non-citizens to expedited removal; however, per the July 23rd \nNotice, they now can.24  DHS cannot deny (and, indeed, it incessantly repeats) the fact \nthat the agency exercised its statutory authority under the INA’s section \n235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) when it issued the Notice.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,413; (AM \nHr’g Tr. at 66:17–67:6).  Thus, it appears to have conceded that its “authority” to have \nissued the July 23rd Notice “flows from a congressional delegation to promulgate \n23 The D.C. Circuit has also helpfully “observed” that while “an agency’s characterization of its own \naction . . . is a factor that we do consider[,]” that characterization is “not decisive.”  Am. Hosp. Ass’n, \n834 F.2d at 1047.  Thus, this Court is not bound by DHS’s feeble attempt to cast the July 23rd Notice \nas merely the agency’s stated (and published) intention to pursue some policy in the future.  (See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 48.)  Moreover, the Notice itself makes it crystal clear that, effective immediately, \nundocumented non-citizens who have not been admitted or paroled and who cannot establish that they \nhave been continuously present in the United States for at least two years may be subject to expedited \nremoval. \n24 And, again, it makes no difference to the rule’s proper characterization that no immigration officer \nhas yet pulled the trigger with respect to the authority that the July 23rd Notice provides.  DHS might \nwell intend to train the officers who now have this authority (see AM Hr’g Tr. at 35:10–12), and such \ntraining might cause a delay in the execution of the agency’s New Designation (see id. at 35:12–14), \nbut that is of no moment when the question on the table is whether DHS has exercised its statutory \nauthority to implement a rule that governs such officers’ conduct.  \n76 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 79 of 126\nsubstantive rules, to engage in supplementary lawmaking.”  Syncor Int’l Corp., 127 \nF.3d at 95.  And, as a result, the Court is likely to find that “the agency [was] engaged \nin lawmaking [such] that the APA require[d] it to comply with notice and comment.”  \nId. \nDefendants’ other argument in opposition to a finding that the July 23rd Notice \nshould be deemed a substantive rule—i.e., that ICE officers retain discretion to place \nthose non-citizens subject to expedited removal into those proceedings, so the July 23rd \nNotice cannot be deemed a substantive rule that triggers the notice-and-comment \nduty—is even less persuasive.  The D.C. Circuit has long held that “[i]t is enough for\nthe agency’s statement to ‘purport to bind’ those subject to it, that is, to be cast in \n‘mandatory language’ so ‘the affected private parties are reasonably led to believe that \nfailure to conform will bring adverse consequences.’”  Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. DHS, \n653 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Gen. Elec. Co. v. EPA, 290 F.3d 377, 383–84 \n(D.C. Cir. 2002)).  So it is here.  Although individual immigration officers have the \npower to opt on a case-by-case basis to stay their hands with respect to their new-found \nauthority, the New Designation plainly binds the undocumented non-citizens who make \nup the newly designated class, and it places them at risk of being targeted for expedited \nremoval, when they were not in such jeopardy before.  Explained in a different fashion, \nthe potential benevolence of individual line-agents is cold comfort from the standpoint \nof those persons who are located far from the border and are now in the agency’s \ncrosshairs, when, prior to the New Designation, they were not.   \nThe D.C. Circuit rejected similar agency deflection regarding the significance of \nthe potentially less-than-uniform impact of its policy change in Electronic Privacy \n77 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 80 of 126\nInformation Center v. United States Department of Homeland Security.  See 653 F.3d at \n7 (noting, with respect to a challenge to the Transportation Security Administration’s \n(“TSA”) decision to use advanced imaging technology (“AIT”) to screen airline \npassengers, instead of magnetometers, that “[t]he TSA seems to think it significant that \nthere are no AIT scanners at some airports and [that] the agency retains the discretion to \nstop using the scanners where they are in place[,]” and explaining that “[m]ore clearly \nsignificant is that a passenger is bound to comply with whatever screening procedure \nthe TSA is using on the date he is to fly at the airport from which his flight departs”).  \nThis Court, too, finds it doubtful that the fact that the July 23rd Notice allows officers \ndiscretion to apply the binding policy defeats the conclusion that the Notice counts a \nsubstantive rule.  \nFinally, the Court notes that DHS’s underdeveloped, hail-Mary assertion that the \nJuly 23rd Notice is not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures because it \nis subject to the “agency rule” exemption (see Defs.’ Opp’n at 49 n.10) likely fails as \nwell.  “A useful articulation of [that] exemption’s critical feature is that it covers \nagency actions that do not themselves alter the rights or interests of parties, although it \nmay alter the manner in which parties present themselves or their viewpoints to the \nagency.”  Am. Hosp. Ass’n, 834 F.2d at 1047 (quoting Batterton, 648 F.2d at 707).  As \noutlined above, the July 23rd designation undeniably alters the rights and interests of \nthose non-citizens who otherwise could not have been subject to expedited removal. \nGiven that (1) Plaintiffs are likely to be able to establish that the July 23rd \nNotice qualifies as a substantive rule, (2) Congress did not expressly exempt the \nexpedited removal designation that DHS is authorized to issue under the INA’s section \n78 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 81 of 126\n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) from the APA’s procedural requirements, and (3) DHS did not \nnotify the public of the New Designation or seek public comment prior to announcing \nthat the New Designation was a fully effective statement of agency policy, the only \nremaining factor that might thwart Plaintiffs’ success with respect to establishing the \nclaimed violation of the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements is whether there was \ngood cause for DHS to issue this rule without engaging in notice-and-comment \nrulemaking.  See Council of S. Mountains, 653 F.2d at 580.  Defendants dutifully try \nthis tack.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 49–52.)  But record facts are pesky things; here, the \nagency’s own conduct in waiting two and a half years to issue the New Designation \nafter the President first brought this matter to the agency’s attention, and also its own \nstatements (made in the course of this litigation) confidently asserting that none of \nPlaintiffs’ members are in danger, will likely impede the agency’s progress with respect \nto any good-cause showing.  \nFirst, though, it is important to address Defendants’ broad contention that the \nINA itself dispenses with the need to show good cause with respect to any particular \nimplementation decision by the agency.  DHS asserts that “[t]he clear import of the \nunfettered discretion accorded the Secretary [in section 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)] is to permit \nthe Secretary ‘to apply the expedited removal procedures to additional classes of aliens \nwithin the limits set by the statute if, in the [Secretary’s] discretion, such action is \noperationally warranted’” and in the agency’s view, that “includ[es] in ‘specific \nsituations such as a sudden influx of illegal aliens motivated by political or economic \nunrest or other events or by a general need to increase the effectiveness of enforcement \noperations at one or more locations.’”  (Defs.’ Opp’n at 47 (second alteration in \n79 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 82 of 126\noriginal) (quoting 62 Fed. Reg. at 10,313–14).)  In other words, according to \nDefendants, “[n]otice-and-comment procedures are incompatible with that clear \nstatutory goal, and would eviscerate the statutory purpose that the Secretary be able to \n‘modif[y]’ a designation ‘at any time.’”  (Id. (second alteration in original) (quoting 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)).)   \nDefendants’ arguments in this regard are not likely to succeed.  In a nutshell, this \nCourt sees nothing in the INA that suggests that Congress intended to displace the \nstandard order when it comes to agency decision making; for example, unlike other \nstatutes, the INA’s expedited removal provisions do not establish “a comprehensive, \nfreestanding scheme with particularized procedures that are different and unique from \nthose provided by the APA,” such that it is clear that Congress intend for DHS not to \nfollow the APA’s notice-and-comment prescriptions.  Envtl. Integrity Proj. v. EPA, 177 \nF. Supp. 3d 36, 43 (D.D.C. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted); (see also Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 47 (quoting same)).  And, again, the mere fact that section \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) states that DHS may modify the designation as to who is subject to \nexpedited removal “at any time,” does not mean Congress wanted DHS to be allowed to \nmodify the designation randomly, without giving considered thought to that decision, \nand at a moment’s notice.  (See supra Part V.2.b.)   \nAnd with respect to the New Designation that Acting Secretary McAleenan \nannounced on July 23, 2019, there appears to be no good reason why DHS failed to \nsolicit public comment that might well have brought additional and significant \ninformation to light.  DHS’s assertion that it would have been “impracticab[le]” to do \nso under the circumstances presented here (Defs.’ Opp’n at 51 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. at \n80 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 83 of 126\n35,413)) makes a mockery of that otherwise legitimate criterion; indeed, DHS appears \nto have had nothing but time—29 months, to be exact—between then-Secretary Kelly’s \npublic announcement that the agency would be implementing a new expedited removal \ndesignation and the agency’s actual issuance of the July 23rd Notice, and, surely, it was \npossible for DHS to have laid the necessary groundwork and to craft a proposed rule for \nsubmission to the public in that span.  What its impracticality argument really conveys \nis the agency’s mistaken conclusion that it did not need to do so (see id. (arguing that \n“[t]he Notice cannot be ‘effective immediately’ or ‘modified at any time’ if notice-and-\ncomment is required, and therefore it is impracticable to provide such notice”)), but that \nis not the stuff of which a valid “impracticability” argument is made.  \nNor can Defendants credibly contend that this Court should find good cause for \nits failure to comply with the APA’s procedural requirements when it promulgated the \nNew Designation based on the public’s interest in the agency’s being in a position to \nrespond to a “surge” at the border.  84 Fed. Reg. at 35,413; (see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 49 \n(arguing that notice-and-comment rulemaking was “contrary to the ‘public interest’” \nwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B))), given that “‘delayed implementation \ncould lead to a surge in migration across the southern border across a notice-and-\ncomment period,’ threatening ‘national security and public safety,’ and causing possible \n‘destabilizing effect[s] on the region,’ and ‘significant loss of human life’” (id. \n(alteration in original) (quoting 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,413).)  As noted, this Court need not \ndefer to the agency’s judgment about whether or not it had the need to move quickly, \nsee Sorenson Commc’ns Inc., 755 F.3d at 706, but DHS has also repeatedly suggested \n(in the context of this litigation) that, really, no one needs to worry about its execution \n81 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 84 of 126\nof this new policy, because the agency may not be moving to enforce expeditious \nremoval of settled undocumented non-citizens per the power of the July 23rd Notice \nanytime soon.  (See, e.g., Defs.’ Opp’n at 39–41; AM Hr’g Tr. at 35:8–14.)    \nSuch representations contradict—and undermine—the agency’s contention that\nthe reason notice-and-comment was, in the agency’s view, expendable, was that it had \nto implement the New Designation policy fast, to provide it with tools to deal with “the \nongoing crisis” at the border.  84 Fed. Reg. at 35,411.  And it is hard to know which of \nthe agency’s representations to credit, because if there is no imminent threat that \nPlaintiffs’ members will be subjected to expedited removal under the July 23rd Notice, \nand the execution of that Notice is not an agency priority, how much weight can its \nassertions about its need to hastily “remov[e] from the United States . . . aliens who \ncannot establish a credible fear of persecution or torture[,]” id. at 35,412, such that \nnotice-and-comment procedures were not required prior to its issuance of the New \nDesignation, be given?   \nThus, in the end, it is not likely that this Court will be persuaded that DHS had \ngood cause for side-stepping the ordinary rulemaking gauntlet, or that skipping the \nnotice-and-comment procedure was in the public’s interest, due to the agency’s need to \nrise rapidly to meet the challenge that an influx of undocumented non-citizens at the \nborder presents.  The fact is, DHS did not respond quickly to a purported urgent need to \nissue the New Designation.  Instead, it waited for more than two and a half years after \nthe President publicly identified the need before it actually issued its Notice.  \nFurthermore, DHS showed no urgency even after the policy that it announced became \neffective; indeed, somewhat inexplicably, the agency announced, on July 23, 2019, that \n82 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 85 of 126\nthe New Designation was “effective immediately,” id. at 35,410, but failed to take any \nsteps to enforce that policy until 40 days later, on September 1, 2019 (see, e.g.,\nTeleconf. Tr. at 3:7–8).  And here, still, government counsel reminds us that the agency \nhas not yet acted to impose the policy on an any of the individuals whom it affects.  \n(See AM Hr’g Tr. at 35:8–14.)  But DHS also invites the Court to find, as a matter of \nlaw, that “a surge in migration” can happen quickly (Defs.’ Opp’n at 49 (quoting 84 \nFed. Reg. at 35,413)), and that this mere prospect justifies the agency’s failure to \ncomply with the APA with respect to promulgating the rule that it has not yet chosen to \nenforce.  All things considered, this Court is unlikely to accept that contention.  \nConsequently, the much more likely scenario is that the Court will conclude at \nthe end of the day that DHS was required by the APA to provide the public with notice, \nand an opportunity to comment, before the agency adopted the New Designation and \nannounced that policy change.  In addition, the Court is likely to conclude that there \nwas no good reason for DHS to fail to comply with the APA’s notice-and-comment \nrequirements, under the circumstances presented in this case.  As a result, Plaintiffs \nhave a likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their notice-and-comment claim.   \nc.  It is likely that the July 23rd Notice resulted from arbitrary \nand capricious decision making  \nBased on the evidence presented here, it is also likely that Plaintiffs will be \nsuccessful in persuading the Court that DHS’s New Designation rule was promulgated \nin an arbitrary and capricious fashion.  Plaintiffs’ primary argument in this regard is \nthat, even now, DHS “fails to acknowledge . . . the due process problems in the existing \nexpedited removal system,” and they argue that, due to this unexplained oversight, the \nrecord amply demonstrates that the agency cannot have “ensure[d]” the New \n83 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 86 of 126\nDesignation’s “fair application to those newly subject to the Rule.”  (Pls.’ Mem. at 47 \n(capitalization altered).)  And with respect to their contention that problems abound,\nPlaintiffs bring the receipts: the evidence includes supporting declarations that outline\nthe flaws in the existing expedited removal system.  (See id. at 18–23.) Boiled to bare \nessence, Plaintiffs’ arbitrariness claim appears to be that the flaws in the pre-existing \nscheme were so glaring that the agency’s failure to account for them when it adopted \nthe New Designation renders the July 23rd Notice irretrievably infirm.    \nFor example, according to Plaintiffs, prior applications of the expedited removal \npolicy featured erroneous identifications of persons as being subject to removal (see id. \nat 19), as well as instances in which such erroneously identified persons were also  \nactually deported (see id. at 18–19).  In addition, there have allegedly been egregious \nerrors in recording “material statements made by noncitizens who express a fear of \npersecution or torture” (id. at 19; see id. at 19–21); failures to provide translators (see \nid. at 22); and failures “to advise noncitizens that they may request to withdraw their \napplications for admission, which allows noncitizens to leave the United States \nvoluntarily and avoid penalties that include permanent inadmissibility to the country” \n(id.).  Plaintiffs also say that evidence concerning these and other problems was widely \navailable before DHS issued the July 23rd Notice; for example, it is purportedly \nincluded in studies that the United States Commission on International Religious \nFreedom—a government entity—has conducted.  (See, e.g., id. at 18 (citing U.S. \nComm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Report on Asylum Seekers in Expedited Removal: \nVolume I: Findings & Recommendations 4-5, 10 (2005); U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious \nFreedom, Barriers to Protection: The Treatment of Asylum Seekers in Expedited Removal 2 \n(2016)).)\n84 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 87 of 126\nAmici contend that “DHS’s decision to expand expedited removal will inflict \nbroad and systemic harm on the individuals, families, communities, and the broader \npublic” (Amicus Br. at 26), because “[p]eople who have lived in this country for one or \ntwo years . . . have begun to build lives here.  They contribute to our economy and civic \nlife in countless ways” (id. at 26–27).  Amici note, for example, that “undocumented \nimmigrants in California each year contribute an estimated $3 billion in state and local \ntaxes” (id. at 27),25 and that “[u]ndocumented immigrants in New Jersey paid an \nestimated $587.4 million in state and local taxes in 2014” (id. at 27–28).26 Amici also \noutline the impact that DHS’s expanded expedited removal designation could have on \nchildren and families, as “millions of people live in ‘mixed-status’ households, where \none or both parents may be undocumented, while some or all of the children (and, \nsometimes, a spouse) are U.S. citizens.”  (Id. at 28.)27 Amici maintain that \n“[e]xpanding expedited removal means that these ‘mixed-status’ families face \nseparation with little or no time to prepare” (id.), and, indeed, according to the amicus \nbrief, “[s]tudies show that children faced with the likelihood of a family member[’s] \ndeportation can experience serious mental health problems, including depression, \nanxiety, self-harm, and regression” (id.).28 Amici also contend that “deporting a \n \n25 Citing Inst. on Taxation & Econ.

In this regard, the Court observes that \nnowhere in DHS’s brief does the agency say: “your Honor, what Plaintiffs are \nrepresenting about the state of affairs that might occur as a result of the expansion of \nour expedited removal practice is wrong” or that “Plaintiffs’ accounts of what might \nhappen are grossly exaggerated.”  And in the absence of any such representation, the \nCourt is left to wonder where in the administrative record does the agency consider, and \nattempt to address, these flaws and issues as part of its decision making process \nregarding whether or not to adopt this new policy?  There is no question in this Court’s \nmind that an agency cannot possibly conduct reasoned, non-arbitrary decision making \nconcerning policies that might impact real people and not take such real life \ncircumstances into account.

Cir. 2017) (finding that agency failed to address the “relevant \nenvironmental concern” and “denied its very existence”). \nBecause of the potentially serious implications that DHS’s expansion of \nexpedited removal might have on the persons who would be subjected to expedited \nremoval under the New Designation, as well as the potential impact on their families \nand the communities in which they live—DHS admits that its new designation could \nsubject “hundreds of thousands” of non-citizens to rapid removal, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n35,411; (see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 66–67)—the Court is persuaded that there is a \nsubstantial likelihood that DHS “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, before issuing the July 23rd Notice, and as result, \nthat the agency failed to engage in reasoned decision making, as required by law, see 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  In particular, it appears to the Court that DHS only considered the \nupsides of the New Designation in terms of its potential effects on “national security \nand public safety” and the fact that the rule had the potential of “reducing government \ncosts[.]”  84 Fed. Reg. at 35,409.  But there is no evident consideration of the \nconsiderable downsides of adopting a policy that, in many respects, could significantly \nimpact people’s everyday lives in many substantial, tangible, and foreseeable ways.   \nTo be clear:  DHS is more than entitled to consider the issues that it did take into \naccount, i.e., whether expanding expedited removal in the manner outlined in the July \n23rd Notice would “alleviate some of the burden and capacity issues currently faced by \n87 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 90 of 126\nDHS and [the Department of Justice][,]” id. at 35,411; or would “more quickly make \navailable additional ICE bed space, which can be used for additional interior arrests and \nremovals[,]” id.; or would “mitigate additional backlogs in the immigration courts” and \n“reduce the significant costs to the government associated with full removal \nproceedings before an immigration judge, including the costs of a longer detention \nperiod and government representation in those proceedings[,]” id. at 35,412.  These are \nall relevant and important considerations, and the fact that the agency lists them in the \nJuly 23rd Notice suggests that the agency may well have gone part-way to where it \nneeds to be on the continuum between reasoned decision making and irrationality.  But \nan agency cannot consider only the perceived shiny bright spots of a policy that it is \nmulling—the silver lining, if you will.  To make a reasoned decision that passes muster \nunder the APA, the agency must also attempt to forecast the storm clouds that might be \nspawned if it adopts the proposed policy, and it must at least acknowledge the potential \nimpact that such dark clouds might actually have on the people and communities the \npolicy would affect.   \nWith respect to the policy at issue here, the potential devastation is so obvious\nthat DHS can be fairly faulted for its unexplained failure to predict, and attempt to \nmitigate, the fully foreseeable future floods.  For one thing, the evidence plainly \nindicates that the prior expedited removal practices have known and significant glitches \nwhen they have been applied to undocumented non-citizens who have just arrived in \nthis country.  (See Pls.’ Mem. at 18–23.)  Did DHS consider the order-of-magnitude \ndifference that applying this policy would have if such problems occur with respect to \nimmigrants who are in the United States, lawfully, and who have been here for a \n88 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 91 of 126\nconsiderable period of time, and would face a substantially increased risk that they \nmight be erroneously identified and flagged for rapid removal as a result of the \nexpanded expedited removal practice? (Cf. id. at 18–19.)30 At the very least, it would \nseem that some consideration of how many people might be erroneously swept up in the \nexpanded expedited-removal dragnet, and/or how often such identification errors have \noccurred with respect to the agency’s expedited-removal practices in the past, would be \nin order if the agency endeavors to undertake a rational consideration of whether to \nramp up the practice.  Yet, at least at this preliminary stage, no one has pointed to any \ndata or information about such cautionary tales in the administrative record at issue \nhere. \nThere is also the matter of the real-world consequences of implementing a policy \nthat permits immigration officers to eject individuals immediately (even undocumented \nnon-citizens) if such folks have been living and working inside the United States for \nlengthy periods of time.  (See Amicus Br. at 26–27 (“People who have lived in this \ncountry for one or two years (or more) have begun to build lives here.”).)  DHS has not \npersuasively argued that the burden of having to (a) avoid immigration officials \nentirely—which Plaintiffs show is likely difficult or impossible for many non-citizens \nwho would be subject to expedited removal (see, e.g., Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 6 (explaining \nthat “[immigration] enforcement actions occur across contexts—they include \nsurveillance and arrests at courthouses, buses, and trains, as well as raids on workplaces \nand homes” (citation omitted)))—or (b) carry around documents establishing one’s \n \n30 This is not to suggest that the potential injury to such people is a sufficient basis for them to assert \nArticle III standing, as Plaintiffs suggest.  (See Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 6.)  Rather, it goes to show that such \nindividuals exist, and to the extent that they might be harmed, DHS was likely obliged to take potential \ninjury to such persons into account. \n89 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 92 of 126\ncontinuous presence or lawful status at all times in perpetuity, is irrelevant to a rational \nassessment of a policy that would likely generate this outcome.  And if that factor \nmatters, then DHS was required to take it into account.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  \nHowever, in this respect, too, the Court has yet to find any record evidence that DHS \nactually considered such burdens as part of its decision making process before it \nadopted the New Designation (and perhaps for good reason, because, as far as this \nCourt can tell at this early stage in the case, such matters were not factored in at all). \nNor does it appear that DHS employed its expertise to engage in the kinds of \ncareful line-drawing that Congress likely intended when it authorized the agency to \ndesignate classes of individuals as subject to the expedited removal process.  Congress \nroutinely sets maximum parameters within which agents of the government may \nexercise discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 233 (2005) \n(reinforcing, in the context of criminal sentencing, a federal judge’s authority “to \nexercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range”).  But it \ntypically does so with the expectation that those agents will exercise that discretion in a \nreasoned manner, i.e., by doing the work necessary to make rational, non-arbitrary \ndecisions about the policies that will be implemented pursuant to that authority.  Cf., \ne.g., 28 U.S.C. § 991 (establishing and outlining purpose of the United States \nSentencing Commission, which is to “establish sentencing policies and practices for the \nFederal criminal justice system[,]” including, among other things, “provid[ing] \ncertainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing”).  That intent is evident \nwith respect to the INA, because Congress plainly established the outer contours of \nacceptable implementation of the expedited removal process, see 8 U.S.C. \n90 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 93 of 126\n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), and then asked the Attorney General to exercise his discretion \nto designate the categories of persons who will be subjected to expedited removal \nwithin those contours, see id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I).   \nConsistent with legislative authorization in other areas, this grant of \ndiscretionary authority should not be taken to mean Congress must have intended for \nthe agency to have full power to exercise its discretion in an irrational way.  (But see \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 67–68.)  In fact, it is much more likely that Congress wanted the \nAttorney General (now, DHS) to make expedited removal designations under section \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) in a manner that reflects the agency’s expertise, which, of course, is \nlikely the reason why Congress thought it best to tap the agency at all.  That is, in 1996, \nwhen Congress undertook to create the expedited removal process by statute, it could \nhave easily dictated precisely who would be subject to expedited removal at that time, \nin the first instance, rather than enlisting the Attorney General’s help.  But, instead, \nCongress intentionally delegated the designation authority to the expert agency that it \nlikely believed was best equipped to make rational decisions about who should be \nexposed to the significant and consequential risks it was creating.    \nIn this Court’s view, this means that DHS is not at all exempt from the \nreasonable rulemaking requirement.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 67–68 (arguing that the \nagency had every right to just adopt, wholesale, the statutory limit in its rules).)  To the \ncontrary, it is likely that DHS only has such authority precisely because Congress and \nthe Attorney General believed that an administrative agency with DHS’s portfolio could \nbe counted on to ask the right questions, to look at all the facts, and to evaluate, fully, \nthe best course of action with respect to expedited removal process.   \n91 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 94 of 126\nThus, in this Court’s considered judgment, in order to have fulfilled that duty \nwith respect to the designation decision that is at issue here, at a minimum, DHS needed \nto consider such questions as “how long is too long” for an undocumented non-citizen, \nwho has been living in this country for an extended period of time, to carry the burden \nof having to provide immediate proof of his identity and alienage, without access to \ncounsel or other procedures.  Also important is an inquiry into whether imposing such a \nburden on individuals living anywhere in the nation’s approximately 3.5 million square \nmiles is really needed.31 Another way of getting at these same relevant concerns would \nbe for the agency to consider, with respect to the category of settled undocumented non-\ncitizens who might have substantial ties to the United States at the time they are \nencountered, which public interests weigh more heavily in the balance between rapid \nremoval and providing procedural rights.32\nNone of the statements that the Acting DHS Secretary makes in the July 23rd \nNotice indicates that the agency took into account any of these matters.  And based on \nwhat the Notice says and the administrative record, Plaintiffs are likely to be able to \ndemonstrate that the agency’s only concern was the potential impact of this policy \nchange on its own resources and the efficiency of the immigration removal system.  \nThis Court is of the opinion that, even assuming that DHS fairly and accurately \nassessed those impacts and has stated a rational connection between the agency’s goals \nand the policy it has adopted (which is not crystal clear), the agency’s apparent failure \n \n31 See The World Factbook, Central Intelligence Agency, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-\nworld-factbook/geos/us.html.  \n32 And, of course, one way to figure this out would be to put the proposed rule in the Federal Register \nand seek public comment about it. \n92 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 95 of 126\nto evaluate the impact of the policy on the individuals who would be subject to the New \nDesignation, and their communities, means that it has ignored a significant aspect of the \nproblem that its proposed policy creates—i.e., the fact that the greatly expanded \ncategory of individuals who would be newly subject to expedited removal might have \nties to the community that individuals arriving at ports-of-entry, or those who are found \nwithin 100 miles of a border and who have not been in the United States for at least two \nweeks, generally do not.33\nIn reviewing the evidence and considering the arguments that the parties in this \nlawsuit have made regarding the allegedly arbitrary and capricious nature of DHS’s \nNew Designation, this Court has struggled to provide a concrete way to convey its \nconclusions about what the evidence is likely to show and what the law indisputably \nrequires with respect to DHS’s decision making process in regard to the policy it has \nadopted.  The Court has come to realize a helpful fact that is easily inferred from the \npanoply of statements that 17 states, and the District of Columbia, make in their joint \namicus brief (see Amicus Br. at 26–32), as well as the press accounts they cite.  As \nsummarized above, amici persuasively point to the significant harms that are likely to \noccur if the New Designation that DHS has adopted is enforced around the country, and \nthe inference of fact that they amply support is this: the expedited removal of an \nindividual who may have been living and working in the United States for a significant \nperiod of time has the potential to cause trauma.  And not just to the individuals\nthemselves; indeed, the anticipated radius of injury also encompasses those persons’\n \n33 The distinction between these two categories of persons explains why the D.C. Circuit’s alleged \nendorsement of DHS’s prior expedited removal practices (see Defs.’ Opp’n at 68) is not sufficient to \nwarrant the conclusion that the Circuit would overrule all objections to the July 23rd Notice. \n93 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 96 of 126\nhouseholds, neighborhoods, communities, workplaces, cities, counties, and States.  (See \nid.) When DHS evaluates whether or not such inflicted pain is really worth it (as it \nmust), it can certainly assess all of the benefits it can identify with respect to the \nhumanity voids that an expanded expedited removal policy creates, including the \nagency’s own saved resources, see 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,411; the effect on the agency’s \nability to protect our national security, see id.; and anything else the facts support.  But \nany reasonable decisionmaker would also want to know about the problems, and would \nundoubtedly do its best to temper, or, at the very least, acknowledge, those effects.   \nThis means that, in the instant context, before DHS decides to authorize the swift \nejection of someone who lives in the interior of the country and has been here for up to \ntwo years, it would likely have to do some research regarding such matters as how long \na person must be here, on average, to be likely to have the kinds of substantial ties to \nthe community that would make her expedited removal more, or less, consequential for \nall involved.  DHS is certainly an expert with respect to that kind of information, and if \nit had bothered to consider impact issues prior to issuing the July 23rd Notice, who \nknows what that agency, with all its expertise about the effect of U.S. immigration law \non the communities in question, would have found?  Perhaps two months is not long \nenough to really lay down roots, but 18 months of being here, and then being yanked \naway, would be problematic in myriad ways.  Again, those are the kinds of judgment \ncalls that Congress plainly asked the agency to determine, and DHS had an opportunity \nto bring its knowledge, and its judgment, to bear on that important question before it \ndecided that imposing expedited removal on persons who have been in the United States \nfor up to two years was going to be the call.  Most importantly for present purposes, the \n94 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 97 of 126\nAPA and the cases that interpret it make clear that DHS’s apparent failure to undertake \nany kind of assessment of any of the downside risks of the proposed New Designation\nwas a gross abdication of the agency’s statutorily designated responsibilities in this \nregard. See Nat’l Lifeline Ass’n, 921 F.3d at 1113–14; Am. Wild Horse Pres. \nCampaign, 873 F.3d at 930–31. \nNotably, this Court is not saying anything at all about whether the policy choice \nthat the July 23rd Notice reflects—i.e., up to two years of continuous residency; to be \nemployed in every state in the Union—is proper as a substantive matter.  Plaintiffs have \ntried (quite vigorously, in fact) to compel the Court to reach that conclusion in the \ncontext of its emergency motion, but this Court is ever mindful of DHS’s, and \nCongress’s, considerable expertise in these areas, as well as the established legal \nprinciple that (up to constitutional limits) the Court cannot “substitut[e] its judgment \nfor that of the agency.”  Van Hollen, Jr., 811 F.3d at 495 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).   \nFurthermore, and most important, based on the record presented here, the Court \nneed not come anywhere close to making a due-process pronouncement and still \nconclude that DHS likely engaged in arbitrary and capricious decision making with \nrespect to the rule at issue in this case.  This is because clear and binding precedent \nholds that it is the very definition of arbitrariness in rulemaking if an agency refuses to \nacknowledge (or fails to obtain) the facts and figures that matter prior to exercising its \ndiscretion to promulgate a rule.  See Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, \n2569 (2019); State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  And, indeed, in this Court’s view, an \nadministrative agency that just plows ahead and announces a new rule, without taking \n95 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 98 of 126\nthe reasonably foreseeable potential negative impacts of the policy determination into \naccount (as DHS appears to have to done) might as well have picked its policy out of a \nhat.  (See AM Hr’g Tr. at 61:13–17; see also id. at 67:24–68:1 (defense counsel, \nexpressing relief in response to the Court’s line of arbitrariness questions, and in jest, \nthat “thankfully, . . . there’s no suggestion that [the Acting Secretary] did use darts or a \nOuija board”).) \nB.  If Plaintiffs’ Members Are Subjected To DHS’s Expanded Expedited \nRemoval Policy During The Pendency Of This Lawsuit, They Will \nSuffer Irreparable Harm \nMoving on to the second prong of the preliminary injunction analysis—at nearly \n100 pages into this discussion—the Court is relieved to find that the irreparable-harm \ninquiry need not detain it for long.  Plaintiffs’ contention that their members are likely \nto suffer irreparable harm without immediate judicial intervention is credible and \nsupported by the evidence, and the case for this conclusion was almost already made, \njust on the basis of the Court’s prior evaluation of Plaintiffs’ members’ likely injury for \nstanding purposes.  (See supra Part V.A.1.b.)  With respect to the merits of the motion \nfor a preliminary injunction, the law defines “[a]n ‘irreparable harm’ [a]s an imminent \ninjury that is both great and likely, and for which legal remedies are inadequate[,]” \nJackson v. Dist. of Columbia, 692 F. Supp. 2d 5, 7 (D.D.C. 2010) (citing Wis. Gas Co. \nv. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)), and this Court has already concluded \nthat Plaintiffs have established a substantial likelihood that at least some of their \nmembers face an injury that is imminent enough to provide the Plaintiff-organizations \nwith the legal right to file an action in federal court alleging that DHS has violated the \nAPA.  Therefore, the Court’s assessment of whether the Plaintiff-organizations have \nshown that their members are likely to face irreparable harm absent a preliminary \n96 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 99 of 126\ninjunction, which is a required showing for entitlement to such emergency relief, will \nfocus, first, on whether the harm alleged is sufficiently severe to compel the conclusion \nthat interim injunctive relief is warranted, and then, on whether the harms Plaintiffs \nallege could be otherwise remedied.  \nTo this end, the Court begins by acknowledging that Plaintiffs maintain that their \norganizations include members who would be legally subject to the expanded expedited \nremoval procedures, “because they entered without inspection[] and have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for less than two years.”  (Pls.’ Mem. at 53.) \nPlaintiffs also proffer that they have members who are not subject to expedited removal\nunder DHS’s New Designation, because they have been continuously present here for \nlonger than two years, for example, but could be irreparably be harmed by being \nmistakenly swept up in the agency’s wide-scale expansion of the fast-track procedures.  \n(See id.)  Plaintiffs further assert that many of their members who have authorization to \nbe in the United States fear being subjected to expedited removal “because they do not \nhave or know what documents they could use to show their legal status or their \ncontinuous presence, and do not know when and how they would be able to access this \ncrucial information if they encounter[ed] an immigration officer at work, on the street, \nor [at] a courthouse.”  (Id.)  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that, in any event, they are being \nirreparably “‘depriv[ed] of a procedural protection to which [they are] entitled’ under \nthe APA,” because the agency has not considered the comments that Plaintiffs would \nhave submitted as part of the required notice and comment process.  (Id. at 54 (quoting \nSugar Cane Growers Coop. of Fla. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 94–95 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).)   \n97 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 100 of 126\nPlaintiffs have presented several declarations to support these contentions, the \nmost helpful of which is the Declaration of Kara Hartzler, a criminal defense lawyer \nwho has worked as a public defender in San Diego, California, for seven years.  (See\nDecl. of Kara Hartzler, ECF No. 13-14, ¶ 1.)  Hartzler has seen her share of expedited \nremoval situations; she generally avers to the “rushed nature of the [expedited removal] \nproceedings” (id. ¶ 11), and helpfully explains that “[t]he [removal] order is usually \nissued within a few days, if not hours” (id. ¶ 13).  Other declarants also attest that \nsignificant errors also occur, at times, with respect to these types of proceedings.  \nJoanna Delfunt, a Georgia-based lawyer with her own law firm (see Decl. of Joanna \nDelfunt, ECF No. 13-11, ¶ 1), testifies that an expedited removal order was once issued \nagainst a non-citizen who had been present in the United States for three years on a visa \n(see id. ¶ 8).  Leah Jones, an associate at a law firm in California (see Decl. of Leah A. \nJones, ECF No. 13-17, ¶ 1), recounts that an expedited removal order was issued \nagainst an undocumented non-citizen who had arrived in the United States to escape \n“horrific domestic violence” within 24 hours of her arrival at a port of entry, even \nthough the potential asylee explicitly told the immigration officer that she was afraid to \nreturn to her home country (id. ¶¶ 11, 14).  And Jose Rodriguez, another California \nattorney (see Decl. of Jose Jesus Rodriguez, ECF No. 13-13, ¶ 1), avers that DHS \nsometimes issues expedited removal orders against non-citizens who are not provided \nwith translators, and who are never asked about whether they have a fear of persecution \nshould they be returned to their home country (see id. ¶¶ 7–9).   \nPlaintiffs have thus provided sufficient evidence that at least one of each \norganization’s members has a substantially increased risk of facing substantial harm \n98 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 101 of 126\nabsent an order that enjoins DHS from enforcing the July 23rd Notice while the parties \nlitigate this matter on the merits, whether the member is legitimately subject to \nexpedited removal or not.  This is so for several reasons.   \nFirst, any member who is a citizen of the United States, a lawful permanent \nresident, a refugee, an asylee, or a holder of a valid visa—all of whom have a legal \nright to remain in the United States—would undeniably experience severe and \nirremediable harm if they were improperly removed from this country.  And by \npresenting sworn declarations such as the ones that the Court has described, Plaintiffs \nhave established that such mistakes do happen, which supports an inference that \nexpanding expedited removal in the manner prescribed by the July 23rd Notice would \nsubject a not-insignificant number of such individuals to speedy and erroneous \ndeportation, given the scale of the expansion of expedited removal from its previous \nscope.  See, e.g., 84 Fed. Reg. at 35,411 (indicating DHS’s intention to subject \n“hundreds of thousands” of non-citizens to rapid removal).   \nSecond, Plaintiffs’ evidence is also sufficient to establish that those non-citizen\nmembers who meet the New Designation criteria, but would otherwise be subject to \ndeportation only via traditional removal procedures, face irreparable harm as well, due \nto the delta between what the law requires with respect to the traditional process and the \nprocess that might be afforded to them if they are encountered by immigration officers \nnow.  For example, existing DHS regulations governing expedited removal requires the \ndetention of its subjects, see 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(iii), where traditional proceedings \ndo not, see id. § 236.1(b) (authorizing, but not requiring, arrest and detention pursuant \nto a warrant); see also Ramirez v. USCIS, 310 F. Supp. 3d 7, 31 (D.D.C. 2018) (finding \n99 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 102 of 126\nthat plaintiffs faced irreparable harm from detention that “surely cannot be remediated \nafter the fact”).  Additionally, and significantly, even an undocumented non-citizen who \nhas no defense to the charge that he is in this country illegally gets a few more hours to \nspend with his family and friends, and to wind up his personal affairs, under the \ntraditional removal procedures, whereas the hallmark of the expedited removal process \nis that the person is ordered removed to their home country quickly, “without further \nhearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \nAsk anyone who is facing the potentially abrupt termination of a close, personal \nrelationship with another person whether more time with that person makes a \ndifference.  Likewise, if that bond is already broken, ask whether, if instead of extra \ntime, she could bank a dime for each missed second that she would have spent in that \nperson’s presence—would the cash be sufficient to compensate her fully for the loss?  \nThis Court has no doubt that there is no adequate legal remedy to make those who are \nforced to leave, or those who are left behind, completely whole in the wake of a forcible \nejection without warning, which is, in fact, the policy that DHS says it will execute on a \nwidespread basis, unless this Court grants Plaintiffs’ plea for interim emergency relief.  \n(See, e.g., Amicus Br. at 29 (documenting traumatic experiences of children whose \nparents are suddenly and forcibly removed).)34  \n \n34 There is no doubt that Plaintiffs have primarily staked their claims on the alleged imminent injuries \nof their members.  (See Pls.’ Suppl. Br. at 5 (asserting associational standing).)  Thus, the Court is \nhard-pressed to conclude that harm to the organizations themselves from not being afforded the \nopportunity to participate in notice and comment rulemaking with respect to the July 23rd Notice \ncounts as the type of irreparable harm that warrants judicial intervention at this stage of the case.  \nMoreover, as the Court notes at the conclusion of this Opinion, it is not at all clear that the loss of the \nchance to provide comment is irreparable, since, if Plaintiffs win on their procedural claims, the July \n23rd Notice will be vacated, and the parties will have another chance to participate in a rulemaking that \nconforms to the mandates of the APA, should DHS seek again to designate a new class of \nundocumented non-citizens as subject to expedited removal.  (See infra, Part V.D.) \n100\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 103 of 126\nThird, and finally, it appears that the mere threat of being singled out and \nsubjected to the prospect of expedited removal and other similarly harsh DHS initiatives\nmay already be doing irreparable damage to settled immigrant communities.  Amici \nmaintain, for example, that “health care providers are finding that immigrant families \nare increasingly skipping health care appointments and abstaining from scheduling \nroutine prevention or primary care appointments for their children.”  (Amicus Br. at \n32);35 see also Cal Matters, Immigrants Afraid of Trump’s ‘Public Charge’ Rule Are \nDropping Food Stamps, Medical (Sept. 22, 2019).36 Thus, as the amicus brief makes \nclear, with respect to these kinds of potentially irreparable secondary effects, no \nspeculation is required.    \nDefendants counterarguments are cast, once again, in the broadest terms, and are \nagain based on general statements of law that are inapposite to the particular question \npresented.  Defendants do not engage at all with the actual record facts about the nature \nof its rule and its impact; instead, DHS says, essentially, that no effects have occurred \nyet as a result of the July 23rd Notice, because the agency has not yet opted to enforce \nthe policy.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n at 73 (“[T]hese vague speculations premised on \nsubjective, amorphous fears that some unidentified member could be subject to the \nimmigration laws of this country if the Executive decides to enforce the statute as to \nthem at some unknown time in the future fails to show irreparable harm.” (emphasis in \noriginal)).)  In light of the evidence that Plaintiffs have presented, all this Court can \n \n35 Citing The Children’s P’ship, Healthy Mind, Healthy Future: Promoting the Mental Health and \nWellbeing of Children in Immigrant Families in California, at 25 (Sept. 22, 2018), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/ChildrensPship-Healthy. \n36 Located at https://calmatters.org/economy/2019/09/immigrants-afraid-trump-public-charge-rule-food-\nstamps-medical-benefits/. \n101\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 104 of 126\nsay, in response to the agency’s contention, is something that the Court suspects the \nagency already knows:  Plaintiffs’ members’ fear is real—right now, today—and not at \nsome hypothetical, unascertainable time in the future.  (See, e.g., Amicus Br. at 32.)  \nMoreover, based on the statements that DHS itself has made, perhaps in an effort to \nwhip up that apprehension, Plaintiffs’ members’ fear of harm is not only realistic, its \nbroad effects cannot be remedied by the Court’s potential invalidation of the July 23rd \nNotice six months hence.  With children missing meals, and medicine not taken, it \nactually borders on preposterous for DHS to say that all Plaintiffs’ members need to do \nis wait until this case is over, and even if their loved-one has been shipped to \nGuatemala, they can launch a legal action, and receive the requested injunctive remedy, \nat that time.  (See AM Hr’g Tr. at 42:6–9, 43:23–44:3; PM Hr’g Tr. at 115:15–19.)  \nThis Court rejects that contention, and it further finds that Plaintiffs’ evidence, \nincluding amici’s brief, establishes ample grounds for an interim injunction to prevent, \ntemporarily, the enforcement of DHS’s legally dubious expanded expedited-removal \npolicy.  The Court reaches this conclusion on the basis of the record evidence that (1) \nsome of Plaintiffs’ members who are lawful residents of the United States would face a \nsubstantially increased risk of being erroneously removed; (2) some of Plaintiffs’ \nmembers who are undocumented non-citizens and therefore subject to the New \nDesignation could actually be removed through the expedited removal process, instead \nof traditional deportation procedures; and (3) many people, including Plaintiffs’ \nmembers, are being traumatized right now by the paralyzing fear of the agency’s \npersistent threat to invoke its potentially invalid rule and thereby foregoing necessary \nactivities of daily life.  Consequently, this Court finds, that in the absence of a \n102\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 105 of 126\npreliminary injunction that enjoins the agency’s enforcement of the July 23rd Notice \nduring the pendency of this case, Plaintiffs’ members will suffer irreparable harm.  \nC.  Both The Balance Of The Equities And The Public’s Interest Weigh In \nFavor Of The Issuance Of A Preliminary Injunction\nNow that the Court has concluded that the most significant factors of the \npreliminary injunction test—likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm—\nweigh in favor of granting the relief Plaintiffs seek, it turns to the last two factors, \nwhich require it to “balance the competing claims of injury[,]” and thereby “consider\nthe effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.”  Winter, \n555 U.S. at 24 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Court must also \nconsider whether granting a preliminary injunction is in the public’s interest.  See id. at \n20.  For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that each of these factors weighs in \nPlaintiffs’ favor as well. \nAs to the balance of the harms, the Court finds that the equities weigh in \nPlaintiffs’ favor, primarily due to the potentially significant harm to Plaintiffs’ \nmembers if the agency opts to enforce its rule while this litigation is pending.  The \nCourt has already described, at some length, how the July 23rd Notice might impact, \nand, indeed, is impacting, immigrant communities (even though the agency itself \nappears not to have taken these negative consequences into account before it adopted \nthis rule).  (See supra Part V.B; see also supra Part V.A.3.c.)  The Court also gleans \n(primarily from the States’ amicus brief) that the basket of harms that are likely to \noccur if the Court refrains from preliminarily enjoining the agency’s conduct includes \npotential damage to U.S. citizens, both inside and outside of communities that are \nheavily populated by immigrants.  (See, e.g., Amicus Br. at 26–28 (explaining that \n103\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 106 of 126\nsettled undocumented non-citizens “contribute to our economy and civic life in \ncountless ways”).)\nOn the other hand, it is not entirely clear what harm DHS will experience if the \nCourt enjoins its rule on an interim basis, except, perhaps, the sunk costs of any \ntraining expenditures that the agency has already made.  (See AM Hr’g Tr. at 35:10–\n14.)  Setting its sights much higher, DHS says that “[a]n injunction would inflict \nprofound harm on the government, and specifically, the allocation of ‘limited \ngovernment resources’ to deal with [the] ‘increasing number of aliens . . . apprehended \nwithin the United States.’”  (Defs.’ Opp’n at 72 (ellipsis in original) (quoting 84 Fed. \nReg. at 35,411).)  However, in light of the agency’s previously discussed lack of \nurgency with respect to enforcement of the New Designation (see supra, Part V.3.b), \nthe connection between enforcing this rule and preventing an onslaught of unauthorized \nentrants at the southern border seems tenuous, at best.   \nUndaunted, DHS also maintains that “an injunction would inflict serious harm on \nthe government because it would ‘take[] off the table one of the few congressionally \nauthorized measures available’ to remove the thousands of aliens arriving in this \ncountry illegally and absconding into the interior on a daily basis.”  (Defs.’ Opp’n at 72 \n(quoting Innovation Law Lab v. McAleenan, 924 F.3d 503, 510 (9th Cir. 2019)).)  That \nmight well be so.  But, of course, removing options is what injunctions against the \ngovernment actors do, in every case, whenever they are issued.  And, in this Court’s \nview, an injunction harms the government in the way that DHS argues only if the tool \nthat it is stopped from using is needed at the time the government seeks to use it.  Thus \ndespite DHS’s potentially accurate characterizations of the “crisis” at the southern \n104\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 107 of 126\nborder and the agency’s overall need to act, what is missing from the government’s \nshowing here is a clear link between the rule it has adopted and a problem, at the border \nor elsewhere, that the government’s enforcement of the rule will plainly solve, \nsupported by evidence that the problem is happening now, such that the government can \nargue, credibly, that it has to act during the pendency of this litigation.  Instead, \nDefendants’ counsel makes generalized representations about an overarching need to \naddress a complex issue that is primarily occurring in a geographical area that is not the \nsubject of the rule, and, again, the agency’s own conduct in delaying the \nimplementation and enforcement of its New Designation casts doubt on the agency’s \nclaims about its intention to enforce the new policy as a means of addressing the \nproblem it has identified.   \nThat’s not all.  Defendants’ stated concerns about the impact of a preliminary \ninjunction from this Court on the government’s ability “to remove the thousands of \naliens arriving in this country illegally and absconding into the interior on a daily basis” \n(id.) also appears not to be grounded in the evidence that the agency actually considered \nwhen it decided to issue the July 23rd Notice, or the proof that has been offered to \njustify that action in this case.  Defense counsel provides no record citations that \nsupport a contention of this nature in relation to the policy under review, and thus, this \nCourt cannot confidently conclude that an injunction against this particular agency \naction would so impede the government’s efforts at the border that it qualifies as a \nweighty and significant harm to the government, as Defendants’ brief maintains.  To the \ncontrary, with respect to any injunction that this Court issues while this case is pending, \nit seems most likely that DHS would just continue to experience the same delay in the \n105\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 108 of 126\nexecution of its New Designation policy that has been going on for a while.  And, \ncertainly, if DHS wins this case, it can proceed apace with whatever plan it has\ndeveloped to enforce the expanded expedited removal process.  What the agency has not \ndone, as yet, is cogently explain to this Court why an interim injunction should not \nissue because the government will be significantly harmed if it does not execute the \nchallenged policy now. \nBy contrast, primarily based, again, on the substantial harm that the Court has \nalready found would occur to Plaintiffs’ members and others if DHS is permitted to \nexecute the July 23rd Notice today, the Court concludes that the public-interest factor \nalso weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor.  As discussed above, the public has a significant \ninterest in avoiding the erroneous application of a policy that can result in the swift and \nlargely unreviewable deportation, without almost any procedural safeguards, of\nmembers of the public that have established strong ties to their communities.  In this \nCourt’s view, Defendants have not shown that that public interest is outweighed by the \npublic’s legitimate interest in “the efficient administration of the immigration laws at \nthe border” (id. at 72 (quoting Innovation Law Lab, 924 F.3d at 510; United States v. \nCortez, 449 U.S. 411, 421 n.4 (1981)), at least under the circumstances presented in this \ncase, and at this time.   \nSignificantly, Plaintiffs also assert that “the public interest is served when \nadministrative agencies comply with their legal obligations.”  (Pls.’ Mem. at 54.)  If the \nlength and force of the instant Opinion has not been sufficient to express the Court’s \nconclusions in this regard, it will underscore them now, by expressly confirming that \nthe Court agrees.  Particularly when the agency rule that is under consideration \n106\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 109 of 126\nimplicates non-trivial concerns about having one’s family members, friends, and \nneighbors potentially apprehended and swiftly deported—without the chance to check \nin, or to establish that they do, in fact, belong here—this Court cannot emphasize \nenough that the public’s interest in procedural safeguards against unconstrained \nadministrative agency action is especially strong.  See Batterton, 648 F.2d at 703–04.   \nD.  Defendants’ Argument That Any Injunction Can Only Restrict \nAgency Action As To These Plaintiffs Cannot Be Countenanced \nAt long last, we have arrived at the most peculiar argument that DHS has made \nin the rather long series of unpersuasive missives it has launched in opposition to \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction: its final assertion that, somehow, this \nCourt can—and, indeed, must—limit any injunctive relief that it issues to the agency’s \napplication of the facially defective rule to these plaintiffs, and these plaintiffs alone.  \n(See Defs.’ Opp’n at 75.)  The strangeness of this position derives, first and foremost, \nfrom DHS’s suggestion that the law requires this result, followed closely by the \nagency’s assumption that such tailoring is even possible in the context of a typical case \nthat involves a facial challenge to a rule that has been promulgated by a federal \nadministrative agency.  Even more troubling is the fact that DHS appears to be making \nthis argument on principle, and seemingly as part of a broader attempt to seek a \ndeparture from standard practices in the realm of administrative law.  See, e.g., East \nBay Sanctuary Covenant v. Barr, No. 19-cv-4073, 2019 WL 4265078, at *5 (N.D. Cal. \nSept. 9, 2019) (addressing Department of Justice’s argument that an invalid agency \npolicy could not be enjoined without geographic limitation, because to do so would be \nto issuing an impermissible “nationwide injunction”).  Ordinarily, in the wake of an \nunfavorable judgment from a federal court regarding procedural claims brought under \n107\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 110 of 126\nthe APA, agency actors willingly refrain from imposing on anyone the rule that a \nfederal court has found to be unlawful (at least during the pendency of the litigation, up \nto and including a prompt appeal).  But, in this case, as elsewhere, DHS appears to be \nengaged in a concerted effort to establish a precedent for judicial acquiescence to an \nagency’s continued application of rules that courts have invalidated.  \nIn this Court’s view, federal courts countenance that effort at their peril.  There \nis neither space nor time, at this point in this Opinion, for the Court to provide a full \nexposition of the range of actual and theoretical problems that DHS’s limited-injunction \narguments create.  It suffices to explain, relatively briefly, that the government’s \nlimited-injunction remedy is problematic, when applied in the context of a challenge to \nagency rulemaking that a plaintiff has brought on procedural grounds under the APA, in \nat least the three ways that this Court sketches out below.  In sum, and sternly put, the \nargument that an administrative agency should be permitted to side-step the required \nresult of a fair-fought fight about well-established statutory constraints on agency \naction is a terrible proposal that is patently inconsistent with the dictates of the law.  \nAdditionally, it reeks of bad faith, demonstrates contempt for the authority that the \nConstitution’s Framers have vested in the judicial branch, and, ultimately, deprives\nsuccessful plaintiffs of the full measure of the remedy to which they are entitled.\n*   *   *\nFirst of all, it cannot be disputed that both Congress and the D.C. Circuit have \nspoken directly to the “sharply limited” injunctive remedy that DHS pushes in this \ncontext (Defs.’ Opp’n at 75), and a good faith reading of the pronouncements of these \nbinding legal authorities establishes, indisputably, that DHS’s limited-injunction \n108\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 111 of 126\nargument is foreclosed.  Section 706 of Title 5 of the United States Code tells the\nfederal courts in no uncertain terms exactly what they must to do if they find that an \nagency’s “action, findings, [or] conclusions” are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law”; that is, “hold unlawful and set \naside” the facially defective agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(emphasis added).  DHS’s \nsuggestion here that the court must also sharply limit the scope of its injunction, by \nholding that the agency’s unlawful rule is to be deemed invalid only with respect to the \nplaintiff who appears in the case at bar, is nowhere in the statute.  And many years ago, \na prescient panel of the D.C. Circuit addressed this very issue and explained why that is \nso: the panel clearly stated, pursuant to “[t]raditional administrative law principles[,]” \nthat “[w]hen a reviewing court determines that agency regulations are unlawful, the \nordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that their application to the individual \npetitioners is proscribed.”  Harmon v. Thornburgh, 878 F.2d 484, 495 n.21 (D.C. Cir. \n1989).  \nNearly a decade later, in National Mining Association v. United States Army \nCorps of Engineers, 145 F.3d 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the D.C. Circuit went further, to \npoint out that its view of the traditional scope of the remedy when a court determines \nthat an agency rule is facially invalid under the APA—i.e., that the court must \ninvalidate the agency’s rule—was shared by “all nine Justices” of the Supreme Court as \nwell, and was best expressed by Justice Blackmun, writing in dissent in Lujan v. \nNational Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871 (1990): \nThe Administrative Procedure Act permits suit to be brought by any \nperson “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 702.  In some cases the “agency action” will consist of a rule of \nbroad applicability; and if the plaintiff prevails, the result is that the \n109\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 112 of 126\nrule is invalidated, not simply that the court forbids its application \nto  a  particular  individual.  Under  these  circumstances  a  single \nplaintiff,  so  long  as  he  is  injured  by  the  rule,  may  obtain \n“programmatic” relief that affects the rights of parties not before the \ncourt.\n \nNat’l Min. Ass’n, 145 F.3d at 1409 (quoting Lujan, 497 U.S. at 913 (Blackmun, J., \ndissenting)). \nNotably, both Justice Blackmun and the D.C. Circuit also addressed, and put to \nrest, the suggestion that the remedy called for by the APA necessarily constitutes a \ndisfavored “nationwide” injunction.  Justice Blackmun ably explained the difference \nwhen he emphasized that, if an agency’s rule is deemed facially invalid, then the \nappropriate remedy under the APA is for the court to prohibit the rule’s applicability in \nany and all circumstances, a ruling that unavoidably redounds to the benefit of parties \n“not before the court.”  Id. (citation omitted).  “On the other hand,” if a court concludes \nthat “a generally lawful policy is applied in an illegal manner on a particular occasion, \none who is injured is not thereby entitled to challenge other applications of the rule.”  \nId.  The D.C. Circuit similarly flatly rejected the defendant agency’s reliance on a case \nthat had cast doubt on the propriety of nationwide injunctions (Baeder v. Heckler, 768\nF.2d 547 (3d Cir. 1985)) to support the agency’s contention that “a court in some \ncircumstances may not order a nationwide injunction even after holding a regulation \ninvalid.”  Nat’l Min. Ass’n, 145 F.3d at 1409.  In response, the National Mining \nAssociation panel explained that Baeder “did not involve a facial challenge to the \nvalidity of a regulation; the Third Circuit [had] held simply that a sweeping injunction \nwould not be a proper remedy ‘in the context of [an individual plaintiff’s] claim for\n110\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 113 of 126\ndisability benefits.’” Id. (second alteration in original) (emphasis added) (quoting \nBaeder, 768 F.2d at 553).\nIn light of the unambiguous remedial requirements set forth in the APA, as \nunequivocally discussed by the D.C. Circuit in the National Mining Association case, it\nis hard for the Court to understand why DHS still insists that any injunction this Court \nenters “would need to be strictly limited to individual aliens who are members of the \norganizations currently in expedited removal and actually identified by plaintiffs in this \nsuit.”  (Defs.’ Opp’n at 75; see also PM Hr’g Tr. at 131:17–132:19.) To the contrary, \nthe mandate that a federal court must invalidate an agency rule if it discovers fatal \nprocedural defects that make the rule invalid on its face is spelled out plainly in section \n706 of the APA.  See O.A., 2019 WL 3536334, at *2.  Additionally, the bizarreness of \nDefendants’ unexplained suggestion that the required remedy for a procedurally invalid \nagency rule turns on whether the plaintiffs have “invoke[d] associational standing” \n(Defs.’ Opp’n at 75; see also PM Hr’g Tr. at 132:4–7) cannot be overstated.  Likewise, \nDefendants’ attempt to support its limited-injunction argument by constructing a \nconvoluted narrative in which section 1252(e)(3) of the INA somehow overrides \ntraditional understandings of what is supposed to happen when a federal court \ninvalidates an agency rule as violative of procedural mandates of the APA misses the \nmark.37   \n \n37 In this regard, DHS argues that the INA’s section 1252(e)(1) limits any available remedies to those \nprovided for in section 1252(e)(3), which DHS interprets to authorize only a “‘determination[]’ on the \nmerits of ‘whether [section 1225(b)], or any regulation issued to implement such section, is \nconstitutional’ or . . . ‘is not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in \nviolation of law.’”  (Defs.’ Opp’n at 76 (alterations in original) (ellipsis added) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(i), (ii)).)  Thus, DHS asserts that section 1252(e)(3) authorizes only declarative relief, \nand not injunctive relief.  According to DHS, only section 1252(f) provides for interim injunctive relief, \nand that provision prohibits the Court from “restrain[ing] the operation of the provisions of part IV of \nthis subchapter,” which includes section 1225(b)(1).  8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1); (see also Defs.’ Opp’n at \n111\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 114 of 126\nImportantly, the scope-of-remedy principle that is laid out in the APA and is \nechoed in the clear pronouncements of both the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit \nalso reflects a common-sense understanding of what it means for a court to determine, \nat the conclusion of a case, that a formerly binding legal act of one of the parties is null \nand void.  Take a contract, for example.  Imagine if, instead of promulgating a rule, \nDHS had drafted a contract that it intended to bind all of its affiliates throughout the \nentire country, but, as it turns out (after a bout of litigation), a court rules that there are \ndefects in the drafting of the agreement that render the contract invalid from the start \n(i.e., void ab initio).  It would be manifestly unreasonable for the agency to argue that, \nnevertheless, the contract should still be considered legally valid in some \ncircumstances, and that the court can only deem it invalid with respect to the particular \nplaintiff who brought the defect to the court’s attention.  With that peculiar argument, \nthe agency would, in effect, be seeking the court’s blessing of its continued application \nof the contract’s invalid clauses in all of the other circumstances in which the agency \nchose to apply it, despite the court’s pronouncements about the invalidity of the \nagreement (which, presumably, the agency might still opt to appeal, or not).     \n*   *   * \n  Second, although DHS actively promotes this limited-injunction proposal, it has \noffered little help as this Court has attempted to envision what the proposed “sharply \nlimited” injunction would look like in this context, as a practical matter.  (Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 75.)  The agency simply parrots the Supreme Court’s general statement (made in \n \n76).  Of course, the interim relief that Plaintiffs are requesting has nothing whatsoever to do with \nrestraining the operation of the statute.  And, in any event, DHS’s house of cards depends, almost \nentirely, on an interpretation of “determinations” in section 1252(e)(3) that seems implausible.  \n112\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 115 of 126\nanother context) that “[a] plaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s \nparticular injury.” (Id. (quoting Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1934 (2018)).) Even \nsetting aside the fact that a court’s invalidation of a procedurally improper rule actually \ndoes redress the injury that an APA plaintiff presents, DHS’s reliance on such generally \napplicable statements goes only so far, and it does not distract from the nagging reality \nthat federal administrative agencies promulgate rules in all sorts of contexts, and such \nrules regulate all sorts of conduct.  Indeed, a world in which this Court would be \nrequired to order an administrative agency to isolate the effects of a procedurally \ninvalid rule and terminate its impacts only with respect to a particular plaintiff has lots \nof slippery slopes.   \n  As an example, consider the request for a preliminary injunction that this Court \nevaluated in the case of Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 79 F. Supp. 3d 174 \n(D.D.C. 2015), aff’d 808 F.3d 905 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The plaintiffs in that matter were \n“two individual-plaintiff poultry consumers and an organization[,]” and they challenged \nthe United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service’s \npromulgation of new inspection procedures for poultry-processing establishments.  Id. \nat 178.  Before the Department of Agriculture’s new rule was adopted, regulations had \n“require[d] federal inspectors to be stationed at fixed points along the slaughter lines \nwithin poultry-processing establishments” and also “mandate[d] that the federal \ninspectors themselves control and direct the inspection process, including using sight, \ntouch, and smell to inspect each poultry carcass that travels down the line, with the \nassistance of the establishments’ employees.”  Id. (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs sought a \npreliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the newly promulgated regulations, \n113\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 116 of 126\nwhich required “far fewer federal inspectors [to] be stationed along the slaughter lines” \nand allowed “the employees themselves [to] conduct a preliminary screening of the \ncarcasses before presenting the poultry to a federal inspector for a visual-only \ninspection.”  Id. at 178–79 (citation omitted).   \nIn the actual Food & Water Watch case, this Court denied the plaintiffs’ \nemergency request that it enjoin the Department of Agriculture’s rule change, see id. at \n206, but as the Court struggles to contemplate DHS’s proposed limited-injunction \nremedy in the instant case, it finds it fair to ask: what if the plaintiffs in Food & Water \nWatch had prevailed?  Would DHS seriously maintain that the Court would have to \norder that the Department of Agriculture somehow find a way to have poultry-\nprocessing establishments inspect only those chickens that those particular plaintiffs—\none of which was an organization—would purchase (or consume?) in the manner \npreviously required, while otherwise allowing the agency to proceed to require poultry-\nprocessors to inspect all other chicken carcasses as required by the new regulations?  \nAnd could that agency ever, realistically, comply with any such requirement?   \nPerhaps, to avoid being held in contempt of the Court’s sharply limited \ninjunction, the Department of Agriculture could find a way to dispatch specified poultry \ninspectors to specified poultry processing facilities to examine poultry that was \nearmarked for the plaintiffs in accordance with the prior procedures, even as the bulk of \nthe nation’s poultry processing continued apace under the invalidated new rule.  But \nkeeping the plaintiffs’ poultry segregated from the rest throughout the entire chain of \nproduction could prove tricky, to say the least.  Plus, the sheer cost of maintaining both \nthe old and new world orders with respect to the demanding and detailed poultry-\n114\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 117 of 126\ninspection process would likely be prohibitive; thus, the plaintiffs would eventually \ncomplain that the agency was cutting corners and that, despite their right to have their \nchickens processed under the old rules, they were still at risk of having the new rule \napplied to the chickens delivered to their tables.  Calls for increased supervision, if not \nan outright ban, would likely follow, potentially resulting in the very same legal \nresponse that the plaintiffs initially asked for, and the agency decried.\nThis striking scenario suggests that, while it might sound good in theory to \ncontend that any injunctive relief must be “strictly limited” to the instant plaintiffs \n(Defs.’ Opp’n at 75), DHS has no good answer to the obvious practical problems that \npartial invalidation of agency rules—including and especially rules that pertain to food, \nair, and water—would pose.  Even the partial invalidation of the instant rule—i.e., an \ninjunction that would enjoin DHS from enforcing the July 23rd Notice’s expansion of \nexpedited removal procedures only with respect to “individual aliens who are members \nof the organizations currently in expedited removal and actually identified by plaintiffs \nin this suit” (id.)—would create nearly insurmountable practical problems, because to \nclaim their prize of not being subjected to expedited removal by court order, the \nundocumented non-citizens who are members of Plaintiffs’ organizations would first \nhave to identify themselves to the government, which, of course, is the first step in a \nchain of events that might well lead to their deportation (cf. PM Hr’g Tr. at 140:15–19 \n(statement of defense counsel that “[y]ou have members, you have won your case.  \nCongratulations.  Give us the names, they are not getting removed”)).    \nIt is clear beyond cavil, then, that whatever its merits as a theory, the remedy \nthat a federal court orders for an established violation of the law must also work in \n115\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 118 of 126\npractice.  And by this important measure, DHS’s proposed “sharply limited” injunction \nfalls far short.   \n*   *   * \n \n  Third, and finally, Defendants’ limited-injunction argument appears to reflect a \nspirit of defiance of judicial authority in the aftermath of defeat that is not easily \nreconciled with established constitutional norms or with standard, good faith practices \nthat seek to ensure that a successful plaintiff is made whole.  \nIn this regard, the jurisprudence that undergirds the Court’s concerns is well \nestablished.  It begins with the recognition that, while federal courts have limited power \nin the constitutional framework (i.e., they can rule only on the cases and controversies \nthat are brought to them), since the days of Chief Justice John Marshall, it has been \nuniversally accepted that federal courts do have the power to determine what the law is.  \nSee Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803) (“It is emphatically the province and \nduty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”).  Thus, in this respect, the \ncourts have the power to govern parties’ conduct going forward.  The conceptual \nproblem with Defendants’ proposed limited-injunction remedy is that, when considered \nin the context of a federal court’s review of agency action, it suggests that the court \ncannot, in fact, announce the governing legal principle or otherwise tell the agency \nwhat the law demands with respect to its behavior in the future.  Rather, DHS maintains\nthat a federal district court can identify only the law that the agency will be obliged to \nfollow in its dealings with the particular plaintiff who has brought that particular\ncase—a suggestion that simultaneously enlarges agency power and undercuts judicial \nauthority, by undermining the courts’ ability to rule with precedential force.\n116\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 119 of 126\nAnd, of course, where the authority of the judiciary is diminished, the power of \nthe executive branch expands.  At bottom, DHS’s position appears to be that an agency \nneed not curb its appetite for widespread application of an invalid rule that it likes, \nregardless of what a federal court has said.  Moreover, any agency that persists in \napplying a rule that a federal court has deemed facially invalid under the APA (so long \nit is not applied to the successful plaintiff) is undeterred even more broadly; that is, if \nthe agency can continue to impose preferred (yet procedurally invalid) rules on anyone \nwho is not that plaintiff, what incentive does it have to conform its rulemaking practices \nto the APA’s requirements going forward?  \nThus, because our constitutional system clearly contemplates that the judiciary \nwill have the power to check the conduct of executive branch officials who violate the \nlaw, DHS’s contention that the agency should be deemed to have the unfettered ability \nto carry on with respect to pronounced unlawful behavior—in the wake of a ruling by a \nfederal judge that the particular conduct at issue (i.e., enforcement of a procedurally \ninvalid rule) violates a federal statute, and before the case has run its course through the \ncourts of appeals—is quite troubling.  What is more, DHS makes the astonishing \nsuggestion that the Court itself should declare that, after a plaintiff successfully \nestablishes that an agency rule violates the law, the federal courts must stand \nimpotently by while the agency acts in direct defiance of that court’s legal \ndetermination by continuing to apply the invalid rule with respect to any person who is \nnot the individual who filed the legal action that is before the Court.  Given the \nhistorical legions of aggrieved plaintiffs who have rightfully turned to the federal courts \nfor enforcement of federal statutes that constrain illegal and harmful government action, \n117\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 120 of 126\nDHS’s limited-remedy claim has broad implications and is, quite frankly, untenable.  At \nthe very least, it appears that DHS’s efforts to champion an agency’s ability to press its \nprerogatives however it wants after being told specifically, by a federal court, that the \nlaw requires cessation of that behavior, conflicts with core constitutional norms.  \nMeanwhile, if a limited injunction does not incentivize the agency to rework the \ninvalid rule in accordance with the requirements of the APA (and why would it?), then \nthe plaintiff who wins in an APA lawsuit is deprived of the full measure of his well-\nearned right to enforce the statute’s mandates.  Here, DHS obscures this outcome, by \ninsisting that “an injunction as to aliens actually in expedited removal proceedings \nwho[m] Plaintiffs identify as dues paying members would provide them full interim \nrelief.”  (Defs.’ Opp’n at 75 (emphasis added).)  But that argument assumes that the \nonly thing that matters to a plaintiff who files a legal action under the APA is that, if \nhe’s successful, the agency cannot bind him with its invalid rule.  Considering the \nAPA’s procedural requirements, that assumption is unfounded.   \nRecall that the APA establishes the public’s right to have input into the \nrulemaking process and to be bound by agency rules that are the product of reasoned \ndecision making that has been informed by all of the relevant facts.  Thus, a plaintiff \nwho has sued to enforce those requirements seeks more than just the knowledge that the \nagency’s invalid rule will not be applied to him.  Indeed, that APA claim consists of the \ncontention that the plaintiff was improperly prevented from having a chance to \ninfluence agency decisionmakers before they promulgated the rule, and/or that the \nagency has exercised its discretion without taking relevant facts and circumstances into \naccount.  And if the agency keeps on applying its uncounseled, uninformed rule to \n118\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 121 of 126\nothers despite the plaintiff’s success in persuading the court that the rule is procedurally \ninvalid, then the plaintiff loses his shot of persuading the agency to craft the rule in a \ndifferent way, in light of additional information, which is precisely the procedural right \nthat the APA protects.    \nPut another way—and, in a sense, coming full circle, back to the core purposes  \nof the APA’s procedural mandates—to remedy an agency’s procedural violations of the \nAPA entirely, it is not enough for a court to prevent the application of the facially \ninvalid rule to a particular plaintiff, as DHS maintains, because the true gravamen of an \nAPA claim is not that the agency has exercised its discretion to select a policy with \nwhich the plaintiff disagrees and to promulgate a rule that the plaintiff does not \nendorse.  Instead, under the APA, the plaintiff’s claim is that the agency has breached \nthe plaintiff’s (and the public’s) entitlement to non-arbitrary decision making and/or \ntheir right to participate in the rulemaking process when the agency undertook to \npromulgate the rule.  Consequently, to provide the relief that any APA plaintiff is \nentitled to receive for establishing that an agency’s rule is procedurally invalid, the rule \nmust be invalidated, so as to give interested parties (the plaintiff, the agency, and the \npublic) a meaningful opportunity to try again.    \nVI. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons explained at considerable length in the preceding discussion, this \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction (ECF No.13) must be \nGRANTED, and therefore, Defendants will be PRELIMINARILY ENJOINED from \nenforcing the policy change that Acting DHS Secretary McAleenan implemented with\nthe July 23rd Notice, pending the outcome of the litigation before this Court, as set \n119\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 122 of 126\nforth in the accompanying Order.  Consistent with the language of the APA, the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, and established constitutional norms, the Court’s preliminary\ninjunction treats the expanded expedited removal rule laid out in DHS’s July 23rd\nNotice as void ab initio during the pendency of this action, based on the Court’s \npreliminary finding that Plaintiffs are likely to be successful on the merits of their APA \nclaims; that Plaintiffs’ members would be irreparably harmed by the challenged agency \naction in the absence of a preliminary injunction; and that both the public interest and \nthe balance of the harms weigh in favor of the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  \nConsequently, DHS is prohibited from applying the expanded expedited removal policy \nto anyone to whom it would apply, while this action proceeds, until further Order of the \nCourt.    \n \nDATE:  September 27, 2019  Ketanji Brown Jackson \nKETANJI BROWN JACKSON\nUnited States District Judge\n120\n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 40   Filed 09/27/19   Page 123 of 126\nAPPENDIX\n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a).

This case concerns the Trump Administration’s recent decision to dramatically \nexpand “expedited removal,” under which low-level Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \nimmigration officers summarily deport individuals from the United States without any court \nhearing or opportunity for meaningful review.  DHS deports individuals subject to expedited \nremoval soon after apprehension, without any opportunity to speak with an attorney; to gather \nevidence or call witnesses; or to present a claim for relief from removal, other than a truncated \nprocess for expressing fear of persecution.   \n2.  The expedited removal process is a major departure from a consistent, century-\nlong norm of providing all noncitizens within the United States with notice, access to counsel, an \nopportunity to prepare, and a contested hearing when they face removal.  Since it was created \ntwo decades ago, federal immigration authorities have only authorized the use of expedited \nremoval in limited circumstances: to noncitizens who are seeking admission at a port of entry, \nwho have been apprehended near the border shortly after they entered the country, or who arrive \nin the United States by sea.      \n3.  On July 23, 2019, without providing notice or an opportunity for public comment, \nthe Administration abruptly issued a new rule that dramatically expanded the reach of expedited \nremoval to individuals located anywhere in the country who cannot prove they have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for more than two years.  See Notice Designating \nAliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35409 (July 23, 2019) (“July 23 Rule” or “Rule”).   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 3 of 50\n4.  No prior Administration has authorized such broad use of expedited removal \nagainst noncitizens who have resided in the country for significant periods or who have been \napprehended in the interior of the country, far from the border.  And at least one prior \nadministration decided against expanding expedited removal in this way given concerns that it \nwould be illegal.1   \n5.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order that directed \nthen-Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly, to take action to apply expedited removal to \nthe group of people covered in the July 23 Rule.  Exec. Order No. 13767, Border Security and \nImmigration Enforcement Improvements, 82 Fed. Reg. 8793 (Jan. 30, 2017) (“Executive \nOrder”).   \n6.  Less than a month later, Secretary Kelly announced that he would issue a rule \nexpanding expedited removal.  However, DHS took no action for more than two years.   \n7.  On July 23, 2019, Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan issued the new rule. \nEffective immediately, it permits the use of expedited removal against noncitizens residing \nanywhere in the country who are unable to prove to an immigration officer that they have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for two years or more and who an immigration officer \nbelieves is inadmissible based on lack of valid entry documents, or fraud or misrepresentation in \nconnection with their entry.  \n8.  The Administration’s unprecedented decision to expand expedited removal to a \nvast group of noncitizens apprehended anywhere in the United States, and to noncitizens who \n                                                 \n1 Alan Gomez, Trump’s Quick Deportation Plan May Be Illegal, Past Immigration Chiefs Say, \nUSA Today (Feb. 26, 2017 1:00 P.M. ET), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/24/president-trumps-expedited-removal-\nplan-may-be-illegal/98276078/. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 4 of 50\nhave been living in the country for long periods, disregards twenty years of experience showing \nthat the expedited removal process, even at the border, is rife with errors and results in \nwidespread violations of individuals’ legal rights.  That experience shows that the government \nhas erroneously deported numerous individuals through expedited removal, including U.S. \ncitizens and individuals with bona fide fears of persecution in their countries of origin.  \nNumerous reports, including a comprehensive study commissioned by Congress, have \nextensively documented the widespread abuse and serious flaws in the expedited removal \nprocess.   \n9.  The unprecedented expansion means that low-level DHS officers can now \nimmediately subject hundreds of thousands of additional individuals to expedited removal, \nwithout any consideration of their family ties—including ties to U.S. citizen or lawful permanent \nresident family members—or their strong ties to their communities.  Countless more noncitizens \nwill likely have expedited removal erroneously applied to them, because current procedures \nplace the burden of proof on the individual to show that he or she is not subject to expedited \nremoval, yet fail to provide time or a meaningful opportunity for the individual to do so. \n10.  The Administration has taken this far-reaching step by publishing a directive in \nthe Federal Register, styled as a Notice, which took immediate effect upon publication.  In so \ndoing, the Administration bypassed the notice-and-comment and grace periods required by the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) for regulatory changes of this nature, depriving the \npublic an opportunity to comment prior to expansion even though it easily could have done so \nduring the two-plus years between the Executive Order and the issuance of the new rule.   \n11.  In addition to violating the APA, expanding expedited removal to individuals \napprehended in the interior of the United States who have been living in the country for extended \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 5 of 50\nperiods of time violates INA because the statute only permits the application of expedited \nremoval in the interior to those who have engaged in fraud and misrepresentation. It also violates \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it deprives them a meaningful \nopportunity and process to contest removal before they are deported. Likewise, the expanded use \nof expedited removal violates federal statutes requiring that noncitizens appearing before an \nimmigration officer or immigration judge be permitted to be represented by counsel.  \n12.  Expanding expedited removal is also arbitrary and capricious.  The \nAdministration has provided inadequate reasons to justify the decision to change the long-\nstanding policies, and has not considered, let alone addressed, the serious due process concerns \nand grave risk of error created by the expansion of expedited removal.   \n13.  The July 23 Rule is also unlawful because it violates the Homeland Security Act \n(“HSA”), Federal Vacancies Reform Act (“FVRA”), and APA.  Mr. McAleenan was not validly \nappointed to the position of Acting DHS Secretary when he issued the Rule, and accordingly any \nacts that he took were in violation of the HSA, the FVRA, the APA, and the DHS Orders of \nSuccession & Delegation.  The Rule is therefore invalid. \n14.  Finally, if there is no judicial review, by habeas corpus or otherwise, of individual \nexpedited removal orders, then the statute, as expanded, violates the Suspension Clause. \n15.  The July 23 Rule is illegal.  Without relief from this Court, hundreds of thousands \nof individuals living anywhere in this country are at risk of being separated from their families \nand expelled from the country without any meaningful process. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.   This case arises under the United States Constitution; the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 6 of 50\nU.S.C. § 1101 et seq. and its implementing regulations; and the Convention Against Torture \n(“CAT”), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. \n105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231), the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.; and the \nFederal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3345 et seq. \n17.  The Court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Section 1252(e)(3) is a \nprovision of the INA that provides jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia over “[c]hallenges [to the] validity of the system,” including regulations and \n“written” policies regarding expedited removal.  The Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331. \n18.   Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all \n§ 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  \nIn addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District and Defendants are officers of the \nUnited States being sued in their official capacity and reside in the District. \nPLAINTIFFS \n19.  Plaintiff Make the Road New York (“MRNY”) is a nonprofit, membership-based \ncommunity organization with five offices in the New York area, located in Brooklyn, Queens, \nStaten Island, and in Suffolk and Westchester Counties.  \n20.  MRNY’s mission is to build the power of immigrant and working class \ncommunities to achieve dignity and justice.  \n21.  MRNY’s members are subject to the July 23 Rule’s expansion of expedited \nremoval.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 7 of 50\n22.

Wolf is sued in his official capacity as the Acting Secretary of \nDHS.  In this capacity, he directs each of the component agencies within DHS, including United \nStates Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), United States Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”), and United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).  In \nhis official capacity, Defendant Wolf is responsible for the administration of the immigration \nlaws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103 and is empowered to designate categories of noncitizens \nsubject to expedited removal and to grant asylum or other relief. \n29.  Defendant Tony H. Pham is sued in his official capacity as Senior Official \nPerforming the Duties of the Director of ICE, which is the agency responsible for the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 8 of 50\nenforcement of the immigration laws, including the apprehension and detention of noncitizens, in \nthe interior of the United States.   \n30.  Defendant Mark A. Morgan is sued in his official capacity as Senior Official \nPerforming the Duties of the Commissioner of CBP, the agency responsible for the initial \nprocessing and detention of noncitizens who are apprehended at or near the border and placed in \nexpedited removal proceedings.  \n31.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is sued in his official capacity as the Senior \nOfficial Performing the Duties of the Director of USCIS, which is the agency that, through its \nasylum officers, conducts interviews of certain individuals placed in the expedited removal \nprocess to determine whether they have a credible fear of persecution and therefore are entitled \nto have a hearing before an immigration judge in which they can apply for relief and protection \nfrom removal.  \n32.  Defendant William P. Barr is sued in his official capacity as the Attorney General \nof the United States.  In this capacity, he is responsible for the administration of the immigration \nlaws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, oversees the Executive Office for Immigration Review \n(“EOIR”) (the administrative immigration court system), and is empowered to grant asylum or \nother relief. \nFACTS \nA.  The Trump Administration’s Decision to Expand Expedited Removal. \n33.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Border \nSecurity and Immigration Enforcement Improvements.”  In relevant part, the Executive Order \nemphasizes that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch to . . . expedite determinations of \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 9 of 50\napprehended individuals’ claims of eligibility to remain in the United States.”  See Executive \nOrder, §§ 1, 2(c). \n34.  Consistent with the President’s goal of deporting millions of immigrants from the \nUnited States,2 section 11(c) of the Executive Order directs the DHS Secretary to take action to \napply expedited removal to certain noncitizens arrested anywhere within the United States who \nhave been continuously present for less than two years: “[p]ursuant to section \n235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary [of Homeland Security] shall take appropriate \naction to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section \n235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) \n[8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) (A)(iii)(I)].” \n35.  On February 20, 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum \naddressing the expansion of expedited removal.  John Kelly, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \nMemorandum Implementing the President’s Border Security and Immigration Enforcement \nImprovements Policies 5-7 (2017).  The Secretary stated: “To ensure the prompt removal of \naliens apprehended soon after crossing the border illegally, the Department will publish in the \nFederal Register a new Notice Designating Aliens Subject to Expedited Removal Under Section \n235(b)(l)(a)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which may, to the extent I determine is \nappropriate, depart from the limitations set forth in the designation currently in force.”  Id. at 7. \n36.  More than two years later, on July 23, 2019, DHS published a Federal Register \nNotice that authorized the application of expedited removal to certain noncitizens arrested \n                                                 \n2 Amy B. Wang, Donald Trump Plans To Immediately Deport 2 million to 3 million \nUndocumented Immigrants, Wash. Post (Nov. 14, 2016), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/13/donald-trump-plans-to-\nimmediately-deport-2-to-3-million-undocumented-immigrants/. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 10 of 50\nanywhere in the country who cannot show “to the satisfaction of an immigration officer” that \nthey have been continuously present in the United States for longer than two years.  See July 23 \nRule, 84 Fed. Reg. at 35409.  \n37.  As a result, hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who have resided in the country \nfor less than two years continuously are at imminent risk of deportation without any hearing or \nmeaningful review, regardless of their ties to the United States, or the availability of claims for \nrelief from and defenses to removal.  Even individuals who are not properly subject to expedited \nremoval (for example, U.S. citizens or individuals who have been continuously present for more \nthan two years)—or to removal at all—can be summarily removed if they are unable to prove \nthat fact to the satisfaction of an immigration officer. \n38.  DHS declared that the July 23 Rule would go into effect immediately, without \nproviding any advance notice or public comment period, even though the government waited to \nact for over 30 months from the January 25, 2017 Executive Order that originally announced its \nintention to expand expedited removal. \n39.  There are no special circumstances that would justify the government’s failure to \nprovide advance notice of its decision, and to allow for and respond to public comment prior to \nthe effective date of the expansion.  The Rule cites only a generalized “concern[] that delayed \nimplementation could lead to a surge in migration across the southern border during a notice-\nand-comment period.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 35413.  But the Rule does not cite a single piece of \nevidence to support such a concern.  And the government already has sufficient tools to cope \nwith any such imagined “surge,” without expanding expedited removal, including the pre-\nexisting expedited removal scheme, which has applied to recent entrants to the United States for \nthe past fifteen years.     \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 11 of 50\n40.  On August 28, 2019, Defendants disclosed for the first time a guidance document \nissued by then-Acting Director of ICE, Matthew T. Albence, dated July 24, 2019 and titled \n“Implementation of July 2019 Designation of Aliens Subject to Expedited Removal.”  ECF 25-1.  \n(“July 24 Memorandum”). The July 24 Memorandum is directed to “ICE Employees” and \n“anticipate[s] that ICE immigration officers will not begin processing expedited removal cases \nunder [the new Rule] until on or about September 1, 2019.”   \n41.  Among other things, the July 24 Memorandum further states that “each applicant \nfor admission encountered by ICE following the [July 23 Rule] bears the affirmative burden to \nshow to the satisfaction of the encountering immigration officer” continuous presence for “the \ntwo-year period immediately preceding the date of the determination of inadmissibility by \nproviding evidence establishing the place, date, and manner of entry into the United States, and \ncontinuity of presence since that time.”  It provides examples of evidence that “may” \ndemonstrate continuous presence and allows an officer to permit an individual who “claims to \nhave such evidence . . . a brief but reasonable opportunity to obtain it or communicate with a \nthird party to obtain such evidence.”  The July 24 Memorandum also states that ICE officers \nmay—but need not–consider mental competency, connection to U.S. children, eligibility for \nrelief, or duration of presence, when deciding whether to place a non-citizen in expedited \nremoval. It reflects ICE’s view that there is no right to counsel for the new population subject to \nexpedited removal or right to judicial review. \n42.  On information and belief, Tony H. Pham, Senior Official Performing the Duties \nof the ICE Director, issued an additional memorandum in October 2020, and he and other agency \nofficials issued additional instructions, policies, and/or procedures regarding the implementation \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 12 of 50\nof the July 23, 2019 Rule.  Together these documents are hereinafter known as October 2020 \nImplementation Documents.3  \n43.  On information and belief, the October 2020 Implementation Documents direct \nthat implementation of the July 23 Rule will occur after training scheduled to conclude on \nOctober 16, 2020. \nB.  History of Expedited Removal. \n44.  The Administration’s decision to apply expedited removal to noncitizens who \nhave resided in this country for extended periods of time marks a significant departure from past \nimmigration policy and practice.   \n45.  Prior to 1996, noncitizens generally were entitled to a full hearing in immigration \ncourt before they could be removed, whether they were seeking entry at the border or had \nalready entered the country.  They also were entitled to administrative appellate review before \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA” or “Board”) and judicial review in federal court. \n46.  In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act (“IIRIRA”).  The Act generally retained the procedures for removal hearings \nfor all noncitizens—i.e., full immigration court hearings, appellate review before the BIA, and \nfederal court review.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a; 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a) et seq.  In these removal proceedings \n(commonly referred to as “Section 240” proceedings), the noncitizen has a number of procedural \nrights, including the right to an adversarial hearing before an Immigration Judge (“IJ”), and the \n                                                 \n3 See Hamed Aleaziz, ICE is Planning to Fast-Track Deportations Across the Country, Buzzfeed \nNews (Oct. 7, 2020), https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-fast-track-\ndeportations (noting creation and dissemination of memorandum by ICE Director Tony Pham \ninstructing as to implementation of expedited removal pursuant to the July 23 Rule).  By use of \nthe October Implementation Documents in this complaint, Plaintiffs refer to all documents \nimplementing the July 23 Rule, regardless of the actual date of issuance. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 13 of 50\nright to retain and be represented by counsel.  The noncitizen can contest the factual and legal \nallegations against him or her and apply for relief from removal, including asylum.  The \nnoncitizen also can move to terminate the proceedings or suppress evidence based on an \nunlawful arrest.  Moreover, noncitizens in Section 240 proceedings are entitled to an \nadministrative appeal to the BIA along with an automatic stay of deportation while the appeal is \npending, and to seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision by filing a petition for \nreview in the court of appeals. \n47.  IIRIRA also created the highly truncated removal process called “expedited \nremoval” for certain individuals coming to the United States who are inadmissible because they \nengaged in fraud or misrepresentation to procure admission or other immigration benefits, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), or they lack the requisite documents for admission at all, § 1182(a)(7).  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1). Expedited removal only applies to noncitizens charged under those \nspecific grounds of inadmissibility, and does not apply to noncitizens removable for other \nreasons. See 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1), (b)(3). \n48.  Noncitizens subjected to expedited removal are ordered removed by an \nimmigration officer “without further hearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \nIndividuals who express a fear of persecution or an intention to apply for asylum are entitled to \nan additional screening process, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), but nothing remotely approaching a \nfull immigration court hearing unless they pass the screening.  If they pass the screening, the \nexpedited removal order is cancelled and they are permitted to apply for asylum and any other \nform of relief or protection for which they are eligible in full Section 240 proceedings.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f); Imm. Court Practice Manual Chapter 7.4(d)(ii)(B). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 14 of 50\n49.  Congress initially authorized the use of expedited removal for individuals who \nwere applying for admission at a port of entry.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1). \n50.  IIRIRA also included a provision allowing the Attorney General to apply \nexpedited removal to individuals who had entered the country but had never been officially \nadmitted—i.e., individuals who had crossed the border without presenting themselves for \ninspection.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).  Under that provision, the Attorney General could apply \nexpedited removal to noncitizens residing anywhere in the United States who cannot prove to an \nimmigration officer’s “satisfaction” that they have been continuously physically present for two \nyears and were lawfully admitted or paroled into the country.  See \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6).  \n51.  However, IIRIRA provided that, before the Attorney General could apply \nexpedited removal to noncitizens apprehended inside the country, the Attorney General would \nhave to affirmatively designate which noncitizens would be included.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) \n(A)(iii)(I).4 \n52.  No prior Administration has ever sought to apply expedited removal as broadly as \nthis Administration.   \n53.  From the time the expedited removal provisions took effect in 1997 until 2002, \nthe government did not apply expedited removal to individuals who had entered the country at \nall.  Instead, it applied expedited removal only to inadmissible noncitizens arriving at ports of \n                                                 \n4 Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n(“INS”), under the direction of the Attorney General, ceased to exist and its functions were \ntransferred to DHS, effective March 1, 2003.  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. \n107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002).  As a result, statutory references to the INS or its \nofficers are deemed to have been replaced by reference to DHS or the applicable DHS official.  \nSee 6 U.S.C. § 557. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 15 of 50\nentry.  See Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Detention and Removal of Aliens; \nConduct of Removal Proceedings; Asylum Procedures; Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 10311 (Mar. 6, \n1997).   \n54.  In 2002, the government first invoked its authority to apply expedited removal to \npersons already inside the country, but limited application to a narrow group of individuals who \narrived by sea without being admitted or paroled and were apprehended within two years of \nentry.  See Notice Designating Aliens Subject to Expedited Removal Under Section \n235(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 67 Fed. Reg. 68924 (Nov. 13, 2002). \n55.  Beginning in 2004, the government authorized the application of expedited \nremoval to individuals who entered by means other than sea, but only if they were apprehended \nwithin 100 miles of a land border and were unable to demonstrate that they had been \ncontinuously physically present in the United States for 14 days.  See Designating Aliens for \nExpedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48877, 48879 (Aug. 11, 2004). \n56.  Thus, between 1997 and 2017, with the limited exception of noncitizens who \narrived by sea, immigration authorities never sought to apply expedited removal to noncitizens \napprehended far from the border, or individuals anywhere in the United States (including near \nthe border) who had been residing in the country for more than fourteen days. \nC.  The Expedited Removal Process. \n57.  The expedited removal statute provides that the process begins—and often \neffectively concludes—with an inspection by an immigration officer.  That officer must, first, \ndetermine if the individual is a noncitizen who is inadmissible because he or she has engaged in \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 16 of 50\ncertain kinds of fraud or lacks valid entry documents “at the time of . . . application for \nadmission.”  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), (iii) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7)). \n58.  If an individual claims to be a U.S. citizen, to have been admitted as a lawful \npermanent resident or refugee, or to have been granted asylum (in which case the individual \ncannot be subject to expedited removal), then the individual is entitled to limited additional \nreview.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(5). \n59.  Otherwise, if the officer concludes that the individual is inadmissible under an \napplicable ground, the officer “shall,” with the concurrence of a supervisor, 8 C.F.R. § \n235.3(b)(7), order the individual removed “without further hearing or review unless the alien \nindicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution.”  8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n60.  Thus, a low-level DHS officer can order the removal of an individual who has \nbeen living in the United States with virtually no administrative process—just completion of \ncursory paperwork—based only on the officer’s own conclusions that the individual has not been \nadmitted or paroled, that the individual has not adequately shown the requisite continuous \nphysical presence, and that the individual is inadmissible on one of the two specified grounds.   \n61.  At any time during the expedited removal process, the officer may permit the \nindividual to withdraw his or her application for admission and allow the person to depart the \ncountry without issuing an expedited removal order.  8 U.S.C § 1225(a)(4).  However, \nnoncitizens are seldom advised of this option. \n62.  For those who fear return to their countries of origin, the expedited removal \nstatute provides a limited additional screening.  But the additional screening does not remotely \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 17 of 50\napproach the type of process that asylum seekers receive in regular Section 240 immigration \nproceedings. \n63.  During the inspection process, if an individual indicates an intention to apply for \nasylum or expresses fear of return to his or her country of origin, the immigration officer must \nrefer the individual for a rudimentary screening interview with an asylum officer, referred to as a \n“credible fear” interview, to determine whether the individual should be able to apply for asylum \nand related humanitarian relief.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4); 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)-(e).   \n64.  To prevail at the credible fear interview, the applicant must show “a significant \npossibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of \nthe alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish \neligibility for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).   \n65.  Applicants who satisfy the credible fear standard have their expedited removal \norders cancelled by operation of law and are placed into Section 240 removal proceedings, where \nthey have the opportunity to apply for asylum and other relief from removal, present and cross-\nexamine evidence before an Immigration Judge, preserve objections, and appeal any adverse \ndecision to the BIA and court of appeals.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f); see also 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).   \n66.  Applicants who do not pass the credible fear interview may request review of the \ndecision by an IJ, but do not receive a full hearing or any subsequent administrative appellate \nreview.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II)-(III); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(1).  During the \ninspection and credible fear stages of expedited removal, DHS generally detains the noncitizen.  \n8 C.F.R. §§ 235.3(b)(2)(iii), (b)(4)(ii). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 18 of 50\n67.  An expedited removal order comes with significant consequences beyond \nremoval itself.  Noncitizens who are issued expedited removal orders are subject to a five-year \nbar on admission to the United States unless they qualify for a discretionary waiver.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(9)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 212.2.  Similarly, noncitizens issued expedited removal orders \nafter having been found inadmissible based on misrepresentation are subject to a lifetime bar on \nadmission to the United States unless they are granted a discretionary exception or waiver.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C). \nD. Widespread Flaws in the Government’s Expedited Removal Policies. \n68.  The government’s expedited removal policies already suffer from numerous \nserious deficiencies.  This expansion will only result in more erroneous removals and rights \nviolations.  Any individual may be apprehended by immigration authorities in any location and \nsummarily removed without a meaningful process to test whether that individual is properly \nsubject to arrest, to expedited removal, or even to removal at all.   \nFlaws in the Procedures for Inspection by Immigration Officers \n69.  Under expedited removal, an individual who seeks to contest many of the critical \nfactual or legal requisites for expedited removal—the lack of alienage, admission or parole, \ninadmissibility, or the requisite continuous physical presence in the country—receives no \nmeaningful opportunity to do so.  The individual bears the burden of proving certain critical \nfacts.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) (noncitizen must show continuous presence to \n“satisfaction of” immigration officer); 8 C.F.R §§ 253.3(b)(1)(ii) (burden on noncitizen to show \ncontinuous presence), (b)(6) (same as to parole or admission). The individual is not provided \nwith any time to prepare; any means by which to gather evidence, present witnesses, or review or \ncross-examine DHS’ evidence; nor any right to counsel recognized by the government or time to \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 19 of 50\nobtain counsel—all in sharp contrast to regular removal proceedings where individuals are \nentitled to such safeguards.  \n70.  For individuals who have been residing in the country for an extended period or \nwho are apprehended far from the border, the risk of error in the expedited removal process is \nparticularly high. \n71.  For example, DHS puts the burden on the individual to show “to the satisfaction \nof an immigration officer” that the length of the individual’s continuous presence makes the \nindividual ineligible for expedited removal.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II); 8 C.F.R \n253.3(b)(1)(ii). Thus, the government imposes a default presumption that, in the absence of any \naffirmative evidence, any individual arrested anywhere in the country is a noncitizen who has not \nbeen continuously present for two years or more.   \n72.  That presumption makes no sense when applied to individuals apprehended in the \ninterior of the United States.  Indeed, of the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants \nresiding in this country less than 4% arrived less than two years ago without having been \nadmitted or paroled.  That means that nearly 96% of the undocumented immigrants that DHS \nmight apprehend cannot properly be removed pursuant to expedited removal.  Yet, the Rule \npresumes all are subject to expedited removal, and requires them to show not only that they have \nbeen here for two years, but also that they have been here continuously in that period, in order to \navoid its application.   \n73.  Moreover, under the government’s policies, individuals faced with proving that \nthey have been continuously physically present in the United States for longer than two years are \nnot guaranteed any time or opportunity to gather evidence that would establish that fact.  That is \nso even though individuals who are going about their daily lives—attending religious services, \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 20 of 50\ntaking their children to school, attending community events, or even simply grocery shopping—\nare extremely unlikely to be carrying the necessary documentary evidence on their persons. \n74.  The government’s policies and interpretations of the statute and regulations fail to \nguarantee these individuals, who are detained during the inspection process, with time or any \nopportunity to gather the necessary evidence, nor even the ability to make a telephone call to \nsomeone who could help.  The inspecting officer is not required to make any independent effort \nto corroborate or verify any information, unless the individual makes a claim to U.S. citizenship; \nto lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status; or to having been admitted or paroled. \n75.  In addition, the government’s expedited removal policies fail to require that the \nimmigration officer assess individuals to ensure that they are mentally competent or otherwise \nhave the capacity to participate in the inspections process, and they fail to require additional \nsafeguards should an individual be found to have competency or capacity issues.   \n76.  Likewise, in the expedited removal process, a noncitizen’s removability is \ndetermined by a low-level immigration enforcement officer who acts as both prosecutor and \njudge, rather than by a neutral adjudicator, as required in regular removal proceedings.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n77.  In addition, the expedited removal policies fail to provide an opportunity for a \nnoncitizen to raise claims that his or her arrest violated a statutory or constitutional requirement. \n78.  Over the last two decades, extensive studies have demonstrated that the expedited \nremoval process deprives individuals of a meaningful opportunity to show that they are not \nsubject to expedited removal, or to removal at all.  The government is well aware of the \nwidespread inadequacies and flaws in the expedited removal process, and yet has failed to \nadequately address the problem.  Expanding this process to alleged noncitizens apprehended in \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 21 of 50\nthe interior of the United States and who are alleged to have resided in the country for up to two \nyears is certain to result in even more widespread erroneous removals. \n79.  For example, a 2005 study commissioned by Congress documented numerous \n“serious problems” in the expedited removal process “which put some asylum seekers at risk of \nimproper return.”  U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Report on Asylum Seekers in \nExpedited Removal: Volume I: Findings & Recommendations 4, 10 (2005), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/1GkjQfK (“2005 USCIRF Study”). \n80.   A 2016 follow-up study “revealed continuing and new concerns about CBP \nofficers’ interviewing practices and the reliability of the records they create, including: flawed \nBorder Patrol internal guidance that conflates CBP’s role with that of USCIS; certain CBP \nofficers’ outright skepticism, if not hostility, toward asylum claims; and inadequate quality \nassurance procedures.”  See U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Barriers to Protection: \nThe Treatment of Asylum Seekers in Expedited Removal 2 (2016), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2uydMQ8 (“2016 USCIRF Study”). \n81.  Specifically, multiple reports have documented that immigration enforcement \nofficers routinely make factual errors in completing the forms required for expedited removal.  \nAlthough the officers are required to take sworn statements from the individual, the sworn \nstatements that are recorded in the forms are “often inaccurate and nearly always unverifiable.”  \n2005 USCIRF Study, at 53, 55, 74; see also 2016 USCIRF Study, at 21.  The officer taking the \nsworn statement is often the person translating as well.  Asylum officers, who review expedited \nremoval forms in the course of conducting credible fear interviews, have reported that the forms \nfilled out by immigration enforcement officers commonly contain egregious inaccuracies.  See, \ne.g., Borderland Immigration Council, Discretion to Deny: Family Separation, Prolonged \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 22 of 50\nDetention, and Deterrence of Asylum Seekers at the Hands of Immigration Authorities Along the \nU.S.-Mexico Border 13 (2017) (“Borderland Report”), https://bit.ly/2ZxInuV (describing \nevidence “that CBP affidavits are often inconsistent with asylum-seekers’ own accounts”).  \n82.  Asylum officers also have reported seeing many forms with identical answers, \nand others with clearly erroneous ones—such as forms indicating that a male noncitizen was \nasked and answered whether he was pregnant.  See, e.g., 2016 USCIRF Study, at 20-22. \n83.  Such factual errors are the natural consequence of a system bereft of necessary \nprocedural protections.  Furthermore, the government’s expedited removal policies fail to \nprovide any adequate check against immigration enforcement officers’ failure to comply with \nrequired procedures, such as giving the individual an opportunity to review and respond to the \nstatements in the requisite expedited removal forms.  For example, asylum seekers commonly \nreport that immigration enforcement officers failed to read their statements back to them but \nnonetheless pressured them to sign documents.  See, e.g., 2016 USCIRF Study, at 20-22.  As a \nresult, individuals routinely are deprived of any opportunity to correct errors in their statements \nbefore signing. \n84.  Multiple reports have documented that immigration enforcement officers have \nroutinely employed coercive tactics to force non-English speaking individuals to sign expedited \nremoval forms in English, without any translation or interpretation.  For example, when one \nindividual refused to sign the expedited removal forms and asked to speak to a judge, the \nimmigration officer told him: “Here, I’m the judge, the attorney, and the one who is going to \ndeport you.”  American Civil Liberties Union, American Exile: Rapid Deportations that Bypass \nthe Courtroom 35-36 (2014) (“American Exile”), https://bit.ly/2GPKeE9; see also, e.g., \nBorderland Report at 13 (“[I]ndividuals are forced to sign legal documents in English without \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 23 of 50\ntranslation.”); American Exile, at 34-36 (describing noncitizens who were required to sign forms \nin languages they do not understand).  \n85.  Multiple other reports have documented immigration enforcement officers \nengaging in flagrant intimidation to pressure asylum seekers not to express a fear of return.  For \nexample, officers often accuse asylum seekers of lying, falsely tell asylum seekers that they have \nno right to seek asylum, inform asylum seekers that they will be jailed if they continue to assert a \nfear of return and refuse to sign the expedited removal order, or prematurely assert that the \nasylum seekers’ claim will not succeed. \n86.  The lack of any meaningful administrative review also contributes to errors.  For \nexample, although current regulations technically require a supervisor to review the issuance of \nan expedited removal order, that requirement is limited to review of the paperwork—which, as \ndescribed above, is often rife with errors and inaccuracies—and does not provide any \nindependent review of the facts or corroboration of the immigration officer’s representations.  \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(7).  The government also takes the position that expedited removal \norders are not subject to federal court review. \n87.  Among the most troubling problems is the widespread failure of immigration \nenforcement officers to refer noncitizens who express a fear of persecution for interviews with \nasylum officers, a problem for which the expedited review system offers no recourse.  As a \nresult, numerous asylum seekers have been erroneously removed without any opportunity to \nspeak with an asylum officer or apply for asylum. \n88.  A study commissioned by Congress found that in 15% of observed cases, when a \nnoncitizen expressed a fear of return to an immigration officer during the inspections process, the \nofficer failed to refer the individual to an asylum officer for a credible fear interview.  2005 \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 24 of 50\nUSCIRF Study, at 53-54.  Another study found that of the numerous individuals interviewed \nwho reportedly told a CBP officer of their fear of return, fewer than half were referred for a \ncredible fear interview before being summarily removed.  See Human Rights Watch, You Don’t \nHave Rights Here (2014), https://bit.ly/1GocBhZ (“[S]ome said that US border officials ignored \ntheir expressions of fear and removed them with no opportunity to have their claims examined; \nothers said border officials acknowledged hearing their expressions of fear but pressured them to \nabandon their claims.”).   \n89.  Numerous other reports have reached the same conclusion.  See, e.g., Borderland \nReport, at 12 (“CBP and Border Patrol officers in the El Paso Sector routinely and intentionally \ndiscourage people from seeking asylum.  In 12% of the cases documented for this report, \nindividuals expressing fear of violence upon return to their country of origin were not processed \nfor credible fear screenings and instead, were placed into removal proceedings.”); American \nExile, at 4, 32-33 (recounting that individuals subjected to expedited removal and interviewed \nfor the report indicated that “they told the agent they were afraid of returning to their country but \nwere nevertheless not referred to an asylum officer before being summarily deported”); Letter \nfrom Nat’l Immigrant Justice Ctr. et al. to U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Office of Civil Rights & \nCivil Liberties & Office of the Inspector Gen. at 12-22  (Nov. 13, 2014), https://bit.ly/1xfFsog \n(explaining that “[w]hen applicants express fears, CBP officials fail to capture those statements \nin the required documentation or include mistaken information,” and providing numerous stories \nof asylum seekers affected by CBP’s failures during the inspections stage of expedited removal). \nFlaws in the Credible Fear Asylum Process \n90.    Even where asylum applicants are referred for a credible fear interview, there are \nserious flaws in the government’s credible fear procedures.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 25 of 50\n91.  Although the credible fear procedures provide greater safeguards for asylum \nseekers than for other noncitizens placed into expedited removal, the procedures are inadequate \ngiven the complexity of asylum law and the fact that an overwhelming number of applicants are \ntraumatized, do not speak English, and are afraid to be candid at their interviews, especially \nwomen and children.   \n92.  For example, the asylum officer need not create a transcript or audio recording of \nwhat occurred at the credible fear interview, a particularly glaring procedural deficiency given \nthe translation problems and misunderstandings that routinely occur in asylum cases.  Instead, \nthe asylum officer must create only a written summary of the “material facts,” 8 C.F.R. § \n208.30(d)(6), see also 8 USC § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II), and a written record of “the officer’s \nanalysis of why, in light of [the] facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of \npersecution.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II).   \n93.  And, although the asylum officer is required to “determine that the alien has an \nunderstanding of the credible fear determination process,” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(2), the \ngovernment’s policies fail to require that the asylum officer or immigration judge assess \nindividuals to ensure that they are mentally competent and have the capacity to meaningfully \nparticipate in the credible fear process; they also fail to require additional safeguards should an \nindividual be found to have competency or capacity issues.  \n94.  Further, although the government recognizes that there is a right before and \nduring the asylum officer interview to consult with a third party, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4), the \ngovernment’s policies do not recognize a right to representation by counsel.  Nor do the \ngovernment’s policies recognize a right to counsel prior to or during the IJ review hearing of a \ndetermination that credible fear has not been shown.  As a result, the government’s policies do \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 26 of 50\nnot guarantee an individual the right to be represented by her own counsel, who could help the \nindividual identify and articulate the key facts relevant to a claim of persecution or torture, which \nis particularly important given the specialized nature of asylum and protection claims. \n95.  Significantly, although the credible fear standard allows the decision maker to \nconsider “such other facts as are known to the officer,” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), the \ngovernment’s policies do not impose any requirement that the asylum officer or IJ fully disclose \nto the individual all of the other facts that were considered, nor is there any requirement that the \nindividual be given an opportunity to respond to those other facts. \n96.  Further, although during the IJ review stage the judge “may receive into evidence \nany oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the review,” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1003.42(c), at no point in the process do the government’s credible fear policies provide an \nadequate opportunity to gather evidence, including expert testimony which could address \ncountry conditions and other key factual questions, such as whether the noncitizen is a member \nof a particular social group that is being targeted for persecution.   \n97.  The procedures are further flawed because, for the many individuals who are \nforced to proceed pro se, there is no obligation for the asylum officer or immigration judge to \nfully develop the record or advise the individual about what he or she must prove to prevail. \n98.  That the government’s credible fear policies are inadequate is reinforced by the \nwidespread evidence of failures in the credible fear process.  For example, advocates “regularly \nlearn of reports of legitimate asylum seekers who are denied ‘credible fear’—and the chance to \neven file an application for asylum—even though they should meet the standard and may be \neligible for asylum.  In some cases, interviews are sometimes rushed, essential information is not \nidentified due to lack of follow up questions, and/or other mistakes are made that block genuine \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 27 of 50\nasylum seekers from even applying for asylum and having a real chance to submit evidence and \nhave their case fully considered.”  Hearing before the H. Judiciary Subcomm. on Immigration & \nBorder Sec. at 5 (Feb. 11, 2015) (statement of Eleanor Acer, Dir., Refugee Protection, Human \nRights First), https://bit.ly/2OGFszm; see also, e.g., Letter from Am. Immigration Lawyers \nAss’n, et al. to Leon Rodríguez, Dir., U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., and Sarah Saldaña, \nDir., U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement 2-4 (Dec. 24, 2015) (“AILA Letter”), \nhttps://bit.ly/2Yr3DWF (“USCIS’ negative fear determinations are often flawed, with numerous \nsubstantive problems evident in the transcripts of initial fear interviews.”).  In some cases, \nmothers are called upon to reveal sensitive details of the persecution they faced—including \nphysical or sexual violence or abuse at the hands of other family members—with their children \npresent at their interviews; as a result, critical information is often not elicited during these \ninterviews. \n99.  These flaws are compounded by the lack of access to counsel.  Few individuals in \nthe credible fear process have the assistance of counsel or any other representative.  Those that \ndo often cannot be effectively represented due to restrictions on attorney participation and lack of \nnotice of key proceedings.  See, e.g., AILA Letter at 3 (explaining that immigration judge review \nof credible fear determinations “seldom involves attorney participation” because attorneys \nreceive notice of hearings either not at all, or with too little time to prepare and attend such \nhearings). \n100.  There are well-documented systematic inadequacies in interpretation services \nduring the expedited removal process.  For example, an unrepresented Guatemalan mother who \nwas persecuted based on her indigenous ethnicity was removed after an asylum officer \ninterviewed her in Spanish—a language in which she was unable to communicate—and issued a \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 28 of 50\nnegative credible fear determination.  Acer Statement at 6 (“This woman was deported from the \nUnited States under expedited removal before she could secure legal counsel.”); see also, e.g., \nReport of the DHS Advisory Committee on Family Residential Centers 96-99 (2016), \nhttps://bit.ly/2yFluu0 (discussing inadequate or nonexistent interpretation services during \ncredible fear interviews and immigration judge reviews of negative credible fear determinations); \nAmerican Exile, at 34 (“Most of the individuals interviewed . . . stated that they were given \nforms to sign in English, which most did not speak or read, and often were not interviewed by an \nimmigration officer who fluently spoke their language or through an interpreter.”); Borderland \nReport at 13; 2016 USCIRF Study, at 28 (describing the case of a detained Ethiopian asylum \nseeker who was denied an interpreter). \nErroneous Expedited Removals  \n101.  The result of the widespread flaws in the expedited removal process is that many \nindividuals have been erroneously removed from the United States. \n102.  For example, in 2014, a Mexican citizen who had been living in the United States \ncontinuously for 14 years was nonetheless removed under an expedited removal order after a \ntraffic stop in Weslaco, Texas.  DHS removed the individual even though, at the time of the \nincident, expedited removal could not be applied to individuals who had been in the country \nmore than 14 days.  American Exile, at 63. \n103.  DHS has removed multiple U.S. citizens pursuant to expedited removal orders.  \nSee Lyttle v. United States, 867 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1272-73 (M.D. Ga. 2012) (U.S. citizen \nerroneously issued expedited removal order); de la Paz v. Johnson, No. 1:14-CV-016 (S.D. Tex.) \n(habeas petition filed Jan. 24, 2014) (U.S. citizen erroneously subjected to expedited removal); \nIan James, Wrongly Deported, American Citizen Sues INS for $8 Million, L.A. Times (Sept. 3, \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 29 of 50\n2000), https://tinyurl.com/y4uulrds (recounting expedited removal of U.S. citizen Sharon \nMcKnight). \n104.  DHS also has erroneously removed numerous asylum seekers pursuant to \nexpedited removal orders.  For example, CBP removed a Guatemalan citizen and mother of four \nU.S. citizen children under an expedited removal order even though she told the officers that she \nwas afraid to be deported to Guatemala, where her father had been murdered and her mother had \nbeen the target of extortion by gangs.  Although the woman told the immigration officers that she \nwas illiterate, they forced her to initial that she had read their account of her interview, which \nincorrectly stated that she did not fear return.  She refused to sign the expedited removal order, \nbut was nonetheless deported to Guatemala, where she was later raped and shot by a gang.  \nAmerican Exile at 38.  In another example, a 22-year-old woman fled domestic violence in El \nSalvador and border officials arrested her in Texas.  Although a CBP officer asked her about fear \nof return, the officer never referred her to an asylum officer.  She was asked to sign forms in \nEnglish, with no opportunity to ask questions.  After she was removed to El Salvador, her ex-\nboyfriend continued to abuse her.  Id. at 39. \n105.  Defendants are aware of the flaws in the expedited removal and credible fear \nprocesses, including the lack of procedural protections.  Nevertheless, Defendants have acted to \nexpand a systematically deficient process to an even larger category of individuals, without \ntaking steps to address these well-documented problems.  Under expanded expedited removal, \nany individual apprehended anywhere in the country could be erroneously subjected to these \ntruncated and flawed procedures and mistakenly deported without a meaningful hearing.  Indeed, \nthe application of expedited removal to the interior of the country—far from the border—\nincreases the likelihood that citizens, noncitizens with lawful status, and noncitizens who have \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 30 of 50\nlived in the country for years or decades and are therefore eligible for relief from removal, will \nbe swept up in raids or other enforcement actions and mistakenly or arbitrarily subjected to \nexpedited removal.  Applying expedited removal to noncitizens who have significant ties to the \nUnited States and have resided in communities across the country for extended periods will \nexacerbate the existing widespread, systemic violations of constitutional, statutory, and \nregulatory rights in the expedited removal process. \nOverbroad Application of 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7) Present Without Inspection    \n106.  Expedited removal only applies to noncitizens who are inadmissible on one of \ntwo specified grounds:  8 U S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), which applies to those who seek to procure \nimmigration status or citizenship via fraud or false representations, or § 1182(a)(7), which \napplies to noncitizens who, “at the time of application for admission,” fail to satisfy certain \ndocumentation requirements to be subject to expedited removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(1). If \nDHS seeks to remove noncitizens based on other grounds, they must afford the noncitizen a full \nhearing before an immigration judge. See 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1), (3).   \n107.  Defendants read 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7) to encompass all noncitizens present in the \nUnited States without having been admitted. Under Defendants’ view, therefore, they can apply \nexpedited removal to noncitizens apprehended in the interior of the country by charging them \nwith inadmissibility under § 1182(a)(7), as long as the noncitizen cannot demonstrate two years \nof continuous physical presence. Defendants’ overbroad reading of § 1182(a)(7) is contrary to \nthe statute’s text, context, and history. Recently, the en banc Ninth Circuit, in a unanimous \nopinion, held that § 1182(a)(7) applies only to those noncitizens who lack documentation at “the \nmoment of applying for entry at the border,” not to noncitizens already present inside the \ncountry. Torres v. Barr, __ F.3d __, 2020 WL 5668478, at *6 (9th Cir. Sept. 24, 2020) (en banc). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 31 of 50\nE. Service as Acting Secretary of Homeland by McAleenan and Wolf \n108.  On December 6, 2017, Kirstjen Nielsen was sworn in as Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, having been appointed by President Trump after her nomination was confirmed by the \nSenate. Secretary Nielsen announced her resignation on April 7, 2019 and publicly submitted her \nresignation letter, which stated that it was effective April 7th, 2019. A few hours later in the day \non April 7, 2019, however, Secretary Nielsen announced by tweet that she had agreed to stay on \nas Secretary until April 10, 2019. \n109.  On April 10, 2019, former Secretary Nielsen issued an amendment to the DHS \nOrders of Succession & Delegation “in the event [she was] unavailable to act during a disaster or \ncatastrophic emergency.”  Department of Homeland Security, DHS Orders of Succession and \nDelegation of Authorities for Named Positions, DHS Delegation No. 00106 (Dec. 15, 2016), as \namended (Apr. 10, 2019).  \n110.  Former Secretary Nielsen’s purported amendments left intact the section of \nDHS’s succession orders that governed succession in case of the Secretary’s “death, resignation, \nor inability to perform the functions of the Office.”  Id.  Under that section, the next official in \nline to assume the role of Acting Secretary was Christopher Krebs, who then served as the \nSenate-confirmed Under Secretary for National Protection and Programs.  The next after him \nwas David Glawe, who then served as the Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Intelligence and \nAnalysis. \n111.  Contrary to the provisions of DHS’s succession rules, on April 11, 2019, Mr. \nMcAleenan, who was then the CBP Commissioner, purported to assume the role of Acting \nSecretary.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 32 of 50\n112.  Because Mr. McAleenan’s purported succession was unlawful under the HSA and \nDHS’s succession orders, he had no legal authority to serve as Acting DHS Secretary. \n113.  Because Mr. McAleenan was not validly serving as the Acting DHS Secretary, he \ncould not lawfully exercise the authorities assigned to that Office, including issuance of the July \n2019 Rule.  The Rule is therefore invalid. \n114.  On September 10, 2020, President Trump nominated Chad Wolf to be the \nSecretary of Homeland Security.  That day, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration (“FEMA”), Peter Gaynor, claimed the title of Acting DHS \nSecretary under the order of succession in place when Secretary Nielsen resigned. \n115.  Also on September 10, Gaynor amended DHS’s succession orders and purported \nto assign the Acting Secretary role to Chad Wolf, even though Gaynor did not resign as FEMA \nAdministrator or otherwise create a new vacancy in the role of Acting Secretary.   \n116.  On October 7, 2020, Wolf, claiming to be the Acting Secretary, purported to \nratify McAleenan’s July 2019 Rule expanding expedited removal. \n117.  Wolf did not have authority to ratify the July 2019 Rule.  5 U.S.C. § 3348 \nprohibits the ratification of actions, like the Rule, that are taken by improperly acting officials. \n118.  The ratification is also invalid because Gaynor lacked authority to make Wolf the \nActing Secretary.  An Acting Secretary lacks authority to amend the order of succession for the \nrole of Secretary.  And an acting official may not reassign the role without a new vacancy. \n119.  Thus, because neither McAleenan nor Wolf validly served as Acting DHS \nSecretary, their actions in issuing and ratifying the July 2019 Rule were contrary to law and \nviolated the HSA and FVRA.  Their actions also violate the Appointments Clause because they \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 33 of 50\nwere not statutorily authorized as an exception to the Clause’s requirement of Senate \nconfirmation. \nF. Harm to Plaintiff Organizations and Their Members. \n120.  Plaintiffs are nonprofit membership-based organizations whose missions include \nproviding immigration counseling and legal services to members and community members. \n121.  Make  the  Road  New  York  (“MRNY”)  is  a  nonprofit,  membership-based \ncommunity organization that integrates adult and youth education, legal and survival services, and \ncommunity and civic engagement, in a holistic approach to help low-income New Yorkers \nimprove their lives and neighborhoods.  MRNY has five offices in the New York area, located in \nBrooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and in Suffolk and Westchester Counties.  \n122.  MRNY has over 23,000 members residing in New York City, Westchester County, \nand Long Island.   \n123.  Members include noncitizens who have not been admitted to the United States and \nwho have been continuously present for between two weeks and two years, and are subject to the \nJuly 23 Rule expanding expedited removal.   \n124.  For example, MRNY-John Doe 1 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen.  He \nentered the United States without inspection in November 2018, and has been in the country since \nthen.  He is not in removal proceedings, nor does he have a final order of removal.   \n125.  MRNY-John Doe 2 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen. He entered the United \nStates without inspection in June 2019 and has been in the country since then. He does not have a \nremoval order.  He and his son were apprehended by ICE and released without a Credible Fear \nInterview or a formal grant of parole.  ICE provided him with a Notice to Appear for regular \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 34 of 50\nremoval proceedings, but that document has not been filed with an Immigration Court, and, thus, \nhe is not in regular removal proceedings.  He is required to report periodically to ICE.   \n126.  MRNY-Jane Doe 1 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen. She entered the United \nStates without inspection in June 2019 and has been in the country since then. She does not have \na removal order.  She and her children were apprehended by ICE and released without a credible \nfear interview or a formal grant of parole.  She was provided with a Notice to Appear for regular \nremoval proceedings, but that document has not been filed with an Immigration Court, and, thus, \nshe is not in regular removal proceedings.  \n127.  MRNY-John Doe 3 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen. He entered the U.S. \nwithout  inspection  in  September  2019.  He  was  apprehended  by  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) and released without a credible fear interview or a formal grant of parole. \nDHS provided him with a Notice to Appear charging him with being removable from the United \nStates, but that document has not been filed with an Immigration Court, and, thus, he is not in \nremoval proceedings. He has filed an affirmative application for asylum. \n130.   MRNY-Jane Doe 2 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen. She entered the U.S. \nwithout inspection in October 2019. She was not apprehended by immigration authorities; is not \nin removal proceedings; and does not have a final order of removal. \n128.  MRNY also has numerous members who have lived in the country for longer than \ntwo years, but would have difficulty affirmatively demonstrating two years of physical presence, \nparticularly if suddenly detained or given only a short period of time to do so, as is regularly the \ncase when expedited removal orders are issued. \n129.  The  expansion  of  expedited  removal  requires  MRNY  to  divert  the  time  and \nresources of attorneys that would otherwise be dedicated to assisting noncitizens in applying for \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 35 of 50\nforms of relief and in supporting MRNY’s core mission of building the power of immigrant \ncommunities.  For example, MRNY has created and disseminated informational materials about \nexpanded expedited removal in English and Spanish and begun community education efforts \naround expedited removal.  This has required numerous staff members’ time due to the lack of any \nclear standards around the expansion of expedited removal or the availability of judicial federal \ncourt review, which has left lawyers and organizers unsure of how to appropriately advise \nmembers and clients.  MRNY now frequently works with members and clients to identify whether \nthey may be at risk of being subject to expedited removal; how to prepare for encounters with ICE \nofficers; what documents may provide continuous residence; and whether and where to gather and \nmaintain those documents.  \n130.  MRNY is also harmed in its mission to empower immigrant communities to \nunderstand and assert their fundamental rights including the right to remain silent. MRNY’s \npublic-facing materials and trainings on immigrant rights often counsel that immigrants may \ninvoke the right to remain silent.  The expansion of expedited removal necessitates a wholesale \nrevisiting of these training materials—and the legal trainings that members, organizers and others \nreceive through MRNY—because individuals who exercise their right to remain silent now face \nthe possibility of wrongful placement into expedited removal, whether due to failure to assert a \nfear; failure to explain their manner of entry; or failure to affirmatively establish two years of \npresence. \n131.  MRNY members live in areas where encounters with ICE officers are common.  \nSince 2017, MRNY has assisted hundreds of families in the New York City area who have had a \nloved  one  detained  by  ICE.    Several  dozens  of  these  detentions  have  been  at  municipal \ncourthouses, where ICE arrests have become extremely common, particularly in New York City \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 36 of 50\nand Westchester County.  In addition, under the present administration, ICE regularly detains so-\ncalled “collateral” individuals when conducting home raids.  These detentions demonstrate the \nhigh risk of ICE detention faced by MRNY members and all undocumented New Yorkers.  \n132.  La Unión del Pueblo Entero (“LUPE”) is a membership-based community union \nbased in the Rio Grande Valley, in South Texas, near the United States-Mexico border.  The \nname translates to Union of the People. \n133.  LUPE has over 8,000 dues-paying members located in South Texas.  \n134.  LUPE members include noncitizens subject to the government’s expanded \nexpedited removal policy.  These members have been in the country for more than fourteen days, \nbut less than two years, and have not been admitted to the United States by an immigration \nofficer.   \n135.  For example, LUPE-Jane Doe 1 is a member of LUPE, and a noncitizen. She \nentered the United States without inspection on or about May 13, 2019, and has been in the \ncountry since then.  She has had no previous contact with immigration authorities. She intends to \nseek asylum in the United States, because she fears if she returned to Mexico she would be \ntargeted on account of her previous affiliations with the Mexican government.   \n136.  LUPE-Jane Doe 2 is a member of LUPE and a noncitizen, who entered the United \nStates without inspection in July of 2018, when her husband, who was living in the United \nStates, became seriously ill.  She is not currently in removal proceedings.  \n137.  LUPE-John Doe 2 is a member of LUPE and a noncitizen, who entered the U.S. \nwithout inspection on or about September 15, 2019. He has had no prior contact with \nimmigration authorities. In June 2020, he affirmatively applied for asylum. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 37 of 50\n138.  LUPE has members who have been in the United States for more than two years \nand have not been admitted to the United States, but who are at risk of wrongful placement into \nexpanded expedited removal if they exercise their right to remain silent if they come into contact \nwith immigration authorities or if the officer is not “satisfied” with their proof of continuous \npresence. \n139.  For example, LUPE-John Doe 1 is a member of LUPE and a noncitizen.  He entered \nthe United States without inspection in July 2017, and has been in the country since.  Even though \nhe has been in the country for just over two years, he fears being placed in expedited removal \nbecause he would not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate presence or would not have this \nevidence with him if placed in expedited removal. \n140.  LUPE members live in areas in South Texas with a large number of encounters \nwith immigration officers.  For example, LUPE has received reports about immigration officers \nstationed  in  low-income  Latino  neighborhoods  and  near  bus  stops  frequented  by  Latinos; \nimmigration  officers  have  also  conduct  workplace  raids  in  in  areas  known  to  have  Latino \nrestaurants.   \n141.  Expanded expedited removal has already required LUPE to divert staff members \nfrom their regular assignments.  LUPE will have to hire and train new staff members, to organize \nand conduct Know Your Rights presentations to inform the community as to the effects of the July \n23 Rule.   \n142.  WeCount! is a membership-based organization in South Florida. \n143.  WeCount! has approximately 200 dues paying members located in and around \nHomestead, Florida.   \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 38 of 50\n144.  WeCount! members have included and will likely include noncitizens who are \nsubject to the government’s expanded expedited removal policy.  These members have been in \nthe country for more than fourteen days, but less than two years, and have not been admitted to \nthe United States by an immigration officer.   \n145.  For example, WeCount! John Doe 1 is a member of WeCount! and a noncitizen. \nHe entered the United States without inspection in December 2017 and has been in the country \nsince then.  He has had no previous contact with immigration authorities.  \n146.  WeCount! has members who have been here for more than two years and have \nnot been admitted to the United States, but who are at risk of wrongful placement into expanded \nexpedited removal if they exercise their right to remain silent if they come into contact with \nimmigration authorities or if the officer is not “satisfied” with their proof of continuous presence. \n147.  WeCount!  members  are  the  target  of  frequent  enforcement  actions  in  the \ncommunities in which they live.  WeCount! members have been the target of home raids and \nworkplace raids.  \n148.  WeCount!  members  have  also  been  subject  to  other  forms  of  immigration \nenforcement, including stake-outs and traffic stops. \n149.   Expanded  expedited  removal  has  already  required  WeCount!  to  divert  staff \nmembers from regular assignments to address the effects of the expansion, including to organize \nand conduct information meetings to inform the community about the consequences of expanded \nexpedited removal, advise members how to collect documents to show sufficient presence, and \nhelp members to assemble those documents. \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 39 of 50\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553) \n \n150.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n151.

See \n5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b), (c).  The APA also requires that any substantive rule must be published at \nleast 30 days prior to its effective date.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(d). \n152.  Although styled as a “Notice,” the July 23 Rule is a legislative rule within the \nmeaning of the APA. \n153.  DHS did not comply with the APA’s procedural requirements when it made the \nJuly 23 Rule immediately effective upon publication.   \n154.  DHS did not comply with the APA’s procedural requirements when it issued the \nJuly 24 Memorandum.    \n155.  Defendants’ failure to provide for notice and comment violates 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 553(b) and (c).   \n156.  Defendants’ failure to publish the July 23 Rule 30 days before its effective date \nviolates 5 U.S.C. § 553(d).   \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution) \n \n157.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 40 of 50\n158.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall \n. . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . .” \n159.  Plaintiffs’ members who are at risk of being subjected to expedited removal are \nentitled under the Due Process Clause to meaningful process before they can be removed from \nthe country. \n160.  The July 23 Rule violates the Due Process Clause. \n161.  The July 24 Memorandum violates the Due Process Clause. \n162.  The procedures authorized by the October 2020 Implementation Documents \nviolate the Due Process Clause. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a), (b)(1); \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)) \n \n163.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n164.  The expansion of expedited removal denies people a meaningful process before \nthey are removed from the United States.  A meaningful process includes, inter alia, an \nopportunity to gather evidence necessary to establish they are not inadmissible and have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for more than two years, and an opportunity to consult \nor rely on the aid of others, including counsel, to otherwise challenge the application of \nexpedited removal.   \n165.  If the expedited removal statute is not interpreted to provide a meaningful \nprocess, it would raise serious constitutional questions.  \n166.  The July 23 Rule violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ \n1225(a), (b)(1) because it deprives persons faced with expedited removal of minimal procedures \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 41 of 50\nnecessary to ensure that the statute is administered fairly and consistent with constitutional due \nprocess. \n167.  Therefore, the July 23 Rule violates the APA because it is, inter alia, “not in \naccordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right,” and “without observance of procedure required by law . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A), (C), (D). \n168.  The July 24 Memorandum violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1225(a), (b)(1) because it deprives persons faced with expedited removal of minimal \nprocedures necessary to ensure that the statute is administered fairly and consistent with \nconstitutional due process. \n169.  Therefore, the July 24 Memorandum violates the APA because it is, inter alia, \n“not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or \nshort of statutory right,” and “without observance of procedure required by law . . . .” 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 706(2)(A), (C), (D). \n170.  The procedures authorized by the October 2020 Implementation Documents \nviolate the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225(a), (b)(1) because they deprive \npersons faced with expedited removal of minimal procedures necessary to ensure that the statute \nis administered fairly and consistent with constitutional due process. \n171.  Therefore, the October 2020 Implementation Documents violate the APA because \nthey are, inter alia, “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, \nor limitations, or short of statutory right,” and “without observance of procedure required by law \n. . . .” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C), (D). \n \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 42 of 50\nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362;  \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b), 706(1), (2); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)) \n \n172.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n173.  The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362, provides that “[i]n any \nremoval proceedings before an immigration judge,” the individual “shall have the privilege of \nbeing represented . . . .”  Section 1362 does not exempt expedited removal proceedings.  Where \nan asylum seeker requests review of a credible fear denial before an immigration judge, the \nstatute confers on them the right to representation by counsel of their own choosing. \n174.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), provides that “[a] person compelled to appear in \nperson before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and \nadvised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative. A party is \nentitled to appear in person or by or with counsel or other duly qualified representative in an \nagency proceeding.”  Individuals subjected to expedited removal procedures are compelled to \nappear in person before agency representatives.  Congress has not exempted expedited removal \nproceedings from this requirement. \n175.  Defendants’ application of policies restricting the participation of counsel for \nindividuals in expedited removal during both the immigration enforcement officer’s inspection \nand the credible fear process (including during proceedings in which an IJ reviews a negative \ncredible fear determination) to individuals described in the July 23 Rule violates 8 U.S.C. § 1362 \nand the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). \n176.  In addition, the July 23 Rule violates the APA because it is, inter alia, agency \naction “unlawfully withheld,” “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 43 of 50\nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” and “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law . . . .” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), (2)(A), (2)(C), (2)(D).  \n177.  The July 24 Memorandum fails to guarantee access to or participation by counsel \nfor individuals in expedited removal during both the immigration enforcement officer’s \ninspection and the credible fear process (including during proceedings in which an IJ reviews a \nnegative credible fear determination) to individuals described in the July 23 Rule, in violation of \n8 U.S.C. § 1362 and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). \n178.  In addition, the July 24 Memorandum violates the APA because it is, inter alia, \nagency action “unlawfully withheld,” “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” and “without observance of \nprocedure required by law . . . .” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), (2)(A), (2)(C), (2)(D).  \n179.  The October 2020 Implementation Documents fails to guarantee the opportunity \nto seek counsel, or participation by retained counsel, for individuals described in the July 23 \nRule who are in expedited removal, during both the immigration enforcement officer’s \ninspection and the credible fear process (including during proceedings in which an IJ reviews a \nnegative credible fear determination), in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1362 and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n555(b). \n180.  In addition, the October 2020 Implementation Documents violate the APA \nbecause they are, inter alia, agency action “unlawfully withheld,” “not in accordance with law,” \n“in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” and \n“without observance of procedure required by law . . . .” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(1), (2)(A), (2)(C), \n(2)(D).  \n \n \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 44 of 50\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n \n181.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n182.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n183.  Among other reasons, the July 23 Rule is arbitrary and capricious because, in \nadopting it, Defendants have failed to articulate a reasoned explanation for their decision, which \nrepresents a change in the agency’s longstanding policy; entirely failed to consider important \naspects of the problem; and offered explanations for their decision that run counter to the \nevidence before the agency.  \n184.  Among other reasons, the July 24 Memorandum is arbitrary and capricious \nbecause, in adopting it, Defendants have failed to articulate a reasoned explanation for their \ndecision, which fails to provide adequate protections to those subject to the July 23 Rule, entirely \nfailed to consider important aspects of the problem, and offered explanations for their decision \nthat run counter to the evidence before the agency.  \n185.  Among other reasons, the October 2020 Implementation Documents are arbitrary \nand capricious because, in adopting it, Defendants have failed to articulate a reasoned \nexplanation for their decision, which fails to provide adequate protections to those subject to the \nJuly 23 Rule, entirely failed to consider important aspects of the problem, and offered \nexplanations for their decision that run counter to the evidence before the agency. \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 45 of 50\nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Suspension Clause, Art. 1, § 9, cl. 2, of the U.S. Constitution) \n186.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n187.  Article 1, § 9, cl. 2., of the United States Constitution provides that the “Privilege \nof the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or \nInvasion the public Safety may require it.”    \n188.  Under the government’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \nthe July 23 Rule subjects individuals to expedited removal without federal court review of an \nexpedited removal order, other than with respect to the three determinations listed in 8 U.S.C. § \n1252(e)(2) pertaining to alienage, the existence of an order, and whether the individual was \nlawfully admitted for permanent residence, admitted as a refugee, or granted asylum.   \n189.  Under the government’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \nthe July 24 Memorandum subjects individuals to expedited removal without federal court review \nof an expedited removal order, other than with respect to the three determinations listed in 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(e)(2) pertaining to alienage, the existence of an order, and whether the individual \nwas lawfully admitted for permanent residence, admitted as a refugee, or granted asylum.   \n190.  Under the government’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \nthe October 2020 Implementation Documents subject individuals to expedited removal without \nfederal court review of an expedited removal order, other than with respect to the three \ndeterminations listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2) pertaining to alienage, the existence of an order, \nand whether the individual was lawfully admitted for permanent residence, admitted as a \nrefugee, or granted asylum.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 46 of 50\n191.  Depriving individuals of the right to seek judicial review of an expedited removal \norder violates the Suspension Clause.  \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Homeland Security Act (“HSA”), 6 U.S.C. § 113(g), the Federal Vacancies \nReform Act (“FVRA”), 5 U.S.C. § 3348, the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D), and the \nAppointments Clause) \n \n192.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n193.  The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the DHS Secretary the “sole and \nunreviewable discretion” to designate noncitizens for expedited removal.  8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \n194.  The issuance of the July 2019 Rule by Kevin McAleenan was an agency action.  \n195.  The issuance of the July 2019 Rule was an action taken in performance of the \nfunctions or duties of the Office of the DHS Secretary.  \n196.  Mr. McAleenan served as Acting DHS Secretary in violation of the HSA and the \nDHS Orders of Succession & Delegation.  \n197.  The July 2019 Rule has no force or effect because it was not issued by a validly-\nserving official.  5 U.S.C. § 3348(d)(1).   \n198.  It must also be vacated under the APA because Mr. McAleenan unlawfully held \nthe position of Acting DHS Secretary when he issued the Rule, and accordingly any acts that he \ntook were in violation of the HSA and the DHS Orders of Succession & Delegation.  \n199.  The July 2019 Rule should be enjoined as ultra vires agency action.  See, e.g., \nLarson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949).   \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 47 of 50\n200.  After Peter Gaynor attempted to appoint Chad Wolf as Acting DHS Secretary, \nMr. Wolf purported to ratify the Rule despite Mr. McAleenan’s lack of authority to issue the \nRule.  But the FVRA bars the ratification of invalid actions, like the Rule, that fall within the \nfunctions or duties of the Office of DHS Secretary.   \n201.  Moreover, Mr. Gaynor did not have authority to transfer the Acting Secretary role \nto Wolf, because acting DHS secretaries cannot amend the succession order, and because the \nActing Secretary role cannot transfer without a new vacancy.  Thus, for multiple reasons, Wolf \ndid not validly ratify the Rule. \n202.  Because neither McAleenan nor Wolf were authorized to serve as Acting DHS \nSecretary, and because the FVRA bars the ratification of the Rule, the Rule is ultra vires and \ncontrary to law and must be enjoined. \n203.  McAleenan’s issuance of the Rule without statutory authority also violated the \nAppointments Clause in Article II of the U.S. Constitution.  The Clause requires all Officers of \nthe United States to act pursuant to either Senate confirmation or an exception provided by \nstatute.  McAleenan was neither confirmed by the Senate nor authorized to act by any statute. \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7); Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)) \n \n204.   All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth  \nherein.  \n205.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) provides that a non-citizen who is “inadmissible \nunder [8 U.S.C. §] 1182(a)(7)” may be issued an expedited removal order.  \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 48 of 50\n206.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7) renders inadmissible “any immigrant at the time of \napplication for admission—(I) who is not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, \nreentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by this \nchapter, and a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or document of \nidentity and nationality if such document is required under the regulations issued by the Attorney \nGeneral, or (II) whose visa has been issued without compliance with the provisions of Section \n1153 of this Title . . . .” \n207.  An individual present in the interior is not inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(7) because “at the time of application for admission” denotes the time when a \nnoncitizen seeks permission to enter United States territory. \n208.  The July 23, 2019 Rule, July 24 Memorandum, and October 2020 Implementation \nDocuments violate the INA and are “not in accordance with law” and “in excess of statutory . . . \nauthority” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C), because they extend authority to place \ninto expedited removal individuals in the interior of the United States who have been physically \npresent for up to two years based on a determination that they are inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(7).  Such individuals may not be found inadmissible on this ground because they have \nalready entered the United States.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray this Court to: \na.  Declare the Federal Register Notice dated July 23, 2019 and the July 24 and October \n2020 Implementation Documents contrary to law;  \nb.  Enter an order vacating the Federal Register Notice and the July 24 and October 2020 \nDocuments; \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 55   Filed 10/19/20   Page 49 of 50\nc.

Enter an order enjoining and staying Defendants from continuing to apply expedited \nremoval to noncitizens who have been present in this country for longer than 14 days, or who \nhave been apprehended farther than 100 miles from the border; \ne.  Issue an order directing that, should Defendants seek to remove any noncitizen who has \nresided in the United States for longer than 14 days, or who has been apprehended more than 100 \nmiles from the border, Defendants shall place the individual in regular immigration court \nremoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. \nf.

See Notice Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal,” \n84 Fed. Reg. 35,409 (July 23, 2019) (“2019 Designation”). The 2019 Designation expanded the \nuse of expedited removal beyond its prior limits. Previously, expedited removal was limited to \nthose who had been in the country for up to fourteen days and were apprehended near the border, \nor those who had arrived by sea.  See generally ECF 56-1 at 2-12.  Plaintiffs filed this action on \nAugust 6, 2019 to challenge this unprecedented change.  See ECF 1.   \n1  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 02/04/21   Page 2 of 4\nOn February 2, 2021, President Biden directed the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, to review the July 2019 Designation.  See Exec. Order \n(Feb. 2, 2021), “Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to Address the Causes of \nMigration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, and to Provide Safe \nand Orderly Process of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border,” available at \nhttps://bit.ly/3joTRf5.  Section 4(b)(ii) of the Executive Order provides: \nThe Secretary of Homeland Security shall promptly review and consider whether \nto  modify,  revoke,  or  rescind  the  designation  titled  “Designating  Aliens  for \nExpedited  Removal,”  84  Fed.  Reg.  35,409  (July  23,  2019),  regarding  the \ngeographic scope of expedited removal pursuant to INA section 235(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \n1225(b)(1), consistent with applicable law.  The review shall consider our legal and \nhumanitarian  obligations,  constitutional  principles  of  due  process  and  other \napplicable law, enforcement resources, the public interest, and any other factors \nconsistent with this order that the Secretary deems appropriate.  If the Secretary \ndetermines that modifying, revoking, or rescinding the designation is appropriate, \nthe Secretary shall do so through publication in the Federal Register.    \n \nThe required review may result in the Secretary’s rescission of the 2019 Designation, pursuant to \nthe authority set out in in 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  If that is the outcome, then Plaintiffs’ \naction may be moot, at that time.  \nHowever, pending the ordered review, Defendants retain the authority to place \nindividuals into the expanded scope of expedited removal, as set out in the 2019 Designation.  \nThus, the case is not moot at this time.  See Singh v. Carter, 185 F. Supp.3d 11, 19 (D.D.C. \n2016) (“‘A case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief \nwhatever to the prevailing party.’”) (quoting Campbell–Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 136 S. Ct. 663, 669 \n(2016)).  To demonstrate that voluntary cessation of a challenged action has mooted a case, \nDefendants must show “(1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will \nrecur . . . and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects \n2  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 02/04/21   Page 3 of 4\nof the alleged violation.” DL v. District of Columbia, 187 F. Supp. 3d 1, 5 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \nThe Executive Order does not restrict or pause Defendants’ use of the authority set out in \nthe July 2019 Designation pending the ordered review.  Nor do the other actions taken by the \nBiden Administration fully restrict the use of the authority granted by the 2019 Designation.  On \nJanuary 20, 2021, then-Acting Secretary of DHS David Pekoske issued a Memorandum directing \n“a review of policies and practices concerning immigration enforcement [and setting] interim \npolicies during the course of that review.”  See January 20, 2021 DHS Memorandum Regarding \nReview of and Interim Revision to Civil Immigration Enforcement and Removal Policies and \nPriorities, available at https://bit.ly/3jjy0pp (“Pekoske Memorandum”).  The Pekoske \nMemorandum provides interim guidance on enforcement actions pending such review, as well as \na temporary moratorium on removals, the latter of which is currently stayed pursuant to court \norder. See Order, ECF 16, Texas v. United States, 21-cv-0003 (S.D. Tx. Jan. 26, 2021).  The \nPekoske Memorandum provides only interim guidance, and moreover places no limitations on \nenforcement actions – meaning arrests and placement in proceedings – or execution of removal \norders as to individuals who were not physically in the United States before November 1, 2020.  \nThus, the Pekoske Memorandum may not fully protect Plaintiff Organizations and their members \nagainst the use of the challenged Designation pending review. \nPlaintiffs welcome the announced review of the 2019 Designation. However, absent a \ncommitment to non-utilization of the 2019 Designation pending such review, Plaintiff \nOrganizations and their members continue to face the imminent threat of injury, and their claims \nremain live.  For that reason, this action should remain under active consideration by the Court. \n3  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 76   Filed 02/04/21   Page 4 of 4\nDated: February 4, 2021   Respectfully submitted, \n   \nTrina Realmuto*  /s/ Celso Perez \nKristin Macleod-Ball*  Celso Perez (D.C.

Plaintiffs separately request that, should the review not be complete at that \ntime, Defendants inform the Court as to the status and use of the designation pending review.   \nDefendants’ Position \nDefendants believe that the case should remain stayed pending review of the designation \nat issue in this case.  \n1.  As explained in Defendants’ prior submissions (ECF 75), several intervening \nevents impact this case. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order revoking \nExecutive Order 13768, Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States, issued \nJanuary 25, 2017. See Executive Order 13993 on the Revision of Civil Immigration Enforcement \nPolicies and Priorities, 86 Fed. Reg. 7051 (Jan. 25, 2021). Executive Order 13768 directed the \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 79   Filed 06/02/21   Page 2 of 8\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) to, among other things, prioritize the removal of certain \nnon-citizens described in 8 U.S.C. § 1225, the provision authorizing expedited removal of non-\ncitizens.  \n2.  That  same  day,  the  DHS  separately  issued  a  memorandum  directing  the  its \n“components to conduct a review of policies and practices concerning immigration enforcement.” \nSee Review of and Interim Revision to Civil Immigration Enforcement and Removal Policies and \nPriorities,  available  at \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/21_0120_enforcement-memo_signed.pdf \n(last accessed April 6, 2021).  Among other things, this memorandum identified interim civil \nenforcement  priorities:  national  security,  border  security,  and  public  safety,  and  directed \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to issue further interim guidance. Id. at 2.  \n3.  On February 18, 2021, ICE issued that guidance. See Interim Guidance: Civil \nImmigration  Enforcement  and  Removal  Priorities,  available  at \nhttps://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2021/021821_civil-immigration-enforcement_interim-\nguidance.pdf  (last  accessed  April  6,  2021). The  guidance  applies  to  “all  civil  immigration \nenforcement and removal decisions made after the issuance of this memorandum,” including \n“when and under what circumstances to execute final orders of removal.” Id. at 3. The guidance \nprovides that only certain categories of noncitizens will be “presumed to be priorities” for \nenforcement or removal actions, including noncitizens who (1) have engaged in or  are suspected \nof engaging in terrorism or terrorism-related activities or espionage or espionage-related activities, \n(2) unlawfully entered or were not physically present in the United States on or after November 1, \n2020, or (3) have been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) or \nan offense for which an element is active participation in a criminal street gang. Id. at 4-5.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 79   Filed 06/02/21   Page 3 of 8\n4.  In addition, on February 2, 2021, the President issued an Executive Order directing \nDHS to “promptly review and consider whether to modify, revoke, or rescind” the designation at \nissue in this case. Executive Order 14010, Creating a Comprehensive Regional Framework to \nAddress the Causes of Migration, to Manage Migration Throughout North and Central America, \nand to Provide a Safe and Orderly Processing of Asylum Seekers at the United States Border § \n4.b.ii, 86 Fed. Reg. 8267, 8270 (Feb. 5, 2021). The Executive Order also directed DHS to take \nreview numerous other policies impacting asylum, expedited removal, and the border, including \n“ensuring a timely and fair expedited removal process.” Id., § 4.b.i, see id, §§ 3, 4. \n5.  DHS previously anticipated completing that review by June 2, 2021. See ECF 76 \nat 3. However, in conjunction with its continued review of its policies, including other reviews \npursuant to Executive Order 14010, DHS’s review of the designation at issue in this case is \nongoing, and DHS now anticipates completing its review by or before August 2, 2021.  \n6.  In light of the foregoing, Defendants respectfully submit that the case should remain \nin abeyance, to allow the Department to complete review of its policies, including review of the \ndesignation at issue in this case, and to consider whether modifying or rescinding that designation \nis warranted. An abeyance will continue to serve judicial economy and prevent the expenditure of \nfurther resources by the Court and the parties, see Save Jobs USA v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 942 \nF.3d 504, 508 (D.C. Cir. 2019), and allow for further government action that may obviate the need \nfor any further proceedings in this case, including resolving the pending motion for preliminary \ninjunction. See, e.g., Wash. Alliance of Tech. Workers v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 650 F. \nApp’x 13, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2016). An abeyance also accords with the D.C. Circuit’s practice to hold \nregulatory challenges in abeyance when a change in administration occurs. See Am. Lung Ass’n v. \nEnvtl. Prot. Agency, No. 19-1140, 2021 WL 162579, at *9 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 19, 2021); accord Save \nJobs USA, 942 F.3d at 508. Finally, in the event Plaintiffs become aware that any of their members \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 79   Filed 06/02/21   Page 4 of 8\nare subject to an enforcement action resulting in possibly imminent removal during the pendency \nof any abeyance of this case, they can bring that to the government’s attention or, absent any other \noption, seek immediate relief with the Court.  \n7.  Defendants further propose that the parties submit a status report on August 2, 2021, \nsixty days from the date of this filing  (technically 61, but the 60th day is a Sunday), to update the \nCourt on the status of the designation. \n8.  Plaintiffs  have  separately  requested  that  “should  the review  process  continue \nbeyond August 2, 2021, Defendants provide the Court with specific information regarding the use \nof the designation pending the review process, including whether it has been used to place \nindividuals into expedited removal since the review process began, if so, how many individuals \nhave been placed into expedited removal pursuant to the designation during that time, and the \nintended use of the designation through the completion of the review process.” See infra, Plaintiffs’ \nPosition, ¶ 3. Defendants submit again that this request is premature and should be denied without \nprejudice to Plaintiffs’ raising the issue at the appropriate time after August 2, 2021. Should the \nissue ripen, Defendants do not oppose conferring further with Plaintiffs on their request as part of \ndiscussing whether any further abeyance is appropriate. Further, Defendants reiterate that should \nPlaintiffs become aware of any enforcement actions under the designation while the abeyance \nremains in effect, they may reach out directly to Defendants or, if necessary, file an appropriate \nnotice or motion with the Court.  \nPlaintiffs’ Position \n1.  Given  the  anticipated  completion  of  the  review  process  by  August  2,  2021, \nPlaintiffs agree that a further 60-day abeyance of the case is appropriate, and that the parties should \nsubmit a status report on August 2, 2021 to update the Court.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 79   Filed 06/02/21   Page 5 of 8\n2.   Plaintiffs are not aware of instances of the designation’s application while it has \nbeen under review.  But Defendants – not Plaintiffs – are in possession of complete information \nregarding the use of the designation, and are in the best position to inform the Court and the \nPlaintiffs in order to guide next steps, if any are needed.  \n3.   Therefore, Plaintiffs separately request that, should the review process continue \nbeyond August 2, 2021, Defendants provide the Court with specific information regarding the use \nof the designation pending the review process, including whether it has been used to place \nindividuals into expedited removal since the review process began, if so, how many individuals \nhave been placed into expedited removal pursuant to the designation during that time, and the \nintended use of the designation through the completion of the review process.  \n4.   Plaintiffs  have  previously  requested  this  information  from  Defendants,  most \nrecently prior to the June 2, 2021 JSR, and again in connection with the instant filing. Plaintiffs \nhave not received this information.  Given the length of the review process, Plaintiffs renew their \nrequest for an order directing Defendants to provide this information in connection with the August \n2, 2021 JSR should the review continue past that time. \n// \n// \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 79   Filed 06/02/21   Page 6 of 8\n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n    BRIAN M.

This case concerns the Trump Administration’s recent decision to dramatically \nexpand “expedited removal,” under which low-level Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) \nimmigration officers summarily deport individuals from the United States without any court \nhearing or opportunity for meaningful review.  DHS deports individuals subject to expedited \nremoval soon after apprehension, without any opportunity to speak with an attorney; to gather \nevidence or call witnesses; or to present a claim for relief from removal, other than a truncated \nprocess for expressing fear of persecution.   \n2.  The expedited removal process is a major departure from a consistent century-\nlong norm of providing all noncitizens within the United States with notice, access to counsel, an \nopportunity to prepare, and a contested hearing when they face removal.  Since it was created \ntwo decades ago, federal immigration authorities have only authorized the use of expedited \nremoval in limited circumstances: to noncitizens who are seeking admission at a port of entry, \nwho have been apprehended near the border shortly after they entered the country, or who arrive \nin the United States by sea.      \n3.  On July 23, 2019, without providing notice or an opportunity for public comment, \nthe Administration abruptly issued a new rule that dramatically expanded the reach of expedited \nremoval to individuals located anywhere in the country who cannot prove they have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for more than two years.  See Notice Designating \nAliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35409 (July 23, 2019) (“July 23 Rule” or “Rule”).   \n4.  No prior Administration has authorized such broad use of expedited removal \nagainst noncitizens who have resided in the country for significant periods or who have been \napprehended in the interior of the country, far from the border.  And at least one prior \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 3 of 39\nadministration decided against expanding expedited removal in this way given concerns that it \nwould be illegal.1   \n5.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order that directed \nthen-Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly, to take action to apply expedited removal to \nthe group of people covered in the July 23 Rule.  Exec. Order No. 13767, Border Security and \nImmigration Enforcement Improvements, 82 Fed. Reg. 8793 (Jan. 30, 2017) (“Executive \nOrder”).   \n6.  Less than a month later, Secretary Kelly announced that he would issue a rule \nexpanding expedited removal.  However, DHS took no action for more than two years.   \n7.  On July 23, 2019, Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan issued the new rule. \nEffective immediately, it permits the use of expedited removal against noncitizens residing \nanywhere in the country who are unable to prove to an immigration officer that they have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for two years or more and who an immigration officer \nbelieves is inadmissible based on lack of valid entry documents, or fraud or misrepresentation in \nconnection with their entry.  \n8.  The Administration’s unprecedented decision to expand expedited removal to a \nvast group of noncitizens apprehended anywhere in the United States, and to noncitizens who \nhave been living in the country for long periods, disregards twenty years of experience showing \nthat the expedited removal process, even at the border, is rife with errors and results in \nwidespread violations of individuals’ legal rights.  That experience shows that the government \nhas erroneously deported numerous individuals through expedited removal, including U.S. \n                                                           \n1 Alan Gomez, Trump’s Quick Deportation Plan May Be Illegal, Past Immigration Chiefs Say, \nUSA Today (Feb. 26, 2017 1:00 P.M. ET), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/24/president-trumps-expedited-removal-\nplan-may-be-illegal/98276078/. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 4 of 39\ncitizens and individuals with bona fide fears of persecution in their countries of origin.  \nNumerous reports, including a comprehensive study commissioned by Congress, have \nextensively documented the widespread abuse and serious flaws in the expedited removal \nprocess.   \n9.  The unprecedented expansion means that low-level DHS officers can now \nimmediately subject hundreds of thousands of additional individuals to expedited removal, \nwithout any consideration of their family ties—including ties to U.S. citizen or lawful permanent \nresident family members—or their strong ties to their communities.  Countless more noncitizens \nwill likely have expedited removal erroneously applied to them, because current procedures \nplace the burden of proof on the individual to show that he or she is not subject to expedited \nremoval, yet fail to provide time or a meaningful opportunity for the individual to do so. \n10.  The Administration has taken this far-reaching step by publishing a directive in \nthe Federal Register, styled as a Notice, which took immediate effect upon publication.  In so \ndoing, the Administration bypassed the notice-and-comment and grace periods required by the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) for regulatory changes of this nature, depriving the \npublic an opportunity to comment prior to expansion even though it easily could have done so \nduring the two-plus years between the Executive Order and the issuance of the new rule.   \n11.  In addition to violating the APA, expanding expedited removal to individuals \napprehended in the interior of the United States who have been living in the country for extended \nperiods of time violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, because it deprives \nthem a meaningful opportunity and process to contest removal before they are deported. \nLikewise, the expanded use of expedited removal violates federal statutes requiring that \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 5 of 39\nnoncitizens appearing before an immigration officer or immigration judge be permitted to be \nrepresented by counsel.  \n12.  Expanding expedited removal is also arbitrary and capricious.  The \nAdministration has provided inadequate reasons to justify the decision to change the long-\nstanding policies, and has not considered, let alone addressed, the serious due process concerns \nand grave risk of error created by the expansion of expedited removal.   \n13.  Finally, if there is no judicial review, by habeas corpus or otherwise, of individual \nexpedited removal orders, then the statute, as expanded, violates the Suspension Clause. \n14.  The July 23 Rule is illegal.  Without relief from this Court, hundreds of thousands \nof individuals living anywhere in this country are at risk of being separated from their families \nand expelled from the country without any meaningful process. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.   This case arises under the United States Constitution; the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 \nU.S.C. § 1101 et seq. and its implementing regulations; and the Convention Against Torture \n(“CAT”), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. \n105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242, 112 Stat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 \nU.S.C. § 1231). \n16.  The Court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).  Section 1252(e)(3) is a \nprovision of the INA that provides jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia over “[c]hallenges [to the] validity of the system,” including regulations and \n“written” policies regarding expedited removal.  The Court also has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 6 of 39\n17.   Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all \n§ 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  \nIn addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District and Defendants are officers of the \nUnited States being sued in their official capacity and reside in the District. \nPLAINTIFFS \n18.  Plaintiff Make the Road New York (“MRNY”) is a nonprofit, membership-based \ncommunity organization with five offices in the New York area, located in Brooklyn, Queens, \nStaten Island, and in Suffolk and Westchester Counties.  \n19.  MRNY’s mission is to build the power of immigrant and working class \ncommunities to achieve dignity and justice.  \n20.  MRNY’s members are subject to the July 23 Rule’s expansion of expedited \nremoval.   \n21.  Plaintiff La Unión del Pueblo Entero (“LUPE”) is a nonprofit, membership-based \ncommunity union with offices in several South Texas locations including San Juan, Alton, and \nMercedes.   \n22.  Part of LUPE’s mission is to advocate for fair, humane, and sensible policies that \nimpact immigrant communities.   \n23.  LUPE’s members are subject to the July 23 Rule’s expansion of expedited \nremoval. \n24.  Plaintiff WeCount! is a nonprofit, membership-based organization with offices in \nSouth Florida.   \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 7 of 39\n25.  WeCount!’s mission is to build the power of the immigrant community through \neducation, support, and collective action. \n26.  WeCount!’s members are subject to the July 23 Rule’s expansion of expedited \nremoval. \n27.  Defendant Kevin McAleenan is sued in his official capacity as the Acting \nSecretary of DHS.  In this capacity, he directs each of the component agencies within DHS, \nincluding United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), and United States Customs and Border \nProtection (“CBP”).  In his official capacity, Defendant McAleenan is responsible for the \nadministration of the immigration laws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103 and is empowered to \ndesignate categories of noncitizens subject to expedited removal and to grant asylum or other \nrelief. \n28.  Defendant Matthew T. Albence is sued in his official capacity as Acting Director \nof ICE, which is the agency responsible for the enforcement of the immigration laws, including \nthe apprehension and detention of noncitizens, in the interior of the United States.   \n29.  Defendant Mark Morgan is sued in his official capacity as the Acting \nCommissioner of CBP, the agency responsible for the initial processing and detention of \nnoncitizens who are apprehended at or near the border and placed in expedited removal \nproceedings.  \n30.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is sued in his official capacity as the Acting \nDirector of USCIS, which is the agency that, through its asylum officers, conducts interviews of \ncertain individuals placed in the expedited removal process to determine whether they have a \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 8 of 39\ncredible fear of persecution and therefore are entitled to have a hearing before an immigration \njudge in which they can apply for relief and protection from removal.  \n31.  Defendant William Barr is sued in his official capacity as the Attorney General of \nthe United States.  In this capacity, he is responsible for the administration of the immigration \nlaws pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1103, oversees the Executive Office for Immigration Review \n(“EOIR”) (the administrative immigration court system), and is empowered to grant asylum or \nother relief. \nFACTS \nA.  The Trump Administration’s Decision to Expand Expedited Removal. \n32.  On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled “Border \nSecurity and Immigration Enforcement Improvements.”  In relevant part, the Executive Order \nemphasizes that “[i]t is the policy of the executive branch to . . . expedite determinations of \napprehended individuals’ claims of eligibility to remain in the United States.”  See Executive \nOrder, §§ 1, 2(c). \n33.  Consistent with the President’s goal of deporting millions of immigrants from the \nUnited States,2 section 11(c) of the Executive Order directs the DHS Secretary to take action to \napply expedited removal to certain noncitizens arrested anywhere within the United States who \nhave been continuously present for less than two years: “[p]ursuant to section \n235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary [of Homeland Security] shall take appropriate \naction to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section \n                                                           \n2 Amy B. Wang, Donald Trump Plans To Immediately Deport 2 million to 3 million \nUndocumented Immigrants, Wash. Post (Nov. 14, 2016), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/13/donald-trump-plans-to-\nimmediately-deport-2-to-3-million-undocumented-immigrants/. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 9 of 39\n235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) \n[8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) (A)(iii)(I)].” \n34.  On February 20, 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly issued a memorandum \naddressing the expansion of expedited removal.  John Kelly, Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \nMemorandum Implementing the President’s Border Security and Immigration Enforcement \nImprovements Policies 5-7 (2017).  The Secretary stated: “To ensure the prompt removal of \naliens apprehended soon after crossing the border illegally, the Department will publish in the \nFederal Register a new Notice Designating Aliens Subject to Expedited Removal Under Section \n235(b)(l)(a)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which may, to the extent I determine is \nappropriate, depart from the limitations set forth in the designation currently in force.”  Id. at 7. \n35.  More than two years later, on July 23, 2019, DHS published a Federal Register \nNotice that authorized the application of expedited removal to certain noncitizens arrested \nanywhere in the country who cannot show “to the satisfaction of an immigration officer” that \nthey have been continuously present in the United States for longer than two years.  See July 23 \nRule, 84 Fed. Reg. at 35409.  \n36.  As a result, hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who have resided in the country \nfor less than two years continuously are at imminent risk of deportation without any hearing or \nmeaningful review, regardless of their ties to the United States, or the availability of claims for \nrelief from and defenses to removal.  Even individuals who are not properly subject to expedited \nremoval (for example, U.S. citizens or individuals who have been continuously present for more \nthan two years)—or to removal at all—can be summarily removed if they are unable to prove \nthat fact to the satisfaction of an immigration officer. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 10 of 39\n37.  DHS declared that the July 23 Rule would go into effect immediately, without \nproviding any advance notice or public comment period, even though the government waited to \nact for over 30 months from the January 25, 2017 Executive Order that originally announced its \nintention to expand expedited removal. \n38.  There are no special circumstances that would justify the government’s failure to \nprovide advance notice of its decision, and to allow for and respond to public comment prior to \nthe effective date of the expansion.  The Rule cites only a generalized “concern[] that delayed \nimplementation could lead to a surge in migration across the southern border during a notice-\nand-comment period.”  84 Fed. Reg. at 35413.  But the Rule does not cite a single piece of \nevidence to support such a concern.  And the government already has sufficient tools to cope \nwith any such imagined “surge,” without expanding expedited removal, including the pre-\nexisting expedited removal scheme, which has applied to recent entrants to the United States for \nthe past fifteen years.     \nB.  History of Expedited Removal. \n39.  The Administration’s decision to apply expedited removal to noncitizens who \nhave resided in this country for extended periods of time marks a significant departure from past \nimmigration policy and practice.   \n40.  Prior to 1996, noncitizens generally were entitled to a full hearing in immigration \ncourt before they could be removed, whether they were seeking entry at the border or had \nalready entered the country.  They also were entitled to administrative appellate review before \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA” or “Board”) and judicial review in federal court. \n41.  In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act (“IIRIRA”).  The Act generally retained the procedures for removal hearings \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 11 of 39\nfor all noncitizens—i.e., full immigration court hearings, appellate review before the BIA, and \nfederal court review.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a; 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a) et seq.  In these removal proceedings \n(commonly referred to as “Section 240” proceedings), the noncitizen has a number of procedural \nrights, including the right to an adversarial hearing before an Immigration Judge (“IJ”), and the \nright to retain and be represented by counsel.  The noncitizen can contest the factual and legal \nallegations against him or her and apply for relief from removal, including asylum.  The \nnoncitizen also can move to terminate the proceedings or suppress evidence based on an \nunlawful arrest.  Moreover, noncitizens in Section 240 proceedings are entitled to an \nadministrative appeal to the BIA along with an automatic stay of deportation while the appeal is \npending, and to seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision by filing a petition for \nreview in the court of appeals. \n42.  IIRIRA also created the highly truncated removal process called “expedited \nremoval” for certain individuals coming to the United States who are inadmissible because they \nengaged in fraud or misrepresentation to procure admission or other immigration benefits, 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), or they lack the requisite documents for admission at all, § 1182(a)(7).  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).   \n43.  Noncitizens subjected to expedited removal are ordered removed by an \nimmigration officer “without further hearing or review.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \nIndividuals who express a fear of persecution or an intention to apply for asylum are entitled to \nan additional screening process, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1), but nothing remotely approaching a \nfull immigration court hearing unless they pass the screening.  If they pass the screening, the \nexpedited removal order is cancelled and they are permitted to apply for asylum and any other \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 12 of 39\nform of relief or protection for which they are eligible in full Section 240 proceedings.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f); Imm. Court Practice Manual Chapter 7.4(d)(ii)(B). \n44.  Congress initially authorized the use of expedited removal for individuals who \nwere applying for admission at a port of entry.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1). \n45.  IIRIRA also included a provision allowing the Attorney General to apply \nexpedited removal to individuals who had entered the country but had never been officially \nadmitted—i.e., individuals who had crossed the border without presenting themselves for \ninspection.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).  Under that provision, the Attorney General could apply \nexpedited removal to noncitizens residing anywhere in the United States who cannot prove to an \nimmigration officer’s “satisfaction” that they have been continuously physically present for two \nyears and were lawfully admitted or paroled into the country.  See \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6).  As with noncitizens who presented at \nthe border, Congress specified that noncitizens in the interior could be subject to expedited \nremoval only if they were inadmissible for having committed certain forms of immigration fraud \nor lacking the required documents.   \n46.  However, IIRIRA provided that, before the Attorney General could apply \nexpedited removal to noncitizens apprehended inside the country, the Attorney General would \nhave to affirmatively designate which noncitizens would be included.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) \n(A)(iii)(I).3 \n                                                           \n3 Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n(“INS”), under the direction of the Attorney General, ceased to exist and its functions were \ntransferred to DHS, effective March 1, 2003.  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. \n107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002).  As a result, statutory references to the INS or its \nofficers are deemed to have been replaced by reference to DHS or the applicable DHS official.  \nSee 6 U.S.C. § 557. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 13 of 39\n47.  No prior Administration has ever sought to apply expedited removal as broadly as \nthis Administration.   \n48.  From the time the expedited removal provisions took effect in 1997 until 2002, \nthe government did not apply expedited removal to individuals who had entered the country at \nall.  Instead, it applied expedited removal only to inadmissible noncitizens arriving at ports of \nentry.  See Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Detention and Removal of Aliens; \nConduct of Removal Proceedings; Asylum Procedures; Final Rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 10311 (Mar. 6, \n1997).   \n49.  In 2002, the government first invoked its authority to apply expedited removal to \npersons already inside the country, but limited application to a narrow group of individuals who \narrived by sea without being admitted or paroled and were apprehended within two years of \nentry.  See Notice Designating Aliens Subject to Expedited Removal Under Section \n235(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 67 Fed. Reg. 68924 (Nov. 13, 2002). \n50.  Beginning in 2004, the government authorized the application of expedited \nremoval to individuals who entered by means other than sea, but only if they were apprehended \nwithin 100 miles of a land border and were unable to demonstrate that they had been \ncontinuously physically present in the United States for 14 days.  See Designating Aliens for \nExpedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48877, 48879 (Aug. 11, 2004). \n51.  Thus, between 1997 and 2017, with the limited exception of noncitizens who \narrived by sea, immigration authorities never sought to apply expedited removal to noncitizens \napprehended far from the border, or individuals anywhere in the United States (including near \nthe border) who had been residing in the country for more than fourteen days. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 14 of 39\nC.  The Expedited Removal Process. \n52.  The expedited removal statute provides that the process begins—and often \neffectively concludes—with an inspection by an immigration officer.  That officer must, first, \ndetermine if the individual is a noncitizen who is inadmissible because he or she has engaged in \ncertain kinds of fraud or lacks valid entry documents. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), (iii) \n(citing 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7)). \n53.  If an individual claims to be a U.S. citizen, to have been admitted as a lawful \npermanent resident or refugee, or to have been granted asylum (in which case the individual \ncannot be subject to expedited removal), then the individual is entitled to limited additional \nreview.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(C); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(5). \n54.  Otherwise, if the officer concludes that the individual is inadmissible under an \napplicable ground, the officer “shall,” with the concurrence of a supervisor, 8 C.F.R. § \n235.3(b)(7), order the individual removed “without further hearing or review unless the alien \nindicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution.”  8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n55.  Thus, a low-level DHS officer can order the removal of an individual who has \nbeen living in the United States with virtually no administrative process—just completion of \ncursory paperwork—based only on the officer’s own conclusions that the individual has not been \nadmitted or paroled, that the individual has not adequately shown the requisite continuous \nphysical presence, and that the individual is inadmissible on one of the two specified grounds.   \n56.  At any time during the expedited removal process, the officer may permit the \nindividual to withdraw his or her application for admission and allow the person to depart the \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 15 of 39\ncountry without issuing an expedited removal order. 8 U.S.C § 1225(a)(4).  However, \nnoncitizens are seldom advised of this option. \n57.  For those who fear return to their countries of origin, the expedited removal \nstatute provides a limited additional screening.  But the additional screening does not remotely \napproach the type of process that asylum seekers receive in regular Section 240 immigration \nproceedings. \n58.  During the inspection process, if an individual indicates an intention to apply for \nasylum or expresses fear of return to his or her country of origin, the immigration officer must \nrefer the individual for a rudimentary screening interview with an asylum officer, referred to as a \n“credible fear” interview, to determine whether the individual should be able to apply for asylum \nand related humanitarian relief.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4); 8 \nC.F.R. § 208.30(d)-(e).   \n59.  To prevail at the credible fear interview, the applicant must show “a significant \npossibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of \nthe alien’s claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish \neligibility for asylum.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v).   \n60.  Applicants who satisfy the credible fear standard have their expedited removal \norders cancelled by operation of law and are placed into Section 240 removal proceedings, where \nthey have the opportunity to apply for asylum and other relief from removal, present and cross-\nexamine evidence before an Immigration Judge, preserve objections, and appeal any adverse \ndecision to the BIA and court of appeals.  8 C.F.R. § 208.30(f); see also 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii).   \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 16 of 39\n61.  Applicants who do not pass the credible fear interview may request review of the \ndecision by an IJ, but do not receive a full hearing or any subsequent administrative appellate \nreview.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II)-(III); see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(g)(1).  During the \ninspection and credible fear stages of expedited removal, DHS generally detains the noncitizen.  \n8 C.F.R. §§ 235.3(b)(2)(iii), (b)(4)(ii). \n62.  An expedited removal order comes with significant consequences beyond \nremoval itself.  Noncitizens who are issued expedited removal orders are subject to a five-year \nbar on admission to the United States unless they qualify for a discretionary waiver.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(9)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 212.2.  Similarly, noncitizens issued expedited removal orders \nafter having been found inadmissible based on misrepresentation are subject to a lifetime bar on \nadmission to the United States unless they are granted a discretionary exception or waiver.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C). \nD. Widespread Flaws in the Government’s Expedited Removal Policies. \n63.  The government’s expedited removal policies already suffer from numerous \nserious deficiencies.  This expansion will only result in more erroneous removals and rights \nviolations.  Any individual may be apprehended by immigration authorities in any location and \nsummarily removed without a meaningful process to test whether that individual is properly \nsubject to arrest, to expedited removal, or even to removal at all.   \nFlaws in the Procedures for Inspection by Immigration Officers \n64.  Under expedited removal, an individual who seeks to contest many of the critical \nfactual or legal requisites for expedited removal—the lack of alienage, admission or parole, \ninadmissibility, or the requisite continuous physical presence in the country—receives no \nmeaningful opportunity to do so.  The individual bears the burden of proving certain critical \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 17 of 39\nfacts.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) (noncitizen must show continuous presence to \n“satisfaction of” immigration officer); 8 C.F.R §§ 253.3(b)(1)(ii) (burden on noncitizen to show \ncontinuous presence), (b)(6) (same as to parole or admission). The individual is not provided \nwith any time to prepare; any means by which to gather evidence, present witnesses, or review or \ncross-examine DHS’ evidence; nor any right to counsel recognized by the government or time to \nobtain counsel—all in sharp contrast to regular removal proceedings where individuals are \nentitled to such safeguards.  \n65.  For individuals who have been residing in the country for an extended period or \nwho are apprehended far from the border, the risk of error in the expedited removal process is \nparticularly high. \n66.  For example, DHS puts the burden on the individual to show “to the satisfaction \nof an immigration officer” that the length of the individual’s continuous presence makes the \nindividual ineligible for expedited removal.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II); 8 C.F.R \n253.3(b)(1)(ii). Thus, the government imposes a default presumption that, in the absence of any \naffirmative evidence, any individual arrested anywhere in the country is a noncitizen who has not \nbeen continuously present for two years or more.   \n67.  That presumption makes no sense when applied to individuals apprehended in the \ninterior of the United States.  Indeed, of the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants \nresiding in this country less than 4% arrived less than two years ago without having been \nadmitted or paroled.  That means that nearly 96% of the undocumented immigrants that DHS \nmight apprehend cannot properly be removed pursuant to expedited removal.  Yet, the Rule \npresumes all are subject to expedited removal, and requires them to show not only that they have \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 18 of 39\nbeen here for two years, but also that they have been here continuously in that period, in order to \navoid its application.   \n68.  Moreover, under the government’s policies, individuals faced with proving that \nthey have been continuously physically present in the United States for longer than two years are \nnot guaranteed any time or opportunity to gather evidence that would establish that fact.  That is \nso even though individuals who are going about their daily lives—attending religious services, \ntaking their children to school, attending community events, or even simply grocery shopping—\nare extremely unlikely to be carrying the necessary documentary evidence on their persons. \n69.  The government’s policies and interpretations of the statute and regulations fail to \nafford these individuals, who are detained during the inspection process, with time or any \nopportunity to gather the necessary evidence, nor even the ability to make a telephone call to \nsomeone who could help.  The inspecting officer is not required to make any independent effort \nto corroborate or verify any information, unless the individual makes a claim to U.S. citizenship; \nto lawful permanent resident, refugee, or asylee status; or to having been admitted or paroled. \n70.  In addition, the government’s expedited removal policies fail to require that the \nimmigration officer assess individuals to ensure that they are mentally competent or otherwise \nhave the capacity to participate in the inspections process, and they fail to require additional \nsafeguards should an individual be found to have competency or capacity issues.   \n71.  Likewise, in the expedited removal process, a noncitizen’s removability is \ndetermined by a low-level immigration enforcement officer who acts as both prosecutor and \njudge, rather than by a neutral adjudicator, as required in regular removal proceedings.  See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 19 of 39\n72.  In addition, the expedited removal policies fail to provide an opportunity for a \nnoncitizen to raise claims that his or her arrest violated a statutory or constitutional requirement. \n73.  Over the last two decades, extensive studies have demonstrated that the expedited \nremoval process deprives individuals of a meaningful opportunity to show that they are not \nsubject to expedited removal, or to removal at all.  The government is well aware of the \nwidespread inadequacies and flaws in the expedited removal process, and yet has failed to \nadequately address the problem.  Expanding this process to alleged noncitizens apprehended in \nthe interior of the United States and who are alleged to have resided in the country for up to two \nyears is certain to result in even more widespread erroneous removals. \n74.  For example, a 2005 study commissioned by Congress documented numerous \n“serious problems” in the expedited removal process “which put some asylum seekers at risk of \nimproper return.”  U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Report on Asylum Seekers in \nExpedited Removal: Volume I: Findings & Recommendations 4, 10 (2005), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/1GkjQfK (“2005 USCIRF Study”). \n75.   A 2016 follow-up study “revealed continuing and new concerns about CBP \nofficers’ interviewing practices and the reliability of the records they create, including: flawed \nBorder Patrol internal guidance that conflates CBP’s role with that of USCIS; certain CBP \nofficers’ outright skepticism, if not hostility, toward asylum claims; and inadequate quality \nassurance procedures.”  See U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Barriers to Protection: \nThe Treatment of Asylum Seekers in Expedited Removal 2 (2016), available at \nhttps://bit.ly/2uydMQ8 (“2016 USCIRF Study”). \n76.  Specifically, multiple reports have documented that immigration enforcement \nofficers routinely make factual errors in completing the forms required for expedited removal.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 20 of 39\nAlthough the officers are required to take sworn statements from the individual, the sworn \nstatements that are recorded in the forms are “often inaccurate and nearly always unverifiable.”  \n2005 USCIRF Study, at 53, 55, 74; see also 2016 USCIRF Study, at 21.  The officer taking the \nsworn statement is often the person translating as well.  Asylum officers, who review expedited \nremoval forms in the course of conducting credible fear interviews, have reported that the forms \nfilled out by immigration enforcement officers commonly contain egregious inaccuracies.  See, \ne.g., Borderland Immigration Council, Discretion to Deny: Family Separation, Prolonged \nDetention, and Deterrence of Asylum Seekers at the Hands of Immigration Authorities Along the \nU.S.-Mexico Border 13 (2017) (“Borderland Report”), https://bit.ly/2ZxInuV (describing \nevidence “that CBP affidavits are often inconsistent with asylum-seekers’ own accounts”).  \n77.  Asylum officers also have reported seeing many forms with identical answers, \nand others with clearly erroneous ones—such as forms indicating that a male noncitizen was \nasked and answered whether he was pregnant.  See, e.g., 2016 USCIRF Study, at 20-22. \n78.  Such factual errors are the natural consequence of a system bereft of necessary \nprocedural protections.  Furthermore, the government’s expedited removal policies fail to \nprovide any adequate check against immigration enforcement officers’ failure to comply with \nrequired procedures, such as giving the individual an opportunity to review and respond to the \nstatements in the requisite expedited removal forms.  For example, asylum seekers commonly \nreport that immigration enforcement officers failed to read their statements back to them but \nnonetheless pressured them to sign documents.  See, e.g., 2016 USCIRF Study, at 20-22.  As a \nresult, individuals routinely are deprived of any opportunity to correct errors in their statements \nbefore signing. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 21 of 39\n79.  Multiple reports have documented that immigration enforcement officers have \nroutinely employed coercive tactics to force non-English speaking individuals to sign expedited \nremoval forms in English, without any translation or interpretation.  For example, when one \nindividual refused to sign the expedited removal forms and asked to speak to a judge, the \nimmigration officer told him: “Here, I’m the judge, the attorney, and the one who is going to \ndeport you.”  American Civil Liberties Union, American Exile: Rapid Deportations that Bypass \nthe Courtroom 35-36 (2014) (“American Exile”), https://bit.ly/2GPKeE9; see also, e.g., \nBorderland Report at 13 (“[I]ndividuals are forced to sign legal documents in English without \ntranslation.”); American Exile, at 34-36 (describing noncitizens who were required to sign forms \nin languages they do not understand).  \n80.  Multiple other reports have documented immigration enforcement officers \nengaging in flagrant intimidation to pressure asylum seekers not to express a fear of return.  For \nexample, officers often accuse asylum seekers of lying, falsely tell asylum seekers that they have \nno right to seek asylum, inform asylum seekers that they will be jailed if they continue to assert a \nfear of return and refuse to sign the expedited removal order, or prematurely assert that the \nasylum seekers’ claim will not succeed. \n81.  The lack of any meaningful administrative review also contributes to errors.  For \nexample, although current regulations technically require a supervisor to review the issuance of \nan expedited removal order, that requirement is limited to review of the paperwork—which, as \ndescribed above, is often rife with errors and inaccuracies—and does not provide any \nindependent review of the facts or corroboration of the immigration officer’s representations.  \nSee 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(7).  The government also takes the position that expedited removal \norders are not subject to federal court review. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 22 of 39\n82.  Among the most troubling problems is the widespread failure of immigration \nenforcement officers to refer noncitizens who express a fear of persecution for interviews with \nasylum officers, a problem for which the expedited review system offers no recourse.  As a \nresult, numerous asylum seekers have been erroneously removed without any opportunity to \nspeak with an asylum officer or apply for asylum. \n83.  A study commissioned by Congress found that in 15% of observed cases, when a \nnoncitizen expressed a fear of return to an immigration officer during the inspections process, the \nofficer failed to refer the individual to an asylum officer for a credible fear interview.  2005 \nUSCIRF Study, at 53-54.  Another study found that of the numerous individuals interviewed \nwho reportedly told a CBP officer of their fear of return, fewer than half were referred for a \ncredible fear interview before being summarily removed.  See Human Rights Watch, You Don’t \nHave Rights Here (2014), https://bit.ly/1GocBhZ (“[S]ome said that US border officials ignored \ntheir expressions of fear and removed them with no opportunity to have their claims examined; \nothers said border officials acknowledged hearing their expressions of fear but pressured them to \nabandon their claims.”).   \n84.  Numerous other reports have reached the same conclusion.  See, e.g., Borderland \nReport, at 12 (“CBP and Border Patrol officers in the El Paso Sector routinely and intentionally \ndiscourage people from seeking asylum.  In 12% of the cases documented for this report, \nindividuals expressing fear of violence upon return to their country of origin were not processed \nfor credible fear screenings and instead, were placed into removal proceedings.”); American \nExile, at 4, 32-33 (recounting that individuals subjected to expedited removal and interviewed \nfor the report indicated that “they told the agent they were afraid of returning to their country but \nwere nevertheless not referred to an asylum officer before being summarily deported”); Letter \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 23 of 39\nfrom Nat’l Immigrant Justice Ctr. et al. to U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. Office of Civil Rights & \nCivil Liberties & Office of the Inspector Gen. at 12-22  (Nov. 13, 2014), https://bit.ly/1xfFsog \n(explaining that “[w]hen applicants express fears, CBP officials fail to capture those statements \nin the required documentation or include mistaken information,” and providing numerous stories \nof asylum seekers affected by CBP’s failures during the inspections stage of expedited removal). \nFlaws in the Credible Fear Asylum Process \n85.    Even where asylum applicants are referred for a credible fear interview, there are \nserious flaws in the government’s credible fear procedures.   \n86.  Although the credible fear procedures provide greater safeguards for asylum \nseekers than for other noncitizens placed into expedited removal, the procedures are inadequate \ngiven the complexity of asylum law and the fact that an overwhelming number of applicants are \ntraumatized, do not speak English, and are afraid to be candid at their interviews, especially \nwomen and children.   \n87.  For example, the asylum officer need not create a transcript or audio recording of \nwhat occurred at the credible fear interview, a particularly glaring procedural deficiency given \nthe translation problems and misunderstandings that routinely occur in asylum cases.  Instead, \nthe asylum officer must create only a written summary of the “material facts,” 8 C.F.R. § \n208.30(d)(6), see also 8 USC § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II), and a written record of “the officer’s \nanalysis of why, in light of [the] facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of \npersecution.”  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(II).   \n88.  And, although the asylum officer is required to “determine that the alien has an \nunderstanding of the credible fear determination process,” 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(2), the \ngovernment’s policies fail to require that the asylum officer or immigration judge assess \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 24 of 39\nindividuals to ensure that they are mentally competent and have the capacity to meaningfully \nparticipate in the credible fear process; they also fail to require additional safeguards should an \nindividual be found to have competency or capacity issues.  \n89.  Further, although the government recognizes that there is a right before and \nduring the asylum officer interview to consult with a third party, 8 C.F.R. § 208.30(d)(4), the \ngovernment’s policies do not recognize a right to representation by counsel.  Nor do the \ngovernment’s policies recognize a right to counsel prior to or during the IJ review hearing of a \ndetermination that credible fear has not been shown.  As a result, the government’s policies do \nnot guarantee an individual the right to be represented by her own counsel, who could help the \nindividual identify and articulate the key facts relevant to a claim of persecution or torture, which \nis particularly important given the specialized nature of asylum and protection claims. \n90.  Significantly, although the credible fear standard allows the decision maker to \nconsider “such other facts as are known to the officer,” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(v), the \ngovernment’s policies do not impose any requirement that the asylum officer or IJ fully disclose \nto the individual all of the other facts that were considered, nor is there any requirement that the \nindividual be given an opportunity to respond to those other facts. \n91.  Further, although during the IJ review stage the judge “may receive into evidence \nany oral or written statement which is material and relevant to any issue in the review,” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 1003.42(c), at no point in the process do the government’s credible fear policies provide an \nadequate opportunity to gather evidence, including expert testimony which could address \ncountry conditions and other key factual questions, such as whether the noncitizen is a member \nof a particular social group that is being targeted for persecution.   \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 25 of 39\n92.  The procedures are further flawed because, for the many individuals who are \nforced to proceed pro se, there is no obligation for the asylum officer or immigration judge to \nfully develop the record or advise the individual about what he or she must prove to prevail. \n93.  That the government’s credible fear policies are inadequate is reinforced by the \nwidespread evidence of failures in the credible fear process.  For example, advocates “regularly \nlearn of reports of legitimate asylum seekers who are denied ‘credible fear’ – and the chance to \neven file an application for asylum – even though they should meet the standard and may be \neligible for asylum.  In some cases, interviews are sometimes rushed, essential information is not \nidentified due to lack of follow up questions, and/or other mistakes are made that block genuine \nasylum seekers from even applying for asylum and having a real chance to submit evidence and \nhave their case fully considered.”  Hearing before the H. Judiciary Subcomm. on Immigration & \nBorder Sec. at 5 (Feb. 11, 2015) (statement of Eleanor Acer, Dir., Refugee Protection, Human \nRights First), https://bit.ly/2OGFszm; see also, e.g., Letter from Am. Immigration Lawyers \nAss’n, et al. to Leon Rodríguez, Dir., U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., and Sarah Saldaña, \nDir., U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement 2-4 (Dec. 24, 2015) (“AILA Letter”), \nhttps://bit.ly/2Yr3DWF (“USCIS’ negative fear determinations are often flawed, with numerous \nsubstantive problems evident in the transcripts of initial fear interviews.”).  In some cases, \nmothers are called upon to reveal sensitive details of the persecution they faced—including \nphysical or sexual violence or abuse at the hands of other family members—with their children \npresent at their interviews; as a result, critical information is often not elicited during these \ninterviews. \n94.  These flaws are compounded by the lack of access to counsel.  Few individuals in \nthe credible fear process have the assistance of counsel or any other representative.  Those that \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 26 of 39\ndo often cannot be effectively represented due to restrictions on attorney participation and lack of \nnotice of key proceedings.  See, e.g., AILA Letter at 3 (explaining that immigration judge review \nof credible fear determinations “seldom involves attorney participation” because attorneys \nreceive notice of hearings either not at all, or with too little time to prepare and attend such \nhearings). \n95.  There are well-documented systematic inadequacies in interpretation services \nduring the expedited removal process.  For example, an unrepresented Guatemalan mother who \nwas persecuted based on her indigenous ethnicity was removed after an asylum officer \ninterviewed her in Spanish—a language in which she was unable to communicate—and issued a \nnegative credible fear determination.  Acer Statement at 6 (“This woman was deported from the \nUnited States under expedited removal before she could secure legal counsel.”); see also, e.g., \nReport of the DHS Advisory Committee on Family Residential Centers 96-99 (2016), \nhttps://bit.ly/2yFluu0 (discussing inadequate or nonexistent interpretation services during \ncredible fear interviews and immigration judge reviews of negative credible fear determinations); \nAmerican Exile, at 34 (“Most of the individuals interviewed . . . stated that they were given \nforms to sign in English, which most did not speak or read, and often were not interviewed by an \nimmigration officer who fluently spoke their language or through an interpreter.”); Borderland \nReport at 13; 2016 USCIRF Study, at 28 (describing the case of a detained Ethiopian asylum \nseeker who was denied an interpreter). \nErroneous Expedited Removals  \n96.  The result of the widespread flaws in the expedited removal process is that many \nindividuals have been erroneously removed from the United States. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 27 of 39\n97.  For example, in 2014, a Mexican citizen who had been living in the United States \ncontinuously for 14 years was nonetheless removed under an expedited removal order after a \ntraffic stop in Weslaco, Texas.  DHS removed the individual even though, at the time of the \nincident, expedited removal could not be applied to individuals who had been in the country \nmore than 14 days.  American Exile, at 63. \n98.  DHS has removed multiple U.S. citizens pursuant to expedited removal orders.  \nSee Lyttle v. United States, 867 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1272-73 (M.D. Ga. 2012) (U.S. citizen \nerroneously issued expedited removal order); de la Paz v. Johnson, No. 1:14-CV-016 (S.D. Tex.) \n(habeas petition filed Jan. 24, 2014) (U.S. citizen erroneously subjected to expedited removal); \nIan James, Wrongly Deported, American Citizen Sues INS for $8 Million, L.A. Times (Sept. 3, \n2000), https://tinyurl.com/y4uulrds (recounting expedited removal of U.S. citizen Sharon \nMcKnight). \n99.  DHS also has erroneously removed numerous asylum seekers pursuant to \nexpedited removal orders.  For example, CBP removed a Guatemalan citizen and mother of four \nU.S. citizen children under an expedited removal order even though she told the officers that she \nwas afraid to be deported to Guatemala, where her father had been murdered and her mother had \nbeen the target of extortion by gangs.  Although the woman told the immigration officers that she \nwas illiterate, they forced her to initial that she had read their account of her interview, which \nincorrectly stated that she did not fear return.  She refused to sign the expedited removal order, \nbut was nonetheless deported to Guatemala, where she was later raped and shot by a gang.  \nAmerican Exile at 38.  In another example, a 22-year-old woman fled domestic violence in El \nSalvador and border officials arrested her in Texas.  Although a CBP officer asked her about fear \nof return, the officer never referred her to an asylum officer.  She was asked to sign forms in \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 28 of 39\nEnglish, with no opportunity to ask questions.  After she was removed to El Salvador, her ex-\nboyfriend continued to abuse her.  Id. at 39. \n100.  Defendants are aware of the flaws in the expedited removal and credible fear \nprocesses, including the lack of procedural protections.  Nevertheless, Defendants have acted to \nexpand a systematically deficient process to an even larger category of individuals, without \ntaking steps to address these well-documented problems.  Under expanded expedited removal, \nany individual apprehended anywhere in the country could be erroneously subjected to these \ntruncated and flawed procedures and mistakenly deported without a meaningful hearing.  Indeed, \nthe application of expedited removal to the interior of the country—far from the border—\nincreases the likelihood that citizens, noncitizens with lawful status, and noncitizens who have \nlived in the country for years or decades and are therefore eligible for relief from removal, will \nbe swept up in raids or other enforcement actions and mistakenly or arbitrarily subjected to \nexpedited removal.  Applying expedited removal to noncitizens who have significant ties to the \nUnited States and have resided in communities across the country for extended periods will \nexacerbate the existing widespread, systemic violations of constitutional, statutory, and \nregulatory rights in the expedited removal process. \nE. Harm to Plaintiff Organizations and Their Members. \n101.  Plaintiffs are nonprofit membership-based organizations whose missions include \nproviding immigration counseling and legal services to members and community members. \n102.  Make  the  Road  New  York  (“MRNY”)  is  a  nonprofit,  membership-based \ncommunity organization that integrates adult and youth education, legal and survival services, \nand community and civic engagement, in a holistic approach to help low-income New Yorkers \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 29 of 39\nimprove their lives and neighborhoods. MRNY has five offices in the New York area, located in \nBrooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and in Suffolk and Westchester Counties.  \n103.  MRNY  has  over  23,000  members  residing  in  New  York  City,  Westchester \nCounty, and Long Island.   \n104.  Members include noncitizens who have not been admitted to the United States \nand who have been continuously present for between two weeks and two years, and are subject \nto the July 23 Rule expanding expedited removal.   \n105.  For example, MRNY-John Doe 1 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen. He \nentered the United States without inspection in November 2018, and has been in the country \nsince then. He is not in removal proceedings, nor does he have a final order of removal.   \n106.  MRNY-John Doe 2 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen. He entered the \nUnited States without inspection in June 2019 and has been in the country since then. He does \nnot have a removal order.  He and his son were apprehended by ICE and released without a \nCredible Fear Interview or a formal grant of parole.  ICE provided him with a Notice to Appear \nfor regular removal proceedings, but that document has not been filed with an Immigration \nCourt, and, thus, he is not in regular removal proceedings.  He is required to report periodically \nto ICE.   \n107.  MRNY-Jane Doe 1 is a member of MRNY and a noncitizen. She entered the \nUnited States without inspection in June 2019 and has been in the country since then. She does \nnot have a removal order. She and her children were apprehended by ICE and released without a \ncredible fear interview or a formal grant of parole. She was provided with a Notice to Appear for \nregular removal proceedings, but that document has not been filed with an Immigration Court, \nand, thus, she is not in regular removal proceedings.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 30 of 39\n108.  MRNY also has numerous members who have lived in the country for longer than \ntwo years, but would have difficulty affirmatively demonstrating two years of physical presence, \nparticularly if suddenly detained or given only a short period of time to do so, as is regularly the \ncase when expedited removal orders are issued. \n109.  The  expansion  of  expedited  removal  requires  MRNY  to  divert  the  time  and \nresources of attorneys that would otherwise be dedicated to assisting noncitizens in applying for \nforms of relief and in supporting MRNY’s core mission of building the power of immigrant \ncommunities.  For example, MRNY has created and disseminated informational materials about \nexpanded expedited removal in English and Spanish and begun community education efforts \naround expedited removal.  This has required numerous staff members’ time due to the lack of \nany clear standards around the expansion of expedited removal or the availability of judicial \nfederal court review, which has left lawyers and organizers unsure of how to appropriately \nadvise members and clients.  MRNY now frequently works with members and clients to identify \nwhether they may be at risk of being subject to expedited removal; how to prepare for encounters \nwith ICE officers; what documents may provide continuous residence; and whether and where to \ngather and maintain those documents.  \n110.  MRNY is also harmed in its mission to empower immigrant communities to \nunderstand and assert their fundamental rights including the right to remain silent. MRNY’s \npublic-facing materials and trainings on immigrant rights often counsel that immigrants may \ninvoke the right to remain silent.  The expansion of expedited removal necessitates a wholesale \nrevisiting of these training materials—and the legal trainings that members, organizers and \nothers receive through MRNY—because individuals who exercise their right to remain silent \nnow face the possibility of wrongful placement into expedited removal, whether due to failure to \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 31 of 39\nassert a fear; failure to explain their manner of entry; or failure to affirmatively establish two \nyears of presence. \n111.  MRNY members live in areas where encounters with ICE officers are common.  \nSince 2017, MRNY has assisted hundreds of families in the New York City area who have had a \nloved  one  detained  by  ICE.    Several  dozen  of  these  detentions  have  been  at  municipal \ncourthouses, where ICE arrests have become extremely common, particularly in New York City \nand Westchester County.  In addition, under the present administration, ICE regularly detains so-\ncalled “collateral” individuals when conducting home raids.  These detentions demonstrate the \nhigh risk of ICE detention faced by MRNY members and all undocumented New Yorkers.  \n112.  La Unión del Pueblo Entero (“LUPE”) is a membership-based community union \nbased in the Rio Grande Valley, in South Texas, near the United States-Mexico border.  The \nname translates to Union of the People. \n113.  LUPE has over 8,000 dues-paying members located in South Texas.  \n114.  LUPE members include noncitizens subject to the government’s expanded \nexpedited removal policy.  These members have been in the country for more than fourteen days, \nbut less than two years, and have not been admitted to the United States by an immigration \nofficer.   \n115.  For example, LUPE-Jane Doe 1 is a member of LUPE, and a noncitizen. She \nentered the United States without inspection on or about May 13, 2019, and has been in the \ncountry since then.  She has had no previous contact with immigration authorities. She intends to \nseek asylum in the United States, because she fears if she returned to Mexico she would be \ntargeted on account of her previous affiliations with the Mexican government.   \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 32 of 39\n116.  Jane Doe 2 is a member of LUPE and a noncitizen, who entered the United States \nwithout inspection in July of 2018, when her husband, who was living in the United States, \nbecame seriously ill.  She is not currently in removal proceedings.  \n117.  LUPE has members who have been in the United States for more than two years \nand have not been admitted to the United States, but who are at risk of wrongful placement into \nexpanded expedited removal if they exercise their right to remain silent if they come into contact \nwith immigration authorities or if the officer is not “satisfied” with their proof of continuous \npresence. \n118.  For example, LUPE-John Doe 1 is a member of LUPE and a noncitizen.  He \nentered the United States without inspection in July 2017, and has been in the country since.  \nEven though he has been in the country for just over two years, he fears being placed in \nexpedited removal because he would not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate presence or \nwould not have this evidence with him if placed in expedited removal. \n119.  LUPE members live in areas in South Texas with a large number of encounters \nwith immigration officers.  For example, LUPE has received reports about immigration officers \nstationed  in  low-income  Latino  neighborhoods  and  near  bus  stops  frequented  by  Latinos; \nimmigration  officers  have  also  conduct  workplace  raids  in  in  areas  known  to  have  Latino \nrestaurants.   \n120.  Expanded expedited removal has already required LUPE to divert staff members \nfrom their regular assignments.  LUPE will have to hire and train new staff members, to organize \nand conduct Know Your Rights presentations to inform the community as to the effects of the \nJuly 23 Rule.   \n121.  WeCount! is a membership-based organization in South Florida. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 33 of 39\n122.  WeCount! has approximately 200 dues paying members located in and around \nHomestead, Florida.   \n123.  WeCount! members include noncitizens who are subject to the government’s \nexpanded expedited removal policy.  These members have been in the country for more than \nfourteen days, but less than two years, and have not been admitted to the United States by an \nimmigration officer.   \n124.  For example, WeCount!-John Doe 1 is a member of WeCount! and a noncitizen. \nHe entered the United States without inspection in December 2017 and has been in the country \nsince then.  He has had no previous contact with immigration authorities.  \n125.  WeCount! has members who have been here for more than two years and have \nnot been admitted to the United States, but who are at risk of wrongful placement into expanded \nexpedited removal if they exercise their right to remain silent if they come into contact with \nimmigration authorities or if the officer is not “satisfied” with their proof of continuous presence. \n126.  WeCount!  members  are  the  target  of  frequent  enforcement  actions  in  the \ncommunities in which they live.  WeCount! members have been the target of home raids and \nworkplace raids.  \n127.  WeCount!  members  have  also  been  subject  to  other  forms  of  immigration \nenforcement, including stake-outs and traffic stops. \n128.   Expanded  expedited  removal  has  already  required  WeCount!  to  divert  staff \nmembers from regular assignments to address the effects of the expansion, including to organize \nand conduct information meetings to inform the community about the consequences of expanded \nexpedited removal, advise members how to collect documents to show sufficient presence, and \nhelp members to assemble those documents. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 34 of 39\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553) \n \n129.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n130.  The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553, requires that agencies provide \npublic notice of, and opportunity to comment on, legislative rules before their promulgation.  See \n5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b), (c).  The APA also requires that any substantive rule must be published at \nleast 30 days prior to its effective date.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(d). \n131.  Although styled as a “Notice,” the July 23 Rule is a legislative rule within the \nmeaning of the APA. \n132.  DHS did not comply with the APA’s procedural requirements when it made the \nJuly 23 Rule immediately effective upon publication.   \n133.  Defendants’ failure to provide for notice and comment violates 5 U.S.C. § 553(b) \nand (c).   \n134.  Defendants’ failure to publish the July 23 Rule 30 days before its effective date \nviolates 5 U.S.C. § 553(d).   \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution) \n \n135.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n136.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall \n. . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . .” \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 35 of 39\n137.  Plaintiffs’ members who are at risk of being subjected to expedited removal are \nentitled under the Due Process Clause to meaningful process before they can be removed from \nthe country. \n138.  The July 23 Rule violates the Due Process Clause. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(a), (b)(1); \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)) \n \n139.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n140.  The expansion of expedited removal denies people a meaningful process before \nthey are removed from the United States.  A meaningful process includes, inter alia, an \nopportunity to gather evidence necessary to establish they are not inadmissible and have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for more than two years, and an opportunity to consult \nor rely on the aid of others, including counsel, to otherwise challenge the application of \nexpedited removal.   \n141.  If the expedited removal statute is not interpreted to provide a meaningful \nprocess, it would raise serious constitutional questions.  \n142.  The July 23 Rule violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(a), (b)(1) because it deprives persons faced with expedited removal of minimal procedures \nnecessary to ensure that the statute is administered fairly and consistent with constitutional due \nprocess. \n143.  Therefore, the July 23 Rule violates the APA because it is, inter alia, “not in \naccordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 36 of 39\nstatutory right,” and “without observance of procedure required by law . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A), (C), (D). \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362;  \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b), 706(1), (2)) \n \n144.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein. \n145.  The Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1362, provides that “[i]n any \nremoval proceedings before an immigration judge,” the individual “shall have the privilege of \nbeing represented . . . .”  Section 1362 does not exempt expedited removal proceedings.  Where \nan asylum seeker requests review of a credible fear denial before an immigration judge, the \nstatute confers on them the right to representation by counsel of their own choosing. \n146.  The APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b), provides that “[a] person compelled to appear in \nperson before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and \nadvised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative. A party is \nentitled to appear in person or by or with counsel or other duly qualified representative in an \nagency proceeding.”  Individuals subjected to expedited removal procedures are compelled to \nappear in person before agency representatives.  Congress has not exempted expedited removal \nproceedings from this requirement. \n147.  Defendants’ application of policies restricting the participation of counsel for \nindividuals in expedited removal during both the immigration enforcement officer’s inspection \nand the credible fear process (including during proceedings in which an IJ reviews a negative \ncredible fear determination) to individuals described in the July 23 Rule violates 8 U.S.C. § 1362 \nand the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 555(b). \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 37 of 39\n148.  In addition, the July 23 Rule violates the APA because it is, inter alia, agency \naction “unlawfully withheld,” “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” and “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), (2)(A), (2)(C), (2)(D).  \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n \n149.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n150.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n151.  Among other reasons, the July 23 Rule is arbitrary and capricious because, in \nadopting it, Defendants have failed to articulate a reasoned explanation for their decision, which \nrepresents a change in the agency’s longstanding policy; entirely failed to consider important \naspects of the problem; and offered explanations for their decision that run counter to the \nevidence before the agency.  \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Suspension Clause, Art. 1, § 9, cl. 2, of the U.S. Constitution) \n152.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n153.  Article 1, § 9, cl. 2., of the United States Constitution provides that the “Privilege \nof the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or \nInvasion the public Safety may require it.”    \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 38 of 39\n154.  Under the government’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \nthe July 23 Rule subjects individuals to expedited removal without federal court review of an \nexpedited removal order, other than with respect to the three determinations listed in 8 U.S.C. § \n1252(e)(2) pertaining to alienage, the existence of an order, and whether the individual was \nlawfully admitted for permanent residence, admitted as a refugee, or granted asylum.   \n155.  Depriving individuals of the right to seek judicial review of an expedited removal \norder violates the Suspension Clause.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray this Court to: \na.  Declare the Federal Register Notice dated July 23, 2019 contrary to law;  \nb.  Enter an order vacating the Federal Register Notice; \nc.  Declare contrary to law the expedited removal of noncitizens who have been present in \nthis country for longer than 14 days or who have been apprehended farther than 100 miles from \nthe border; \nd.  Enter an order enjoining and staying Defendants from continuing to apply expedited \nremoval to noncitizens who have been present in this country for longer than 14 days, or who \nhave been apprehended farther than 100 miles from the border; \ne.  Issue an order directing that, should Defendants seek to remove any noncitizen who has \nresided in the United States for longer than 14 days, or who has been apprehended more than 100 \nmiles from the border, Defendants shall place the individual in regular immigration court \nremoval proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a. \nf.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice \nAct, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 39 of 39\ng.

If the Court does not adopt the government’s first proposed schedule, Defendants \npropose the following schedule: \n  August 19: Defendants file their opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction. \n  August 21: Plaintiffs file their reply. \n  August 23: Defendants file a sur-reply limited to addressing any arguments pertaining to \njusticiability raised for the first time by Plaintiffs in their reply.  \n  August 26: the Court conducts a hearing.  \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-02369-KBJ   Document 20   Filed 08/14/19   Page 3 of 5\n \nAlthough the parties appear to be in agreement on Defendants’ first proposal, should the  \nCourt elect to adopt Plaintiffs’ alternative proposal with a hearing date of September 6, \nDefendants believe Plaintiffs reply brief should be limited to 25 pages.  \nPlaintiffs’ Statement \nThe government’s Option 1 above is satisfactory for Plaintiffs, other than Plaintiffs \nrequest a 35-page reply brief. \nIf, however, the Court is inclined to hold the hearing on September 6, as it suggested on \nthe phone, then plaintiffs would propose the following schedule: \nAugust 21: Plaintiffs’ supplement brief on jurisdiction, limited to 15 pages \nAugust 28: Government omnibus opposition, limited to 60 pages \nSept 3: Plaintiffs’ reply, limited to 35 pages \nSept 6: Hearing  \nRespectfully submitted, \nJOSEPH H.
