First, as to conferral, Defendants represents that Plaintiff conferred only regarding one of the two categories of documents at issue in this motion. Such conferral does not comply with the Local Rules. Nevertheless, having reviewed the motion and Defendants' opposition, I find good cause to extend Plaintiff's response deadline until June 1, 2022. Defendants' request for attorney's fees pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(a)(3) is denied, however, should Plaintiff's conferral continue to be inadequate with respect to future motions, attorney's fees may be warranted.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendant Ricky D. Dixon shall file a response to Plaintiff's Motion, on or before June 21, 2022. Plaintiff shall then have until June 23, 2022 to file a reply should it wish to do so. Further, it is ORDERED that a hearing on Plaintiff's Motion [DE 88] shall be conducted via Zoom video teleconference (VTC) on June 27, 2022, at 2:30 p.m. in the West Palm Beach Division before Magistrate Judge William Matthewman. To log in through ZoomGov Meeting, use Meeting ID: 161 476 5000 Passcode: 790441. In advance of the scheduled hearing, the Court directs the parties' counsel to confer, either in person or by telephone, in good faith and for as long as necessary to address the pending discovery disputes in an effort to resolve them. Thereafter, counsel for the parties shall file, on or before June 24, 2022, a Joint Notice advising whether the discovery disputes have been resolved, and if not, what specific issues remain for determination by the Court and a brief recitation of the position of Plaintiff and Defendant on each specific issue. The Court shall consider sanctions or cost-shifting against any party or counsel who fails to comply with all discovery obligations, fails to comply with applicable rules and orders, or who takes a frivolous, dilatory, or unreasonable discovery position. If the parties resolve the disputes raised in whole or in part prior to the hearing, the Court shall be promptly notified. Signed by Magistrate Judge William Matthewman on 6/14/2022.

    "summary": "<p>The Human Rights Defense Center, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting human rights in U.S. detention facilities, filed this lawsuit on August 10, 2021. The plaintiff filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against the Florida Department of Corrections (Department of Corrections) and the warden of the Everglades Correctional Institution (Everglades). The presiding judge was Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleged that Department of Corrections and Everglades violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the Human Rights Defense Center and individuals incarcerated in the Everglades Correctional Institution by censoring and impounding publications produced by the Human Rights Defense Center that notified incarcerated persons of their rights. Represented by private and in-house counsel, the Human Rights Defense Center sought declaratory and injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants separately moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim, attempting to invoke qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity, on October 11, 2021, and November 1, 2021. In response, the Human Rights Defense Center moved to continue to trial. Following these events, the court referred the case to mediation, denied the plaintiff's motion to continue, and tentatively set a jury trial date for April 2022. The motion to continue was likely denied to require the plaintiffs to participate in mediation.</p>\r\n<p>The Human Rights Defense Center then filed an amended complaint against the defendants on December 16, 2021, which contained the same general allegations and added an additional defendant, the former assistant warden of the Santa Rosa Correctional Institution. Sixteen days thereafter, the defendants again moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim along substantially similar grounds as their first motion.</p>\r\n<p>The case was then referred to mediation again, and the court rescheduled a jury trial for July 2022. As of March 24, 2022, the case was ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>On March 11, 2022, the parties filed a motion to stay discovery and continue discovery related deadlines pending resolution of the defendants' motion to dismiss. Three days later, the court granted the order in part and denied in part. The court found good cause to extend the March 11, 2022 deadline to file a discovery plan. Accordingly, the parties were ordered to file a discovery plan on or by March 24, 2022. With respect to the remainder of the pretrial schedule, considering the time that remained prior to the expiration of the discovery-related deadlines, the court left those deadlines in place.</p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2022, the court denied the motion to dismiss. The court asserted the following:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\r\n<li>Shotgun pleading: The court determined that plaintiff's complaint was not a shotgun pleading and it included a sufficient factual basis to apprise the defendants of the charges against them which was all that was needed at that stage.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>First Amendment Claims (Count One): Plaintiff's First Amendment claim was not precluded by prior precedent. The defendants had pointed to <a href=\"../../../../case/16594\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prison Legal News v. Florida Department of Corrections</a> a case in which a similar issue was at stake. The court determined that this precedent did not control because the facts were different enough that the holding of that case did not necessarily apply.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Vagueness and Overbreadth Claims (Counts Two and Three): Defendants had once again pointed to the prior case mentioned above, but the court once again determined that the differences between the case precluded dismissal.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Due Process Claims (Counts Four and Five): The court held that the plaintiff had sufficiently pled this claim to survive dismissal and defendants' mere assertions that plaintiff had received notice was not enough.</li>\r\n<li>Venue: Venue was proper because while plaintiff had mentioned an injunction ordered by the Northern District Court of Florida, the plaintiff had alleged new claims.</li>\r\n<li>Immunity:&nbsp;\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: upper-alpha;\">\r\n<li>Sovereign Immunity: Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint only sought nominal and compensatory damages against defendants sued in their individual capacities so no claims were dismissible on a sovereign immunity basis.</li>\r\n<li>Qualified Immunity: \"Defendants were on notice that impounding plaintiff's publications without prior notice violated plaintiff's clearly established constitutional rights. Therefore, defendants are not now shielded by the doctrine of qualified immunity.\"</li>\r\n<li>Individual Liability: Plaintiff's allegation of facts that implied causal connection between the actions of subordinates and their supervisors was enough to bring individual liability upon defendants Inch and Colon.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Punitive Damages: Plaintiff had properly alleged facts sufficient to support a conclusion that defendants acted willfully or maliciously.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Ripeness: The plaintiff's claims were ripe.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>2022 WL 19486385.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 23, 2022, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. At issue in the case was that by impounding the plaintiff's publications the defendants were in violation of the plaintiff's First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. FDOC's Admissible Reading Material Rule (ARM) was at issue because the plaintiff had argued it was unconstitutionally vague and over broad. A provision of the ARM rule limited the type of publications that could be received in the mail by inmates and prohibited publications that included certain advertisements or activities or services.</p>\r\n<p>They argued that the plaintiff's First Amendment rights were not violated by the ARM rule because the defendants implementation of the rule, whereby publications adverse to FDOC's penological interests were rejected while providing notice to the publisher and inmate, was a reasonable practice that balanced the interests of both FDOC and the publisher and inmate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the plaintiff also filed a motion for summary judgment, but the accompanying memorandum was not available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 18, 2022, the court granted in part and deferred ruling in part on the defendant's motion for summary judgment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court granted summary judgment to defendant Inch on the plaintiff's remaining damages claims for loss of actual and potential subscribers and customers. The plaintiff's conclusory assertions of lost subscribers and damage without evidentiary support was not enough to survive summary judgment. The court deferred ruling on the remainder of the defendant's summary judgment motion. 2022 WL 4242727.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 24, 2022, the court dismissed the case as to defendant Micha Neal and defendant Does 1-7 in response to the plaintiff's status report filed on August 22, 2022, which claimed they were no longer pursuing their claims against these defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, the court also granted in part the defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The court found that defendants Inch and Colon were entitled to qualified immunity because the plaintiff had failed to fulfill their burden of proving that there was a clearly established requirement that the defendants had crossed thereby waiving their immunity. The court then addressed the plaintiff's individual claims. As to the plaintiff's first amendment claim (count 1), the court held that at this point in the litigation the facts were not developed enough to rule on the parties&rsquo; arguments and denied both parties&rsquo; motions as to count 1.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff&rsquo;s claims based on vagueness and overbreadth were dismissed. These claims were based on the prior rule and thus were barred by the Eleventh Amendment, which prohibited plaintiffs from seeking retrospective relief based on older versions of a rule.</p>\r\n<p>As to the current version of the rule, the plaintiff's vagueness claim was also dismissed because there was fair notice of prohibited conduct. The defendants were also granted summary judgment on the plaintiff's over breadth claim because it was not per se unconstitutional to impound a publication for a singular objectionable ad.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court also granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiff's procedural due process claim because the defendants had brought forward undisputed evidence that FDOC had provided notice and an opportunity to be heard upon impoundment of the publications and any error rate was negligible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the plaintiff's claim of substantive due process asserting that the defendants' conduct was not a violation and the plaintiff's assertion that it should be assessed under an arbitrary and capricious standard was incorrect. 2022 WL 4243921.</p>\r\n<p>On March 29, 2023, after a bench trial the court dismissed the plaintiffs as-applied First Amendment challenge to FDOC's impoundments of ads containing fantasy sports without prejudice for lacking subject-matter jurisdiction. The court also granted the defendants&rsquo; judgment in its favor on the plaintiff's First Amendment claim as to every other impoundment at issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff's claim in regards to fantasy sports was not yet ripe because the ARM rule had not yet been applied to these ads and the plaintiffs had launched an as-applied challenge to the rule. As to the rest of the First Amendment claim, the court said that the rest of the ads fell squarely within the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in <a href=\"../../../../case/16594/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prison Legal News v.

D \n33.501.401(15) effective through May 3, 2022 are \n75 \nDISMISSED. \n \n(2) Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment (DE \nFootnotes \n \n1  Defendants dispute various contentions in these facts, but they do not dispute the propositions for which I have \n  cited Plaintiffโs Facts ยถยถ 1โ3. \n \n2  Plaintiff also sued Micha Neal in her individual capacity and seven fictitious defendants in their individual capacities. \n  (DE 39 at 1). Plaintiff declined to pursue these claims and agreed to dismissal (DE 141); (DE 144). \n \n3  For example, in response to Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 10, that the introduction of contraband that allows inmates to \n  access the internet is an increasing problem, Plaintiff responded: โDisputed: Plaintiff disputes the factual allegations \nin this paragraph to the extent they imply that the impoundment of the HRDC publications ... was reasonably related \nto a legitimate security rational or penological purpose. See infra at ยถยถ 45, 48, 59.โ (DE 112-1 ยถ 10). This โto the \nextentโ language does not even explain whether the fact is indeed disputed, let alone provide any factual basis for \nthe dispute. \n \n9 \n \n\n \n \nHuman Rights Defense Center v. Dixon, Slip Copy (2022)   \n29 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. D 75 \n \n4  To stay with Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 10 (DE 104 ยถ 10), Plaintiffโs above response fact (DE 112-1 ยถ 10) tells me to read \n  Plaintiffโs responses located at DE 112-1 ยถยถ 45, 48 and 59. DE 112-1 ยถ 48 is undisputed, so the purpose of \nreferencing that response fact is unclear. DE 112-1 ยถ 45 itself contains more of the unresponsive โto the extent \nthatโ-type response I previously described. It then sends me in part to record evidence regarding three-way calls, \nand in part to one of Plaintiffโs facts in support of its Motion (DE 105-4 ยถ 38). DE 105-4 ยถ 38 also contains record \nevidence regarding three-way calling. Recall that DE 112-1 also tells me to read Plaintiffโs response located at DE \n112-1 ยถ 59. So I go there next. That reads: โDisputed. Plaintiff disputes the factual allegations in this paragraph to \nthe extent they implied that the impoundment of HRDC publications under subsection 15(o)(3) of the ARM Rule is \nreasonably related to a legitimate security rationale or penological interest. See โAdditional Factsโ ยถ 104.โ Again, \n112-1 ยถ 59 is violative of Rule 56.1 in numerous ways and hence unhelpful. But continuing on to Plaintiffโs Additional \nFact ยถ 104 (DE 112-1 ยถ 104), that fact contains more evasive text, record evidence regarding stamps, and also sends \nme to Plaintiffโs Fact ยถ 40 (DE 105-4 ยถ 40). Iโll stop there, because the problem is more than clear. Recall that I was \nled down this road in the first place to determine whether Plaintiff disputes that inmates are obtaining contraband \ncell phones and other electronic devices, as Defendants contend in DE 104 ยถ 10. Nowhere along the way did I find \nPlaintiffโs position, or even a hint as to its position, on whether it disputes or does not dispute that fact and why. \nThis is but one example. \n \n5  For example, โDisputed. Plaintiff disputes the factual allegations in this paragraph to the extent they contradict the \n  Declaration of Paul Right in support of Plaintiffโs Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 105-2). (DE 112-1 ยถ 73). \n \n6  Prior to the course of briefing on these cross-motions, Plaintiff abandoned all damages claims except a claim for \n  actual and potential lost subscribers and customers against Defendants Inch and Colon in their individual capacities. \n(DE 104 ยถ 95); (DE 112-1 ยถ 95). Plaintiff abandoned the damages claim against Defendant Colon in its response in \nopposition to Defendantsโ Motion. (DE 112 at 18 n.3). Defendant Inch then sought an expedited ruling on Plaintiffโs \nentitlement to a jury trial on its damages claim against Defendant Inch, given the rapidly approaching trial date. (DE \n129). I granted in part Defendantsโ Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff lacked sufficient \nevidence of damages as a matter of law, and I deferred ruling on the remainder of the Partiesโ cross-motions. (DE \n137). Given the size and scope of this litigation and the proximity to the trial date, it was important for the Parties to \nknow whether they need be preparing for a jury trial. The Court also maintains an interest in conservation of \njury-related resources and judicial efficiency. But qualified immunity must still be addressed. For one, the individual \ncapacity claim against Defendant Colon, despite being abandoned by Plaintiff in responsive briefing, has not been \nformally addressed by this Court to date. Additionally, qualified immunity presents an alternative and additional \nsupportive reason why the claims against Defendants Inch and Colon in their individual capacities may not proceed. \n \n7  I do not view the rule change as fatal to Plaintiffโs other claims, which are not entirely premised on the text of a \n  regulation no longer in effect. Those alleged violations of federal law are ongoing in the same substantive manner \nnotwithstanding the rule change, and prospective injunctive and/or declaratory relief would thereby remedy those \nongoing violations. \n \n8  At least two Circuits have declined to analyze vagueness and overbreadth challenges to prison regulations separate \n  from the Turner standard. See Waterman v. Farmer, 183 F.3d 208, 212 (3d Cir. 1999); see also Bahrampour v. \nLampert, 356 F.3d 969, 975โ76 (9th Cir. 2004). \n10 \n \n\n \n \nHuman Rights Defense Center v. Dixon, Slip Copy (2022)   \n29 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. D 75 \n \n \n9  Defendants cite subsections (8)(b), which appears to be the subsection at which this particular rule was previously \n  located. At present, that language appears at (16)(b). \n \n10  This  is  procedurally  undisputed.  Defendants  dispute  Plaintiffsโ  Facts  ยถยถ  2  through  4  with  respect  to  other \n  representations contained therein. They do not dispute that PLN and CLN are monthly magazines, or that DSHLM is \na soft-cover book. \n \n11  This is procedurally undisputed. Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 73 states that FDOC provided notice to HRDC when DSHLM was \n  first impounded, citing to the notice of impoundment dated March 27, 2018. (DE 104 ยถ 73) (citing (DE 104-24)). \nPlaintiffโs response fact reads: โDisputed. Plaintiff disputes the factual allegations in this paragraph to the extent \nthey contradict the Declaration of Paul Wright in support of Plaintiffโs Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. \n105-2).โ (DE 112-1 ยถ 73). This violates L.R. 56.1 in that it (1) fails to โclearly challenge any purportedly material fact \nasserted by the movant that the opponent contends is genuinely in dispute,โ S.D. Fla. L.R.(a)(2), and (2) refers \ngenerally  to  an  entire  declaration  with  no  pinpoint  cite,  id.  (b)(1)(B).  Nevertheless,  I  reviewed  the  Wright \ndeclaration. Wright represents during the limitations period, HRDC sent 14 copies of DSHLM to FDOC prisoners, at \nleast 8 of which were rejected. (DE 105-2 ยถ 15). He further represents that HRDC received notices of two \nimpoundments: March 24, 2020 and March 27, 2018. (Id. ยถ 16). Nothing in the Wright declaration disputes that the \nMarch 27, 2018 notice, which Plaintiff undisputedly received, was the first impoundment of DSHLM. Furthermore, in \nPlaintiffโs Fact ยถ 24, Plaintiff describes the March 27, 2018 notice as โthe form providing notice of the initial \nrejection or impoundmentโ of DSHLM. (DE 105-4 ยถ 24) (emphasis added). \n \n12  This is procedurally undisputed. Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 72 represents that a total of 111 issues were impounded, citing \n  to a three-page chart of such impoundments. Plaintiffโs response fact reads: โDisputed. Plaintiff disputes the factual \nallegations in this paragraph to the extent they contradict Plaintiffโs verified answer to Defendantsโ Interrogatory \nNo. 14.โ This violates L.R. 56.1 in that it (1) fails to โclearly challengeโ any purportedly material fact asserted by the \nmovant that the opponent contends is genuinely in dispute, S.D. Fla. L.R.(a)(2), and (2) does not include a pincite to \nthe location of the record evidence. It appears that the interrogatory response is embedded either in whole or in \npart into Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 72, so I assume that is the portion of the record to which Plaintiff refers. That response \nmerely states that HRDC did not receive notice for certain listed issues of PLN and CLN and โall issuesโ were \nimpounded. (See DE 104 at 11). It does not identify a number that is contrary to the number Defendants represent \nor point to anywhere in the record where that information could be found. (Id.). \n \n13  Plaintiffโs response to Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 73 is procedurally improper as explained supra at n.11. Nevertheless, I \n  reviewed the Wright declaration to which Plaintiff generally gestures. Wright lists certain issues for which HRDC \nnever received notices of impoundment. (DE 105-2 ยถ 20). This is not responsive to Defendantsโ contention that the \nNovember 2019 and May 2021 issues of CLN were not impounded and therefore no notices were required. \n \n14  After the unsupported sentence claiming that the November 2019 and May 2021 issues of CLN were initially \n  impounded, Plaintiff continues to say that โthose impoundments were overturned by the Literature Review \n11 \n \n\n \n \nHuman Rights Defense Center v. Dixon, Slip Copy (2022)   \n29 Fla. L. Weekly Fed. D 75 \n \nCommittee (โLRCโ) before being reinstated atโ two special LRC meetings, citing to an LRC form (DE 105-20). This LRC \nform says nothing about whether November 2019 and May 2021 CLN issues were initially impounded. (See generally \nDE 105-20). \n \n15  Plaintiffโs response to Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 73 is procedurally improper as explained supra at n.11. Nevertheless, I \n  reviewed the Wright declaration. Wright represents that โHRDC received notices of impoundment from FDOC for \nevery issue ofโ PLN and CLN โfrom August 2017 until this lawsuit was filed, except forโ the six notices described \nabove. (DE 105-2 ยถยถ 18, 20). Wright does not challenge or address whether those notices were ever sent. \n \n16  I recognize that the Eleventh Circuit distinguished Jones in Prison Legal News. 890 F.3d at 977 n.22. However, the \n  facts in the instant matter are meaningfully different from those in Prison Legal News. Namely, the undisputed facts \nshow that Defendant did not deliberately fail to send notices of impoundment to Plaintiff. Likewise, in Jones, the \nTenth Circuit found that it was the defendantโs negligence and human error that caused the non-delivery. 503 F.3d \nat 1162โ63. I therefore view Jones as persuasive authority here. \n \n17  Plaintiff disputes other aspects of Defendantsโ Fact ยถ 87, but does not dispute that it contacted then-Secretary Inch \n  directly.

In light of this precedent, I conclude \n  that  Defendants  were  on  notice  that  impounding \nPlaintiffโs  publications  without  prior  notice  violated \nPlaintiffโs  clearly  established  constitutional  rights. \n2. Qualified Immunity  Therefore,  Defendants  are  not  now  shielded  by  the \ndoctrine of qualified immunity. \nDefendants  also  argue  that  the  government  official    \nDefendants are protected under the doctrine of qualified   \nimmunity.

INCH, in his individual capacity and in \nhis official capacity as Secretary of the Florida \nDepartment of Corrections; JOSE COLON, in his \nindividual capacity and in his official capacity as \nWarden of Everglades Correctional Institution, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nCOMPLAINT \nPlaintiff Human Rights Defense Center (โHRDCโ) brings this action against Mark S. Inch, \nin his individual capacity and in his official capacity as Secretary of the Florida Department of \nCorrections (โFDOCโ), and Jose Colon, in his individual capacity and in his official capacity as \nWarden of Everglades Correctional Institution, to enjoin the FDOCโs repeated and continuing \nviolations of Plaintiffโs First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  FDOC has arbitrarily censored \nthree publications produced by Plaintiff, all of which provide inmates with information regarding \ntheir legal rights, wellbeing, and safety.  FDOC has done so largely with little explanation.  When \nit has explained its censorship, it has relied solely on an unconstitutionally vague regulation, which \nallows Florida prison officials to impound a publication if, among other things it โis dangerously \ninflammatoryโ or it contains certain advertising that is โprominent or prevalent throughout the \npublication.โ  F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15).  Vested with extraordinary discretion to implement this \n1 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 2 of 16\nprovisionโs undefined, vague, and overbroad terms, FDOC has failed to show that HRDCโs \npublications have affected prison security in any way.  Despite previous judicial holdings that \nFDOC has violated HRDCโs due process rights by failing to provide HRDC notice and opportunity \nto  protest  the  censorship  of  its  publications,  FDOC  has  failed  to  provide  any  meaningful \nexplanation of what content offends F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15), and it has censored several of \nPlaintiffโs publications without providing any notice or opportunity to be heard.  Those actions are \nunconstitutional.    They  have  harmed  HRDCโs  business  interests  and,  more  importantly,  its \nimportant mission to apprise inmates of their legal rights.  And this conduct violates HRDCโs \nclearly established First Amendment rights, such that HRDC is entitled not only to an injunction \nbut also to money damages. \nPARTIES \n1.  Plaintiff Human Rights Defense Center (โHRDCโ) is a not-for-profit, Washington \ncharitable corporation under IRS Code ยง 501(c)(3).  HRDC is headquartered in Lake Worth, \nFlorida.  HRDC publishes Prison Legal News, a monthly journal of prison news and analysis, and \nCriminal Legal News, a monthly magazine about criminal justice and criminal legal developments.  \nHRDC also publishes the Disciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual, a book that helps prisoners \nexercise their legal rights when confronted with a disciplinary hearing.  HRDC has subscribers of \nPrison Legal News and Criminal Legal News in all 50 states and internationally.  Subscribers \ninclude attorneys, scholars, and prisoners. \n2.  Defendant Mark S. Inch is the Secretary of the FDOC.  The FDOC is responsible \nfor the management of all correctional facilities within the state of Florida.  Inch is the highest \nranking official of the FDOC and is responsible for managing the Florida prison system.  He has \nultimate responsibility for the promulgation and enforcement of all FDOC rules and policies.  Inch \n2 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 3 of 16\nis sued in his individual capacity and in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory relief, \ndamages, and costs, including attorneysโ fees.  All FDOC actions material to this lawsuit were \ntaken under color of state law.  \n3.  Defendant Jose Colon is the Warden of Everglades Correctional Institution.  Colon \nis responsible for adhering to all FDOC rules and policies in Everglades Correctional Institution.  \nColon is sued in his individual capacity and in his official capacity for injunctive and declaratory \nrelief, damages, and costs, including attorneysโ fees.  All of Colonโs actions material to this lawsuit \nwere taken under color of state law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343 \nbecause this action arises under the U.S. Constitution and under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n5.  Venue is proper because โa substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise \nto the claimโ occurred in the Southern District of Florida.  28 U.S.C. ยง 1391.  HRDCโs principal \nplace of business is in Palm Beach County, Florida, and prisons located in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, \nDade City, Homestead, and South Bay have censored Plaintiffโs publications. \nFACTS \n \n6.  Since its founding over 30 years ago, HRDC has endeavored to educate and assist \nprisoners, especially those whose constitutional and human rights have been violated.  To that end, \nHRDC publishes Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News, which contain articles by legal \nscholars, attorneys, inmates, and news services, aimed at the prison population. Prison Legal News \nhas over 6,000 subscribers, and Criminal Legal News has over 1,500 subscribers.  True and correct \ncopies of the July 2021 issues of Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News are attached as \nExhibit 1 and Exhibit 2, respectively.  HRDC also publishes several soft-cover books, including \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 4 of 16\nthe Disciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual, which is in its second edition and has sold over \n1,400 copies.  A true and correct copy of the cover and table of contents of the Disciplinary Self-\nHelp Litigation Manual is attached as Exhibit 3.  The three publications are widely read by \nattorneys, judges, journalists, academics, and prisoners. \n7.  All three publications exist primarily to apprise prisoners of their rights.  All three \npublications comprise political speech and social commentary, which are entitled to the highest \nprotection afforded by the First Amendment. \n8.  All three publications are popular in FDOC facilities.  Nevertheless, with a scant \nfew exceptions, the FDOC has consistently impounded the three publications in many of its \nfacilities.  In doing so, the FDOC has relied on three regulatory provisions. \n9.  First, F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(i) prohibits any publication that \nis dangerously inflammatory in that it advocates or encourages riot, insurrection, \nrebellion, organized prison protest, disruption of the institution, or the violation of \nfederal law, state law, or Department rules. \n \n10.  Second, F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o) prohibits any publication that \ncontains an advertisement promoting any of the following where the advertisement \nis the focus of, rather than being incidental to, the publication, or the advertising is \nprominent or prevalent throughout the publication: \n \n1. Three-way calling services; \n2. Pen pal services; \n3. The purchase of products or services with postage stamps; or \n4. Conducting a business or profession while incarcerated. \n \n11.  Third,  F.A.C.  ยง 33-501.401(15)(e)  prohibits  any  publication  that  โencourages, \nprovides instructions on, or facilitates gambling.โ \n12.  Notwithstanding these and other prohibitions, F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15) provides \nthat โ[a]n inmate can possess a publication that is not detrimental to the security, order, or \ndisciplinary or rehabilitative interests ofโ a prison. \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 5 of 16\n13.  The  FDOC  has  applied  these  provisions  against  Plaintiff  arbitrarily  and \nunnecessarily.  As detailed below, it has impounded several copies of the Disciplinary Self-Help \nLitigation Manual, mostly without notice, and only twice justifying its decision by claiming the \nbook is โdangerously inflammatory.โ  Since May 2017, it has also impounded virtually every issue \nof Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News because they contained sporadic advertisements \nfor pen-pal and stamps-for-cash services.  Most of these advertisements were no more than two \ninches by two inches in a full-sized magazine.  In no plausible sense are any such advertisements \nโprominent or prevalent throughout the publication.โ  The following are representative examples \nof recent FDOC impoundments. \nA.  Censorship of the Disciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual \n14.   On March 24, 2020, staff at Everglades Correctional Institution impounded a copy \nof  the  Disciplinary  Self-Help  Litigation  Manual,  citing  F.A.C.  ยง 33-501.401(3)(g),  which \nauthorizes impoundment of โdangerously inflammatoryโ materials.  The notice of impoundment, \nwhich is attached as Exhibit 4, also cites F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(3)(m), a catch-all provision which \nallows the rejection of material that is a threat to the โsecurity, good order, or disciplineโ of a \nfacility.   \n15.  On March 27, 2018, staff at Santa Rosa Correctional Institution impounded a copy \nof Disciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(3)(g), which authorizes \nimpoundment of โdangerously inflammatoryโ materials.  The notice of impoundment, which is \nattached as Exhibit 5, cited pages 1 through 15 of the publication, stating that content on those \npages โ[e]ncourages disruption of the institutionโ and โotherwise presents a threat to the security, \ngood order, or discipline of the correctional system or the safety of any person.โ  Copies of those \nvery pagesโwhich introduce the book and apprise prisoners of their rights in and leading up to a \ndisciplinary hearingโare attached as Exhibit 6.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 6 of 16\n16.  In addition to these known impoundments, at least ten prisoners in seven facilities, \nincluding Lake Correctional Institution and Century Correctional Institution, have reported not \nhaving received ordered copies of Disciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual.  FDOC staff at these \nfacilities have provided Plaintiff no notice regarding these ostensible impoundments. \nB.  Censorship of Prison Legal News \n17.  On July 21, 2021, FDOC staff impounded Volume 32, Number 7, of Prison Legal \nNews, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o), which authorizes impoundment of publications that \ncontain certain advertising that is โthe focus ofโ or โprominent or prevalent throughout the \npublication,โ and F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(e), which authorizes impoundment of publications that \nโencourage[], provide[] instructions on, or facilitate[] gambling.โ  The notice of impoundment \nreceived by HRDC, which is attached as Exhibit 7, cited just four pen pal advertisements, one \nstamps for cash ad, and two ads for fantasy sportsโin a 72-page publication.  The advertisements \nfor fantasy sports make no mention of gambling, wagering, or any game of chance. \n18.  On June 23, 2021, FDOC staff impounded Volume 32, Number 6, of Prison Legal \nNews, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o).  The notice of impoundment received by HRDC, which \nis attached as Exhibit 8, cited just two pen pal advertisementsโin a 72-page publication. \n19.  On May 21, 2021, FDOC staff impounded Volume 32, Number 5, of Prison Legal \nNews, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o).  The notice of impoundment cited all of four pen pal \nadvertisements  and  two  stamps-for-cash  adsโin  a  72-page  publication.    The  notice  of \nimpoundment received by HRDC is attached as Exhibit 9. \n20.  On October 2, 2020, staff at Everglades Correctional Institution impounded a copy \nof Volume 31, Number 9, of Prison Legal News, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o).  The notice \nof impoundment cited all of four pen pal advertisements and two stamps-for-cash adsโin a 72-\npage publication.  Although Everglades CI staff did not send notice to HRDC of this rejection, a \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 7 of 16\nprisoner/subscriber did.  Attached as Exhibit 10 are the notice of impoundment, the request for \nadministrative appeal submitted by the intended inmate recipient, and the ultimate denial of appeal \nat the warden level. \n21.  In addition to these and other known impoundments, several other inmates at \nvarious FDOC facilities have reported not having received copies of Prison Legal News.  Indeed, \nHRDC has received reports of impoundment of every single issue of Prison Legal News since \n2010.    FDOC  staff  at  these  facilities  have  provided  Plaintiff  no  notice  regarding  these \nimpoundments.  Most recently, for example, an inmate at Dade Correctional Institution reported \nmissing eight issues of Prison Legal News.  HRDC has received similar reports from inmates in \nAvon Park Correctional Institution, Okaloosa Correctional Institution, Santa Rosa Correctional \nInstitution,  Wakulla  Correctional  Institution,  Putnam  Correctional  Institution,  and  Union \nCorrectional Institution, among others. \nC.  Censorship of Criminal Legal News \n22.  On July 8, 2021, FDOC impounded Volume 4, Number 7, of Criminal Legal News, \nciting F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o).  The notice of impoundment received by HRDC, which is \nattached as Exhibit 11, cited just a single pen pal advertisementโin a 56-page publication. \n23.  On April 22, 2021, FDOC staff impounded Volume 4, Number 4, of Criminal Legal \nNews, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o).  The notice of impoundment received by HRDC, which \nis attached as Exhibit 12, cited just a single pen pal advertisementโin a 56-page publication. \n24.  On March 12, 2021, FDOC impounded Volume 4, Number 3, of Criminal Legal \nNews, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o).  The notice of impoundment received by HRDC, which \nis attached as Exhibit 13, cited just a single pen pal advertisementโin a 56-page publication. \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 8 of 16\n25.  On February 1, 2021, FDOC impounded Volume 4, Number 2, of Criminal Legal \nNews, citing F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o).  The notice of impoundment received by HRDC, which \nis attached as Exhibit 14, cited just a single pen pal advertisementโin a 56-page publication.  \n26.  In addition to these and other known impoundments, several other inmates have \nreported not having received copies of Criminal Legal News.  Indeed, since its creation in \nDecember 2017, HRDC has received reports of impoundment of every single issue of Criminal \nLegal News.  FDOC staff at these facilities have provided Plaintiff no notice regarding these \nimpoundments.  Most recently, for example, an inmate at Hamilton Correctional Institution \nreported  missing  twelve  consecutive  issues  of  Criminal  Legal  News.    Marion  Correctional \nInstitution, too, appears to have categorically banned Criminal Legal News.  HRDC has received \nsimilar reports from inmates in Dade Correctional Institution, Lowell Correctional Institution, \nOkaloosa Correctional Institution, and Sumter Correctional Institution, among others. \n27.  Unsurprisingly, FDOCโs arbitrary impoundments have cost HRDC hundreds of \nsubscribers.  In December 2008, Prison Legal News had 239 subscribers within Florida prisons.  \nFollowing the resumption of the FDOCโs censorship of Plaintiffโs publications, Prison Legal News \nhas only 39 subscribers today. \n28.  In total, since May 2017, Plaintiff distributed to subscribers in Florida prisons \nthousands of copies of Prison Legal News and hundreds of copies of Criminal Legal News.  The \nvast majority of these publications were censored by Defendants. \n29.  Additionally,  since  May  2017,  Plaintiff  distributed  twelve  copies  of  the \nDisciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual to prisoners in FDOC.  At least eight of the books were \nrejected by FDOC, while, to Plaintiffโs knowledge, only two of the books were delivered. \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 9 of 16\n30.  Even if Plaintiff were given an opportunity to protest the FDOCโs decisions, F.A.C. \nยง 33-501.401(15)(o) is so vague as to prevent any reasonable reader from determining its meaning \nand application.  The provision prohibits โadvertisement promoting [prohibited activities] where \nthe advertisement is the focus of, rather than being incidental to, the publication, or the advertising \nis prominent or prevalent throughout the publication.โ  But the Florida Administrative Code offers \nno further guidance as to when an advertisement is โthe focus ofโ a publication or when, on the \nother hand, it is merely โincidental toโ it.  Nor does it define the phrase โprominent or prevalentโ \nor provide any guidance to FDOC officials as to how to determine its fulfillment. \n31.  Notwithstanding  Plaintiffโs  requests  for  an  explanation  of  what  qualifies  as \nโprominent or prevalent throughout the publication,โ the FDOC has declined to explain the \nstandards of its impoundment policy while continuing to censor Plaintiffโs publications.  \n32.  Even if Plaintiff were given an opportunity to protest the FDOCโs decisions, F.A.C. \nยง 33-501.401(15)(i) is so vague as to prevent any reasonable reader from determining its meaning \nand application.  The provision prohibits any publication that is โdangerously inflammatory in that \nit advocates or encourages riot, insurrection, rebellion, organized prison protest, disruption of the \ninstitution, or the violation of federal law, state law, or Department rules.โ  But the Florida \nAdministrative Code does not define the terms โinflammatoryโ or โdangerouslyโ or what sort of \nspeech โdisrupt[s] . . . the institution.โ  Nor does it provide any guidance to FDOC officials as to \nhow to determine its fulfillment.  \n33.  On February 14, 2020, HRDC began communicating with Defendant Inch, through \ncounsel, in an attempt to set up a meeting with Defendant Inch regarding the censorship issues \ndescribed in this complaint.  While initially receptive, FDOC counsel stopped communicating \nbefore a meeting could be set up. \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 10 of 16\n34.  On April 15, 2020, HRDC sent a letter to Defendant Inch, through counsel, \noutlining the unconstitutional censorship of Prison Legal News, Criminal Legal News, and the \nDisciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual, and requesting that he review and reverse the censorship \nof these publications by FDOC.  HRDC received no response to this letter. \n35.  On March 3, 2021, HRDC sent a letter directly to Defendant Inch, via certified \nmail, again detailing the unconstitutional censorship of Prison Legal News, Criminal Legal News, \nand the Disciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual, and requesting that he review and reverse the \ncensorship of these publications by FDOC.  HRDC received no response to this letter. \n36.  The FDOCโs impoundments have caused substantial harm to Plaintiff, inhibiting \nits First Amendment rights and reducing subscribership.  As a result of the FDOCโs censorship, \nPlaintiff has suffered the loss of numerous subscribers to its magazines.  Further, the FDOCโs \narbitrary application of F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15)(o) has chilled Plaintiffโs ability to communicate \nwith its subscribers and effectively prohibited it from advancing a legitimate political viewpoint.  \nThis application also impedes Plaintiffโs organizational purpose and wastes its limited resources. \n37.  These impoundments have come with no notice to Plaintiff or opportunity for it to \nbe heard.  They have been inconsistent, arbitrary, and, in the case of the Disciplinary Self-Help \nLitigation Manual, without any explanation at all. \n38.  None of the publications violate the law or FDOC policies because their content is \nnot โdangerously inflammatory,โ and any relevant advertisements are either non-existent or so few \nthat they could not possibly qualify as โprominent or prevalent throughout the publication.โ \n39.  Their censorship furthers no legitimate penological interest.  Plaintiffโs publications \ndo not pose any legitimate threat to prison safety or order. \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 11 of 16\n40.  There is no valid, rational connection between the FDOCโs censorship and any \nlegitimate governmental interest.  On the contrary, FDOCโs censorship has the pernicious result \nof denying inmates critical information about their legal rights. \n41.  The FDOC has twice before been sued for banning Prison Legal News.  Its \nresponses to the two lawsuits demonstrate it has no interest in complying with the law or honoring \nits commitments to the courts. \n42.  The FDOC began impounding Prison Legal News in February 2003, even though \nthe FDOC had previously approved of and delivered the publication.  Plaintiff filed suit.  But the \nFDOC artificially mooted the lawsuit by amending F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401 no fewer than three times \nduring litigation, ostensibly allowing Plaintiffโs publications into Florida prisons.  The FDOC \nrepresented to the District Court and later to the Eleventh Circuit that it would not resume \ncensoring Prison Legal News.  The case was therefore dismissed as moot.  See Prison Legal News \nv. McDonough, 200 Fed. Appโx 873, 875โ76 (11th Cir. 2006). \n43.  In 2009, the FDOC defied its commitment to the courts, revising F.A.C. ยง 33-\n501.401 and resuming its impoundment and censorship of Plaintiffโs publications.  Plaintiff filed \nsuit in 2011.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district courtโs injunction against the FDOC, \nforcing it to provide notice for each impounded publication.  See Prison Legal News v. Secretary, \nFla. Depโt of Corrections, 890 F.3d 954 (11th Cir. 2018). \n44.  The FDOC has often ignored that injunction, rejecting some issues of Prison Legal \nNews and Criminal Legal News and copies of the Disciplinary Self-Help Litigation Manual with \nno explanation or notice. \n45.  Plaintiff has appealed the rejection of its publications with the FDOCโs Literature \nReview Committee.  All of Plaintiffโs appeals have been denied without explanation.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 12 of 16\n46.  At least once, the FDOC failed to timely review HRDCโs appeal of a rejection.  On \nApril 19, 2021, FDOC informed HRDC that it had failed to conduct a โPublishers Reviewโ of the \ncensorship of the April 2020 issue of Prison Legal News and was unable to do so because it was \nโfar outside the time frame forโ such a review.  In other words, the FDOC failed to review HRDCโs \nappeal for a year and then used its delay as an excuse not to review the appeal. \nCOUNT ONE \nViolation of First and Fourteenth AmendmentsโCensorship \n \n47.  Paragraphs 1 through 46 are incorporated as if reproduced fully. \n48.  Plaintiffโs publications include political speech and enjoy the highest level of First \nAmendment speech protection. \n49.  The FDOCโs refusal to deliver the publications to Floridaโs inmates bears no \nconnection with any legitimate state interest.  Although prisoners enjoy fewer First Amendment \nrights than the general public, HRDCโs First Amendment rights are not diminished merely because \nits publications are sent to prison inmates.  \n50.  The FDOCโs censorship of all three publications constitutes a de facto blanket ban \nof HRDCโs speech and of speech directed toward prisoners to advise them of their rights. \n51.  On  information  and  belief,  the  FDOCโs  continued,  unjustified  censorship  of \nPlaintiffโs  publications  is  due  to  FDOC  officialsโ  disagreement  with  the  content  of  those \npublications. \n52.  The  FDOCโs  refusal  to  deliver  the  publications  violates  Plaintiffโs  First \nAmendment free speech rights.  \nCOUNT TWO \nViolation of Fourteenth AmendmentโVoid for Vagueness \n53.  Paragraphs 1 through 52 are incorporated as if reproduced fully. \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 13 of 16\n54.  F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15) allows the impoundment of materials in terms so vague \nthat persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at their meanings and will necessarily \ndiffer in their application. \n55.  The provision gives FDOC officials extremely broad leeway in determining which \nmaterials to accept and which to censor or impound.  FDOC officials have used that leeway here \nto censor speech they disfavor politically. \n56.  The provision is susceptible of no narrowing construction that would give Plaintiff \nor any other reasonably informed reader guidance as to what speech it prohibits.  \n57.  The provision therefore violates the Fourteenth Amendment. \nCOUNT THREE \nViolation of First and Fourteenth AmendmentsโOverbreadth \n58.  Paragraphs 1 through 57 are incorporated as if reproduced fully.  \n59.  F.A.C.  ยง 33-501.401(15)  is  unconstitutionally  overbroad  because  most  of  its \napplications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the regulationโs legitimate sweep.  \n60.  Applied here, F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15) has no legitimate application because the \nonly speech it censors threatens no legitimate state interest. \nCOUNT FOUR \n \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process ClauseโProcedural Due Process \n \n61.  Paragraphs 1 through 60 are incorporated as if reproduced fully. \n62.  The  FDOCโs  censorship  of  Plaintiffโs  publications  has  deprived  Plaintiff  of \nconstitutionally protected liberty and property interests without due process of law. \n63.  The FDOCโs failure to provide Plaintiff with constitutionally required notice and \nan opportunity to be heard and to protest the FDOCโs censorship violates the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment. \n13 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 14 of 16\nCOUNT FIVE \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendmentโs Due Process ClauseโSubstantive Due Process \n64.  Paragraphs 1 through 63 are incorporated as if reproduced fully.  \n65.  The  FDOCโs  censorship  of  Plaintiffโs  publications  has  been  arbitrary  and \ncapricious and bears no rational relationship with any state interest. \n66.  The FDOCโs conduct violates the Due Process Clausesโ substantive component, \nwhich protects against arbitrary and irrational government behavior. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief: \n(a)  Declare that Defendantsโ conduct violates Plaintiffโs rights under the First \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; \n(b)  Declare that F.A.C. ยง 33-501.401(15), as applied to Plaintiffโs publications, \nviolates Plaintiffโs rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; \n(c)  Enter preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting the FDOC \nfrom refusing to deliver Plaintiffโs publications to Florida inmate subscribers, ordering the \nFDOC to deliver all censored issues of Plaintiffโs publications which have been withheld from \ninmate subscribers to their intended recipients, and requiring the FDOC to provide Plaintiff \nwith individualized notice and an opportunity to be heard and to protest the decision each time \nPlaintiffโs publications are censored by the FDOC; \n(d)  Award Plaintiff nominal and compensatory damages against Defendants, in \ntheir individual capacities, of a sufficient amount to compensate Plaintiff for, among other \nthings, refusal to deliver past issues of Plaintiffโs publications to inmate subscribers and refusal \nto provide Plaintiff with notice and an opportunity to be heard and to protest the FDOCโs \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 15 of 16\ncensorship, as well as the impediment of Plaintiffโs ability to disseminate its political message; \nfrustration of Plaintiffโs organizational mission; diversion of resources; loss of actual and \npotential subscribers; damage to Plaintiffโs reputation; costs of printing, handling and mailing; \ncosts of staff time; and other damages to be proven at trial; \n(e)  Award Plaintiff punitive damages for violating Plaintiffโs due process rights \nin violation of the injunction; \n(f)  Award Plaintiff its reasonable costs and attorneysโ fees arising out of this \nlitigation, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and \n(g)  Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and \nequitable. \n \n               \n   \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:21-cv-81391-DMM   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 08/10/2021   Page 16 of 16\nRespectfully submitted, \nDated: August 10, 2021        /s/  Daniel Marshall______ \n              Daniel Marshall, Fla.

I agree that this issue \nwarrants expedited treatment in the interests of judicial \neconomy and conservation of resources.

I answer that question here for expediency, but I also \nintend to speak to the qualified immunity argument in my forthcoming Order on the Partiesโ cross-motions for \nsummary judgment. \n \n2  HRDC does not seek summary judgment on its damages claim.

Wright agrees that HRDC received grants to sell PLN \nand CLN subscriptions to prisoners for $1.00, and agrees that HRDC received a PPP loan. (112-9, Wright Decl. ยถยถ \n11โ12). He does not dispute the $160,000.00 figure, or that the PPP loan was forgiven. (See id.). He does dispute the \nimplication of these facts, i.e., โ[t]he [PPP] loan did not reimburse HRDC for its losses due to FDOCโs censorship.โ (Id. \nยถ 12). \n \n4  Again, Defendantsโ Fact 97 is undisputed by virtue of Plaintiffโs non-compliant effort to dispute it in the same \n  manner as Defendantsโ Fact 96. (DE 112-1 ยถ 97). Even so, Wright does not substantively dispute this fact in his \ndeclaration. He asserts that CLN subscribers averaged 4 to 5 during the limitations period, which is wholly separate \nfrom the rate of increase or lack thereof. \n \n5  Note that the figures pled are different than the figures Wright asserts in his declaration. The factual bases for the \n  numbers contained in the Wright declaration are not identified in the declaration, nor does Wright explain the \ndifference between the pleading and his present statements. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n ",
