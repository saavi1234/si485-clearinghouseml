    "summary": "<p>On November 19, 2003, a group of Black residents of the City of Zanesville, in Muskingum County, Ohio, and the Fair Housing Advocates Association filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against the city of Zanesville (\"City\"), Washington Township (\"Township\"), Washington Township Trustees, and Muskingum County Commissioners (\"County\"). The plaintiffs, represented by public interest attorneys, asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, alleging that the defendants engaged in racial discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act, the U.S. Constitution, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and Ohio state law. Specifically, the complaint claimed that the defendants denied the plaintiffs access to public water service because of their race and/or because they lived in predominantly Black neighborhoods.</p>\r\n<p>By December 19, 2005, the plaintiffs included sixty-eight individuals in addition to the Fair Housing Advocates Association. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission also joined the plaintiffs as an intervening party.</p>\r\n<p>After three and a half years of litigation and discovery, the defendants filed motions for summary judgment on March 14, 2007. In their motions, the defendants argued, among other claims, that the statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs' claims, that the plaintiffs lacked standing, that the plaintiffs failed to establish a case for their discrimination claims, and that immunity protected the government defendants from liability.</p>\r\n<p>On September 7, 2007, District Court Judge Algenon L. Marbley granted the Township defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed them as defendants in this case due to a lack of causation between the Township defendants and the injuries the plaintiffs suffered. Judge Marbley went on to grant in part and deny in part the City and County defendants' motions. Due to the undisputed fact that water service was extended to the area in question by January 2004, the Court found injunctive relief for the plaintiffs inappropriate. Additionally, Judge Marbley relied on Ohio state law to find that the plaintiffs could not recover punitive damages from the defendants. Finally, Judge Marbley found that the plaintiffs did not provide evidence as to how the County Commissioners in their individual capacities injured the plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>As such, Judge Marbley granted the City's and County's motions as to the plaintiffs' demand for injunctive relief and punitive damages and the plaintiffs' claims against the County Commissioners in their individual capacities.</p>\r\n<p>After another year of litigation, a jury trial commenced before Judge Marbley on May 12, 2008. The parties rested on June 24, 2008. Despite the County defendant's motion for a mistrial, the jury returned a verdict on July 11, 2008, in favor of all plaintiffs and holding the defendants liable for amounts ranging from $3,000 to $165,000 per plaintiff. The court clerk entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on July 17, 2008.</p>\r\n<p>Following the entry of judgment, the defendants filed motions for a mistrial, to stay the execution of the clerk's judgment, and for a new trial. Additionally, Muskingum County filed a notice of appeal as to the clerk's judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on July 31, 2008 (USCA Case Number 08-3985). On August 1, 2008, and August 20, 2008, Judge Marbley denied the City and County defendants' motions to stay.</p>\r\n<p>In March 2009, both the City and County defendants satisfied the judgment and the parties entered a stipulation of dismissal on March 20, 2009. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the defendants' appeal on April 2, 2009. As a result, this case is closed.</p>",

This  is  a  civil  rights  class  action  for declaratory and  injunctive  relief and  damages \nto  remedy  defendants’  continuing  violation  of the  rights  of African  American  and  other residents \nofa predominantly  African  American  neighborhood  in  Washington  Township,  Muskingum \nCounty,  Ohio.  Defendants  have  maintained,  and  continue  to  maintain,  a racially discriminatory \npolicy,  pattern,  and practice of intentionally denying  public  water service to  these  residents \nbecause  they are  African  American  and/or because  they reside  in  a predominantly African\n—=  ay  AS  PL;   MtAS,   AERA  RLAAETDS  f A  Pian  4  Milasnd   a  SIA 2  DPeTa. ne:  mSy a  8  ASSA PNSEP EER  sy \nWES  Auk  Ve  mA  YIPrs  4,  head  Rei  lied  WG.  oA  fh  AQUELS  BRL \nAmerican  neighborhood.  Plaintiffs  Jerry R.  Kennedy,  Richard  Kennedy,  and  Cynthia  Hairston, \non behalf of themselves  and  all  other persons  similarly situated,  and  the  Fair  Housing Advocates \nAssociation bring  this  action  pursuant to  the  Fair  Housing  Act  of 1968,  as  amended,  42  U.S.C.  § \n3601  et seg.,  42  U.S.C.  $§  1981,  1982,  1983,  Title  VI  of the  Civil  Rights  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  2000d, \nand  Ohio  Revised  Code  §  4112.02(H). \n2.  African  American  and  other  residents  of a predominantly  African  American \nneighborhood  in  Washington  Township  have  been  denied public  water  service  for nearly fifty \nyears.  During  the  same  time  period,  defendants  have  provided  water  service  to  white residents, \nincluding  white  individuals  residing  on  the  very same  streets  as  plaintiffs. \n3.  Plaintiffs’  homes  are  located  within  approximately one  mile  of public  water  lines \nand/or the  City  of Zanesville’s  water plant.  The  homes  in this  area  are built  on abandoned  coal \nmines,  and  do  not  enjoy  access  to potable  well  water.  Due  to  defendants’  ongoing  discriminatory \nrefusal  to provide  public  water  service  on an  equal  basis,  residents  unable  to  dig  wells  on  their \nproperty have  been  forced to purchase  water  from the  City  of Zanesville  at  a  cost up  to  or \nexceeding  ten times  the  price  that white  residents  pay for public  water  service.  They have  been \nforced to  haul  this water to  their homes  and  store  it  in  cisterns,  where  it  often becomes  stagnant, \nand  in  many  cases,  becomes  infested  with  insects  and parasites,  and  thereby  dangerous  for \nconsumption.  Even  those  residents  who  have  been  able  to  dig wells  on  their property,  at  great \nexpense,  cannot  use the  contaminated  well  water  for drinking  or cooking,  and  must  purchase \nwater at  a  cost  much  greater than the  cost  that white  residents pay for running  water  to  their \nhomes. \n4,  Despite  longstanding  awareness  of these  dire  circumstances,  defendants  have\ncontinually  denied  African American  and  other residents  of this  predominantly African  American \nneighborhood  access  to  public  water service,  while  permitting  white  residents,  sometimes  on  the \nvery  satne  streets,  access  to  such  service.  Defendants  also  have  authorized,  financed,  developed, \nand/or constructed  new  water projects  in  white  neighborhoods,  while  continually ignoring  the \nlongstanding,  desperate  need  for public  water  service  in  this  predominantly African  American \narea. \n5.  The  Ohio  Civil  Rights  Commission  recently investigated  defendants’  practices, \nand  on  June  12,  2003,  following  a  lengthy and  comprehensive  on-site  investigation,  concluded \nthat the  facts  “give  rise  to  the  inference  that  [defendants]  failed  to  provide  [residents]  with  access \nto  public  water  service  because  of their race,  Black  [,]  and  the  racial  composition  of their \nneighborhood.”  Hairston  v.

The  History  of Racial  Segregation  and  Discrimination  in  the  Allocation \nof Water  Service  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane Neighborhood \n22.  __ Plaintiffs  Jerry  R.  Kennedy,  Richard  Kennedy,  and  Cynthia  Hairston  reside  in  a \npredominantly African American  area of the  Township, just east  of the  City’s  border,  in \nMuskingum  County.  This  area includes  Coal  Run  Road  and  the  southern portion  of Langan  Lane \n(“Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood”).\nCase:  2:03-cv-O1047-ALM-MRA  Doc  #:  1  Filed:  DI/TS/03  Page:  8  of  d4  PAGKID  #:  8 \n23.  The  City  and  its  surrounding  area have  a  long  history of racial  segregation, \ndiscrimination,  and  intimidation.  In  the  1950s,  the  City maintained  racially  segregated  public \nrecreational  facilities,  including  swimming  pools  and  cemeteries.  Decades  after  a  1950  study by \nthe  Zanesville  Council  on  Human  Rights  concluded  that  “Negroes  can  buy only  certain homes,” \nCouncil  on  Human  Rights,  Zanesville,  Ohio,  An  Even  Break,  Human  Rights  in the  “Typical \nAmerican  City”  5-6  (2d  ed.,  1950),  African  American  residents  have  continued  to  face  racial \ndiscrimination,  harassment,  and  even  violence,  upon  attempting to  purchase,  rent,  or live  in \nhomes  outside  of historically  African American  neighborhoods.  African  American  students  in \nMuskingum  County continue to  experience  racial  harassment  and  discrimination  in  public \neducation.  As  recently as  1999,  the City was  the  site  of a Ku Klux  Klan rally. \n24.  _ Residential  segregation  in  the  Zanesville  area persists  to  this  day.  For  example, \naccording  to  data  from  the  2000  Census,  African  Americans  constitute  only 3%  of the  population \nof Washington  Township  and 4%  of the  population  of Muskingum  County.  The  census  blocks \nencompassing  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood,  however,  are  nearly 30%  African \nAmerican. \n25.  Langan  Lane  itself is  neatly divided,  at  the  side  street  Circle  Drive,  by two  racially \nsegregated  neighborhoods.  The  northern  portion  of Langan Lane,  including  Circle Drive,  is \nentirely white,  and  ends  to  the  north  at  Adamsville  Road,  which  is  nearly all  white.  In  contrast, \nthe  southern portion  of Langan  Lane  is  entirely African  American,  and  ends  to  the  south  at  Coal \nRun  Road, which  is  predominantly African American.  | \n26,  ‘In  the Coal  Run/Langan Lane neighborhood,  whether  a particular home has  access \nto  public  water  service  depends  on  the  race of its  residents  and/or the  race  of its  neighboring\nPN  ee  TEE  oy  FTP  TR  AT  RA  RAS  Maan  fe  T  RIAA  (4  fA  DENT  Me:  ~  AA  DAcTIOM  #  Oo \nresidents. \n27,  The  northern  half of Langan  Lane  and  the  side  street  Circle  Drive  are  comprised \nof nineteen  white  residences.  The  City  provides  water to  every one  of these  homes. \n28.  The  southern  half of Langan  Lane  is  comprised  of thirteen African  American \nresidences.  The  City does  not provide  water to  the  vast majority  of these  African American \nhomes.  Upon  information  and belief,  only three  of these  African  American  homes  receive  water \nservice,  due  to  their close  proximity  to  the  white  portion  of the  street,  and/or their  unilateral \nactions  in  tapping  into  existing  water  lines  serving  white  residences, \n29.  Of the  twenty-two  residences  on  Coal  Run  Road,  thirteen  are  occupied by African \nAmerican  families,  and  nine  are  occupied  by  white  families.  Not  a  single  African  American \nresident  on  Coal  Run Road receives water  service  from the  City. \n30.  The  City provides  water service  to  only  three  homes  on  Coal  Run  Road.  Every \none  of these  three  homes  is  occupied  by a white  family.  The  six  white residences  that  do  not \nreceive  water  service  are  surrounded  by or  located  in  close  proximity to  African  American \nhomes. \n31.  | Upon  information  and  belief,  all  but  one  of the  residents  of Adamsville  Road \n(where  Langan  Lane  ends  to  the  north) are  white.  All  of the  homes  on  Adamsville  Road  have \naccess  to  public  water  service.  The  only African  American  family on  the  street  purchased  its \nhome  from  a  white  owner with  pre-existing  water  service. \n32.  | Upon  information  and belief  Defendants  have  been,  and  are,  generally aware  of \nthe  demographic  information,  and  the  disparity in  access  to  public  water  service,  described \nabove.\nB.  Hardship  Resulting  from  the  Lack  of Public  Water  Service \n33.  The  site  on  which  the  homes  of plaintiffs  Jerry Kennedy,  Richard  Kennedy,  and \nCynthia  Hairston  were built  makes  surviving  without  access  to  public  water  service  an \nextraordinary  hardship.  Because  the  land  was  formerly used  for coal  mining,  the  majority of \nresidents  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  cannot  build  wells  on  their properties. \nInstead,  they must  resort  to  purchasing  water  from  the  City’s  water treatment plant  and  hauling it, \nor having  it  hauled,  to  their  homes  by the  truckload.  There,  the  water  is  stored  in cisterns,  where \nit  becomes  stagnant  if not promptly used.  Many  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane neighborhood  residents \ncatch  rainwater  in  their cisterns  in  order to  obtain  a  sufficient water  supply at  a  lower  cost,  and \nthe  water  becomes  infested  with  snails,  worms,  and  mosquitoes  before  it  is  pumped  into  their \nhomes.  These  residents  self-treat the  water with  bleach  and other  chemicals  before  using  it  to \nbathe  and  wash  dishes.  Because  the  water stored  in their  cisterns  is  often  contaminated,  most \nresidents  in the  neighborhood  with  cisterns  frequently must  buy  bottled water for drinking  and \ncooking. \n34.  Each  month,  residents  of the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  who  are \nwithout water service  or a well  pay up  to,  or  sometimes  more  than,  ten  times  as  much  to  purchase \nand  haul  water  from the  City  as  white  residents  pay  for running tap  water  in  their  homes.  In \naddition  to  the  labor required  to  purchase,  haul  and  store  water,  these  residents  also pay \nsignificant  additional  costs,  including,  for  example,  the  cost  of purchasing,  installing,  and \nmaintaining  the  cistern  and  pump,  the  cost  of purchasing and  maintaining  a  vehicle  to  haul  water, \nand  the  cost  of purchasing  chemicals  for treatment,  and  bottled  water  for  drinking  and  cooking. \nIn  addition,  they must pay  costs  associated  with  damage  to  their hot water  tanks  and  appliances \n10\nwed, ‘-  a  op he rn ewes:  aie  a r.% tad were oe \nresulting  from  contaminated  water. \n35.  Even  those  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood residents  who  have  been  able  to \nmaintain  a  well  on  their property cannot  make  full  use  of the  water obtained  from  the  well,  as  the \nformer  coal  mines  have  thoroughly contaminated  the  ground  water with  sulfur and  other \npollutants,  making the  limited well  water  supply unsafe  for  consumption.  These  residents  must \npurchase  bottled water  for  drinking  and  cooking,  and  must  pay  costs  associated  with  damage  to \ntheir hot  water tanks  and  appliances  resulting  from  contaminated water. \n36.  Due  to  the  former mining  activity  in  the  area,  plaintiff Jerry  Kennedy  has  been \nunable  to  build  a  well  for either of his  homes  on  Langan  Lane.  Instead,  because he  does  not  have \npublic  water  service,  he  has  been  forced  to  purchase  large  quantities  of water  from  the  City,  and \nhaul  the  water,  or have  it  hauled,  to  his  home  in  a truck.  Jerry Kennedy  stores  the  water  in  a \ncistern  on his  property,  where  it mixes  with  rainwater and becomes  infested  with  worms.  He \ntreats  the  water with  bleach  before  he and  his  family  use  it  for bathing and  other  non-drinking \npurposes.  Because  the  water is  unfit  for  dnnking,  Jerry Kennedy must purchase  a  separate \nsupply of drinking water  for himself and his  family. \n37,  Plaintiff Richard  Kennedy has  twice  attempted to  build  a  well  on  his  property,  but \nhas  been unable  to  do  so  due  to  former mining  activity.  Instead,  because  he does  not  have  public \nwater  service,  he  has  been  forced  to  purchase  water  for himself and  his  family  from the  City by \nthe  truck  load  and haul  the  water to  his  home,  where  he  stores  it  in a cistern  he built  on  his \nproperty.  Richard  Kennedy does  not  catch  rainwater  in  his  cistern,  and must haul  water to  his \nhome  twice  a  day. \n38.  Plaintiff Cynthia  Hairston  was  able  to  dig  a  well  on  her property,  at  great  expense, \n1]\nto  provide  a  limited  supply  of water to  her home.  Because  the  well  water is  contaminated  and \nunsafe,  Ms.  Hairston  must  purchase  drinking  water for herself and  her  family.  She  is  also  forced \nto  purchase  supplemental  water  supplies  for  any other purpose  requiring  a  significant  amount  of \nwater. \n39.  The  lack  of public  water  service  has  left plaintiffs  and  other residents  in  the  Coal \nRun/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  without  an  effective  fire  defense  system.  Upon  information  and \nbelief,  as  a  result,  at  least  some  residents  have  paid,  and  continue  to  pay,  higher premiums  for \nhomeowners  insurance. \nCc.  Defendants’  Continued  Discriminatory Denial  of Water to  the  Coal  Run/Langan \n Lane Neighborhood   \n  \n40.  Upon  information  and  belief,  defendants  exercise  overlapping  and  concurrent \nresponsibility  to  provide  water  service  to  residents  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood. \nAlthough  independent  in  name,  defendants  work  in  close  cooperation  with  one  another.  Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  defendants  have  regularly collaborated,  and  continue  to  collaborate,  on \npublic  projects,  including  water projects. \n41.  Defendants  long  have  been aware,  or should  have  been  aware,  that African \nAmerican  and  other residents  of the  predominantly African  American  Coal  Run/Langan Lane \nneighborhood  lack public  water  service to  their homes,  and  that  those  residents  not  only  desire, \nbut  require,  such  service.  Despite their knowledge,  and  their  authority  and/or  responsibility  to \nprovide  water  service  to  this  area,  defendants,  working  together,  have  intentionally  maintained, \nand  continue  to  maintain,  a  policy,  pattern,  and  practice  of denying  African  American  and  other \nresidents  of the  Coal  Run/Langan Lane neighborhood  access  to public  water  service  to  their \n12\nhomes,  while  providing  the  same  service  to  white  residents’  homes. \ni,  Discriminatory Denial  of Water Service  by  the  City  of Zanesville \n42.  For almost fifty years  and  continuing  to  the present, the  City has  knowingly, \nintentionally,  and  continually provided  water  service  to  homes  outside  the  City limits  on  a \nselective  basis,  depending  on the  race of the  residents  of the  home,  or the  racial  composition  of \nthe  neighborhood  in  which  the  home  is  located. \n43.  The  City has  maintained,  and  continues  to  maintain,  a  dual  systern  of municipal \nwater  service.  The  City has  continually  refused  to  provide  water service  to  homes  occupied  by \nAfrican  American  and  other residents  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood,  requiring \nthem  instead  to  purchase,  haul,  and  store  more  expensive  water  from  the  City’s  water treatment \nplant,  or  from  other retail  locations.  At  the  same  time,  the  City has  continually provided  water \nservice to  white  homes  in  the  same  area  or other areas  occupied  predominantly by  white \nresidents. \n44.  On  December  27,  1955,  the  City  enacted  an  ordinance  extending  water  service  to \nselect  individuals  residing  in  the  Township just outside  the  City boundary,  on  Adamsville  Road \nand the  northern portion  of Langan  Lane.  The  residents  to  whom  the  City  extended  water  service \nwere,  and  are,  nearly all  white. \n45.  Since  1955  and  continuing  to  the  present,  the  City has  provided water  service  to \nhomes  in  this  predominantly  white  area,  with  knowledge  of its  racial  composition,  but has \ndeliberately  refused  to  provide  water  service  to  the  predominantly  African  American  Coal \nRun/Langan  Lane  neighborhood,  portions  of which  border Adamsville Road.  Many  of the  white \nresidents  whose  homes  continue  to  receive  water  service  from  the  City  live  on  the  same  streets  as \n13\nS  dake\nAfrican  American  residents  who  still  do  not receive  water service  from  the City. \n46.  Throughout  the  many years  that  the  City  has  selectively provided  water  service \noutside  the  City’s  borders,  it  has  known,.or  should  have known,  about  the  desperate  need  for \npotable  running  water in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane neighborhood  and  the  longstanding \ndeprivation  suffered by its  African  American  residents. \n47.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  City  has  repeatedly denied requests  by African \nAmerican  residents  for water  service  to  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood,  while  granting \nrequests  by  white  residents.  For  example,  plaintiff Richard  Kennedy first  requested  water service \nwhen he  built  his  house  on  Langan  Lane  in  1962.  The  City denied  his  request,  stating  that  low \nwater pressure  precluded  it.  Richard  Kennedy  repeated his  request  to  the  City  several  times  in \nsubsequent  years,  and  even  offered  to  run  his  own  water  line  from  the  City’s  supply,  but  the  City \ndenied  his  request  each  time.  In  contrast,  in  1969,  1975  and  1991,  the  City  permitted white \nresidents  on  Langan  Lane  to  tap  into  the  water  lines. \nA8.  Similarly,  in  approximately  1988,  plaintiff Jerry Kennedy built his  house  on \nLangan  Lane  and  requested  permission to  tap  into  the  water  line.  The  City denied  his  request, \nciting  low  water pressure.  In  1998,  however,  the  City allowed  a white  resident  who built  a  house \non Circle  Drive,  approximately  100 yards  from  Jerry  Kennedy’s  home,  to  tap  into  the  water  line. \nMr.  Kennedy learned that  this  had  happened  when he  saw  his  white  neighbor watering his  lawn. \n49.  Studies  conducted  by  City employees  or agents  as  recently as  2002  have  noted  the \nhistory  of requests for water  service  to  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane neighborhood, and  the \ninadequacy of wells  in the  area.  At  least  one  of these  studies  specifically  acknowledged  that  for \nyears,  many  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  residents  had  been  storing water hauled  from \n14 \nMowaat- r.e   P2myy   ReeU  ROL ot  fUa - e E ~  PAR ALUIVARIAACS   4  REAVETSA  AaAay    TRLops iO aG   i  4  cRaa aesN  4 k  AGEePbUI SSOShN a  t  LOPPTaaN weU  prGaeye s   2  E~ P  S5 hes  asr?

Upon  information  and  belief,  even  after being presented  with  the \nfindings  from  these  studies,  City officials  deliberately refused  to  take  the  steps  necessary to \nprovide  clean,  safe  water to  African  American  residents  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane \nneighborhood. \n50.  On  July  16,  2002,  the  FHAA  sent the  City a  letter raising  concerns  about the  lack \nof water service  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood.  The  FHAA  requested  that  the  City \ntake  action  to  provide  the  area with water  service  and  ensure  that  its  services  and  programs  were \nprovided to  residents  on  an  equal  basis. \n51.  On  July 26,  2002,  after pressure  from  Plaintiffs’  counsel  and the  FHAA,  City \nrepresentatives  attended  a  meeting with  African  American  residents  and  representatives  from  the \nCounty  and  Washington  Township,  to  discuss  the  need  for public  water  service  in  the  Coal \nRun/Langan  Lane  neighborhood. \n52.  Notwithstanding  this  meeting,  the  City  continued  to  deny,  and to  this  day \ncontinues  to  deny,  water  service  to  African  American  and  other residents  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan \nLane  neighborhood. \n53.  The  City’s  actions  during  and  after the  July  26,  2002  meeting are  consistent  with  a \nlong  history of attempting  to  placate  residents  of the  Coal  Run/Langan Lane  neighborhood  with \nfalse  assurances  that  they  would  gain  access  to  public  water  service.  For  example,  in \napproximately the  early  1990’s,  the  City  used  documentation  of Coal  Run/Langan  Lane \nneighborhood  residents’  income  levels  to  secure grant  money to  install  a  water pumping  station \non  Adamsville  Road.  An  official  went  door-to-door  conducting  income  surveys  and  soliciting \n15\nre  my  ip. he rn berdhe:  re  oh Gad oo \nsignatures  from  Jerry Kennedy  and  other residents.  Jerry  Kennedy  was  told  that  this  information \nwould be used  to  extend  water  service  to  him.  Only after the  pump  station  was  installed  and he \ninquired  about  obtaining  water  did  the  City tell  him  the  truth:  the  pump  station,  which  is  located \napproximately  4  mile  from  Jerry Kennedy’s  home,  was  built to  improve  the  water pressure  for \nresidents  with pre-existing taps  and  would  not  be used  to  extend  water to  new  customers. \n54.  The  foregoing  constitutes  a  continuing policy,  pattern,  and practice  of \ndiscrimination  by the  City on  the  basis  of race  in  the  provision  of municipal  services. \n2.  Discriminatory Denial of Water Service  by  Washington  Township  and \nWashington  Township  Trustees \n55.  For  many  years,  the  Township  and  the  Trustees  have  been  involved  in  the \ninitiation  or provision  of water  service  to  areas  of the  Township  outside  City limits. \n56.  Upon  information  and  belief,  in  the  late  1980’s,  residents  of the  Coal  Run/Langan \nLane  neighborhood  met with the  Trustees  and  the  East  Muskingum  Water Authority and \nrequested water  service.  Their request was  denied  and  they  were  told that  running  water  lines  to \ntheir neighborhood  was  not  feasible. \n57.  In  May  2001,  the  Trustees  passed  an  emergency resolution requesting  that  the  East \nMuskingum  Water Authority  reinstate  portions  of its jurisdiction  as  an  “emergency measure \nnecessary for the  immediate preservation  of the public  health,  safety,  and  welfare  because  of the \nresidents’  immediate  need  for  safe  drinking water  and  fire  suppression.”  Comm  Order at  5  (Ex. \nA).  At  that time,  the  East Muskingum  Water Authority  lacked jurisdiction  to  provide  water \nservice to  the  Township.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the Trustees  made  this request \nspecifically for  the  purpose  of developing  a  water project  to  provide  water to  the  predominantly\nwhite  portions  of the  Township. \n58.  The  Trustees  submitted to  the  East  Muskingum  Water  Authority a reincorporation \nplan that  deliberately excluded  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood.  Upon  information  and \nbelief,  the  Trustees  intentionally  limited  the  area  for a new  water project to  portions  of \nAdamsville  Road,  Pleasant  Grove,  and  Lovers  Lane,  with  the  knowledge  that this  area  was \nvirtually  100%  white,  and that  the  homes  there  already had  access  to  potable  well  water.  Upon \ninformation  and  belief,  the  Trustees  devised  the  boundaries  of the proposed  emergency water \nproject  specifically to  exclude  areas  and/or residences  that  it  knew  were  occupied  by African \nAmericans  and  specifically to  include  areas  and/or residences  that  it knew  were  occupied  by \nwhites. \n59.  Upon  information  and  belief,  following  the  reincorporation,  the  Township  and  the \nTrustees  worked  closely with  both  the  County and the  East  Muskingum  Water Authority  to \nensure  that  the  water project  would  be  carried  out  in  the  discriminatory  manner  in  which  it  was \nplanned,  and  to  complete  the  water project  in  November 2002. \n60.  Ofthe  eighty-two  Washington  Township  residents  who  receive public  water \nservice  as  a result  of the  reincorporation,  only one  is  African  American. \n61.  The  foregoing  constitutes  a  continuing policy,  pattern,  and practice  of \ndiscrimination by the  Township  and  its  Trustees  on  the  basis  of race  in  the  provision  of \nmunicipal  services. \n17\nake  PEN  eh  eN ae  SAA  RATRA  RA,  i  4  oy  oho  173 iy  Sey  a  ety  oN  4  ra  =F  ry  AO \nase  Z .

Discriminatory Denial of Water Service  by Muskingum  County  and \nMuskingum  County  Commissioners \n62.  In  December 2000,  the  County entered  into  a  cooperative  agreement with the  East \nMuskingum  Water Authority to  provide  water  service  to  County residents.  Pursuant to  this \nagreement,  the County  initiated a  series  of water projects  to  extend  water  lines  to \noverwhelmingly white  areas  of the  County.  At  the  time  it  initiated  these  projects,  the  County \nknew  of the pressing  need  for running water  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood. \nDespite  this  knowledge,  the  County and  the  County  Commissioners  deliberately chose  to  proceed \nwith  the  scheduled  water projects  in  areas  they knew  were predominantly white. \n63.  While  commencing  and  developing  water projects  in  white  neighborhoods,  the \nCounty  and  the  County Commissioners  denied  requests  for water  service  made  by residents  of \nthe  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood.  For  example,  when  plaintiff Cynthia  Hairston  moved \ninto  her home  in  late  2000,  a  Muskingum  County  official  expressly  denied  her request  for water \nservice,  stating that  she  would  have to  dig  a  well. \n64.  In  July  2001,  however,  the  County  authorized preliminary  engineering  plans  for \nthree  separate water projects  to  extend  public  water  service  to  Adamsville  Road,  Chandlersville \nRoad,  and  Gaysport,  which  are  all-white,  or nearly all-white,  areas.  Upon  information  and belief, \nthe  County  was  aware  that residents  in  these  areas  were  all  white  or nearly all  white,  and  that \nthey already  had  access  to  potable  water from  wells.  Notwithstanding this  fact,  the  County  chose \nto provide  water to  these  white  areas  while  intentionally omitting  from  consideration  the  Coal \nRun/Langan  Lane  neighborhood,  with  its  highly contaminated  ground  water and  predominantly \nAfrican  American population. \n18\n65.  On  December  13,  2001,  at  a  County hearing to  discuss  federal  Community \nDevelopment  Block  Grant  funding  for the  Chandlersville  water project,  Jerry Kennedy publicly \nreiterated  the  need  for water service  in the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood.  Jerry  Kennedy \nexplained that his  mother  had  lived  on  Coal  Run  Road  for almost  seventy years  and  that he \nwould  like  her to  have public  water  service  in her  lifetime. \n66.  | County  Commissioner  Dorothy Montgomery flatly  denied  his  request,  stating  that \nthere  would be  no  water  there  “until  President Bush  drops spiral  bombs  in  the  holler,”  and \nemphasizing  that  even  Kennedy’s  “grandchildren’s  grandchildren  would  not  have  water.”  White \ncitizens  in  attendance  laughed  at  these  remarks. \n67.  At  the  same  hearing,  the County approved  a water project  for  the  nearly all-white \nneighborhood  of Chandlersville  Road.  In  January 2002,  the  County approved  the  Gaysport  water \nproject,  for  an  area that  is  100%  white. \n68.  On July  16,  2002,  the  FHAA  sent the  County Commissioners a  letter raising \nconcerns  about  the  lack  of water  service  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood.  The \nFHAA  requested  that  the  County take  action  to provide  the  area  with  water  service  and  ensure \nthat  its  services  and  programs  were  provided  to  residents  on  an  equal  basis. \n69.  At  the  July 26,  2002  meeting  described in paragraph  51  above,  the County \nCommissioners  were  specifically informed  of the  need  for water  service  in  the  Coal  Run/Langan \nLane neighborhood.  In  response,  County Commissioner  Don  Madden  asserted  that the  County \nwould  consider providing  water to  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  if grant  money \ncould  be  found  to  pay  for  it.  Commissioner Madden  further asserted  that  the  County did  not \nknow  how  to  apply  for grants.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the County and  the  County \n19\n-  Py  et  ot  a-   .

Upon  information  and  belief,  in November 2002,  the  County,  in  collaboration \nwith  the  Township  and  the  East  Muskingum  Water Authority,  completed  the  Adamsville  Road \nproject.  The  project  was  financed by federal  Community  Development  Block  Grant  funds.  The \nnew water  lines  installed  as  part  of the project  stopped just  north  of African  American  residences \non  Coal  Run  Road.  Rather than  extending  the  lines  less  than  one  mile  south to  include  African \nAmerican  residents,  the  County extended  an  18-inch main  to  a  Dollar General  distribution  center \nlocated approximately ten  miles  to  the  north.  The  County also  ran smaller  “tributary” lines  a \nmile  down  small  side  streets  where  as  few  as  two  or  four white  homes  were  located,  in  order  to \nprovide  water service  to  these  residents. \n71.  In  May  2003,  the  County  commenced  the  Chandlersville  water project,  which  also \nwas  financed  in part through  federal  Community Development  Block  Grant  funds. \n72.  Upon  information  and belief,  the  County has  also  considered water projects  for \nVrooms  Road  (100%  white),  Dresden  (99.9%  white),  and  the Nashport  Frazeysburg  area  (98.9% \nwhite). \n73.  The  foregoing  constitutes  a  continuing policy,  pattern,  and  practice  of \ndiscrimination by  the  County and  the  County  Commissioners  on  the  basis  of race  in  the provision \n¥  + \nof municipal  services. \n20\nOS-ov-meOt 10a4t 7-ALM-MRASA   DORoS,o   &  1  Fioy leond :  DI/TAS/y03   PPS age  %  ofdA4s   Prm AGE~ ID re  $ \nD.  Ohio  Civil  Rights  Commission  Proceedings \n  \n74.  On July  26,  2002,  twenty-five  residents  of Washington  Township,  including \nplaintiffs  Jerry  Kennedy,  Richard  Kennedy,  and  Cynthia  Hairston,  filed  a complaint  with the \nOhio  Civil  Rights  Commission  (“Commission”)  alleging  that  defendants  had  denied,  and  were \ncontinuing  to  deny,  public  water  service  to  African  American  and  other residents  in  the \nTownship.  On  August  5,  2002,  plaintiff the  FHAA  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Commission, \nasserting  similar allegations. \n75.  The  Commission  conducted  an  investigation,  and  on  June  12,  2003,  issued  an \norder  finding probable  cause  that  defendants  had  denied,  and  were  continuing to  deny,  the \ncomplainants  water  service  on  the  basis  of race  and  neighborhood  racial  composition. \nSpecifically,  the  Commission  concluded: \nFor almost  five  decades  Black residents  of Coal  Run  Road  [and]  Langan  Lane  .  .  .  waited \nto  obtain  access  to  the  water  lines  extended  by the  City of Zanesville.  Their  white \nneighbors,  residing  in  the  very same  area,  and  on  the  same  streets,  have been  provided \nwater  service  by the  City.  ... \nThe  Washington  Township  Trustees’  request to  reincorporate  a portion  of the  area \npreviously  deleted  from  the  [East  Muskingum  Water]  Authority  ...  selectively  failed  to \ninclude  the  complainants[,]}  foreclosing  their  ability to  obtain  water  services  offered by \nthe  Authority.  The  Authority reincorporated a nearly  100%  White  area,  but  failed  to \ninclude  the  complainants’  area where  20%  of the  population  is  black. \nNearly  one and  a half years  after the  Kennedys  made  the  need  for water  in  the  Langan \nLane/Coal  Run  Road  area  known  to  the  Muskingum  County  Commissioners,  no  action \nhas  been  taken  to  remedy the  request,  and  the  need  for public  water service continues  to \nexist.  Nonetheless,  the  County  Commissioners  have  completed,  or  are  in  the  process  of \ncompleting,  water projects  for  several  other  areas  in the  county,  all  of which  have  nearly \n100%  White populations. \nTaken  together,  all  of these  factors  give  rise  to  the  inference  that the  [Respondents]  failed \nto  provide  the  complainants  with  access  to  public  water because  of their race,  Black[,] \nand  the  racial  composition  of their neighborhood. \n2]\nComm.  Order at  7  (Ex.  A). \n76.  —  Since  filing  their complaint with  the  Commission,  African  American residents  of \nthe  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  have  endured  racial  harassment  and  intimidation.  For \nexample,  on  December  2,  2002,  the  day  of the  first public  hearing  held  by  County \nCommissioners  regarding  a  water project  for the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood,  plaintiff \nCynthia Hairston  found  a  severed  pig’s  head  in  her  driveway.  On  or about June  28,  2003,  a  co- \nworker of Cynthia  Hairston  warned her that  “‘you  people  out  on  Coal  Run  act  like  the  Klan  don’t \nexist  out here  any  more.” \n77,  More  than  a year after the  filing  of the  complaint  with  the  Commission,  and \nmonths  after the  Commission’s  finding of probable  cause,  African  American  and other residents \nin the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  still  do  not  have public  water  service, \n78.  Well  after the  filing  of the complaint with  the  Commission,  and  in  response  to \npressure  from  Plaintiffs’  counsel  and the  FHAA,  the  County approved plans  to  commence  a \nproject  to  provide  water  service  to  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood.  As  of this  date, \nwater  lines  have  not  been  extended to  individual  homes  of any of the  plaintiffs  or the  class  they \nseek to  represent.  Nor is  there  any plan  to  compensate  residents  in  the  affected  area  for the \nlongstanding  deprivation  of water  service  to  their homes  or  for the  significant  costs  they have \nincurred  over the  years  as  a  result  of this  deprivation.  To  the  contrary,  even  after the  water \nproject  is  completed,  at  least  some  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  residents  still  will  have  to  pay \nbetween  $500-$1,000  in  tap  fees,  in addition  to  the  cost  of running  water  lines  from  the  main  line \nto  their  individual  homes.  In  contrast,  residents  of Adamsville  Road,  who  are  predominantly \nwhite  and  will  also  benefit  from  the project,  are  not  being  charged. \n22\nE.  Injury Caused  by  Defendants’  Discriminatory Practices \n  \n1.  Injury  to  Class Representatives  and Members  of Plaintiff Class \n79.  The  pattern  and practice  of discrimination by defendants,  described  above, \nconstitutes  a  continuing  violation  of the  rights  of plaintiffs  and  the  members  of the  class  they \nseek to  represent. \n80.  As  a proximate  result  of defendants’  actions  described  above,  plaintiffs  Jerry \nKennedy,  Richard Kennedy,  and  Cynthia  Hairston,  and  the  members  of the  class  they  seek to \nrepresent,  have  suffered  and  are  continuing  to  suffer  injuries  including,  but not  limited to, \ndeprivation  of their constitutional  and  statutory rights,  economic  loss,  lack  of fire  suppression, \nhumiliation,  embarrassment,  and  emotional  distress. \n2.  Injury  to  the FHAA \n81.  The  FHAA  has  provided  and  continues  to  provide  an  array  of programs  and \nservices  designed  to  eliminate housing  discrimination  through counseling,  education,  advocacy, \nresearch,  and  enforcement  of fair housing laws. \n82.  The  FHAA  has  engaged  in and  continues  to  engage  in the  following  activities, \nservices,  and programs,  among  others: \n(a)  assisting  victims  of housing  discrimination; \n(b)  providing  counseling  and  referral  services  to  the  public  regarding housing \ndiscrimination; \n©  (c)  educating the  public  about  housing  discrimination  laws,  discriminatory \nhousing  practices,  and  the  remedies  available  for  discriminatory housing \npractices; \n(d)  working  with  tenant,  landlord,  and  community groups  to  expand  and \npromote  equal housing  opportunities  through  counseling  and  education; \n23\n(e)  assisting governmental  entities  in  meeting  their  fair housing obligations; \n(f)  informing the  public  about  housing  opportunities  and  assisting  them  in \ntaking  advantage  of these  opportunities; \n(g)  expanding  equal  housing  opportunities;  and \n(h)  serving on  various  community and  governmental  boards  designed  to \npromote  and  ensure  compliance  with  fair housing  laws. \n83.  Asa proximate  result of defendants’  discriminatory policies  and practices,  as \nalleged  above,  the  FHAA  has  been  damaged  by having  to  divert  scarce  resources  to  identify  and \ncounteract  such  discriminatory policies  and  practices  — resources  that  instead  could have  been \nused  to  provide  the  activities  and  services  identified  in paragraphs  81-82  above. \n84.  To  offset  the  effect  of defendants’  discriminatory  policies  and  practices,  the \nFHAA  has  been  required  to  devote  time,  resources,  and  money toward  efforts  to  educate \nindividuals  adversely affected  by defendants’  discriminatory practices,  regarding their rights  to \nequal  housing  opportunities  and  equal  access  to  municipal  services  and the  remedies  available  to \naddress  the  deprivation  of those  rights.  The  FHAA  also  has  been  required  to  devote  time, \nresources,  and  money toward  efforts  to  educate  governmental  entities  and  officials  regarding \ntheir  legal  responsibilities  to  provide  public  utilities  and  services  in  a non-discriminatory manner. \n85.  In  August  2002,  the  FHAA  filed  a  charge  with  the  Commission  alleging that \ndefendants  failed  to  provide  water  service to  the  area  where  plaintiffs  reside  due  to  the  racial \ncomposition  of that  area.  On June  12,  2003,  the  Commission  ruled  that there  was  probable cause \nto  believe  that  defendants’  actions  constituted  illegal  racial  discrimination. \n86.  As  a proximate  result  of defendants’  discriminatory policies  and practices,  the \nFHAA  has  been  substantially  injured  and  frustrated  in  its  mission  to  eradicate  discrimination  in \n24\nhousing,  and  in  its  efforts  to  carry out the  programs  and  services  it provides,  including  providing \ncounseling  and  referral  services  to  the  public  regarding  housing discrimination,  educating  the \npublic  about  housing  discrimination  laws,  discriminatory housing  practices,  and  the  remedies \navailable  for discriminatory housing practices,  assisting  governmental  entities  in  meeting  their \nfair  housing  obligations,  expanding  equal  housing  opportunities,  and  eliminating  discriminatory \nhousing practices. \nCLASS  ALLEGATIONS \n87.  Plaintiffs  Jerry  Kennedy,  Richard  Kennedy,  and  Cynthia  Hairston  bring this  action \non  behalf of themselves  and  all  other persons  similarly  situated.  The  class  these  plaintiffs  seek  to \nrepresent  consists  of all  residents  of Coal  Run  Road  or Langan  Lane  in  Washington  Township,  in \nMuskingum  County,  Ohio,  who  have  been  denied  public  water  service. \n88.  The proposed  class  is  too  large  to make joinder practicable.  At  this  time, \nplaintiffs  can  identify  over  sixty  class  members  who  have been  affected  by defendants’  illegal \ndiscriminatory  policies  and  practices.  Upon  information  and  belief,  discovery will  reveal  the \nexistence of additional  class  members. \n89,  This  action  presents  issues  of law  and  fact,  as  alleged  above,  that  are  common  to \nand  affect the  rights  of all  members  of the  class.  Such  issues  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, \nwhether  defendants  have  refused  to  provide public  water  service  to  the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane \nneighborhood  on  the  basis  of race,  in  violation  of federal  and  state  law. \n90.  The  claims  of the  named  plaintiffs  are  typical  of the  claims  of the  proposed  class \nas  a  whole.  Defendants  have  maintained a  deliberate  policy  and  practice  over  many years  of \ndenying public  water  service  to  plaintiffs  and  other residents  in  the  predominantly African \n25\nAmerican  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  on  the  basis  of race.  These  policies  and \npractices  affect  all  class  members  residing  in the  Coal  Run/Langan  Lane  neighborhood  and \nconstitute  illegal  racial  discrimination  on  a  class-wide  basis. \n91.  Plaintiffs  Jerry Kennedy,  Richard Kennedy,  and  Cynthia Hairston  will  adequately \nand  fairly  represent  the  interests  of the  class.  Plaintiffs  seek  no  relief antagonistic  or  adverse  to \nthe  members  of the  class.  Plaintiffs  wish  to  represent  the  class  and  have retained  counsel \nexperienced  in  litigating class  action  discrimination  claims. \n92.  This  class  action  will  lie  under Rule  23(a),  (b)(2),  and  (b)(3)  of the  Federal  Rules \nof Civil  Procedure.  As  alleged  above,  defendants  have  acted  or refused  to  act  on grounds \napplicable  to  the  entire  class,  and  questions  of law  and  fact  common  to  the members  of the  class \npredominate  over any individual  issues.  A  class  action  is  superior to  other available  methods  for \nobtaining  a  fair  and  efficient  adjudication of these  common  questions  of law  and  fact. \nCAUSES  OF ACTION \nCOUNT  I \nUnlawful  Discrimination  Under  the  Fair Housing Act \n(All  Plaintiffs  against All  Defendants) \n93.

City  of Zanesville,  et  al. \n(OSI/COL)H1071702  (26917)  080502 \nPage  2 \nOn  August  5,  2002,  the  Fair  Housing  Advocates  Association  filed  a  charge  alleging  that  the \nabove-named  Respondents  failed  to  furnish  water  service  to  the  area  where  the  complainants  in \ncharge  (OSDH1071702  (29606)  072602,  05-02-0934-8,  reside.  The  Fair  Housing  Advocates \nAssociation  further  asserts  that  significant  resources  were  expended  in  order  to  obtain \ninformation  and  identify  the  Respondents’  discriminatory  practices. \nIl.  BACKGROUND  AND  INVESTIGATION \nThe  complainants  are  residents  of  Washington  Township,  and  they  reside  in  an  area  located \ndirectly  adjacent  to  the  City  of  Zanesville  on  Coal  Run  Road,  Langan  Lane,  Russell  Street, \nWallwork  Street  and  Thomas  Street. \nAt  the  present  time,  the  Complainants’  only  sources  of  water  for  consumption  are  wells  and \ncistern  structures,  unless  they  have  truckloads  of water  hauled  to  their  homes.  Cisterns  are  water \nsystems  in  which  rainwater  is  collected  from  rooftops,  and  then  filtered  into  a  cement  structure \nlocated  in  the  ground,  and  then  pumped  into  the  home.  The  majority  of  homes  in  the  area  in \nwhich  the  complainants  reside  are  located  on  land  previously  used  for  coal  mining,  and  due  to \nthe  demolition  of the  coal  mines  within  recent  years,  the  water  is  highly  contaminated  with  sulfur \nand  other  pollutants,  making  the  limited  well  water  supply  unsafe  for  consumption. \nThe  area  in  which  the  Complainants  reside  has  a  substantial  minority population  when  compared \nto  the  surrounding  areas  within  the  Muskingum  County.  According  to  data  obtained  from  the \nU.S.  Census  Bureau,  the  area  comprising  Coal  Run  Road,  Langan  Lane  Russell  Street  and \nWallwork  Avenue  has  a  20%  Black  population. \nA.  The  City  of Zanesville \nThe  City  of Zanesville  provides  water  service  to  persons  residing  within  the  city  hmits.  The  city, \nhowever  also  provides  water  service  to  a  select  number  of  persons  residing  outside  of  the  city \nlimits  in  Muskingum  County.  A  list  of the  non-resident  customers  receiving  water  service  from \nthe  city  was  obtained  and  the  race  of  each  customer  residing  on  the  streets  listed  above  was \nverified.  Numerous  non-resident  water  customers,  almost  all  of  whom  are  White,  live  on  the \nsame  streets  as  the  complainants  (Langan  Lane,  Coal  Run  Road,  Russell  Street  and  Wallwork \nAvenue). \nThe  furnishing  of water  service  to  non-residents  began  in  1955  when  an  ordinance  passed  by  the \nZanesville  City  Council  extended  water  lines  and  service  outside  the  city  limits  to  the  residents \non  a  portion  of  Adamsville  Road  and  Langan  Lane.  The  ordinance  imposed  the  following \nrequirements:  (1)  all  lines  must  meet  specifications  detailed  in  the  ordinance,  (2)  residents  must \nassume  the  cost  of the  construction,  which  was  to  be  supervised  by  the  City  Superintendent  of\nCynthia  and  Lynn  Hairston,  Jerry  Kennedy,  et  al.  v.  City  of Zanesville,  et  al. \n(OSI)H1071702  (29606)  072602,  05-02-0934-8 \nFair Housing  Advocates  Association  v.  City  of Zanesville,  et  al. \n(OSYCOL)H1071702  (26917)  080502 \nPage  3 \nWater  Works,  (3)  a  designated  number  of  fire  plugs  must  be  installed  by  each  resident,  (4)  the \nresidents  utilizing  the  line  must  agree  to  use  their  efforts  and  influence  on  behalf of annexation  to \nthe  City  of Zanesville,  and  (5)  residents  must  pay  the  regular rate  for  water  use  plus  ten  percent. \nThe  complainants’,  as  well  as  the  persons  that  began  receiving  water  service  from  the  City  of \nZanesville  after  the  passage  of  this  ordinance,  reside  just  outside  the  city  limits  on  the  eastern \nboarder  in  Muskingum  County.  Nearly  all  Black  families  residing  in  the  bottom-half portion  of \n_  Langan  Lane,  Coal  Run  Road,  Wallwork  Avenue,  Russell  Street  and  Thomas  Street,  have  yet  to \nbe  provided  access  to  the  water  services  provided  by the  City. \nOn  Langan  Lane  and  Circle  Drive  (a  small  side  street)  there  are  26  total  residences,  of which  18 \nare  White  residences  and  8  are  Black  residences.  Each  of the  18  homes  belonging  to  the  White \nresidents  (located  at  the  top-half  portion  of  Langan  Lane  and  extending  to,  and  mncluding  the \nentire  length  of,  Circle  Drive)  have  water  service  provided  by  the  City  of Zanesville. \nThe  bottom-half portion  of  Langan  Lane  is  comprised  entirely  of Black  residences.  Only  three \nof  the  eight  homes  belonging  to  Black  reisdents  receive  water  service  from  the  City.  The \nremaining  five  Black  families  have  not  been  provided  access  to  the  City’s  water  services. \nThe  three  Black  residents  on  Langan  Lane  receiving  water,  moreover,  did  not  obtain  access  to \nthe  City’s  water  service  at  the  time  that  the  1955  ordinance  was  passed  and  implemented.  One \nBlack  resident,  whose  home  is  located  at  1180  Langan  Lane,  installed  a  water  line  to  his  home \nseveral  years  after  the  passage  of  the  ordinance  and  was  permitted  to  tap  into  the  existing  line \nwhich  already  served  several  White  residents  on  the  street.  Mrs.  Elton  Hill,  who  lives  next  door \nto  Mr.  Melvin  Hill,  states  that,  in  approximately  the  early  1980’s,  she  and  her  husband  dug  and \ninstalled  a  water  line  from  Melvin  Hill’s  property  to  their  own  home  and  the  trailer  on  their \nproperty  located  at  1160  Langan  Lane.  A  document  from a city  official  indicates  that  the  tap  to \nMrs.  Elton  Hili’s  home  was  questioned  on  the  basis  of legality  because  the  home  was  tapped  into \nand  using  water  from  another  residence  without  having  prior  authorized  approval.  Mrs.  Elton \nHill  states  that,  after  her  home  was  tapped  into  Melvin  Hills’  line,  she  informed  the  City  and  was \npermitted  to  pay  the  required  tap  fees  in  order  to  become  a paying  customer. \nOn  Coal  Run  Road,  there  are  23  total  residences,  of  which  17  are  Black  residences,  and  5  are \nWhite  residences.  According  to  water  account  records,  the  only  residents  who  receive  water \nservice  from  the  City  are  two  White  residents.  None  of the  Black  residences  on  Coal  Run  Road \nhave  been  granted  permission  to  tap  into  water  lines  to  receive  water  service  from  the  city. \nOn  Russell  Street,  there  are  13  total  residences,  of which  11  are  occupied  by  White  residences, \nand  2  are  Black  residences.  According  to  water  account  records,  11  residents  on  Russell  Street \nare  receiving  water  service  from  the  City  of Zanesville.  All  but  one  of these  are  comprised  of\na  4  Freed poy  isd oO  po?  7 ter  ond faye  a \nCynthia  and  Lynn  Hairston,  Jerry Kennedy,  et  al.  v.

Moreover,  the  single  Black  resident  receiving  water  services  is  not  the  onginal \nowner,  but  rather  bought  the  home  from  a  White  resident  with  pre-existing  water  service. \nFinally,  the  one  White  family  not  receiving  water  service  owns  a  home  located  at  1674  Russeil \nStreet,  which  is  next  door  to  a  Black  resident,  that  likewise  does  not  receive  City water  service. \nRobert  J.  Pletcher,  City  Water  Superintendent,  conducted  a  study  in  March  2000  regarding  the \nextension  of water  lines  to  unsupplied  areas  of Langan  Lane,  Coal  Run  Road,  Wallwork  Avenue \n-  and  Russell  Street.  According  to  the  study,  Pletcher  acknowledges  that  the  complainants  have \nrequested  water  service  to  be  provided  to  their  area  from  the  City  of  Zanesville  for  at  least  the \npast  35  years.  A  preliminary  engineering  study  was  conducted  in  2002  at  the  request  of the  City, \nand  this  study  also  acknowledges  requests  made  over  the  last  35  years  by  the  complainants  for \nwater  service.  Nonetheless,  the  City  of  Zanesville  has  not  permitted  the  remaining  residents, \nwho  are  Black  or  residing  near  Black  residents,  to  obtain  access  to  water. \nThe  City  of Zanesville  contends  that  it  has  no  obhgation  to  provide  water  service  to  areas  located \noutside  the  city  limits.  Water  account  records,  however,  demonstrate  that  several  persons \nresiding  outside  the  city  limits  are  customers  receiving  water  service  from  the  City  of Zanesville, \nincluding  persons  who  reside  on  the  same  streets  as  the  complainants  (e.g.,  Langan  Lane,  Coal \nRun  Road,  Russell  Street  and  Wallwork  Avenue). \nIn  addition,  as  recently  as  1998,  the  City  has  extended  water  service  to  a  non-resident  who \nresides  near  the  complainants.  The  home  located  at  1730  Circle  Drive  was  built  in  1997,  and  the \nCity  granted  permission  to  the  owner  to  tap  into  the  water  lines  the  following  year.  The  home, \nwhich  is  occupied  by  a  White  resident,  is  located  approximately  100  yards  from  the  home  of  a \nBlack  residence,  located  at  1155  Langan  Lane,  that  has  not  been  granted  permission  to  tap  into \nthe  water  system  or  receive  water  service  from  the  City.  Similarly,  the  homes  located  at  1520, \n1580  and  1675  Langan  Lane,  occupied  by  White  residents,  were  built  as  late  as  1969,  1975  and \n1991,  respectively,  and  each  of  these  residents  are  City  customers  according  to  water  account \nrecords. \nB.  The  East  Muskingum  Water  Authority  and  Washington  Township \nEstablished  in  1967,  the  East  Muskingum  Water  Authority  was  organized  as  a  regional  water \ndistrict  to  provide  water  service  within  set  geographical  boundaries.  The  original  boundaries  of \nthe  Authority  included  several  streets  within  Washington  Township,  including  Langan  Lane, \nCoal  Run  Road,  Wallwork  Avenue  and  Russell  Street.  None  of  the  residents  on  these  streets, \nhowever,  have  ever  received  water  service  from  the  Authority. \nIn  1984,  the  Authority  petitioned  the  Muskingum  County  Court  of  Common  Pleas  to  amend  its \ngeographical  boundaries.  The  reorganization  of boundaries  deleted  Coal  Run  Road,  Langan\nCynthia  and  Lynn  Hairston,  Jerry Kennedy,  et  al.  v.  City  of Zanesville,  et  al. \n(OSI)H1071702  (29606)  072602,  05-02-0934-8 \nFair  Housing  Advocates  Association v.  City  of Zanesville,  et  al. \n(OSY/COL)H1071702  (26917)  080502 \nPage  5 \nLane,  Wallwork  Avenue  and  Russell  Street  from  its  jurisdiction.  The  Authority  concluded  that \nthis  area  should  be  deleted  because  it  was  being  provided  with  water  services  by  the  City  of \nZanesville  through  water  lines  previously  extended  to  the  area.  Ultimately,  the  petition  was \ngranted,  and  the  boundaries  of the  Authority’s jurisdiction  were  reorganized. \nIn  May  2001,  the  Authority  received  a  resolution  from  the  Washington  Township  Trustees  to \nreincorporate  a  portion  of the  previously  deleted  area.  The  request  was  made  as  an  “emergency \nmeasure  necessary  for  the  immediate  preservation  of  the  public  health,  safety,  and  welfare \nbecause  of the  residents’  immediate  need  for  safe  drinking  water  and  fire  suppression.”  The  area \nto  be  reincorporated  included  portions  of  Pleasant  Grove,  Old  Adamsville  Road  and  Lovers \nLane.  The  reincorporated  area,  however,  did  not  include  Langan  Lane,  Coal  Run  Road, \nWallwork  Avenue  or  Russell  Street.  According  to  data  obtained  from  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau, \nthe  reincorporated  area  has  a  Black  population  of  less  than  1%.  In  stark  contrast,  the  area \ncomprising  Coal  Run  Road,  Langan  Lane,  Russell  Street,  Wallwork  Avenue  and  Thomas  Street \nhas  a 20%  Black  population. \nThe  re-incorporation  of the  above-mentioned  areas  resulted  in  the  Authority’s  decision  to  extend \nwater  lines  and  begin  providing  water  service  to  residents  of the  area.  This  project  is  referred  to \nas  the  Pleasant  Grove  Road  water  project.  According  to  water  account  records,  the \nreincorporated  area  resulted  in  82  new  customers.  Only  one  of the  new  customers,  however,  is  a \nBlack  resident. \nC.  Muskingum  County \nIn  December  2000,  the  Authority  entered  into  a  Cooperative  Water  Agreement  with,  Muskingum \nCounty  in  order  to  provide  water  service  to  the  residents  in  each  entities  respective jurisdiction. \nThis  agreement  provided  the  County  with  a  source  of  water  from  the  Authority,  enabling  the \nCounty  to  buiid  distribution  facilities  so  that  water  service  could  be  provided  to  a  range  of \nprospective  customers. \nThe  County  began  a  series  of projects  in  an  attempt  to  provide  prospective  customers  and  areas  - \n‘with  water  service.  Among  the  areas  where  projects  were  initiated  by  the  County  are  Adamsville \nRoad,  Chandlersville  and  Gaysport.  The  County  authorized  preliminary  engineering  plans  to  be \nconducted  for  all  three  areas  listed  above  in  July  2001.  According  to  data  obtained  from  the  U.S. \nCensus  Bureau,  the  Black  population  in  the  area  comprising  the  Adamsville  Road  accounts  for \nless  than  1%  of the  area’s  total  population,  the  area  comprising  the  Chandlersville  project  has  a \n4.2%  Black  population  and  the  area  compnsing  the  Gaysport  area  has  a  0.0%  Black  population. \nAgain,  this  stands  in  stark  contrast  to  the  area  comprising  Coal  Run  Road,  Langan  Lane,  Russell \nStreet,  Wallwork  Avenue  and  Thomas  Street,  which  has  a  20%  Black  population.\n‘KP S eoew aNtt t SgaeD,  e   yAPel so c d Ue  w“e ote ea wv mew e OPy Ewe  Let Sgf Leeat y tRE E>, A  ’ 4 fFfa  ;o «g£ 3a f   real w5T eVeEsTa  n SUwe A EYM4  SeE E : AG? go  po?  7 uw  eens  at  OO rerrdery  a  wd  hee  v “ \nCynthia  and  Lynn  Hairston,  Jerry  Kennedy,  et  al.  v.

At  the  conclusion  of the  contract,  the  Authority  decided  to  extend  service \nto  a  portion  of the  area,  specifically  Adamsville  Road.  On  May  13,  2002,  the  Board  of  County \nCommissioners  approved  and  authorized  the  start  of  construction  for  the  Adamsville  Road \nproject.  The  project  was  completed  and  regarded  as  a  financially  feasible  project  without  a \nsource  of funding  for  Low  to  Moderate  Income  families. \nOn  December  13,  2001,  the  Board  of  County  Commissioners  held  a  public  hearing  in  order  to \ndiscuss  the  possibility  of  obtaining  Community  Development  Block  Grant  funding  to  assist  in \nthe  completion  of the  Chandlersville  project.  In  attendance  at  this  meeting  were  Jerry  Kennedy \nand  Richard  Kennedy,  two  residents  of  the  Langan  Lane  area.  Both  gentiemen  expressed  the \nneed  for  water  in  the  Langan  Lane  area  to  the  Commissioners  at  this  public  hearing. \nRichard  Kennedy  and  Jerry  Kennedy  gave  their  account  of the  events  that  occurred  during  the \npublic  hearing  that  took  place  on  December  13,  2001.  They  stated  that  a  County  Commissioner, \nDorothy  Montgomery,  responded  to  their  request  for  water  by  saying  that  they  “won’t  have \nwater  until  President  Bush  drops  spiral  bombs  in  the  holler,”  and  that  even  their  “grandchildren’s \ngrandchildren  would  not  have  water.”  Cindy  Hairston  and  Joyce  Hill  confirmed  the  Kennedys’ \naccount  of  these  events,  stating  that  the  men  visited  them  at  their  homes  on  the  night  of  the \npublic  hearing  visibly upset  about  the  comments. \nAccording  to  the  County  Commissioner  Board  members,  the  county  water  projects,  including  the \nAdamsville  Road,  Chandlersville  and  Gaysport  projects,  were  started  when  the  County  received \npetitions  or  formal  requests  for  water  services  in  those  areas.  Ed  Kenily,  County  Commissioner, \nstates  that  the  County  was  not  aware  of the  need  for  water  in  the  Langan  Lane/Coal  Run  Road \narea  until  the  public  hearing  in  December  2001.  However,  the  position  statement  submitted  by \nthe  County  acknowledges  that  they  had  been  previously  approached  by  City  officials  for  the  City \nof  Zanesville  with  a  request  for  financial  participation.  The  County  states  that  at  that  time  the \nproject  was  not  financially  feasible. \nDorothy  Montgomery  also  Stated  that  the  County  Commissioners  are  considering  additional \nwater projects  to  be  completed  by  the  County.  These  projects  include  Vroom  Road,  Dresden  and \nthe  Nashport/Frazeysburg  area.  Data  obtained  from  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  indicates  that  the \nBlack  population  in  these  areas  is  0%,  0.1%  and  1.1%,  respectively,  which  again  shows a drastic \ndifference  in  the  Black  population  of  these  areas  as  compared  to  the  area  of  Coal  Run  Road, \nLangan  Lane,  Russell  Street,  and  Wallwork  Avenue. \nThe  water  projects  initiated  by  the  Commissioners  for  the  areas  of Chandlersville  and  Gaysport \nhave  entered  the  beginning  phases  towards  completion.

The  Chandlersville  project  began  in  May  2003  with  project \nengineer  bids  submitted  to  the  County,  and  is  anticipated  to  near  completion  within  4  months. \nThe  project  for  the  Gaysport  area  was  approved  in  January  2002  and  preliminary  engineering \ndesigns  have  been  completed. \nAs  announced  in  the  Zanesville  Times  Recorder  on  May  9,  2003,  the  Commissioners  sought \nfunding  through  a  state  issued  Community  Development  Block  Grant  for  the  resident  hook  up \nfees  in  the  Chandlersville  project  for  those  who  qualified  as  low  to  moderate  income  (LMI) \nhouseholds.  The  grant  totaled  $500,000,  of which  $100,000  was  designated  for  hook-up  fees  for \nthese  families.  The  tap  fee  payment  schedule  distributed  to  the  residents  of the  Coal  Run  Road, \nLangan  Lane,  Russell  Street,  and  Wallwork  Avenue  area,  however,  indicated  that  the  fees  would \nbe  $500.00  before  the  project  commenced,  $600.00  while  the  project  was  under  construction  and \n$1500.00  when  the  project  is  completed.  The  residents  have  not  been  informed  that \nsupplemental  sources  of  funding  have  been  requested  in  order  to  assist  LMI  families  with  tap \nfees  nor have  they  been  informed  of whether  or not  they  qualify  for  such  funding. \nHI.  ANALYSIS \nFor  almost  five  decades  Black  residents  of  Coal  Run  Road,  Langan  Lane,  Russell  Street, \nWallwork  Avenue  and  Thomas  Street  waited  to  obtain  access  to  the  water  lines  extended  by  the \nCity  of  Zanesville.  Their  White  neighbors,  residing  in  the  very  same  area,  and  on  the  same \nstreets,  have  been  provided  water  service  by  the  City.  Indeed,  one  of the  White  neighbors  was  - \nprovided  water  service  only  a  few  years  earlier  in  1998. \nThe  Washington  Township  Trustees  request  to  reincorporate  a  portion  of  the  area  previously \ndeleted  from  the  Authority,  and  the  decision  to  reincorporate  the  area  by  the  East  Muskingum \nWater  Authority,  selectively  failed  to  include  the  complainants  foreclosing  their  ability  to  obtain \nwater  services  offered  by  the  Authority.  The  Authority  reincorporated  a  nearly  100%  White  area \nbut,  failed  to  include  the  complainants  area  where  20%  of the  population  is  Black. \nNearly  one  and  a  half years  after  the  Kennedys  made  the  need  for  water  in  the  Langan  Lane/Coal \nRuh  Road  area  known  to  the  Muskingum  County  Commissioners,  no  action  has  been  taken  to \nremedy  the  request,  and  the  need  for  public  water  service  continues  to  exist.  Nonetheless,  the \nCounty  Commissioners  have  completed,  or  are  in  the  process  of  completing,  water  projects  for \nseveral  other  areas  in  the  county,  all  of which  have  nearly  100%  White  populations. \nTaken  together,  all  of  these  factors  give  rise  to  the  inference  that  the  Respondent’s  failed  to \nprovide  the  complainants  with  access  to  public  water  service  because  of their  race,  Black  and  the \nracial  composition  of their  neighborhood.\nPWgwu  yGOe.   aolfT  PO  Ra er ao_ e a smm as!   7  eE ef  tne  ‘ eia  daC  aw ?op  )8  erer  a  latar  aw  gp  3 no\nCynthia  and  Lynn  Hairston,  Jerry  Kennedy,  et  al.  v.
