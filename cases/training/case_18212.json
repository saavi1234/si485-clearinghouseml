    "summary": "<p>On December 16, 1998, a group of 12 African American residents of the Cadillac Heights neighborhood of Dallas brought suit against the City of Dallas in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging that the City had provided, and continued to provide, municipal services in the neighborhood in a racially- and ethnically-discriminatory manner. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 27, 1999, in which they specifically alleged the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the City had refused to extend the Trinity River levee system to protect Cadillac Heights from flooding and had taken no steps to provide for flood protection in the neighborhood despite approval of a bond issue in 1995 that included funding for such projects;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>the City's industrial zoning practices had resulted in disproportionate harm to African American populations in Dallas, including Cadillac Heights where a portion of the neighborhood was subjected to blighting influences due to being zoned for heavy industrial use;</li>\r\n<li>the City had refused to take steps to protect Cadillac Heights residents from the harmful effects of two lead smelters that formerly operated in the area despite using its zoning powers and municipal authority to protect predominately white neighborhoods from these effects;</li>\r\n<li>the City had allowed two illegal landfills to operate within Cadillac Heights;</li>\r\n<li>the streets and storm water drainage facilities in Cadillac Heights are below standards, thus causing flooding;</li>\r\n<li>there were no sidewalks on many residential streets in Cadillac Heights;</li>\r\n<li>the City had not used federal funding, including funding from the Community Development Block Grant, to improve conditions in Cadillac Heights; and</li>\r\n<li>the City had implemented housing and community development programs targeted for low-income neighborhoods and persons in a racially disparate manner.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that the City's discrimination in the provision of flood protection, zoning, environmental controls, infrastructure, and remedial housing and community development had caused Cadillac Heights to become blighted and undesirable. Moreover, Plaintiffs alleged they had suffered from a decrease in property values, fear of harm from the conditions, the physical impacts of being subjected to substandard neighborhood conditions, and the stigma of living in a neighborhood with blighted conditions. Plaintiffs asserted the City's actions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; &sect; 1981; and provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. They sought to recover damages, including for mental and emotional suffering and pain; punitive damages; court costs, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees; and injunctive relief including appropriate relief for the Trinity River flooding, a complete environmental cleanup, the elimination of the landfills, infrastructure improvements, new housing units, housing rehabilitation programs, back zoning to prevent future adjoining industrial uses and the expansion of existing uses, and monitoring and strict enforcement of environmental quality and pollution requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout January 2001, four of the 12 plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against the City. Thereafter, in June 2001, the City moved for summary judgment, and on February 14, 2002, District Judge Sidney A. Fitzgerald issued a memorandum opinion and order granting the motion in part and denying the motion in part. 2002 WL 230834. Judge Fitzgerald granted summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' claims related to housing and community development. Judge Fitzgerald also granted summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' claims for damages for emotional harm and for punitive damages. However, Judge Fitzgerald denied summary judgment on Plaintiffs' flood protection claims; Plaintiffs&rsquo; zoning, industrial nuisance, and landfill practices-related claims; and Plaintiffs' streets and drainage-related claims. Moreover, Judge Fitzgerald denied summary judgment on the question of damages stemming from the diminution in value of plaintiffs&rsquo; property.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2002, the Dallas City Council unanimously approved setting aside $535,000 to settle the suit. On September 4, 2002, the remaining plaintiffs formally agreed to settle their suit against the City. As part of the terms of the settlement, the City agreed to purchase Plaintiffs' homes in the Cadillac Heights neighborhood for a total of $270,000. The City also agreed to pay $265,000 in attorney's fees. On September 6, 2002, Judge Fitzgerald granted the parties' joint motion to dismiss.&nbsp;</p>",

See D.App. 227, 238, 249.  New  Jersey  Rooming  &  Boarding  House  Owners  v. \nViewing  the  responses  of  Crawford,  Hayden,  and  the  Asbury Park, 152 F.3d 217, 225 (3d Cir.1998), observed \nThomases  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  them  as  that “it is not clear that punitive damages can ever be \nnonmovants, see id. at 260, 271–72, 284–85, they may be  awarded against a municipal defendant.” The Asbury Park \nsaid  to  contain  only  uncorroborated  and  conclusory  court reasoned the only potential availability of punitive \nallegations of emotional harm that are insufficient to raise  damages  was  found  in  the  Supreme  Court’s \na genuine issue of material fact. See Brady, 145 F.3d at  pronouncement in City of Newport that “[i]t is perhaps \n718.  possible to imagine an extreme situation where taxpayers \n   are directly responsible for perpetrating an outrageous \n*17  The  court  therefore  grants  summary  judgment  abuse of constitutional rights.” City of Newport, 453 U.S. \ndismissing plaintiffs’ claims for damages for emotional  at 267 n. 29. The court in Asbury Park held that, because \nharm.  no such evidence was present, the municipal defendant \n   was entitled to judgment as a matter of law precluding an \n  award of punitive damages. See Asbury Park, 152 F.3d at \n  225.  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  adduce  evidence  of \n“widespread  and  knowledgeable  participation  by  the \ntaxpayers” in the discriminatory policies and customs at \nissue. Accordingly, the court holds the City is entitled to \nC \nsummary judgment dismissing their claim for punitive \ndamages. \nThe court agrees that plaintiffs cannot recover punitive \n  \ndamages  from  the  City.  The  Supreme  Court  has \nThe City’s motion for summary judgment is granted in \nconcluded “that considerations of history and policy do \npart and denied in part. \nnot support exposing a municipality to punitive damages \n  \nfor the bad faith actions of its officials” and held that “a \nSO ORDERED. \nmunicipality is immune from punitive damages under 42 \n  \nU.S.C. § 1983.” City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., \n453 U.S. 247, 271 (1981). Municipalities are also immune \nAll Citations \nfrom punitive damages under § 1981. See Poolaw v. City \nof  Anadarko,  738  F.2d  364,  366–67  (10th  Cir.1984);  Not Reported in F.Supp.2d, 2002 WL 230834 \nHeritage Homes of Attleboro, Inc. v. Seekink Water Dist., \n \n670 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1982). Addressing a claim for \nFootnotes \n \n1  Although courts have recognized that there is a private right of action under § 2000d, see, e.g., Alexander v. \n  Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 1516 (2001), plaintiffs bring their § 2000d claim through the remedial \nmechanism of § 1983. See Ps. Am. Compl. ¶ 25 (alleging inter alia that the provisions of § 2000d “are enforceable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 .”) \n \n2  In contrast with, for example, § 2000d, there is no private right of action under § 5309. Latinos Unidos De Chelsea En \n  Accion (Lucha) v. Sec’y of Hous. and Urban Dev., 799 F.2d 774 (1st Cir.1986). Plaintiffs must pursue relief for a \nviolation of this statute via § 1983. \n \n3  The City has filed objections in which it challenges some of plaintiffs’ evidence as improperly authenticated under \n  Fed.R.Evid. 901 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) and as inadmissible hearsay. In a supplement to its objections, the City has \nstipulated “that the City documents in the plaintiffs’ appendix that were produced by the City through the City \nAttorney’s Office to plaintiffs in this case, and which purport to be the product of a City Council, board, department, \nofficer, or employee, are authentic under Federal Rule of Evidence 901(7).” D. Supp. to Objs. at 1. The evidence in \n  14 \n \n\n \nMiller v. City of Dallas, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n2002 WL 230834 \n \nplaintiffs’ appendix that is subject to the City’s hearsay challenge includes documents from the United States Army \nCorps of Engineers, the United States Census Bureau, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission and its \npredecessors,  environmental  reports  prepared  concerning  specific  industries  in  Cadillac  Heights,  depositions, \nspreadsheets containing summaries and calculations based on City and United States Census data, a journal article, \nnewspaper articles, plaintiffs’ expert reports, and maps. To the extent the court has relied on evidence to which the \nCity objects, the objections have been considered on the merits and are overruled. As to evidence to which an \nobjection has been made but on which the court has not relied for any purpose in deciding the City’s motion, the \nobjections are overruled as moot. \n \n4  Although plaintiffs devote part of their responsive brief to the argument that they need not establish a violation of \n  the FHA pursuant to an official policy, practice, custom, usage, or decision of the City, see Ps. Br. at 2–3, the court \nnotes that the City does not contend otherwise, see D. Br. at 17; D. Rep. Br. at 4 (referring only to § 1981 and § 1983 \nclaims). \n \n5  Moreover, this court will not consider on summary judgment a new argument raised in a reply brief. See, e.g., Senior \n  Unsecured Creditors’ Comm. of First RepublicBank Corp. v. FDIC, 749 F.Supp. 758, 772 (N.D.Tex.1990) (Fitzwater, J.). \n \n6  Plaintiffs and the City have briefed plaintiffs’ claims according to the Arlington Heights factors. See D. Br. at 18–20; \n  Ps. Br. at 5–29, 35–36; D. Rep. Br. at 10, 13–18. In Arlington Heights the Supreme Court addressed these factors in \nthe context of a lawsuit alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment and the FHA. See Arlington Heights, 429 \nU.S. at 254. Although the court has found no published decision that uses them to analyze a claim under § 1981 and \na § 1983 cause of action alleging violations of § 2000d or § 5309, it can discern no reason why they do not apply \nequally as well in these contexts. The function of these nonexclusive factors is to assist the trier of fact in assessing \nwhether the evidence supports a finding of intentional discrimination. See Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266, 268 \n(“The foregoing summary identifies, without purporting to be exhaustive, subjects of proper inquiry in determining \nwhether racially discriminatory intent existed.”). This purpose is not materially different whether a claim is brought \nunder one federal civil rights statute that requires proof of intentional discrimination by a public body or another \nsuch statute. \n \n7  The court addresses infra at § III(E) plaintiffs’ claims related to the City’s conduct in relation to expenditures of \n  federal funding for housing and community development that are based on alleged violations of §§ 2000d and 5309. \n \n8  Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint, filed March 27, 1999, is styled “complaint,” but as reflected in their motion for \n  leave, the court’s order granting leave to file the pleading, and the City’s treatment of the document in its summary \njudgment motion, it is clearly intended to be their first amended complaint. \n \n9  The fourth Arlington Heights factor assesses departures from the normal procedural sequence. Plaintiffs have \n  offered no evidence concerning this factor as to any of their factual claims. The sixth Arlington Heights factor \nconsiders the legislative or administrative history of the decision. Plaintiffs have cited no proof regarding this \nelement as to any of their factual claims besides the specific sequences of events leading up to those decisions. They \nhave included in their brief a section detailing administrative and judicial rulings finding the City guilty of racial \ndiscrimination throughout its history, but such rulings do not constitute a factor in the Arlington Heights analysis. \n \n10  Plaintiffs allege that “[t]he city of Dallas is a program or activity which has received federal funds in the past and is a \n  current recipient of federal funds.” Ps. Am. Compl. at ¶ 5. The court disagrees that the City of Dallas as a whole may \nbe regarded as a program or activity receiving federal assistance. See, e.g., Hodges v. Public Bldg. Comm’n of \nChicago, 864 F.Supp. 1493, 1504–05 (N.D.Ill.1994). Because the only City programs or activities that plaintiffs \nidentify as receiving federal financial assistance are those funded under the federal CDBG program, see Ps. Br. at \n32–35, the court examines the evidence set out below in assessing whether there is a genuine issue of material fact \n  15 \n \n\n \nMiller v. City of Dallas, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2002)   \n2002 WL 230834 \n \nas to plaintiffs’ § 1983 causes of action based on §§ 2000d and 5309. \n \n11  The City contends the expenditures are even higher, totaling $895,000. See Ps.App.2001. \n   \n12  Their assertion that “the City considered spending CDBG money for a park in Cadillac Heights several years ago[,]” \n  but that “[n]o CDBG or other funds were authorized for the park[,]” see Ps. Br. at 32, does not fit in any of these \ncategories.  Although  the  Arlington  Heights  factors  are  not  exclusive,  this  evidence,  considered  alone  or  in \ncombination with the other proof on which plaintiffs rely, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. \n \n13  The City has also filed a reply appendix. The court has not considered it for any purpose in deciding this motion. See \n  Dethrow v. Parkland Health Hosp. Sys., 204 F.R.D. 102, 103–04 (N.D.Tex.2001) (Fitzwater, J.). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  16 \n ",

Texas, \nDallas Division. \nCharles MILLER, et al, plaintiffs, \nv. \nTHE CITY OF DALLAS, defendant. \nNo. 3:98-CV-2955-D. \nMay 27, 1999. \nComplaint \nRespectfully Submitted, Michael M. Daniel, P.C., 3301 Elm Street, Dallas, Texas 75226-1637, 214-939-9230, Michael M. \nDaniel, State Bar No. 05360500, Laura B. Beshara, State Bar No. 02261750, Attorneys for Plaintiffs. \n1. The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ¶¶ 1331, 1343, and 42 U.S.C. ¶ 3613. \n  \nIntroduction \n  \n2. Plaintiffs bring this case to obtain damages and equitable relief for the injuries caused by the City of Dallas continuing and \nongoing racially discriminatory provision of municipal services, including the flood protection facilities, to the predominantly \nminority and low-income Cadillac Heights neighborhood. \n  \nPlaintiffs \n3. Plaintiffs are Charles Miller, Erma Cooper, Fred Crawford, Mable Hayden, George and Dorothy Thomas, Mattie and L. T. \nCooper, Louise Davis, Leesie Hollins, John Adams, and Velma Harper. Each plaintiff is an African-American who has been \na single family home owner and resident in the Cadillac Heights neighborhood of the City of Dallas. \n  \nDefendant \n4. The City of Dallas is a home rule municipality. \n  \n5. The City of Dallas is a program or activity which has received federal funds in the past and is a current recipient of federal \nfunds. \n  \nThe neighborhood \n6. The Cadillac Heights neighborhood includes census tract 89, block groups 1 and 6. Most of the residential units are in \ncensus tract 89, block group 6. The population of this block group is 98.5% minority, 40% black and 58.5% Hispanic origin. \nForty six percent of the population is below poverty. The median family income is $14,107. Sixty one percent of the \n  1 \n \n\n \nCharles MILLER, et al, plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF..., 1999 WL 34825871...   \n \n \noccupied units are owner occupied. Twenty percent of the units were vacant according to the 1990 U.S. Census. \n  \nThe discrimination \n7. The City of Dallas’ purposeful racial and ethnic discrimination in the provision of municipal services which has injured \nplaintiffs and their property includes; \n  \nflood protection \n8. The current Trinity River levee system, owned and operated by the City of Dallas, does not protect the neighborhood from \nflooding by the Trinity River. The levees were constructed to provide protection for property owned by whites. The failure to \nextend the levee protection to the Cadillac Heights neighborhood was motivated by overt racial purpose, the intent to \ndiscriminate against African-American property owners and residents. The neighborhood is subjected to periodic flooding \nfrom the Trinity River as a result of the racial discrimination. \n  \n9. The Honorable Ron Kirk, Mayor of the City of Dallas, made the following public statements about the role racial \ndiscrimination played in the construction and maintenance of the Trinity River levee system: \n  \n“In the 1940s and ‘50s, the way this river was managed was as glaring an example of environmental racism as anything in the \nwhole country,” Dallas Observer, January 22, 1998. \n  \n“Those projects stopped where the white people stopped. Its very dramatic to take a helicopter ride now and see where the \nlevees end and where poor black people and Hispanics are forced to live adjacent to the part of the river where there is no \nprotection.” \n  \n“The current levees happened to stop not coincidentally where mostly black and Hispanic families live... We now have a \nchance to confront the more ugly blatant and racial elements of our past.” Dallas Morning News, April 12, 1998. \n  \n10. The only action taken by the City to protect any part of the area from flooding was to build a levee for the City’s sewage \ntreatment plant. \n  \n11. The City included flood protection for the neighborhood in the 1995 City bond issue. The City has taken no steps to \nprovide the protection. \n  \nzoning \n12. Part of the Cadillac Heights residential neighborhood is zoned for residential use in the categories of R-5 or TH. Part of \nthe residential neighborhood is zoned for heavy industrial use in the category IR, The areas immediately adjacent to the R-5 \nTH zoned residential areas have been zoned for heavy industrial use by the City. As a direct result of the zoning, the \nneighborhood is subjected to the blighting influences and noxious effects of the adjacent industrial uses. Those uses include a \nmeat packing plant, animal rendering plants, the City’s sewage treatment plant, and outside salvage and reclamation \notherwise known as a junkyard. \n  \n13. The City’s industrial zoning has a disproportionate and adverse impact on African-American persons, including plaintiffs. \nAfrican-Americans were 29% of the City’s population according to the 1990 census. African-Americans were 45% of the \npopulation living in or within 500 feet of areas zoned for industrial use. Non-Hispanic whites and others were 50% of the \ntotal population but only 29% of the population living in or within 500 feet of areas zoned for industrial use. 12.6% of the \n  2 \n \n\n \nCharles MILLER, et al, plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF..., 1999 WL 34825871...   \n \n \nAfrican-American population was living in or within 500 feet of areas zoned for industrial use. Only 4.57% of the \nnon-Hispanic white and other persons in the City were living in or within 500 feet of areas zoned for industrial use. \n  \n14. Approximately 47% of the land used for or available for industrial uses is in census tracts such as tract 89 which are less \nthan 10% non-Hispanic white. Less than 8% of the land in 90% or greater white tracts is used for or available for industrial \nuses. \n  \nprotection from the harmful effects of industrial nuisances \n15. There were two lead smelters in the neighborhood, Dixie Metals and National Lead. The City of Dallas refused to enforce \nCity and state laws that would have ended the lead pollution caused by the smelters and agreed to cooperate with the owners \nof the smelters in order to allow the continued operation of the smelters and the continued pollution of the neighborhood. \nThere have been two cleanups for hazardous substances in the neighborhood. Young children in the neighborhood are \nexposed to and suffer from the effects of the hazardous substances. The rates of children testing high for elevated blood lead \nare some of the highest in the City. Vacant lots in the neighborhood are still marked with signs warning that the soil on the \nlots is hazardous. There are no fences or other barriers to prevent access to these lots. \n  \n16. The City has licensed and permitted other industrial facilities in the neighborhood to pollute the air and the environment \nof the residential neighborhood. DalChrome is a hazardous waste handler and a releaser of toxic substances into the \nenvironment. The City sewage treatment plant is a hazardous waste handler. The industrial uses emit foul smells into the \nresidential neighborhood. \n  \n17. The City of Dallas uses it zoning powers and other municipal authority to protect predominantly white neighborhoods \nfrom the harmful effects of industrial uses. The effect of the City’s use of its zoning powers and other municipal authority has \nbeen to leave Cadillac Heights and other predominantly minority areas disproportionately adversely affected by the harmful \neffects of industrial nuisances. \n  \nlandfill practices \n18. There are at least two illegal landfills operating with City knowledge and permission in the neighborhood. The City \npromised to close and clean up the illegal landfill at 3411 E. Kiest Blvd. Instead, the City has allowed the landfill to remain in \noperation. The City knowingly allowed the illegal landfill operated at 1240 Sargent Road to continue as a dump for lead slag \nand battery chip samples [NCTCOG Data Available for Facility U1288]. The City does not knowingly allow and permit \nillegal landfills to operate in predominantly white areas. \n  \nstreets and drainage \n19. The streets and storm water drainage facilities in the neighborhood are below City standards and flood during heavy \nrainfalls. There are no sidewalks on many of the residential streets. The predominantly white areas of the City that have been \npart of the City for the same or shorter time periods have adequate street, curbs, gutters, and storm water drainage facilities. \n  \nfederal funding for housing and community development \n20. The Cadillac Heights neighborhood is eligible and has been eligible for federal Community Development Block Grant \nfunds and other federal, state, and local housing and community development improvement programs. The use of the federal \n  3 \n \n\n \nCharles MILLER, et al, plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF..., 1999 WL 34825871...   \n \n \nfunds and programs would have eliminated, prevented, or mitigated the adverse conditions affecting the neighborhood. \n  \n21. The City of Dallas has not used its federal funds to improve the conditions in the low-income minority neighborhood of \nCadillac Heights. The City of Dallas has implemented its housing and community development programs targeted for \nlow-income neighborhoods and persons such as Cadillac Heights and its residents in a racially disparate manner. The \nprograms for minority neighborhoods are subject to delays, excessive administrative expenditures, and City failure to use the \nfunds available. The programs targeted at predominantly or majority white populations are expeditiously implemented for the \nbenefit of those persons. \n  \nThe injuries \n22. The City’s discrimination in the provision of flood protection, zoning, environmental controls, infrastructure such as \nstreets and drainage, and remedial housing and community development makes housing in Cadillac Heights unavailable by \ncreating and maintaining conditions of urban blight and other undesirable and hazardous neighborhood characteristics. The \nconditions of blight and other undesirable and hazardous conditions deter potential residents from obtaining housing in the \nneighborhood. The conditions of blight inhibit and obstruct plaintiffs and other single family home owners from selling their \nhomes by decreasing the neighborhood amenities available and by increasing the risks and inconveniences of owning \nproperty and residing in the neighborhood. \n  \n23. By making the neighborhood blighted, the City has removed the housing in the neighborhood from the normal housing \nmarket. The City has not used other available resources, e.g. local, state, or federal programs and funding, to substitute for the \nmarket and provide new or rehabilitated housing in the neighborhood. \n  \n24. The injuries inflicted upon plaintiffs by the City’s discrimination include a decrease in property values, fear of harm from \nthe conditions, the physical impacts of being subjected to substandard neighborhood conditions such as noxious odors and \nsubstandard flood protection and drainage facilities, and the stigma of living in neighborhood with blighted conditions. \n  \nThe claims for relief \n25. The City’s actions violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution equal protection provision, 42 U.S.C. § \n1981; 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); 24 CFR § § 100.70(d)(4) and 42 U.S.C. § 5309. The provisions of the \nFourteenth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. § 2000d;; 24 CFR § § 100.70(d)(4) and 42 U.S.C. § 5309 are enforceable pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ¶ 1983. \n  \nPrayer for relief \nPlaintiffs seek the following relief: \n  \na. damages including prejudgment interest and damages for emotional and mental suffering and pain, \n  \nb. punitive damages, \n  \nc. injunctive relief including appropriate relief for the Trinity River flooding, a complete environmental cleanup, the \nelimination of the landfills, infrastructure improvements, new housing units, housing rehabilitation programs, back zoning to \nprevent future adjoining industrial uses and the expansion of existing uses, and monitoring and strict enforcement of \nenvironmental quality and pollution requirements, \n  \n  4 \n \n\n \nCharles MILLER, et al, plaintiffs, v. THE CITY OF..., 1999 WL 34825871...   \n \n \nd. court costs, litigation expenses, and attorney’s fees, and \n  \ne. any other appropriate relief. \n  \nRespectfully Submitted, \n  \nMICHAEL M.
