Treadwell, III, Arcadia, Fla., for defendants. \nMEMORANDUM OF DECISION \nKRENTZMAN, District Judge. \nThe Court, having considered the pleadings, the testimony, exhibits and other evidence adduced in \nthe course of the trial, at the end of which the Court made findings in the record, and having \nconsidered the post-trial and proposed findings of fact submitted by each of the parties, and being \nadvised in the premises, makes and finds the following findings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw,[1] pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nI. FINDINGS OF FACT \nA. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1. On February 25, 1976, plaintiffs — consisting of a class of all black citizens of Arcadia, Fla. \nallegedly deprived of equal municipal services — filed a complaint based upon Hawkins v. Town of \nShaw, 303 F.Supp. 1162 (N.D.Miss.1969) rev'd 437 F.2d 1286 (5 Cir., 1971) aff'd en banc, 461 F.2d \n1171 (5th Cir. 1972) seeking that disparities in the quality and quantity of certain services provided to \nblack and white citizens be ameliorated. \n2. Plaintiffs in addition invoked the jurisdiction of this Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. \n(Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) and 31 U.S.C. § 1242 (State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act \nof 1972, hereinafter \"Revenue Sharing Act\") and sought to apply the Revenue Sharing Act's anti-\ndiscrimination provisions. See, 31 C.F.R. 5152, as amended, 40 Fed.Reg. 50029 (1952). See also, \n\nRobinson v. Schultz, 8 E.P.D. ¶ 9832 D.D.C.1974, Robinson v. Simon and United States v. \nChicago, 395 F.Supp. 329 (N.D.Ill.1975). \n3. At the same time of the filing of the complaint, plaintiffs filed two sets of interrogatories, a request \nfor production of documents and an extensive set of requests for admissions of fact concerning the \nCity's delivery of municipal services and its budgeting mechanisms and practices. \n4. On March 26, 1976, defendants filed various \"across-the-board\" pre-trial motions with supportive \nmemoranda.[2] Plaintiffs filed extensive responsive memoranda and this Court heard oral argument \non all pretrial legal issues on September 27, 1976, in Tampa, Florida. \n5. On October 21, 1976, the Court denied all of defendants' motions and directed plaintiffs' counsel \nto file a concurrent administrative complaint with the Secretary of Treasury relating to plaintiffs' \nRevenue Sharing claims. In addition, it granted plaintiffs' motion to certify this proceeding as a class \naction. Plaintiffs' class consists 1368*1368 of all black residents residing in the City of Arcadia. \n6. Thereafter, the plaintiffs conducted lengthy and complex pre-trial discovery concerning \nsophisticated financial and municipal service documents, reports and files. Counsel for plaintiffs with \nthe assistance of their technical experts reviewed a complete inventory of service and financial data \nrelating to the defendant City of Arcadia. \n7. On April 11, 1977, trial commenced. The Court heard testimony over a two-day period relating to \nplaintiffs' claims of racial discrimination in the provision of certain municipal services in the City of \nArcadia, Florida. On April 12, 1977, this Court in its bench opinion found that defendants had \nhistorically and presently perpetrated racial discrimination against plaintiffs with regard to the \nfollowing municipal services: \n(a) the distribution of water facilities; \n(b) street paving; and \n(c) park and recreational facilities. \n8. After holding that defendants had discriminated against plaintiffs, this Court enjoined defendants \nfrom spending any of the approximately $415,000 of revenue sharing funds which it had on hand or \nany future revenue sharing funds without further order of Court. Pursuant to the Court's direction it \nhas received from the parties comprehensive plans to equalize street paving, water systems, and \npark and recreational facilities in the black residential area of Arcadia. \n9. The Court has received from the parties a stipulated final judgment which this Court has examined \nand approved as to relief. The final judgment sets forth in detailed fashion the type and quality of \nimprovement works needed to eliminate racial discrimination in the provision of certain municipal \nservices in the City of Arcadia. \nB. THE PARTIES \n10. Hinton Johnson, et al., plaintiffs, are adequate representatives of a class consisting of all of the \nblack residents of the city who are presently and have been discriminated against by the defendants \nin the provision of municipal services and facilities as hereinafter set forth. (See, Court order \ncertifying class, October 21, 1976). \n11. Defendant E. Coleman Brewer is the mayor of the City, defendants Eugene Hickson, Lester \nSummerall, I. D. Eller and Walter J. Banull are the councilmen, and Margaret Way is the City \n\nRecorder. Defendants have complete responsibility for administering the affairs of the town, \nincluding the provision, allocation and financing of all municipal facilities and services. [Source: \nDefendants' response to plaintiffs' first interrogatories Nos. 2 and 5.] \n12. The City of Arcadia is a municipal corporation with a charter adopted pursuant to Chapter 5080, \nSpecial Acts of 1901 of the Florida Stat. Annotated. It was originally incorporated on December 8, \n1886, and reincorporated in 1901. In area the City is approximately two miles square. Its present \npopulation of approximately 7,000 is 32% black and 68% white. [Source: Defendants' response to \nplaintiffs' request for production and inspection of documents (City Charter and Census Reports).] \n13. The City of Arcadia has developed according to a strict pattern of residential racial segregation. \nThe entire black community is bordered by railroad tracts to the east, north and west. Parker, \nJordan, Baldwin, Manatee and Orange Streets, primarily in the black section, extend just one block \nnorth of Pine Street (which parallels the east-west railroad track). No blacks reside anywhere outside \nthis small geographical area in the southwest portion of Arcadia. Some white households are located \nin the black section, where Monroe and Orange Streets between Hargrave and Harris are integrated. \n[Source: City Map of Arcadia, defendants' Exhibit No. 4.] \n14. The City of Arcadia provides, maintains and improves certain facilities for its residents. It has \nalways been responsible for the construction and maintenance of the 1369*1369 public rights of way. \nThe City has undertaken the paving of streets, construction of park and recreational facilities and \nconstruction of an underground water system. Construction and/or improvements to these services \nhas been financed wholly from either general revenues, derived from ad valorem tax or various \nfederal monies from the following federal agencies: Department of Treasury (Revenue Sharing), \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (Low-Income Housing grants and loans) and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (Water and Sewer System grants). [Source: Defendants' \nresponses to plaintiffs' first interrogatories No. 9.] \nC. HISTORICAL DISCRIMINATION \n15. Excerpts from entries from the official city minute books of the City of Arcadia, dating back as \nearly as 1950 through the present, reveal a continuing unresponsiveness on behalf of white city \nelected officials to black citizens' needs. Specifically, City officials continually failed to act upon black \ncitizens' requests to improve or extend various city provided services to black homeowners while at \nthe same time these City officials responded affirmatively to similar requests from white citizens. \n[Source: Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 25, Excerpts from Official City Minute Books of the City of Arcadia] \n16. City officials knew that municipal service conditions in the black residential neighborhood of \nArcadia were a severe problem. In 1968, Milo-Smith Associates, a Tampa based planning and \nconsulting firm, contracted with the City of Arcadia to produce a Neighborhood Analysis, containing \nevaluations of municipal services and recommendations for future planning. In this plan, \nNeighborhood Two, which is the black community, is singled out as being the most severely blighted \narea of the City. The plan directed that the City of Arcadia invest a majority of its financial resources \nfor needed neighborhood improvements in this area. City officials failed to implement this plan. \n[Source: Milo-Smith Neighborhood Analysis, Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 4] \n17. The Milo-Smith plan called City officials' attention to the fact that \"The entire street pattern south \nof Pine Street is chaotic and to a significant degree underdeveloped.\" (Page 12) City officials did \nnothing to eliminate this chaotic condition. [Source: Milo-Smith Neighborhood Analysis, Plaintiffs' \nExhibit No. 4] \n\n18. The Milo-Smith report emphasizes the black neighborhood's lack of adequate recreation facilities \nand underground storm sewerage. While the other (white) neighborhoods analyzed in Arcadia were \nnot completely provided for in all services, Milo-Smith left little doubt that these neighborhoods had \nbeen the primary recipients of adequate municipal services. The pressing needs of the black \ncommunity were underscored in the plan's concluding remarks: \nSummary \n\"Neighborhood two contains Arcadia's largest neighborhood population and also its worst problems. \nThis may be demonstrated by the fact that 78.6% of Arcadia's substandard structures are located in \nthe neighborhood. The area has the highest incidence of fire, crime and disease. Blighting \ninfluences, though certainly a major factor for the onset of deterioration, are not the whole problem. \nResidents attempting to live and own homes on an income which is below subsistence level find it \nimpossible to maintain an adequate environment. The net result of these factors is conditions which \ndemand the greatest attention and expenditure from the City of Arcadia for this area than for any \nother neighborhood.\" (Page 13) (emphasis added) [Source: Milo-Smith Neighborhood Analysis, \nPlaintiffs' Exhibit No. 4] \n19. During an eight month period in 1968, author Marc Lane and photographer Carolyn Mugar \ninvestigated general living conditions of Arcadia's black citizens. Their investigation revealed the \nfollowing: \n1) No blacks were employed in public facilities. \n2) No blacks were seen in restaurants. \n1370*1370 3) No blacks were seen in the town's bus depot. \n4) Many blacks lived in chicken coops too small for grown individuals to stand erect inside. \n5) Streets in the black community started and stopped abruptly, making smooth, circular travel \nimpossible. \n6) The public cemetery was segregated into white and black sides. The white side was green, lush \nand well maintained. The black side was barren, treeless and overgrown. [Source: Testimony of \nPlaintiffs' Expert Witnesses: Marc Lane — Author, Investigator, Lawyer; Carolyn Mugar — \nPhotographer, Research Assistant. \n20. For at least twenty years, the City of Arcadia has regularly consulted its Planning and Zoning \nBoard on allocation of revenues, selection of projects and general administration of City government. \nMembers on the Planning and Zoning Board are appointed by City officials. The Board's primary \nresponsibility is to establish policy and priorities for the construction and maintenance of municipal \nservice improvements. Every individual who has ever sat on this board up to and including the \npresent is white. [Source: Testimony of E. Coleman Brewer, Mayor of Arcadia] \nD. MUNICIPAL STREETS \n1. STREET PAVING \n21. There is presently 261,160 feet of residential street footage (public rights of way on which one or \nmore persons reside) within the corporate limits of the town. The black population resides on 48,380 \nfeet of these streets while the white population resides on 212,780 feet. Of the 48,380 feet of \nresidential streets in the black community, 5,020, or 10.3%, are unpaved. In the white community, \nhowever, only 4.2%, or 9,075 feet of residential street footage, black to white, is 2.4 to 1. This means \nthat black residents of Arcadia are approximately two and one half times as likely as white residents \nto live on an unpaved street. \n\nA total of 1,920 households exist within the corporate limits of the City. Of the 612 households in the \nblack community, 66, or 10.7%, front on unpaved streets. In the white community, of the 1,308 \nhouseholds only 38, or 2.9%, front on unpaved streets. The ratio of percent of households fronting \nunpaved streets, black to white, is 3.6 to 1. This means that black residents of Arcadia are \napproximately three and one half times more likely than white residents to live in a household which \nfronts on an unpaved street. [Source: Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Inventory of Street Conditions; \nHereafter, Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9 and Testimony of City Administrator, Arthur Dyal] \n22. At the time of the filing of this lawsuit, March, 1976, the existing disparity in street paving service \nbetween the black and white communities was even greater than at present. This is due to the fact \nthat while the number of white unpaved streets has remained constant, a large number of black \nunpaved streets have been paved since the filing. At that time, the black community contained \n10,210 feet, (or 21.1% of its total residential street footage), of unpaved streets. The ratio of percent \nof unpaved street footage, black to white, was 5.0 to 1. Of the total households in the black \ncommunity, 107, or 17.4% fronted on unpaved streets. The ratio of households fronting unpaved \nstreets, black to white, was 6.0 to 1. [Source: Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9; Testimony of Plaintiffs' expert \nwitness Alan Paller, P.E., Engineer and Urban Systems Analyst; Testimony of City Administrator, \nArthur W. Dyal] \n23. The City of Arcadia has maintained that certain streets in the black community were unpaved \nbecause: \n1) they were undedicated; \n2) they were either abutting, or, the actual property of the Seaboard Coastline Railroad Co., and; \n3) the street was divided in half between the City and DeSoto County. \nAs to the first two defenses, the City stated that it lacked the necessary right of way to pave the \naffected streets. As to the third 1371*1371 defense the City stated that it was not responsible for \nstreet paving based on its agreement with the county. \n24. The City of Arcadia has maintained that the following streets are undedicated: \n1. No Name # 1 (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact 22) \n2. No Name # 2 (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact 26.1c) \n3. Myrtle St. (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact 26.1b) \n4. Entrance to Gym (Defendants' Exhibit No. 5) \n25. At least since 1970, the streets listed supra., have been maintained in a continuous and \nuninterrupted manner. Street surfaces have been shelled and graded, garbage has been collected \nregularly and routine maintenance has been performed upon citizen request. Florida law is \ninstructive: \n\"When a road, constructed by a county, or municipality, or the Division of Road Operations, has \nbeen maintained or repaired continuously and uninterruptedly for four years by the county, \nmunicipality, or Division of Road Operations, jointly or severally, the road shall be (deemed to be) \ndedicated to the public to the extent in width that has been actually maintained for the prescribed \nperiod, whether the road has been formally established as a public highway or not.\"[3] Fla.Stat.Ann. § \n95.361 (1976) \n26. Furthermore, municipal services normally afforded residents of City streets of Arcadia, i. e. street \nlights, fire hydrants, underground water and underground sewer lines are provided on the streets \nlisted herein. \n\n27. As a second defense, the City of Arcadia argued that it was unable to pave the following two \nstreets because of legal ownership issues involving the Atlantic Coastline Railroad: \n1) Pine Street (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact No. 30-a) \n2) Tillis Street (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact No. 33) \n28. Pine Street has been regularly shelled and graded, had garbage collected and has otherwise \nbeen maintained in a continuous and uninterrupted manner for at least seven years. As such, it is \nundisputably a dedicated public right of way and presents no legal obstacles to paving contrary to \nthe City's assertions. \n29. The City of Arcadia argued that it had no legal access to pave Tillis Street because such access \nrequired crossing railroad property. Tillis Street, however, has been maintained in a continuous and \nuninterrupted manner by the City for at least seven years. In so doing, the City has regularly utilized \nrailroad property for access to the street. \n30. Up to the time of trial, the City, through its public officials, had never approached the Railroad \nCompany with a request for their permission to gain access for paving, it has now done so. \n31. Hargrave Street forms the City limit in the southwest portion of the City. To the south of its center \nline is county property, to the north is City property. By agreement between the two governing \nbodies, the county does the actual maintenance of the street, which has proceeded continuously and \nuninterruptedly for at least seven years. DeSoto County bills the City proportionally for the \nmaintenance work performed on its portion of Hargrave. By virtue of its continuous maintenance, \nthe 1372*1372 City's claim that Hargrave Street is an undedicated street is unfounded. \n32. The City of Arcadia, through its public officials, has never approached the county with an offer to \njointly pave the unpaved portion of Hargrave Street. \n33. It is an \"unwritten\" policy of the City of Arcadia that dead-end streets are the lowest priority for \npaving. This defense was provided as an explanation for the following streets in the black community \nbeing unpaved: \n1) Singleton Avenue (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact No. 32-a, Pg. 4) \n2) Dade Avenue (Defendants' Exhibit No. 5) \n3) Madison Avenue (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact No. 26-b) \n4) Spring Avenue (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact No. 32-a, Pg. 5) \n5) Citrus Avenue (Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9, Fact No. 8-a) \nIn conjunction with the streets to which the City pleaded \"Undedicated — no responsibility\" these \nrepresent all the remaining black unpaved streets in Arcadia. [Source: (Facts 23-33) Testimony of \nDyal] \n34. This unwritten policy has an inherently discriminatory impact on black Arcadia. A far higher \npercentage of streets in the black community are dead-end than in the white community. In the black \ncommunity, thirteen of the forty-six streets and street segments, or 28.2%, listed in Plaintiffs' Exhibit \nNo. 9, were dead-end streets. In the white community, of the ninety-two streets and street segments \nlisted in Exhibit No. 9, only 9, or 9.7%, were dead-end. \n35. Furthermore, the City of Arcadia has arbitrarily and irregularly executed this policy. As a result a \ndiscriminatory policy on its face has been implemented in a discriminatory manner. \n\n36. Of the nine dead-end white streets, only three, Hodges (west of Johnson), Crawford and \nImmogene are unpaved.[4] This amounts to 33.3% of the white dead-end streets as unpaved. In the \nblack community, of the thirteen dead-end streets, seven, or 53.8% are unpaved. In addition, prior to \nthe March 1976 filing of the lawsuit, four additional black dead-end streets, or a total of 84.6%, were \nunpaved.[5] [Source: (Fact Nos. 34-36), City Map, Defendants' Exhibit No. 4] \n37. A comparison of those dead-end streets which were paved in the white community, versus those \ndead-end streets which were not paved in the black community, shows that a far higher \nconcentration of households existed on the black streets. Thus even within the scope of the City's \ndiscriminatory policy to pave dead-end streets last, the decisions of which streets to pave are not \nfiscally justifiable. In applying the standard engineering cost-efficiency analysis for street paving, the \nnumber of households per linear foot of City street, it is clear that the City has benefitted white \nstreets at the expense of black streets.

The City of Arcadia's policy of making dead-end streets the lowest priority for street paving \ndiscriminates against blacks in two ways: \n1) There is a far higher percentage of such streets in the black community. \n2) The implementation of the policy has been inequitable and discriminatory, serving to exacerbate a \nsystem which already burdens the black community unduly. \nA higher percentage of white dead-end streets have been paved than black dead-end streets. This \nhas happened despite the fact that on a cost-efficiency basis, the same amount of street paving \nwould benefit 1374*1374 many more households were it constructed on black dead-end streets. \n[Source: Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 9; Defendants' Exhibit No. 5 and Testimony of Dyal] \n39. The inconsistent, fiscally unsound execution of a discriminatory, though unwritten, policy \nreviewed above is representative of the City's street paving practices. The City of Arcadia has not \nformulated, or communicated to its administrator a uniform set of guidelines to use in decisions \nconcerning street paving. Thus all decisions of this nature are left up to the administrator's judgment. \nLacking a coherent system for analyzing needed street repairs, designed with the concern for \nequitable distribution of funds in mind, the Arcadia street paving scheme is inconsistent and \ndiscriminates against blacks. Streets are frequently re-sand sealed in the white community before \nold streets are initially sand sealed in the black community. For example, Luther, Fortune and N.E. \nOak Streets in the white community, 4,100 linear feet of street, were re-sand sealed at an \napproximate cost of $20,500. As additional examples of the discriminatory effect of Arcadia's lack of \nstreet paving guidelines, Johnson Street and Kelly Avenue are noteworthy. Johnson Street has three \nhouses spread over 1,300 feet of pavement and does not serve as a access route. Kelly Avenue has \none house on 2,500 feet of paved street, and does not serve as an access route. The City \nAdministrator testified he knew of no reason why these streets were paved. The approximate cost of \npaving these streets was (3,800 lin. ft. × $5) $19,000. [Source: Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 19, \nAdministrator's progress reports dated June 15, 1976] \n40. Quality in pavement surfacing is measured by the thickness of bituminous material, a mixture of \ntar and sand. \n41. Generally, streets in the black community have been paved with the City paving machine which \nis incapable of putting down a sufficiently thick surface. As a result, streets in the black community \nare of inferior quality and require more repair and maintenance. \n\n42. In contrast, most white streets are paved with the county's paving machine, which is capable of \nproducing a thicker, higher quality surface. As a result, these streets last considerably longer and \nrequire less maintenance than those in the black community. [Source: Testimony of Paller] \n2. PARK AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES \n43. The two primary standards used in evaluation of respective recreational facilities in the black and \nwhite communities are quality and access. Quality is concerned with the kind of facilities respectively \nin use and their maintenance. Access concerns the relative availability of recreational space and \nfacilities to the respective communities. \n44. In examining quality of recreational facilities in Arcadia, the logical comparison focuses on the \ntwo large multi-purpose recreational complexes in the City; Smith-Brown, which is black, and Speer, \nwhich is white. A review and comparison of these facilities follows. \n— Interiors — \n45. The Smith-Brown center is a converted gymnasium, high ceilinged with basketball courts and a \nstage. It is essentially one large room that can support few other activities when basketball is being \nplayed, which is most of the time. To the side of the basketball court is one pool table and the stage \nhas a ping-pong table. However, the primary function of the center during daytime recreational use, \nis basketball. \nThe Speer center is a much more modern building with many rooms to separate different \nrecreational functions. Its main room contains two ping-pong tables. Adjacent rooms contain: \n1) Two bumper pool and one pool table; \n2) A fully equipped tumbling area; \n3) An arts and crafts area; \n4) Fully equipped kitchen; \n5) A T.V. viewing room; and \n6) A meeting room. \n1375*1375 The difference in facilities is that Speer is able to support a multitude of recreational \nactivities simultaneously, while Smith-Brown is completely inadequate for such a task. In comparison \nto Speer, Smith-Brown is not in fact a recreation center, but a converted gymnasium. \n— Exteriors — \n46. The land surrounding Speer is excellently maintained, with the grasses kept mowed and the \ngrounds regularly kept clear of debris. The building itself, built of wood and brick, is very well \nmaintained. \nThe Smith-Brown building's exterior is dramatically different. The building itself is covered with \npeeling, flaking paint and a thick cover of dirt. The center is adjacent to four abandoned structures \nthat were once a school. They are filled with chipped plaster, exposed wires and assorted debris, \nespecially glass. This debris also covers the grounds adjacent to the buildings. The entire area is \nunsightly and hazardous and completely unsuitable for a recreational complex. These buildings are \n\ntechnically school board property, but the City has evidenced no serious efforts to either a) clean up \nthe area themselves; b) ask the school board to do so; or, c) condemn the buildings. \n— Ballfields — \n47. Speer Recreation Center has a fully equipped, well kept lighted little league softball field, with \ndugouts, bleachers, backstop, fencing and a building housing concessions and restrooms. \nThe Smith-Brown field, still in the process of renovation, consists presently of a unfinished field, \nbackstop, fencing and dugouts. There are as yet no lights, equipment storage or bathrooms. The \nfield is not graded, or shaped and lacks bases. \n— Courts — \n48. The Speer Center has adjacent to it four recently completed fenced tennis courts, of composition \ncement surfacing. The Smith-Brown Center has two tennis courts made of less expensive concrete, \nand two adjacent basketball courts. The courts at Smith-Brown, on Hargrave Street, are not afforded \nthe proximity to restrooms that the courts at Speer enjoy. \n— Play Equipment — \n49. Speer Recreation Center has a fully-equipped, fenced \"tot lot\" with many varieties of play \nstructures for children and shaded sitting areas with picnic tables for adults. The black community \nhas absolutely no facilities for younger children, at Smith-Brown or elsewhere. This is perhaps the \nmost needed recreational improvement in black Arcadia. \n— Access Problems — \n50. Speer Recreation Center has no access problems whatsoever, Smith-Brown however has a \nsevere one. Running between the center on Harris Road and the fields and courts on Hargrave is an \nopen drainage ditch. A path between the two areas leads across this ditch, which is a potential \nhealth hazard and has been the object of many complaints by the black community. Children \ncrossing the ditch must now step carefully on old tires which sink in the bottom of the ditch. After a \nrain, crossing is nearly impossible. Minimum health standards would indicate that some sort of \nsimple footbridge be built across it. \n51. The question of access to recreational areas and facilities in the black and white communities \nhinges on the availability of such areas to the highest percentage of the respective racial residential \ngroups. \n52. Given that the Smith-Brown and Speer Centers are both in the extreme south and north of the \nCity, respectively, the two parks neutralize each other in comparing access (availability) for black \nand whites. However, the white community has a total of 3.2 acres of land in seven mini-parks \ndistributed throughout their neighborhoods. These parks afford whites shaded, protected \nrecreational space where families may congregate. No such equivalent spaces exist in the black \ncommunity. [Source: (Facts 41-50) Testimony of Paller] \n\n1376*1376 53. The Office of Revenue Sharing (herein \"O.R.S.\") responded to plaintiffs' \nadministrative complaint of discrimination with an investigation of Arcadia's various municipal \nservices. Their investigative team found the City in non-compliance with the anti-discrimination \nclause of the Revenue Sharing Act due to: \n1) the vastly superior maintenance of the Speer Center area, grounds, etc., and; \n2) the superior condition of the Speer Center restrooms, and; \n3) the health hazard presented by the debris adjacent to Smith-Brown. \nThe City was directed by O.R.S. to: \n1) upgrade restrooms of Smith-Brown equally to those of Speer. \n2) request the DeSoto County School Board to either clean up Smith-Brown grounds or ask \npermission of the board to allow City to do it. \n3) adopt a plan to ensure equal maintenance of facilities in the future. \nThe report was issued March 16, 1977. [Source: Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1, Report of Office of Revenue \nSharing] \n3. WATER SYSTEM \n54. The existing disparity in the underground water system in Arcadia results from the differences in \nthe quality of the system. Specifically, this means the ability of the distribution system to deliver at \neach fire hydrant a flow of 500 gallons per minute at a residual pressure of 20 pounds per square \ninch. This quantity of flow can be provided through either a grid system (intersecting pipes) of 6-inch \ndiameter pipe or a single line 8 inches in diameter or larger. With the exception of four small areas, \nthe entire white community is served by a grid system of 6-inch pipe. The other four areas are \nadequately served by 8-inch diameter pipe or larger. \n55. With the exception of two blocks adjacent to Arcadia's commercial district, the black community \ndoes not contain a 6-inch diameter grid system. The 12-inch diameter pipe which passes through the \nblack community distributes water to the commercial area; the 8-inch diameter pipe distributes water \nto the white community. Except for one other short section of 8-inch pipe, the water system in the \nblack community consists of unlooped 6-inch, 4-inch, 2-inch and smaller diameter pipe; this design \nand layout will not provide adequate water pressure at fire hydrants. The one in the white community \nwill provide adequate water pressure. Thus, the entire black community suffers from an inferior water \nquality system. \n56. Engineering consultants representing both plaintiffs and the City have agreed on the necessary \nadditional pipe necessary to close the grid system in the black community and thereby increase \noverall water pressure. They consist of the following additions: (all water pipe recommended to be 6-\ninch diameter) \nStreet         Beginning     Ending    Lin. Ft. of Pipe \n \nHargrave       Spring        East           700' \n \nHarris         Dade          Orange         150' \n \nSpring[8]   Hargrave      Bay           2900' \n\nSource: (Facts 54-56): Testimony of John E. Foster, P.E., plaintiffs' expert witness specializing in \ncivil engineering; analysis of water and wastewater distribution systems. \nE. CONCLUSIONS OF FINDINGS OF FACT \n57. The services and facilities provided to the black residents of Arcadia with 1377*1377 respect to \nstreet paving, parks and recreation and water supply system are substantially inferior to the \nprovision of these facilities and services to white residents. \n58. These inequalities are the result of systematic racial discrimination against the black residents of \nthe town. \n59. These inequalities continued up to the date of the filing of this suit. \nII. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. JURISDICTION, CLASS STATUS AND PARTIES \n1. Jurisdiction of plaintiffs' claims with respect to the individually named defendants — the mayor and \ncouncilmen — acting in their official capacities, is conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 1331(a) and 1343(3) and \n(4). \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 et seq. affords plaintiffs the vehicle to redress violations of constitutional rights, in \nthis case a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, where such \nrights have been violated by public officials acting in their official capacity under \"color of \nlaw.\" Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1967); United Farmworkers of \nFlorida Housing Project, Inc. v. City of Delray Beach, Florida, 493 F.2d 799 (5th Cir. \n1974) and McGill v. Parsons, 532 F.2d 484, n. 1 (5th Cir. 1976). \n2. § 1983 et seq., while providing a substantive right of action, is not a jurisdictional statute. Hagans \nv. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 535, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974). The \"jurisdictional counterpart\" \nfor § 1983 is § 1343(3) with jurisdiction recently enlarged to § 1343(4) in 1970, Lynch v. Household \nFinance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 543 n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972). § 1331 confers \njurisdiction without regard to the amount in controversy, since plaintiffs have alleged and proven an \nunconstitutional infringement (the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment) of their \nright to be free of racial discrimination at the hands of public officials of the City of Arcadia. \n3. The defendant City of Arcadia itself is not a \"person\" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and \nthus jurisdiction over the defendant City is not present pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3) and (4). City \nof Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973); Moor v. County of \nAlameda, 411 U.S. 693, 93 S.Ct. 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973); and Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, \n81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). \n4. This Court does, however, have jurisdiction over the defendant City of Arcadia under 28 U.S.C. § \n1331(a) City of Kenosha v. Bruno, supra; and Reeves v. City of Jackson, 532 F.2d 491 (5th Cir. \n1976) 28 U.S.C. § 1331(a) confers original federal district court jurisdiction \"of all civil actions \nwherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and \ncosts, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" \n\nIn the case sub judice, all black citizens share in their concern for improved municipal services. The \npaving of only a portion of an unpaved street fronting one specific black household will not solve that \nblack resident's concern with regard to living on an otherwise unpaved access route. Likewise, other \nCity services which are the subject matter of this suit — water lines and park and recreational \nfacilities — are commonly shared by homeowners living on a particular city block, street, or \nsubdivision. Because of the subject matter of this case, it is impossible to conceive of separate and \ndistinct claims for each black citizen in Arcadia. \n5. Jurisdiction of plaintiffs' claim against the individually named defendants for statutory violations \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) and 31 U.S.C. § 1242 State \nand Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, hereinafter \"Revenue Sharing Act\") is conferred by 28 \nU.S.C. § 1343(3) and (4). (Title VI) Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 \n(1974); Lemon v. Bossier Parish School Board, 240 F.Supp. 709 (W.D.La. 1965), aff'd 370 F.2d 847 \n(5th Cir. 1967) cert. 1378*1378 den., 388 U.S. 911, 87 S.Ct. 2116, 18 L.Ed.2d 1350 (1967); \n(Revenue Sharing) Robinson v. Simon and United States v. Chicago, 395 F.Supp. 329 \n(N.D.Ill.1975), 405 F.Supp. 480 (N.D.Ill.1975), 411 F.Supp. 218 (N.D.Ill. 1976), 416 F.Supp. 788 \n(N.D.Ill.1976), and 420 F.Supp. 733 (N.D.Ill.1976). \n6. Jurisdiction of plaintiffs' claims against the defendant City of Arcadia for statutory violations under \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Sharing Act is conferred by 28 U.S.C. § \n1331. City of Kenosha v. Bruno, supra; Reeves v. City of Jackson, 532 F.2d 491 (5th Cir. 1976); \nand Mathews v. Massell, 356 F.Supp. 291 (N.D.Ga.1973). \n7. Plaintiffs may properly maintain this action as a class action on behalf of all black persons who \nreside and will continue to reside in Arcadia, Florida. Rule 23(b)(2), Fed.R.Civ.P. The class which \nplaintiff represents is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; there are common \nquestions of law and fact applicable to the class; plaintiffs' claims are typical of the claims of the \nclass; plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Defendant has acted or \nrefused to act in a manner generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nB. MUNICIPAL SERVICE DISCRIMINATION \n8. The substantive standards imposed by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to compare municipal service provision between black and white residential \ncommunities are essentially established by Hawkins v. Town of Shaw, 303 F.Supp. 1162 (N.D. \nMiss.1969) rev'd 437 F.2d 1286 (5 Cir., 1971) aff'd en banc, 461 F.2d 1171 (5th Cir., 1972). \n9. Once a municipality elects to provide services, it must provide equal services to the minority \ncommunity or the City violates the Equal Protection Clause. \n10. Municipal inaction in response to discrimination in public institutions is violative of the Equal \nProtection Clause. \n11. The standard for service provisions in a municipal service equalization suit is the quality and \nquantity of services enjoyed by those citizens who are favored by discriminatory practices. \n12. The longer the period of time over which it can be established that there have been substantial \ndisparities in the level of municipal services, the greater the presumption that the disparity is a \nfunction of race. \n\n13. Citizens have a substantial interest in municipal services and when minority citizens show a \nstatistical pattern of unequal and oppressive distribution of services, a legitimate inference of de \nfacto racial discrimination can be drawn. \n14. Governmental policies and practices which appear neutral on their face but which have a \ndisparate effect on the minority community are discriminatory. \n15. A past history of de jure racial discrimination in the municipality with respect to schools, \nrecreational facilities and other public facilities is persuasive evidence that racial inequalities in the \ndistribution of municipal services is the result of racial discrimination. Keyes v. School District No. \n1, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). \n16. Disproportionate impact may be probative of intent to discriminate and in some cases sufficient \nto prove intent. Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). \n17. Disproportionate impact of an official action, the legislative or administrative record of the \ndecision are historical background of circumstantial evidence that show intent to discriminate. Village \nof Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 \nL.Ed.2d 450 (1977). \n18. Statistical proof coupled with historical showing of broad-based racial discrimination satisfied \nPlaintiffs' burden of 1379*1379 proving the intent requirement of Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, \n96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976); and Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing \nDevelopment, Corp., supra. \n19. To create a presumption of discriminatory purpose the plaintiff must demonstrate that a \ngovernment decision (a) made a racial classification on its face (b) was applied in a discriminatory \nmanner or (c) had a reasonably foreseeable discriminatory effect. Dayton Board of Education v. \nBrinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977); United States v. School District of \nOmaha, 541 F.2d 708 (8th Cir. 1976) (Omaha II) (en banc) (per curiam). \n20. To establish relief under 42 U.S.C. § 2000d et seq. (Title VI) in a municipal services disparity \ncase, it must be proven that a municipality is a recipient of federal financial assistance and that the \nmunicipality has used criteria or methods of administration or has selected sites for facilities that \nhave resulted in discrimination in a program or activity supported with federal financial \nassistance. Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 94 S.Ct. 786, 39 L.Ed.2d 1 (1974) and Griggs v. Duke \nPower Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). \n21. Financing discriminatory governmental activities with revenue sharing monies or other federal \nfunds is violative of the Revenue Sharing Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § \n2000d et seq. respectively. \n22. A municipality or political subdivision may not with respect to any program or activity make \nselections or locate facilities in places which deny minority individuals the benefits of such facilities \nand may not use revenue sharing funds to perpetuate the results of past discriminatory practices. \nRevenue Sharing Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1242. \n23. The three essential elements in order for plaintiffs to prove a constitutional violation in municipal \nservice suits, which they have done in this case, are: (1) existence of racially identifiable \nneighborhoods in the municipality; (2) substantial inferiority in the quality or quantity of the municipal \nservices and facilities provided in the black neighborhood; and, (3) proof of intent or motive. \n\nC. RELIEF \n24. Having found that defendants' practices violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights, it is proper for this \nCourt to take remedial action. The well-settled principle that the nature and scope of the remedy is to \nbe determined by the violation means simply that federal court decrees must directly address and \nrelate to the constitutional violation itself. Milliken v. Bradley, (Milliken II) 433 U.S. 267, 97 S.Ct. \n2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745, 757 (1977) and Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 \nU.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). \n25. In this case, a constitutional violation has been found. The remedy which this Court has \napproved in the Final Judgment does not exceed the violation since the remedy is tailored to cure \nthe \"condition that offends the Constitution.\" Milliken v. Bradley (Milliken I), 418 U.S.C. 717, 738, 94 \nS.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974) and Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 U.S. 284, 96 S.Ct. 1538, 47 L.Ed.2d \n792 (1976). \nIn the case sub judice, as has been shown, the \"condition that offends the Constitution\" is \nintentional, systematic across-the-board discrimination relating to certain municipally provided \nservices. A systematic remedy, as provided for in the Final Judgment, cannot \"exceed\" that violation. \n26. The Court commends counsel for the respective parties and the parties themselves. Counsel for \nplaintiffs has proceeded in this relatively novel action with energy, effectiveness, skill and \nprofessionalism. Counsel for defendants has, with complete fidelity to his clients, acted in a \ncompetent and professional way. \nThe citizens of Arcadia, black and white alike, have appreciated and accepted the realities of the law \nas they have been made apparent and give every indication of cooperating as fellow citizens of what \nis and can be an attractive community. \n1380*1380 By separate instrument the Court is concurrently entering final judgment. \nFINAL JUDGMENT \n1.

Nonetheless, this Court \ndeems it desirable to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law, since plaintiffs proceed in this litigation as a \ncertified class. See e. g., Girsh v. Jepsen, 521 F.2d 153 (3rd Cir. 1975); Byran v. Pitts Plate Glass Co., 494 F.2d 799 (3rd \nCir.), cert. den. 419 U.S. 900, 95 S.Ct. 184, 42 L.Ed.2d 146 (1974). \n[2] Defendants' motions included: 1) motion to dismiss, alleging: (a) plaintiffs had failed to state a claim against defendants \nupon which relief can be granted, (b) the Court lacked jurisdiction over defendants because the amount in controversy did \nnot exceed $10,000 for each member of the class, (c) the complaint as framed was vague and indefinite and therefore \ndefendants could not properly answer, (d) plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 1242 \nand 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; 2) motion to strike, challenging: (a) plaintiffs' claim for fees, (b) plaintiffs' right to immediate relief, (c) \nplaintiffs' claims under the Revenue Sharing Act; 3) motion for protective order — relating to plaintiffs' initiation of discovery, \nand 4) defendants' motion to tax costs. \n[3] See also: Lovey v.
