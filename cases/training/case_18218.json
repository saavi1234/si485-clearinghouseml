    "summary": "<p>This is a case challenging Franklin County&rsquo;s policy of strip-searching individuals charged with low-level misdemeanor offenses and photographing their tattoos. The plaintiff, a resident of Franklin County, was arrested for disorderly conduct in 2012 and transported to the Franklin County Correction Center II (&ldquo;Jackson Pike&rdquo; facility). She was required to strip in the presence of other detained people and a male correctional officer who then photographed tattoos near her genitals. She was released the next day on bail and the charges against her were later dismissed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She filed this class-action lawsuit on May 23, 2013, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, suing Franklin County under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought class certification, declaratory relief, an injunction ordering the county to delete the photos of her tattoos from their database, an injunction preventing the county from strip searching and photographing women charged with minor crimes, and costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees. She claimed that (1) the county&rsquo;s policy of strip-searching individuals before their arraignments and before an opportunity to post bail violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and (2) the county&rsquo;s policy of photographing all tattoos and retaining the photos in an electronic database even after dismissal of the charges was an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Gregory L. Frost and Magistrate Judge Mark R. Abel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 24, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion to proceed under a pseudonym, because her tattoos revealed her sexual orientation and she feared public ridicule would result from her exposure. Magistrate Judge Abel granted the motion, but the defendants then moved for reconsideration. On September 20, 2013, Judge Frost ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint under her real name, holding that she failed to show evidence she would suffer harassment and ridicule if her identity were revealed. 2013 WL 5311466. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint under her real name 10 days later.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In April 2014, the county changed its policy of photographing all tattoos of all detained people to photographing tattoos on the &ldquo;buttocks, genitals and female breasts&rdquo; only when the individual was charged with a felony.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff moved for class certification on August 7, 2014. She requested the court certify three classes: a strip search class, a photography subclass, and a cross-gender photography subclass. She defined the strip search class as:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;All female detainees who have been placed into the custody of the Franklin County Correctional Center Two (&ldquo;Jackson Pike&rdquo;), after being charged with misdemeanors, minor misdemeanors, violations of probation, traffic infractions, civil commitments, city code violations or other minor crimes, including failure to pay fines, and were strip searched upon their entry into the Jackson Pike facility prior to being arraigned before a judicial officer, pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of Franklin. The class period commences on May 23, 2011, and extends to the date on which Franklin County is enjoined from, or otherwise ceases, enforcing its policy, practice and custom of conducting blanket strip searches on all detainees admitted to the Jackson Pike facility.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Second, she defined the photography subclass as:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;All female detainees who have been placed into the custody of the Franklin County Correctional Center Two (&ldquo;Jackson Pike&rdquo;), after being charged with misdemeanors, minor misdemeanors, violations of probation, traffic infractions, civil commitments, city code violations or other minor crimes, including failure to pay fines, and had photographs taken of their breasts, hypogastric region, genitals, and/or buttocks upon their entry into the Jackson Pike facility prior to being arraigned before a judicial officer, pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of Franklin. Detainees who are members of the class had photographs taken of their genitals, their hypogastric region, the lobes of their buttocks and/or the lobes of their breasts at the Jackson Pike facility. The class period commences on May 23, 2011, and extends until April 30, 2014.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>And third, she defined the cross-gender photography subclass be as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;All members of the Photography Class who had photographs taken of their tattoos by a Franklin County Identification Technician of the opposite sex. Detainees who are members of the subclass are limited to individuals whose records in the Identiview system reflect that photographs of their tattoos were taken by an Identification Technician, designated the &ldquo;operator&rdquo; in the Identiview system, who was of the male gender. The subclass is also comprised of members of the photography class whose tattoos were photographed when only an Identification Technician of the male gender was working in their facility.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2014, the plaintiff moved to file a second amended complaint to include facts learned in depositions and to revise the proposed class definitions in light of those facts. Magistrate Judge Abel denied the motion on November 14, 2014, holding that the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion was not timely because she waited three months after taking the depositions to file the motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved for summary judgment on November 14, 2014. On December 9, 2014, Judge Frost denied both the defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment and the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion to certify the class. He denied the motion for class certification because the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion used the class definitions proposed in the second amended complaint that the court had rejected. The court ordered the plaintiff to file a new motion using the class definitions proposed in the first amended complaint and dismissed the defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment without prejudice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff filed a new motion for class certification on December 23, 2014. Judge Frost granted the motion in part and denied the motion in part on April 7, 2015. 306 F.R.D. 548. He certified the photography subclass, but he declined to certify the cross-gender photography subclass because the plaintiff had added it for the first time in her motion for class certification and failed to give the defendant fair notice. Judge Frost also declined to certify the strip-search class in light of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 2012 holding in <em>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington</em> that held it was constitutional for a correctional institution to strip-search individuals upon admitting them into the general jail population. 132 S. Ct. 1510. However, the <em>Florence</em> Court indicated it might be unconstitutional to admit someone into the general jail population if there was a reasonable alternative to doing so, such as holding them temporarily in a waiting area until they could post bail. Judge Frost therefore held that the strip-search class did not meet the commonality and typicality requirements for a class action, because an inquiry into the reasonableness of admitting a person into the general population would be fact-specific and vary as to each class member. He thus held that the plaintiff&rsquo;s strip-search claim could proceed individually.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After class certification, the plaintiff moved to unseal the records of about 74 potential class members. Judge Frost denied the motion on November 30, 2015, holding that publication in the Columbus Dispatch constituted reasonable notice of the lawsuit and that potential class members were free to unseal their records and join the litigation if they so desired. 2015 WL 7721187.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Frost retired in May 2016 and the case was reassigned to Judge Michael H. Watson and Magistrate Judge Terence P. Kemp.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 14, 2016, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment and the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. While these motions were pending, over the next few years, the parties engaged in discovery and settlement negotiations. Then, on March 20, 2018, Judge Watson denied both parties&rsquo; motions for summary judgment regarding the Fourth Amendment photography claim. 2018 WL 11357093. He granted the defendant&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment regarding the plaintiff&rsquo;s individual strip-search claim, holding that the plaintiff did not introduce substantial evidence that the defendant&rsquo;s policy of admitting all detainees to the general population was an exaggerated response to the problem of housing detainees. Finally, Judge Watson ordered supplemental discovery on the photography claim to determine whether the county analyzed the photographs of the tattoos for potential gang meanings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The defendant filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on August 30, 2018. The parties engaged in further discovery over the next year, and Judge Watson denied the defendant&rsquo;s motion on September 30, 2019. 2019 WL 13044813. He held that the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether the defendant exaggerated its response to the problem posed by gang-related tattoos, especially because the supplemental discovery revealed that the photographs of tattoos were not systematically reviewed for gang affiliations and that other facilities handled the same security threat in a much less intrusive fashion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties prepared for trial until February 24, 2021, when the issue was referred for mediation. On January 7, 2022, the plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of a class-action settlement. The agreement defined the class as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">&ldquo;All female detainees who have been placed into the custody of the Franklin County Correctional Center Two (&ldquo;Jackson Pike&rdquo;), after being charged with misdemeanors, minor misdemeanors, violations of probation, traffic infractions, civil commitments, city code violations or other minor crimes, including failure to pay fines, and had photographs taken of their breasts, hypogastric region, genitals, and/or buttocks upon their entry into the Jackson Pike facility prior to being arraigned before a judicial officer, pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of the County of Franklin. Detainees who are members of the class had photographs taken of their genitals, their hypogastric region, the lobes of their buttocks and/or the lobes of their breasts at the Jackson Pike facility. The class period commence[d] on May 23, 2011, and extend[ed] until April 30, 2014.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The agreement provided for a settlement fund of $2.5 million, with costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees to be distributed to class members within 21 days of the agreement&rsquo;s effective date. An independent third party would administer the fund, and any residual funds would not revert to the defendant but would be redistributed on a pro rata basis to the class members. The administrator would re-mail notices of the lawsuit and also take extra steps to locate class members, such as utilizing social media and calling telephone numbers associated with members&rsquo; booking records. Finally, the agreement provided for injunctive relief. First, the county would enact a policy forbidding the photography of tattoos in non-felony cases absent extraordinary circumstances and would train its employees to adhere to the new policy. Second, all photographs of the tattoos of class members would be sealed by court order. Finally, the county would destroy the photographs within five years of the settlement agreement&rsquo;s effective date.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Watson granted the order on February 8, 2022, and the court scheduled a fairness hearing scheduled for May 12, 2022. The case is ongoing.</p>",

For the past several years, Franklin County has required \nthat all individuals placed into the custody of the Franklin County Workhouse (the \nโWorkhouseโ) be subject to strip searches in groups upon admission, as well as have their \ntattoos photographed by Corrections Officers, oftentimes one of the opposite sex.  Upon \ninformation and belief, this practice is also applied to individuals admitted to the Franklin \nCounty Correctional Center.  Upon information and belief, these policies are, in part, \nderived from the written procedures of Franklin County, Ohio.   \nPlaintiff Kristen McDonald brings this action on behalf of herself, and on behalf \nof a proposed Class of thousands of other female detainees who were illegally strip \nsearched in groups, and, furthermore, who had photographs taken of their tattoos, many \n1 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 2 of 20  PAGEID #: 78\nof which were in private areas, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of her \ncivil rights and those of the Class Members she proposes to represent.  Plaintiff was \ncharged with a non-felony offense, and was strip searched before she was arraigned and \ngiven  an  opportunity  to  post  bail.    Additionally,  the  Plaintiff  has  several  tattoos  in \ncompromising positions on her body.  These tattoos were also photographed prior to the \nPlaintiffโs arraignment, and prior to her being given an opportunity to post bail.  These \nactions  were  taken  against  the  Plaintiff  in  violation  of  her  rights  under  the  Fourth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, and the right to privacy, which is protected \nby the Fourteenth Amendment and is also an independent right with other constitutional \nunderpinnings.  The manner in which these searches occurred, especially photographing \ntattoos on female arrestees, including tattoos on a femaleโs breasts or private areas, is also \nexcessive and unnecessary for issues of jail security.  A more humiliating and abusive set \nof procedures, enforced on individuals who oftentimes have been convicted of nothing \nand have not even been arraigned, is difficult to imagine.  The Plaintiff seeks monetary \ndamages  from  Defendant  for  herself  and  each  member  of  the  Proposed  Class,  a \ndeclaration that Defendantโs policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding \nDefendant from continuing to violate the rights of those placed into the custody of the \nFranklin County Workhouse and Franklin County Correctional Center.  With this as a \nbackground, Plaintiff complains as follows: \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 3 of 20  PAGEID #: 79\nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1341 & 1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of \nthe United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ยง \n2201, as it is filed to obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the \npolicies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffโs and Class claims occurred within this \njudicial district. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Kristen McDonald is a citizen of the United States and resides in \nFranklin County, Ohio.  In or around June 2012, Ms. McDonald was arrested and placed \nin the Franklin County Workhouse on non-felony charges of disorderly conduct, which is \nclassified as a minor misdemeanor under Ohio law.   \n4.  Defendant  Franklin  County,  Ohio  (โFranklin  Countyโ)  is  a  county \ngovernment organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio. At all times \nrelevant hereto, Franklin County was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Franklin County Workhouse \n(โthe  Workhouseโ)  and  the  Franklin  County  Correctional  Center  (the  โCorrectional \nCenterโ), and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of \nall  Workhouse  personnel.    In  addition,  at  all  relevant  times,  Franklin  County    was \n3 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 4 of 20  PAGEID #: 80\nresponsible for enforcing the rules of the Workhouse and the Correctional Center, and for \nensuring that personnel employed at the Workhouse and at the Correctional Center obey \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Ohio.  \n5.  The  Franklin  County  Workhouse  is  located  at  2460  Jackson  Pike, \nColumbus, Ohio.  The Franklin County Correctional Center is located at 370 South Front \nStreet, Columbus, Ohio.   \n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  pursuant  to  Rules  23(b)(1),  23(b)(2)  and \n23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a Class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were charged with or convicted of misdemeanors or \nminor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the Workhouse. \n7.  The Classes and Subclasses that Plaintiff seeks to represent is defined as \nfollows: \nPrimary Class \nAll female detainees who have been or will be placed into \nthe  custody  of  the  Franklin  County  Workhouse  and/or \nFranklin County Correctional Center, after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  violations,  violations  of \nprobation, traffic infractions, civil commitments or other \nminor crimes, including failure to pay fines, and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Workhouse and/or the \nCorrectional  Center,  pursuant  to  the  policy,  custom  and \npractice  of  the  County  of  Franklin.  The  class  period \ncommences on May 23, 2011, and extends to the date on \nwhich  Franklin  County  is  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise \nceases,  enforcing  its  policy,  practice  and  custom  of \nconducting blanket, group strip searches on all detainees \nadmitted to the Workhouse and/or the Correctional Center.  \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendant and any \n4 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 5 of 20  PAGEID #: 81\nand  all  of  its  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nPre-Arraignment Detainee Subclass \nAll  female  detainees  who  are  members  of  the  Primary \nClass and who were subjected to strip searches prior to \nbeing  arraigned  and/or  provided  with  a  reasonable \nopportunity to post bail.   \n \nPhotograph Subclass \n \nAll  female  detainees  who  are  members  of  the  Primary \nClass and who had photographs taken of their tattoos by \nCorrections Officers at that Franklin County Workhouse \nand/or the Franklin County Correctional Center.   \n \n8.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a Class \naction  under  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n9.  The  members  of  the  Class  are  so  numerous  as  to  render  joinder \nimpracticable.  Upon  information  and  belief,  there  are  hundreds  of  female  citizens \narrested for non-felony offenses who are placed into the custody of the Workhouse and \nCorrectional Center every month -- all of whom are members of the Proposed Class. \nUpon information and belief, the size of the Proposed Class totals at least thousands of \nindividuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n10.  Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of  all  of  these  individuals  is \nimpracticable because of the large number of Class Members and the fact that Class \nMembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently  residing  outside  of  Ohio  and  this  Judicial  District.  Furthermore,  upon \ninformation and belief, many members of the Class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n5 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 6 of 20  PAGEID #: 82\n11.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in \nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures violated by \nDefendantโs conduct of performing illegal strip searches and illegally photographing the \ntattoos of detainees. All members of the Class were charged with misdemeanors or \nsummary violations when placed into the custody of the Workhouse and the Correctional \nCenter, and all were illegally searched in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the \nright to privacy.   \n12.  Furthermore, common questions of law and fact also exist regarding the \nmanner in which detainees, including all members of the proposed class, were searched \nby Franklin County.  The Plaintiff maintains that the Defendant had a policy and practice \nof conducting blanket group strip searches of all detainees on their admission to the \nWorkhouse and the Correctional Center.  Many of these detainees were not yet arraigned \nbefore a judicial officer, and many also had their tattoos photographed by corrections \nofficers.  The Plaintiff will maintain, as a matter of law, that this conduct represents an \nunreasonable seizure under the Constitution, and should be enjoined by this Court.   \n13.  Plaintiffโs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class. \nPlaintiff and all members of the Class, and its respective subclasses, sustained damages \narising out of Defendantโs course of conduct. The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are \ntypical of the harms suffered by the members of Class. \n14.  The  representative  Plaintiff  has  the  requisite  personal  interest  in  the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiff has no interests that are adverse to the interests of the Members of the Class. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 7 of 20  PAGEID #: 83\n15.  Plaintiff  has  retained  counsel  with  substantial  experience  in  the \nprosecution of Class action and civil rights litigation, including successful litigation of \ncivil rights cases.  Plaintiffโs counsel has the resources, expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Franklin County.  Counsel for the Plaintiff \nknows of no conflicts among members of the Class or between counsel and members of \nthe Class. \n16.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the \nPlaintiff seeks Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Members of \nthe Proposed Class were subjected to the same policy requiring the blanket, group strip \nsearches of detainees at the Workhouse and Correctional Center, as well as photography \nof their tattoos.  In short, Workhouse and Correctional Center personnel acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all members of the Class. \n17.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2), and in the alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n18.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class. \nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate  question  of  whether  the  Defendantโs  written  and/or  de  facto  policy  of \nconducting uniform group strip searches on all individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes is a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the \nClass Period.  Common questions also exist regarding the conduct of these searches on \n7 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 8 of 20  PAGEID #: 84\ndetainees who have not been arraigned, and the excessiveness of photographing the \ntattoos of female detainees.    \n19.  A Class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members \nof the Class is impracticable given the large number of members of the Class and the fact \nthat they are dispersed over a large geographical area. Furthermore, the expense and \nburden  of  individual  litigation  would  make  it  difficult  or  impossible  for  individual \nmembers of the Class to redress the wrongs done to them. The cost to the federal court \nsystem of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous. Individualized \nlitigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system. \nBy contrast, the conduct of this action as a Class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n20.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address \nthe Defendantโs flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even \nthough upon information and belief the Defendant has maintained its illegal practices for \nseveral years. \n21.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4). \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 9 of 20  PAGEID #: 85\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n22.  The  Fourth  Amendment  of  the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits \nFranklin County officials, such as Workhouse and Correctional Center personnel in this \naction, from conducting strip searches of detainees at a local correctional facility in a \nmanner that does not respect a detaineeโs privacy rights in the unnecessary viewing of \ntheir naked bodies.  Allowing for detainees to be strip searched in groups, in the absence \nof  appropriate  individual  privacy,  is  a  violation  of  the  United  States  Constitution.  \nFurthermore,  requiring  female  detainees  to  have  all  of  their  tattoos  photographed, \nincluding photographs of tattoos in private areas, also violates the Fourth Amendment \nand is not reasonably related to jail security.    \n23.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution further prohibits \nthe blanket strip searches of detainees who have not been arraigned or been provided with \na  reasonable  opportunity  to  post  bail.    These  same  prohibitions  also  apply  to  the \nphotography of tattoos of female detainees who have not been arraigned or been provided \nwith a reasonable opportunity to post bail.           \n24.  Upon information and belief, Franklin County has instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducting blanket strip searches of all \ndetainees who enter the custody of the Workhouse and the Correctional Center, and \nconducting these searches in large groups in the absence of privacy partitions.  These \nsearches  are  conducted  regardless  of  the  condition  of  the  individual  or  reasonable \nsuspicion of whether the individual is harboring contraband.  For the vast majority of \ndetainees and class members, these strip searches are done prior to a detainee being \n9 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 10 of 20  PAGEID #: 86\narraigned before a judicial officer to contest the circumstances of their detention, or being \nprovided with a reasonable opportunity to post bail following arraignment.   \n25.  Upon information and belief, Franklin County has instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of photographing the tattoos of all detainees \nwho enter the custody of the Workhouse and the Correctional Center.  These photographs \nare taken regardless where a tattoo is on the body, or whether there is any basis to  \nbelieve  that  these  tattoos  have  any  relationship  to  jail  security  issues.    The  female \ndetainees and class members in this action undoubtedly have tattoos in a variety of \nprivate areas, including on their breasts, buttocks, inner thighs, mons pubis and pudendal \ncleft, all of which have been photographed and stored in the computer banks of the \nWorkhouse  and  Correctional  Center.    For  the  vast  majority  of  detainees  and  class \nmembers, their tattoos were photographed prior to being arraigned before a judicial \nofficer  to  contest  the  circumstances  of  their  detention,  or  being  provided  with  a \nreasonable opportunity to post bail following arraignment.      \n26.  The County knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement \nof a policy or practice of conducting blanket strip searches on Class Members without \nproviding  reasonable  privacy  measures,  and,  for  members  of  the  Pre-Arraignment \nDetainee  subclass,  in  the  absence  of  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  a  detainee  is \nharboring contraband.  The County also knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting the uniform photography of tattoos of \nmembers of the photography subclass in the absence of that practice having a reasonable \nrelationship to jail security issues.   \n10 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 11 of 20  PAGEID #: 87\n27.  Furthermore, the Countyโs policies, practices and customs, as addressed \nabove, are both offensive and absurd.  Forcing all female detainees to disrobe and be strip \nsearched  in  groups,  as  compared  to  allowing  detainees  to  disrobe  in  private,  is \nunnecessary and humiliating.  Forcing many of these same detainees to have their tattoos \nphotographed and stored in Franklin County computers is beyond cavil, and is grossly \nhumiliating,  abusive  and  unnecessary.    These  practices  are  particularly  offensive \nconsidering that many class members have not been arraigned and/or have not been given \nan opportunity to post bail on minor offenses.   \n28.  The Defendantโs written and/or de facto policies, practices and customs \nmandating the blanket, group strip searches of detainees and the photography of tattoos \nhas been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly \nestablished law. \n29.  Pursuant to these written and/or de facto policies, each member of the \nClass, including the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine, compulsory blanket \ngroup strip search upon their entry into the Workhouse and the Correctional Center. \nThese strip searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable \nsuspicion as to whether the Class Members harbored contraband, and in fact were not \nsupported by reasonable suspicion.  They also were unreasonable given more dignified \nalternatives, including allowing detainees to disrobe and be searched in private, being \ninspected only by one corrections officer versus being searched in a large group.  These \nstrip searches have been conducted on individuals arrested for, among other innocuous \noffenses, driving while intoxicated, driving with a suspended license, harassment and \ntrespassing. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 12 of 20  PAGEID #: 88\n30.  Relative to the photograph subclass, each member of this subclass was \nalso the victim of the routine, compulsory photographing of tattoos upon their entry into \nthe Workhouse and the Correctional Center.  This wholesale regime of photographing the \ntattoos  of  female  detainees  was  conducted  without  any  consideration  of  whether \nphotographing the tattoos in question had any reasonable relationship to jail security or \norder, or, more importantly, how the location of the tattoo related to those issues.   \n31.  As a direct and proximate result of the blanket, group strip searches and \ntattoo photographs conducted pursuant to these written and/or  de  facto policies, the \nvictims of the unlawful practices -- each member of the Class, including the named \nPlaintiff -- has suffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and \nmental anguish. \n \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Kristen McDonald \n32.  Plaintiff Kristen Mcdonald resides in Franklin County, Ohio. In or around \nJune 2012, Ms. McDonald was arrested on non-felony charges of disorderly conduct. \nSpecifically, Ms. McDonald was alleged to have been loud outside of a bar in the \ngateway area of Columbus. \n33.  The circumstances of Ms. McDonaldโs arrest were void of any reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that she was secreting a weapon or contraband in a private area. \n34.  At approximately 9:00 PM, Ms. McDonald was arrested for disorderly \nconduct and taken directly to the Franklin County Workhouse.  Upon information and \nbelief, Ms. McDonald was taken to the Workhouse because the Correctional Center was \novercrowded.  Approximately one hour later, Ms. McDonald was taken to a room and \n12 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 13 of 20  PAGEID #: 89\nsubjected to a strip search.  As part of her strip search, Ms. McDonald was required to \nremove several piercings while being viewed by Corrections Officers, including piercings \nin her breasts and stomach.  This strip search was conducted prior to Ms. McDonald \nbeing arraigned before a judicial officer, or being provided with a reasonable opportunity \nto post bail.   \n35.  Several hours after being strip searched, Ms. McDonald was then taken to \na room where a male and female corrections officer were stationed.  At this time, Ms. \nMcDonald was asked if she had any tattoos.  After responding in the affirmative, Ms. \nMcDonald was required to expose her tattoos to be photographed by the male and female \ncorrections officer.  Ms. McDonald had two tattoos on her mons pubis, including one \napproximately ยฝ inch from her clitoral hood, as well as several tattoos on other parts of \nher body.  None of these tattoos are related to gang activity, nor would anyone reasonably \nbelieve they are gang related; instead, they are a female symbol, a phrase in Italian, a \npoem, the words โbeautiful disaster,โ the words โliving to die, dying to live,โ a rainbow \nand a flower.  Ms. McDonald was subsequently forced to remove her clothes, including \nher pants and underwear, to allow complete strangers to photograph these tattoos.  When \nMs.  McDonald  objected,  she  was  told  that  this  photography  was  โroutineโ  and  the \nโprocedure.โ  Presumably, these highly personal photographs are currently stored in the \ndatabanks of Franklin County.  These photographs were taken prior to Ms. McDonald \nbeing arraigned before a judicial officer, or being provided with a reasonable opportunity \nto post bail.   \n36.  Ms.  McDonaldโs  father  posted  her  bail,  presumably  set  per  the  bail \nschedule, at 5:30 AM after she called him following the conclusion of the booking \n13 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 14 of 20  PAGEID #: 90\nprocedures detailed above.  She was eventually released at 7:30 PM.   Ms. McDonald had \nto appear in court on one occasion, after which her charges were dismissed.   \n37.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search, Plaintiff has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law -- \n-- Unreasonable Search and Seizure โ   \nStrip Searches \n \n38.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n39.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement officers, and prohibits \nofficers from conducting blanket strip searches, especially strip searches performed in \ngroups, on individuals who have not been arraigned or been provided with a reasonable \nopportunity to post bail.  The Fourth Amendment also requires corrections officials to \nconduct any such searches only when supported by reasonable suspicion to believe a \ndetainee has contraband secreted in a private area.    \n40.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution also protects \ncitizens  from  being  strip  searched  in  a  manner  that  is  abusive  and  intentionally \nhumiliating, including when those strip searches are conducted in the presence of other \ndetainees.   \n14 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 15 of 20  PAGEID #: 91\n41.  The actions of Defendant detailed above violated the Plaintiffโs rights \nunder the United States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for \nWorkhouse and Correctional Center personnel to engage in blanket strip searches of \ndetainees prior to their arraignment or prior to their being provided with a reasonable \nopportunity to post bail.  In short, it was completely unnecessary, as well as legally \nunjustifiable,  for  the  Defendant  to  require  its  corrections  officers  to  engage  in  the \nmandatory strip searches of detainees who were not provided with an opportunity to post \nbail, and where reasonable suspicion was not otherwise present.  It is difficult to imagine \na more humiliating and unnecessary procedure than conducting uniform strip searches on \nindividuals who will not enter the general jail population because they will be able to \naffect their immediate release on minor criminal charges.   \n42.  Additionally, the rights of the Plaintiff and members of the proposed class \nwere  also  violated  because  their  strip  searches  occurred  in  the  presence  of  other \ndetainees.   \n43.  This strip search regimen was conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Franklin County and its Department of Correction.  As such, Franklin County \nis directly liable for the damages of Plaintiff and members of the Class. \n44.  Defendant Franklin County is responsible for establishing the strip search \nprocedures utilized in the Workhouse and Correctional Center, and is further responsible \nfor the implementation of written policies at these facilities.   \n45.  This conduct on the part of Defendant represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, given that the actions of the Workhouse and Correctional Center personnel were \ntaken under color of state law. \n15 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 16 of 20  PAGEID #: 92\n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiff and the Members of the Strip Search Class have been irreparably injured. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law -- \n-- Unreasonable Seizure; Violation of the Right to Privacy โ \nPhotography of Tattoos \n \n47.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n48.  The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  seizures  by  law  enforcement  officers,  and  prohibits  correctional \nofficials from photographing the private parts and other hidden areas on a detainee in the \nabsence of a reasonable justification, and in an unreasonable manner.  Additionally, the \nright to privacy is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and is also an independent \nright with other constitutional underpinnings.  The right to privacy similarly constrains a \nstate official from photographing the private parts or other private areas on a citizen, and, \nimportantly, prohibits the continued retention of those photographs after a detaineeโs \ncriminal case has been resolved.    \n49.  The actions of Defendant detailed above violated and improperly invaded \nPlaintiffโs rights to privacy and to be free from unreasonable seizures. Simply put, it was \nnot  objectively  reasonable  for  Workhouse  and  Correctional  Center  personnel  to \nphotograph the tattoos of the Plaintiff and Members of the Class when those tattoos were \nclearly not gang related, and were located in the private areas of a womanโs body.  This is \nespecially true for detainees who were not provided with a reasonable opportunity to post \nbail or contest their detention during arraignment.   \n16 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 17 of 20  PAGEID #: 93\n50.  Defendant Franklin County is responsible for establishing the policies and \nprocedures to be utilized in the Workhouse and Correctional Center, and is responsible \nfor the implementation of the strip search policies questioned in this lawsuit. As such, \nFranklin County is responsible for the damages of the Plaintiff and Members of the Class. \n51.  This conduct on the part of the Defendant represents a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983, given that its actions were taken under color of state law. \n52.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiff and the members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \n \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n-- Demand for Declaratory Judgment โ \n   \n53.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n54.  The  policies,  customs  and  practices  of  the  Defendant  are  clearly \nunconstitutional and violate the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and \nalso violate the right to privacy. \n55.  Plaintiff  and  Members  of  the  Class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a \ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search and photography policies of the \nDefendant to be unconstitutional and violative of the right to privacy. \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n-- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction -- \n56.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n17 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 18 of 20  PAGEID #: 94\n57.  The  policies,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Defendant  are  clearly \nunconstitutional  and  violate  the  right  to  privacy  and  the  right  to  be  free  from \nunreasonable searches and seizures.  In short, both their strip search and photography \npolicies are unconstitutional \n58.  Demand for deletion of all photos taken of class membersโ tattoos.  \n59.  Upon information and belief, these policies, practices and customs are \ncurrently  in  place  at  the  Workhouse  and  the  Correctional  Center,  with  new  and/or \nprospective Members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been \ninflicted upon the Plaintiff. \n60.  The  continuing  pattern  of  strip  searching  and  photographing  female \ndetainees charged with minor crimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or \nprospective members of the Class, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n61.  Plaintiff  demands  that  Franklin  County  immediately  desist  from  strip \nsearching  and  photographing  female  detainees  charged  with  minor  crimes  who  are \nadmitted to the Workhouse and/or the Correctional Center, and seek both a preliminary \nand permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much.  The Plaintiff also seeks an \ninjunction ordering the deletion of all photographs of tattoos taken from the bodies of \nfemale detainees at the Workhouse and the Correctional Center.   \n \n \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n62.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 20 Filed: 09/30/13 Page: 19 of 20  PAGEID #: 95\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Kristen McDonald, on behalf of herself and on behalf of \nothers similarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the following \nrelief: \n1.  An order certifying this action as a Class Action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23. \n2.  A judgment against Defendant Franklin County on Plaintiffโs First and \nSecond Causes of Action detailed herein, awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiff \nand each Member of the Proposed Class in an amount to be determined by a jury and/or \nthe Court on both an individual and a Class-wide basis. \n3.  A declaratory judgment against the Defendant declaring the Defendantโs \npolicies, practices and customs to be unconstitutional, violative of the right to privacy and \notherwise improper. \n4.  A preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the Defendant from \ncontinuing to enforce its unconstitutional policies, customs and practices.   \n5.

Watson \nv. \nMagistrate Judge Vascura \nFranklin County, Ohio, \nDefendant. \nOPINION AND ORDER \nPlaintiff Kristen McDonald (\"Plaintiff'') moves, on behalf of herself and the \ncertified class, for partial1 summary judgment, a declaratory judgment, and a \npermanent injunction against Defendant Franklin County, Ohio (\"Defendant\"). \nECF No. 163.  Defendant, likewise, moves for summary judgment against \nPlaintiff on all of her individual and class claims.  ECF No. 162.  Defendant also \nmoves to strike or exclude the report and declaration of Plaintiff's expert, Arthur \nWallenstein.  ECF No. 172.  For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion for \npartial summary judgment is DENIED, Defendant's motion for summary judgment \nis GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and Defendant's motion to strike \nor exclude is DENIED AS MOOT. \n1 \nWhile Plaintiff does not explicitly state that her motion is only for summary judgment on \na portion of her claims, as will be discussed below, Plaintiff's arguments only relate to \nher Photography Class claims and not her individual strip search claim. \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 2 of 27  PAGEID #: 4397\nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nA brief discussion of the procedural background of this case is useful to \nframe the current motions for summary judgment.  Plaintiff filed her complaint on \nMay 23, 2013, and subsequently amended the complaint on September 30, \n2013.  As will be described in greater detail below, the Amended Complaint \nasserts that Defendant's procedures for admitting detainees to the Franklin \nCounty Corrections Center at Jackson Pike (\"Jackson Pike\"), which typically \nhouses female detainees, are unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  Plaintiff objects to the following two specific policies.  First, \nDefendant requires all detainees to disrobe to their underclothes, remove their \nbrassiere if it contains an underwire, and remove their piercings while being \nobserved by a corrections deputy.  Second, Defendant photographs all tattoos on \ndetainees, including tattoos on a detainee's private areas. \nPlaintiff sought certification of three classes: a \"strip search class,\" a \n\"photography subclass,\" and a \"cross-gender photography subclass.\"  The Court \ncertified the photography class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3}. \nPlaintiff is therefore permitted to seek both injunctive and monetary relief on \nbehalf of the photography class.  Order 20, ECF No. 92.  Plaintiff's proposed strip \nsearch class was not certified because it \"encompasse[d] members whose \nclaims invoke different questions of law and fact, and different claims and \ndefenses, from Plaintiffs claim.\"  /d. at 25.  Therefore, only Plaintiffs individual \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 2 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 3 of 27  PAGEID #: 4398\nstrip search claims remain.  Finally, Plaintiffs cross-gender photography \nsubclass would have consisted of those members of the photography subclass \nwho were photographed by corrections officials of the opposite gender.  Plaintiff \nhas raised arguments in her motion for summary judgment and opposition to \nDefendant's motion for summary judgment that relate to her purported cross \ngender photography subclass and claims.  The Court previously found, however, \nthat \"[n]othing in the operative complaint puts [Defendant] on notice that Plaintiff \nis challenging, on behalf of a class, [Defendant's] practice of allegedly permitting \na male ID Tech to photograph the private tattoos of female detainees.\"  Order 7. \nECF No. 92.  The Court denied Plaintiffs motion to certify a cross-gender \nphotography subclass; therefore, claims on behalf of this subclass are not a part \nof this litigation.  The Court will not address Plaintiffs arguments in support of this \nclaim. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe general facts of this case that are not in dispute were laid out in the \nCourt's order on class certification, ECF No. 92, and are repeated here as a \nstarting point. \nOn June 29, 2012, Plaintiff Kristen McDonald was arrested for disorderly \nconduct (a fourth-degree misdemeanor).  Plaintiff was transported to one of the \nCounty's two local correctional facilities, Jackson Pike.  Jackson Pike typically \nhouses female detainees, while the second facility (Corrections Center One) \nCase No. 2:15-<:v-2763  Page 3 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 4 of 27  PAGEID #: 4399\ntypically houses male detainees.  Both facilities receive individuals charged with \na range of violations, from serious felony offenses to minor misdemeanors and \ncity code violations. \nUpon admittance to Jackson Pike, Plaintiff was subject to the institution's \n\"change-out\" procedure, which required Plaintiff to strip to her underwear in front \nof a Franklin County Corrections Deputy.  The Deputy visually inspected Plaintiff \nto determine if she had contraband on her person.  Plaintiff was also required to \nremove her underwire brassiere and piercings from her breasts while being \nwatched by a corrections officer, at which point Plaintiff received a Jackson Pike \nuniform.  Plaintiff does not allege or assert that the Deputy or other County \npersonnel touched her at any point. 2 \nAfter Plaintiff underwent this visual inspection and change of clothing, she \nwas directed to the identification room by a County Identification Technician (\"ID \nTech\").  Plaintiff was asked whether she had any tattoos, and after she \nresponded that she did, including tattoos on her genitals, her tattoos were \nphotographed.  Plaintiff has testified that the photographer was a male, Michael \n2 \nPlaintiff refers to this process as a strip search while Defendant typically refers to it as \na \"change out\" and states that it \"is not actually a strip search, [but involved] only visual \nobservation in private in a manner that minimizes the intrusion of privacy ... .\"   Def. \nMot. Summ. J. 20, ECF No. 162.  The constitutionality of the search does not depend \non the terminology used, so this exercise in semantics is of little value.  As the Supreme \nCourt noted in Florence, the term \"strip search\" is \"imprecise\" and can cover a wide \nrange of activities from visual inspection from a distance to more intrusive or close \ninspections.  Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, 566 U.S. 318,325 (2012).  Given \nthe Supreme Court's use of the term, this opinion will at times refer to the procedure \nutilized by Defendant as a strip search. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 4 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 5 of 27  PAGEID #: 4400\nCunningham.  Plaintiff has also testified that the doorway to the identification \nroom was open when the photographs were taken.  Furthermore, the room is \nsubject to video monitoring.  The photos are stored on a computer where they \ncan be accessed by several individuals.  Plaintiff has not provided any evidence \nthat anyone has inappropriately accessed or used the photographs. \nAfter having her tattoos photographed, Plaintiff was transferred to a \nhousing unit in the general population of the Jackson Pike facility.  She was \nreleased on bail the next day.  Two days later, Plaintiff was arraigned in the \nCounty Municipal Court, the charges against her were dismissed, and her record \nwas sealed. \nThe remaining facts will be discussed as part of an analysis of the motions \nfor summary judgment. \nII. SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nA. Standard of Review \nThe standard governing summary judgment is set forth in Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 56( a), which provides: \"The court shall grant summary judgment \nif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and \nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The \nCourt must grant summary judgment if the opposing party fails to make a \nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that \nparty's case and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 5 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 6 of 27  PAGEID #: 4401\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 {1986); see also Van Gorder v. \nGrand Trunk W  R.R., Inc., 509 F.3d 265, 268 (6th Cir. 2007}. \nWhen reviewing a summary judgment motion, the Court must draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, who must set forth \nspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial, and the \nCourt must refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the \nevidence.  Pittman v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dep't of Children and Family Servs., 640 \nF.3d 716, 723 (6th Cir. 2011 ).  Summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about \na material fact is genuine, \"that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury \ncould return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986}; Barrett v. Whirlpool Corp., 556 F.3d 502, 511 (6th Cir. \n2009).  Thus, the central issue is '\"whether the evidence presents a sufficient \ndisagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that \none party must prevail as a matter of law.'\"  Pittman, 640 F.3d at 723 {quoting \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52). \nHere, with respect to the photography class claims, the parties have filed \ncross-motions for summary judgment.  Each party, as a movant for summary \njudgment, bears the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact \nexists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The fact that one \nparty fails to satisfy that burden on its own Rule 56 motion does not automatically \nindicate that the opposing party has satisfied the burden and should be granted \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 6 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 7 of 27  PAGEID #: 4402\nsummary judgment on the other motion.  In reviewing cross-motions for summary \njudgment, courts should \"evaluate each motion on its own merits and view all \nfacts and inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\"  Wiley \nv. United States, 20 F.3d 222, 224 (6th Cir. 1994).  ''The filing of cross-motions \nfor summary judgment does not necessarily mean that the parties consent to \nresolution of the case on the existing record or that the district court is free to \ntreat the case as if it was submitted for final resolution on a stipulated record.\" \nTaft Broad. Co. v.  United States, 929 F.2d 240,248 (6th Cir. 1991) (quoting John \nv. State of La. (Bd. of Trs. for State Colis. & Univs.), 757 F.2d 698, 705 (5th Cir. \n1985)).  The standard of review for cross-motions for summary judgment does \nnot differ from the standard applied when a motion is filed by one party to the \nlitigation.  Taft Broad., 929 F.2d at 248. \nB. Defendant is Sui Juris \nAs a preliminary matter, Defendant makes a brief argument that it is not sui \njuris, opining that it \"is no more a cognizable legal entity than the Franklin County \nSheriff's Office .. . or the building known as Franklin County Corrections Center \nII.\"  Def. Mot. Summ. J. 18-19, ECF No. 162.  As Plaintiff points out in its \nmemorandum in opposition, however, this Court has previously rejected this \nargument in the context of Monell claims against a county government.  Pl. \nMemo in Opp. 19, ECF No. 169 (citing Stack v. Karnes, 750 F. Supp. 2d 892, \n899 (S.D. Ohio 201 0)).  Judge Frost's detailed analysis in Karnes is sound and \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 7 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 8 of 27  PAGEID #: 4403\ndoes not bear repeating.  Plaintiff is permitted to bring her Monell claims against \nDefendant.  It appears Defendant concedes as much given that it did not include \na defense of this argument in its reply in support of its motion for summary \njudgment. \nC. Standard for Fourth Amendment Claims for Pretrial Detainees \nBoth the Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit have issued a number of \nopinions evaluating the Fourth Amendment rights of pretrial detainees.  While \n\"there is no mechanical way to determine whether intrusions on an inmate's \nprivacy are reasonable,\" Florence, 566 U.S. at 327 (citing Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 \nU.S. 520, 559 {1979)), prior decisions have provided both general guidance for \nhow to evaluate such claims as well as a number of examples providing points of \ncomparison when evaluating corrections policies. \nAs an initial matter, convicted prisoners, or pretrial detainees as in this \ncase, \"do not forfeit all constitutional protections by reasons of their conviction \nand confinement in prison.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 545.  These rights include \"the \nFourth Amendment's guarantee of 'reasonable expectations of privacy.\"' \nWilliams v. City of Cleveland, 771  F.3d 945, 950 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting \nStoudemire v. Mich. Dep't of Corr., 705 F.3d 560, 572 (6th Cir. 2013)).  However, \nthat \"does not mean that these rights are not subject to restrictions and \nlimitations.\"  Bell, 441 U.S. at 545.  \"[M]aintaining institutional security and \npreserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may require \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 8 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 9 of 27  PAGEID #: 4404\nlimitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of ... pretrial \ndetainees.\"  Bell, 441  U.S. at 546. \nBecause \"the problems that arise in the day-to-day operation of a \ncorrections facility are not susceptible of easy solutions,\" officials \"should be \naccorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and \npractices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and \ndiscipline and to maintain institutional security.\"  /d. at 547.  \"[IJn the absence of \nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated \ntheir response to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to their \nexpert judgment in such matters.\"  /d. at 548. \nTherefore, even when a correctional facility policy infringes on a \nconstitutional guarantee, \"the practice must be evaluated in the light of the \ncentral objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.\"  /d. \nat 547.  In other words, \"The need for a particular search must be balanced \nagainst the resulting invasion of personal rights.\"  Florence, 566 U.S. at 327 \n(citing Bell generally}.  In order to conduct this balancing test, the Court \"must \nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" \nBell, 441 U.S. at 559. \n\"Florence does not stand for the proposition that every search conducted \npursuant to a jail's uniformly applicable search policy is impregnable from attack \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 9 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 10 of 27  PAGEID #: 4405\non that basis alone.\"  Williams, 771  F.3d at 951.  Strip searches are \"a \nparticularly extreme invasion\" of Fourth Amendment rights, and they \"may be \nunreasonable by virtue of the way in which [they are] conducted.\"  ld. at 951-52. \n\"Any given search or seizure of a detainee may not arbitrarily or needlessly \nencroach upon the detainee's privacy rights but must instead be 'reasonably \nrelated to legitimate penological interests.\"'  Williams, 771 F .3d at 950 {quoting \nStoudemire, 705 F.3d at 572).  In Williams, for example, the jail's method of \nsearching prisoners ( arrestees were fully disrobed in front of a correctional officer \nand sprayed on their naked body, including their exposed genitals, with a \ndelousing solution from a pressurized metal canister) was such a \"significant \nincursion into plaintiffs' privacy rights\" that the Sixth Circuit found \"the jail's need \nto perform the searches in [that] particular manner must be unusually dire before \nit can outbalance the affront to plaintiffs' privacy.\"  /d. at 954. \nIf there is no \"readily available alternative\" to the correctional facility's \npractice, it is likely that the policy is \"reasonably related to its legitimate \npenological interests.\"  /d. at 950.  However, an easy alternative to the policy \n\"that fully accommodate[s] the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid \npenological interests\" suggests the facility's choice to implement that policy does \nnot outweigh the constitutional burden imposed on its detainees.  /d. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 10 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 11 of 27  PAGEID #: 4406\nD. Plaintiff's Individual Strip Search Claim \nThe Supreme Court recently had the opportunity to review the \nconstitutionality of a strip search policy that was applied to pretrial detainees in \nFlorence.  This Court previously summarized Florence as follows when ruling on \nPlaintiff's motion to certify class claims: \nIn  Florence,  the plaintiff was  arrested  for non-felony offense.  The \nplaintiff was taken to two different correctional facilities,  where he \nwas  required  to  remove  his  clothing  while  officers  looked  for \ncontraband.  \"This policy applied regardless of the circumstances of \nthe  arrest,  the  suspected  offense,  or  the  detainee's  behavior, \ndemeanor, or criminal history.\"  After each search, the plaintiff was \nadmitted to the facility's general population.  The day after arriving at \nthe second facility, the plaintiff was released and the charges against \nhim were  dismissed. \nThe  plaintiff sued  on  behalf of a class of individuals charged with \nnonindictable offenses  who were directed to strip, prior to entering \nthe  facility's  general  population,  without suspicion  that they were \nconcealing contraband. \nThe  Supreme  Court  found  the  strip-search  policy  constitutional. \nAfter acknowledging that \"(p]ersons arrested for minor offenses may \nbe  among  the  detainees  processed  at these  facilities,\" the Court \nstated: \"The admission of inmates creates numerous risks for facility \nstaff,  for the existing detainee population, and for a new detainee \nhimself or herself. .. This puts the entire facility, including detainees \nbeing held for a brief term for a minor offense,  at risk.\"  The Court \nwent on to hold that strip searches of detainees arrested for minor \noffenses  who--like  Plaintiff  in  this  case-were  admitted  into  the \nfacility's general population, even without reasonable suspicion that \nthe  individual  being  searched  was  carrying  contraband,  were \nconstitutional as a matter of law. \nFlorence appears to dispose of Plaintiff's claim,  but for one issue. \nThe  Florence  Court  left  open,  although  it  did  not  define,  the \npossibility  of a  limited  exception  to  its  holding.  In  a  concurring \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 11 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 12 of 27  PAGEID #: 4407\nopinion, Justice Alito (whose vote was needed to achieve the 5-4 \nmajority), stated: \nMost  of  those  arrested  for  minor  offenses  are  not \ndangerous,  and most are  released  from  custody prior \nto  or at  the  time  of their initial  appearance  before  a \nmagistrate.  In  some  cases,  the  charges  are  dropped. \nIn  others,  arrestees  are  released  either on  their own \nrecognizance or on  minimal  bail.  For these persons, \nadmission  to the general jail  population, with the \nconcomitant  humiliation  of  a  strip  search,  may \nnot  be  reasonable,  particularly  if  an  alternative \nprocedure is feasible. \n(Aiito,  J.,  concurring).  Justice  Kennedy's  majority  opinion \nacknowledged the potential exception: \nThis  case  does  not  require  the  Court to  rule  on  the \ntypes  of  searches  that  would  be  reasonable  in \ninstances where,  for example,  a detainee will  be  held \nwithout assignment to  the  general jail  population  and \nwithout  substantial  contact  with  other detainees .... \nThe  circumstances  before  the  Court  .  .  .  do  not \npresent the opportunity to consider a narrow exception \nof the sort Justice AUTO describes  . . .  which  might \nrestrict  whether  an  arrestee  whose  detention  has \nnot  yet  been  reviewed  by a  magistrate  or other \njudicial  officer,  and  who can  be  held  in  available \nfacilities removed from the general population, may \nbe subjected to the types of search at issue here. \nFlorence,  therefore,  substantially  impacts  the  scope  of Plaintiff's \nclaim.  The  focus  of  Plaintiff's  claim  is  not whether the  County's \npolicy of strip searching misdemeanants is  constitutional; the focus \nis whether the County's policy of admitting misdemeanant detainees \ninto  the  general  jail  population  is  constitutional.  Relevant  facts \ninclude  the  reasons  the  County  admits  misdemeanants  into  its \ngeneral  population,  and  whether  \"an  alternative  procedure  is \nfeasible.\"  (Aiito, J., concurring). \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 12 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 13 of 27  PAGEID #: 4408\nViewed  under  this  lens,  Plaintiffs  strip  search  claim  can  be \nsummarized  as  follows:  the  County's  policy  of  admitting  pre \narraignment misdemeanants into Jackson Pike's general  population \n(with the concomitant humiliation of a strip search) is unreasonable \nbecause an  alternative procedure-holding such  detainees  in  the \nfacility's \"booking area\" until their arraignments-is feasible. \nOp. & Order 21-23, ECF No. 92 (internal citations omitted and emphasis added). \nAfter having the issue framed by the Court in its prior order, Plaintiff has \nfailed to identify sufficient facts with citation to the record in her moving papers to \ndemonstrate the feasibility of an alternative procedure for admitting pre-\narraignment misdemeanants.  Therefore, summary judgment against Plaintiff on \nher strip search claim is appropriate. 3 \nDefendant has pointed to the following record evidence regarding the \nnecessity of admitting all detainees to the general population and the availability \nof feasible alternatives.  There is no intake center at Jackson Pike.  Stobart Dep. \n10 1 , ECF No. 39.  Approximately 35,000 detainees are brought into the custody \nof the Franklin County Sheriff's Department each year, which could include either \n3 \nThe citation to facts actually in the record is critical.  As an example of where Plaintiff \nhas failed to meet this standard, in her opposition to Defendant's motion for summary \njudgment, Plaintiff \"respectfully suggest[s] that the Court can take judicial notice of the \nfact that [identifying information necessary to post bail] can be immediately inputted into \na computer upon a misdemeanor detainee entering the custody of the Jackson Pike \nfacility, and the detainee can wait a few minutes in a holding cell until they can post bail \nand be released.\"  Pl. Memo in Opp. 1, ECF No. 169.  This assertion does not involve a \nfact \"generally known\" in this jurisdiction or \"accurately and readily determined from \nsources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\" as required by Fed. R. Evid. \n201 (b).  The Court, therefore, cannot take judicial notice of this assertion that goes right \nto the heart of Plaintiff's strip search claim.  While Plaintiff did introduce some evidence \nrelated to this topic, she cannot rely on sweeping statements or requests for judicial \nnotice as an alternative to citing to evidence in the record to prove her claim. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 13 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 14 of 27  PAGEID #: 4409\nJackson Pike or Corrections Center One.  ld. at 46.  At Jackson Pike, there are \neleven holding cells, and they are used on an almost oontinual basis.  Stobart \nAff.1J16, ECF No. 162-2.  The holding cells at Jackson Pike only contain \nbenches, not beds.  Metz Dep. 72, ECF No. 42.  Defendant uses the holding \ncells for a variety of purposes, including housing mentally ill inmates on safety \nwatch, intoxicated inmates, and inmates awaiting transfer to other facilities.  Def. \nMot. for Summ. J. 10, ECF No. 162.  \"[S]afety watches can last several days and \nmultiple inmates can be on a safety watch simultaneously, with each inmate in \ntheir own individual holding cell.\"  Stobart Aft. 1J9, ECF No. 162-2.

The Jackson Pike facility would typically intake \napproximately fifteen women per night shift (11 :00 p.m. to 7:00a.m.).  Metz Dep. \n65, ECF No. 42.  On a Friday night, that number might be in the thirties.5  /d.  The \ncommunal cells at Jackson Pike could hold approximately ninety people at one \ntime comfortably.  /d. at 72.  Plaintiff's expert, Arthur Wallenstein, opined that \n\"[t]here is no reason that newly arrived female arrestees cannot be held safely \nand efficiently in an area separate from those fully arraigned and ordered \nincarcerated in the general population, especially given that the booking area at \nJackson Pike has two large holding cells that can house 80 detainees.\" \n6 \nWallenstein Rep. 9-10, ECF No. 174-1.\n4 \nThis rule was subsequently amended.  The current rule prohibits inmates from being \n\"confined in the reception area for more than twelve hours except when security, health \nand mental health concerns are being addressed.\"  OAC ยง 5120:1-8-01(A)(9). \n5 This is one example of where the factual record was underdeveloped.  Plaintiff could \nhave elicited testimony or cited documents to show how many detainees were \nprocessed in Jackson Pike on the same night as her to better illustrate how easy it \nwould have been to house her separately prior to her posting bond, but this evidence \nwas not cited to in the record. \n6 \nDefendant moved to strike or exclude the report and declaration of Mr. Wallenstein. \nECF No. 172.  The Court need not consider this motion on its merits.  With respect to \nCase No. 2: 15-cv-2763  Page 15 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 16 of 27  PAGEID #: 4411\nSomeone can go into the Clerk's office and pay bail twenty-four hours a \nday.  Pendy Dep. 20, ECF No. 159.  In order for someone to be permitted to post \nbail, though, the Clerk's office must have received a prisoner number, the name \nof the detainee, her address, the charges, case number, and a future court date. \n/d. at 21.  This information is gathered as part of the \"slating\" process, which is \ncontrolled by the Sheriff's Department. 7  /d. at 63.  The decision on when to slate \na detainee during the booking process (i.e., initially upon arrival at the jail or as \npart of the process of admitting a detainee into the general population) is also in \nthe control of the Sheriff's Department.  /d.  Most of the information the Clerk's \noffice needs to bail out a detainee is in a form filled out by the arresting officer. \n/d. at 59.  The only additional information that is needed is a slate number from \nthe Sheriff's Department and a court date which is provided by the Clerk's office. \n/d. at 58-60.  Once the Clerk's office receives that information, bail can be set \nwithin a matter of minutes.  /d. at 60. \nPlaintiff was charged with a fourth degree misdemeanor, meaning she \ncould have bailed herself out for as little as $79.  /d. at 17.  Plaintiff had her \nPlaintiffs strip search claim, the Court grants summary judgment for Defendant despite \nMr. Wallenstein's opinion.  The Court did not consider any of Mr. Wallenstein's opinions \nin its analysis of the photography class claim.  Therefore, Defendant's motion to strike \nor exclude, ECF No. 172, is DENIED as MOOT.  The Court will address the issues \nraised by Mr. Wallenstein's report in an upcoming status conference as discussed \nbelow. \n7 Slating simply means entering a detainee into the jail's computer system.  Stobart \nDep. 69, ECF No. 39. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 16 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 17 of 27  PAGEID #: 4412\ndriver's license and credit cards sufficient to post bail of at least $200 on the night \nshe was arrested.  McDonald Aff. 1, ECF No. 169-4. \nThe evidence cited by Plaintiff raises questions of fact regarding how long \nit takes for a detainee brought into Jackson Pike to obtain bail.  It also \ndemonstrates that there are holding cells that are large enough, generally \nspeaking, to fit the number of detainees who are brought in during a typical shift. \nHowever, Plaintiff has not presented any evidence to refute the substantial \nevidence presented by Defendant that the holding cells at Jackson Pike are \nneeded for purposes other than just housing detainees who are attempting to \npost bail.  Plaintiff has not proffered any evidence suggesting that, for instance, \nmentally ill inmates or those who are awaiting transfer to another facility could be \nhoused somewhere else within Jackson Pike.  Plaintiff has also not pointed to \nany evidence demonstrating that the holding cells were available for use to \nhouse arrestees awaiting bail on the specific night she was arrested. \nPlaintiff has raised arguments that appeal to the Court's sense of justice \nand raise concerns as to the propriety, and perhaps constitutionality, of \nDefendant's blanket policy of admitting all arrestees into the general population \nof Jackson Pike.  The Court is particularly concerned that it appears Defendant \nnever gives arrestees an opportunity to post bail prior to admitting them to the \ngeneral population, even if the holding cells are empty.  However, without being \npresented with facts that allow the Court to address these concerns, it will not \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 17 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 18 of 27  PAGEID #: 4413\noverride in this lawsuit the \"wide-ranging deference\" Defendant is entitled to in \nadopting policies and practices that it believes \"are needed to preserve internal \norder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\"  Be//, 441 U.S. at 547. \nPlaintiff was obligated to introduce \"substantial evidence\" that Defendant's policy \nof admitting all detainees to the general population was an exaggerated \nresponse to the problem of housing detainees, including those who have not yet \nposted bail, those on suicide watch, those awaiting transfer, etc., id. at 548, and \nshe has not met that obligation. \nBecause Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that Defendant's solution was an \nexaggerated response, Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that her Fourth Amendment \nrights were violated.  This is particularly so given that Defendant chose to utilize \na less invasive search on Plaintiff than some corrections facilities use (i.e., not \nforcing Plaintiff to remove her underwear and only requiring her to remove her \nbrassiere because the underwire is considered contraband).  Compare \nDefendant's policies with the policies in Florence, 566 U.S. at 323 (arrestees \nrequired to fully disrobe, shower with a delousing agent, and undergo inspection \nby officer that included arrestee lifting his genitals), and Williams, 771  F.3d at 948 \n(arrestees were fully disrobed in front of a correctional officer and sprayed on \ntheir naked body, including their exposed genitals, with a delousing solution from \na pressurized metal canister). \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 18 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 19 of 27  PAGEID #: 4414\nTherefore, with respect to Plaintiff's individual strip search claim, \nDefendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.8  To be clear, however, \nthe Court is not making a blanket ruling that Defendant's policy of admitting every \narrestee into the general population of Jackson Pike is constitutional in every \ncase.  Instead, the Court only finds that Plaintiff failed to present sufficient facts \nto survive summary judgment on her individual claim. \nE. Photography Class Claims \nBecause Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that Defendant's policy of admitting \nall arrestees into the general population of Jackson Pike was unreasonable, the \nCourt must determine if Defendant's photographing of tattoos in the private areas \nof detainees is nevertheless unconstitutional. \nFollowing Bell v. Wolfish, the Court begins by analyzing the scope of the \nparticular intrusion.  /d. at 559.  As discussed above, the Sixth Circuit has found \nthat strip searches are a particularly extreme invasion of Fourth Amendment \nrights, Williams, 771  F.3d at 951, even without photographing the private areas of \nthe detainee.  In the Court's view, the scope of the intrusion is magnified over a \n8 Defendant also argues that Plaintiff asserts an independent claim under the \nFourteenth Amendment's right to privacy, which fails as a matter of law.  Def. Mot. \nSumm. J. 33-34, ECF No. 162.  Upon review of the Amended Complaint, the Court \ndoes not agree that Plaintiff has asserted any separate claim based upon the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Rather, Plaintiff asserted that \"the right to privacy is protected \nby the Fourteenth Amendment and is also an independent right with other constitutional \nunderpinnings.\" Am. Campi.~ 48, ECF No. 20.  Plaintiff did not assert a separate \ncause of action based on the Fourteenth Amendment and did not address such a claim \nin her moving papers. Therefore, no separate claim based on the Fourteenth \nAmendment needs to be dismissed, and the Court considers the cross motions for \nsummary judgment as briefed. \nCase No. 2: 15-cv-2763  Page 19 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 20 of 27  PAGEID #: 4415\nnormal strip search by the taking of a photograph.  A photograph is a permanent \n(at least until deleted) record of the indignity suffered by the detainee.  A \ndetainee could fairly wonder what became of the photograph, who has viewed it, \nand whether any inappropriate use was ever made of the photograph.  It is not \nrelevant whether such a subsequent use, appropriate or inappropriate, is ever \nmade of the photograph.  The simple fact that the record was made results in an \nincreased intrusion. \nThe Court next addresses the place and manner in which the photographs \nwere taken.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  Defendant processes one inmate through the \nID bureau at a time.  Def. Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 167; Plaintiff's \nDep. 89, ECF No. 38.  Photographs of tattoos are taken in a small room.  The \nparties dispute whether the door to that room is always closed when inmates \nhave to remove their clothes.  The parties also dispute whether the individual \nwho photographs the tattoos is always the same gender as the inmate. \nThe Court must next consider the justification for initiating the search.  Bell, \n441  U.S. at 559.  Defendant contends that detainee tattoos, including those on \nprivate areas, \"are photographed for identification purposes and for safety and \nsecurity reasons.\"  Def. Resp. 4, ECF No. 167.  Defendant's expert, Captain \nSean Stewart, summarized the reasons given by Franklin County officials in his \nexpert report as follows: \n\"It  was  two  fold.  It  was  for gang  affiliation,  and  for identification \npurposes.\" (Beth Owens Deposition Page 741ines 17 and 18). \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 20 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 21 of 27  PAGEID #: 4416\n\"We had a - The reason  it started was we didn't take pictures of \ntattoos  at all  before,  and  there  was  a  serial  killer  in  Columbus \npreviously who had been abducting prostitutes and dropping them \noff.  And in those cases, their tattoos were the only way that they \nwere able to identify a lot of them\". (Michael Cunningham Deposition \nPage 19 lines 1 thru 7). \n\"For identification purposes\"- \"I was told - Like you said, there was a \nserial killer killing apparently prostitutes, and they were brought in to \nidentify  the  body.  So  they  put  in  for  the  fact  for  identification \npurposes, to go ahead and start photographing all the detainees\". \n(Claudia Barajas Deposition  Page 46 line21  and Page 47 lines 6 \nthru 11 ). \n\"Again,  it's for the identification  purpose of identifying  people. We \nuse scars, marks, and tattoos as identifying marks when identifying \npeople\".  - \"Again,  because  we  use that as  an  investigative tool. \nTattoos are often used in identifying people on the street.  They are \noften used in identifying people who have been murdered.  They are \noften  used  in  identifying  people  who  have  been  in  serious  car \naccidents and are disfigured beyond recognition, burned.  There's all \nkinds of reasons to have scars, marks, and tattoos clearly identified \non people\". (Geoffrey Stobart Deposition Page 171 lines 21  thru 24 \nand Page 172 lines 6 thru 16). \nStewart Report 19, ECF No. 162-3. \nAs summarized by Defendant's expert, Michael Cunningham and Claudia \nBarajas, two ID Techs who took the photos at issue, testified that the purpose of \nphotographing the tattoos was identification of victims in the future and did not \nmention gang affiliation or security as a justification for the photographs. \nBeth Owens, the Manager of the Identification Unit for the Franklin County \nSheriff's Office, testified that the photographs could be used for both gang \naffiliation or identification purposes.  The first time she was asked in her \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 21 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 22 of 27  PAGEID #: 4417\ndeposition why tattoos on or near genitals would need to be photographed, Ms. \nOwens said \"There are times when investigative officers - - investigators are \nlooking for certain tattoos in certain places for victims.\"  Owens Dep. 4 7, ECF No. \n40.  Later, after she added gang affiliation as a reason for photographing tattoos, \nMs. Owens was asked why a photograph would need to be taken of a tattoo that \nwas clearly not gang related, like \"a butterfly someone has on their buttocks.\"  /d. \nat 79.  Ms. Owens responded that it would not be for identifying gang activity, \"it \nwould be for identification purposes.\"  Owens Dep. 79-80, ECF No. 40. \nGeoffrey Stobart, Chief Deputy in charge of Corrections for the Franklin \nCounty Sheriff's Office, also testified that the photographs could be used for gang \naffiliation or identification purposes.  In addition to the testimony cited above, \nChief Stobart stated at a different point in his deposition that photographs of \ntattoos were taken to \"identifyO potential gang tattoos and threats that could be \nconsidered in a classification of the inmates.\"  Stobart Dep. 142, ECF No. 39. \nDefendant's expert, Captain Stewart, opines generically in his report that \n\"[m]any facilities across the country photograph the tattoos of incoming \ndetainees,\" Stewart Dep. 19, ECF No. 162-3, but he does not say that these \nfacilities take photographs of tattoos in private areas.  Captain Stewart states that \nthe photographs can be \"used as a classification and identification tool.\"  /d. \nCaptain Stewart also opines that photographing the tattoos is the \"least intrusive \nand most reliable\" way to document these tattoos, because detainees would \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 22 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 23 of 27  PAGEID #: 4418\nhave to be exposed for longer periods of time if I D T echs attempted to document \nthese tattoos in writing.  ld. at 20.  He asserts that ID Techs cannot rely on the \ndetainees' description of the tattoo because, in his experience, \"when asking a \ndetainee what tattoos they have and where they are placed on their body, the \ndetainee is likely to be misleading with the information provided.\"  ld. \nThe Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether \nDefendant's photographing of tattoos on private areas of detainees is an \nexaggerated response to the security risk posed by gang-affiliated inmates being \nhoused together in the jail's general population. \nFirst, Defendant did not introduce evidence explaining how photographs of \ntattoos generally, let alone photographs of tattoos on private areas, were \nexamined at a later time by Defendant to ensure that gang classifications for \nhousing purposes were properly made.  The evidence did not demonstrate how \nthe photograph itself, as opposed to the initial review and classification of the \ntattoo, aided in in determining whether a tattoo signified gang affiliation.  Ms. \nOwens testified generally that the photographs were necessary \"[b]ecause [her] \nID staff were not gang investigators,\" Owens Dep. 79, ECF No. 40, but \nDefendant did not cite evidence presenting how photographing the tattoos fixed \nthat problem. \nThere is conflicting evidence on the actual reason Defendant takes the \ntattoo photographs.  As discussed above, Defendant's employees cite two \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 23of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 24 of 27  PAGEID #: 4419\ndifferent reasons for taking the photographs: gang affiliation and identification for \nfuture victims and perpetrators.  Both Cunningham and Barajas, however, \ntestified that the policy of photographing all tattoos was put into place after \ntattoos were useful in identifying victims of a serial killer, not as a response to \ngang violence.  Stewart Report 19, ECF No. 162-3. \nSecond, there is conflicting evidence as to whether Defendant views there \nto be a risk of gang-affiliated tattoos on private areas.  Chief Stobart testified that \nhe has \"heard\" of gang tattoos on breasts and genitals.  Stobart Dep. 144, ECF \nNo. 39.  However, Defendant did not cite to any specific instance where gang \ntattoos were found on private areas and, as importantly, Defendant did not \nroutinely inspect the private areas of detainees to look for gang-affiliated tattoos. \nInstead, ID Techs relied on detainees to admit they have tattoos in order to \ndetermine they needed to be photographed.  See, e.g., Cunningham Dep. 41, \nECF No. 44-1.  Defendant, therefore, states on the one hand that tattoos on \nprivate areas present a serious risk, while on the other hand, it fails to even \ninspect for tattoos unless a detainee admits to having one.  This is particularly \nquestionable given that Defendant's own expert opined that inmates typically lie \nabout the presence of such tattoos.  See Stewart Dep. 20, ECF No. 162-3. \nThird, Defendant has not cited any evidence that Defendant's tattoo \nphotography policy was consistent with any other jail's policy for admitting new \ndetainees.  As stated above, Defendant's expert testified generally that other \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 24 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 25 of 27  PAGEID #: 4420\ncorrections facilities photograph tattoos, but he did not identify any facility that \ntakes these photographs when the tattoo is located on a detainee's private areas. \nThe Court has not found any case law involving such invasive photography \npolicies.  The lack of any evidence in the record or case law suggesting that \nother jurisdictions follow this same practice raises questions as to whether \nphotographing tattoos on private areas is a reasonable response to the threat \nposed by gang-affiliated tattoos. \nDefendant cites one analogous case in support of its policy.9  In Schmidt v. \nCity of Bella Villa, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found that an arrestee's \nFourth Amendment rights were not violated when she was required to unzip her \npants and fold them inward in order to have a tattoo near her hipbone \nphotographed.  557 F .3d 564, 568, 572, 574  (8th Cir. 2009).  The court stated \nthat \"[t]here are legitimate law-enforcement purposes served by photographing \nthe tattoos of an arrestee for use in identification.\"  /d. at 572.  In that case, the \npolice had learned that the arrestee had given false identification information \nduring her arrest, including a false name, date of birth, and social security \nnumber.  /d. at 573.  The court found that taking the photograph was justified to \nuse the tattoo as an \"identifying mark.\"  /d. \nThe Court considers Schmidt as persuasive authority but finds it to be \n9 Defendant also cites to Armstrong v. Jackson, No. 3:06-cv-87, 2009 WL 585853 **15-\n16 {S.D. Ohio March 6, 2009).  However, that case involved a tattoo on an arrestee's \nstomach that was photographed for purposes of identifying whether he was the \nperpetrator in a particular case.  Neither the reason for taking the tattoo nor the location \nof the tattoo is at all analogous to this case. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 25 of 27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 26 of 27  PAGEID #: 4421\ndistinguishable and therefore departs from the reasoning of the Eighth Circuit in \nsome respects.  First, the arrestee in Schmidt was not required (due to the \nlocation of the tattoo) to completely expose her genitalia or another private area. \nInstead, she only needed to roll down her pants to the extent necessary to \nexpose the tattoo near her hipbone.  /d.  This is less invasive than the \nphotographs taken by Defendant in this case.  Second, in Schmidt there is no \nindication that photographing tattoos was done in all cases; rather, it appears that \nit was done in that case only because the plaintiff had given a false identification \nto the police.  The Schmidt court discussed the plaintiff's use of a false \nidentification when evaluating the justification for the search.  See id. at 573. \nThe second distinction is critical in the Court's view.  Schmidt's provision of \nfalse identifying information provided the police in that case with an immediate \nneed to collect further identifying information.  The court indicated in that case \nthat photographing the tattoo was part of the police's interview of Schmidt \nregarding her identity.  /d. at 567.10 \nAdditionally, Plaintiff has failed to point to substantial evidence \ndemonstrating there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether \n10 \nWhile it is true that the Supreme Court in Florence, decided after Schmidt, found that \nsearches could be performed on a uniform basis and not only when suspicion existed \nwith respect to the particular detainee, broadly applied searches were necessary in \nFlorence to prevent the problem of contraband, including drugs and weapons, entering \njails.  /d. at 327, 338. \"[D]eterring the possession of contraband depends in part on the \nability to conduct searches without predictable exceptions.\"  /d. at 327-28.  This same \nsecurity justification is not present when it comes to the photographing of detainee's \ntattoos for identification purposes. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 26 of27 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 187 Filed: 03/30/18 Page: 27 of 27  PAGEID #: 4422\nDefendant's tattoo photography policy was an exaggerated response to its \ninterested in maintaining security at Jackson Pike.  While the evidence cited by \nDefendant was insufficient to entitle it to summary judgment on the photography \nclass claims, it nevertheless does raise a genuine issue of material fact. \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that there are genuine issues of \nmaterial facts as to whether Defendant's policy of photographing all tattoos, \nincluding those located on the \"breasts, hypogastric region, genitals, and/or \nbuttocks,\" violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \nTherefore, both Plaintiffs and Defendant's motions for summary judgment on the \nphotography class claims are DENIED. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, ECF \nNo. 163 is DENIED, Defendant's motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 162, is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and Defendant's motion to strike, \nECF No. 172, is DENIED AS MOOT. \nThe Court will hold an in-person status conference to discuss the next \nsteps in this case on Thursday April 19, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nCase No. 2:15-cv-2763  Page 27 of 27 ",

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n.JU.OOE  T \nMAGISTRATE JUDGE ABEL \nINTRODUCTION \nThis is a class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendant of rights \nsecured to the Plaintiff and proposed Class by the United States Constitution and the laws \nof the United States of America. For the past several years, Franklin County has required \nthat  all  individuals placed into  the custody of the Franklin County Workhouse  (the \n\"Workhouse\") be subject to strip searches in groups upon admission, as well as have their \ntattoos photographed by Corrections Officers, oftentimes one of the opposite sex.  Upon \ninformation and belief, this practice is also applied to individuals admitted to the Franklin \nCounty Correctional Center.  Upon information and belief, these policies are, in part, \nderived from the written procedures of Franklin County, Ohio. \nPlaintiff Jane Doe brings this  action on behalf of herself,  and on behalf of a \nproposed Class of thousands of other female detainees who were illegally strip searched \nin groups, and, furthermore, who had photographs taken of their tattoos, many of which \nwere in private areas, to vindicate the clear and unnecessary violation of her civil rights \n1 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 2 of 20  PAGEID #: 7\nand those of the Class Members she proposes to represent.  Plaintiff was charged with a \nnon-felony  offense,  and was  strip  searched before  she  was  arraigned  and given an \nopportunity to post bail.  Additionally, the Plaintiff has several tattoos in compromising \npositions on her body.  These tattoos were also photographed prior to the Plaintiffs \narraignment, and prior to her being given an opportunity to post bail.  These actions were \ntaken against the Plaintiff in violation of her rights under the Fourth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution, and the right to privacy, which is protected by the Fourteenth \nAmendment and is also an independent right with other constitutional underpinnings. \nThe manner in which these searches occurred, especially photographing tattoos on female \narrestees, including tattoos on a female's breasts or private areas, is also excessive and \nunnecessary for issues of jail security.  A more humiliating and abusive set of procedures, \nenforced on individuals who oftentimes have been convicted of nothing and have not \neven been arraigned, is difficult to imagine.  The Plaintiff seeks monetary damages from \nDefendant  for  herself and  each member  of the  Proposed  Class,  a  declaration  that \nDefendant's policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction precluding Defendant from \ncontinuing to violate the rights of those placed into the custody of the Franklin County \nWorkhouse  and  Franklin County  Correctional  Center.  With this  as  a  background, \nPlaintiff complains as follows: \n2 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 3 of 20  PAGEID #: 8\nJURISDICTION \n1.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1341 &  1343 because it is filed to obtain compensatory damages and \ninjunctive relief for the deprivation, under color of state law, of the rights of citizens of \nthe United States secured by the Constitution and federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1983. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action under the provisions of28 U.S.C. ยง \n2201,  as  it is  filed to  obtain declaratory relief relative to the constitutionality of the \npolicies of a local government. \n2.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. ยง 139l(b)(2) because a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff's and Class claims occurred within this \njudicial district. \nPARTIES \n3.  Plaintiff Jane Doe is a citizen of the United States and resides in Franklin \nCounty, Ohio.  In or around June 2012, Ms. Doe was arrested and placed in the Franklin \nCounty Workhouse on non-felony charges of disorderly conduct, which is classified as a \nminor misdemeanor under Ohio law.  The Plaintiff has filed an application to file this \ncase anonymously for reasons detailed in a motion filed contemporaneously with this \ncomplaint. \n4.  Defendant  Franklin  County,  Ohio  (\"Franklin  County\")  is  a  county \ngovernment organized and existing under the laws of the State of Ohio. At all times \nrelevant hereto, Franklin County was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, \nimplementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Franklin County Workhouse \n(\"the  Workhouse\")  and  the  Franklin County  Correctional  Center  (the  \"Correctional \n3 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 4 of 20  PAGEID #: 9\nCenter\"), and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of \nall  Workhouse personnel.  In addition,  at  all  relevant  times,  Franklin County  was \nresponsible for enforcing the rules of the Workhouse and the Correctional Center, and for \nensuring that personnel employed at the Workhouse and at the Correctional Center obey \nthe Constitution and laws ofthe United States and ofthe State of Ohio. \n5.  The  Franklin  County  Workhouse  is  located  at  2460  Jackson  Pike, \nColumbus, Ohio.  The Franklin County Correctional Center is located at 370 South Front \nStreet, Columbus, Ohio. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n6.  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  pursuant  to  Rules  23(b)(l),  23(b)(2)  and \n23 (b )(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and a Class of \nsimilarly situated individuals who were charged with or convicted of misdemeanors or \nminor crimes and were strip searched upon their entry into the Workhouse. \n7.  The Classes and Subclasses that Plaintiffs seek to represent is defmed as \nfollows: \nPrimary Class \nAll female detainees who have been or will be placed into \nthe  custody  of the  Franklin  County  Workhouse  and/or \nFranklin County Correctional Center, after being charged \nwith  misdemeanors,  summary  violations,  violations  of \nprobation,  traffic  infractions, civil commitments or other \nminor crimes, including failure to pay fmes, and were strip \nsearched upon their entry into the Workhouse and/o r the \nCorrectional  Center,  pursuant to  the  policy,  custom and \npractice  of the  County  of Franklin.  The  class  period \ncommences on May 23, 2011, and extends to the date on \nwhich  Franklin  County  is  enjoined  from,  or  otherwise \ncease.s,  enforcing  its  policy,  practice  and  custom  of \n4 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 5 of 20  PAGEID #: 10\nconducting blanket, group strip searches on all detainees \nadmitted to the Workhouse and/or the Correctional Center. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are Defendant and any \nand  all  of its  respective  affiliates,  legal  representatives, \nheirs, successors, employees or assignees. \nPre-Arraignment Detainee Subclass \nAll  female  detainees  who  are  members  of the  Primary \nClass  and who  were subjected to  strip  searches prior to \nbeing  arraigned  and/or  provided  with  a  reasonable \nopportunity to post bail. \nPhotograph Subclass \nAll  female  detainees  who  are  members  of the  Primary \nClass and who had photographs taken of their tattoos by \nCorrections Officers at  that Franklin County Workhouse \nand/or the Franklin County Correctional Center. \n8.  This action has been brought and may properly be maintained as a Class \naction  under  Federal  law  and  satisfies  the  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality  and \nadequacy requirements for maintaining a class action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n9.  The  members  of the  Class  are  so  numerous  as  to  render  joinder \nimpracticable.  Upon  information  and  belief,  there  are  hundreds  of female  citizens \narrested for non-felony offenses who are placed into the custody of the Workhouse and \nCorrectional Center every month -- all of whom are members of the Proposed Class. \nUpon information and belief, the size of the Proposed Class totals at least thousands of \nindividuals, some of whom have had their civil rights violated on multiple occasions. \n10.  Upon  information  and  belief,  joinder  of all  of these  individuals  1s \nimpracticable because of the large number of Class Members and the fact that Class \nMembers  are  likely  dispersed  over  a  large  geographical  area,  with  some  members \npresently  residing  outside  of  Ohio  and  this  Judicial  District.  Furthermore,  upon \n5 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 6 of 20  PAGEID #: 11\ninformation and belief, many members of the Class are low-income persons, may not \nspeak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually. \n11.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, in \nthat they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures violated by \nDefendant's conduct of performing illegal strip searches and illegally photographing the \ntattoos  of detainees.  All members  of the Class were charged with misdemeanors  or \nsummary violations when placed into the custody of the Workhouse and the Correctional \nCenter, and all were illegally searched in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the \nright to privacy. \n12.  Furthermore, common questions of law and fact also exist regarding the \nmanner in which detainees, including all members of the proposed class, were searched \nby Franklin County.  The Plaintiff maintains that the Defendant had a policy and practice \nof conducting blanket group strip searches of all detainees on their admission to the \nWorkhouse and the Correctional Center.  Many of these detainees were not yet arraigned \nbefore a judicial officer, and many also had their tattoos photographed by corrections \nofficers.  The Plaintiff will maintain, as a matter of law, that this conduct represents an \nunreasonable seizure under the Constitution, and should be enjoined by this Court. \n13.  Plaintiff's claims are typical of the claims of the members of the Class. \nPlaintiff and all members of the Class, and its respective subclasses, sustained damages \narising out of Defendant's course of conduct. The harms suffered by the Plaintiff are \ntypical of the harms suffered by the members of Class. \n6 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 7 of 20  PAGEID #: 12\n14.  The  representative  Plaintiff has  the  requisite  personal  interest  in  the \noutcome of this action and will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Class. \nPlaintiff has no interests that are adverse to the interests of the Members of the Class. \n15.  Plaintiff  has  retained  counsel  with  substantial  experience  in  the \nprosecution of Class action and civil rights litigation, including successful litigation of \ncivil rights  cases.  Plaintiffs counsel has the resources,  expertise and experience to \nsuccessfully prosecute this action against Franklin County.  Counsel for the Plaintiff \nknows of no conflicts among members of the Class or between counsel and members of \nthe Class. \n16.  This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the \nPlaintiff seeks Class Certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), in that all Members of \nthe Proposed Class were subjected to the same policy requiring the blanket, group strip \nsearches of detainees at the Workhouse and Correctional Center, as well as photography \nof their tattoos.  In short, Workhouse and Correctional Center personnel acted on grounds \ngenerally applicable to all members of the Class. \n17.  In addition to certification under Rule 23(b)(2),  and in the alternative, \nPlaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). \n18.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class, \nand predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the Class. \nThese common questions of law and fact include, without limitation, the common and \npredominate  question of whether the  Defendant's  written  and/or  de facto  policy  of \nconducting uniform group strip searches on all individuals charged with misdemeanors or \nminor crimes is  a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \n7 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 8 of 20  PAGEID #: 13\nStates Constitution, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the \nClass Period.  Common questions also exist regarding the conduct of these searches on \ndetainees  who have not been arraigned,  and  the excessiveness of photographing the \ntattoos of female detainees. \n19.  A Class action is  superior to  other available methods  for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of this controversy, since joinder of all of the individual members \nof the Class is impracticable given the large number of members of the Class and the fact \nthat they are dispersed over a large geographical area.  Furthermore, the expense and \nburden  of individual  litigation would make  it  difficult  or impossible  for  individual \nmembers of the Class to redress the wrongs done to them. The cost to the federal court \nsystem of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous. Individualized \nlitigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system. \nBy contrast, the conduct of this action as a Class action in this District presents far fewer \nmanagement difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and \nprotects the rights of each member of the Class. \n20.  Upon information and belief, there are no other actions pending to address \nthe Defendant's flagrant violation of the civil rights of thousands of individuals, even \nthough upon information and belief the Defendant has maintained its illegal practices for \nseveral years. \n21.  In the alternative to certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs \nalso seek partial certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c )( 4) . \n8 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 9 of 20  PAGEID #: 14\nFACTS \nFacts Applicable to the Class Generally \n22.  The  Fourth  Amendment  of the  United  States  Constitution  prohibits \nFranklin County officials, such as Workhouse and Correctional Center personnel in this \naction, from conducting strip searches of detainees at a local correctional facility in a \nmanner that does not respect a detainee's privacy rights in the unnecessary viewing of \ntheir naked bodies.  Allowing for detainees to be strip searched in groups, in the absence \nof appropriate  individual  privacy,  is  a violation  of the  United  States  Constitution. \nFurthermore,  requiring  female  detainees  to  have  all  of their  tattoos  photographed, \nincluding photographs of tattoos in private areas, also violates the Fourth Amendment \nand is not reasonably related to jail security. \n23.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution further prohibits \nthe blanket strip searches of detainees who have not been arraigned or been provided with \na  reasonable  opportunity  to  post  bail.  These  same  prohibitions  also  apply  to  the \nphotography of tattoos of female detainees who have not been arraigned or been provided \nwith a reasonable opportunity to post bail. \n24.  Upon information and belief,  Franklin County has  instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducting blanket strip searches of all \ndetainees who  enter the custody of the Workhouse and the Correctional Center,  and \nconducting these searches in large groups in the absence of privacy partitions.  These \nsearches  are  conducted  regardless  of the  condition  of the  individual  or  reasonable \nsuspicion of whether the individual is harboring contraband.  For the vast majority of \ndetainees and class members,  these strip  searches are done prior to  a detainee being \n9 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 10 of 20  PAGEID #: 15\narraigned before a judicial officer to contest the circumstances of their detention, or being \nprovided with a reasonable opportunity to post bail following arraignment. \n25.  Upon information and belief,  Franklin County has  instituted a written \nand/or de facto policy, custom or practice of photographing the tattoos of all detainees \nwho enter the custody of the Workhouse and the Correctional Center.  These photographs \nare taken regardless where a tattoo is on the body, or whether there is  any basis to \nbelieve that these  tattoos  have  any relationship  to jail security  issues.  The female \ndetainees and class members in this action undoubtedly have tattoos  in a variety of \nprivate areas, including on their breasts, buttocks, inner thighs, mons pubis and pudendal \ncleft, all of which have been photographed and stored in the computer banks of the \nWorkhouse  and  Correctional  Center.  For the  vast majority  of detainees  and  class \nmembers,  their tattoos were photographed prior to  being  arraigned before  a judicial \nofficer  to  contest  the  circumstances  of their  detention,  or  being  provided  with  a \nreasonable opportunity to post bail following arraignment. \n26.  The County knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement \nof a policy or practice of conducting blanket strip searches on Class Members without \nproviding  reasonable  privacy  measures,  and,  for  members  of the  Pre-Arraignment \nDetainee  subclass,  in  the  absence  of reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  a  detainee  is \nharboring contraband.  The County also knows that it may not institute, enforce or permit \nenforcement of a policy or practice of conducting the uniform photography of tattoos of \nmembers of the photography subclass in the absence of that practice having a reasonable \nrelationship to jail security issues. \n10 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 11 of 20  PAGEID #: 16\n27.  Furthermore, the County's policies, practices and customs, as addressed \nabove, are both offensive and absurd.  Forcing all female detainees to disrobe and be strip \nsearched  in  groups,  as  compared  to  allowing  detainees  to  disrobe  in  private,  is \nunnecessary and humiliating.  Forcing many of these same detainees to have their tattoos \nphotographed and stored in Franklin County computers is beyond cavil, and is grossly \nhumiliating,  abusive  and  unnecessary.  These  practices  are  particularly  offensive \nconsidering that many class members have not been arraigned and/or have not been given \nan opportunity to post bail on minor offenses. \n28.  The Defendant's written and/or de facto policies, practices and customs \nmandating the blanket, group strip searches of detainees and the photography of tattoos \nhas been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and contrary to clearly \nestablished law. \n29.  Pursuant to these written and/or de facto policies, each member of the \nClass, including the named Plaintiff, was the victim of a routine, compulsory blanket \ngroup  strip search upon their entry into the Workhouse and the Correctional Center. \nThese strip searches were conducted without inquiry into or establishment of reasonable \nsuspicion as to whether the Class Members harbored contraband, and in fact were not \nsupported by reasonable suspicion.  They also were unreasonable given more dignified \nalternatives, including allowing detainees to disrobe and be searched in private, being \ninspected only by one corrections officer versus being searched in a large group.  These \nstrip searches have been conducted on individuals arrested for, among other innocuous \noffenses, driving while intoxicated, driving with a suspended license, harassment and \ntrespassing. \n11 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 12 of 20  PAGEID #: 17\n30.  Relative to the photograph subclass, each member of this subclass was \nalso the victim of the routine, compulsory photographing of tattoos upon their entry into \nthe Workhouse and the Correctional Center.  This wholesale regime of photographing the \ntattoos  of female  detainees  was  conducted  without  any  consideration  of whether \nphotographing the tattoos in question had any reasonable relationship to jail security or \norder, or, more importantly, how the location of the tattoo related to those issues. \n31.  As a direct and proximate result of the blanket, group strip searches and \ntattoo photographs  conducted pursuant to  these written and/or de facto  policies,  the \nvictims of the unlawful practices -- each member of the Class,  including the named \nPlaintiff -- has  suffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation,  suffering and \nmental anguish. \nFacts Applicable to the Named Plaintiff Jane Doe \n32.  Plaintiff Jane Doe resides in Franklin County, Ohio. In or around June \n2012, Ms. Doe was arrested on non-felony charges of disorderly conduct. Specifically, \nMs. Doe was alleged to have been loud outside of a bar in the gateway area of Columbus. \n33.  The  circumstances  of Ms.  Doe's  arrest  were  void  of any  reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that she was secreting a weapon or contraband in a private area. \n34.  At approximately 9:00PM, Ms. Doe was arrested for disorderly conduct \nand taken directly to the Franklin County Workhouse.  Upon information and belief, Ms. \nDoe was taken to the Workhouse because the Correctional Center was overcrowded. \nApproximately one hour later, Ms.  Doe was taken to a room and subjected to  a strip \nsearch.  As part of her strip search, Ms. Doe was required to remove several piercings \n12 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 13 of 20  PAGEID #: 18\nwhile being  viewed by Corrections  Officers,  including piercings  in her breasts  and \nstomach.  This strip search was conducted prior to Ms. Doe being arraigned before a \njudicial officer, or being provided with a reasonable opportunity to post bail. \n35.  Several hours after being strip searched, Ms.  Doe was then taken to a \nroom where a male and female corrections officer were stationed.  At this time, Ms. Doe \nwas asked if she had any tattoos.  After responding in the affirmative, Ms.  Doe was \nrequired to expose her tattoos to be photographed by the male and female corrections \nofficer.  Ms. Doe had two tattoos on her mons pubis, including one approximately 12 inch \nfrom her clitoral hood, as well as several tattoos on other parts of her body.  None of \nthese tattoos are related to gang activity, nor would anyone reasonably believe they are \ngang related; instead, they are a female symbol, a phrase in Italian, a poem, the words \n\"beautiful disaster,\" the words \"living to die, dying to live,\" a rainbow and a flower. Ms. \nDoe was subsequently forced to remove her clothes, including her pants and underwear, \nto allow complete strangers to photograph these tattoos.  When Ms. Doe objected, she \nwas told that this photography was \"routine\" and the \"procedure.\"  Presumably, these \nhighly personal photographs are currently stored in the databanks of Franklin County. \nThese photographs were taken prior to Ms. Doe being arraigned before a judicial officer, \nor being provided with a reasonable opportunity to post bail. \n36.  Ms. Doe's father posted her bail, presumably set per the bail schedule, at \n5:30  AM  after  she  called  him  following  the  conclusion  of the  booking procedures \ndetailed above.  She was eventually released at 7:30PM.  Ms. Doe had to appear in court \non one occasion, after which her charges were dismissed. \n13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 14 of 20  PAGEID #: 19\n3 7.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search, Plaintiff has \nsuffered and continues to suffer psychological pain, humiliation, suffering and mental \nanguish. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n-- Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law--\n- Unreasonable Search and Seizure-\nStrip Searches \n38.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n39.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  searches  and  seizures by law  enforcement  officers,  and prohibits \nofficers from conducting blanket strip searches, especially strip searches performed in \ngroups, on individuals who have not been arraigned or been provided with a reasonable \nopportunity to post bail.  The Fourth Amendment also requires corrections officials to \nconduct any such searches only when supported by reasonable suspicion to believe a \ndetainee has contraband secreted in a private area. \n40.  The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution also protects \ncitizens  from  being  strip  searched  in  a  manner  that  is  abusive  and  intentionally \nhumiliating, including when those strip searches are conducted in the presence of other \ndetainees. \n41.  The actions of Defendant detailed above violated the  Plaintiffs rights \nunder the United States Constitution. Simply put, it was not objectively reasonable for \n14 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 15 of 20  PAGEID #: 20\nWorkhouse and Correctional Center personnel to engage in blanket strip searches of \ndetainees prior to their arraignment or prior to their being provided with a reasonable \nopportunity to post bail.  In short, it was completely unnecessary, as well as  legally \nunjustifiable,  for  the  Defendant to  require  its  corrections  officers  to  engage  in  the \nmandatory strip searches of detainees who were not provided with an opportunity to post \nbail, and where reasonable suspicion was not otherwise present.  It is difficult to imagine \na more humiliating and unnecessary procedure than conducting uniform strip searches on \nindividuals who will not enter the general jail population because they will be able to \naffect their immediate release on minor criminal charges. \n42.  Additionally, the rights of the Plaintiff and members of the proposed class \nwere  also  violated  because  their  strip  searches  occurred  in  the  presence  of other \ndetainees. \n43.  This strip search regimen was conducted pursuant to the policy, custom or \npractice of Franklin County and its Department of Correction.  As such, Franklin County \nis directly liable for the damages of Plaintiffs and members of the Class. \n44.  Defendant Franklin County is responsible for establishing the strip search \nprocedures utilized in the Workhouse and Correctional Center, and is further responsible \nfor the implementation of written policies at these facilities. \n45.  This conduct on the part of Defendant represents a violation of 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983, given that the actions of the Workhouse and Correctional Center personnel were \ntaken under color of state law. \n46.  As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiff and the Members of the Strip Search Class have been irreparably injured. \n15 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 16 of 20  PAGEID #: 21\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n--Violation of Constitutional Rights Under Color of State Law--\n-- Unreasonable Seizure; Violation of the Right to Privacy-\nPhotography of Tattoos \n47.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n48.  The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects citizens \nfrom  unreasonable  seizures  by  law  enforcement  officers,  and  prohibits  correctional \nofficials from photographing the private parts and other hidden areas on a detainee in the \nabsence of a reasonable justification, and in an unreasonable manner.  Additionally, the \nright to privacy is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment and is also an independent \nright with other constitutional underpinnings.  The right to privacy similarly constrains a \nstate official from photographing the private parts or other private areas on a citizen, and, \nimportantly, prohibits the continued retention of those photographs after a detainee's \ncriminal case has been resolved. \n49.  The actions of Defendant detailed above violated and improperly invaded \nPlaintiffs rights to privacy and to be free from unreasonable seizures. Simply put, it was \nnot  objectively  reasonable  for  Workhouse  and  Correctional  Center  personnel  to \nphotograph the tattoos of the Plaintiff and Members of the Class when those tattoos were \nclearly not gang related, and were located in the private areas of a woman's body.  This is \nespecially true for detainees who were not provided with a reasonable opportunity to post \nbail or contest their detention during arraignment. \n50.  Defendant Franklin County is responsible for establishing the policies and \nprocedures to be utilized in the Workhouse and Correctional Center, and is responsible \n16 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 17 of 20  PAGEID #: 22\nfor the implementation of the strip search policies questioned in this lawsuit. As such, \nFranklin County is responsible for the damages of the Plaintiff and Members of the Class. \n51.  This conduct on the part of the Defendant represents a violation of 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1983, given that its actions were taken under color of state law. \n52.  As  a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described \nabove, Plaintiffs and the members of the Class have been irreparably injured. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n--Demand for Declaratory Judgment-\n53.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n54.  The  policies,  customs  and  practices  of  the  Defendant  are  clearly \nunconstitutional and violate the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and \nalso violate the right to privacy. \n55.  Plaintiff and  Members  of the  Class  request  that  this  Court  issue  a \ndeclaratory judgment, and that it declare the strip search and photography policies of the \nDefendant to be unconstitutional and violative of the right to privacy. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n- Demand for Preliminary and Permanent Injunction --\n56.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference and realleges each and every allegation \nstated in the foregoing paragraphs. \n57.  The  policies,  custom  and  practice  of  the  Defendant  are  clearly \nunconstitutional  and  violate  the  right  to  privacy  and  the  right  to  be  free  from \n17 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 18 of 20  PAGEID #: 23\nunreasonable searches and seizures.  In short, both their strip search and photography \npolicies are unconstitutional \n58.  Demand for deletion of all photos taken of class members' tattoos. \n59.  Upon information and belief, these policies, practices and customs are \ncurrently in place at  the Workhouse  and the  Correctional  Center,  with new  and/or \nprospective Members of the Class being subjected to the harms that have already been \ninflicted upon the Plaintiff. \n60.  The  continuing  pattern  of strip  searching  and  photographing  female \ndetainees  charged with minor crimes will cause irreparable harm to the new and/or \nprospective members of the Class, an adequate remedy for which does not exist at law. \n61.  Plaintiff demands  that  Franklin County  immediately desist  from  strip \nsearching  and  photographing  female  detainees  charged  with  minor  crimes  who  are \nadmitted to the Workhouse and/or the Correctional Center, and seek both a preliminary \nand permanent injunction from this Court ordering as much.  The Plaintiff also seeks an \ninjunction ordering the deletion of all photographs of tattoos taken from the bodies of \nfemale detainees at the Workhouse and the Correctional Center. \nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY \n62.  The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury. \n18 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 2 Filed: 05/23/13 Page: 19 of 20  PAGEID #: 24\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Jane Doe, on behalf of herself and on behalf of others \nsimilarly situated, request that this Honorable Court grant them the following relief: \nl.  An order certifYing this action as a Class Action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23. \n2.  A judgment against Defendant Franklin County on Plaintiff's First and \nSecond Causes of Action detailed herein, awarding compensatory damages to Plaintiff \nand each Member of the Proposed Class in an amount to be determined by a jury and/or \nthe Court on both an individual and a Class-wide basis. \n3.  A declaratory judgment against the Defendant declaring the Defendant's \npolicies, practices and customs to be unconstitutional, violative of the right to privacy and \notherwise improper. \n4.

Abel \nFRANKLIN COUNTY, OHIO,     \n \n    Defendant. \n           \n  ORDER \n  The Court has recently begun to review Plaintiffโs motion to certify class.  (ECF No. 45.) \nUpon review the Court realized that Plaintiffโs motion targets class definitions proposed in the \nsecond amended complaint (ECF Nos. 45-3, 54) which was denied by the Magistrate Judge (ECF \nNo. 70).  Plaintiffโs briefing tries to further modify the class definitions.  (ECF No. 64.)   Even \nbriefing by Defendant regarding the gender specifications within Plaintiffโs class definitions \naffects numerosity.  (ECF No. 55 at 2.)  As a result, the Court DENIES WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE Plaintiffโs motion to certify class (ECF No. 45), and DENIES WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE Defendantโs motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 69).   \nThe Court hereby ORDERS Plaintiff to file a new motion to certify class using the \nproperly defined classes as set forth in the first amended complaint.  That motion must be filed \non or before December 23, 2014.  The parties are directed to brief the motion in accordance with \nLocal Rule 7.2.  A non-oral hearing on Plaintiffโs motion to certify class is set for February 17, \n2015.   \n \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-TPK Doc #: 75 Filed: 12/09/14 Page: 2 of 2  PAGEID #: 2169\nNo motions for summary judgment will be accepted until the Court has ruled on \nPlaintiffโs motion to certify class.  The Court will schedule a telephone status conference \nfollowing the ruling on the motion to certify class.   \nIn light of this Order, ECF Nos. 71 and 72 are moot and ECF Nos. 73 and 74 are vacated.  \nThe non-oral hearing date of December 16, 2014 is vacated. \n   IT IS SO ORDERED.             \n            /s/ Gregory L.

WHY IS TIDS A CLASS ACTION? \nIn a class action, one or more people, called Class Representatives (in this case Kristen McDonald), \nsue on behalf of all people who have similar claims. All these people are a Class or Class Members. \nOne Court resolves the issues for all Class Members, except for those who exclude themselves from \nthe Class. United States District Michael H. Watson is in charge of this class action. \nIV.  WHY IS THERE A SETTLEMENT? \nThe Court did not decide in favor of Plaintiff or Defendant. Instead, both sides agreed to a Settlement. \nThat way, they avoid the costs and risks of a trial, and the people affected will get compensation. The \nClass Representative and her attorneys think the Settlement is best for everyone who was subject to \nJackson Pike's practices during the class period. \nV.  HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM A MEMBER OF THE CLASS? \nDistrict Judge Watson has decided that everyone who fits this description is a Class Member: \nAll female detainees who have been placed into the custody of the Franklin County \nCorrectional Center Two (\"Jackson Pike\"), after being charged with misdemeanors, \nminor  misdemeanors,  violations  of  probation,  traffic  infractions,  civil \ncommitments, city code violations or other minor crimes, including failure to pay \nfines,  and had photographs taken of their breasts, hypogastric region, genitals, \nand/or buttocks upon their entry into the  Jackson Pike facility prior to  being \narraigned before a judicial officer, pursuant to the policy, custom and practice of \nthe County of Franklin. Detainees who are members of the class had photographs \ntaken of their genitals, their hypogastric region, the lobes of their buttocks and/or \nthe lobes of their breasts at the Jackson Pike facility. The class period commences \non May 23, 2011, and extends until April 30, 2014. \nSpecifically excluded from the class are the Defendant and any and all  of its \nrespective  affiliates,  legal  representatives,  heirs,  successors,  employees  or \nassignees. \nCounsel for all parties agree that Franklin County ceased photographing tattoos on the private parts \nof detainees charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes on April 30, 2014, the date on which \nthey  changed  their  policy  and  trained  their  employees  to  cease  taking  such  photographs. \nConsequently, the Class Period runs from May 23, 2011 until April 30, 2014. If you are a female, \nwere admitted into the custody of Jackson Pike during this time, and had photographs taken of \ntattoos on your private parts, you are a member of the class. \nThis lawsuit does not cover men, individuals charged with felony offenses, or individuals who had \ntattoos photographed that were not on their private parts at the time of their entry into the Jackson \nPike facility. Also excluded are employees and representatives of the Defendant. \n4 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 246 Filed: 02/08/22 Page: 15 of 22  PAGEID #: 5225\nVI.  HOW DO I KNOW IF I QUALIFY TO BE IN THE CLASS? \nClass Counsel understands the sensitivity that many class members have about their time in the \nFranklin County Jail. Any contact between class members and Class Counsel is confidential. If you \nare delivered this notice, Class Counsel has reviewed your records and determined you are a member \nof the Class.  You need to cooperate with class counsel in order for class counsel to locate you, and \nfor them to make sure that you receive your settlement payment.

It also means that all of the Court's orders will apply to you and legally bind you. \nYou will receive a cash payment if you stay in the class.  The attorneys for the class, and all litigation \nand administrative expenses, are being paid from the settlement fund. \nTHE SETTLEMENT BENEFITS - WHAT YOU GET \nVIII.  WHAT DOES THE SETTLEMENT PROVIDE? \nDefendant has agreed to provide a total settlement fund amount of $2,500,000 to compensate Class \nMembers whose tattoos were photographed while at the Jackson Pike facility during the class period. \nThis settlement fund amount will cover all costs, administration and notification expenses, payments \nto class members, attorney fees, class notice, and all aspects of the administration of settlement, \nincluding but not limited to,  attorneys'  feesup  to  a maximum of $833,333.33,  class  counsel's \nlitigation expenses and a service award to the class representative of $50,000 for stepping forward \nand representing the Class. \nA complete description of the settlement is provided in the Settlement Agreement and Release.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBJECTING AND EXCLUDING \nMYSELF? \nObjecting is simply telling the Court that you do not like something about the Settlement. You can \nobject only if you stay in the Class. Excluding yourself is telling the Court that you do not want to be \na part of the Class.

Photos were \ntaken of tattoos on the breasts, genitals, buttocks and in the area below the belly button. The \nPlaintiff alleges that the taking of these photographs of tattoos on a female detainee's private \nparts, as embodied in Franklin County policy, violates the Constitution of the United States. \nFranklin County claims that its practices are justified and legal. \nThis lawsuit does not include men, individuals who were charged with felonies, or individuals \nwho did not have tattoos on their privates. \nWho is Included in the Class? \nYou are a class member if you are female, were admitted into the Jackson Pike Facility between \nMay 23, 2011 and April 20, 2014, were only charged with a misdemeanor or other minor crime, \nand had tattoos on your private parts photographed during your admission to the Jackson Pike \nfacility. \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 246 Filed: 02/08/22 Page: 22 of 22  PAGEID #: 5232\nAre You Entitled to Any Benefits at This Time? \nYes.

Watson \nv. \nMagistrate Judge Vascura \nFranklin County, Ohio, \nDefendant. \nOPINION AND ORDER \nDefendant Franklin County, Ohio (\"Defendant\") moves for summary \njudgment against Plaintiff on her remaining photography class claims.  Mot. \nSumm. J., ECF No. 198.  For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is \nDENIED.1 \nI. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Procedural Background \nPlaintiff filed her Complaint on May 23, 2013, and subsequently amended \nthe Complaint on September 30, 2013.  As discussed in the Court's prior Opinion \n1 Because this opinion and order deals with an issue that was previously briefed and \ndecided by the Court based on a more limited set of facts, the bulk of this opinion's \nprocedural background, facts, and legal standards are simply repeated from the Court's \nprior Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part Defendant's first motion for \nsummary judgment, ECF No. 187. \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 2 of 13  PAGEID #: 4771\nand Order on the parties' motions for summary judgment, ECF No. 187, the \nAmended Complaint asserts that Defendant's procedures for admitting detainees \nto the Franklin County Corrections Center at Jackson Pike (\"Jackson Pike\"), \nwhich typically houses female detainees, are unconstitutional under the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments.  After the Court granted summary judgment to \nDefendant on certain claims in its prior Opinion and Order, ECF No. 187, \nPlaintiff's only remaining claim relates to Defendant's policy of photographing all \ntattoos on detainees, including tattoos on a detainee's private areas. \nThe Court previously certified a photography class pursuant to Rule \n23(b )(2) and Rule 23(b )(3), permitting Plaintiff to seek both injunctive and \nmonetary relief on behalf of the photography class.  Order 20, ECF No. 92. \nIn its prior Opinion and Order, the Court denied Defendant's motion for \nsummary judgment on the photography class claims, finding \"that there are \ngenuine issues of material facts as to whether Defendant's policy of \nphotographing all tattoos, including those located on the 'breasts, hypogastric \nregion, genitals, and/or buttocks,' violates the Fourth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution.\"  Op. & Order 27, ECF No. 187. \nBased on the briefing presented for the prior round of summary judgment, \nthe Court was concerned that it had not been presented with all relevant facts \nnecessary to rule on Plaintiff's photography class claims.  Therefore, after ruling \non the motions for summary judgment, the Court held a status conference on \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 2 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 3 of 13  PAGEID #: 4772\nApril26, 2018.  At that status conference, the Court ordered supplemental \ndiscovery to address the following questions from the Court: \nWhat does Defendant do with the tattoo photographs that are taken? \nIf the  photographs  have  ever been  subsequently  reviewed,  what \npurposes  have  been  served by the  review?  Are the photographs \nreviewed for gang affiliation/classification prior to admitting detainees \nto the general population of Jackson Pike?  Are they subsequently \nreviewed for gang affiliation/classification after detainees are admitted \nto the general population? \nDo any other facilities photograph tattoos on private areas?  If so, is it \nonly for felony arrestees or is it also done for misdemeanor arrestees? \nOrder, ECF No. 189.  The Court also gave the parties an opportunity to file \nrenewed motions for summary judgment, id. at 2, which Defendant opted to do, \nECF No. 198. \nB. Factual Background \nThe general facts of this case have been laid out in the Court's prior orders \nand are repeated here as a starting point. \nOn June 29, 2012, Plaintiff Kristen McDonald was arrested for disorderly \nconduct (a fourth-degree misdemeanor).  Plaintiff was transported to Jackson \nPike, one of the County's two local correctional facilities.  Jackson Pike typically \nhouses female detainees, while the second facility (Corrections Center One) \ntypically houses male detainees.  Both facilities receive individuals charged with \na range of violations, from serious felony offenses to minor misdemeanors and \ncity code violations. \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 3 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 4 of 13  PAGEID #: 4773\nUpon admittance to Jackson Pike, Plaintiff was subject to the institution's \n\"change-out\" procedure, which required Plaintiff to strip to her underwear in front \nof a Franklin County Corrections Deputy.  The Deputy visually inspected Plaintiff \nto determine if she had contraband on her person.  Plaintiff was also required to \nremove her underwire brassiere and piercings from her breasts while being \nwatched by a corrections officer, at which point Plaintiff received a Jackson Pike \nuniform.  Plaintiff does not allege or assert that the Deputy or other County \npersonnel touched her at any point. \nAfter Plaintiff underwent this visual inspection and change of clothing, she \nwas directed to the identification room by a County Identification Technician (\"ID \nTech\").  Plaintiff was asked whether she had any tattoos, and after she \nresponded that she did, including tattoos on her genitals, her tattoos were \nphotographed.  Plaintiff has testified that the photographer was a male, Michael \nCunningham.  Plaintiff has also testified that the doorway to the identification \nroom was open when the photographs were taken.  Furthermore, the room is \nsubject to video monitoring.  The photos are stored on a computer where they \ncan be accessed by several individuals.  Plaintiff has not provided any evidence \nthat anyone has inappropriately accessed or used the photographs. \nAfter having her tattoos photographed, Plaintiff was transferred to a \nhousing unit in the general population of the Jackson Pike facility.  She was \nreleased on bail the next day.  Two days later, Plaintiff was arraigned in the \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 4 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 5 of 13  PAGEID #: 4774\nCounty Municipal Court, the charges against her were dismissed, and her record \nwas sealed. \nThe remaining facts, including the facts revealed during the supplemental \ndiscovery period, will be discussed as part of the analysis of Defendant's motion \nfor summary judgment. \nII. STANDARD \nThe standard governing summary judgment is set forth in Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 56( a), which provides: \"The court shall grant summary judgment \nif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and \nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56( a).  The \nCourt must grant summary judgment if the opposing party fails to make a \nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that \nparty's case and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. \nCelotex Corp. v.  Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); see also Van Gorder v. \nGrand Trunk W. R.R., Inc., 509 F.3d 265, 268 (6th Cir. 2007). \nWhen reviewing a summary judgment motion, the Court must draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, who must set forth \nspecific facts showing there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial, and the \nCourt must refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the \nevidence.  Pittman v.  Cuyahoga Cty. Dep 't of Children and Family Servs., 640 \nF.3d 716, 723 (6th Cir. 2011 ).  Summary judgment will not lie if the dispute about \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 5 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 6 of 13  PAGEID #: 4775\na material fact is genuine, \"that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury \ncould return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Barrett v.  Whirlpool Corp., 556 F.3d 502, 511 (6th Cir. \n2009).  Thus, the central issue is '\"whether the evidence presents a sufficient \ndisagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that \none party must prevail as a matter of law.\"'  Pittman, 640 F.3d at 723 (quoting \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52). \nIll. ANALYSIS \nA.  Standard for Fourth Amendment Claims for Pretrial Detainees \nBoth the Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit have issued a number of \nopinions evaluating the Fourth Amendment rights of pretrial detainees.  While \n\"there is no mechanical way to determine whether intrusions on an inmate's \nprivacy are reasonable,\" Florence, 566 U.S. 318, 327 (2012) (citing Bell v. \nWolfish, 441  U.S. 520, 559 (1979)), prior decisions have provided both general \nguidance for how to evaluate such claims as well as a number of examples \nproviding points of comparison when evaluating corrections policies. \nAs an initial matter, convicted prisoners, or pretrial detainees as in this \ncase, \"do not forfeit all constitutional protections by reasons of their conviction \nand confinement in prison.\"  Bell, 441  U.S. at 545.  These rights include \"the \nFourth Amendment's guarantee of 'reasonable expectations of privacy.\"' \nWilliams v.  City of Cleveland, 771  F .3d 945, 950 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 6 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 7 of 13  PAGEID #: 4776\nStoudemire v.  Mich. Oep't of Carr., 705 F.3d 560, 572 (6th Cir. 2013)).  However, \nthat \"does not mean that these rights are not subject to restrictions and \nlimitations.\"  Bell, 441  U.S. at 545.  \"[M]aintaining institutional security and \npreserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that may require \nlimitation or retraction of the retained constitutional rights of ... pretrial \ndetainees.\"  Bell, 441  U.S. at 546. \nBecause \"the problems that arise in the day-to-day operation of a \ncorrections facility are not susceptible of easy solutions,\" officials \"should be \naccorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and \npractices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and \ndiscipline and to maintain institutional security.\"  /d. at 547.  \"[l]n the absence of \nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated \ntheir response to these considerations, courts should ordinarily defer to their \nexpert judgment in such matters.\"  /d. at 548. \nTherefore, even when a correctional facility policy infringes on a \nconstitutional guarantee, \"the practice must be evaluated in the light of the \ncentral objective of prison administration, safeguarding institutional security.\"  /d. \nat 547.  In other words, \"The need for a particular search must be balanced \nagainst the resulting invasion of personal rights.\"  Florence, 566 U.S. at 327 \n(citing Bell generally).  In order to conduct this balancing test, the Court \"must \nconsider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 7 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 8 of 13  PAGEID #: 4777\nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.\" \nBell, 441  U.S. at 559. \n\"Florence does not stand for the proposition that every search conducted \npursuant to a jail's uniformly applicable search policy is impregnable from attack \non that basis alone.\"  Williams, 771  F.3d at 951.  Strip searches are \"a \nparticularly extreme invasion\" of Fourth Amendment rights, and they \"may be \nunreasonable by virtue of the way in which [they are) conducted.\"  ld. at 951-52. \n\"Any given search or seizure of a detainee may not arbitrarily or needlessly \nencroach upon the detainee's privacy rights but must instead be 'reasonably \nrelated to legitimate penological interests.\"'  Williams, 771  F.3d at 950 (quoting \nStoudemire, 705 F.3d at 572).  In Williams, for example, the jail's method of \nsearching prisoners (arrestees were fully disrobed in front of a correctional officer \nand sprayed on their naked body, including their exposed genitals, with a \ndelousing solution from a pressurized metal canister) was such a \"significant \nincursion into plaintiffs' privacy rights\" that the Sixth Circuit found \"the jail's need \nto perform the searches in [that] particular manner must be unusually dire before \nit can outbalance the affront to plaintiffs' privacy.\"  ld. at 954. \nIf there is no \"readily available alternative\" to the correctional facility's \npractice, it is likely that the policy is \"reasonably related to its legitimate \npenological interests.\"  ld. at 950.  However, an easy alternative to the policy \n\"that fully accommodate[s] the prisoner's rights at de minimis cost to valid \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 8 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 9 of 13  PAGEID #: 4778\npenological interests\" suggests the facility's choice to implement that policy does \nnot outweigh the constitutional burden imposed on its detainees.  /d. \nB.  Photography Class Claims \nAs explained above, the parties were granted additional discovery and \npermission to file a second motion for summary judgment on the photography \nclass claims.  The new evidence Defendant provided in its motion for summary \njudgment and Plaintiff provided in her response all goes to Defendant's \njustification for its tattoo photography policy.  In its prior Opinion and Order, the \nCourt found that Defendant had two justifications for photographing all tattoos on \ninmates-i.e. identification of gang affiliation and identification in future law \nenforcement cases, Op. & Order 20-23, ECF No. 187, and the Court questioned \nwhether identification of gang affiliation was truly one of the purposes of the \npolicy.  Defendant addressed one of the Court's concerns by providing testimony \nindicating that Franklin County's jails have encountered at least one gang-related \ntattoo on an inmate's genitals (lightning bolts signifying the Aryan brotherhood).2 \nMartin Dep. 31:6-20, ECF No. 196.  While one tattoo found on an inmate's \ngenitals seems to be a relatively rare occurrence, it does provide some evidence \nsupporting Defendant's argument that gang-related tattoos in private areas could \nbe a legitimate safety threat. \nDefendant went on to address the Court's questions by presenting some \n2 There is no testimony that this identification was aided by a photograph of the tattoo. \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 9 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 10 of 13  PAGEID #: 4779\nevidence that there are other jails that photograph tattoos in sensitive areas.  See \nMot. Summ. J. 17-19, ECF No. 198.  Specifically, Defendant's expert, Captain \nStewart, sent an inquiry to an email list from the National Jail Academy and the \nNational Institute for Jail Operations asking whether those agencies \nphotographed arrestees' tattoos on private areas, and whether such photographs \nwere only taken for felons or also for misdemeanants.  /d. at 17.  Five institutions \nresponded, and each of them indicated that they take photographs of tattoos on \nboth felony and misdemeanor arrestees.  Stewart Aff. 7, ECF No. 198-1.  Only \nthree of the facilities specified that they take photographs of the tattoos even if \nthey are on a private area.  One of these three indicated that they take the \nphotographs in a \"discrete [sic] manner\"-but did not specify what that means \nand another specifically stated that photographs taken of tattoos near private \nareas are taken by zooming in so the photograph depicts only the tattoo.  /d. \nDefendant does not zoom in so that only the tattoo is depicted, as evidenced by \nthe photograph taken of Plaintiff.  Here again, Defendant's supplemental \ninformation provides limited evidence that there are some other facilities that \nfollow a similar tattoo photography policy.  It is unclear, however, how many \nfacilities are on the email list Captain Stewart used and why all the other facilities \nchose not to respond.  Defendant's evidence also reveals that at least one of the \nfive responding facilities takes the photographs in a less intrusive manner. \nDefendant's motion for summary judgment also added a new purported \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 10 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 11 of 13  PAGEID #: 4780\npenological interest for taking the photographs-protecting the health, safety, \nand welfare of inmates.  In essence, Defendant argues that jail house tattoos can \nspread communicable diseases throughout the jail and Defendant has a duty to \ntry to prevent them.  Mot. Summ. J. 15-16, ECF No. 198.  However, Defendant \nfails to provide any evidence that photographs of tattoos have ever been used in \nfurtherance of this penological interest. \nPlaintiff responds to Defendant's renewed motion for summary judgment \nfirst by arguing that \"Defendant has not offered any evidence that these \nphotographs are actually reviewed by anyone for gang affiliation.  Resp. 8, ECF \nNo. 208.  Specifically, Plaintiff cites testimony from Mary Jane Martin, the Risk \nManager for the Franklin County Sheriff, in which she agreed, \"generally \nspeaking,\" that tattoo photographs were not reviewed for gang classification \npurposes unless the ID tech recognized the tattoo to be a threat.  Martin Dep. 66, \nECF No. 196.  There was no routine policy of reviewing the tattoo photographs to \nensure that none of the tattoos were gang related.  /d. at 69:17-24.3  Defendant's \nexpert, Captain Stewart, testified that jail personnel would not be \"doing their job\" \nif they took photographs of tattoos for gang classification but never subsequently \nreviewed the photographs.  Stewart Dep. 149-50, ECF No. 195. \nPlaintiff uses the Pima County Jail, the facility at which Captain Stewart \n3 Ms. Martin added testimony indicating that one of the purposes for taking the tattoo \nphotographs is for use by outside law enforcement agencies.  See id. at 71 :6-11. \nCase No. 2: 13-cv-503  Page 11 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 12 of 13  PAGEID #: 4781\nworks, as a point of comparison for how photographs could be used.  Resp. 9, \nECF No. 208.  Captain Stewart testified that at the Pima County Jail all \nphotographs of tattoos are reviewed by security personnel to determine whether \nthe tattoo is gang related.  Stewart Dep. 7 4, ECF No. 195.  This is necessary \nbecause intake staff are not trained to identify gang tattoos, but the security \npersonnel are.  See id. at 79:16-18.  Franklin County, on the other hand, does \nnot have staff trained in gang tattoo identification review the photos as a matter \nof course.  This was one of the Court's key concerns in its prior Opinion and \nOrder, and additional discovery has not allayed the Court's concerns. \nAfter a supplemental period of discovery and another round of briefing on \nsummary judgment, the same genuine issues of material fact remain that the \nCourt discussed in greater detail in its prior Opinion and Order.  Op. & Order 23-\n25, ECF No. 187.  While Defendant is entitled to \"wide-ranging deference\" in \nadopting its security policies, Bell, 441  U.S. at 547, this deference is not without \nlimits.  Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact as to whether Defendant exaggerated its response to the problem \nposed by gang-related tattoos.  Indeed, both Plaintiff and Defendant have cited \nevidence that other facilities handle this same security threat in a far less \nintrusive fashion. \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503 \nPage 12 of 13 \n\nCase: 2:13-cv-00503-MHW-CMV Doc #: 213 Filed: 09/30/19 Page: 13 of 13  PAGEID #: 4782\nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant's renewed motion for summary \njudgment, ECF No. 198, is DENIED.  The Court will notice a telephonic status \nconference to discuss trial. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nMl~~t~Jc&!oo~ \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nCase No. 2:13-cv-503  Page 13 of 13 ",
