    "summary": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Arkansas was the only state in the country that provided landlords the option of a criminal eviction process when tenants failed to pay rent on time. Criminal charges could be brought against a tenant if three elements were met: (1) a landlord alleged that a tenant was behind on rent, regardless of the truth of the allegation and even if the tenant was only one day late; (2) the landlord notified the tenant in writing that they must leave their home because they were behind on rent; and (3) the tenant \"willfully and unnecessarily\" remained in the home more than ten days after receiving the written notice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On September 2, 2021, the plaintiffs in this putative class action lawsuit filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against the Prosecuting Attorney for Malvern/Hot Spring County and the Sheriff of Hot Spring County, challenging the constitutionality of the state's criminal eviction statute. The plaintiffs sought class action certification for all people in the state of Arkansas who are or will be unable to afford rent and who are being or will be at risk of prosecution under Ark. Code &sect; 18-16- 101. The named plaintiffs in this case were served with a failure to vacate eviction notice because they cannot afford to pay rent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The named plaintiffs, both of whom were disabled, received Social Security disability payments as their only source of income. These payments amounted to less than $1,200 per month between the two of the named plaintiffs. Additionally, due to their landlord's failure to make necessary repairs, the named plaintiffs had not had running water since August 2020. The named plaintiffs could not afford to pay rent plus the new expenses acquired to compensate for their lack of running water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Represented by attorneys from Equal Justice Under Law and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Bowen Legal Clinic, the named plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, alleged that Arkansas's law violated their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants criminalized the plaintiffs' conduct based on their indigence in violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because the criminal eviction statute allows for excessive fines for each day past the ten days after receiving written notice from the landlord. The complaint alleged that such fines were grossly disproportionate to the underlying behavior of failing to pay rent, even when that failure was non-willful, and were imposed without an ability to pay determination.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plaintiffs also alleged that the state law violated procedural due process rights because a criminal action could be brought solely on the basis of the landlord's statement and because the law did not provide a cap on the number of criminal charges or excessive fines that might be imposed. Further, the plaintiffs argued that the law violated their due process and equal protection rights by failing to require consideration of the plaintiffs' ability to pay and because the law lacked a willfulness requirement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment, a judgment preliminarily and permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing the state law, and attorneys' costs and fees.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Sheriff of Hot Spring County moved to dismiss this case on November 8, 2021. In his motion, the defendant Sheriff stated that the Arkansas State Supreme Court had previously upheld the state law. Additionally, the defendant Sheriff claimed that the plaintiffs failed to meet the burden required for a facial constitutional challenge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Prosecuting Attorney named as a defendant in this case also filed a motion to dismiss on November 10, 2021. In the motion to dismiss, the defendant alleged both that the case was moot and that the defendant was entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and sovereign immunity.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of January 26, 2022, the case is ongoing with a trial date set for January 30, 2023.</p>",

Arkansas is the only state in the United States that criminalizes the failure to pay \n  1 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 2 of 35 PageID #: 3\n \nrent.1  \n2.  Failure to pay rent is traditionally approached as a civil matter, handled in landlord-\ntenant court. Landlords can pursue evictions for non-paying tenants in landlord-tenant court. \nIndeed, Arkansas has two civil eviction processes. Landlords can pursue an unlawful detainer \neviction (the most common form of eviction) under Ark. Code ยง 18-60-307 or, in some places, \nwhat is known as a 2007 Act eviction under Ark. Code ยง 18-17-901. Landlords are successful in \nsecuring evictions via these civil methods and routinely have the upper hand in these proceedings, \nsince, for example, they almost always have a lawyer to represent them in unlawful detainer cases, \nwhereas tenants do not.2 \n3.  Arkansas is the only state that offers landlords the option of a criminal process in \naddition to civil remedies, turning a civil debt into a criminal offense. Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 (the \nโCriminal Eviction Statuteโ) allows criminal charges to be brought against a tenant if three \nelements are met: (1) a landlord alleges that a tenant is behind on rent (regardless if the tenantโs \nfailure to pay is willful and regardless if the landlord is truthful), (2) the landlord notifies the tenant \nin writing that she must leave her home because she is behind on rent, and (3) the tenant โwillfully \nand unnecessarilyโ remains at home more than ten days after receiving written notice.   \n4.  Every day beyond the 10-day notice period that a tenant remains at home โ even \n                                                 \n1 Human Rights Watch, Pay the Rent or Face Arrest: Abusive Impacts of Arkansasโ Draconian \nEvictions Law 1 (Feb. 2013), https://www.hrw.org/reports/us0113arkansas_reportcover_web.pdf \n[hereinafter Pay the Rent or Face Arrest]; Ark. Gen. Assembly Non-Legis. Commโn For the Study \nof Landlord-Tenant Laws Report at 17 (2012), reprinted in 35 U. Ark. Little Rock L. Rev. 739 \n(2013) [hereinafter Landlord-Tenant Laws Report]; Duhon v. State, 299 Ark. 503, 512 (1989) \n(Purtle, dissenting) (โArkansas has won another distinction: it is the only state in the nation which \nimposes criminal sanctions on a person who does not pay his rent on time.โ). \n2 Lynn Foster, Arkansas Eviction Report December 2020, Arkansans for Stronger Communities \n(Jan. 13, 2021), https://www.arkstrongcommunities.com/december-eviction-report/ (last visited \nAug. 26, 2021) [hereafter December 2020 Eviction Report]. \n  2 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 3 of 35 PageID #: 4\n \nif the tenantโs failure to pay rent is non-willful โ is considered a separate criminal offense, subject \nto excessive fines of up to $25 per offense. Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101(b).  \n5.  There is no cap on how many criminal offenses or excessive fines a tenant may \nface.  Id.  \n6.  In practice, private landlords use this law to force tenants to self-evict. According \nto State Representative and landlord Richard McGrew, โThis law is really just used to get [tenants] \nout of the apartmentโฆwe just want them out of our apartment so we can re-rent it.โ3 Terry Schug, \nGreene County Landlord Association president, justifies the law as landlords โneed[ing] a good \nway to evict people.โ4 \n7.  The self-eviction strategy is effective, as a landlord threatening to call the sheriff to \narrest tenants for being behind on rent causes tenants to abandon their homes just to avoid the \npossibility of criminal prosecution.5 \n8.  Tenants  who  do  not  self-evict  and  go  to  court  โ  who  are  almost  always \nunrepresented โ can be met with judges who tell them to move out or else be jailed for contempt \nof court.  \n9.  In practice, tenants are not given the opportunity to present defenses in Criminal \nEviction Statute proceedings โ as they are in civil landlord-tenant court โ and are not given the \nopportunity to make up for alleged due rent. Cf. Munson v. Gilliam, 543 F.2d 48, 53 (8th Cir. \n1976). If a tenant offers funds to cover a portion or all of the alleged due rent, judges will routinely \ntell the tenant that it is the landlordโs decision whether to accept the funds. Most landlords will \n                                                 \n3 Maya Miller and Ellis Simani, When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, ProPublica (Oct. \n26,  2020),  https://www.propublica.org/article/when-falling-behind-on-rent-leads-to-jail-time \n[hereinafter When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time] \n4 Id. \n5 Id. \n  3 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 4 of 35 PageID #: 5\n \nrefuse the funds, preferring instead that the tenant leave the property. \n10.  Supporters  of  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute  include  landlords  attempting  to \ncircumvent the expense associated with pursuing an eviction through civil landlord-tenant court. \nAccording to Hot Springs Landlord Association President Steve Webster, landlords support the \nCriminal Eviction Statute because they want โa simple, easy to use law thatโs inexpensive.โ6 The \nArkansas Realtors Association supports the criminal eviction process because it is โless costlyโ to \nlandlords than the civil eviction process7 because landlords must cover their own attorneysโ fees \nin civil cases, whereas in criminal evictions, the taxpayer foots the bill, as the publicly-funded \nprosecutor assumes that attorney role.8 In testifying before the Arkansas House Insurance and \nCommerce Committee on April 5, 2021 on HB1798, an unsuccessful bill to repeal the Criminal \nEviction Statute, William Jones, President of the Landlords Association of Arkansas, expressed \nhis support for the law because โit does not require an attorney which saves me (landlords) a \nconsiderable amount of money.โ9 \n11.  Landlordsโ professed desire for a โcheaperโ system to evict tenants โ by shifting \nthe financial burden of evictions from landlords in civil evictions to taxpayers in criminal evictions \n                                                 \n6 When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n7 Id. \n8 A Deputy Prosecutor Was Fired for Speaking Out Against Jail Time for People Who Fall Behind \non Rent, ProPublica (Nov. 27, 2020), https://www.propublica.org/article/a-state-prosecutor-was-\nfired-for-speaking-out-against-jail-time-for-people-who-fall-behind-on-rent  [hereinafter \nProsecutor Fired for Speaking Out] (โLandlords told ProPublica they preferred the criminal statute \nto civil evictions because the criminal process is cheaper. Taxpayers shoulder the cost when county \nattorneys . . . pursue tenants.

In the words of State Representative Jimmy Gazaway, the Criminal Eviction Statute \nis โan abuse of the criminal processโ10; it uses the โcoercive power of the criminal process and the \ncoercive power of the state to essentially evict someone on a civil debt or a civil contract.โ11 The \nscales of justice are tipped too far in favor of landlords looking for a cheap workaround from tenant \nprotections, all at the expense of tenants who are struggling to afford rent.  \n13.  Legislative efforts have so far been unsuccessful, as many state legislators are \nthemselves landlords and have voted down measures to repeal the law, prioritizing their personal \ngain over their duty to protect their constituents.12 \n14.  In the midst of an ongoing global pandemic and despite a national moratorium on \nevictions, Defendants continue to evict vulnerable residents by allowing private landlords to co-\nopt the criminal legal system to do their bidding, turning publicly-funded police and courts into \nlandlordsโ private debt collectors and creating debtorsโ prisons.13  \n                                                 \n10 Issues That Matter: Rentersโ Rights and Habitability Online Forum hosted by League of Women \nVoters  of  Pulaski  County  and  KUAR,  on  Aug.  19,  2021.

The latest bill in \n2021 to repeal the law, HB1798, was also defeated. \n13 See Myesha Braden et al., Too Poor to Pay: How Arkansasโ Offender-Funded Justice System \nDrives Poverty & Mass Incarceration, Lawyersโ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (March \n20, 2019), https://lawyerscommittee.org/too-poor-to-pay-how-arkansass-offender-funded-justice-\n  5 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 6 of 35 PageID #: 7\n \n15.  Arkansas has always known that this law creates debtorsโ prisons and yet has \npersisted in upholding it for 120 years.14 The Criminal Eviction Statute was introduced during a \ndark time in Arkansasโ history; an Arkansas State Senator who opposed the law pointed out that \nโwe all know what is done to a poor man in this state who cannot pay his fine. He is sent to jail \nand compelled to work it out,โ referring to convict leasing, which was still legal at the time of the \nlawโs passing.15  Convict leasing was created as a direct response to the passage of the 13th \nAmendment, which abolished slavery โexcept as a punishment for crimeโ; with convict leasing, \nwhite Americans could still extract free labor from and maintain control over Black Americans.16  \n16.  Echoing  the  racist  and  classist  origins  of  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute,  the \nvulnerable residents that Arkansas targets with this law remain disproportionately Black and low-\n                                                 \nsystem-drives-poverty-mass-incarceration/ (last visited January 27, 2021) [hereinafter Too Poor \nto Pay]; When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n14 Lynn Foster, The Hands of the State: The Failure to Vacate Statute and Residential Tenantsโ \nRights in Arkansas, 36 Univ. of Ark. at Little Rock L. Rev. 1, 6-8 (2013) (quoting Arkansas Senate \ndebate in 1901 when bill was first considered, including remarks from multiple senators that this \nwould result in people being jailed for poverty) [hereinafter Hands of the State]. In the words of \nstate Representative Gazaway, who is also a rental property owner, โItโs incredibly sad for our \nstate. . . . When you hear that people go to jail because they werenโt able to pay a private debt, itโs \nessentially the equivalent of a debtors prison, which you would have thought was part of our \nhistory. But apparently it remains alive in Arkansas today.โ When Falling Behind on Rent Leads \nto Jail Time, supra note 3. \n15 Hands of the State, supra note 14 at 7, quoting Senator Lawrence. Convict leasing was not \nabolished in Arkansas until 1909, though the incarcerated still often work for free.

By criminalizing poverty, the Criminal Eviction Statute is a form of wealth-based \ndiscrimination in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, as well as the Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition on the criminalization of status.  \n18.  Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction Statute is also unconstitutional for imposing excessive \nfines in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  \n19.  Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley have been served a failure to vacate criminal \neviction notice under Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 for non-payment of rent. After their landlord replaced \nthe water tank last year and left them without running water, Plaintiffs stopped paying rent because \nthey could no longer afford rent on top of the new expenses they had to incur as a result of not \nhaving running water (such as renting a porta potty and buying bottled water) and other necessary \n                                                 \n17 See, e.g., When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3; Hands of the State, \nsupra note 14 at 8, 56. \n18 Arkansas Crime Information Center, Failure to Vacate Arrest Rate Data, Sept. 2021 (on file \nwith Plaintiffsโ counsel); Talk Poverty, Overall Poverty 2020, Center for American Progress (last \nvisited March 25, 2021), https://talkpoverty.org/indicator/listing/poverty/2020 (Arkansasโ overall \npoverty rate is 16.2%); Data Commons, Ranking by Population (Below Poverty Level, Black or \nAfrican  American)  (last  visited  March  25,  2021), \nhttps://datacommons.org/ranking/Count_Person_BelowPovertyLevelInThePast12Months_Black\nOrAfricanAmericanAlone/State/country/USA?h=geoId%2F05&pc=1&scaling=100&unit=%25 \n(the poverty rate for Black Arkansans is 27.42%); Data Commons, Ranking by Population (Below \nPoverty  Level,  White)  (last  visited  March  25,  2021), \nhttps://datacommons.org/ranking/Count_Person_BelowPovertyLevelInThePast12Months_White\nAlone/State/country/USA?h=geoId%2F05&pc=1&scaling=100&unit=%25 (the poverty rate for \nWhite Arkansans is 13.60%). \n19 Arkansas Crime Information Center, Failure to Vacate Arrest Rate Data, Sept. 2021 (on file \nwith Plaintiffsโ counsel). \n  7 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 8 of 35 PageID #: 9\n \nexpenses (such as food and medicine). To this day, Plaintiffs do not have running water, yet they \nare being threatened with criminal prosecution. Plaintiffs are elderly, indigent, and have disabilities \nrequiring use of wheelchairs for mobility.  \n20.  As  a  result  of  these  constitutional  violations,  Plaintiffs  request  a  temporary \nrestraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction to enjoin Defendants from \ncharging Plaintiffs pursuant to Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101, and a declaration that Ark. Code ยง 18-16-\n101 violates the United States Constitution. \nPARTIES \n21.  Named Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley are married. They are in their sixties \nand  are  residents  of  Malvern,  Arkansas.  Both  plaintiffs  have  disabilities  and  use  power \nwheelchairs. Their only source of income is social security disability payments, which amount to \nless than $1,200/month between the two of them.   Mr. and Mrs. Easley represent themselves as \nindividuals and represent a Class of similarly-situated people subjected to Defendantsโ wealth-\nbased criminal eviction scheme. \n22.  Defendant Teresa Howell is the Prosecuting Attorney for Malvern/Hot Spring \nCounty. Teresa Howell (or her successor in office) is named in her official capacity as Prosecuting \nAttorney for Malvern/Hot Spring County. \n23.  Defendant Mike Cash is the Sheriff of Hot Spring County. The Sheriff is an elected \ncounty official who serves as the chief enforcement officer of the courts and has custody of the \ncounty jail within Hot Spring County. Captain Baker of the Sheriffโs Office signed and served the \nfailure to vacate eviction notice on Plaintiffs in April 2021 and did so while acting in his official \ncapacity as an agent of Sheriff Cash and the Sheriffโs Office of Hot Spring County. Defendant \nCash (or his successor in office) is named in his official capacity as Sheriff of Hot Spring County. \n  8 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 9 of 35 PageID #: 10\n \nDefendant Cash is referred to herein as โSheriff.โ  \n24.  Under the Supremacy Clause, the United States Constitution is the supreme law of \nthe land.  All government officials must uphold the Constitution, regardless of contrary instructions \nfrom state officials, local officials, or judges.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n25.  This is a civil rights action arising under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, \net seq.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1343.   \n26.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391. Defendants are \nresidents of Arkansas and Hot Spring County. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Plaintiffs Were Served with a Failure to Vacate Eviction Notice Under Ark. \nCode ยง 18-16-101 Because They Cannot Afford to Pay Rent \n \n28.  Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley moved into their current home in Malvern, \nArkansas in March 2019. They signed a month-to-month lease with their landlord for $400/month. \n29.  In August 2020, their landlord replaced the water tank and it immediately stopped \nworking.  \n30.  Since August 2020, Mr. and Mrs. Easley have not had running water. \n31.  In November 2020, following an on-site inspection, the Arkansas Department of \nHealth condemned their homeโs water distribution system and water heater installation and ordered \nthe water service (which had not been working since August 2020) to be terminated until the \nlandlord made necessary repairs, which, to this day, the landlord has not done. \n32.  Mr. and Mrs. Easleyโs November 2020 rent was waived due to the lack of running \nwater, but they have been charged rent since December 2020. \n33.  Mr. and Mrs. Easley stopped paying rent in December 2020 because they could no \n  9 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 10 of 35 PageID #: 11\n \nlonger afford to pay rent plus the new expenses they had acquired to compensate for their lack of \nrunning water. \n34.  Both Mr. and Mrs. Easley have disabilities and chronic health conditions. They use \npower wheelchairs. Their combined income is less than $1,200/month in social security disability \npayments. \n35.  As a result of not having running water, Mr. and Mrs. Easley started showering at \na friendโs house. They have had to rent a porta potty (about $100/month), buy water (about $300โ\n500/month) and go to a laundromat via wheelchair to do laundry (about $15/trip). These new \nexpenses incurred because of not having running water add up to more than Mr. and Mrs. Easleyโs \nrent. \n36.  Mr. and Mrs. Easley also have other necessary expenses, including their electric \nbill, food, medicine,  transportation, and food and veterinarian bills for their service/emotional \nsupport dogs. \n37.  In April 2021, Captain Baker of the Sheriffโs Office of Hot Spring County served \nPlaintiffs with a failure to vacate eviction notice, which stated that they had ten days to move out \nor they would be charged under Arkansas Code ยง18-16-101 (the criminal eviction, or failure to \nvacate, statute). The notice stated that the reasons for the eviction were failure to pay rent and \nnoncompliance with the rental agreement. \n38.  Plaintiffs never had an opportunity prior to receiving this notice to contest the \nnoticeโs claims in court and to date, Plaintiffs have not had a court hearing. \n39.  Since  receiving  the  notice,  Plaintiffs  signed  a  CDC  eviction  moratorium \ndeclaration, for which they qualify. \n40.  Since receiving the notice, Plaintiffs have also searched for other housing, but so \n  10 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 11 of 35 PageID #: 12\n \nfar it has been impossible to find something that meets their needs and is something that they can \nafford. They continue to live in their home โ without running water โ in the meantime. \n41.  The  Malvern/Hot  Spring  Prosecuting  Attorney  prosecutes  tenants  under  the \nCriminal Eviction Statute. \n42.  Criminal eviction cases are brought in Hot Spring County District Court. The Hot \nSpring District Court is a county-level court with jurisdiction to hear misdemeanor criminal cases \nwhen the alleged conduct occurred within Hot Spring County. The Hot Spring District Court is \nnot a court of record. \nB.  Arkansas Is the Only State that Criminalizes the Eviction Process \n \n46.  As it stands today, Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 (the โCriminal Eviction Statuteโ) allows \nthe landlord of a tenant who is late on rent โ even by one day โ to order the tenant to vacate the \npremises.20 If the tenant fails to leave within 10 days, the tenant is guilty of a misdemeanor offense \nfor each day she fails to vacate the premises following the expiration of the 10-day notice. Ark. \nCode ยง 18-16-101(b)(1). For each day she fails to vacate the premises following the expiration of \nthe 10-day notice, the tenant must also pay a fine of $1โ$25. Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101(b)(2).  \n47.  The Criminal Eviction Statute includes no cap on the number of convictions and \namount of fines to which a tenant can be subjected. Without a cap, and given that the fines are paid \nto the state, Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction Statute creates a perverse incentive for Defendants to \nallow fines to accumulate โ by delaying hearings, for example โ so as to extort as much as they \npossibly can from renters. \n48.  The Criminal Eviction Statute does not require that the tenantโs non-payment of \n                                                 \n20 Under Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101, being one day late on rent is enough to invalidate the entire \nlandlord-tenant contract and forfeit the tenantโs property interest, without any due process. \n  11 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 12 of 35 PageID #: 13\n \nrent be willful. The result of this absence of a mens rea component is that tenants can be and are \nprosecuted simply because they cannot afford rent, i.e., their non-payment of rent is not willful. \n49.  A landlordโs statement is all that is necessary to trigger the criminal process. Under \nthe Criminal Eviction Statute, charges may be filed against a tenant solely on the grounds of a \nlandlordโs statement that (1) a tenant did not pay rent on time and (2) the tenant failed to vacate \nthe premises within the 10-day notice period. An arrest warrant or criminal summons can be issued \nto the tenant solely based on the landlordโs statement, without investigation into whether the \nlandlordโs statement is true and without an opportunity for the tenant to dispute the amount alleged \nto be in arrears or to request consideration of the tenantโs ability to pay. \n50.  Eviction through the Criminal Eviction Statute does not end the renterโs nightmare; \nlandlords who wield the criminal process to evict tenants are still free to pursue a separate civil \naction against the tenant.  \n51.  Indeed, the Criminal Eviction Statute does not actually provide for eviction; it is a \ntool to threaten tenants into self-evicting.  \n52.  Actual eviction orders are obtained through the civil system and landlords have two \noptions to pursue evictions: what is known as an unlawful detainer eviction (the most common \nform of eviction) under Ark. Code ยง 18-60-307 and what is known as a 2007 Act eviction under \nArk. Code ยง 18-17-901. \n53.  Some landlords will pursue multiple cases against tenants simultaneously. They \nwill press criminal charges under the Criminal Eviction Statute, open a civil eviction claim under \nthe unlawful detainer statute, and open a small claims court case to recoup unpaid rent. \n54.  Arkansasโ criminalization of tenant evictions lags behind the standards of decency \nof every other state in the country. Every other state in the nation treats evictions as purely civil \n  12 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 13 of 35 PageID #: 14\n \nmatters. Arkansas has a civil eviction system, yet stands alone in allowing landlords to convert an \notherwise civil landlord-tenant dispute into a criminal prosecution.21 \n55.  A bipartisan, non-legislative commission charged by the legislature in 2012 with \nexamining the Criminal Eviction Statute recommended its full repeal, including all provisions that \nremain in effect today.22 \n56.  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (โHUDโ) \nforbids the use of the Criminal Eviction Statute in HUD-funded rental housing.23 Public housing \nproviders may only use eviction methods which HUD has determined meet the basic elements of \ndue process โ which does not include criminal evictions. 24 C.F.R. ยง 966.51. \n57.  Arkansas state courts are increasingly finding that the Criminal Eviction Statute is \nunconstitutional and, therefore, unenforceable.  See State v. Smith, Pulaski County Circuit Court \nCase No. 2014-2707 (2015); State v. Jones, Poinsett County Circuit Court Case No. 2014-389; State \nv. Bledsoe, Woodruff County Circuit Court Case No. 2014-77-2. These decisions invalidated the \nstatute in its entirety, including the provisions that remain in effect today. These decisions have \nreduced the number of prosecutions under the Criminal Eviction Statute across Arkansas, such that \nprosecutions are now brought only in a few jurisdictions, but prosecutions continue, even during \nthe pandemic.24 \nC.  Arkansasโ Wealth-Based Criminal Eviction Scheme Advances No Legitimate \nState Interest and Is Irrational; Any State Interest in Ensuring Rent Is Paid Cannot \nLawfully Be Satisfied Through Criminal Convictions and Excessive Fines \n \n                                                 \n21 See supra note 1. \n22 Landlord-Tenant Laws Report, supra note 1. \n23 Id. at 16. \n24 Between 2018 and October 2020, 1,050 criminal eviction cases were heard in Arkansas courts. \nWhen Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. From January through mid-March \n2021, at least three dozen people have been charged under the Criminal Eviction Statute. Only One \nState, supra note 12. \n  13 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 14 of 35 PageID #: 15\n \n58.  Defendants prosecute, jail, and fine tenants as punishment for tenantsโ non-willful \nfailure to pay rent. Punishing people for failing to make payments that they cannot afford is wealth-\nbased discrimination that violates due process, equal protection, and the Eighth Amendmentโs \nprohibition on criminalization of status.  \n59.  Defendants also impose excessive fines in violation of the Eighth Amendment that \nare grossly disproportionate to the underlying crime and are imposed without consideration of a \ntenantโs ability to pay.  \n60.  Defendantsโ fundamentally unfair criminal eviction scheme is not rationally related \nto any legitimate government objective because landlords already have a civil system (with two \ntracks) to address non-payment of rent and eviction issues. The criminal eviction scheme does not \nactually authorize evictions; it simply uses the threat of criminal conviction to scare tenants into \nself-evicting. \n61.  The scheme is further irrational in imposing excessive fines on tenants who already \ncannot  afford  rent  and  saddling  them  with  criminal  records  that  will  make  it  additionally \nchallenging for tenants to find stable housing and employment, not to mention the psychological \ntoll of having a criminal record. \n62.  The Criminal Eviction Statute leaves many who are unlucky enough to be charged \nwith it homeless and in poverty. There is no legitimate government interest in increasing poverty \nand homelessness. \n63.  For its various constitutional violations, the Criminal Eviction Statute must be \nstruck down. \na.  Defendantsโ Use of the Criminal Process Violates Plaintiffsโ Procedural \nDue Process Rights in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n \n64.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by (1) allowing criminal \n  14 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 15 of 35 PageID #: 16\n \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 solely on the basis of a landlordโs statement \nand (2) by having no cap on the number of criminal charges or excessive fines that can be imposed. \nLandlords also have access to two civil eviction remedies. By forcing tenants to either self-evict \nor face numerous criminal charges and fines โ even if landlords are lying and even when landlords \nhave access to a civil system โ Defendantsโ criminal eviction scheme tips the scales of justice too \nfar in landlordsโ favor in violation of due process. \n65.  Plaintiffs have a property interest in the rental property leased. Plaintiffs also have \na liberty interest in not being incarcerated. \n66.  Due process requires that Plaintiffs be provided a meaningful opportunity to \nchallenge any deprivation, by a state actor, of their property and liberty interests. Mathews v. \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).  That meaningful opportunity includes fair notice and adequate \nstandards so that the tenant is aware of what behavior is at issue, otherwise a law can be void for \nvagueness. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357-58 (1983); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. \n104, 108 (1972). \n67.  The Criminal Eviction Statute does not provide such a meaningful opportunity. \n68.  First, the statute does not require the landlordโs notice to the tenant, nor his \nstatement to the court, to be accurate or complete. Landlord notices often lack information as to \nwhy the tenant must vacate, how much time the tenant has to vacate, how the tenant can challenge \nthe notice to vacate, etc. According to Human Rights Watch, โ[M]any counties issue arrest \nwarrants and file criminal charges purely on the say-so of the landlord, without any further \ninvestigationโ and Human Rights Watch documented cases where landlords lied about their \ntenantsโ status and still managed to bring criminal charges against them.25 \n                                                 \n25 Pay the Rent or Face Arrest, supra note 1, at 3. \n  15 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 16 of 35 PageID #: 17\n \n69.  Second, the absence of any cap on the number of charges and fines that can be \nimposed โ separate from the statute of limitations and speedy trial provision โ means that the \ntenant who remains on the property after the 10-day notice period to contest the landlordโs notice \nto vacate is at the mercy of the pace of the criminal process to determine the tenantโs total exposure. \nA tenant who wishes to present a defense has no ability to safely remain at home while doing so \nbecause potential criminal exposure increases with each day.26 \n70.  The landlord has the benefit of the entire weight of the criminal system to address \nwhat is a private business transaction between two parties who have a contractual dispute. Being \nlate on a mortgage payment, a student loan, or a car payment โ all contractual civil debts โ does \nnot trigger criminal charges; yet in Arkansas, being late on rent can. The landlord alleges breach \nof contract and instead of resolving that breach of contract in civil court, as any other breach of \ncontract matter would be resolved,27 the landlord gets to use the bludgeon of the criminal system \nto scare the tenant into giving up their home without any kind of due process. In the words of \nPulaski County prosecutor Larry Jegley, tenants โare being charged with the crime of basically not \npaying rentโฆ Allowing one class of businesspeople to avail themselves of criminal process for \nbreach of contract is just fundamentally unconscionable.โ28  \n71.  The absence of a cap on criminal convictions and fines reinforces the landlordโs \n                                                 \n26 Even if a tenant were successful in defending her case, the Criminal Eviction Statute provides \nno mechanism to force the landlord to allow her to return to her home. By contrast, under \nArkansasโ unlawful detainer statute, a tenant wrongfully evicted could obtain a writ of restitution \nto return to her home. Ark. Code ยง 18-60-309(d)(2). \n27 The Arkansas Supreme Court has twice struck down statutes that criminalized a non-fraudulent \nbreach  of  contract.  State  v.  Riggs,  305  Ark.  217  (1991)  (invalidating  statute  criminalizing \ncontractorโs failure to pay for materials where statute required knowing or willful failure to pay); \nPeairs v. State, 227 Ark. 230 (1957) (striking down statute criminalizing a contractorโs failure to \ndischarge a laborerโs lien without element of fraud). \n28 When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n  16 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 17 of 35 PageID #: 18\n \noverwhelming leverage in violation of due process.  \n72.  Thus by tipping the scales of justice too far in landlordsโ favor, Defendants force \nrenters to make an impossible โ and unconstitutional โ choice between (1) self-evicting (i.e. \ngiving up their property interest) without due process to avoid criminal prosecution or (2) \nremaining on the property (meaning staying in their homes) and potentially face numerous criminal \ncharges, incarceration, and excessive fines.  \n73.  This criminal eviction scheme violates the procedural due process guarantees of the \nConstitution. \nb.  Defendants Also Violate Procedural Due Process by Not Considering \nPlaintiffsโ Ability to Pay \n \n74.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Procedural Due Process Clause prohibits outcomes \nin the criminal legal system from turning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment, \nincluding and especially incarceration (a.k.a. debtorsโ prisons). See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. \n660,  667  (1983)  (defendant  cannot  have  his  probation  revoked  for  being  too  poor  to  pay \nrestitution); Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971) (โ[T]he Constitution prohibits the State from \nimposing a fine as a sentence and then automatically converting it into a jail term solely because \nthe defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full) (quotations omitted); Williams \nv. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 244 (1970) (โthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nrequires that the statutory ceiling placed on imprisonment for any substantive offense be the same \nfor all defendants irrespective of their economic statusโ); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 19 (1956) \n(plurality opinion) (finding state may not condition criminal defendantโs right to appeal on ability \nto pay for trial transcript because there โcan be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets \ndepends on the amount of money he hasโ) . \n75.  Arkansasโ Constitution also prohibits debtorsโ prisons. Ark. Const. Art 2, ยง 16 (โNo \n  17 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 18 of 35 PageID #: 19\n \nperson shall be imprisoned for debt in any civil action . . . unless in case of fraud.โ).  \n76.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by allowing criminal \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 without considering a renterโs ability to pay. \n77.  A tenant who cannot afford rent has no way to raise indigence as a defense in \nCriminal Eviction Statute proceedings. \n78.  At no point โ not prior to filing charges, not at the time of filing charges, not during \ncourt appearances, not at the point of conviction, not at the point of imposing excessive fines โ is \nthe renterโs ability to pay considered. Without considering ability to pay, the Criminal Eviction \nStatute  effectively  criminalizes  poverty  in  violation  of  the  due  process  protections  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n79.  The imposition of daily fines without an ability-to-pay assessment as part of the \ncriminal sentence further criminalizes poverty and further violates the procedural due process \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment.29  \n80.  If the renter is not in a position to afford the daily fines (which is likely, given that \nthe renter was not in a position to afford rent), then that renter faces the possibility of even more \njail time and even more fines in the form of late fees, interest, etc. Any failure to pay criminal debt \ncan have enormous collateral consequences; additional fines and jail time come with all of the \ninevitable harm to housing, employment, a personโs driverโs license, child custody, mental and \nphysical health, and more.30 The Criminal Eviction Statute attempts to extract blood from a stone, \n                                                 \n29 Defendantsโ Criminal Eviction Statute is not only illegal, but self-defeating. If a renter cannot \nafford rent, it is unclear how that same renter will be able to afford fines on top of rent. These \nfines, furthermore, go to the state, rather than to the landlord who is alleging he is owed back rent. \nIndeed, it is for this reason that many landlords will also pursue a separate small claims court case \nto collect alleged back due rent. \n30 See, e.g., Too Poor to Pay, supra note 13. \n  18 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 19 of 35 PageID #: 20\n \nresulting only in driving renters deeper into poverty. \n81.  Due process therefore requires that the state of Arkansas conduct, at a minimum, \npre-deprivation (of the tenantโs property and liberty interests) ability-to-pay hearings that consider \nwhether non-payment of rent is willful. \nc.  By Not Considering Plaintiffsโ Ability to Pay, Defendants Also Violate \nEqual Protection \n \n82.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Equal Protection Clause also prohibits outcomes in \nthe criminal legal system, including and especially incarceration (a.k.a. debtorsโ prisons), from \nturning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment; hinging a personโs liberty on their \nability to pay is an unconstitutional form of wealth-based discrimination. See Bearden, 461 U.S.  \nat 667; Tate, 401 U.S. at 398; Williams, 399 U.S. at 244; Griffin, 351 U.S. at 19. \n83.  Comparing a wealthy and an indigent tenant demonstrates the double standard that \nthe Criminal Eviction Statute creates in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Criminal \nEviction Statute criminalizes the non-payment of rent; it does not distinguish between willful and \nnon-willful non-payment of rent. In practice, however, wealthy tenants will be extended the benefit \nof the willfulness standard and poor tenants will not, resulting in a different burden of proof \ndepending on the financial status of the defendant. In other words, the only way a wealthy tenant \nwill be prosecuted under this law is if they willfully do not pay rent, because the wealthy tenant \nhas the means to pay rent. The indigent tenant, on the other hand, who cannot afford rent, will be \nprosecuted for non-payment of rent even though their non-payment was not willful.  \n84.  By  lacking  a  willfulness  requirement,  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute  allows \nDefendants to implement an unconstitutional two-tier justice system in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause where the poor are prosecuted for non-payment of rent even when they cannot \nafford rent and the wealthy are only prosecuted for non-payment of rent if they willfully refuse to \n  19 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 20 of 35 PageID #: 21\n \npay rent. Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley have been threatened with prosecution because of \ntheir non-willful non-payment of rent. They stopped paying rent because they could not afford it \nalong with the necessary expenses they had to incur because their landlord stopped providing them \nwith running water a year ago. Plaintiffs are indigent and living off of a fixed income; their poverty \nis being criminalized.  \n85.  Because this law treats similarly-situated people (tenants who have not paid rent) \ndifferently, the law is an unlawful form of wealth-based discrimination in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause.31 \nd.  Defendants  Unconstitutionally  Criminalize  Plaintiffsโ  Status  of \nIndigence, in Violation of the Eighth Amendmentโs Prohibition on \nCruel and Unusual Punishment \n \n86.  The  Eighth  Amendmentโs  prohibition  on  cruel  and  unusual  punishment \n(incorporated against the states via the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment) prohibits \npunishing someoneโs status โ such as being alcoholic, see Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 \n(1962), or unhoused, see Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 616-17 (9th Cir. 2019) โ and \npunishing involuntary acts associated with that status. See Powell v. State of Tex., 392 U.S. 514, \n550 n.2 (1968) (White, J., concurring) (the โproper subject of inquiry is whether volitional acts \nbrought about the โconditionโ and whether those acts are sufficiently proximate to the โconditionโ \nfor it to be permissible to impose penal sanctions on the โcondition.โโ); see also Blake v. City of \nGrants Pass, No. 1:18-CV-01823-CL, 2020 WL 4209227, at *6 (D. Or. July 22, 2020) (appeal to \n9th  Cir.  filed  Oct.  8,  2020)  (invalidating  law  banning  โcampingโ  within  city  limits  as \n                                                 \n31 Relatedly, a wealthier tenant would be in a better position to secure alternative housing within \nthe extremely brief 10-day notice window. Non-wealthy tenants are left scrambling, often facing \nhomelessness as their only option. Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley have been looking for other \nhousing since receiving the failure to vacate eviction notice in April 2021, yet with their limited \nincome and disabilities, they have not found anything. \n  20 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 21 of 35 PageID #: 22\n \nunconstitutionally criminalizing involuntary behavior associated with homelessness); Driver v. \nHinnant, 356 F.2d 761, 765 (4th Cir. 1966) (holding law unconstitutional for criminalizing public \nintoxication against a โchronic alcoholicโ because it โpunishe[d] an involuntary symptom of a \nstatusโ). \n87.  The Criminal Eviction Statute punishes Plaintiffsโ status of indigence. Just as \nPlaintiffsโ non-payment of rent is non-willful, Plaintiffsโ non-payment of rent is an โinvoluntary \nsymptom[] of a status,โ namely the status of indigence. Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, \n930 F.3d 264, 282-83 (4th Cir. 2019). Plaintiffsโ act of not paying rent is not volitional and is \nbrought about by the condition of poverty; that act is sufficiently proximate to the condition of \npoverty to bar penal sanctions for that act. \n88.  Courts have not required immutable characteristics such as race or age to bring \nstatus-based challenges under the Eighth Amendment. Rather, courts have focused on chronic \nconditions that are not necessarily voluntarily in origin, but lead to involuntary behavior. See \nRobinson, 370 U.S. at 667 (describing addiction as something that can be acquired โinnocently or \ninvoluntarilyโ).  Like  addiction  or  homelessness,  poverty  is  a  chronic,  but  not  necessarily \npermanent, status that can be acquired innocently or involuntarily (such as through pandemic-\ninduced job loss), which leads to inevitable behaviors: an alcoholic consumes alcohol; an unhoused \nperson sleeps outside; an indigent person does not pay rent. \n89.  Poverty  is  a  common  condition  in  Arkansas,  particularly  during  this  global \npandemic that has led to significant job loss. Arkansas holds the ignoble distinction of ranking \n47th in the nation for poverty; in 2020, 16.2% of Arkansans lived below the federal poverty line.32 \n                                                 \n32 Talk Poverty, Overall Poverty 2020, Center for American Progress (last visited Feb. 18, 2021), \nhttps://talkpoverty.org/indicator/listing/poverty/2020. From December 2019 to December 2020, \n  21 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 22 of 35 PageID #: 23\n \nA common consequence of poverty is the inability to pay for basic necessities, including rent. In \nAugust 2021, more than 19% of renting households in Arkansas (representing more than 80,000 \nhouseholds) were behind on rent.33 Of those households, more than 37% believed themselves to \nbe strongly or somewhat liked to be evicted in the next two months.34 Indigence is thus a common \nstatus in Arkansas that frequently leads to inability to pay rent.  \n90.  Like criminalizing homelessness or vagrancy, criminalizing failure to pay rent is a \nway  to  criminalize  poverty  and  is  thus  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  in  violation  of  the \nConstitution. See Powell, 392 U.S. at 551 (White, J., concurring) (making connection between \nhomelessness and poverty and concluding that a law criminalizing public drunkenness would be \nunconstitutional if the law targeted unhoused alcoholics, who cannot avoid public places just as \nthey cannot avoid drinking); Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 (โjust as the state may not criminalize the \nstate of being โhomeless in public places,โ the state may not โcriminalize conduct that is an \nunavoidable consequence of being homeless โ namely sitting, lying, or sleeping on the streets.โโ); \nWheeler v. Goodman, 306 F.Supp.58, 62 (W.D.N.C.1969) vacated on other grounds, 401 U.S. \n987, (1971) (striking down vagrancy statute making it a crime to, inter alia, be able to work but \nhave no property or โvisible and known meansโ of earning a livelihood because to โmake poverty \nand misfortune criminal is contrary to our fundamental beliefs, and to arrest and prosecute a person \nunder this statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment.โ). \n                                                 \nthe unemployment rate in Arkansas also increased from 3.5% to 4.2%.

That the Criminal Eviction Statute is a two-part scheme, involving first non-\npayment of rent and then the renterโs remaining on the property following notice by the landlord, \ndoes not change the analysis because it still โeffectively criminalizesโ poverty. Manning, 930 F.3d \nat 283 (rejecting argument that Virginiaโs โtwo-pronged statutory scheme,โ which permitted courts \nto first enter a civil interdiction order to prohibit the sale of alcohol to โhabitual drunkardsโ and \nthen made it a crime for that interdicted person to possess or consume alcohol, changed analysis \nthat statute unconstitutionally criminalized alcoholism).  \n92.  That Arkansas is the only state that criminalizes poverty via failure to pay rent only \nstrengthens the cruel and unusual nature of the Criminal Eviction Statute. See Trop v. Dulles, 356 \nU.S. 86, 100โ01 (1958) (explaining that because โthe words of the [Eighth] Amendment are not \npreciseโ and โtheir scope is not static[,] [t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing societyโ). \n93.  Arkansasโ criminalization of indigent Arkansansโ inability to pay rent via the \nCriminal Eviction Statute violates the Eighth Amendment as status-based punishment. \ne.  The Criminal Eviction Statute Allows for Unconstitutional Excessive \nFines \n \n94.  The Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment is incorporated against the \nstates. Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S.Ct. 682 (2019). \n95.  The daily fines charged as punishment for violation of Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction \nStatute are excessive and therefore unconstitutional. The fines are excessive because they are \ngrossly disproportionate to the gravity of the alleged underlying criminal behavior and they are \nimposed without consideration of a tenantโs ability to pay. \n96.  These fines are grossly disproportionate. The underlying alleged criminal behavior \nis failure to pay rent, even when that failure to pay rent is non-willful. Failure to pay rent is \n  23 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 24 of 35 PageID #: 25\n \ntraditionally a civil offense; it is a civil offense in every state including Arkansas, though Arkansas \nis the only state that chooses to also criminalize the act. To impose criminal fines on what is \nessentially a private and civil landlord-tenant contract dispute is grossly disproportionate.  \n97.  Furthermore, the underlying alleged criminal behavior of failure to pay rent raises \ngrave constitutional concerns regarding due process and equal protection and does not take into \nconsideration whether non-payment is willful, resulting in a law that criminalizes the status of \npoverty. โAny fine,โ like those imposed here, โis excessive if it is imposed on the basis of status \nand not conduct.โ Blake, 2020 WL 4209227, at *11 (holding fines imposed as part of law banning \nโcampingโ within city limits violated Excessive Fines Clause because โthe conduct for which \n[plaintiffs] face punishment is inseparable from their status as homeless individuals, and therefore, \nbeyond what the City may constitutionally punishโ). These fines are imposed on the basis of \nPlaintiffsโ poverty status; to impose fines on top of a sentence that is itself unconstitutional is \ngrossly disproportionate in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause. \n98.  These fines are also grossly disproportionate because the tenant has no control over \nthe total amount of the fees that she will be assessed and the judge has discretion to apply fees of \nan enormous range, from $1 to $25 per day.35 In just a matter of one week, that fine can range \nfrom $7 to $175. These fines may even, depending on the course of the case, be equal to or more \nthan what is alleged to be owed in back rent, contributing to the disproportionality of the fine. If, \nfor example, a case were to take 30 days to resolve, then the tenant could face up to $750 in fines, \n                                                 \n35 As a comparison point, minimum wage in Arkansas is $11.00/hour, meaning that the daily fines \na court can impose under the Criminal Eviction Statute are the equivalent of more than ยผ of a \nminimum-wage workerโs daily earnings, pre-tax (assuming an 8-hour work day). Ark. Depโt of \nLabor  &  Licensing,  Minimum  Wage  and  Overtime, \nhttps://www.labor.arkansas.gov/divisions/labor-standards/minimum-wage-and-overtime/  (last \nviewed Feb. 9, 2021). \n  24 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 25 of 35 PageID #: 26\n \nwhich is equivalent to the median gross rent across the state of Arkansas.36 It is also, ironically, \nabout the cost to a landlord to pursue a civil eviction through the unlawful detainer method.37 \n99.  Defendantsโ enforcement of the Criminal Eviction Statute essentially creates a \nsystem where it is okay to impose costs on tenants, who already cannot afford rent, but not okay \nto impose costs on landlords.  \n100.  When the renter is faced with the choice to either (1) remain in her home and \npossibly face criminal charges and fines or (2) abandon her home without due process, to charge \na renter these excessive fines is to inflict โpunishment [that] is more criminal than the crime.โ Mills \nv. City of Grand Forks, 614 F.3d 495, 501 (8th Cir. 2010). Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley \nhave chosen option one and remained in their home under the constant stress and threat of criminal \nprosecution because abandoning their home without due process would mean homelessness. \n101.  The failure to consider a personโs ability to pay the fine, particularly given that the \nunderlying criminal act concerns the personโs ability to pay rent, also makes the fine excessive and \nunconstitutional. When a renter cannot afford rent and their poverty is the basis for the criminal \nconviction, imposing additional fines โ the amount of which the renter has no control over โ is \nexcessive. Cf. Timbs, 139 S.Ct. at 688 (taking no position on the question whether a personโs \nincome and wealth are relevant considerations in judging the excessiveness of a fine); U.S. v. \nBajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 340, n. 15 (1998) (same). \n102.  Criminalizing  evictions  is  also  constitutionally  excessive  because  it  does  not \nadvance the stateโs legitimate interests and therefore has no rational basis. Failing to vacate \n                                                 \n36 From 2015โ2019, the median gross rent across the state of Arkansas was $745. U.S. Census \nBureau,  Arkansas  QuickFacts  as  of  July  1,  2019  (last  visited  Aug.  31,  2021), \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/AR. \n37 When Not Paying Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3.  \n  25 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 26 of 35 PageID #: 27\n \ninvolves a private contractual dispute that does not belong in the criminal system and Arkansas \nalready has multiple civil remedies to evict non-paying tenants. These civil proceedings serve \nprecisely the same ends as the failure to vacate statute, except without the stigma and irreversible \nconsequences of a criminal conviction. See Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 47โ48 (1972) \n(Powell, J., concurring) (โThe consequences of a misdemeanor conviction, whether they be a brief \nperiod served under the sometimes deplorable conditions found in local jails or the effect of a \ncriminal record on employability, are frequently of sufficient magnitude not to be casually \ndismissed by the label โpetty.โโ) (quotations and citations omitted).38 What is more, the civil \neviction remedies actually provide for eviction, whereas the Criminal Eviction Statute does not \ninclude that remedy. It is used to scare tenants into self-evicting. There is no rational basis or \nlegitimate interest in pushing Arkansans into homelessness and poverty, particularly when other \navenues are available to effectuate the relief that landlords seek. \n103.  The likelihood of fines being assessed is very high. Cases under the Criminal \nEviction Statute are regularly prosecuted and nearly 1 in 5 renting households in Arkansas are \nbehind on rent,39 making them a target for prosecution. Duffner v. City of St. Peters, Missouri, 930 \nF.3d 973, 977 (8th Cir. 2019).40 \n104.  By requiring grossly disproportionate fines that are imposed without an ability to \npay determination, the Criminal Eviction Statute violates the Excessive Fines Clause. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n                                                 \n38 Even if a renter is never convicted, the renter can still have a criminal record if they are arrested \nand  booked,  with  the  same  collateral  consequences  as  a  conviction  in  terms  of  housing, \nemployment, etc. When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n39 Pulse Survey Aug. 4โ16, supra note 33. \n40 Tenants facing charges under the Criminal Eviction Statute, should they wish to be represented \nby a public defender, also have to pay a public defender fee if they qualify, compounding the \nfinancial burden of this criminal scheme.  \n  26 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 27 of 35 PageID #: 28\n \n105.

Between 2018 and  October 2020, 1,050 criminal eviction cases were heard in \nArkansas courts.41 Between mid-March and October 2020, more than 200 criminal eviction cases \nwere filed statewide.42 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention September 4, 2020 \norder (reissued most recently in August 2021) enacting a national moratorium on evictions is \nignored in Arkansas; between September 4, 2020 and October 26, 2020 alone, at least 24 new \ncases were filed.43 An additional 24 cases were filed in December 2020.44 At least three dozen \n                                                 \n41 When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n42 Id. \n43 Id. \n44 December 2020 Eviction Report, supra note 2. \n  27 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 28 of 35 PageID #: 29\n \ncases were filed between January and mid-March 2021.45 \n111.

Code ยง 18-16-101 and an as-applied challenge; in both cases, this Class \nAction asks whether enforcement of Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 violates the rights of the Class \nMembers. The relief sought is the same for all Class Members: a permanent injunction and \ndeclaration against its enforcement so as to protect the constitutional rights of Class Members now \nand in the future. \n116.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class Members, as they all arise \nfrom one statute: Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101. Defendants apply the Criminal Eviction Statute in \nmaterially the same manner every day.  The material components of the scheme do not vary from \nClass Member to Class Member, and the resolution of these legal and factual issues will determine \nwhether all Class Members are entitled to the relief they seek. \n117.  Among the most important, but not the only, common questions of fact are:  \nโข  Does Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 allow for the criminal prosecution of a tenant \nwho cannot afford their rent, without verification of a landlordโs allegations \nregarding rent arrears and without a cap on the number of charges and \nassociated fines? \nโข  Does Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 allow for criminal prosecution of a renter \nwithout conducting an ability to pay inquiry? \nโข  Do Defendants treat renters who can and cannot afford rent differently, \nsubjecting the latter to threats of arrest, incarceration, and prosecution \nbecause of their inability to afford rent? \nโข  Do Defendants criminalize rentersโ poverty status? \nโข  Do Defendants fine, for any dollar amount, renters because they cannot \nafford rent?  \n \n118.  Among the most important common question of law are: \nโข  Does the Due Process Clause prohibit criminal charges to be brought for \nfailure to pay rent, with no cap on the number of charges and associated \nfines? \n  29 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 30 of 35 PageID #: 31\n \nโข  Does the Due Process Clause prohibit the government from punishing \nsomeone for nonpayment of rent without any ability-to-pay inquiry? \nโข  Does  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibit  the  government  from \ncriminalizing a personโs inability to afford rent? \nโข  Does the Eighth Amendment prohibit the government from criminalizing a \nrenterโs poverty status? \nโข  Does the Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment prohibit the \ncharging of daily fines for criminal evictions? \n \nC.  Typicality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n119.  The named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the other Class Membersโ claims, and \nthey have the same interests in this case as all other Class Members.  Each Class Member is \ncurrently being criminally prosecuted or is at risk of criminal prosecution because she cannot \nafford to pay rent and the fees associated with failure to vacate under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101. The \nanswer to whether Defendantsโ wealth-based criminal eviction scheme is unconstitutional will \ndetermine the claims of the named Plaintiffs and every other Class Member. \n120.  If the named Plaintiffs succeed in the claim that Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 violates \ntheir constitutional rights, that ruling will likewise benefit every other Class Member. \nD.  Adequacy โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n121.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  adequate  representatives  of  the  Class  because  their \ninterests in the vindication of the legal claims that they raise are entirely aligned with the interests \nof the other Class Members, who each have the same basic constitutional claims.  They are \nmembers of the Class, and their interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the \nother Class Members. \n122.  There are no known conflicts of interest among Class Members, all of whom have \na similar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights that Defendants have violated. \n123.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Equal Justice Under Law and Professor \nAmy Pritchard of the Bowen Legal Clinic at the University of Arkansas Little Rock, all of whom \n  30 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 31 of 35 PageID #: 32\n \nhave experience in litigating complex civil rights matters in federal court and extensive knowledge \nof both the details of how Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction Statute works in practice and the relevant \nconstitutional and statutory law. Class counsel also have a detailed understanding of state law and \npractices as they relate to federal constitutional requirements. \n124.  Counsel have devoted significant time and resources becoming intimately familiar \nwith how Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction Statute works in practice and with the relevant state and \nfederal laws.  Counsel have also developed relationships with some of the individuals and families \nvictimized by Defendantsโ practices.  The interests of the Class Members will be fairly and \nadequately protected by the Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n125.  Class action status is appropriate because Defendants have acted in the same \nunconstitutional manner with respect to all Class Members.  In enforcing Ark. Code ยง18-16-101, \nDefendants enforce a fundamental unfair wealth-based system of criminal eviction: renters who \ncan afford to pay rent are not prosecuted, while those who cannot are faced with eviction, criminal \ncharges, excessive fines, and jail time. \n126.  The Class therefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants \nfrom filing and pursuing charges against Plaintiffs pursuant to Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101. Because \nthe putative Class challenges Defendantsโ scheme as unconstitutional through declaratory and \ninjunctive  relief  that  would  apply  the  same  relief  to  every  Class  Member,  Rule  23(b)(2) \ncertification is appropriate and necessary. \n127.  Injunctive relief compelling Defendants to comply with these constitutional rights \nwill similarly protect each Class Member from being subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional \ncriminal eviction scheme.  A declaration and injunction stating that Defendants cannot file charges \n  31 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 32 of 35 PageID #: 33\n \nagainst renters under Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 would provide relief to every Class Member.  \nTherefore, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Class as a whole is appropriate. \n128.  Plaintiffs seek the following relief and hereby demand a jury in this cause for all \nmatters so appropriate. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One: Violation of Procedural Due Process \n \n129.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthis Complaint. \n130.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by (1) allowing criminal \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 solely on the basis of a landlordโs affidavit and \n(2) by having no cap on the number of criminal charges or excessive fines that can be imposed. \nNo other civil debt incurs criminal charges. Landlords also have access to two civil eviction \nremedies. By forcing tenants to either self-evict or face numerous criminal charges and fines โ \neven if landlords are lying and even when landlords have access to a civil system โ Defendantsโ \ncriminal eviction scheme tips the scales of justice too far in landlordsโ favor in violation of due \nprocess. \nCount Two: Violation of Procedural Due Process Regarding Ability to Pay \n \n131.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthis Complaint. \n132.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Procedural Due Process Clause prohibits outcomes \nin the criminal legal system from turning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment. \n133.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by allowing criminal \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 without considering a renterโs ability to pay. \n  32 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 33 of 35 PageID #: 34\n \nA tenant who cannot afford rent has no means to raise indigence as a defense in Criminal Eviction \nStatute proceedings.  \n134.  Without  considering  ability  to  pay,  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute  effectively \ncriminalizes poverty. \n135.  The imposition of daily fines without an ability-to-pay assessment as part of the \ncriminal sentence further criminalizes poverty and further violates the procedural due process \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n136.  Due  process  requires  that  Defendants  conduct  pre-deprivation  ability-to-pay \nhearings. \nCount Three: Violation of Equal Protection, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n \n137.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthe Complaint. \n138.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Equal Protection Clause also prohibits outcomes in \nthe criminal legal system from turning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment.  \n139.  The  Criminal  Eviction  statuteโs  lack  of  a  willfulness  standard  creates  an \nunconstitutional double-standard that violates Equal Protection because it results in similarly-\nsituated tenants being treated differently, with the only difference being how much money the \ntenant has. A rich tenant will only be prosecuted if their non-payment of rent is willful; a poor \ntenant will be prosecuted even if their non-payment of rent is involuntarily. This wealth-based \ndiscrimination is prohibited by the Equal Protection clause. \nCount Four: Criminalization of Status \n140.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthe Complaint. \n  33 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 34 of 35 PageID #: 35\n \n141.  Defendantsโ criminalization of indigent Arkansansโ inability to pay rent via the \nCriminal Eviction Statute violates the Eighth Amendment as (poverty) status-based punishment. \nThere is no iteration of the law that would eliminate this cruel and unusual punishment as it is \ninherent to the structure of criminalizing failure to pay rent, which is only ever weaponized against \nthose who are unable to pay. \nCount Five: Excessive Fines \n \n142.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthe Complaint. \n143.  The Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment is incorporated against the \nstates. Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S.Ct. 682 (2019). \n144.  The daily fines charged as punishment for violation of Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction \nStatute are excessive and therefore unconstitutional. The fines are excessive because they are \ngrossly disproportionate to the gravity of the alleged underlying criminal behavior and they do not \ntake into consideration a tenantโs ability to pay. No rational basis supports the imposition of fines \nas they do not advance any legitimate state interest given that two civil eviction remedies exist to \naddress contractual disputes between landlords and tenants, including alleged non-payment of rent. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n      WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the other Class Members request that this Court issue \nthe following relief: \na.  A declaratory judgment that Defendants violate the named Plaintiffsโ and Class \nMembersโ  constitutional  rights  by  threatening  them  with  arrest,  criminal \nconvictions, excessive fines, and jail time solely because they cannot make a \nmonetary payment on a civil debt; \n \nb.  An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants from \nenforcing Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101; \n \n  34 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 35 of 35 PageID #: 36\n \nc.  A declaratory judgment declaring that Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 is unconstitutional \nand therefore unenforceable;  \n \nd.

I am over the age of 18, and I am a resident of Arkansas. \n2.  In March 2019, my husband, Terry Easley, and I moved into   in Malvern, \nArkansas. We signed a month-to-month lease with Brenda and Joel Clegg and their daughter \nKimberly Matlock for $400/month. \n3.  In August 2020, our landlord replaced the water tank in our home and it immediately stopped \nworking. We no longer had running water. \n4.  Because our house lacked running water, we had to start buying water for all of our needs, \nwhich costs us $300-500/month. \n5.  Also because of the lack of running water in our house, we had to start doing laundry at a \nlaundromat, which costs us around $15 for each trip. My husband and I both have disabilities \nand use power wheelchairs to get around, so instead of being able to do laundry at home, we \nnow go twelve blocks each way in our power wheelchairs to get laundry done. \n6.  A friend of ours has been kind enough to let us shower at her place. \n7.  In October 2020, we began renting a porta-potty, which costs us about $100/month. \n8.  In October 2020, the Arkansas Department of Health came out to our home to inspect the \ndamage  from  the  water tank.  The  inspector determined that there  were  plumbing code \nviolations and inadequacies that were potential hazards to the health, safety, and property of \nthe residence and the public. He gave our landlord seven days to make repairs, but our landlord \ndidn't make repairs. \n9.  In  November 2020,  the  Arkansas  Department  of Health  condemned our home's  water \ndistribution  system  and  water  heater  installation  and  ordered  the  water  service  to  be \nterminated. \n10. Our rent was waived in November 2020 because we had no running water. \n11. Up until then, we had always paid our rent, but in December 2020, we stopped paying rent \nbecause we could no longer afford to pay rent with the new expenses we had because we had \nno running water. \n12. My husband  and  I are  both in our sixties  and have disabilities.  In addition to  needing \nwheelchairs for mobility, we both have multiple chronic health conditions, including diabetes \nfor me and asthma for my husband. \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2-1     Filed 09/02/21   Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 38\n13. Our only source of income is social security disability income, which amounts to less than \n$1,200/month between the two of us. \n14. The costs associated with adapting to not having running water in our home-the porta-potty \n($100/month), buying water ($300-500/month), having to use a laundromat to do our laundry \n(around $15 for each trip) - adds up to more than we were paying in rent. There is no way \nwe could have afforded to continue paying rent plus all of these new expenses, because we \nwould have almost nothing left over for our other necessary expenses. \n15. We pay approximately $250/month for our electric bill. \n16. We also have two service/emotional support dogs, who require food and veterinarian bills. \n17. I pay $4/month for my diabetes medication. \n18. When we need rides for non-medical appointments, we also have to pay $2/ride through \nMedicare (SCAT bus). \n19. According to our landlord, we owe somewhere between $2,000-$3,200 in back rent. \n20. To this day, we still do not have running water in our home. \n21. In April 2021, Captain Baker of the Sheriffs Office of Hot Spring County (where Malvern is \nlocated) came to our home and served us with a failure to vacate eviction notice, which stated \nthat we had 10 days to move out of our home or else we would be charged under Arkansas \nCode ยง18-16-101 (the failure to vacate, or criminal eviction, statute). The notice stated that \nthe reasons for our eviction were failure to pay rent and noncompliance with the rental \nagreement. \n22. Ever since we received the notice, we have been looking for another place to live, but it has \nso far been impossible to find a place that meets our needs. \n23. Days after receiving the notice, we  also signed a CDC eviction moratorium declaration \nbecause we qualify for the moratorium. \n24. It has been very stressful for us being threatened with criminal prosecution and having to \nsearch for a new home without knowing if we will find something that accommodates our \ndisabilities and is something we can afford. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the statements above are true and correct. Executed on this \n~ day of August, 2021, in Malvern, Arkansas. \n~~ \nCynthia Eas  y \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2-2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 1 of 1 PageID #: 39",

Plaintiffs allege that Arkansas Code Annotated ยง 18-16-101, or the โMunicipal \nEviction Statute,โ is unconstitutional on its face, claiming that the statute violates the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \nthe Eighth Amendmentโs prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, and the Excessive \nFines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.   \n2.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Plaintiffsโ Compliant should \nbe dismissed with prejudice. \n3.  History demonstrates that the Municipal Eviction Statutes is constitutional.  The \nArkansas Supreme Court has upheld the Municipal Eviction Statute on multiple occasions.  \nMoreover, the version of the Municipal Eviction Statute declared unconstitutional by a handful of \n1 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 13     Filed 11/08/21   Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 54\nArkansas trial courts (and relied upon by Plaintiffs) has been legislatively amended to the identical \nversions previously upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court.  \n4.  The Municipal Eviction Statute does not criminalize poverty and is not a cruel and \nunusual punishment.  In reality, the Municipal Eviction Statute only criminalizes an individualโs \nretention of private property in defiance of the ownerโs right of possession.  Plaintiffs have failed \nto meet the heavy burden of a facial challengeโestablishing that the Municipal Eviction Statute \nis not constitutional under any circumstances. \n5.  The Municipal Eviction Statute is not an unconstitutional use of the stateโs police \npower.  The State of Arkansas has a significant interest in protecting the private property rights of \nits citizens.  Plaintiffsโ argument that the Municipal Eviction Statute is not rationally related to a \nlegitimate government objective fails, and Plaintiffs have not met the heavy burden associated with \na facial challenge to the statute. \n6.  The Municipal Eviction Statute does not violate Plaintiffsโ procedural due process \nrights.  Plaintiffs make no argument that the Municipal Eviction Statute itself is unconstitutionally \nvague โ only that an eviction notice served pursuant to the statute may be vague.  But even if some \neviction notices do not provide certain information, it does not make the Municipal Eviction \nStatute facially unconstitutional because a hearing may still be had.  The possibility that a property \nowner may lie to establish an eviction is of no moment either.  If that occurs, there are other \nremedies in the law that are less drastic than declaring a statute unconstitutional.  Likewise, the \nMunicipal Eviction Statute does not violate Plaintiffsโ procedural due process rights by having no \ncap on charges or fines or by not considering Plaintiffsโ ability to pay. \n7.  The Municipal Eviction Statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause \nbecause all tenants are similarly situated and treated alike under the statute.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 13     Filed 11/08/21   Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 55\n8.  The Municipal Eviction Statute does not impose excessive fines because  the \nmaximum fine is admittedly the equivalent to the median gross rent across the state of Arkansas.   \n9.  Plaintiffsโ  Complaint  lacks  a  justiciable  case  or  controversy.    Plaintiffs  lack \nstanding and their claims are moot.  Moreover, the Complaint lacks adversity.    \n10.  When addressing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the rule is that a court must ignore matters \noutside the pleadings.  Porous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp., 186 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.1999).  \nThe only exceptions are for (1) materials that are necessarily embraced by the complaint, and (2) \nmaterials that are part of the public record.

Arkansas is the only state in the United States that criminalizes the failure to pay \n  1 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 2 of 35 PageID #: 3\n \nrent.1  \n2.  Failure to pay rent is traditionally approached as a civil matter, handled in landlord-\ntenant court. Landlords can pursue evictions for non-paying tenants in landlord-tenant court. \nIndeed, Arkansas has two civil eviction processes. Landlords can pursue an unlawful detainer \neviction (the most common form of eviction) under Ark. Code ยง 18-60-307 or, in some places, \nwhat is known as a 2007 Act eviction under Ark. Code ยง 18-17-901. Landlords are successful in \nsecuring evictions via these civil methods and routinely have the upper hand in these proceedings, \nsince, for example, they almost always have a lawyer to represent them in unlawful detainer cases, \nwhereas tenants do not.2 \n3.  Arkansas is the only state that offers landlords the option of a criminal process in \naddition to civil remedies, turning a civil debt into a criminal offense. Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 (the \nโCriminal Eviction Statuteโ) allows criminal charges to be brought against a tenant if three \nelements are met: (1) a landlord alleges that a tenant is behind on rent (regardless if the tenantโs \nfailure to pay is willful and regardless if the landlord is truthful), (2) the landlord notifies the tenant \nin writing that she must leave her home because she is behind on rent, and (3) the tenant โwillfully \nand unnecessarilyโ remains at home more than ten days after receiving written notice.   \n4.  Every day beyond the 10-day notice period that a tenant remains at home โ even \n                                                 \n1 Human Rights Watch, Pay the Rent or Face Arrest: Abusive Impacts of Arkansasโ Draconian \nEvictions Law 1 (Feb. 2013), https://www.hrw.org/reports/us0113arkansas_reportcover_web.pdf \n[hereinafter Pay the Rent or Face Arrest]; Ark. Gen. Assembly Non-Legis. Commโn For the Study \nof Landlord-Tenant Laws Report at 17 (2012), reprinted in 35 U. Ark. Little Rock L. Rev. 739 \n(2013) [hereinafter Landlord-Tenant Laws Report]; Duhon v. State, 299 Ark. 503, 512 (1989) \n(Purtle, dissenting) (โArkansas has won another distinction: it is the only state in the nation which \nimposes criminal sanctions on a person who does not pay his rent on time.โ). \n2 Lynn Foster, Arkansas Eviction Report December 2020, Arkansans for Stronger Communities \n(Jan. 13, 2021), https://www.arkstrongcommunities.com/december-eviction-report/ (last visited \nAug. 26, 2021) [hereafter December 2020 Eviction Report]. \n  2 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 3 of 35 PageID #: 4\n \nif the tenantโs failure to pay rent is non-willful โ is considered a separate criminal offense, subject \nto excessive fines of up to $25 per offense. Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101(b).  \n5.  There is no cap on how many criminal offenses or excessive fines a tenant may \nface.  Id.  \n6.  In practice, private landlords use this law to force tenants to self-evict. According \nto State Representative and landlord Richard McGrew, โThis law is really just used to get [tenants] \nout of the apartmentโฆwe just want them out of our apartment so we can re-rent it.โ3 Terry Schug, \nGreene County Landlord Association president, justifies the law as landlords โneed[ing] a good \nway to evict people.โ4 \n7.  The self-eviction strategy is effective, as a landlord threatening to call the sheriff to \narrest tenants for being behind on rent causes tenants to abandon their homes just to avoid the \npossibility of criminal prosecution.5 \n8.  Tenants  who  do  not  self-evict  and  go  to  court  โ  who  are  almost  always \nunrepresented โ can be met with judges who tell them to move out or else be jailed for contempt \nof court.  \n9.  In practice, tenants are not given the opportunity to present defenses in Criminal \nEviction Statute proceedings โ as they are in civil landlord-tenant court โ and are not given the \nopportunity to make up for alleged due rent. Cf. Munson v. Gilliam, 543 F.2d 48, 53 (8th Cir. \n1976). If a tenant offers funds to cover a portion or all of the alleged due rent, judges will routinely \ntell the tenant that it is the landlordโs decision whether to accept the funds. Most landlords will \n                                                 \n3 Maya Miller and Ellis Simani, When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, ProPublica (Oct. \n26,  2020),  https://www.propublica.org/article/when-falling-behind-on-rent-leads-to-jail-time \n[hereinafter When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time] \n4 Id. \n5 Id. \n  3 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 4 of 35 PageID #: 5\n \nrefuse the funds, preferring instead that the tenant leave the property. \n10.  Supporters  of  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute  include  landlords  attempting  to \ncircumvent the expense associated with pursuing an eviction through civil landlord-tenant court. \nAccording to Hot Springs Landlord Association President Steve Webster, landlords support the \nCriminal Eviction Statute because they want โa simple, easy to use law thatโs inexpensive.โ6 The \nArkansas Realtors Association supports the criminal eviction process because it is โless costlyโ to \nlandlords than the civil eviction process7 because landlords must cover their own attorneysโ fees \nin civil cases, whereas in criminal evictions, the taxpayer foots the bill, as the publicly-funded \nprosecutor assumes that attorney role.8 In testifying before the Arkansas House Insurance and \nCommerce Committee on April 5, 2021 on HB1798, an unsuccessful bill to repeal the Criminal \nEviction Statute, William Jones, President of the Landlords Association of Arkansas, expressed \nhis support for the law because โit does not require an attorney which saves me (landlords) a \nconsiderable amount of money.โ9 \n11.  Landlordsโ professed desire for a โcheaperโ system to evict tenants โ by shifting \nthe financial burden of evictions from landlords in civil evictions to taxpayers in criminal evictions \n                                                 \n6 When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n7 Id. \n8 A Deputy Prosecutor Was Fired for Speaking Out Against Jail Time for People Who Fall Behind \non Rent, ProPublica (Nov. 27, 2020), https://www.propublica.org/article/a-state-prosecutor-was-\nfired-for-speaking-out-against-jail-time-for-people-who-fall-behind-on-rent  [hereinafter \nProsecutor Fired for Speaking Out] (โLandlords told ProPublica they preferred the criminal statute \nto civil evictions because the criminal process is cheaper. Taxpayers shoulder the cost when county \nattorneys . . . pursue tenants. In civil eviction hearings, landlords have to cover their attorney \nfees.โ).  \n9 House Insurance and Commerce Committee Hearing to Debate HB 1798, bill to repeal Criminal \nEviction  Statute,  on  April  5,  2021.

In the words of State Representative Jimmy Gazaway, the Criminal Eviction Statute \nis โan abuse of the criminal processโ10; it uses the โcoercive power of the criminal process and the \ncoercive power of the state to essentially evict someone on a civil debt or a civil contract.โ11 The \nscales of justice are tipped too far in favor of landlords looking for a cheap workaround from tenant \nprotections, all at the expense of tenants who are struggling to afford rent.  \n13.  Legislative efforts have so far been unsuccessful, as many state legislators are \nthemselves landlords and have voted down measures to repeal the law, prioritizing their personal \ngain over their duty to protect their constituents.12 \n14.  In the midst of an ongoing global pandemic and despite a national moratorium on \nevictions, Defendants continue to evict vulnerable residents by allowing private landlords to co-\nopt the criminal legal system to do their bidding, turning publicly-funded police and courts into \nlandlordsโ private debt collectors and creating debtorsโ prisons.13  \n                                                 \n10 Issues That Matter: Rentersโ Rights and Habitability Online Forum hosted by League of Women \nVoters  of  Pulaski  County  and  KUAR,  on  Aug.  19,  2021.

Arkansas has always known that this law creates debtorsโ prisons and yet has \npersisted in upholding it for 120 years.14 The Criminal Eviction Statute was introduced during a \ndark time in Arkansasโ history; an Arkansas State Senator who opposed the law pointed out that \nโwe all know what is done to a poor man in this state who cannot pay his fine. He is sent to jail \nand compelled to work it out,โ referring to convict leasing, which was still legal at the time of the \nlawโs passing.15  Convict leasing was created as a direct response to the passage of the 13th \nAmendment, which abolished slavery โexcept as a punishment for crimeโ; with convict leasing, \nwhite Americans could still extract free labor from and maintain control over Black Americans.16  \n16.  Echoing  the  racist  and  classist  origins  of  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute,  the \nvulnerable residents that Arkansas targets with this law remain disproportionately Black and low-\n                                                 \nsystem-drives-poverty-mass-incarceration/ (last visited January 27, 2021) [hereinafter Too Poor \nto Pay]; When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n14 Lynn Foster, The Hands of the State: The Failure to Vacate Statute and Residential Tenantsโ \nRights in Arkansas, 36 Univ. of Ark. at Little Rock L.

In the words of \nstate Representative Gazaway, who is also a rental property owner, โItโs incredibly sad for our \nstate. . . .

Plaintiffs Were Served with a Failure to Vacate Eviction Notice Under Ark. \nCode ยง 18-16-101 Because They Cannot Afford to Pay Rent \n \n28.  Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley moved into their current home in Malvern, \nArkansas in March 2019. They signed a month-to-month lease with their landlord for $400/month. \n29.  In August 2020, their landlord replaced the water tank and it immediately stopped \nworking.  \n30.  Since August 2020, Mr. and Mrs. Easley have not had running water. \n31.  In November 2020, following an on-site inspection, the Arkansas Department of \nHealth condemned their homeโs water distribution system and water heater installation and ordered \nthe water service (which had not been working since August 2020) to be terminated until the \nlandlord made necessary repairs, which, to this day, the landlord has not done. \n32.  Mr. and Mrs. Easleyโs November 2020 rent was waived due to the lack of running \nwater, but they have been charged rent since December 2020. \n33.  Mr. and Mrs. Easley stopped paying rent in December 2020 because they could no \n  9 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 10 of 35 PageID #: 11\n \nlonger afford to pay rent plus the new expenses they had acquired to compensate for their lack of \nrunning water. \n34.  Both Mr. and Mrs. Easley have disabilities and chronic health conditions. They use \npower wheelchairs. Their combined income is less than $1,200/month in social security disability \npayments. \n35.  As a result of not having running water, Mr. and Mrs. Easley started showering at \na friendโs house. They have had to rent a porta potty (about $100/month), buy water (about $300โ\n500/month) and go to a laundromat via wheelchair to do laundry (about $15/trip). These new \nexpenses incurred because of not having running water add up to more than Mr. and Mrs. Easleyโs \nrent. \n36.  Mr. and Mrs. Easley also have other necessary expenses, including their electric \nbill, food, medicine,  transportation, and food and veterinarian bills for their service/emotional \nsupport dogs. \n37.  In April 2021, Captain Baker of the Sheriffโs Office of Hot Spring County served \nPlaintiffs with a failure to vacate eviction notice, which stated that they had ten days to move out \nor they would be charged under Arkansas Code ยง18-16-101 (the criminal eviction, or failure to \nvacate, statute). The notice stated that the reasons for the eviction were failure to pay rent and \nnoncompliance with the rental agreement. \n38.  Plaintiffs never had an opportunity prior to receiving this notice to contest the \nnoticeโs claims in court and to date, Plaintiffs have not had a court hearing. \n39.  Since  receiving  the  notice,  Plaintiffs  signed  a  CDC  eviction  moratorium \ndeclaration, for which they qualify. \n40.  Since receiving the notice, Plaintiffs have also searched for other housing, but so \n  10 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 11 of 35 PageID #: 12\n \nfar it has been impossible to find something that meets their needs and is something that they can \nafford. They continue to live in their home โ without running water โ in the meantime. \n41.  The  Malvern/Hot  Spring  Prosecuting  Attorney  prosecutes  tenants  under  the \nCriminal Eviction Statute. \n42.  Criminal eviction cases are brought in Hot Spring County District Court. The Hot \nSpring District Court is a county-level court with jurisdiction to hear misdemeanor criminal cases \nwhen the alleged conduct occurred within Hot Spring County. The Hot Spring District Court is \nnot a court of record. \nB.  Arkansas Is the Only State that Criminalizes the Eviction Process \n \n46.  As it stands today, Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 (the โCriminal Eviction Statuteโ) allows \nthe landlord of a tenant who is late on rent โ even by one day โ to order the tenant to vacate the \npremises.20 If the tenant fails to leave within 10 days, the tenant is guilty of a misdemeanor offense \nfor each day she fails to vacate the premises following the expiration of the 10-day notice. Ark. \nCode ยง 18-16-101(b)(1). For each day she fails to vacate the premises following the expiration of \nthe 10-day notice, the tenant must also pay a fine of $1โ$25. Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101(b)(2).  \n47.  The Criminal Eviction Statute includes no cap on the number of convictions and \namount of fines to which a tenant can be subjected. Without a cap, and given that the fines are paid \nto the state, Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction Statute creates a perverse incentive for Defendants to \nallow fines to accumulate โ by delaying hearings, for example โ so as to extort as much as they \npossibly can from renters. \n48.  The Criminal Eviction Statute does not require that the tenantโs non-payment of \n                                                 \n20 Under Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101, being one day late on rent is enough to invalidate the entire \nlandlord-tenant contract and forfeit the tenantโs property interest, without any due process. \n  11 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 12 of 35 PageID #: 13\n \nrent be willful. The result of this absence of a mens rea component is that tenants can be and are \nprosecuted simply because they cannot afford rent, i.e., their non-payment of rent is not willful. \n49.  A landlordโs statement is all that is necessary to trigger the criminal process. Under \nthe Criminal Eviction Statute, charges may be filed against a tenant solely on the grounds of a \nlandlordโs statement that (1) a tenant did not pay rent on time and (2) the tenant failed to vacate \nthe premises within the 10-day notice period. An arrest warrant or criminal summons can be issued \nto the tenant solely based on the landlordโs statement, without investigation into whether the \nlandlordโs statement is true and without an opportunity for the tenant to dispute the amount alleged \nto be in arrears or to request consideration of the tenantโs ability to pay. \n50.  Eviction through the Criminal Eviction Statute does not end the renterโs nightmare; \nlandlords who wield the criminal process to evict tenants are still free to pursue a separate civil \naction against the tenant.  \n51.  Indeed, the Criminal Eviction Statute does not actually provide for eviction; it is a \ntool to threaten tenants into self-evicting.  \n52.  Actual eviction orders are obtained through the civil system and landlords have two \noptions to pursue evictions: what is known as an unlawful detainer eviction (the most common \nform of eviction) under Ark. Code ยง 18-60-307 and what is known as a 2007 Act eviction under \nArk. Code ยง 18-17-901. \n53.  Some landlords will pursue multiple cases against tenants simultaneously. They \nwill press criminal charges under the Criminal Eviction Statute, open a civil eviction claim under \nthe unlawful detainer statute, and open a small claims court case to recoup unpaid rent. \n54.  Arkansasโ criminalization of tenant evictions lags behind the standards of decency \nof every other state in the country. Every other state in the nation treats evictions as purely civil \n  12 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 13 of 35 PageID #: 14\n \nmatters. Arkansas has a civil eviction system, yet stands alone in allowing landlords to convert an \notherwise civil landlord-tenant dispute into a criminal prosecution.21 \n55.  A bipartisan, non-legislative commission charged by the legislature in 2012 with \nexamining the Criminal Eviction Statute recommended its full repeal, including all provisions that \nremain in effect today.22 \n56.  The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (โHUDโ) \nforbids the use of the Criminal Eviction Statute in HUD-funded rental housing.23 Public housing \nproviders may only use eviction methods which HUD has determined meet the basic elements of \ndue process โ which does not include criminal evictions. 24 C.F.R. ยง 966.51. \n57.  Arkansas state courts are increasingly finding that the Criminal Eviction Statute is \nunconstitutional and, therefore, unenforceable.  See State v. Smith, Pulaski County Circuit Court \nCase No. 2014-2707 (2015); State v. Jones, Poinsett County Circuit Court Case No. 2014-389; State \nv. Bledsoe, Woodruff County Circuit Court Case No. 2014-77-2. These decisions invalidated the \nstatute in its entirety, including the provisions that remain in effect today. These decisions have \nreduced the number of prosecutions under the Criminal Eviction Statute across Arkansas, such that \nprosecutions are now brought only in a few jurisdictions, but prosecutions continue, even during \nthe pandemic.24 \nC.  Arkansasโ Wealth-Based Criminal Eviction Scheme Advances No Legitimate \nState Interest and Is Irrational; Any State Interest in Ensuring Rent Is Paid Cannot \nLawfully Be Satisfied Through Criminal Convictions and Excessive Fines \n \n                                                 \n21 See supra note 1. \n22 Landlord-Tenant Laws Report, supra note 1. \n23 Id. at 16. \n24 Between 2018 and October 2020, 1,050 criminal eviction cases were heard in Arkansas courts. \nWhen Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. From January through mid-March \n2021, at least three dozen people have been charged under the Criminal Eviction Statute. Only One \nState, supra note 12. \n  13 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 14 of 35 PageID #: 15\n \n58.  Defendants prosecute, jail, and fine tenants as punishment for tenantsโ non-willful \nfailure to pay rent. Punishing people for failing to make payments that they cannot afford is wealth-\nbased discrimination that violates due process, equal protection, and the Eighth Amendmentโs \nprohibition on criminalization of status.  \n59.  Defendants also impose excessive fines in violation of the Eighth Amendment that \nare grossly disproportionate to the underlying crime and are imposed without consideration of a \ntenantโs ability to pay.  \n60.  Defendantsโ fundamentally unfair criminal eviction scheme is not rationally related \nto any legitimate government objective because landlords already have a civil system (with two \ntracks) to address non-payment of rent and eviction issues. The criminal eviction scheme does not \nactually authorize evictions; it simply uses the threat of criminal conviction to scare tenants into \nself-evicting. \n61.  The scheme is further irrational in imposing excessive fines on tenants who already \ncannot  afford  rent  and  saddling  them  with  criminal  records  that  will  make  it  additionally \nchallenging for tenants to find stable housing and employment, not to mention the psychological \ntoll of having a criminal record. \n62.  The Criminal Eviction Statute leaves many who are unlucky enough to be charged \nwith it homeless and in poverty. There is no legitimate government interest in increasing poverty \nand homelessness. \n63.  For its various constitutional violations, the Criminal Eviction Statute must be \nstruck down. \na.  Defendantsโ Use of the Criminal Process Violates Plaintiffsโ Procedural \nDue Process Rights in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment \n \n64.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by (1) allowing criminal \n  14 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 15 of 35 PageID #: 16\n \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 solely on the basis of a landlordโs statement \nand (2) by having no cap on the number of criminal charges or excessive fines that can be imposed. \nLandlords also have access to two civil eviction remedies. By forcing tenants to either self-evict \nor face numerous criminal charges and fines โ even if landlords are lying and even when landlords \nhave access to a civil system โ Defendantsโ criminal eviction scheme tips the scales of justice too \nfar in landlordsโ favor in violation of due process. \n65.  Plaintiffs have a property interest in the rental property leased. Plaintiffs also have \na liberty interest in not being incarcerated. \n66.  Due process requires that Plaintiffs be provided a meaningful opportunity to \nchallenge any deprivation, by a state actor, of their property and liberty interests. Mathews v. \nEldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).  That meaningful opportunity includes fair notice and adequate \nstandards so that the tenant is aware of what behavior is at issue, otherwise a law can be void for \nvagueness. Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357-58 (1983); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. \n104, 108 (1972). \n67.  The Criminal Eviction Statute does not provide such a meaningful opportunity. \n68.  First, the statute does not require the landlordโs notice to the tenant, nor his \nstatement to the court, to be accurate or complete. Landlord notices often lack information as to \nwhy the tenant must vacate, how much time the tenant has to vacate, how the tenant can challenge \nthe notice to vacate, etc. According to Human Rights Watch, โ[M]any counties issue arrest \nwarrants and file criminal charges purely on the say-so of the landlord, without any further \ninvestigationโ and Human Rights Watch documented cases where landlords lied about their \ntenantsโ status and still managed to bring criminal charges against them.25 \n                                                 \n25 Pay the Rent or Face Arrest, supra note 1, at 3. \n  15 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 16 of 35 PageID #: 17\n \n69.  Second, the absence of any cap on the number of charges and fines that can be \nimposed โ separate from the statute of limitations and speedy trial provision โ means that the \ntenant who remains on the property after the 10-day notice period to contest the landlordโs notice \nto vacate is at the mercy of the pace of the criminal process to determine the tenantโs total exposure. \nA tenant who wishes to present a defense has no ability to safely remain at home while doing so \nbecause potential criminal exposure increases with each day.26 \n70.  The landlord has the benefit of the entire weight of the criminal system to address \nwhat is a private business transaction between two parties who have a contractual dispute. Being \nlate on a mortgage payment, a student loan, or a car payment โ all contractual civil debts โ does \nnot trigger criminal charges; yet in Arkansas, being late on rent can. The landlord alleges breach \nof contract and instead of resolving that breach of contract in civil court, as any other breach of \ncontract matter would be resolved,27 the landlord gets to use the bludgeon of the criminal system \nto scare the tenant into giving up their home without any kind of due process. In the words of \nPulaski County prosecutor Larry Jegley, tenants โare being charged with the crime of basically not \npaying rentโฆ Allowing one class of businesspeople to avail themselves of criminal process for \nbreach of contract is just fundamentally unconscionable.โ28  \n71.  The absence of a cap on criminal convictions and fines reinforces the landlordโs \n                                                 \n26 Even if a tenant were successful in defending her case, the Criminal Eviction Statute provides \nno mechanism to force the landlord to allow her to return to her home. By contrast, under \nArkansasโ unlawful detainer statute, a tenant wrongfully evicted could obtain a writ of restitution \nto return to her home. Ark. Code ยง 18-60-309(d)(2). \n27 The Arkansas Supreme Court has twice struck down statutes that criminalized a non-fraudulent \nbreach  of  contract.  State  v.  Riggs,  305  Ark.  217  (1991)  (invalidating  statute  criminalizing \ncontractorโs failure to pay for materials where statute required knowing or willful failure to pay); \nPeairs v. State, 227 Ark. 230 (1957) (striking down statute criminalizing a contractorโs failure to \ndischarge a laborerโs lien without element of fraud). \n28 When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n  16 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 17 of 35 PageID #: 18\n \noverwhelming leverage in violation of due process.  \n72.  Thus by tipping the scales of justice too far in landlordsโ favor, Defendants force \nrenters to make an impossible โ and unconstitutional โ choice between (1) self-evicting (i.e. \ngiving up their property interest) without due process to avoid criminal prosecution or (2) \nremaining on the property (meaning staying in their homes) and potentially face numerous criminal \ncharges, incarceration, and excessive fines.  \n73.  This criminal eviction scheme violates the procedural due process guarantees of the \nConstitution. \nb.  Defendants Also Violate Procedural Due Process by Not Considering \nPlaintiffsโ Ability to Pay \n \n74.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Procedural Due Process Clause prohibits outcomes \nin the criminal legal system from turning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment, \nincluding and especially incarceration (a.k.a. debtorsโ prisons). See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. \n660,  667  (1983)  (defendant  cannot  have  his  probation  revoked  for  being  too  poor  to  pay \nrestitution); Tate v.

Arkansasโ Constitution also prohibits debtorsโ prisons. Ark. Const. Art 2, ยง 16 (โNo \n  17 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 18 of 35 PageID #: 19\n \nperson shall be imprisoned for debt in any civil action . . . unless in case of fraud.โ).  \n76.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by allowing criminal \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 without considering a renterโs ability to pay. \n77.  A tenant who cannot afford rent has no way to raise indigence as a defense in \nCriminal Eviction Statute proceedings. \n78.  At no point โ not prior to filing charges, not at the time of filing charges, not during \ncourt appearances, not at the point of conviction, not at the point of imposing excessive fines โ is \nthe renterโs ability to pay considered. Without considering ability to pay, the Criminal Eviction \nStatute  effectively  criminalizes  poverty  in  violation  of  the  due  process  protections  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n79.  The imposition of daily fines without an ability-to-pay assessment as part of the \ncriminal sentence further criminalizes poverty and further violates the procedural due process \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment.29  \n80.  If the renter is not in a position to afford the daily fines (which is likely, given that \nthe renter was not in a position to afford rent), then that renter faces the possibility of even more \njail time and even more fines in the form of late fees, interest, etc. Any failure to pay criminal debt \ncan have enormous collateral consequences; additional fines and jail time come with all of the \ninevitable harm to housing, employment, a personโs driverโs license, child custody, mental and \nphysical health, and more.30 The Criminal Eviction Statute attempts to extract blood from a stone, \n                                                 \n29 Defendantsโ Criminal Eviction Statute is not only illegal, but self-defeating. If a renter cannot \nafford rent, it is unclear how that same renter will be able to afford fines on top of rent. These \nfines, furthermore, go to the state, rather than to the landlord who is alleging he is owed back rent. \nIndeed, it is for this reason that many landlords will also pursue a separate small claims court case \nto collect alleged back due rent. \n30 See, e.g., Too Poor to Pay, supra note 13. \n  18 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 19 of 35 PageID #: 20\n \nresulting only in driving renters deeper into poverty. \n81.  Due process therefore requires that the state of Arkansas conduct, at a minimum, \npre-deprivation (of the tenantโs property and liberty interests) ability-to-pay hearings that consider \nwhether non-payment of rent is willful. \nc.  By Not Considering Plaintiffsโ Ability to Pay, Defendants Also Violate \nEqual Protection \n \n82.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Equal Protection Clause also prohibits outcomes in \nthe criminal legal system, including and especially incarceration (a.k.a. debtorsโ prisons), from \nturning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment; hinging a personโs liberty on their \nability to pay is an unconstitutional form of wealth-based discrimination. See Bearden, 461 U.S.  \nat 667; Tate, 401 U.S. at 398; Williams, 399 U.S. at 244; Griffin, 351 U.S. at 19. \n83.  Comparing a wealthy and an indigent tenant demonstrates the double standard that \nthe Criminal Eviction Statute creates in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Criminal \nEviction Statute criminalizes the non-payment of rent; it does not distinguish between willful and \nnon-willful non-payment of rent. In practice, however, wealthy tenants will be extended the benefit \nof the willfulness standard and poor tenants will not, resulting in a different burden of proof \ndepending on the financial status of the defendant. In other words, the only way a wealthy tenant \nwill be prosecuted under this law is if they willfully do not pay rent, because the wealthy tenant \nhas the means to pay rent. The indigent tenant, on the other hand, who cannot afford rent, will be \nprosecuted for non-payment of rent even though their non-payment was not willful.  \n84.  By  lacking  a  willfulness  requirement,  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute  allows \nDefendants to implement an unconstitutional two-tier justice system in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause where the poor are prosecuted for non-payment of rent even when they cannot \nafford rent and the wealthy are only prosecuted for non-payment of rent if they willfully refuse to \n  19 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 20 of 35 PageID #: 21\n \npay rent. Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley have been threatened with prosecution because of \ntheir non-willful non-payment of rent. They stopped paying rent because they could not afford it \nalong with the necessary expenses they had to incur because their landlord stopped providing them \nwith running water a year ago. Plaintiffs are indigent and living off of a fixed income; their poverty \nis being criminalized.  \n85.  Because this law treats similarly-situated people (tenants who have not paid rent) \ndifferently, the law is an unlawful form of wealth-based discrimination in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause.31 \nd.  Defendants  Unconstitutionally  Criminalize  Plaintiffsโ  Status  of \nIndigence, in Violation of the Eighth Amendmentโs Prohibition on \nCruel and Unusual Punishment \n \n86.  The  Eighth  Amendmentโs  prohibition  on  cruel  and  unusual  punishment \n(incorporated against the states via the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment) prohibits \npunishing someoneโs status โ such as being alcoholic, see Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 \n(1962), or unhoused, see Martin v. City of Boise, 920 F.3d 584, 616-17 (9th Cir. 2019) โ and \npunishing involuntary acts associated with that status. See Powell v. State of Tex., 392 U.S. 514, \n550 n.2 (1968) (White, J., concurring) (the โproper subject of inquiry is whether volitional acts \nbrought about the โconditionโ and whether those acts are sufficiently proximate to the โconditionโ \nfor it to be permissible to impose penal sanctions on the โcondition.โโ); see also Blake v. City of \nGrants Pass, No. 1:18-CV-01823-CL, 2020 WL 4209227, at *6 (D. Or. July 22, 2020) (appeal to \n9th  Cir.  filed  Oct.  8,  2020)  (invalidating  law  banning  โcampingโ  within  city  limits  as \n                                                 \n31 Relatedly, a wealthier tenant would be in a better position to secure alternative housing within \nthe extremely brief 10-day notice window. Non-wealthy tenants are left scrambling, often facing \nhomelessness as their only option. Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley have been looking for other \nhousing since receiving the failure to vacate eviction notice in April 2021, yet with their limited \nincome and disabilities, they have not found anything. \n  20 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 21 of 35 PageID #: 22\n \nunconstitutionally criminalizing involuntary behavior associated with homelessness); Driver v. \nHinnant, 356 F.2d 761, 765 (4th Cir. 1966) (holding law unconstitutional for criminalizing public \nintoxication against a โchronic alcoholicโ because it โpunishe[d] an involuntary symptom of a \nstatusโ). \n87.  The Criminal Eviction Statute punishes Plaintiffsโ status of indigence. Just as \nPlaintiffsโ non-payment of rent is non-willful, Plaintiffsโ non-payment of rent is an โinvoluntary \nsymptom[] of a status,โ namely the status of indigence. Manning v. Caldwell for City of Roanoke, \n930 F.3d 264, 282-83 (4th Cir. 2019). Plaintiffsโ act of not paying rent is not volitional and is \nbrought about by the condition of poverty; that act is sufficiently proximate to the condition of \npoverty to bar penal sanctions for that act. \n88.  Courts have not required immutable characteristics such as race or age to bring \nstatus-based challenges under the Eighth Amendment. Rather, courts have focused on chronic \nconditions that are not necessarily voluntarily in origin, but lead to involuntary behavior. See \nRobinson, 370 U.S. at 667 (describing addiction as something that can be acquired โinnocently or \ninvoluntarilyโ).  Like  addiction  or  homelessness,  poverty  is  a  chronic,  but  not  necessarily \npermanent, status that can be acquired innocently or involuntarily (such as through pandemic-\ninduced job loss), which leads to inevitable behaviors: an alcoholic consumes alcohol; an unhoused \nperson sleeps outside; an indigent person does not pay rent. \n89.  Poverty  is  a  common  condition  in  Arkansas,  particularly  during  this  global \npandemic that has led to significant job loss. Arkansas holds the ignoble distinction of ranking \n47th in the nation for poverty; in 2020, 16.2% of Arkansans lived below the federal poverty line.32 \n                                                 \n32 Talk Poverty, Overall Poverty 2020, Center for American Progress (last visited Feb. 18, 2021), \nhttps://talkpoverty.org/indicator/listing/poverty/2020. From December 2019 to December 2020, \n  21 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 22 of 35 PageID #: 23\n \nA common consequence of poverty is the inability to pay for basic necessities, including rent. In \nAugust 2021, more than 19% of renting households in Arkansas (representing more than 80,000 \nhouseholds) were behind on rent.33 Of those households, more than 37% believed themselves to \nbe strongly or somewhat liked to be evicted in the next two months.34 Indigence is thus a common \nstatus in Arkansas that frequently leads to inability to pay rent.  \n90.  Like criminalizing homelessness or vagrancy, criminalizing failure to pay rent is a \nway  to  criminalize  poverty  and  is  thus  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  in  violation  of  the \nConstitution. See Powell, 392 U.S. at 551 (White, J., concurring) (making connection between \nhomelessness and poverty and concluding that a law criminalizing public drunkenness would be \nunconstitutional if the law targeted unhoused alcoholics, who cannot avoid public places just as \nthey cannot avoid drinking); Martin, 920 F.3d at 617 (โjust as the state may not criminalize the \nstate of being โhomeless in public places,โ the state may not โcriminalize conduct that is an \nunavoidable consequence of being homeless โ namely sitting, lying, or sleeping on the streets.โโ); \nWheeler v. Goodman, 306 F.Supp.58, 62 (W.D.N.C.1969) vacated on other grounds, 401 U.S. \n987, (1971) (striking down vagrancy statute making it a crime to, inter alia, be able to work but \nhave no property or โvisible and known meansโ of earning a livelihood because to โmake poverty \nand misfortune criminal is contrary to our fundamental beliefs, and to arrest and prosecute a person \nunder this statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment.โ). \n                                                 \nthe unemployment rate in Arkansas also increased from 3.5% to 4.2%.

That the Criminal Eviction Statute is a two-part scheme, involving first non-\npayment of rent and then the renterโs remaining on the property following notice by the landlord, \ndoes not change the analysis because it still โeffectively criminalizesโ poverty. Manning, 930 F.3d \nat 283 (rejecting argument that Virginiaโs โtwo-pronged statutory scheme,โ which permitted courts \nto first enter a civil interdiction order to prohibit the sale of alcohol to โhabitual drunkardsโ and \nthen made it a crime for that interdicted person to possess or consume alcohol, changed analysis \nthat statute unconstitutionally criminalized alcoholism).  \n92.  That Arkansas is the only state that criminalizes poverty via failure to pay rent only \nstrengthens the cruel and unusual nature of the Criminal Eviction Statute. See Trop v. Dulles, 356 \nU.S. 86, 100โ01 (1958) (explaining that because โthe words of the [Eighth] Amendment are not \npreciseโ and โtheir scope is not static[,] [t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing societyโ). \n93.  Arkansasโ criminalization of indigent Arkansansโ inability to pay rent via the \nCriminal Eviction Statute violates the Eighth Amendment as status-based punishment. \ne.  The Criminal Eviction Statute Allows for Unconstitutional Excessive \nFines \n \n94.  The Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment is incorporated against the \nstates. Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S.Ct. 682 (2019). \n95.  The daily fines charged as punishment for violation of Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction \nStatute are excessive and therefore unconstitutional. The fines are excessive because they are \ngrossly disproportionate to the gravity of the alleged underlying criminal behavior and they are \nimposed without consideration of a tenantโs ability to pay. \n96.  These fines are grossly disproportionate. The underlying alleged criminal behavior \nis failure to pay rent, even when that failure to pay rent is non-willful. Failure to pay rent is \n  23 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 24 of 35 PageID #: 25\n \ntraditionally a civil offense; it is a civil offense in every state including Arkansas, though Arkansas \nis the only state that chooses to also criminalize the act. To impose criminal fines on what is \nessentially a private and civil landlord-tenant contract dispute is grossly disproportionate.  \n97.  Furthermore, the underlying alleged criminal behavior of failure to pay rent raises \ngrave constitutional concerns regarding due process and equal protection and does not take into \nconsideration whether non-payment is willful, resulting in a law that criminalizes the status of \npoverty. โAny fine,โ like those imposed here, โis excessive if it is imposed on the basis of status \nand not conduct.โ Blake, 2020 WL 4209227, at *11 (holding fines imposed as part of law banning \nโcampingโ within city limits violated Excessive Fines Clause because โthe conduct for which \n[plaintiffs] face punishment is inseparable from their status as homeless individuals, and therefore, \nbeyond what the City may constitutionally punishโ). These fines are imposed on the basis of \nPlaintiffsโ poverty status; to impose fines on top of a sentence that is itself unconstitutional is \ngrossly disproportionate in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause. \n98.  These fines are also grossly disproportionate because the tenant has no control over \nthe total amount of the fees that she will be assessed and the judge has discretion to apply fees of \nan enormous range, from $1 to $25 per day.35 In just a matter of one week, that fine can range \nfrom $7 to $175. These fines may even, depending on the course of the case, be equal to or more \nthan what is alleged to be owed in back rent, contributing to the disproportionality of the fine. If, \nfor example, a case were to take 30 days to resolve, then the tenant could face up to $750 in fines, \n                                                 \n35 As a comparison point, minimum wage in Arkansas is $11.00/hour, meaning that the daily fines \na court can impose under the Criminal Eviction Statute are the equivalent of more than ยผ of a \nminimum-wage workerโs daily earnings, pre-tax (assuming an 8-hour work day). Ark. Depโt of \nLabor  &  Licensing,  Minimum  Wage  and  Overtime, \nhttps://www.labor.arkansas.gov/divisions/labor-standards/minimum-wage-and-overtime/  (last \nviewed Feb. 9, 2021). \n  24 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 25 of 35 PageID #: 26\n \nwhich is equivalent to the median gross rent across the state of Arkansas.36 It is also, ironically, \nabout the cost to a landlord to pursue a civil eviction through the unlawful detainer method.37 \n99.  Defendantsโ enforcement of the Criminal Eviction Statute essentially creates a \nsystem where it is okay to impose costs on tenants, who already cannot afford rent, but not okay \nto impose costs on landlords.  \n100.  When the renter is faced with the choice to either (1) remain in her home and \npossibly face criminal charges and fines or (2) abandon her home without due process, to charge \na renter these excessive fines is to inflict โpunishment [that] is more criminal than the crime.โ Mills \nv. City of Grand Forks, 614 F.3d 495, 501 (8th Cir. 2010). Plaintiffs Cynthia and Terry Easley \nhave chosen option one and remained in their home under the constant stress and threat of criminal \nprosecution because abandoning their home without due process would mean homelessness. \n101.  The failure to consider a personโs ability to pay the fine, particularly given that the \nunderlying criminal act concerns the personโs ability to pay rent, also makes the fine excessive and \nunconstitutional. When a renter cannot afford rent and their poverty is the basis for the criminal \nconviction, imposing additional fines โ the amount of which the renter has no control over โ is \nexcessive. Cf. Timbs, 139 S.Ct. at 688 (taking no position on the question whether a personโs \nincome and wealth are relevant considerations in judging the excessiveness of a fine); U.S. v. \nBajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 340, n. 15 (1998) (same). \n102.  Criminalizing  evictions  is  also  constitutionally  excessive  because  it  does  not \nadvance the stateโs legitimate interests and therefore has no rational basis. Failing to vacate \n                                                 \n36 From 2015โ2019, the median gross rent across the state of Arkansas was $745. U.S. Census \nBureau,  Arkansas  QuickFacts  as  of  July  1,  2019  (last  visited  Aug.  31,  2021), \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/AR. \n37 When Not Paying Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3.  \n  25 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 26 of 35 PageID #: 27\n \ninvolves a private contractual dispute that does not belong in the criminal system and Arkansas \nalready has multiple civil remedies to evict non-paying tenants. These civil proceedings serve \nprecisely the same ends as the failure to vacate statute, except without the stigma and irreversible \nconsequences of a criminal conviction. See Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 47โ48 (1972) \n(Powell, J., concurring) (โThe consequences of a misdemeanor conviction, whether they be a brief \nperiod served under the sometimes deplorable conditions found in local jails or the effect of a \ncriminal record on employability, are frequently of sufficient magnitude not to be casually \ndismissed by the label โpetty.โโ) (quotations and citations omitted).38 What is more, the civil \neviction remedies actually provide for eviction, whereas the Criminal Eviction Statute does not \ninclude that remedy. It is used to scare tenants into self-evicting. There is no rational basis or \nlegitimate interest in pushing Arkansans into homelessness and poverty, particularly when other \navenues are available to effectuate the relief that landlords seek. \n103.  The likelihood of fines being assessed is very high. Cases under the Criminal \nEviction Statute are regularly prosecuted and nearly 1 in 5 renting households in Arkansas are \nbehind on rent,39 making them a target for prosecution. Duffner v. City of St. Peters, Missouri, 930 \nF.3d 973, 977 (8th Cir. 2019).40 \n104.  By requiring grossly disproportionate fines that are imposed without an ability to \npay determination, the Criminal Eviction Statute violates the Excessive Fines Clause. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n                                                 \n38 Even if a renter is never convicted, the renter can still have a criminal record if they are arrested \nand  booked,  with  the  same  collateral  consequences  as  a  conviction  in  terms  of  housing, \nemployment, etc. When Falling Behind on Rent Leads to Jail Time, supra note 3. \n39 Pulse Survey Aug. 4โ16, supra note 33. \n40 Tenants facing charges under the Criminal Eviction Statute, should they wish to be represented \nby a public defender, also have to pay a public defender fee if they qualify, compounding the \nfinancial burden of this criminal scheme.  \n  26 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 27 of 35 PageID #: 28\n \n105.

The relief sought is the same for all Class Members: a permanent injunction and \ndeclaration against its enforcement so as to protect the constitutional rights of Class Members now \nand in the future. \n116.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class Members, as they all arise \nfrom one statute: Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101. Defendants apply the Criminal Eviction Statute in \nmaterially the same manner every day.  The material components of the scheme do not vary from \nClass Member to Class Member, and the resolution of these legal and factual issues will determine \nwhether all Class Members are entitled to the relief they seek. \n117.  Among the most important, but not the only, common questions of fact are:  \nโข  Does Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 allow for the criminal prosecution of a tenant \nwho cannot afford their rent, without verification of a landlordโs allegations \nregarding rent arrears and without a cap on the number of charges and \nassociated fines? \nโข  Does Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 allow for criminal prosecution of a renter \nwithout conducting an ability to pay inquiry? \nโข  Do Defendants treat renters who can and cannot afford rent differently, \nsubjecting the latter to threats of arrest, incarceration, and prosecution \nbecause of their inability to afford rent? \nโข  Do Defendants criminalize rentersโ poverty status? \nโข  Do Defendants fine, for any dollar amount, renters because they cannot \nafford rent?  \n \n118.  Among the most important common question of law are: \nโข  Does the Due Process Clause prohibit criminal charges to be brought for \nfailure to pay rent, with no cap on the number of charges and associated \nfines? \n  29 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 30 of 35 PageID #: 31\n \nโข  Does the Due Process Clause prohibit the government from punishing \nsomeone for nonpayment of rent without any ability-to-pay inquiry? \nโข  Does  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  prohibit  the  government  from \ncriminalizing a personโs inability to afford rent? \nโข  Does the Eighth Amendment prohibit the government from criminalizing a \nrenterโs poverty status? \nโข  Does the Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment prohibit the \ncharging of daily fines for criminal evictions? \n \nC.  Typicality โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) \n119.  The named Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the other Class Membersโ claims, and \nthey have the same interests in this case as all other Class Members.  Each Class Member is \ncurrently being criminally prosecuted or is at risk of criminal prosecution because she cannot \nafford to pay rent and the fees associated with failure to vacate under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101. The \nanswer to whether Defendantsโ wealth-based criminal eviction scheme is unconstitutional will \ndetermine the claims of the named Plaintiffs and every other Class Member. \n120.  If the named Plaintiffs succeed in the claim that Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 violates \ntheir constitutional rights, that ruling will likewise benefit every other Class Member. \nD.  Adequacy โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) \n121.  The  named  Plaintiffs  are  adequate  representatives  of  the  Class  because  their \ninterests in the vindication of the legal claims that they raise are entirely aligned with the interests \nof the other Class Members, who each have the same basic constitutional claims.  They are \nmembers of the Class, and their interests coincide with, and are not antagonistic to, those of the \nother Class Members. \n122.  There are no known conflicts of interest among Class Members, all of whom have \na similar interest in vindicating their constitutional rights that Defendants have violated. \n123.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Equal Justice Under Law and Professor \nAmy Pritchard of the Bowen Legal Clinic at the University of Arkansas Little Rock, all of whom \n  30 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 31 of 35 PageID #: 32\n \nhave experience in litigating complex civil rights matters in federal court and extensive knowledge \nof both the details of how Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction Statute works in practice and the relevant \nconstitutional and statutory law. Class counsel also have a detailed understanding of state law and \npractices as they relate to federal constitutional requirements. \n124.  Counsel have devoted significant time and resources becoming intimately familiar \nwith how Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction Statute works in practice and with the relevant state and \nfederal laws.  Counsel have also developed relationships with some of the individuals and families \nvictimized by Defendantsโ practices.  The interests of the Class Members will be fairly and \nadequately protected by the Plaintiffs and their attorneys. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n125.  Class action status is appropriate because Defendants have acted in the same \nunconstitutional manner with respect to all Class Members.  In enforcing Ark. Code ยง18-16-101, \nDefendants enforce a fundamental unfair wealth-based system of criminal eviction: renters who \ncan afford to pay rent are not prosecuted, while those who cannot are faced with eviction, criminal \ncharges, excessive fines, and jail time. \n126.  The Class therefore seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants \nfrom filing and pursuing charges against Plaintiffs pursuant to Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101. Because \nthe putative Class challenges Defendantsโ scheme as unconstitutional through declaratory and \ninjunctive  relief  that  would  apply  the  same  relief  to  every  Class  Member,  Rule  23(b)(2) \ncertification is appropriate and necessary. \n127.  Injunctive relief compelling Defendants to comply with these constitutional rights \nwill similarly protect each Class Member from being subjected to Defendantsโ unconstitutional \ncriminal eviction scheme.  A declaration and injunction stating that Defendants cannot file charges \n  31 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 32 of 35 PageID #: 33\n \nagainst renters under Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 would provide relief to every Class Member.  \nTherefore, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Class as a whole is appropriate. \n128.  Plaintiffs seek the following relief and hereby demand a jury in this cause for all \nmatters so appropriate. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount One: Violation of Procedural Due Process \n \n129.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthis Complaint. \n130.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by (1) allowing criminal \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 solely on the basis of a landlordโs affidavit and \n(2) by having no cap on the number of criminal charges or excessive fines that can be imposed. \nNo other civil debt incurs criminal charges. Landlords also have access to two civil eviction \nremedies. By forcing tenants to either self-evict or face numerous criminal charges and fines โ \neven if landlords are lying and even when landlords have access to a civil system โ Defendantsโ \ncriminal eviction scheme tips the scales of justice too far in landlordsโ favor in violation of due \nprocess. \nCount Two: Violation of Procedural Due Process Regarding Ability to Pay \n \n131.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthis Complaint. \n132.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Procedural Due Process Clause prohibits outcomes \nin the criminal legal system from turning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment. \n133.  Defendants provide constitutionally deficient due process by allowing criminal \ncharges to be brought under Ark. Code ยง18-16-101 without considering a renterโs ability to pay. \n  32 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 33 of 35 PageID #: 34\n \nA tenant who cannot afford rent has no means to raise indigence as a defense in Criminal Eviction \nStatute proceedings.  \n134.  Without  considering  ability  to  pay,  the  Criminal  Eviction  Statute  effectively \ncriminalizes poverty. \n135.  The imposition of daily fines without an ability-to-pay assessment as part of the \ncriminal sentence further criminalizes poverty and further violates the procedural due process \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n136.  Due  process  requires  that  Defendants  conduct  pre-deprivation  ability-to-pay \nhearings. \nCount Three: Violation of Equal Protection, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n \n137.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthe Complaint. \n138.  The Fourteenth Amendmentโs Equal Protection Clause also prohibits outcomes in \nthe criminal legal system from turning on a personโs ability to make a monetary payment.  \n139.  The  Criminal  Eviction  statuteโs  lack  of  a  willfulness  standard  creates  an \nunconstitutional double-standard that violates Equal Protection because it results in similarly-\nsituated tenants being treated differently, with the only difference being how much money the \ntenant has. A rich tenant will only be prosecuted if their non-payment of rent is willful; a poor \ntenant will be prosecuted even if their non-payment of rent is involuntarily. This wealth-based \ndiscrimination is prohibited by the Equal Protection clause. \nCount Four: Criminalization of Status \n140.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthe Complaint. \n  33 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 34 of 35 PageID #: 35\n \n141.  Defendantsโ criminalization of indigent Arkansansโ inability to pay rent via the \nCriminal Eviction Statute violates the Eighth Amendment as (poverty) status-based punishment. \nThere is no iteration of the law that would eliminate this cruel and unusual punishment as it is \ninherent to the structure of criminalizing failure to pay rent, which is only ever weaponized against \nthose who are unable to pay. \nCount Five: Excessive Fines \n \n142.  Plaintiffs re-allege, as though fully set forth in this paragraph, all the allegations of \nthe Complaint. \n143.  The Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment is incorporated against the \nstates. Timbs v. Indiana, 139 S.Ct. 682 (2019). \n144.  The daily fines charged as punishment for violation of Arkansasโ Criminal Eviction \nStatute are excessive and therefore unconstitutional. The fines are excessive because they are \ngrossly disproportionate to the gravity of the alleged underlying criminal behavior and they do not \ntake into consideration a tenantโs ability to pay. No rational basis supports the imposition of fines \nas they do not advance any legitimate state interest given that two civil eviction remedies exist to \naddress contractual disputes between landlords and tenants, including alleged non-payment of rent. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \n      WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs and the other Class Members request that this Court issue \nthe following relief: \na.  A declaratory judgment that Defendants violate the named Plaintiffsโ and Class \nMembersโ  constitutional  rights  by  threatening  them  with  arrest,  criminal \nconvictions, excessive fines, and jail time solely because they cannot make a \nmonetary payment on a civil debt; \n \nb.  An order and judgment preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants from \nenforcing Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101; \n \n  34 \n\nCase 6:21-cv-06125-SOH   Document 2     Filed 09/02/21   Page 35 of 35 PageID #: 36\n \nc.  A declaratory judgment declaring that Ark. Code ยง 18-16-101 is unconstitutional \nand therefore unenforceable;  \n \nd.  An order and judgment granting reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1988, and any other relief this Court deems just and proper. \n \n        Respectfully submitted, \n           \n/s/ Phil Telfeyan \n        Phil Telfeyan \n        /s/ Natasha Baker \n        Natasha Baker* \n        Equal Justice Under Law \n        400 7th St. NW, Suite 602 \n        Washington, D.C. 20004 \n        (202) 505-2058 \n        ptelfeyan@equaljusticeunderlaw.org \nnbaker@equaljusticeunderlaw.org \n*Application for Admission pro hac vice forthcoming \n/s/ Amy Pritchard \nAmy Pritchard, Ark.
