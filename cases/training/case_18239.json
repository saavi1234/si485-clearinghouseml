Crtrm Administrator: Peggie Vannozzi; Pla Counsel: Adam Hosmer-Henner, Margaret McLetchie; Def Counsel: Douglas Rands; Court Reporter: Kathy French; Time of Hearing: 1:31 PM - 1:50 PM; Courtroom: 5. The Court has reviewed the status reports (ECF Nos. 95, 96, and 97 ) which were filed last night. Mr. Rands and Mr. Hosmer-Henner address the Court with regard to the issues identified by the Court in the last hearing. The Court directs counsel to continue exploring the use of closed circuit television to disseminate information on HPV testing and treatment and provide an update in the the next quarterly status report. Mr. Hosmer-Henner notes the potential discrepancy in numbers provided in Defendants' status report and asks the Court to order Defendants medical personnel to provide an affidavit that explains why there is a discrepancy in the numbers. Mr. Rands advises that he will work with Dr. Minev and the medical staff to obtain a declaration to attach to the next quarterly report. The Court ORDERS Defendants to file a declaration from a member of the States medical personnel on regarding the discrepancies by 7/6/2021. The parties do not believe that a modification of the consent decree is needed at this time to eliminate some of the provisions for prioritization of treatment. The Court sets the next status conference for 8/16/2021 at 10:00 AM in Reno Courtroom 5 before Chief Judge Miranda M. Du. The hearing will be by telephonic conference.

Randall Gilmer; Court Reporter: Kathy French; Time of Hearing: 10:00 AM - 10:55 AM; Courtroom: 5; The Court has reviewed the status report (ECF No. 86 ) and the response (ECF No. 88 .) Mr. Rands, Mr. Gilmer and Mr. Hosmer-Henner discuss the status report and response with the Court. The Court notes the large number of inmates who have declined HCV testing. The Court and counsel discuss providing information to inmates regarding testing opportunities, including placing information in new inmate packets, using group education such as utilizing the TV network inside the prison system or enlisting inmate volunteers who might discuss testing options with other inmates. Mr. Hosmer-Henner suggests that the state set up a spreadsheet to verify known instances of HCV due to the concerns expressed by the Court about potential discrepancy. In response to questions by the Court, Mr. Rands and Mr. Gilmore address MD-219 and the deadlines imposed by the consent decree. The Court has reviewed the notice of violation filed by inmate Kevin Fernandez (ECF No. 87 .) Based upon the representations of Mr. Rands, the Court will disregard Kevin Fernandez's notice of violation (ECF No. 87 .) The Court directs counsel to confer on the the following issues: 1) communication with inmates regarding the availability of HCV testing and 2) verification of known instances of HCV due to concerns about potential discrepancy.

It is therefore ordered that the status conference set for May 19, 2022 is vacated.

    "summary": "<p>This consolidated, class action lawsuit brought by people in the custody of the Nevada Department of Corrections (NDOC) challenged the Department's Hepatitis C treatment policies and protocols. Eight named plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued the NDOC alleging violations of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The lawsuit sought a court order requiring NDOC to identify and monitor inmates with Hepatitis C, provide medical care that meet the current medical standards of care and treat their symptoms and complications, and prevent discrimination against inmates with Hepatitis C. The case was assigned to Chief Judge Miranda M. Du and Magistrate Judge Carla Baldwin.</p>\r\n<p>On February 18, 2020, the plaintiffs&rsquo; class certification was granted. The class was certified as inmates with Hepatitis C who have been in NDOC custody for at least 21 days and have at least 12 weeks left to serve on their sentence who would be candidates for direct-acting antiviral treatment, but to whom treatment has been denied or delayed for reasons other than legitimate reasons under medical standards of care.</p>\r\n<p>The parties submitted a consent decree to the court for its approval on August 20, 2020. There were objections submitted, including by a named plaintiff, but the court overruled the objections and accepted the consent decree on October 29, 2020. In the consent decree, NDOC agreed to adopt revised Hepatitis C policies and procedures; test all NDOC prisoners by December 31, 2020, and continue testing as part of intake procedures; provide direct-action antiviral (DAA) medication to all prisoners with Hepatitis C rated as Priority One within six months and provide a minimum of 2,400 DAA treatments to prisoners with Hepatitis C within three years, and after three years provide DAA treatments to prisoners at a rate faster than new Hepatitis C infections; and provide quarterly reports on Hepatitis C testing, infections and treatment numbers.</p>\r\n<p>In January 2021, the Nevada Legislature <a href=\"https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/state-budgeting-6-million-to-treat-life-threatening-hepatitis-c-after-inmates-sue-say-they-were-denied-care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> budgeted</a> $6 million dollars to meet its obligation under the consent decree after approving an initial $7 million in funds in October 2020.</p>\r\n<p>On May 10, 2021, a class member filed a notice of violation of the consent decree, which in June the court said it would disregard.</p>\r\n<p>The consent decree is expected to be in place for four years, and, as of June 2024, monitoring is ongoing, with quarterly status reports continuing to be filed at regular intervals. Despite some early concerns from class counsel regarding whether defendants would meet the yearly treatment quotas, the status reports have consistently reflected substantive compliance and no court intervention has been necessary.&nbsp;</p>",

This Report addresses two \n20  specific concerns raised by the Court: (1) additional information to be provided to inmates within \n21  the NDOC concerning HCV testing and (2) verification of the number of inmates that are HCV \n22  positive in light of the initial numbers reported early in the litigation.  \n23    At this point, the Defendants have not yet determined whether it would be feasible to add \n24  programing to the television system on Hepatitis.  However, Counsel agrees and confirms that \n25  they will continue to investigate this possibility. \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 94   Filed 06/28/21   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n2  I.  STATUS REPORT \n3  The Defendants have obtained the most recent HCV literature promulgated by the CDC \n4  regarding HCV testing. These two documents are attached as Exhibit A to this report. The \n5  Defendants will begin circulating these handouts as part of further HCV outreach in furtherance \n6  of the spirit of the HCV Consent Agreement. (ECF No. 80). See Exhibit B (Declaration of Dr. \n7  Minev who is the Medical Director for the NDOC wherein he declares he has instructed his staff \n8  to circulate the aforementioned CDC handouts).   These handouts are also included in the intake \n9  materials provided to the inmates and testing is now a part of the intake protocol.  \n10  Additionally, Defendants have researched the reason for the discrepancy between the \n11  initial positive HCV cases and the current working number of positive HCV inmates. In essence, \n12  the early number reported to Plaintiff’s counsel was based upon an initial screening test for HCV \n13  within the inmate population. That positive number was based upon those that were tested and \n14  had an HCV positive antibody test. However, those with antibodies are not necessarily HCV \n15  positive. Instead, a positive antibody test indicates that a further laboratory confirmation test is \n16  necessary.  \n17  In examining the data, it was determined that there are currently 1414 inmates with HCV \n18  positive antibodies, but only 745 of them have a viral load. The Defendants cannot say for \n19  certain that this was the cause of the discrepancy when the numbers were first reported in March \n20  of 2020 because of staff changes. But, the current point of contact for HCV monitoring believes \n21  that this explains the discrepancy. Attached as Exhibit C is a CDC handout explaining that not all \n22  HCV antibody positive test results require treatment.  \n23  Attached as Exhibit D (under seal) is a excel sheet showing inmate HCV testing as of \n24  September 30, 202).  As the Court can see there are multiple inmates on the HCV positive tab \n25  who have no viral loads.  There may be an Ab >11.0 but under Hepatitis C Quantitation it says \n26  HCVTND (which would be Labcorp's shorthand of HCV not detected).  Several examples are \n27  attached as Exhibit E (under seal).  Additionally, if the number is less than 1.0 in column G, of \n28  Exhibit D,  there would be no HCV detected, and further testing would not be required or useful. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 94   Filed 06/28/21   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  Thus, the difference between the numbers reported in March of 2020 of inmates believed \n2  to have HCV dropped drastically once laboratory confirmation tests were completed to check for \n3  an HCV viral load, rather than HCV antibodies. For monitoring purposes, this means that there is \n4  not  a  large  segment  of  the  NDOC  population  that  have  been  overlooked.  As  a  result,  no \n5  intervention is necessary at this time.  \n6  In summary, the CDC information is being included in the intake information provided to \n7  the inmates.  Additionally, it is being provided to the inmates who opted out of testing on the \n8  first round, with an encouragement to be tested.  Finally, it appears that the discrepancy in \n9  numbers may be due to the persons who test positive, but have no viral load.  Should the Court \n10  require any further information, the Defendants would be happy to comply. \n11  Dated June 28, 2021. \n \n12 \n  AARON D. FORD, Attorney General  \n \n13 \n /s/ D.

The Court notes the large \nnumber of inmates who have declined HCV testing. The Court and \ncounsel discuss providing information to inmates regarding testing \nopportunities, including placing information in new inmate packets, \nusing group education such as utilizing the TV network inside the \nprison system or enlisting inmate volunteers who might discuss \ntesting options with other inmates. Mr. Hosmer-Henner suggests \nthat the state set up a spreadsheet to verify known instances of HCV \ndue to the concerns expressed by the Court about potential \ndiscrepancy. \nIn response to questions by the Court, Mr. Rands and Mr. Gilmore \naddress MD-219 and the deadlines imposed by the consent decree. \nThe Court has reviewed the notice of violation filed by inmate \nKevin Fernandez (ECF No. 87 .) Based upon the representations of \nMr. Rands, the Court will disregard Kevin Fernandez's notice of \nviolation (ECF No. 87 .) \nThe Court directs counsel to confer on the the following issues: 1) \ncommunication with inmates regarding the availability of HCV \ntesting and 2) verification of known instances of HCV due to \nconcerns about potential discrepancy. The parties are directed to file \na status report on 6/28/2021. The Court sets a status conference for \n6/29/2021 at 1:30 PM to further discuss resolving the issues \nidentified above. \n(no image attached) (Copies have been distributed pursuant to the \nNEF - PAV) Modified on 6/2/2021 (PAV).

SUMMARY \n12  Plaintiffs Marty Scott Fitzgerald, Elizabeth Carley, Donald Savage, Howard White, \n13  Carl  Olsen,  Scott  Bedard,  Stephen  Ciolino,  and  Mitchell  Fields1  seek  to  certify  a \n14  declarative and injunctive class of similarly-situated people incarcerated—or who will be \n15  incarcerated in the future—and in the custody of the Nevada Department of Corrections \n16  (“NDOC”) who suffer from chronic cases of the Hepatitis C virus (“HCV”).2 (ECF No. 11 \n17  (the “Motion”).) NDOC recently changed its policy governing the treatment of HCV-positive \n18  incarcerated individuals, but Plaintiffs assert the policy’s prioritization system conflicts with \n19  the medical standard of care and exposes incarcerated people to an unreasonable risk of \n20  harm  in  violation of  their  Eighth  Amendment  rights.  Because  the  Court agrees  with \n21  Plaintiffs that they satisfy the prerequisites for class certification—and as further explained \n22  below—the Court will exercise its discretion to grant the Motion and certify a class. The \n23  Court further adopts Plaintiffs’ proposed definition of the class members and issues for \n24  class litigation as noted in the conclusion of this order. \n25 \n \n  1The Court consolidated a number of cases for pretrial purposes where HCV-\n26 \npositive incarcerated people challenge NDOC’s policy that resulted in them being denied \ntreatment under the Eighth Amendment, and located pro bono counsel to represent them \n27 \nin most of the cases. (ECF No. 1.) \n  \n28 \n  2NDOC opposes the motion. (ECF No. 19.)  \n \n\n \n1  II.  BACKGROUND \n2  A. Generally \n3  Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. (ECF No. 19-4 at 2.) HCV is a blood-\n4  borne virus transmitted through exposure to infected blood.  See Center for Disease \n5  Control,  Hepatitis  C  Questions  and  Answers  for  Health  Professionals, \n6  https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq.htm (last visited February 12, 2020).3 About 75% \n7  to 85% of people who contract  HCV go on to develop chronic HCV, or a HCV infection \n8  that lasts longer than six months. See id. Over time, HCV damages the liver. See id. It can \n9  cause fibrosis—the formation of scar tissue in the liver—and cirrhosis, which is severe \n10  fibrosis. See id. In rare cases, it can also lead to liver cancer. Chronic HCV can also cause \n11  other adverse health impacts, such as diabetes, joint pain, depression, sore muscles, \n12  arthritis, various cancers, decreased kidney function, rashes, and autoimmune disease. \n13  While not all people infected with HCV will develop symptoms, symptoms include fever, \n14  fatigue, loss of appetite, upset stomach, vomiting, dark urine, grey-colored stool, joint pain, \n15  and yellow skin and eyes. (ECF No. 19-4 at 2.) \n16  Because it is spread through the blood, two common ways of contracting HCV are \n17  intravenous drug use, including sharing needles, and unsanitary tattooing. (ECF No. 19-5 \n18  at 2.) HCV infection is relatively widespread, especially amongst incarcerated people. “An \n19  estimated 12% to 39% of incarcerated persons in North America are HCV-antibody–\n20  positive[.]”  American Association  for the  Study  of Liver Diseases  and  the  Infectious \n21  Diseases Society of America, HCV Guidance: Recommendations for Testing, Managing, \n22  and  Treating  Hepatitis  C  (“HCV  Guidance”),  HCV  Testing  and  Linkage  to  Care, \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n26     \n  3The Court takes judicial notice of the facts on this web page because the Center \n27  For Disease Control is a source whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, and \nthe basic information about HCV it provides is not subject to reasonable dispute. See, e.g., \n28  Harris v. County of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1131-32 (9th Cir. 2012).  \n \n \n2 \n\n \n1  https://www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/testing-and-linkage  (last  visited  February  13, \n2  2020).4  \n3  Until recently, HCV could only be treated, not cured. (ECF No. 19 at 1.) But HCV \n4  can now be treated so effectively it can be considered ‘cured’ through treatment with \n5  direct-acting antiviral drugs (“DAAs”). (Id. at 1-2.) “Successful hepatitis C treatment results \n6  in sustained virologic response ([“]SVR[”]), which is tantamount to virologic cure and, as \n7  such, is expected to benefit nearly all chronically infected persons.” HCV Guidance, When \n8  and  in  Whom  to  Initiate  HCV  Therapy,  https://www.hcvguidelines.org/evaluate/when-\n9  whom (last visited February 13, 2020). The current standard of care as stated in the HCV \n10  Guidance thus recommends treating most all HCV-positive people with DAAs. See id. \n11  “[F]rom a medical standpoint, data continue to accumulate that demonstrate the many \n12  benefits,  both  intrahepatic  and  extrahepatic,  that  accompany  HCV  eradication.”  Id. \n13  “Therefore, the panel continues to recommend treatment for all patients with chronic HCV \n14  infection, except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be remediated by HCV \n15  treatment, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy.” Id. “Accordingly, prioritization \n16  tables have been removed from this section.” Id. NDOC disputes this. (ECF No. 19 at 2-\n17  3.) As further explained below, NDOC’s policy for treating HCV includes a prioritization \n18  table, which NDOC contends is based on “sound medical judgment.” (Id.) \n19  B. Plaintiffs \n20  Plaintiffs are all incarcerated people in NDOC’s custody who are HCV-positive and \n21  requested DAA treatment, but were either refused by NDOC officials, or, in the case of \n22  Scott Bedard only, were refused for two years, though he is now being treated with the \n23  DAA Epclusa. (ECF Nos. 10 at 3-4, 11-17, 11 at 7-11.) Plaintiffs all describe the negative \n24  health effects they have experienced because of NDOC’s refusal to treat them with DAAs, \n25 \n \n26    4The Court also takes judicial notice of the facts on the HCV Guidance website, \nwhich is akin to an online pamphlet, because the American Association for the Study of \n27  Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America are sources who accuracy \ncannot reasonably be questioned, and the information about HCV the HCV Guidance \n28  website provides is not subject to reasonable dispute unless otherwise noted in this order. \nSee, e.g., Harris, 682 F.3d at 1131-32. \n \n3 \n\n \n1  including the negative mental health impact of knowing that their disease will get worse \n2  over time, and that an effective cure exists, but they will not receive treatment. (Id.) \n3  Plaintiffs primarily seek  class-wide  injunctive  relief,  though they also  seek  individual \n4  damages. (ECF No. 10 at 19-23.)  \n5  C. NDOC’s Policy \n6  Plaintiffs more specifically allege that NDOC refused to treat Plaintiffs’ HCV with \n7  DAAs because NDOC officials determined they did not qualify for DAA treatment under \n8  Medical Directive Number 219 (“MD 219”). (ECF No. 10 at 11-17; see also ECF Nos. 11-\n9  1, 19-1 (copies of the policies)5.) NDOC agrees that MD 219 governs the treatment of \n10  HCV-positive incarcerated people in its custody. (ECF No. 19 at 2-3.) \n11  The most recent version of MD 219 provides that all people in NDOC custody will \n12  be tested for HCV (ECF No. 19 at 2-3), which Plaintiffs concede is a step in their desired \n13  direction (ECF No. 11 at 6). Plaintiffs also agree that the operative version of MD 219 \n14  makes DAA treatment available to more incarcerated people than previous versions of the \n15  policy did. (ECF No. 11 at 6.) \n16  However, MD 219 includes three priority levels for HCV treatment. (ECF Nos. 11-1 \n17  at 8, 19-1 at 4.) Plaintiffs argue this prioritization system conflicts with the standard of care \n18  and exposes incarcerated people to an unreasonable risk of harm, but NDOC argues this \n19  prioritization system “guarantees that all HCV patient [sic] will receive DAAs as needed \n20  and required to treat their condition, while at the same time providing medical personnel \n21  with discretion and flexibility to safeguard that those in a lower level of priority obtain \n22  expedited DAA treatment when in the sound judgment of the medical provider examining \n23  the patient it is determined that it is medically necessary.” (Compare ECF No. 11 at 6-7, \n24 \n25 \n26   \n  5The most recent versions of MD 219 proffered by the parties have different dates, \n27  with NDOC’s proffered policy bearing a more recent date, but NDOC represents that there \nare no material differences between the versions of the policies proffered by the parties. \n28  (ECF No. 19 at 3 n.2.) Accordingly, the Court will simply refer to MD 219 throughout this \norder, remaining cognizant it is referring to either ECF No. 11-1 or ECF No. 19-1.  \n \n4 \n\n \n1  with ECF No. 19 at 3.) Plaintiffs counter there is no medical justification for delaying DAA \n2  treatment to individuals in any of the priority levels. (ECF No. 11 at 7.) \n3  The three priority levels are as follows. \n4  Priority Level 1 – High Priority for Treatment – Advanced hepatic fibrosis: APRI > \n2.0, Metavir or Batts/Ludwig stage 3 or 4 on liver biopsy, cirrhosis; Liver transplant \n5  recipients; HCC; Comorbid conditions associated with HCV; Immunosuppressant \nmedication; and/or Continuity of Care. \n6   \nPriority Level 2 – Immediate Priority for Treatment – Evidence for progressive \n7  fibrosis: APRI score > 0.70, stage 2 fibrosis on liver biopsy; Comorbid Medical \nconditions; Diabetes melitus; and/or Chronic kidney disease. \n8   \nPriority Level 3 – Low Priority for Treatment – Stage 0 to Stage 1 fibrosis on liver \n9  biopsy; APRI < 1; All other cases of HCV infection meeting the eligibility criteria for \ntreatment. \n10   \n11  (ECF Nos. 11-1 at 8, 19-1 at 4.) Incarcerated people categorized as priority levels 1 and \n12  2 are more likely to receive DAAs than those people categorized as priority level 3, who \n13  are considered low priority for treatment. (ECF No. 11-1 at 8.) MD 219 also notes that \n14  NDOC officials may make exceptions to these criteria on an individual basis, and if there \n15  is a compelling need to do so. (Id.) In addition, MD 219 lists a number of contraindications \n16  for treatment, such as non-adherence to prior therapy, which allows NDOC to refuse DAA \n17  treatment to incarcerated people who would otherwise be eligible to receive it under MD \n18  219. (Id. at 8-9.) \n19  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n20  “The class action is ‘an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by \n21  and on behalf of the individual named parties only.’” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 \n22  U.S. 338, 348 (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01 (1979)). The \n23  party seeking class certification “must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with” \n24  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Id. at 350. “[C]ertification is proper only if the ‘trial court \n25  is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been \n26  satisfied.’” Id. at 350-51 (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982)). \n27  The four Rule 23(a) requirements are numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy \n28  of representation. See id. at 349; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \n \n5 \n\n \n1  “In  addition  to  satisfying  Rule  23(a)’s  prerequisites,  parties  seeking  class \n2  certification must show that the action is maintainable under Rule 23(b)(1), (2), or (3).” \n3  Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997). Here, Plaintiffs seek to certify \n4  a Rule 23(b)(2) class. (ECF No. 11 at 12, 16-18.) A Rule 23(b)(2) class is one where “the \n5  party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to \n6  the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \n7  respecting the class as a whole[.]” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). “The key to the (b)(2) class is \n8  ‘the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted—the notion that \n9  the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class \n10  members or as to none of them.’” See Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 687 (9th Cir. 2014) \n11  (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350). \n12  In addition to the explicit requirements of Rule 23, an implied prerequisite to class \n13  certification is that the class must be sufficiently definite. The party seeking certification \n14  must demonstrate that an identifiable and ascertainable class exists. See Kristensen v. \n15  Credit  Payment  Servs.,  12  F.  Supp.  3d  1292,  1302  (D.  Nev.  2014).  To  satisfy  the \n16  ascertainability requirement, a class must be determinable from objective, rather than \n17  subjective, criteria. See id. at 1303. The moving party must also affirmatively demonstrate \n18  that he or she meets the above requirements. See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 674. However, a \n19  court should not “‘turn class certification into a mini-trial’ on the merits.” Edwards v. First \n20  Am. Corp., 798 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., \n21  657 F.3d 970, 983 n.8 (9th Cir. 2011)). \n22  When a court certifies a class, it must do so in a written order. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23  23(c)(1)(A). That order must define the class, the class claims, issues, or defenses, and \n24  must appoint class counsel under Rule 23(g). See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(B). \n25  IV.  DISCUSSION \n26    Plaintiffs seek to certify a class of all persons: (a) who are or will be in the legal \n27  custody of the NDOC; (b) who have been incarcerated for at least 21 days and have at \n28  least 12 weeks remaining on their sentence; (c) who have been diagnosed with chronic \n \n6 \n\n \n1  HCV and are candidates for DAA treatment pursuant to the proper medical standard of \n2  care; and (d) for whom DAA treatment has been or will be denied, withheld, or delayed \n3  based on policies or considerations that deviate from the proper medical standard of care. \n4  (ECF No. 11 at 12.) The Court will conduct a rigorous analysis to determine whether it \n5  should certify this class. See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 674. In conducting this analysis, the \n6  Court will first address whether the class is sufficiently definite, then addresses each of \n7  the Rule 23(a) requirements, then Rule 23(b)(2), and then finally the appointment of class \n8  counsel. \n9  A. Whether the Class is Sufficiently Definite \n10    As mentioned above, any valid proposed class must be ascertainable based on \n11  objective criteria, and the “proposed class definition should ‘describe a set of common \n12  characteristics sufficient to allow a prospective plaintiff to identify himself or herself as \n13  having a right to recover based on the description.’” Kristensen, 12 F. Supp. 3d at 1303 \n14  (citation and internal punctuation omitted). The Court finds the proposed class satisfies \n15  this standard. Whether someone is in NDOC’s custody, where they are in their sentence, \n16  whether they are candidates for DAA treatment, and whether their requests for DAA \n17  treatment have been denied are all objective criteria. NDOC records can likely be used to \n18  determine potential class members. Moreover, the Court finds that a prospective plaintiff \n19  could identify whether she could participate in the proposed class based on these criteria.  \n20    NDOC’s argument to the contrary is unpersuasive. NDOC basically argues that \n21  new inmates will become members of the class—and others will fall out of the class \n22  definition—all the time, because new people will arrive, and others will be released, \n23  whether through parole or a reduced sentence. (ECF No. 19 at 6.) But NDOC overlooks \n24  that Plaintiffs are primarily seeking injunctive relief that would affect all current and future \n25  HCV-positive inmates, so there would be no need to make individualized determinations. \n26  See Graham v. Parker, No. 16-CV-01954, 2017 WL 1737871, at *2 (M.D. Tenn. May 4, \n27  2017) (making the same point in an order certifying a class of HCV-positive incarcerated \n28 \n \n7 \n\n \n1  people alleging their Eighth Amendment rights were violated by the denial of treatment). \n2  Moreover, class certification here will insure against the danger of mootness. See id. at 3.  \n3  The Court will therefore move on to the Rule 23(a) requirements. \n4  B. Rule 23(a) Requirements \n5  1.  Numerosity \n6  Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be so numerous that joinder of all class \n7  members is impracticable. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). The exact size of the class need \n8  not be known so long as general knowledge and common sense indicate that the class is \n9  large. See McMillon v. Hawaii, 261 F.R.D. 536, 542 (D. Haw. 2009); see also Sherman v. \n10  Griepentrog, 775 F. Supp. 1383, 1389 (D. Nev. 1991) (“‘It is not necessary that the \n11  members  of  the  class  be  so  clearly  identified  that  any  member  can  be  presently \n12  ascertained.’ The court may draw a reasonable inference of the size of the class from the \n13  facts before it.”) (citation omitted) (quoting Carpenter v. Davis, 424 F.2d 257, 260 (5th Cir. \n14  1970)).  \n15  Plaintiffs’  estimate,  based  on  NDOC’s  own  predictions  regarding  its  prison \n16  population and national statistics on percentages of HCV-positive incarcerated people, is \n17  that there are between 1,500 and 4,500 HCV-positive inmates in NDOC’s custody at any \n18  one time. (ECF No. 11 at 12-13.) “Although this evidence does not establish exactly how \n19  many class members exist, Plaintiffs are not required to ‘specify an exact number or to \n20  prove the identity of each class member, rather, ‘the plaintiffs must only show a reasonable \n21  estimate of the number of class members.’’” Postawko v. Missouri Dep’t of Corr., Case \n22  No. 2:16-CV-04219-NKL, 2017 WL 3185155, at *6 (W.D. Mo. July 26, 2017), aff’d, 910 \n23  F.3d 1030 (8th Cir. 2018) (certifying a class of HCV-positive inmates). Moreover, joinder \n24  of this many class members would clearly be impracticable. See, e.g., Kavu, Inc. v. \n25  Omnipak Corp., 246 F.R.D. 642, 646-47 (W.D. Wash. 2007) (finding the joinder of 3,000 \n26  class  members  impracticable).  NDOC’s  counterarguments  focus  on  issues  of \n27  commonality, typicality, and whether the class definition is sufficiently definite. (ECF No. \n28 \n \n8 \n\n \n1  19 at 5-6.) They are misplaced. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the numerosity \n2  requirement of Rule 23(a). \n3  2.  Commonality \n4  “[C]ommonality requires that the class members’ claims ‘depend upon a common \n5  contention’ such that ‘determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central \n6  to the validity of each claim in one stroke.’” Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581, \n7  588 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350). “[A] class meets Rule 23(a)(2)’s \n8  commonality requirement when the common questions it has raised are ‘apt to drive the \n9  resolution of the litigation,’ no matter their number.” Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. Co., 765 F.3d \n10  1161, 1165 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Assocs., Inc., 731 F.3d 952, 962 \n11  (9th Cir. 2013)). But “[w]hat matters to class certification ... is not the raising of common \n12  ‘questions’—even  in  droves—but  rather,  the  capacity  of  a  class-wide  proceeding  to \n13  generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.’” Dukes, 564 U.S. \n14  at 350 (citation omitted).  \n15  Plaintiffs argue this requirement is satisfied because NDOC has subjected them to \n16  standardized  conduct  through  MD  219,  and  though  the  applicable  standard  of  care \n17  suggests that they would benefit from DAAs, NDOC has refused their requests for DAAs \n18  because of NDOC’s application of MD 219. (ECF No. 11 at 13-14.) Plaintiffs further point \n19  out several other issues common to all Plaintiffs. (Id. at 13-14.) NDOC counters that \n20  Plaintiffs  cannot  satisfy  the  commonality  requirement  because  claims  of  inadequate \n21  medical care require individual determinations, and because a class action is unnecessary \n22  to litigate the constitutionality of MD 219. (ECF No. 19 at 7-8.) NDOC further points to a \n23  number  of  out-of-circuit  decisions  where  incarcerated  plaintiffs  lost  individual  Eighth \n24  Amendment  deliberate  indifference  claims  regarding  HCV  treatment  in  an  apparent \n25  attempt to argue that Plaintiffs are currently being provided with constitutionally adequate \n26  medical care, and to buttress NDOC’s argument that each Plaintiff’s case necessarily \n27  requires individualized inquiry rendering class certification inappropriate. (Id. at 8-12.) The \n28  Court agrees with Plaintiffs. \n \n9 \n\n \n1  Though NDOC cites many—and exclusively—out-of-circuit decisions, the Ninth \n2  Circuit has rejected the argument that Eighth Amendment healthcare claims brought by \n3  incarcerated  people  are  inherently  case-specific  and  necessarily  turn  on  individual \n4  inquiries. See Parsons, 754 F.3d 657 at 675-85 (rejecting the argument).6 In Parsons, the \n5  Ninth  Circuit  characterized  this  argument  as  a  “sweeping  assertion”  that  “Eighth \n6  Amendment claims can never be brought in the form of a class action[,]” which the Ninth \n7  Circuit labelled a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the governing law. Id. at 675-76. The \n8  Ninth Circuit went on to state it has “repeatedly recognized that prison officials are \n9  constitutionally prohibited from being deliberately indifferent to policies and practices that \n10  expose inmates to a substantial risk of serious harm.” Id. at 677. And the Ninth Circuit \n11  went on to reject the same argument NDOC makes here by explaining that “every inmate \n12  suffers exactly the same constitutional injury when he is exposed to a single statewide [] \n13  policy or practice that creates a substantial risk of serious harm.” Id. at 678. The Court \n14  must follow Parsons and thus reject NDOC’s argument. \n15  Indeed, NDOC’s argument is particularly unpersuasive because the facts of this \n16  proposed  class  may  weigh  even  more  strongly  in  favor  of  finding  the  commonality \n17  requirement  satisfied  than  the  facts  supporting  the  Ninth  Circuit’s  holding  that  the \n18  commonality requirement was satisfied in Parsons. Specifically, there is no dispute that \n19  Plaintiffs challenge a single, written policy—MD 219—which dictates care for HCV-positive \n20  inmates in NDOC’s custody. (ECF Nos. 11 at 5-7, 13-14, 19 at 2-4, 3 n.2.) In Parsons, the \n21  Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s certification of an Eighth Amendment deliberate \n22  indifference to medical needs class of people incarcerated in Arizona’s prison system that \n23  challenged “10 policies and practices to which all members of the certified class are \n24  exposed.” Parsons, 754 F.3d at 679. And at least one of these policies was unwritten. See \n25  id. Thus, logically, members of this proposed class—who challenge a single written \n26  policy—have more in common than the members of the class certified in Parsons.  \n27 \n \n28    6NDOC’s brief does not address Parsons (ECF No. 19), even though Plaintiffs rely \non it throughout their brief (ECF No. 11), and it is on-point, binding precedent.  \n \n10 \n\n \n1  Further, all Plaintiffs allege they would benefit from DAA treatment but have been \n2  denied access to it under MD 219—with the exception of Scott Bedard, who alleges that \n3  he has been irreparably harmed because NDOC refused to treat him with DAAs for about \n4  two years. (ECF No. 11 at 7-11.) Indeed, Plaintiffs’ essential contention is that the medical \n5  standard  of  care  requires  nearly  all  HCV-positive  people  to  receive  DAA  treatment \n6  immediately—which is also more effective when used before people get too sick—but \n7  NDOC continues to use a tiered approach to care in MD 219 where only the sickest people \n8  get DAA treatment. (Id. at 4-7, 13.) Those who are not as sick have to basically wait to get \n9  sicker. (Id. at 5-6.) But waiting to get sicker causes issues like Mr. Bedard’s, who alleges \n10  that “delayed approval of DAA treatment has led to chronic conditions associated with \n11  chronic HCV, including Type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism.” (ECF No. 11 at 11.) And \n12  more importantly for purposes of the Motion, all Plaintiffs are similarly situated in that they \n13  would benefit, or would have benefitted, from receiving DAAs sooner than MD 219 would \n14  allow.7  \n15  The Court finds that the commonality requirement is satisfied here. \n16  3.  Typicality \n17  The commonality and typicality requirements, though distinct, tend to merge in \n18  many cases. Both requirements aid courts in determining whether maintaining a class is \n19  feasible and “whether the named plaintiff’s claim and the class claims are so interrelated \n20  that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their \n21  absence.” Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5. The question a court must ask when evaluating \n22  typicality is “whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is \n23  based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class \n24 \n25   \n  7Plaintiffs also share common anxiety related to the fact they know they would \n26  benefit from DAA treatment, but are being denied DAA treatment. (ECF No. 11 at 7-11.) \nThis further weighs in favor of finding the commonality prerequisite satisfied. The Court \n27  also finds this argument plausible. Being told you are sick, will get sicker, and there is a \ndrug you can take that would cure you, but you cannot have it until you get sicker, could \n28  produce significant anxiety. And it is unsurprising that all Plaintiffs and proposed class \nmembers would share this anxiety. \n \n11 \n\n \n1  members have been injured by the same course of conduct.” Ellis, 657 F.3d at 984 \n2  (quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)). Claims need \n3  not be absolutely identical; they need only be “reasonably co-extensive with those of \n4  absent class members[.]” Meyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assocs., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1042 \n5  (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998)). \n6  As to this prerequisite, Plaintiffs argue that the “proposed class should be certified \n7  because the named plaintiffs are and have been subject to the same policies or practices \n8  that have denied or delayed DAA treatment in accordance with the standard of care.” (ECF \n9  No. 11 at 15.) Defendants counter by reiterating that the constitutionality of MD 219 as \n10  applied depends on the specific facts of each individual Plaintiff’s case, and then move on \n11  to argue that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim because the medical care the NDOC provides \n12  to each Plaintiff in line with MD 219 is constitutionally adequate. (ECF No. 19 at 13-15.) \n13  The Court again agrees with Plaintiffs. \n14  NDOC’s merits argument misses the mark. “Rule 23 grants courts no license to \n15  engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage.” Parsons, 754 F.3d at \n16  676 n.19 (quotation and quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court will not delve too deeply \n17  into NDOC’s argument that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim at this stage. (ECF No. 19 at 13-\n18  15.) As to NDOC’s argument that Plaintiffs are not typical because the constitutionality of \n19  MD 219 depends on the specific facts of each case, it “does not matter that the named \n20  plaintiffs may have in the past suffered varying injuries or that they may currently have \n21  different health care needs; Rule 23(a)(3) requires only that their claims be ‘typical’ of the \n22  class, not that they be identically positioned to each other or to every class member.” \n23  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 686. Thus, the Court rejects NDOC’s argument that the typicality \n24  requirement is not satisfied here. \n25  To the contrary, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs their claims are typical of the \n26  proposed class. (ECF No. 11 at 14-15.) Like the proposed class, each Plaintiff has either \n27  been denied or delayed DAA treatment under MD 219. (Id. at 7-11 (describing the claims \n28  of  each  Plaintiff),  12  (presenting  the  proposed  class  definition),  14-15  (making  this \n \n12 \n\n \n1  argument).) All Plaintiffs allege MD 219 violates their Eighth Amendment rights. (Id. at 14-\n2  15.) And there can be no real dispute that both the named Plaintiffs and all potential class \n3  members are subject to MD 219 because they are in NDOC’s custody. (Id. at 15.) Further, \n4  all named Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class allege that they were denied \n5  appropriate treatment for their HCV in violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. (Id.) \n6  Thus, “Plaintiffs’ claims are based on the same legal theories as the class’s claims, and \n7  Plaintiffs are not in a markedly different factual position than other class members (at least \n8  not in a sense that would be relevant for purposes of their claims).” Hoffer v. Jones, 323 \n9  F.R.D. 694, 699 (N.D. Fla. 2017) (finding the typicality requirement was satisfied in an \n10  order certifying a class of HCV-positive incarcerated people).  \n11  The Court therefore finds the typicality requirement is satisfied. \n12  4.  Adequacy of Representation \n13  The adequacy of representation is considered under Rule 23(a)(4) and Rule 23(g). \n14  See Baumann v. Chase Inv. Servs. Corp., 747 F.3d 1117, 1122-23 (9th Cir. 2014) (noting \n15  that  “named  plaintiff’s  and  class  counsel’s  ability  to  fairly  and  adequately  represent \n16  unnamed  [plaintiffs]”  are  “critical  requirements  in  federal  class  actions  under  Rules \n17  23(a)(4) and (g)”). To determine legal adequacy, the Court must resolve two questions: \n18  “‘(1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class \n19  members and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously \n20  on behalf of the class?’” In re Hyundai & Kia Fuel Econ. Litig., 926 F.3d 539, 566 (9th Cir. \n21  2019) (citing Hanlon, 150 F.3d at 1020). \n22  Plaintiffs argue this prerequisite is satisfied because Plaintiffs are similarly situated, \n23  both amongst themselves and to other proposed class members, and because they have \n24  no interests antagonistic to the class. (ECF No. 11 at 16.) Plaintiffs also argue proposed \n25  class counsel are adequate representatives because they have extensive experience with \n26  complex and civil rights litigation. (Id.) NDOC does not appear to dispute that proposed \n27  class counsel are adequate, but argues that the named Plaintiffs have failed to show they \n28  are members of the proposed class with legitimate claims because Plaintiffs “have failed \n \n13 \n\n \n1  to submit medical records showing that their Hepatitis C condition is serious and that an \n2  alleged delay in their medical treatment is causing harm.” (ECF No. 19 at 16.) The Court \n3  again agrees with Plaintiffs. \n4  NDOC’s argument appears to go to typicality, not to adequacy of representation. \n5  Further, Plaintiffs’ failure to submit medical records does not necessarily show their \n6  interests are adverse to the members of the proposed class—the inquiry relevant to this \n7  prerequisite. If anything, it could only show Plaintiffs may not be able to prevail on the \n8  merits of their claims. But they are not required to prevail on the merits at this stage. See \n9  Parsons, 754 F.3d at 676 n.19. In addition, NDOC’s argument that the named Plaintiffs \n10  are not themselves members of their proposed class is really an argument that their claims \n11  are not typical of the proposed class. But the Court has already found Plaintiffs satisfy the \n12  typicality  requirement—and  rejected  NDOC’s arguments  in  doing  so.  Thus,  NDOC’s \n13  argument on the adequacy of representation prong is unpersuasive.8 \n14  As Plaintiffs argue, each of the named Plaintiffs has individually challenged the \n15  same policy being challenged in this litigation. And based on their allegations, they are \n16  part of the proposed class. Each named Plaintiff is in NDOC’s custody, alleges he or she \n17  has been diagnosed with chronic HCV, and alleges that he or she is an appropriate \n18  candidate for DAA treatment under the applicable medical standard of care, but has been \n19  denied or delayed DAA treatment. (ECF No. 11 at 7-11, 16.) Thus, Plaintiffs’ interests do \n20  not appear adverse to the potential class members.  \n21 \n \n22    8As legal support for its argument, NDOC quotes Sprague v. Gen. Motors Corp., \n133 F.3d 388, 397 (6th Cir. 1998). (ECF No. 19 at 16.) But the quote from Sprague—which \n23  of course does not bind this Court—does not apply here. In the quoted passage, the Sixth \nCircuit declines to disturb a district court’s decision not to certify a proposed class after \n24  that district court had rejected the primary claim of the named plaintiffs of the proposed \nclass. Sprague, 133 F.3d at 397. But this Court has not already rejected Plaintiffs’ primary \n25  claim. Plaintiffs may be able to prevail on their Eighth Amendment claim. The Court has \nnot  yet  ruled.  Moreover,  Sprague  only  addressed  the  commonality  and  typicality \n26  requirements of Rule 23(a). See id. (“[W]e shall confine our analysis to the commonality \nand typicality requirements[.]”). Thus, NDOC’s reliance on Sprague is misplaced in the \n27  portion of its brief regarding adequacy of representation. Sprague is also an ERISA case, \nand was merely affirming a district court’s decision not to certify a class under an abuse \n28  of discretion review. See id.; see also id.  at 392 (mentioning ERISA). In sum, Sprague \ndoes not support NDOC’s argument here.   \n \n14 \n\n \n1  There also appears to be no dispute that Plaintiff’s proposed class counsel are \n2  adequate representatives of the proposed class. (Id. at 16; see also ECF No. 19 at 16 \n3  (lacking  any  argument  about  counsel);  see  also  ECF  Nos.  11-3,  11-4  (listing  the \n4  qualifications of proposed class counsel).) \n5  The Court thus finds Plaintiffs satisfy the adequacy of representation requirement. \n6  C. Rule 23(b) Requirements \n7  As noted, Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2). (ECF No. 11 at 2, 12, 16-\n8  18.) The primary role of Rule 23(b)(2) “has always been the certification of civil rights class \n9  actions.” Parsons, 754 F.3d at 686. “[C]ourts have repeatedly invoked it to certify classes \n10  of  inmates  seeking  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  for  alleged  widespread  Eighth \n11  Amendment violations in prison systems[.]” Id. \n12  Plaintiffs rely on Parsons in arguing the proposed class satisfies Rule 23(b)(2), and \n13  point to four out-of-circuit federal district court decisions where other courts certified \n14  classes of incarcerated people contending that inadequate treatment of HCV violated their \n15  Eighth Amendment rights under Rule 23(b)(2). (ECF No. 11 at 16-17.) Plaintiffs also argue \n16  that the “proposed class satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) because the interpretation and relief from \n17  the Defendants’ policies and practices would apply to all members of the class.” (Id. at 17-\n18  18.) NDOC replies that Rule 23(b)(2) does not apply to this case because each Plaintiff’s \n19  case requires “individualized inquiry to determine whether specific injunctive relief is \n20  warranted at all[.]” (ECF No. 19 at 17.) The Court again agrees with Plaintiffs. \n21  Through MD 219, NDOC has acted on grounds that apply generally to the whole \n22  class. Plaintiffs primarily seek uniform injunctive relief from MD 219. (ECF No. 10 at 22-\n23  23.) If MD 219 is unconstitutional, final injunctive relief applying to the entire class would \n24  be  appropriate.  Thus,  certification  of  the  proposed  class  under  Rule  23(b)(2)  is \n25  appropriate. See Parsons, 754 F.3d at 688-89. And contrary to NDOC’s argument, while \n26  MD 219 “may not affect every member of the proposed class . . . in exactly the same way, \n27  [it] constitute[s] shared grounds for all inmates in the proposed class[.]” Id. at 688. The \n28  Court is also persuaded that certifying a Rule 23(b)(2) class is appropriate here in part \n \n15 \n\n \n1  because several other district courts have done so under similar circumstances. (ECF No. \n2  11 at 17 (citing those class certification decisions).) Finally, even though the named \n3  Plaintiffs seek damages (ECF No. 10 at 23), “a plaintiff’s individual claim for damages \n4  separate from the claims of the class [does not defeat] certification under Rule 23(b)(2).” \n5  Postawko, 2017 WL 3185155, at *16 (emphasis in original). \n6  Having found that the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a) and \n7  Rule 23(b)(2), the Court will exercise its discretion and certify Plaintiffs’ proposed class. \n8  Though NDOC generally argues that class certification is unnecessary because a single \n9  plaintiff could facially challenge the constitutionality of MD 219 (ECF No. 19 at 17-20), \n10  “even if class certification is unnecessary here, this Court chooses to exercise its discretion \n11  by allowing the case to proceed as a class action.” Hoffer, 323 F.R.D. at 700. Like the \n12  other district courts whose decisions Plaintiffs rely on their briefing (ECF No. 11 at 17), the \n13  Court is persuaded a class action is the best way to litigate the constitutionality of MD 219 \n14  and determine whether Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief specifying how NDOC \n15  should treat HCV-positive people in its custody. The Court includes the definition of the \n16  class, along with the class issues to be litigated, infra in Section V.  \n17  D. Class Counsel \n18  The  Court  now  briefly  addresses  the  uncontested  matter  of  appointing  class \n19  counsel. (ECF No. 19 (declining to attack the qualifications of proposed class counsel).) \n20  “Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court that certifies a class must appoint class \n21  counsel.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1). “Under Rule 23(g)(1), the Court considers four factors \n22  when appointing counsel: (1) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating \n23  potential claims in the action; (2) counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other \n24  complex litigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action; (3) counsel’s knowledge \n25  of the applicable law; and (4) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the \n26  class.” Greene v. Jacob Transportation Servs., LLC, Case No. 2:09-cv-00466-GMN-CWH, \n27  2017 WL 4158605, at *6 (D. Nev. Sept. 19, 2017). \n28 \n \n16 \n\n \n1  Lead proposed class counsel Adam Hosmer-Henner and Margaret A. McLetchie \n2  were appointed through the Court’s pro bono program to represent individual Plaintiffs in \n3  various cases that the Court consolidated for pretrial purposes back in October 2019. (ECF \n4  No. 1.) Since that time, they and their teams have been working diligently to represent \n5  Plaintiffs’ interests  pro  bono,  including by preparing and  filing  the  Motion.  They are \n6  sufficiently experienced in handling complex litigation, and are sufficiently familiar with the \n7  applicable law. (ECF Nos. 11-3, 11-4 (detailing their qualifications).) They both represent \n8  that they will commit sufficient resources to this litigation. (ECF Nos. 11-3 at 4-5, 11-4 at \n9  3.) The Court will therefore appoint Adam Hosmer-Henner, Margaret A. McLetchie, and \n10  their chosen litigation teams as class counsel. \n11  V.  CONCLUSION \n12  The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases \n13  not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines \n14  that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the motion before \n15  the Court. \n16  It is therefore ordered that Plaintiff’s motion to certify class (ECF No. 11) is granted.  \n17  It is further ordered that the Court certifies a class of all persons: (a) who are or will \n18  be in the legal custody of NDOC; (b) who have been incarcerated for at least 21 days and \n19  have at least 12 weeks remaining on their sentence; (c) who have been diagnosed with \n20  chronic HCV and are candidates for DAA treatment pursuant to the proper medical \n21  standard of care; and (d) for whom DAA treatment has been or will be denied, withheld, \n22  or delayed based on policies or considerations that deviate from the proper medical \n23  standard of care. \n24  It is further ordered that the Court certifies the following issues for class litigation: \n25  (1) whether HCV is a serious medical need; (2) whether NDOC’s policy and practice of \n26  not providing HCV treatment constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical needs \n27  in violation of the Eight Amendment; (3) whether NDOC has knowingly failed to provide \n28  the necessary staging of HCV patients in accordance with the prevailing medical standard \n \n17 \n\n \n1  of care, including the pretreatment testing to determine the severity of the disease; (4) \n2  whether NDOC has knowingly employed policies and practices that unjustifiably delay or \n3  deny  treatment  for  HCV;  (5)  whether  NDOC  has  permitted  cost  considerations  to \n4  improperly interfere with the treatment of HCV; (6) whether HCV is a disability under the \n5  ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act); (7) whether medical services in prison are a \n6  program or service under the ADA; and (8) whether Defendant has discriminated against \n7  NDOC inmates with HCV on the basis of their disability by categorically denying them \n8  medical treatment, while providing treatment for other diseases and conditions.9  \n9  It is further ordered that Plaintiffs are hereby named class representatives for this \n10  class. \n11  It is further ordered that Plaintiffs’ counsel are appointed as class counsel as \n12  specified herein. \n13  It is further ordered that the parties must address the issues of notice under Fed. \n14  R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2) with Magistrate Judge Baldwin. \n15  DATED THIS 18th day of February 2020. \n16   \n \n17   \n                         \n18              MIRANDA M.

NDOC did not \npropose another set of issues, or otherwise argue against these being the class issues. \n28  (ECF No. 19.) The Court also agrees this is a reasonable set of class issues. The Court \ntherefore adopts them.  \n \n18 ",

SUMMARY \n12  Plaintiffs, a class of people incarcerated and in the custody of Defendant Nevada \n13  Department of Corrections (“NDOC”) infected with the Hepatitis-C virus (“HCV”), allege \n14  that NDOC violated their Eighth Amendment rights by declining to treat them with direct-\n15  acting antiviral (“DAA”) drugs, for non-medical reasons, under the then-effective version \n16  of NDOC’s Medical Directive Number 219 (“MD 219”). The Court previously certified \n17  Plaintiffs  as  a  class.  (ECF  No.  21  (“Certification  Order”).)  Plaintiffs  and  Defendant \n18  subsequently  reached  a  settlement  resulting  in  significantly  expanded  testing  and \n19  treatment of HCV within the NDOC system, in part through modifications to MD 219, and \n20  jointly moved for a preliminary approval of a consent decree (ECF No. 61), which the Court \n21  preliminarily approved (ECF No. 62). The Court then held a fairness hearing on the \n22  consent decree. (ECF No. 77 (“Fairness Hearing”).) Because the Court is convinced the \n23  proposed consent decree is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable, and as further \n24  explained below, the Court approves the proposed consent decree. \n25  II.  BACKGROUND \n26    The Court incorporates by reference the factual background it provided in the \n27  Certification Order, and does not recite it here. (ECF No. 21 at 2-5.) The Court further \n28  incorporates by reference the additional background Plaintiffs recited in their supplement \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 2 of 9\n \n1  submitted to the Court in preparation for the Fairness Hearing. (ECF No. 76 at 1-5.) At the \n2  Fairness Hearing, both Plaintiffs’ and Defendant’s counsel voiced their strong support for \n3  the Court’s approval of the consent decree. \n4  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n5  The Court must decide whether to approve the proposed consent decree before it \n6  has binding effect because a class action may not be dismissed or compromised without \n7  a court’s approval. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). “Although Rule 23(e) is silent respecting the \n8  standard by which a proposed settlement is to be evaluated, the universally applied \n9  standard is whether the settlement is fundamentally fair, adequate and reasonable.” Class \n10  Plaintiffs v. City of Seattle, 955 F.2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir. 1992) (citations and internal \n11  quotation marks omitted). Courts in the Ninth Circuit generally consider the following \n12  factors in determining whether the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable: \n13  (1) the strength of the plaintiff's case; (2) the risk, expense, complexity, and \nlikely duration of further litigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class action \n14 \nstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered in settlement; (5) the extent \nof discovery completed and the stage of the proceedings; (6) the experience \n15 \nand views of counsel; (7) the presence of a government participant; (8) the \nreaction of the class members of the proposed settlement. \n16 \n17  Sinanyan  v.  Luxury  Suites  Int’l,  LLC,  Case  No.  2:15-cv-00225-GMN-VCF,  2018  WL \n18  813864, at *2 (D. Nev. Feb. 8, 2018) (citing In re Bluetooth, 654 F.3d 935, 946 (9th Cir. \n19  2011)). Courts often refer to these factors as the Churchill factors. See id. The Court will \n20  as well. \n21  IV.  DISCUSSION \n22    The Churchill factors favor the Court adopting the proposed consent decree. The \n23  Court  addresses  each  of  the  factors  below,  slightly  rephrased  to  match  Plaintiffs’ \n24  presentation in their supplement. (ECF No. 76.) But first, the Court makes one preliminary \n25  finding. The consent decree is effective upon entry of this order, despite the fact that the \n26  State of Nevada has only funded the first year of expanded HCV testing and treatment \n27  that NDOC agreed to as part of the consent decree at this point in time. More specifically, \n28  the Court asked several questions about ¶ 53 of the proposed consent decree at the \n \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 3 of 9\n \n1  Fairness Hearing, but the Court is satisfied by counsels’ responses to her questions. Said \n2  otherwise, the Court finds no conditions precedent prevent the Court from approving the \n3  proposed consent decree now.  \n4  A. Likelihood of Recovery or Success \n5    As the Court noted in the Certification Order, Plaintiffs challenge a single, written \n6  policy they contend worked the same constitutional injury upon them. (ECF No. 21 at 10.) \n7  They also all allege they would have benefitted from DAA treatment, but NDOC refused \n8  them treatment for cost or other non-medical reasons. The governing Ninth Circuit caselaw \n9  therefore suggests Plaintiffs would have prevailed if this litigation continued.1 See Parsons \n10  v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 678 (9th Cir. 2014) (stating that every plaintiff suffers the same \n11  constitutional injury when they are exposed to the same policy); Peralta v. Dillard, 744 \n12  F.3d 1076, 1083 (9th Cir. 2014) (“Lack of resources is not a defense to a claim for \n13  prospective relief because prison officials may be compelled to expand the pool of existing \n14  resources  in  order  to  remedy  continuing  Eighth  Amendment  violations.”)  (citations \n15  omitted). That said, litigation is necessarily uncertain, and as Plaintiffs point out, at least \n16  one district court outside the Ninth Circuit found a similar policy did not violate the \n17  constitutional rights of incarcerated people in Tennessee. (ECF No. 76 at 5-6.) But overall, \n18  this factor favors approving the proposed consent decree.  \n19  B. Amount and Nature of Discovery or Evidence  \n20  The parties conducted written discovery, and Plaintiffs retained an expert who \n21  reviewed some of the written discovery, which informed Plaintiffs’ approach to negotiating \n22  the revised version of MD 219 the parties agreed to as part of the proposed consent \n23  decree. (Id. at 6.) Further, Plaintiffs “do not believe that further discovery from Defendants \n24  would have resulted in a materially different settlement as the settlement was based on \n25 \n26 \n \n27    1Indeed, this Court noted the potential serious constitutional issues with a prior \nversion of MD 219 in deciding to refer a case challenging such policy to the Court’s Pro \n28  Bono Program for appointment of counsel. See Griffith v. Aranas, Case No. 3:16-cv-309-\nMMD-VPC, ECF No. 47 (D. Nev. Jan. 9, 2018). \n \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 4 of 9\n \n1  publicly available medical documents and expert input.” (Id.) Thus, to the extent relevant, \n2  this factor also favors approving the proposed consent decree. \n3  C. Settlement Terms and Conditions \n4  As Plaintiffs’ counsel approached this factor, it contains several important sub-\n5  factors. (Id. at 6-9.) The Court agrees with Plaintiffs’ counsel that this factor overall favors \n6  adopting the proposed consent decree.  \n7  But more specifically, the proposed consent decree will benefit the class in two \n8  major ways: (a) significantly expanded testing and treatment of HCV within NDOC facilities \n9  on an expedited timeline; and (b) it is accompanied by an improved version of MD 219, in \n10  the sense that the revised policy will result in more incarcerated people being given access \n11  to HCV treatment, because it substantially limits NDOC officials’ discretion to deny or \n12  discontinue HCV treatment for non-medical reasons. And as Plaintiffs’ counsel pointed out \n13  at the Fairness Hearing, the two benefits work together. NDOC’s commitment to treat \n14  particular numbers of incarcerated people each year, and always at a rate that exceeds \n15  new cases, reinforces that the practical effect of the new version of MD 219 is that fewer \n16  incarcerated people will be denied HCV treatment for non-medical reasons. \n17  Moreover, and as Plaintiffs’ counsel outlined at the Fairness Hearing, the revised \n18  version  of  MD  219  agreed  to  as  part of  the  consent  decree  contains  a  number  of \n19  improvements over the prior version of the policy, which will benefit class members, and \n20  weighs in favor of the Court finding the proposed consent decree is fundamentally fair. \n21  (ECF Nos. 77 (Fairness Hearing minutes), 78 (demonstrative exhibit showing a side-by-\n22  side comparison between the version of MD 219 agreed to as part of the proposed consent \n23  decree  and  the  prior  version  (adopted  in November 2019),2  with  changes  indicated \n24  through highlighting).) The specific changes to MD 219 the Court finds are beneficial to all \n25 \n26   \n  2NDOC made additional (and mostly minor) changes to MD 219 in January 2020. \n27  (ECF No. 76-5 at 10.) Plaintiffs’ counsel explained that he used the November 2019 \nversion for comparison purposes mainly due to the quality of the copy of the January 2020 \n28  version in their records. \n \n \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 5 of 9\n \n1  class members are: (1) it takes case-by-case discretion away from NDOC officials to treat \n2  people with HCV differently for non-medical reasons; (2) it provides that all inmates not \n3  previously tested will be tested (in the prior version of MD 219, incarcerated people were \n4  only tested at intake); (3) it adds guidance for when an inmate should be retested (the \n5  prior version did not provide for retesting);  (4) many more  people  will  receive  DAA \n6  treatment as part of NDOC’s commitments reflected in the revised policy; (5) all HCV-\n7  positive inmates will receive treatment, regardless of their substance abuse, disciplinary \n8  history, or any other non-medical reasons for treatment; (6) it alters the priority system \n9  based on APRI scores such that everyone in priority 1 receives treatment within 6 months, \n10  and then people in 2 or 3 receive treatment soon thereafter; (7) it provides that all people \n11  who have more than 120 days left in their sentence receive treatment, instead of only \n12  people who have a year or more left of their sentence; (8) it changes NDOC’s policy such \n13  that the maximum possible consequence for noncompliance someone can face is that \n14  they will get treatment at the end of their particular priority level instead of no treatment at \n15  all; (9) it clarifies that a HCV-positive person can now only be denied DAA treatment if a \n16  doctor  determines  it  is  not  medically  recommended;  (10)  it  modernizes  the \n17  contraindications for treatment section to make them more clear, grounded in medical \n18  science, and otherwise improves them by removing nonmedical reasons for denying \n19  treatment; (11) it provides for treatment of boarders from other jurisdictions regardless of \n20  whether that jurisdiction will take financial responsibility for the treatment (before boarders \n21  would only receive treatment if their sending jurisdiction agreed to pay for their treatment). \n22  (ECF No. 78 (illustrating these changes using highlighting).) In sum, the Court finds the \n23  new version of MD 219 agreed to as part of the consent decree will substantially benefit \n24  all class members, and thus contributes to the Court’s finding that the proposed consent \n25  decree is fundamentally fair.  \n26  Plaintiffs’ counsel also addresses the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees they \n27  seek for litigating this case, and for ongoing monitoring while the consent decree remains \n28  in effect, under this factor. (ECF No. 76 at 8.) Plaintiffs’ counsel took this case, and several \n \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 6 of 9\n \n1  individual cases later consolidated for discovery purposes into this one, pro bono. They \n2  did not seek any fees in negotiating the initial settlement—to facilitate a settlement that \n3  would benefit the class members. (Id.) Now, NDOC has agreed to pay them $160,000 \n4  (along with documented costs), and both the executive and legislative branches of the \n5  Nevada state government have signed off on paying them that amount. (Id.)  \n6  The attorneys’ fees provided for in the proposed consent decree are more than \n7  reasonable. Plaintiffs’ counsel have already litigated this case pro bono for over a year, \n8  and agree to monitor NDOC’s compliance with the proposed consent decree for four years \n9  without any seeking recovery of additional fees for monitoring. (ECF No. 61-1 at 9-10, 15.) \n10  Plaintiffs’ counsel also won their motion for class certification, in which the Court found \n11  them adequate representatives and appointed them class counsel. (ECF No. 21 at 13-15.) \n12  The fees amount provided in the proposed consent decree is more than reasonable in \n13  view of Plaintiffs’ counsels’ competence and the significant amount of work they have \n14  performed—and have agreed to keep performing—in this case.  \n15  D. Recommendation and Experience of Counsel \n16  As noted, the Court previously found that both Plaintiffs’ counsel and the proposed \n17  class representatives were adequate representatives of the class. (Id.) Plaintiffs’ counsel \n18  now recommend the Court approve the proposed consent decree. (ECF No. 76 at 9.) This \n19  factor thus also favors approving the proposed consent decree.  \n20  E.  Future Expense and Likely Duration of Litigation \n21  “In most situations, unless the settlement is clearly inadequate, its acceptance and \n22  approval are preferable to lengthy and expensive litigation with uncertain results.” Riker v. \n23  Gibbons, Case No. 3:08-cv-00115-LRH, 2010 WL 4366012, at *4 (D. Nev. Oct. 28, 2010) \n24  (quoting 4 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 11:50 (4th ed. \n25  2002));  see  also  generally  id.  (approving proposed  consent  decree  in  lawsuit about \n26  inadequate medical care within an NDOC facility). That is the case here. There is no real \n27  question this case would take some time to get to trial, and the expense would accordingly \n28  be much greater than if the Court permits the parties to settle now. Further, as Plaintiffs’ \n \n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 7 of 9\n \n1  counsel points out, given the number of incarcerated people Defendant is agreeing to treat \n2  within the next few years as part of the proposed consent decree, it is likely everyone in \n3  NDOC custody currently suffering from HCV will be effectively cured before this case \n4  would go to trial. (ECF No. 76 at 9.) This factor also favors approving the proposed consent \n5  decree. \n6  F.  Recommendation of Neutral Parties \n7  To the extent this factor is relevant, Plaintiffs’ counsel notes that Nevada Governor \n8  Steve Sisolak and Nevada State Assemblywoman Daniele Monroe-Moreno made public \n9  statements in support of the proposed consent decree in the process of approving the \n10  allocation of funds so that Defendant can comply with its side of the agreement. (Id.) \n11  Plaintiffs’ counsel further represents their retained expert would testify that the proposed \n12  consent decree is beneficial to the class. (Id.) The Court agrees that these statements \n13  favor approving the proposed consent decree. \n14  G. Number of Objectors and Nature of Objections \n15  Plaintiffs reported that 13 people objected out of the estimated 2,400 members of \n16  the class. (Id. at 9-10.) These individuals retain their right to assert their individual claims. \n17  Thus, their objections do not substantially detract from the fairness of the proposed \n18  consent decree. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ counsel generally observes that most people who \n19  requested to opt-out appear to have done so to ensure they can maintain their claims for \n20  damages in their individual cases. (Id.) In fact, because Plaintiffs seek only injunctive relief, \n21  individuals who fall within the class would still have the right to assert their own claims for \n22  damages regardless of whether they opt-out. The Court thus shares Plaintiffs’ counsel’s \n23  impression of the nature of the opt-out requests. And because all class members can \n24  maintain their individual damages actions even without opting out of the class, the Court \n25  does find that these opt-out requests reflect adversely on the fairness of the proposed \n26  consent decree. Accordingly, this factor also favors approving the proposed consent \n27  decree.  \n28  /// \n \n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 8 of 9\n \n1  H. Presence of Good Faith and Absence of Collusion \n2  In overseeing this case, the Court has observed substantial good faith on both \n3  sides,  but  no  evidence  of  collusion.  Moreover,  the  proposed  consent  decree  was \n4  negotiated  over  multiple  days  of  arms-length  settlement  conferences  facilitated  by \n5  Magistrate Judge William G. Cobb, along with some associated status conferences. (ECF \n6  Nos. 50, 54, 55, 59, 66.) Magistrate Judge Carla L. Baldwin also presided over a number \n7  of hearings between the parties. (ECF Nos. 2, 8, 31, 36, 47, 65.) Neither Judge Cobb nor \n8  Judge Baldwin indicated to the Court there was any collusion. Plaintiffs also state the \n9  parties negotiated in good faith, but without collusion. (ECF No. 76 at 10.) In sum, the \n10  proposed consent decree is the product of arms-length negotiations facilitated by the \n11  Court. This factor thus also favors granting the proposed consent decree. \n12  All of the Churchill factors favor the Court adopting the proposed consent decree to \n13  varying degrees. Having considered these factors, the Court finds the proposed consent \n14  decree is fundamentally fair, adequate, and reasonable. The Court accepts and adopts it \n15  in full. As the Court did on the record at the Fairness Hearing, the Court commends all \n16  parties involved in this litigation for reaching a collaborative solution that will effectively \n17  cure many sick, incarcerated people who were previously denied HCV treatment—along \n18  with HCV-positive people who will enter NDOC’s custody in the future. \n19  V.  CONCLUSION \n20  The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases \n21  not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines \n22  that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the issues before \n23  the Court. \n24  It is therefore ordered that the parties’ proposed consent decree (ECF No. 61-1) is \n25  accepted and adopted in full.  \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 79   Filed 10/29/20   Page 9 of 9\n \n1  The Clerk of Court is directed to administratively close this case upon entry of the \n2  consent decree. \n3  DATED THIS 29th Day of October 2020. \n4   \n \n5   \n                         \n6              MIRANDA M.

Plaintiffs Marty Scott Fitzgerald, Elizabeth Carley, Donald Savage, Howard White, \n23 \nCarl  Olsen,  Scott  Bedard,  Stephen  Ciolino  and  Mitchell  Fields  (“Plaintiffs”),  on  behalf  of \n24 \nthemselves and others similarly situated, bring this class action lawsuit pursuant to the Court’s \n25 \nOrder (ECF No. 1). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, and to certify a class seeking \n26 \nthe same, from the State of Nevada’s practice of withholding or delaying curative treatment to \n27 \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 2 of 26\n \n1  inmates with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (“HCV”) without medical justification. This curative \n2  treatment is commonly referred to as direct-acting antiviral treatment (“DAA”).  \n3  2.  After the consolidation of this litigation on October 9, 2019, and less than three \n4  weeks prior to the date set for the filing of this pleading and the hearing that was set in this matter, \n5  the Nevada Department of Corrections amended its medical policies to purportedly expand access \n6  to curative HCV treatment. Exhibit 1, Medical Directive 219, Eff. Nov. 15, 2019. This appears to \n7  be some progress as the revised Medical Directive 219 (“MD 219”) now requires HCV testing for \n8  all inmates during the intake process and seems to provide access to HCV treatment without some \n9  of the previous barriers that existed. However, the new MD 219 only represents theoretical \n10  improvement. There is not a medical justification for delaying curative treatment, through the \n11  various priority categories established in MD 219, as the medical standard of care is to provide \n12  this curative treatment to individuals in any of the three listed categories.   \n13  3.  HCV is a widespread contagious liver disease and Defendants are aware that \n14  withholding or delaying curative DAA treatment can lead to irreversible liver damage, prolonged \n15  suffering, and death.  \n16  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17  4.  Plaintiffs bring this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Eighth and Fourteenth \n18  Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 \n19  U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendments to the \n20  U.S. Constitution via 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \n21  5.  Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3).  \n22  6.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1) and (2), because the events that gave \n23  rise to this cause of action—the formulation and execution of the versions of MD 219—occurred \n24  in Nevada and the Defendants reside in Nevada. \n25  7.  Plaintiffs seek a preliminary and permanent injunction pursuant to Federal Rule of \n26  Civil Procedure 65.  \n27  // \n28  // \n \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 3 of 26\n \n1  PLAINTIFFS \n2  1.  Plaintiff  Elizabeth  Carley  is  currently  incarcerated  at  the  Florence  McClure \n3  Women’s Correctional Center Facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, where medical care is administered \n4  by Defendants. Ms. Carley is in the legal custody and control of NDOC and has been diagnosed \n5  with  chronic HCV. Defendants  have repeatedly and continuously denied or withheld DAA \n6  treatment for her, even though she was and continues to be a candidate for DAA treatment under \n7  the medical standard of care.  \n8  2.  Plaintiff Marty Fitzgerald is currently incarcerated under sentence at the High \n9  Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nevada where medical care is administered by Defendants. \n10  He is in the legal custody and control of Nevada Department of Corrections (“NDOC”) and has \n11  been diagnosed with chronic HCV.

Plaintiff Scott Bedard is currently incarcerated at the Lovelock Correctional Center \n9  in Lovelock, Nevada where medical care is administered by Defendants.  He is in the legal custody \n10  and control of NDOC and has been diagnosed with chronic HCV. Defendants have repeatedly and \n11  continuously denied or withheld DAA treatment from him, even though he was and continues to \n12  be a candidate for DAA treatment under the medical standard of care. \n13  8.  Plaintiff Don Savage is currently incarcerated at the Northern Nevada Correctional \n14  Center in Carson City, Nevada where medical care is administered by Defendants.  He is in the \n15  legal custody and control of NDOC and has been diagnosed with chronic HCV. Defendants have \n16  repeatedly and continuously denied or withheld DAA treatment from him, even though he was and \n17  continues to be a candidate for DAA treatment under the medical standard of care. \n18  9.  Plaintiffs have exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \n19  DEFENDANTS \n20  10.  The  State of Nevada ex rel.  Nevada Department  of Corrections operates the \n21  correctional facilities where all of the Plaintiffs are currently located. The Nevada Department of \n22  Corrections is an executive agency within the Nevada government.  \n23  11.  Nevada Department of Corrections Director Charles Daniels was appointed by \n24  Governor Sisolak on December 2, 2019 and is sued in his official capacity. In this role, he has \n25  oversight and authority over all aspects of the management and governance of NDOC. He has \n26  overall responsibility for NDOC budget and for ensuring the delivery of necessary medical care \n27  for the serious medical needs of all individuals held in NDOC’s correctional facilities and \n28  contracted correctional facilities. He has participated in decision-making regarding NDOC’s \n \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 5 of 26\n \n1  chronic HCV policy, communicated with medical professionals and others regarding NDOC’s \n2  chronic HCV policy, and has been involved in creating the policy and policies that withhold DAA \n3  treatment based on non-medical considerations. At all relevant times with respect to the actions \n4  alleged herein, Defendant Daniels has acted and will continue to act under color of state law. \n5  12.  Former Nevada Department of Corrections Acting Director Harold Wickham is \n6  sued in his official capacity. In that role, which he held for parts of 2019, he has oversight and \n7  authority  over  all  aspects  of  the  management  and  governance  of  NDOC.  He  has  overall \n8  responsibility for NDOC budget and for ensuring the delivery of necessary medical care for the \n9  serious medical needs of all individuals held in NDOC’s correctional facilities and contracted \n10  correctional facilities. He has participated in decision-making regarding NDOC’s chronic HCV \n11  policy, communicated with medical professionals and others regarding NDOC’s chronic HCV \n12  policy, and has been involved in creating the policy and policies that withhold DAA treatment \n13  based on non-medical considerations. At all relevant times with respect to the actions alleged \n14  herein, Defendant Wickham has acted and will continue to act under color of state law. \n15  13.  Former Nevada Department of Corrections Director James Dzurenda is sued in his \n16  official capacity. In that role, which he held until 2019, he had oversight and authority over all \n17  aspects of the management and governance of NDOC. He had overall responsibility for NDOC \n18  budget and for ensuring the delivery of necessary medical care for the serious medical needs of all \n19  individuals held  in  NDOC’s correctional facilities and  contracted  correctional  facilities. He \n20  participated in decision-making regarding NDOC’s chronic HCV policy, communicated with \n21  medical professionals and others regarding NDOC’s chronic HCV policy, and was involved in \n22  creating  the  policy  and  policies  that  withhold  DAA  treatment  based  on  non-medical \n23  considerations. At all relevant times with respect to the actions alleged herein, Defendant Dzurenda \n24  has acted and will continue to act under color of state law. \n25  14.  Defendants Romeo Aranas, M.D. and Michael Minev, M.D. are sued in their \n26  official capacities as the respective current and former Medical Directors for NDOC respectively. \n27  In these roles, they had oversight and authority over the delivery of necessary medical care for the \n28  serious medical needs of all individuals held in NDOC’s correctional facilities and contracted \n \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 6 of 26\n \n1  correctional facilities. They participated in developing the policy or practice that withholds or \n2  delays DAAs from hundreds of inmates and has proactively or constructively denied inmates \n3  access to DAAs under that policy. Defendant Minev directly signed and dated the current version \n4  of  MD  219.  They  participated  in  decisionmaking  regarding  NDOC’s  chronic  HCV  policy, \n5  communicated with medical professionals and others regarding NDOC’s chronic HCV policy, and \n6  were closely involved in creating the policy that withholds or delays DAA treatment based on non-\n7  medical considerations. At all relevant times with respect to the actions alleged herein, they acted \n8  and will continue to act under color of state law. \n9  15.  The Defendants have statutory authority to implement the relief sought in this \n10  Complaint.  \n11  GENERAL ALLEGATIONS \n12  16.  Hepatitis C is a blood-borne infectious disease, which is transmitted through \n13  exposure to infected blood.  \n14  17.  Hepatitis C is a growing public health crisis both in Nevada and throughout the \n15  United States. Approximately 1% of the population are living with HCV active in their bodies and \n16  the true prevalence is likely to be even higher. More than 20,000 people in the United States die \n17  each year due to liver disease caused by HCV, making it the deadliest infectious disease in our \n18  nation. Approximately 85% of individuals with HCV will develop chronic infection, which is \n19  typically characterized as a Hepatitis C infection that lasts longer than six months.  \n20  18.  Chronic HCV is a disease that damages the liver, with the potential to affect \n21  multiple other organs and bodily functions. The CDC reports approximately 40% of all those with \n22  chronic HCV will develop cirrhosis. For those with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, there is a 1-\n23  5% annual risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and a 3-6% annual risk of hepatic decompensation, \n24  for which the risk of death in the following year is 15-20% as well as HCV being the leading cause \n25  for liver transplant in the US.  \n26  19.  Individuals infected with chronic HCV suffer from a range of hepatic (affecting the \n27  liver) and extrahepatic (affecting other organ systems) symptoms.  \n28 \n \n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 7 of 26\n \n1  20.  A  common  hepatic  manifestation  of  chronic  HCV  infection  is  fibrosis,  the \n2  formation of scar tissue in the liver. This scarring of the liver ranges from mild to severe, with the \n3  most severe form of fibrosis being cirrhosis. As cirrhosis progresses, more scar tissue forms, \n4  making it difficult for the liver to function.  \n5  21.  Advanced scarring of the liver is associated with an increased risk of cancer. \n6  Cirrhosis is associated with increased rates of liver transplants and increased risk of death.  \n7  22.  Once individuals develop advanced liver disease they often require undergo cancer \n8  screening at regular intervals for the rest of their lives even after they are cured of their chronic \n9  HCV infection.  \n10  23.  A significant number of persons with chronic HCV who have no signs of fibrosis \n11  or mild fibrosis will still progress to cirrhosis in the absence of DAA treatment.  \n12  24.  Currently, there is no way to predict which newly infected patients will develop \n13  advanced liver disease.  \n14  25.  Liver damage is only one potentially significant consequence of chronic HCV \n15  infection.  \n16  26.  Chronic  HCV  may  have  extrahepatic  manifestations  that  affect  other  organ \n17  systems.  \n18  27.  Chronic  HCV  infection  is  associated  with  myocardial  infarction,  diabetes, \n19  decreased cognitive function, fatigue, joint  pain, depression, sore muscles, arthritis,  various \n20  cancers, decreased kidney function, certain types of rashes, and autoimmune disease. These \n21  extrahepatic manifestations, among others, can occur irrespective of the amount of fibrosis in the \n22  liver.  \n23  28.  Delay in treatment can cause irreversible damage to the liver and other vital organs. \n24  Because of the many benefits associated with successful HCV treatment, clinicians following the \n25  standard of care treat chronic HCV patients with antiviral therapy with the goal of achieving \n26  Sustained Virologic Response (SVR), preferably early in the course of their chronic HCV infection \n27  before the development of severe liver disease and other complications. SVR status means that the \n28  virus becomes virtually undetectable in a patient and is considered to be a de facto cure of the \n \n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 8 of 26\n \n1  infection. See U.S. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, FAQs about Sustained Virologic Response to \n2  Treatment  for  Hepatitis  C  (2015),  available  at  https://www.hepatitis.va.gov/pdf/sustained-\n3  virological-response.pdf.  \n4  29.  Liver  damage  and  scarring  related  to  chronic  HCV  infection  (“fibrosis”)  is \n5  measured  in  a  variety  of  methods.  In  addition  to  the  physical  exam  and  history,  medical \n6  professionals following the standard of care use a combination of other blood tests and imaging to \n7  determine the stage of liver damage caused by HCV.  \n8  30.  Metavir Fibrosis Score (“fibrosis score”) measures the degree of inflammation \n9  (activity grade A0 to A3) and the degree of fibrosis (Fibrosis State F0 to F4). A score of F0 \n10  represents  no fibrosis  (no scarring),  F1 is  portal  fibrosis without septa formation  (minimal \n11  scarring), F2 is portal fibrosis with few septa (intermediate scarring), F3 is numerous septa without \n12  cirrhosis (severe scarring), and F4 is cirrhosis. A parallel scale of measurement is known as “Ishak \n13  Stage,” named after one of the pathologists who developed it, and it quantifies fibrosis on an \n14  ascending scale of 0-6.  \n15  31.  Metavir Scores can be estimated using noninvasive serological testing as well as \n16  transient elastography. Liver biopsy is no longer considered the standard of care for staging liver \n17  disease. Beyond the limitations of the individual modalities of disease staging, it is important to \n18  understand that the progression of liver disease is not linear and therefore it is difficult to predict \n19  an individual’s progression through the stages of liver damage over time.  \n20  32.  Blood tests can provide an “APRI score” determined from a ratio derived from the \n21  level of an enzyme in the blood (AST) compared to the AST levels of healthy persons and the \n22  number of platelets in the infected person’s blood. “APRI” is an acronym for “AST to Platelet \n23  Ratio Index.” The APRI score provides an imprecise measure of fibrosis or cirrhosis. Generally, \n24  the lower the APRI score (in the scientific literature a cutoff of less than 0.5 is often used), the \n25  greater the negative predictive value (and ability to rule out cirrhosis), and the higher the value \n26  (the scientific literature often uses a measurement of greater than 1.5), the greater the positive \n27  predictive value (and ability to rule in cirrhosis); midrange values are less accurate and less helpful.  \n28 \n \n8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 9 of 26\n \n1  33.  Chronic HCV constitutes a serious medical need, regardless of the stage of fibrosis \n2  or disease severity. Defendants’ policies or practices deny necessary and standard medical care for \n3  chronic HCV, causing serious bodily  and mental  harm, as well as creating immediate and \n4  substantial risks to the health of Plaintiffs and those similarly situated, including irreparable health \n5  risks and harm.  \n6  STANDARD OF CARE FOR CHRONIC HCV \n7  34.  DAA Treatment is the standard of care for chronic HCV. \n8  35.  The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the \n9  Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) jointly publish treatment guidelines that establish \n10  the national standard of care for HCV treatment.  \n11  36.  The AASLD and IDSA recommend treatment for all patients with chronic HCV \n12  infection—regardless of fibrosis score––except for those with a short life expectancy that cannot \n13  be saved by DAA treatment, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy. See AASLD/IDSA, \n14  HCV Guidance: Recommendations for Testing, Managing, and Treating Hepatitis C (updated May \n15  24,  2018),  available  at  https://www.hcvguidelines.org/sites/default/files/full-\n16  guidancepdf/HCVGuidance_May_24_2018b.pdf.  \n17  37.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that \n18  administers  Medicaid,  has  emphasized  the  importance  of  access  to  DAAs  for  Medicaid \n19  beneficiaries.  On  November  15,  2015,  CMS  issued  guidance  (CMS Notice),  advising  state \n20  Medicaid agencies to include DAAs in their coverage of outpatient prescription drugs and warning \n21  against impermissible restrictions. Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs., Assuring Medicaid \n22  Beneficiaries  Access  to  Hepatitis  C  (HCV)  Drugs  (Nov.  5,  2015), \n23  https://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid- CHIP- Program- Information/By- Topics/PrescriptionDrug\n24  s/Downloads/Rx-Releases/State-Releases/state-rel-172.pdf. Addressing itself to the Medicaid Act, \n25  the CMS Notice observed “some states are restricting access to DAA HCV drugs contrary to the \n26  statutory requirements in section 1927 of the Act by imposing conditions for coverage that may \n27  unreasonably restrict access to these drugs.” The CMS Notice cited as examples of these improper \n28 \n \n9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 10 of 26\n \n1  limitations the requirement of a minimum fibrosis score, drug or alcohol abstinence, and that \n2  DAAs be prescribed by specialists.  \n3  38.  The CDC endorses the use of these effective medications to reduce HCV infection \n4  and transmission rates, thereby enhancing public health and lowering treatment costs to the state \n5  in the long run. Medicare and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs also utilize coverage criteria \n6  consistent with the standard of care, as per AASLD/IDSA guidelines.  \n7  39.  Withholding treatment can also increase psychological stressors including anxiety, \n8  illness uncertainty (the inability to determine the meaning of illness-related events), and depressive \n9  symptoms. With treatment, patients who are cured of chronic HCV report an improvement in their \n10  mental well-being. \n11  40.  Defendants  have  failed  to  provide  DAA  treatment  to  Plaintiffs  and similarly \n12  situated inmates and continue to fail to provide DAA treatment to Plaintiffs and similarly situated \n13  inmates. Indeed, it has been NDOC’s policy and practice to deny DAA treatment to all but a select \n14  few inmates in violation of the standard of care. \n15  MEDICAL DIRECTIVE 219 \n16  41.  NDOC has justified its refusal to provide DAA treatment to Plaintiff and similarly \n17  situated inmates, and has required medical personnel to ignore their independent judgment and \n18  deny treatment based on MD 219, which purports to reflect NDOC’s Hepatitis C treatment policy.  \n19  42.  The version of MD 219 enacted on May 17, 2017, Exhibit 2, did not establish \n20  automatic Hepatitis C testing for all inmates. Only “[i]nmate patients who have tested positive for \n21  Hepatitis  C  and  have  displayed  constitutional  signs  and  symptoms  may  be  candidates  for \n22  treatment.” Id. \n23  43.  The 2017 version of MD 219 excluded any inmate patient who had an APRI score \n24  lower than 2.0 or 1.5 “if there are other findings suggestive of fibrosis/cirrhosis.” Id. There was no \n25  medical justification to support this exclusion from DAA Treatment.  \n26  44.  Between 2017 and 2019, the NDOC is believed to have adjusted the exclusionary \n27  APRI scores but did not meaningfully revise its policies or procedures.  \n28 \n \n10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 11 of 26\n \n1  45.  In November 2019, the NDOC abolished the use of APRI scores as a strictly \n2  exclusionary criteria, but instead established a set of priority levels that are likely to be used to \n3  function in an identical fashion to the replaced exclusionary criteria. Exhibit 1. The 2019 version \n4  of MD 219 acknowledges that “all patients with chronic HCV may benefit from treatment, certain \n5  patients are at high risk for disease progression and qualify for more urgent administration of \n6  treatment.” Id. The three priority levels that were established are: \n7  a.  Priority Level 1 – High Priority for Treatment – Advanced hepatic fibrosis: \n8  APRI > 2.0, Metavir or Batts/Ludwig stage 3 or 4 on liver biopsy, cirrhosis; Liver \n9  transplant  recipients;  HCC;  Comorbid  conditions  associated  with  HCV; \n10  Immunosuppressant medication; and/or Continuity of Care.  \n11  b.  Priority  Level  2  –  Immediate  Priority  for  Treatment  –  Evidence  for \n12  progressive fibrosis: APRI score > 0.70, stage 2 fibrosis on liver biopsy; Comorbid Medical \n13  conditions; Diabetes melitus; and/or Chronic kidney disease \n14  c.  Priority Level 3 – Low Priority for Treatment – Stage 0 to Stage 1 fibrosis \n15  on liver biopsy; APRI < 1; All other cases of HCV infection meeting the eligibility criteria \n16  for treatment.  \n17  46.  There is no medical justification for delaying DAA treatment to individuals in any \n18  of the Priority Levels. There is not a shortage of DAA treatment drugs nor medical professionals \n19  as the treatment is typically administered through oral pills.   \n20  NAMED PLAINTIFF ALLEGATIONS \n21  A.  Elizabeth Carley \n22  47.   Plaintiff Elizabeth Carley is 42 years old, and entered NDOC custody in 2012, with \n23  a maximum release date of January 13, 2027. Ms. Carley is currently incarcerated at the Florence \n24  McClure Women’s Correctional Center Facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. \n25  48.  Ms. Carley was diagnosed with chronic HCV in or around 2014. \n26  49.  Defendants have denied Ms. Carley needed medical treatment for HCV. \n27  50.  Ms. Carley was admitted to a Hepatitis C clinic to monitor her liver enzyme levels, \n28  but her levels are not regularly monitored.  \n \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 12 of 26\n \n1  51.  Ms. Carley has experienced chronic conditions associated with HCV, including \n2  liver fibrosis, cirrhosis of the liver, jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. \n3  52.  During the time period that the Defendants continue to withhold treatment, Ms. \n4  Carley’s chronic HCV may progress, further scarring her liver, further impairing liver function, \n5  and putting her at increasing risk of cirrhosis, liver disease, excruciating pain, and death. \n6  53.  Ms. Carley has sought treatment for her chronic HCV on many occasions by filing \n7  grievances. Each time, however, prison officials informed her that her enzymes were too low to \n8  allow for treatment under NDOC’s policies.  \n9  54.  Relevant to the instant action, Ms. Carley filed a grievance on July 22, 2016. \n10  55.  Ms. Carley has exhausted her administrative grievances. \n11  56.  No medical reason existed or exists to deny Ms. Carley DAA Treatment.  \n12  57.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the refusal to treat Ms. Carley \n13  with DAAs constituting deliberate indifference to her serious medical needs and discrimination \n14  under the ADA and a violation of her equal protection rights. \n15  B.  Marty Fitzgerald \n16  58.  Marty Fitzgerald is 48 years old and entered NDOC custody in 2002. He is currently \n17  incarcerated in High Desert State Prison and serving a determinate sentence with a maximum \n18  release date of October 16, 2023.  \n19  59.  Mr. Fitzgerald was diagnosed with chronic HCV prior to 2015.  \n20  60.  Defendants have denied Mr. Fitzgerald needed medical treatment for HCV.  \n21  61.  Mr. Fitzgerald has experienced chronic conditions associated with chronic HCV, \n22  including, liver fibrosis, abdominal pain, and nausea.  \n23  62.  Mr.  Fitzgerald’s  chronic  HCV  also  causes  him  great  stress  and  worry.  It  is \n24  extremely difficult for him to know that the disease may be progressively scarring his liver, that \n25  curative treatment is available, but the Defendants refuse to treat him.  \n26  63.  During the time period that the Defendants continue to withhold treatment, Mr. \n27  Fitzgerald’s chronic HCV may progress, further scarring his liver, impairing liver function, and \n28  putting him at increasing risk of cirrhosis, liver disease, excruciating pain, and death. \n \n12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 13 of 26\n \n1  64.  Mr. Fitzgerald has sought treatment for his chronic HCV on many occasions by \n2  filing grievances. Relevant to this action, Mr. Fitzgerald filed a grievance in or around March 2017. \n3  65.  Mr. Fitzgerald has exhausted his administrative grievances.  \n4  66.  No medical reason existed or exists to deny Mr. Fitzgerald DAA Treatment.  \n5  67.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the refusal to treat Mr. West \n6  with DAAs constituting deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and discrimination \n7  under the ADA and a violation of his equal protection rights. \n8  C.  Howard White \n9  68.  Plaintiff Howard White is 74 years old and entered NDOC custody in 1997. \n10  69.  Mr. White is serving a life sentence, and is currently incarcerated at the Northern \n11  Nevada Correctional Center in Carson City, Nevada.  \n12  70.  Mr. White was diagnosed with chronic HCV in or around March 1997 while out of \n13  custody. \n14  71.  In or around December 1997, when Mr. White entered the custody of NDOC, he \n15  was retested for HCV. \n16  72.  Defendants have denied Mr. White needed medical treatment for HCV. \n17  73.  Mr. White has experienced chronic conditions  associated with  chronic HCV, \n18  including Type 2 diabetes, liver pain, fatigue, joint pain, and jaundice. \n19  74.  During the time period that the Defendants continue to withhold treatment, Mr. \n20  White’s chronic HCV may progress, further scarring his liver, impairing liver function, and putting \n21  him at increasing risk of cirrhosis, liver disease, excruciating pain, and death. \n22  75.  Mr. White filed a grievance on January 1, 2016.  \n23  76.  Mr. White has exhausted his administrative grievance. \n24  77.  No medical reason existed or exists to deny Mr. White DAA Treatment.  \n25  78.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the refusal to treat Mr. White \n26  with DAAs constituting deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and discrimination \n27  under the ADA and a violation of his equal protection rights. \n28  // \n \n13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 14 of 26\n \n1  D.  Stephen Ciolino \n2  79.  Plaintiff Stephen Ciolino is 50 years old and entered NDOC custody in 2005. \n3  80.  Mr. Ciolino is serving a life sentence, and is currently incarcerated at the High \n4  Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nevada. \n5  81.  Mr. Ciolino was diagnosed with chronic HCV and has been denied DAA treatment \n6  since at least 2018.  \n7  82.  Defendants have denied Mr. Ciolino needed medical treatment for HCV. \n8  83.  Mr. Ciolino has experienced chronic conditions associated with chronic HCV, \n9  including persistent fatigue, abdominal pain, and nausea. \n10  84.  During the time period that the Defendants continue to withhold treatment, Mr. \n11  Ciolino’s chronic HCV may progress, further scarring his liver, impairing liver function, and \n12  putting him at increasing risk of cirrhosis, liver disease, excruciating pain, and death. \n13  85.  Mr. Ciolino has grieved the denial of medical treatment for his chronic HCV \n14  multiple times since his diagnosis in 2005. Most recently, Mr. Ciolino filed a grievance on \n15  December 8, 2018.  \n16  86.  Mr. Ciolino has exhausted his administrative grievance. \n17  87.  No medical reason existed or exists to deny Mr. Ciolino DAA Treatment.  \n18  88.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the refusal to treat Mr. Ciolino \n19  with DAAs constituting deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and discrimination \n20  under the ADA and a violation of his equal protection rights. \n21  E.  Carl Olsen \n22  89.  Plaintiff Carl Olsen is 69 years old and entered NDOC custody in 1990. \n23  90.  Mr. Olsen is serving a life sentence, and is currently incarcerated at the Lovelock \n24  Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada.  \n25  91.  Mr. Olsen was diagnosed with chronic HCV and has been denied DAA treatment \n26  since at least 2017.  \n27  92.  Defendants have denied Mr. Olsen needed medical treatment for HCV. \n28 \n \n14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 15 of 26\n \n1  93.  Mr.  Olsen  has  experienced  chronic  conditions  associated  with  chronic  HCV, \n2  including fatigue, nausea, and joint pain. Mr. Olsen’s chronic HCV also causes him great stress \n3  and worry. It is extremely difficult for him to know that the disease may be progressively scarring \n4  his liver, that curative treatment is available, but the Defendants refuse to treat him. \n5  94.  During the time period that the Defendants continue to withhold treatment, Mr. \n6  Olsen’s chronic HCV may progress, further scarring his liver, impairing liver function, and putting \n7  him at increasing risk of cirrhosis, liver disease, excruciating pain, and death. \n8  95.  Mr. Olsen filed a grievance on September 28, 2017. \n9  96.  Mr. Olsen has exhausted his administrative grievance. \n10  97.  No medical reason existed or exists to deny Mr. Olsen DAA Treatment.  \n11  98.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the refusal to treat Mr. Olsen \n12  with DAAs constituting deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and discrimination \n13  under the ADA and a violation of his equal protection rights. \n14  F.  Don Savage \n15  99.  Plaintiff Don Savage is 51 years old and entered NDOC custody in 2017. \n16  100.  Mr. Savage has a maximum release date of December 2, 2021, and is currently \n17  incarcerated at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center in Carson City.   \n18  101.  Mr. Savage was diagnosed with chronic HCV and has been denied DAA treatment \n19  since at least 2015.   \n20  102.  Defendants have denied Mr. Savage needed medical treatment for HCV. \n21  103.  Mr. Savage has experienced chronic conditions associated with chronic HCV, \n22  including loss of weight and muscle mass and persistent fatigue. Mr. Savage’s chronic HCV also \n23  causes him great stress and worry. It is extremely difficult for him to know that the disease may \n24  be progressively scarring his liver, that curative treatment is available, but the Defendants refuse \n25  to treat him. \n26  104.  During the time period that the Defendants continue to withhold treatment, Mr. \n27  Savage’s chronic HCV may progress, further scarring his liver, impairing liver function, and \n28  putting him at increasing risk of cirrhosis, liver disease, excruciating pain, and death. \n \n15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 16 of 26\n \n1  105.  Mr. Savage filed a grievance on February 24, 2015. \n2  106.  Mr. Savage has exhausted his administrative grievance. \n3  107.  No medical reason existed or exists to deny Mr. Savage DAA Treatment.  \n4  108.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the refusal to treat Mr. Savage \n5  with DAAs constituting deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and discrimination \n6  under the ADA and a violation of his equal protection rights. \n7  G.  Scott Bedard \n8  109.  Plaintiff Scott Bedard is 53 years old and entered NDOC custody in 1997. \n9  110.  Mr. Bedard is serving a life sentence, and is currently incarcerated at the Lovelock \n10  Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada.  \n11  111.  Mr. Bedard was diagnosed with chronic HCV since at least 2017.  \n12  112.  Defendants initially denied DAA treatment to Mr. Benard in 2017 but ultimately \n13  approved and provided Mr. Bedard with DAA treatment as of November 2019.  \n14  113.  The delayed approval of DAA treatment has led to chronic conditions for Mr. \n15  Bedard associated with chronic HCV, including Type 2 diabetes and hypothyroidism. \n16  114.  Mr. Bedard filed a grievance on November 30, 2017. \n17  115.  Mr. Bedard has exhausted his administrative grievance. \n18  116.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the delay of treatment to Mr. \n19  Bedard  with  DAAs  constituting  deliberate  indifference  to  his  serious  medical  needs  and \n20  discrimination under the ADA and a violation of his equal protection rights. \n21  H.  Mitchell Fields \n22  117.  Plaintiff Mitchell Fields is 58 years old and entered NDOC custody in 1993. \n23  118.  Mr. Bedard is serving a life sentence, and is currently incarcerated at the Lovelock \n24  Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada with a scheduled release date of January 3, 2020.  \n25  119.  Mr. Fields was diagnosed with chronic HCV and has been denied treatment since \n26  at least 2015.  \n27  120.  Defendants have denied Mr. Fields needed medical treatment for HCV. \n28  // \n \n16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 17 of 26\n \n1  121.  Mr. Fields has experienced medical issues as a result of his untreated HCV, \n2  including liver pain. Mr. Fields’s chronic HCV also causes him great stress and worry. It is \n3  extremely difficult for him to know that the disease may be progressively scarring his liver, that \n4  curative treatment is available, but the Defendants refuse to treat him. \n5  122.  During the time period that the Defendants continue to withhold treatment, Mr. \n6  Fields’s chronic HCV may progress, further scarring his liver, impairing liver function, and putting \n7  him at increasing risk of cirrhosis, liver disease, excruciating pain, and death. \n8  123.  Mr. Fields filed a grievance in or around December 2015. \n9  124.  Mr. Fields has exhausted his administrative grievance. \n10  125.  No medical reason existed or exists to deny Mr. Fields DAA Treatment.  \n11  126.  Defendants, by their policy or practice, have forced the refusal to treat Mr. Fields \n12  with DAAs constituting deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and discrimination \n13  under the ADA and a violation of his equal protection rights. \n14  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n15  127.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs seek to certify a \n16  class of all persons:  \n17  a.  Who are or will be, in the legal custody of the NDOC, and \n18  b.  Who have been incarcerated for at least 21 days and have at least 12-weeks \n19  remaining on their sentence, and  \n20  c.  Who have been diagnosed with chronic HCV, and are candidates for DAA \n21  treatment as per the proper medical standard of care,  \n22  d.  For whom DAA treatment has been or will be denied, withheld, or delayed \n23  based on policies or considerations that deviate from the medical standard of care.  \n24  128.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have the ability to identify all such \n25  similarly situated class members, through medical and other records in Defendant’s possession.  \n26  129.  The requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied: \n27  a.  Numerosity:  The  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is \n28  impracticable. NDOC has reported it has over 13,700 inmates in its custody as of December \n \n17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 18 of 26\n \n1  2018 and expects the total inmate population to increase each year. National estimates \n2  suggest that approximately one third of incarcerated individuals have HCV. \n3  b.  Commonality: There are questions of law or fact common to the class, \n4  including but not limited to: 1) whether HCV is a serious medical need; 2) whether \n5  Defendants’ policy and practice of not providing HCV treatment constitutes deliberate \n6  indifference to serious medical needs in violation of the Eight Amendment; 3) whether \n7  Defendants have knowingly failed to provide the necessary staging of HCV patients in \n8  accordance with the prevailing standard of care, including the pretreatment testing to \n9  determine the severity of the disease; 4) whether Defendants have knowingly employed \n10  policies and practices that unjustifiably delay or deny treatment for HCV; 5) whether \n11  Defendants have permitted cost considerations to improperly interfere with the treatment \n12  of HCV; 6) whether HCV is a disability under the ADA; 7) whether medical services in \n13  prison  are  a  program  or  service  under  the  ADA;  and  8)  whether  Defendants  have \n14  discriminated  against  NDOC  inmates  with  HCV  on  the  basis  of  their  disability  by \n15  categorically denying them medical treatment, while providing treatment for other diseases \n16  and conditions such as HIV.  \n17  c.  Typicality: The claims or defenses of the class representatives are typical of \n18  the claims or defenses of the class. The class representatives have been diagnosed with \n19  chronic  HCV  but  have  been  refused  treatment,  and  suffer  from  the  same  kind  of \n20  complications and substantial risk of serious harm that the class members suffer from. \n21  d.  Adequacy:  The  class  representatives  and  class  counsel  will  fairly  and \n22  adequately protect the interests of the class. The class representatives are committed to \n23  obtaining declaratory relief that will benefit themselves as well as the class by ending \n24  Defendants’ unconstitutional policy and practice. Their interests are consistent with and \n25  not antagonistic to the interests of the class. They have a strong personal interest in the \n26  outcome of this case and have no conflicts with class members. They are represented by \n27  experienced counsel. \n28 \n \n18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 19 of 26\n \n1  130.  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are satisfied, as the party opposing the class has \n2  acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class so that final declaratory relief \n3  would be appropriate to the class as a whole.  \n \n4  CAUSES OF ACTION \n5   \nFirst Cause of Action  \n6  (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief - Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. \nConstitution via 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n7   \n \n8  131.  Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs as if set forth fully contained herein.  \n9  132.  Defendants’ acts and omissions in their respective official capacities have failed to \n10  provide adequate medical care according to the clearly established medical standard of care. This \n11  deviation from the standard of care constitutes deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs \n12  of Plaintiffs and other similarly situated inmates infected with chronic HCV, thereby establishing \n13  a violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII and XIV, for which 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides declaratory, \n14  equitable, mandamus, and legal remedies. \n15  133.  Defendants know of and enforce the policies and practices described above. They \n16  know of Plaintiffs’ and the Plaintiff Class’s serious medical needs, but intentionally refuse to \n17  provide treatment addressing those needs. Defendants know that failure to treat those serious \n18  medical needs has harmed Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class and continues to place them at \n19  substantial risk of serious harm. \n20  134.  Defendants’ conscious disregard of the risks facing Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class \n21  violates all standards of decency and constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical need. \n22  Second Cause of Action  \n(Declaratory and Injunctive Relief - Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  §§ 12131, \n23  et seq.) \n24  135.  Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs as if set forth fully contained herein.  \n25  136.  The  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  and  its  subsequent  amendments \n26  prohibit public entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities in their programs, \n27  services, and activities. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134.  \n28  // \n \n19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 20 of 26\n \n1  137.  The  ADA  defines  “public  entity”  as  any  state  or  local  government  or  “any \n2  department, agency . . . or other instrumentality” of a state or local government. 42 U.S.C. § \n3  12131(1)(A), (B). \n4  138.  NDOC is a “public entity” as defined by the ADA. NDOC has legal custody of \n5  hundreds of individuals that have been diagnosed with chronic HCV.  \n6  139.  The individual Defendants are responsible for NDOC’s policies and practices and \n7  are authorized representatives of NDOC.  \n8  140.  Plaintiffs each have a disability within the meaning of the ADA. An infection with \n9  a  potentially  deadly  communicable  virus  constitutes  a  physical  or  mental  impairment  that \n10  substantially limits several major life activities, including but not limited to eating and toileting. \n11  141.  Each of the Plaintiffs are regarded by Defendants as having a disability because \n12  they have been subjected to the Defendants’ chronic HCV policies or practices because they are \n13  infected with chronic HCV. \n14  142.  The Defendants have policies or practices to address the entire range of serious \n15  medical conditions that arise for individuals that are within NDOC’s legal custody. In no other \n16  similar set of circumstances to an individual living with chronic HCV does NDOC maintain \n17  policies or practices that depart from the medical standard of care on the basis of non-medical \n18  considerations, as alleged herein.  \n19  143.  Plaintiffs are excluded from appropriate medical treatment by  reason of their \n20  disability. Defendants discriminate against Plaintiffs on the basis of their disabilities by denying \n21  or withholding medically necessary treatment for reasons unrelated to the standard of care, as \n22  described throughout this Complaint. Defendants have singled out individuals infected with \n23  chronic Hepatitis C to be subjected to policies and practices unrelated to the medical standard of \n24  care in a manner distinct from Defendants’ policies or practices for individuals with other medical \n25  needs. \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n \n20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 21 of 26\n \nThird Cause of Action  \n1  (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief - Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendments to the \nU.S. Constitution via 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n2   \n3  144.  To state an Equal Protection Claim, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that defendants \n4  “acted with an intent or purpose to discriminate against the plaintiff based upon membership in a \n5  protected class,” or that Defendants purposefully treated them differently than similarly situated \n6  individuals without any rational basis for the disparate treatment. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 \n7  F.3d 668, 686 (9th Cir. 2001). \n8  145.  Defendants discriminate against Plaintiffs on the basis of their HCV status by \n9  denying or withholding medically necessary treatment for reasons unrelated to the standard of \n10  care, as described throughout this Complaint. Defendants have singled out individuals infected \n11  with chronic Hepatitis C to be subjected to policies and practices unrelated to the medical standard \n12  of care in a manner distinct from Defendants’ policies or practices for individuals with other \n13  medical needs, including individuals with other infectious diseases. \n14  146.  Defendants discriminate against Plaintiffs on the basis of their HCV status by \n15  denying or withholding medically necessary treatment for reasons unrelated to the standard of \n16  care, including the requirement that Plaintiff sign an “agreement” that is not related to the standard \n17  of care and would result in the denial of appropriate care. Defendants have singled out individuals \n18  infected with chronic Hepatitis C to be subjected to policies and practices unrelated to the medical \n19  standard of care in a manner distinct from Defendants’ policies or practices for individuals with \n20  other medical needs, including individuals with other infectious diseases. \n21  147.  Defendants’  acts  and  omissions  in  their  respective  official  capacities  have \n22  established  a  violation  of  U.S.  Const.  amend.  XIV,  for  which  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  provides \n23  declaratory, equitable, mandamus, and legal remedies. \n24  148.  Defendants know of and enforce the policies and practices described above. They \n25  know of Plaintiffs’ and the Plaintiff Class’s serious medical needs, but intentionally refuse to \n26  provide treatment addressing those needs and thereby treat Plaintiffs’ medical needs as different \n27  from other similarly situated inmates. \n28 \n \n21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 10   Filed 12/09/19   Page 22 of 26\n \n1  149.  The fact that Defendants treat Plaintiffs differently from other inmates has no \n2  rational basis, and is not reasonably related to the valid goal of maintaining order and discipline \n3  among the inmates.  \n4  150.  Defendants know that their treatment of Plaintiffs has harmed them and the Plaintiff \n5  Class and continues to place them at substantial risk of serious harm. \n6  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n7  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court issue the following relief: \n8  A.  A  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  policy  or  practice  of  denying, \n9  withholding, or prioritizing DAA treatment for the Plaintiffs and putative class \n10  members violates the Eighth Amendment and constitutes deliberate indifference to \n11  the serious medical needs of Plaintiffs and putative class members;  \n12  B.

This Motion is made and based upon the following Memorandum of Points and \n2  Authorities, the exhibits attached hereto, the pleadings and papers on file, and any oral argument \n3  of counsel at a hearing on this matter. \n4  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n5  I.  INTRODUCTION \n6  The Parties have reached a proposed resolution of this class action whereby 1) all inmates \n7  in the custody of NDOC will be tested for Hepatitis C (“HCV”) this year; 2) effectively all of the \n8  highest-priority inmates will receive Direct-Acting Antiviral (“DAA”) treatment within six months \n9  of the approval of the Consent Decree; 3) 1,200 inmates with HCV will receive DAA treatment \n10  within the first year and a total of 2,400 inmates with HCV will receive this cure within the first \n11  three years after the approval of the Consent Decree. Exhibit 1, Proposed Consent Decree. The \n12  Parties have also agreed upon a revised set of policies and practices through the amendment of \n13  MD 219 and its related documents. As many of these timelines are triggered by the effective date \n14  of the final approval of the Consent Decree, there is significant urgency. However, there are \n15  complexities and procedural formalities that need to be addressed and thus, the Parties respectfully \n16  suggest the following framework should be adopted upon preliminary approval of the Consent \n17  Decree by the Court.  \n18    First, the Parties’ request that after preliminary approval, the Court set a fairness hearing \n19  (“Fairness Hearing”) as soon as possible after October 22, 2020 (the date of the next Interim \n20  Finance Committee), at which the final approval of the Consent Decree will be presented and \n21  resolved in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). The period between the preliminary approval of \n22  the Consent Decree and the Fairness Hearing will be referred to as the “Interim Period.”  \n23    Second,  within  ten  (10)  days  after  preliminary  approval,  the  Parties  will  notify \n24  ascertainable Class Members of the proposed Consent Decree (“Notice”), Exhibit 2, and inform \n25  them that they have the opportunity to provide input to the Court and/or object to the Consent \n26  Decree during the Interim Period. The Notice will also inform the Class Members, including Class \n27  Representatives, that they are entitled to an additional opt-out period during the Interim Period.  \n28 \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 61   Filed 08/20/20   Page 3 of 8\n \n1    Third, during the Interim Period, Defendants will seek approval of the Consent Decree \n2  from the Board of Examiners, the Interim Finance Committee, and/or the Nevada Legislature. The \n3  Consent Decree is expressly contingent upon certain governmental approvals; however, the Parties \n4  anticipate that the matter will be presented and approval hopefully obtained prior to the Fairness \n5  Hearing. In the event that the governmental approvals are not received, the Parties will notify the \n6  Court and schedule a status conference.   \n7    Fourth, in advance of the Fairness Hearing, the Parties will submit supplemental briefing \n8  as needed to inform the Court of the status of the governmental approvals, respond to any \n9  objections to the Consent Decree, and further support the basis for entry of the Consent Decree.   \n10    Based  on  the  foregoing,  this  Joint  Motion  respectfully  requests  that  the  Court  (1) \n11  preliminarily approve the Consent Decree, Ex. 1; (2) approve the form of the Notice, Ex. 2; (3) set \n12  a date for the Fairness Hearing; and (4) set a date by which Class Members must seek exclusion \n13  from the Class or file objections to the proposed Consent Decree.  \n14  II.  LEGAL STANDARD \n15  “The Court’s review of the proposed consent decree is informed by the public policy \n16  favoring settlement.” Sierra Club v. McCarthy, No. 13-CV-03953-SI, 2015 WL 889142, at *5 \n17  (N.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2015). A district court may approve a consent decree when the decree is \n18  “fair, reasonable and equitable and does not violate the law or public policy.” Sierra Club, Inc. v. \n19  Elec. Controls Design, Inc., 909 F.2d 1350, 1355 (9th Cir. 1990). “If the decree was the product \n20  of ‘good faith, arms-length negotiations,’ it is ‘presumptively valid and the objecting party has a \n21  heavy burden of demonstrating the decree is unreasonable.’ McCarthy, 2015 WL 889142, at *5 \n22  (quoting United States v. Oregon, 913 F.2d 576, 580 (9th Cir. 1990)).  \n23  Further, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626 (“PLRA”), a \n24  consent decree containing injunctive relief in a case involving “prison conditions” may not be \n25  approved unless the district court finds that the injunctive relief is (1) narrowly drawn, (2) extends \n26  no further than is necessary to correct the asserted violation of the federal right, and (3) is the least \n27  intrusive means necessary to correct the asserted violation of the federal right. \n28  // \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 61   Filed 08/20/20   Page 4 of 8\n \n1  III.  ARGUMENT \n2  This Court should preliminarily approve the Consent Decree because it is (1) fair, adequate, \n3  and reasonable; (2) not illegal or the result of collusion, and in the public interest. Moreover, it is \n4  (1) narrowly drawn, (2) extends no further than necessary to correct the asserted violation of a \n5  federal right, and (3) is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the asserted violation of a \n6  federal right. \n7  This class action relates to the policies and practices for testing and treatment of inmates \n8  in NDOC custody. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and to certify a class seeking \n9  the same, from the State of Nevada’s practice of withholding or delaying curative treatment to \n10  inmates with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (“HCV”) without medical justification. This curative \n11  treatment is commonly referred to as DAA Treatment. While Defendants do not admit liability, \n12  the proposed Consent Decree will expand and accelerate the testing and treatment of inmates with \n13  HCV. Defendants have agreed to revise MD 219 and the related documents to remove non-medical \n14  barriers to testing and treatment. Ex. 1. Defendants have also agreed to definitive timelines by \n15  which a set number of inmates with HCV must be provided with DAA Treatment and this rate of \n16  treatment is exponentially greater than the existing rate.

CONCLUSION \n2  For all of the foregoing reasons, the Parties request that the Court (1) preliminarily approve \n3  the Consent Decree, Ex. 1; (2) approve the form of the Notice, Ex. 2; (3) set a date for the Fairness \n4  Hearing; and (4) set a date by which Class Members must seek exclusion from the Class or file \n5  objections to the proposed Consent Decree. \n6  Dated August 20, 2020. \n \n7 \n   \nMcDONALD CARANO LLP   AARON D.

INTRODUCTION\n9  A. The Parties:\n10  1. Plaintiffs: Class Representatives Marty Scott Fitzgerald, Elizabeth Carley, Donald Savage,\n11  Howard White, Carl Olsen, Scott Bedard, Stephen Ciolino and Mitchell Fields (“Class\n12  Representatives”) who filed a Class Action Complaint (“Complaint”) on December 9, 2019\n13  (ECF No. 10) individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons (“Class\n14  Members”), by and through their undersigned counsel (“Class Counsel”).\n15  2. Defendants:  The  STATE  OF  NEVADA  ex  rel.  NEVADA  DEPARTMENT  OF\n16  CORRECTIONS (“NDOC”), on behalf of itself and all of its officers, directors, employees,\n17  former  employees,  agents,  predecessors,  divisions,  correctional  facilities,  successors,\n18  administrators, and assigns, including, but not limited to Director Charles Daniels, former\n19  Acting Director and current Deputy Director of Operations Harold Wickham, former\n20  Director James Dzurenda, former Medical Director Romeo Aranas, M.D., current Medical\n21  Director, Michael Minev, M.D., and any other persons named (or could have been named)\n22  in the Complaint who are or were NDOC or State of Nevada employees (collectively\n23  referred to as “the NDOC” or “Defendants”).\n24  3. Plaintiffs and Defendants are collectively referred to herein as the “Parties” or individually\n25  as a “Party.”\n26  B. DISPUTES/LITIGATION\n27  4. This action relates to the testing and treatment of inmates with the chronic Hepatitis C\n28  Virus (“HCV”) who are or will be in NDOC custody.\n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 2 of 24\n1  5. On October 9, 2019, this Court issued Pre-Trial Order #1: Initial Case Conference (ECF\n2  No. 1). Through that Order, the Court consolidated fourteen (14) cases, which presented\n3  similar issues related to HCV:\n4  •2:17-CV-1627-MMD-CBC Reese v. Foxfulker, et. al.\n•2:17-CV-1725-MMD-CBC Fields v. Neven, et. al.\n5  •2:17-CV-2346-MMD-CBC Carley v. Neven, et. al.\n•2:19-CV-0213-MMD-CBC Flynn v. Dzurenda, et. al.\n6  •2:19-CV-0520-MMD-CBC Ciolino v. Dzurenda, et. al.\n•3:16-CV-0676-MMD-CBC Nevarez v. Baca, et. al.\n7  •3:17-CV-0278-MMD-CBC Fitzgerald v. Martin, et. al.\n•3:17-CV-0612-MMD-CBC Savage v. Aranas, et. al.\n8  •3:18-CV-0037-MMD-CBC White v. Aranas, et. al.\n•3:18-CV-0149-MMD-CBC Olsen v. Nevada Department of Corrections, et. al.\n9  •3:18-CV-0218-MMD-CBC Bedard v. Nevada Department of Corrections, et. al.\n•3:18-CV-0386-MMD-CBC Mulder v. Marks, et. al.\n10  •3:18-CV-0464-MMD-CBC Thomas v. Dzurenda, et. al.\n•3:19-CV-0300-MMD-CBC Klein v. Williams, et. al.\n11 \n12  6. On  December  9,  2019,  Class  Counsel  filed  an  Amended  Class  Action  Complaint\n13  (“Complaint”) and Motion to Certify Class. (ECF Nos. 10, 11). The Complaint was filed\n14  on behalf of eight named plaintiffs, the Class Representatives, whose individual cases were\n15  stayed during the pendency of the class action proceedings. The other consolidated cases\n16  were also stayed, even for those plaintiffs who did not serve as Class Representatives.\n17  7. Defendants answered the Complaint on January 21, 2020 and filed a Response to Motion\n18  to Certify Class on the same day. (ECF Nos. 18, 19).\n19  8. On February 18, 2020, the Court granted the Motion to Certify Class. (ECF No. 21). Adam\n20  Hosmer-Henner, Margaret A. McLetchie, and their chosen litigation teams were appointed\n21  as Class Counsel. Id. The Court certified a class of “all persons: (a) who are or will be in\n22  the legal custody of NDOC; (b) who have been incarcerated for at least 21 days and have\n23  at least 12 weeks remaining on their sentence; (c) who have been diagnosed with chronic\n24  HCV and are candidates for DAA treatment pursuant to the proper medical standard of\n25  care; and (d) for whom DAA treatment has been or will be denied, withheld, or delayed\n26  based on policies or considerations that deviate from the proper medical standard of care.”\n27  Id.\n28  // \n2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 3 of 24\n1  9. The Court further ordered that the following issues were certified for class litigation: “(1)\n2  whether HCV is a serious medical need; (2) whether NDOC’s policy and practice of not\n3  providing HCV treatment constitutes deliberate indifference to serious medical needs in\n4  violation of the Eight Amendment; (3) whether NDOC has knowingly failed to provide the\n5  necessary staging of HCV patients in accordance with the prevailing medical standard of\n6  care, including the pretreatment testing to determine the severity of the disease; (4) whether\n7  NDOC has knowingly employed policies and practices that unjustifiably delay or deny\n8  treatment for HCV; (5) whether NDOC has permitted cost considerations to improperly\n9  interfere with the treatment of HCV; (6) whether HCV is a disability under the ADA\n10  (Americans with Disabilities Act); (7) whether medical services in prison are a program or\n11  service under the ADA; and (8) whether Defendant has discriminated against NDOC\n12  inmates with HCV on the basis of their disability by categorically denying them medical\n13  treatment, while providing treatment for other diseases and conditions.” (ECF No. 21).\n14  10. The Parties submitted a Proposed Stipulated Discovery Plan and Scheduling Order on April\n15  2, 2020 (ECF No. 32) and the Court entered a Scheduling Order on April 3, 2020 (ECF\n16  No. 34).\n17  11. The Parties engaged in written discovery throughout the first phase of the discovery plan.\n18  Although the Parties did not disclose expert reports prior to settlement, both sides also\n19  engaged experts and consulted with them extensively.\n20  12. The Parties participated in a telephonic pre-settlement conference on June 24, 2020 with\n21  Magistrate Judge Cobb and the entered into a stipulation to stay further discovery and\n22  discovery deadlines pending the outcome of settlement discussions. (ECF Nos. 45, 46).\n23  13. The Parties participated in a settlement conference with Magistrate Judge Cobb on July 9,\n24  2020 and July 10, 2020. (ECF Nos. 54, 55). Thereafter, the Parties continued settlement\n25  discussions on August 6, 2020 (ECF No. 59) with Magistrate Judge Cobb, in addition to\n26  additional numerous hours spent on videoconferences and teleconferences in between and\n27  after the formal settlement conferences.\n28  // \n3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 4 of 24\n1  C. Proposed Resolution\n2  14. This Parties recognize the need to test inmates in NDOC custody for HCV and the need to\n3  provide DAA treatment for HCV. At an April 14, 2020 meeting of the State of Nevada\n4  Board of Examiners, Governor Sisolak remarked: “Treating [HCV inmates] in prison is\n5  critical for two reasons. First, if left untreated, this disease can spread widely through the\n6  prisons. Second, if not treated in prison, treatment will most likely occur after the inmate\n7  has been released. A large percentage of inmates are on Medicaid and treatment later in the\n8  disease lifecycle is more costly than treatment in the early stages. As a result, treatment in\n9  prison is less costly to the State.”\n10  15. Defendants  agree  that  the  Consent  Decree  meets  the  requirements  of  18  U.S.C.  §\n11  3626(a)(1)(A) & (c)(1) and they will not seek to terminate or otherwise challenge the\n12  Consent Decree based on a contention that it is inconsistent with the Prison Litigation\n13  Reform Act. In reviewing the claims raised in the Complaint, the State of Nevada, NDOC,\n14  and all individually-named Defendants deny that the NDOC and its employees engaged in\n15  any culpable conduct.  The NDOC’s legal position was at all times, and remains, that the\n16  HCV Inmate Patients’ rights were not violated as all versions of (previous and current)\n17  Medical Directive (MD) 219 promulgated by NDOC  do not violate the Eighth Amendment\n18  and that the HCV Treatment provided to HCV Inmates was and is medically appropriate\n19  and in conformity with all state and federal laws, including the ADA.\n20  16. By agreeing to entry of this Consent Decree, the Parties make no admission of law or fact\n21  with respect to the allegations in the Complaint. For the purposes of avoiding litigation\n22  among the Parties, however, the Parties agree to the requirements of this Consent Decree.\n23  17. The Parties recognize, and the Court by entering this Consent Decree finds, that this\n24  Consent Decree has been negotiated at arms-length by the Parties in good faith and will\n25  avoid litigation among the Parties, and that this Consent Decree is fair, reasonable, and in\n26  the public interest.\n27  // \n28  // \n4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 5 of 24\n1  NOW THEREFORE, it is hereby ADJUDGED, ORDERED, AND DECREED as follows: \n2  II. DEFINITIONS\n3  18. “HCV” refers to chronic Hepatitis C.\n4  19. “DAA” refers to direct-acting antiviral medications.\n5  20. “MD 219” refers to the medical directive adopted by Defendants related to the testing and\n6  treatment of HCV by NDOC. MD 219 has been revised several times from the first version\n7  relevant to this litigation, which was adopted on May 17, 2017. MD 219 was then revised\n8  again in November 2019 and January 2020.\n9  21. “HCV Consent Agreement” refers to the agreement signed by an inmate pursuant to MD\n10  219.\n11  22. “Effective Date” refers to the date on which the Court grants final approval to the Consent\n12  Decree after the Parties, the State of Nevada Board of Examiners (if necessary), the State\n13  of Nevada Interim Finance Committee (“IFC”) and/or the State of Nevada Legislature,\n14  have all agreed to the Consent Decree.  Should this Consent Decree be agreed to by the\n15  Parties, the Court and IFC or Legislature on different dates, the Effective Date shall be the\n16  date in which the last necessary entity (IFC, Legislature, Court) has agreed to the terms of\n17  the Consent Decree.\n18  23. “Class Members” or “HCV Inmate Patients” refers to all current or future inmates within\n19  NDOC custody who were identified by the Court as inmates\n20  (a) who are or will be in the legal custody of NDOC; (b) who have\nbeen incarcerated for at least 21 days and have at least 12 weeks\n21  remaining on their sentence; (c) who have been diagnosed with\nchronic HCV and are candidates for DAA [Direct Acting Antiviral]\n22  treatment pursuant to the proper medical standard of care; and (d)\nfor whom DAA treatment has been or will be denied, withheld, or\n23  delayed based on policies or considerations that deviate from the\nproper medical standard of care.[1]\n24 \nAs the determination of which inmates would fall under categories (c) and (d) has not been \n25 \nlitigated and decided, and the Parties continue to dispute what “the proper medical standard \n26 \nof care” is for treating incarcerated individuals with HCV, for purposes of this Consent \n27 \n28 \n1 See Order, In re: HCV Litigation, ECF No. 21. \n5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 6 of 24\n1  Decree, the Parties agree that all individuals incarcerated within an NDOC facility now or \n2  in the future who meet the description of the class definition set forth in ¶ 25 (a)-(c) shall \n3  be  considered  an  HCV  Inmate  Patient  making  them  eligible  for  DAA  treatment,  if \n4  medically indicated, without regard to whether DAA Treatment for each and every HCV \n5  positive inmate is constitutionally required. \n6  III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n7  24. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and over the Parties\n8  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C.\n9  § 1391(b)(1) and (2), because the events that gave rise to this cause of action—the\n10  formulation and execution of the versions of MD 219—occurred in Nevada and the \n11  Defendants reside in Nevada. For purposes of this Consent Decree and any action to \n12  enforce this Consent Decree, Defendants consent to the Court’s jurisdiction over this \n13  Consent Decree and any such enforcement action and consents to venue in this judicial \n14  district.  \n15  IV. CLASS DEFINITION\n16  25. The Court certified a class of all current or future inmates within NDOC custody who (a)\n17  who are or will be in the legal custody of NDOC; (b) who have been incarcerated for at\n18  least 21 days and have at least 12 weeks remaining on their sentence; (c) who have been\n19  diagnosed with chronic HCV and are candidates for DAA [Direct Acting Antiviral]\n20  treatment pursuant to the proper medical standard of care; and (d) for whom DAA\n21  treatment  has  been  or  will  be  denied,  withheld,  or  delayed  based  on  policies  or\n22  considerations that deviate from the proper medical standard of care. (ECF No. 21)\n23  26. For the purposes of this Consent Decree, the Parties agree that all individuals with HCV\n24  incarcerated within an NDOC facility now or in the future shall be considered a member\n25  of the class making them eligible for DAA treatment, if medically indicated.\n26  V. APPLICABILITY\n27  27. The obligations of this Consent Decree apply to and are binding upon the Parties, including\n28  any successor agencies or other entities or persons otherwise bound by law.\n6 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 7 of 24\n1  28. Within ten (10) days of the Effective Date, Defendants shall provide a copy of this Consent\n2  Decree to all officers, employees, physicians, and agents whose duties might reasonably\n3  include compliance with any provision of this Consent Decree. Defendants shall also\n4  provide a copy of this Consent Decree to any third parties retained by Defendants to\n5  implement this Consent Decree. In any action to enforce this Consent Decree, Defendants\n6  shall not raise as a defense the failure by any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,\n7  or physicians to take any actions necessary to comply with the provisions of this Consent\n8  Decree.\n9  VI. SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS\n10  A. HCV Policies and Procedures\n11  29. Defendants agree to adopt and follow the revised version of MD 219, attached and\n12  incorporated as Appendix A, and the revised version of the HCV Consent Agreement,\n13  attached and incorporated as Appendix B.\n14  30. Defendants  agree  not  to  use  any  nonmedical  reason  to  deny  class  members  DAA\n15  Treatment, or delay DAA Treatment except as specified in Appendix A or Appendix B.\n16  31. Defendants will not modify or replace MD 219 or the HCV Consent Agreement during the\n17  time frame in which this Consent Decree is in force, without approval of the Court.\n18  B. Testing\n19  32. Defendants agree to test all inmates in the custody of NDOC for HCV by December 31,\n20  2020.\n21  33. Defendants will continue to test all inmates for HCV during the intake process, unless an\n22  inmate refuses or choose to opt-out of the testing.\n23  34. By January 11, 2021, Defendants will screen and prioritize all Class Members using the\n24  criteria in the revised version of MD 219, attached as Appendix A.\n25  C. Treatment\n26  35. Defendants represent and warrant that, to the best of their current knowledge, as of the\n27  Effective Date there are fewer than 2,400 inmates in NDOC custody who have chronic\n28  HCV.\n7 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 8 of 24\n1  36. Within six (6) months from the approval of this Consent Decree by the IFC or Legislature,\n2  Defendants will provide DAA Treatment to all inmates who are prioritized as Priority One,\n3  as that term is further defined and described in MD 219, so long as there is no medical\n4  contraindication as set forth in MD 219. Appendix A.\n5  37. Within three (3) years from the Effective Date, Defendants will provide DAA treatment to\n6  a minimum of 2,400 Class Members based on the following timeline:\n7  a. A minimum of 1,200 Class Members within the first twelve (12) month period after\n8  the  Effective  Date  (for  purposes  of  this  provision  any  inmates  treated  under\n9  Paragraph 36 shall be considered as part of the 1,200 inmates);\n10  b. A minimum of an additional 600 Class Members within the second (12) month\n11  period after the Effective Date; and\n12  c. A minimum of an additional 600 Class Members within the third (12) month period\n13  after the Effective Date.\n14  38. After the above timeline is completed, thirty-six (36) months after the Effective Date,\n15  Defendants agree to provide DAA treatment to Class Members within NDOC’s custody at\n16  a rate that, at a minimum, exceeds the HCV infection rate of new inmates who test HCV\n17  positive, or who are confirmed to be HCV positive, during the intake process. For the\n18  avoidance of ambiguity, if an additional 600 inmates tested positive for HCV during intake\n19  in one calendar year, then Defendants agree to provide DAA treatment to at least 600 Class\n20  Members in the same calendar year.\n21  D. Monitoring\n22  39. Class Counsel agree to be appointed as Monitors for the purposes of this Consent Decree.\n23  40. For the duration of the Consent Decree, Defendants agree to timely provide Monitors and\n24  the Court, in accordance with the Stipulated Protective Order and filed under seal or\n25  redacted as necessary, with copies of Minutes of the HCV Committee within fourteen (14)\n26  days of each meeting  and comprehensive quarterly reports containing the following\n27  categories of information:\n28  a. The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period;\n8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 9 of 24\n1  b. The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period\n2  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV);\n3  c. The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication\n4  of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA\n5  Treatment was initiated) during the reporting period;\n6  d. The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an\n7  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which\n8  DAA Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period;\n9  e. The  number  of  inmates  who  obtained  SVR  (cure)  after  completion  of  DAA\n10  treatment during the reporting period.\n11  f. The number of inmates who were tested after receiving DAA treatment but did not\n12  obtain SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment during the reporting period.\n13  g. The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with\n14  information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period.\n15  41. Defendants agree to cooperate with Class Counsel to ensure that the above information is\n16  provided in a reasonably usable and accessible format on a timely basis.\n17  E. Attorney’s Fees\n18  42. Subject to separate approval by the Board of Examiners, the Parties agree Defendants will\n19  provide an attorney’s fees award of $160,000 to Class Counsel (“Award”), which is a\n20  discounted amount that Class Counsel has agreed to accept. The Consent Decree, without\n21  the Award, can be separately approved by the IFC and/or Legislature even if the Board of\n22  Examiners does not approve the Award. Should approval be provided to the Consent\n23  Decree but not the Award, the Parties agree that Class Counsel may seek the  non-\n24  discounted amount of their attorney’s fees as provided herein. The Award also includes\n25  attorney’s fees for ongoing monitoring to which Class Counsel may otherwise be entitled,\n26  and, if approved, precludes a separate request by Class Counsel for the same. Upon\n27  approval of the Award, apart from the Award  and except as otherwise specified herein, the\n28 \n9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 10 of 24\n \n1  Parties agree to bear their own attorney’s fees arising from the litigation prior to the \n2  Effective Date. \n3  43. If the Award is not approved by the Board of Examiners, then the Parties agree this Consent \n4  Decree does not resolve the issues of whether Class Counsel are entitled to attorney’s fees \n5  or the amount of those fees should they be awarded. The Parties agree to submit the matter \n6  of whether attorney’s fees are appropriate and the amount of those fees should they be \n7  awarded, to Magistrate Judge Baldwin for a Report and Recommendation.  \n8  44. If the Award is not approved, the Parties agree that this Consent Decree shall not be deemed \n9  to be an acknowledgement or admission that either Party is deemed to be a prevailing party \n10  due to the Consent Decree. Plaintiffs assert they are the prevailing party in this action and \n11  reserve the right to seek attorney’s fees. Defendants do not agree and reserve the right to \n12  contest that Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties in this action, that Class Counsel is entitled \n13  to any attorney’s fees, and the amount of attorney fees requested by Plaintiffs. Each Party \n14  may rely on this Consent Decree and Appendix A in order to make their respective \n15  arguments as to whether either party is a prevailing party and to argue the appropriateness \n16  of attorney’s fees being provided to either Party. \n17  45. Any Party who is successful in any future motion or proceeding to enforce the terms of the \n18  Consent Decree, will be entitled to seek and collect reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of \n19  suit incurred in prosecuting or defending such motions.  \n20  F.  Costs \n21  46. Defendants agree to reimburse the Federal Pro Bono Program and Class Counsel for costs \n22  and expert witness fees in an amount not to exceed $25,000. Class Counsel agrees to \n23  provide NDOC’s counsel with receipts, invoices, or other documentation needed to support \n24  the reimbursement of the Federal Pro Bono Program and Class Counsel for these amounts \n25  not to exceed $25,000 in total. Apart from this reimbursement, and except as otherwise \n26  specified herein, the Parties agree to bear their own costs arising from the litigation prior \n27  to the Effective Date.  \n28  // \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 11 of 24\n1  G. Incentive Awards\n2  47. The Parties agree that this Consent Decree shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement\n3  or admission that any Class Representative is entitled to an Incentive Award due to the\n4  Consent Decree.  Should any Class Representative with an existing case related to HCV\n5  seek an Incentive Award, NDOC agrees to not oppose such requests on the grounds that\n6  they are made in the separate action rather than the class or consolidated action, but reserves\n7  the right to challenge whether any Class Representative is entitled to Incentive Fees or\n8  monetary damages.\n9  H. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n10  48. Any dispute shall be submitted to the Court for a hearing on the issues.\n11  I. NOTICE TO THE CLASS\n12  49. Prior to a fairness hearing, and early enough to provide practicable notice, the Parties will\n13  provide Class Members with  notice of the proposed Consent  Decree  and provide  a\n14  mechanism for ascertainable Class Representatives and Class Members to provide input\n15  prior to or at the fairness hearing. The Parties also will provide ascertainable Class\n16  Representatives and Class Members with an additional opt-out period prior to the fairness\n17  hearing.\n18  50. Defendants shall ensure that written notice to the Class Members is made known by posting\n19  in conspicuous places throughout the NDOC institutions a notice to be jointly drafted by\n20  the Parties’ counsel following approval of this Consent Decree. The notice will be posted\n21  within ten (10) days of it being agreed to by the Parties (and the Court should the Court\n22  require its approval) and shall be posted for a minimum of thirty (30) days. Defendants\n23  may also choose—but are not obligated to—place a copy of the notice in any medical file\n24  of any identifiable HCV Inmate Patient.\n25  J. ACCESS TO RELEVANT DOCUMENTS\n26  51. The Parties agree that Class Counsel and the Court shall have access to all documents\n27  necessary and relevant to the implementation of this Consent Decree subject to the terms\n28 \n11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 12 of 24\n1  of the Stipulated Protective Order in this action and in a manner consistent with HIPAA’s \n2  protections regarding Protected Health Information.  \n3  K. EFFECT OF SETTLEMENT/RESERVATION OF RIGHTS\n4  52. The Consent Decree shall be deemed to serve as a final judgment and resolution of claims\n5  for  prospective  relief  concerning  Defendants’  policies  and  practices  for  testing  and\n6  treatment of HCV, including MD 219 and the Consent Agreement. The Parties agree that\n7  nothing in this Consent Decree precludes the Class Representatives or any other Class\n8  Member from continuing their current individual lawsuits, or bringing future lawsuits,\n9  seeking monetary damages. The Parties also agree that nothing in this Consent Decree\n10  precludes any plaintiff from asserting other claims that do not pertain to the general\n11  prospective relief issues addressed in the Consent Decree; further, a plaintiff may seek\n12  injunctive relief for their individual claims based on the application of the revised policies\n13  to that individual. The Consent Decree is not to be construed and shall never at any time\n14  for any purpose be considered an admission of liability on the part of Defendants who\n15  reserve all rights to defend themselves against any current or future claims, including for\n16  monetary damages claims, without waiving any potential defenses, including sovereign\n17  immunity,  Eleventh  Amendment  Immunity,  qualified  immunity,  discretionary  acts\n18  immunity, and any other common law, statutory defense, or affirmative defense that may\n19  be applicable as a defense against any claim brought by a Class Member against the State,\n20  NDOC, or any individual state employee in the future.\n21  53.

These guidelines assist medical practitioners in evaluating patients. However, \nnothing in these guidelines take precedence over a case-by-case determination of the medical \nneeds of the patient. The goal of treatment of Hepatitis C-infected persons is to reduce Hepatitis-\nC transmission and associated morbidity and mortality by the timely achievement of a virologic \ncure as evidenced by a sustained virologic response.  \n \n \nAUTHORITY: \n \nAR 621, NRS 209.381, NAC 441A, NAC 441A.570 \n \nRESPONSIBILITY: \n \nMedical Division staff has the responsibility to have knowledge of and comply with this procedure. \n \nDEFINITIONS: \n \nHEPATITIS C - A blood borne pathogen transmitted primarily by way of percutaneous exposure \nto blood. \n \nHCV – Chronic Hepatitis C as diagnosed by a qualified medical practitioner \n \nDAA – Direct Acting Antiviral treatment in the form of an FDA-approved treatment for HCV, \nwhich  may  include,  without  limitation,  Epclusa  (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir)  or  Mavyret \n(glecaprevir/pibrentasvir)  \n \nPRACTITIONER - Physician, Physician Assistant, or Advanced Practice Registered Nurse \n \nPROCEDURES:  \n \n219.01 TESTING FOR HEPATITIS C AT INTAKE \n \n1  Unless an inmate refuses or chooses to opt out of Hepatitis C testing, all inmates will be \ntested for Hepatitis C during the Intake process and all inmates who have not previously \nbeen tested will be tested.  Inmates who refuse Hepatitis testing must sign a DOC 2523 at \nthe point of refusal. If at any time in the future the State of Nevada requires Hepatitis C to \nbe a mandatory test (e.g., TB), then inmates will not be provided the opportunity to opt \nHEPATITIS C, TREATMENT OF  MEDICAL DIRECTIVE # 219             Page 1 of 6   \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 17 of 24\n \nout of testing, and any inmate who previously opted out will be required to cooperate in \ntesting. \n \n2  The following are CDC identified risk factors for a possible Hepatitis C infection to guide \nwhether an inmate should be re-tested for Hepatitis C: \n \na.  Ever injected illegal drugs or shared equipment (including intranasal use of illicit \ndrugs) \n \nb.  Received tattoos or body piercings while in jail or prison, or from any unregulated \nsource \n \nc.  HIV or chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection \n \nd.  Received a blood transfusion or an organ transplant before 1992, received clotting \nfactor transfusion prior to 1987, or received blood from a donor who later tested \npositive for HCV infection \n \ne.  History of percutaneous exposure to blood \n \nf.  Ever received hemodialysis \n \ng.  Born to a mother who had HCV infection at the time of delivery \n \nh.  Born between 1945 and 1965 \n \n219.02 EVALUATION FOR HEPATITIS C TREATMENT \n \nInstitutional procedure: \n \na.  All inmates who have tested positive for HCV are candidates for treatment with \nDAAs.  \n \nb.  All inmates with HCV will  receive DAA treatment unless there are medical reasons \nindicating treatment with DAAs is not medically appropriate or necessary. Inmates \nwith HCV will be prioritized in accordance with the medical priorities outlined in \nMD 219.04.  \n \nc.  All candidates must be enrolled in the Infectious Disease Chronic Clinic for \nHepatitis C using DOC 2689 Chronic Disease Clinic Enrollment Form and the \nenrollment entered into NOTIS. \n \nd.  NDOC will maintain an HCV Committee which shall consist of the Medical \nDirector or designee and at least two (2) institutional practitioners. The HCV \nCommittee shall meet at least once per month. \n \ne.  The HCV Committee shall be presented with a DOC 2698 Hepatitis C Patient Data \nForm with all backup documentation for each case to be discussed during the \nHEPATITIS C, TREATMENT OF  MEDICAL DIRECTIVE # 219             Page 2 of 6   \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 18 of 24\n \nmeeting. \n \nf.  In accordance with this Medical Directive, the Committee will discuss medical \ncases of HCV inmate patients related to prioritization, classification, and evaluation \nand shall make referrals to an outside provider for DAA treatment. \n \ng.  Medical staff will initiate Hepatitis C Treatment protocol orders per DOC 2518 \nPhysician Orders – Hep C. \n \nh.  Inmate patients will be scheduled with a provider to review and sign DOC 2730 \nHepatitis C Treatment Consent-Agreement.  \n \ni.  The inmate patient will be informed that noncompliance with DOC \n2730  Hepatitis  C  Treatment  Consent-Agreement  will  result  in  the \ninmate patient being responsible for all future costs of HCV treatment \nif  they  become  re-infected  after  successfully  completing  the  DAA \nTreatment and obtaining SVR.  \n \nii.  The inmate patient will be informed that noncompliance with DOC \n2730 Hepatitis C Treatment Consent-Agreement may result in the delay \nof  HCV  treatment  for  medical  reasons  based  on  the  Practitioner’s \nmedical opinion. Any possible delay in treatment will not occur if the \ndelay in treatment would cause the inmate patient’s medical condition \nto worsen or would result in patients in a lower priority level (as defined \nin MD 219.04) being sequenced for treatment before the inmate patient \nper MD 219.04. Instead, any delay may result in the inmate patient being \nplaced after similarly situated medical patients but still within the same \npriority level for treatment.   \n \niii.  The  inmate  patient’s  prior  six-month  disciplinary  history  will  be \nreviewed for evidence of high-risk behaviors for HCV infection. The \ninmate patient will be provided with necessary resources to educate the \npatient as to the dangers of high-risk behaviors (fresh tattoos, drug use, \npossession of controlled substances or alcohol, assaultive behavior, and \nany sexual activity) and provided with resources to overcome any \npotential addiction. The disciplinary history review will not be used to \ndeny or delay DAA Treatment unless a Practitioner identifies medical \nreasons  indicating  that  treatment  with  DAAs  is  not  medically \nappropriate or necessary at the time. \n \n \ni.  Any inmates with HCV who have not been treated with DAAs will be evaluated \nevery six months (including obtaining a new APRI score), per Medical Directive \n447, Attachment A. \n \n219.03 TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C \n \na.  All inmates who have tested positive for HCV are candidates for treatment with \nDAAs so long as they have sufficient time remaining on their sentence. Sufficient \nHEPATITIS C, TREATMENT OF  MEDICAL DIRECTIVE # 219             Page 3 of 6   \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 19 of 24\n \ntime is defined for the purposes of this section as 120 days remaining on the \nsentence from the beginning date of the DAA Treatment.  \n \nb.  Treatment will be conducted in conformity with MD 219.04 and MD 219.05. \n \n219.04 PRIORITY CRITERIA FOR HEPATITIS C TREATMENT \n \nTreating patients during incarceration saves lives and reduces the transmission of HCV among \npeople with high-risk behaviors.  Although almost all patients with HCV will benefit from \ntreatment, certain patients are at higher-risk for disease progression.  Treatment of inmate patients \nshall be sequenced based on the below priority levels for more urgent administration of treatment.  \nThe following criteria have been established to ensure those with the highest need and greatest \nlikelihood of achieving a sustained viral response (cure) are identified and treated first.   \n \nPriority Level  Criteria \nPriority Level 1  •  Advanced hepatic fibrosis: APRI >2.0, Metavir or Batts/Ludwig stage 3 or 4 on \nHighest Priority for  liver biopsy, cirrhosis (FibroSure is not required to be (but may be) drawn if the \ntreatment  APRI score is 2.0 or greater). \n•  APRI score is between 0.7 and 1.9 AND Fibrosure Score of F3 or F4 \n•  Liver transplant recipients \n•  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) \n•  Comorbid conditions associated with HCV, e.g. cryoglobulinemia with renal \ndisease or vasculitis and certain types of lymphomas or hematologic \nmalignancies or porphyria cutanea tarda \n•  Immunosuppressant medication \n•  Continuity of care: when started on treatment prior to incarceration \nPriority Level 2  •  Evidence for progressive fibrosis: APRI score > 0.70, stage 2 fibrosis on liver \nIntermediate Priority  biopsy \nfor treatment  •  APRI score is less than 0.7, but constitutional signs and symptoms (i.e. bleeding \nor bruising easily, ascites and/or jaundice) are present (FibroSure is not required \nto be (but may be) drawn if the APRI score is 0.69 or less). If an inmate patient’s \nAPRI score is less than 0.7, but constitutional signs and symptoms (i.e. bleeding \nor bruising easily, ascites and/or jaundice) are present, the inmate patient may be \nevaluated further) \n•  Comorbid Medical conditions such as coinfection with HBV or HIV, comorbid liver \ndiseases (autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, steatohepatitis) \n•  Diabetes mellitus \n•  Chronic kidney disease (CKD); GFR < 59 mL/min \nPriority Level 3  •  Stage 0 to stage 1 fibrosis on liver biopsy \nAll other candidates   •  APRI <0.70 with no constitutional signs and symptoms (i.e. bleeding or bruising \neasily, ascites and/or jaundice) present (Fibrosure is not required to be (but may \nbe drawn if the APRI score is 0.69 or less)) \n•  All other cases of HCV infection meeting the eligibility criteria for treatment as \nnoted below under Other Criteria for Treatment \nHEPATITIS C, TREATMENT OF  MEDICAL DIRECTIVE # 219             Page 4 of 6   \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 20 of 24\n \n \n*\nEXCEPTIONS to the above criteria for PRIORITY LEVEL 1-3 will be made on an \nindividual basis and will be determined primarily by a compelling or urgent need for \ntreatment, such as evidence for rapid progression of fibrosis, or deteriorating health status \nfrom other comorbidities. \n \n219.05 POSSIBLE CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR TREAMENT: \n \nBelow are issues that could possibly lead to a contraindication for DAA Treatment. \nTherefore, should any of these conditions be present, medical evaluations may be necessary \nas per MD 219.03 and 219.04. The medical evaluations will be performed by Practitioner \nexamining the inmate patient as part of the inmate patient’s enrollment in the Chronic Care \nClinic. These contraindications include: \n \na.  Insufficient  time  remaining  on  the  sentence  to  complete  DAA  treatment. \nInsufficient time is defined as fewer than 120 days remaining on the sentence in \nNDOC.  \n \nb.  Contraindications to any component of the treatment regimens (including other \nmedications that may be necessary in conjunction with DAA Treatment). \n \nc.   Failure to complete the pretreatment evaluation process, or an unwillingness to \ncommit or consent to HCV treatment. \n \n \nd.  Severe decompensated liver disease. \n \ne.  Any other end stage disease process that would cause a contraindication to the DAA \nTreatment. \n \nf.  Current pregnancy. \n \n \ng.  Life expectancy of less than twelve (12) months. \n \nh.  Uncontrolled seizures. \n \ni.  Failure  to  maintain  compliance  with  signed  Hepatitis  C  Treatment \nConsent/Agreement (DOC 2730), which may result in a medical need to delay \ntreatment on a case-by-case basis as determined by the medical provider. Any \npossible delay in treatment will not occur if the delay in treatment would cause the \nmedical condition to worsen or would result in patients with a lower priority level \n(as defined in MD 219.04) being sequenced for treatment before the patient in \nquestion per MD 219.04. Instead, any delay may result in the patient in question \nbeing placed after similarly situated medical patients but still within the same \npriority level for treatment.   \n \nj.  Boarders from other political subdivisions of the State of Nevada will be considered \nfor treatment based on their priority level, but after all non-boarders within the same \npriority level as referenced in 219.04 receive treatment. \n \nHEPATITIS C, TREATMENT OF  MEDICAL DIRECTIVE # 219             Page 5 of 6   \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 21 of 24\n \nREFERENCES: \n \nFederal Bureau of Prisons Clinical Practice Guidelines, “Evaluation and Management of Chronic \nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection”, August 2018. \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n________________________________________      _________________ \nMichael Minev, M.D., Medical Director          Date \n \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL  _____        X   \n        Yes       No \n \n \n \nTHIS PROCEDURE SUPERSEDES ALL PRIOR WRITTEN PROCEDURES ON THIS \nSPECIFIC SUBJECT. \nHEPATITIS C, TREATMENT OF  MEDICAL DIRECTIVE # 219             Page 6 of 6   \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 22 of 24\nAPPENDIX B \nHCV Consent Agreement \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX B \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 23 of 24\n \n \n \nTreatment of Hepatitis C is available to all patients but is prioritized to patients who understand the commitment to \ntherapy, will tolerate and comply with the course of treatment, and agree to avoid all activities that may worsen their \nliver disease or infect themselves or others with the Hepatitis C virus or other bloodborne pathogens. Every patient \nmust complete this consent/agreement before initiation of therapy. \n(Please initial each statement and sign below to indicate your understanding of all parts of this document) \n_____ I understand that there is a possibility that the therapy may be of no benefit to me and that it may not get rid of \nmy Hepatitis C infection. \n_____ I have been informed that side effects of treatment of Hepatitis C may include fatigue, body aches, and other \nserious side effects that may continue through my treatment with the medication. \n_____ I understand that I may be tested for HIV before beginning treatment as the presence of the HIV virus could \nseriously affect my Hepatitis C infection and its treatment. \n_____ I understand that the treatment with medication typically lasts between 8-12 weeks, but may continue for up to 36 \nweeks and that frequent blood testing may be needed to check for side effects or other problems. To the extent your \ntreatment is not completed before the expiration of your sentence (which will only occur in the rare instance that you \nbegin treatment within 120 days of your expiration date), you will be responsible for ensuring that the treatment is \ncompleted upon release from NDOC custody because any interruption in the treatment could result in the treatment being \nunsuccessful. \n_____ I understand that treatment for Hepatitis C may, in certain patients, cause mental health side effects, especially \ndepression. \n_____ I understand that I should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment, and that I should use two forms of \nbirth control during heterosexual activity while taking medication, and for six months after, in an effort to avoid \npregnancy. \n_____ I understand that my failure to comply with the medication, blood testing, or regular appointments may result in \na medical need for my provider stopping the therapy. \n_____ I understand that alcohol injures the liver and that drinking alcohol is forbidden. \n_____ I understand that I must abstain from any activity that may transmit the Hepatitis C virus or other bloodborne \npathogens. This includes tattooing, sexual activity in NDOC custody, IV drug use, and intranasal drug use.  \n_____ If I become reinfected after the completion of the course of treatment due to my decision to engage in tattooing, \nsexual activity, IV drug use, intranasal drug use, or other prohibited behaviors, I may be charged for the cost of future \ntreatment. \n_____ I understand that I may be required to undergo random blood or urine testing for illegal substances.  \n_____ I understand that failure to comply with this agreement, including but not limited to testing positive for illegal \nsubstances or engaging in other prohibited behaviors, could increase the likelihood of re-infection or could reduce the \nlikelihood of successful treatment. I understand that should I engage in any of these prohibited activities my medical \nprovider may (but is not required to) delay treatment if that provider believes the medical benefits of treating other \nmedical conditions (that would lead me to becoming more susceptible to re-infection or other health consequences) \nprior to initiating treatment outweigh the risks of delaying treatment. However, I also understand that any possible delay \nin treatment will not occur if the delay in treatment would cause my medical condition to worsen or would result in \npatients in a lower priority level (as defined in MD 219.04) being sequenced for treatment before me per MD 219.04. \nInstead, any delay may result in me being placed after similarly situated medical patients but still within the same \npriority level for treatment.  \n_____ My initials above and my signature below signify my understanding of, and agreement to comply with, the \nrequirements.  \n \n  \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 80   Filed 10/29/20   Page 24 of 24\n \n                               \n \n     \nInmate/patient Name: \n \nInmate/patient Signature:     Date:       /       \n      / \nClinician Name: \n \nClinician Signature:     Date:       /       \n \n        / \nNEVADA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  NAME: \nHEPATITIS C TREATMENT  Last  First \nID: \nCONSENT/AGREEMENT \n     \n \nDOC 2730 (08/19) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     ",

OVERVIEW \n23  For the third reporting period, the Defendants represent that the fundamental aspects of the \n24  Consent Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned. However, there is a delay in scaling \n25  up the treatment due what NDOC represents is provider availability. NDOC contends that this has \n26  and will be, largely, mitigated by the new directive to write the prescriptions by the providers at \n27  each institution. As detailed below, Class counsel has significant concerns about delays and the \n28  ability of Defendants to meet the upcoming deadline.  \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 103   Filed 08/05/21   Page 2 of 10\n \n1  The Parties have been able to work together to improve NDOC’s public health education \n2  efforts about HCV, which has already resulted in persons who have previously refused testing \n3  getting tested.  \n4  This Report does not request relief or other intervention by the Court at this time. Class \n5  Counsel requests that a status conference be set shortly after the Consent Decree’s October 29, \n6  2021, deadline to treat class members. \n7  II.  STANDARD OF CARE \n8  The Parties have not identified any changes to the medical standard of care for HCV that \n9  would warrant alterations of the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the AASLD and the \n10  IDSA  were  updated  on  August  27,  2020,  and  continue  to  recommend  direct-acting  antiviral \n11  treatment. https://www.hcvguidelines.org.  \n12  III.  TESTING  \n13  Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the custody \n14  of NDOC for HCV by December 31, 2020.” (ECF No. 80). Defendants report that all inmates that \n15  were in NDOC’s physical custody as of December 31, 2020, have been tested. Defendants also \n16  report  that  inmates  that  are  new  to  NDOC  or  inmates  that  have  returned  from  out  of  state \n17  placements are still in the process of being tested and are being tested on an ongoing basis.  \n18  Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all Class \n19  Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). Defendants report \n20  that all inmates with known test results have been prioritized. Inmates that still need be tested, as set \n21  forth above, will be prioritized as the results become known.  \n22  Class Counsel has suggested that, given the lower-than-expected number of inmates with \n23  chronic HCV, Defendants should not delay the provision of treatment by waiting for the medical \n24  tests that may be used for prioritization but not for treatment. Class Counsel understand that Dr. \n25  Minev is in agreement with this strategy and has instructed the providers accordingly.  \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 103   Filed 08/05/21   Page 3 of 10\n \n1  IV.  ONGOING MONITORING \n2  Paragraph  40  of  the  Consent  Decree  (ECF  No.  80)  requires  Defendants  to  provide \n3  information for the following categories: \n4  a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n5  Defendants report that, between April 30, 2021, and July 27, 2021, 1,122 inmates have \n6  been tested for Hepatitis C.   \n7  Class Counsel has inquired as to the relatively high number of tests for this quarter and are \n8  awaiting further information from Defendants. Class Counsel notes that in the Q1 and Q2 status \n9  reports, Defendants reported 803 and 806 inmates were tested respectively. (See ECF No. 84, p. \n10  3:22; see also ECF No. 86, p. 3:21.)    \n11  b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n12  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n13  Defendants report that between April 30, 2021, and July 27, 2021, 74 inmates tested \n14  positive for HCV. The attached spreadsheet includes information on the date of each positive test. \n15  Exhibit A.  \n16  c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication of \n17  which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n18  was initiated) during the reporting period \n19  Defendants report that between April 30, 2021, and July 27, 2021, 74 inmates have begun \n20  DAA treatment. The attached spreadsheet includes information on the date treatment began and the \n21  type of treatment provided. Exhibit B.  \n22  d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n23  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA \n24  Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period. \n25  Defendants report that between April 30, 2021, and July 27, 2021, 104 inmates completed \n26  their treatment while in custody. 5 Inmates unexpectedly paroled mid-treatment between April 30, \n27  2021, and July 27, 2021 Inmates who were on their last month of treatment were issued their last \n28  bottle of medication upon discharge and were instructed to follow-up with their primary care \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 103   Filed 08/05/21   Page 4 of 10\n \n1  providers and/or local  health department. However, inmates who paroled during the first two \n2  months of treatment were issued the current bottle and instructed to follow-up with their primary \n3  care providers and/or local health departments so that they can resume treatment. The attached \n4  spreadsheet shows dates of the DAA treatment concluded. (See Exhibit B.)  \n5  e.  The number of inmates who obtained SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment \n6  during the reporting period \n7  Defendants  report  that  between  April  30,  202,  and  July  14,  2021,  22  inmates  have \n8  obtained SVR. Per Infectious Disease Society of America (https://www.hcvguidelines.org/), SVR is \n9  measured 12 weeks post treatment. Additionally, 2 inmates have completed their treatment while in \n10  custody, but paroled with 12 weeks post-DAA treatment and therefore SVR cannot be verified. 1 \n11  inmate completed treatment in April 2021 and was transferred to an out of state facility within 12 \n12  weeks post-DAA.  \n13  f.  The number of inmates who were tested after receiving DAA treatment but did not \n14  obtain SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment during the reporting period \n15  Defendants report that between April 30, 2021, and July 13, 2021, there are no inmates \n16  who have been confirmed to have failed treatment.  \n17  g.  The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with \n18  information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period. \n19  Defendants report that between April 30, 2021, and July 14, 2021, no inmates have been \n20  denied treatment, however, as set forth more fully below, 14 inmates require further testing and/or \n21  time before treatment can start.   \n22  Of the 14 inmates who require further work up: \n23  •  1  inmate  is  refusing  to  change  their  current  seizure  medications  that  are \n24  contraindicated to the current DAA regimen. \n25  •  1 inmate cannot start per Hopes Clinic due to a liver mass. \n26  •  1 inmate is weaning off of contraindicated seizure medications and weaning onto a \n27  new seizure regiment not contraindicated to Hep C treatment.  \n28  /// \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 103   Filed 08/05/21   Page 5 of 10\n \n1  •   9 inmates are pending additional specialist consultations, lab work, and/or imaging \n2  as recommended by Hopes.  \n3  •  2 Inmates have completed the required additional imaging or lab work and the \n4  results have been sent to Hopes for review and further evaluation.  \n5  Class Counsel have requested further information about these 14 inmates and specifically \n6  whether there is overlap between this group and the group identified in the prior status reports. For \n7  example, in the April 29, 2021 Quarterly Report, there were 10 inmates who were pending further \n8  serological testing before beginning treatment. If 9 of these inmates were still awaiting testing as of \n9  this report, then this could indicate a structural cause of delay that needs to be addressed.  \n10  The monitoring information provided by Defendants to Class Counsel includes confidential \n11  information that would merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) and the Consent \n12  Decree (ECF No. 80). The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions of these documents \n13  to this Report and believe that this is appropriate under the above documents and LR IC 6-1. Class \n14  Counsel have received unredacted versions of the documents, but the positions of the Parties are \n15  that these documents need not and should not be made a part of the official court record because it \n16  would require filing under seal.  \n17  V.  HCV COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND MINUTES \n18  Under Medical Directive 219, as incorporated into the Consent Decree, “NDOC will \n19  maintain an HCV Committee which shall consist of the Medical Director or designee and at least \n20  two (2) institutional practitioners. The HCV Committee shall meet at least once per month.” MD \n21  219.02(d) (ECF No. 61-1).  \n22  Defendants report that the HCV Committee has met on May 5, 2021, June 2, 2021, and \n23  July 14, 2021. Copies of the agendas for May 5, 2021, June 2, 2021, and July 14, 2021 are attached. \n24  Exhibit C. Minutes from the May 5, 2021, June 2, 2021, and July 14, 2021 are attached. Exhibit D. \n25  The NDOC Defendants represent that these minutes reflect approval of all inmates who were \n26  considered for treatment.  \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 103   Filed 08/05/21   Page 6 of 10\n \n1  VI.  UPCOMING DEADLINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER \n2  Paragraph  37(a)  of  the  Consent  Decree  provides  that  1,200  Class  Members  must  be \n3  provided treatment by October 29, 2021.  \n4  Defendants contend that they are largely in compliance with the terms of the consent \n5  decree. Defendants represent that all inmates have been tested, new inmates are being tested, \n6  existing  inmates  are  being  treated,  and  the  Defendants  are  scheduling  pretreatment  screening \n7  appointments as quickly as possible given provider availability.  \n8  In  order  to  complete  the  remaining  treatment  by  the  October  29,  2021,  deadline, \n9  Defendants report that the providers at all the institutions have been instructed to start writing \n10  orders for all of the remaining HCV positive inmates immediately. (See Exhibit E ¶ 8 (Declaration \n11  of Dr. Minev, Medical Director)) Defendants will then reserve the limited consultations with the \n12  infectious  disease  specialists  for  those  who  are  medically  unstable  and  require  the  specialty \n13  consultation.  Additionally, the Medical Director instructed that all HCV Protocol labs must be \n14  completed by July 31, 2021. (See Exhibit E ¶ 9) This will allow the order process discussed above. \n15  Class Counsel continue to have significant concerns that Defendants are not on track to \n16  satisfy the October 29, 2021, treatment deadline established in the Consent Decree. In the first \n17  quarter, 15 inmates began treatment. (ECF No. 84, p. 4:15). In the second quarter, 85 inmates began \n18  treatment. (ECF No. 86, p. 4:4-5). In the third quarter, 74 inmates began treatment. Infra. Thus, 174 \n19  inmates have  begun treatment  through three-quarters of the year  out of the 1,200 individuals \n20  required to receive treatment after one-year. Defendants have identified approximately 810 inmates \n21  with chronic HCV requiring treatment under the Consent Decree, which would leave approximately \n22  636 inmates who must be treated in the fourth quarter by October 29, 2021. The jump from treating \n23  15, 85, or 74 inmates in a quarter to treating 636 inmates in a quarter appears unlikely to Class \n24  Counsel. Defendants have informed class counsel that they have altered their methodology for \n25  scheduling and administering treatment and have expressed confidence that they will still meet the \n26  deadlines in the Consent Decree, but Class Counsel continue to have the same concerns and have \n27  urged Defendants to take all possible steps to expedite treatment.   \n28  /// \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 103   Filed 08/05/21   Page 7 of 10\n \n1  VII.  EDUCATIONAL PLAN \n2  Information Provided by Defendants \n3  The information contained in the CDC handouts has been added to the television channels in \n4  each institution with that capability. (See Exhibit E ¶ 10.) This information has also been provided \n5  to all inmates who previously opted out of treatment, and will be posted at each institution. The \n6  Medical Director has also found videos produced by the Veteran’s Administration relating to HCV \n7  and providing information to the inmates. These will also be added to the television programing at \n8  the  institutions.  (See  Exhibit  E  ¶  11)  A  copy  of  the  video  may  be  found  at: \n9  https://www.hepatitis.va.gov/products/video-index.asp. This video is being downloaded to DVD \n10  and will be shown at all of the institutions with television capabilities.  (See Exhibit E ¶ 11) The \n11  institutions will also provide information upon intake, for all new inmates.  (See Exhibit E ¶ 5) This \n12  Court asked the Defendants to look into the option for possible group counseling for all of the HCV \n13  positive inmates who have refused treatment or inmates who have refused testing. In discussions \n14  with the Medical Director, that would be difficult, as it would not be possible to counsel inmates in \n15  a group setting while protecting their privacy concerns.  Many inmates do not want their status \n16  made public.  \n17  Response from Class Counsel \n18  Class Counsel is pleased that, after being required to do so by the Court, Defendants have \n19  agreed to a meaningful public health educational plan. Further, Defendants have advised Class \n20  Counsel that the provision of additional educational materials has resulted in at least 10 inmates \n21  who have opted-in to HCV testing after initially opting out. Class Counsel is encouraged that the \n22  steps  they  requested,  and  the  Court  endorsed  in  terms  of  providing  inmates  with  a  second \n23  opportunity to receive testing after they receive further education has already yielded successes. \n24  Class Counsel has requested further quantitative data in order to confirm that all of those inmates \n25  who opted out of testing have been provided with the enhanced educational materials and provided \n26  with an opportunity for re-testing.  \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 103   Filed 08/05/21   Page 8 of 10\n \n1  Further, Class Counsel contends that inmates who agree would be able to provide and \n2  participate in peer health education without privacy issues. \n3  Dated August 5, 2021. \n \n4 \n   \n  AARON D.

This Report \n20  does not request relief or other intervention by the Court at this time.  \n21  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n22  I.  INTRODUCTION \n23  The Parties believe the consent decree is being followed as envisioned and that there are \n24  no issues that require the Court’s intervention at this time. The Parties also do not believe that a \n25  status check is required this quarter.  \n26  The  monitoring  information  provided  by  Defendants  to  Class  Counsel  includes \n27  confidential information that would merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) and \n28  the Consent Decree (ECF No. 80). The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions of \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 123   Filed 11/16/22   Page 2 of 7\n \n1  these documents to this Report and believe that this is appropriate under the above documents and \n2  LR IC 6-1. Class Counsel have received unredacted versions of the documents, but do not need to \n3  make these documents part of the court record, requiring filing under seal, unless the Court \n4  disagrees.   \n5  For this reporting period, the Parties can represent that the fundamental aspects of the \n6  Consent Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned. The Consent Decree is functioning \n7  to timely and comprehensively provide treatment to inmates in NDOC custody. In the prior \n8  quarter, 1160 inmates were tested for Hepatitis C; 85 inmates tested positive; 104 inmates started \n9  DAA treatment; and 26 inmates were cured after the completion of their DAA treatment.        \n10  II.  TESTING AND TREATMENT \n11  Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the custody \n12  of NDOC for HCV by December 31, 2020.” (ECF No. 80). This has been accomplished by \n13  Defendants, except for some inmates who are currently in the intake process and others who have \n14  recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories are in line to \n15  be tested and will be tested on an ongoing basis.  \n16  Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all Class \n17  Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). This has been \n18  accomplished by Defendants, again except for inmates who are currently in the intake process or \n19  who have recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Defendants are no longer \n20  prioritizing or sequencing inmates for HCV treatment, which is a positive change that Class \n21  Counsel agrees with.  \n22  The Parties have investigated but not identified any changes to the medical standard of care \n23  for HCV that would warrant alterations of the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the \n24  AASLD and the IDSA were updated on October 24, 2022 and continue to recommend direct-\n25  acting antiviral treatment (“Glecaprevir (300 mg) / pibrentasvir (120 mg) to be taken with food for \n26  a duration of 8 weeks; Sofosbuvir (400 mg) / velpatasvir (100 mg) for a duration of 12 weeks”). \n27  https://www.hcvguidelines.org;  https://www.hcvguidelines.org/treatment-naive/simplified- \n28  treatment.  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 123   Filed 11/16/22   Page 3 of 7\n \n1  III.  ONGOING MONITORING \n2  Paragraph  40  of  the  Consent  Decree  (ECF  No.  80)  requires  Defendants  to  provide \n3  information for the following categories: \n4  a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n5  Between July 29, 2022 to October 29, 2022, 1160 inmates were tested for Hepatitis C. \n6  Exhibit A. \n7  b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n8  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n9  Between July 29, 2022 to October 29, 2022, 85 inmates tested positive for Hepatitis C.  \n10  Please see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “POSITIVE” for additional details. Exhibit \n11  B. \n12  c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication of \n13  which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n14  was initiated) during the reporting period \n15  Between July 29, 2022 to October 29, 2022, 104 inmates began receiving DAA treatment \n16  for Hepatitis C.  Please see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “TX Started” for additional \n17  details. Exhibit C. \n18  d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n19  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA \n20  Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period \n21  Between July 29, 2022 to October 29, 2022, 53 inmates concluded their course of DAA \n22  treatment in custody.  Please see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “TX Ended” for \n23  additional details. Exhibit D. \n24  e.  The number of inmates who obtained SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment \n25  during the reporting period \n26  Between July 29, 2022 to October 29, 2022, 26 inmates were verified to have obtained \n27  SVR after completion of DAA treatment.

The number of inmates who were tested after receiving DAA treatment but did not \n2  obtain SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment during the reporting period \n3  Between July 29, 2022 to October 29, 2022, 3 inmates were verified to have NOT obtained \n4  SVR after completion of DAA treatment. Exhibit F.  \n5  g.  The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with \n6  information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period. \n7  Between July 29, 2022 to October 29, 2022, 44 inmates were denied or delayed.  Please \n8  see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “Deny-Delay” for additional details.  Two inmates \n9  have medications contraindicated to DAA treatment.  Six inmates are on-going GI evaluation and \n10  treatment  due  to  various  complications.    Three  inmates  are  pending  infectious  disease \n11  appointments due to previous Hep C treatments and Genotype 3.  Three inmates have their \n12  medications ordered already and they are pending delivery from outside pharmacies.  Two inmates \n13  are pending ultrasounds due to cirrhosis and to rule out liver cancer.  Three inmates are releasing \n14  within 84 days.  Seven inmates were seen by the infectious disease specialist who did not start \n15  treatment due to the offender self-reporting that they will parole within 84 days.  Eighteen inmates \n16  were released before treatment could begin. Exhibit G. \n17  IV.  HCV COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND MINUTES \n18  Under Medical Directive 219, as incorporated into the Consent Decree, “NDOC will \n19  maintain an HCV Committee which shall consist of the Medical Director or designee and at least \n20  two (2) institutional practitioners. The HCV Committee shall meet at least once per month.” MD \n21  219.02(d) (ECF No. 61-1).  \n22  The HCV Committee has met on August 3, 2022, September 9, 2022 and October 5, 2022. \n23  Copies of the agendas for August 3, 2022, September 9, 2022 and October 5, 2022 are attached. \n24  Exhibit H. Minutes from the August 3, 2022, September 9, 2022 and October 5, 2022 are attached. \n25  Exhibit I. Defendants represent that these minutes reflect approval of all inmates who were \n26  considered for treatment.  \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 123   Filed 11/16/22   Page 5 of 7\n \n1  V.  UPCOMING DEADLINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER \n2  This coming quarter will mark the second year of monitoring after entry of the Consent \n3  Decree. Thus, that the Consent Decree requires that NDOC will provide treatment to “an additional \n4  600 Class Members within the second (12) month period after the Effective Date…,” which \n5  deadline would fall on October 29, 2022. (ECF No. 80 ¶ 37(b)). While Defendants only have \n6  provided treatment to One Hundred Nineteen (119) Class Members as of the date of this Report, \n7  this is due to the fact that all possible and medically indicated HCV positive individuals have been \n8  treated and therefore there was no remaining to treat during this timeframe. \n9  Dated November 16, 2022. \n \n10 \n   \nMcDONALD CARANO LLP   AARON D.

INTRODUCTION \n3 The Parties believe the consent decree is being followed as envisioned and that there are \n4 no issues that require the Court’s intervention at this time. The Parties also do not believe that a \n5 status check is required this quarter.  \n6 The  monitoring  information  provided  by  Defendants  to  Class  Counsel  includes \n7 confidential information that would merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) and \n8 the Consent Decree (ECF No. 80). The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions of \n9 these documents to this Report and believe that this is appropriate under the above documents and \n10 LR IC 6-1. Class Counsel have received unredacted versions of the documents, but do not need to \n11 make these documents part of the court record, requiring filing under seal, unless the Court \n12 disagrees.   \n13 For this reporting period, the Parties can represent that the fundamental aspects of the \n14 Consent Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned. The Consent Decree is functioning \n15 to timely and comprehensively provide treatment to inmates in NDOC custody. In the prior \n16 quarter, 1023 inmates were tested for Hepatitis C; 60 inmates tested positive; 36 inmates started \n17 DAA treatment; and 37 inmates were cured after the completion of their DAA treatment.        \n18 II.  TESTING AND TREATMENT \n19 Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the custody \n20 of NDOC for HCV by December 31, 2020.” (ECF No. 80). This has been accomplished by \n21 Defendants, except for some inmates who are currently in the intake process and others who have \n22 recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories are in line to \n23 be tested and will be tested on an ongoing basis.  \n24 Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all Class \n25 Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). This has been \n26 accomplished by Defendants, again except for inmates who are currently in the intake process or \n27 who have recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Defendants are no longer \n28\n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 125   Filed 02/21/23   Page 3 of 6\n \n1 prioritizing or sequencing inmates for HCV treatment, which is a positive change that Class \n2 Counsel agrees with.  \n3 The Parties have investigated but not identified any changes to the medical standard of care \n4 for HCV that would warrant alterations of the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the \n5 AASLD and the IDSA were updated on October 24, 2022 and continue to recommend direct-\n6 acting antiviral treatment (“Glecaprevir (300 mg) / pibrentasvir (120 mg) to be taken with food for \n7 a duration of 8 weeks; Sofosbuvir (400 mg) / velpatasvir (100 mg) for a duration of 12 weeks”). \n8 https://www.hcvguidelines.org;  https://www.hcvguidelines.org/treatment-naive/simplified-\n9 treatment.  \n10 III.  ONGOING MONITORING \n11 Paragraph  40  of  the  Consent  Decree  (ECF  No.  80)  requires  Defendants  to  provide \n12 information for the following categories: \n13 a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n14 Between October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, 1023 inmates were tested for Hepatitis C. \n15 Exhibit A. \n16 b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n17 (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n18 Between October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, 60 inmates tested positive for Hepatitis C.  \n19 Please see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “POSITIVE” for additional details. Exhibit \n20 B. \n21 c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication of \n22 which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n23 was initiated) during the reporting period \n24 Between October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, 36 inmates began receiving DAA treatment \n25 for Hepatitis C.  Please see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “TX Started” for additional \n26 details. Exhibit C. \n27\n28\n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 125   Filed 02/21/23   Page 4 of 6\n \n1 d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n2 indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA \n3 Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period \n4 Between October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, 95 inmates concluded their course of DAA \n5 treatment in custody.  Please see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “TX Ended” for \n6 additional details. Exhibit D. \n7 e.  The number of inmates who obtained SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment \n8 during the reporting period \n9 Between October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, 37 inmates were verified to have obtained \n10 SVR after completion of DAA treatment. Exhibit E.  \n11 f.  The number of inmates who were tested after receiving DAA treatment but did not \n12 obtain SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment during the reporting period \n13 Between October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, 0 inmates were verified to have NOT \n14 obtained SVR after completion of DAA treatment.  \n15 g.  The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with \n16 information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period. \n17 Between October 29, 2022 to January 29, 2023, 15 inmates were denied or delayed.  Please \n18 see attached spreadsheet under the tab labeled “Deny-Delay” for additional details.  Four inmates \n19 have are being worked up by a gastroenterologist due to complications for treatment (i.e. presence \n20 of a liver lesion, Hep B co-infection, previously treatment of failure). Two inmates were seen by \n21 an infectious disease specialist and no treatment was ordered because one stated they will parole \n22 before treatment would be completed and the other did not believe he has Hepatitis C despite labs \n23 and education. Finally, nine offenders were released during that time period before they could \n24 start. Exhibit F. \n25 IV.

The HCV Committee shall meet at least once per month.” MD \n2 219.02(d) (ECF No. 61-1).  \n3 The HCV Committee has met on November 2, 2022, December 7, 2022 and January 4, \n4 2023. Copies of the agendas for November 2, 2022, December 7, 2022 and January 4, 2023 are \n5 attached. Exhibit G. Minutes from the November 2, 2022, December 7, 2022 and January 4, 2023 \n6 are attached. Exhibit H. Defendants represent that these minutes reflect approval of all inmates \n7 who were considered for treatment.  \n8 V.  UPCOMING DEADLINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER \n9 This coming quarter will mark the second year of monitoring after entry of the Consent \n10 Decree. Thus, that the Consent Decree requires that NDOC will provide treatment to “an additional \n11 600 Class Members within the second (12) month period after the Effective Date…,” which \n12 deadline would fall on January 29, 2023. (ECF No. 80 ¶ 37(b)). While Defendants only have \n13 provided treatment to Thirty-Six (36) Class Members as of the date of this Report, this is due to \n14 the fact that all possible and medically indicated HCV positive individuals have been treated and \n15 therefore there was no remaining to treat during this timeframe. \n16 Dated February 21, 2023. \n \nMcDONALD CARANO LLP      \n17\n     /s/ Adam Hosmer-Henner               AARON D.

This Report \n20  does not request relief or other intervention by the Court at this time.  \n21  /// \n22  /// \n23  /// \n24  /// \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 121   Filed 08/11/22   Page 2 of 7\n \n1  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n2  I.  INTRODUCTION \n3  The Parties believe the consent decree is being followed as envisioned and that there are no \n4  issues that require the Court’s intervention at this time.  \n5  The monitoring information provided by Defendants to Class Counsel includes confidential \n6  information that would merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) and the Consent \n7  Decree (ECF No. 80). The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions of these documents \n8  to this Report and believe that this is appropriate under the above documents and LR IC 6-1. Class \n9  Counsel have received unredacted versions of the documents, but do not need to make these \n10  documents part of the court record, requiring filing under seal, unless the Court disagrees.   \n11  For this reporting period, the Parties can represent that the fundamental aspects of the \n12  Consent Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned. In fact, Class Counsel are pleased to \n13  report that after working through the logjam of cases, the constraints posed by COVID-19, and \n14  various  other  issues  among  the  parties,  the  Consent  Decree  is  functioning  to  timely  and \n15  comprehensively provide treatment to inmates in NDOC custody. In the prior quarter, 1015 inmates \n16  were tested for Hepatitis C; 77 inmates tested positive; 66 inmates started DAA treatment; and 60 \n17  inmates were cured after the completion of their DAA treatment. Class Counsel are especially \n18  pleased to report that these numbers demonstrate that treatment is not being delayed and that the \n19  incidence of Hepatitis C among inmates in NDOC custody continues to decline rapidly.      \n20  II.  TESTING AND TREATMENT \n21  Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the custody \n22  of NDOC for HCV by December 31, 2020.” (ECF No. 80). This has been accomplished by \n23  Defendants, except for some inmates who are currently in the intake process and others who have \n24  recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories are in line to be \n25  tested and will be tested on an ongoing basis.  \n26  Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all Class \n27  Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). This has been \n28  accomplished by Defendants, again except for inmates who are currently in the intake process or \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 121   Filed 08/11/22   Page 3 of 7\n \n1  who  have  recently  returned  to  Nevada  from  out-of-state  facilities.  Defendants  are  no  longer \n2  prioritizing or sequencing inmates for HCV treatment, which is a positive change that Class Counsel \n3  agrees with.  \n4  The Parties have investigated but not identified any changes to the medical standard of care \n5  for HCV that would warrant alterations of the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the AASLD \n6  and the IDSA were updated on September 29, 2021 and continue to recommend direct-acting \n7  antiviral treatment. https://www.hcvguidelines.org.  \n8  III.  ONGOING MONITORING \n9  Paragraph  40  of  the  Consent  Decree  (ECF  No.  80)  requires  Defendants  to  provide \n10  information for the following categories: \n11  a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n12  Between April 29, 2022 to July 29, 2022, 1015 inmates were tested for Hepatitis C.  See \n13  attached spreadsheet “#1 HCV Tested” tab for dates of tests. Exhibit A. \n14  b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n15  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n16  Between April 29, 2022 to July 29, 2022, 77 inmates tested positive for Hepatitis C.  See \n17  attached spreadsheet “#2 HCV Positive” tab for dates of positive tests. Exhibit B. \n18  c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication of \n19  which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n20  was initiated) during the reporting period \n21  Between April 29, 2022 to July 29, 2022, 66 inmates started DAA treatment.  See attached \n22  spreadsheet “#3 Treatment Started” tab for dates and treatment names. Exhibit C. \n23  d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n24  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA \n25  Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period \n26  Between April 29, 2022 to July 29, 2022, 39 inmates concluded their course of DAA \n27  treatment in custody.  See attached spreadsheet “#4 Treatment Completed” tab for dates and \n28  treatment names. Exhibit D. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 121   Filed 08/11/22   Page 4 of 7\n \n1  e.  The number of inmates who obtained SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment \n2  during the reporting period \n3  Between April 29, 2022 to July 29, 2022, 60 inmates in custody were confirmed to have \n4  obtained SVR after completion of DAA treatment. Exhibit E.  \n5  f.  The number of inmates who were tested after receiving DAA treatment but did not \n6  obtain SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment during the reporting period \n7  Between April 29, 2022 to July 29, 2022, 0 inmates in custody were confirmed to have NOT \n8  obtained SVR after completion of DAA treatment. Exhibit F.  \n9  g.  The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with \n10  information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period. \n11  Between April 29, 2022 to July 29, 2022, 23 inmates were released, 6 inmates currently still \n12  in custody have release dates less than 84 days.  In addition, 10 inmates cannot be treated at this time \n13  pending further imaging/specialty evaluation as recommended by the infectious disease specialist \n14  from the Hopes clinic 7 inmates of whom were previously reported and are still pending to \n15  completion of further imaging/specialty evaluation and 3 inmates have been added this reporting \n16  period. Additionally, by way of explanation, there are some inmates who had their treatment delayed \n17  last quarter that are still delayed this quarter. These 7 inmates are delayed because they require multi-\n18  appointment diagnostic follow-up with a gastroenterologist. As a result, their treatment is delayed \n19  but NDOC is working diligently on getting them cleared for treatment once the gastroenterologist \n20  clears them for treatment. Finally, 1 inmate was seen by the infectious disease specialist who \n21  documented during the consultation the inmate opted to delay treatment until he is released in Reno \n22  and 1 inmate told Hopes he was paroling soon and they discussed that he will obtain treatment with \n23  the VA upon parole.  See attached spreadsheet “#7 Delayed or Denied” tab for more detail. Exhibit \n24  G. \n25  IV.  HCV COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND MINUTES \n26  Under  Medical  Directive  219,  as  incorporated  into  the  Consent  Decree,  “NDOC  will \n27  maintain an HCV Committee which shall consist of the Medical Director or designee and at least \n28 \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 121   Filed 08/11/22   Page 5 of 7\n \n1  two (2) institutional practitioners. The HCV Committee shall meet at least once per month.” MD \n2  219.02(d) (ECF No. 61-1).  \n3  The HCV Committee has met on May 5, 2022, June 8, 2022 and July 6, 2022. Copies of the \n4  agendas for May 5, 2022, June 8, 2022 and July 6, 2022 are attached. Exhibit H. Minutes from the \n5  May 5, 2022, June 8, 2022 and July 6, 2022 are attached. Exhibit I. Defendants represent that these \n6  minutes reflect approval of all inmates who were considered for treatment.  \n7  V.  UPCOMING DEADLINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER \n8  This coming quarter will mark the second year of monitoring after entry of the Consent \n9  Decree. Thus, it is contemplated that NDOC will provide treatment to “an additional 600 Class \n10  Members within the second (12) month period after the Effective Date…,” which deadline would \n11  fall on October 29, 2022.

INTRODUCTION \n26  Class Counsel have attempted on multiple occasions since June 2, 2021 to communicate \n27  with Defendants’ counsel on the issues raised in Class Counsel’s Response to Status Report (ECF \n28  No. 88) and during the hearing on June 2, 2021 (ECF No. 91), but only received a substantive \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 97   Filed 06/28/21   Page 2 of 4\n \n1  response on the afternoon of June 28, 2021. Accordingly, while it does appear that progress is \n2  being made and that there is broad agreement on many items, Class Counsel have not had sufficient \n3  opportunity to assess the efforts of Defendants.  \n4  II.  TESTING \n5  Based on correspondence with Defendants’ counsel on June 28, 2021, Class Counsel \n6  understands that Defendants have agreed to provide suggested literature from the CDC to inmates \n7  during their initial opportunity to be tested for HCV as well as to those inmates who have already \n8  opted-out from HCV testing. The latter category will also be provided with a second opportunity \n9  to receive HCV testing. Class Counsel would like to review the actual literature that will be \n10  provided to the inmates as well as to review the procedure for the second round of testing.  \n11  Class Counsel is still waiting for a response as to whether Defendants will be able to \n12  provide additional training and education on HCV via group education, closed circuit television, \n13  or other means.  \n14  III.  INCIDENCE OF HCV \n15  On June 2, 2021, Class Counsel wrote to Defendants’ counsel: “One suggestion – the most \n16  efficient way to approach this issue may be to identify the inmates who tested positive for HCV \n17  antibodies but who did not receive confirmation of an HCV infection via further PCR testing. If \n18  this number is around ~400-500 then it may explain most of the discrepancy.” It appears that this \n19  hypothesis has been supported by Defendants’ data, but further confirmation and analysis is \n20  necessary. If the incidence of HCV is lower than anticipated, as it appears to be, than the deadlines \n21  of the Consent Decree should be more readily satisfied by Defendants and the operative provisions \n22  to accelerate treatment should go into effect earlier.  (ECF No. 80, ¶ 38) (requiring Defendants to \n23  “provide DAA treatment to Class Members within NDOC’s custody at a rate that, at a minimum, \n24  exceeds the HCV infection rate of new inmates who test HCV positive, or who are confirmed to \n25  be HCV positive during the intake process.)  \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 97   Filed 06/28/21   Page 3 of 4\n \n1  IV.  TREATMENT \n2  The  deadlines  in  the  Consent  Decree  are  fixed  and  Defendants  continue  to  express \n3  optimism that these deadlines will be satisfied. Given the lower than anticipated incidence of HCV, \n4  it is increasingly likely that Defendants will be able to satisfy these deadlines on a timely basis. \n5  First  though,  Class  Counsel  would  like  to  clarify  the  definition  of  “treatment”  to  avoid \n6  misunderstandings as to what constitutes compliance. The Consent Decree defines “DAA” as \n7  “direct-acting  antiviral  medications”  and  establishes  deadlines  for  the  provision  of  “DAA \n8  treatment” to the class members. (ECF No. 80, ¶ 19, 37, 38). Accordingly, Class Counsel believe \n9  that the deadlines are satisfied only when the class members are actually receiving the “direct-\n10  acting antiviral medications” in that they have received and taken the first dose. Approval for the \n11  medication, scheduling of further lab tests, or other potential bottlenecks should not qualify as \n12  DAA treatment.  \n13  Second, an item of dispute between the sides was the necessity, or lack thereof, of \n14  prioritizing inmates with HCV. While the Consent Decree permits prioritization, any harm of \n15  prioritization was mitigated by the quantitative requirements for the number of inmates who must \n16  receive DAA treatment by certain dates. Given the low incidence of HCV (which means that all \n17  priorities should receive treatment in 2021) and the rapidly approaching deadlines, Class Counsel \n18  believe that any non-essential procedures for prioritization should be suspended in order to \n19  accelerate the provision of DAA treatment. For example, inmates are still being scheduled for \n20  Fibrosure analysis and fibrosis staging even though these tests do not appear to be necessary for \n21  inmates who have already been confirmed to have a viral load. Accordingly, Class Counsel would \n22  like Defendants to suspend any prioritization procedures that are not medically indicated prior to \n23  receiving approval for DAA treatment.  \n24  // \n25  // \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 97   Filed 06/28/21   Page 4 of 4\n \n1  V.  CONCLUSION \n2  Class Counsel will attempt to review information provided by Defendants on June 28, \n3  2021 and provide further analysis and input during the status hearing on June 29, 2021.  \n4   \n5   \n6  Dated June 28, 2021. \n   \n7 \n   McDONALD CARANO LLP  \n \n8 \n     /s/ Adam Hosmer-Henner              \nAdam Hosmer-Henner, Esq.

This Report \n20  does not request relief or other intervention by the Court at this time.  \n21  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n22  I.  INTRODUCTION \n23  The Parties believe the consent decree is being followed as envisioned and that there are \n24  no issues that require the Court’s intervention at this time. That being said, Class Counsel has \n25  expressed concerns over the rate of treatment last year versus this year and the issue is that NDOC \n26  has parted ways with many internal providers who were providing HCV treatment. As a result, \n27  NDOC has had to rely more on external care providers which takes additional time to schedule \n28  and facilitate and therefore the rate of treatment this year is not comparable to last year.  \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 119   Filed 05/13/22   Page 2 of 7\n \n1  NDOC has scheduled more Hepatitis C clinics, but the status of COVID quarantines and \n2  isolation in large part will drive when the clinics are held. Nonetheless, NDOC believes that it is \n3  still on track to meet the second-year treatment goal contemplated by the consent decree.  \n4  The  monitoring  information  provided  by  Defendants  to  Class  Counsel  includes \n5  confidential information that would merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) and \n6  the Consent Decree (ECF No. 80). The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions of \n7  these documents to this Report and believe that this is appropriate under the above documents and \n8  LR IC 6-1. Class Counsel have received unredacted versions of the documents, but do not need to \n9  make these documents part of the court record, requiring filing under seal, unless the Court \n10  disagrees.   \n11  For this reporting period, the Parties can represent that the fundamental aspects of the \n12  Consent Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned given the significant constraints that \n13  COVID imposes on the ability for Hepatitis C clinics to be held. Class Counsel continues to be of \n14  the position that COVID is not an excuse for noncompliance with the Consent Decree. There are \n15  no issues that the Parties believe require the Court’s intervention at this time.  \n16  II.  REVISED DOCUMENTS \n17  Paragraph 29 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants “to adopt and follow the revised \n18  version of MD 219 . . . and the revised version of the HCV Consent Agreement.” (ECF No. 80). \n19  Defendants have adopted these documents (Medical Directive 219 and Medical Division Form \n20  DOC 2730) as of October 29, 2020 and these documents, along with the Consent Decree were \n21  provided “to all officers, employees, physicians, and agents whose duties might reasonably include \n22  compliance with any provision of this Consent Decree.” Consent Decree, ¶ 28 (ECF No. 80).  \n23  III.  TESTING AND TREATMENT \n24  Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the custody \n25  of NDOC for HCV by December 31, 2020.” (ECF No. 80). This has been accomplished by \n26  Defendants, except for some inmates who are currently in the intake process and others who have \n27  recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories are in line to \n28  be tested and will be tested on an ongoing basis.  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 119   Filed 05/13/22   Page 3 of 7\n \n1  Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all Class \n2  Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). This has been \n3  accomplished by Defendants, again except for inmates who are currently in the intake process or \n4  who have recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Defendants are no longer \n5  prioritizing or sequencing inmates for HCV treatment, which is a positive change that Class \n6  Counsel agrees with.  \n7  Class Counsel has also expressed concerns that as class members move in and out of \n8  custody they may not be provided with treatment in all circumstances when the timing would be \n9  feasible. Class Counsel has examined the data and identified 11 inmates who were not treated \n10  because they were scheduled to release prior to October 2021 prior to receiving a full course of \n11  treatment, but then who had returned to NDOC custody by April 2021. This is permissible under \n12  the Consent Decree, but Class Counsel continue to monitor for situations like this where delays in \n13  treatment could result in no treatment for potentially eligible class members. \n14  The Parties have investigated but not identified any changes to the medical standard of care \n15  for HCV that would warrant alterations of the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the \n16  AASLD and the IDSA were updated on September 29, 2021 and continue to recommend direct-\n17  acting antiviral treatment. https://www.hcvguidelines.org.  \n18  IV.  ONGOING MONITORING \n19  Paragraph  40  of  the  Consent  Decree  (ECF  No.  80)  requires  Defendants  to  provide \n20  information for the following categories: \n21  a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n22  Between January 28, 2022 to April 28, 2022, 1,041 inmates were tested for Hepatitis C.  \n23  See attached spreadsheet “#1 HCV Tested” tab for dates of tests. Exhibit A.  \n24  b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n25  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n26  Between January 28, 2022 to April 28, 2022, 94 inmates tested positive for Hepatitis C.  \n27  See attached spreadsheet “#2 HCV Positive” tab for dates of positive tests. Exhibit B.  \n28 \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 119   Filed 05/13/22   Page 4 of 7\n \n1  c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication of \n2  which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n3  was initiated) during the reporting period \n4  Between January 28, 2022 to April 28, 2022, 42 inmates started DAA treatment.  See \n5  attached spreadsheet “#3 Treatment Started” tab for dates and treatment names.  Exhibit C. \n6  d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n7  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA \n8  Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period \n9  Between January 28, 2022 to April 28, 2022, 73 inmates concluded their course of DAA \n10  treatment in custody.  See attached spreadsheet “#4 Treatment Completed” tab for dates and \n11  treatment names. Exhibit D. \n12  e.  The number of inmates who obtained SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment \n13  during the reporting period \n14  Between January 28, 2022 to April 28, 2022, 246 inmates were confirmed in custody to \n15  have obtained SVR after completion of DAA treatment. Exhibit E.  \n16  f.  The number of inmates who were tested after receiving DAA treatment but did not \n17  obtain SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment during the reporting period \n18  Between January 28, 2022 to April 28, 2022, 4 inmates were confirmed in custody to have \n19  NOT obtained SVR after completion of DAA treatment. Exhibit E.  \n20  g.  The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with \n21  information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period. \n22  Between January 28, 2022 to April 28, 2022, 19 inmates were released, 10 inmates \n23  currently still in custody have release dates less than 84 days and 8 inmates cannot be treated at \n24  this time pending further imaging/specialty evaluation as recommended by the infectious disease \n25  specialist from the Hopes clinic.  See attached spreadsheet “#7 Delayed or Denied” tab for more \n26  detail. Exhibit F.  \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 119   Filed 05/13/22   Page 5 of 7\n \n1  V.  HCV COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND MINUTES \n2  Under Medical Directive 219, as incorporated into the Consent Decree, “NDOC will \n3  maintain an HCV Committee which shall consist of the Medical Director or designee and at least \n4  two (2) institutional practitioners. The HCV Committee shall meet at least once per month.” MD \n5  219.02(d) (ECF No. 61-1).  \n6  The HCV Committee has met on February 2, 2022, March 2, 2022 and April 6, 2022. \n7  Copies of the agendas for February 2, 2022, March 2, 2022 and April 6, 2022 are attached. Exhibit \n8  G. Minutes from the February 2, 2022, March 2, 2022 and April 6, 2022 are attached. Exhibit H. \n9  Defendants represent that these minutes reflect approval of all inmates who were considered for \n10  treatment.  \n11  VI.  UPCOMING DEADLINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER \n12  There are no deadlines contemplated during the upcoming quarter. Indeed, because the first \n13  calendar year has passed, the deadlines are based upon a yearly treatment goal instead of a \n14  quarterly triage type goal. As a result, Defendants respectfully request to do away with the \n15  reporting requirement of quarterly deadlines. Class Counsel wish to maintain quarterly reports \n16  because NDOC is not expected to satisfy the quantitative requirements in the Consent Decree, so \n17  unless changes are made to the Consent Decree then there needs to be more oversight rather than \n18  less in order to ensure that treatment is timely provided.  \n19  Dated May 13, 2022. \n \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 119   Filed 05/13/22   Page 6 of 7\n \n   \n1  McDONALD CARANO LLP   AARON D.

INTRODUCTION \n3  The Parties believe the consent decree is being followed as envisioned and that there are no issues \n4  that require the Court’s intervention at this time. NDOC believes that it is on track to meet the \n5  second-year treatment goal contemplated by the consent decree. ECF No. 80 ¶ 37. \n6  The  monitoring  information  provided  by  Defendants  to  Class  Counsel  includes  confidential \n7  information that would merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) and the Consent \n8  Decree (ECF No. 80). The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions of these documents \n9  to this Report and believe that this is appropriate under the above documents and LR IC 6-1. Class \n10  Counsel have received unredacted versions of the documents, but do not need to make these \n11  documents part of the court record, requiring filing under seal, unless the Court disagrees.   \n12  For this reporting period, the Parties can represent that the fundamental aspects of the Consent \n13  Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned given the significant constraints that COVID \n14  imposes on the ability for Hepatitis C clinics to be held. There are no issues that the Parties believe \n15  require the Court’s intervention at this time.  \n16  Class Counsel would like to raise an issue for the Court that will then be addressed next quarter. \n17  Class Counsel is concerned that NDOC will continue to delay treatment until the end of the year \n18  and will not provide treatment on a timely basis. For example, while 96 inmates tested positive this \n19  quarter, only 3 inmates began treatment. This may be a function of NDOC’s push to treat sufficient \n20  numbers by October 2021, but unless ~96 inmates begin treatment in the next quarter, Class \n21  Counsel will request a modification of the Consent Decree to prevent this conduct by NDOC. The \n22  Parties have agreed to meet and confer on this issue.  \n23  II.  REVISED DOCUMENTS \n24  Paragraph 29 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants “to adopt and follow the revised version \n25  of MD 219 . . . and the revised version of the HCV Consent Agreement.” (ECF No. 80). Defendants \n26  have adopted these documents (Medical Directive 219 and Medical Division Form DOC 2730) as \n27  of October 29, 2020 and these documents, along with the Consent Decree were provided “to all \n28 \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 117   Filed 02/11/22   Page 3 of 8\n \n1  officers, employees, physicians, and agents whose duties might reasonably include compliance with \n2  any provision of this Consent Decree.” Consent Decree, ¶ 28 (ECF No. 80).  \n3  III.  TESTING AND TREATMENT \n4  Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the custody of \n5  NDOC  for  HCV  by  December  31,  2020.”  (ECF  No.  80).  This  has  been  accomplished  by \n6  Defendants, except for some inmates who are currently in the intake process and others who have \n7  recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories are in line to be \n8  tested and will be tested on an ongoing basis.  \n9  Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all Class \n10  Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). This has been \n11  accomplished by Defendants, again except for inmates who are currently in the intake process or \n12  who have recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories will \n13  be prioritized on an ongoing basis. \n14  IV.  Class Counsel’s position on the standard of care is the same as Defendants, and Class Counsel \n15  has not identified any changes to the medical standard of care for HCV that would warrant alterations of \n16  the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the AASLD and the IDSA were last updated on September \n17  29, 2021, and continue to recommend direct-acting antiviral treatment. https://www.hcvguidelines.org. \n18  Based on these latest updates, which primarily include a switch for elbasvir/grazoprevir (not currently used \n19  by Defendants) from a recommended regiment to an alternative regimen for certain genotypes, no \n20  additional changes are necessary to MD 219.ONGOING MONITORING \n21  Paragraph 40 of the Consent Decree (ECF No. 80) requires Defendants to provide information for \n22  the following categories: \n23  a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n24     Between November 1, 2021 to January 27, 2022, 1220 inmates were tested for HCV. This \n25  is a combination of intakes and inmates who previously refused and recently consented to be tested. \n26  The attached spreadsheet contains more details. Exhibit A. \n27  b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n28  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 117   Filed 02/11/22   Page 4 of 8\n \n1     Between November 1, 2021 to January 27, 2022 96 inmates tested positive for HCV. The \n2  attached  spreadsheet  includes  information  on  the  date  of  each  positive  test.  The  attached \n3  spreadsheet contains more details Exhibit B.  \n4  c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication \n5  of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment was \n6  initiated) during the reporting period \n7     From November 1, 2021, to January 27, 2022, 3 inmates started taking medications. There \n8  have been multiple clinics that needed to be rescheduled to a later date due to an increased number \n9  of COVID cases in the prison population which has caused multiple lockdowns in multiple facilities \n10  and units. However, Hepatitis C clinics have restarted as of January 21, 2022 and we are currently \n11  waiting for the specialist to send NDOC notes and orders to begin more treatments. The attached \n12  spreadsheet contains more details.  Exhibit C. \n13  d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n14  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n15  was concluded) during the reporting period \n16     From November 1, 2021 to January 27, 2022, 287 inmates concluded their course of DAA \n17  treatment while in NDOC custody. In addition, 30 inmates would have concluded DAA treatment \n18  between those dates, but they were released and/or paroled mid-treatment. As a result, NDOC \n19  cannot confirm that those inmates completed their treatment. The attached spreadsheet contains \n20  more details. Exhibit D. \n21  e.  The number of inmates who obtained SVR (cure) after completion of DAA \n22  treatment during the reporting period \n23     From November 1, 2021 to January 27, 2022, 59 inmates have obtained SVR after \n24  completion of DAA treatment.

That inmate was scheduled to see an infectious disease specialist on January 26, \n3  2022. The attached spreadsheet contains more details, Exhibit E.  \n4  g.  The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with \n5  information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period. \n6     From November 1, 2021 to January 27, 2022, 19 inmates were not treated due for the \n7  following: \n- 9 inmates were released; \n8 \n- 6 refused treatment; \n9  - 3 are within 90 days of release; \n- 1 was seen by an infectious disease specialist with Hopes Clinic and the specialist does not \n10  recommend treatment at this time. \n11     The attached spreadsheet contains more details, Exhibit F. \n12  V.  HCV COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND MINUTES \n13     Under Medical Directive 219, as incorporated into the Consent Decree, “NDOC will \n14  maintain an HCV Committee which shall consist of the Medical Director or designee and at least \n15  two (2) institutional practitioners. The HCV Committee shall meet at least once per month.” MD \n16  219.02(d) (ECF No. 61-1).  \n17  The HCV Committee has met on November 3, 2021, December 1, 2021 and January 12, 2022. \n18  Copies of the agendas for November 3, 2021, December 1, 2021 and January 12, 2022 are attached. \n19  Exhibit G.

UPCOMING DEADLINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER \n2  There are no deadlines contemplated during the upcoming quarter.

This Report does not \n21  request relief or other intervention by the Court as it is the position of the Defendants that the \n22  terms of the Consent Judgment have been properly carried out to date. Class Counsel will issue a \n23  separate response shortly. \n24  /// \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 86   Filed 04/29/21   Page 2 of 8\n \n1  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n2  I.  INTRODUCTION \n3  The Defendants are pleased to report that the terms of the Consent Decree are being \n4  satisfactorily implemented and that there are no issues requiring the Court’s intervention at this \n5  time. The Parties have been in communication regarding the implementation of the Consent \n6  Decree and, while this quarter continues to have some difficulties, due to the ongoing COVID \n7  pandemic and its effect on medical appointments, it is not believed that there are any issues that \n8  the Parties have not been able to address and resolve via joint resolution. The Class Counsel has \n9  some questions relating to various issues, and the Defendants, through Counsel, are gathering the \n10  information needed. The Defendants are largely on schedule with respect to the testing and \n11  treatment of inmates for Hepatitis C (“HCV”).  \n12  The  monitoring  information  provided  by  Defendants  to  Class  Counsel  includes \n13  confidential information that would merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) \n14  and the Consent Decree (ECF No. 80). The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions \n15  of these documents to this Report and believe that this is appropriate under the above documents \n16  and LR IC 6-1. Class Counsel have received unredacted versions of the documents, but the \n17  positions of the Parties is that these documents should not be made a part of the official court \n18  record because it would require filing under seal.  \n19  For the second reporting period, the Defendants represent that the fundamental aspects of \n20  the Consent Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned. In the future, the Parties expect \n21  to be able to provide the Court with further information about the trends in treatment and \n22  practices that can only be gleaned once sufficient data is obtained.  \n23  II.  REVISED DOCUMENTS \n24  Paragraph 29 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants “to adopt and follow the revised \n25  version of MD 219 . . . and the revised version of the HCV Consent Agreement.” (ECF No. 80). \n26  Defendants have adopted these documents (Medical Directive 219 and Medical Division Form \n27  DOC 2730) as of October 29, 2020. These documents, along with the Consent Decree, were \n28  provided “to all officers, employees, physicians, and agents whose duties might reasonably \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 86   Filed 04/29/21   Page 3 of 8\n \n1  include compliance with any provision of this Consent Decree.” Consent Decree, ¶ 28 (ECF No. \n2  80).  \n3  III.  TESTING AND TREATMENT \n4  Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the \n5  custody of NDOC for HCV by December 31, 2020.” (ECF No. 80). All inmates that were in \n6  NDOC’s physical custody as of December 31, 2020 have been tested. Inmates that are new to \n7  NDOC or inmates that have returned from out of state placements are still in the process of being \n8  tested and are being tested on an ongoing basis.  \n9  Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all \n10  Class Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). All inmates \n11  with known test results have been prioritized. Inmates that still need be tested, as set forth above, \n12  will be prioritized as the results become known.  \n13  The Parties have not identified any changes to the medical standard of care for HCV that \n14  would warrant alterations of the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the AASLD and the \n15  IDSA were updated on August 27, 2020 and continue to recommend direct-acting antiviral \n16  treatment. https://www.hcvguidelines.org.  \n17  IV.  ONGOING MONITORING \n18  Paragraph  40  of  the  Consent  Decree  (ECF  No.  80)  requires  Defendants  to  provide \n19  information for the following categories: \n20  a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n21  Between January 29, 2021 to April 13, 2021, 806 inmates were tested for HCV. This total \n22  includes both non-intake and intake testing. The intake process takes anywhere between two-to-\n23  four weeks to complete, but while these inmates are in the intake process they are being tested \n24  for HCV.  \n25  b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n26  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n27  Between January 29, 2021 to April 13, 2021 76 inmates tested positive for HCV. The \n28  attached spreadsheet includes information on the date of each positive test. Exhibit A.  \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 86   Filed 04/29/21   Page 4 of 8\n \n1  c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication of \n2  which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n3  was initiated) during the reporting period \n4  Since January 29, 2021, 83 inmates have begun DAA treatment on Epclusa and 2 inmates \n5  began treatment on Mayyret. In addition, 47 inmates have orders to begin medications, with 38 \n6  out of 47 with medications on the way to their respective institutions. The remaining 9 out of 47 \n7  inmates have medications on their way to Casa Grande Pharmacy to be distributed to their \n8  respective institutions.  \n9  d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n10  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which \n11  DAA Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period \n12  Since January 29, 2021, 21 inmates on Epclusa have completed their DAA treatment. In \n13  addition, 6 additional inmates on Epclusa are due to complete treatment by April 29, 2021. The \n14  attached spreadsheet shows dates of the DAA treatment concluded. Exhibit B.  \n15  e.  The  number  of  inmates  who  obtained  SVR  (cure)  after  completion  of  DAA \n16  treatment during the reporting period \n17  Between  January  29,  2021  and  April  22,  2021,  0  inmates  have  obtained  SVR.  Per \n18  Infectious Disease Society of America (https://www.hcvguidelines.org/), SVR is measured 12 \n19  weeks post treatment. 5 inmates will be due to be drawn between April 24, 2021 to April 28, \n20  2021, but the results of those draws are not yet available as of the date of this report. \n21  f.  The number of inmates who were tested after receiving DAA treatment but did not \n22  obtain SVR (cure) after completion of DAA treatment during the reporting period \n23  Between January 29, 2021 to April 22, 2021, 0 inmates have been identified to have \n24  obtained  SVR.  Per  Infectious  Disease  Society  of  America  (https://www.hcvguidelines.org/), \n25  SVR is measured 12 weeks post treatment. 5 inmates will be due to be drawn between April 24, \n26  2021 to April 28, 2021, but the results of those draws are not yet available as of the date of this \n27  report. \n28 \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 86   Filed 04/29/21   Page 5 of 8\n \n1  g.  The number of inmates for whom DAA Treatment was denied or delayed (with \n2  information and explanations for each denial/delay) during the reporting period. \n3  As of April 22, 2021, no inmates have been denied treatment, however, 15 inmates seen \n4  by Hopes clinic require further work ups and 1 inmate has had additional labs and ultrasound \n5  sent to Hopes clinic pending review and recommendations;  \n6  Of the 15 inmates who require further work up: \n-  1 inmate needs to wean off Dilantin with the institutional provider due to \n7 \ncontraindications with HCV treatment,  \n8  -  2 inmates who were referred to a gastroenterologist for suspected liver cancer \n(both already scheduled),  \n9  -  2 inmates who were referred to have a CT/MRI of the liver (both already \nscheduled),  \n10 \n-  10 inmates, seen by Hopes clinic, required additional serologic testing and follow \n11  up with Hopes clinic to discuss results prior to initiating treatment. \n12  V.  HCV COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND MINUTES \n13  Under Medical Directive 219, as incorporated into the Consent Decree, “NDOC will \n14  maintain an HCV Committee which shall consist of the Medical Director or designee and at least \n15  two (2) institutional practitioners. The HCV Committee shall meet at least once per month.” MD \n16  219.02(d) (ECF No. 61-1).  \n17  The HCV Committee has met on February 3, 2021, March 3, 2021 and April 7, 2021. \n18  Copies of the agendas for February 3, 2021, March 3, 2021 and April 7, 2021 are attached. \n19  Exhibit C. Minutes from the February 3, 2021, March 3, 2021 and April 7, 2021 are attached. \n20  Exhibit D. These minutes reflect approval of all inmates who were considered for treatment.  \n21  /// \n22  /// \n23  /// \n24  /// \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 86   Filed 04/29/21   Page 6 of 8\n \n1  VI.  UPCOMING DEADLINES FOR THE NEXT QUARTER \n2  Paragraph 36 of the Consent Decree provides that by April 29, 2021, Defendants “will \n3  provide DAA Treatment to all inmates who are prioritized as Priority One, as that term is further \n4  defined and described in MD 219, so long as there is no medical contraindication as set forth in \n5  MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). Based on current information, there are 168 inmates who have been \n6  prioritized as Priority One and Defendants are on track for providing DAA Treatment to all of \n7  these 168 inmates by April 29, 2021. However, as further testing is completed and more inmates \n8  are identified as priority one, they will need to be treated. These later identified inmates that are \n9  subsequently  categorized  as  priority  one  cannot  be  treated  by  the  April  29,  2021  deadline \n10  because there will not be enough time between their identification and the start of treatment. \n11  Therefore, the Defendants will seek to provide DAA Treatment to all Priority One inmates \n12  within six months of their identification and prioritization.  \n13  Additionally,  the  Defendants  have  also  begun  treating  Priority  Two  inmates  in \n14  anticipation of meeting the one-year treatment deadline for the treatment of all HCV positive \n15  inmates that have not refused treatment.  \n16  Dated April 29, 2021. \n \n17 \n   \nAARON D.

(ECF No. 111) \n21  1.  Updated Educational Information. \n22    The updated medical information was provided to the institutions by Medical Director \n23  Michael Minev on June 25, 2021.  The institutions were instructed to provide this information to \n24  all new intake, and to make it available to all inmates, particularly those who had previously \n25  opted out of testing and treatment. \n26  2.  Updated Refusal Information. \n27  As the Plaintiffs set forth in the Response, supra, “Of the approximately 927 inmates who \n28  have refused testing though, there are approximately 11 who signed two refusals prior to March \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 113   Filed 11/29/21   Page 2 of 5\n \n1  24, 2021 during which time the educational information about HCV was inadequate. Thus, these \n2  11 individuals should be provided with the revised educational information and be provided with \n3  a meaningful opportunity to accept testing for HCV. There are a further 202 inmates who signed \n4  two refusals and the latter of the refusals was signed on or after June 28, 2021. An additional 52 \n5  inmates only signed one refusal, but which was after June 28, 2021. If Defendants can confirm \n6  that this date was after the provision of revised educational information, then no further action \n7  appears to be warranted for these individuals.”  The date was June 25, 2021.  Therefore, these \n8  inmates have, presumably given their informed consent to refuse.  Many of the remaining inmates \n9  have been given the information, and refused, but the refusal was not documented. Counsel has \n10  instructed the NDOC to ensure that all inmates had a first, second or third opportunity to receive \n11  testing. This information and verification will be provided in the next quarterly report. \n12  3.  The Inmates Who Refused Testing, or Treatment Continue to be Offered Testing or \nTreatment. \n13 \n14    The inmates will be offered treatment or testing. As set forth above, the NDOC will \n15  document an acceptance of treatment, or a continued, informed refusal on the inmates who \n16  qualify, medically, for treatment. \n17  4.  Additional Responses to Requests by Plaintiff’s Counsel. \n18    There was some confusion expressed by Counsel regarding the refusal reports.  Plaintiff \n19  noted that there are one or two refusals logged, and others have a date, but a blank refusal date. \n20   On sheet 2, there are several blank refusal dates, but there is a date logged.  According to the \n21  NDOC coordinator, this means NDOC has a refusal form, but the coordinator didn't have the time \n22  to manual type out the actual date of refusal because there were a lot of refusals in one file.  So in \n23  order for him to pull a specific refusal he documented the date he logged the refusal and put that \n24  date on the title of the file itself.  So for example: \n25  Sheet 2 ROW 20 – [Inmate redacted] it has a blank refusal date but a logged date of 2/3/21.  He \n26  would then look in the WSCC refusal folder for a file received from WSCC on 2/3/21.  There are \n27  89 pages in that file.  He would review that file and find [Inmate’s] refusal from 3/13/20. \n28  /// \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 113   Filed 11/29/21   Page 3 of 5\n \n1  Sheet 2 ROW 24 – [Inmate redacted], also a blank refusal date but logged date of 2/3/21.  Again \n2  he would look in the same file from WSCC logged on 2/3/21 and find [Inmate’s] refusal from \n3  2/18/20. \n4    For the next quarterly report, NDOC will endeavor to update this information, also. \n5  5.  Inmates Released Prior to Treatment, or Prior to Completing Treatment. \n6    Plaintiff’s  counsel  expressed  concerns  about  inmates  released  prior  to  beginning \n7  treatment.  It would not be appropriate to delay release of a prisoner to treat them for HCV.  It is \n8  unlikely that an inmate would agree to stay in prison longer, to receive medical treatment. \n9    As to the 28 inmates with HCV, who were released before treatment could be completed, \n10  parole dates are notoriously fluid.  NDOC takes parole expectation date as the date in which \n11  NDOC calculates that the inmate does not have enough time left (84 days) to complete treatment.  \n12  However, parole dates are not readily available and come up unexpectedly.  There were cases, \n13  where inmates were suddenly granted parole, or a parole plan is approved and inmate is paroled \n14  mid treatment.  Even for some inmates NDOC knew that parole was granted, medical had advised \n15  the staff at the institution to discuss it with the inmate first if they want to refuse and seek \n16  treatment outside where they can be treated without interruption or medical would treat if they \n17  consented to taking that risk.  This was done because even though parole was granted, we have \n18  experienced inmates who were granted parole but could not get their parole plan approved and \n19  ended up staying.  NDOC did not want to be caught not treating an inmate because parole was \n20  granted, the inmate ended up having their parole plan rejected, not leaving and now they are \n21  untreated and still in custody without treatment.  Therefore, there were a few instances where \n22  inmates were released mid treatment.  Again, very few inmates would want to remain to complete \n23  their treatment.  However, they were counseled to seek treatment on the outside, to complete the \n24  treatment. \n25  /// \n26  /// \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 113   Filed 11/29/21   Page 4 of 5\n \n1  6.  New Inmates Who Test Positive. \n2    It is the intention of the NDOC to treat new inmates who test positive or inmates who test \n3  positive while in the custody of NDOC in an expeditious manner.  The NDOC recognizes that this \n4  is a continuing obligation, and intend to operate in good faith to do so. \n5  Dated November 29, 2021. \n \n6  AARON D.

This Report \n22 \ndoes not request relief or other intervention by the Court as the terms of the Consent Judgment \n23 \nhave been properly carried out to date.  \n24 \n// \n25 \n// \n26 \n// \n27 \n// \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 84   Filed 01/29/21   Page 2 of 7\n \n1  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n2  I.  INTRODUCTION \n3  The  Parties  are  pleased  to  report  that  the  terms  of  the  Consent  Decree  are  being \n4  satisfactorily implemented and that there are no issues requiring this Court’s intervention at this \n5  point in time. The Parties have been in frequent communication regarding the implementation of \n6  the Consent Decree and, while this first quarter has been an adjustment period, there have not been \n7  any issues that the Parties have not been able to address and resolve. In fact, the Defendants are \n8  largely ahead of schedule with respect to the testing and treatment of inmates for Hepatitis C \n9  (“HCV”).  \n10  As this is the first Report, the Parties hope that the format and content are acceptable to the \n11  Court and are of course willing to discuss any feedback, issues, or questions the Court may have \n12  in the event that the Court would like to schedule a status conference. There is one specific item \n13  that the parties would like to identify for the Court related to confidentiality. The monitoring \n14  information provided by Defendants to Class Counsel includes confidential information that would \n15  merit protection under the Protective Order (ECF No. 43) and the Consent Decree (ECF No. 80). \n16  The Parties have prepared and attached redacted versions of these documents to this Report and \n17  believe that this is appropriate under the above documents and LR IC 6-1. Class Counsel have \n18  received unredacted versions of the documents, but do not need to make these documents part of \n19  the court record, requiring filing under seal, unless the Court disagrees.   \n20  For this initial reporting period, the Parties can represent that the fundamental aspects of \n21  the Consent Decree are in place and are operating as envisioned. For the next reporting period and \n22  the subsequent periods, the Parties expect to be able to provide the Court with further information \n23  about the trends in treatment and practices.  \n24  II.  REVISED DOCUMENTS \n25  Paragraph 29 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants “to adopt and follow the revised \n26  version of MD 219 . . . and the revised version of the HCV Consent Agreement.” (ECF No. 80). \n27  Defendants have adopted these documents (Medical Directive 219 and Medical Division Form \n28  DOC 2730) as of October 29, 2020 and these documents, along with the Consent Decree were \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 84   Filed 01/29/21   Page 3 of 7\n \n1  provided “to all officers, employees, physicians, and agents whose duties might reasonably include \n2  compliance with any provision of this Consent Decree.” Consent Decree, ¶ 28 (ECF No. 80).  \n3  III.  TESTING AND TREATMENT \n4  Paragraph 32 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “test all inmates in the custody \n5  of NDOC for HCV by December 31, 2020.” (ECF No. 80). This has been accomplished by \n6  Defendants, except for some inmates who are currently in the intake process and others who have \n7  recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories are in line to \n8  be tested and will be tested on an ongoing basis.  \n9  Paragraph 34 of the Consent Decree requires Defendants to “screen and prioritize all Class \n10  Members using the criteria in the revised version of MD 219.” (ECF No. 80). This has been \n11  accomplished by Defendants, again except for inmates who are currently in the intake process or \n12  who have recently returned to Nevada from out-of-state facilities. Inmates in these categories will \n13  be prioritized on an ongoing basis. \n14  The Parties have investigated but not identified any changes to the medical standard of care \n15  for HCV that would warrant alterations of the Consent Decree. The HCV Guidelines of the \n16  AASLD and the IDSA were updated on August 27, 2020 and continue to recommend direct-acting \n17  antiviral treatment. https://www.hcvguidelines.org.  \n18  IV.  ONGOING MONITORING \n19  Paragraph  40  of  the  Consent  Decree  (ECF  No.  80)  requires  Defendants  to  provide \n20  information for the following categories: \n21  a.  The number of inmates tested/screened during the reporting period \n22  Between October 29, 2020 to January 28, 2021, 803 inmates were tested for HCV. This \n23  total includes both non-intake and intake testing. There are approximately 147 inmates who are \n24  currently in the intake process who have not yet been tested. The intake process takes anywhere \n25  between two-to-four weeks, but these inmates in the intake process are in the process of being \n26  tested for HCV. In addition to the 147 inmates in or just completing the intake process, NDOC \n27  must test 87 inmates that were transferred back to NDOC custody from Arizona during this time \n28  period. Specifically, those inmates were returned to NDOC custody, and placed in custody at High \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00577-MMD-CLB   Document 84   Filed 01/29/21   Page 4 of 7\n \n1  Desert State Prison (HDSP) throughout the month of November 2020, with transfer completed by \n2  approximately November 30, 2020. NDOC is committed to testing these inmates as soon as \n3  possible, however, due to COVID-19 protocols and other safety and security protocols associated \n4  with the return of these inmates to NDOC custody, they have not yet been tested. However, as \n5  with the other 147 inmates, these inmates are also in the process of being tested. This total does \n6  not include the number of inmates who refused testing and opted-out and the Parties are working \n7  to identify the opt-out statistics and related data.  \n8  b.  The number of inmates who tested positive for HCV during the reporting period \n9  (including the date on which each inmate tested positive for HCV) \n10  Between October 29, 2020 to January 28, 2021, 120 inmates tested positive for HCV. The \n11  attached spreadsheet includes information on the date of each positive test. Exhibit 1.  \n12  c.  The number of inmates who began receiving DAA Treatment (with an indication of \n13  which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA Treatment \n14  was initiated) during the reporting period \n15  Between October 29, 2020 to January 28, 2021, 15 inmates have begun medication. Exhibit \n16  1. During the same time period, 83 inmates have been seen by a provider and 7 further inmates \n17  were scheduled to be seen on January 29, 2021.   \n18  d.  The number of inmates who concluded their course of DAA Treatment (with an \n19  indication of which type of DAA Treatment was provided and the date on which DAA \n20  Treatment was concluded) during the reporting period \n21  Between  October  29,  2020  to  January  28,  2021,  no  inmates  have  concluded  DAA \n22  treatment. The first course of treatment for an inmate who began treatment during the reporting \n23  period is expected to conclude in February 2021. The subsequent Joint Quarterly Report is \n24  obviously anticipated to have more information in this category. \n25  e.
