The case was assigned to District Judge Nancy E. Brasel. The plaintiffs alleged that Section 1005's categorization of socially disadvantaged groups prevented them from receiving a government benefit because of their race and thus was a racial classification that violated their Equal Protection rights. Represented by attorneys from the Upper Midwest Center, they asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees.</p>\r\n<p>On August 24, 2021, at the request of the parties, Judge Brasel stayed this case pending the resolution of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/18120/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miller v. Vilsack</a></em>, another challenge to the same program being litigated in the Northern District of Texas. The parties were instructed to submit a joint status report within 90 days to determine whether the stay should remain in place. Both parties agreed that the stay should continue, and on November 23, 2021, the judge ordered that the stay would remain in effect. This process repeated three more times in 2022.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs filed a stipulation of dismissal without prejudice on September 13, 2022, after Section 1005 had been repealed. On September 19, 2022, Judge Brasel dismissed the case without prejudice. This case is now closed.</p>",

JURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n \nThomas J. Vilsack, in his official capacity \nas Secretary of Agriculture; and Zach \nDucheneaux, in his official capacity as \nAdministrator of the Farm Service Agency,  \n \n                   Defendants. \n \n \nFor their complaint against Defendants, Plaintiffs allege as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  A government “that wishes to employ a racial preference cannot rest on \nbroad-brush assumptions of historical discrimination.” City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson \nCo.,  488  U.S.  469,  485  (1989).  Even  “asserted  interests  in  remedying  societal \ndiscrimination . . . could not justify governmentally imposed racial discrimination.” Fisher \nv. University of Texas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 318 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring). If it \nwere otherwise, as the Fourth Circuit in J.A. Croson worried, “governments will be free to \nadopt  sweeping  racial  preferences  at  their  pleasure,  whether  those  preferences  are \nlegitimate remedial measures or bald dispensations of public funds and employment based \non the politics of race.” J.A. Croson Co. v. City of Richmond, 822 F.2d 1355, 1358 (4th \n  1 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 2 of 15\nCir. 1987), aff'd, 488 U.S. 469 (1989). \n2.  Resting on broad-brush assumptions of historical discrimination is exactly \nwhat  the  United  States  has  done  here.  Despite  strong  precedent  against  race-based \nclassifications, in March 2021, the United States retreated from the principle of equality \nunder the law by enacting a race-based loan-forgiveness program in the American Rescue \nPlan Act of 2021 (ARPA). Among other things, under its Section 1005, ARPA provides \nbillions of dollars of debt relief to “socially disadvantaged” farmers and ranchers. The \nphrase “socially disadvantaged” includes explicit racial classifications: to be eligible for \nARPA’s debt relief, farmers and ranchers must be Black or African American, American \nIndian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, or Asian American or Pacific Islander. Other \nfarmers—white farmers, for example—are ineligible.  \n3.  In enacting Section 1005 of the ARPA, Secretary Vilsack himself admitted \nthat Section 1005 relies on broad, non-specific allegations of “systemic racism” which has \nallegedly “plague[d] the programs at the USDA, especially the Farm Loan Program.” \nAccording to Secretary Vilsack, ARPA “provides funding to address longstanding racial \nequity issues within the Department and across agriculture.” These broad-brush allegations \ndo not support a blanket forgiveness of debt based purely on race. \n4.  Plaintiffs are farmers from Minnesota who have direct loans with the Farm \nService Agency. They are otherwise eligible for the loan-forgiveness program in ARPA, \nexcept for the color of their skin. As white farmers, Plaintiffs are ineligible for this \ngovernment benefit.  \n5.  Defendants  are  responsible  for  running  this  race-based  loan-forgiveness \n  2 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 3 of 15\nprogram through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service \nAgency (FSA). Defendants assert that the purpose of this program is to remedy “systemic \nracism” within USDA and more broadly “across agriculture.”  \n6.  The  United  States  Constitution  “forbids”  discrimination  by  the  federal \ngovernment “against any citizen because of his race.” Adarand Constructors, Inc., 515 U.S. \nat 216 (citations omitted). Any classifications based on race, therefore, must “be subjected \nto the most rigid scrutiny.” Id (citation omitted). So, when the government distributes \n“benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications,” as Defendants do in this case, \nthe  government  bears  the  burden  of  meeting  “strict  scrutiny.”  In  other  words,  the \ngovernment must prove that its discriminatory benefit is narrowly tailored and serves a \ncompelling government interest. Id. at 227.  \n7.  While Defendants’ public statements about ARPA describe their generalized \ngoal of ending “systemic racism,” such broad goals do not override the constitutional ban \non race discrimination. In fact, the Supreme Court has “rejected the interest in remedying \nsocietal discrimination because it had no logical stopping point.” Fisher, 570 U.S. at 318 \n(Thomas, J., concurring).  \n8.  In short, “[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop \ndiscriminating on the basis of race.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. \nNo. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 748 (2007). Defendants’ use of race discrimination as a tool to end \n“systemic racism,” is therefore unconstitutional and should be enjoined by this Court. \n \n \n  3 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 4 of 15\nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff Steve Nuest is an owner of Plaintiff Nuest Farms, Inc., d/b/a Nuest \nPartnership (“Nuest Partnership”). Mr. Nuest resides in Stevens County, Minnesota, where \nNuest  Partnership  is  also  located.  They  have  FSA  Direct  Loans  with  indebtedness \noutstanding. Mr. Nuest and Nuest Partnership would be eligible for the loan forgiveness \nprogram in Section 1005 of ARPA, except Mr. Nuest is white. \n10.  Plaintiff Kaylyn Dalsted owns Arrow D Ranch and lives in Pembina County, \nNorth Dakota. Ms. Dalsted has FSA Direct Loans with indebtedness outstanding. Ms. \nDalsted would be eligible for the loan forgiveness program in Section 1005 of ARPA, \nexcept she is white. \n11.  Plaintiff Chad Walter is part owner and manager of Plaintiff Walter Brothers \nFamily Farms LLC (“Walter Brothers”). Mr. Walter resides in Brown County, Minnesota, \nwhere Walter Brothers is also located. They have FSA Direct Loans with indebtedness \noutstanding. Mr. Walter and Walter Brothers would be eligible for the loan forgiveness \nprogram in Section 1005 of ARPA, except Mr. Walter is white. \n12.  Plaintiffs Kevin and Lynelle Vetsch reside in Todd County, Minnesota. They \nhave FSA Direct Loans with indebtedness outstanding. Mr. and Mrs. Vetsch would be \neligible for the loan forgiveness program in Section 1005 of ARPA, except they are white. \n13.  Plaintiffs  Johnathan  and  Samantha  Quamme  reside  in  Roseau  County, \nMinnesota. They have FSA Direct Loans with indebtedness outstanding. Mr. and Mrs. \nQuamme would be eligible for the loan forgiveness program in Section 1005 of ARPA, \nexcept they are white. \n  4 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 5 of 15\n14.  Defendant  Thomas  J.  Vilsack  is  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture.  He  is \nresponsible for leading the USDA, which includes the FSA. Under Section 1005 of ARPA, \nDefendant Vilsack is required to provide debt relief to certain farmers based on race. He is \nsued in his official capacity.  \n15.  Defendant Zach Ducheneaux is the Administrator of the FSA. Among other \nthings, FSA oversees certain loan programs. Under Section 1005 of ARPA, FSA will \nprovide debt relief to certain farmers with direct loans or USDA-back loans based on race. \nHe is sued in his official capacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and \n2201 because this case presents a substantial question of federal law, specifically whether \nSection 1005 of ARPA—and Defendants’ implementation of that section—violates the \nUnited States Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws.  \n17.  This  Court  has  authority  to  issue  a  declaratory  judgment  and  to  order \ninjunctive relief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202.  \n18.  Venue  is  appropriate  in  this  district  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(e)(1).  A \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district, Defendants \nmaintain one or more offices and employees in this district, a substantial part of the \nproperty subject to this action is situated in this district, and a plaintiff resides in this \ndistrict. \n \n  5 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 6 of 15\nSTATEMENT OF THE CLAIM \n19.  On March 11, 2021, the President of the United States signed ARPA into \nlaw.  \n20.  Through Section 1005 of ARPA, Congress appropriated “such sums as may \nbe necessary” to pay for the cost of loan modifications and payments for “each socially \ndisadvantaged farmer or rancher as of January 1, 2021.”  \n21.  Section 1005(a) requires Defendant Vilsack to use the appropriated funds to \n“provide a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the outstanding indebtedness of each \nsocially disadvantaged farmer or rancher as of January 1, 2021.”  \n22.  A “socially disadvantaged farmer and rancher” has “indebtedness” if that \nfarmer or rancher owes money on a “direct farm loan made by the Secretary” or a “farm \nloan guaranteed by the Secretary.” See ARPA, Section 1005(a)(2).  \n23.  Finally, Section 1005(a)(3) states that “the term ‘socially disadvantaged \nfarmer or rancher’ has the meaning given in section 2501(a) of the Food, Agriculture, \nConservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 2279(a)).” That Act explains that the term \n“socially disadvantaged group” “means a group whose members have been subjected to \nracial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to \ntheir individual qualities.” 7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(5) & (6).  \n24.  Defendant  Vilsack  and  Defendant  Ducheneaux  are  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the loan forgiveness provisions in ARPA Section 1005. \n25.  On March 25, 2021, Defendant Vilsack offered written testimony to the \nHouse of Representatives Committee on Agriculture. Defendant Vilsack testified that \n  6 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 7 of 15\n“systemic racism” has “plague[d] the programs at the USDA, especially the Farm Loan \nProgram.”  According  to  Defendant  Vilsack,  ARPA  “provides  funding  to  address \nlongstanding racial equity issues within the Department and across agriculture.” This \nfunding, according to Defendant Vilsack, will “respond to the cumulative impacts of \nsystemic discrimination and barriers to access that have created a cycle of debt.” Defendant \nVilsack argued that prior efforts to remedy “specific, individualized discrimination” have \n“failed to do the necessary work” needed to address the “systemic discrimination [that] \nsocially disadvantaged producers face.”  \n26.  In oral testimony, Defendant Vilsack stated that the purpose of ARPA’s loan-\nforgiveness provisions was to respond to the “cumulative impact of discrimination over \ntime” and not to address “specific acts of discrimination.” Defendant Vilsack also testified \nthat aid would be distributed “based on race and ethnicity.”  \n27.  Defendant Vilsack testified that between 13,000 and 15,000 loans would be \nforgiven, and USDA will disburse up to $4 billion in loan forgiveness to non-white farmers.  \n28.  As for timing and process, Defendant Vilsack said that USDA would forgive \nloans by paying off the loan and then sending 20% of the value of the loan directly to \nfarmers.  Defendant  Vilsack  did  not  indicate  that  a  farmer  would  need  to  take  any \naffirmative step to obtain this benefit. Defendant Vilsack explained that some loans (“direct \nloans”) could be forgiven quickly because USDA was the lender. He said these loans are \n“relatively simple and straightforward” and the loan will be “paid off [and] 20 percent goes \nto the farmer.” Other loans (“guaranteed loans”), however, may take longer because USDA \nmay have to work directly with banks to sort out issues like pre-payment penalties. \n  7 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 8 of 15\nDefendant Vilsack testified that USDA has already started to reach out to banks, collect \ninformation, and has instructed them, by way of a letter dated March 25, 2021, to “take no \nfurther action whatsoever to enforce” the terms of USDA-guaranteed loans. Defendant \nVilsack  repeatedly  testified  that  ARPA’s  loan  forgiveness  provisions  would  be \nimplemented “as quickly as possible.”  \n29.  On March 26, 2021, Defendant Ducheneaux authored a blog post detailing \nhow FSA intends to implement Section 1005 of ARPA. See Zach Ducheneaux, “American \nRescue  Plan  Socially  Disadvantaged  Farmer  Debt  Payments,”  (March  26,  2021).1  \nAccording to this document, “USDA recognizes that socially disadvantaged farmers and \nranchers have faced systemic discrimination with cumulative effects that have, among \nother consequences, led to a substantial loss in the number of socially disadvantaged \nproducers, reduced the amount of farmland they control, and contributed to a cycle of debt \nthat was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.”  \n30.  Defendant Ducheneaux explained that through ARPA, FSA will provide \n“historic  debt  relief  to  socially  disadvantaged  producers  including  Black/African \nAmerican, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or \nPacific Islander.”  \n31.  According  to  Defendant  Ducheneaux,  “[a]ny  socially  disadvantaged \nborrower with direct or guaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility Loans \nqualifies.” Defendant Ducheneaux defines “socially disadvantaged” borrowers as only \n \n1  Available  at  https://www.farmers.gov/connect/blog/loans-and-grants/american-rescue-\nplan-socially-disadvantaged-farmer-debt-payments. \n  8 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 9 of 15\nthose borrowers “with direct or guaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility \nloans” and who are members of one or more of the following racial groups: “Black/African \nAmerican, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or \nPacific Islander.”  \n32.  On or about April 12, 2021, USDA updated its website to provide further \ninformation about the payments under Section 1005 of ARPA. The website confirms that \nonly certain farmers will be eligible based on race: “Eligible borrowers include those who \nidentify as one or more of the following: Black/African American, American Indian, \nAlaskan native, Hispanic/Latino, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.”2 \n33.  USDA also confirmed that eligible loans are those: “Made directly by FSA, \nincluding Farm Storage Facility Loans, Direct Farm Ownership Loans, Farm Operating \nLoans, including Microloans and Youth Loans, Emergency Loans, Conservation Loans, \nand Soil and Water Loans; and Guaranteed by FSA and made by an approved lender, \nincluding Farm Ownership Loans, Farm Operating Loans, and Conservation Loans.”  \n34.  Furthermore, on or about April 12, 2021, USDA updated its website entitled \n“American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ.”3 Again, on this website, USDA confirms \nas follows: “The American Rescue Plan Act uses Section 2501 of the Food, Agriculture, \nConservation, and Trade Act of 1990 as the definition of socially disadvantaged farmers \nand ranchers, which includes those who identify as one or more of the following: Black, \nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, Asian, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.”  \n \n2 Available at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan \n3 Available at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq   \n  9 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 10 of 15\n35.  Finally, USDA confirmed that “[n]o action on your part is needed right now” \nwith regard to this loan-forgiveness program. In other words, Defendants will begin the \nprocess of forgiving loans automatically and there is no application process or other formal \nprocess required to trigger the payment of benefits on behalf of farmers. The FAQ website \nexplains, “FSA is currently compiling and analyzing balances for all types of loans and is \ndetermining the quickest and most efficient way to make payments. Once the payment \nprocess has been finalized, all direct and guaranteed borrowers will receive a written \nnotification from FSA explaining the payment process.”  \n36.  To determine eligibility for the loan-forgiveness provision of Section 1005 \nof ARPA, Defendants will use data submitted by farmers on form AD-2047, despite the \nclear  indication  on  this form  that  “[d]emographic  information  is  used  by  USDA  for \nstatistical purposes only and will not be used to determine an applicant’s eligibility for \nprograms or services for which they apply.”  \n37.  Defendants’ form, AD-2047, also contains their admission that “the USDA, \nits Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or administering \nUSDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, \nreligion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, \nage,  marital  status,  family/parental  status,  income  derived  from  a  public  assistance \nprogram, political beliefs, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity, in any \nprogram or activity conducted or funded by USDA (not all bases apply to all programs).”  \n38.  Defendants are currently preparing to implement and will implement, absent \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief to the contrary, Section 1005 of ARPA to \n  10 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 11 of 15\nimpose a race-based loan forgiveness program. Defendants’ implementation includes the \nexpenditure of federal funds, and Defendants could begin forgiving loans at any moment \nand may have already forgiven some loans.4  \n39.  Plaintiffs are farmers who have FSA direct farm loans and are otherwise \neligible for loan forgiveness under Section 1005 of ARPA.  \n40.  But because Plaintiffs are white, they are ineligible for the loan forgiveness \nbenefit under Section 1005 of ARPA as administered by Defendants. \n41.  Were Plaintiffs eligible for the loan forgiveness benefit, they would have the \nopportunity to make additional investments in their property, expand their farms, purchase \nequipment and supplies, and otherwise support their families and local communities. \nBecause Plaintiffs are ineligible to even apply for the program solely due to their race, they \nhave been denied the equal protection of the law and therefore suffered harm. \n42.  Plaintiff Steve Nuest would purchase strip-till equipment to reduce tillage, \nincrease  carbon  sequestration,  reduce  soil  erosion  from  wind,  and  reduce  the  use of \nfertilizer and chemicals. Mr. Nuest would also contribute to a community non-profit project \nbuilding a community center that will house a daycare facility and gym space for local \nyouth basketball. \n43.  Plaintiff Kaylyn Dalsted is in need of repairs on her cattle barn. The roof of \nher only shop is caving in, and because of a lack of doors the cold inhibits machinery in \n \n4  https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/26/2021-11155/notice-of-funds-\navailability-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-1005-loan-payment-arpa \n(“Implementation will begin May 26, 2021”).  \n  11 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 12 of 15\nthe shop from working when needed. She would also buy standing panels, a better corral \nsystem, and generally invest in her livestock with the best feed and minerals they need. Ms. \nDalsted is reliant on the charity of her neighbors to cut and bale all of her hay, and would \nconsider  buying  new  cutters  and  balers  in  order  to  be  independent.  Without  loan \nforgiveness, Ms. Dalsted will struggle to keep her 3rd generation ranch going. \n44.  Plaintiff Chad Walter is in need of more space in his grain bin site. He would \nupdate his tractors and work on getting his next generation started on the family farm. In \naddition, he would continue to give charitable contributions to local organizations and \nfundraising events. \n45.  Plaintiffs Kevin and Lynelle Vetsch are first generation dairy farmers and \nwant to transition the original stanchion barn on their property to a parlor and add an \nadditional freestall to make things more user friendly and comfortable. The Vetsches hope \nto keep adding to their dairy by adding a maternity barn and better calf facilities. They also \nhope to purchase additional land in the future to support their dairy. By doing all that, they \nhope to open more employment opportunities for others in their area. \n46.  Plaintiffs Johnathan and Samantha Quamme would benefit from forgiveness \nbecause it would enable them to attempt no-till, cover crop, and organic farming. They \nwould repair equipment in need of repair to help make planting and harvesting more \nefficient. They would also consider some conservation programs. Without their FSA debts, \nthey would spend more time with family and help other farmers in the area. \n \n \n  12 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 13 of 15\nCAUSE OF ACTION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nEQUAL PROTECTION VIOLATION \n47.  Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth above \nas if fully set forth herein.  \n48.  The Constitution forbids “discrimination by the general government . . . \nagainst any citizen because of his race.” Gibson v. State of Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, 591 \n(1896). “The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains \nwithin it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.” \nUnited States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013).  \n49.  “[A]ll racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a \nreviewing court under strict scrutiny.” Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 505 (2005) \n(citation omitted). “Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving that \nracial classifications are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental \ninterests.” Id. (citation omitted).  \n50.  Section 1005 of ARPA imposes racial classifications. Farmers or ranchers \nwith direct farm loans, guaranteed farm loans, or Farm Storage Facility Loans qualify for \nloan  forgiveness  only  if  they  are  members  of  one  of  the  following  racial  groups: \nBlack/African American, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, or Asian \nAmerican or Pacific Islander.  \n51.  Defendants are responsible for interpreting and implementing Section 1005 \nof ARPA.  \n  13 \n \n\n  CASE 0:21-cv-01572-NEB-LIB   Doc. 1   Filed 07/07/21   Page 14 of 15\n52.  Although Plaintiffs are farmers with direct FSA loans, and otherwise eligible \nfor the loan forgiveness program under Section 1005 of ARPA, they are ineligible for this \nfederal benefit because they are white.  \n53.  Plaintiffs are harmed by the Defendants’ racial classifications because if \nPlaintiffs were not white, they would be receiving 120% of the value of their outstanding \ndebt and they would use that money to benefit their farm, family, and local community.  \n54.  The racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA are unconstitutional \nbecause they violate the Equal Protection guarantee in the United States Constitution.  \n55.  The racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA are not narrowly \ntailored to serve a compelling government interest.  \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court:  \nA.  Enter a temporary and preliminary injunction preventing Defendants from \napplying racial classifications when determining eligibility for loan modifications and \npayments under Section 1005 of ARPA.  \nB.  Enter a declaratory judgment that the racial classifications under Section \n1005 of ARPA are unconstitutional.  \nC.  Enter  an  order  permanently  enjoining  Defendants  from  applying  racial \nclassifications when determining eligibility for loan modifications and payments under \nSection 1005 of ARPA.  \nD.
