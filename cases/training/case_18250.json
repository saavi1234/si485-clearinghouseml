    "state": "Colorado",
    "summary": "<p>This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the American Rescue Plan&rsquo;s (ARP) classification of &ldquo;socially disadvantaged groups.&rdquo; Section 1005 of the ARP allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Farms Services Agency (FSA) to forgive previously given loans to farmers of &ldquo;socially disadvantaged groups.&rdquo; That category is defined elsewhere to mean people who have been \"subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities.\"</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff, a white farmer from northeastern Colorado, filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on June 29, 2021. The case was assigned to District Judge Daniel D. Domenico. She alleged Section 1005's categorization of socially disadvantaged groups prevented her from receiving a government benefit because of her race and thus was a racial classification that violated her Equal Protection rights. Represented by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, she asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and nominal damages of one dollar.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the case was filed, the government moved for a stay in light of <em><a href=\"../../../../case/18120/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miller v. Vilsack</a></em>, another challenge to the same program being litigated in the Northern District of Texas. In that case, the court had enjoined the implementation of Section 1005 and certified a class of farmers who would have received benefits if not for the provision's socially disadvantaged groups category.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in this case the plaintiffs filed a motion to force the government to respond to their complaint or hold them in default. On March 31, 2022, the court granted the government&rsquo;s motion to stay the proceedings, pending the resolution of <em>Miller</em>. On April 1, 2022, the court also granted the governments&rsquo; motion to continue their response deadline and denied the plaintiff's motion for default judgment.</p>\r\n<p>On September 6, 2022, the government informed the court that Congress had repealed Section 1005 of the ARPA and that the class action in <em>Miller </em>had been voluntarily dismissed. Shortly after, the government filed a motion to lift the stay and dismiss this case as moot. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the USDA had already made payments under the program, and she had suffered an equal protection injury because she was ineligible for these payments because of her race. On March 27, 2023, the court granted the government's motions to lift the stay and dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the repeal of Section 1005 rendered the case moot. 2023 WL 2958408. That same day, final judgment was entered in favor of the government.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after the judgment was entered, the plaintiff appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On October 16, 2023, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal, agreeing that the case was moot because the plaintiff had not adequately demonstrated any injury caused by the short-lived statute. 2023 WL 6810960. The court reasoned that because the challenged program had been repealed, the plaintiff could not demonstrate an ongoing injury from the alleged unequal treatment, and there was no possibility of receiving relief based on the repealed law. Further, the test payments that the USDA had made under the statute did not constitute an equal protection injury because they had occurred in a single state where the plaintiff did not live, so they would not have gone to the plaintiff regardless of race.

    "summary_short": "This case is one of several lawsuits challenging the American Rescue Plan’s (ARP) classification of “socially disadvantaged groups.” The plaintiff, a white farmer from northeastern Colorado, filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado on June 29, 2021. She alleged that the ARP's categorization of socially disadvantaged groups prevented her from receiving a government benefit because of her race and thus was a racial classification that violated her Equal Protection rights. Represented by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, she asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and nominal damages of one dollar. On March 31, 2022, the court granted the government's motion to stay the proceedings, pending the resolution of the similar Miller case. After Miller was decided, and the class action was dismissed, the government filed a motion to lift the stay and dismiss the case as moot. The district court granted the governments' motion and dismissed the case on March 27, 2023. The plaintiff appealed to the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed the district court's dismissal in October 2023. The plaintiff filed a petition for a rehearing en banc, but the court denied the petition. On March 11, 2024, the plaintiff asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, but the Court declined to hear it. The case is now closed.",

      "text": "Case 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC   Document 46   Filed 03/27/23   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 5\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO \nJudge Daniel D. Domenico \n \nCivil Action No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC \n \nSARA M. ROGERS, \n \nPlaintiff, \nv. \n \nTHOMAS J. VILSACK, in his official capacity as Secretary of the Un-\ntied States Department of Agriculture; and  \nZACH DUCHENEAUX, in his official capacity as Administrator of the \nFarm Service Agency, \n \nDefendants. \n   \n \nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO LIFT STAY \nAND DISMISS AS MOOT  \n   \n \nPlaintiff’s complaint argues that Section 1005 of the American Res-\ncue Plan Act (ARPA) violates the equal protection principles of the Fifth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. Defendants argue that \nthe plaintiff’s complaint is moot given the express repeal of Section 1005. \nAs there is no longer an ongoing case or controversy giving this court \njurisdiction, the Defendant’s motion to lift stay is granted (Doc. 41), \nand the complaint is dismissed.  \nBACKGROUND \nThe facts and procedural history of this case are well known to the \nparties. Section 1005 of the ARPA appropriated funds to provide debt \nrelief to farmers and ranchers from “socially disadvantaged” racial and \nethnic groups. Ms. Rogers holds USDA farm loans that she argues would \nhave been  eligible  under  Section  1005,  but  for  the  fact  that she  is \n- 1 - \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC   Document 46   Filed 03/27/23   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 5\nCaucasian. Doc. 1 at ¶13.  She filed a complaint seeking declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, as well as costs and fees, and nominal damages. Id. \nRelief Requested. Ms. Rogers’s contention is that Section 1005 and De-\nfendant’s implementation of it violates the equal protection principles of \nthe Fifth Amendment.  \nThis complaint was not Ms. Rogers’s only path to relief—she was also \nincluded in two certified classes challenging Section 1005. See Miller v. \nVilsack, 4:21-cv-595 (N.D. Tex.). Given Ms. Rogers’s involvement in pro-\nceedings that advanced the same central claim, the Court in the present \naction stayed proceedings pending resolution of Miller. Doc. 36. In the \nmeantime, multiple courts across the country entered preliminary in-\njunctions prohibiting enforcement of Section 1005’s racial exclusions. \nThen, in 2022, Congress expressly repealed Section 1005. See Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022 (IRA) § 22008. The parties in Miller stipulated to \nthe dismissal of the action following the repeal.  \nBefore the injunctions and repeal, Defendants conducted a test of \nSection 1005, providing debt relief on about four loans in New Mexico. \nDoc. 42 at 1. The decision to make test payments in New Mexico was not \nlinked to race or ethnicity.  \nAPPLICABLE LAW \n“Federal courts do not possess a roving commission to publicly opine \non every legal question,” even ones involving important legal or consti-\ntutional matters. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203 \n(2021). The federal courts’ subject-matter jurisdiction is limited, and \namong the most foundational limitations is that Article III of the Con-\nstitution permits federal courts to decide only “Cases” or “Controver-\nsies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. “[T]he existence of a live case or contro-\nversy  is  a  constitutional  prerequisite  to  federal  court  jurisdiction.” \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC   Document 46   Filed 03/27/23   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 5\nMcClendon v. City of Albuquerque, 100 F.3d 863, 867 (10th Cir. 1996); \nsee also Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984) (“The case-or-contro-\nversy doctrines state fundamental limits on federal judicial power in our \nsystem of government.”). \n“To qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudication, ‘an actual con-\ntroversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time \nthe complaint is filed.’” Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 \nU.S. 43, 67 (1997). Federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction over \ncases that are moot. See Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Bureau of Recla-\nmation, 601 F.3d 1096, 1109 (10th Cir.2010). Mootness can generally be \ndescribed as “the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite \npersonal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation \n(standing) must continue through its existence (mootness).” Friends of \nthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189, \n(2000). “If an intervening circumstance deprives the plaintiff of a per-\nsonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit, at any point during litigation, \nthe action can no longer proceed and must be dismissed as moot.” Brown \nv. Buhman, 822 F.3d 1151, 1165 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting Campbell-\nEwald Co. v Gomez, 577 U.S. 153 (2016)).  \nDISCUSSION \n  Ms. Rogers’s complaint is moot in light of the repeal of Section 1005. \nMs. Rogers no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit, \nas Defendants no longer have the authority to apply, implement, or en-\nforce Section 1005. The requested relief would not alter the legal posi-\ntion between the parties, so this Court does not retain subject matter \njurisdiction over Ms. Rogers’s complaint. Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 \nU.S. 85, 91 (2013). \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC   Document 46   Filed 03/27/23   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 5\n  Further, Ms. Rogers’s request for declaratory judgment that she is \neligible to receive loan forgiveness pursuant to ARPA is moot upon the \nrepeal of Section 1005. Neither Ms. Rogers nor anyone else can receive \nthe benefits of Section 1005. This Court lacks any power to alter or affect \nthe rights of Ms. Rogers or others relating to these questions.  \n  The test payments in New Mexico do not prevent a finding of moot-\nness. Ms. Rogers alleges that her injury is ongoing until I require the \ndefendants to claw back the New Mexico payments or provide Ms. Rog-\ners with debt relief. Doc. 52 at 4. Her argument fails. First, as previously \nstated, Ms. Rogers has no personal interest in Section 1005 benefits be-\ncause Section 1005 benefits do not exist, and there is no allegation that \nthey will exist again in the future. No favorable judicial decision can \ngrant her these benefits. Second, Ms. Rogers fails to show any actual \ninjury from the test payments in New Mexico because her property is in \nColorado. Regardless of whether Section 1005 debt relief was predicated \non race, Ms. Rogers would not have been eligible for test payments. \nWithout a personal interest, Ms. Rogers lacks standing to sue. See Hein \nv. Freedom From Religion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 593 (2007) (holding \nthat outside of a narrow Establishment Clause exception, there is a gen-\neral rule against federal taxpayer standing).  \n  Finally, Ms. Rogers’s claim for nominal damages and costs and fees \ncannot resurrect her complaint. This Court does not have the jurisdic-\ntion to award nominal damages because there is no applicable waiver of \nsovereign immunity. See Normandy Apartments, Ltd. v. U.S. Dep't of \nHous. & Urb. Dev., 554 F.3d 1290, 1295 (10th Cir. 2009); Clark v. Libr. \nof Cong., 750 F.2d 89, 103 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (“Sovereign immunity, how-\never, does bar suits for money damages against officials in their official \ncapacity absent a specific waiver by the government.”). Ms. Rogers’s \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC   Document 46   Filed 03/27/23   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 5\nclaim for costs and fees also fails to preserve the case because it is unre-\nlated to the subject matter of the litigation. Diamond v. Charles, 476 \nU.S. 54, 70 (1986). \nCONCLUSION \nIt is ORDERED that: \nThe  Motion  to  Lift  Stay  and  Dismiss  as  Moot  (Doc. 41)  is \nGRANTED; \nThe stay entered by order of the Court (Doc. 36) is LIFTED; and \nBecause the Court lacks jurisdiction, this case is DISMISSED.  \nDATED: March 27, 2023  BY THE COURT: \n \n \n   \nDaniel D. Domenico \nUnited States District Judge \n- 5 - ",

Carpenter is one of more than a dozen farmers and ranchers who filed \nlawsuits against Appellees Thomas J. Vilsack, the Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, and Zach Ducheneaux, the Administrator of the Farm Service \nAgency,1 challenging the constitutionality of § 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act of \n2021. While Ms. Carpenter’s suit was pending in the District of Wyoming, Congress \nrepealed § 1005. The district court determined the repeal mooted Ms. Carpenter’s claims \nand dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  \nSara M. Rogers, represented in part by the same counsel as Ms. Carpenter, filed a \nnearly identical lawsuit in the District of Colorado. Her case was also dismissed on \nmootness grounds. On appeal, Ms. Rogers’ case was partially consolidated with \nMs. Carpenter’s case. Ms. Rogers relies on Ms. Carpenter’s briefing and argument and \nagrees to be bound by the decision on Ms. Carpenter’s appeal.  \n \n* This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines \nof law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for \nits persuasive value consistent with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and \nTenth Circuit Rule 32.1. \n1 Appellees are responsible for administering the relevant loan forgiveness \nprogram and Ms. Carpenter sues them in their official capacities.  \n  2 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 3 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 3 \nMs. Carpenter maintains she suffered and continues to suffer an equal protection \ninjury due to § 1005. We disagree and affirm the district courts’ dismissals because the \ncases are moot. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Factual History \n1.  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, § 1005 \nIn March 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 \n(“ARPA”). Pub. L. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4. Section 1005 of ARPA appropriated “such sums as \nmay be necessary” to pay up to 120% of the outstanding indebtedness on direct farm \nloans and guaranteed farm loans for “each socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher.” \nARPA § 1005(a). Section 1005(b)(3) gives “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” \nthe same meaning as in the Food, Agriculture Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, \nwhich defines a “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” as “a farmer or rancher who \nis a member of a socially disadvantaged group.” 7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(5). The statute \nfurther defines “socially disadvantaged group” as “a group whose members have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group \nwithout regard to their individual qualities.” Id. § 2279(a)(6). In its “Notice of Funds \nAvailability,” the agency specified that § 1005 funds were limited to farmers and \nranchers who were from a socially disadvantaged group, including but not limited to \nBlacks or African Americans, Asians, Hispanics or Latinos, American Indians or Alaskan \nNatives, or Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders. 86 Fed. Reg. 28,329, 28,330 \n  3 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 4 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 4 \n(May 26, 2021). The agency also announced that receiving loan forgiveness under § 1005 \nwould not prevent farmers and ranchers from obtaining future farm loans.2  \nConstitutional challenges to § 1005 arose almost immediately. At least twelve \ncases were filed in federal district courts. In an action in the Eastern District of \nWisconsin, William Cobb—a United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) \nadministrator responsible for overseeing farm loan programs—filed a declaration \nexplaining that the Farm Service Agency (“FSA”) had mailed five offer letters to eligible \nrecipients in New Mexico “to test the effectiveness of the procedures FSA established to \ndeliver ARPA Section 1005 payments.” App. at 253. FSA had selected New Mexico in \npart because it had a relatively large volume of direct loan borrowers eligible for ARPA \nrelief and “a high level of experienced staff.” Id. “The eligible accounts were selected \nbased on the borrowers being sole proprietorships rather than entities, and past \ninteractions with FSA that reflected a willingness to be part of a pilot initiative.” Id. Four \nof the eligible recipients accepted the offers and payments were processed between \nJune 3 and June 8, 2021. Mr. Cobb stated that FSA anticipated beginning to send offer \nletters for 8,580 accounts on June 9, 2021, expecting the mailings to be completed within \ntwo weeks of that date. FSA estimated it would take nine weeks to complete the other \n6,836 accounts that required FSA to calculate reversals of 2021 payments to date before \nsending offer letters. Extrapolating from these statements, it appears FSA expected all \n \n2 This practice would represent a departure from 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(b), which, \nwith certain exceptions, prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from making and \nguaranteeing loans to borrowers who have received debt forgiveness, as defined in \nthe statute.  \n  4 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 5 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 5 \noffer letters to be sent, acceptances received, and payments processed by the end of \nAugust 2021. \nOn June 10, 2021, however—the day after FSA was to begin sending offer letters, \naccording to Mr. Cobb—the Eastern District of Wisconsin issued a temporary restraining \norder enjoining any loan forgiveness under § 1005. Faust v. Vilsack, 519 F. Supp. 3d 470, \n478 (E.D. Wis. 2021). Other district courts then preliminarily enjoined the \nimplementation of § 1005. See Wynn v. Vilsack, 545 F. Supp. 3d 1271, 1295 (M.D. Fla. \n2021); Holman v. Vilsack, No. 1:21-cv-1085, 2021 WL 2877915, at *14 (W.D. Tenn. \nJuly 8, 2021); Order on Class Certification & Prelim. Inj. at 23–24, Miller v. Vilsack, \nNo. 4:21-cv-595 (N.D. Tex. July 2, 2021), ECF No. 60.  \nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 \nexpressly repealing ARPA § 1005. Pub. L. No. 117-169 § 22008, 136 Stat. 1818, 2023 \n(2022). The parties in at least one case challenging § 1005 subsequently stipulated to \ndismissal based on mootness.  \n2.  Appellants \nAccording to Ms. Carpenter’s complaint (the “Complaint”), Ms. Carpenter is a \nWyoming cattle rancher and young mother whose Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish \nancestors homesteaded her property in 1894. The ranch is her family’s sole source of \nincome. Ms. Carpenter took out an FSA loan in 2012. In the Complaint, Ms. Carpenter \nalleges she would be eligible for loan forgiveness under § 1005, and for future FSA loans \nafter such forgiveness, if she were not white.  \n  5 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 6 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 6 \nMs. Rogers similarly asserts that she is a Colorado grain farmer and mother of \nyoung children who supports her family entirely from the farm. Like Ms. Carpenter, \nMs. Rogers asserts she would be eligible for ARPA loan forgiveness, but for her race.  \nB.  Procedural History3 \n1.  Complaint \nMs. Carpenter filed a Complaint in the District of Wyoming in May 2021. She \nclaimed § 1005 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. She also \nclaimed USDA’s promise that those who receive loan forgiveness under ARPA would \ncontinue to be eligible for future loans violated a pre-existing law forbidding USDA \nloans to past recipients of loan forgiveness.4 See 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(b). Ms. Carpenter \nrequested (1) a declaratory judgment that the racial classifications in ARPA are \nunconstitutional; (2) a declaratory judgment that Ms. Carpenter is eligible to receive loan \nforgiveness under ARPA; (3) a declaratory judgment that further loans to those who \nreceive ARPA loan forgiveness is unlawful; (4) a permanent injunction against applying \n \n3 Because Ms. Rogers has agreed to be bound by the decision on \nMs. Carpenter’s appeal, see Order Granting in Part Ms. Rogers’ Motion to \nConsolidate, Rogers v. Vilsack, No. 23‑1122 (10th Cir. May 30, 2023), we focus our \ndiscussion of the procedural history on Ms. Carpenter’s case. \n4 On its face, this claim is based on a conflict between § 1005 and another \nstatute, not the Equal Protection Clause. The degree to which this claim was moot \nwas neither briefed nor decided in the district court and Ms. Carpenter raises no \nseparate argument about this claim on appeal, waiving any such argument. Garrett v. \nSelby Connor Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 841 (10th Cir. 2005) (“[I]ssues will be \ndeemed waived if they are not adequately briefed.” (alteration in original) (quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n  6 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 7 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 7 \nracial classifications to determine eligibility for ARPA relief; (5) a permanent injunction \nagainst declaring Ms. Carpenter ineligible for future FSA loan participation to the extent \nsuch participation is permitted for recipients of ARPA relief; (6) alternatively, an \ninjunction against administering § 1005 of ARPA; (7) nominal damages of one dollar; \n(8) costs and attorney fees; and (9) “such other and further relief as the Court deems \nappropriate.” App. at 21. \n2.  Motion to Stay \nIn July 2021, Appellees moved to stay the proceedings pending resolution of \nMiller v. Vilsack, a class action in the Northern District of Texas. See Order on Class \nCertification & Prelim. Inj., Miller v. Vilsack, No. 4:21-cv-595 (N.D. Tex. July 2, 2021), \nECF No. 60. The Northern District of Texas had certified two classes of farmers and \nranchers challenging § 1005 on equal protection grounds, and Ms. Carpenter was a \nmandatory member of both classes. Id. at 5–15, 23. The court had also issued a \npreliminary injunction against disbursing funds under § 1005. Id. at 23–24. Ms. Carpenter \nopposed a stay, arguing that she had no control over the class action proceedings and that \nthe issues were not identical because the class action did not include a challenge to \nARPA relief recipients’ eligibility for future FSA loans, as hers did. She pointed out that \nanother district court had denied a stay in a similar case. See Order, Holman v. Vilsack, \nNo. 1:21-cv-1085 (W.D. Tenn. Aug. 2, 2021), ECF No. 49. In August 2021, the District \nof Wyoming nevertheless stayed Ms. Carpenter’s case, pending resolution of Miller.  \n  7 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 8 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 8 \n3.  Motion to Dismiss as Moot \nIn an August 2022 status report, Appellees notified the district court that ARPA \n§ 1005 had been repealed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In September 2022, \nAppellees notified the district court that the parties in Miller had stipulated to dismissal \nbased on mootness. Joint Stipulation of Dismissal, Miller v. Vilsack, No. 4:21-cv-595 \n(N.D. Tex. Aug. 29, 2022), ECF No. 236. Unable to obtain agreement from \nMs. Carpenter for a similar stipulated dismissal based on mootness, Appellees filed a \nmotion to lift the stay and dismiss the case as moot.  \nMs. Carpenter opposed the motion, submitting Mr. Cobb’s declaration and an \nunidentified online article to support her claim that USDA had distributed some benefits \nto others under § 1005 because USDA had provided debt relief on at least four loans, \noffered to forgive a fifth loan, and “likely credited back hundreds of loan payments to \ncertain borrowers,” based solely on race. App. at 228. She argued that because she was \nineligible for those benefits, she suffered differential treatment on the basis of her race, an \ninjury that repeal of the statute did not undo. She requested that the effects of previous \nimplementation of § 1005 be “unwound” and “the playing field . . . appropriately \nequalized” to “restore constitutional balance.” Id. at 229. \nThe district court granted the motion to lift the stay and dismiss the case as moot. \nThe district court reasoned that Ms. Carpenter’s request to enjoin application, \nimplementation, or enforcement of § 1005 was moot because Appellees no longer had \nauthority to do so. The district court determined Ms. Carpenter’s requests for declaratory \nrelief were moot because such relief would not alter or affect her rights in any way, given \n  8 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 9 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 9 \nthat neither Ms. Carpenter nor anyone else could receive funds under § 1005. Finally, the \ndistrict court rejected Ms. Carpenter’s argument that her request for “other relief” saved \nher case from mootness, explaining that clawing back money from those who received \ntest payments would not restore any benefit to Ms. Carpenter, whose interest was in loan \nrepayments she could no longer receive. The district court further opined that \nMs. Carpenter was not injured by the test payments because she could not have been \neligible for them in any case, given that they were made only to New Mexico farmers.  \nMs. Carpenter appealed. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nMs. Carpenter challenges the district court’s dismissal of her case as moot. \nMootness is a question of law this court reviews de novo. Rio Grande Found. v. Oliver, \n57 F.4th 1147, 1159 (10th Cir. 2023). Because the district court properly dismissed \nMs. Carpenter’s case as moot, we affirm.5 \nA.  Mootness Legal Rule \nArticle III of the Constitution permits federal courts to decide only “cases” or \n“controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. This requires “a genuine, live dispute \nbetween adverse parties, thereby preventing the federal courts from issuing advisory \nopinions.” Carney v. Adams, 141 S. Ct. 493, 498 (2020). Article III’s case-or-controversy \nrequirement comprises three elements: injury in fact, causation, and redressability. Steel \n \n5 After the parties’ briefs were filed, both Ms. Carpenter and Appellees \nsubmitted letters with supplemental authorities pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate \nProcedure 28(j). We have reviewed these authorities and conclude they are not \ninconsistent with our holding.  \n  9 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 10 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 10 \nCo. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 103–04 (1998); Spencer v. Kemna, \n523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998) (“[T]hroughout the litigation, the plaintiff ‘must have suffered, or be \nthreatened with, an actual injury traceable to the defendant and likely to be redressed by a \nfavorable judicial decision.’” (quoting Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477 \n(1990))). The case-or-controversy requirement “is built on separation-of-powers \nprinciples [and] serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the \npowers of the political branches.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 \n(2013). Although the primary concern is jurisdictional, the case-or-controversy \nrequirement also protects judicial economy, ensuring “the scarce resources of the federal \ncourts are devoted to those disputes in which the parties have a concrete stake.” Friends \nof the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 191 (2000). \nThe doctrines of standing and mootness aim to ensure federal courts stay within \nArticle III’s bounds throughout the litigation.6 Brown v. Buhman, 822 F.3d 1151, 1163 \n(10th Cir. 2016) (“Standing concerns whether a plaintiff’s action qualifies as a case or \ncontroversy when it is filed; mootness ensures it remains one at the time a court renders \nits decision.”); see Arizonans for Off. Eng. v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 68 n.22 (1997) \n(explaining mootness “has been described as ‘the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: \nThe requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation \n \n6 A third doctrine, ripeness, “aims to prevent courts from entangling \nthemselves in abstract disagreements by avoiding premature adjudication.” Cellport \nSys., Inc. v. Peiker Acustic GMBH & Co. KG, 762 F.3d 1016, 1029 (10th Cir. 2014) \n(quotation marks omitted).  \n  10 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 11 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 11 \n(standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness)’” (quoting U.S. Parole \nComm’n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980))). Even where the plaintiff had standing \nat the case’s inception, if it later becomes evident that one or more elements of an \nArticle III case or controversy is lacking, the claim is moot and the court lacks \njurisdiction. Campbell–Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 136 S. Ct. 663, 669 (2016); Schell v. OXY \nUSA, Inc., 814 F.3d 1107, 1114 (10th Cir. 2016); Ind v. Colo. Dep’t of Corr., 801 F.3d \n1209, 1213 (10th Cir. 2015) (“[A] case becomes moot when a plaintiff no longer suffers \nactual injury that can be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). “Failure to satisfy the requirements of either doctrine places a dispute \noutside the reach of the federal courts.” Brown, 822 F.3d at 1164.7  \nThe party invoking federal jurisdiction “bears the burden of establishing standing \nas of the time it brought [the] lawsuit and maintaining it thereafter.” Carney, 141 S. Ct. \nat 499 (emphasis added). However, “[t]he ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the court that \nthe challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again lies with the party \nasserting mootness.” Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189 (alteration in original) \n(quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Exp. Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968)). \nWe evaluate mootness as to each form of relief requested. Prison Legal News v. Fed. \nBureau of Prisons, 944 F.3d 868, 880 (10th Cir. 2019). \n \n7 As we explain infra, there is one relevant exception to this general rule: the \nvoluntary cessation doctrine.  \n  11 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 12 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 12 \nMaterial amendment or repeal of a law moots certain legal challenges to the law. \nU.S. Dep’t of the Treasury v. Galioto, 477 U.S. 556, 559–60 (1986); Nat’l Adv. Co. v. \nCity & Cnty. Of Denver, 912 F.2d 405, 412 (10th Cir. 1990). However, a claim based on \na repealed statute is not moot “so long as damages or other monetary relief may be \nclaimed on account of the [repealed] provisions. Other forms of retroactive remedies also \nmay forestall mootness.” Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, \n13C Federal Practice and Procedure Jurisdiction § 3533.6 (3d ed. updated Apr. 2023).  \nWith this legal background in mind, we now consider whether the repeal of § 1005 \nhas rendered moot the cases before us. \nB.  Analysis \nAlthough Ms. Carpenter bears the ultimate burden to show a live case or \ncontroversy, Appellees bear the “heavy burden” of showing mootness. Friends of the \nEarth, 528 U.S. at 189; see also Audubon of Kan., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 67 F.4th \n1093, 1102–03 (10th Cir. 2023) (placing the burden to show mootness on the party \nasserting mootness on appeal). Appellees contend, and the district court held, that repeal \nof § 1005 mooted Ms. Carpenter’s claims. Ms. Carpenter argues that her equal protection \nclaim is not moot because USDA made test payments to some farmers based on their \nrace, while Ms. Carpenter received no such assistance because she is white. She objects \nto the conclusion that she suffered no injury because she lives in Wyoming. She also \ncontends that the Complaint’s failure to specifically request that USDA claw back the \ndisbursed funds does not prevent her from requesting this relief to defeat a mootness \n  12 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 13 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 13 \nchallenge and asserts that various alleged procedural impediments to her requesting such \nclawbacks are irrelevant to mootness.  \nWe consider each of Ms. Carpenter’s arguments in turn, first concluding that she \nfails to show any injury in fact from the brief existence and partial implementation of the \nstatute. As a result, Ms. Carpenter fails to plausibly show the elements of an Article III \ncase or controversy. Further, to the extent that Ms. Carpenter argues that voluntary \ncessation saves her claims from mootness, we conclude that doctrine does not apply. \nFinally, because there is no Article III case or controversy, we need not reach Appellees’ \nalternative arguments based on prudential mootness. \n1.  Elements of a Case or Controversy \na.  Injury in fact \nTo satisfy Article III, an injury must be distinct, palpable, and personal. Duke \nPower Co. v. Carolina Env’t Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 72 (1978). In the equal \nprotection context, an injury in fact occurs when actual unequal treatment occurs. See \nVacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 799 (1997) (explaining that the Equal Protection Clause in \nthe Fourteenth Amendment “creates no substantive rights” and instead “embodies a \ngeneral rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases \naccordingly”); Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992) (“The Equal Protection Clause \ndoes not forbid classifications. It simply keeps governmental decisionmakers from \ntreating differently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.”); City of Herriman v. \nBell, 590 F.3d 1176, 1181 (10th Cir. 2010) (explaining that an equal protection claim \nchallenging school board election law accrued when the election was held and plaintiffs \n  13 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 14 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 14 \nwere unable to vote). As relevant here, an equal protection injury may consist of (1) the \ndenial of a benefit or (2) the denial of equal treatment in accessing the benefit. See Ne. \nFla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, \n666 (1993) (pointing to unequal treatment resulting from “a barrier that makes it more \ndifficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another \ngroup” and determining that the “injury-in-fact” in a set-aside program was not simply \nthe loss of a contract with the city but “the inability to compete on an equal footing in the \nbidding process”); U.S. Dep’t of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms v. \nGalioto, 477 U.S. 556, 559–60 (1986) (determining equal protection claim mooted by \namendment of statute that put plaintiffs on equal footing with others); Turner v. Fouche, \n396 U.S. 346, 362 (1970) (“We may assume that the [plaintiffs] have no right to be \nappointed to the . . . board of education. But [they] do have a federal constitutional right \nto be considered for public service without the burden of invidiously discriminatory \ndisqualifications.”).  \nThe injunctions against implementation of § 1005 and the section’s eventual \nrepeal rendered any equal protection injury impossible. In the Complaint, Ms. Carpenter \nclaimed: \nAlthough Plaintiff is a rancher with a direct FSA loan, and otherwise \neligible for the loan forgiveness program under Section 1005 of ARPA, she \nis ineligible for this federal benefit because she is white. \nPlaintiff is harmed by the Defendants’ racial classifications because, but for \nPlaintiff’s skin color, she would be receiving up to 120% of the value of her \noutstanding debt and she would use that money to benefit her ranch and \nfamily. \n  14 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 15 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 15 \nApp. at 19. The Complaint further stated that “[b]ecause [Ms. Carpenter] is ineligible to \nreceive loan forgiveness solely due to her race, she has been denied the equal protection \nof the laws and has therefore suffered harm.” Id. at 17. Ms. Carpenter alleged that \nAppellees would begin processing payment letters under § 1005 the next month.  \nThe only inequality Ms. Carpenter pleaded—race-based ineligibility for loan \nforgiveness—did not cause actual injury and no longer exists. There is no allegation in \nthe Complaint that Appellees ever actually engaged in unequal treatment, and \ncircumstances have changed such that future injury is impossible. Section 1005 has been \nrepealed, and Appellees lack authority and funding to engage in the challenged \ndiscrimination. When events during the pendency of the litigation leave no harm to be \nredressed, the case is moot, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it further. “[T]o render a \ndecision on the validity of the now nonexistent [§ 1005] would constitute a textbook \nexample of advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts rather than \nupon an actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution.” \nWyoming v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 414 F.3d 1207, 1212–13 (10th Cir. 2005) (internal \nquotation marks omitted); see also Am. Charities for Reasonable Fundraising Regul., \nInc. v. O’Bannon, 909 F.3d 329, 331–33 (10th Cir. 2018) (holding that a challenge to \nUtah’s charitable solicitation registration laws became moot when Utah substantially \nrevised its law such that the restrictions no longer applied to the plaintiff); Kan. Jud. Rev. \nv. Stout, 562 F.3d 1240, 1244–46 (10th Cir. 2009) (dismissing a challenge to the Kansas \nCode of Judicial Conduct where, while the appeal was pending, the Kansas Supreme \nCourt adopted a new Code of Judicial Conduct that eliminated the challenged ban on \n  15 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 16 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 16 \nsolicitation and significantly revised the challenged clauses about pledges and \ncommitments).  \nArguing against mootness, Ms. Carpenter (1) points to the New Mexico test \npayments as injuring her and (2) suggests that other implementation might have occurred \nthat might be revealed in discovery if the case were allowed to proceed. On the first \npoint, Ms. Carpenter argues that the fact the test payments were all made in New Mexico, \nrather than Wyoming, is irrelevant to her claimed injury because the decision to do the \ntest in New Mexico was a “unilateral decision of Appellees in selecting the state \nresidencies of recipients of Section 1005 payments” that was unrelated to the \ndiscriminatory statute.8 Appellant’s Br. at 10–11. But it is precisely because the decision \nto do the test in New Mexico was unrelated to the statutory language that Ms. Carpenter \ncannot claim an injury based on § 1005’s racial distinctions. If Appellees’ administration \nof the test payments can be said to have excluded Ms. Carpenter from consideration at \nall, it was because she lives in Wyoming rather than New Mexico. Even if she were not \nwhite, Ms. Carpenter would have been excluded from the test payments. The test \npayments to four New Mexico farmers therefore do not constitute an injury to \nMs. Carpenter based on the racial distinctions in § 1005. \n \n8 At oral argument, Ms. Carpenter briefly suggested that the selection of New \nMexico as the location for test payments was racially motivated, before clarifying \nthat she is not arguing that New Mexico should not have been selected for test \npayments to the isolation of other states. Oral Argument at 13:04–16, Carpenter v. \nVilsack, No. 22‑8079 (10th Cir. Sept. 13, 2023). Consequently, we do not consider \nthis argument. \n  16 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 17 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 17 \nMs. Carpenter also suggests there may be an injury yet to be discovered, such as \nother payments made before courts enjoined implementation of the statute, contending \nthat there has never been a “full accounting of how [§] 1005 was implemented—given \nthat no discovery has taken place.” Appellant’s Br. at 10. But Ms. Carpenter bears the \nburden to plead facts showing a live case or controversy. See Shapiro v. McManus, \n136 S. Ct. 450, 455 (2015) (explaining that a plaintiff must “raise a substantial federal \nquestion for jurisdictional purposes” that is not “‘wholly insubstantial and frivolous’” \n(quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682–83 (1946))); Baca v. Colo. Dep’t of State, \n935 F.3d 887, 925 (10th Cir. 2019) (finding claim not so frivolous as to defeat subject \nmatter jurisdiction), rev’d on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 2316 (2020). In the Complaint, \nMs. Carpenter does not allege other payments were actually made, and she never \nrequested leave to amend the Complaint.9 Ms. Carpenter continues to disclaim any \nresponsibility to amend her Complaint but suggests that “if this Court is truly concerned \nabout [her] prayer for relief, the proper route is to hold that the dispute is not moot and \nreverse the District Court with instructions to allow the amendment of the complaint.” \nReply at 24. She cites Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church of Miami, Florida, Inc., \n404 U.S. 412, 415 (1972), in which the Supreme Court vacated and remanded a moot \n \n9 There does not appear to have been any impediment to amendment; dismissal \nfor lack of jurisdiction is without prejudice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b); Brereton v. \nBountiful City Corp., 434 F.3d 1213, 1218 (10th Cir. 2006) (“Dismissals for lack of \njurisdiction [are] without prejudice because the court, having determined that it lacks \njurisdiction over the action, is incapable of reaching a disposition on the merits of the \nunderlying claims.”). In fact, Ms. Carpenter acknowledged the possibility of \namendment but expressly declined to do so.  \n  17 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 18 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 18 \ncase because “it is possible that appellants may wish to amend their complaint so as to \ndemonstrate that the repealed statute retains some continuing force or to attack the newly \nenacted legislation.” However, in Diffenderfer, the statute had become moot on appeal, so \nthe plaintiff never had the opportunity to amend the complaint to address this change in \nthe law. Id. at 413–14. In contrast, Ms. Carpenter had the opportunity and purposefully \nchose not to amend.  \nFurthermore, Ms. Carpenter’s claim that other payments might have been made is \npurely speculative; she relies only on an unidentified article from an unnamed website \nstating that USDA made $1 million in payments before the program was shut down. In \nlight of Mr. Cobb’s declaration detailing the test payments and schedule for \nimplementation, and Appellees’ representation that the test payments amounted only to \n$160,218 and no other payments were made, this is simply not plausible; implementation \nwas enjoined the day after FSA was to begin mailing offer letters.10  \nMs. Carpenter next attempts to support her claims of an ongoing equal protection \ninjury by citing inapposite cases. First, she points to Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio \nArriba County, 440 F.3d 1202, 1209 (10th Cir. 2006) to argue that, following intervening \nlegislation, courts still have jurisdiction to address equal protection injuries not addressed \n \n10 Ms. Carpenter objects to relying on Mr. Cobb’s declaration as dispositive at \nthis stage. However, “government[al] actors in their sovereign capacity and in the \nexercise of their official duties are accorded a presumption of good faith because they \nare public servants, not self-interested private parties.” Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. \nBureau of Reclamation, 601 F.3d 1096, 1116 n.15 (10th Cir. 2010) (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Sossamon v. Texas, 560 F.3d 316, 325 (5th Cir. 2009)). \nMs. Carpenter provides no reason to doubt Mr. Cobb’s truthfulness. \n  18 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 19 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 19 \nby the relevant law’s amendment or recission. In Jicarilla Apache Nation, the New \nMexico legislature amended a challenged tax statute in a way that resolved the \nunderlying equal protection issues in the plaintiff Indian tribe’s favor for future tax years. \n440 F.3d at 1208. This court determined that the amendment mooted the plaintiff’s \nrequest for prospective injunctive relief for tax years after the statute’s effective date, \nbecause the amendment “[gave] the Nation all that it sought to achieve through its \ninjunctive action.” Id. However, we determined that a live controversy still existed \nregarding the Nation’s claims for damages in connection with the tax years before the \nstatute’s effective date. Id. (citing Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.S. 455, 459 n. 6 (1981)). \nThe court also determined that the claim for injunctive relief with respect to the most \nrecent tax year still presented a live controversy because the parties disputed the effective \ndate of the amended statute, so declaratory and/or injunctive relief could conceivably be \nappropriate. Id. In contrast, Ms. Carpenter points to no injury analogous to the injuries in \nJicarilla. Apart from the New Mexico test payments, which we have already determined \nare not injuries stemming from § 1005’s racial distinctions, Ms. Carpenter has not \nidentified any actual monetary harm from past payments made under the challenged \nstatute or a present dispute over payments.  \nMs. Carpenter also relies on Serna v. Portales Municipal Schools, 499 F.2d 1147, \n1154 (10th Cir. 1974), to assert “the trial court had a duty to fashion a program which \n  19 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 20 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 20 \nwould provide adequate relief.”11 Appellant’s Br. at 9. In Serna, we affirmed the district \ncourt’s determination that a school district had violated the Civil Rights Act by depriving \nchildren with Spanish surnames appropriate education and upheld the remedial plan the \ndistrict court had ordered to remedy the violation. 499 F.2d at 1152–54. There was no \nsuggestion that the matter had become moot because children with Spanish surnames \nactually had been deprived of appropriate education. Id. at 1154 (“Each minor child is \nallegedly a student in the Portales schools or was excluded therefrom. The complaint \nalleges that those and all Spanish surnamed school children have been subject to \ndiscrimination by the school district.”). Here, Appellees never denied Ms. Carpenter \nany benefit—or even any opportunity to receive a benefit—based on her race. \nMs. Carpenter also attempts to support her claim to a continuing stake in the \nlitigation by pointing to cases affirming courts’ ability to remedy ongoing effects of past \nracial discrimination. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. Of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15, \n28 (1971); Louisiana v. United States, 380 U.S. 145, 154 (1965). But the cited cases \nrelate to a court’s ability or duty to fashion relief for a civil rights violation where there is \nsuch a violation. A court’s broad power to remedy an injury does not broaden the \ndefinition of an injury.  \nIn another case Ms. Carpenter cites, Vitolo v. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 359 (6th Cir. \n2021), the Sixth Circuit enjoined administration of a COVID-19 relief statute that gave \n \n11 Although the appellants unsuccessfully raised a standing issue in Serna v. \nPortales Municipal Schools, 499 F.2d 1147, 1152 (10th Cir. 1974), Ms. Carpenter \ndoes not cite to that portion of the opinion.  \n  20 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 21 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 21 \npriority treatment to female applicants and applicants of certain races, even though the \npriority period had expired and the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) would \nprocess future requests in the order they were received. The court discerned a live \ncontroversy because SBA was still processing the priority applications first, creating a \nrisk that the funds would be depleted before the non-priority plaintiffs’ applications were \nprocessed—a problem a court could remedy by ordering the SBA to process all the \napplications in the order in which they were received. Id. at 359–60. In contrast to those \nplaintiffs, Ms. Carpenter is not at risk of losing any opportunity to receive a benefit if the \ncourt does not intervene. Upon repeal of § 1005, no benefits are available irrespective of \nrace. \nMs. Carpenter has failed to show that she suffered or continues to suffer an injury \nin fact.12 Ms. Carpenter, a rancher in Wyoming, was not eligible for the New Mexico test \npayments regardless of her race. She fails to otherwise articulate an injury in fact, instead \narguing that she may identify such an injury if given the opportunity to engage in \n \n12 Ms. Carpenter also objects to another court’s characterization of the test \npayments as de minimis. The district court here did not characterize the payments as \nde minimis or suggest that the case was moot due to the minimal nature of Ms. \nCarpenter’s injuries, nor is it necessary to do so to find this case moot. This case is \nmoot not because Ms. Carpenter’s injuries were insignificant but because she \nsuffered no injury at all.  \n  21 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 22 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 22 \ndiscovery. Thus, Ms. Carpenter has failed to plead one of the three elements of \nArticle III’s case-or-controversy requirement.13  \n2.  Voluntary Cessation  \nCourts will find an exception to mootness when a defendant voluntarily ceases an \nallegedly unlawful practice but is free to resume its challenged practice at any time. \nRio Grande Silvery Minnow, 601 F.3d at 1115. “[T]his exception exists to counteract the \npossibility of a defendant ceasing illegal action long enough to render a lawsuit moot and \nthen resuming the illegal conduct.” Id. (quotation marks omitted). However, the \nvoluntary cessation doctrine does not overcome mootness where “(1) it can be said with \nassurance that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur, and \n(2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the \nalleged violation.” Id. (quoting Cnty. of L. A. v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)). \n“[V]oluntary cessation of offensive conduct will only moot litigation if it is clear that the \ndefendant has not changed course simply to deprive the court of jurisdiction.” Id. \n(alteration in original) (quoting Nat’l Adver. Co. v. City of Miami, 402 F.3d 1329, 1333 \n(11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam)). “The party asserting mootness bears the ‘“heavy burden \nof persua[ding]” the court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to \nstart up again.’” Id. at 1116 (alteration in original) (quoting Friends of the Earth, \n528 U.S. at 189). \n \n13 Because we conclude that Ms. Carpenter has no injury, we need not evaluate \nthe other two elements of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement—causation and \nredressability. A non-existent injury has no cause and cannot be redressed.  \n  22 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 23 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 23 \nAppellees contend that the voluntary cessation doctrine does not apply here \nbecause Congress, not USDA, is responsible for the intervening action, the formal \nrecission of a law is enough to establish mootness, there is no evidence to indicate that \nthe legislature intends to reenact § 1005, and Ms. Carpenter has not identified any \nlingering effects of § 1005 that will influence her relationship with USDA in the future. \nMs. Carpenter cites several voluntary cessation cases in her opening brief, although her \nreply appears to disavow any argument based on voluntary cessation. In her reply, she \nargues an ongoing injury from Appellees’ past conduct, rather than the prospect that the \nstatute will be re-enacted or that Appellees will again attempt to implement it. \nMs. Carpenter also expresses concern that finding this case moot would provide “a \njudicial roadmap to race discrimination” because government actors could freely engage \nin race-based discrimination until courts enjoin them without facing accountability for the \nconstitutional injuries they caused in the interim. Reply at 25.  \nAppellees have carried their burden and persuaded us that the voluntary cessation \ndoctrine to defeat mootness does not apply. This court has held that when a legislature \nrepeals or amends a statute after it is judicially challenged, the voluntary cessation \nexception does not apply unless there is evidence indicating “that the legislature intends \nto reenact the prior version of the disputed statute.” Camfield v. City of Oklahoma City, \n248 F.3d 1214, 1222–24 (10th Cir. 2001) (holding constitutional challenge to censorship \nof a film under Oklahoma’s child pornography statute became moot when the Oklahoma \nlegislature revised the law to remove the challenged language and there was no evidence \nthe legislature intended to reenact the former version of the statute); see Wright et al., \n  23 \n \n\nCase No. 1:21-cv-01779-DDD-SKC     Document 53     filed 10/16/23     USDC Colorado \npg 24 of 27\nAppellate Case: 22-8079     Document: 010110936683     Date Filed: 10/16/2023     Page: 24 \n13C Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 3533.6 (3d ed. 2018) (“Most cases that deny mootness [based \non voluntary cessation] rely on clear showings of reluctant submission [by government \nactors] and a desire to return to the old ways.”). There is no indication in the Complaint \nor any exhibit in this case that Congress intends to re-enact the provisions of § 1005, nor \nis it plausible Congress would do so given that the emergency that prompted § 1005 in \nthe first place—the sudden economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic—\nno longer exists. Thus, the voluntary cessation doctrine would not save Ms. Carpenter’s \nclaims from mootness. \n3.  Prudential Mootness  \nAppellees suggest that even if there were an Article III case or controversy, \nprudential mootness should apply. “[A] court may dismiss [a] case [that is not moot \nunder Article III] under the prudential-mootness doctrine if the case is so attenuated that \nconsiderations of prudence and comity for coordinate branches of government counsel \nthe court to stay its hand, and to withhold relief it has the power to grant.” Rio Grande \nSilvery Minnow, 601 F.3d at 1121 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because there is no \nArticle III case or controversy, we need not reach prudential mootness.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nThe district court properly dismissed Ms. Carpenter’s claims as moot because she \nhas not adequately pleaded any equal protection injury. We therefore AFFIRM the \ndismissal of Ms. Carpenter’s Complaint.

      "text": "Case 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 1 of 14\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF COLORADO \nSARA M. ROGERS, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nNo. _2_1_-_c_v_-1_7_7_9_________ \nTHOMAS J. VILSACK, in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, and \nZACH DUCHENEAUX, in his official  COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY \ncapacity as Administrator of the Farm Service  AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nAgency, \nDefendants. \nPlaintiff Sara M. Rogers is a Colorado farmer and the mother of two young children.  She \nand her husband Dewain farm and sell wheat, corn, and millet. Because she has no job other than \nfarming, her entire family’s income stems from the farm.  However, she is not covered by the \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act, signed in March 2021.  On the other hand, if she were a different \nrace—regardless of whether she was affected by COVID-19 or in fact needed loan forgiveness—\nthe federal government would automatically forgive her loan. \nMs. Rogers brings this complaint against Defendants Thomas J. Vilsack, Secretary of the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture, and Zach Ducheneaux, Administrator of the Farm \nService Agency (FSA), as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1. The Constitution requires that “all racial classifications imposed by government\nmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.”  Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, \n505 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every \ncontext, even  for so-called ‘benign’  racial classifications, such as race-conscious university \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 14\nadmissions policies, race-based preferences in government contracts, and race-based districting \nintended to improve minority representation.”  Id. at 505 (internal citations omitted).  \n2.  Equal  protection  under  the  law  is  the  cornerstone  of  modern-day  American \nconstitutional jurisprudence.  It is the principle etched into our nation and was “[p]urchased at the \nprice of immeasurable human suffering.”  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S. 200, 240 \n(1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).   \n3.  In March 2021, however, Congress opted to enshrine into law race classifications \nthat divide American citizens by skin color, and which are unmoored from any interest that the \ngovernment may have in remedying past discrimination.  \n4.  In  the  American  Rescue  Plan  Act  of  2021,  H.R.  1319,  117th  Cong.  (2021) \n(“ARPA”), Congress allotted billions of dollars in debt relief to “socially disadvantaged” farmers \nand ranchers.  The program will erase the debts of certain farmers and ranchers who took out loans, \nbut only for farmers or ranchers of certain races. \n5.  The program does so by providing a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the \noutstanding indebtedness, to remain available until expended, for the cost of loan modifications \nand payments under this section. \n6.  A “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” is defined by federal law, 7 U.S.C. § \n2279(a)(5), as “a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group.” \n7.  In turn, a “socially disadvantaged group” is a “group whose members have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without \nregard to their individual qualities.”  7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(6). \n8.  The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) interprets the phrase \n“socially disadvantaged group” to include explicit racial classifications.  Indeed, to be eligible for \nARPA’s debt relief, farmers and ranchers must be “Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, \nHispanic, or Asian, or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.”  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 14\nFAQ, at Question 1, at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq (last visited, May 23, \n2021).  \n9.  The  USDA  does  not  consider  Plaintiff  Sara  M.  Rogers  to  be  “socially \ndisadvantaged” under ARPA.  See id. at Question 1 (“Section 2501 [of the Food, Agriculture, \nConservation and Trade Act of 1990] does not include gender.  While some women may be eligible \n[for ARPA debt relief] due to their race or ethnicity, gender is not an eligible criterion in and of \nitself, based on the law enacted by Congress.”).  She is not considered to be a part of any of these \nracial categories and would generally be considered white or Caucasian. \n10.  Defendants are responsible for running this race-based loan-forgiveness program \nthrough the Farm Service Agency.  Defendants assert that the purpose of this program is to remedy \n“systemic racism” within USDA and more broadly “across agriculture.”  \n11.  The United States Constitution “forbids” discrimination by the federal government \n“against any citizen because of his race.”  Adarand, 515 U.S. at 216 (internal citations omitted).  \nWhen the government distributes “benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications,” as \nDefendants do in this case, the government bears the burden of meeting “strict scrutiny.”  In other \nwords, the government must prove that its discriminatory benefit is narrowly tailored and serves a \ncompelling government interest.  Id. at 227.  It cannot do so here. \n12.  Defendants’ use of race discrimination as a tool to end “systemic racism” is patently \nunconstitutional and should be enjoined by the Court.  Enjoining this discriminatory conduct will \npromote equal rights under the law for all American citizens and promote efforts to stop further \nracial discrimination because “[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop \ndiscriminating on the basis of race.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 \nU.S. 701, 748 (2007) (plurality opinion).  \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 14\nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff Sara M. Rogers owns a farm in Washington County, near Otis, in the \nDistrict of Colorado.  Ms. Rogers is a third generation Colorado farmer whose family started \nfarming in the area in 1965. In 2017, she took out an initial real estate loan from the FSA, which \nis covered under the terms of ARPA. In 2020, she took out a subsequent real estate loan from the \nFSA, which is also covered under the terms of ARPA. Ms. Rogers’ Promissory Notes name the \nFSA’s office located in Sterling, Colorado, as the payee for the USDA.  Ms. Rogers would be \neligible for the loan forgiveness program in Section 1005 of ARPA, and future FSA loans, except \nfor the fact that she is not a member of any of the racial groups that are eligible for loan forgiveness.  \n14.  Defendant Thomas J. Vilsack is the Secretary of Agriculture.  He is responsible for \nleading the USDA, which includes the FSA.  Under Section 1005 of ARPA, Defendant Vilsack is \nrequired to provide debt relief to certain farmers based on race. He is sued in his official capacity. \n15.  Defendant Zach Ducheneaux is the Administrator of the FSA.  Among other things, \nFSA oversees certain loan programs.  Under Section 1005 of ARPA, FSA will provide debt relief \nto certain farmers with direct loans or USDA-backed loans based on race.  He is sued in his official \ncapacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 \nbecause this case presents a substantial question of federal law, specifically whether Section 1005 \nof  ARPA—and  Defendants’  implementation  of  that  section—violates  the  United  States \nConstitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws. \n17.  This Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order injunctive \nrelief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n18.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  A substantial \npart of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district, Defendants maintain one or \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 14\nmore offices and employees in this district, a substantial part of the property subject to this action \nis situated in this district, and a plaintiff resides in this district.  \nMs. Rogers is a Farmer with Outstanding Debt on Two FSA Loans \n19.  Despite being the young mother of a 4-month-old and a two-and-a-half-year old, \nMs. Rogers continues to farm in Washington County, Colorado. \n20.  Ms. Rogers farms wheat, corn, and millet on her 320-acre farm, which has been in \nher family since 1965. Her farm is 100% dryland, meaning that the farm has no irrigation system \nand relies solely on the weather.  \n21.  Ms. Rogers has FSA loans and is otherwise eligible for the loan forgiveness \nprogram in Section 1005 of ARPA, except that her ancestors were of German and Dutch descent, \nand she is commonly considered white or Caucasian. \n22.  Under existing law, Ms. Rogers would be prohibited from obtaining further loans \nfrom the Department if she received any form of debt forgiveness on her FSA loans. \n23.  Ms. Rogers’ Promissory Notes contain the following statement, on Page 1: “In \naccordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights \nregulations  and  policies,  the  USDA,  its  Agencies,  offices,  and  employees,  and  institutions \nparticipating in or administering USDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on \nrace, color, national origin….” \nPresident Biden Signs the American Rescue Plan Act \n24.  On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed ARPA into law. \n25.  In a Rose Garden ceremony, President Biden emphasized that the $1.9 trillion in \nspending authorized by ARPA was necessary in response to COVID-19.  Biden said: “It directly \naddressed the emergency in this country.  Because it focuses on what people need most.”  See \nPresident Joe Biden on the American Rescue Plan and recovery, CNBC YouTube Channel, at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj2zCWetr1Y (Time Stamp 3:33). \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 14\n26.  In Section 1005 of ARPA, Congress appropriated “such sums as may be necessary” \nto pay for the cost of loan modifications and payments for “each socially disadvantaged farmer or \nrancher as of January 1, 2021.”  ARPA § 1005(a)(1)-(2). \n27.  Section  1005(a)  requires  Defendant  Vilsack  to  use  the  appropriated  funds  to \n“provide a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the outstanding indebtedness of each socially \ndisadvantaged farmer or rancher as of January 1, 2021.”  ARPA § 1005(a)(2). \n28.  A “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” has “indebtedness” if that farmer or \nrancher owes money on a “direct farm loan made by the Secretary” or a “farm loan guaranteed by \nthe Secretary.”  ARPA § 1005(a)(2)(A)-(B). \n29.  Finally, Section 1005(a)(3) states that “the term ‘socially disadvantaged famer or \nrancher’ has the meaning given in section 2501(a) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and \nTrade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)).” That Act defines “socially disadvantaged farmer or \nrancher” as “a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group.” 7 U.S.C. § \n2279(a)(5). “Socially disadvantaged group,” in turn, is defined as “a group whose members have \nbeen subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without \nregard to their individual qualities.”  7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(6). \n30.  Defendants Vilsack and Ducheneaux are responsible for the implementation of the \nloan forgiveness provisions in ARPA Section 1005.  \n31.  On March 25, 2021, Defendant Vilsack offered written testimony to the House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Agriculture.  See Opening Statement of Thomas J. Vilsack Before \nthe  House  Committee  on  Agriculture  –  Remarks  as  Prepared,  (March  25,  2021),  at \nhttps://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/03/25/opening-statement-thomas-j-vilsack-\nhouse-committee-agriculture (last visited, May 24, 2021). \n32.   Defendant  Vilsack  claimed  that  he  would  be  committed  to  rooting  out \ndiscrimination within the Department: “I am here today to say that racism and discrimination have \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 14\nno place at the Department of Agriculture.  I will not tolerate it, and I am committed to rooting it \nout and establishing a relationship with producers that is built on a commitment to equity, trust \nand customer service.”  But as the ARPA demonstrates, Vilsack’s claims were false. \n33.  On March 26, 2021, Defendant Ducheneaux authored a blog post detailing how \nFSA intends to implement Section 1005 of ARPA.  See Zach Ducheneaux, “American Rescue \nPlan  Socially  Disadvantaged  Farmer  Debt  Payments,”  (March  26,  2021),  at \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/connect/blog/loans-and-grants/american-rescue-plan-socially-\ndisadvantaged-farmer-debt-payments.    According  to  this  document:  “USDA  recognizes  that \nsocially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers have faced systemic discrimination with cumulative \neffects that have, among other consequences, led to a substantial loss in the number of socially \ndisadvantaged producers, reduced the amount of farmland they control, and contributed to a cycle \nof debt that was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.”  \n34.  Defendant Ducheneaux explained that through ARPA, FSA will provide “historic \ndebt relief to socially disadvantaged producers including Black/African American, American \nIndian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or Pacific Islander.” \n35.  According to Defendant Ducheneaux, “[a]ny socially disadvantaged borrower with \ndirect or guaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility Loans qualifies.” Defendant \nDucheneaux defines “socially disadvantaged” borrowers as only those borrowers “with direct or \nguaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility Loans” and who are members of one or \nmore of the following racial groups: “Black/African American, American Indian or Alaskan \nnative, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or Pacific Islander.”  \n36.  On  or  about  April  12,  2021,  USDA  updated  its  website  to  provide  further \ninformation about the payments under Section 1005 of ARPA.  The website confirms that only \ncertain farmers will be eligible based on race: “Eligible borrowers include those who identify as \none  or  more  of  the  following:  Black/African  American,  American  Indian,  Alaskan  native, \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 14\nHispanic/Latino, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.” See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments, \nat  https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan. \n37.  Although  public  officials  have  made  stray  comments  about  remedying  past \ndiscrimination committed by the Department of Agriculture, Defendant Vilsack made clear the \nreal reasons for ARPA’s race classifications: “[T]hese provisions recognized that on top of the \neconomic  pain  caused  by  the  pandemic’s  impact  on  the  economy  and  agriculture,  socially \ndisadvantaged farmers are also dealing with a disproportionate share of COVID infection rates, \nhospitalizations, death and economic hurt.”  See id. (“The law provides funding to address \nlongstanding racial equity issues within the Department and across agriculture.”) (emphasis \nadded). \n38.  To be clear, the program at issue does not target farmers or ranchers who suffered \neconomic pain during the COVID-19 crisis.  Nor does it target farmers or ranchers who contracted \nCOVID-19.  It does not even target farmers or ranchers who have suffered discrimination, much \nless at the hands of the Department of Agriculture.  Under the relevant provisions, it forgives the \nloans of farmers or ranchers whose race matches the race of a group whose members have suffered \ndiscrimination, per the Department.  (A farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially \ndisadvantaged group.)  As Secretary Vilsack stated in his testimony, part of his goal is to make it \nclear to Congress and the public “that prosperous farmers of color means a prosperous agricultural \nsector and a prosperous America.” \n39.  In fact, socially disadvantaged farmers who were previously successful claimants \nin class action settlements (e.g., Pigford, Keepseagle) and received debt forgiveness are eligible \nfor further debt forgiveness.  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at Question 3. \n40.  The USDA has stated that individuals who receive loan forgiveness under the \nARPA will be eligible for future FSA loans.  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at \nQuestion 29 at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 14\n41.  As for timing and process, it appears that USDA will soon be reaching out to begin \nproviding  payments  to  those  individuals  who  meet  the  racial  classifications,  based  on  the \ninformation in USDA’s files.  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at Question 9-10 \n(“Question 9: Do I need to apply or take any action to receive a debt payment? A. No action on \nyour part is needed right now.”); see id. at Question 10 (“Details of the process and your debt \npayment  will  be  reviewed  with  you  prior  to  final  processing.”)  at \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq.  \n42.  Upon information and belief, the USDA further instructs potential applicants who \nare “uncertain of [their] demographic designation on file at FSA” to call their local service center \nto verify their classification on record, and to update as needed. \n43.  Upon information and belief, on or about May 4, 2021, USDA sent correspondence \nto borrowers who have not previously designated details about their demographic information \nincluding race and ethnicity data, to “encourage” them to contact their local FSA Service center to \nupdate their demographic information in FSA records. \n44.  Beginning in the week of May 24, 2021 and continuing through June 2021, Direct \nLoan borrowers will receive a letter from FSA, outlining the payment they will receive, and that \nthey will need to sign and return it. Guaranteed Loan borrowers will be available within 120 days. \nSee American Rescue Plan Debt Payments, at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan. \n45.  The FSA will begin to process signed letters for payments in June.  About three \nweeks after a signed letter is received, qualified socially disadvantaged borrowers will receive 20% \nof their qualified debt by direct deposit which may be used for tax liabilities and other fees \nassociated with payment of the debt. Payments will be issued on a rolling basis. See American \nRescue Plan Debt Payments, https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan. \n46.  Defendants are currently implementing and will continue to implement Section \n1005 of ARPA to impose a race-based loan forgiveness program.  Defendants’ implementation \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 14\nincludes the expenditure of federal funds, and Defendants will begin processing letters for payment \nin June of 2021. \nInjury to Ms. Rogers \n47.  Plaintiff is a farmer who has FSA direct farm loans and is otherwise eligible for \nloan forgiveness under Section 1005 of ARPA.  \n48.  But because Plaintiff is white, she is ineligible for the loan forgiveness benefit \nunder Section 1005 of ARPA as administered by Defendants. \n49.  Were  Plaintiff  eligible  for  the  loan  forgiveness  benefit,  she  would  have  the \nopportunity to make additional investments in her property, expand her farm, purchase equipment \nand supplies, and otherwise support her family. Because Plaintiff is ineligible to receive loan \nforgiveness solely due to her race, she has been denied the equal protection of the laws and has \ntherefore suffered harm.  \n50.  Because Plaintiff is considered white, any other farm loan forgiveness she could \nobtain from USDA would not be up to 120% and would not cover tax liabilities. \n51.  If Plaintiff obtained any form of forgiveness of her loan, then she would not be \neligible for any future direct or guaranteed loans, or loan forgiveness on a direct loan, from the \nDepartment. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution) \n(Equal Protection Violation) \n52.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n53.  “[T]he moral imperative of racial neutrality is the driving force of the Equal \nProtection Clause, and racial classifications are permitted only as a last resort.”  Bartlett v. \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 14\nStrickland, 556 U.S. 1, 21 (2009).  “[A]ll racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, \nor local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.”  \nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 227.  “Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving that \nracial  classifications  are  narrowly  tailored  measures  that  further  compelling  governmental \ninterests.” Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. at 505.  When the government invokes an interest as \nmeeting strict scrutiny, the court must closely examine how the government has gone about \nsatisfying that interest.  Fisher v. Univ. of Texas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 299 (2013) (“Strict \nscrutiny does not permit a court to accept a school’s assertion that its admissions process uses race \nin a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice.”). \n54.  “The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains \nwithin it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.”  United \nStates v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013). \n55.  Section 1005 of ARPA imposes racial classifications.  Farmers or ranchers with \ndirect  farm  loans,  guaranteed  farm  loans,  or  Farm  Storage  Facility  Loans  qualify  for  loan \nforgiveness only if they are members of one of the following racial groups: Black/African \nAmerican, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, or Asian American or Pacific \nIslander. \n56.  Defendants are responsible for interpreting and implementing Section 1005 of \nARPA. \n57.  Although Plaintiff is a farmer with direct FSA loans, and otherwise eligible for the \nloan forgiveness program under Section 1005 of ARPA, she is ineligible for this federal benefit \nbecause she is white. \n58.  Plaintiff  is  harmed  by  the  Defendants’  racial  classifications  because,  but  for \nPlaintiff’s skin color, she would be receiving up to 120% of the value of her outstanding debt and \nshe would use that money to benefit her farm and family. \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 14\n59.  The racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA do not satisfy strict scrutiny.   \nThere is no compelling interest in providing subsidies by scattershot to farmers and ranchers \nsimply on the basis of their membership in a racial group.   \n60.  Remedying societal discrimination does not constitute a compelling interest under \nthe Fifth Amendment’s equal protection principles. Fisher, 570 U.S. at 318 (permitting such an \ninterest would have “no logical stopping point”). \n61.  Nor is Section 1005 narrowly tailored, since it is both underinclusive—it does not \nprovide relief to white or Caucasian farmers who have contracted COVID-19 or suffered due to \nCOVID-19—and  overinclusive—it  includes  farmers  or  ranchers  who  may  meet  the  racial \nqualifications, but who have not contracted COVID-19, suffered uniquely due to COVID-19, or \nsuffered discrimination on any basis.   \n62.  Because the racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA are not narrowly \ntailored to serve a compelling government interest, they cannot survive strict scrutiny. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Illegally Allowing Future Eligibility) \n63.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n64.  Prior to the enactment of ARPA, the Department was prohibited, by statute, from \nproviding future loans to persons who receive forgiveness of a direct or guaranteed loan, except in \nnarrowly specified circumstances.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(b). \n65.  Prior to the enactment of ARPA, the Department was prohibited, by statute, from \nproviding debt forgiveness on a direct loan to any person who had previously received debt \nforgiveness.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(c). \n66.  As ARPA was originally proposed, Section 1005 provided that the provision of a \npayment under paragraph (2) to a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher shall not affect the \n12 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 14\neligibility of such farmer or rancher for a farm loan after the date on which the payment is provided.  \nSee American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, 117 H.R. 1319, 2021 H.R. 1319, 117 H.R. 1319, Title I, \n§ 1005(3)  (“EFFECT ON ELIGIBILITY.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nprovision of a payment under paragraph (2) to a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher shall not \naffect the eligibility of such farmer or rancher for a farm loan after the date on which the payment \nis provided.”) (proposed language).  \n67.  This provision did not make it into Section 1005 as enacted. \n68.  Yet on or about May 21, 2021, citing no statutory authority, the Department stated, \nipse dixit, on its website that persons who receive loan forgiveness under ARPA will be eligible \nfor  future  FSA  loans.    See  American  Rescue  Plan  Debt  Payments  FAQ,  at  Question  29 \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq.  \n69.  Because the Department has no authority to treat anyone who received loan \nforgiveness as eligible for future loans, but has said that it will do so anyway, it will be acting \nunlawfully. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  \nA.  Enter a declaratory judgment that the racial classifications under Section 1005 of \nARPA are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection principles of the Fifth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution. \nB.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Plaintiff is eligible to receive loan forgiveness \npursuant to ARPA. \nC.  Enter a declaratory judgment that providing further loans to those who receive loan \nforgiveness is illegal. \n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01779   Document 1   Filed 06/29/21   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of 14\nD.  Enter  an  order  permanently  enjoining  Defendants  from  applying  racial \nclassifications when determining eligibility for loan modifications and payments under Section \n1005 of ARPA.  \nE.  Enter an order permanently enjoining Defendants from declaring Plaintiff ineligible \nfor future FSA loan participation, to the extent that such participation is permitted for recipients \nof ARPA relief. \nF.  In the alternative, enjoin Defendants from enforcing Section 1005 of ARPA in its \nentirety and enjoin Defendants from distributing loan assistance under Section 1005 to farmers \nand ranchers. \nG.  Enter an award for nominal damages of $1.00. \nH.  Award Plaintiff such costs and attorney fees as allowed by law; and \nI.  Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems appropriate. \n \nDATED this 29th day of June, 2021. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Corey C. Bartkus       \nCorey C.
