ARPA was a large package of government programs aimed at combatting COVID-19 and stimulating the economy. Sections 1005 and 1006 of the ARPA directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Farm Services Agency (FSA) to forgive loans made to &ldquo;socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers.&rdquo; 7 U.S.C. &sect; 2279(a)(6) defines socially disadvantaged to mean &ldquo;subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without regard to their individual qualities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2021, a white Tennessee farmer filed this lawsuit challenging Sections 1005 and 1006 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee&rsquo;s Eastern Division. He alleged that the socially disadvantaged group category was a racial classification and its inclusion in the ARPA denied him government benefits because of his race. The plaintiff claimed that this policy violated the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment. (The Supreme Court held in <em>Bolling v. Shape</em>, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), that this provision applies the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s Equal Protection clause to the federal government through reverse incorporation.) He requested that the court grant declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and nominal damages of $1.00.</p>\r\n<p>After the case was filed, it was assigned to Chief District Judge S. Thomas Anderson. The plaintiff was represented by attorneys from the Southeastern Legal Foundation and the Mountain States Legal Foundation, who have filed similar cases in other courts, including: <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18252\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carpenter v. Vilsack</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rogers v. Vilsack</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after filing, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing in late June, Judge Anderson granted the plaintiff&rsquo;s motion in a July 8, 2021 order and enjoined the loan forgiveness payments in question. 2021 WL 2877915. He found that the plaintiff had shown a substantial likelihood on his claim that Section 1005 of the ARPA violated his Equal Projection rights. In his opinion, Judge Anderson noted several other challenges to the ARPA where courts had reached similar results: <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vitolo v. Guzman</a></em> (999 F.3d 353), <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18166\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Faust v. Vilsack</a></em> (519 F.Supp.3d 470), <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wynn v. Vilsack</a></em> (2021 WL 2580678), and <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18120\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miller v. Vilsack</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>The USDA and the FSA then moved to stay the case while other challenges to Section 1005 were litigated. Their main complaint was the <em>Miller</em>, where a Texas federal court had enjoined the implementation of the statute and certified classes of farmers and ranchers who might have been entitled to ARPA benefits. Judge Anderson denied that motion in an August 2, 2021 order. 2021 WL 3354169. He reasoned that the Sixth Circuit opinion in <em>Vitolo</em>, where the court of appeals had enjoined a similar program administered by the Small Business Administration, was binding precedent in his court, but not binding in Texas. He also noted that there were differences between claims made by this plaintiff and the plaintiffs in <em>Miller</em>.</p>\r\n<p>After Judge Anderson stayed litigation in <em><a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18172\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joyner v. Vilsack</a></em>, another challenge to Section 1005 filed in Tennessee, the government moved for reconsideration of his previous decision not to stay this case. In an order on October 22, 2021, Judge Anderson partially granted that motion and stayed discovery until he could decide a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants.</p>\r\n<p>On January 26, 2022, the court granted the defendant's motion for partial dismissal. Specifically, Judge Anderson dismissed the second and third claims of the complaint, which alleged that the USDA's plan to allow farmers who had loans forgiven under Section 1005 to later apply for future loans violated equal protection. The court held that the plaintiff had failed to show standing to bring these claims and that the claims were not ripe for judicial review. The judge also denied the plaintiff&rsquo;s request for leave to amend. 582 F.Supp.3d 568.</p>\r\n<p>On February 1, 2022, the defendants filed a renewed motion to stay this case while <em>Miller </em>was pending; Judge Anderson granted the motion on February 16, 2022. On September 6, 2022, the defendants filed a notice that Section 1005 of the ARPA had been repealed, which mooted the case. On September 14, 2022, the parties submitted a joint stipulation of dismissal, and the case was dismissed the following day.</p>\r\n<p>On September 29, 2022, the plaintiff filed a motion for attorney fees and costs. On April 4, 2023, the court denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party under the Equal Access to Justice Act (&ldquo;EAJA&rdquo;). 2023 WL 2776733. The plaintiff appealed this decision. On September 23, 2024, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court&rsquo;s denial of attorney fees. The Sixth Circuit declined to rule on the \"prevailing party\" question but found that no attorneys' fees were warranted under the EAJA because the government's position was substantially justified. 117 F.4th 906. On February 3, 2025, the Sixth Circuit also denied the plaintiff&rsquo;s petition for rehearing en banc. 127 F.4th 660.</p>\r\n<p>As of March 6, 2025, there has been no further activity in the case.&nbsp;</p>",

Page 2 \n \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nJANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge.  This appeal concerns a litigant’s petition for fees \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).  Plaintiff Robert Holman successfully obtained a \npreliminary injunction freezing a debt-relief program that used racial categories to remedy prior \ndiscrimination against farmers and ranchers.  Following additional proceedings, but before final \njudgment, Congress repealed the challenged program.  Holman now seeks fees associated with \nthe litigation.  The district court denied that request because, in its view, Holman was not a \n“prevailing party” under the EAJA.  We neither adopt nor definitively reject that conclusion.  \nInstead, we find that the Government’s position during the litigation was “substantially justified” \nwithin the EAJA’s meaning.  On that basis, we AFFIRM the judgment below.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \nIn March 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, which \nprovided various forms of emergency assistance in the COVID-19 pandemic’s wake.  Section \n1005 of the Act was a debt-relief program for “socially disadvantaged” farmers and ranchers.  It \nauthorized  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture  to  pay  to  Black,  American  Indian/Alaskan  Native, \nHispanic, Asian, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander farmers and ranchers up to 120 percent of certain \nfarm loans previously issued by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The \ncongressional record explains that the legislation was designed to provide targeted relief for \nfarmers against whom the USDA had historically discriminated and for whom prior pandemic \nrelief efforts had failed.      \nA number of challenges to Section 1005 were filed.  In Tennessee, farmer Robert Holman \nfiled a complaint and motion to preliminarily enjoin the program in early June 2021, alleging \nthat he  would  have  been  eligible  for  Section  1005’s  benefits  but  for  his  race.    His \npreliminary injunction motion argued that Section 1005 should be halted nationwide because \nDefendants—heads of the USDA and its subagency the Farm Service Agency, collectively the \nGovernment—could not satisfy the strict scrutiny applied to racial classifications under the Fifth \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 3\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 3 \n \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause and because other injunction-related factors favored his \nposition.  The Government agreed that strict scrutiny applied, but contended that Section 1005 \nwas  nonetheless  constitutional  and  that  other  considerations  weighed  against  issuing  an \ninjunction.   \nMeanwhile, similar litigation was proceeding in other courts.  On June 10, 2021, a district \ncourt in Wisconsin entered a temporary restraining order barring the USDA from forgiving any \nloans pursuant to Section 1005.  Faust v. Vilsack, 519 F. Supp. 3d 470, 478 (E.D. Wis. 2021).  \nOn June 23, a Florida district court preliminarily enjoined Section 1005 nationwide.  Wynn \nv. Vilsack, 545 F. Supp. 3d 1271, 1295 (M.D. Fla. 2021).  And on July 1, a district court in Texas \nboth enjoined the Government from considering race under Section 1005 and certified a class \naction of all farmers and ranchers excluded from Section 1005 by the “socially disadvantaged” \ncriterion.  Miller v. Vilsack, No. 4:21-cv-0595-O, 2021 WL 11115194, at *3, 12 (N.D. Tex. \nJuly 1, 2021). \nThe district court granted Holman’s preliminary injunction motion on July 8, 2021.  It \nreasoned that the Government had failed to make the strict scrutiny showing that Section 1005 \nwas narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  The district court further \nexplained its view that an injunction was necessary to protect Holman from irreparable injury \nand that the public interest weighed in favor of injunctive relief, but also acknowledged that an \ninjunction could cause substantial harm to others—namely, socially disadvantaged farmers who \nsought access to Section 1005’s funds.  Finally, despite expressing reservations about issuing a \nnationwide injunction, the court found that alternative relief would be unworkable and enjoined \nthe Government from implementing Section 1005 in its entirety.   \nOn January 26, 2022, the district court granted the Government’s motion to dismiss \ncounts two and three of Holman’s complaint, in which Holman had argued that the USDA \nplanned to illegally make Section 1005 funding recipients eligible for future relief programs.  \nThe  Government  contended  that  with  these  counts  dismissed,  Holman’s  case  presented \nmaterially identical issues to the Texas class action litigation where Holman was necessarily a \nclass member, so a stay of Holman’s case was necessary to prevent inconsistent rulings.  On \nFebruary 16, the district court granted the Government’s stay motion.   \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 4\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 4 \n \nHalf a year later, with this case still stayed, the Inflation Reduction Act became law and \nrepealed  Section  1005.    The  parties  agreed  that  Section  1005’s  repeal  mooted  Holman’s \nchallenge and, accordingly, stipulated to the case’s dismissal.  Holman then moved for fees and \ncosts as a “prevailing party” under the EAJA.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  The district court \ndenied the motion, reasoning that because the “temporary and revocable” nature of the injunctive \nrelief previously awarded to Holman provided him “with nothing lasting,” Holman was not a \nprevailing party within the EAJA’s meaning.  Holman timely appealed.   \nII.  ANALYSIS \nThe EAJA modifies the American legal system’s default rule “that each party pays its \nown costs and attorney’s fees.”  Griffith v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 987 F.3d 556, 563 (6th Cir. \n2021).  Under the EAJA, a “prevailing party” in a civil case against the United States is entitled \nto “fees and other expenses” and certain “costs” unless “the position of the United States was \nsubstantially  justified”  or  “special  circumstances  make  an  award  unjust.”    28  U.S.C. \n§ 2412(d)(1)(A).  The parties dispute all three aspects of § 2412(d)(1)(A)—whether (1) Holman \nwas a prevailing party, (2) the Government’s litigating position was substantially justified, and \n(3) special circumstances otherwise preclude a fees award.  Finding the first two issues sufficient \nto resolve the case, we take them up in turn.1 \nA.  Prevailing Party \nWe review a plaintiff’s entitlement to prevailing party status de novo.  Miller v. Caudill, \n936 F.3d 442, 448 (6th Cir. 2019).  To be a prevailing party, “a plaintiff must have ‘been \nawarded some relief by the court.’”  Tenn. State Conf. of NAACP v. Hargett, 53 F. 4th 406, \n410 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health \n& Hum. Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001)).2  Beyond that baseline requirement, whether a claimant \n \n1Although the district court’s conclusion that Holman was not a prevailing party meant that it did not reach \nthe substantial-justification or exceptional-circumstances issues, both parties have had a “full and fair opportunity to \naddress” these questions and urge us to reach them as necessary.  Smith v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Sch. Comm’rs, \n641 F.3d 197, 205 (6th Cir. 2011).   \n2As the district court recognized, interpretations of the phrase “prevailing party” in cases involving \n42 U.S.C. § 1988 and the EAJA are equally applicable to both statutes.  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 \nn.7 (1983) (“The standards set forth in this opinion [concerning § 1988 fee awards] are generally applicable in all \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 5\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 5 \n \nwho “prevails in one sense (by receiving a preliminary injunction) but not in another sense (by \nfailing to obtain a final judgment when the case becomes moot)” is entitled to prevailing party \nstatus “requires a ‘contextual and case-specific’ response.”  Roberts v. Neace, 65 F.4th 280, \n284 (6th  Cir.  2023)  (quoting  McQueary  v.  Conway,  614  F.3d  591,  604  (6th  Cir.  2010)).  \nGenerally, preliminary injunctions alone are insufficient to show that a party prevailed within the \nEAJA’s meaning.  Id.  “But a preliminary injunction may well suffice if it mainly turns on the \nlikelihood-of-success inquiry and changes the parties’ relationship in a material and enduring \nway.”  Id. \nBoth parties present weighty arguments on this question.  The Government contends that \nbecause  orders  entered  by  other  courts  had  already  halted  Section  1005’s  implementation \nnationwide, see, e.g., Wynn, 545 F. Supp. 3d at 1295, the injunction in this case did not “directly \nbenefit the ‘plaintiff by modifying the defendant’s behavior toward him’” and was accordingly \nnot “material.”  Hargett, 53 F.4th at 410 (quoting McQueary, 614 F.3d at 598 (cleaned up)).  It \nfurther argues that Holman’s relief was not “enduring” because it gave him no “irrevocable” \nbenefit; both before and after the injunction, Holman could not access Section 1005’s funds.  The \ndistrict court agreed that Holman was not a prevailing party, largely focusing on his failure to \nobtain irrevocable relief.   \nHolman notes, however, that several relevant considerations point in his direction.  For \nexample, there is no question that the district court’s preliminary injunction opinion mainly \nturned “on the likelihood-of-success inquiry.”  Roberts, 65 F.4th at 284.  Further, we have \npreviously explained that in determining “whether a claimant directly benefitted from litigation, \nwe usually measure the plaintiff’s gain based on the relief requested in his complaint, not based \non the practical significance of the relief obtained.”  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 602.  This reasoning \nsuggests  that  the  preliminary  injunction,  which  granted  Holman  the  relief  requested  in  his \nmotion, may have been material even though—because of the previously issued injunctions—it \ndid not require the Government to immediately change its behavior.   \n \ncases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a ‘prevailing party.’”); Bryant v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., \n578 F.3d 443, 449 (6th Cir. 2009).   \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 6\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 6 \n \nAs for whether his relief was enduring, Holman observes that the thirteen-month-long \ninjunction here was in place longer than in several cases in which the plaintiff was deemed \nthe prevailing party.  See, e.g., G.S. ex rel. Schwaigert v. Lee, No. 22-5969, 2023 WL 5205179, \nat *6 (6th Cir. Aug. 14, 2023) (finding an injunction lasting as little as two-to-six months \nsufficiently lengthy to qualify a plaintiff as a prevailing party); Hargett, 53 F.4th at 410-11 \n(same as to an injunction that lasted seven months).  The injunction’s “nature,” moreover, was \nnot “ill-considered, hastily entered, or tentative”—it neither “maintain[ed] the status quo without \naddressing the merits” nor was “later overturned, repudiated, or vacated.”  Roberts, 65 F.4th at \n284.  Finally, Holman contends that the injunction did provide irrevocable relief by preventing \nthe harm caused each day by Section 1005:  his “inability to compete on equal footing” with \nothers for funding.  Ne. Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. Jacksonville, \n508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).   \nDetermining “whether or when the winner of a preliminary injunction may be treated as a \n‘prevailing party’” is always a “thorny” undertaking.  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 596.  Considering \nthe  record  and  both  parties’  substantial  arguments,  we  conclude  only  that  determining  a \nplaintiff’s  prevailing  party  status  is  particularly  fraught  where,  as  here,  he  succeeds  in \npreliminarily enjoining a statute or rule but cannot use that injunction to take any specific action.  \nWe instead resolve the issue of Holman’s entitlement to EAJA fees on a clearer ground:  whether \nthe Government’s litigating position was substantially justified.   \nB.  Substantial Justification \nEven if a litigant is a prevailing party under the EAJA, he is not entitled to fees if “the \nposition of the United States was substantially justified.”  28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d)(1)(A).  The \nGovernment bears the burden of demonstrating substantial justification, Griffith, 987 F.3d at 563, \nwhich  requires  the  position  to  “be  ‘more  than  merely  undeserving  of  sanctions  for \nfrivolousness,’” id. (quoting Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988)).  But it need not \nrepresent a winning argument.  Id.  Instead, the position need only be “justified to a degree \nthat could satisfy a reasonable person” such that “a reasonable person could think it correct.”  \nId. (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 565, 566 n.2).   \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 7\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 7 \n \nWhat “matter[s] most” to the substantial justification analysis is “the actual merits of the \nGovernment’s litigating position.”  Id. (quoting United States ex rel. Wall v. Circle C. Constr., \nLLC, 868 F.3d 466, 471 (6th Cir. 2017)).  The merits of that position are considered “as a \nwhole.” Id. at 564 (quoting Amezola-Garcia v. Lynch, 835 F.3d 553, 555 (6th Cir. 2016)); see \nalso Comm’r, Immigr. & Naturalization Serv. v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 160 (1990) (noting that the \nsubstantial  justification  inquiry  considers  the  entire  litigation  and  “operates  as  a  one-time \nthreshold for fee eligibility”).  In doing so, we recognize the difference “between cases in which \n‘the government lost because it vainly pressed a position flatly at odds with the controlling case \nlaw’  and  cases  in  which  ‘the  government  lost  because  an  unsettled  question  was  resolved \nunfavorably.’”  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting Taucher v. Brown-Hruska, 396 F.3d 1168, \n1174 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nIn addition to the merits of the Government’s position, other “‘objective indicia’ of \nreasonableness” may be relevant, though not dispositive.  Id. at 563 (quoting Wall, 868 F.3d at \n471).  These indicia include whether the Government’s position follows a string of losses or \nsuccesses,  id.,  as  well  as  “the  stage  at  which  the  proceedings  were  resolved,”  Dvorkin \nv. Gonzales, 173 F. App’x 420, 424 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. 2323 Charms Road, \n946 F.2d 437, 440 (6th Cir. 1991)).   \nAs an initial matter, the Government urges us to adopt a presumption that its position is \nsubstantially justified whenever it defends a federal statute.  That presumption, the Government \nargues, flows from its “duty to defend the constitutionality of statutes whenever reasonable \narguments can be made in their defense.”  But the EAJA directs the court to examine the \njustification for the Government’s “position,” not its conduct.  28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  At \nbest, therefore, the Government’s duty to defend Section 1005 “explains . . . why [it] took the \nposition it did,” but it does not answer the “question under [the] EAJA” of “whether that position \nwas  substantially  justified.”    Taucher,  396  F.3d  at  1175  (Roberts,  J.).    The  Government’s \nclaimed presumption, moreover, could effectively insulate it from liability even when defending \nunreasonable positions—a result fundamentally at odds with the EAJA’s “specific purpose” of \neliminating  “for  the  average  person  the  financial  disincentive  to  challenge  unreasonable \ngovernmental actions.”  Jean, 496 U.S. at 163.  As a result, though we need not deem the \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 8\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 8 \n \nGovernment’s duty to defend irrelevant in every substantial-justification inquiry, we decline to \nadopt a presumption that the Government is substantially justified anytime it defends a federal \nstatute.   \nInstead,  we  return  to  the  considerations  outlined  in  our  caselaw,  starting  with  the \nGovernment’s merits position during the central aspect of this litigation:  that the district court \nshould not preliminarily enjoin Section 1005.  It was Holman’s burden as the movant to “present \n‘a clear showing’” that the injunctive-relief factors weighed in his favor.  L.W. ex rel. Williams \nv. Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 471 (6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  Considered within the EAJA’s framework, this burden means that the \nGovernment’s position was substantially justified “if ‘a reasonable person could think it correct’” \nthat Holman had not made the requisite clear showing of likely success necessary to receive \ninjunctive relief.  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 563 (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2).   \nThe first issue in Holman’s preliminary injunction motion—the likelihood of success on \nthe merits—turned on the constitutionality of Section 1005’s relief for socially disadvantaged \nfarmers.  Like all programs that differentiate based on race, Section 1005 was subject to strict \nscrutiny.  Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 310 (2013); Grutter v. Bollinger, \n539 U.S. 306, 326-27 (2003); Vitolo v. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 360 (6th Cir. 2021).  The \nGovernment  therefore  had  to  show  that  the  program  was  narrowly  tailored  to  further  a \ncompelling  governmental  interest.    Fisher,  570  U.S.  at  310.    Holman  misapprehends  this \nstandard  by  positing  that  the  Government  was  required  to  “present  evidence  of  current, \nintentional discrimination when seeking to uphold a racial preference scheme.”  To the contrary, \nremedying the effects  of past  discrimination  constitutes a compelling governmental interest \nwhere the remedial policy targets specific episodes of past discrimination and there is evidence \nthat the Government intentionally participated in that discrimination.  Vitolo, 99 F.3d at 361; see \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabik, 214 F.3d 730, 735 (6th Cir. 2000) (“There \nis  no  question  that  remedying  the  effects  of  past  discrimination  constitutes  a  compelling \ngovernmental interest.”); Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 9\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 9 \n \n701, 720 (2007).3  Narrow tailoring, in turn, requires the Government to show “serious, good \nfaith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives,” but “does not require exhaustion of \nevery conceivable” alternative.  Fisher, 570 U.S. at 312 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339) \n(emphasis omitted).   \nAcknowledging the high bar set by strict scrutiny, the Government presented substantial \nrecord evidence to defend the program’s constitutionality.  Some of the Government’s evidence \nregarding  its  compelling  interest  addressed  past  discrimination  against  minority  groups \ngenerally.  For example, a 1997 report contained evidence that the USDA had “done more to hurt \nthan to help small and minority farmers” because many minority farmers’ loan applications and \ndiscrimination complaints languished within the Agency.  A 2011 Civil Rights Assessment \n“substantiated” continued “claims of denial of equal program access” by minority applicants and \nsuggested the existence of “continuing institutional discrimination” by the Agency.  And a 2019 \ngovernmental report explained that “allegations of unlawful discrimination against [socially \ndisadvantaged farmers and ranchers] in the management of USDA programs are long-standing \nand well-documented.”  These reports represent evidence of past discrimination by the USDA \nagainst socially disadvantaged farmers generally.  \nBuilding on that evidence, the Government also provided examples of past discrimination \nby the USDA against many specific groups.  As detailed in governmental reports and federal \nlitigation terminating in substantial settlements, the USDA had a history of dealing reluctantly \nwith and denying loans to Black farmers; loans that were issued, moreover, were often provided \nat unfavorable times or contained burdensome requirements not imposed on non-Black farmers.  \nHispanic farmers stated that they had been “stereotyped as being farm workers, rather than \nowners,” and received “inconsistent or incomplete” information from the USDA; one farmer said \nHispanic growers had been “systematically excluded” from USDA programs.  Asian farmers \nwere among those who alleged in the late 1990s that the USDA had hurt rather than helped \n \n3Though  cases  decided  after  the  Government  articulated  its  position  do  not  affect  the  substantial-\njustification analysis, see Griffith, 987 F.3d at 565-66, we observe that the Supreme Court has recently reiterated that \nremedying past intentional discrimination constitutes a compelling interest.  See Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. \nv. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 207 (2023) (specifying that “remediating specific, identified \ninstances of past discrimination that violated the Constitution or a statute” is a compelling interest).    \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 10\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 10 \n \nminority farmers, and some reported in 2011 “a general consensus . . . that they are not always \ntreated  fairly  by  the  USDA.”    And  in  2019,  Native  American  farmers  reported  that \n“discrimination [has] contribute[d] to the lack of commercial lending on tribal lands”; similar \nallegations resulted in a large settlement between the USDA and Native farmers and ranchers.   \nFinally, to support its argument that Section 1005 was narrowly tailored to addressing the \ncompelling interest in remedying this identified past discrimination, the Government pointed to \n“the inefficacy of the race-neutral alternatives that Congress tried for years before enacting \n§ 1005”, the time-limited nature of the Section 1005’s relief, and the administrative difficulty of \nquickly administering relief to minority farmers disproportionately harmed by the pandemic.  \nIn short, the Government placed before the district court a “strong basis in evidence \nfor its conclusion that remedial action” in the form of Section 1005 “was necessary.”  Drabik, \n214 F.3d at 735 (quoting City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 500 (1989)).  It \npointed to “specific episode[s] of past discrimination” against socially disadvantaged farmers \nand ranchers, statistical and anecdotal “evidence to establish intentional discrimination,” and \nexamples of the USDA’s role in “the past discrimination it now seeks to remedy.”  Vitolo, \n999 F.3d at 361.  Finally, it explained Congress’s view as to why “race-neutral alternatives”—\nsome  of  which  had  already  been  tried,  and  others  of  which  were  impractical—constituted \ninsufficient remedies.  Fisher, 570 U.S. at 312 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339). \nIn  granting  a  preliminary  injunction,  the  district  court  ultimately  rejected  these \narguments.  In doing so, it rightly recognized the difficulty of satisfying strict scrutiny and \nevaluated  an  issue—when  and  how  the  Government  may  permissibly  act  to  remedy  past \ndiscrimination—that was “controversial, thorny, and unsettled” at the time and remains so today.  \nVitolo, 999 F.3d at 366 (Donald, J., dissenting).  That thorniness flows in part from the legal tests \nin this area of the law, many of which are matters of degree rather than cleanly drawn lines.  For \nexample, when do statistical disparities between racial groups, which may be insufficient by \nthemselves  to  show  intentional  discrimination,  nonetheless  represent  sufficiently  probative \n“evidence [of] intentional discrimination” that a court may infer intent?  See id. at 361.  And how \nmany options must the Government evaluate to show a “serious, good faith consideration of \nrace-neutral alternatives?”  See Fisher, 570 U.S. at 312 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339).  That \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 11\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 11 \n \nthoughtful judges could, on this record, readily reach different answers on these and other \nquestions  suggests  that  the  Government  “lost  because  an  unsettled  question  was  resolved \nunfavorably,” not because it “vainly pressed a position flatly at odds with the controlling case \nlaw.”  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting Taucher, 396 F.3d at 1173) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nThe dissent concludes otherwise primarily by relying on Vitolo, which explained that a \nrace-conscious  program  is  unconstitutional  where  the  Government  provides  “little  evidence \nof past  intentional  discrimination  against  the  many  groups  to  whom  it  grants  preferences.”  \n999 F.3d  at  361.    But  here,  as  chronicled  above,  the  Government  provided  evidence  of \nintentional USDA discrimination against socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers generally, \nand buttressed that evidence with specific examples of intentional discrimination against nearly \nevery group included in the socially disadvantaged category.  That is categorically distinct from \nthe  evidentiary  presentation  in  Vitolo,  which  did  “not  identify  specific  incidents  of  past \ndiscrimination” and relied entirely on “general social disparities.”  Id. at 361-62.  Nor is this a \ncase in which the Government provided “absolutely no evidence of past discrimination” against \nmost of the categories included in a race-conscious program.  J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at \n506 (emphasis  removed).    The  notion  that  the  Government  was  clearly  required,  at  the \npreliminary injunction stage, to provide specific examples of intentional discrimination against \nevery category included in a race-conscious program is also difficult to square with the Supreme \nCourt’s instruction that narrow tailoring does not demand perfection.  See Fisher, 570 U.S. at \n312; Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339; accord J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 510 (holding that “evidence \nof a pattern of individual discriminatory acts can, if supported by appropriate statistical proof, \nlend support to a . . . government’s determination that broader remedial relief is justified.”).  It \nwas Holman’s duty to make a clear showing of likely success on the merits, Skrmetti, 83 F.4th at \n471—but here, “a reasonable person could think” that the Government’s evidence supporting \nSection 1005’s constitutionality sufficiently undermined Holman’s required showing.  Pierce, \n487 U.S. at 566 n.2.  As a result, the Government’s position on this aspect of the litigation was \nsubstantially justified. \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 12\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 12 \n \nGoverning precedent, moreover, requires us to consider the entirety of the Government’s \n“arguments  made  during  litigation”  in  determining  whether  its  “whole  position”  was \nsubstantially  justified.    Id.    And  other  aspects  of  the  litigation,  not  addressed  by  the \ndissent, reinforce the reasonableness of the Government’s position “as a whole.”  Id. (quoting \nAmezola-Garcia,  835  F.3d  at  555).    In  opposing  the  injunction  motion,  for  instance,  the \nGovernment contended that the injunctions against Section 1005 already issued by other courts \neliminated the threat of irreparable harm to Holman.  Although the district court rejected this \nargument, some courts have “concluded that once another district court has entered the same \nrelief” sought by a plaintiff, that plaintiff is “no longer able to demonstrate the irreparable harm \nthat [is] needed to justify the extraordinary relief requested” by a preliminary injunction.  Faust \nv. Vilsack, No. 21-C-548, 2021 WL 2806204, at *3 (E.D. Wis. July 6, 2021) (collecting cases).  \nIt was not unreasonable for the Government to raise this argument against Holman’s motion. \nThe Government also won a later motion to dismiss the second and third counts of \nHolman’s complaint, which encompassed his claims that the USDA was planning to illegally \nmake Section 1005 funding recipients eligible for future debt relief.  This aspect of the litigation \nwas  less  “prominent”  than  the  preliminary  injunction  motion,  through  which  Holman \nsuccessfully enjoined Section 1005.  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting EEOC v. Memphis Health \nCtr., 526 F. App’x 607, 615 (6th Cir. 2013)).  Nonetheless, this part of the Government’s \nposition was not only reasonable but ultimately meritorious. \nHolman observes that before the district court decided the preliminary injunction motion, \nthe  Government  had  already  suffered  a  “string  of  losses”  in  other  courts,  which  “can  be \nindicative” of the unreasonableness of the Government’s position.  Pierce, 487 U.S. at 569.  But \nthis and other “objective indicia” of the Government’s position, while “relevant,” matter less \nthan “the actual merits of the Government’s litigating position”—a position that, as shown \nabove, was substantially justified.  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 563 (quoting Wall, 868 F.3d at 471).  \nAnd other objective criteria support the Government’s position, including “the stage in which the \nproceedings  were  resolved.”    Dvorkin,  173  F.  App’x  at  424  (quoting  2323  Charms  Road, \n946 F.2d at 440).  Because each of the decisions concerning Section 1005 were issued in a \npreliminary posture, no court had definitively deemed the program unconstitutional.  Thus, not \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 13\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 13 \n \nonly do those decisions matter less than the actual merits of the Government’s litigating position, \nbut their import is lessened by their posture.  \nIn  sum,  the  Government  took  positions  throughout  this  litigation  that  recognized \ngoverning precedent and attempted to satisfy it through the presentation of extensive evidence.  \nThough  these  arguments  did  not  convince  the  district  court  to  deny  Holman’s  preliminary \ninjunction motion, “a reasonable person could think [them] correct.”   Griffith, 987 F.3d at \n563 (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2).  As a result, the Government has demonstrated that its \nposition was substantially justified which, in turn, precludes Holman’s entitlement to attorney’s \nfees and expenses.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d)(1)(A).   \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.    \n   \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 14\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 14 \n \n_________________ \nDISSENT \n_________________ \nLARSEN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  A “prevailing party” in a civil case against the \nUnited States is entitled to fees and costs unless the government’s position was “substantially \njustified” or “special circumstances make an award unjust.”  So, to get fees and costs, Holman \nmust show that he is a prevailing party.  Even if he does, though, the government may avoid \npaying if it shows that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make \nan award unjust.  The majority, rightly recognizing that the prevailing-party issue is difficult, \ninstead concludes that the government’s position was substantially justified.  I cannot agree.  \nI first explain that disagreement and then tackle the more difficult question of whether Holman is \na prevailing party.  I then address the special-circumstances question.  I conclude that Holman is \na  prevailing  party  because  the  preliminary  injunction  in  this  case  turned  primarily  on  the \nlikelihood of success on the merits and afforded enduring and material relief; the government’s \nposition was not substantially justified because it was flatly at odds with controlling caselaw; and \nno special circumstances make an award unjust.  Holman is therefore entitled to fees and costs, \nso I respectfully dissent. \nI. \nSection  1005  of  the  American  Rescue  Plan  Act  authorized  the  USDA  Secretary  to \n“provide a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the outstanding indebtedness of each \nsocially disadvantaged farmer or rancher as of January 1, 2021, to pay off [direct and guaranteed \nfarm loans].”  Pub. L. No. 117-2, § 1005(a)(2) (2021).  USDA defined “socially disadvantaged” \nbased on race, extending debt relief to Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, Asian, \nor Hawaiian/Pacific Islander farmers and ranchers, without any consideration of need.  86 Fed. \nReg. 28,329, 28,330 (May 26, 2021).  Holman, who does not fall into any of the above racial \ncategories, sued and obtained a preliminary injunction, temporarily enjoining the implementation \nof the debt-relief program.  Section 1005 was then repealed in the Inflation Reduction Act.  Pub. \nL. No. 117-169, § 22008 (2022).  That mooted the case, and the parties stipulated to dismissal.   \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 15\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 15 \n \nHolman then moved for fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2412.  Under that statute, a “prevailing party” in a civil case against the United States is \nentitled  to  fees  and  costs  unless  the  government’s  position  was  “substantially  justified”  or \n“special circumstances make an award unjust.”  Id. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  The district court denied \nHolman’s motion—concluding that he is not a prevailing party. \nII. \nA. \nThe government is not required to pay fees and costs when it shows that its position was \n“substantially justified.”  Id.  A position is substantially justified if “a reasonable person could \nthink it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.”  Pierce v. Underwood, \n487 U.S. 552, 566 n.2 (1988).  The “actual merits” of the position is what “matter[s] most.”  \nGriffith v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 987 F.3d 556, 563 (6th Cir. 2021).  The position must be better \nthan  one  “merely  undeserving  of  sanctions,”  though  it  need  not  ultimately  prove  correct.  \nId. (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566). \nThe majority concludes that the government has shown that its position was substantially \njustified.  I disagree. \n1. \nSection 1005 authorized debt relief based on race.  Pub. L. No. 117-2, § 1005 (2021); \n86 Fed. Reg. 28,329, 28,330 (May 26, 2021).  That makes it presumptively invalid.  Vitolo \nv. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 360 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV).  The government \ncan overcome that presumption only if it shows that the racial discrimination was narrowly \ntailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  Id.  This standard (strict scrutiny) is “very \ndemanding” and one which “few programs will survive.”  Id. \nIn the district court, the government accepted that strict scrutiny applied to this claim and \nargued that it had a “two-fold” compelling interest:  “to remedy the lingering effects of prior \ndiscrimination against minority farmers in USDA loan (and other) programs and prevent public \nfunds from being allocated in a way that perpetuates the effects of discrimination.”  The Supreme \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 16\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 16 \n \nCourt has said that “remedial policies can sometimes justify preferential treatment based on \nrace.”  Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 361 (citing City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493–\n94 (1989) (plurality); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 237 (1995)).  At a \nminimum, though, there must be a specific episode of past intentional discrimination on the part \nof the government against a particular group—disparate impacts are not enough.  Id. \n2. \nThe  government,  of  course,  does  not  have  a  compelling  interest  in  remedying  past \ndiscrimination that never happened.  And when a government program seeks to remedy past \ndiscrimination against a number of different groups, it bears the burden to demonstrate “past \nintentional discrimination against the many groups to whom it grants preferences.”  Id. (faulting \nthe “schedule of racial preferences detailed in the government’s regulation—preferences for \nPakistanis but not Afghans; Japanese but not Iraqis; Hispanics but not Middle Easterners—[a]s \nnot supported by any record evidence at all”).  The majority concludes that the government \nprovided evidence of USDA discrimination against “many specific groups” defined as “socially \ndisadvantaged.”  Maj. Op. at 9 (emphasis added).  But what about the others?  The government \nreferred to no evidence of past intentional discrimination by USDA against Native Hawaiian and \nPacific Islander farmers and ranchers.  And the government relied only on broad assertions and \nstatistical disparities to show discrimination against American Indian, Asian, and Native Alaskan \nfarmers and ranchers.  We might assume that such discrimination happened, but that is not \nenough.  See Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 362 (“[W]hen it comes to general social disparities, there are \nsimply  too  many  variables  to  support  inferences  of  intentional  discrimination.”).    The \ngovernment  cannot  claim  a  compelling  interest  in  remedying  discrimination  without  first \nshowing that the discrimination happened.  Croson, 488 U.S. at 505.  That is reason enough to \nconclude that its position was not substantially justified. \nThat  is  not  to  say,  in  this  preliminary  posture,  that  the  government  made  no \ncompelling-interest showing.  I agree with the majority that the government cited evidence of \npast intentional discrimination against Black farmers and ranchers.  But if the government is \ngoing to use racially exclusionary measures as a remedy, the government’s policy must be \nnarrowly tailored to that particular interest.  And “a policy is not narrowly tailored if it is either \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 17\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 17 \n \noverbroad or underinclusive in its use of racial classifications.”  Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 362.  Here, \nthe program extends debt relief to farmers and ranchers in groups never shown to have been \ndiscriminated against.  Giving Native Hawaiian farmers and ranchers debt relief cannot remedy \npast discrimination against Black farmers and ranchers.  The glaring “mismatch” between means \nand  ends  is  far  too  much  for  strict  scrutiny  to  bear.    Students  for  Fair  Admissions,  Inc. \nv. President  and  Fellows  of  Harvard  Coll.,  143  S.  Ct.  2141,  2168  (2023).    There  is  no \n“reasonable basis in law and fact” to find this policy narrowly tailored.  Pierce, 487 U.S. at \n566 n.2. \nThe majority contends that the Government was not “clearly required, at the preliminary \ninjunction  stage,  to  provide  specific  examples  of  intentional  discrimination  against  every \ncategory included in [its] race-conscious program.”  Maj. Op. at 11.  The Supreme Court says \notherwise.  To justify a “resort to race-based government action,” the government had to show \nthat it was “remediating specific, identified instances of past discrimination that violated the \nConstitution or a statute.”  Students for Fair Admission, Inc., 143 S. Ct. at 2162 (emphasis \nadded).  And the preliminary posture of the litigation does not absolve the government of its \nburden.  See Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429–30 \n(2006).  Absent at least some specific evidence of intentional discrimination against each racial \ngroup, the government cannot show a compelling remedial interest in benefitting that group.  It \nhas not shown there is anything to remedy.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 505–06.  The government’s \nposition—that  § 1005  should  not  be  preliminarily  enjoined—was  not  substantially  justified \nbecause the government presented arguments “flatly at odds with the controlling case law.”  \nGriffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting Taucher v. Brown-Hruska, 396 F.3d 1168, 1174 (D.C. Cir. \n2005)) (cleaned up). \nB. \nBecause I disagree that the government’s position was substantially justified, I turn to the \nprevailing-party issue.  In general, obtaining a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff a \n“prevailing party.”  Planned Parenthood Sw. Ohio Region v. DeWine, 931 F.3d 530, 538 (6th \nCir. 2019).  But, in cases that are later dismissed as moot, a preliminary injunction may suffice \nwhen it (1) turns primarily on the likelihood of success on the merits and affords (2) “enduring” \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 18\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 18 \n \nand (3) “material” relief.  Miller v. Caudill, 936 F.3d 442, 448 (6th Cir. 2019).  The inquiry is \n“case-specific,” but we have tended to treat relief as enduring when it is “irrevocable” and as \nmaterial when it “directly benefits” the plaintiff.  Id.; see McQueary v. Conway, 614 F.3d 591, \n601 (6th Cir. 2010). \nAlthough the question is not free from doubt, I believe that Holman is a prevailing party \nbecause the preliminary injunction in this case turned primarily on the likelihood of success on \nthe merits and afforded enduring and material relief. \n1. \nAs the majority finds, “there is no question that the district court’s preliminary injunction \nopinion  mainly  turned  on  the  likelihood-of-success  inquiry.”    Maj.  Op.  at  5  (cleaned  up).  \nHolman clears this first hurdle with ease. \n2. \nWhether the relief was enduring is a more difficult question.  We have said that relief is \nenduring when it is “irrevocable.”  Miller, 936 F.3d at 448.  Accordingly, we have found \nenduring  relief  where  preliminary  injunctions  enabled  plaintiffs  to:  attend  church,  Roberts \nv. Neace,  65  F.4th  280,  284  (6th  Cir.  2023);  register  voters,  Tenn.  State  Conf.  of  NAACP \nv. Hargett, 53 F.4th 406, 410–11 (6th Cir. 2022); prescribe mifepristone, Planned Parenthood, \n931 F.3d at 541–42; get married, Miller, 936 F.3d at 448–49; and receive in-person education, \nG.S. ex rel. Schwaigert v. Lee, 2023 WL 5205179, at *6 (6th Cir. Aug. 14, 2023).  In each of \nthose cases, the preliminary injunction afforded relief that was in some sense realized during the \npendency of the injunction.  In contrast, we did not find enduring relief where a preliminary \ninjunction temporarily prevented enforcement of a statute criminalizing protests at funerals when \nthe plaintiff had not identified a funeral at which he planned to protest.  McQueary v. Conway, \n508  F.  App’x  522,  523–24  (6th  Cir.  2012);  McQueary  v.  Conway,  2012  WL  3149344,  at \n*3 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 1, 2012).  We distinguished a Seventh Circuit case, Young v. City of Chicago, \n202 F.3d 1000 (7th Cir. 2000), in which the plaintiffs wanted to protest at a particular event, and \nthe injunction enabled them to do so.  McQueary, 508 F. App’x at 524. \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 19\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 19 \n \nThe cases above make clear that relief is enduring only if it is irrevocable.  See Miller, \n936 F.3d at 448.  That distinction is consistent with out-of-circuit caselaw.  See Thomas v. Nat’l \nScience Found., 330 F.3d 486, 488–93 (D.C. Cir. 2003); N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Jackson, 433 F.3d \n1083, 1084–86 (8th Cir. 2006). \nTo determine whether the preliminary injunction afforded Holman irrevocable relief, we \nmust  ask  whether  Holman  benefitted  from  the  injunction  before  the  case  was  mooted.  \nIrrevocable, Black’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) (“committed beyond recall”).  Or to ask the \nquestion differently, would Holman have benefitted even if the injunction had ultimately been \nvacated?  I believe the answer is “yes.”  The preliminary injunction delayed the debt-relief \nprogram.  That secured a period of equal treatment, during which all borrowers were continuing \nto accrue interest, and decreased the present value of the debt-relief program. \nIt is important to remember the nature of the harm in a case like this.  In Regents of the \nUniversity of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), the plaintiff challenged an admissions \nprogram that reserved spots in the entering medical-school class for minorities.  Id. at 279.  The \nSupreme Court explained that the plaintiff was harmed regardless of whether he would have \nbeen admitted to the class absent the challenged program.  Id. at 280 n.14.  The race-based \nexclusion from consideration was a harm separate and apart from any practical consequence of \nthe  exclusion.    So  too  in  other  race-based  set-aside  programs.    See  Ne.  Fla.  Chapter  of \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).  The harm \nin cases like this is “the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not \nthe ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.”  Id. \nThe  denial  of  equal  treatment,  i.e.,  the  “discrimination  itself,”  causes  “serious \nnon-economic” harm.  Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 739–40 (1984).  Because that harm is \n“not co-extensive with any substantive rights to the benefits denied the party discriminated \nagainst,” it can be remedied “by withdrawal of benefits from the favored class as well as by \nextension of benefits to the excluded class.”  Id.  That means that Holman’s equal-protection \nharm could be remedied either by denying everyone debt relief (leveling down), or by allowing \nHolman to participate on a race-neutral basis in the debt-relief program (leveling up).  In this \ncase, the court ordered the level-down remedy. \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 20\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 20 \n \nHolman  argues  that  afforded  him  the  irrevocable  benefit  of  “[d]ay-by-day”  equal \ntreatment.  Appellant Br. at 23–24.  He might be right.  The preliminary injunction, at minimum, \nensured that no one got debt relief during its pendency.  Holman was therefore not being \ndiscriminated against.  The benefit of those days of equal treatment “could not be reversed.”  \nThomas, 330 F.3d at 493; see Heckler, 465 U.S. at 739–40. \nThe counterargument is that the harm in this case is more appropriately tied to dollars—\nnot days.  The argument goes:  The preliminary injunction merely delayed the spending of \nmoney, and because reversal of the preliminary injunction would have meant that the entire \nappropriation could later have been spent in a discriminatory manner, Holman avoided no harm.  \nI  don’t  think  that’s  right  on  these  facts.    Section  1005  authorized  the  Secretary  to  make \ndebt-relief  payments  based  on  amounts  owed  as  of  January  1,  2021.    Pub.  L.  No.  117-2, \n§ 1005(a)(2) (2021).  At minimum, the preliminary injunction delayed those payments.  In the \ninterim, all borrowers were continuing to accrue interest that was not part of the outstanding \nindebtedness as of January 1, 2021.  Plus, aside from any increase in interest expense, delay itself \nhas a cost.  See Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Comm’r, 523 U.S. 382, 384 (1998) (explaining the “time \nvalue of money,” i.e., “the fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow” \n(cleaned up)).  So, even if the equal-protection harm in this case were merely a function of the \nvalue of the debt-relief program, the preliminary injunction irreversibly reduced that too. \nThe preliminary injunction in this case delayed debt-relief payments.  That secured a \nperiod  of  equal  treatment,  meant  that  that  all  borrowers  continued  to  accrue  interest,  and \ndecreased the present value of the debt-relief program.  That relief is irrevocable and, therefore, \nenduring. \n3. \nWhether the relief was material is also complicated.  We have said that relief is material \nwhen it “directly benefits the plaintiff by modifying the defendant’s behavior toward him.”  \nNAACP, 53 F.4th at 410 (cleaned up); see Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111–12 (1992).  So, \npreventing the government from implementing a program that causes an injury would ordinarily \nqualify.  Here, though, there were already two nationwide injunctions against the program.  \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 21\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 21 \n \nSee Faust v. Vilsack, 519 F. Supp. 3d 470, 478 (E.D. Wis. 2021); Wynn v. Vilsack, 545 F. Supp. \n3d 1271, 1295 (M.D. Fla. 2021).  The government argues that the relief was therefore not \nmaterial.  Is a defendant’s behavior changed by an injunction enjoining something already \nenjoined?  As a practical matter, no.  But we have said that “the magnitude of a party’s obtained \nrelief does not dictate the outcome of the prevailing-party inquiry.”  Planned Parenthood, 931 \nF.3d at 541.  Rather, the “touchstone” of the inquiry is whether there has been a meaningful \n“alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote \nin the fee statute.”  Texas State Tchrs. Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792–93 \n(1989).  As a result, we look to the “relief requested in the complaint,” “not the practical \nsignificance of the relief obtained.”  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 602 (cleaned up). \nIn McQueary, for example, the plaintiff obtained a preliminary injunction preventing \nenforcement of two provisions of law that prohibited certain protests.  Id.  The defendant argued \nthat the relief was not material because there were yet other provisions of law, not challenged in \nthat case, that also prohibited the protests.  Id.  This court was unmoved and said that the relief \nwas material even if it had no practical significance.  Id. \nLike  the  plaintiff  in  McQueary,  Holman  obtained  the  relief  he  requested  in  his \ncomplaint—albeit preliminarily.  That seems like enough.  However, unlike in McQueary, the \nrelief Holman requested in his complaint had, in a sense, already been ordered by other courts.  I \ndo not think that changes the outcome here, though.  Those other decisions might have been \nreversed on appeal or otherwise have failed to convert into permanent injunctions; the parties, for \nexample, might have settled, or the scope of the injunctions might have been narrowed.  See, \ne.g., Commonwealth v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 556–57 (6th Cir. 2023); California v. Azar, 911 F.3d \n558, 583–85 (9th Cir. 2018).  The relief in this case meant that Holman had the ability to enforce \nhis injunction and was protected regardless of what happened in those other cases.  Although \nsomewhat difficult to square with the “modifying the defendant’s behavior” formulation, the \nrelief in this case was clearly a meaningful alteration of the legal relationship between the parties \nthat directly benefitted Holman.  Because this court’s cases teach that our focus should be on the \n“relief requested in the complaint,” not its “practical significance,” I think that the relief obtained \nhere qualifies as material.  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 602. \n \n\nCase: 23-5493     Document: 29-2     Filed: 09/23/2024     Page: 22\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 22 \n \nC. \nThe  government  may  still  avoid  paying  fees  and  costs  if  it  shows  that  “special \ncircumstances  make  an  award  unjust.”    28  U.S.C.  § 2412(d)(1)(A).    We  look  to  general \n“equitable considerations” in evaluating this exception.  Sakhawati v. Lynch, 839 F.3d 476, \n478 (6th Cir. 2016).  The government argues that there are three special circumstances here, but \neach falls short. \nFirst,  the  government  repackages  its  material-relief  argument  that  the  preliminary \ninjunction  provided  no  benefit  beyond  the  already-existing  nationwide  injunctions.    That \nargument is unavailing here for the same reasons it was unavailing there:  Holman obtained the \nrelief he requested in his complaint, which gave Holman added protection independent of those \nother cases.  Second, the government notes that it was defending the constitutionality of a statute \nand contends that it is wrong to penalize an agency for complying with its statutory obligations.  \nWhatever the policy merits of the government’s argument, there is nothing in the Equal Access \nto Justice Act that supports a statutory-defense exception.  Third, the government suggests that \nan award would be unjust because some of the fees Holman seeks are for work that occurred \nafter the preliminary injunction entered.  That is not a concern at this stage, though, because it \ndoes not mean that “an award” would be unjust.  28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  Rather, it goes to \ncalculating “reasonable attorney fees.”  Id. § 2412(d)(2)(A); see Sakhawati, 839 F.3d at 480. \nIn this case, no special circumstances make an award unjust. \n* * * \n My best read of our cases is that Holman is entitled to fees and costs because he is a \nprevailing  party,  the  government’s  position  was  not  substantially  justified,  and  no  special \ncircumstances make an award unjust.  I therefore respectfully dissent. \n ",

Vilsack, Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture \n(“USDA”), and Zach Ducheneaux, Administrator of the Farm Service Agency (“FSA”), seeking \na declaratory judgment that Section 1005’s loan forgiveness program in the American Rescue \nPlan  Act  of  2021,  Pub.  L.  No.  117-2,  §  1005  (2021)  (“ARPA”),  is  violative  of  the  Fifth \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause under the United States Constitution and seeking to \nenjoin the program. The Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because this \n \n1  The complaint alleges that the USDA has Plaintiff’s race on file as white and that he “would \ngenerally be considered white or Caucasian.”  (Cmplt. p. 3, ECF No. 1.) \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 2 of 25    PageID 857\ncase presents a substantial question of federal law, specifically whether Section 1005 of the \nARPA, facially and as applied, violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the \nlaw. \n  Section 1005 of the ARPA allots funds for debt relief to “socially disadvantaged” farmers \nand ranchers.2 The USDA interprets the phrase “socially disadvantaged” to mean the racial \nclassifications  of  “Black,  American  Indian/Alaskan  Native,  Hispanic,  or  Asian,  or \nHawaiian/Pacific  Islander.”  See  American  Rescue  Plan  Debt  Payments  FAQ,  Question  1, \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq.  The  program  erases  the  debts  of  those \nfarmers falling within the specified racial classifications who took out qualifying loans and \nprovides an additional 20% to cover tax liabilities, thus providing a payment in an amount up to \n120% of the outstanding indebtedness, without any consideration of need.  Qualifying loans are \neither USDA direct loans or USDA backed loans.  Farmers, such as Plaintiff, who have USDA \nloans and who are white/Caucasian are not considered to be socially disadvantaged and, thus, are \nnot eligible for debt relief regardless of their individual circumstances. The Government has not \ndisputed that Plaintiff, as the holder of two USDA direct farm loans, would be eligible for debt \nrelief if he was a member of one of the specified racial classifications. \n  Defendants Vilsack and Ducheneaux are responsible for the implementation of Section \n1005.  Defendant Vilsack, as Secretary of Agriculture, is responsible for leading the USDA, \nwhich includes the FSA.  Defendant Ducheneaux, as Administrator of the FSA, oversees Section \n1005.  Defendants are sued in their official capacities. \n  On June 6, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction (ECF No. 7) pursuant \nto Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asking the Court to preliminarily enjoin \n \n2 Although Section 1005 refers to both “farmers and ranchers,” the parties have focused on \nfarmers in their briefing.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 3 of 25    PageID 858\nDefendants from enforcing Section 1005. Defendants have filed a response to the motion (ECF \nNo. 31), and Plaintiff has filed a reply to the response.  (ECF No. 36.)  With the Court’s \npermission, the National Black Farmers Association (“NBFA”) and the Association of American \nIndian Farmers (“AAIF”) have submitted a brief as amicus curiae in opposition to Plaintiff’s \nmotion for preliminary injunction.3  (ECF No. 34.)  \n  A hearing on Plaintiff’s motion was held on June 29, 2021, with both parties represented \nby  counsel.    No  testimony  was taken,  although  Plaintiff’s  Declaration  (ECF No.  7-3)  was \nadmitted as an exhibit.  After reviewing the briefs, statements and arguments by counsel at the \nhearing, and the entire record, for the reasons discussed below, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.4  \nHistory/Background of Section 1005 \n  As explained by Defendants, Congress enacted Section 1005 to provide debt relief to \n“socially disadvantaged” farmers holding certain USDA loans in an attempt to remedy “the \nlingering effects of the unfortunate but well-documented history of racial discrimination” in \nUSDA  loan  programs.5  (Resp.  p.  1,  ECF  No.  31.)  Congress  considered  evidence  that \n“discriminatory  loan  practices  at  USDA  have  placed  minority  farmers  at  a  significant \ndisadvantage  today;”  statistically  these  farmers  generally  own  smaller  farms,  have \ndisproportionately higher delinquency rates, and are at a significantly higher risk of foreclosure \n \n3  The NBFA and AAIF have also filed a conditional motion for leave to intervene as defendants \nin  this  matter.  However,  because,  at  present,  NBFA  and  AAIF  purport  to  share  the  same \nobjective as the Government in defending the challenged law, the organizations have requested \nthat the Court defer consideration of the motion until such time as developments in this lawsuit \nindicate that the organizations’ interests diverge from the Government’s. (ECF No. 27.)  \n4  This Court has authority to order injunctive relief and other relief that is necessary and proper \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n5 Plaintiff has not disputed the USDA’s long-term history of racially discriminatory practices.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 4 of 25    PageID 859\nthan non-minority farmers. (Id.)  Defendants contend that Congress concluded that paying off \nqualifying USDA loans of minority farmers6 was “necessary to further its interests in remedying \nthe lingering effects of racial discrimination in USDA loan programs and ensuring that its \npandemic relief efforts did not perpetuate those lingering effects.” (Id. at pp. 1 – 2.) \n  According to Defendants, “decades of evidence shows that not all USDA stakeholders \nhave benefitted equally from its services — particularly its farm loan services,” and the evidence \nindicates “that throughout USDA’s history minority farmers have been ‘hurt’ more than helped \ndue to discrimination in USDA’s farm loan programs.”  (Id. at p. 3 (relying on “A Report by the \nCivil Rights Action Team” (CRAT) 6 (1997) (“CRAT Report”))).  To support their proposition \nthat “[m]inority farmers have long experienced inequities in FSA’s administration of farm loans, \nincluding with respect to loan approval rates, amounts, and terms,” Defendants have cited a 1982 \nreport from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, The Decline of Black Farming in America 84-\n85, the 1997 CRAT Report, and the 2002 Civil Rights Hearing on the USDA’s Civil Rights \nProgram for Farm Program Participants.  (Id.)   \n  Defendants also point to a “series of lawsuits against USDA by groups of minority \nfarmers” beginning in 1997 and continuing over the next decade.  “African-American, Native \nAmerican, Hispanic, and female farmers alleged that USDA systematically discriminated against \nthem  in  the  administration  of  farm  loans  and  other  benefits  and  failed  to  investigate \ndiscrimination complaints.”7  (Id. at p. 4 (listing Pigford v. Glickman (“Pigford I”), No. 97-1978 \n \n6  Defendants have used the terms “socially disadvantaged farmers” and “minority farmers” \ninterchangeably. However, as explained above, not all “minority famers” are included in the \ndefinition of “socially disadvantaged farmers.”   \n7  There has been no explanation as to why female farmers were not included within the ambit of \nSection 1005 even though female restaurant owners were included in the restaurant portion of the \nARPA. Additionally, little to no evidence has been presented concerning discrimination toward \nHawaiian/Pacific Islander farmers.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 5 of 25    PageID 860\n(D.D.C.); Keepseagle v.

(collectively “Pigford”)).  According to Defendants, “[a]lthough \nUSDA has settled the lawsuits and paid more than $2.4 billion to claimants, State taxes eroded \nrecoveries,  debt  relief  was  incomplete,  and  reports  before  Congress  have  shown  that  the \nsettlements did not cure the problems faced by minority farmers.”  (Id.)  Even after the lawsuits, \na 2011 report – Jackson Lewis LLP, “Civil Rights Assessment” (Mar. 31, 2011) (“JL Report”) – \nshowed that socially disadvantaged groups “continued to experience discrimination with respect \nto  the  requirements,  availability,  and  timing  of  FSA  loans.”    (Id.)    A  2021  Government \nAccountability Office report commented on long-existing “concerns about discrimination in \ncredit markets” and surmised that minority farmers continued to have less access to credit.  (Id.)   \n  Defendants rely on a 1982 agriculture report to link “discrimination in USDA’s loan \nprograms” to “a dramatic loss of minority-owned farmland. (Id. at p. 5 (citing Arg.

Moreover, “over the last century, Black farmers dwindled from \n14 to two percent of all farmers and lost about 80% of their land.”  (Id. at pp. 5-6.) \n  According to Defendants, Congress considered this report, and others,8 which show “the \npattern of discrimination in USDA programs and its consequences for minority farmers” when \n \n8  (Resp. at p. 5 n.8 (citing Hr’g on USDA’s Civil Rights Progs. and Responsibilities before The \nHouse Subcomm. on Dep’t Ops., Oversight, Nutrition, and Forestry, Comm. on Ag., 106th \nCong. 37 (1999) (Goodlatte) (recognizing that “[c]ivil rights at the [USDA] has long been a \nproblem”); 2002 Civil Rights Hr’g 16, 18, 26 (hearing testimony about the disparities in loan \nprocessing times and approval rates for Hispanic farmers; underrepresentation of minorities in \nUSDA; and continuing delays in the resolution of civil rights complaints); Hr’g to Review the \nUSDA’s Farm Loan Progs. before the Senate Comm. on Ag., Nutrition, and Forestry, 109th \nCong.  800  (2006)  (Karen  Krub,  Farmers’  Legal  Action  Group,  Inc.)

For example, “reporting indicated that nearly the entirety of USDA’s $25 billion \nMarket  Facilitation  Program  (MFP)  payments,  and  almost  all  of  the  $9.2  billion  provided \nthrough USDA’s first Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), went to non-minority \nfarmers.”  (Id. (citations omitted.))  According to Defendants, Congress found that this disparity \nwas “partly due to the lingering effects of discrimination in USDA programs.” (Id. at pp. 8-9.)  \nDefendants reference a letter from thirteen agriculture professors who explained that federal farm \nprograms “have perpetuated and exacerbated the problem” of discrimination, by preferring crops \nthat  tend  to  be  produced  by  white  farmers  and  “rewarding”  large  farms  “which  are \npredominantly owned by white farmers.”  (Id. at p. 9.)   \n  Congress passed Section 1005 of the ARPA to “provide targeted and tailored support for \n…  farmers,”  CR  H.765  (Scott),  who  “have  for  many  decades  suffered  discrimination  by \n[USDA],’ id. S.1265 (Booker), and had not benefited from prior pandemic relief efforts, id. \nH.1273  (Rep.  Neal)  (explaining  as  much  with  respect  to  Black  farmers);  id.

They claim that, in doing so, \nCongress looked at evidence that discriminatory loan practices at the USDA placed minority \nfarmers at a significant disadvantage pre-pandemic and that minority farmers’ positions were \nmade worse by the pandemic, which disproportionately burdened them.  Defendants argue that, \nin authorizing debt relief in Section 1005, Congress adopted a measure that was narrowly \ntailored to remedy the lingering effects of discrimination in USDA programs and to correct the \nways prior funding had perpetuated those lingering effects. \nLegal Standard and Analysis \n  “The purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of \nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be held.” Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, \n395 (1981).  It is an “extraordinary and drastic” remedy, and “[t]he party seeking [it] bears the \nburden of justifying such relief.”  Am. Civil Liberties Union Fund of Mich. v. Livingston Cnty., \n796 F.3d 636, 642 (6th Cir. 2015).  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reiterated the \nstandard for issuing a preliminary injunction. \nWe consider four factors in determining whether a preliminary injunction should \nissue: (1) whether the moving party has shown a likelihood of success on the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 9 of 25    PageID 864\nmerits;  (2)  whether  the  moving  party  will  be  irreparably  injured  absent  an \ninjunction;  (3)  whether  issuing  an  injunction  will  harm  other  parties  to  the \nlitigation; and (4) whether an injunction is in the public interest. Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 434, 129 S. Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009). In constitutional \ncases, the first factor is typically dispositive. Roberts v. Neace, 958 F.3d 409, 416 \n(6th Cir. 2020) (order) (per curiam). That’s because “[w]hen constitutional rights \nare threatened or impaired, irreparable injury is presumed.” Obama for Am. v. \nHusted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012). And no cognizable harm results from \nstopping unconstitutional conduct, so “it is always in the public interest to prevent \nviolation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. \nGov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 274 F.3d 377, 400 (6th Cir. 2001) (citation \nomitted). We thus focus our analysis on the plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the \nmerits. \n \nVitolo v. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 360 (6th Cir. May 27, 2021).   \nLikelihood of Success on the Merits \n  At the outset, the Court notes that four cases in particular have informed its decision:  \nVitolo (enjoining the restaurant relief portion of the ARPA), which is binding precedent for this \nCourt, and Faust v. Vilsack, 2021 WL 2409729 (E.D. Wis. June 10, 2021) (enjoining Section \n1005’s farm loan relief portion of the ARPA), Wynn v. Vilsack, 2021 WL 2580678 (M.D. Fla. \nJune 23, 2021) (same), and Miller v. Vilsack, No. 4:21-cv-0595-O (N.D. Tex., July 1, 2021), \nwhich are persuasive.10  All four courts determined that the plaintiff had shown, inter alia, a \nlikelihood of success on the merits in challenging portions of the ARPA that purportedly violated \nthe plaintiff’s equal protection rights by allocating funds based on race (and in Vitolo also based \non gender) and enjoined the distribution of those funds.  At the hearing in this Court, the parties \nagreed that the evidence that was presented in Faust and in Wynn is the same as the evidence \npresented in this case.11 \n \n10  Although decisions from other circuits are not binding on this Court, those opinions may \nconstitute persuasive authority.  See Moldowan v. City of Warren, 578 F.3d 351, 381 n. 9 (6th \nCir. 2009).  \n11  The hearing pre-dated the Miller decision. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 10 of 25    PageID 865\n  The parties also agree that, because Section 1005 on its face makes a distinction among \napplicants for relief on the basis of race, it must satisfy strict scrutiny – that is, it must be \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.  See Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, \n505  (2005)  (quoting  Adarand  Constructors,  Inc.  v.  Peña,  515  U.S.  200,  227  (1995),  and \nreiterating that “all racial classifications [imposed by government] ... must be analyzed by a \nreviewing court under strict scrutiny.”) Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of \nproving  that  racial  classifications  “are  narrowly  tailored  measures  that  further  compelling \ngovernmental interests.” Johnson, 543 U.S. at 505.  “When race-based action is necessary to \nfurther  a  compelling  governmental  interest,  such  action  does  not  violate  the  constitutional \nguarantee of equal protection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also satisfied.”  \nGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 327 (2003).  Thus, the government must adopt “the least \nrestrictive means of achieving a compelling state interest,” McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U. S. 464, \n478 (2014), “rather than a means substantially related to a sufficiently important interest.”  \nAmericans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta, __ S. Ct. __, 2021 WL 2690268 (July 1, 2021). \n  Because “[g]overnment policies that classify people by race are presumptively invalid,” \nand “[t]o overcome that presumption, the government must show that favoring one race over \nanother is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest,” Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 360, the Court \nbegins by looking at the Government’s asserted compelling state interest in its race-based farm \nloan forgiveness program.  Defendants have offered as “a compelling interest” the need to \nremedy past discrimination suffered by “socially disadvantaged” farmers at the hands of the \nUSDA.  It is undisputed that the USDA has a sad history of discriminating against certain groups \nof farmers based on their race.  The evidence in the record reveals systemic racial discrimination \nby  the  USDA  (and  in  particular  the  FSA)  throughout  the  twentieth  century  which  has \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 11 of 25    PageID 866\ncompounded over time, resulting in bankruptcies, land loss, a reduced number of minority \nfarmers, and diminished income for the remaining minority farmers.  Defendants argue that \nSection 1005 is necessary to reverse the years of economic discrimination against minority \nfarmers.  However, Vitolo, Faust, Wynn, and Miller all rejected systemic racial discrimination as \na compelling state interest to support race-based legislation. \n  In Vitolo, the Sixth Circuit explained when the government may attempt to remedy past \ndiscrimination by using preferential treatment based on race. \nFirst, the policy must target a specific episode of past discrimination. It cannot \nrest on a “generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in an entire \nindustry.” [City of Richman v.] J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. [469] at 498, 109 S. Ct. \n706 [1989]; see also Adarand, 515 U.S. at 226, 115 S. Ct. 2097; Aiken v. City of \nMemphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1162–63 (6th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (explaining that \nsocietal discrimination is not enough to justify racial classifications and that there \nmust be prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved). \n \nSecond, there must be evidence of intentional discrimination in the past. J.A. \nCroson  Co.,  488  U.S.  at  503,  109  S.  Ct.  706  (requiring  an  “inference  of \ndiscriminatory exclusion”). Statistical disparities don’t cut it, although they may \nbe used as evidence to establish intentional discrimination. See Aiken, 37 F.3d at \n1163; United Black Firefighters Ass’n v. City of Akron, 976 F.2d 999, 1011 (6th \nCir. 1992).  \n \nThird, the government must have had a hand in the past discrimination it now \nseeks to remedy. So if the government “show[s] that it had essentially become a \n“passive participant” in a system of racial exclusion practiced by elements of [a] \nlocal ... industry,” then the government can act to undo the discrimination. J.A. \nCroson Co., 488 U.S.  at 492, 109 S. Ct. 706 (plurality opinion). But if the \ngovernment cannot show that it actively or passively participated in this past \ndiscrimination, race-based remedial measures violate equal-protection principles. \n \nVitolo, 999 F.3d at 361.  \n  Here, Defendants cannot meet the first prong because the evidence does not show that \nSection 1005  targets  a  specific  episode  of  past  discrimination.  Defendants  have  pointed  to \nstatistical and anecdotal evidence of a history of discrimination by the USDA.  But it is well-\nsettled that a “generalized assertion that there has been past discrimination in an entire industry” \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 12 of 25    PageID 867\ncannot establish a compelling interest. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 498; see also Parents \nInvolved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 731 (2007) (plurality opinion) \n(“remedying past societal discrimination does not justify race-conscious government action”). \nMoreover, as recognized in Wynn, “[d]ue to the significant remedial measures previously taken \nby Congress, for purposes of this case, the historical evidence does little to address the need for \ncontinued remediation through Section 1005.”  Wynn, 2021 WL 2580678, at * 5. Any evidence \nthat there is such a need “is not tied in any way to a governmental interest in affording [socially \ndisadvantaged farmers] broad race-based debt relief and does not support a finding that USDA \ncontinues to be a participant, passive or active, in discrimination.”12  Id. \n  Also, although Defendants have asserted that the majority of funding in pandemic relief \nefforts did not reach minority farmers, they have not provided evidence of “specific episodes” of \npresent intentional discrimination by Defendants. At the hearing, Defendants conceded that \nCongress attempted to remedy the lingering effects of historic discrimination when enacting \nSection 1005 and did not rely on specific present-day discrimination occurring at the USDA. \n  In Wynn, Judge Marcia Morales Howard analyzed the evidence presented by Defendants \non this issue and found it to be lacking. \n[T]he Government cites to two statistics related to recent USDA programs that \nhave disproportionately benefited White farmers. The first statistic shows 99.4% \nof  relief  under  USDA’s  Market  Facilitation  Program  (MFP)  went  to  White \nfarmers. The second statistic shows 97% of the $9.2 billion in pandemic relief \nprovided through USDA’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program in 2020 went to \nnonminority farmers. Even taking these statistics at face value, they are less useful \nthan they may appear to be.   \n \n12  Defendants will have the opportunity to present such evidence at a trial on the merits. See \nWynn, 2021 WL 2580678, at *6 n.9 (“On a more fully developed record, the Government may be \nable to establish that despite past remedial efforts the harm caused by the disgraceful history of \ndiscrimination by the USDA in farm loans and programs is ongoing or that the Government is in \nsome way a participant in perpetuating that discrimination such that further narrowly tailored \naffirmative relief is warranted.”)   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 13 of 25    PageID 868\n \nThe first statistic is qualified by the fact that: “[a]pproximately seven percent of \nthe funds went to entities owned by corporations or individuals whose race was \nnot reported.” The report also identifies farm size and specific crops—namely, \nsoybeans—as being the target of MFP funding, not racial identity. As to the \nsecond statistic, both parties at least tacitly acknowledge the 2020 relief went \nprimarily to nonminority farmers because the legislation targeted large farms that \nwere disproportionately owned by nonminority farmers — not because the relief \nefforts were facially discriminatory. Where a race-neutral basis for a statistical \ndisparity can be shown, the Court can give that statistical evidence less weight. \nHere, the statistical discrepancies presented by the Government can be explained \nby non-race related factors — farm size and crops grown — and the Court finds it \nunlikely that this evidence, standing alone, would constitute a strong basis for the \nneed for a race-based remedial program. \n \nWynn, 2021 WL 2580678, at *6 (citations omitted). See also Hilbert v. Ohio Dep’t of Rehab. & \nCorr., 121 F. App’x 104, 110 (6th Cir. 2005) (explaining in an alleged racial discrimination \nemployment context that, although statistical data, if unrebutted, can create an inference of \ndiscrimination, such data must not only show a significant disparity between two groups, but \nmust  also  “eliminate  the  most  common  nondiscriminatory  explanations  for  the  disparity.” \n(citations omitted)).  Defendants have presented no additional evidence to this Court than that \npresented in Wynn, and, as discussed above, Defendants stated at the hearing that the evidence \nbefore this Court is the same as the evidence presented in Wynn.  “An observation that prior, \nrace-neutral relief efforts failed to reach minorities is no evidence at all that the government \nenacted or administered those policies in a discriminatory way.” Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 362.     \n  As for the second prong, other than statistical disparities, Defendants have presented no \nevidence of current intentional discrimination by Defendants, and they acknowledged this lack of \nevidence at the hearing.  Instead, Defendants attempted to rely on statistical and anecdotal \nevidence, even though this type of evidence to show intentional discrimination has been rejected \nby the Sixth Circuit.  See Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 361 (“When the government promulgates race-\nbased policies, it must operate with a scalpel. And its cuts must be informed by data that suggest \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 14 of 25    PageID 869\nintentional discrimination. The broad statistical disparities cited by the government are not nearly \nenough.”)13 \n  Looking at the third prong, the Court finds evidence that the USDA played a role in past \ndiscrimination toward socially disadvantaged farmers but no evidence of current discrimination \nby the USDA. That is, no evidence has been presented that the USDA or FSA played a role in \ncreating the disparities in pandemic relief given to minority farmers versus non-minority farmers. \n  Accordingly, Defendants here, as in Vitolo, have failed to establish that the government \nhas a compelling interest in remedying the effects of past and present discrimination through the \ndistribution of benefits on the basis of racial classifications.   \n  However, even when the government has shown a compelling state interest in remedying \nsome specific episode of discrimination, the discriminatory legislation must be narrowly tailored \nto further that interest.  Id.   \nFor a policy to survive narrow-tailoring analysis, the government must show \n“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.” Grutter \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 339, 123 S. Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003); J.A. \nCroson Co., 488 U.S. at 507, 109 S. Ct. 706. This requires the government to \nengage in a genuine effort to determine whether alternative policies could address \nthe alleged harm. And, in turn, a court must not uphold a race-conscious policy \nunless it is “satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternative” would achieve the \ncompelling interest. Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 312, 133 S. \nCt. 2411, 186 L.Ed.2d 474 (2013). In addition, a policy is not narrowly tailored if \nit is either overbroad or underinclusive in its use of racial classifications. J.A. \nCroson Co., 488 U.S. at 507–08, 109 S. Ct. 706; Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, \n273–75, 123 S. Ct. 2411, 156 L.Ed.2d 257 (2003). \n \n \n13 The Vitolo court distinguished between cases based on racial statistical disparities involving a \nsingle decisionmaker, such as when a city hires one race at a disproportionate rate, and statistics \nshowing “general social disparities” because “there are simply too many variables to support \ninferences of intentional discrimination.” Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 362.  Although Vitolo addressed \nsocietal  discrimination,  the  court  also  considered  whether  the  government  had  shown  a \ncompelling interest in remedying past industry-wide discrimination. Id. at pp. 361-62. \n \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 15 of 25    PageID 870\nVitolo, 999 F.3d at 362 – 63. “[T]he strict scrutiny standard ... forbids the use even of narrowly \ndrawn racial classifications except as a last resort.” J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 519 (Kennedy, \nJ., concurring).   \n  Here,  Defendants  have  not  presented  any  race-neutral  alternatives  that  Congress \nconsidered when discussing Section 1005. Instead, they contend that the loan relief program is \nnarrowly  tailored  to  its  constitutional  aims  because  race-neutral  alternatives  have  failed.  \nHowever, as pointed out in Vitolo, in attempting to mitigate the failure of prior pandemic relief \nefforts  to  reach  socially  disadvantaged  farmers  (minority  and  female  restaurant  owners  in \nVitolo), Congress could have given priority to those farmers who did not receive prior pandemic \naid instead of passing race-based legislation. (“But an obvious race-neutral alternative exists: \nThe government could grant priority consideration to all business owners [farmers] who were \nunable to obtain needed capital or credit during the pandemic.”) “Because these race-neutral \nalternatives exist, the governments use of race is unconstitutional.”  Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 363.   \n  The  Vitolo  court  also  looked  at  whether  the  legislation  at  issue  in  that  case  was \nunderinclusive or overinclusive and found that it was both.  \nFor example, individuals who trace their ancestry to Pakistan and India qualify for \nspecial treatment. But those from Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq do not. Those from \nChina, Japan, and Hong Kong all qualify. But those from Tunisia, Libya, and \nMorocco  do  not.  This  scattershot  approach  does  not  conform  to  the  narrow \ntailoring strict scrutiny requires. \n \nId. at 363-64.  Under Section 1005, “Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, or \nAsian, or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander” farmers qualify for debt relief but not farmers of other races \nor ethnicities regardless of their financial condition and regardless of whether they obtained any \nfinancial relief during the pandemic. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 16 of 25    PageID 871\n  The Wynn court also specified ways in which Section 1005 is both underinclusive and \noverinclusive.  For instance, Section 1005 benefits only those socially disadvantaged farmers \nwho received qualifying USDA farm loans, “but the evidence of discrimination provided by the \nGovernment says little regarding how this particular group of [socially disadvantaged farmers] \nhas been the subject of past or ongoing discrimination.” Wynn, 2021 WL 2580678, at *7. \nAdditionally,  \n[a]lthough the Government argues that Section 1005 is narrowly tailored to reach \nsmall  farmers  or  farmers  on  the  brink  of  foreclosure,  it  is  not.  Regardless \nof farm size, [a socially disadvantaged farmer] receives up to 120% debt relief. \nAnd regardless of whether [a socially disadvantaged farmer] is having the most \nprofitable year ever and not remotely in danger of foreclosure, that [a socially \ndisadvantaged farmer] receives up to 120% debt relief. Yet a small White farmer \nwho is on the brink of foreclosure can do nothing to qualify for debt relief. Race \nor ethnicity is the sole, inflexible factor that determines the availability of relief \nprovided by the Government under Section 1005. \n \nId.  The Wynn court also commented on the dearth of evidence of prior discrimination by the \nUSDA in farm loans toward Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, groups which are \nincluded in Section 1005, thus leading to an inference that Section 1005 is overinclusive as well \nas being underinclusive. Id. at *10. Finally, “there is little evidentiary support for the magnitude \nof relief provided by Section 1005 — up to 120% debt relief to all [socially disadvantaged \nfarmers] with qualifying farm loans — which appears to duplicate or in some instances exceed \nthe relief provided to those who actually suffered the well-documented historic discrimination \nCongress sought to remedy through prior settlements” such as Pigford.  \nTo the extent Section 1005 is intended to address the alleged erosion of prior \nrelief identified by Senators Booker and Stabenow in their floor statements, the \nGovernment presents no evidence that the recipients of Section 1005’s relief are \nthe same persons or in any way — but race — similarly situated to the persons \nthat received the previous, potentially inadequate relief. Nor does it explain how \nproviding this debt relief to current loan holders is narrowly tailored to address \nthe concern of previously inadequate relief. On the record before the Court at this \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 17 of 25    PageID 872\nstage in the case, it does not appear that Section 1005 is narrowly tailored such \nthat it “eliminates no more than the exact source of the ‘evil’ it seeks to remedy.” \n \nId. (citation omitted). \n  Defendants  contend  that  Congress  has  unsuccessfully  implemented  race-neutral \nalternatives  for  decades,  but  no  evidence  was  presented  that  Congress  ever  engaged  “in  a \ngenuine effort to determine whether alternative policies could address the alleged harm” here. \nVitolo, 999 F.3d at 362.  As indicated in Faust, “[t]he obvious response to a government agency \nthat claims it continues to discriminate against farmers because of their race or national origin is \nto direct it to stop: it is not to direct it to intentionally discriminate against others on the basis of \ntheir race and national origin.”  Faust, 2021 WL 2409729, at *3.  \n  The Faust court listed ways in which Congress could have implemented race-neutral \nprograms  to  help  farmers  in  need  of  financial  assistance  “such  as  requiring  individual \ndeterminations of disadvantaged status or giving priority to loans of farmers and ranchers that \nwere left out of the previous pandemic relief funding. It can also provide better outreach, \neducation, and other resources.” Id. at *3.  Because “[n]arrow tailoring requires evaluating the \n“efficacy of alternative [race-neutral] measures,” United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 \n(1987) (plurality opinion), and Congress did not do so, the Court finds that Section 1005 is not \nnarrowly tailored to remedy the ills that Congress sought to alleviate. \n  However important the goal of eliminating the vestiges of prior race discrimination, and \nit is important, the government’s efforts cannot withstand strict scrutiny.  Therefore, Plaintiff has \nshown a likeliness of success on the merits at trial.  \n   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 18 of 25    PageID 873\nIrreparable Injury14 \n  Section  1005(a)(1)  appropriates  “out  of  amounts  in  the  Treasury  not  otherwise \nappropriated, such sums as may be necessary, to remain available until expended .…” Plaintiff \ncontends that, if the Court does not halt all payments, then the limited funds available will be \ndepleted by the time this case is resolved, and he will suffer irreparable harm.  Defendants \ncounter that the funds are not limited and that, if Plaintiff prevails at trial, he can be made whole \nby being made eligible for debt relief.15  In rejecting that argument, the Miller court noted that \n“[w]hile the Government may at times act like it, the public fisc is not bottomless, and at any \ntime, Congress may turn off the spigot.”  Miller, No. 4:21-cv-0595-O at p. 20 (citing Baker v. \nConcord, 916 F.2d 744, 749 (1st Cir. 1990)). \n  Not only is the “public fisc” not “bottomless,” there are strong indications that Section \n1005’s “bottom” is $4 billion.16 Plaintiff maintains that Section 1005’s language stating that \nfunds  for  debt  relief  will  be  expended  “out  of  amounts  in  the  Treasury  not  otherwise \nappropriated” indicates some limit to the funds.  Additionally, at the hearing, Plaintiff pointed \nout that public statements surrounding Section 1005 indicated that $4 billion was available for \nfarm debt relief. See, e.g., Delta Farm Press, 2021 WLNR 18455848 (June 8, 2021) (noting \nDefendant Vilsack’s testimony that $4 billion would be given away to socially disadvantaged \nfarmers); The Daily Citizen (Dalton, GA), 2021 WLNR 17135549 (May 26, 2021) (relying on \n \n14  Even though, in constitutional cases, a finding of likelihood of success on the merits “is \ntypically dispositive,” Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 360 (citing Roberts, 958 F.3d at 416), the Court has \nconsidered the remaining factors in its analysis.  \n15  Defendants also contend that Plaintiff has not shown a need for debt relief under Section \n1005.  Because Section 1005 is not based on need, this argument is unavailing. \n16  At the hearing, Defendants stated that the $4 billion figure was arrived at by calculating the \namount needed to pay off the qualifying loans held by socially disadvantaged farmers. \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 19 of 25    PageID 874\nstatements by Defendant Vilsack and United States Senator Raphael Warnock that the “U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture will begin doling out $4 billion in payments to farmers of color as \npart of the most recent COVID-19 relief package.”); International New York Times, 2021 WLNR \n16517301(May 22, 2021) (“The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the loan forgiveness \nprovision would cost $4 billion over a decade.”); Reuters News (May 21, 2021) (“The U.S. \nAgriculture Department said on Friday it will start erasing an estimated $4 billion dollars in debt \nto minority farmers in June, as it seeks to address racial discrimination.”). \n  The Faust court discussed the subject of the amount of funding provided by Section \n1005.  \nWhile there is no explicit cap on the funds allocated to the loan-forgiveness \nprogram, based on current estimates, 0.2% of the $1.9 trillion package in the \nARPA has been allocated to the program. Defendants sent offer letters to eligible \nfarmers and ranchers as early as May 24, 2021. On June 9, 2021, Defendants sent \noffer letters to 8,580 farmers, and intend to send another 6,836 letters beginning \nJune 14, 2021. Defendants indicate that it will take an average of seven days to \nreceive an accepted offer and that the FSA will process payment immediately \nupon receipt of the offer. Defendants have already started to forgive loans, and the \n8,580 farmers and ranchers who were sent offer letters represent approximately \n49% of the loans that will be forgiven under the program. The entire $3.8 billion \nthat has been allocated to the program may be depleted before briefing and \nconsideration of the motion for a preliminary injunction. \n \nFaust, 2021 WL 2409729, at *4 (emphasis added and citations to the record omitted). \n  The Court concludes that, while it is not clear that relief under Section 1005 is limited to \n$4  billion,  it  not  believable  that  Congress  intended  to  appropriate  open-ended  funding.  \nTherefore, if the program is not enjoined, even if Plaintiff is later determined to be eligible for \nthe program, he would suffer irreparable injury in the likely case that all the funds allotted for the \nprogram would have already been spent. \n  Next, Defendants contend that rather than enjoining the program, the Court could, at a \nlater date, “re-write” Section 1005 to include Plaintiff.  That is, instead of withdrawing benefits \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 20 of 25    PageID 875\nfrom the favored class (“socially disadvantaged farmers”), the Court could extend benefits to the \nexcluded class (white farmers such as Plaintiff).  In support of their argument, Defendants rely \non the Supreme Court’s decision in Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76 (1979).  In that case, the \nSupreme Court looked at a federal statute that provided benefits to families whose fathers had \nbecome unemployed but denied those same benefits when mothers lost their jobs, and the Court \nultimately expanded the statute to include mothers as well as fathers.  Id. at 79.  Prior to 1968, \nthe provision of assistance to families whose dependent children were deprived of support \nbecause of a parent’s unemployment was gender neutral.  Id.  at 79-80.  In 1968, as part of a \nrevision to the Social Security Act, Congress added the gender qualification to the statute.  Id. at \n80. The Court upheld the lower court’s remedy of “extension rather than invalidation” because \nthe Social Security Act’s “strong severability clause” … “evidence[d] a congressional intent to \nminimize the burdens imposed by a declaration of unconstitutionality upon innocent recipients of \ngovernment largesse.”  Id. at 90. \n  In Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England, 546 U.S. 320 (2006), the Court \nconsidered  when  it  was  appropriate  “to  devise  a  judicial  remedy  that  does  not  entail \nquintessentially legislative work.”  546 U.S. at 330.  The Court looked to Westcott to find that \n“the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot ‘use its \nremedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.’” Id. (quoting Westcott, 443 U.S. 94 \n(Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). “After finding an application or portion of \na statute unconstitutional, we must next ask: Would the legislature have preferred what is left of \nits statute to no statute at all?”  Ayotte, 546 U.S. at 330 (citations omitted). \n  The legislative intent of Section 1005 is to remedy past discrimination suffered by those \nfarmers defined as “socially disadvantaged” and to give those farmers a more level playing field \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 21 of 25    PageID 876\nwith non-minority farmers.  Opening eligibility for debt relief to all farmers would gut that \nintent.  Additionally, Defendants have not pointed to a severability clause in the ARPA or \nSection 1005 to show that Congress would rather have race-neutral debt relief for farmers than \nno debt relief at all.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Westcott does not support Defendants’ \nargument. \nDefendants also contend that there is no need for a preliminary injunction in this case \nbecause the courts in Faust and Wynn have already enjoined Section 1005’s distribution of \nfunds.  However, Defendants have given no assurance that they will not appeal those decisions. \nMoreover, Faust, Wynn, and Miller are all out-of-circuit decisions, and the standard for issuing \nan injunction in the Sixth Circuit is not necessarily the same as in other circuits.  And, as the \nMiller court noted, “the existence of overlapping injunctive relief from other courts does not \nserve to automatically eliminate irreparable harm in parallel litigation, and the Government cites \nno authority to suggest otherwise.”  Miller, No. 4:21-cv-0595-O at p. 21. \nFinally, Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if he is denied his constitutional right to \nequal protection.  Vitolo was clear that the impairment of a constitutional right supports a finding \nof irreparable injury.  Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 365 (quoting Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 809 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (“[W]hen reviewing a motion for a preliminary injunction, if it is found that a \nconstitutional  right  is  being  threatened  or  impaired,  a  finding  of  irreparable  injury  is \nmandated.”)).17  Therefore, even if Plaintiff obtained financial relief after a trial on the merits, he \n \n17 The parties disagree as to whether a farmer who receives debt forgiveness under Section 1005 \nwill be eligible for future debt forgiveness under 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(c), which prohibits the USDA \nfrom providing debt forgiveness on a direct loan to any person who has previously received debt \nforgiveness. See 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(c).  The Court need not decide the dispute at this juncture \nbased on Plaintiff’s statement at the hearing that he is not relying on this point of law as a basis \nfor his motion for injunctive relief. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 22 of 25    PageID 877\nwould have suffered irreparable harm merely by the deprivation of his constitutional rights \nduring the pendency of this matter.  \nSubstantial Harm to Others \n  Defendants  contend  that  Plaintiff  has  not  shown  that  any  injury  to  him  absent  an \ninjunction  would  outweigh  the  harm  to  the  socially  disadvantaged  farmers  who  are  at  a \ndisproportionately higher risk of foreclosure and whose economic position in the midst of the \npandemic worsens the longer payments are delayed.  While this factor militates in favor of not \ngranting the injunction, the potential economic harm to minority farmers is lessened by the \nUSDA’s  present  policy  of  not  foreclosing  on  USDA  direct  loans,  as  acknowledged  by \nDefendants at the hearing.  Additionally, the USDA has encouraged private lenders not to \nforeclose on their loans. \nPublic Interest18 \n  This factor weighs in favor of granting the injunction.  Plaintiff is asserting a violation of \nthe Equal Protection Clause, and, as reiterated by Vitolo, “it is always in the public interest to \nprevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 360 (quoting Deja Vu \nof Nashville, 274 F.3d at 400 (citation omitted)). \n  Summary and Conclusion \n  The Court finds that Plaintiff has shown a substantial likelihood that he will prevail on \nhis claim that Section 1005 violates his right to equal protection under the law.  Absent action by \nthe Court, socially disadvantaged farmers will obtain debt relief, while Plaintiff will suffer the \nirreparable harm of being excluded from that program solely on the basis of his race. Despite the \narguments of Defendants, the Court cannot re-write Section 1005 and order that Plaintiff receive \n \n18  The factors of irreparable harm and the public interest “merge when the Government is the \nopposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 23 of 25    PageID 878\nequivalent relief.  While an injunction may harm socially disadvantaged farmers, the Court has \nbalanced the equities and determines that they favor enjoining Section 1005.  The Court agrees \nwith Judge Howard’s reasoning that “the remedy chosen and provided in Section 1005 appears to \nfall well short of the delicate balance accomplished when a legislative enactment employs race in \na narrowly tailored manner to address a specific compelling governmental interest.”  Wynn, 2021 \nWL 2580678, at *17. \n  Although this Court has reservations about issuing a nationwide injunction, in this type of \ncase such an injunction is warranted.19  As explained by Judge Howard, \nHere,  despite  exploring  any  possible  more  narrow  option,  the  Court  cannot \nidentify any relief short of enjoining the distribution of Section 1005’s payments \nand  debt  relief  that  will  maintain  the  status  quo  and  provide  Plaintiff  the \nopportunity to obtain any relief at all. As noted by the Supreme Court, “[o]nce a \nconstitutional violation is found, a federal court is required to tailor the scope of \nthe remedy to fit the nature and extent of the constitutional violation.” Dayton Bd. \nof Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 420, 97 S. Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977) \n(internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 \nU.S. 682, 702, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979) (noting, in the context of a \nnationwide class action, “the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of \nthe violation established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff class.”). \nPlaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim that Section \n1005 is unconstitutional and, if implemented, would deprive him of his right to \nequal protection under the law. The implementation of Section 1005 will be swift \nand irreversible, meaning the only way to avoid Plaintiff’s irreparable harm is to \nenjoin the program. The Court can envision no other remedy that will prevent the \n \n19  In her decision, Judge Howard noted some of the criticism of nationwide injunctions.   \n [T]he Court proceeds with great caution in determining that an injunction that \nwill have nationwide effect is warranted. Justices Gorsuch and Thomas have \nquestioned a district courts’ authority to enter nationwide injunctions, see, e.g., \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. N.Y., ––– U.S. ––––, 140 S. Ct. 599, 599-601, 206 \nL.Ed.2d 115 (2020) (concurring opinion); see also Trump v. Hawaii, ––– U.S. –––\n–, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2423, 201 L.Ed.2d 775 (2018) (noting the “disposition of the \ncase makes it unnecessary to consider the propriety of the nationwide scope of the \ninjunction,” leaving the question unresolved), and courts and scholars have been \ncritical of their use. See Trump, 138 S. Ct. at 2429 (collecting scholarly articles \ncriticizing the issuance of nationwide preliminary injunctions). \nWynn, 2021 WL 2580678, at *17 (footnotes omitted).  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 41   Filed 07/08/21   Page 24 of 25    PageID 879\nlikely  violation  of  Plaintiff’s  constitutional  right  which  absent  an  injunction \ncannot be remedied in this action. \n \nWynn, 2021 WL 2580678, at *17 (footnotes omitted). See also Faust at *5 (quoting City of \nChicago v. Barr, 961 F.3d 882, 916–17 (7th Cir. 2020) (“While universal injunctions are rare, \nthey ‘can be necessary to provide complete relief to plaintiffs, to protect similarly-situated \nnonparties, and to avoid the chaos and confusion that comes from a patchwork of injunctions.’”))  \nFaust also found that a nation-wide injunction was appropriate because “Defendants’ proposal to \nset aside funds to pay off any of Plaintiffs’ qualified loans is unworkable. If the USDA forgave \nPlaintiffs’ loans, it would be required to forgive every farmer’s loan, since the only criteria for \nloan forgiveness is the applicant’s race.”20  Id. Therefore, the only way to preserve the status quo \nis for the Court to issue a nationwide injunction. \n  Accordingly,  Plaintiff’s  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction  is  GRANTED,  and \nDefendants  are  hereby  enjoined  from  implementing  Section  1005.  Defendants  Thomas  J. \nVilsack, in his official capacity as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and Zach Ducheneaux, in his \nofficial capacity as Administrator, Farm Service Agency, their agents, employees, and all others \nacting in concert with them, who receive actual notice of this Order by personal service or \notherwise, are immediately enjoined from issuing any payments, loan assistance, or debt relief \npursuant to Section 1005(a)(2) of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 until further orders of \nthe Court. \n  The  government  has  not  opposed  Plaintiff’s  request  that  the  Court  waive  the  bond \nrequirement.  Therefore, Plaintiff will not be required to post a bond or other security.  \n \n20  The plaintiffs in Miller were granted class certification and did not seek a nationwide \ninjunction.

Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss claims two and \nthree of the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.  (ECF \nNo. 57.)  Plaintiff has filed a response to the motion (ECF No. 60), and Defendants have filed a \nreply to the response.  (ECF No. 65.) For the reasons set forth below, Defendant’s partial motion \nto dismiss is GRANTED. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 2 of 21    PageID 1190\nStandard of Review \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) motions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \n“come in two varieties: a facial attack or a factual attack.” O’Bryan v. Holy See, 556 F.3d 361, \n375 (6th Cir. 2009) (citation and quotation marks omitted). A facial attack, as in the present case, \n“questions merely the sufficiency of the pleading.” Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). In \nreviewing the facial attack, courts must accept all allegations as true, id., and when reviewing the \ncomplaint, we look for a “short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). “[C]onclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual \nconclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.” O’Bryan, 556 F.3d at 376 (citation \nomitted). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists.  See Moir v. Greater \nCleveland Reg’l Transit Auth., 895 F.2d 266, 269 (6th Cir. 1990) (explaining that, when “subject \nmatter  jurisdiction  is  challenged  pursuant  to Rule  12(b)(1),  the  plaintiff  has  the  burden  of \nproving jurisdiction in order to survive the motion”). \n  “Proper jurisdiction is a requirement in determining the validity of a claim, and as such, \nRule 12(b)(1) motions must be considered prior to any other challenges.” Lemke v. H&R Block \nMortg. Corp., 2012 WL 715894, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 6, 2012) (citing Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. \n678 (1946)); see also Moir, 895 F.2d at 269 (quoting Bell v. Hood for the proposition that, when \na defendant moves to dismiss under both Rule 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), the court should consider the \n12(b)(1) motion first because “the 12(b)(6) challenge becomes moot if this court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction.”). \n  Defendants  contend  that  this  Court  lacks  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  Plaintiff’s \nclaims for the following reasons: (1) Plaintiff lacks standing to bring his claim; (2) Plaintiff fails \nto allege an actual or imminent injury-in-fact; (3) the claim is not ripe for review; and (4) there is \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 3 of 21    PageID 1191\nno private right of action under Section 1005.  The Court finds Defendants’ contentions to be \nmeritorious and grants Defendants’ partial motion to dismiss because it lacks subject matter over \nthe complaint.  Accordingly, the Court will not address the portion of Defendants’ motion \nseeking dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). \n  Background \n  As discussed in the order granting Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction,1  Plaintiff \ncontends that Section 1005 of the ARPA, facially and as applied, violates the guarantee of equal \nprotection of the law under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. (Order, ECF \nNo. 41.)  In that order, the Court described the background of this litigation.   The Court will not \nreiterate that description except to point out that Section 1005 allots funds for debt relief to \n“socially disadvantaged” farmers and ranchers2 as part of a broad relief package designed to \nalleviate  economic  burdens  caused  by  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic.  “Socially \ndisadvantaged”  is  interpreted  to  mean  the  racial  classifications  of  “Black,  American \nIndian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, or Asian, or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.”  Farmers, such as \nPlaintiff, who are white/Caucasian are not considered to be socially disadvantaged and, thus, are \nnot eligible for debt relief regardless of their individual circumstances.  \n  Plaintiff, who has two USDA loans that had outstanding balances as of January 1, 2021, \nfiled this complaint, contending that the government should be enjoined from carrying out \nSection 1005’s debt relief program because it is entirely based on race, and the denial of a \ngovernment benefit based on race is a violation of the equal protection guarantee. Plaintiff has \n \n1  On July 8, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined \ndisbursement of Section 1005 funds on a nationwide basis pending resolution of this case on the \nmerits.  \n2 Although Section 1005 refers to both “farmers and ranchers,” the briefing has focused on \nfarmers.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 4 of 21    PageID 1192\nbrought three claims.  In his first claim, Plaintiff asserts that the USDA’s interpretation of the \nterm  “socially  disadvantaged  farmers  and  ranchers”  in  Section  1005  to  include  only  those \nfarmers who fall within certain racial groups violates the constitutional guarantee of equal \nprotection.   \n  In claims two and three, Plaintiff challenges the USDA’s determination that recipients of \nSection 1005 debt relief will remain eligible for future USDA loans.  Plaintiff contends that a \nborrower who accepts the relief authorized by Section 1005 is forever precluded from obtaining \na  future  USDA  loan  because  7  U.S.C.  §  2008h(b)(1)  bars  the  Secretary  from  making  or \nguaranteeing loans to past recipients of debt forgiveness. 3  Plaintiff interprets 7 U.S.C. § 2008h,4 \na pre-ARPA statute, as barring the USDA from making loans to borrowers who receive “debt \nforgiveness” and prohibiting the USDA from granting any additional loans to borrowers who \naccept Section 1005 relief.  Plaintiff asserts that the USDA plans to “disregard” the statute and \nthe alleged bar. In claim two, Plaintiff alleges that this purported disregard of the statutory \nprohibition is an unconstitutional equal protection violation.  That is, because Section 1005 is a \nrace-conscious remedial measure, the USDA’s alleged waiver of the statutory eligibility bar is \nnecessarily a race conscious action as well, according to Plaintiff. In claim three, Plaintiff alleges \nthat the USDA plans to act unlawfully in violation of the statute because it lacks the authority to \ntreat anyone who receives loan forgiveness as eligible for future loans; thus, the USDA plans to \n“illegally allow[ ] future eligibility.”   \n  Plaintiff’s claims two and three rest on his assumption that Section 1005 loan payments \nare a form of “debt forgiveness” that triggers the general statutory bar against additional loans. \n \n3  The government disagrees with this interpretation.  For the purpose of deciding this motion \nonly, the Court will assume that Plaintiff’s interpretation of 7 U.S.C. § 2008h is correct.   \n4  “[T]he Secretary may not make [or guarantee] a loan . . . to a borrower that has received debt \nforgiveness on” certain USDA direct or guaranteed loans.  7 U.S.C. § 2008h(b)(1). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 5 of 21    PageID 1193\nPlaintiff seeks a declaration from this Court that providing further USDA loans to those who \nreceive forgiveness under Section 1005 is illegal and unconstitutional, both facially and as \napplied.   \n  As noted by Defendants, this case is one of twelve brought in courts around the country \nthat  challenge  the  implementation  of  Section  1005  on  equal  protection  grounds:  Miller  v. \nVilsack, 4:21-cv-595 (N.D. Tex.); Wynn v. Vilsack, 3:21-cv-514 (M.D. Fla.); Faust v. Vilsack, \n1:21-cv-548 (E.D. Wis.); Carpenter v. Vilsack, 21-cv-103-F (D. Wyo.); McKinney v. Vilsack, \n2:21-cv-212 (E.D. Tex.); Kent v. Vilsack, 3:21-cv-540 (S.D. Ill.); Joyner v. Vilsack, 1:21-cv-1089 \n(W.D. Tenn.); Dunlap v. Vilsack, 2:21-cv-942 (D. Or.); Rogers v. Vilsack, 1:21-cv-1779 (D. \nColo.); Tiegs v. Vilsack, 3:21-cv-147 (D.N.D.); Nuest v. Vilsack, 21-cv-1572 (D. Minn.). \n  On July 2, 2021, the Miller Court certified two classes of farmers and ranchers bringing \nan  equal  protection  challenge  to  Section  1005  and  issued  an  injunction  preventing  the \ngovernment from disbursing Section 1005 funds during the pendency of the lawsuit. (Ex. A. to \nMot. to Stay, Order on Class Cert. & PI, ECF No. 45-1.)  Plaintiff is a member of the two classes \ncertified by Miller under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), and Defendants will be bound by any relief \ngranted to the classes with respect to Plaintiff should the classes’ equal protection claim prevail.5    \nBecause the classes in Miller were certified under Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiff cannot opt out of any \njudgment applicable to the classes. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 361-63 \n(2011) (Rule 23 “provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does \nnot even oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.”) \n \n5 Although Miller certified two classes, the classes were specific to the plaintiffs’ challenge to \nthe enforcement of the racial exclusions in Section 1005, i.e., Plaintiff’s claim one.  (Miller \nOrder at p. 13.) \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 6 of 21    PageID 1194\n  On August 2, 2021, this Court denied Defendants’ motion to stay proceedings pending \nresolution of the Miller class action, finding that  \nthe interests of the Miller plaintiffs are not completely aligned with Plaintiff’s \ninterests, thus negating Defendants’ claim of duplicative lawsuits. Plaintiff has \nalleged in his complaint that loan forgiveness will bar him from obtaining future \nloans from the USDA. While the government’s position is that it can allow future \nloan eligibility for those who receive loan forgiveness under Section 1005, this \nCourt has not decided the issue, and the issue has not been raised in Miller.  \n \n(Order p. 3, ECF No. 49 (citation omitted.)) Thus, although Plaintiff will be bound by the \ndecision of the Miller Court on his first claim, claims two and three are not before that Court. \nInstead, Plaintiff is proceeding in this Court on those claims, and they are now the subject of \nDefendants’ partial motion to dismiss. \n  Analysis \nStanding   \n  Defendants first argue that Plaintiff lacks Article III standing to challenge the USDA’s \ndetermination that farmers who receive relief under Section 1005 will be eligible for future \nUSDA  loans.    “The  Constitution  grants  Article  III  courts  the  power  to  decide  ‘Cases’  or \n‘Controversies.’ Art. III, § 2” and “that constitutional phrase [is understood] to require that a case \nembody a genuine, live dispute between adverse parties, thereby preventing the federal courts \nfrom issuing advisory opinions.”  Carney v. Adams, 141 S. Ct. 493, 498 (2020). A genuine case \nor controversy exists if a litigant has a “personal stake in the outcome” that is “distinct from a \ngenerally available grievance about government.” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1923 (2018) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The standing inquiry under Article III is meant \nto ensure “that there is a real need to exercise the power of judicial review in order to protect the \ninterests of the complaining party.” Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009) \n(citation omitted). When “that need does not exist, allowing courts to oversee legislative or \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 7 of 21    PageID 1195\nexecutive action would significantly alter the allocation of power away from a democratic form \nof government.” Id. (alterations and citation omitted). \n  To establish a personal stake in the case, the litigant must prove: “(i) that he suffered an \ninjury in fact that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury was \nlikely caused by the defendant; and (iii) that the injury would likely be redressed by judicial \nrelief.” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2203 (2021).  “In the context of claims for \ninjunctive or declaratory relief, the threatened injury in fact must be concrete and particularized, \nas well as actual and imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Sullivan v. Benningfield, 920 \nF.3d 401, 407-08 (6th Cir. 2019) (citations and quotations omitted).  The plaintiff bears the \nburden of showing that all three elements are met for each claim and for each form of relief \nsought.  See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 358 n.6 (1996) (“Standing is not dispensed in \ngross.”).    That  is,  Plaintiff  must  “demonstrate  standing  for  each  claim  he  seeks  to  press.” \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006). The Court finds that Plaintiff has not \ndone so in the present case. \n  Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not alleged an injury-in-fact sufficient to establish \nstanding  with  respect  to  claims  two  and  three.  Defendants  contend  that  Plaintiff  alleges  a \n“generalized grievance” based on his claim that the USDA will not follow the law with respect to \nother loan applicants. Defendants also contend that Plaintiff’s “speculation” that the USDA plans \nto disregard the purported limits on its loan-making authority when it comes to evaluating future \nloan applications of minority farmers is not an injury that is concrete and particularized to \nPlaintiff.  Defendants label Plaintiff’s claims two and three as a request for an advisory opinion \nregarding the USDA’s authority to approve hypothetical loan applications.  Defendants also \nclaim that Plaintiff’s alleged injuries are not imminent but, instead, are based on a “hypothetical \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 8 of 21    PageID 1196\nchain of events that may not even occur.” Additionally, Defendants contend that the equal \nprotection aspect of Plaintiff’s second claim does not provide for an injury independent of his \nequal protection claim (claim one) that is the subject of the Miller class action.  \n  Looking at claim two first, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff has alleged no \ninjury specific to a “debt forgiveness” equal protection claim.  Instead, claim two is derivative of \nclaim one which also alleges a denial of Plaintiff’s right to equal protection - there is no claim \ntwo without claim one.  In claim two, Plaintiff couches his allegations concerning the USDA’s \nalleged future violation of its statutory authority in terms of differential treatment; that is, he \nasserts that the manner in which the USDA allegedly plans to disregard its statutory authority \nviolates his constitutional right to equal protection. According to Plaintiff, the USDA intends to \nselectively waive the purported bar against receiving future loans which, he contends, is a race-\nconscious action in violation of equal protection because Section 1005 itself is race-conscious.   \n  In support of his argument, Plaintiff points to Vitolo v. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353 (6th Cir. \n2021), which explained that  \none form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause is being forced to compete \nin a race-based system that may prejudice the plaintiff. The government’s use of \nracial preferences causes that injury. And that injury is redressable by a decision \nordering the government not to grant priority consideration based on the race of \napplicants.  \n \nId. at 359 (citations omitted).  Thus, any classification that makes it “more difficult for members \nof one [racial] group to obtain a benefit” is an injury sufficient to confer standing. Id. (quoting \nNe. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, \n666 (1993)). To establish standing, a party “need only demonstrate that it is able and ready” to \nengage in activity “and that a discriminatory policy prevents it from doing so on an equal basis.” \nId. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 9 of 21    PageID 1197\n  While Plaintiff has correctly stated the law, he fails to explain how he suffers an equal \nprotection injury specific to his challenge, at claim two, to the USDA’s determination that \nSection 1005 recipients will remain eligible for future loans. Instead of showing an injury \ndistinct to claim two, Plaintiff relies on his alleged injuries stemming from his equal protection \nchallenge  in  claim  one.  Defendants  correctly  point  out  that  a  ruling  on  Plaintiff’s  equal \nprotection challenge to Section 1005 (claim one) will resolve the equal protection allegations \nasserted with respect to future loan approvals (claim two) regardless of how the Court rules. If \nthe Miller Court rules in favor of the classes and invalidates Section 1005, then Plaintiff’s claim \ntwo becomes moot.  If the Miller Court rules in favor the defendants and finds that Section 1005 \ndoes not violate the equal protection clause, then Plaintiff’s claim two likewise becomes moot \nbecause there will be a judicial determination of no equal protection violation. \n  Plaintiff’s response to Defendants’ motion as to why claim two should not be dismissed \nsupports this analysis. \nIn other words, the government gives access to a benefit to some farmers but not \nothers, based on race. The resulting injury is that the government treats Plaintiff \ndifferently and places him at a distinct competitive disadvantage, which Plaintiff \npleaded clearly. (See id. at ¶ 63 (“Plaintiff is disadvantaged relative to similarly \nsituated farmers in that they can receive full loan forgiveness, plus 20%, and still \nreceive further loans to upgrade their farming operations.”)) Much as in Vitolo, \n“[t]he injury here is ‘the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of \nthe barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.’” 999 F.3d at 358-59 \n(quoting Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. Contractors, 508 U.S. at 666). \nAccordingly,  Plaintiff  has  pleaded  an  injury  arising  from  “being  forced  to \ncompete in a race-based system that may prejudice” him. Parents Involved in \nCmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 719 (2007). \n \n(Resp. p. 15, ECF No. 60.)    \n  Plaintiff’s argument is centered around the injury he alleges in claim one.  Plaintiff does \nnot allege that he is “able and ready” to apply for new loans but that the government has enacted \na “discriminatory policy [that] prevents [him] from doing so on an equal basis” with other \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 10 of 21    PageID 1198\napplicants. He does not allege that providing Section 1005 relief to socially disadvantaged \nfarmers will bar him from obtaining new loans — only that it will bar the socially disadvantaged \nfarmers from doing so.  This is not sufficient to create standing on claim two. \n  Much of Plaintiff’s response is based on the premise that, if the plaintiffs in Miller \nprevail, Section 1005 may be rewritten to include debt relief for all farmers with USDA loans \nand not just those defined as socially disadvantaged, thus subjecting Plaintiff to the forgiveness \nof  his  own  USDA  loans  and  consequent  ineligibility  for  future  loans  under  7  U.S.C.  § \n2008h(b)(1).6    However, Plaintiff has pointed to no authority that would allow a court to rewrite \nSection 1005. The stated purpose of Section 1005 is to help socially disadvantaged farmers and \nranchers.  Judicially rewriting the statute to include all farmers and ranchers would subvert that \npurpose and would require new legislation.  See Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, \n478 U.S. 833, 841 (1986) (citations omitted) (“[A]lthough this Court will often strain to construe \nlegislation so as to save it against constitutional attack, it must not and will not carry this to the \npoint of perverting the purpose of a statute ... or judicially rewriting it.”) Accordingly, Plaintiff \nfails to establish standing to raise his equal protection claim in claim two after having raised it in \nclaim one. \n  In claim three, Plaintiff alleges that the USDA plans to approve future loan applications \nsubmitted by Section 1005 recipients in violation of a purported statutory prohibition at 7 U.S.C. \n§ 2008h against providing future loans for anyone who has received loan forgiveness.  However, \nPlaintiff’s claim that the USDA plans to violate its statutory authority when it evaluates other \nfarmers’ future eligibility for loans is not concrete and particularized to Plaintiff. The Supreme \nCourt “has repeatedly held that an asserted right to have the government act in accordance with \n \n6  This issue is also discussed below in the ripeness section. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 11 of 21    PageID 1199\nthe law is not sufficient standing alone to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.” Whitmore v. \nArkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 160 (1990); see also TransUnion, 141 S. Ct. at 2206-07 (explaining that \nmerely seeking to ensure a defendant’s compliance with the law is not sufficient to establish \nstanding when a plaintiff does not otherwise suffer a concrete personal harm due to the allegedly \nunlawful  conduct).  Plaintiff  alleges  nothing  more  than  his  disagreement  with  the  USDA’s \nconclusion that Section 1005 recipients will remain eligible for future USDA loans.  Any alleged \ninterest on Plaintiff’s part in the USDA’s proper application of that statute does not distinguish \nhim from “the public at large.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 573-74 (1992). The \napproval of another farmer’s loan application, whether properly or improperly approved, does \nnot affect Plaintiff’s interests any more than it affects the interests of “every citizen” concerned \nwith the proper application of the laws. Id.  \n  Although Plaintiff does assert that he will suffer a competitive disadvantage if the USDA \napproves future loans for Section 1005 recipients, even though it allegedly lacks authority to do \nso, he does not allege that any farmer who might receive another loan in the future is competing \nwith his business.  Plaintiff’s bare assertion of competitive injury does not satisfy the concrete \nand particularized requirement and, instead, shows only that Plaintiff’s grievance is one “that he \nsuffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.” United States v. Richardson, \n418 U.S. 166, 172 (1974) (quoting Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488 (1923)); see also \nBinno v. Am. Bar Ass’n, 826 F.3d 338, 344 (6th Cir. 2016) (“Conclusory allegations do not \nsatisfy the requirements of Article III.”). \n   Additionally, Plaintiff’s alleged injury of a competitive disadvantage is too speculative \nand remote to satisfy Article III because it rests on uncertain, future events. Plaintiff must show \nmore than a “possible future injury;” instead, he must show that harm has actually occurred or is \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 12 of 21    PageID 1200\n“certainly impending.” Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 158.  Speculative or hypothetical future injuries \nare not sufficient to confer standing.  See, e.g., Legatus v. Sebelius, 988 F. Supp. 2d 794, 804 \n(E.D. Mich. 2013) (“Legatus focuses on the largely hypothetical competitive disadvantage it \nwould face as an employer . . . . Taken alone, as an undeveloped assertion, this injury may be too \nspeculative to confer standing.”)  Plaintiff’s claim three raises only a generalized grievance \nregarding the proper application of 7 U.S.C. § 2008h, and, therefore, he has failed to establish \nthat he suffers a concrete and particularized injury related to the USDA’s approval of loans \nallegedly in violation of the statute. \n  In summary, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to show that he has standing to \nchallenge the USDA’s authority to grant future loans to recipients of Section 1005 relief for both \nclaims two and three.    \nRipeness \n  The ripeness doctrine arises “both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from \nprudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.” Reno v. Catholic Soc. Servs., 509 U.S. \n43, 57 n.18 (1993). “The ripeness doctrine not only depends on the finding of a case and \ncontroversy and hence jurisdiction under Article III, but it also requires that the court exercise its \ndiscretion to determine if judicial resolution would be desirable under all of the circumstances.” \nBrown v. Ferro Corp., 763 F.2d 798, 801 (6th Cir. 1985). The “basic rationale” of the ripeness \ndoctrine “is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling \nthemselves in abstract disagreements . . . and also to protect [entities] from judicial interference \nuntil a[ ] . . . decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the \nchallenging parties.” Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148–49 (1967), abrogated on other \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 13 of 21    PageID 1201\ngrounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977). “A claim is not ripe for adjudication if it \nrests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at \nall.”  Texas  v.  United  States,  523  U.S.  296,  300  (1998)  (citations  omitted);  see  also  Lake \nCarriers’ Ass’n v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 506 (1972) (stating that the ripeness doctrine asks \nwhether “there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of \nsufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment”). \n  Ripeness is present when “an injury that has not yet occurred is sufficiently likely to \nhappen to justify judicial intervention” or “when the court would be in no better position to \nadjudicate the issues in the future than it is now.” Pearson v. Holder, 624 F.3d 682, 684 (5th Cir.  \n2010). A “future injury” will be deemed ripe if either “the injury is certainly impending” or \n“there is substantial risk that the harm will occur.” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. \n149, 158 (2014); see also Caprock Plains Fed. Bank Ass’n v. Farm Credit Admin., 843 F.2d 840, \n845 (5th Cir. 1988) (concluding that “too many ifs” that render an injury a “mere potential[ity],” \nnot  just  one  or  two  that  may  render  such  a  result  into  a  substantial  possibility  or  even  a \nprobability, will make a case unripe). \n  In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial review, the court must \nconsider “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision” and “the hardship of withholding court \nconsideration.” Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808 (2003); see \nalso Norton v. Ashcroft, 298 F.3d 547, 554 (6th Cir. 2002) (explaining that, to determine whether \na claim is ripe, a court must consider (1) the likelihood that the injury alleged by the plaintiff will \never occur; (2) whether the factual record is sufficiently developed to allow for adjudication; and \n(3) the hardship to the parties from refusing consideration). For pre-enforcement challenges, as \nin the present case, a case is ordinarily ripe for review “only if the probability of the future event \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 14 of 21    PageID 1202\noccurring is substantial and of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a \ndeclaratory judgment.” Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of America v. Magaw, 132 F.3d 272, 284 (6th Cir. \n1997).  The  ripeness  doctrine  acknowledges  the  problem  inherent  in  adjudicating  a  dispute \n“anchored in future events that may not occur as anticipated, or at all.” Id. \n  The  ripeness  doctrine  applies  to  declaratory  judgment  actions.  “It  is  clear  that  the \ndeclaratory judgment procedure is available in the federal courts only in cases involving actual \ncontroversies and may not be used to obtain an advisory opinion in a controversy not yet arisen.” \nMarek v. Navient Corp., 2017 WL 32943, at *1 (N.D. Ohio Jan. 4, 2017) (quoting United Pub. \nWorkers of Am. (C.I.O.) v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 116 (1947)). “The requirements of standing, \nripeness, and mootness guard against the issuing of advisory opinions.” Celebrezze v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Transp., 766 F.2d 228, 232 (6th Cir. 1985); see also Briggs v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 61 \nF.3d 487, 493 (6th Cir. 1995) (noting that a court is “obliged under Article III to limit its \njurisdiction  to  ripe  cases,  to  avoid  issuing  advisory  opinions  based  upon  hypothetical \nsituations.”). \n  Doctrines  of  ripeness  and  standing  “unquestionably  []  overlap.”  Warshak  v.  United \nStates, 532 F.3d 521, 525 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc). “Like standing, ripeness is drawn from . . . \nArticle III limitations on judicial power” and “serves to avoid premature adjudication of legal \nquestions and to prevent courts from entangling themselves in abstract debates that may turn out \ndifferently in different settings.” Id. at 525–26 (citations omitted). The ripeness analysis consists \nof two parts. First, courts ask whether the claim is “fit[] . . . for judicial decision,” Abbott Labs., \n387 U.S. at 148, or, in other words, whether it “arises in a concrete factual context and concerns \na dispute that is likely to come to pass.” Warshak, 532 F.3d at 525. Second, courts ask whether \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 15 of 21    PageID 1203\n“withholding court consideration” would cause “hardship to the parties.” Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. \nat 149.  \n  Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s claims are not “fit” for judicial review for the same \nreasons that he fails to allege an injury-in-fact.  They argue that his claims turn on “contingent \nfuture events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.” Trump v. New \nYork, 141 S. Ct. 530, 535 (2020) (quotation omitted). Defendants outline the following chain of \nevents that would need to occur in order for Plaintiff’s claims to be ripe for judicial review. The \nUSDA  would  have  to  disburse  Section  1005  funds  to  socially  disadvantaged  farmers  and \nranchers; one of those recipients would then have to apply for another USDA loan; the USDA \nwould have to approve that loan application; and the borrower would have to compete with \nPlaintiff in the relevant market.  The Court agrees with Defendants that, whether this series of \nevents will occur, let alone whether the events occur imminently and in such a way as to injure \nPlaintiff, is “‘no more than conjecture’ at this time.” Id. (quoting City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, \n461 U.S. 95, 108 (1983)).  Moreover, as mentioned previously, a ruling either way by the Miller \nCourt will moot Plaintiff’s claim two, and a ruling in favor of the classes will moot Plaintiff’s \nclaim three. \nPlaintiff has responded that his equal protection injury is ripe because it is a barrier to his \neligibility for future loans. He argues that it would cause a hardship to him if the question of his \nfuture loan eligibility were not resolved now because the government has advanced the argument \nthat Plaintiff will become eligible for relief under Section 1005 if the Miller classes prevail, thus, \nrending him ineligible for future USDA loans.  This Court has previously rejected the argument \nthat, at some point, courts could “re-write” Section 1005 to include Plaintiff. (Ord. Grt’ing \nPrelim. Inj., ECF No. 41.) \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 16 of 21    PageID 1204\nThe legislative intent of Section 1005 is to remedy past discrimination suffered by \nthose farmers defined as “socially disadvantaged” and to give those farmers a \nmore level playing field with non-minority farmers. Opening eligibility for debt \nrelief to all farmers would gut that intent. Additionally, Defendants have not \npointed  to  a  severability  clause  in  the  ARPA  or  Section  1005  to  show  that \nCongress would rather have race-neutral debt relief for farmers than no debt relief \nat all. \n \n(Id. at pp. 20-21.) Accordingly, even if the Miller classes prevail, Plaintiff will not be entitled to \ndebt relief under Section 1005. \n  Plaintiff also contends that his alleged injury is not a “some-day” injury because the \ngovernment approved recipients of forgiveness for new loans prior to the issuance of the first \ninjunction.  The government has admitted that “[e]ligible recipients of payments under Section \n1005 may be approved for, and have been approved for, new FSA loans on the condition that the \nARPA-eligible debt is paid in full prior to loan closing.” However, as noted below, the approval \nwas limited to four recipients as part of a processing test. Any injury suffered by Plaintiff as the \nresult of this limited approval is de minimis.  \n  In essence, in claims two and three, Plaintiff seeks an advisory opinion that the USDA \nmust follow the law in the future if certain events occur. However, the record does not contain \nevidence that Defendants have taken steps to provide future loans to socially disadvantaged \nfarmers or ranchers despite their obtaining either “debt relief” (as Section 1005 is interpreted by \nDefendants)  or  “debt  forgiveness”  (as  Section  1005  is  interpreted  by  Plaintiff),  and,  thus, \nPlaintiff’s request for a declaratory judgment is the type of “premature adjudication” that the \nripeness doctrine is meant to avoid. See Ky. Press Ass’n, Inc. v. Kentucky, 454 F.3d 505, 509 (6th \nCir. 2006) (citations omitted) (“Ripeness is a justiciability doctrine designed to prevent the \ncourts, through premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements. \nRipeness becomes an issue when a case is anchored in future events that may not occur as \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 17 of 21    PageID 1205\nanticipated, or at all.”).7 Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s claims two and three are not \nripe for judicial review. \nPrivate Right of Action as to Claim Three \n  According to Defendant, even if Plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of Article III, he \nstill lacks a private right of action to enforce any asserted statutory limits on the USDA’s \nauthority to provide future loans to those who have received debt forgiveness because Congress \nhas not granted Plaintiff a private right of action to enforce 7 U.S.C. § 2008h against the USDA.8 \nDefendant correctly notes that, “private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by \nCongress,” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286 (2001), and that “the fact that a federal \nstatute has been violated and some person harmed does not automatically give rise to a private \ncause of action in favor of that person.” Touche Ross & Co. v. Reddington, 442 U.S. 560, 568 \n(1979) (quoting Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 688 (1979)). “Before individuals \nmay file such a lawsuit, they must identify a statutory cause of action that allows them to do so.” \nOhlendorf v. United Food & Com. Workers Int’l Union, Loc. 876, 883 F.3d 636, 640 (6th Cir. \n2018) (quoting Alexander, 532 U.S. at 286). The cause of action may be express or implied. Id. \nThe statute at issue in claim three is 7 U.S.C. § 2008h, the provision that Plaintiff alleges \nprevents the USDA from making loans to recipients of debt forgiveness. Clearly, that provision \ncontains no express right for a private party to bring a claim in federal court to enforce its terms. \nNor does the statute create an implied right of action.  \n \n7    The  government  acknowledges  that,  prior  to the  issuance  of  any  injunction,  the  USDA \nprocessed Section 1005 payments for four recipients in efforts to test its payment procedures. \n(Cobb Decl. ¶¶ 29-31, ECF No. 31-1.) Since then, the USDA has not paid off those borrowers’ \nloans or approved them for additional loans. \n8  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that the government’s private right of action argument applies \nonly to claim three which is a statutory claim.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 18 of 21    PageID 1206\nTo find an implied right of action, the Court must be able to “infer that Congress created \na private right and provided for a private remedy, all without taking the conventional route of \ndoing so expressly.” Id. Legislative intent “is determinative” in this regard. Alexander, 532 U.S. \nat 286. Without a private remedy, “a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create \none, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the \nstatute.” Id. at 286-87; see also Mich. Corr. Org. v. Mich. Dep’t of Corr., 774 F.3d 895, 903 (6th \nCir. 2014) (“If a statute fails to provide a private remedy, the federal courts may not create what \nCongress did not.”). \nIn this case, the Court cannot find that Congress intended to grant a private right of action \nin 7 U.S.C. § 2008h for borrowers, or for anyone else, to enforce any limitations on the USDA’s \nauthority to grant loans to recipients of debt forgiveness. The statute does not purport to protect \nany right held by Plaintiff, or any other borrower, that would entitle him to any form of relief. \nSee  Stew  Farm,  Ltd.  v.  Nat.  Res.  Conservation  Serv.,  767  F.3d  554,  565  (6th  Cir.  2014) \n(considering whether a statute was focused on the protection of certain individuals as a factor in \ndetermining whether the statute grants those individuals a private right of action).  \nMoreover, granting Plaintiff a private remedy would have no relation to any purpose \nfurthered by general statutory limitations on the USDA’s authority to make loans to recipients of \ndebt forgiveness, which has to do with minimizing losses to the Secretary, e.g., 7 U.S.C. § \n1991(a)(12)(A) (defining “debt forgiveness” as an action that “results in a loss to the Secretary”); \nid. § 2001(a) (directing the Secretary to avoid incurring a loss “to the maximum extent possible” \nwhen  considering  write-down  options).  These  statutory  provisions  are  not  concerned  with \nprotecting farmers from competition from other farmers. See Stew Farm, 767 F.3d at 565 (“[T]he \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 19 of 21    PageID 1207\nstatute [at issue] does not focus on the individuals protected, thereby further suggesting no intent \non the part of Congress to create a private right of action.”)   \n Plaintiff responds that the government is incorrect that he lacks a right of action to \nchallenge its stated intention to provide future loans to recipients of loan forgiveness on statutory \n(claim three) grounds. In support of his argument, he relies on the Court’s well-established \nability to issue an injunction to stop the government from acting illegally. See Ex parte Young, \n209  U.S.  123,  167-68  (1908)  (permitting  suit  in  federal  court  against  state  officials  for \nconstitutional  violations);  see  also  Philadelphia  Co.  v.  Stimson,  223  U.S.  605,  620  (1912) \n(extending the Ex parte Young principle to federal government officials). According to Plaintiff, \nEx parte Young and its progeny establish that, whenever a state or federal official allegedly acts \nin violation of federal law, a private party may seek declaratory or injunctive relief in federal \ncourt to halt the unlawful act.  Plaintiff asserts that it is unnecessary to show a private right of \naction under a statute when a plaintiff requests prospective equitable relief to halt an illegal \naction.9   \n  Plaintiff is mistaken. The Court’s equitable power does not itself give rise to a cause of \naction. See Mich. Corr. Org., 774 F.3d at 905 (“[E]ven in a case involving relief sought under Ex \nparte Young, courts must determine whether Congress intended private parties to enforce the \nstatute by private injunction or for that matter by a declaratory judgment.”). The power to grant \ninjunctive or declaratory relief is implicated only “if the plaintiff already has a cause of action \nfrom somewhere else.” Id.; see also Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 239 (1979) (“[T]he \n \n9  Plaintiff acknowledges that, if Congress had created a remedial scheme for the enforcement of \nits bar on future loans, see Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S 247, 256 n.3 \n(2011), or indicated an “intent to foreclose” equitable relief, see Armstrong v. Exceptional Child \nCtr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 328 (2015), then Plaintiff would be left with the legislatively specified \nremedies. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 20 of 21    PageID 1208\nquestion whether a litigant has a ‘cause of action’ is analytically distinct and prior to the question \nof what relief, if any, a litigant may be entitled to receive.”) Only if Congress has “created a \nspecific and uniquely federal right or remedy, enforceable in a federal court of equity,” may \ninjunctive or declaratory relief issue. Safe Streets Alliance v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 902 \n(10th Cir. 2017) (quoting Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 237 (1972)).  \n  Plaintiff has not shown that Congress granted him a private right and a private remedy \neither expressly or implicitly to enforce any prohibition in 7 U.S.C. § 2008h against providing \nloans to recipients of debt forgiveness. Because Plaintiff has no private right of action to enforce \n7 U.S.C. § 2008h against the USDA, Defendant’s motion to dismiss claim three on this ground is \ngranted.  \nPlaintiff’s Request for Leave to Amend the Complaint \n \nPlaintiff has asked the Court for leave to amend his complaint if the Court grants the \ngovernment’s motion for partial dismissal.  In deciding a motion to amend, a court generally will \n“freely give leave when justice so requires” pursuant to Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. “Factors that may affect [a Rule 15(a)] determination include undue delay in filing, \nlack of notice to the opposing party, bad faith by the moving party, repeated failure to cure \ndeficiencies by previous amendment, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of the \namendment.” Wade v. Knoxville Utils. Bd., 259 F.3d 452, 459 (6th Cir. 2001).  \nHere, Plaintiff has not specified what amendments he would make or explained how such \namendments would affect the outcome of the issues raised in Defendants’ motion. Nor has he \ncomplied with the Local Rules of this Court in submitting a proposed order or certificate of \nconsultation  in  support  of  his  request.  The  Court,  therefore,  denies  Plaintiff’s  unsupported \nrequest for leave to amend.   See, e.g., Tolliver v. Collins, 2011 WL 4916193, at *2 (S.D. Ohio \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 72   Filed 01/26/22   Page 21 of 21    PageID 1209\nOct. 14, 2011) (denying motion to amend, in part, because “Plaintiff’s motion is not sufficiently \nparticular as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 7(b)); Williams v. Fund, 2016 WL \n1060410, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 17, 2016) (denying to amend and noting that “Plaintiffs do not \nspecify which claims they seek to pursue against Dawood, but state only generally that they wish \nto add him as a defendant”). \nSummary and Conclusion \nDefendants’ motion for partial dismissal is GRANTED, and Plaintiff’s claims two and \nthree are hereby dismissed.  Plaintiff’s request for leave to amend the complaint is DENIED.  \nThe Court will entertain a renewed motion by Defendants to stay this action’s remaining claim \none pending the resolution of the Miller v.

Plaintiff asserted that he would have been eligible \nfor debt relief for his farm loans under § 1005 but for the fact that he does not fall within one of \nthe racial or ethnic groups considered “socially disadvantaged.” He filed suit asserting that § 1005 \nviolated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, and he \nsought declaratory and injunctive relief, costs and fees, and nominal damages. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 2 of 9    PageID 1638\nPlaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction.  After a hearing and with opposition from the \nGovernment, the Court granted Plaintiff’s request and enjoined disbursement of § 1005 funds on \na nationwide basis pending resolution of the case on the merits on July 8, 2021. This Court’s \ninjunction was preceded by similar preliminary injunctions in the Middle District of Florida, Wynn \nv. Vilsack, 3:21-cv-514 (M.D. Fla. June 23, 2021), and in the Northern District of Texas, Miller v. \nVilsack, 4:21-cv-595 (N.D. Tex. July 1, 2021). Miller certified two classes at the same time that it \nentered class-wide preliminary relief.  Plaintiff was a member of the classes in Miller. The Court \ninitially denied the Government’s motion to stay pending the outcome of the Miller class action \nbut then reconsidered that decision and stayed the matter. \nOn September 6, 2022, the Government filed a notice that § 1005 had been repealed by the \nInflation Reduction Act of 2022, thus mooting the actions challenging § 1005. See Pub. L. No. \n117-169, § 22008 (2022).  Consequently, the Miller class action was dismissed.  Subsequently, the \nparties in this case submitted a joint stipulation of dismissal, and judgment was entered on \nSeptember 15, 2022.  \nPlaintiff has now filed a motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to the Equal Access to \nJustice Act (“EAJA”), 28 U.S.C. § 2412, and Local Rule 54.1. (ECF No. 85.) Plaintiff seeks fees, \ncosts, and expenses in the amount of $44,117.00.  The Government has responded and opposes \nthe motion.  (ECF No. 88.)  Plaintiff has filed a reply to the Government’s response. (ECF No. \n91.)   Subsequently, the Court entered an order requiring additional briefing by the parties in light \nof Tennessee State Conf. of NAACP v. Hargett, 53 F.4th 406 (6th Cir. 2022). (ECF No. 93.) In that \ndecision, a divided panel upheld the district court’s award of attorney fee to the plaintiffs as \nprevailing parties even though the Tennessee legislature repealed the statutory provisions that the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 3 of 9    PageID 1639\ndistrict court had enjoined, thereby rendering the lawsuit moot.1 The Government has filed its \nadditional briefing (ECF No. 94), as has Plaintiff. (ECF No. 95.) For the reasons set forth below, \nPlaintiff’s Motion is DENIED. \nUnder the EAJA, the Court shall “award to a prevailing party . . . fees and other expenses \n. . . incurred by the party in any civil action . . ., including proceedings for judicial review of agency \naction, brought by or against the United States . . ., unless the Court finds that the position of the \nUnited States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.”  28 \nU.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  “The party seeking fees bears the burden of proving that it was a \nprevailing party with respect to the work done to generate them.” United States v. Tennessee, 780 \nF.3d 332, 336 (6th Cir. 2015). The Government then bears the burden of proving that its position \nwas substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust. Caremore, Inc. v. \nNLRB, 150 F.3d 628, 629 (6th Cir. 1998). \nPlaintiff contends that he is entitled to attorney fees because he is the prevailing party in \nthis action since he obtained a preliminary injunction even though the injunction was later mooted \nby the repeal of § 1005. He also contends that the Government’s defense of § 1005 was not \nsubstantially justified, and he argues that there are no special circumstances that would make an \nEAJA award unjust. The Government has responded, inter alia, that Plaintiff was a member of the \nMiller class, and, by the time this Court entered a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff’s interests were \nalready protected by the nationwide injunction in Wynn and the class-wide injunction in Miller.  \n \n1 The motion for attorney fees in Hargett was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, whereas the \npresent motion is brought under the EAJA. However, the Supreme Court has stated that the \nstandards applicable to § 1988 fee awards “are generally applicable in all cases in which \nCongress has authorized an award of fees to a ‘prevailing party.’” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. \n424, 433 n.7 (1983); see also Richlin Sec. Serv. Co. v. Chertoff, 553 U.S. 571, 581-83 (2008) \n(applying § 1988 fee decisions to EAJA fee matter); INS v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 161 (1990) \n(applying Hensley to EAJA award). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 4 of 9    PageID 1640\nThe Government also asserts that it had a duty to defend § 1005 and, therefore, its position was \nsubstantially justified. 2  \nIt is undisputed that the only “success” that Plaintiff obtained in this Court was the issuance \nof the preliminary injunction.  After the preliminary injunction was issued, the Court stayed \ndiscovery, dismissed Plaintiffs’ additional loan-forgiveness claims, and then stayed the case \npending resolution of the Miller class action. Ultimately, as mentioned above, the entire case was \ndismissed by a joint stipulation of the parties.  Therefore, the issue for the Court is whether \nobtaining a preliminary injunction, without more, elevates a plaintiff to prevailing party status in \nlight of the ruling in Hargett.   The Court finds that it does not in that Hargett did not change the \nwell-established law of this circuit. \nTo be considered a prevailing party, a litigant must have “receive[d] at least some relief on \nthe merits of his claim” amounting to “a court-ordered change in the legal relationship between \nthe plaintiff and the defendant.” Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health & \nHum. Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603-04 (2001) (internal quotation marks and alterations in original \nomitted). Prior to Hargett, it was well-settled that a plaintiff who “wins a preliminary injunction \nand nothing more” is almost never a prevailing party, see McQueary v. Conway, 614 F.3d 591, \n604 (6th Cir. 2010) (“McQueary I”), and Hargett did not change this general principle.  See \nHargett, 53 F.4th at 410 (relying on the guidance of McQueary I and Buckhannon in determining \nwhether the plaintiff in that case was a “prevailing party”). \n \n2  Because the Court has found that Plaintiff is not a prevailing party for the purpose of an award \nof EAJA attorney fees, the Court need not reach the issue of whether the Government’s position \nwas substantially justified or whether Plaintiff should receive an award of costs. See 28 U.S.C. § \n2412(a)(1) (allowing a “prevailing party” to recover from the government certain costs \nassociated with the litigation under the EAJA). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 5 of 9    PageID 1641\nThe Supreme Court has identified “the material alteration of the legal relationship of the \nparties” as the “touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry,” Texas State Teachers Ass’n v. Garland \nIndep. School District, 489 U.S. 782, 792-93 (1989) - and “for an alteration of legal relationships \nto be considered material, . . . a plaintiff must ‘receive at least some relief on the merits of his \nclaim.’” Biodiversity Conservation All. v. Stem, 519 F.3d 1226, 1231 (10th Cir. 2008) (emphasis \nin original) (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987)). Thus, while preliminary \ninjunction recipients may sometimes be prevailing parties, the nature of preliminary relief, which \nusually does not create lasting change in the legal relationship between the parties, “will generally \ncounsel against fees.” McQueary I, 614 F.3d 597, 600-01 (quoting Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, \n86).  \nThe Supreme Court has specifically rejected the catalyst theory “under which a plaintiff \n‘prevailed’ if he ‘achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change \nin the defendant’s conduct,’ such as a legislative repeal of a challenged statutory provision.” \nMcQueary I, 614 F.3d at 597 (quoting Buckhannon, 532 U.S. at 601-02). That is, “‘a voluntary \nchange in the defendant’s conduct,’ such as a legislative repeal of a challenged statutory provision, \n. . . does not amount to a ‘court-ordered change in the legal relationship’ between the plaintiff and \ndefendant, as required to establish prevailing-party status.” McQueary I, 614 F.3d at 597 (quoting \nBuckhannon, 532 U.S. at 603-04).3  Instead, the Sixth Circuit applies a “contextual and case-\nspecific inquiry” to determine if a party who obtained only a preliminary injunction is entitled to \nattorney fees. McQueary I, 614 F.3d at 601. This approach asks whether the plaintiff obtained a \nchange to “the legal relationship between the parties” that was “court-ordered, material,” and \n \n3  Additionally, a plaintiff cannot claim to be a prevailing party if its success is ultimately \n“reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case.” Sole, 551 U.S. \nat 83. Those factors are not present in this case. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 6 of 9    PageID 1642\n“enduring.” Miller v. Caudill, 936 F.3d 442, 448 (6th Cir. 2019). A change is court-ordered if it is \ncaused by the preliminary injunction and not the defendant’s voluntary change in conduct. Id. It is \nmaterial if it “directly benefit[s]” the plaintiff by altering the defendant’s conduct toward him, and \nit is enduring if it is “irrevocable, meaning it . . . provided [the] plaintiff[] with everything [he] \nasked for.” Id.  \nTo illustrate this approach, the Government relies on the following cases. In Young v. City \nof Chicago, 202 F.3d 1000 (7th Cir. 2000), protestors obtained a preliminary “injunction to \nexercise their First Amendment rights at a specific time and place,” i.e., the 1996 Democratic \nNational Convention, and that injunction gave the protestors everything they needed. That is, the \nprotestors wanted to protest at the Convention, and the preliminary injunction allowed them to do \nso. Thus, an award of attorney fees was appropriate in Young. See McQueary I, 614 F.3d at 599 \n(explaining the holding in Young).4     \nIn Miller v. Caudill, the Court of Appeals found that same sex couples who obtained a \npreliminary injunction that gave them the immediate opportunity to obtain marriage licenses - and \nthey  did,  in  fact,  obtain  marriage  licenses  and  wed  -  were  prevailing  parties  because  that \nopportunity was the relief they sought and could not be taken away by any future action of the \ndefendants. 936 F.3d at 449 (“[T]he injunction gave plaintiffs all the court-ordered relief they \nneeded, [such that] the issuance of the marriage licenses mooted [the] request for them,” and the \nClerk could not “retroactively . . . nullify the marriage licenses plaintiff[s] had already obtained.”).  \nAccordingly,  “[t]he  relief  plaintiffs  obtained  –  the  unobstructed  opportunity  to  secure  pre-\n \n4 McQueary I also cited the case of Watson v. County of Riverside, 300 F.3d 1092, 1095–96 (9th \nCir. 2002) (affirming an award of attorney fees when a government employee who sought to \nexclude an unconstitutionally obtained report from an administrative hearing obtained a \npreliminary injunction that “irrevocably excluded the report). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 7 of 9    PageID 1643\nalteration marriage licenses – therefore stemmed from the preliminary injunction, not from the \nlegislature’s or [defendant’s] later voluntary actions.”  Id. \nAs a counterpoint to Young and Miller, the Government cites McQueary v. Conway, 2012 \nWL 3149344, at *3 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 1, 2012) (“McQueary II”), aff’d, 508 F. App’x 522 (6th Cir. \n2012). In that case, the plaintiff challenged provisions of Kentucky law limiting protests at \nfunerals. The district court granted the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding \nthat he had shown a likelihood of success on the merits. The Kentucky General Assembly then \nrepealed the challenged provisions, which mooted the plaintiff’s case before he obtained any \npermanent relief.  The district court initially denied the plaintiffs’ request for an award of attorney \nfees; however, the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision while clarifying the appropriate prevailing-\nparty analysis. On remand in McQueary II, the district court applied a context-specific analysis \nand again concluded that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party.  The district court found that the \nplaintiff was not a prevailing party because his “claim for permanent relief did not become moot \nwhen a particular event occurred” but, instead, because Kentucky “voluntarily repealed the \nchallenged provisions” before the court ordered permanent injunctive relief.  2012 WL 3149344, \nat *2.  \nUnlike the protestors in Young, the McQueary plaintiff did not seek relief allowing him to \nprotest “at a specific time and place.” Id. Instead, “[h]e sought a permanent injunction that would \nenjoin the Defendant from enforcing the challenged provisions at all funerals.” Id. The court \nexplained that, when injunctive relief is linked to a particular event, as in Young, “preliminary \nrelief becomes, in effect, permanent relief after the event occurs. After the passage of the event, \nthe preliminary injunction can no longer be meaningfully revoked,” and the court cannot order any \nfurther relief. Id. at *3. Preliminary relief like that awarded in McQueary, which enjoined \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 8 of 9    PageID 1644\nKentucky “from enforcing . . . challenged provisions only while [the plaintiff’s] claim for \npermanent relief was pending,” was “truly temporary and revocable.” Id. at *2-3. It could be either \nundone or made permanent by a court order on the merits. Thus, as long as the court had not \n“permanently enjoin[ed] the state from enforcing the challenged provisions,” there was “more [it] \ncould do for” plaintiff. Id. at *2.  The plaintiff did not receive all the relief sought through a \npermanent injunction; instead, permanent relief came by way of Kentucky’s voluntary repeal of \nthe challenged provision.  Ultimately, “the defendant’s voluntary conduct could not serve as the \nbasis for an award of attorney fees. Id. The Sixth Circuit affirmed this decision in McQueary v. \nConway, 508 F. App’x 522, 524 (6th Cir. 2012) (“McQueary III”). \nIn Hargett, the plaintiffs obtained a preliminary injunction against enforcement of a \nTennessee statute “imposing a raft of new requirements upon persons or organizations conducting \nvoter registration activities in the State.” 53 F.4th at 408. A few months later, the Tennessee \nlegislature repealed the challenged provisions, and the plaintiffs dismissed the case. Id. at 409. \nHowever, prior to the legislative action, the “plaintiffs were able to conduct voter-registration \ndrives for seven months during the runup to the 2020 election, unburdened by the requirements of \nthe” enjoined law. Id. at 410-11. Thus, the injunction gave the plaintiffs something that could not \nlater be taken away. \nIn the present case, the Court agrees with the Government that the decision in Hargett is \nconsistent with the principles outlined in the McQueary cases and that Hargett did not alter the \ngoverning framework for assessing whether a preliminary injunction grants sufficient relief to \nrender Plaintiff a “prevailing party.”  Here, Plaintiff received preliminary relief that was by nature \n“temporary and revocable,” i.e., an injunction precluding the Government from implementing § \n1005 until a decision on the merits of the case could be rendered. Unlike the injunction obtained \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 96   Filed 04/04/23   Page 9 of 9    PageID 1645\nin Hargett or Miller, the injunction in this case provided Plaintiff with nothing lasting - no \npermanent change of status, no irrevocable benefit, and no enduring opportunity to profit from the \nCourt’s order. See, e.g., McQueary II, 2012 WL 3149344, at *2 (contrasting an injunction for a \n“specific” act or occasion with an injunction that seeks to stop the defendants “from enforcing the \nchallenged” law universally). Any relief that Plaintiff now has because of § 1005’s repeal is the \nresult of a voluntary act of Congress and not a court order. As Plaintiff failed to obtain any “court-\nordered, material, enduring change in the legal relationship between the parties,” Miller, 936 F.3d \nat 448, he is not eligible for attorney fees, and his motion is DENIED. \n  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n              s/ S.

Vilsack, et al.  Page 2 \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nJANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge.  This appeal concerns a litigant’s petition for fees \nunder the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).  Plaintiff Robert Holman successfully obtained a \npreliminary injunction freezing a debt-relief program that used racial categories to remedy prior \ndiscrimination against farmers and ranchers.  Following additional proceedings, but before final \njudgment, Congress repealed the challenged program.  Holman now seeks fees associated with \nthe litigation.  The district court denied that request because, in its view, Holman was not a \n“prevailing party” under the EAJA.  We neither adopt nor definitively reject that conclusion.  \nInstead, we find that the Government’s position during the litigation was “substantially justified” \nwithin the EAJA’s meaning.  On that basis, we AFFIRM the judgment below.  \nI. BACKGROUND\nIn March 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act, which \nprovided various forms of emergency assistance in the COVID-19 pandemic’s wake.  Section \n1005 of the Act was a debt-relief program for “socially disadvantaged” farmers and ranchers.  It \nauthorized  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture  to  pay  to  Black,  American  Indian/Alaskan  Native, \nHispanic, Asian, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander farmers and ranchers up to 120 percent of certain \nfarm loans previously issued by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The \ncongressional record explains that the legislation was designed to provide targeted relief for \nfarmers against whom the USDA had historically discriminated and for whom prior pandemic \nrelief efforts had failed.     \nA number of challenges to Section 1005 were filed.  In Tennessee, farmer Robert Holman \nfiled a complaint and motion to preliminarily enjoin the program in early June 2021, alleging \nthat he  would  have  been  eligible  for  Section  1005’s  benefits  but  for  his  race.    His \npreliminary injunction motion argued that Section 1005 should be halted nationwide because \nDefendants—heads of the USDA and its subagency the Farm Service Agency, collectively the \nGovernment—could not satisfy the strict scrutiny applied to racial classifications under the Fifth \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 4 of 24  (4 of 24)\nPageID 1654\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 3 \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause and because other injunction-related factors favored his \nposition.  The Government agreed that strict scrutiny applied, but contended that Section 1005 \nwas  nonetheless  constitutional  and  that  other  considerations  weighed  against  issuing  an \ninjunction.   \nMeanwhile, similar litigation was proceeding in other courts.  On June 10, 2021, a district \ncourt in Wisconsin entered a temporary restraining order barring the USDA from forgiving any \nloans pursuant to Section 1005.  Faust v. Vilsack, 519 F. Supp. 3d 470, 478 (E.D. Wis. 2021).  \nOn June 23, a Florida district court preliminarily enjoined Section 1005 nationwide.  Wynn \nv.Vilsack, 545 F. Supp. 3d 1271, 1295 (M.D. Fla. 2021).  And on July 1, a district court in Texas\nboth enjoined the Government from considering race under Section 1005 and certified a class \naction of all farmers and ranchers excluded from Section 1005 by the “socially disadvantaged” \ncriterion.  Miller v. Vilsack, No. 4:21-cv-0595-O, 2021 WL 11115194, at *3, 12 (N.D. Tex. \nJuly 1, 2021). \nThe district court granted Holman’s preliminary injunction motion on July 8, 2021.  It \nreasoned that the Government had failed to make the strict scrutiny showing that Section 1005 \nwas narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.  The district court further \nexplained its view that an injunction was necessary to protect Holman from irreparable injury \nand that the public interest weighed in favor of injunctive relief, but also acknowledged that an \ninjunction could cause substantial harm to others—namely, socially disadvantaged farmers who \nsought access to Section 1005’s funds.  Finally, despite expressing reservations about issuing a \nnationwide injunction, the court found that alternative relief would be unworkable and enjoined \nthe Government from implementing Section 1005 in its entirety.   \nOn January 26, 2022, the district court granted the Government’s motion to dismiss \ncounts two and three of Holman’s complaint, in which Holman had argued that the USDA \nplanned to illegally make Section 1005 funding recipients eligible for future relief programs.  \nThe  Government  contended  that  with  these  counts  dismissed,  Holman’s  case  presented \nmaterially identical issues to the Texas class action litigation where Holman was necessarily a \nclass member, so a stay of Holman’s case was necessary to prevent inconsistent rulings.  On \nFebruary 16, the district court granted the Government’s stay motion.   \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 5 of 24  (5 of 24)\nPageID 1655\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 4 \nHalf a year later, with this case still stayed, the Inflation Reduction Act became law and \nrepealed  Section  1005.    The  parties  agreed  that  Section  1005’s  repeal  mooted  Holman’s \nchallenge and, accordingly, stipulated to the case’s dismissal.  Holman then moved for fees and \ncosts as a “prevailing party” under the EAJA.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  The district court \ndenied the motion, reasoning that because the “temporary and revocable” nature of the injunctive \nrelief previously awarded to Holman provided him “with nothing lasting,” Holman was not a \nprevailing party within the EAJA’s meaning.  Holman timely appealed.   \nII. ANALYSIS\nThe EAJA modifies the American legal system’s default rule “that each party pays its \nown costs and attorney’s fees.”  Griffith v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 987 F.3d 556, 563 (6th Cir. \n2021).  Under the EAJA, a “prevailing party” in a civil case against the United States is entitled \nto “fees and other expenses” and certain “costs” unless “the position of the United States was \nsubstantially  justified”  or  “special  circumstances  make  an  award  unjust.”    28  U.S.C. \n§2412(d)(1)(A).  The parties dispute all three aspects of § 2412(d)(1)(A)—whether (1) Holman\nwas a prevailing party, (2) the Government’s litigating position was substantially justified, and \n(3) special circumstances otherwise preclude a fees award.  Finding the first two issues sufficient\nto resolve the case, we take them up in turn.1 \nA. Prevailing Party\nWe review a plaintiff’s entitlement to prevailing party status de novo.  Miller v. Caudill, \n936 F.3d 442, 448 (6th Cir. 2019).  To be a prevailing party, “a plaintiff must have ‘been \nawarded some relief by the court.’”  Tenn. State Conf. of NAACP v. Hargett, 53 F. 4th 406, \n410 (6th Cir. 2022) (quoting Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Dep’t of Health \n& Hum. Res., 532 U.S. 598, 603 (2001)).2  Beyond that baseline requirement, whether a claimant \n1Although the district court’s conclusion that Holman was not a prevailing party meant that it did not reach\nthe substantial-justification or exceptional-circumstances issues, both parties have had a “full and fair opportunity to \naddress” these questions and urge us to reach them as necessary.  Smith v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Sch. Comm’rs, \n641 F.3d 197, 205 (6th Cir. 2011).   \n2As the district court recognized, interpretations of the phrase “prevailing party” in cases involving\n42 U.S.C. § 1988 and the EAJA are equally applicable to both statutes.  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 \nn.7 (1983) (“The standards set forth in this opinion [concerning § 1988 fee awards] are generally applicable in all\n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 6 of 24  (6 of 24)\nPageID 1656\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 5 \nwho “prevails in one sense (by receiving a preliminary injunction) but not in another sense (by \nfailing to obtain a final judgment when the case becomes moot)” is entitled to prevailing party \nstatus “requires a ‘contextual and case-specific’ response.”  Roberts v. Neace, 65 F.4th 280, \n284 (6th  Cir.  2023)  (quoting  McQueary  v.  Conway,  614  F.3d  591,  604  (6th  Cir.  2010)).  \nGenerally, preliminary injunctions alone are insufficient to show that a party prevailed within the \nEAJA’s meaning.  Id.  “But a preliminary injunction may well suffice if it mainly turns on the \nlikelihood-of-success inquiry and changes the parties’ relationship in a material and enduring \nway.”  Id. \nBoth parties present weighty arguments on this question.  The Government contends that \nbecause  orders  entered  by  other  courts  had  already  halted  Section  1005’s  implementation \nnationwide, see, e.g., Wynn, 545 F. Supp. 3d at 1295, the injunction in this case did not “directly \nbenefit the ‘plaintiff by modifying the defendant’s behavior toward him’” and was accordingly \nnot “material.”  Hargett, 53 F.4th at 410 (quoting McQueary, 614 F.3d at 598 (cleaned up)).  It \nfurther argues that Holman’s relief was not “enduring” because it gave him no “irrevocable” \nbenefit; both before and after the injunction, Holman could not access Section 1005’s funds.  The \ndistrict court agreed that Holman was not a prevailing party, largely focusing on his failure to \nobtain irrevocable relief.   \nHolman notes, however, that several relevant considerations point in his direction.  For \nexample, there is no question that the district court’s preliminary injunction opinion mainly \nturned “on the likelihood-of-success inquiry.”  Roberts, 65 F.4th at 284.  Further, we have \npreviously explained that in determining “whether a claimant directly benefitted from litigation, \nwe usually measure the plaintiff’s gain based on the relief requested in his complaint, not based \non the practical significance of the relief obtained.”  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 602.  This reasoning \nsuggests  that  the  preliminary  injunction,  which  granted  Holman  the  relief  requested  in  his \nmotion, may have been material even though—because of the previously issued injunctions—it \ndid not require the Government to immediately change its behavior.   \ncases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a ‘prevailing party.’”); Bryant v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., \n578 F.3d 443, 449 (6th Cir. 2009).   \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 7 of 24  (7 of 24)\nPageID 1657\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 6 \nAs for whether his relief was enduring, Holman observes that the thirteen-month-long \ninjunction here was in place longer than in several cases in which the plaintiff was deemed \nthe prevailing party.  See, e.g., G.S. ex rel. Schwaigert v. Lee, No. 22-5969, 2023 WL 5205179, \nat *6 (6th Cir. Aug. 14, 2023) (finding an injunction lasting as little as two-to-six months \nsufficiently lengthy to qualify a plaintiff as a prevailing party); Hargett, 53 F.4th at 410-11 \n(same as to an injunction that lasted seven months).  The injunction’s “nature,” moreover, was \nnot “ill-considered, hastily entered, or tentative”—it neither “maintain[ed] the status quo without \naddressing the merits” nor was “later overturned, repudiated, or vacated.”  Roberts, 65 F.4th at \n284. Finally, Holman contends that the injunction did provide irrevocable relief by preventing\nthe harm caused each day by Section 1005:  his “inability to compete on equal footing” with \nothers for funding.  Ne. Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. Jacksonville, \n508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).   \nDetermining “whether or when the winner of a preliminary injunction may be treated as a \n‘prevailing party’” is always a “thorny” undertaking.  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 596.  Considering \nthe  record  and  both  parties’  substantial  arguments,  we  conclude  only  that  determining  a \nplaintiff’s  prevailing  party  status  is  particularly  fraught  where,  as  here,  he  succeeds  in \npreliminarily enjoining a statute or rule but cannot use that injunction to take any specific action.  \nWe instead resolve the issue of Holman’s entitlement to EAJA fees on a clearer ground:  whether \nthe Government’s litigating position was substantially justified.   \nB. Substantial Justification\nEven if a litigant is a prevailing party under the EAJA, he is not entitled to fees if “the \nposition of the United States was substantially justified.”  28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d)(1)(A).  The \nGovernment bears the burden of demonstrating substantial justification, Griffith, 987 F.3d at 563, \nwhich  requires  the  position  to  “be  ‘more  than  merely  undeserving  of  sanctions  for \nfrivolousness,’” id. (quoting Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 565 (1988)).  But it need not \nrepresent a winning argument.  Id.  Instead, the position need only be “justified to a degree \nthat could satisfy a reasonable person” such that “a reasonable person could think it correct.”  \nId. (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 565, 566 n.2).   \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 8 of 24  (8 of 24)\nPageID 1658\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 7 \nWhat “matter[s] most” to the substantial justification analysis is “the actual merits of the \nGovernment’s litigating position.”  Id. (quoting United States ex rel. Wall v. Circle C. Constr., \nLLC, 868 F.3d 466, 471 (6th Cir. 2017)).  The merits of that position are considered “as a \nwhole.” Id. at 564 (quoting Amezola-Garcia v. Lynch, 835 F.3d 553, 555 (6th Cir. 2016)); see \nalso Comm’r, Immigr. & Naturalization Serv. v. Jean, 496 U.S. 154, 160 (1990) (noting that the \nsubstantial  justification  inquiry  considers  the  entire  litigation  and  “operates  as  a  one-time \nthreshold for fee eligibility”).  In doing so, we recognize the difference “between cases in which \n‘the government lost because it vainly pressed a position flatly at odds with the controlling case \nlaw’  and  cases  in  which  ‘the  government  lost  because  an  unsettled  question  was  resolved \nunfavorably.’”  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting Taucher v. Brown-Hruska, 396 F.3d 1168, \n1174 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nIn addition to the merits of the Government’s position, other “‘objective indicia’ of \nreasonableness” may be relevant, though not dispositive.  Id. at 563 (quoting Wall, 868 F.3d at \n471).  These indicia include whether the Government’s position follows a string of losses or \nsuccesses,  id.,  as  well  as  “the  stage  at  which  the  proceedings  were  resolved,”  Dvorkin \nv.Gonzales, 173 F. App’x 420, 424 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting United States v. 2323 Charms Road,\n946 F.2d 437, 440 (6th Cir. 1991)).  \nAs an initial matter, the Government urges us to adopt a presumption that its position is \nsubstantially justified whenever it defends a federal statute.  That presumption, the Government \nargues, flows from its “duty to defend the constitutionality of statutes whenever reasonable \narguments can be made in their defense.”  But the EAJA directs the court to examine the \njustification for the Government’s “position,” not its conduct.  28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  At \nbest, therefore, the Government’s duty to defend Section 1005 “explains . . . why [it] took the \nposition it did,” but it does not answer the “question under [the] EAJA” of “whether that position \nwas  substantially  justified.”    Taucher,  396  F.3d  at  1175  (Roberts,  J.).    The  Government’s \nclaimed presumption, moreover, could effectively insulate it from liability even when defending \nunreasonable positions—a result fundamentally at odds with the EAJA’s “specific purpose” of \neliminating  “for  the  average  person  the  financial  disincentive  to  challenge  unreasonable \ngovernmental actions.”  Jean, 496 U.S. at 163.  As a result, though we need not deem the \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 9 of 24  (9 of 24)\nPageID 1659\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 8 \nGovernment’s duty to defend irrelevant in every substantial-justification inquiry, we decline to \nadopt a presumption that the Government is substantially justified anytime it defends a federal \nstatute.   \nInstead,  we  return  to  the  considerations  outlined  in  our  caselaw,  starting  with  the \nGovernment’s merits position during the central aspect of this litigation:  that the district court \nshould not preliminarily enjoin Section 1005.  It was Holman’s burden as the movant to “present \n‘a clear showing’” that the injunctive-relief factors weighed in his favor.  L.W. ex rel. Williams \nv.Skrmetti, 83 F.4th 460, 471 (6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  Considered within the EAJA’s framework, this burden means that the \nGovernment’s position was substantially justified “if ‘a reasonable person could think it correct’” \nthat Holman had not made the requisite clear showing of likely success necessary to receive \ninjunctive relief.  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 563 (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2).   \nThe first issue in Holman’s preliminary injunction motion—the likelihood of success on \nthe merits—turned on the constitutionality of Section 1005’s relief for socially disadvantaged \nfarmers.  Like all programs that differentiate based on race, Section 1005 was subject to strict \nscrutiny.  Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 310 (2013); Grutter v. Bollinger, \n539 U.S. 306, 326-27 (2003); Vitolo v. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 360 (6th Cir. 2021).  The \nGovernment  therefore  had  to  show  that  the  program  was  narrowly  tailored  to  further  a \ncompelling  governmental  interest.    Fisher,  570  U.S.  at  310.    Holman  misapprehends  this \nstandard  by  positing  that  the  Government  was  required  to  “present  evidence  of  current, \nintentional discrimination when seeking to uphold a racial preference scheme.”  To the contrary, \nremedying the effects  of past  discrimination  constitutes a compelling governmental interest \nwhere the remedial policy targets specific episodes of past discrimination and there is evidence \nthat the Government intentionally participated in that discrimination.  Vitolo, 99 F.3d at 361; see \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabik, 214 F.3d 730, 735 (6th Cir. 2000) (“There \nis  no  question  that  remedying  the  effects  of  past  discrimination  constitutes  a  compelling \ngovernmental interest.”); Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 10 of 24  (10 of 24)\nPageID 1660\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 9 \n701, 720 (2007).3  Narrow tailoring, in turn, requires the Government to show “serious, good \nfaith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives,” but “does not require exhaustion of \nevery conceivable” alternative.  Fisher, 570 U.S. at 312 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339) \n(emphasis omitted).   \nAcknowledging the high bar set by strict scrutiny, the Government presented substantial \nrecord evidence to defend the program’s constitutionality.  Some of the Government’s evidence \nregarding  its  compelling  interest  addressed  past  discrimination  against  minority  groups \ngenerally.  For example, a 1997 report contained evidence that the USDA had “done more to hurt \nthan to help small and minority farmers” because many minority farmers’ loan applications and \ndiscrimination complaints languished within the Agency.  A 2011 Civil Rights Assessment \n“substantiated” continued “claims of denial of equal program access” by minority applicants and \nsuggested the existence of “continuing institutional discrimination” by the Agency.  And a 2019 \ngovernmental report explained that “allegations of unlawful discrimination against [socially \ndisadvantaged farmers and ranchers] in the management of USDA programs are long-standing \nand well-documented.”  These reports represent evidence of past discrimination by the USDA \nagainst socially disadvantaged farmers generally.  \nBuilding on that evidence, the Government also provided examples of past discrimination \nby the USDA against many specific groups.  As detailed in governmental reports and federal \nlitigation terminating in substantial settlements, the USDA had a history of dealing reluctantly \nwith and denying loans to Black farmers; loans that were issued, moreover, were often provided \nat unfavorable times or contained burdensome requirements not imposed on non-Black farmers.  \nHispanic farmers stated that they had been “stereotyped as being farm workers, rather than \nowners,” and received “inconsistent or incomplete” information from the USDA; one farmer said \nHispanic growers had been “systematically excluded” from USDA programs.  Asian farmers \nwere among those who alleged in the late 1990s that the USDA had hurt rather than helped \n3Though  cases  decided  after  the  Government  articulated  its  position  do  not  affect  the  substantial-\njustification analysis, see Griffith, 987 F.3d at 565-66, we observe that the Supreme Court has recently reiterated that \nremedying past intentional discrimination constitutes a compelling interest.  See Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. \nv.President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 207 (2023) (specifying that “remediating specific, identified\ninstances of past discrimination that violated the Constitution or a statute” is a compelling interest).\n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 11 of 24  (11 of 24)\nPageID 1661\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 10 \nminority farmers, and some reported in 2011 “a general consensus . . . that they are not always \ntreated  fairly  by  the  USDA.”    And  in  2019,  Native  American  farmers  reported  that \n“discrimination [has] contribute[d] to the lack of commercial lending on tribal lands”; similar \nallegations resulted in a large settlement between the USDA and Native farmers and ranchers.   \nFinally, to support its argument that Section 1005 was narrowly tailored to addressing the \ncompelling interest in remedying this identified past discrimination, the Government pointed to \n“the inefficacy of the race-neutral alternatives that Congress tried for years before enacting \n§1005”, the time-limited nature of the Section 1005’s relief, and the administrative difficulty of\nquickly administering relief to minority farmers disproportionately harmed by the pandemic. \nIn short, the Government placed before the district court a “strong basis in evidence \nfor its conclusion that remedial action” in the form of Section 1005 “was necessary.”  Drabik, \n214 F.3d at 735 (quoting City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 500 (1989)).  It \npointed to “specific episode[s] of past discrimination” against socially disadvantaged farmers \nand ranchers, statistical and anecdotal “evidence to establish intentional discrimination,” and \nexamples of the USDA’s role in “the past discrimination it now seeks to remedy.”  Vitolo, \n999 F.3d at 361.  Finally, it explained Congress’s view as to why “race-neutral alternatives”—\nsome  of  which  had  already  been  tried,  and  others  of  which  were  impractical—constituted \ninsufficient remedies.  Fisher, 570 U.S. at 312 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339). \nIn  granting  a  preliminary  injunction,  the  district  court  ultimately  rejected  these \narguments.  In doing so, it rightly recognized the difficulty of satisfying strict scrutiny and \nevaluated  an  issue—when  and  how  the  Government  may  permissibly  act  to  remedy  past \ndiscrimination—that was “controversial, thorny, and unsettled” at the time and remains so today.  \nVitolo, 999 F.3d at 366 (Donald, J., dissenting).  That thorniness flows in part from the legal tests \nin this area of the law, many of which are matters of degree rather than cleanly drawn lines.  For \nexample, when do statistical disparities between racial groups, which may be insufficient by \nthemselves  to  show  intentional  discrimination,  nonetheless  represent  sufficiently  probative \n“evidence [of] intentional discrimination” that a court may infer intent?  See id. at 361.  And how \nmany options must the Government evaluate to show a “serious, good faith consideration of \nrace-neutral alternatives?”  See Fisher, 570 U.S. at 312 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339).  That \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 12 of 24  (12 of 24)\nPageID 1662\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 11 \nthoughtful judges could, on this record, readily reach different answers on these and other \nquestions  suggests  that  the  Government  “lost  because  an  unsettled  question  was  resolved \nunfavorably,” not because it “vainly pressed a position flatly at odds with the controlling case \nlaw.”  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting Taucher, 396 F.3d at 1173) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nThe dissent concludes otherwise primarily by relying on Vitolo, which explained that a \nrace-conscious  program  is  unconstitutional  where  the  Government  provides  “little  evidence \nof past  intentional  discrimination  against  the  many  groups  to  whom  it  grants  preferences.”  \n999 F.3d  at  361.    But  here,  as  chronicled  above,  the  Government  provided  evidence  of \nintentional USDA discrimination against socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers generally, \nand buttressed that evidence with specific examples of intentional discrimination against nearly \nevery group included in the socially disadvantaged category.  That is categorically distinct from \nthe  evidentiary  presentation  in  Vitolo,  which  did  “not  identify  specific  incidents  of  past \ndiscrimination” and relied entirely on “general social disparities.”  Id. at 361-62.  Nor is this a \ncase in which the Government provided “absolutely no evidence of past discrimination” against \nmost of the categories included in a race-conscious program.  J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at \n506 (emphasis  removed).    The  notion  that  the  Government  was  clearly  required,  at  the \npreliminary injunction stage, to provide specific examples of intentional discrimination against \nevery category included in a race-conscious program is also difficult to square with the Supreme \nCourt’s instruction that narrow tailoring does not demand perfection.  See Fisher, 570 U.S. at \n312; Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339; accord J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. at 510 (holding that “evidence \nof a pattern of individual discriminatory acts can, if supported by appropriate statistical proof, \nlend support to a . . . government’s determination that broader remedial relief is justified.”).  It \nwas Holman’s duty to make a clear showing of likely success on the merits, Skrmetti, 83 F.4th at \n471—but here, “a reasonable person could think” that the Government’s evidence supporting \nSection 1005’s constitutionality sufficiently undermined Holman’s required showing.  Pierce, \n487 U.S. at 566 n.2.  As a result, the Government’s position on this aspect of the litigation was \nsubstantially justified. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 13 of 24  (13 of 24)\nPageID 1663\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 12 \nGoverning precedent, moreover, requires us to consider the entirety of the Government’s \n“arguments  made  during  litigation”  in  determining  whether  its  “whole  position”  was \nsubstantially  justified.    Id.    And  other  aspects  of  the  litigation,  not  addressed  by  the \ndissent, reinforce the reasonableness of the Government’s position “as a whole.”  Id. (quoting \nAmezola-Garcia,  835  F.3d  at  555).    In  opposing  the  injunction  motion,  for  instance,  the \nGovernment contended that the injunctions against Section 1005 already issued by other courts \neliminated the threat of irreparable harm to Holman.  Although the district court rejected this \nargument, some courts have “concluded that once another district court has entered the same \nrelief” sought by a plaintiff, that plaintiff is “no longer able to demonstrate the irreparable harm \nthat [is] needed to justify the extraordinary relief requested” by a preliminary injunction.  Faust \nv. Vilsack, No. 21-C-548, 2021 WL 2806204, at *3 (E.D. Wis. July 6, 2021) (collecting cases).\nIt was not unreasonable for the Government to raise this argument against Holman’s motion. \nThe Government also won a later motion to dismiss the second and third counts of \nHolman’s complaint, which encompassed his claims that the USDA was planning to illegally \nmake Section 1005 funding recipients eligible for future debt relief.  This aspect of the litigation \nwas  less  “prominent”  than  the  preliminary  injunction  motion,  through  which  Holman \nsuccessfully enjoined Section 1005.  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting EEOC v. Memphis Health \nCtr., 526 F. App’x 607, 615 (6th Cir. 2013)).  Nonetheless, this part of the Government’s \nposition was not only reasonable but ultimately meritorious. \nHolman observes that before the district court decided the preliminary injunction motion, \nthe  Government  had  already  suffered  a  “string  of  losses”  in  other  courts,  which  “can  be \nindicative” of the unreasonableness of the Government’s position.  Pierce, 487 U.S. at 569.  But \nthis and other “objective indicia” of the Government’s position, while “relevant,” matter less \nthan “the actual merits of the Government’s litigating position”—a position that, as shown \nabove, was substantially justified.  Griffith, 987 F.3d at 563 (quoting Wall, 868 F.3d at 471).  \nAnd other objective criteria support the Government’s position, including “the stage in which the \nproceedings  were  resolved.”    Dvorkin,  173  F.  App’x  at  424  (quoting  2323  Charms  Road, \n946 F.2d at 440).  Because each of the decisions concerning Section 1005 were issued in a \npreliminary posture, no court had definitively deemed the program unconstitutional.  Thus, not \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 14 of 24  (14 of 24)\nPageID 1664\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 13 \nonly do those decisions matter less than the actual merits of the Government’s litigating position, \nbut their import is lessened by their posture.  \nIn  sum,  the  Government  took  positions  throughout  this  litigation  that  recognized \ngoverning precedent and attempted to satisfy it through the presentation of extensive evidence.  \nThough  these  arguments  did  not  convince  the  district  court  to  deny  Holman’s  preliminary \ninjunction motion, “a reasonable person could think [them] correct.”   Griffith, 987 F.3d at \n563 (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566 n.2).  As a result, the Government has demonstrated that its \nposition was substantially justified which, in turn, precludes Holman’s entitlement to attorney’s \nfees and expenses.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2412 (d)(1)(A).   \nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.   \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 15 of 24  (15 of 24)\nPageID 1665\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 14 \n_________________ \nDISSENT \n_________________ \nLARSEN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  A “prevailing party” in a civil case against the \nUnited States is entitled to fees and costs unless the government’s position was “substantially \njustified” or “special circumstances make an award unjust.”  So, to get fees and costs, Holman \nmust show that he is a prevailing party.  Even if he does, though, the government may avoid \npaying if it shows that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make \nan award unjust.  The majority, rightly recognizing that the prevailing-party issue is difficult, \ninstead concludes that the government’s position was substantially justified.  I cannot agree.  \nI first explain that disagreement and then tackle the more difficult question of whether Holman is \na prevailing party.  I then address the special-circumstances question.  I conclude that Holman is \na  prevailing  party  because  the  preliminary  injunction  in  this  case  turned  primarily  on  the \nlikelihood of success on the merits and afforded enduring and material relief; the government’s \nposition was not substantially justified because it was flatly at odds with controlling caselaw; and \nno special circumstances make an award unjust.  Holman is therefore entitled to fees and costs, \nso I respectfully dissent. \nI. \nSection  1005  of  the  American  Rescue  Plan  Act  authorized  the  USDA  Secretary  to \n“provide a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the outstanding indebtedness of each \nsocially disadvantaged farmer or rancher as of January 1, 2021, to pay off [direct and guaranteed \nfarm loans].”  Pub. L. No. 117-2, § 1005(a)(2) (2021).  USDA defined “socially disadvantaged” \nbased on race, extending debt relief to Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic, Asian, \nor Hawaiian/Pacific Islander farmers and ranchers, without any consideration of need.  86 Fed. \nReg. 28,329, 28,330 (May 26, 2021).  Holman, who does not fall into any of the above racial \ncategories, sued and obtained a preliminary injunction, temporarily enjoining the implementation \nof the debt-relief program.  Section 1005 was then repealed in the Inflation Reduction Act.  Pub. \nL.No. 117-169, § 22008 (2022).  That mooted the case, and the parties stipulated to dismissal.\n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 16 of 24  (16 of 24)\nPageID 1666\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 15 \nHolman then moved for fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \n§2412.  Under that statute, a “prevailing party” in a civil case against the United States is\nentitled  to  fees  and  costs  unless  the  government’s  position  was  “substantially  justified”  or \n“special circumstances make an award unjust.”  Id. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  The district court denied \nHolman’s motion—concluding that he is not a prevailing party. \nII. \nA. \nThe government is not required to pay fees and costs when it shows that its position was \n“substantially justified.”  Id.  A position is substantially justified if “a reasonable person could \nthink it correct, that is, if it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.”  Pierce v. Underwood, \n487 U.S. 552, 566 n.2 (1988).  The “actual merits” of the position is what “matter[s] most.”  \nGriffith v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 987 F.3d 556, 563 (6th Cir. 2021).  The position must be better \nthan  one  “merely  undeserving  of  sanctions,”  though  it  need  not  ultimately  prove  correct.  \nId. (quoting Pierce, 487 U.S. at 566). \nThe majority concludes that the government has shown that its position was substantially \njustified.  I disagree. \n1. \nSection 1005 authorized debt relief based on race.  Pub. L. No. 117-2, § 1005 (2021); \n86 Fed. Reg. 28,329, 28,330 (May 26, 2021).  That makes it presumptively invalid.  Vitolo \nv.Guzman, 999 F.3d 353, 360 (6th Cir. 2021) (citing U.S. Const. amend. XIV).  The government\ncan overcome that presumption only if it shows that the racial discrimination was narrowly \ntailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  Id.  This standard (strict scrutiny) is “very \ndemanding” and one which “few programs will survive.”  Id. \nIn the district court, the government accepted that strict scrutiny applied to this claim and \nargued that it had a “two-fold” compelling interest:  “to remedy the lingering effects of prior \ndiscrimination against minority farmers in USDA loan (and other) programs and prevent public \nfunds from being allocated in a way that perpetuates the effects of discrimination.”  The Supreme \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 17 of 24  (17 of 24)\nPageID 1667\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 16 \nCourt has said that “remedial policies can sometimes justify preferential treatment based on \nrace.”  Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 361 (citing City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493–\n94 (1989) (plurality); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 237 (1995)).  At a \nminimum, though, there must be a specific episode of past intentional discrimination on the part \nof the government against a particular group—disparate impacts are not enough.  Id. \n2. \nThe  government,  of  course,  does  not  have  a  compelling  interest  in  remedying  past \ndiscrimination that never happened.  And when a government program seeks to remedy past \ndiscrimination against a number of different groups, it bears the burden to demonstrate “past \nintentional discrimination against the many groups to whom it grants preferences.”  Id. (faulting \nthe “schedule of racial preferences detailed in the government’s regulation—preferences for \nPakistanis but not Afghans; Japanese but not Iraqis; Hispanics but not Middle Easterners—[a]s \nnot supported by any record evidence at all”).  The majority concludes that the government \nprovided evidence of USDA discrimination against “many specific groups” defined as “socially \ndisadvantaged.”  Maj. Op. at 9 (emphasis added).  But what about the others?  The government \nreferred to no evidence of past intentional discrimination by USDA against Native Hawaiian and \nPacific Islander farmers and ranchers.  And the government relied only on broad assertions and \nstatistical disparities to show discrimination against American Indian, Asian, and Native Alaskan \nfarmers and ranchers.  We might assume that such discrimination happened, but that is not \nenough.  See Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 362 (“[W]hen it comes to general social disparities, there are \nsimply  too  many  variables  to  support  inferences  of  intentional  discrimination.”).    The \ngovernment  cannot  claim  a  compelling  interest  in  remedying  discrimination  without  first \nshowing that the discrimination happened.  Croson, 488 U.S. at 505.  That is reason enough to \nconclude that its position was not substantially justified. \nThat  is  not  to  say,  in  this  preliminary  posture,  that  the  government  made  no \ncompelling-interest showing.  I agree with the majority that the government cited evidence of \npast intentional discrimination against Black farmers and ranchers.  But if the government is \ngoing to use racially exclusionary measures as a remedy, the government’s policy must be \nnarrowly tailored to that particular interest.  And “a policy is not narrowly tailored if it is either \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 18 of 24  (18 of 24)\nPageID 1668\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 17 \noverbroad or underinclusive in its use of racial classifications.”  Vitolo, 999 F.3d at 362.  Here, \nthe program extends debt relief to farmers and ranchers in groups never shown to have been \ndiscriminated against.  Giving Native Hawaiian farmers and ranchers debt relief cannot remedy \npast discrimination against Black farmers and ranchers.  The glaring “mismatch” between means \nand  ends  is  far  too  much  for  strict  scrutiny  to  bear.    Students  for  Fair  Admissions,  Inc. \nv.President  and  Fellows  of  Harvard  Coll.,  143  S.  Ct.  2141,  2168  (2023).    There  is  no\n“reasonable basis in law and fact” to find this policy narrowly tailored.  Pierce, 487 U.S. at \n566 n.2. \nThe majority contends that the Government was not “clearly required, at the preliminary \ninjunction  stage,  to  provide  specific  examples  of  intentional  discrimination  against  every \ncategory included in [its] race-conscious program.”  Maj. Op. at 11.  The Supreme Court says \notherwise.  To justify a “resort to race-based government action,” the government had to show \nthat it was “remediating specific, identified instances of past discrimination that violated the \nConstitution or a statute.”  Students for Fair Admission, Inc., 143 S. Ct. at 2162 (emphasis \nadded).  And the preliminary posture of the litigation does not absolve the government of its \nburden.  See Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429–30 \n(2006).  Absent at least some specific evidence of intentional discrimination against each racial \ngroup, the government cannot show a compelling remedial interest in benefitting that group.  It \nhas not shown there is anything to remedy.  See Croson, 488 U.S. at 505–06.  The government’s \nposition—that  § 1005  should  not  be  preliminarily  enjoined—was  not  substantially  justified \nbecause the government presented arguments “flatly at odds with the controlling case law.”  \nGriffith, 987 F.3d at 564 (quoting Taucher v. Brown-Hruska, 396 F.3d 1168, 1174 (D.C. Cir. \n2005)) (cleaned up). \nB. \nBecause I disagree that the government’s position was substantially justified, I turn to the \nprevailing-party issue.  In general, obtaining a preliminary injunction does not make a plaintiff a \n“prevailing party.”  Planned Parenthood Sw. Ohio Region v. DeWine, 931 F.3d 530, 538 (6th \nCir. 2019).  But, in cases that are later dismissed as moot, a preliminary injunction may suffice \nwhen it (1) turns primarily on the likelihood of success on the merits and affords (2) “enduring” \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 19 of 24  (19 of 24)\nPageID 1669\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 18 \nand (3) “material” relief.  Miller v. Caudill, 936 F.3d 442, 448 (6th Cir. 2019).  The inquiry is \n“case-specific,” but we have tended to treat relief as enduring when it is “irrevocable” and as \nmaterial when it “directly benefits” the plaintiff.  Id.; see McQueary v. Conway, 614 F.3d 591, \n601 (6th Cir. 2010). \nAlthough the question is not free from doubt, I believe that Holman is a prevailing party \nbecause the preliminary injunction in this case turned primarily on the likelihood of success on \nthe merits and afforded enduring and material relief. \n1. \nAs the majority finds, “there is no question that the district court’s preliminary injunction \nopinion  mainly  turned  on  the  likelihood-of-success  inquiry.”    Maj.  Op.  at  5  (cleaned  up).  \nHolman clears this first hurdle with ease. \n2. \nWhether the relief was enduring is a more difficult question.  We have said that relief is \nenduring when it is “irrevocable.”  Miller, 936 F.3d at 448.  Accordingly, we have found \nenduring  relief  where  preliminary  injunctions  enabled  plaintiffs  to:  attend  church,  Roberts \nv.Neace,  65  F.4th  280,  284  (6th  Cir.  2023);  register  voters,  Tenn.  State  Conf.  of  NAACP\nv.Hargett, 53 F.4th 406, 410–11 (6th Cir. 2022); prescribe mifepristone, Planned Parenthood,\n931 F.3d at 541–42; get married, Miller, 936 F.3d at 448–49; and receive in-person education, \nG.S. ex rel. Schwaigert v. Lee, 2023 WL 5205179, at *6 (6th Cir. Aug. 14, 2023).  In each of \nthose cases, the preliminary injunction afforded relief that was in some sense realized during the \npendency of the injunction.  In contrast, we did not find enduring relief where a preliminary \ninjunction temporarily prevented enforcement of a statute criminalizing protests at funerals when \nthe plaintiff had not identified a funeral at which he planned to protest.  McQueary v. Conway, \n508  F.  App’x  522,  523–24  (6th  Cir.  2012);  McQueary  v.  Conway,  2012  WL  3149344,  at \n*3 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 1, 2012).  We distinguished a Seventh Circuit case, Young v. City of Chicago,\n202 F.3d 1000 (7th Cir. 2000), in which the plaintiffs wanted to protest at a particular event, and \nthe injunction enabled them to do so.  McQueary, 508 F. App’x at 524. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 20 of 24  (20 of 24)\nPageID 1670\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 19 \nThe cases above make clear that relief is enduring only if it is irrevocable.  See Miller, \n936 F.3d at 448.  That distinction is consistent with out-of-circuit caselaw.  See Thomas v. Nat’l \nScience Found., 330 F.3d 486, 488–93 (D.C. Cir. 2003); N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Jackson, 433 F.3d \n1083, 1084–86 (8th Cir. 2006). \nTo determine whether the preliminary injunction afforded Holman irrevocable relief, we \nmust  ask  whether  Holman  benefitted  from  the  injunction  before  the  case  was  mooted.  \nIrrevocable, Black’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) (“committed beyond recall”).  Or to ask the \nquestion differently, would Holman have benefitted even if the injunction had ultimately been \nvacated?  I believe the answer is “yes.”  The preliminary injunction delayed the debt-relief \nprogram.  That secured a period of equal treatment, during which all borrowers were continuing \nto accrue interest, and decreased the present value of the debt-relief program. \nIt is important to remember the nature of the harm in a case like this.  In Regents of the \nUniversity of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), the plaintiff challenged an admissions \nprogram that reserved spots in the entering medical-school class for minorities.  Id. at 279.  The \nSupreme Court explained that the plaintiff was harmed regardless of whether he would have \nbeen admitted to the class absent the challenged program.  Id. at 280 n.14.  The race-based \nexclusion from consideration was a harm separate and apart from any practical consequence of \nthe  exclusion.    So  too  in  other  race-based  set-aside  programs.    See  Ne.  Fla.  Chapter  of \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993).  The harm \nin cases like this is “the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not \nthe ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.”  Id. \nThe  denial  of  equal  treatment,  i.e.,  the  “discrimination  itself,”  causes  “serious \nnon-economic” harm.  Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 739–40 (1984).  Because that harm is \n“not co-extensive with any substantive rights to the benefits denied the party discriminated \nagainst,” it can be remedied “by withdrawal of benefits from the favored class as well as by \nextension of benefits to the excluded class.”  Id.  That means that Holman’s equal-protection \nharm could be remedied either by denying everyone debt relief (leveling down), or by allowing \nHolman to participate on a race-neutral basis in the debt-relief program (leveling up).  In this \ncase, the court ordered the level-down remedy. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 21 of 24  (21 of 24)\nPageID 1671\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 20 \nHolman  argues  that  afforded  him  the  irrevocable  benefit  of  “[d]ay-by-day”  equal \ntreatment.  Appellant Br. at 23–24.  He might be right.  The preliminary injunction, at minimum, \nensured that no one got debt relief during its pendency.  Holman was therefore not being \ndiscriminated against.  The benefit of those days of equal treatment “could not be reversed.”  \nThomas, 330 F.3d at 493; see Heckler, 465 U.S. at 739–40. \nThe counterargument is that the harm in this case is more appropriately tied to dollars—\nnot days.  The argument goes:  The preliminary injunction merely delayed the spending of \nmoney, and because reversal of the preliminary injunction would have meant that the entire \nappropriation could later have been spent in a discriminatory manner, Holman avoided no harm.  \nI  don’t  think  that’s  right  on  these  facts.    Section  1005  authorized  the  Secretary  to  make \ndebt-relief  payments  based  on  amounts  owed  as  of  January  1,  2021.    Pub.  L.  No.  117-2, \n§1005(a)(2) (2021).  At minimum, the preliminary injunction delayed those payments.  In the\ninterim, all borrowers were continuing to accrue interest that was not part of the outstanding \nindebtedness as of January 1, 2021.  Plus, aside from any increase in interest expense, delay itself \nhas a cost.  See Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Comm’r, 523 U.S. 382, 384 (1998) (explaining the “time \nvalue of money,” i.e., “the fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow” \n(cleaned up)).  So, even if the equal-protection harm in this case were merely a function of the \nvalue of the debt-relief program, the preliminary injunction irreversibly reduced that too. \nThe preliminary injunction in this case delayed debt-relief payments.  That secured a \nperiod  of  equal  treatment,  meant  that  that  all  borrowers  continued  to  accrue  interest,  and \ndecreased the present value of the debt-relief program.  That relief is irrevocable and, therefore, \nenduring. \n3. \nWhether the relief was material is also complicated.  We have said that relief is material \nwhen it “directly benefits the plaintiff by modifying the defendant’s behavior toward him.”  \nNAACP, 53 F.4th at 410 (cleaned up); see Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111–12 (1992).  So, \npreventing the government from implementing a program that causes an injury would ordinarily \nqualify.  Here, though, there were already two nationwide injunctions against the program.  \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 22 of 24  (22 of 24)\nPageID 1672\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 21 \nSee Faust v. Vilsack, 519 F. Supp. 3d 470, 478 (E.D. Wis. 2021); Wynn v. Vilsack, 545 F. Supp. \n3d 1271, 1295 (M.D. Fla. 2021).  The government argues that the relief was therefore not \nmaterial.  Is a defendant’s behavior changed by an injunction enjoining something already \nenjoined?  As a practical matter, no.  But we have said that “the magnitude of a party’s obtained \nrelief does not dictate the outcome of the prevailing-party inquiry.”  Planned Parenthood, 931 \nF.3d at 541.  Rather, the “touchstone” of the inquiry is whether there has been a meaningful\n“alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote \nin the fee statute.”  Texas State Tchrs. Ass’n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792–93 \n(1989).  As a result, we look to the “relief requested in the complaint,” “not the practical \nsignificance of the relief obtained.”  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 602 (cleaned up). \nIn McQueary, for example, the plaintiff obtained a preliminary injunction preventing \nenforcement of two provisions of law that prohibited certain protests.  Id.  The defendant argued \nthat the relief was not material because there were yet other provisions of law, not challenged in \nthat case, that also prohibited the protests.  Id.  This court was unmoved and said that the relief \nwas material even if it had no practical significance.  Id. \nLike  the  plaintiff  in  McQueary,  Holman  obtained  the  relief  he  requested  in  his \ncomplaint—albeit preliminarily.  That seems like enough.  However, unlike in McQueary, the \nrelief Holman requested in his complaint had, in a sense, already been ordered by other courts.  I \ndo not think that changes the outcome here, though.  Those other decisions might have been \nreversed on appeal or otherwise have failed to convert into permanent injunctions; the parties, for \nexample, might have settled, or the scope of the injunctions might have been narrowed.  See, \ne.g., Commonwealth v. Biden, 57 F.4th 545, 556–57 (6th Cir. 2023); California v. Azar, 911 F.3d\n558, 583–85 (9th Cir. 2018).  The relief in this case meant that Holman had the ability to enforce \nhis injunction and was protected regardless of what happened in those other cases.  Although \nsomewhat difficult to square with the “modifying the defendant’s behavior” formulation, the \nrelief in this case was clearly a meaningful alteration of the legal relationship between the parties \nthat directly benefitted Holman.  Because this court’s cases teach that our focus should be on the \n“relief requested in the complaint,” not its “practical significance,” I think that the relief obtained \nhere qualifies as material.  McQueary, 614 F.3d at 602. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 23 of 24  (23 of 24)\nPageID 1673\nNo. 23-5493  Holman v. Vilsack, et al.  Page 22 \nC. \nThe  government  may  still  avoid  paying  fees  and  costs  if  it  shows  that  “special \ncircumstances  make  an  award  unjust.”    28  U.S.C.  § 2412(d)(1)(A).    We  look  to  general \n“equitable considerations” in evaluating this exception.  Sakhawati v. Lynch, 839 F.3d 476, \n478 (6th Cir. 2016).  The government argues that there are three special circumstances here, but \neach falls short. \nFirst,  the  government  repackages  its  material-relief  argument  that  the  preliminary \ninjunction  provided  no  benefit  beyond  the  already-existing  nationwide  injunctions.    That \nargument is unavailing here for the same reasons it was unavailing there:  Holman obtained the \nrelief he requested in his complaint, which gave Holman added protection independent of those \nother cases.  Second, the government notes that it was defending the constitutionality of a statute \nand contends that it is wrong to penalize an agency for complying with its statutory obligations.  \nWhatever the policy merits of the government’s argument, there is nothing in the Equal Access \nto Justice Act that supports a statutory-defense exception.  Third, the government suggests that \nan award would be unjust because some of the fees Holman seeks are for work that occurred \nafter the preliminary injunction entered.  That is not a concern at this stage, though, because it \ndoes not mean that “an award” would be unjust.  28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).  Rather, it goes to \ncalculating “reasonable attorney fees.”  Id. § 2412(d)(2)(A); see Sakhawati, 839 F.3d at 480. \nIn this case, no special circumstances make an award unjust. \n** *\n My best read of our cases is that Holman is entitled to fees and costs because he is a \nprevailing  party,  the  government’s  position  was  not  substantially  justified,  and  no  special \ncircumstances make an award unjust.  I therefore respectfully dissent. \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay     Document 99     Filed 09/23/24     Page 24 of 24  (24 of 24)\nPageID 1674\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \nNo. 23-5493 \nROBERT HOLMAN, \nPlaintiff - Appellant, \nv. \nTHOMAS J.

Plaintiff Robert Holman is a Tennessee farmer, a \nhusband, and a father of a young daughter. He is of mixed European ancestry. He farms with his \nfather in Union City, TN, where they have 2,220 combined acres to grow crops, mostly corn and \nsoybeans. Rob’s family’s primary income comes from farming. Because his race and ethnicity on \nfile with the Farm Service Agency is white, Rob is not covered by the loan forgiveness program \nin the American Rescue Plan Act, signed in March 2021. On the other hand, if he were of a \ndifferent race or ethnicity—regardless of whether he was economically affected by COVID-19, a \nrecipient of a settlement award for past discrimination, or in fact needed loan forgiveness—he \nwould be eligible for loan forgiveness. Moreover, the government has indicated it will overlook \n \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 2 of 17    PageID 2\nan  express  statutory  prohibition  against  providing  further  loans  to  those  who  obtain  loan \nforgiveness, but again, only for those of particular races. \nRob brings this complaint, both facially and as-applied, against Defendants Thomas J. \nVilsack, Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA or the Department), and \nZach Ducheneaux, Administrator of the FSA, as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Government policies that classify people by race are presumptively invalid. U.S. \nConst. amend. XIV; Adarand Constr., Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 234–35 (1995) (applying equal \nprotection principles to federal policies that discriminate by race). The Constitution requires that \n“all racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under \nstrict scrutiny.” Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499, 505 (2005) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). “We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called ‘benign’ racial \nclassifications, such as race-conscious university admissions policies, race-based preferences in \ngovernment contracts, and race-based districting intended to improve minority representation.”  Id. \n(internal citations omitted).  \n2.  Equal  protection  under  the  law  is  the  cornerstone  of  modern-day  American \nconstitutional jurisprudence. It is the principle etched into our nation and was “[p]urchased at the \nprice  of  immeasurable  human  suffering.”  Adarand  Constr.,  515  U.S.  at  240  (Thomas,  J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).  \n3.  In March 2021, however, Congress opted to enshrine into law race classifications \nthat divide American citizens by skin color, and which are unmoored from any interest that the \ngovernment may have in remedying past discrimination.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 3 of 17    PageID 3\n4.  In the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, H.R. 1319, 117th Cong. (2021) (ARPA), \nCongress allotted funds for debt relief to “socially disadvantaged” farmers and ranchers. The \nprogram will erase the debts of certain farmers and ranchers who took out loans, and provide an \nadditional 20% to cover tax liabilities, but only for those of particular races. \n5.  The program does so by providing a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the \noutstanding indebtedness, to remain available until expended, for the cost of loan modifications \nand payments under this section. \n6.  A “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” is defined by federal law, 7 U.S.C. \n§ 2279(a)(5), as “a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group.” \n7.  In turn, a “socially disadvantaged group” is a “group whose members have been \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without \nregard to their individual qualities.” 7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(6). \n8.  The  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA)  interprets  the  phrase \n“socially disadvantaged group” to include explicit racial classifications. Indeed, to be eligible for \nARPA’s debt relief, farmers and ranchers must be “Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, \nHispanic, or Asian, or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.” See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments \nFAQ, at Question 1, at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq. \n9.  The USDA has Rob’s race on file as white. Rob would generally be considered \nwhite or Caucasian. \n10.  Persons considered white or Caucasian are not “socially disadvantaged” under the \nUSDA’s loan-forgiveness program. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 4 of 17    PageID 4\n11.  Defendants are responsible for running this race-based loan-forgiveness program \nthrough the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Defendants assert that the purpose of this program is to \nremedy “systemic racism” within USDA and more broadly “across agriculture.”  \n12.  The United States Constitution “forbids” discrimination by the federal government \n“against any citizen because of his race.” Adarand Constr., 515 U.S. at 216 (internal citations \nomitted).  When  the  government  distributes  “benefits  on  the  basis  of  individual  racial \nclassifications,” as Defendants do in this case, the government bears the burden of meeting “strict \nscrutiny.”  In other words, the government must prove that its discriminatory benefit is narrowly \ntailored and serves a compelling government interest. Id. at 227. It cannot do so here. \n13.  Defendants’ use of race discrimination as a tool to end “systemic racism” is patently \nunconstitutional, inconsistent with “magnificent words of the Constitution and Declaration of \nIndependence,” Martin Luther King I Have a Dream (Aug. 28, 1963) (published by BBC News \n(http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3170387.stm),  and  should  be  enjoined  by  the  Court. \nEnjoining this discriminatory conduct will promote equal rights under the law for all American \ncitizens, promote efforts to stop further racial discrimination, and hasten the redemption of the \n“promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.” Id. “The way to stop discrimination \non the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. \nv. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 748 (2007) (plurality opinion).  \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff Robert Thompson Holman owns a ranch in Obion County, near Union \nCity, located in the Western District of Tennessee. Rob is a fourth generation Tennessee farmer \nwhose family started farming in West Tennessee over 150 years ago. He and his father still farm \non the same land. In 2016, he took out an operational microloan from the FSA, which is covered \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 5 of 17    PageID 5\nunder the terms of ARPA. In 2018, he took out another operational loan from the FSA, which is \nalso covered under the terms of ARPA. Both loans remain outstanding. The Promissory Notes on \nboth of Rob’s loans name the FSA’s office located in Union City, Tennessee, as the payee for the \nUSDA. Rob would be eligible for the loan forgiveness program in Section 1005 of ARPA, and for \nfuture FSA loans, except for the fact that he is not a member of any of the racial groups that are \neligible for loan forgiveness.  \n15.  Defendant Thomas J. Vilsack is the Secretary of Agriculture. He is responsible for \nleading the USDA, which includes the FSA. Under Section 1005 of ARPA, Defendant Vilsack is \nrequired to provide debt relief to certain farmers based on race. He is sued in his official capacity. \n16.  Defendant Zach Ducheneaux is the Administrator of the FSA. Among other things, \nFSA oversees certain loan programs. Under Section 1005 of ARPA, FSA will provide debt relief \nto certain farmers with direct loans or USDA-backed loans based on race. He is sued in his official \ncapacity.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  This case arises directly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n18.  The Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 \nbecause this case presents a substantial question of federal law, specifically whether Section 1005 \nof  ARPA—and  Defendants’  implementation  of  that  section—violates  the  United  States \nConstitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws.  \n19.  This Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order injunctive \nrelief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n20.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1). A substantial part \nof the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district, Defendants maintain one or more \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 6 of 17    PageID 6\noffices and employees in this district, a substantial part of the property subject to this action is \nsituated in this district, and a plaintiff resides in this district.  \nRob Holman is a rancher with outstanding debt on an FSA loan \n21.  Rob is an active farmer in Union City, Tennessee. \n22.  Rob farms with his father growing mostly corn and soybeans on approximately \n2,200 acres. \n23.  Rob has two FSA loans and is otherwise eligible for the loan forgiveness program \nin Section 1005 of ARPA, except that the USDA has his race on file as white because Rob is \ncommonly considered white or Caucasian. \n24.  On or about November 27, 2016, Rob applied for a microloan (Loan One). He \napplied for a loan of $40,000 to purchase equipment. \n25.  On or about December 30, 2016, Rob signed a Promissory Note for Loan One. The \nloan was for $40,000, due and payable seven years and one month from the date of the note. \n26.  As of April 21, 2021, Rob had $17,667.10 outstanding on Loan One. \n27.  On or about March 2, 2018, Rob applied for direct loan assistance (Loan Two). He \napplied for a loan of $37,000 to purchase 50% interest on a planter. \n28.  On or about March 27, 2018, Rob signed a Promissory Note for Loan Two. The \nloan was for $37,00, due and payable seven years from the date of the note. \n29.  As of April 21, 2021, Rob had $21,743.67 outstanding on Loan Two. \n30.  Under existing law, Rob would be prohibited from obtaining further loans from the \nDepartment if he received any form of debt forgiveness on his FSA loans. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 7 of 17    PageID 7\n31.  Both of Rob’s Promissory Notes contains the following statement, on Page 1: “The \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits discrimination in all of its programs and \nactivities on the basis of race, color, [or] national origin . . . .” \nPresident Biden signs the American Rescue Plan Act \n32.  On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed ARPA into law. \n33.  In a Rose Garden ceremony, President Biden emphasized that the $1.9 trillion in \nspending authorized by ARPA was necessary in response to COVID-19. Biden said: “It directly \naddressed the emergency in this country. Because it focuses on what people need most.” See \nPresident Joe Biden on the American Rescue Plan and recovery, CNBC YouTube Channel, at \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj2zCWetr1Y (Time Stamp 3:33). \n34.  In Section 1005 of ARPA, Congress appropriated “such sums as may be necessary” \nto pay for the cost of loan modifications and payments for “each socially disadvantaged farmer or \nrancher as of January 1, 2021.”  ARPA § 1005(a)(1)-(2). \n35.  Section  1005(a)  requires  Defendant  Vilsack  to  use  the  appropriated  funds  to \n“provide a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the outstanding indebtedness of each socially \ndisadvantaged farmer or rancher as of January 1, 2021.”  ARPA § 1005(a)(2). \n36.  A “socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher” has “indebtedness” if that farmer or \nrancher owes money on a “direct farm loan made by the Secretary” or a “farm loan guaranteed by \nthe Secretary.”  ARPA § 1005(a)(2)(A)-(B). \n37.  Finally, Section 1005(a)(3) states that “the term ‘socially disadvantaged famer or \nrancher’ has the meaning given in section 2501(a) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and \nTrade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)).” That Act defines “socially disadvantaged farmer or \nrancher” as “a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group.” 7 U.S.C. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 8 of 17    PageID 8\n§ 2279(a)(5). “Socially disadvantaged group,” in turn, is defined as “a group whose members have \nbeen subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without \nregard to their individual qualities.”  7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(6). \n38.  Defendants Vilsack and Ducheneaux are responsible for the implementation of the \nloan forgiveness provisions in ARPA Section 1005.  \n39.  On March 25, 2021, Defendant Vilsack offered written testimony to the House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Agriculture. See Opening Statement of Thomas J. Vilsack Before \nthe  House  Committee  on  Agriculture  –  Remarks  as  Prepared,  (March  25,  2021),  at \nhttps://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2021/03/25/opening-statement-thomas-j-vilsack-\nhouse-committee-agriculture. \n40.  Defendant  Vilsack  claimed  that  he  would  be  committed  to  rooting  out \ndiscrimination within the Department: “I am here today to say that racism and discrimination have \nno place at the Department of Agriculture. I will not tolerate it, and I am committed to rooting it \nout and establishing a relationship with producers that is built on a commitment to equity, trust \nand customer service.” \n41.  On March 26, 2021, Defendant Ducheneaux authored a blog post detailing how \nFSA intends to implement Section 1005 of ARPA. See Zach Ducheneaux, “American Rescue Plan \nSocially Disadvantaged Farmer Debt Payments,” at https://www.farmers.gov/connect/blog/loans-\nand-grants/american-rescue-plan-socially-disadvantaged-farmer-debt-payments.  According  to \nthis document: “USDA recognizes that socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers have faced \nsystemic discrimination with cumulative effects that have, among other consequences, led to a \nsubstantial loss in the  number of socially disadvantaged producers, reduced the amount of \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 9 of 17    PageID 9\nfarmland they control, and contributed to a cycle of debt that was exacerbated during the COVID-\n19 pandemic.”  \n42.  Defendant Ducheneaux explained that through ARPA, FSA will provide “historic \ndebt relief to socially disadvantaged producers including Black/African American, American \nIndian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or Pacific Islander.” \n43.  According to Defendant Ducheneaux, “[a]ny socially disadvantaged borrower with \ndirect or guaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility Loans qualifies.” Defendant \nDucheneaux defines “socially disadvantaged” borrowers as only those borrowers “with direct or \nguaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility Loans” and who are members of one or \nmore of the following racial groups: “Black/African American, American Indian or Alaskan \nnative, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or Pacific Islander.”  \n44.  On  or  about  April  12,  2021,  USDA  updated  its  website  to  provide  further \ninformation about the payments under Section 1005 of ARPA. The website confirms that only \ncertain farmers will be eligible based on race: “Eligible borrowers include those who identify as \none  or  more  of  the  following:  Black/African  American,  American  Indian,  Alaskan  native, \nHispanic/Latino, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.” See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments, \nat  https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan. \n45.  Although public officials have made offhanded comments about remedying past \ndiscrimination committed by the Department of Agriculture, Defendant Vilsack made clear the \nreal reasons for ARPA’s race classifications: “[T]hese provisions recognized that on top of the \neconomic  pain  caused  by  the  pandemic’s  impact  on  the  economy  and  agriculture,  socially \ndisadvantaged farmers are also dealing with a disproportionate share of COVID infection rates, \nhospitalizations,  death  and  economic  hurt.”  See  id.  (“The  law  provides  funding  to  address \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 10 of 17    PageID 10\nlongstanding racial equity issues within the Department and across agriculture.”) (emphasis \nadded). \n46.  To be clear, the program at issue does not target farmers or ranchers who suffered \neconomic pain during the COVID-19 crisis. Nor does it target farmers or ranchers who contracted \nCOVID-19. It does not even target farmers or ranchers who have suffered discrimination, much \nless at the hands of the Department of Agriculture. Under the relevant provisions, it forgives the \nloans of farmers or ranchers whose race matches the race of a group whose members have suffered \ndiscrimination,  per  the  Department  (a  farmer  or  rancher  who  is  a  member  of  a  socially \ndisadvantaged group).  As Secretary Vilsack stated in his testimony, part of his goal is to make it \nclear to Congress and the public that “that prosperous farmers of color means a prosperous \nagricultural sector and a prosperous America.” \n47.  In fact, socially disadvantaged farmers who were previously successful claimants \nin class action settlements (e.g., Pigford, Keepseagle) and received debt forgiveness are eligible \nfor even further debt forgiveness. See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at Question 3 \nat https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq. \n48.  The  USDA  also  instructs  potential  applicants  who  are  “uncertain  of  [their] \ndemographic  designation  on  file  at  FSA”  to  call  their  local  service  center  to  verify  their \nclassification on record, and to update as needed. See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments - Debt \nPayment Timeline, https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/timeline. \n49.  Upon information and belief, on or about May 4, 2021, USDA sent correspondence \nto borrowers who have not previously designated details about their demographic information \nincluding race and ethnicity data, to “encourage” them to contact their local FSA Service center to \nupdate their demographic information in FSA records. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 11 of 17    PageID 11\n50.  The USDA has stated that individuals who receive loan forgiveness under the \nARPA will be eligible for future FSA loans. See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at \nQuestion 27 at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq.  \n51.  As for timing and process, USDA will soon be reaching out to begin providing \npayments to those individuals who meet the racial classifications, based on the information in \nUSDA’s  files.  See  American  Rescue  Plan  Debt  Payments  FAQ,  at  Question  9-10  at \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq (“Question 9: Do I need to apply or take any \naction to receive a debt payment? A. No action on your part is needed right now.”); see id. at \nQuestion 10 (“Details of the process and your debt payment will be reviewed with you prior to \nfinal processing.”).  \n52.  From the week of May 24, 2021, until June—now—USDA will be reaching out to \neligible applicants with Direct Loans. Eligible applicants will receive a letter from FSA outlining \nthe loan balances that will be paid and the payment amount the borrower will receive. See \nAmerican  Rescue  Plan  Debt  Payments  -  Debt  Payment  Timeline, \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/timeline. \n53.  Borrowers who agree with the letter should sign and return it to the FSA. This part \nof the process is “ongoing,” as of the date of this filing. See id. \n54.  FSA will begin to process signed letters for payment in June of 2021. About three \nweeks after FSA receives a signed letter, eligible Direct Loan borrowers will have their eligible \nloan balances paid and will receive a payment of 20% of their total qualified debt by direct deposit, \nwhich may be used for tax liabilities and other fees associated with payment of the debt. See id. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 12 of 17    PageID 12\n55.  On May 26, 2021, the Department posted a document entitled “Notice of Funds \nAvailability; American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 Section 1005 Loan Payment (ARPA)” on the \nFederal Register. See 86 FR 28329, Agency/Docket Number Docket ID FSA-2021-0005. \n56.  The posting on the Federal Register relates that funding availability implementation \nbegan on May 26, 2021.  \n57.  Defendants are currently implementing and will continue to implement Section \n1005 of ARPA to impose a race-based loan forgiveness program. Defendants’ implementation \nincludes the expenditure of federal funds, and Defendants will begin processing letters for payment \nin June of 2021. \nInjury to Rob Holman \n58.  Plaintiff is a farmer who has two FSA direct farm loans and is otherwise eligible \nfor loan forgiveness under Section 1005 of ARPA.  \n59.  But because Plaintiff’s demographic information on file is white, he is ineligible \nfor the loan forgiveness benefit under Section 1005 of ARPA as administered by Defendants. \n60.  Because Plaintiff is ineligible to receive loan forgiveness solely due to his race, he \nhas been denied the equal protection of the laws and has therefore suffered harm.  \n61.  Because  of  Plaintiff’s  demographic  information  on  file,  any  other  farm  loan \nforgiveness he could obtain from USDA would not be up to 120% and would not cover tax \nliabilities. \n62.  If Plaintiff obtained any form of forgiveness of his loan, then he would not be \neligible for any future direct or guaranteed loans, or loan forgiveness on a direct loan, from the \nDepartment. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 13 of 17    PageID 13\n63.  Plaintiff is disadvantaged relative to similarly situated farmers in that they can \nreceive full loan forgiveness, plus 20%, and still receive further loans to upgrade their farming \noperations. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution) \n(Equal Protection Violation) \n \n64.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n65.  “[T]he moral imperative of racial neutrality is the driving force of the Equal \nProtection Clause, and racial classifications are permitted only as a last resort.”  Bartlett v. \nStrickland, 556 U.S. 1, 21 (2009). “[A]ll racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, \nor local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.” Adarand \nConstr., 515 U.S. at 227. “Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving that \nracial  classifications  are  narrowly  tailored  measures  that  further  compelling  governmental \ninterests.” Johnson, 543 U.S. at 505. When the government invokes an interest as meeting strict \nscrutiny, the court must closely examine how the government has gone about satisfying that \ninterest. Fisher v. Univ. of Texas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 299 (2013) (“Strict scrutiny does not \npermit a court to accept a school’s assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible \nway without closely examining how the process works in practice.”). \n66.  “The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause contains \nwithin it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.”  United \nStates v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 14 of 17    PageID 14\n67.  Section 1005 of ARPA imposes racial classifications. Farmers or ranchers with \ndirect  farm  loans,  guaranteed  farm  loans,  or  Farm  Storage  Facility  Loans  qualify  for  loan \nforgiveness only if they are members of one of the following racial groups: Black/African \nAmerican, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, or Asian American or Pacific \nIslander. \n68.  Defendants are responsible for interpreting and implementing Section 1005 of \nARPA. \n69.  Although Plaintiff is a farmer with a direct FSA loan, and otherwise eligible for the \nloan forgiveness program under Section 1005 of ARPA, he is ineligible for this federal benefit \nbecause he is white. \n70.  Plaintiff  is  harmed  by  the  Defendants’  racial  classifications  because,  but  for \nPlaintiff’s skin color, he would be receiving up to 120% of the value of his outstanding debt and \nhe would use that money to benefit his farm and family. \n71.  The racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA do not satisfy strict scrutiny.  \nThere is no compelling interest in providing subsidies by scattershot to farmers and ranchers \nsimply on the basis of their membership in a racial group.  \n72.  Remedying societal discrimination does not constitute a compelling interest under \nthe Fifth Amendment’s equal protection principles. Fisher, 570 U.S. at 318 (permitting such an \ninterest would have “no logical stopping point”). \n73.  Nor is Section 1005 narrowly tailored, since it is both underinclusive—it does not \nprovide relief to white or Caucasian farmers who have contracted COVID-19 or suffered due to \nCOVID-19—and  overinclusive—it  includes  farmers  or  ranchers  who  may  meet  the  racial \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 15 of 17    PageID 15\nqualifications, but who have not contracted COVID-19, suffered uniquely due to COVID-19, or \nsuffered discrimination on any basis.  \n74.  Because the racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA are not narrowly \ntailored to serve a compelling government interest, they cannot survive strict scrutiny. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution) \n(Equal Protection Violation) (Illegally Allowing Future Eligibility) \n \n75.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n76.  Federal law prohibits the Department from providing future loans to persons who \nreceive forgiveness of a direct or guaranteed loan, except in narrowly specified circumstances. See \n7 U.S.C. § 2008h(b). \n77.   Federal law prohibits the Department from providing debt forgiveness on a direct \nloan to any person who had previously received debt forgiveness. See 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(c). \n78.  As the ARPA was originally proposed, Section 1005 provided that the provision of \na payment under paragraph (2) to a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher shall not affect the \neligibility of such farmer or rancher for a farm loan after the date on which the payment is provided. \nSee American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, 117 H.R. 1319, 2021 H.R. 1319, 117 H.R. 1319, Title I, \n§ 1005(3)  (“EFFECT ON ELIGIBILITY.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nprovision of a payment under paragraph (2) to a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher shall not \naffect the eligibility of such farmer or rancher for a farm loan after the date on which the payment \nis provided.”) (proposed language). In other words, Section 1005 as proposed would have allowed \nnon-white farmers to apply for new FSA loans after the Department forgave their FSA loans.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 16 of 17    PageID 16\n79.  This provision was not part of Section 1005, as finally enacted. Thus, the original \nstatutory prohibition on eligibility for future loans remains in effect for anyone who receives loan \nforgiveness. \n80.  Yet on or about May 21, 2021, citing no statutory authority, the Department stated, \nipse dixit, on its website that persons who receive loan forgiveness under the ARPA will be eligible \nfor  future  FSA  loans.  See  American  Rescue  Plan  Debt  Payments  FAQ,  at  Question  27 \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq.  \n81.  Because  the  Department  has  indicated  that  it  will  it  disregard  the  statutory \nprohibition on future loans for anyone who receives forgiveness, but only for those who receive \nloan forgiveness under 1005—a program that is only available in the first place to persons of \nparticular  races  that  do  not  include  Plaintiff’s—Rob  is  harmed  by  the  Defendants’  racial \nclassifications. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Illegally Allowing Future Eligibility) \n82.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as \nif fully set forth herein. \n83.  Because the Department lacks the authority to treat anyone who received loan \nforgiveness as eligible for future loans, but has said that it will do so anyway, it plans to act \nunlawfully. \n84.  Because Plaintiff cannot receive loan forgiveness without forever being ineligible \nfor future loans or loan forgiveness, he will be at a competitive disadvantage relative to similarly \nsituated farmers who can have their current loans paid off and still obtain future loans. \n85.  Because the Department will not consider Plaintiff eligible for future loans or loan \nforgiveness if he were to obtain it, he must pay off his loans in full and not seek forgiveness. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085   Document 1   Filed 06/02/21   Page 17 of 17    PageID 17\nRELIEF REQUESTED \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:  \nA.  Enter a declaratory judgment that the racial classifications under Section 1005 of \nARPA are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection principles protected by the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, both facially and as applied. \nB.  Enter a declaratory judgment that providing further loans to those who receive loan \nforgiveness is illegal and unconstitutional, both facially and as applied. \nC.  Enter  an  order  permanently  enjoining  Defendants  from  applying  racial \nclassifications when determining eligibility for loan modifications and payments under Section \n1005 of ARPA, both facially and as applied.  \nD.  In the alternative, enjoin Defendants from enforcing Section 1005 of ARPA in its \nentirety, and enjoin Defendants from distributing loan assistance under Section 1005 to farmers \nand ranchers, both facially and as applied. \nE.  Enter an award for nominal damages of $1.00. \nF.  Award Plaintiff such costs and attorney fees as allowed by law; and \nG.  Grant Plaintiff such other and further relief as the Court deems appropriate. \n \nDated: June 2, 2021. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n  s/ B.H. Boucek     \nBRADEN H.

Tex.), a related class action.  (ECF No. 45).  Plaintiff has filed a \nresponse and opposes the motion.  (ECF No. 48.) For the reasons set forth below, Defendants’ \nmotion is DENIED. \n“A district court’s power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every \ncourt to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for \nitself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936). However, \n“it is also clear that a court must tread carefully in granting a stay of proceedings, since a party has \na right to a determination of its rights and liabilities without undue delay.” Ohio Envtl. Council v. \nU.S. Dist. Court, S. Dist. of Ohio, E. Div., 565 F.2d 393, 396 (6th Cir. 1977). “[T]he burden is on \nthe party seeking the stay to show that there is pressing need for delay, and that neither the other \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 49   Filed 08/02/21   Page 2 of 4    PageID 1027\nparty nor the public will suffer harm from entry of the order.” Id. at 396; see also Landis, 299 U.S. \nat 255 (“Only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while \na litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both.”) In this case, \nDefendants have not met their burden. \nAs noted by Defendants, Plaintiff filed this action to challenge the USDA’s implementation \nof Section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”).  (ECF No. 1.) This Court \ngranted Plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined disbursement of Section 1005 \nfunds on a nationwide basis pending resolution of the case on the merits.  (ECF No. 41.) \nDefendants contend that Plaintiff is a member of the two classes certified by the Miller Court under \nRule 23(b)(2), and Defendants will be bound by any relief granted to the classes with respect to \nPlaintiff should the Miller plaintiffs’ claim prevail. Defendants argue that, continued adjudication \nof Plaintiff’s claims in this Court, separate from the class to which he belongs, would be \nunnecessarily duplicative and risk inconsistent results. Defendants further argue that a stay would \nnot prejudice Plaintiff who will benefit from any judgment applicable to the classes and who, in \nthe meantime, is protected by the preliminary injunctions entered by the Miller Court and this \nCourt. According to Defendants, a stay would also preserve judicial resources and prevent hardship \nto Defendants who would otherwise be required to continue defending against duplicative claims \nin separate courts. \nPlaintiff has responded by correctly pointing out that his primary authority, Vitolo v. \nGuzman, 999 F.3d 353 (6th Cir. 2021), is not binding precedent in Miller, whereas it is binding in \nthis Court.  (“The government asks the Court to take this matter out of the hands of a Plaintiff who \nhas already prevailed on a motion for preliminary injunction, and have his fate determined by other \nparties with other legal counsel in a court in a different judicial circuit that isn’t bound by Vitolo \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 49   Filed 08/02/21   Page 3 of 4    PageID 1028\nv. Guzman, 999 F.3d 353 (6th Cir. 2021).” (Resp. p. 8, ECF. No. 48.)) This fact alone militates \nagainst granting a motion to stay. \nHowever, beyond that, the Court agrees with Plaintiff’s argument that, if this matter is \nstayed, he “would have no say whatsoever in the pace at which Miller would proceed, including \nwhether extensions of deadlines may be requested or granted by either party, or whether the \ngovernment may seek en banc review by the Fifth Circuit, or whether ultimate review by the U.S. \nSupreme Court may occur.”  (Id. at p. 9.)  Plaintiff could well have to wait years before he is able \nto resume his case in this Court.   \nAdditionally, the interests of the Miller plaintiffs are not completely aligned with Plaintiff’s \ninterests, thus negating Defendants’ claim of duplicative lawsuits. Plaintiff has alleged in his \ncomplaint that loan forgiveness will bar him from obtaining future loans from the USDA. While \nthe government’s position is that it can allow future loan eligibility for those who receive loan \nforgiveness under Section 1005, this Court has not decided the issue, and the issue has not been \nraised in Miller.  Therefore, if the government accepts the suggestion of the Miller Court that \n“defendants will have a choice in whether to respond to the proposed injunction by extending loan \nforgiveness to all farmers and ranchers, or whether to respond by withholding loan forgiveness \nfrom everyone,” Miller, No. 4:21-cv-595, ECF No 18 at PageID 675, and chooses to eliminate the \nrace requirement of Section 1005, Plaintiff’s claim concerning eligibility for future loans will be \nleft unadjudicated. Finally, Plaintiff may choose to opt out of the Miller classes, thus leaving his \ninterest unrepresented.  \n In summary, Defendants have not shown that a stay is warranted in this matter, and their \nmotion to stay proceedings is DENIED.  The parties are DIRECTED to confer and then submit \na joint proposed scheduling order to the Court’s ECF inbox in word processing format within \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01085-STA-jay   Document 49   Filed 08/02/21   Page 4 of 4    PageID 1029\nfourteen (14) days of the entry of this order.  The Clerk of the Court will set a scheduling \nconference by separate order. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n                              s/ S. Thomas Anderson \n          S.
