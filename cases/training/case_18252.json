The case was assigned to District Judge Nancy D Freudenthal. The plaintiff allege that Section 1005's categorization of socially disadvantaged groups prevented her from receiving a government benefit because of her race and thus was a racial classification that violated her Equal Protection rights. Represented by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, and a private law firm, she asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and nominal damages of one dollar.</p>\r\n<p>On July 8, 2021, the debt relief program was halted via preliminary injunction in <a href=\"https://mslegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Order-Granting-Motion-for-Preliminary-Injunction.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Holman v. Vilsack,</a> in which the defendants were enjoined from implementing Section 1005. On August 16, 2021, the district court stayed this case pending the resolution of <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=18120&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miller v. Vilsack</a>, another challenge to the same program being litigated in the Northern District of Texas. In that case, the court had also enjoined the implementation of Section 1005 and certified a class of farmers who would have received benefits if not for the provision's socially disadvantaged groups category.</p>\r\n<p>Congress repealed the race-based program and replaced it with a race-neutral debt relief policy as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion to lift the stay and dismiss this case as moot on October 7, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Circuit Court for the Tenth Circuit in September 2023. Plaintiffs sought to \"unwind\" the payments that were distributed to farmers of color before the injunction was granted. In October of 2023, this appeal was denied on jurisdictional grounds; the aid in question was given to farmers in New Mexico, which was beyond the court's jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court on March 11, 2024. The Supreme Court denied the petition on May 13, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>As Plaintiffs have exhausted all avenues for appeal, this case is closed.</p>",

Plaintiff  opposes  Defendants’  motion,  arguing  Plaintiff’s  injury \ncontinues because others who are similarly situated experienced a windfall based on their \nrace by way of payments made under Section 1005 which should be unwound to restore \nconstitutional  balance.    Based  on  the  conclusion  that  there  is  no  ongoing  case  or \ncontroversy under which Plaintiff can obtain relief on the claims pled, the Court GRANTS \nDefendants’ motion to lift stay and DISMISSES the case. \n   \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 41   Filed 10/07/22   Page 2 of 5\nBackground \n  The parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of this case so the \nCourt will not repeat it here in any detail.  Suffice to say that Section 1005 provided debt \nrelief to farmers and ranchers based on their race.  Even though Plaintiff is a rancher with \nqualifying debt, her Norwegian and Swedish ancestry disqualified her from Section 1005 \nrelief.  Plaintiff filed her complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and “other and \nfurther relief as the Court deems appropriate.” ECF 1, p. 14.  Plaintiff’s contention is that \nSection  1005  –  and  Defendants’  implementation  of  that  section  –  violates  the  U.S. \nConstitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws. \nThe  Court  stayed  this  case  recognizing,  among  other  considerations,  that  the \npreliminary injunctions entered by other courts prohibited enforcement of Section 1005’s \nracial exclusions.  ECF 33.  Now Congress has definitively acted to repeal Section 1005.  \nSee Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) § 22008.  However, before the injunctions and \nthe repeal, Defendants tested “the effectiveness of the procedures” to deliver debt relief by \nmailing five Section 1005 “offer letters” to eligible recipients in New Mexico.  ECF 39-1, \n¶ 28.  New Mexico was selected for the test “based in part on having one of the larger \nvolumes of direct loan borrowers eligible for [debt relief] and a high level of experienced \nstaff.”  Id.  Four eligible test recipients responded and received debt relief payments. Id. at \n¶¶ 28-30. \nApplicable Legal Standard \n  “Mootness is a threshold issue because the existence of a live case or controversy is \na constitutional prerequisite to federal court jurisdiction.” Disability Law Ctr. v. Millcreek \n2 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 41   Filed 10/07/22   Page 3 of 5\nHealth  Ctr.,  428  F.3d  992,  996  (10th  Cir.  2005)  (quoting  McClendon  v.  City  of \nAlbuquerque, 100 F.3d 863,867 (10th Cir. 1996)).  The Tenth Circuit summarized the \nmootness doctrine as follows: \nIn cases involving mootness, “[t]he starting point for [our] analysis is the \nfamiliar proposition that 'federal courts are without power to decide questions \nthat cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.’” DeFunis v. \nOdegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974) (quoting \nNorth Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413, \n(1971)). The mootness doctrine “derives from the requirement of Art. III of \nthe Constitution under which the exercise of judicial power depends upon the \nexistence of a case or controversy.” Id. The Supreme Court has described it \nas “the doctrine of standing set in a time frame: The requisite personal \ninterest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must \ncontinue  throughout  its  existence  (mootness).”  U.S.  Parole  Comm'n  v. \nGeraghty,  445  U.S.  388,  397,  100  S.Ct.  1202,  63  L.Ed.2d  479  (1980) \n(quoting Henry P. Monaghan, Constitutional Adjudication: The Who and \nWhen, 82 Yale L.J. 1363,1384 (1973)). “The crucial question is whether \ngranting a present determination of the issues offered will have some effect \nin the real world.” Wyoming v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 414 F.3d 1207, 1212 \n(10th Cir. 2005)  (quoting Citizens for Responsible  Gov't State Political \nAction Comm. v. Davidson, 236 F.3d 1174, 1223 (10th Cir. 2001)). “Put \nanother way, a case becomes moot ‘when a plaintiff no longer suffers “actual \ninjury that can be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” ’ ” Ind v. Colo. \nDep't of Corr., 801 F.3d 1209, 1213 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting Rhodes v. \nJudiscak, 676 F.3d 931, 933(10th Cir. 2012)). \n \nGhailani v. Sessions, 859 F.3d 1295, 1300-1301 (10th Cir. 2017). \nDiscussion \n  There is no question that Section 1005 has been repealed.  Consequently, Plaintiff’s \nrequest to enjoin Defendants from applying, implementing, or enforcing Section 1005 is \nmoot.  Simply put, the legislative repeal means that Defendants lack any authority to apply, \nimplement, or enforce Section 1005 and this Court cannot alter this situation. \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 41   Filed 10/07/22   Page 4 of 5\n  Further,  the  repeal  also  moots  Plaintiff’s  requests  for  declarations  relating  to \nPlaintiff’s eligibility for Section 1005 loan forgiveness and the constitutional soundness of \nfurther loans to those who receive Section 1005 loan forgiveness.  Following the repeal of \nSection 1005, neither Plaintiff nor anyone else may receive loan forgiveness or further \nloans under this section.  Therefore, this Court lacks any power to alter or affect the rights \nof Plaintiff or others relating to these questions. \n  The only remaining issue is Plaintiff’s argument that the case is not moot because \nDefendants’ past actions in the New Mexico test continue to injure Plaintiff’s equal \nprotection rights.  According to Plaintiff, this injury can only be remedied by a declaration \nthat Defendant’s actions in testing Section 1005 violated the constitution, and an award of \n“other relief” to require that Defendants claw back the benefits provided.  For the following \nreasons, Plaintiff’s last argument is unpersuasive. \nIn  returning  to  Tenth  Circuit  precedent,  the  analysis  is  clearer  by  reviewing \nmootness in the context of “standing set in a timeframe.”  Ghailani, 859 F.3d at 1300 \n(quoting U.S. Parole Comm’n, 445 U.S. at 397).  Plaintiff’s personal interest is specifically \npled.  Plaintiff raises cattle and farms hay in Wyoming.  ECF 1, ¶ 20.  Plaintiff took out a \nreal estate loan from the Farm Service Agency (FSA), and she would be eligible for the \nSection 1005 loan forgiveness program, and future FSA loans, 1 except for the fact that she \nis not a member of any of the racial groups that are eligible for loan forgiveness.  Id. at ¶¶ \n13.   \n \n1 The law prohibits her from obtaining further loans from the Department of Agriculture if she received any form of \ndebt forgiveness on her FSA loan, with the only exception being loan forgiveness under Section 1005. ECF 1, ¶ 22. \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 41   Filed 10/07/22   Page 5 of 5\nGiven the repeal of Section 1005, Plaintiff’s personal interest in Section 1005 \nbenefits (i.e., receiving loan forgiveness and future FSA loans) is now entirely lost to her \nand everyone else.  In other words, while Plaintiffs personal interest in the benefits of \nSection 1005 existed at the commencement of her case, that interest doesn’t continue now.  \nAlso, any “claw back” of past benefits to others in New Mexico in no way advances or \naffects the specific personal interest Plaintiff pled in this case.  The actual injury pled was \nthat Plaintiff could not receive loan forgiveness with an opportunity to obtain a future FSA \nloan, and this injury cannot be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.  In short, this is \na classic case for the application of the mootness doctrine.\nFinally,  Plaintiff  has  no  persuasive  argument  to  equalize  the  playing  field  by \nunwinding Defendant’s test of Section1005.  Completely apart from any considerations of \nrace, Plaintiff was never within that so-called “playing field” for the simple reason that her \nproperty is in Wyoming.  Thus, Plaintiff fails to show any actual injury, in 2021 or now, \nfrom the actions taken by Defendants that solely affected FSA loan borrowers in New \nMexico.\nFor the forgoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to lift stay and \ndismiss the case.  The stay entered by order of the Court (ECF 33) is LIFTED.  Because \nthe Court lacks jurisdiction, this case is DISMISSED.\nDated this 7th day of October, 2022.\nNANCY D.

VILSACK, in his official   \ncapacity as Secretary of Agriculture, et al., \n   \n    Defendants.   \n   \n \nORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY \n \n \n  This matter comes before the Court on Defendants’ motion to stay proceedings \npending resolution of related class action. CM/ECF Document (Doc.) 27.  Defendants \nidentify a related class action, Miller v. Vilsack, 4:21-cv-595 pending in the Northern \nDistrict of Texas, wherein the judge ordered class certification under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure  23  and  enjoined  Defendants  from  administering  a  recently  enacted  loan-\nforgiveness program under Section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) \nfor socially disadvantaged farmers. Doc. 28-1.  Defendants argue Plaintiff is a member of \nthe classes certified by Miller and Defendants will be bound by any relief granted to the \nclasses with respect to Plaintiff should the equal protection claim prevail.  Because of this, \nDefendants request a stay of this case as continued adjudication of the case would be \nunnecessarily duplicative (thus waste resources) and risk inconsistent results.  Defendants \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 2 of 11\nalso argue a stay would not prejudice Plaintiff who is a class member and currently \nprotected  by  the  preliminary  injunction  entered  in  Miller  as  well  as  the  nationwide \ninjunctions entered by other courts.   \nPlaintiff opposes a stay arguing Defendants have failed to satisfy the standard for \ngranting a stay and Plaintiff would be prejudiced because Plaintiff has no control over \nMiller’s pace or the legal theories advanced.  For the reasons that follow, the Court is \npersuaded that Defendants satisfy the grounds for a stay of this case and any potential for \nprejudice can be mitigated by the Court. \nBackground \n  Plaintiff is a Wyoming rancher and young  mother of Danish, Norwegian and \nSwedish ancestry. Doc. 1, p. 2.  In 2012, she took out a real estate loan from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency which is covered under the terms of \nARPA. Id. at p. 4.  She alleges she would be eligible for the loan forgiveness program in \nSection 1005 of ARPA, and future FSA loans, except for the fact that she is not a member \nof any of the racial groups that are eligible for loan forgiveness. Id.  She alleges Section \n1005 of ARPA imposes racial classifications in violation of the Equal Protection clause of \nthe  Fifth  Amendment  of  the  U.S.  Constitution.  Id.  at  pp.  11-12.    She  also  alleges \nDefendants  are  exceeding  their  authority  in  administering  Section  1005,  by  illegally \npermitting persons who receive loan forgiveness under ARPA to be eligible for future FSA \nloans. Id. at pp. 12-13.  Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. \n   \n2 \n \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 3 of 11\nApplicable Legal Standard \n  “The District Court has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its \npower to control its own docket.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997). “Allowing \nthe same issue to be decided more than once wastes litigants’ resources and adjudicators’ \ntime.” B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc., 575 U.S. 138, 140 (2015); see also Colo. \nRiver Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976) (“[a]s between \nfederal district courts, . . . the general principle is to avoid duplicative litigation”). Thus, it \nis a “well established policy that a court may, in its discretion, defer or abate proceedings \nwhere  another  suit,  involving  the  identical  issues,  is  pending  .  .  .  and  it  would  be \nduplicative, uneconomical, and vexatious to proceed.” Blinder, Robinson & Co. v. SEC, \n692 F.2d 102, 106 (10th Cir. 1982).  \n  However, courts are cautioned that the power to stay must not to be exercised \nlightly, considering a party’s “right to proceed in court should not be denied except under \nthe most extreme circumstances.” Commodity Futures Trading Com’n v. Chilcott Portfolio \nMgmt., Inc., 713 F.2d 1477, 1484 (10th Cir. 1983).  In exercising such discretion, courts \nweigh various factors, including (1) the interests of judicial economy, (2) hardship or \ninequity if the movant is required to go forward, (3) harm to the non-movant in the issuance \nof a stay, (4) and the public interests at stake. See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Or. Steel \nMills, Inc., 322 F.3d 1222, 1227 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting Landis, et al. v. North American \nCo., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 57 (1936) (“[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the \npower inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with \n3 \n \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 4 of 11\neconomy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants”).1  In short, the decision \non whether to grant a stay is largely committed to the “carefully considered judgment” of \nthe district court.  Colo. River Water Conservation Dist., 424 U.S. at 818. \nDiscussion \nInterests of Judicial Economy \n  Defendants argue a stay promotes judicial economy by avoiding simultaneous, \nduplicative litigation of Plaintiff’s claim in multiple courts and the risk of conflicting \nresults.  Defendants also argue courts regularly stay cases pending resolution of related \nclass actions. See, e.g., Yazzie v. Ray Vickers’ Special Cars, Inc., 180 F.R.D. 411, 414 \n(D.N.M. 1998) (class actions seek “to facilitate judicial economy by avoidance of multiple \nsuits on the same subject matter” and “to deter inconsistent results”); Taunton Gardens Co. \nv. Hills, 557 F.2d 877, 879 (1st Cir. 1977) (upheld stay as “within the district court’s \ndiscretion to find that the public interest, the court’s interest in efficient procedures, and \nthe ‘interest of justice’” should allow the government “a reasonable opportunity to resolve \nits obligations in the national class action”). \n  Defendants also argue Miller was the first-filed case and under the first-filed rule, \n“when two courts have concurrent jurisdiction, the first court in which jurisdiction attaches \n \n1 Plaintiff relies on United Steelworkers in arguing for a different set of factors applicable to \nmotions for stay, which includes the requirement to demonstrate movant’s likelihood of prevailing \nin the related proceeding.  For the reasons argued by Defendants, the Court agrees that the factors \nargued by Plaintiff (taken from Battle v. Anderson, 564 F.2d 388, 397 (10th Cir. 1977)), relate to \na motion to stay enforcement of a judgment, not a motion to stay consideration of a claim.  For \nthis reason, the Court will not consider Plaintiff’s argument that Defendants have failed to establish \nthat they have a likelihood of succeeding on the merits in Miller. \n4 \n \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 5 of 11\nhas priority to consider the case.” Hospah Coal Co. v. Chaco Energy Co., 673 F.2d 1161, \n1163 (10th Cir. 1982) (citation omitted).  Under the “first-filed-rule,” Defendants argue the \nparties and issues are identical given that Plaintiff is a class member in the Miller case \nwhich certified classes for purposes of resolution of the principle issue brought in this case. \nSee Wakaya Perfection, LLC v. Youngevity Int’l, Inc., 910 F.3d 1118, 1124 (10th Cir. 2018) \n(factors for consideration are “(1) the chronology of events, (2) the similarity of the parties \ninvolved, and (3) the similarity of the issues or claims at stake.” (citation omitted)). \n  Plaintiff argues judicial economy is not a relevant factor and, if it were relevant, \nDefendants fail to satisfy their burden.  Plaintiff argues Miller does not involve the same \nparties, will not adequately consider all Plaintiff’s interests and is not truly duplicative.  As \nto the argument on the “first-filed-rule,” Plaintiff argues the amended complaint in Miller \nwhich added plaintiffs who held farm loans was filed a week after Plaintiff filed her \ncomplaint, thus her complaint in this case is the first filed. \n  As to this factor, the Court concludes the interests of judicial economy strongly \nfavor a stay.  Defendants are correct that Miller involves the same parties given that \nPlaintiff is a member of the classes certified by the Miller court under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(2) upon a finding that the four threshold requirements for class certification are met \nand “a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of \nthe class.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 360 (2011); Doc. 28-1.  Plaintiff \ndoes not dispute that she is a class member and would receive relief in Miller but argues \nshe may opt-out of the classes.  This scenario is speculative especially considering that \nRule 23(b)(2) classes are “mandatory classes” with no opt-out opportunity. Walmart, 564 \n5 \n \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 6 of 11\nU.S. at 362.  Should Plaintiff seek and be permitted to opt-out, though, Plaintiff may advise \nthe Court and seek to lift the stay. \n  Plaintiff also argues her interests in the pace of the litigation and the right to advance \nher own legal theories through her own counsel are not adequately protected by a stay.  \nThese interests are present in every situation wherein courts stay individual actions which \noverlap with claims pursued by a certified class of which the individual is a member.  See, \ne.g., Richard K. v. United BeHavioral Health, 2019 WL 3083019, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.).  \nFurther, Plaintiff’s argument that her interests are only adequately served by her own \nattorneys flies against the Miller court’s finding that counsel in the Miller case “will \nadequately represent the interests of class members similarly situated in zealously pursuing \nthe requested relief.” Doc. 28-1, p. 12. \n  Further, Plaintiff argues the issues are not identical as she has a second claim, not \npled  in  Miller,  that  Defendants  are  illegally  permitting  persons  who  receive  loan \nforgiveness under ARPA to be eligible for future FSA loans.  While this is correct, \nDefendants are also correct that Plaintiff’s interests in her second claim are adequately \nprotected by the Miller court’s preliminary injunction because no person will receive loan \nforgiveness under ARPA for purposes of gaining eligibility for future FSA loans. \n  Finally, the chronology of events supports a stay.  Jurisdiction vested with the Miller \ncourt prior to the commencement of this action,2 and the Miller court has already taken \n \n2 While Plaintiff argues the Court should consider only the date of the amended complaint in Miller \nfor determining which case was filed first, this argument is unpersuasive.  There is no dispute that \njurisdiction vested first with the Miller court. \n6 \n \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 7 of 11\nsignificant  action  through  its  preliminary  injunction  and  certification  of  classes.    In \ncomparison, this action has not proceeded beyond the filing of Plaintiff’s complaint and \nDefendant’s motion for stay. \n  For all the foregoing reasons, the Court finds the interests of judicial economy weigh \nstrongly in favor of a stay. \nHardship or Inequity if the Movant is Required to go Forward \n  Defendants argue, in the absence of a stay, they would be required to defend against \nidentical, significant claims in multiple courts at the same time, including in eleven other \ncases around the country.  Plaintiff argues the motion should be denied for failure to show \n“irreparable harm.” \n  In considering the relevant factor, the Court is satisfied that Defendants need not \nshow irreparable harm, but rather Defendants are called upon “to make out a clear case of \nhardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that \nthe stay for which [Defendant] prays will work damage to some one else.” Landis, 299 US \nat 256.  Plaintiff argues the concerns of defending against duplicative claims in separate \ncourts does not satisfy the relevant factor. \n  As to this factor, the Court finds Defendants have made a case of hardship and \ninequity if required to defend against twelve cases simultaneously on varying schedules \nand in different jurisdictions.  There is no dispute that this is a burden on the government \nand, consequently on the taxpaying public.  Whether this is “a clear case” is subject to \nreasonable debate.  However, this factor must be considered in light of the importance of \nthe issues at stake, and also judged (or balanced) against the possibility of damage or harm \n7 \n \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 8 of 11\nto Plaintiff.  There is no dispute that the issues at stake in the litigation pending in the \nvarious districts are quite significant.  Plaintiffs in all cases are seeking a constitutional \nruling which, if successful, would invalidate federal legislation. The significance of the \nissues is supportive of Defendants’ argument that they have made a clear case of hardship \nor inequity.  Further, given the Court’s finding that a stay is not likely to harm Plaintiff, the \nCourt finds, on balance, this factor weighs somewhat in favor of a stay. \nHarm to the Non-Movant in the Issuance of a Stay\nDefendants argue Plaintiff is a member of classes certified by the Miller court \nspecific to Plaintiff’s claim against the continued enforcement of the racial exclusions in \nSection 1005 of ARPA and, in the meantime, Plaintiff will benefit by the preliminary \ninjunction entered by courts preserving the status quo which prohibits enforcement of the \nracial exclusions. Defendants also point out that both cases are at early stages, thus a stay \nin this case would not disrupt or delay litigation, but rather would promote efficient \nresolution.\nPlaintiff argues a stay would cause substantial harm because Plaintiff has no say as \nto the pace at which Miller would proceed in the district court or perhaps on appeal.  \nPlaintiff also argues she will be required to watch counsel other than her own making \nstrategic decisions and legal arguments that she has no say in.  Finally, Plaintiff identifies \nher second claim of illegal action as a claim not subject to adjudication in Miller, and that \nthis claim warrants timely adjudication.\nPlaintiff’s arguments that she will be harmed by a stay have been adequately \ndiscussed in the context of the factor relating to judicial economy.  Further, the likelihood \n8\n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 9 of 11\nof harm can be mitigated by the Court.  Should progress in the Miller case flounder, or in \nthe unlikely event that the injunction is lifted, or the class is decertified, or the Miller court\nallows Plaintiff to opt out of the Rule 23(b)(2) classes, Plaintiff can certainly seek an order \nlifting the stay. In short, the Court finds that its authority to control the duration of the stay \nadequately mitigates any fair possibility that the stay will work damage against Plaintiff.\nConsequently, this factor weighs in favor of a stay.\nThe Public Interests at Stake\nDefendants argue the public interests are served by a stay given the importance of \nthe issues at stake and the public’s interest in just and efficient resolution of cases –\nespecially those like this one –of “extraordinary public moment.” Clinton,520 U.S.at707 \n(citation omitted).\nPlaintiff argues the public in general has a strong interest regarding the prompt and \nefficient handling of all litigation, specifically including this litigation, and that Defendants \nfail to satisfy their burden on this factor.\nThe public interests at stake include not just the prompt and efficient handling of \nthis case.  Rather, those interests include the importance of the issues at stake as previously \ndiscussed,  and  the  prompt  and  efficient  resolution  of  those  issues  from  the  overall \nperspective of the litigation pending in all twelve district courts.  The taxpayer interests are \nnot served by requiring the government to defend multiple suits on the same subject matter \nin all twelve courts.  The interests of farmers and ranchers who are disqualified from \nseeking loan-forgiveness under Section 1005 of ARPA (including Plaintiff) are not served \nby the potential for inconsistent results announced at varying times, should all cases \n9\n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 33   Filed 08/16/21   Page 10 of 11\nproceed separately.  And those interests which prompted Congress to enact Section 1005 \nof ARPA are similarly not served by a potential for inconsistent results.  Considering the \npublic interests at stake in a case such as this, which exceed in scope Plaintiff’s interest in \n“the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named part[y] \nonly,” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. 348, the Court finds this factor weighs strongly in \nfavor of a stay.\nConclusion\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Court finds and concludes Defendants have met \ntheir burden to warrant a stay of this case.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s \nMotion to Stay Proceedings Pending Resolution of Related Cass Action (Doc. 27).  On \ngood cause, Plaintiff may, at any time, seek to lift the stay.  Further, Defendants shall file \nand serve a status report every six (6) months reporting on the Miller case progress, and\nshall also PROMPTLY report any action:\n1. By the Miller court to decertify any class or otherwise proceed such that plaintiffs\nin the Miller case no longer represent themselves and “all farmers and ranchers in\nthe  United  States  who  are  currently  excluded  from  the  definition  of  ‘socially\ndisadvantaged farmer or rancher,’ as defined in 7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(5) – (6) and as\ninterpreted by the Department of Agriculture.” Doc. 28-1, p. 23, fn. 3.\n2.

M. Carpenter is a Wyoming rancher and the young mother of a 19-month \n2  old son.  She is of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish ancestry.  She and her husband Tim sell \n3  weaned calves, grass finished or com fed beef, grass hay, livestock protein supplements, custom \n4  hay, and cull cows and bulls.  Because she has no job other than ranching, her entire family's \n5 \nincome stems from the ranch.  Although she meets the definition of \"socially disadvantaged\" for \n6 \nsome purposes relating to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency loans, she \n7 \nis not covered by the American Rescue Plan Act, signed in March 2021.  On the other hand, if she \n8 \nwere a different race- regardless of whether she was affected by COVID-19 or in fact needed loan \n9 \nforgiveness- the federal government would automatically forgive her loan. \n10 \nMs. Carpenter brings this complaint against Defendants Thomas J. Vilsack, Secretary of \n11 \nthe United States Department of Agriculture, and Zach Ducheneaux, Administrator of the Farm \n12 \nService Agency (FSA), as follows: \n13 \nINTRODUCTION \n14 \n1.  The Constitution requires that \"all racial classifications imposed by government \n15 \nmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\"  Johnson v.  California, 543 U.S. \n16 \n499, 505 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \"We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every \n17 \ncontext,  even for  so-called  'benign'  racial  classifications,  such  as  race-conscious  university \n18 \nadmissions policies, race-based preferences in government contracts, and race-based districting \n19 \n20  intended to improve minority representation.\"  Id. at 505 (internal citations omitted). \n21  2.  Equal  protection  under  the  law  is  the  cornerstone  of modem-day  American \n22  constitutional jurisprudence.  It is the principle etched into our nation and was \"[p] urchased at the \n23  price of immeasurable human suffering.\" A dar and Constructors, Inc. v. Pefia, 515 U.S. 200, 240 \n24  (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). \n25  3.  In March 2021, however, Congress opted to enshrine into law race classifications \n26  that divide American citizens by skin color, and which are unmoored from any interest that the \n27  government may have in remedying past discrimination. \n28 \n2 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 3 of 15\n1  4.  In  the American Rescue  Plan  Act of 2021,  H.R.  1319,  117th Cong.  (2021) \n2  (\"ARPA\"), Congress allotted billions of dollars in debt relief to \"socially disadvantaged\" farmers \n3  and ranchers. The program will erase the debts of certain farmers and ranchers who took out loans, \n4 \nbut only for farmers or ranchers of races. \n5 \n5.  The program does so by providing a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the \n6 \noutstanding indebtedness, to remain available until expended, for the cost of loan modifications \n7 \nand payments under this section. \n8 \n6.  A \"socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher\" is defined by federal law, 7 U.S.C. § \n9 \n2279(a)(5), as \"a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group.\" \n10 \n7.  In turn, a \"socially disadvantaged group\" is a \"group whose members have been \n11 \nsubjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without \n12 \nregard to their individual qualities.\"  7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(6). \n13 \n8.  The United  States Department of Agriculture (\"USDA\")  interprets the phrase \n14 \n\"socially disadvantaged group\" to include explicit racial classifications.  Indeed, to be eligible for \n15 \nARPA's debt relief, farmers and ranchers must be \"Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, \n16 \nHispanic, or Asian, or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.\"  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments \n17 \nFAQ, at Question 1, athttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq (last visited, May 23, \n18 \n2021). \n19 \n9.  The USDA considers Plaintiff Leisl Carpenter to be \"socially disadvantaged\" in \n20 \n21  some respects regarding her loan status, although not under ARPA. See id. at Question 1 (\"Section \n22  2501  [of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990] does not include gender. \n23  While some women may be eligible [for ARPA debt relief] due to their race or ethnicity, gender \n24  is not an eligible criterion in and of itself, based on the law enacted by Congress.\").  She is not \n25  considered to be a part of any of these racial categories and would generally be considered white \n26  or Caucasian. \n27 \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 4 of 15\n10.  Defendants are responsible for running this race-based loan-forgiveness program \n2  through the Farm Service Agency. Defendants assert that the purpose of this program is to remedy \n3  \"systemic racism\" within USDA and more broadly \"across agriculture.\" \n4  11.  The United States Constitution \"forbids\" discrimination by the federal government \n5 \n\"against any citizen because of his race.\"  Adarand, 515 U.S. at 216 (internal citations omitted). \n6 \nWhen the government distributes \"benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications,\" as \n7 \nDefendants do in this case, the government bears the burden of meeting \"strict scrutiny.\" In other \n8 \nwords, the government must prove that its discriminatory benefit is narrowly tailored and serves a \n9 \ncompelling government interest.  Id. at 227. It cannot do so here. \n10 \n12.  Defendants' use of race discrimination as a tool to end \"systemic racism\" is patently \n11 \nunconstitutional and should be enjoined by the Court. Enjoining this discriminatory conduct will \n12 \npromote equal rights under the law for all American citizens and promote efforts to stop further \n13 \nracial discrimination because \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop \n14 \ndiscriminating on the basis of race.\" Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No.1, 551 \n15 \nU.S. 701, 748 (2007) (plurality opinion). \n16 \nPARTIES \n17 \n13.  Plaintiff Leis! Maria Carpenter owns a ranch in Albany County, near Laramie, in \n18 \nthe District of Wyoming.  Ms. Carpenter is a Wyoming rancher whose family started ranching in \n19 \nthe Centennial Valley following their immigration to the United States from Denmark, Norway, \n20 \n21  and Sweden.  In 2012, she took out a real estate loan from the FSA, which is covered under the \n22  terms of ARPA.1 Ms. Carpenter's Promissory Note names the FSA's office located in Wheatland, \n23  Wyoming, as the payee for the USDA.  Ms. Carpenter would be eligible for the loan forgiveness \n24  program in Section 1005 of ARPA, and future FSA loans, except for the fact that she is not a \n25  member of any of the racial groups that are eligible for loan forgiveness. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n1 Ms. Carpenter's loan was taken in her maiden name, Leis! Maria Stonum. \n4 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 5 of 15\n1  14.  Defendant Thomas J. Vilsack is the Secretary of Agriculture. He is responsible for \n2  leading the USDA, which includes the FSA.  Under Section 1005 of ARPA, Defendant Vilsack is \n3  required to provide debt relief to certain farmers based on race. He is sued in his official capacity. \n4 \n15.  Defendant Zach Ducheneaux is the Administrator of the FSA. Among other things, \n5 \nFSA oversees certain loan programs.  Under Section 1005 of ARPA, FSA will provide debt relief \n6 \nto certain farmers with direct loans or USDA-backed loans based on race. He is sued in his official \n7 \ncapacity. \n8 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9 \n16.  This Court has jurisdiction over this complaint under 28 U.S. C. §§ 1331 and 1343 \n10 \nbecause this case presents a substantial question of federal law, specifically whether Section 1005 \n11 \nof  ARPA- and  Defendants'  implementation  of  that  section-violates  the  United  States \n12 \nConstitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws. \n13 \n17.  This Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment and to order injunctive \n14 \nrelief and other relief that is necessary and proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n15 \n18.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(l).  A substantial \n16 \npart of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in this district, Defendants maintain one or \n17 \nmore offices and employees in this district, a substantial part of the property subject to this action \n18 \nis situated in this district, and a plaintiff resides in this district. \n19 \n20  Ms. Carpenter is a Rancher with Outstanding Debt on an FSA Loan \n21  19.  Despite being the young mother of an 18-month old son, Ms. Carpenter continues \n22  to ranch in Albany County, Wyoming. \n23  20.  Ms. Carpenter raises about 575 head of cattle and farms hay on her 160-acre ranch, \n24  which has been in her family since they homesteaded the land in 1894. \n25  21.  Ms. Carpenter has FSA loans and is otherwise eligible for the loan forgiveness \n26  program in Section 1005 of ARPA, except that her ancestors were from Denmark, Norway, and \n27  Sweden, and she is commonly considered white or Caucasian. \n28 \n5 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 6 of 15\n1  22.  Under existing law, Ms. Carpenter would be prohibited from obtaining further loans \n2  from the Department if she received any form of debt forgiveness on her FSA loans. \n3  23.  Ms. Carpenter's Promissory Note contains the following statement, on Page 1: \n4  \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) prohibits discrimination in all of its programs and \n5 \nactivities on the basis of race, color, national origin . ... \" \n6 \nPresident Biden Signs the American Rescue Plan Act \n7 \n24.  On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed ARPA into law. \n8 \n25.  In a Rose Garden ceremony, President Biden emphasized that the $1.9 trillion in \n9 \nspending authorized by ARPA was necessary in response to COVID-19.  Biden said: \"It directly \n10 \naddressed the emergency in this country.  Because it focuses on what people need most.\"  See \n11 \nPresident Joe Biden on the American Rescue Plan and recovery, CNBC YouTube Channel, at \n12 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj2zCWetrl Y (Time Stamp 3:33). \n13 \n26.  In Section 1005 of ARPA, Congress appropriated \"such sums as may be necessary\" \n14 \nto pay for the cost of loan modifications and payments for \"each socially disadvantaged farmer or \n15 \nrancher as of January 1, 2021.\"  ARPA§ 1005(a)(l)-(2). \n16 \n27.  Section  1005(a) requires  Defendant Vilsack to  use the  appropriated  funds  to \n17 \n\"provide a payment in an amount up to 120 percent of the outstanding indebtedness of each socially \n18 \ndisadvantaged farmer or rancher as of January 1, 2021.\"  ARPA§ 1005(a)(2). \n19 \n28.  A \"socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher\" has \"indebtedness\" if that farmer or \n20 \n21  rancher owes money on a \"direct farm loan made by the Secretary\" or a \"farm loan guaranteed by \n22  the Secretary.\" ARPA§ 1005(a)(2)(A)-(B). \n23  29.  Finally, Section 10 05(a)(3) states that \"the term 'socially disadvantaged farner or \n24  rancher' has the meaning given in section 2501(a) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and \n25  Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)).\" That Act defines \"socially disadvantaged farmer or \n26  rancher\" as \"a farmer or rancher who is a member of a socially disadvantaged group.\" 7 U.S.C. § \n27  2279(a)(5). \"Socially disadvantaged group,\" in turn, is defined as \"a group whose members have \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 7 of 15\n1  been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as members of a group without \n2  regard to their individual qualities.\"  7 U.S.C. § 2279(a)(6). \n3  30.  Defendants Vilsack and Ducheneaux are responsible for the implementation of the \n4 \nloan forgiveness provisions in ARPA Section 1005. \n5 \n31.  On March 25, 2021, Defendant Vilsack offered written testimony to the House of \n6 \nRepresentatives Committee on Agriculture.  See Opening Statement of Thomas J  Vilsack Before \n7 \nthe  House  Committee  on  Agriculture  - Remarks  as  Prepared,  (March  25,  2021),  at \n8 \nhttps://www.usda.gov/medialpress-releases/2021/03/25/opening-statement-thomas-j-vilsack \n9 \nhouse-committee-agriculture (last visited, May 24, 2021). \n10 \n32.  In  true  doublespeak  fashion,  Defendant  Vilsack  claimed  that  he  would  be \n11 \ncommitted to rooting out discrimination within the Department: \"I am here today to say that racism \n12 \nand discrimination have no place at the Department of Agriculture. I will not tolerate it, and I am \n13 \ncommitted to rooting it out and establishing a relationship with producers that is built on a \n14 \ncommitment to equity, trust and customer service.\" \n15 \n33.  On March 26, 2021, Defendant Ducheneaux authored a blog post detailing how \n16 \nFSA intends to implement Section 1005 of ARPA.  See Zach Ducheneaux, \"American Rescue \n17 \nPlan  Socially  Disadvantaged  Farmer  Debt  Payments,\"  (March  26,  2021),  at \n18 \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/connect/blog/loans-and-grants/american-rescue-plan-socially \n19 \ndisadvantaged-farmer-debt-payments.  According to  this  document:  \"USDA recognizes  that \n20 \n21  socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers have faced systemic discrimination with cumulative \n22  effects that have, among other consequences, led to a substantial loss in the number of socially \n23  disadvantaged producers, reduced the amount of farmland they control, and contributed to a cycle \n24  of debt that was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" \n25  34.  Defendant Ducheneaux explained that through ARPA, FSA will provide \"historic \n26  debt relief to socially disadvantaged producers including Black/African American, American \n27  Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or Pacific Islander.\" \n28 \n7 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 8 of 15\n1  35.  According to Defendant Ducheneaux, \"[a ]ny socially disadvantaged borrower with \n2  direct or guaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility Loans qualifies.\" Defendant \n3  Ducheneaux defines \"socially disadvantaged\" borrowers as only those borrowers \"with direct or \n4  guaranteed farm loans as well as Farm Storage Facility Loans\" and who are members of one or \n5 \nmore of the following racial groups:  \"Black/African American, American Indian or Alaskan \n6 \nnative, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian American or Pacific Islander.\" \n7 \n36.  On  or  about  April  12,  2021,  USDA  updated  its  website  to  provide  further \n8 \ninformation about the payments under Section 1005 of ARPA.  The website confirms that only \n9 \ncertain farmers will be eligible based on race: \"Eligible borrowers include those who identify as \n10 \none  or  more  of the  following:  Black/African  American,  American  Indian,  Alaskan  native, \n11 \nHispanic/Latina, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.\" See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments, \n12 \nat https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan. \n13 \n37.  Although  public  officials  have  made  stray  comments  about  remedying  past \n14 \ndiscrimination committed by the Department of Agriculture, Defendant Vilsack made clear the \n15 \nreal reasons for ARPA' s race classifications: \"[T]hese provisions recognized that on top of the \n16 \neconomic pain  caused  by the pandemic's  impact on the  economy  and  agriculture,  socially \n17 \ndisadvantaged farmers are also dealing with a disproportionate share of COVID infection rates, \n18 \nhospitalizations, death and  economic hurt.\"  See  id.  (\"The law provides funding to address \n19 \nlongstanding racial equity issues within the Department and across agriculture.\")  (emphasis \n20 \nadded). \n21 \n22  38.  To be clear, the program at issue does not target farmers or ranchers who suffered \n23  economic pain during the COVID-19 crisis. Nor does it target farmers or ranchers who contracted \n24  COVID-19.  It does not even target farmers or ranchers who have suffered discrimination, much \n25  less at the hands of the Department of Agriculture.  Under the relevant provisions, it forgives the \n26  loans of farmers or ranchers whose race matches the race of a group whose members have suffered \n27  discrimination,  per the Department.  (A  farmer  or rancher who  is  a  member of a  socially \n28 \ndisadvantaged group.)  As Secretary Vilsack stated in his testimony, part of his goal is to make it \n8 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 9 of 15\n1  clear to  Congress and the public that \"that prosperous farmers  of color means  a prosperous \n2  agricultural sector and a prosperous America.\" \n3  39.  In fact, socially disadvantaged farmers who were previously successful claimants \n4  in class action settlements (e.g., Pigford, Keepseagle) and received debt forgiveness are eligible \n5 \nfor further debt forgiveness.  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at Question 3. \n6 \n40.  The USDA has stated that individuals who receive loan forgiveness under the \n7 \nARPA will be eligible for future FSA loans.  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at \n8 \nQuestion 29 at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq. \n9 \n41.  As for timing and process, it appears that USDA will soon be reaching out to begin \n10 \nproviding payments  to  those  individuals  who  meet the  racial  classifications,  based  on  the \n11 \ninformation in USDA's files.  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments FAQ, at Question 9-10 \n12 \n(\"Question 9: Do I need to apply or take any action to receive a debt payment? A. No action on \n13 \nyour part is needed right now.\"); see id.  at Question 10 (\"Details of the process and your debt \n14 \npayment  will  be  reviewed  with  you  prior  to  final  processing.\")  at \n15 \nhttps://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan/arp-faq. \n16 \n42.  Upon information and belief, the USDA further instructs potential applicants who \n17 \nare \"uncertain of [their demographic designation on file at FSA\" to call their local service center \n18 \nto verify their classification on record, and to update as needed. \n19 \n43.  Upon information and belief, on or about May 4, 2021, USDA sent correspondence \n20 \n21  to borrowers who have not previously designated details about their demographic information \n22  including race and ethnicity data, to \"encourage\" them to contact their local FSA Service center to \n23  update their demographic information in FSA records. \n24  44.  Beginning in the week of May 24, 2021 and continuing through June 2021, Direct \n25  Loan borrowers will receive a letter from FSA, outlining the payment they will receive, and that \n26  they will need to sign and return it. Guaranteed Loan borrowers will be available within 120 days. \n27  See American Rescue Plan Debt Payments, at https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan. \n28 \n9 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 10 of 15\n1  45.  The FSA will begin to process signed letters for payments in June.  About three \n2  weeks after a signed letter is received, qualified socially disadvantaged borrowers will receive 20% \n3  of their qualified debt by direct deposit which may be used for tax  liabilities and other fees \n4  associated with payment of the debt. Payments will be issued on a rolling basis. See American \n5 \nRescue PlanDebt Payments, https://www.farmers.gov/americanrescueplan. \n6 \n46.  Defendants are currently implementing and will continue to implement Section \n7 \n1005 of ARPA to impose a race-based loan forgiveness program.  Defendants' implementation \n8 \nincludes the expenditure of federal funds, and Defendants will begin processing letters for payment \n9 \nin June of2021. \n10 \nInjury to Ms. Carpenter \n11 \n47.  Plaintiff is a rancher who has an FSA direct farm loan and is otherwise eligible for \n12 \nloan forgiveness under Section 1005 of ARPA. \n13 \n48.  But because Plaintiff is white, she is ineligible for the loan forgiveness benefit \n14 \nunder Section 1005 of ARPA as administered by Defendants. \n15 \n49.  Were  Plaintiff eligible  for  the  loan forgiveness  benefit,  she would have  the \n16 \nopportunity to make additional investments in her property, expand her ranch, purchase equipment \n17 \nand supplies, and otherwise support her family. Because Plaintiff is  ineligible to receive loan \n18 \nforgiveness solely due to her race, she has been denied the equal protection of the laws and has \n19 \ntherefore suffered harm. \n20 \n21  50.  Because Plaintiff is considered white, any other farm loan forgiveness she could \n22  obtain from USDA would not be up to 120% and would not cover tax liabilities. \n23  51.  If Plaintiff obtained any form of forgiveness of her loan, then she would not be \n24  eligible for any future direct or guaranteed loans, or loan forgiveness on a direct loan, from the \n25  Department. \n26  CAUSES OF ACTION \n27 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 11 of 15\n(Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution) \n1 \n(Equal Protection Violation) \n2 \n52.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as \n3 \nif fully set forth herein. \n4 \n53.  \"[T]he moral  imperative of racial  neutrality is the  driving force of the Equal \n5 \nProtection Clause, and  racial  classifications are permitted only as a  last resort.\"  Bartlett v. \n6 \nStrickland, 556 U.S. 1, 21 (2009).  \"[A]ll racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, \n7 \nor local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. Adarand, \n8 \n515 U.S. at 227.  \"Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving that racial \n9 \nclassifications are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\" \n10 \nJohnson v. California, 543 U.S. at 505. When the government invokes an interest as meeting strict \n11 \nscrutiny, the court must closely examine how the government has gone about satisfying that \n12 \ninterest.  Fisher v.  Univ.  ofTexas at Austin, 570 U.S. 297, 299 (2013) (\"Strict scrutiny does not \n13 \npermit a court to accept a school's assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible \n14 \nway without closely examining how the process works in practice.\"). \n15 \n54.  \"The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause contains \n16 \n17  within it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.\"  United \n18  States v.  Windsor, 570 U.S. 744, 774 (2013). \n19  55.  Section 1005 of ARPA imposes racial classifications.  Farmers or ranchers with \n20  direct  farm  loans,  guaranteed  farm  loans,  or Farm  Storage Facility  Loans  qualify  for  loan \n21  forgiveness  only  if they  are members of one of the following  racial  groups:  Black/African \n22  American, American Indian or Alaskan native, Hispanic or Latino, or Asian American or Pacific \n23  Islander. \n24  56.  Defendants are responsible for interpreting and  implementing Section 1005  of \n25 \nARPA. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n11 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 12 of 15\n57.  Although Plaintiff is a rancher with a direct FSA loan, and otherwise eligible for \n2  the loan forgiveness program under Section 1005 of ARPA, she is ineligible for this federal benefit \n3  because she is white. \n4  58.  Plaintiff is  harmed  by  the  Defendants'  racial  classifications  because,  but for \n5 \nPlaintiffs skin color, she would be receiving up to 120% of the value of her outstanding debt and \n6 \nshe would use that money to benefit her ranch and family. \n7 \n59.  The racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA do not satisfy strict scrutiny. \n8 \nThere is no compelling interest in providing subsidies by scattershot to farmers and ranchers \n9 \nsimply on the basis of their membership in a racial group. \n10 \n60.  Remedying societal discrimination does not constitute a compelling interest under \n11 \nthe Fifth Amendment's equal protection principles. Fisher v. Univ. ofTexas at Austin, 570 U.S. at \n12 \n318 (permitting such an interest would have \"no logical stopping point\"). \n13 \n61.  Nor is Section 1005 narrowly tailored, since it is both underinclusive-it does not \n14 \nprovide relief to white or Caucasian farmers who have contracted COVID-19 or suffered due to \n15 \nCOVlD-19-and  overinclusive-it  includes  farmers  or  ranchers  who  may  meet  the  racial \n16 \nqualifications, but who have not contracted COVID-19, suffered uniquely due to COVID-19, or \n17 \nsuffered discrimination on any basis. \n18 \n62.  Because the racial classifications under Section 1005 of ARPA are not narrowly \n19 \ntailored to serve a compelling government interest, they cannot survive strict scrutiny. \n20 \n21  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \n(Illegally Allowing Future Eligibility) \n23  63.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above as \n24  if fully set forth herein. \n25 \n64.  Prior to the enactment of the ARPA, the Department was prohibited, by statute, \n26 \nfrom providing future loans to persons who receive forgiveness of a direct or guaranteed loan, \n27 \nexcept in narrowly specified circumstances.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(b ). \n28 \n12 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 13 of 15\n1  65.  Prior to the enactment of the ARPA, the Department was prohibited, by statute, \n2  from providing debt forgiveness on a direct loan to any person who had previously received debt \n3  forgiveness.  See 7 U.S.C. § 2008h(c). \n4  66.  As the ARPA was originally proposed, Section 1005 provided that the provision of \n5 \na payment under paragraph (2) to a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher shall not affect the \n6 \neligibility of such farmer or rancher for a farm loan after the date on which the payment is provided. \n7 \nSee American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, 117 H.R. 1319, 2021 H.R. 1319, 117 H.R. 1319, Title I, \n8 \n§ 1 005(3)  (\"EFFECT ON ELIGIBILITY.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n9 \nprovision of a payment under paragraph (2) to a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher shall not \n10 \naffect the eligibility of such farmer or rancher for a farm loan after the date on which the payment \n11 \nis provided.\") (proposed language). \n12 \n67.  This provision did not make it into Section 1005 as enacted. \n13 \n68.  Yet on or about May 21, 2021, citing no statutory authority, the Department stated, \n14 \nipse dixit, on its website that persons who receive loan forgiveness under the ARPA will be eligible \n15 \nfor  future  FSA  loans.  See  American  Rescue  Plan  Debt  Payments  FAQ,  at  Question  29 \n16 \nhttps :// www .farmers. gov I americanrescueplan/arp-fag. \n17 \n69.  Because the Department has  no  authority to  treat anyone  who received  loan \n18 \nforgiveness as eligible for future loans, but has said that it will do so anyway, it will be acting \n19 \nunlawfully. \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n13 \n\nCase 0:21-cv-00103-NDF   Document 1   Filed 05/24/21   Page 14 of 15\n1  RELIEF REQUESTED \n2  Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \n3  A.  Enter a declaratory judgment that the racial classifications under Section 1005 of \n4  ARPA are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection principles of the Fifth Amendment of the \n5 \nUnited States Constitution. \n6 \nB.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Plaintiff is eligible to receive loan forgiveness \n7 \npursuant to ARPA. \n8 \nC.  Enter a declaratory judgment that providing further loans to those who receive loan \n9 \nforgiveness is illegal. \n10 \nD.  Enter  an  order  permanently  enjoining  Defendants  from  applying  racial \n11 \nclassifications when determining eligibility for loan modifications and payments under Section \n12 \n1005 of ARPA. \n13 \nE.  Enter an order permanently enjoining Defendants from declaring Plaintiff ineligible \n14 \nfor future FSA loan participation, to the extent that such participation is permitted for recipients \n15 \nof ARPA relief. \n16 \nF.  In the alternative, enjoin Defendants from enforcing Section 1005 ofthe American \n17 \nRescue Plan of 2021  in its entirety and enjoining Defendants from distributing loan assistance \n18 \nunder Section 1005 to farmers and ranchers. \n19 \nG.  Enter an award for nominal damages of$1.00. \n20 \n21  H.  Award Plaintiff such costs and attorney fees as allowed by law; and \n22  I.
