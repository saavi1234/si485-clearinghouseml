    "summary": "<p>This was a nationwide class action filed by U.S. businesses that challenged the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services's (USCIS) pattern and practice of arbitrarily denying H-1B nonimmigrant employment-based petitions to classify market research analyst positions as \"specialty occupations.\" On April 16, 2020, companies who had such petitions denied filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs sued USCIS and their Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Director under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. Represented by the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the American Immigration Council, and private counsel, plaintiffs asked the court to set aside and vacate the denials of plaintiffs&rsquo; and class members' H-1B petitions, to declare that the defendants unlawfully engaged in a pattern and practice of misapplying the law, to enjoin defendants from its interpretation of relevant petition criteria to deny petitions for market research analysts, and to award attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen.</p>\r\n<p>H-1B immigrant visa classification allows highly educated noncitizens to work for American employers in specialty occupations. Specialty occupations are those that require particular knowledge and skills for which a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher (or its equivalent) in a specific specialty is required. USCIS had allegedly been arbitrarily denying these plaintiffs' petitions regarding classification because they mistakenly found they did not satisfy the &ldquo;first regulatory test,&rdquo; which requires a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in the specialty be typically required for such work as outlined by the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH). USCIS has been denying petitions on the grounds that several degrees or fields of study may qualify a person to work as a market research analyst, which would mean that the degree requirement is not a specific specialty. The plaintiffs argued that the fact that multiple degrees may prepare a person to be a market research analyst does not negate that the typical degrees attained by most who pursue the occupation are closely related to market research and therefore constitute a specialty.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved to sever and dismiss the plaintiffs' claims on August 4, 2020. The defendants sought severance because they argued that the claims were impermissibily joindered and also moved for dismissal on the basis that two of the named plaintiffs' claims were mooted because their H-1B petitions were approved. On September 14, the court denied these motions. Specifically, the court held that permissive joinder was still valid as arising out of the same transaction or occurrence. The court similarly concluded that the plaintiffs whose petitions were granted retained an interest in the litigation because of the possibility that the allegedly wrongful behavior would recur.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for class certification was granted in part on November 17, 2020. During the course of litigation, the Department of Homeland security issued an interim final rule amending the process for evaluating H-1B petitions, requiring a \"direct relationship between degree field(s) and duties of the position.\" A petition would not be granted if the attainment of a general degree would suffice. Because the interim final rule altered the criteria underlying H-1B petitions, the court certified a narrow class that involved:</p>\r\n<p>\"All U.S. employers who in 2019 through December 6, 2020 filed, or will file, a petition (Form I-129 or any successor) with USCIS for an H-1B classification under 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) for a market research analyst where:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>USCIS denied or will deny the petition solely or in part based on a finding that the OOH entry for market research analyst does not establish that the occupation is a specialty occupation, and thus does not satisfy 8 C.F.R. &sect; 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and</li>\r\n<li>But for this finding, the petition would be approved.\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs were appointed as class representatives.</p>\r\n<p>On August 20, 2021, the parties reached a settlement regarding the adjudication of future H-1B petitions for market research analyst positions. The settlement outlined that H-1B adjudicators would more expansively grant petitions claiming market research analyst positions to be specialty occupations. This included past denials, which the parties agreed could be reopened for potential class members. After a fairness hearing, Judge Susan van Keulen approved the final settlement agreement on October 19, 2021. The case was voluntarily dismissed by stipulation of the parties 3 days later. The court retained jurisdiction to settle disputes over the 5-year course of the settlement.</p>",

Jaddou, in her official \n15  capacity as USCIS Director (collectively, “the parties”). The Settlement Agreement and Release will \n16  become effective upon approval by the Court pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n17  Procedure (“Fed. R. Civ. P.”) as set forth below.  \n18  I.  RECITALS \n19  WHEREAS: \n20  A.  On April 16, 2020, Plaintiffs MadKudu Inc. and Quick Fitting, Inc. commenced a civil \n21  action against Defendants on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, seeking class \n22  certification, designation of class counsel, and declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs 2nd Street \n23  USA, Inc. and Hanguang International Inc. later joined the lawsuit. \n24  B.  USCIS had denied Plaintiffs’ H-1B petitions for market research analyst positions, based \n25  on the agency’s determination that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Outlook Handbook \n26  (“OOH”) entry for market research analysts does not establish that this occupation is a “specialty \n27  occupation” under the first regulatory criterion in 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1). Plaintiffs sought \n28  relief for U.S. employers whose H-1B petitions were denied on this basis, and, but for USCIS’s decision \n  1 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 2 of 15\n \n \n \n1  regarding the OOH entry for market research analyst, the U.S. employers’ H-1B petitions would have \n2  been approved. \n3  C.  On November 17, 2020, the Court certified, in part, the proposed class under Federal \n4  Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2). Dkt. No. 59. The Court defined the certified class as:   \n5  All U.S. employers who in 2019 through December 6, 2020 filed, or will file, a petition (Form I-\n129 or any successor) with USCIS for an H-1B classification under 8 U.S.C. \n6 \n§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) for a market research analyst where: \n• USCIS denied or will deny the petition solely or in part based on a finding that the \n7 \nOOH entry for market research analyst does not establish that the occupation is a \nspecialty occupation, and thus does not satisfy 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and \n8 \n • But for this finding, the petition would be approved. \n9 \nD.  On February 2, 2021, Plaintiffs moved to amend the class definition. On February 18, \n10 \n2021, Defendants filed the certified administrative record, and on March 15, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a \n11 \nmotion for summary judgment. The parties subsequently entered settlement negotiations and reached an \n12 \nagreement, and, while these negotiations were ongoing, the Court stayed the completion of briefing on \n13 \nboth summary judgment and the Plaintiffs’ motion to amend the class definition. \n14 \nE.  Plaintiffs and Defendants, through counsel, have conducted discussions and good faith \n15 \nnegotiations regarding a compromise and settlement of the action with a view to settling all matters in \n16 \ndispute. \n17 \nF.  Defendants deny all liability with respect to the action, deny the allegations in the \n18 \nAmended Complaint, and deny that they acted improperly in any way, but have agreed to the settlement \n19 \nand dismissal of the action with prejudice to avoid the substantial expense, inconvenience, and \n20 \ndistraction of further protracted litigation; and put to rest and terminate the action and any and all Settled \n21 \nClaims. \n22 \nG.  Considering the benefits that Plaintiffs and Class Members will receive from settlement \n23 \nof the action and the risks of litigation, class counsel have concluded that the terms and conditions of \n24 \nthis Agreement are fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Plaintiffs and Class Members. \n25 \nPlaintiffs have agreed that Defendants shall be released from the Settled Claims pursuant to the terms \n26 \nand provisions of this Agreement, and have agreed to the dismissal with prejudice of this action and all \n27 \nSettled Claims. \n28 \n  2 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 3 of 15\n \n \n \n1  II.  TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n2    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the benefits flowing to the parties from the Agreement, \n3  the parties hereby stipulate and agree, subject to the approval of the Court pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. \n4  23(e), as follows:  \n5    A.  Definitions \n6    For purposes of this Settlement Agreement, the following terms shall be defined as: \n7  1.  “Action” means the civil action captioned MadKudu Inc., et al. v. U.S. Citizenship \n8  and Immigration Services, et al., No. 20-cv-2653 (N.D. Cal.).  \n9  2.  “Effective Date” means the date upon which this Agreement shall become \n10  effective, as set forth in Section VI., below. \n11  3.  “Plaintiffs’ Counsel” or “Class Counsel” means the American Immigration \n12  Council, Van Der Hout LLP, American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), \n13  Joseph and Hall, P.C., and Kuck Baxter Immigration LLC. Should these entities change \n14  their names or merge with other entities, those new entities also shall qualify as Class \n15  Counsel. \n16  4.   “Settled Claims” means all claims for injunctive or declaratory relief relating to \n17  Defendants’ interpretation of the Occupational Outlook Handbook entry for market \n18  research analyst challenged in this action, whether know or unknown, that could have \n19  been brought on behalf of Class Members at any time prior to the Effective Date. \n20    B.  Class Definition \n21    1.  The parties stipulate to an amended class defined as:  \n22  All U.S. employers who from January 1, 2019 through [the date that the \nCourt  approves  the  settlement]  filed  a  petition  (Form  I-129  or  any \n23  successor form) with USCIS for an H-1B classification under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) for a market research analyst where:  \n24   \n•  USCIS denied the petition based on a finding that the OOH \n25  entry for market research analyst, as it exists on the date of the \nsettlement agreement, does not establish that the occupation is a \n26  specialty  occupation,  and  thus  does  not  satisfy  8  C.F.R. \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1), as it exists on the date the Court approves \n27  the settlement; and  \n \n28  •  But for this finding, the petition would be approved.  \n \n  3 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 4 of 15\n \n \n \n1      2.  Plaintiffs will dismiss as moot their pending motion to amend the class definition. \n2      3.  The amended class, as defined in this Settlement Agreement, does not constrain or \n3  restrict USCIS’ authority to amend or revise in the future 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1). \n4  C.  Clarification for Adjudicating Future H-1B Petitions for Market Research Analysts \nUnder the First Regulatory Criterion \n5 \n1.  USCIS will agree to issue guidance to all H-1B adjudicators which states the \n6 \nfollowing: \n7 \na.  The Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) description for market \n8 \nresearch analysts in existence on the Effective Date demonstrates that the \n9 \nmarket research analyst occupation satisfies the first regulatory criterion as \n10 \nfound in 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (as it exists on the date the \n11 \nCourt approves the settlement). That is, subject to Sections II.C.1.b-d, \n12 \nbelow, the said OOH entry for market research analysts demonstrates that \n13 \na bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty is normally required to \n14 \nenter the occupation. However, if the record shows that the petitioner \n15 \nwould consider someone as qualified for the position based on less than a \n16 \nbachelor’s degree in a specialized field directly related to the position \n17 \n(e.g., an associate’s degree, a bachelor’s degree in a generalized field of \n18 \nstudy without a minor, major, concentration, or specialization in market \n19 \nresearch, marketing, or research methods (see Sections II.C.1.b and c), or \n20 \na bachelor’s degree in a field of study unrelated to the position), then the \n21 \nposition would not meet the statutory and regulatory definitions of \n22 \nspecialty occupation at 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1) and 8 C.F.R. \n23 \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(ii); \n24 \nb.  A bachelor’s or higher degree in business administration with an official \n25 \nminor, major, concentration, or specialization in market research, \n26 \nmarketing, or research methods, as annotated on a transcript, diploma, or \n27 \nother official document from the registrar of the institution of higher \n28 \n  4 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 5 of 15\n \n \n \n1  education, is not a generalized degree; consequently, if a petitioner will \n2  accept such a degree, the position may qualify as a specialty occupation.  \n3  i.  Where it is demonstrated that an official transcript, diploma, or \n4  other official documentation from the registrar of the institution of \n5  higher education is unavailable, the petitioner may submit for \n6  consideration: \n7  •  a letter from the Chair of the relevant department, a \n8  professor in the relevant department, or an official \n9  academic advisor from the institution of higher education \n10  that issued the degree relied upon confirming that a minor, \n11  major, concentration, or specialization in market research, \n12  marketing, or research methods was obtained by the \n13  beneficiary; and/or  \n14  •  an unofficial transcript.  \n15  USCIS will evaluate all submitted evidence, including any \n16  explanation as to why an official document is unavailable, and give \n17  it appropriate weight in determining if the petitioner has \n18  established eligibility. \n19  c.  A market research analyst position that accepts a bachelor’s or higher \n20  degree in communications, statistics, computer and information \n21  technology, and/or social science may qualify as a specialty occupation if \n22  the petitioner is able to demonstrate that an official minor, major, \n23  concentration, or specialization in market research, marketing, or research \n24  methods is necessary to perform the job duties. An official minor, major, \n25  concentration, or specialization is demonstrated by an annotation on a \n26  transcript or diploma or other official document from the registrar of the \n27  institution of higher education. Where it is demonstrated that an official \n28  transcript, diploma, or other official documentation from the registrar of \n  5 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 6 of 15\n \n \n \n1  the institution of higher education is unavailable, the petitioner may \n2  submit for consideration: \n3  •  a letter from the Chair of the relevant department, a professor in \n4  the relevant department, or an official academic advisor from the \n5  institution of higher education that issued the degree relied upon, \n6  confirming that a minor, major, concentration, or specialization in \n7  market research, marketing, or research methods was obtained by \n8  the beneficiary; and/or  \n9  •  an unofficial transcript.  \n10  USCIS will evaluate all submitted evidence, including any explanation as \n11  to why an official document is unavailable, and give it appropriate weight \n12  in determining if the petitioner has established eligibility. \n13  d.  In any case where the petitioner will accept a bachelor’s or higher degree \n14  in any of the fields specified in Sections II.C.1.b and c, USCIS must issue \n15  a Request for Evidence (“RFE”) and not deny the petition outright if \n16  evidence as to whether the petitioner requires the official minor, major, \n17  concentration, or specialization in market research, marketing, or research \n18  methods was not initially provided. The position may still qualify as a \n19  specialty occupation if the petitioner demonstrates that the degrees in the \n20  fields of study listed above, as applicable, along with the official minor, \n21  major, concentration, or specialization in market research, marketing, or \n22  research methods, is necessary to perform the job duties. \n23  e.  USCIS will adjudicate any H-1B petition for a market research analyst, \n24  whether pending on or filed after the date that the Court approves the \n25  Settlement Agreement, on a case-by-case basis, and where the burden \n26  remains on the petitioner to establish eligibility by a preponderance of the \n27  evidence. In any adjudication involving a petition for a market research \n28  analyst position, the following will apply:  \n  6 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 7 of 15\n \n \n \n1  i.  When reviewing the case under the first regulatory criterion, \n2  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1), USCIS will specify whether it \n3  found the position to be a bona fide market research analyst in \n4  accordance with the OOH entry for that occupation; where USCIS \n5  determines that the position is not a bona fide market research \n6  analyst position, it will explain the basis for that determination. For \n7  purposes of this Settlement Agreement, a bona fide market \n8  research analyst job or position is one which is consistent with the \n9  OOH entry for that occupation that is in effect on the date that the \n10  Court approves the Settlement Agreement, subject to the \n11  stipulations set forth in Sections II.C.1.b and c. \n12  ii.  USCIS will adjudicate the petition with the understanding that a \n13  bona fide market research analyst position satisfies the first \n14  regulatory criterion for specialty occupation at 8 C.F.R. \n15  § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1), in effect on the date that the Court \n16  approves the Settlement Agreement, subject to the stipulations set \n17  forth in Sections II.C.1.b and c. \n18  iii.  Provided, however, that where a petitioner will accept an \n19  associate’s degree as sufficient for the position, the petition will \n20  not satisfy 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(ii) \n21  (definition of “specialty occupation”), and may be denied; and \n22  where the petitioner will accept a degree other than market \n23  research, communications, statistics, computer and information \n24  technology, business administration, and/or social science (subject \n25  to the stipulations set forth in Sections II.C.1.b and c), the position \n26  will not, without more, satisfy the OOH entry for market research \n27  analyst and may be denied on that basis. \n28  2.  USCIS agrees to include the points enumerated in II.C.1, supra, in guidance to all \n  7 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 8 of 15\n \n \n \n1  H-1B adjudicators. USCIS will share its guidance with Plaintiffs’ counsel. \n2    D.  Reopening Past Denials of Class Members’ Petitions \n3      1.  Procedure by which class members may request reopening: \n4  a.  Class members shall have 180 days in which to request that their denied \n5  H-1B petitions for market research analyst be reopened. No fee will be \n6  charged for such a request. \n7  b.  USCIS will provide, within ten (10) business days from the Effective \n8  Date, an announcement with directions for class members to send a \n9  motion to reopen on Form I-290B, with a cover sheet to clearly identify \n10  that the motion is filed by a claimed member of the class, to a designated \n11  USCIS service center(s) for the receipt and adjudication of class members’ \n12  reopening requests. The 180 days in Section II.D.1.a shall commence on \n13  the date that USCIS announces directions for class members to send a \n14  motion to reopen as provided in this paragraph.  \n15  c.  Class members should state in the reopening request that the petitioner \n16  requests reopening; provide a receipt number for the petition; confirm that \n17  the offer of employment as stated in the petition remains valid; indicate if \n18  the petitioner wants a new start date and/or end date for the validity period \n19  (as long as the new date(s) falls within the period in the certified Labor \n20  Condition Application (“LCA”) previously submitted with the petition that \n21  the petitioner is seeking to reopen); and demonstrate class membership in \n22  accord with Section II.D.2, infra. \n23  2.  To demonstrate class membership, a petitioner will submit with its reopening \n24  request a copy of USCIS’ denial of the original H-1B petition. Petitioners who appealed \n25  to, and had their appeal dismissed by the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO), will \n26  submit a copy of the AAO decision (which hereafter also is referred to as a “denial”) \n27  instead of the Service Center denial. To establish class membership, the denial of the \n28  original H-1B petition must show that:  \n  8 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 9 of 15\n \n \n \n1  a.  The petition was filed on or after January 1, 2019, through [insert date of \n2  the Court approval of the settlement]; for cases in which the decision \n3  does not include the filing date of the petition, the petitioner will submit a \n4  copy of USCIS’ receipt notice for the petition; \n5  b.  USCIS found that the job fell within the market research analyst \n6  occupation;  \n7  c.  USCIS considered the OOH entry for market research analysts; \n8  d.  USCIS found that the market research analyst occupation was not a \n9  specialty occupation under the first regulatory criterion; and   \n10  e.  The sole basis for the denial was that the position was not within a \n11  specialty occupation. \n12  3.  Standard by which USCIS will determine whether to reopen and approve an H-1B \n13  petition in response to a reopening request: \n14  a.  Determine whether the petitioner established that it is a class member: \n15  i.  Was the petition filed on or after January 1, 2019, through the \n16  [date that the Court approves the settlement]? \n17  ii.    Is there any amount of time remaining on the period specified in \n18  the certified LCA at the time that the reopening request was filed? \n19  iii.  In the denial, did USCIS determine that the position fell within the \n20  market research analyst occupation? \n21  iv.  In the denial, did USCIS consider the OOH entry for market \n22  research analysts under the OOH entry for market research \n23  analysts and the regulations in effect on the date that the Court \n24  approves the Settlement Agreement? \n25  v.  Did USCIS deny the petition under the first regulatory criterion in \n26  effect on the date that the Court approves the Settlement \n27  Agreement, based on a finding that petitioner had not established \n28  that the position fell within a specialty occupation? \n  9 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 10 of 15\n \n \n \n1  vi.  Was the sole basis for the denial a determination that the position \n2  was not a specialty occupation? \n3  b.  If USCIS determines that the petitioner is not a class member according to \n4  the standards set forth in Section II.D.3.a, it may reject the reopening \n5  request. \n6  c.  A petitioner may indicate a new start date and end date for the validity \n7  period, as long as the new start date and end date falls within the period in \n8  the certified LCA previously submitted with the petition that the petitioner \n9  is seeking to reopen. USCIS must grant the petitioner’s request for a \n10  different start date and end date for the validity period if the date(s) \n11  requested by the petitioner falls within the period specified in the certified \n12  LCA previously submitted with the petition that the petitioner is seeking \n13  to reopen. \n14  d.  If USCIS finds that the petitioner is a class member and that there is time \n15  remaining on the period specified in the certified LCA, it must reopen the \n16  petition and re-adjudicate it under the standard set out in Section II.C.1 \n17  supra. If an issue of fraud or willful misrepresentation comes to USCIS’ \n18  attention, it will reopen and send the petitioner an RFE or a Notice of \n19  Intent to Deny (“NOID”). \n20  e.  USCIS shall abide by the recent deference guidance issued by USCIS on \n21  April 27, 2021, in those cases involving the same parties and facts in \n22  which there was a prior approval. See \n23  https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-issues-policy-guidance-on-\n24  deference-to-previous-decisions. In such cases, USCIS should defer to the \n25  prior approval unless there was a material error, material change, or a new \n26  material fact(s).  \n27  f.  USCIS will not deny a named plaintiff’s case without first issuing a RFE \n28  or NOID and permitting the named plaintiff to submit additional \n  10 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 11 of 15\n \n \n \n1  documentation and argument to show eligibility and qualification.  \n2  4.  USCIS will decide all MadKudu class members’ reopening requests within 90 \n3  days of its receipt of the physical file at the adjudicating office for all timely-filed \n4  reopening requests of class members in which, at the time that the class member submits \n5  the reopening request, there is any amount of time remaining on the period specified in \n6  the previously filed LCA. USCIS will attempt to prioritize reopening requests for \n7  petitions with LCAs expiring in less than 90 days after the reopening request is properly \n8  filed with USCIS. \n9  5.  For any MadKudu class member’s reopening request that USCIS intends to deny, \n10  USCIS will first send the petitioner a NOID identifying the ground for denial and provide \n11  the petitioner a period of 30 days from the notice date to respond. USCIS will decide the \n12  request within 60 days of its receipt of petitioner’s response to the NOID. \n13    E.  Notice to Class Members \n14  1.  The parties mutually will agree upon language for a Notice that explains the \n15  settlement to class members. \n16  2.  Prior to the Court holding a fairness hearing on the Settlement Agreement, USCIS \n17  will post this Notice on its website, along with a copy of the Settlement Agreement. \n18  USCIS then will update its website with a notice stating the outcome of the Court’s \n19  fairness hearing.  \n20  3.  USCIS will announce the Settlement Agreement through its social media, \n21  directing readers to its website posting. \n22  4.  Plaintiffs will distribute the Notice and Settlement Agreement though various \n23  American Immigration Lawyers Association outlets and other relevant forums. \n24    F.  General Provisions \n25  1.  The Parties will submit the Settlement Agreement, the Notice to Class Members \n26  and a joint stipulation regarding the class definition, see B.1, to the Court for its approval. \n27  2.  Defendants will reopen and re-adjudicate Plaintiff Hanguang’s petition in \n28  accordance with Sections II.C.1 and II.D.3.c-f, within 14 days of the Court’s approval of \n  11 \n \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 85-1   Filed 08/20/21   Page 12 of 15\n \n \n \n1  the Settlement Agreement. \n2  4.  Each party shall bear its own fees and costs. \n3  III.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION \n4  If there is a claim of a breach of this Settlement Agreement, the parties shall mutually resolve to \n5  address the matter within 90 calendar days of the date of notice of an alleged breach. The Court retains \n6  jurisdiction to resolve any disputes over enforcement of the Settlement Agreement that are not resolved \n7  between the parties pursuant to this section. \n8  IV.  EFFECTIVE DATE \n9  This Settlement Agreement will be effective on the date the Settlement Agreement receives final \n10  approval by the Court and shall remain in effect for a period of five (5) years beginning five (5) days \n11  after the date of approval. Subject to the dispute resolution and modification procedures in Sections III \n12  and VI.B, respectively, the Court retains jurisdiction to resolve any disputes over enforcement of the \n13  Settlement Agreement that arise and are presented to the Court during the effective period. \n14  V.  RELEASE: SCOPE AND EFFECT OF RELEASE \n15  As of the Effective Date, Plaintiffs and Class Members, on behalf of themselves, their heirs, \n16  executors, administrators, representatives, attorneys, successors, assigns, agents, affiliates, and partners, \n17  and any persons they represent, by operation of any final judgment entered by the Court, fully, finally, \n18  and forever release, relinquish, and discharge the Defendants of and from any and all of the Settled \n19  Claims.

This Release shall not apply to claims that arise or accrue after the termination of \n23  this Settlement Agreement. \n24  VI.  ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS \n25  A.

Employing boilerplate language and uniform faulty reasoning, Defendant U.S. \n2 \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) routinely and unlawfully denies nonimmigrant \n3 \nemployment-based petitions filed by U.S. employers under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), \n4 \n5  1184(c)(1) and 1184(i), also known as H-1B petitions, to classify market research analyst \n6 \npositions as a “specialty occupation.” Defendant USCIS’ denials violate the Immigration and \n7 \nNationality Act (INA) and implementing regulations, and the Administrative Procedure Act \n8 \n(APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq. Plaintiffs MadKudu Inc. and Quick Fitting, Inc., two U.S. \n9 \ncorporations, challenge Defendant USCIS’ denial of H-1B petitions they filed on behalf of \n10 \nnoncitizens they sought to hire in the market research analyst occupation, as well as Defendant \n11 \n12  USCIS’ pattern and practice of arbitrarily and unlawfully denying petitions for market research \n13  analysts filed by similarly situated H-1B petitioners.   \n14 \n2.  The H-1B nonimmigrant visa classification allows highly educated noncitizens to \n15 \nwork for U.S. employers in specialty occupations. A specialty occupation is one which requires \n16 \nthe theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge for which a \n17 \nbachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty (or its equivalent) is required. See 8 U.S.C. \n18 \n§ 1184(i)(1). \n19 \n20  3.  By regulation, a U.S. employer petitioner can establish that a position is within a \n21  specialty occupation through any one of several tests set forth in the governing regulation. \n22 \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (2020). Relevant here is the first test, which authorizes a position \n23 \nto qualify as a specialty occupation if “[a] baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is \n24 \nnormally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position.” 8 C.F.R. \n25 \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020) (hereinafter, the first regulatory test). Where Defendant USCIS \n26 \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 3 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 4 of 21\n \n \ndetermines that a U.S. employer petitioner satisfies this test, it has demonstrated that the \n1 \noccupation is a “specialty occupation” and it can hire a qualified noncitizen to fill the position.  \n2 \n3  4.  In denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts, Defendant USCIS relies \n4  on the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), a publication of the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n5 \nof the U.S. Department of Labor, as an authoritative source on the educational requirements for \n6 \nthe occupations which it profiles. Defendant USCIS thus relies upon it to determine if a \n7 \nbachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, is normally required for \n8 \nentry into the occupation, thus satisfying the first regulatory test.  \n9 \n5.  The OOH’s profile of the market research analyst occupation demonstrates that \n10 \n11  this occupation satisfies the first regulatory test; that is, it demonstrates that a bachelor’s degree \n12 \nin a specific specialty—market research or a related field—is typically, or normally, required for \n13 \nwork as a market research analyst.  \n14 \n6.  Defendant USCIS has a pattern and practice of misinterpreting the OOH’s profile \n15 \nof a market research analyst, mistakenly finding that it does not demonstrate that this occupation \n16 \nsatisfies the first regulatory test. In so finding, Defendant USCIS also has a pattern and practice \n17 \n18  of misinterpreting the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1), and the first regulatory test, 8 C.F.R. \n19  § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020).  \n20 \n7.  Had Defendant USCIS correctly applied the first regulatory test and found that the \n21 \noccupation was a specialty occupation in Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ cases, it would \n22 \nhave approved their petitions. Plaintiffs seek relief under the APA and the Declaratory Judgment \n23 \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, on behalf of themselves and putative class members to remedy \n24 \nDefendants’ misapplication of the specialty occupation statute and regulations and its \n25 \n26  misinterpretation of the OOH.   \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 4 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 5 of 21\n \n \nJURISDICTION \n1 \n8.  This case arises under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n2 \n§ 701 et seq. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to \n3 \n4  28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction). This Court has authority to grant relief under \n5  the APA and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02. The United States has \n6 \nwaived sovereign immunity under 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n7 \nVENUE \n8 \n9.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because \n9 \nDefendants are a U.S. agency and an officer of a U.S. agency acting in his official capacity, \n10 \nPlaintiff MadKudu Inc. resides in this District, and no real property is involved in this action. \n11 \n12  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n13  10.  This action is properly assigned to the San Jose Division of this Court as Plaintiff \n14 \nMadKudu Inc. resides in Santa Clara County and a substantial part of the events which give rise \n15 \nto this claim occurred in Santa Clara County. \n16 \nFINAL AGENCY ACTION AND  \n17  EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n \n18 \n11.  Defendant USCIS’ denial of Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ H-1B \n19 \npetitions constitutes final agency action under the APA, as does its policy, pattern and/or practice \n20 \nregarding its adjudications of H-1B petitions for market research analysts. See 5 U.S.C. §§ \n21 \n551(13); 701(b)(2); 704. Neither the INA nor implementing regulations require an administrative \n22 \n23  appeal of the denials. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have no further administrative remedies to exhaust.   \n24  PARTIES \n \n25 \n12.  Plaintiff MadKudu Inc. is a marketing analytics software company headquartered \n26 \nin Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California. MadKudu filed an H-1B petition for a \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 5 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 6 of 21\n \n \nposition in the market research analyst occupation on or about April 2, 2019, which Defendant \n1 \nUSCIS denied on February 24, 2020 for, inter alia, failing to demonstrate that the position \n2 \n3  satisfied 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020), the first regulatory test for a specialty \n4  occupation.  \n5 \n13.  Plaintiff Quick Fitting, Inc. is a supplier of plumbing fittings headquartered in \n6 \nWarwick, Rhode Island. Quick Fitting filed an H-1B petition for a market research analyst on or \n7 \nabout August 20, 2019, which Defendant USCIS denied on January 23, 2020 for, inter alia, \n8 \nfailing to demonstrate that the position satisfied 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020), the first \n9 \nregulatory test for a specialty occupation.    \n10 \n11  14.  Defendant USCIS is a component of the Department of Homeland Security,   \n12 \n6 U.S.C. § 271, and an agency within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). USCIS is \n13 \nresponsible for adjudicating immigration benefits, including H-1B petitions. USCIS denied \n14 \nPlaintiffs’ H-1B petitions. \n15 \n15.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is, at the time this Complaint is filed, the Senior \n16 \nOfficial Performing Duties of the Director, as the position of USCIS Director remains vacant. In \n17 \n18  this position, he is responsible for overseeing the adjudication of immigration benefits and \n19  establishing and implementing governing policies. The USCIS Director has ultimate \n20 \nresponsibility for the adjudication of H-1B petitions. Defendant Cuccinelli is sued in his official \n21 \ncapacity. \n22 \nOVERVIEW OF THE LAW AND ADMINISTRATIVE  \n23  DECISIONMAKING PROCESS \n \n24 \n16.  Congress established a nonimmigrant classification to permit noncitizens to \n25 \ntemporarily perform services in the United States in specialty occupations. 8 U.S.C. \n26 \n§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). This nonimmigrant classification is commonly referred to as H-1B.  \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 6 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 7 of 21\n \n \n17.  A U.S. employer must follow a multi-step, two-agency process to obtain an H-1B \n1 \nclassification for a position it seeks to fill with a foreign worker. First, it must file a Labor \n2 \n3  Condition Application with the U.S. Department of Labor in which it attests to standards to \n4  which it will adhere. On this application, the employer must identify the Standard Occupational \n5 \nClassification (SOC) code and occupational title of the position it seeks to fill. The SOC system \n6 \nis a federal statistical standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational \n7 \ncategories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data.  \n8 \n18.  Upon the Department of Labor’s certification of the Labor Condition Application, \n9 \nthe U.S. employer will file it and an H-1B petition with Defendant USCIS. In its H-1B petition, \n10 \n11  the U.S. employer petitioner must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the \n12 \nposition it seeks to fill is in a specialty occupation.  \n13 \n19.  A “specialty occupation” is one that requires the “(A) theoretical and practical \n14 \napplication of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and (B) attainment of a bachelor’s or \n15 \nhigher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the \n16 \noccupation in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1). \n17 \n18  20.  The regulatory definition of “specialty occupation” first repeats the statutory \n19  definition and then provides a non-exhaustive list of fields as examples of specialty occupations:   \n20 \nSpecialty occupation means an occupation which requires theoretical and practical \napplication of a body of highly specialized knowledge in fields of human endeavor \n21 \nincluding, but not limited to, architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, \n22  social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, \ntheology, and the arts, and which requires the attainment of a bachelor's degree or higher \n23  in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the \nUnited States.  \n24 \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(ii) (2020). \n25 \n26 \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj.

A proposed job must satisfy one—but only one—of four independent regulatory \n1 \ntests to qualify as a specialty occupation. Relevant here is the first regulatory test, which is \n2 \n3  satisfied if the petitioning U.S. employer demonstrates that:   \n4  A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum requirement \nfor entry into the particular position. \n5 \n  \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020).1 Defendant USCIS interprets this test as consistent with \n6 \n7  8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1) only if the bachelor’s or higher degree is in a “specific specialty.” \n8  22.  When considering whether the petitioning U.S. employer’s job meets the first \n9 \nregulatory test for a specialty occupation, Defendant USCIS first must identify the occupation \n10 \nwithin which the job falls. To do this, Defendant USCIS routinely considers the SOC code and \n11 \ncorresponding occupational title the employer provided in the Labor Condition Application it \n12 \nsubmitted to the U.S. Department of Labor.  \n13 \n14  23.  After identifying the occupation within which the position falls, Defendant \n15  USCIS consults the OOH with respect to that position. The OOH, updated every two years, \n16 \nprovides profiles of hundreds of occupations that represent most, though not all, jobs in the \n17 \nUnited States. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Information Contained in the OOH \n18 \n(Jan. 16, 2020), https://www.bls.gov/ooh/about/occupational-information-included-in-the-\n19 \n20 \n \n1   The other three tests are: \n21 \n(2) The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar \norganizations or, in the alternative, an employer may show that its particular position is \n22 \nso complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree; \n23  (3) The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position; or \n(4) The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex that knowledge \n24 \nrequired to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a baccalaureate \nor higher degree. \n25 \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (2020). None is relevant here as each presents an alternative means \n26  of demonstrating that a position is a specialty occupation. Consequently, an approval under any \none of them is sufficient even where Defendant USCIS denies a petition under one or more of \n27  the other regulatory tests. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1)-(4).  \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 8 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 9 of 21\n \n \nooh.htm. Among other data, each occupational profile describes the “typical duties performed by \n1 \nthe occupation” and the “typical education and training needed to enter the occupation.” Id. \n2 \n3  Defendant USCIS recognizes the OOH as an authoritative source on the duties and educational \n4  requirements of the occupations profiled within it.   \n5 \n24.  If the occupation the petitioning employer designated in the Labor Condition \n6 \nApplication is in the OOH, Defendant USCIS will compare the H-1B petitioning employer’s job \n7 \nduties and education requirements with the OOH entry. Where Defendant USCIS decides that \n8 \nthe petitioning employer has correctly identified the job as being within the specified occupation, \n9 \nit relies upon the OOH to determine whether to approve the H-1B petition under the first \n10 \n11  regulatory test—that is, whether the OOH establishes that a bachelor’s degree or higher in a \n12 \nspecific specialty or its equivalent is the normal minimum prerequisite for entry into the \n13 \noccupation.   \n14 \n25.  The OOH entry for market research analyst contains the following description of \n15 \nthe educational requirements for entry into the occupation: \n16 \nMarket research analysts typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a \n17 \nrelated field. Many have degrees in fields such as statistics, math, or computer science. \n18  Others have backgrounds in business administration, the social sciences or \ncommunications.  \n19   \nCourses in statistics, research methods, and marketing are essential for these workers. \n20 \nCourses in communications and social sciences, such as economics or consumer behavior, \nare also important. \n21 \n \n22  Some market research analyst jobs require a master’s degree. Several schools offer \ngraduate programs in marketing research, but many analysts complete degrees in other \n23  fields, such as statistics and marketing, and/or earn a master’s degree in business \nadministration (MBA). A master’s degree is often required for leadership positions or \n24 \npositions that perform more technical research. \n25 \n26 \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 9 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 10 of 21\n \n \nOOH, How to Become a Market Research Analyst (Sept. 4, 2019) \n1 \nhttps://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/market-research-analysts.htm#tab-4 (emphasis \n2 \n3  added). \n4  26.  The OOH establishes that a market research analyst satisfies the first regulatory \n5 \ntest for a specialty occupation. First, by establishing that market research analysts “typically \n6 \nneed” a bachelor’s degree, with some jobs requiring a master’s degree, it demonstrates that a \n7 \nbachelor’s degree is “normally” the minimum degree requirement for the occupation. 8 C.F.R. \n8 \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020). Second, the OOH also establishes that entry into the occupation \n9 \n“typically” requires a bachelor’s degree in “market research or a related field,” and identifies the \n10 \n11  coursework that is “essential” for this occupation—statistics, research methods and marketing—, \n12 \nthus demonstrating that a “body of highly specialized knowledge” is necessary to perform the job \n13 \nof a market research analyst. Combined, this information demonstrates that the degree is in a \n14 \nspecific specialty. \n15 \n27.  Defendant USCIS has a pattern and practice of erroneously denying H-1B \n16 \npetitions for market research analysts. In its decisions, which routinely employ the same \n17 \n18  reasoning and general language, Defendant USCIS ignores the OOH’s statement: “Market \n19  research analysts typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a related field.” \n20 \nInstead, Defendant USCIS finds that the OOH indicates that several degrees or fields of study \n21 \nmay qualify a person to perform the duties of a market research analyst, and then erroneously \n22 \nconcludes that this indicates that the degree requirement is not in a specific specialty. In so \n23 \ndeciding, Defendant USCIS erroneously ignores the regulatory term “normally.” \n24 \n28.  Defendant USCIS’ adjudicators rely on—and on information and belief, are \n25 \n26  bound by—training materials, templates, and other guidance from Defendant USCIS when \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 10 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 11 of 21\n \n \nmaking H-1B specialty occupation decisions, including decisions regarding petitions for market \n1 \nresearch analysts. Upon information and belief, Defendant USCIS generally, and erroneously, \n2 \n3  fails to include these documents in the administrative record of the case that is being decided. \n4  See Thompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555 (9th Cir. 1989) (explaining that the \n5 \nadministrative record “consists of all documents and materials directly or indirectly considered \n6 \nby agency decision-makers and includes evidence contrary to the agency’s positions”) (emphasis \n7 \nin original) (quotation omitted).  The training and guidance which Defendant USCIS provides its \n8 \nadjudicators reflects Defendant USCIS’ policy with respect to the adjudication of market \n9 \nresearch analyst H-1B petitions. \n10 \n11  29.  In its decisions, Defendant USCIS misinterprets the plain meaning of the term \n12 \n“specific specialty.” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1). That multiple degrees will prepare a person to be a \n13 \nmarket research analyst does not negate the fact that the typical degrees for this occupation are \n14 \nall closely related to market research and, thus, constitute a specific specialty. See, e.g., Raj & \n15 \nCo. v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 85 F. Supp. 3d 1241, 1247 (W.D. Wash. 2015) \n16 \n(rejecting USCIS’ interpretation of the OOH entry for market research analysts and holding that \n17 \n18  it “impermissibly narrows the plain language of the statute”). Defendant USCIS also ignores the \n19  statutory language that the equivalent of a bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty can \n20 \nsatisfy the statutory definition of a specialty occupation. See 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1). \n21 \n30.  The denials in Plaintiffs’ cases are representative of a pattern and practice of \n22 \nsimilar USCIS decisions. Plaintiffs know of at least 66 H-1B market research analyst petitions \n23 \nthat Defendant USCIS denied in the past three calendar years, employing the same reasoning and \n24 \nsimilar language in all. On information and belief, these 66 decisions represent only a fraction of \n25 \n26  Defendant USCIS’ decisions denying market research analyst H-1B petitions on this basis during \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj.

Including their own cases, \n1 \nPlaintiffs are aware of 6 decisions issued in the first two months of 2020, in which Defendant \n2 \n3  USCIS denied H-1B petitions for market research analyst positions on this same basis. On \n4  information and belief, these 6 decisions are only a fraction of the total number of market \n5 \nresearch analyst H-1B petitions that have been denied by Defendant USCIS on this basis to date \n6 \nin 2020.  \n7 \nPLAINTIFFS’ FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n8 \n31.  Plaintiff MadKudu Inc. is a marketing analytics software company headquartered \n9 \nin Mountain View, California. Established in 2014, its clients are business-to-business software \n10 \n11  as a service (SaaS) companies who want an alternative to the incomplete, yet time-intensive \n12 \nmanual development of sales leads. MadKudu analyzes a client’s customers and segments sales \n13 \nleads based on relevant demographic data, such as the lead’s title, industry and business size. Its \n14 \ndata analysis determines which customers are ready to buy from the client. MadKudu’s \n15 \npredictive models adapt automatically based on data, accounting for changes in its clients’ \n16 \nproducts and markets for new customers. \n17 \n18  32.  On or about April 2, 2019, MadKudu filed a petition with Defendant USCIS \n19  seeking to employ Rafikah Binte Mohamed Halim in H-1B status in a market research analyst \n20 \njob with the title of product manager. Ms. Mohamed Halim, a national of Singapore, had worked \n21 \nfor MadKudu in H-1B12 status since June 2018 as product manager. Ms. Mohamed Halim holds \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \n25 \n2   Congress established the H-1B1 classification for nationals of Chile and Singapore under \n26  Fair Trade Agreements with Chile and Singapore. See 8 U.S.C. § 1184(g)(8)(A)(i)-(ii),  \n(g)(8)(B)(ii)(I)-(II). The job must be in a “specialty occupation” and the definition is identical to \n27  the definition for the H-1B classification. 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(3). \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj.

MadKudu attached to its H-1B petition a Labor Condition Application certified \n4  by the Department of Labor, which identified the position by SOC Code 13-1161, an occupation \n5 \nentitled Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists. \n6 \n34.  Defendant USCIS denied the petition on February 24, 2020 for failing to \n7 \ndemonstrate that the position was a specialty occupation under any of the independent regulatory \n8 \ntests. \n9 \n35.  Following its pattern and practice, Defendant USCIS determined that Plaintiff \n10 \n11  MadKudu’s petition did not meet the first regulatory test because the OOH did not show that \n12 \nmarket research analyst positions normally require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree or its \n13 \nequivalent in a specialty occupation at the entry level. Defendant USCIS stated that “a range of \n14 \neducational credentials may qualify an individual to perform the duties of a Market Research \n15 \nAnalysts [sic].”  \n16 \n36.  In concluding that Plaintiff MadKudu did not meet the first regulatory test, \n17 \n18  Defendant USCIS ignored entirely the OOH’s statements that “[m]arket research analysts \n19  typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a related field” and that “[c]ourses in \n20 \nstatistics, research methods, and marketing are essential for these workers.”   \n21 \n37.  Established in 2004, Plaintiff Quick Fitting, Inc. is a corporation headquartered in \n22 \nWarwick, Rhode Island. It is the leading supplier of quick connection technologies that can be \n23 \nused in plumbing, electrical, heating, air-conditioning, fire suppression and oil and gas \n24 \napplications. It holds over fifty-five patents and has another sixty that are pending. Currently, it \n25 \n26  is launching eight new product lines.  \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj.

On or about August 20, 2019, Quick Fitting, Inc. filed a petition with Defendant \n1 \nUSCIS seeking an extension of Xiaomeng Liu’s H-1B status based on her employment as a \n2 \n3  market research analyst. It sought to continue to employ Ms. Liu in this position for an additional \n4  period with no change in job duties from the H-1B petition previously approved by Defendant \n5 \nUSCIS. Ms. Liu, who had been working with Quick Fitting, Inc. in H-1B status since December \n6 \n2012, holds a master’s degree in Business Administration with a marketing concentration from \n7 \nJohnson and Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island.  \n8 \n39.  Quick Fitting, Inc. attached to its H-1B petition a Labor Condition Application \n9 \ncertified by the Department of Labor, which identified the position by SOC Code 13-1161, an \n10 \n11  occupation entitled Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists.  \n12 \n40.  Defendant USCIS denied the petition on January 23, 2020 for failing to \n13 \ndemonstrate that the position was a specialty occupation under any of the independent regulatory \n14 \ntests.   \n15 \n41.  Following its pattern and practice, Defendant USCIS determined that Plaintiff \n16 \nQuick Fitting, Inc.’s petition did not meet the first regulatory test because the OOH did not show \n17 \n18  that market research analyst positions normally require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree or its \n19  equivalent in a specialty occupation at the entry level. Defendant USCIS noted that “[a] range of \n20 \neducational qualifications such as business administration and the social sciences may qualify an \n21 \nindividual to perform the duties of a Market Research Analyst and Marketing Specialist.” \n22 \nDefendant USCIS concluded that the “requirement of a degree with a generalized title, such as \n23 \nbusiness administration or liberal arts, without further specification, does not establish \n24 \neligibility.”  \n25 \n26 \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj.

In concluding that Plaintiff Quick Fitting, Inc. did not meet the first regulatory \n1 \ntest, Defendant USCIS ignored entirely the OOH’s statements that “[m]arket research analysts \n2 \n3  typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a related field” and that “[c]ourses in \n4  statistics, research methods, and marketing are essential for these workers.”   \n5 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n6 \n43.  Named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others who are \n7 \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2). A class action \n8 \nis proper because this action involves questions of law and fact common to the class, the class is \n9 \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impractical, Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \n10 \n11  claims of the class, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, and \n12 \nDefendants have acted on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief \n13 \nor corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n14 \n44.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class: \n15 \nAll U.S. employers who in 2019 filed, or in the future will file, a petition (Form \n16 \nI-129 or any successor) with USCIS for an H-1B classification under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) for a market research analyst where: \n17 \n•  USCIS denied or will deny the petition solely or in part based on a \n18  finding that the OOH entry for market research analyst does not establish \nthat the occupation is a specialty occupation, and thus does not satisfy \n19  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and \n•  But for this finding, the petition would be approved. \n20 \n45.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n21 \n22  Plaintiffs are not aware of the precise number of potential class members but reasonably estimate \n23 \nthat the number of class members totals at least 40; Defendants, however, are in a position to \n24 \nidentify this number. Upon information and belief, there are many more than two dozen current \n25 \nmembers of the class and an unknown number—likely in the hundreds—of future members.  \n26 \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 15 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 16 of 21\n \n \n46.  Defendant USCIS denied an average of 22 H-1B petitions for market research \n1 \nanalysts in each of the last three full calendar years (between 18 and 25 each year) and is on \n2 \n3  track to deny at least that many in 2020—having denied at least 6 such petitions, including \n4  Plaintiffs’, in the first two months of the year. All such denials found that the OOH did not \n5 \nestablish that a market research analyst was a specialty occupation under the first regulatory test. \n6 \nAll such denials contained the same or similar language as that found in Plaintiffs’ denials, along \n7 \nwith the same reasoning.  \n8 \n47.  On information and belief, these decisions represent only a fraction of the H-1B \n9 \npetitions for market research analysts denied on this basis each year. These decisions were issued \n10 \n11  by Defendant USCIS’ Administrative Appeals Office (USCIS AAO) and posted on Westlaw. \n12 \nThey are the only USCIS decisions that are publicly available. Only a small fraction of H-1B \n13 \npetitioners whose petitions are denied appeal the denial to USCIS’ AAO. Consequently, it is \n14 \nreasonable to infer that these decisions represent only a fraction of the H-1B petitions for market \n15 \nresearch analysts that were denied during the years in question. These numbers, thus, support a \n16 \nreasonable estimate that there are at least several dozen current putative class members, and \n17 \n18  likely many more. This reasonable estimate of current class members coupled with the existence \n19  of unknown future class members makes joinder impracticable.  \n20 \n48.  Questions of law and fact common to the proposed class predominate over any \n21 \nquestions affecting only the individually named Plaintiffs. These include, but are not limited to, \n22 \nwhether Defendant USCIS misinterprets the OOH entry for market research analyst; whether \n23 \nDefendant USCIS misinterprets 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) \n24 \n(2020); whether Defendant USCIS has a pattern and practice of denying the H-1B petitions of \n25 \n26  Plaintiffs and putative class members on the basis alleged in this suit; and whether its denial of \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 16 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 17 of 21\n \n \nPlaintiffs’ and putative class members’ H-1B petitions violates the APA in that it is arbitrary and \n1 \ncapricious, and contrary to the INA and its implementing regulations. Resolution of these \n2 \n3  common questions will resolve the entire case. \n4  49.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class insofar as they \n5 \nhave been subject to Defendant USCIS’ pattern and practice of denying H-1B petitions for \n6 \nmarket analyst positions under the first regulatory test based upon a misinterpretation of the \n7 \nstatute, regulations and the OOH.  \n8 \n50.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class \n9 \nmembers because they seek relief on behalf of the class as a whole and have no interest \n10 \n11  antagonistic to other class members. \n12 \n51.  Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with extensive experience in \n13 \ncomplex class actions and extensive knowledge of immigration law. \n14 \n52.  In denying the H-1B petitions of Plaintiffs and putative class members, \n15 \nDefendants have acted and will continue to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire \n16 \nclass, thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole. \n17 \n18  The class may therefore be properly certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n19  DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ALLEGATIONS \n20 \n53.  An actual and substantial controversy exists between the Plaintiffs and proposed \n21 \nclass members and the Defendants as to their respective rights and obligations. Plaintiffs contend \n22 \nthat Defendants’ actions violate Plaintiffs’ rights and the rights of the proposed class members. \n23 \n54.  Defendants’ pattern and practice of misinterpreting the OOH and misapplying the \n24 \nlaw forecloses Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent from demonstrating that their jobs \n25 \n26  are in a specialty occupation based on the first regulatory test. Where the OOH demonstrates that \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj. Relief     \n \nPage 17 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653   Document 1   Filed 04/16/20   Page 18 of 21\n \n \na bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty is normally the minimum requirement for \n1 \nentry in the occupation that includes the job the H-1B petition seeks to fill, no further evidence is \n2 \n3  needed. This is the case with respect to the OOH entry for market research analyst. \n4  55.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members have suffered a legal wrong and have been \n5 \nadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \n6 \nDefendants’ policy and practice of denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts under the \n7 \nfirst regulatory test constitutes final agency action. There are no administrative remedies that \n8 \nPlaintiffs must exhaust.  \n9 \n56.  Based on the foregoing, the Court should grant declaratory and injunctive relief \n10 \n11  under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. \n12 \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT ONE \n13 \n(Violation of the APA) \n14 \n57.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, the \n15 \nallegations in paragraphs 1-56 above. \n16 \n58.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members seek to hire noncitizens to work in the \n17 \nspecialty occupation of market research analyst. Plaintiffs and proposed class members have a \n18 \nright to have their H-1B petitions adjudicated by Defendants in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \n19 \n20  § 1184(i)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020).  \n21 \n59.  Defendants have a pattern and practice of denying these petitions in violation of \n22 \nthese statutory and regulatory provisions.  Defendants’ pattern and practice of denying these \n23 \npetitions reflects a policy, whether written or unwritten, that is contrary to law.  \n24 \n60.  Although recognizing the OOH as authoritative for purposes of determining \n25 \nwhether an occupation profiled within it satisfies the first regulatory test for a specialty \n26 \n27  occupation, Defendant USCIS routinely misreads the OOH’s profile for market research analyst. \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj.

But for \n4  Defendant’s violation of the law, Defendant USCIS would find that Plaintiffs and putative class \n5 \nmembers satisfy the first regulatory test for demonstrating that their jobs are in a specialty \n6 \noccupation. \n7 \n61.

See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n12 \nCOUNT TWO \n13  (Violation of the INA and its Implementing Regulations) \n14  62.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference, as if fully set forth herein, the \n15 \nallegations in paragraphs 1-56 above. \n16 \n63.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members seek to hire noncitizens to work in the \n17 \nspecialty occupation of market research analyst. Plaintiffs and proposed class members have a \n18 \nright to have their H-1B petitions adjudicated by Defendants in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \n19 \n§ 1184(i)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020). Defendants have a pattern and practice \n20 \n21  of denying these petitions in violation of these statutory and regulatory provisions.    \n22  64.  Although recognizing the OOH as authoritative for purposes of determining \n23 \nwhether an occupation profiled within it satisfies the first regulatory test for a specialty \n24 \noccupation, Defendant USCIS routinely misreads the OOH’s profile for market research analyst. \n25 \nSimultaneously, Defendant USCIS misinterprets the meaning of the statutory term “specific \n26 \nspecialty,” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1), ignores the regulatory term “normally,” 8 C.F.R. \n27 \nComplaint for Decl. and Inj.

Employing boilerplate language and uniform faulty reasoning, Defendant U.S. \n2 \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) routinely and unlawfully denies nonimmigrant \n3 \nemployment-based petitions filed by U.S. employers under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), \n4 \n5  1184(c)(1) and 1184(i), also known as H-1B petitions, to classify market research analyst \n6 \npositions as a “specialty occupation.” Defendant USCIS’ denials violate the Immigration and \n7 \nNationality Act (INA) and implementing regulations, and the Administrative Procedure Act \n8 \n(APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701, et seq. Plaintiffs MadKudu Inc., Quick Fitting, Inc., 2nd Street USA, \n9 \nInc., and Hanguang International Inc., four U.S. corporations, challenge Defendant USCIS’ \n10 \ndenial of H-1B petitions they filed on behalf of noncitizens they sought to hire in the market \n11 \n12  research analyst occupation, as well as Defendant USCIS’ pattern and practice of arbitrarily and \n13  unlawfully denying petitions for market research analysts filed by similarly situated H-1B \n14 \npetitioners.   \n15 \n2.  The H-1B nonimmigrant visa classification allows highly educated noncitizens to \n16 \nwork for U.S. employers in specialty occupations. A specialty occupation is one which requires \n17 \nthe theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge for which a \n18 \nbachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty (or its equivalent) is required. See 8 U.S.C. \n19 \n20  § 1184(i)(1). \n21  3.  By regulation, a U.S. employer petitioner can establish that a position is within a \n22 \nspecialty occupation through any one of several tests set forth in the governing regulation. \n23 \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (2020). Relevant here is the first test, which authorizes a position \n24 \nto qualify as a specialty occupation if “[a] baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is \n25 \nnormally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position.” 8 C.F.R. \n26 \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020) (hereinafter, the first regulatory test). Where Defendant USCIS \n27 \nPls. Am. Compl. for Decl. and Inj. Relief                                   Case No. 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   \n \nPage 3 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 39   Filed 07/20/20   Page 4 of 26\n \n \ndetermines that a U.S. employer petitioner satisfies this test, it has demonstrated that the \n1 \noccupation is a “specialty occupation” and it can hire a qualified noncitizen to fill the position.  \n2 \n3  4.  In denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts, Defendant USCIS relies \n4  on the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), a publication of the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n5 \nof the U.S. Department of Labor, as an authoritative source on the educational requirements for \n6 \nthe occupations which it profiles. Defendant USCIS thus relies upon it to determine if a \n7 \nbachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, is normally required for \n8 \nentry into the occupation, thus satisfying the first regulatory test.  \n9 \n5.  The OOH’s profile of the market research analyst occupation demonstrates that \n10 \n11  this occupation satisfies the first regulatory test; that is, it demonstrates that a bachelor’s degree \n12 \nin a specific specialty—market research or a related field—is typically, or normally, required for \n13 \nwork as a market research analyst.  \n14 \n6.  Defendant USCIS has a pattern and practice of misinterpreting the OOH’s profile \n15 \nof a market research analyst, mistakenly finding that it does not demonstrate that this occupation \n16 \nsatisfies the first regulatory test. In so finding, Defendant USCIS also has a pattern and practice \n17 \n18  of misinterpreting the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1), and the first regulatory test, 8 C.F.R. \n19  § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020).  \n20 \n7.  Had Defendant USCIS correctly applied the first regulatory test and found that the \n21 \noccupation was a specialty occupation in Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ cases, it would \n22 \nhave approved their petitions. Plaintiffs seek relief under the APA and the Declaratory Judgment \n23 \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, on behalf of themselves and putative class members to remedy \n24 \nDefendants’ misapplication of the specialty occupation statute and regulations and its \n25 \n26  misinterpretation of the OOH.   \n27 \nPls. Am. Compl. for Decl. and Inj. Relief                                   Case No. 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   \n \nPage 4 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 39   Filed 07/20/20   Page 5 of 26\n \n \nJURISDICTION \n1 \n8.  This case arises under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., and the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n2 \n§ 701 et seq. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to \n3 \n4  28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction). This Court has authority to grant relief under \n5  the APA and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02. The United States has \n6 \nwaived sovereign immunity under 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n7 \nVENUE \n8 \n9.  Venue in this judicial district is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because \n9 \nDefendants are a U.S. agency and an officer of a U.S. agency acting in his official capacity, \n10 \nPlaintiff MadKudu Inc. resides in this District, and no real property is involved in this action. \n11 \n12  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n13  10.  This action is properly assigned to the San Jose Division of this Court as Plaintiff \n14 \nMadKudu Inc. resides in Santa Clara County and a substantial part of the events which give rise \n15 \nto this claim occurred in Santa Clara County. \n16 \nFINAL AGENCY ACTION AND  \n17  EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n \n18 \n11.  Defendant USCIS’ denial of Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ H-1B \n19 \npetitions constitutes final agency action under the APA, as does its policy, pattern and/or practice \n20 \nregarding its adjudications of H-1B petitions for market research analysts. See 5 U.S.C. §§ \n21 \n551(13); 701(b)(2); 704. Neither the INA nor implementing regulations require an administrative \n22 \n23  appeal of the denials. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have no further administrative remedies to exhaust.   \n24  PARTIES \n \n25 \n12.  Plaintiff MadKudu Inc. is a marketing analytics software company headquartered \n26 \nin Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California. MadKudu filed an H-1B petition for a \n27 \nPls. Am.

Plaintiff Quick Fitting, Inc. is a supplier of plumbing fittings headquartered in \n6 \nWarwick, Rhode Island. Quick Fitting filed an H-1B petition for a market research analyst on or \n7 \nabout August 20, 2019, which Defendant USCIS denied on January 23, 2020 for, inter alia, \n8 \nfailing to demonstrate that the position satisfied 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020), the first \n9 \nregulatory test for a specialty occupation. \n10 \n11  14.  Plaintiff 2nd Street USA, Inc. operates and manages six second-hand clothing \n12 \nretail stores, one in New York and the others in Southern California, with headquarters in Los \n13 \nAngeles, California. 2nd Street USA filed an H-1B petition for a position in the market research \n14 \nanalyst occupation on or about April 11, 2019, which Defendant USCIS denied on September \n15 \n12, 2019 for, inter alia, failing to demonstrate that the position satisfied 8 C.F.R. \n16 \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020), the first regulatory test for a specialty occupation. \n17 \n18  15.

It provides services to Chinese students \n20 \nalready studying in the United States and those who are considering this option. It also provides \n21 \nservices to an affiliated company in China. Hanguang International filed an H-1B petition for a \n22 \nposition in the market research analyst occupation on or about April 2, 2019, which Defendant \n23 \nUSCIS denied on November 1, 2019 for, inter alia, failing to demonstrate that the position \n24 \nsatisfied 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020), the first regulatory test for a specialty \n25 \n26  occupation. \n27 \nPls.

Defendant USCIS is a component of the Department of Homeland Security,   \n1 \n6 U.S.C. § 271, and an agency within the meaning of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1). USCIS is \n2 \n3  responsible for adjudicating immigration benefits, including H-1B petitions. USCIS denied \n4  Plaintiffs’ H-1B petitions. \n5 \n17.  Defendant Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is, at the time this Complaint is filed, the Senior \n6 \nOfficial Performing Duties of the Director, as the position of USCIS Director remains vacant. In \n7 \nthis position, he is responsible for overseeing the adjudication of immigration benefits and \n8 \nestablishing and implementing governing policies. The USCIS Director has ultimate \n9 \nresponsibility for the adjudication of H-1B petitions. Defendant Cuccinelli is sued in his official \n10 \n11  capacity. \n12 \nOVERVIEW OF THE LAW AND ADMINISTRATIVE  \nDECISIONMAKING PROCESS \n13 \n \n18.  Congress established a nonimmigrant classification to permit noncitizens to \n14 \n15  temporarily perform services in the United States in specialty occupations. 8 U.S.C. \n16 \n§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). This nonimmigrant classification is commonly referred to as H-1B.  \n17 \n19.  A U.S. employer must follow a multi-step, two-agency process to obtain an H-1B \n18 \nclassification for a position it seeks to fill with a foreign worker. First, it must file a Labor \n19 \nCondition Application with the U.S. Department of Labor in which it attests to standards to \n20 \nwhich it will adhere. On this application, the employer must identify the Standard Occupational \n21 \n22  Classification (SOC) code and occupational title of the position it seeks to fill. The SOC system \n23  is a federal statistical standard used by federal agencies to classify workers into occupational \n24 \ncategories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, or disseminating data.  \n25 \n20.  Upon the Department of Labor’s certification of the Labor Condition Application, \n26 \nthe U.S. employer will file it and an H-1B petition with Defendant USCIS. In its H-1B petition, \n27 \nPls. Am.

A “specialty occupation” is one that requires the “(A) theoretical and practical \n4  application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and (B) attainment of a bachelor’s or \n5 \nhigher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the \n6 \noccupation in the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1). \n7 \n22.  The regulatory definition of “specialty occupation” first repeats the statutory \n8 \ndefinition and then provides a non-exhaustive list of fields as examples of specialty occupations:   \n9 \nSpecialty occupation means an occupation which requires theoretical and practical \n10 \napplication of a body of highly specialized knowledge in fields of human endeavor \n11  including, but not limited to, architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, \nsocial sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, \n12 \ntheology, and the arts, and which requires the attainment of a bachelor's degree or higher \nin a specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the \n13 \nUnited States.  \n14 \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(ii) (2020). \n15 \n23.  A proposed job must satisfy one—but only one—of four independent regulatory \n16 \ntests to qualify as a specialty occupation. Relevant here is the first regulatory test, which is \n17 \nsatisfied if the petitioning U.S. employer demonstrates that:   \n18 \nA baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum requirement \n19 \nfor entry into the particular position. \n  \n20 \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020).1 Defendant USCIS interprets this test as consistent with \n21 \n8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1) only if the bachelor’s or higher degree is in a “specific specialty.” \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \n1   The other three tests are: \n25 \n(2) The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar \n26  organizations or, in the alternative, an employer may show that its particular position is \nso complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree; \n27  (3) The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position; or \nPls.

When considering whether the petitioning U.S. employer’s job meets the first \n1 \nregulatory test for a specialty occupation, Defendant USCIS first must identify the occupation \n2 \n3  within which the job falls. To do this, Defendant USCIS routinely considers the SOC code and \n4  corresponding occupational title the employer provided in the Labor Condition Application it \n5 \nsubmitted to the U.S. Department of Labor.  \n6 \n25.  After identifying the occupation within which the position falls, Defendant \n7 \nUSCIS consults the OOH with respect to that position. The OOH, updated every two years, \n8 \nprovides profiles of hundreds of occupations that represent most, though not all, jobs in the \n9 \nUnited States. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Information Contained in the OOH \n10 \n11  (Jan. 16, 2020), https://www.bls.gov/ooh/about/occupational-information-included-in-the-\n12 \nooh.htm. Among other data, each occupational profile describes the “typical duties performed by \n13 \nthe occupation” and the “typical education and training needed to enter the occupation.” Id. \n14 \nDefendant USCIS recognizes the OOH as an authoritative source on the duties and educational \n15 \nrequirements of the occupations profiled within it.   \n16 \n26.  If the occupation the petitioning employer designated in the Labor Condition \n17 \n18  Application is in the OOH, Defendant USCIS will compare the H-1B petitioning employer’s job \n19  duties and education requirements with the OOH entry. Where Defendant USCIS decides that \n20 \nthe petitioning employer has correctly identified the job as being within the specified occupation, \n21 \nit relies upon the OOH to determine whether to approve the H-1B petition under the first \n22 \n23   \n(4) The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex that knowledge \n24 \nrequired to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a baccalaureate \nor higher degree. \n25 \n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (2020). None is relevant here as each presents an alternative means \n26  of demonstrating that a position is a specialty occupation. Consequently, an approval under any \none of them is sufficient even where Defendant USCIS denies a petition under one or more of \n27  the other regulatory tests. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1)-(4).  \nPls. Am. Compl. for Decl. and Inj.

The OOH entry for market research analyst contains the following description of \n5 \nthe educational requirements for entry into the occupation: \n6 \nMarket research analysts typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a \n7  related field. Many have degrees in fields such as statistics, math, or computer science. \nOthers have backgrounds in business administration, the social sciences or \n8  communications.  \n \n9 \nCourses in statistics, research methods, and marketing are essential for these workers. \nCourses in communications and social sciences, such as economics or consumer behavior, \n10 \nare also important. \n11   \nSome market research analyst jobs require a master’s degree. Several schools offer \n12 \ngraduate programs in marketing research, but many analysts complete degrees in other \nfields, such as statistics and marketing, and/or earn a master’s degree in business \n13 \nadministration (MBA). A master’s degree is often required for leadership positions or \npositions that perform more technical research. \n14 \nOOH, How to Become a Market Research Analyst (Sept. 4, 2019) \n15 \n16  https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/market-research-analysts.htm#tab-4 (emphasis \n17  added). \n18 \n28.  The OOH establishes that a market research analyst satisfies the first regulatory \n19 \ntest for a specialty occupation. First, by establishing that market research analysts “typically \n20 \nneed” a bachelor’s degree, with some jobs requiring a master’s degree, it demonstrates that a \n21 \nbachelor’s degree is “normally” the minimum degree requirement for the occupation. 8 C.F.R. \n22 \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020). Second, the OOH also establishes that entry into the occupation \n23 \n24  “typically” requires a bachelor’s degree in “market research or a related field,” and identifies the \n25 \ncoursework that is “essential” for this occupation—statistics, research methods and marketing—, \n26 \nthus demonstrating that a “body of highly specialized knowledge” is necessary to perform the job \n27 \nPls.

Combined, this information demonstrates that the degree is in a \n1 \nspecific specialty. \n2 \n3  29.  Defendant USCIS has a pattern and practice of erroneously denying H-1B \n4  petitions for market research analysts. In its decisions, which routinely employ the same \n5 \nreasoning and general language, Defendant USCIS ignores the OOH’s statement: “Market \n6 \nresearch analysts typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a related field.” \n7 \nInstead, Defendant USCIS finds that the OOH indicates that several degrees or fields of study \n8 \nmay qualify a person to perform the duties of a market research analyst, and then erroneously \n9 \nconcludes that this indicates that the degree requirement is not in a specific specialty. In so \n10 \n11  deciding, Defendant USCIS erroneously ignores the regulatory term “normally.” \n12 \n30.  Defendant USCIS’ adjudicators rely on—and on information and belief, are \n13 \nbound by—training materials, templates, and other guidance from Defendant USCIS when \n14 \nmaking H-1B specialty occupation decisions, including decisions regarding petitions for market \n15 \nresearch analysts. Upon information and belief, Defendant USCIS generally, and erroneously, \n16 \nfails to include these documents in the administrative record of the case that is being decided. \n17 \n18  See Thompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 885 F.2d 551, 555 (9th Cir. 1989) (explaining that the \n19  administrative record “consists of all documents and materials directly or indirectly considered \n20 \nby agency decision-makers and includes evidence contrary to the agency’s positions”) (emphasis \n21 \nin original) (quotation omitted).  The training and guidance which Defendant USCIS provides its \n22 \nadjudicators reflects Defendant USCIS’ policy with respect to the adjudication of market \n23 \nresearch analyst H-1B petitions. \n24 \n31.  In its decisions, Defendant USCIS misinterprets the plain meaning of the term \n25 \n26  “specific specialty.” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1). That multiple degrees will prepare a person to be a \n27 \nPls.

See, e.g., Raj & \n2 \n3  Co. v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 85 F. Supp. 3d 1241, 1247 (W.D. Wash. 2015) \n4  (rejecting USCIS’ interpretation of the OOH entry for market research analysts and holding that \n5 \nit “impermissibly narrows the plain language of the statute”). Defendant USCIS also ignores the \n6 \nstatutory language that the equivalent of a bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty can \n7 \nsatisfy the statutory definition of a specialty occupation. See 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1). \n8 \n32.  The denials in Plaintiffs’ cases are representative of a pattern and practice of \n9 \nsimilar USCIS decisions. Plaintiffs know of at least 60 H-1B market research analyst petitions \n10 \n11  that Defendant USCIS denied in the past three calendar years, employing the same reasoning and \n12 \nsimilar language in all. On information and belief, these 60 decisions represent only a fraction of \n13 \nDefendant USCIS’ decisions denying market research analyst H-1B petitions on this basis during \n14 \nthis period. Moreover, this pattern and practice is continuing. Plaintiffs are aware of 6 decisions \n15 \nissued in the first three months of 2020, in addition to the denials in Plaintiffs MadKudu Inc’s \n16 \nand Quick Fitting, Inc.’s cases, in which Defendant USCIS denied H-1B petitions for market \n17 \n18  research analyst positions on this same basis. On information and belief, these 6 decisions are \n19  only a fraction of the total number of market research analyst H-1B petitions that have been \n20 \ndenied by Defendant USCIS on this basis to date in 2020.  \n21 \nPLAINTIFFS’ FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n22 \n33.

On or about April 2, 2019, MadKudu filed a petition with Defendant USCIS \n6 \nseeking to employ Rafikah Binte Mohamed Halim in H-1B status in a market research analyst \n7 \njob with the title of product manager. Ms. Mohamed Halim, a national of Singapore, had worked \n8 \nfor MadKudu in H-1B12 status since June 2018 as product manager. Ms. Mohamed Halim holds \n9 \na bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with specializations in marketing and analytics \n10 \n11  from the National University of Singapore. \n12 \n35.  MadKudu attached to its H-1B petition a Labor Condition Application certified \n13 \nby the Department of Labor, which identified the position by SOC Code 13-1161, an occupation \n14 \nentitled Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists. \n15 \n36.

In concluding that Plaintiff Hanguang International Inc. did not meet the first \n1 \nregulatory test, Defendant USCIS ignored entirely the OOH’s statements that “[m]arket research \n2 \n3  analysts typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a related field” and that \n4  “[c]ourses in statistics, research methods, and marketing are essential for these workers.”          \n5 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n6 \n59.  Named Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others who are \n7 \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2). A class action \n8 \nis proper because this action involves questions of law and fact common to the class, the class is \n9 \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impractical, Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the \n10 \n11  claims of the class, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, and \n12 \nDefendants have acted on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief \n13 \nor corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \n14 \n60.  Although the H-1B petitions of Plaintiffs MadKudu Inc. and Quick Fitting, Inc. \n15 \nhave been approved, their claim that they are entitled to represent the class remains unresolved \n16 \nand they retain an interest in representing the class. Additionally, due to Defendants’ attempt to \n17 \n18  moot the entire case, the claims of these Plaintiffs relate back to the filing of the original \n19  complaint for purposes of class certification. See, e.g., Pitts v. Terrible Herbst, Inc., 653 F.3d \n20 \n1081, 1091-92 (9th Cir. 2011). Consequently, they remain adequate class representatives. \n21 \nMoreover, Defendants have provided no assurance that these Plaintiffs will receive approval \n22 \nfrom USCIS for petitions they file for H-1B classification for market research analyst in the \n23 \nfuture or for extensions for the market research analysts for whom they just received petition \n24 \napproval. \n25 \n26  61.  The named Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class: \n27 \nPls. Am. Compl. for Decl. and Inj. Relief                                   Case No. 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   \n \nPage 19 \n  \n \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 39   Filed 07/20/20   Page 20 of 26\n \n \nAll U.S. employers who in 2019 filed, or in the future will file, a petition (Form \n1 \nI-129 or any successor) with USCIS for an H-1B classification under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) for a market research analyst where: \n2 \n•  USCIS denied or will deny the petition solely or in part based on a \n3  finding that the OOH entry for market research analyst does not establish \nthat the occupation is a specialty occupation, and thus does not satisfy \n4  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and \n•  But for this finding, the petition would be approved. \n5 \n6  62.  The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n7  Plaintiffs are not aware of the precise number of potential class members but reasonably estimate \n8 \nthat the number of class members totals at least 40; Defendants, however, are in a position to \n9 \nidentify this number. Upon information and belief, there are many more than two dozen current \n10 \nmembers of the class and an unknown number—likely in the hundreds—of future members.  \n11 \n63.  Defendant USCIS denied an average of 20 H-1B petitions for market research \n12 \nanalysts in each of the last three full calendar years (between 17 and 22 each year) and is on \n13 \n14  track to deny at least that many in 2020—having denied at least 6 such petitions, in addition to \n15  Plaintiffs MadKudu Inc. and Quick Fitting, Inc.’s petitions, in the first three months of the year. \n16 \nAll such denials found that the OOH did not establish that a market research analyst was a \n17 \nspecialty occupation under the first regulatory test. All such denials contained the same or \n18 \nsimilar language as that found in Plaintiffs’ denials, along with the same reasoning.  \n19 \n64.  On information and belief, these decisions represent only a fraction of the H-1B \n20 \npetitions for market research analysts denied on this basis each year. Other than the decisions in \n21 \n22  Plaintiffs’ cases, these decisions were issued by Defendant USCIS’ Administrative Appeals \n23 \nOffice (USCIS AAO) and posted on electronic legal research sites. They are the only USCIS \n24 \ndecisions that are publicly available. Only a small fraction of H-1B petitioners whose petitions \n25 \nare denied appeal the denial to USCIS’ AAO. Consequently, it is reasonable to infer that these \n26 \ndecisions represent only a fraction of the H-1B petitions for market research analysts that were \n27 \nPls. Am. Compl. for Decl. and Inj.

These numbers, thus, support a reasonable estimate that \n1 \nthere are at least several dozen current putative class members, and likely many more. This \n2 \n3  reasonable estimate of current class members coupled with the existence of unknown future class \n4  members makes joinder impracticable.  \n5 \n65.  Questions of law and fact common to the proposed class predominate over any \n6 \nquestions affecting only the individually named Plaintiffs. These include, but are not limited to, \n7 \nwhether Defendant USCIS misinterprets the OOH entry for market research analyst; whether \n8 \nDefendant USCIS misinterprets 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) \n9 \n(2020); whether Defendant USCIS has a pattern and practice of denying the H-1B petitions of \n10 \n11  Plaintiffs and putative class members on the basis alleged in this suit; and whether its denial of \n12 \nPlaintiffs’ and putative class members’ H-1B petitions violates the APA in that it is arbitrary and \n13 \ncapricious, and contrary to the INA and its implementing regulations. Resolution of these \n14 \ncommon questions will resolve the entire case. \n15 \n66.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the proposed class insofar as they \n16 \nhave been subject to Defendant USCIS’ pattern and practice of denying H-1B petitions for \n17 \n18  market analyst positions under the first regulatory test based upon a misinterpretation of the \n19  statute, regulations and the OOH.  \n20 \n67.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class \n21 \nmembers because they seek relief on behalf of the class as a whole and have no interest \n22 \nantagonistic to other class members. \n23 \n68.  Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with extensive experience in \n24 \ncomplex class actions and extensive knowledge of immigration law. \n25 \n26 \n27 \nPls. Am.

In denying the H-1B petitions of Plaintiffs and putative class members, \n1 \nDefendants have acted and will continue to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire \n2 \n3  class, thereby making final injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a whole. \n4  The class may therefore be properly certified under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n5 \nDECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ALLEGATIONS \n6 \n70.  An actual and substantial controversy exists between the Plaintiffs and proposed \n7 \nclass members and the Defendants as to their respective rights and obligations. Plaintiffs contend \n8 \nthat Defendants’ actions violate Plaintiffs’ rights and the rights of the proposed class members. \n9 \n71.  Defendants’ pattern and practice of misinterpreting the OOH and misapplying the \n10 \n11  law forecloses Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent from demonstrating, absent \n12 \nlitigation, that their jobs are in a specialty occupation based on the first regulatory test. Where the \n13 \nOOH demonstrates that a bachelor’s or higher degree in a specific specialty is normally the \n14 \nminimum requirement for entry in the occupation that includes the job the H-1B petition seeks to \n15 \nfill, no further evidence is needed. This is the case with respect to the OOH entry for market \n16 \nresearch analyst. \n17 \n18  72.  Plaintiffs and proposed class members have suffered a legal wrong and have been \n19  adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action for which there is no adequate remedy at law. \n20 \nDefendants’ policy and practice of denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts under the \n21 \nfirst regulatory test constitutes final agency action. There are no administrative remedies that \n22 \nPlaintiffs must exhaust.  \n23 \n73.  Based on the foregoing, the Court should grant declaratory and injunctive relief \n24 \nunder 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706. \n25 \n26 \n27 \nPls. Am. Compl. for Decl. and Inj.

Although recognizing the OOH as authoritative for purposes of determining \n14 \nwhether an occupation profiled within it satisfies the first regulatory test for a specialty \n15 \n16  occupation, Defendant USCIS routinely misreads the OOH’s profile for market research analyst. \n17 \nSimultaneously, Defendant USCIS misinterprets the meaning of the statutory term “specific \n18 \nspecialty,” 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1), ignores entirely the regulatory term “normally,” 8 C.F.R. \n19 \n§ 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1) (2020), and misapplies the statute and the regulation.

Having carefully considered the briefs, the case file, and the \n22  relevant law, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion to sever and dismiss for the reasons set forth \n23  below.  \n24  I.  BACKGROUND \n25  A.  The H-1B Visa \n26    The Immigration and Nationality Act allows employers to petition for foreign workers in \n27  specialty occupations to come to the United States to perform services or labor.  8 U.S.C. § \n28  1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1); 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(1)(i).  The purpose of the H-1B provisions is to help \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 2 of 14\n \n1  employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the U.S. workforce \n2  by authorizing the temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not otherwise authorized \n3  to work in the United States.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1); 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(1)(i).  A \n4  “specialty occupation” is an occupation that requires theoretical and practical application of a body \n5  of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its \n6  equivalent).  8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(i)(A)(1).  The position must meet one of \n7  the four criteria to constitute a specialty occupation position: \n \n8  (1) A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the \nminimum requirement for entry into the particular position;  \n9  (2) The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel \npositions among similar organizations or, in the alternative, an \n10  employer may show that its particular position is so complex or \nunique that it can be performed only by an individual with a \n11  degree; \n(3) The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the \n  12  position; or \na\ntr in (4) The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex \nuoro 13  that  knowledge  required  to  perform  the  duties  is  usually \nCfi\n tla associated with the attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree.  \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo   8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). \niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  B.  Named Plaintiffs \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiff  MadKudu  Inc.  (“MadKudu”)  is  a  marketing  analytics  software  corporation \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  headquartered in Mountain View, California that filed an H-1B petition for a market research analyst \n19  position on or about April 2, 2019.  Dkt. 39 ¶¶ 12, 33, 34.  Defendant U.S. Citizenship and \n20  Immigration Services (“USCIS”) denied the petition on February 24, 2020 stating, among other \n21  things,  that  MadKudu  failed  to  demonstrate  that  the  position  satisfied  8  C.F.R.  § \n22  214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1), the first regulatory test for a specialty occupation.

Id. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  C.  Market Research Analyst Position  \nS d nr\nee 17  Plaintiffs allege that USCIS has a “pattern and practice” of erroneously denying H-1B \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  petitions for the market research analyst positions.  Id. at ¶ 29.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that \n19  after identifying the occupation within which the position falls, USCIS consults the Occupational \n20  Outlook Handbook (“OOH”), which provides for that position.  Id. at ¶ 25.  Plaintiffs allege the \n21  OOH establishes that the market research analyst position satisfies the first regulatory test for a \n22  “specialty occupation” because (a) it states the market research analyst position “typically need[s]” \n23  a bachelor’s degree or in some instances, a master’s degree, satisfying that a bachelor’s degree is \n24  “normally” the minimum degree requirement for the occupation and (b) it requires a bachelor’s \n25  degree in “market research or a related field” and identifies coursework in statistics, research \n26  methods, and marketing as “essential,” demonstrating that a “body of highly specialized knowledge” \n27  is necessary to perform the market research analyst job requirements.  Id. at ¶ 28.  This information \n28  allegedly demonstrates that the degree is in a specific specialty, but, accordingly to Plaintiffs,  \n3 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 4 of 14\n \n1  USCIS erroneously ignores the regulatory term “normally” and finds that OOH indicates several \n2  degrees or fields of study may qualify a person to perform the duties of a market research analyst, \n3  concluding this indicates the degree requirement is not in a specific specialty.  Id. at ¶¶ 28, 29. \n4  Plaintiffs allege that they are aware of at least 60 H-1B market research analyst petitions that \n5  were denied in the past three calendar years.  Id. at ¶ 32.  In all the denials, USCIS stated the same \n6  reasoning and similar language, finding that the OOH did not establish that a market research analyst \n7  was a specialty occupation under the first regulatory test.  Id. at ¶¶ 32, 63.  These decisions allegedly \n8  represent only a fraction of USCIS’ decisions denying market research analyst H-1B petitions on \n9  this basis during this period and the pattern and practice is continuing.

Motion to Sever Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21  \n12  Rule 20(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) permits plaintiffs to join in one \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  action if: “(A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  If the test for permissive joinder is not satisfied, a court has discretion to sever the misjoined parties, \nS d nr\nee 17  so long as no substantial right will be prejudiced by the severance.  Coughlin v. Rogers, 130 F.3d \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  1348, 1350 (9th Cir. 1997); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 21.  “Even once these requirements are met, a district \n19  court must examine whether permissive joinder would ‘comport with the principles of fundamental \n20  fairness’ or would result in prejudice to either side.”  Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., 232 F.3d 1271, \n21  1296 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Desert Empire Bank v. Insurance Co. of N. Am., 623 F.2d 1371, 1375 \n22  (9th Cir. 1980)).  “[P]ermissive joinder is to be construed liberally in order to promote trial \n23  convenience and to expedite the final determination of disputes, thereby preventing multiple \n24  lawsuits.”  League to Save Lake Tahoe v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 558 F.2d 914, 917 (9th \n25  Cir. 1977). \n26  B.  Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \n27    A defendant may move to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under \n28  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).  When a defendant moves to dismiss a complaint for lack \n4 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 5 of 14\n \n1  of subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists.  \n2  Thornhill Pub. Co., Inc. v. General Tel. & Electronics Corp., 594 F.2d 730, 733 (9th Cir. 1979).  “A \n3  Rule 12(b)(1) jurisdictional attack may be facial or factual.”  Safe Air for Everyone v. Meyer, 373 \n4  F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  “In a facial attack, the challenger asserts that the \n5  allegations contained in a complaint are insufficient on their face to invoke federal jurisdiction.”  Id.  \n6  Courts resolve a facial attack “as it would a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6): Accepting the \n7  plaintiff’s allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, the court \n8  determines whether the allegations are sufficient as a legal matter to invoke the court’s jurisdiction.”  \n9  Leite v. Crane Co., 749 F.3d 1117, 1121 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  On the other hand, “in \n10  a factual attack, the challenger disputes the truth of the allegations that, by themselves, would \n11  otherwise invoke federal jurisdiction.”  Safe Air for Everyone, 373 F.3d at 1039.   \n  12  C.  Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) \na\ntr in\nuoro 13    A party may bring a motion to dismiss an action for improper venue under Federal Rule of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).  If venue is found to be improper, the court “shall dismiss, or if it be in \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  brought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).  When venue is challenged, the plaintiff bears the burden of \nS d nr\nee 17  demonstrating that venue is proper.  Piedmont Label Co. v. Sun Garden Packing Co., 598 F.2d 491, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  496 (9th Cir. 1979) (“Plaintiff had the burden of showing that venue was properly laid in the \n19  Northern District of California.”).   \n20    The question of whether venue is wrong or improper is generally governed by 28 U.S.C. § \n21  1391.  Atlantic Marine Const. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Court for Western Dist. Of Texas, 571 U.S. 49, \n22  55 (2013) (internal quotations omitted).  In cases brought against agencies, officers, or employees \n23  of the United States, venue is proper “in any judicial district in which (A) a defendant in the action \n24  resides, (B) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a \n25  substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if \n26  no real property is involved in the action.”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).  If the case falls within one of \n27  the three categories, venue is proper.  See Atlantic Marine Const. Co., Inc., 571 U.S. at 56. \n28  //// \n5 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 6 of 14\n \n1  III.  DISCUSSION \n2  A.  Severance \n3  Defendants contend that severance as to all four named Plaintiffs is warranted in the instant \n4  litigation because the claims do not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence and do not present \n5  common questions of law or fact.  Dkt. 47 at 9, 16.  Plaintiffs dispute Defendants’ assertion of \n6  severance, contending that this case was brought as a class action to raise issues that are common to \n7  similarly situated parties.  Dkt. 48 at 7.  Further, Plaintiffs contend they are seeking a right to relief \n8  arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and a \n9  common question of law.  Id. at 8.  In its reply, Defendants argue that while there may be similar \n10  issues of law, that does not mean the cases involve the same transaction, occurrence, or series of \n11  transactions or occurrences.  Dkt. 49 at 7. \n  12  1.  Same  Transaction,  Occurrence,  or  Series  of  Transactions  or \na\ntr in Occurrences \nuoro 13 \nC tfila The first prong of the Rule 21 severance standard refers to “similarity in the factual \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo background of a claim.”  Coughlin, 130 F.3d at 1350.  “By its terms, this provision requires factual \niD tc 15 \n sir similarity in the allegations supporting Plaintiffs’ claims.”  Visendi v. Bank of America, N.A., 733 \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr F.3d 863, 870 (9th Cir. 2013).  Even though there may be different occurrences, joinder in a single \nee 17 \nth\nintr case may be appropriate where the claims involve enough related operative facts.  Nguyen v. CTS \nUo\nN 18 \nElectronics Manufacturing Solutions Inc., 301 F.R.D. 337, 341 (N.D. Cal. 2014). \n19 \nIn Coughlin, 49 plaintiffs brought suit against the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n20 \n(“INS”) and its then-Director, Richard Rogers, alleging that defendants unreasonably delayed \n21 \nadjudicating plaintiffs’ applications and petitions.  Coughlin, 130 F.3d at 1349.  The plaintiffs’ \n22 \napplications or petitions fell into six distinct categories, with some applications and petitions brought \n23 \nby United States citizens on behalf of an alien spouse or child, others brought by aliens on behalf of \n24 \nthemselves.  Id. at 1349–50.  In short, the applications and petitions were significantly different from \n25 \none another.  On these facts, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that each plaintiff “waited a different length \n26 \nof time, suffering a different duration of alleged delay” and in some instances, the delay was disputed \n27 \nand varied from case to case.  Id. at 1350.  The Ninth Circuit found that the existence of a common \n28 \n6 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 7 of 14\n \n1  allegation of delay alone did not suffice to create a common transaction or occurrence.  Id. \n2  Defendants argue that as in Coughlin, each applicant in the instant case presents a different \n3  factual situation and therefore each must receive personalized attention by the agency and the Court.  \n4  Dkt. 47 at 17.  Plaintiffs contend that Coughlin highlights an important difference with the instant \n5  litigation, which is challenging a uniform pattern and practice of Defendants that adversely affects \n6  all Plaintiffs.  Dkt. 48 at 9.  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs in Coughlin had not \n7  alleged a pattern or policy of delay by the INS in dealing with the applications or petitions, but \n8  rather, claimed that in specific instances, the applications and petitions were not addressed in a \n9  timely manner.  Coughlin, 130 F.3d at 1350.  In severing the plaintiffs’ claims, the Ninth Circuit \n10  purposefully recognized that the plaintiffs “do not allege that their claims arise out of a systemic \n11  pattern of events and, therefore, arise from the same transaction or occurrence.”  Id. \n12  Here, Plaintiffs are not merely claiming that in specific instances, the H-1B petitions they \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  filed on behalf of noncitizens they sought to hire in the market research analyst occupation were \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  denied.  Rather, Plaintiffs are challenging USCIS’ pattern and practice of arbitrarily and unlawfully \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts.  Dkt. 39 ¶¶ 1, 6, 29, 32, 65; Dkt. 48 at 8.  The \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  fact that H-1B denials were adjudicated at separate USCIS service centers across the country does \nS d nr\nee 17  not  undermine  Plaintiffs’  argument  that  the  denials  involve  the  same  series  of  occurrences.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs alleging their claims arise out of a systemic pattern \n19  of events and result in denial of the H-1B petitions for the market research analyst occupation are \n20  sufficiently related to constitute a common transaction or occurrence. \n21  2.  Common Questions of Law or Fact \n22    The second prong is whether any common questions of law or fact will arise in the action.  \n23  “Commonality under Rule 20(a)(1)(B) is not a particularly stringent test” and requires only a single \n24  common question.  Nguyen, 301 F.R.D. at 341 (citations omitted). \n25    Defendants argue that each plaintiff employer has a “separate case to plead” and even if a \n26  decision on the common issue of the validity of the government’s application of a specific regulation \n27  or statute might impact each Plaintiff’s individual case, it will not necessarily be dispositive.  Dkt. \n28  47 at 19.  Plaintiffs counter by pointing to the common question of law of whether Defendants are \n7 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 8 of 14\n \n1  denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts based on a misinterpretation of the statutory \n2  term “specific specialty” and the first regulatory test as well as an erroneous reading of the OOH \n3  profile for market research analysts.  Dkt. 48 at 9.  \n4    Coughlin is both distinguishable and instructive for the second prong as well.  In addressing \n5  this prong, the Ninth Circuit again referenced that the plaintiffs are not alleging that Defendants \n6  engaged in a policy of delay.  Coughlin, 130 F.3d at 1351.  Additionally, the Ninth Circuit concluded \n7  that plaintiffs failed the second prong of the test because each category of Plaintiffs filed different \n8  applications, petitions, or forms with different legal standards as to each type of application or \n9  petition.  Id.  As a result, each applicant or petitioner presented a different factual situation and \n10  required personalized attention by the INS.  Id.  For the reasons stated in Section III.A.1 above, the \n11  instant case is easily distinguishable. \n12  Stellar IT Solutions, Inc. v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, No. 18-cv-\n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  2015 (RC), 2019 WL 3430746 (D.D.C. July 30, 2019) is also distinguishable.  Plaintiff InDepth \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Engineering Solutions, LLC filed a motion to intervene in a case brought by Stellar IT Solutions, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Inc., who had filed a lawsuit after the company’s H-1B visa on behalf of a software engineer was \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  denied.  Id. at *2–3.  The district court found that Indepth’s motion to intervene did not raise \nS d nr\nee 17  common questions of law or fact as it did not appear that the two petitions shared “a single piece of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  evidence in common” and the two job positions were different.  Id. at 4.  Furthermore, Stellar IT’s \n19  case involved an additional legal question that was not at issue in InDepth’s case.  Id. \n20  In direct contrast to Stellar IT Solutions, the instant litigation is not simply about the denial \n21  of one employer’s H-1B petition.  Rather, Plaintiffs are claiming USCIS has a pattern and practice \n22  of misinterpreting the OOH’s profile of a market research analyst and has engaged in a systemic \n23  pattern or practice of unlawful decision-making.  Dkt. 39 ¶¶ 6, 29, 32, 65; Dkt. 48 at 14, 16–17.  \n24  Further, the claims are specific to the market research analyst occupation and all involve the first \n25  regulatory test which authorizes a position to qualify as a specialty occupation.  Dkt. 39 ¶¶ 3–6; Dkt. \n26  48 at 8.  As a result, the claims involve common questions of law regarding USCIS’ alleged pattern \n27  and practice of unlawful decision-making in regards to the H-1B petitions for the market research \n28  analyst occupation.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to sever is DENIED.  \n8 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 9 of 14\n \n1  B.  Mootness \n2    Defendants contend that the instant litigation is moot as to MadKudu and Quick Fitting \n3  because they obtained the H-1B visa approvals they sought and therefore should be dismissed from \n4  this action.  Dkt. 47 at 20–21.  Defendants further contend that the “voluntary cessation” and \n5  “capable of repetition, yet evading review” exceptions to the mootness doctrine do not apply.  Id. at \n6  21.  MadKudu and Quick Fitting do not dispute that their H-1B decisions were later reversed and \n7  the H-1B petitions were ultimately approved.  Dkt. 39 ¶¶ 39, 46.  However, MadKudu and Quick \n8  Fitting dispute Defendants’ assertion of mootness and argue that they retain a personal stake in the \n9  case.  Dkt. 48 at 15–16.  Plaintiffs also assert this Court can grant effective relief to 2nd Street and \n10  Hanguang International and the putative class.  Id.  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that their claims satisfy \n11  two of the exceptions to the mootness doctrine: the “voluntary cessation” and “capable of repetition \n12  yet evading review” exceptions.  Id. at 16. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  1.  Voluntary Cessation \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Defendants contend that the voluntary cessation doctrine does not apply here because USCIS \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  approved MadKudu and Quick Fitting’s H-1B petitions that were at issue in this litigation and there \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  is “no likelihood of recurrence of the challenged activity.”  Dkt. 47 at 21 (internal quotations \nS d nr\nee 17  omitted).  Further, Defendants contend that any claim by MadKudu and Quick Fitting that USCIS \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  will deny their future H-1B extension petitions for the same market research analyst positions is \n19  speculative.  Id.  \n20   “A case becomes moot . . . when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack \n21  a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Am. Diabetes Ass’n v. United States Dep’t of the \n22  Army, 938 F.3d 1147, 1152 (9th Cir. 2019) (citing Rosebrock v. Mathis, 745 F.3d 963, 971 (9th Cir. \n23  2014) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “It is well settled that a defendant’s \n24  voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to \n25  determine the legality of the practice.”  Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), \n26  Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  “In accordance \n27  with this principle, the standard we have announced for determining whether a case has been mooted \n28  by the defendant’s voluntary conduct is stringent: A case might become moot if subsequent events \n9 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 10 of 14\n \n1  made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to \n2  recur.”  Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The “heavy burden” of persuading the \n3  court that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur lies with the party asserting \n4  mootness.  Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  In order for this exception to apply, \n5  “the defendant’s voluntary cessation must have arisen because of the litigation.”  Public Utilities \n6  Comm’n of State of Cal. v. F.E.R.C., 100 F.3d 1451, 1460 (9th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). \n7    In Sze v. I.N.S., 153 F.3d 1005 (9th Cir. 1998), overruled in part by United States v. \n8  Hovsepian, 359 F.3d 1144 (9th Cir. 2004), the plaintiffs asserted that the INS failed to make a \n9  determination to grant or deny their applications within the required timeframe.  During the \n10  pendency of the action, the INS naturalized some of the named plaintiffs.  Id. at 1008.  The plaintiffs \n11  asserted that the timing of the INS’ decisions to naturalize the named plaintiffs indicate the \n12  applications were approved because of the litigation.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit reasoned that it appeared \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  that the INS acted on the naturalization applications “in due course, albeit significantly delayed due \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  course” and Plaintiffs demonstrated “no more than correlation” and failed to show causation.  Id.  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Further, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because the INS altered the naturalization application \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  process, the class of potential plaintiffs “has effectively been closed” and there is “little likelihood \nS d nr\nee 17  of recurrence of the challenged activity.”  Id. at 1008–09 (internal quotations omitted). \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    In contrast to the plaintiffs in Sze who had not received a determination in their applications \n19  when the lawsuit was filed, USCIS denied Plaintiffs’ H-1B petitions prior to this lawsuit.  After the \n20  initial denials in their H-1B petitions and less than four weeks after the lawsuit was filed, Plaintiffs \n21  argue that USCIS took the “extraordinary, sua sponte step” of reopening and re-adjudicating \n22  MadKudu and Quick Fitting’s denied petitions.  Dkt. 48 at 19.  Plaintiffs contend that this timing \n23  demonstrates that Defendants took this action specifically in response to the lawsuit and that \n24  Defendants have failed to show any evidence showing the contrary.  Id.  Further, Plaintiffs point out \n25  that Defendants have sought and continue to seek dismissal of the lawsuit based upon the approval \n26  of those petitions.  Id.  Defendants state that USCIS’ sua sponte reopening and approval of their \n27  cases was not “extraordinary,” acknowledging that it was “not uncommon for the agency to \n28  reconsider its initial decision following the commencement of a lawsuit, and represents a good faith \n10 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 11 of 14\n \n1  effort by the parties to conserve judicial resources by administratively resolving the issues in the \n2  case in lieu of litigation.”  Dkt. 49 at 12.  Defendants further argue that because they only reopened \n3  and approved two of the four named Plaintiffs’ H-1B petitions, USCIS’ actions could not have been \n4  in direct response to the instant litigation.  Id. at 13.  The Court does not find this latter point \n5  persuasive.  Rather, the timing of USCIS’ approval of two of the Plaintiffs’ petitions along with \n6  USCIS’ acknowledgment that it often revisits petitions following the commencement of a lawsuit \n7  together demonstrate that USCIS’ voluntary cessation arose because of the instant litigation.  \n8    The Court also disagrees with Defendants’ assertion that there is no likelihood of recurrence \n9  of the challenged activity.  Unlike in Sze where some of the named plaintiffs were naturalized and \n10  the class of potential plaintiffs effectively closed due to an alteration of the naturalization application \n11  process, there is a likelihood that the named Plaintiffs in the instant litigation will experience the \n12  challenged activity again.  In Sze, once plaintiffs received their naturalization, it was “highly \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  unlikely that they would ever have to repeat the process.”  Sze, 153 F.3d at 1009.  However, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  MadKudu and Quick Fitting have both asserted they plan to file additional H-1B petitions for the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  continuation of their respective market research analysts’ employment.  Dkt. 48 at 16–17; Dkt. 48-\n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  1 at ¶ 10; Dkt. 48-2 at ¶ 7.  Moreover, there is a likelihood that similarly situated employers will \nS d nr\nee 17  submit H-1B petitions to hire a new employee or to keep an employee in the market research analyst \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  position.  As such, the allegedly wrongful behavior could reasonably be expected to recur whenever \n19  employers submit H-1B petitions for the market research analyst occupation.  Consequently, the \n20  Court does not find that Defendants have overcome the “heavy burden” of persuading the Court that \n21  the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur and finds that the voluntary cessation \n22  exception applies.  \n23    Further, Defendants’ argument that this case is moot ignores the requests for relief and \n24  Plaintiffs’ assertions that they are challenging USCIS’ denial of H-1B petitions on behalf of \n25  themselves and all others who are similarly situated.  Dkt. 39 ¶ 59; Dkt. 48 at 15–16; see Al Otro \n26  Lado, Inc. v. Nielsen, 327 F. Supp. 3d 1284, 1297 (S.D. Cal. 2018) (finding that the plaintiffs sought \n27  other forms of relief including declaratory judgment that defendants’ “policies, practices, acts and/or \n28  omissions” violate various laws and Defendants made “no meaningful attempt to argue that their \n11 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 12 of 14\n \n1  agreement to process the Individual Plaintiffs moots these requests for injunctive and declaratory \n2  relief”).  Indeed, in PayJoy, Inc. v. Cuccinelli, No. 19-cv-03977-HSG, 2020 WL 1812193, at *2 \n3  (N.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2020), the district court deemed it no longer had jurisdiction over the case only \n4  “[b]ecause the exact relief sought in this action, requiring Defendant to approve a H-1B petition” \n5  had already been granted (emphasis added).  Here, Plaintiffs are seeking “a declaration that \n6  Defendants’ adjudicatory practices with respect to H-1B petitions for Market Research Analysts \n7  violates the APA, the INA and the regulations” and are seeking “an order that they immediately \n8  adjudicate all such petitions in accordance with the law.”  Dkt. 48 at 15–17.  “A case becomes moot \n9  only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.”  \n10  Knox v. S.E.I.U, Local 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 307 (citations and internal quotations omitted).  “[A]s \n11  long as the parties have a concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the litigation, the case \n12  is not moot.”  Ellis v. Brotherhood of Ry., Airline and S.S. Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Station Emps, et al., 466 U.S. 435, 442 (1984).   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14    Additionally, even if the claim of the named plaintiff has become moot, the controversy may \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  still exist between a named defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  See Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402–03 (1975).  Indeed, “the putative class action nature of this \nS d nr\nee 17  case does change the Court’s analysis” and “[c]ourts are sensitive to assertions of mootness in the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  class action context.”  Al Otro Lado, Inc., 327 F. Supp. 3d at 1303.  Plaintiffs brought this pattern \n19  or practice claim as a class action and the operative complaint is on behalf of the four named \n20  Plaintiffs and similarly situated H-1B petitioners.  Dkt. 39 ¶¶ 1, 59.  As a result, this case is not moot \n21  given that it remains possible for the Court to grant effectual relief to the named Plaintiffs and the \n22  similarly situated H-1B petitioners.  Because the Court finds that the voluntary cessation exception \n23  to mootness applies in this case, the Court need not consider whether the “capable of repetition, yet \n24  evading review” exception to the mootness doctrine applies.  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to \n25  dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is DENIED.  \n26  IV.  VENUE   \n27    Defendants contend that Plaintiffs 2nd Street, located in Los Angeles, California, and \n28  Hanguang International, operating out of New York, New York, do not have claims that are \n12 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 13 of 14\n \n1  appropriately venued in this District and must be dismissed entirely from this case.  Dkt. 47 at 22.  \n2  Specifically, Defendants argue that when there are multiple parties and/or multiple claims in an \n3  action, plaintiffs must establish that venue is proper “as to each defendant and as to each claim.”  Id. \n4  at 23.  Plaintiffs dispute Defendants’ assertion, stating the case was filed in accordance with 28 \n5  U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C) because MadKudu resides in this District and no real property is involved.  \n6  Dkt. 48 at 22; Dkt. 39 ¶ 9.  Plaintiffs further contend that because the instant action was filed as a \n7  nationwide class action and 2nd Street and Hanguang International are appropriately joined, venue \n8  is appropriate.  Dkt. 48 at 22.  In its reply, Defendants argue that because MadKudu’s claims are \n9  moot, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that venue is proper and the Court should dismiss 2nd Street \n10  and Hanguang International entirely from this case.  Dkt. 49 at 14–15. \n11    “Each court faced with the same issue has interpreted ‘the plaintiff’ to mean ‘any plaintiff,’ \n12  finding that Congress intended to broaden the number of districts in which suits could be brought \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  against government entities.”  Sidney Coal Co., Inc. v. Social Sec. Admin., 427 F.3d 336, 344–45 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (6th Cir. 2005).  “For purposes of § 1391(e)(1)(C), the clear weight of federal authority holds that \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  venue is proper in a multi-plaintiff case if any plaintiff resides in the District.”  Californians for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Renewable Energy v. United States EPA, No. C 15-3293 SBA, 2018 WL 1586211, at *19 (N.D. \nS d nr\nee 17  Cal. Mar. 30, 2018).  Indeed, “requiring every plaintiff in an action against the federal government \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  or an agent thereof to independently meet section 1391(e)’s standards would result in an unnecessary \n19  multiplicity of litigation.”  Exxon Corp. v. F.T.C., 588 F.2d 895, 898 (3d Cir. 1978), overruled in \n20  part on other grounds by Reifer v. Westport Ins. Corp., 751 F.3d 129 (3d Cir. 2014).   \n21    As stated above, the Court has denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule \n22  12(b)(1) based on mootness regarding MadKudu and Quick Fitting’s claims and MadKudu remains \n23  one of the named Plaintiffs in this action.  Because MadKudu resides in the Northern District of \n24  California and no real property is involved in this action, venue is proper before this Court.  See 28 \n25  U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1); Californians for Renewable Energy, 2018 WL 1586211, at *5–6 (finding that \n26  only one Plaintiff must reside within the forum district for venue purposes); Mosleh v. Pompeo, No. \n27  1:19-cv-00656-LJO-BAM, 2019 WL 2524407, at *1 (E.D. Cal. June 19, 2019) (finding venue was \n28  proper  before  the  Court  because  at  least  one plaintiff resided  in  that  district);  Dkt.  39 ¶  9.  \n13 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 51   Filed 09/14/20   Page 14 of 14\n \n1  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3) is DENIED. \n2  V.

(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  similarly aggrieved U.S. employers against Defendants U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \nS d nr\nee 17  (“USCIS”) and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli in his official capacity (collectively, “Defendants”).  Dkt. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  39 (“First Amended Complaint”).  Before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.  \n19  Dkt. 40 (“Motion”).   \n20    All parties have consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge.  Dkts. 13, 33, 34, 43.  \n21  The Court held a hearing on October 27, 2020.  Dkt. 58.  After considering the Parties’ \n22  submissions, arguments at the hearing, the case file, and relevant law, the Court GRANTS IN \n23  PART Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification for the reasons discussed below. \n24  II.  BACKGROUND \n25  A.  The H-1B Visa \n26    The Immigration and Nationality Act allows employers to petition for foreign workers in \n27  specialty occupations to come to the United States to perform services or labor. 8 U.S.C. § \n28  1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1); 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(1)(i).  The purpose of the H-1B provisions is to help \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 2 of 17\n \n1  employers who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the U.S. \n2  workforce by authorizing the temporary employment of qualified individuals who are not \n3  otherwise authorized to work in the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1); 8 C.F.R. § \n4  214.2(h)(1)(i).  A “specialty occupation” is an occupation that requires theoretical and practical \n5  application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor’s or higher degree in the \n6  specific specialty (or its equivalent). 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(i)(A)(1).  The \n7  position must meet one of the four criteria to constitute a specialty occupation position: \n8   \n(1) A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the \n9  minimum requirement for entry into the particular position; \n(2) The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel \n10  positions  among  similar  organizations  or,  in  the  alternative,  an \nemployer may show that its particular position is so complex or \n11  unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree; \n(3) The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the \n  12  position; or \na\ntr in (4) The nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex \nuoro 13  that knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated \nCfi\n tla with the attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree. \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo   8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). \niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  B.  Interim Final Rule (“IFR”) \nS d nr\nee 17    On October 8, 2020, while briefing on the Motion was in progress, the Department of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Homeland Security (“DHS”) issued an interim final rule amending the regulations for H-1B \n19  petitions.  The IFR will take effect on December 7, 2020 for all H-1B petitions, including \n20  amended petitions or petition extensions, filed on or after that date.  See Strengthening the H-1B \n21  Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program, 85 Fed. Reg. 63,918 (Oct. 8, 2020).  In relevant part, \n22  DHS is revising the regulatory definition and standards for a “specialty occupation” to align with \n23  the statutory definition of “specialty occupation.”  Id. at 63,924.  Specifically, the rule “amends the \n24  definition of a ‘specialty occupation’ at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(ii) to clarify that there must be a \n25  direct relationship between the required degree field(s) and the duties of the position” and \n26  “clarifies that a position would not qualify as a specialty occupation if attainment of a general \n27  degree, without further specialization, is sufficient to qualify for the position.”  Id. at 63,924–25, \n28  63,964 (“Specialty occupation means an occupation that requires . . . [t]he attainment of a U.S. \n2 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 3 of 17\n \n1  bachelor’s degree or higher in a directly related specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum \n2  for entry into the occupation in the United States.”).  Further, DHS is eliminating the term \n3  “normally” from 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A), meaning “that the petitioner will have to establish \n4  that the bachelor’s degree in a specific specialty or its equivalent is a minimum requirement for \n5  entry into the occupation in the United States by showing that this is always the requirement for \n6  the occupation as a whole . . .”  Id. at 63,926. \n7  C.  Named Plaintiffs \n8    Plaintiff MadKudu Inc. (“MadKudu”) is a marketing analytics software corporation \n9  headquartered in Mountain View, California.  Dkt. 40 at 12; Dkt. 40-2 ¶¶ 2–3.  On or about April \n10  2, 2019, MadKudu filed an H-1B petition for a market research analyst position.  Dkt. 40 at 13; \n11  Dkt. 40-2 ¶¶ 4–6.  USCIS denied the petition on February 24, 2020, stating that MadKudu failed \n12  to demonstrate that the position was a specialty occupation under any of the independent \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  regulatory tests.  Dkt. 40 at 13; Dkt. 40-2 ¶ 7; Dkt. 40-3.  Specifically, USCIS determined that \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  MadKudu’s petition did not meet the first regulatory test because the Occupational Outlook \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Handbook (“OOH”) did not show that market research analyst positions normally require a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  minimum of a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent in a specific specialty at the entry level.  Dkt. 40 \nS d nr\nee 17  at 13; Dkt. 40-3 at 4–5.  On May 11, 2020, USCIS approved MadKudu’s petition without \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  explanation.  Dkt. 40 at 13; Dkt. 40-11 at 2–3. \n19    Plaintiff Quick Fitting, Inc. (“Quick Fitting”), a plumbing fittings supplier headquartered \n20  in Warwick, Rhode Island, also filed an H-1B petition for a market research analyst position on or \n21  about August 20, 2019.  Dkt. 40 at 14; Dkt. 40-4 ¶¶ 2–5.  On January 23, 2020, USCIS denied the \n22  petition, stating Quick Fitting failed to demonstrate that the position was a specialty occupation \n23  under any of the independent regulatory tests.  Dkt. 40 at 14; Dkt. 40-4 ¶¶ 6–7; Dkt. 40-5.  \n24  Specifically, USCIS determined that Quick Fitting’s petition did not meet the first regulatory test \n25  because the OOH did not show that market research analyst positions normally require a minimum \n26  of a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent in a specific specialty at the entry level.  Dkt. 40 at 14; \n27  Dkt. 40-5 ¶¶ 4–5.  On May 11, 2020, USCIS approved Quick Fitting’s H-1B petition without \n28  explanation.  Dkt. 40 at 15; Dkt. 40-11 at 4–5.   \n3 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 4 of 17\n \n1    Plaintiff 2nd Street USA, Inc. (“2nd Street”), a clothing corporation headquartered in Los \n2  Angeles, California, filed an H-1B petition for a market research analyst position on or about April \n3  11, 2019.  Dkt. 40 at 15–16; Dkt. 40-12 ¶¶ 2–5.  On September 12, 2019, USCIS denied 2nd \n4  Street’s H-1B petition under each of the independent regulatory tests and stated that the petition \n5  did not meet the first regulatory test because the OOH did not show that market research analyst \n6  positions normally require a minimum of a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent in a specific \n7  specialty at the entry level.  Dkt. 40 at 16; Dkt. 40-12 ¶ 6; Dkt. 40-13 at 5–6.  On September 16, \n8  2020, USCIS reopened and approved 2nd Street’s H-1B petition.  Dkt. 54 at 8; Dkt. 54-1 at 7–11. \n9    Hanguang International, Inc. (“Hanguang International”) is an educational consulting \n10  services corporation with its principal place of business in New York, New York.  Dkt. 40 at 16; \n11  Dkt. 40-14 ¶¶ 2–4.  On or about April 2, 2019, Hanguang International filed an H-1B petition for a \n12  market research position.  Dkt. 40 at 16; Dkt. 40-14 ¶ 5.  USCIS denied the petition on November \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  1, 2019 for failing to demonstrate that the position was a specialty occupation and stated that the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  OOH did not show that market research analyst positions normally require a minimum of a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  bachelor’s degree or its equivalent in a specific specialty at the entry level.  Dkt. 40 at 16; Dkt. 40-\n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  14 ¶ 6; Dkt. 40-15 at 5–6. \nS d nr\nee 17  D.  Market Research Analyst Position \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18    Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have a “policy and practice of arbitrarily and unlawfully \n19  denying H-1B nonimmigrant worker petitions for the specialty occupation of market research \n20  analyst.”  Dkt. 40 at 8.  Plaintiffs are only challenging the first test, which currently states that a \n21  position will qualify as a specialty occupation if “[a] baccalaureate or higher degree or its \n22  equivalent is normally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position.”  Dkt. 40 at \n23  10; 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1).  Plaintiffs allege that USCIS routinely relies on the OOH, \n24  which includes a profile of the market research analyst occupation and states that market research \n25  analysts typically need a bachelor’s degree in market research or a related field and courses in \n26  statistics, research methods, and marketing.  Dkt. 40 at 10–12.  Further, Plaintiffs allege that \n27  USCIS erroneously concludes that the OOH does not establish that the occupation requires a \n28  bachelor’s degree or higher in a specific specialty or its equivalent and “fails to give meaning to \n4 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 5 of 17\n \n1  the term ‘normally’ in the first regulatory test.”  Id. at 10–11.  Plaintiffs allege that had USCIS \n2  properly interpreted and applied the statute, the regulations, and the OOH profile, it would have \n3  found that the market research analyst occupation is a specific occupation and would have \n4  approved Plaintiffs’ and putative class members’ H-1B petitions.  Id. at 12. \n5  E.  Procedural Background \n6    On April 16, 2020, Plaintiffs MadKudu and Quick Fitting filed a class action complaint.  \n7  Dkt. 1.  These initial Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on May 4, 2020.  Dkt. 26.  On \n8  June 29, 2020, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that \n9  Plaintiffs lack standing because USCIS approved MadKudu and Quick Fitting’s H-1B petitions.  \n10  Dkt. 36.  On July 20, 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding Plaintiffs 2nd Street and \n11  Hanguang International, and the instant motion for class certification.  Dkts. 39, 40.  In the instant \n12  motion, Plaintiffs move for this Court to certify the following proposed class under Rule 23 of the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14   \ni\nrts fo All U.S. employers who in 2019 filed, or in the future will file, a \niD tc 15  petition (Form I-129 or any successor) with USCIS for an H-1B \n sir\net classification under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) for a market \ntatsiD 16  research analyst where: \nS d nr •  USCIS denied or will deny the petition solely or in part based \nee 17  on a finding that the OOH entry for market research analyst \nth\nintr does  not  establish  that  the  occupation  is  a  specialty \nUo\nN 18  occupation,  and  thus  does  not  satisfy  8  C.F.R.  § \n214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and \n19  •  But for this finding, the petition would be approved. \n20  Pursuant to the Court’s briefing schedule (Dkt. 44), on August 4, 2020, Defendants filed a motion \n21  to dismiss and a motion to sever, which the Court subsequently denied.  Dkts. 47–49, 51.  In \n22  opposition to the motion for class certification, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to meet \n23  their burden under Rule 23.  Dkt. 54.  After the IFR was published, the Court allowed Defendants \n24  to file a sur-reply in light of this recent development, which is discussed in further detail below.  \n25  Dkts. 56–57. \n26  III.  LEGAL STANDARD \n27  The Court has the discretion to grant or deny class certification under Federal Rule of Civil \n28  Procedure 23.  Zinser v. Accufix Research Inst., Inc., 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 2001).  \n5 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 6 of 17\n \n1  “Where appropriate, the district court may redefine the class, see Penk v. Oregon State Bd. of \n2  Higher Educ., 816 F.2d 458, 467 (9th Cir.1987), may excise portions of a plaintiffs [sic] class \n3  allegations, and may even decertify the class.”  Armstrong v.

California, 543 U.S. 499, 125 S.Ct. 1141, \n5  160 L.Ed.2d 949 (2005), as recognized in B.K. by next friend Tinsley v. Snyder, 922 F.3d 957, 974 \n6  (9th Cir. 2019).   \n7  Rule 23 is a two-prong test.  First, Rule 23(a) provides that a class may only be certified if: \n8  “(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions \n9  of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \n10  typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \n11  adequately protect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  These four requirements are \n12  commonly referred to as “numerosity,” “commonality,” “typicality,” and “adequacy.”  If all four \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  prerequisites of Rule 23(a) are satisfied, the Court must then turn to the requirements of Rule \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  23(b).  Rule 23(b) requires the plaintiff to “satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of Rule \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  23(b)’s provisions.”  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013).  In this case, Plaintiffs \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  seek certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), which permits certification of cases where “the party \nS d nr\nee 17  opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \n19  whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n20    The party seeking class certification bears the burden of proof in demonstrating that it has \n21  satisfied all four Rule 23(a) prerequisites and that their class lawsuit falls within one of the three \n22  types of actions permitted under Rule 23(b).  Zinser, 253 F.3d at 1186.  The failure to meet “any \n23  one of Rule 23’s requirements destroys the alleged class action.”  Rutledge v. Elec. Hose & \n24  Rubber Co., 511 F.2d 668, 673 (9th Cir. 1975).  Consequently, when considering whether to \n25  certify a class under Rule 23, district courts must perform “a rigorous analysis” to ensure that Rule \n26  23(a) has been satisfied.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350–51 (2011).  This \n27  “rigorous analysis” may require a court “to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on \n28  the certification question.”  Sandoval v. M1 Auto Collisions Ctrs., 309 F.R.D. 549, 560 (N.D. Cal. \n6 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 7 of 17\n \n1  2015) (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982)).  A court’s analysis of the \n2  certification question “will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim,” \n3  and “a district court must consider the merits if they overlap with the Rule 23(a) requirements.”  \n4  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 351; Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011).  \n5  The Court must resolve factual disputes as “necessary to determine whether there was a common \n6  pattern and practice that could affect the class as a whole.”  Ellis, 657 F.3d at 983.  When \n7  resolving such factual disputes in the context of a motion for class certification, district courts \n8  must consider “the persuasiveness of the evidence presented.”  Id. at 982.  “Because the early \n9  resolution of the class certification question requires some degree of speculation, however, all that \n10  is required is that the Court form a ‘reasonable judgment’ on each certification requirement.  In \n11  formulating this judgment, the Court may properly consider both the allegations of the class action \n12  complaint and the supplemental evidentiary submissions of the parties.”  In re Citric Acid \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Antitrust Litig., No. 95–1092, C–95–2963 FMS, 1996 WL 655791, at *2 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (citing \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 900–01 (9th Cir. 1975)). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  IV.  ANALYSIS \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  A.  Impact of IFR on Proposed Class \nS d nr\nee 17  As an initial matter, the Court addresses the impact on class certification of the IFR, which \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  takes effect on December 7, 2020, and presents regulatory changes as outlined in Section II.B.  As \n19  structured by Plaintiffs, members of the proposed class would be evaluated under two different \n20  regulations — the current version of 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) for employers who filed H-1B \n21  petitions before December 7, 2020 and the IFR for those who filed H-1B petitions on or after \n22  December 7, 2020.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs contend that the IFR does not impact Plaintiffs’ \n23  motion for class certification because the OOH entry for market research analysts satisfies both the \n24  current regulatory test as well as the amended regulatory test.  Dkt. 55 at 7.  Plaintiffs further \n25  argue that the question of whether the OOH entry for market research analyst satisfies the \n26  amended regulatory test is a question to be resolved on the merits, rather than at the class \n27  certification stage.  Id.  Plaintiffs also urge that at most, this new regulation would warrant two \n28  //// \n7 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 8 of 17\n \n1  subclasses, those who are subject to the current regulation and those who are subject to the IFR.  \n2  Id.   \n3  The Court does not agree with Plaintiffs’ construct.  Certifying the class as proposed by \n4  Plaintiffs would require the Court to evaluate claims under two different regulatory schemes, \n5  depending on the timing of the submission of the H-1B petition.  Further, subclasses are not \n6  appropriate here.  While Rule 23(c)(5) provides that “a class may be divided into subclasses that \n7  are each treated as a class,” each subclass “must independently meet the requirements of Rule 23 \n8  for the maintenance of a class action.”  Betts v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 659 F.2d 1000, \n9  1005 (9th Cir. 1981).  Plaintiffs’ proposed subclass for employers who are subject to the IFR do \n10  not satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a).  For instance, Plaintiffs would not be able to satisfy the \n11  numerosity requirement for this subclass, as there are currently no class members in this class.  \n12  Further, “[o]f particular importance is that the court be certain that each subclass is adequately \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  represented.”  Id.  Indeed, “[c]ertification of a subclass fails where a subclass representative is not \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  a member of the subclass he or she seeks to represent.”  Sueoka v. U.S., 101 F. App’x. 649, 654 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (9th Cir. 2004); see also Hawkins v. Comparet-Cassani, 251 F.3d 1230, 1238 (9th Cir. 2001) \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  (determining that the class certified was defective because Plaintiff could not represent a class \nS d nr\nee 17  alleging constitutional claims that he does not have standing to raise).  Plaintiffs do not argue that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  they can adequately represent this proposed subclass, nor could they since the IFR has not yet \n19  taken effect and no employers currently have standing to assert claims under the IFR.  \n20  Accordingly, the Court restricts the proposed class to U.S. employers who filed or will file H-1B \n21  applications for an H-1B classification under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) for a market \n22  research analyst from January 1, 2019 through December 6, 2020.  With this adjustment to the \n23  proposed class, the Court addresses the Rule 23 factors below.   \n24  B.  Ascertainability and Standing of H-1B Petitioners \n25  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ proposed class should not be certified because it is not \n26  ascertainable.  Specifically, Defendants contend that the proposed class is not ascertainable \n27  because it includes H-1B petitioners that lack Article III standing.  Dkt. 54 at 13–16.  Further, \n28  Defendants argue that three of the named Plaintiffs cannot be members of the proposed class \n8 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 9 of 17\n \n1  because they no longer suffer any injury.  Id. at 16–17.   \n2  The Ninth Circuit held that “the language of Rule 23 does not impose a freestanding \n3  administrative feasibility prerequisite to class certification.”  Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 844 \n4  F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir. 2017).  Indeed, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that “ascertainability” is not a \n5  threshold requirement for class certification and rather, it is relevant only to the extent it is \n6  implicated by Rule 23’s enumerated requirements.  Id. at 1124 n.4 (citations omitted).  “The \n7  inclusion of future class members in a class is not itself unusual or objectionable” and is not a \n8  barrier to ascertainability.  Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1118 (9th Cir. 2010).  The \n9  proposed class is sufficient if “plaintiffs’ class definitions provide objective criteria that allow \n10  class members to determine whether they are included in the proposed class.”  Farar v. Bayer AG, \n11  No. 14-cv-04601-WHO, 2017 WL 5952876, at *14 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 15, 2017). \n12  Here, the Court finds that the class can be ascertained based on objective criteria.  The \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  class, as adjusted by the Court in Section IV.A. above, requires a class member: (a) to have filed a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  petition with USCIS for an H-1B classification under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)H)(i)(b); (b) to have \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  filed the petition for a market research analyst position; (c) to have filed this between January 1, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  2019 through December 6, 2020; (d) to have the petition denied; (e) to be denied based on a \nS d nr\nee 17  finding that the OOH entry for market research analyst does not establish that the occupation is a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  specialty occupation and thus does not satisfy 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and finally (f) but \n19  for this finding, the petition would have been approved.  Based on the objective criteria, Plaintiffs’ \n20  proposed class is ascertainable.  \n21  Article III standing requires that (1) the plaintiff suffered “concrete and particularized” and \n22  “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical” injury, (2) the injury is “fairly traceable to \n23  the challenged action” and (3) the injury is likely to be “redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan \n24  v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal \n25  quotation marks and citations omitted).   \n26  Defendants’ standing arguments fail for several reasons.  First, “[i]n a class action, \n27  standing is satisfied if at least one named plaintiff meets the requirements.”  Bates v. United \n28  Parcel Service, Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted).  Here, while Defendants \n9 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 10 of 17\n \n1  point out that MadKudu, Quick Fitting, and 2nd Street no longer have H-1B petitions denied by \n2  USCIS, Defendants all but concede that at least one named plaintiff, Hanguang International, has \n3  standing.  Dkt. 54 at 16.  Further, the Court has previously reasoned that Defendants’ argument \n4  regarding the named Plaintiffs who later had their H-1B petitions approved “ignores the requests \n5  for relief and Plaintiffs’ assertions that they are challenging USCIS’ denial of H-1B petitions on \n6  behalf of themselves and all others who are similarly situated.”  Dkt. 51 at 11. \n7  Second, Defendants’ standing argument as to other H-1B petitioners is based in part on an \n8  overbroad reading of Plaintiffs’ proposed class definition.  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ \n9  “overly broad definition encompasses companies who have not even filed H-1B petitions.”  Id. at \n10  14.  This is not the case here, as employers do not become part of the proposed class until they file \n11  a petition and receive a denial based on a finding that the OOH entry for market research analyst \n12  does not establish that the occupation is a specialty occupation.  Dkt. 40 at 9.   Similarly, the Court \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  disagrees with Defendants’ argument that Plaintiffs’ proposed definition “sweeps in companies \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  who may file an H-1B petition but suffer no injury from the allegation Plaintiffs focus upon.”  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Dkt. 54 at 15.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ proposed class is ascertainable and Defendants’ standing \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  arguments fail. \nS d nr\nee 17  C.  Geographic Scope \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Defendants also contend that this Court should refuse to certify Plaintiffs’ proposed class \n19  because the definition is not limited in geographic scope.  The Supreme Court has cautioned that \n20  nationwide class actions “may have a detrimental effect by foreclosing adjudication by a number \n21  of different courts and judges.”  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 \n22  L.Ed.2d 176 (1979).  Accordingly, “a federal court when asked to certify a nationwide class \n23  should take care to ensure that nationwide relief is indeed appropriate in the case before it, and that \n24  certification of such a class would not improperly interfere with the litigation of similar issues in \n25  other judicial districts.”  Id.  However, the Supreme Court “decline[d] to adopt the extreme \n26  position that such a class may never be certified” and recognized that certification of a nationwide \n27  class “is committed in the first instance to the discretion of the district court.”  Id. at 702–03. \n28  Keeping the Supreme Court’s instructions in mind, the Court finds that certification of a \n10 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 11 of 17\n \n1  nationwide class is appropriate in this context.  Plaintiffs contend that “Defendant USCIS has a \n2  pattern and practice of misinterpreting the OOH’s profile of a market research analyst, mistakenly \n3  finding that it does not demonstrate that this occupation satisfies the first regulatory test.”  Dkt. 39 \n4  at 4.  In this context, “the practical consequences of not certifying a geographically limited class \n5  weigh in favor of nationwide certification.”  Garcia v. Johnson, No. 14-cv-01775-YGR, 2014 WL \n6  6657592, at *16 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2014).  Indeed, “courts have certified nationwide classes that \n7  challenge the government’s actions in enforcing the country’s immigration laws.”  Id. (citing cases \n8  where courts have certified nationwide classes challenging the government’s actions in enforcing \n9  immigration laws).  Thus, a nationwide class is appropriate here. \n10  D.  Rule 23(a) Requirements \n11  The Court next addresses whether Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 23(a)’s requirements of \n12  numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  1.  Numerosity \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Rule 23(a) requires each proposed class to be “so numerous that joinder of all members is \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  Plaintiffs need not state an exact number to meet the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  threshold requirements of Rule 23.  Rather, the rule “requires examination of the specific facts of \nS d nr\nee 17  each case and imposes no absolute limitations.” Gen. Tel. Co. v. Equal Emp’t Opportunity \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Comm'n, 446 U.S. 318, 330 (1980).  A class or subclass with more than forty members “raises a \n19  presumption of impracticability [of joinder] based on numbers alone.”  Hernandez v. Cnty. of \n20  Monterey, 305 F.R.D. 132, 152–53 (N.D. Cal. 2015).  Conversely, fewer than twenty proposed \n21  class members generally does not show impracticability of joinder. See Ehret v. Uber Techs., Inc., \n22  148 F. Supp. 3d 884, 890 (N.D. Cal. 2015). \n23  For proposed classes that fall into the “gray area” between twenty and forty class members, \n24  “courts must consider factors other than class size,” including: “(1) the judicial economy that will \n25  arise from avoiding multiple actions; (2) the geographic dispersion of members of the proposed \n26  class; (3) the financial resources of those members; (4) the ability of the members to file individual \n27  suits; and (5) requests for prospective relief that may have an effect on future class members.” \n28  Sandoval v. M1 Auto Collisions Centers, 309 F.R.D. 549, 562 (N.D. Cal. 2015).  The third and \n11 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 12 of 17\n \n1  fourth factors, which are often analyzed together, include consideration of “the economic status of \n2  the class members; the size of their claims; and other relevant factors, such as confinement and \n3  mental handicaps.”  Lil’ Man in Boat, Inc. v. City and Cty. of San Francisco, No. 17-cv-00904-\n4  JST, 2019 WL 125905, at *5 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (citing 32B Am. Jur. 2d Federal Courts § 1506).  \n5  “In analyzing these factors, a court may make common-sense assumptions and reasonable \n6  inferences.”  The Civil Rights Educ. & Enforcement Ctr. v. RLJ Lodging Trust, No. 15–cv–0224–\n7  YGR, 2016 WL 314400, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 25, 2016) (citations omitted). \n8  Here, Plaintiffs offer evidence that USCIS’ administrative appellate body, the \n9  Administrative Appeals Office (“AAO”) sustained USCIS’ denials of at least sixty H-1B petitions \n10  for market research analysts in the past three calendar years.  Dkt. 40 at 21 n.4.  Specifically, in \n11  each such year, AAO issued between seventeen and twenty-two such decisions, averaging twenty \n12  per year.  Id. at 21–22.  Plaintiffs also proffer that AAO has issued six denials in the first three \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  months of 2020.  Id. at 22–23.  Further, Plaintiffs contend that these numbers represent only a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  small fraction of denied cases and one USCIS spokesperson stated that only one percent of H-1B \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  denials are actually appealed to AAO.  Id. at 23–24.  Plaintiffs reasoned that these statistics \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  support a reasonable estimate that the number of current putative class members as of the filing of \nS d nr\nee 17  their motion for class certification in the class is at least forty members, and likely much higher.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Id. at 24.  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that joinder is impracticable here because it includes an \n19  unknown number of future class members.  Id. at 24–25.   \n20  As stated previously, the Court is closing the class on December 6, 2020, in light of the \n21  IFR which takes effect on December 7, 2020.  Even with the class being restricted from January 1, \n22  2019 through December 6, 2020, Plaintiffs’ statistics support a reasonable estimate that the \n23  number of putative class members would exceed forty members, given that the rough estimate of \n24  twenty decisions per year from the AAO represent only a fraction of actual denials.  In addition, \n25  the class is geographically dispersed, stretching across the nation.  For these reasons, the Court \n26  finds that the class satisfies Rule 23(a)(1).   \n27  2.  Commonality \n28  Rule 23(a) requires “questions of law or fact common to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 13 of 17\n \n1  23(a)(2).  To satisfy this requirement, a common question “must be of such a nature that it is \n2  capable of classwide resolution — which means that determination of its truth or falsity will \n3  resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.”  Wal-Mart, \n4  564 U.S. at 350.  “What matters to class certification is not the raising of common questions . . . \n5  but rather, the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the \n6  resolution of the litigation.  Id. (citation omitted).  “In other words, Plaintiffs must have a common \n7  question that will connect many individual [] decisions to their claim for class relief.”  Ellis, 657 \n8  F.3d at 981.   \n9  Commonality is satisfied where a plaintiff challenges a system-wide practice or policy that \n10  affects all putative class members.  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 868.  If there is no evidence that the \n11  entire class was subject to the same practice or policy, however, there is no question common to \n12  the class.  Ellis, 657 F.3d at 983.  Additionally, if a class action can only proceed to trial in the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  form of a myriad of mini-trials, class certification must be denied. See, e.g., Soares v. Flowers \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Foods, Inc., 320 F.R.D. 464, 484 (N.D. Cal. 2017). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The gravamen of Defendants’ opposition to the motion for class certification is that \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  commonality does not exist because USCIS considers the issue of whether an employer’s \nS d nr\nee 17  proffered position satisfies the first criteria of the H-1B specialty occupation requirement on a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  case-by-case basis based on the unique facts of the case and the specific evidence presented by the \n19  employer.  Dkt. 54 at 19–21.  In response, Plaintiffs argue that “individual differences in the \n20  underlying facts of each petition, such as the petitioner’s business, are not relevant to a \n21  determination of class membership.”  Dkt. 55 at 10.  The common question of whether Defendants \n22  have a pattern and practice of erroneously denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts \n23  based on its misapplication of the first regulatory test and misinterpretation of the statutory term \n24  “specific specialty” and the OOH profile for market research analysts is precisely what is at issue \n25  in Plaintiffs’ claims.  The Court agrees that the underlying facts of each petition is not relevant to a \n26  determination of class membership and “individual factual differences among the individual \n27  litigants or groups of litigants will not preclude a finding of commonality.”  Armstrong, 275 F.3d \n28  at 868.  “The existence of even one significant issue common to the class is sufficient to warrant \n13 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 14 of 17\n \n1  certification.”  Californians for Disability Rights, Inc. v. California Dep’t of Transp., 249 F.R.D. \n2  334, 346 (N.D. Cal. 2008).  Accordingly, the Court finds that the commonality requirement of \n3  Rule 23(a) has been met. \n4  3.  Typicality  \n5  To satisfy typicality, plaintiffs must establish that “the claims or defenses of the \n6  representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  \n7  “The purpose of the typicality requirement is to assure that the interest of the named representative \n8  aligns with the interests of the class.”  Wolin v. Jaguar Land Rover N. Am., LLC, 617 F.3d 1168, \n9  1175 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., 976 F.2d 497, 508 (9th Cir. 1992)). \n10  “The test of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the \n11  action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and whether other class \n12  members have been injured by the same course of conduct.”  Id. (quoting Hanon, 976 F.2d at \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  508). \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Typicality and commonality have similar requirements and often tend to merge.  See \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Californians for Disability Rights, 249 F.R.D. at 346.  As such, in citing to the same arguments \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  made regarding commonality, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail the typicality requirement.  \nS d nr\nee 17  Dkt. 54 at 21.  Further, Defendants again point out that Plaintiffs MadKudu, Quick Fitting, and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2nd Street have approved H-1B petitions and thus do not have the same or similar injury as the \n19  putative class members.  Id.   \n20  As the Court explained above, however, Plaintiffs are challenging the lawfulness of \n21  Defendants’ pattern and practice of erroneously denying H-1B petitions for market research \n22  analysts.  The named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the class because their H-1B \n23  petitions were allegedly denied because of Defendants’ unlawful policy and practice of \n24  misinterpreting the statutory term “specific specialty” and the first regulatory test and an erroneous \n25  reading of the OOH profile for market research analysts.  Dkt. 40 at 28–29.  Accordingly, the \n26  Court finds that the typicality requirement has been met. \n27  4.  Adequacy  \n28  To satisfy Rule 23(a)(4), Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they will “fairly and adequately \n14 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 15 of 17\n \n1  protect the interests of the class.”  When considering the adequacy of proposed class \n2  representatives, courts must examine “the qualifications of counsel for the representatives, an \n3  absence of antagonism, a sharing of interests between representatives and absentees, and the \n4  unlikelihood that the suit is collusive.”  Crawford v. Honig, 37 F.3d 485, 487 (9th Cir. 1995) \n5  (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court has “repeatedly held that a class representative must be a \n6  part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members.”  \n7  Gen. Tel. Co., 457 U.S. at 156 (citations omitted).  However, “[a]s a general rule, disapproval of \n8  the action by some class members should not be sufficient to preclude a class action on the ground \n9  of inadequate representation.”  Californians for Disability Rights, 249 F.R.D. at 348 (quoting 1 \n10  Newberg on Class Actions § 3:30). \n11  Defendants again contend that some of the named Plaintiffs lack standing and that \n12  Hanguang International  “has provided no evidence as to how its interest and proffered position in \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  the niche of educational consulting will be adequate to set a nationwide standard for all H-1B \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  petitioning companies.”  Dkt. 54 at 22.  The Court has sufficiently addressed the standing issue \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  previously.  Further, the fact that Hanguang International is in the business of educational \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  consulting is not relevant for the purposes of class representation.  Named Plaintiffs’ interest in \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants properly applying the statutory term “specific specialty” and the first regulatory test as \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  well as the OOH’s explanation of the market research analyst position are aligned with the \n19  interests of the class because they face the same injury — denial of their H-1B petition for a \n20  market research analyst position.  See Dkt. 40 at 29.  Further, Plaintiffs have stated that they will \n21  fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed class and that they do not have any \n22  conflicts of interest.  Id.   \n23  Finally, the Court determines Plaintiffs’ attorneys are experienced class action attorneys \n24  and are adequate class counsel.  Defendants do not challenge the adequacy of plaintiffs' counsel to \n25  serve as class counsel. \n26  “Adequate representation is usually presumed in the absence of contrary evidence.”  \n27  Californians for Disability Rights, 249 F.R.D. at 349 (citation omitted).  Defendants have not \n28  adequately rebut this presumption and thus, the Court finds that the adequacy of representation \n15 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 16 of 17\n \n1  requirement is met. \n2  5.  Conclusion \n3  In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied the numerosity, commonality, \n4  typicality, and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a).  The Court also finds that class counsel is \n5  adequate. \n6  E.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \n7  Class actions must also satisfy one of three enumerated categories.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8  23(b)(1)-(3).  Here, Plaintiffs seek to certify under Rule 23(b)(2).  A class may be certified under \n9  Rule 23(b)(2) if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on the grounds that apply \n10  generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \n11  appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “Class certification under \n12  Rule 23(b)(2) requires that the primary relief sought is declaratory or injunctive.”  Rodriguez, 591 \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  F.3d at 1125 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Rule 23(b)(2) only requires the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Court “to look at whether class members seek uniform relief from a practice applicable to all of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  them.”  Id.   \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Here, Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied.  Plaintiffs challenge Defendants’ pattern and practice of \nS d nr\nee 17  denying H-1B petitions for market research analysts based on a misinterpretation of the OOH and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  misinterpretation and misapplication of 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § \n19  214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1).  Defendants contend that “there is no single declaratory relief that could \n20  apply to each H-1B petitioner who deals in a distinct and different ‘market’ for the purposes of the \n21  diverse putative class.”  However, again, the various markets that the employers may be in is \n22  irrelevant for these purposes.  The challenged conduct applies generally to the whole class and \n23  declaratory relief and final injunctive relief enjoining Defendants from continuing this alleged \n24  pattern and practice is applicable to the class as a whole.  Dkt. 54 at 23.  Accordingly, the Court \n25  finds that Plaintiffs have met the requirements of Rule 23(b). \n26  V.  CONCLUSION \n27  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART Plaintiffs’ motion for class \n28  certification and CERTIFIES the following class:  \n16 \n\nCase 5:20-cv-02653-SVK   Document 59   Filed 11/17/20   Page 17 of 17\n \n1   \nAll U.S. employers who in 2019 through December 6, 2020 filed, or \n2  will file, a petition (Form I-129 or any successor) with USCIS for an \nH-1B  classification  under  8  U.S.C.  §  1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b)  for  a \n3  market research analyst where: \n•  USCIS denied or will deny the petition solely or in part based \n4  on a finding that the OOH entry for market research analyst \ndoes  not  establish  that  the  occupation  is  a  specialty \n5  occupation,  and  thus  does  not  satisfy  8  C.F.R.  § \n214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(1); and \n6  •  But for this finding, the petition would be approved. \n7  The Court APPOINTS Plaintiffs MadKudu, Quick Fitting, 2nd Street, and Hanguang \n8  International as class representatives.  The Court APPOINTS American Immigration Council, Van \n9  Der Hout, LLP, American Immigration Lawyers Association, Joseph and Hall, P.C., and Kuck \n10  Baxter Immigration LLC as class counsel.  \n11  The Court ORDERS the Parties to meet and confer on whether cross motions for summary \n12  judgment are appropriate and if so, a schedule for same to be filed by January 15, 2021.  If the \n \na\ntr in\nuoro 13  Parties cannot agree, they are to submit competing case management proposals to the Court by \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  January 15, 2021. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  SO ORDERED. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Dated: November 17, 2020 \nS d nr\nee 17   \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18     \nSUSAN VAN KEULEN \n19 \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n17 ",
