    "summary": "<p>This class action lawsuit challenged New York's practice of rejecting people who apply to be foster parents to relatives because of past convictions or only charges under state, federal, and city rules.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint was filed on November 10, 2021 in the Eastern District of New York and assigned to Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall. The named plaintiffs were children who had been involuntarily removed from their parents or guardians by the New York City Administration for Children's Service (ACS) and who had been denied or were at risk of being denied a foster or adoptive placement with a family member as a result of the caregiver's criminal history or previous report of child abuse or neglect. ACS removes thousands of children from the care of their parents or guardians due to neglect or abuse. These children are then placed in ACS legal custody until the agency can place them with foster family. A disproportionate number of the children removed from their family homes are poor and people of color. Children often adjust better if they are placed with family members, otherwise known as Kin Caregivers.</p>\r\n<p>However, current state, city, and federal rules bar categorically certain Kin Caregivers from applying to be foster or adoptive guardians. Under New York Social Services Law &sect;&nbsp;378-a(2)(e)(1), a Kin Caregiver is subject to mandatory disqualification if they have committed a disqualifying crime. There are almost 300 felonies under the New York penal code that mandate lifetime mandatory disqualification, including some attempted felonies. 40 other felonies require a five-year disqualification. Consequently, ACS will deny a child's placement with a Kin Caregiver even if the conviction is years old. No individualized assessment is provided. Additionally, under New York Social Services Law &sect; 378-a(2)(e)(3), a child may also be denied a placement with a Kin Caregiver if the Kin Caregiver or any other adult household member was previously charged or convicted for any crime. As with the mandatory disqualification, no individualized disqualification is provided. Additionally, ACS may also deny a child a Kin Caregiver placement if that person or any adult household member was ever subject to an \"indicated report\" in the New York State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment. The standard for an indicating report is low; a report may be filed on the basis of \"some credible evidence.\" Even when a report is indicated, ACS is not required to take any action; the matter may never be filed with Family Court. Again, denial is not subject to individualized review. As a result of these rules, plaintiffs allege that many children are denied foster or adoptive homes with Kin Caregivers.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, Plaintiffs asserted that the Defendants' actions are in violation of the Plaintiff class's substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, including the right to family association and integrity, the right to be free from unnecessary intrusions into the child's emotional well-being, and the right not to be placed in government custody longer than is necessary. Additionally, Plaintiffs asserted that the Defendants' actions deprived the Plaintiff class of these rights without offering the Plaintiff class notice or adequate opportunity to be heard. Consequently, the Plaintiff class has been and is at risk of being deprived of procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief in the form of a declaration that New York Social Services Law &sect;&nbsp;378-a(2)(e)(1) and 18 N.Y.C.R.R. &sect;&sect; 443.2(b); 443.8(e); 421.16(n) are unconstitutional and unlawful and that Defendants were violating the Plaintiff Class's substantive and procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Plaintiffs also sought a permanent injunction requiring Defendants to create and implement guidance and oversight over the foster and adoptive approval process to ensure that a child's Kin Caregiver is being properly evaluated if that person or a household member has a criminal or SCR record and that the Plaintiff class has notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond to any denial of their foster or adoptive placement with a Kin Caregiver on the ground of the Kin Caregiver or other adult household member's criminal history or SCR record.</p>\r\n<p>The case remains open.</p>",
    "summary_published_date": "2022-03-03T12:17:02.845165-05:00",
    "summary_short": "In this class action suit, plaintiffs sued the Governor of New York, the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services, and the City of New York. The Plaintiff class were children who had been removed from their parent's or guardian's homes and had been or were at risk of being denied foster or adoptive placements with family members due to mandatory and discretionary disqualification  rules. Under New York Social Services Law, Kin Caregivers who have been convicted of certain crimes are categorically disqualified from being foster or adoptive parents. Additionally, a child may be denied as a matter of discretion a placement with a Kin Caregiver if that person or another adult household member has been charged or convicted of any crime. Finally, a child may be denied a placement with a Kin Caregiver if that person or any adult household member has ever been the subject of an \"indicated report\" in the New York State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment. Individualized review is not available for any of these determinations to deny a child a placement with a Kin Caregiver. As a result of these policies, the Plaintiff class alleges that many children have been and are at risk of being denied placements with extended family members. In their complaint, Plaintiffs asserted that the State and City laws violated the Plaintiff class's substantive due process rights to family association and integrity, freedom from unnecessary intrusion into children's well-being, and the right not to be placed in government custody any longer than is necessary. Additionally, Plaintiffs alleged that their rights to procedural due process were also being violated because there is no notice or opportunity to be heard regarding the denial of placement with a Kin Caregiver. \r\n\r\nAs of November 27, 2021, no judge is yet assigned to the case. \r\nThe case remains open.",

POOLE,  in  her official  capacity  as \nCommissioner  of the  New  York  State  Office  of  * \nChildren  and  Family  Services;  and  CITY  OF \nNEW  YORK, \nDefendants. \n-X \n  \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  In  2020,  the  New  York  City  Administration  for  Childrenโs  Services  removed  six \nyear  old  C.P.  from  the  care  of  his  mother.  His  uncle,  with  whom  C.P.  had  always  had  a  close \nrelationship  and  who  was  eager  to  maintain  C.P.โs  connections  to  his  extended  family  during  this \ntraumatic  time,  came  forward  and  sought  certification  as  a  foster  parent  in  order to  care  for C.P. \nHowever,  the  Administration  for Childrenโs  Services,  in  reliance  upon  a  grossly  deficient  system \nfor evaluating  family  members  as  foster  or  adoptive  parents,  denied  C.P.โs  uncle  certification  as\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  2  of  74  PagelD  #:  2 \na  foster  parent  due  to  a  prior  misdemeanor conviction  for  Driving  under  the  Influence.  As  a \nresult,  C.P.  has  been  deprived  of his  uncleโs  loving  home  and  continued  connection  to  his  family \nand  is  instead  in  foster care  with  a  stranger. \n2.  C.P.  is just  one  of the  Named  Plaintiffs  in  this  civil  rights  class  action  brought  by \nfourteen  children  involuntarily  removed  from  their parents  by  New  York  Cityโs  child  welfare \nagency  (the  โNamed  Plaintiffsโ),  challenging  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  laws,  policies  and \npractices  that  deprive  them,  and  hundreds  of  similarly  situated  children,  of foster care  and \nadoptive  placement  with  family  members. \n3.  Defendants  have  created  a  certification  system  that  unconstitutionally  and \nroutinely  denies  members  of  the  Plaintiff Class  (as  defined  below  in  paragraph  18)  placement  in \nfamiliar,  safe  and  loving  foster  and  adoptive  homes  of family  members  solely  based  on  their \nrelativesโ  past.  These  denials  have  grim  consequences:  children  who  could  have  been  placed  with \nfamily  are  thrust  into  stranger  foster  care  or  institutional  group  care,  or  are  deprived  of necessary \nservices  and  support.  This  practice  only  serves  to  magnify  the  trauma  of parental  removal \nchildren  experience  in  foster  care  and  leaves  children  unnecessarily  vulnerable. \n4.  Every  year,  the  Administration  for Childrenโs  Services  removes  thousands  of \nNew  York City  children  from  their parents  or guardians  pursuant  to  Article  10  of the  Family \nCourt  Act  due  to  allegations  of abuse  or  neglect.  These  children  are  placed  into  the  legal  custody \nof the  Administration  for Childrenโs  Services,  which  contracts  with  28  foster care  provider \nagencies  (collectively,  โACSโ),  and  is  overseen  by  New  York  Stateโs  Office  of Children  and \nFamily  Services  (โOCFSโ).  A  disproportionate  number  of  these  children  come  from  homes  of \npoor  and  marginalized  families  of color.\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  3  of  74  PagelD  #:  3 \n5.  Not  surprisingly,  children  often  experience  being  removed  from  their  parents  by \nACS  as  traumatizing;  they  are  removed  from  familiar  surroundings  and  lose  everything  known \nand  comforting  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time.  For  some,  this  loss  is  permanent,  as  many  of \nthese  children  grow  up  in  foster  care  until  they  are  too  old  to  remain  in  care  (โage  outโ).  ACS \nmay  place  children  it  removes  in  a  shelter,  a  strangerโs  foster  home,  a group  home  or  other \ncongregate  care  setting,  or  in  some  circumstances,  a  relativeโs  home. \n6.  The  ultimate  goal  of  the  foster care  system,  once  it  has  removed  children  from \ntheir  parents,  is  either  to  reunify  children  with  their  parents  or,  if  that  is  not  possible,  to  find  a \npermanent  home  for  the  child.  According  to  OCFS,  โ[t]he  overarching  goal  for  each  child  in \n[foster]  care  is  to  identify  safe  and  suitable  permanency  options  ...  within  the  context  of safety \nand  the  childโs  best  interests.โ  Such  permanency  may  be  accomplished  through  return  to  parent, \nadoption  or guardianship. \n7.  In  general,  children  are  better  able  to  cope  with  the  massive  disruption  of  removal \nfrom  their  homes  when  they  are  placed  with  a  family  member  (a  โKin  Caregiverโ).  The  reason  is \nobvious:  a  placement  in  a  familiar,  loving  environment  provides  comfort  and  continuity  at  a  time \nwhen  these  children  are  most  vulnerable.  Placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  can  minimize  the \ntrauma of removal  and  provide  the  child  with  a  much-needed  sense  of security  and  comfort. \n8.  As  discussed  below,  social  science  data  confirms  that  children  placed  with  Kin \nCaregivers  generally  fare  better  than  children  placed  with  strangers.  As  reported  in  ACSโs \nInteragency  Foster Care  Taskforce  report,  children  placed  with  Kin  Caregivers  are  better  able  to \npreserve community  and  family  ties,  have  reduced  trauma  and  higher  rates  of behavioral  and \nemotional  well-being,  are  more  likely  to  achieve  permanency  though  reunification,  adoption  or \nguardianship  and  are  less  likely  to  re-enter  foster  care.\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  4  of  74  PagelD  #:  4 \n9.  New  Yorkโs  child  welfare  system  recognizes  the  value  of placing  children  with \nKin  Caregivers.  When  ACS  decides  to  remove  a  child  from  the  home,  the  Social  Services  Law, \nFamily  Court  Act  and  OCFS  regulations  require  ACS  to  identify  and  notify  relatives  of the \nchildโs  removal  and  consider  their  ability  to  care  for  the  child.  New  York  has  also  created \nprograms  designed  to  increase  permanent  care  options  for  children  with  Kin  Caregivers,  such  as \nthe  Kinship  Guardianship  Assistance  Program  (โKinGAPโโโ),  a  subsidized  guardianship  program \nthat  aims  to  facilitate  the  permanent  placement  of  foster children  with  Kin  Caregivers. \n10.  Despite  the  recognition  that  children  removed  from  their parents  generally  do  best \nwhen  placed  with  a  Kin  Caregiver,  only  42%  of New  York  City  children  currently  in  foster  care \nare  in  kin  care  placements.'  That  failure  is  due,  in  significant  part,  to  three  unconstitutional \ndisqualification  systems  which  deny  children  foster care  and  adoptive  placements  with  Kin \nCaregivers  based  on  their  family  memberโs  past,  rather  than  on  their current  ability  to  care  for \ntheir  relative  children.  These  three  disqualification  systems,  which  encompass  both  provisions  of \nNY  Social  Services  Law  ยง  378-a  and  the  Defendantsโ  regulations,  policies  and  practices,  are \nreferred  to  collectively  as  the  โDisqualification  Systems.โ \n11.  The  Mandatory Disqualification  System.  New  York  Social  Services  Law  ยง  378- \na(2)(e)(1)  deprives  children  in  foster  care  of  placement  in  a  potential  foster  or  adoptive  home \nwith  a  Kin  Caregiver  if the  Kin  Caregiver  has  a  mandatory  disqualifying  conviction.  Rather  than \nconduct  an  individualized  assessment  of  whether  the  placement  is  safe,  this  law  mandates  the \ndenial  of the  Kin  Caregiverโs  application  to  be  a  childโs  foster  or  adoptive  parent  if the  Kin \nCaregiver  has  ever  been  convicted  of certain  felony  crimes.  There  are  nearly  300  felonies  in  the \nNew  York Penal  Law  that  require  /ifetime  mandatory  disqualification,  including  certain \n  \nโTt  is  unclear  how  many  of these  placements  are  foster care  placements  as  opposed  to an  unsupported direct \nplacement,  as described  more  fully below. \n4\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  5of  74  PagelD  #:  5 \nโattemptedโ  felonies.  There  are  approximately  40  other  felonies  that  require  a  five  year \nmandatory  disqualification,  including  certain  drug  possession  offenses.  As  a  result,  a  child  will \nbe  denied  foster  or  adoptive  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver even  where  a  conviction  mandating \ndisqualification  is  decades  old,  even  where  the  child  has  a  loving,  long  term  relationship  with  the \nKin  Caregiver,  and  even  where  the  Kin  Caregiver  has  been  fully  rehabilitated  and  maintains  a \nsafe  home.  The  Kin  Caregiver  could  be  the  mother of the  president  of the  United  States  but \nnonetheless  would  be  ineligible  to  serve  as  a  foster  or  adoptive  parent  if  she  has  a  mandatorily \ndisqualifying  conviction. \n12.  The  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System.  Under New  York \nSocial  Services  Law  ยง  378-a(2)(e)(3),  a  child  may  also  be  denied  foster or  adoptive  placement \nwith  a  Kin  Caregiver  if the  criminal  history  record  of the  Kin  Caregiver,  or any  household \nmember  over  18,  reveals  a  charge  (even  if the  charge  resulted  in  no  conviction)  or  a  conviction \nfor any  crime  at  any  point  in  the  past.  Both  OCFS  and  ACS  provide  inadequate  guidance  and \noversight  to  ensure  ACS  decision  makers  are  appropriately  evaluating  and  considering  a  childโs \nKin  Caregiver  who  has  a  discretionary  disqualifying  conviction.  As  a result,  ACS  is  routinely \ndenying  children  foster care  or  adoptive  placements  with  potential  Kin  Caregivers  based  upon \nthe  mere  fact  that  the  Kin  Caregiver  or  adult  household  member  has  a  criminal  charge  or \nconviction,  without  an  individualized  assessment  of whether placement  in  a  foster  or  adoptive \nhome  with  the  Kin  Caregiver  is  safe.  Compounding  this  violation,  these  children  are  then  denied \nnotice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge  the  denial  of  foster care  or  adoptive  placement  with  their \nrelative. \n13.  The  SCR  Disqualification  System.  Defendants  may  also  deny  a  child  placement \nwith  a  Kin  Caregiver  if the  kin  or  any  household  member over  18  was  ever  the  subject  of an\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  6  of  74  PagelD  #:  6 \nโindicated  reportโ  in  the  New  York  State  Central  Register  of Child  Abuse  and  Maltreatment  (the \nโSCRโ).  The  SCR  is  a  registry  of persons  who  have  been  investigated  for child  abuse  or  neglect. \nOCFS  maintains  the  SCR,  and  SCR  investigations  are  carried  out  by  local  district  social  services, \nsuch  as  ACS,  acting  under  OCFS  supervision.  The  standard  for  โindicatingโ  a report  is  very  low \nโ  โsome credible evidenceโ  is  all  that  is  required  to  indicate  a  report.  And  when  ACS  indicates \na  report,  it  is  not  required  to  take  any  action  at  all.  The  case  may  never be  filed  in  Family  Court \nand  the  family  may  never hear  from  ACS  again.  Thus,  in  and  of itself,  an  indicated  SCR  record \nis  not  a  reliable  basis  on  which  to  determine  that  a  Kin  Caregiver  actually  committed  child  abuse \nor neglect,  or that  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  home  is  not  safe  for the  child. \n14.  Both  OCFS  and  ACS  provide  inadequate  guidance  and  oversight  to  ensure  that \nACS  is  appropriately  evaluating  and  considering  a  childโs  Kin  Caregiver  with  an  SCR  record.  As \na  result,  Defendants  are  routinely  denying  children  foster care  or  adoptive  placements  with \npotential  Kin  Caregivers  based  upon  the  mere  fact  that  the  Kin  Caregiver  or  adult  household \nmember  has  an  SCR  record,  without  an  individualized  assessment  of  whether  placement  in  a \nfoster  or  adoptive  home  with  the  Kin  Caregiver  is  safe.  Compounding  this  violation,  these \nchildren  are  then  denied  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge  the  denial  of  foster care  or \nadoptive  placement  with  their  relative. \n15.  Once  a  child  is  denied  foster  care  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  as  a result  of \nDefendantsโ  Disqualification  Systems,  the  child  is  at  risk  of being  placed  with  a  stranger or  ina \ngroup  care  setting  far  away  from  their  home  community.  The decision  to  place  a  child  in  stranger \nfoster  care  can  have  a  host  of negative  consequences  for  the  child.  Children  who  spend  time  in \nstranger  foster  care  have  poorer  school  performance  and  are  more  susceptible  to  homelessness, \narrest,  chemical  dependency,  and  mental  and  physical  illness  than  children  who  remain  with  their\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  7  of  74  PagelD  #:  7 \nfamilies.  Likewise,  when  a child  is  denied  an  adoptive  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver,  the  child \nis  at  risk  of  being  forever  severed  from  their  family  through  stranger  adoption  or  โaging  outโ  of \nthe  foster care  system  without  achieving  permanency. \n16.  โ  The  fact  that  Defendantsโ  Disqualification  Systems  are  not  premised  on  actual \ndeterminations  that  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  home  is  unsafe  or  that  placement  with  the  Kin  Caregiver \nis  not  in  the  best  interest  of the  child  is  made  apparent  by  ACSโs  practice  of permitting  many \nchildren  to  be  placed  with  disqualified  Kin  Caregivers  as  a  โdirect  placement.โ  A  direct \nplacement  is  not  a  long-term  option  and  requires  the  family  to  forgo  the  services  and  support  that \ncome  with  being  a  certified  foster  parent  or  adoptive  parent  (collectively,  โChildcare  Services \nand  Supportsโ). \n17.  Because  the  majority  of children  removed  from  their  parents  by  ACS  come  from \nfamilies  who  live  at  or  near poverty  level,  a direct  placement  without  Childcare  Services  and \nSupports  deprives  the  child  of many  of the  benefits  that  come  with  a  certified  foster  home  and \nputs  their  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  at  risk  of disruption. \n18.  The  Named  Plaintiffs  bring  this  civil  rights  action  on  behalf of  themselves  and  a \nputative  class  of  all  children  in  New  York  City  who  have  been,  or  will  be,  removed  from  their \nparents  by  ACS  pursuant  to  Article  10  of the  Family  Court  Act,  and  who  have  been  denied,  or \nare  at  risk  of being  denied,  a  foster  or  adoptive  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver based  on  the  Kin \nCaregiverโs  or  adult  household  memberโs  criminal  history  record  or  SCR  record  (collectively, \nthe  โPlaintiff Classโ). \n19.  The  actions  and  inactions  of Defendants  constitute  a policy,  pattern,  custom  and \npractice  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  exercise  of accepted  professional judgment  and  amount  to \ndeliberate  indifference  to  the  constitutionally  protected  liberty  interests  of the  Plaintiff Class.  As\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  8  of  74  PagelD  #:  8 \na  result,  the  Plaintiff Class  has  been,  and  are  at  risk  of being,  deprived  of substantive  due  process \nrights  conferred  upon  them  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution, \nincluding  the  right  to  family  association  and  integrity,  the  right  to  be  free  from  unnecessary \nintrusions  into  the  childโs  emotional  well-being,  and  the  right  not  to  be  maintained  in \ngovernment  custody  longer  than  is  necessary. \n20.  The  actions  and  inactions  of Defendants  also  deprive  the  Plaintiff Class  of  their \nconstitutionally  protected  liberty  interests  without  offering  the  Plaintiff Class  notice  or  an \nadequate  opportunity  to  be  heard.  As  a  result,  the  Plaintiff Class  has  been,  and  is,  at  risk  of being \ndeprived  of procedural  due  process  rights  conferred  upon  them  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to \nthe  United  States  Constitution. \n21.  The  Named  Plaintiffs  seek  a  declaration  that  Defendantsโ  Disqualification \nSystems  violate  the  constitutional  rights  of the  Plaintiff Class,  and  seek  class  wide  injunctive \nrelief compelling  the  Defendants  to  remedy  these  unconstitutional  practices. \nPARTIES \nTHE NAMED PLAINTIFF  CHILDREN \nNamed  Plaintiff B.B. \n22.  | ACS  removed  three  month  old  B.B.  from  his  motherโs  care  in  February  2018. \nImmediately  after  removal,  B.B.  was  released  to  his  maternal  great  grandparents,  Mr.  and  Mrs. \nR.,  in  Queens,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  B.B.โs  mother  lived  with  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  when  B.B.  was  born \nbut  later  left  the  house.  When  a  finding  of neglect  was  made  against  B.B.โs  mother  in  September \n2019,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  requested  to  be  certified  foster  parents  for  B.B.  When  ACS  asked  Mrs.  R. \nif she  would  be  interested  in  becoming  a  foster  parent,  she  replied  โwith  all  [my]  heart.โ \n23.  At  3  years  old,  B.B.  has  now  gained  weight  and  is  growing  appropriately.  ACS \nreported  that  he  is  โhappy  and  comfortableโ  with  his  great  grandparents.  He  has  bonded  with  Mr. \n8\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  9  of  74  PagelD  #:  9 \nand  Mrs.  R.  and  they  are  โplayful  and  affectionateโ  with  each  other.  B.B.  is  โhappy  and  alertโ  in \nMr.  and  Mrs.  R.โs  care.  According  to  ACS,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  continue  to  provide  a  โloving  long \nterm  home  for  him.โ \n24.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  have  been  a  big  part  of B.B.โs  life  since  he  was  born,  even  saving \nhis  life  once.  When  B.B.  was  two  months  old,  his  body  went  limp  and  his  lips  turned  purple.  Mr. \nand  Mrs.  R.  performed  lifesaving  CPR  and  B.B.  was  brought  to  a  hospital.  He  was  diagnosed \nwith  chronic  lung  disease  and  asthma  and  remained  hospitalized.  In  addition  to  the  chronic  lung \ndisease,  B.B.  has  also  been  diagnosed  with  Autism.  He  needs  extra  care  and  support  and  has  an \nIndividualized  Education  Plan  to  access  services  at  school.  B.B.โs  family  is  a  great  resource \ngiven  their experience  dealing  with  B.B.โs  uncle,  who  also  has  Autism.  The  family  is  patient  and \nconstantly  engages  with  B.B.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R even  help  him  with  his  online  learning.  While  B.B. \ndoes  not  speak  yet,  he  has  learned  some  sign  language  in  order  to  communicate  with  his  family. \n25.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  live  close  to  B.B.โs  family  and  friends.  B.B.  is  able  to  visit \nregularly  with  his  Aunt  and  his  cousins.  B.B.  also  spends  a  lot  of time  with  his  teenage  uncle \nwho  also  lives  with  him.  B.B.  loves  to  play  with  his  uncle,  doing  puzzles  together  or  having  his \nuncle  read  to  him. \n26.  Despite  a  finding  of neglect  against  B.B.โs  mom  and  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.โs  eagerness \nto  be certified  foster parents,  ACS  did  not  take  action  to  certify  the  home  until  December  2019 \nafter  urging  from  B.Bโs  attorney.  After being  placed  with  his  great  grandparents  for  nearly  two \nyears,  ACS  started  the  process  of certification. \n27.  In  April  2020,  ACS  informed  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R  that  due  to  a  25  year  old  conviction \nthey  could  not  be  foster parents  for  B.B.  ACS  informed  the  family  that  B.B  would  be  removed\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  10  of  74  PagelD  #:  10 \nfrom  the  home  in  June  2020  despite,  as  ACS  stated,  the  family  meeting  all  of B.B.โs  โmedical, \nemotional,  and  physical  needs.โ \n28.  In  1995,  Mr.  R.  was  convicted  of Attempted  Burglary  2nd  degree,  a  mandatory \ndisqualifying  offense.  Mr.  Rโs  offense  was  a  youthful  aberration  in  an  otherwise  overwhelmingly \nlaw-abiding  life.  Since  1995,  Mr.  R.  has  successfully  raised  five  children  of his  own  and  has  had \nno  further  criminal  history. \n29.  Prior  to  the  law  mandating  disqualification  for certain  convictions,  Mr.  and  Mrs. \nR.  successfully  adopted  two  of  their grandchildren.  Now  they  cannot  be  a  foster parent  for  their \ngreat  grandchild,  and  B.B.  must  pay  the  consequences  for  a  mistake  his  great  grandfather  made \nalmost  three  decades  ago. \n30.  When  the  family  was  told  about  the  denial,  there  were  โa  lot  of tears.โ  Mr.  and \nMrs.  R  had  worked  hard  to  provide  a  loving  home  for B.B.  Mrs.  R.  had  even  lost  significant \nweight  so  that  she  would  be  physically  able  to  care  for  the  toddler.  If B.B.  was  removed  from \ntheir  home,  he  would  be  placed  into  stranger  foster care  and  lose  his  daily  connection  with  his \nloving  family.  A  move  from  his  great  grandparentsโ  home  would  only  put  B.B.  at  risk  of further \ntrauma  from  the  family  separation. \n31.  Because  of Mr.  R.โs  mandatory  disqualifying  conviction,  there  is  no  process  for \nB.B.  or  his  Kin  Caregivers  to  challenge  ACSโs  decision  to  deny  foster parent  certification. \nEffectively  acknowledging  that  placement  with  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R  was  both  safe  and  best  for B.B., \nACS  decided  to  directly  place  B.B.  with  his  great  grandparents.  However,  in  doing  so,  ACS  has \ndenied  B.B.  and  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  the  Childcare  Services  and  Supports  they  so  desperately  need. \n32.  โ_B.B.  requires  a  lot  of support.  He  is  low  functioning  and  non-verbal.  At  times,  he \nself-harms  and  can  be  aggressive.  As  a  result,  Mrs.  R  frequently  relaxes  B.B.  with  a  massager. \n10\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  11  of  74  PagelD  #:  11 \nShe  also  administers  the  many  medications  B.B.  takes  for  his  chronic  lung  disease  and  takes  B.B. \nto  all  his  doctorsโ  appointments. \n33.  |The COVID-19  pandemic  has  been  particularly  hard  on  the  family.  B.B.  has  had \nto  attend  pre-school  remotely  half the  time.  Remote  pre-school  is  particularly  challenging  given \nB.B.โs  special  needs.  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  do  everything  they  can  to  support  B.B.โs  online  learning. \nThe  family  even  rearranged  the  living  room  by  turning  half of it  into  a  classroom  with  a  table  and \nchairs.  Mrs.  R.  saved  some  school  supplies  from  her  children  that  B.B.  is  able  to  use. \n34.  The  family  has  lost  seven  close  family  members  and  friends  due  to  the  COVID-19 \npandemic,  which  Mrs.  R  said  has  been  โvery  hard.โ  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  have  tried  to  remain  strong \nfor B.B.  during  this  difficult  time,  but  the  significant  loss  and  financial  strain  has  taken  a  toll  on \nthe  family. \n35.  Moreover,  Mr.  R.  has  end  stage  renal  failure  and  is  on  dialysis.  He  has  had  to \nhave  surgeries  to  address  his  condition.  During  one  of  his  last  surgeries,  Mr.  R.  went  into  a  coma \nand  was  on  life  support  for  3  days,  leaving  the  family  worried,  and  Mrs.  R  unable  to  sleep  for  3 \ndays. \n36.  Despite  their  hardship,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R  would  love  to  provide  further  stability  and \nexpress  their  love  for  B.B.  through  adoption.  However,  based  on  the  statute,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  R.  are \nnot  eligible  to  be  approved  as  adoptive  parents  due  to  the  same  mandatory  disqualifying \nconviction  that  barred  them  from  foster  parent  certification. \n37.  |  The  family  desperately  needs  Childcare  Support  and  Services.  The  family  is  on  a \nfixed  income  and  at  times  has  been  short  on  their  monthly  bills.  If B.B.  was  placed  with  Mr.  and \nMrs.  R  as  acertified  foster  home,  the  family  would  likely  receive  increased  foster care \nmaintenance  payments  due  to  B.B.โs  heightened  needs.  Although  the  family  wants  to  stay \n11\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  12  of  74  PagelD  #:  12 \ntogether,  without  foster  care  funding  and  services,  it  is  increasingly  difficult  to  manage  the  needs \nof B.B. \n38.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiff B.B.  appears  by  his  next  friend,  Joy  Rosenthal.  Ms.  Rosenthal  is  familiar  with  the  issues \nregarding  B.B.โs  time  under  ACS  custody  and  supervision.  Ms.  Rosenthal  is  an  Adjunct \nProfessor  at  City  University  of New  York  School  of  Law  and  has  represented  children  and \nfamilies  in  New  York  City  for over  twenty  years.  Ms.  Rosenthal  is  well  suited  to  represent  B.B.โs \nbest  interests  in  this  case. \nNamed  Plaintiff  T.R. \n39.  T.R.  entered  foster care  in  January  2021,  when  he  was  10  months  old.  After  being \nremoved  from  his  biological  parents  in  Harlem,  T.R.  was  placed  in  a  youth  reception  center  for \nfour  days,  and  was  then  moved  to  a  stranger  foster  home. \n40.  At  the  time  of his  removal,  T.R.โs  biological  mother  suggested  T.R.โs  maternal \ngrandmother  and  uncle,  Ms.  K.  and  Mr.  K.,  who  reside  together  in  Ms.  K.โs  home,  as  resources \nfor T.R.  Mr.  K.โs  3-year-old  son,  who  is  in  Mr.  Kโs  sole  custody,  also  resides  in  the  home. \n41.  Ms.  K.  immediately  expressed  eagerness  to  care  for  T.R., just  as  she  had \npreviously  done  for  three  of her  other  grandchildren  โ  T.R.โs  half siblings,  J.K.,  J.K.,  and  M.S. \nAs  a  devoted  grandmother,  Ms.  K.  has  desperately  wanted  to  avoid  seeing  her grandchildren \nplaced  in  stranger  foster  care.  In  June  2017,  ACS  placed  T.R.โs  three  half  siblings  with  Ms.  K. \nuntil  February,  2018,  when  they  were  ultimately  released  to  their biological  father.  The  children \nreportedly  adjusted  well  to  Ms.  K.โs  home  and  were  well-cared  for  throughout.  ACS  reported  no \nsafety  concerns  for  the  children  while  they  were  living  with  Ms.  K. \n12\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  13  of  74  PagelD  #:  13 \n42.  Despite  her  similar desire  to  care  for  T.R.,  in  January  2021,  ACS  reported  that \nthey  would  not  certify  Ms.  K.  as  foster parent  for T.R.  due  to  her past  SCR  history,  and  three \nDomestic  Incident  Reports  (โDIRโ).  Ms.  K.โs  only  indicated  SCR  case  is  from  twenty  years  ago. \nThis  2001  SCR  incident  did  not  result  in  any  Family  Court  filing,  nor  was  Ms.  K.  referred  for \nservices  based  on  the  allegations.  Similarly,  the  three  DIRs  were  related  to  Ms.  K.  calling  the \npolice  due  to  difficulties  ensuring  that  her  son  Mr.  K.  (then  a  teenager)  attended  school  and \nfollowed  her rules.  The  DIRs  were  for  verbal  altercations  only,  and  did  not  result  in  any  ACS \ninvolvement.  Since  that  time,  Ms.  K.  has  successfully  raised  three  children  and  helped  raise \nseven  grandchildren.  Mr.  K.  is  now  27  years  old,  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  domestic \nincidents  in  the  home  since  he  became  an  adult.  Likewise,  there  is  no  evidence  that  suggests  Ms. \nK.  would  not  provide  a  safe  home  for  infant  T.R.  today. \n43.  Although  it  is  in  ACSโs  discretion  to  certify  the  home  of Ms.  K.,  it  refused  to \ncontinue  with  a  full  home  study  and  evaluation  of Ms.  K.โs  home  once  it  learned  of the  SCR \nhistory.  Moreover,  ACS  refused  to  provide  Ms.  K.  with  written  notice  officially  denying  foster \ncare  certification.  ACS  stated  that  because  it  was  conducting  a  temporary  emergency  evaluation, \nwritten  notice  was  not  required.  Simultaneously,  ACS  refused  to  refer  Ms.  K.  for  the  full  foster \nparent  certification  process.  As  such,  T.R.  was  left  without  a  meaningful  assessment  of Ms.  K.โs \nability  to  care  for  him  and,  he  was  deprived  of  any  written  notice  of the denial.  There  is  no \nprocess  for T.R.  to  challenge  ACSโs  decision. \n44.  Rather than  being  placed  in  a  certified  kin  foster  home,  T.R.  was  directly  placed \nwith  Ms.  K.  As  a  result,  Ms.  K.  will  continue  to  care  for  and  support  T.R.  without  being  a \n  \n?  ACS  also reported  that they opposed placement due  to  a 2018  arrest of Mr.  K.  The  Legal  Aid  Society  ran  a \ncriminal  background check  for Mr.  K.  that  yielded no  criminal charges  from  any  2018  arrest.  After being  informed \nof the  results of the  criminal  background check,  ACS did  not pursue  that argument  in  their opposition  to placement \nwith  Ms.  K.  Moreover,  an  arrest alone  would  not  qualify  as  a mandatory disqualifier regardless of the  arrest charge. \n13\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  14  of  74  PagelD  #:  14 \ncertified  foster parent  and  without  any  of  the  critical  Childcare  Supports  and  Services  for  T.R. \nThe  Family  Court  noted  that  ACSโs  opposition  rested  uniquely  on  the  fact  that  Ms.  K.  had  an \nindicated  case  twenty  years  ago,  for  which  no  case  was  ever  filed  or brought  to  court,  and  a  few \nDIRs.  The  Court  concluded  that  the  โcurrent  ACS  investigation  has  revealed  nothing  else  and \nhas  not  demonstrated  in  any  other  manner  that  the  grandmotherโs  home  is  not  suitable.  In  fact,  it \nis  of  no  little  import  that  Ms.  K.[]  was  a  successful  placement  resource  for the  subject  childโs \nsibling(s).โ \n45.  Although  Ms.  K.  understands  the  demands  of caring  for  an  infant,  the  family \nstruggles  without  the  Childcare  Supports  and  Services.  ACS  has  not  provided  Ms.  K.  with  T.R.โs \nbasic  documents,  including  his  birth  certificate,  to  assist  in  enrollment  in  needed  programs.  Ms. \nK.  also  cannot  participate  in  training  and  services  for  foster parents  that  would  provide  helpful \nguidance  and  community  in  caring  for  a  young  child. \n46.  โ_ The  family  is  also  struggling  financially.  Ms.  K.  worked  in  New  York  City  for \nmany  years  to  support  her  extended  family,  including  in  a  nursing  home  and  a  daycare  setting. \nThe  two  adults  and  two  children  live  in  a  small  apartment,  and  Ms.  K.  has  requested  assistance \nfrom  ACS  multiple  times  to  obtain  more  suitable  furniture,  educational  toys  and  housing.  Ms.  K. \noften  forgoes  her  own  needs  to  help  provide  for  her  family,  but  must  rely  on  financial  support \nfrom  relatives,  or  the  scarce  visits  from  ACS,  to  supply  her  with  diapers  for T.R.  It  was  recently \nrecommended  that  T.R.  receive  physical  therapy  to  help  improve  his  delayed  gross  motor  skills, \nwhich  impact  his  balance,  increasing  the  demands  on  Ms.  K. \n47.  Living  with  his  grandmother,  uncle  and  cousin  provides  T.R.  with  the  love, \nsupport,  and  stability  that  is  critical  for  a  young  baby.  T.R.  and  his  cousin  are  very  close,  and \nenjoy  playing  together.  They  love  to  wrestle  with  each  other  and  chase  each  other  throughout \n14\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  15  of  74  PagelD  #:  15 \nMs.  K.โs  home.  Although  T.R.  was  not  meeting  developmental  milestones  when  he  first  came  to \nlive  with  Ms.  K.,  he  is  now  thriving  in  Ms.  K.โs  careโhe  has  started  to  talk,  walk  freely,  is \nlearning  the  alphabet,  and  loves  to  listen  to  music  and  dance.  Ms.  K.  takes  T.R.  to  his  medical \nappointments  and  supports  his  emotional  and  developmental  needs.  T.R.  has  recently  started  to \ncall  Ms.  K.  โNana.โ  Ms.  K.โs  ongoing  relationship  with  T.R.โs  half  siblings  allows  T.R.  the \nchance  to  develop  substantial  connections  with  his  biological  family.  She  regularly  arranges  for \nT.R.  to  have  visits  with  his  half-siblings,  and  is  planning  to  introduce  T.R.  to  his  newborn  cousin \nsoon. \n48.  Ms.  K.  has  received  inconsistent  updates  on  the  status  of T.R.โs  case  from  ACS, \nand  the  family  lives  in  fear  that  T.R.  is  going  to  be  removed  from  her care  at  any  time. \n49.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiff T.R.  appears  by  his  next  friend,  Cynthia  Godsoe.  Ms.  Godsoe  is  familiar  with  the  issues \nregarding  T.R.โs  experience  under  ACS  custody  and  supervision  and  is  well  suited  to  represent \nT.R.โs  best  interests  in  this  case.  Ms.  Godsoe  is  a  Professor  of Law  at  Brooklyn  Law  School \nwhere  she  teaches  courses  on  Family  Law  and  Children  and  the  Law.  She  also  represented \nchildren  for  several  years  in  New  York  Cityโs  Family  Court. \nNamed  Plaintiff M.P. \n50.  In  December  2018,  ACS  removed  then  fourteen-year old  M.P.  from  his  fatherโs \ncare  in  Brooklyn  and  placed  him  in  the  care  and  custody  of ACS.  M.P.โs  mother  was  deceased  at \nthe  time. \n51.  Upon  removal,  ACS  placed  M.P.  with  Ms.  M.,  his  fatherโs  cousin.  Ms.  M.  had \nbeen  a  resource  and  support  for  M.P.  since  before  ACS  removed  him  from  his  fatherโs  care.  Ms. \n15\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  16  of  74  PagelD  #:  16 \nM.  served  as  a  foster parent  for  several  children  for over  a  decade  up  until  2009  when  her  home \nclosed.  As  such  Ms.  M.  understands  the  demands  of caring  for  children  in  ACS  custody. \n52.  In  February  2019,  ACS  placed  M.P.  at  Geller  House,  a  Rapid  Intervention  Center, \nfor  assessment.  ACS  then  moved  M.P.  to  Childrenโs  Village,  a Residential  Treatment  Center \n(RTC),  in  May  2019.  The  RTC  is  a  congregate  care  facility  in  Westchester.  M.P.  felt  depressed, \ndisconnected  from  his  community  and  unsafe  at  the  RTC  and  after  ten  days  left  the  facility  and \nwent  to  Ms.  M.โs  home.  Ms.  M.  then  sought  to  proceed  with  foster  parent  certification  so  that  she \nwould  be  able  to  provide  longer  term  care  for  M.P. \n53.  Ms.  M.  was  able  to  provide  a  loving,  stable,  and  caring  environment  for  M.P,  with \nMs.  M.  reporting  no  issues  and  an  improving  relationship.  M.P.  requires  special  support  such  as \nmental  health  care  to  help  address  some  impulsive  behavior.  Ms.  M.  not  only  enrolled  M.P.  in \nschool  but  also  helped  M.P.  meet  his  mental  health  and  medical  needs,  including  ensuring  M.P. \nhad  a  mental  health  provider  in  his  community.  In  addition,  the  family  began  to  engage  in  family \ntherapy.  M.P.โs  father  also  expressed  that  he  wanted  M.P.  to  be  under  the  care  of Ms.  M. \n54.  M.P.โs  behavior  improved  under  the  care  of Ms.  M.  M.P.  expressed  a desire  to \nperform  better  in  school,  with  Ms.  M.  encouraging  M.P.  to  strive  to  graduate  on  time.  Under Ms. \nM.โs  supervision,  M.P  completed  chores  and  helped  around  the  house,  such  as  cleaning  his  room \nor doing  laundry.  M.P.  and  Ms.  M.  also  enjoyed  making  dinner  together. \n55.  However,  over  eight  months  later,  in  January  2020,  ACS  still  would  not  certify \nMs.  M.  as  a  foster parent  for M.P.  due  to  a  single  SCR  record  for  โInadequate  Guardianshipโ \nfrom  over  a  decade  earlier.  The  SCR  record  was  from  Ms.  M.โs  service  as  a  foster parent.  Her \nhome  was  closed  as  a  foster  placement  with  ACS  in  2009.  ACS  did  not  provide  further  details \nabout  the  SCR  record  and  the  closure  of  Ms.  M.โs  home  ten  years  earlier. \n16\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  17  of  74  PagelD  #:  17 \n56.  Instead  of providing  M.P.  with  the  Childcare  Supports  and  Services  that  come \nwith  being  in  a  certified  foster  home,  ACS  continued  M.P.โs  placement  with  Ms.  M.  as  an \nโextended  visit.โ  ACS  never provided  M.P.  with  notice  officially  denying  foster care  placement \nwith  Ms.  M.  Moreover,  there  is  no  process  for M.P.  to  challenge  ACSโs  decision. \n57.  Even  after  ACS  denied  M.P.  foster care  placement  with  Ms.  M.,  ACS  reported \nthat  Ms.  M.  was  a  โgreat  support  systemโ  for  M.P.  She  reportedly  provides  โstructure  and \nguidanceโ  and  is  helping  M.P.  โadhere  to  boundaries  and  limits  in  the  home.โ  ACS  reported  โno \nissue[s]โ  since  M.P.  was  with  Ms.  M.  Moreover,  while  with  Ms.  M.,  M.P.  was  able  to  maintain \nconnection  to  his  family  and  to  his  community. \n58.  In  the  fall  of 2020,  Ms.  M.  began  to  really  struggle  to  continue  to  care  for  M.P. \nMs.  M.  was  unable  to  work  due  to  an  injury,  and  without  the  Childcare  Supports  and  Services \nthat  come  with  a  foster  care  placement,  some  of M.P.โs  behavioral  needs  became difficult  to \nmanage.  ACS  removed  M.P.  from  Ms.  M.โs  home  in  December  2020  and  placed  him  back  at  the \nRTC  where  he  had  felt  unsafe. \n59.  M.P.  remains  at  the  RTC  in  Westchester,  far  away  from  his  home  community. \nPlacement  in  institutional  care  makes  M.P.  more  susceptible  to  poor  school  performance, \nhomelessness,  arrest,  and  aging  out  of ACS  custody  without  a permanent  home. \n60.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiff M.P.  appears  by  his  next  friend,  Adira  Hulkower.  Ms.  Hulkower  is  familiar  with  the \nissues  regarding  M.P.โs  time  under  ACS  custody  and  supervision.  Ms.  Hulkower  is  a bioethics \nconsultant  in  a  major  New  York  City  health  system.  She  previously  represented  children  in  New \nYork  City  Family  Court  for over  a  decade.  Ms.  Hulkower  is  well  suited  to  represent  M.P.โs  best \ninterests  in  this  case. \n17\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  18  of  74  PagelD  #:  18 \nNamed  Plaintiffs  Z.W.  and  D.W. \n61.  In  August,  2019,  Z.W.,  then  |  year old  and  D.W.,  then  3  months  old,  were \nremoved  from  their parents  in  the  Bronx  by  ACS.  ACS  directly  placed  them  with  their  maternal \nuncle,  Mr.  P.,  and  his  partner,  Ms.  G.  Having  been  with  their  aunt  and  uncle  since  they  were \nbabies,  Mr.  P.โs  home  is  essentially  the  only  one  Z.W.  and  D.W.  have  ever  known. \n62.  Mr.  P.  and  Ms.  G.  provide  a  safe  and  loving  home  for Z.W.  and  D.W.  and  the \nchildren  are  thriving  in  their  care.  Z.W.  is  a  smart,  happy,  and  energetic  child  who  loves  to \npractice  counting  and  the  ABCs.  D.W.  loves  interactive  board  games,  building  with  blocks,  and \nplaying  with  tennis  balls. \n63.  Mr.  P.  and  Ms.  G.  do  not  want  the  children  to  end  up  in  stranger  foster care.  They \nhave extended  family  around  the  home  often,  and  arrange  for Z.W.  and  D.W.  to  visit  with  their \nsiblings  nearly  every  week.  Growing  up  with  family  around  provides  Z.W.  and  D.W.  with  the \nstability  and  support  that  is  critical  for  young  childrenโs  development. \n64.  When  ACS  placed  the  children  with  Mr.  P.,  he  immediately  sought  foster parent \ncertification  for Z.W.  and  D.W.,  but  has  repeatedly  been  told  that  he  is  unable  to  be certified  due \nto  a  case  pending  since  May  2019  in  which  he  is  accused  of  Driving  Under  the  Influence  (DUD. \nThe case  remained  open  for over  two  years  due  to  pandemic  related  delays.  No  other charges \nwere  ever  filed  in  connection  with  the  arrest.  Because  the  charge  does  not  implicate  a  mandatory \ndisqualifying  conviction,  ACS  is  not  required  to  hold  his  foster parent  application  in  abeyance. \n65.  Despite  their  ability  to  use  their  discretion  and  certify  Mr.  P.,  ACS  refuses  to \nevaluate  Mr.  P.  as  foster  parent  for Z.W.  or  D.W.  or even  allow  him  to  proceed  with  a  full \napplication.  Mr.  P.โs  criminal  case  has  since  been  resolved,  and  yet  ACS  continues  to  tell  Mr.  P. \nhe  cannot  be  a  foster  parent  for  his  niece  and  nephew.  At  the  same  time,  ACS  has  refused  to \n18\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  19  of  74  PagelD  #:  19 \nprovide  written  notice  officially  denying  foster  care  certification  to  the children  or  their  uncle. \nThere  is  no  process  for  D.W.  or Z.W.  to  challenge  ACSโs  decision. \n66.  By  permitting  Z.W.  and  D.W.  to  remain  directly  placed  in  Mr.  Pโs  care  for  more \nthan  two  years,  ACS  has  effectively  acknowledged  that  this  placement  is  consistent  with  Z.W. \nand  D.W.โs  best  interests.  It  has  reported  that  there  are  โno  safety  factorsโ  with  the  home,  yet \nsimultaneously  denies  Mr.  P.  foster care  funding,  training  and  services  to  care  for  the  children. \nACS  reported  that  the  children  are  โbonded  and  comfortableโ  with  their  uncle  and  his  partner. \n67.  Z.W.  and  D.W.  have  two  siblings  who  were  also  removed  by  ACS  at  the  same \ntime  and  who  expressed  interest  in  living  with  their  uncle.  Having  the  opportunity  to  live  with \ntheir  two  additional  siblings  together  would  have  been  good  for Z.W.  and  D.W.  and  their \nsiblings.  However,  without  foster parent  certification  Mr.  P.  is  unable  to  care  for  all  four \nchildren. \n68.  Although  Mr.  P.  and  Ms.  G.  are  devoted  to  caring  for Z.W.  and  D.W.,  they  were \nnot  expecting  to  have  two  young  babies  at  this  point  in  their  lives.  Without  the  assistance  of \nChildcare  Services  and  Supports  that  comes  with  foster  parent  certification,  the  family  is \nstruggling.  Mr.  P.  has  four boys  of  his  ownโtwo  of  whom,  ages  16  and  10,  still  live  with  the \nfamily.  Z.W.  was  enrolled  in  daycare  5  days  per  week,  but  that  has  stopped  since  the daycare \npermanently  closed.  Increasing  the  demands  on  the  family,  D.W.  was  diagnosed  with  autism  in \nMarch  2021,  and  he  receives  daily  therapy  in  person,  and  speech  therapy  twice  per  week.  D.W. \nis  non-verbal  and  exhibits  some  challenging  behaviors. \n69.  The  financial  stress  of caring  for  two  young  children,  especially  during  the \npandemic,  has  also  taken  a  toll  on  the couple.  Mr.  P.  recently  lost  his job  as  a  personal  trainer  at  a \ngym  because  of its  closure.  Ms.  G.  works  as  a housekeeper  at  a  hospital,  which  is  a  hard  and \n19\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  20  of  74  PagelD  #:  20 \nstressful job,  and  provides  limited  financial  resources.  Further,  Mr.  P.  is  unable  to  get  Z.W.  and \nD.W.  included  on  his  public  assistance  budget,  because  they  remain  on  their  motherโs  budget. \nBesides  providing  a  bed  for Z.W.  and  a  few  daycare  vouchers,  ACS  has  not  offered  any  support \nto  the  family.  If ACS  had  certified  the  home,  the  family  may  have  been  eligible  for  increased \nfoster  care  funding  due  to  D.W.โs  increased  needs. \n70.  Z.W.and  D.W.โs  mother  recently  had  a  baby,  who  is  at  risk  of being  removed  due \nto  the  ongoing  child  welfare  concerns  surrounding  the  motherโs  mental  health  and  substance \nabuse  issues.  Mr.  P.  has  expressed  that  although  he  would  be  willing  to  care  for  the  newborn  to \navoid  placement  into  stranger  foster  care,  without  the  Childcare  Services  and  Supports  that \ncomes  from  foster care  certification,  the  family  will  not  be  able  to  care  for  the  additional  child. \n71.  | Thechildrenโs  direct  placement  with  their  uncle  is  not  a  permanent  option  for \nthem  due  to  the  temporary  status  of a  direct  placement  and  the  lack  of Childcare  Supports  and \nServices.  The  family  is  unable  to  plan  for the  future  and  Z.W.  and  D.W.  continually  worry  about \nwhether  they  will  be  able  to  remain  with  their  uncle.  As  the  children  grow  and  D.W.โs  needs \nincrease,  the  strain  on  the  family  only  deepens. \n72.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedures,  Named \nPlaintiffs  Z.W.  and  D.W.  appear by  their  next  friend,  Jennifer  Melnick.  Ms.  Melnick  is  a  clinical \nsocial  worker  and  therapist  who  has  worked  with  children  and  adults  for  over  twenty  years.  In \naddition,  she  provides  assessments  and  service  recommendations  for  children  involved  in  the \nchild  welfare  system.  Ms.  Melnick  is  familiar  with  the  issues  regarding  Z.W.  and  D.W.โs \nexperience  under ACS  custody  and  supervision,  and  is  well  suited  to  represent  their best  interests \nin  the case. \n20\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  21  of  74  PagelD  #:  21 \nNamed  Plaintiff  C.W.C. \n73.  In  August  2020,  ACS  removed  3  year-old,  C.W.C.  from  her  motherโs  care  in  the \nBronx.  Immediately,  C.W.C.  was  placed  with  her  maternal  grandmother,  Mrs.  G.  and  has  been  in \nher care  since. \n74.  Mrs.  G.  has  been  a  positive  presence  in  C.W.C.โs  life  since  C.W.C  was  born, \noften  watching  and  caring  for  her  when  her parents  were  unable.  Prior  to  her  removal  from  her \nmother,  C.W.C.  and  her  mother  lived  with  Mrs.  G. \n75.  According  to  ACS,  C.W.C.  is  thriving  with  Mrs.  G.  She  has  a  โvariety  of \neducational  toysโ  in  the  home.  C.W.C.  loves  music  and  often  sings  along  to  her  favorite  songs. \nC.W.C.  lives  with  Mrs.  G.,  Mrs.  Gโs  husband,  her  aunt  (Mrs.  Gโs  daughter),  and  her  auntโs \nchildren,  ages  12  and  20  months.  ACS  reported  that  C.W.C. โinteracts  appropriately  [sic]  with \nfamily  members  in  the  home.โ  Her  cousins  are  like  siblings  to  C.W.C.  She  and  the  20  month-old \nare  very  close  and  watch  cartoons  together  every  morning  before  school. \n76.  According  to  an  August  2021  ACS  Report,  there  are  no  safety  concerns  regarding \nC.W.C.โs  placement  with  Mrs.  G.  Her  daycare  reports  that  C.W.C.  is  playful,  makes  friends,  and \nis  using  the  toilet  appropriately. \n77.  In  addition  to  being  a  mother  herself,  Mrs.  G.  was  a  certified  foster  parent  for  over \n30  years  caring  for  dozens  of children  and  adopting  three  children.  Mrs.  G.  has  been  a  caretaker \nfor the  majority  of her  life.  Yet  despite  her extensive experience  and  ability  to  care  for  C.W.C., \nACS  refused  to  certify  Mrs.  G.  as  a  foster  parent  for  C.W.C. \n78.  ACS  reported  that  Mrs.  G.  could  not  be certified  due  to  an  incident  that  occurred \nin  her  home  over  five  years  earlier  while  she  was  serving  as  a  foster parent.  ACS  conducted  an \n21\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  22  of  74  PagelD  #:  22 \ninvestigation  when  a  child  was  injured  in  the  home,  allegedly  due  to  one  young  child  hitting \nanother  with  a  toy.  The  investigation  was  unfounded  but  Mrs.  G.โs  home  was  closed. \n79.  At  the  time,  Mrs.  G.  was  not  informed  her  home  was  closed.  It  was  not  until  she \nwas  told  she  could  not  be  a kin  foster  parent  for  C.W.C.  that  she  realized  something  was  wrong. \nImmediately,  Mrs.  G.  contacted  OCFS  and  received  a  letter  on  March  5,  2021  stating  that  the \ninvestigation  was  unfounded.  She  sent  this  letter  to  ACS,  but  was  told  they  would  not  overrule \nthe  initial  decision.  Mrs.  G.  also  wrote  to  the  ACS  Commissioner  and  Assistant  Commissioner  in \nMay  2021  but  received  no  response.  In  October  of  2021,  ACS  reported  that  that  it  had \nโattempted  to  have  [Mrs.  Gโs]  previous  foster care  determination  overturned  however  [ACSโs] \nefforts  were  unsuccessful.โ  ACS  did  not  provide  C.W.C.  or Mrs.  G.  with  a  formal  notice  of \ndenial  of certification.  C.W.C.  has  no  recourse  to  challenge  the denial  of her  foster care \nplacement  with  Mrs.  G. \n80.  C.W.C.โs  placement  was  changed  to  a  direct  placement.  Mrs.  G.  continues  to  fight \nto  have  her  home  reopened.  In  the  meantime,  C.W.C.  resides  in  her  home  without  much  needed \nChildcare  Supports  and  Services. \n81.  Mrs.  G.  takes  care  of C.W.C.  with  the  help  of  her  husband,  her  daughter,  and \nC.W.C.โs  godmother.  The  family  provides  a  loving  and  familiar home  for C.W.C.,  who  enjoys \nwalks  with  her  grandmother  and  participates  in  religious  services  with  her  family.  C.W.C.  does \nnot  receive  any  assistance  from  ACS.  Moreover,  ACS  reported  that  Mrs.  G.  tried  to  apply  for \nfood  stamps  for C.W.C.  but  was  denied  because  C.W.Cโs  mother  was  already  receiving  benefits \nfor  her.  Mrs.  G.  is  on  a  fixed  income,  receiving  social  security  and  disability  benefits  and  has \nmade  many  sacrifices  to  care  for  C.W.C.  The  family  worries  every  day  that  C.W.C.  will  be \nremoved  from  their care. \n22\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  23  of  74  PagelD  #:  23 \n82.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiff C.W.C.  appears  by  her  next  friend,  Joy  Rosenthal.  Ms.  Rosenthal  is  familiar  with  the \nissues  regarding  C.W.C.โs  time  under  ACS  custody  and  supervision.  Ms.  Rosenthal  is  an  Adjunct \nProfessor  at  City  University  of New  York  School  of  Law  and  has  represented  children  and \nfamilies  in  New  York  City  for over  twenty  years.  Ms.  Rosenthal  is  well  suited  to  represent \nC.W.C.โs  best  interests  in  this  case. \nNamed  Plaintiff J.R. \n83.  In  August  2017,  when  J.R.  was  seven  years  old,  ACS  removed  J.R.  from  his \nfather  in  Brooklyn  and  took  him  into ACS  custody.  ACS  initially  placed  J.R.  at  a  large  shelter  in \nManhattan  until  moving  him  to  a  stranger  foster  home. \n84.  The  removal  was  particularly  traumatic  for  J.R.  who  only  10  months  earlier  had \nlost  his  mother.  He  was  still  trying  to  process  her  death  when  he  was  placed  into  stranger  foster \ncare. \n85.  Since  his  initial  placement,  J.R.  has  moved  in  and  out  of different  homes  at  least \nsix  times  while  under  the  supervision  of ACS.  As  a  result,  he  has  been  forced  to  change  schools \nseveral  times,  interrupting  his  education  and  putting  his  grade  promotions  at  risk.  Moreover,  J.R. \nhas  had  an  Individuated  Education  Plan  (IEP),  a  written  plan  that  specifies  a  childโs  special \neducation  and  related  service  needs,  since  at  least  2019.  His  IEP  requires  additional  services  to \naddress  his  disabilities  and  increased  learning  needs.  Changing  schools  has  only  made  it  more \ndifficult  to  ensure  J.R.  has  an  appropriate  educational  plan  so  he  can  make  progress  toward  his \nacademic  goals. \n86.  In  December  2019,  ACS  placed  J.R.  with  his  paternal  grandmother,  Ms.  V.,  and \nher  husband.  Ms.  V.  stepped  up  to  care  for J.R.  and  provide  a  safe  and  loving  home  for  him.  J.R. \n23\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  24  of  74  PagelD  #:  24 \nhad  previously  lived  with  Ms.  V  for three  months  until  a  medical  issue  temporarily  prevented  her \nfrom  caring  for  him.  Once  better,  Ms.  V.  sought  foster  parent  certification  in  order  to  care  for \nJ.R. \n87.   J.R.  really  enjoyed  living  with  his  grandparents.  He  felt  connected  with  his \nextended  family  and  safe  and  secure  with  his  grandmother.  J.R.  enjoyed  going  to  school  while \nliving  with  Ms.  V.  ACS  reported  that  he  was  โhappyโ  in  his  grandmotherโs  home  and  things \nwere  going  โsmoothly  and  well.โ  ACS  also  started  the  process  of withdrawing  their petition  to \nterminate  J.R.โs  fatherโs  parental  rights  because  ACS  was  working  toward  KinGAP  with  Ms.  V. \nas  J.R.โs  permanency  plan. \n88.  However, just  two  months  after  being  placed  in  Ms.  V.โs  home,  ACS  removed \nJ.R.  and  once  again  placed  him  in  a  stranger  foster  home.  ACS  denied  foster parent  certification \nafter  a  background  check  revealed  Ms.  V.โs  husband  had  an  almost  thirty  year old  conviction  for \nrobbery  in  the  2nd  degree,  a  mandatory  disqualifying  conviction.  The  news  was  devastating  to \nJ.R.  Despite  the  age  of the  conviction  and  the  fact  that  J.R.  was  thriving  in  the  grandmotherโs  \nhome,  ACS  removed  J.R.,  subjecting  him  to  another  traumatic  move. \n89.  ACS  never provided  J.R.  with  notice  officially  denying  foster care  placement  with \nhis  grandmother.  Moreover,  there  is  no  process  for J.R.  to  challenge  ACSโs  decision.  As  a  result \nof the  move,  J.R.  was  again  placed  in  a  new  school. \n90.  Throughout  his  foster placements,  J.R.  has  continued  to  request  sibling  visits  with \nhis  half-siblings  and  step-siblings.  However,  it  has  often  been  difficult  to  coordinate  visits  with \nhis  brother  and  sisters,  some  of  whom  are  his  age  and  thus  close  alliesโ13-  and  12-year-old \nstep-siblings,  and  a  9-year  old  half-siblingโas  well  as  a  younger  half-sibling  who  is  now  4.  His \n24\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  25  of  74  PagelD  #:  25 \nlongest-term  placement  was  in  the  Bronx  while  most  of his  family  lives  in  Brooklyn.  This \nseparation  only  served  to  magnify  the  trauma of his  removal  from  his  father  and  grandmother. \n91.  J.R.  has  been  diagnosed  with  mental  health  issues  on  multiple  occasions  during \nhis  time  in  foster care.  He  was  diagnosed  three  times  โ  in  September of 2017,  June  of 2017  and \nApril  of 2019  โ  each  time  with  at  least  one  new  diagnosis.  He  has  been  found  to  have  eight \ndifferent  diagnoses,  including  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  major \nDepressive  Disorder,  Disruptive  Mood  Dysregulation  Disorder,  Complex  Bereavement  Disorder, \nPosttraumatic  Stress  Disorder,  Neglect  and  associated  Victim  of  Neglect  and  Abuse,  and \nLanguage  Disorder.  He  has  received  mental  health  and  therapy  services  off  and  on  since  entering \nfoster  care. \n92.  Again  in  January  2021  J.R.  was  moved  from  a  stranger  foster  home  in  the  Bronx \nto  a  new  stranger  foster  home  in  Harlem.  Without  any  permanency,  J.R.  lacks  stability  and \ncontinues  to  be  moved  from  home  to  home.  These  disruptions  are  difficult  and  unsettling  for J.R. \nand  reduce  the  likelihood  of  finding  a permanent,  loving  home.  J.R.  once  again  will  transfer  in \nthe  middle  of his  5\"  grade  year to  a  new  school  with  all  new  children  and  teachers.  His  IEP \nservices  will  be  disrupted  with  the  change  of school  and  J.R.  will  once  again  need  to  advocate  for \nadditional  supports  to  keep  up  in  the  classroom. \n93.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiff J.R.  appears  by  his  next  friend,  Anna Roberts.  Ms.  Roberts  is  a  law  professor  who  is \nfamiliar  with  the  issues  regarding  J.R.โs  time  under  ACS  custody  and  supervision.  Ms.  Roberts  is \nan  expert  in  criminal  law  and  the  racial  biases  inherent  in  the  criminal  legal  system.  She  is  well \nsuited  to  represent  J.R.โs  best  interests  in  this  case. \n25\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  26  of  74  PagelD  #:  26 \nNamed  Plaintiffs  J.S.  and  S.S. \n94.  In  March  2018,  ACS  removed  J.S.  from  his  parents  in  Queens  and  took  him  into \nACS  custody.  He  was  fourteen  months  old  at  the  time.  Fortunately,  ACS  immediately  placed  J.S. \nwith  a  relative  he  has  known  his  whole  life โ  his  maternal  grandmother,  Ms.  S.  When  his \nyounger  sister  S.S.  was  born  in  April  2018,  ACS  immediately  took  her  into  its  custody  and  also \nplaced  her  with  her grandmother,  Ms.  S. \n95.  Both  children  have  found  a  stable  and  loving  home  with  their  grandmother.  Ms.  S. \nenrolled  J.S.  and  S.S.  in  daycare  and  she  takes  both  children  to  their  regular  medical \nappointments.  Ms.  S.  also  makes  sure  that  the  children  stay  connected  with  their extended  family \nand  often  has  relatives  over  to  the  home.  It  is  obvious  that  J.S.  and  S.S.  adore  their  grandmother. \nFor  S.S.  especially,  Ms.  S.โs  home  is  the  only  home  she  has  ever  known.  S.S.  is  now  3  years  old \nand  has  started  calling  Ms.  S.  โmama.โ \n96.  Despite  the  stability  and  safety  both  children  have  found  living  with  Ms.  S.  โ  and \ndespite  Ms.  S.โs  eagerness  to  be certified  as  a  foster  parent  for J.S.  and  S.S.โ  ACS  informed  Ms. \nS.  that  she  could  not  be  certified  as  a  foster  parent.  Instead  in  April  2018,  ACS  โdirectly  placedโ \nthe children  with  Ms.  S.  However,  it  wasnโt  until  June  17,  2019  โ  over  a  year  after placing  J.S. \nand  S.S.  with  their  grandmother  and  after  a  threat  of contempt  of court,  that  ACS  issued  a  letter \nlaying  out  the  basis  for  the  denial  of  foster parent  certification.  This  letter  stated  that  Ms.  S.  could \nnot  be  certified  as  a  foster parent  for  the  children  due  to  her  SCR  and  criminal  history,  but  failed \nto  provide  any  information  about  what,  if  any,  recourse  there  was  for  the  family. \n97.  Notably,  most  of this  SCR  and  criminal  history  is  decades  old,  dating  from  the \n1980s  and  early  1990s  when  Ms.  S.  suffered  from  substance  abuse.  Ms.  S.  has  been  clean  for \nover  25  years  and  these  stale  reports  have  no  bearing  on  her  ability  to  provide  a  safe  and  loving \n26\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  27  of  74  PagelD  #:  27 \nhome  for  both  J.S.  and  S.S.  now.  More  recently,  Ms.  S.  has  struggled  with  her daughter โ  J.S. \nand  S.S.โs  mother โ  due  to  her daughterโs  mental  illness.  A  few  Domestic  Incident  Reports  and \none  arrest  resulted  from  altercations  as  she  struggled  to  raise  her  young  adult  daughter  several \nyears  before  her  grandchildren  were  placed  in  her  home. \n98.  Dueto  Ms.  S.โs  history,  ACS  refused  to  certify  her  as  a  foster  parent  for  J.S.  and \nS.S.  For  this  reason,  the  family  remains  ineligible  for  Childcare  Services  and  Supports  that  come \nwith  foster parent  certification,  despite  the  care  she  provides.  ACS  never  provided  Ms.  S.  with \nthe  required  notice  officially  denying  foster care  certification  for J.S.  and  S.S.,  nor did  they \nprovide  any  notification  to  J.S.  or  S.S.  Moreover,  there  is  no  process  for  the  children  to  challenge \nACSโs  decision. \n99.  _โ_ Despite  its  refusal  to  certify  Ms.  S.,  ACS  nevertheless  recognized  that  there  were \nno  actual  safety  concerns  with  placing  J.S.  and  S.S.  in  Ms.  S.โs  care  and  therefore  opted  to \nโdirectly  placeโ  the  children  in  her  care.  This  means  that  Ms.  S.  continues  to  care  for  and  support \nthe children  without  being  a  certified  foster  parent  and  โ  crucially  โ  without  any  Childcare \nServices  and  Supports.  ACS  continues  to  report  that  the  children  are  doing  โexceptionally  wellโ \nin  the care  of their grandmother. \n100.  ACSโs  denial  of  foster  parent  certification  has  put  significant  financial  stress  on \nthe  family.  Until  recently,  Ms.  S.  was  also  caring  for  her  late  sister  who  was  an  amputee  and \nlived  with  Ms.  S.  As  many  loving  grandmothers  would,  Ms.  S.  deprives  herself  in  order  to \nprovide  for  her  grandchildren.  Sadly,  even  these  sacrifices  are  not  enough.  The  family  has  not \nhad  enough  money  to  provide  a  Thanksgiving  meal  and  the  childrenโs  attorney  provides  second \nhand  clothes  for  J.S.  and  S.S.  The  minimal  public  assistance  the  family  receives  does  not  even \n27\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  28  of  74  PagelD  #:  28 \ncover  the  cost  of diapers  and  other  necessities.  Ms.  S.  is  worried  that  she  will  never be  able  to \nretire  if she  must  care  for  the  children  without  any  support  or  services  from  ACS. \n101.  Adding  to  these  struggles,  J.S.  was  diagnosed  with  Autism  Spectrum  Disorder.  As \nhis  needs  increase,  so  do  the  demands  on  the  household.  The  children  struggle  without  a  foster \ncare  case  planner,  medical  services  and  other  resources  ACS  provides  children  in  foster care.  If \nJ.S.  were  in  the  certified  foster  home  of Ms.  S.,  he  might  have  been  eligible  for  increased  foster \ncare  maintenance  rate  due  to  his  increased  needs.  On  her  own  Ms.  S.  โhas  done  everything \nneeded  to  have  [J.S.]  evaluated  and  have  him  in  the  correct  setting  in  school  where  he  is \nreceiving  the  necessary  servicesโ  but  because  of his  aggressive  and  overactive  behavior,  J.S.  is \nstruggling  to  stay  in  pre-school.  J.S.  and  S.S.  worry  about  being  removed  from  their grandmother \nโa  change  that  would  cause  them  trauma  and  emotional  stress.  Ms.  S.  wants  to  provide  a \npermanent  home  for  the  children  but  โ  because  of her  denial  as  foster parent  โ  she  is  not  eligible \nfor  KinGAP  and  she  will  face  the  same  barriers  to  adoption  as  she  did  to  foster  parent \ncertification. \n102.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiffs  J.S.  and  S.S.  appear by  their  next  friend,  Lisa  Hoyes.  Ms.  Hoyes  is  an  Assistant  Dean  at \nNew  York  University  School  of Law.  She  previously  represented  young  people  in  civil,  criminal \nand  family  court.  Ms.  Hoyes  is  familiar  with  the  issues  regarding  J.Sโs  and  S.S.โs  experience \nunder  ACS  custody  and  supervision  and  is  well  suited  to  represent  J.Sโs  and  S.S.โs  best  interests \nin  this  case. \nNamed  Plaintiff  C.P. \n103.  Six  year  old  C.P.  and  his  three  younger  siblings  were  removed  from  their  mother \nin  the  Bronx  and  taken  into  ACS  custody  in  October  2020.  After  his  removal,  C.P.โs  uncle,  Mr. \n28\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  29  of  74  PagelD  #:  29 \nP,  immediately  offered  to  become  a  foster parent  for C.P.  so  that  he  could  avoid  stranger  foster \ncare.  However,  ACS  refused  to  certify  Mr.  P.  as  foster  parent  because  he  had  a prior \nmisdemeanor conviction.  As  a  result,  C.P.  is  now  in  a  stranger  foster  home  away  from  his \nfamily. \n104.  C.P.  has  always  been  close  with  his  uncle.  Mr.  P.  often  watched  and  cared  for \nC.P.  and  his  siblings.  Most  notably,  during  the  pandemic  shut  down,  Mr.  P.  helped  care  for  all \nfour  children,  often  overnight.  C.P.  adores  Mr.  P.  and  affectionately  calls  him  by  the  single  name \nโUncle.โ  Mr.  P  also  lives  close  to  Mr.  P.โs  sister.  If C.P.  lived  with  Mr.  P.  he  would  be  able  to \nsee  his  aunt  and  cousins  often.  Before  C.P.  was  taken  into  ACS  custody,  his  aunt  cared  for  him \nand  one  of his  younger  brothers  about  twice  a  month.  Together  the  family  would  go  to  the  park, \nwatch  movies,  and  sometimes  have  sleepovers. \n105.  After C.P.  and  his  three  younger  siblings  were  removed  from  their  mother,  they \nwere  all  placed  at  the  Childrenโs  Center,  a  large  shelter  in  Manhattan.  Immediately  after  removal, \nC.P.  asked  to  be  placed  with  Mr.  P,  who  readily  agreed  to  be  a  foster  care  placement  for  C.P.  He \nknew  he  could  provide  a  loving  home  for  at  least  one  of his  nephews.  ACS  visited  his  home  and \ndiscussed  certification.  An  ACS  caseworker  informed  Mr.  P.  that  he  was  cleared  for certification. \nMr.  P.  began  preparing  for  C.P.  by  speaking  with  his  landlord  about  possibly  renting  more  space \nfor the  two  of  them  as  well  as  coordinating  with  other  family  members  for the  care  of C.P.โs \nsiblings. \n106.  However,  after  two  weeks  of languishing  in  congregate  care,  ACS  refused  to \nplace  C.P.  with  Mr.  P.  An  ACS  caseworker  stated  that  ACS  would  not  certify  Mr.  P.  due  toa \n2017  misdemeanor conviction  for  Driving  Under  the  Influence,  a  conviction  not  included  on  the \nmandatory  exclusion  list.  Rather  than  using  its  discretion  to  certify  Mr.  P.  for  the  care  of C.P., \n29\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  30  of  74  PagelD  #:  30 \nACS  summarily  denied  him  based  on  the  conviction.  Although  Mr.  P.  was  willing  to  abide  by  an \norder  not  to  drive  with  C.P.  if he  was  placed  in  his  care,  ACS  reported  that  Mr.  P.  has  a \nโconviction  for  operating  a  motor  vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  or drugs,  a \nmisdemeanorโ  and  therefore  it  โhas  chosen  to  deny  Mr.  [P.]โs  application  to  be  a  foster  parent, \nwhich  it  has  discretion  to  do.โ \n107.  At  the  time  of Mr.  Pโs  conviction,  he  was  living  upstate,  working  and  going  to \nschool.  The  incident  did  not  involve  a  child,  no  one  was  injured,  and  there  was  no  damage  to  any \nvehicle.  Mr.  P.  regrets  the  acts  that  led  to  the  conviction  and  has  since  tried  very  hard  to  make \namends  for  the  incident,  including  enrolling  in  an  Impaired  Driving  Program. \n108.  ACS  did  not  provide  any  written  notice  of  the  denial  of certification  to  Mr.  P.  C.P. \nalso  did  not  receive  any  notice  denying  him  foster care  placement  with  his  uncle.  Nor  did  ACS \nprovide  any  opportunity  to  discuss  or  appeal  the  denial  of Mr.  P.โs  foster  parent  certification. \n109.  In  addition  to  Mr.  P.,  other  relative  resources  offered  to  care  for C.P.โs  siblings \nbut  they,  too,  were  denied  certification.  The  siblingsโ  aunt  was  denied  due  to  concerns  that  her \nliving  space  was  inadequate.  Another  relative  resource  was  denied  as  a  foster parent  for  the \nsiblings  โ  even  though  she  is  already  certified  as  a  foster  parent  for other  children  โ  because  the \nyoungest  sibling  has  special  needs  and  her  foster care  agency  does  not  provide  certification  for \nthe  level  of care  the  two  younger  siblings  require. \n110.  As  aresult,  after  three  weeks  in  the  large  Manhattan  shelter,  C.P.  and  his  three \nyounger  siblings  were  moved  into  two  separate  stranger  foster  homes.  Rather than  being  placed \nin  a  familiar,  loving  home  with  a  family  member  he  knows  and  trusts,  C.P.  is  now  living  in  a \nstrange  new  home  in  the  Bronx.  Although  C.P  was  initially  placed  in  the  foster home  with  his \nsister  and  one  of his  younger brothers,  his  brother  has  since  been  moved  to  his  brotherโs \n30\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  31  of  74  PagelD  #:  31 \nbiological  fatherโs  home.  C.P.  continues  to  be  separated  from  his  other  younger brother  and \nfamily  members.  Once  placed  in  a  stranger  foster  home,  C.P.  regressed  significantly  โ  needing \ndiapers,  even  though  he  has  long  been  potty-trained,  and  wetting  the  bed.  He  also  has  difficulty \nsleeping  because  he  has  become  afraid  of the  dark.  Recently,  it  was  identified  that  C.P.  needs \nadditional  educational  support  and  was  referred  for  individual  therapy. \n111.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiff C.P.  appears  by  his  next  friend,  Cynthia  Godsoe.  Ms.  Godsoe  is  familiar  with  the  issues \nregarding  C.P.โs  experience  under  ACS  custody  and  supervision  and  is  well  suited  to  represent \nC.P.โs  best  interests  in  this  case.  Ms.  Godsoe  is  a  Professor  of  Law  at  Brooklyn  Law  School \nwhere  she  teaches  courses  on  Family  Law  and  Children  and  the  Law.  She  also  represented \nchildren  for  several  years  in  New  York  Cityโs  Family  Court. \nNamed  Plaintiff  C.C. \n112.  C.C.  was  removed  from  her  motherโs  home  in  the  Bronx  in  October  2020  at  age \n12.  At  that  time,  she  was  placed  with  her  step-father  with  whom  she  lived  until  June  2021  when \nhe  could  no  longer care  for  her.  ACS  was  considering  placing  C.C.  in  a  congregate  facility,  but \nfortunately,  C.C.โs  aunt  and  uncle  stepped  up  to  care  for  her  at  this  critical  time. \n113.  Prior to  residing  with  her  aunt  and  uncle,  C.C.  was  struggling  with  online  school \nand  was  in jeopardy  of  repeating  8\"  grade.  She  frequently  missed  classes  and  was  failing  many \nof them.  Upon  placement  with  her  aunt  and  uncle,  C.C.  completely  turned  her  academic \nprogress  around.  Not  only  did  C.C.โs  attendance  and  grades  improve,  but  so  did  her  overall \nmorale:  C.C.  is  going  to be  the  next  president  of her  class.  Recently,  a  teacher called  from \nschool  to  let  the  family  know  how  well  C.C.  was  doing  in  school. \n31\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  32  of  74  PagelD  #:  32 \n114.  At  the  same  time,  ACS  reported  that  C.C.  was  โhappy  with  the  placementโ  with \nher  aunt  and  uncle.  C.C.  has  also  become  very  close  with  her cousin  who  also  lives  in  the  home. \nThe  two  act  like  sisters  and  C.C.โs  aunt  treats  them  as  such.  If her  aunt  buys  something  for  her \ndaughter,  she  buys  the  same  thing  for  C.C. \n115.  C.C.โs  aunt  ensures  that  C.C.  is  able  to  stay  connected  with  other  members  of  her \nfamily  โ  C.C.  speaks  to  her  father  on  the  phone  every  day  and  frequently  visits  extended  family, \nincluding  her grandmother  and  other  aunt.  C.C.  has  also  become  so  close  with  her  aunt  that  she \nis  now  calling  her  โmom.โ  This  is  important  because  as  a  court  ordered  evaluation  stated,  C.C. \nโstruggles  with  trustโ  after  โexperiences  of  abandonment,  betrayal  and  inconsistent  parenting \nexpectations  and  responses.โ  C.C.  has  experienced  โsignificant  trauma  exposure  including \nphysical  abuse  and  [her]  motherโs  ensuing  arrest,  witnessing  domestic  violence,  observing \ncommunity  violence,  bullying  in  school,  and  several  violent  and  non-violent  deaths.โ \n116.  Despite C.C.โs  progress  in  the care  of her  aunt  and  uncle,  ACS  denied  them  foster \nparent  certification.  Although  no  written  notice  of the  foster care  denial  was  provided  to  C.C.  or \nher  aunt  and  uncle,  an  ACS  caseworker reported  that  the denial  was  based  on  a  1996  drug \nrelated  conviction  and  an  SCR  record  from  a  decade  earlier.  C.C.โs  aunt  was  in  her  late  teens \nwhen  she  was  convicted  and  served  six  months.  She  has  not  had  any  other criminal  history  since \nthis  25-year-old  conviction,  and  has  now  raised  a  family  of her  own.  The  SCR  record  cited  by \nACS  stems  from  a  report  when  C.C.โs  aunt  served  as  a  foster  parent.  The  foster child  lived  with \nC.C.โs  aunt  for  three  years,  and  the  two  of  them  maintain  a  close  relationship  to  this  day  โ  her \naunt  even  becoming  the childโs  godmother.  Most  importantly,  however,  is  the  fact  that  the  SCR \ninvestigation  was  not  indicated  against  C.C.โs  aunt  but  rather  against  her  ex-husband  who  she \n32\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  33  of  74  PagelD  #:  33 \nno  longer  lives  with  or communicates  with.  Nonetheless,  there  is  no  process  for C.C.  to \nchallenge  the denial  of foster  home  placement  with  her  aunt. \n117.  Despite  its  refusal  to  certify  C.C.โs  aunt  and  uncle,  ACS  has  nevertheless \nrecognized  that  there  were  no  actual  safety  concerns  with  placing  C.C.  with  her  aunt  and  uncle \nand  opted  to  โdirectly  placeโ  her  in  their care  in  August  2021.  Her  aunt  and  uncle  desperately \nwant  to  keep  C.C.  in  their  home,  and  C.C.  desperately  wants  to  remain  there,  but  without  foster \ncare  funding  and  services  that  come  with  foster  home  placement,  the  family  is  struggling  to \nmanage  the  needs  of the  household.  C.C.โs  aunt  is  currently  unemployed,  and  the  lack  of \ncertification  prevents  C.C.  from  receiving  foster  care  Medicaid  or  the  Childcare  Services  and \nSupports.  Moreover,  C.C.โs  aunt  and  uncle  have  been  unable  to  obtain  food  stamps  on  behalf of \nC.C.  and  ACS  has  provided  no  assistance  to  the  family. \n118.  C.C.โs  aunt  has  asked  ACS  for  donations  and  requested  assistance  buying  clothes \nso  that  C.C.  doesnโt  have  to  wear  the  same  clothes  to  school  every  day.  The  family  also  must \nrely  on  food  pantries  to  ensure  there  is  enough  food  for  everyone.  It  was  recently  recommended \nthat  C.C.  receive  trauma  based  therapy,  which  ACS  could  more  quickly  and  readily  provide  if \nC.C.  were  in  a  kin  foster home.  While  ACS  acknowledges  the  obvious  benefits  of allowing  C.C. \nto  remain  with  her  aunt  and  uncle,  their  refusal  to  certify  them  as  foster  parents  is  contrary  to \nthe  best  interests  of C.C. \n119.  C.C.  โworries  about  her  placementโ  and  wishes  to  have  stability  in  her  life.  The \nfamily  worries  that  C.C.  would  run  away  if ACS  were  to  remove  her  from  their  home.  A court \nordered  evaluation  stated  that  it  was  โimperative  to  provide  [C.C.]  with  a  safe,  stable  and \npositive  home  environment.  An  unstable  unpredictable  care  plan  will  exacerbate  her  symptoms \nand  compromise  her capacity  to  improve.โ  It  is  clear  that  separating  C.C.  from  her  aunt  and \n33\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  34  of  74  PagelD  #:  34 \nuncle  would  be  traumatic  and  detrimental  to  C.C.โs  mental  health,  overall  wellbeing,  and  likely \nher  academic  performance. \n120.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiff C.C.  appears  by  her  next  friend,  Lisa  Hoyes.  Ms.  Hoyes  is  an  Assistant  Dean  at  New \nYork  University  School  of Law.  She  previously  represented  young  people  in  civil,  criminal  and \nfamily  court.  Ms.  Hoyes  is  familiar  with  the  issues  regarding  C.C.โs  experience  under ACS \ncustody  and  supervision  and  is  well  suited  to  represent  C.C.โs  best  interests  in  this  case. \nNamed  Plaintiffs  E.R..  A.R.  and  M.R. \n121.  In  October  2020,  ACS  removed  E.R.,  A.R.,  and  M.R.  (the  โR.  childrenโ)  from \ntheir  motherโs  care  in  Brooklyn.  After  ACS  removed  the  R.  children,  their  maternal \ngrandmother,  Ms.  G.,  requested  to  care  for  the  children.  Ms.  G.  stated  that  she  wanted  the \nchildren  with  her  in  lieu  of ACS  placing  them  in  a  strangerโs  home.  Ms.  G.  was  the  only  family \nmember  to  come  forward  and  request  that  the  children  be  placed  in  her care. \n122.  ACS  agreed  that  Ms.  G.โs  home  was  the  best  place  for  the  children  to  reside.  Ms. \nG.โs  only  hesitation  was  the  type  of  assistance  ACS  would  provide  her  to  help  care  for the  R. \nchildren.  Since  she  had  an  accident  in  spring  2020,  Ms.  G.  has  relied  on  public  benefits  to \nsupport  herself  and  other  family  members.  Ms.  G.  made  it  clear  to  ACS  that  it  would  be \nincredibly  difficult  for  her  to  stretch  her existing  resources  to  cover  the  cost  of caring  for  three \nyoung  children. \n123.  ACS  initially  agreed  in  October  2020  to  begin  the  foster  parent  certification \nprocess  of Ms.  G.  for  the  R.  children.  Ms.  G.  was  forthcoming  about  her  prior  history  involving  a \ncriminal  case  and  child  welfare  investigation  against  her.  Specifically,  in  2008,  Ms.  G.  was \n34\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  35  of  74  PagelD  #:  35 \narrested  for  robbery.  Although  she  maintained  her  innocence,  Ms.  G.  pled  guilty  to  the  robbery \ncharge  and  served  six  months  in  prison. \n124.  While  Ms.  G.  was  incarcerated,  ACS  opened  an  investigation  after  receiving  a \nreport  of neglect  of her  children.  Her  children  were  residing  with  their  father  in  another  state  but \nhe  had  voluntarily  placed  the  children  into  ACS  custody.  Even  though  Ms.  G.  was  incarcerated  at \nthe  time,  ACS  indicated  a  neglect  case  against  her  shortly  before  Ms.  G.  completed  her prison \nsentence.  It  is  unclear  what  ACSโs  basis  was  for  indicating  a  case  against  Ms.  G.  while  she  was \nincarcerated,  but  the  case  was  dismissed  in  family  court. \n125.  Knowing  Ms.  G.โs  prior  history,  ACS  still  agreed  to  proceed  with  the  process  of \nfoster  parent  certification  for  the  R.  children.  The  R.  children  continued  to  reside  in  Ms.  G.โs \nhome  and  the  family  was  under  the  impression  that  Ms.  G.  would  be certified  for  the  R.  children \nshortly.  However,  in  December  2020,  ACS  informed  the  family  that  it  would  not  certify  Ms.  G. \nfor the  R.  children  because  of her  criminal  conviction  and  SCR  record. \n126.  ACS  refused  to  provide  the  R.  children  or  Ms.  G.  with  written  notice  officially \ndenying  foster  care  certification.  Nor  is  there  any  process  for  the  children  to  challenge  ACSโs \ndecision.  Rather  than  being  placed  in  a  certified  kin  foster  home,  the  R.  children  were directly \nplaced  with  Ms.  G.  Direct  placement  was  โrequired  based  on  an  2008  conviction  unrelated  to \nchildren  or  violent  behavior  against  a person.โ  ACS  did  not  object  to  the  R.  children  remaining  in \nMs.  G.โs  home. \n127.  Despite  ACSโs  effective  acknowledgement  that  the  R.  children  are  best  cared  for \nin  Ms.  G.โs  home,  it  denies  them  needed  Childcare  Supports  and  Services  that  come  with  foster \nhome  placement.  As  a  result,  the  family  has  struggled  financially.  Other  than  some  clothes  for \n35\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  36  of  74  PagelD  #:  36 \nthe children  when  they  were  initially  placed  with  Ms.  G.,  ACS  has  not  provided  any  other \nassistance  to  the  children. \n128.  Ms.  G.  has  difficulty  covering  the  cost  of rent  with  her  public  assistance  and  Ms. \nG.โs  landlord  at  one  point  threatened  her  with  eviction.  She  was  unable  to  receive  rental \nassistance  from  public  funding  or  from  organizations  that  assist  tenants  with  covering  rent.  Ms. \nG.  occasionally  receives  money  from  friends,  but  that  has  merely  kept  her  and  the  R.  children \nabove  water. \n129.  Ms.  G.  remains  out  of work,  having  lost  her job  due  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic. \nThus,  Ms.  G.  is  forced  to  rely  upon  unemployment  payments  to  support  the  family  and  has  found \nherself struggling  to  feed  a  family  of six  with  limited  food  stamps  each  month. \n130.  Ms.  G.  works  hard  to  provide  a  loving  and  stable  home  for  the  R.  children.  She \nensures  the  children  do  their  homework  and  study  for  tests.  One  of the children  was  able  to \ndramatically  improve  her  grades  since  moving  in  with  Ms.  G.,  and  in  fact  now  has  a  100% \npassing  grade.  The  other  children  are  also  doing  extremely  well  under  Ms.  G.โs  care. \n131.  Ms.  G.  has  consistently  told  ACS  that  she  desperately  needs  the  Childcare \nSupports  and  Services  of  foster  home  certification  for the  R.  children.  Without  foster care \nsupport,  the  R.  childrenโs  placement  with  Ms.  G.  is  at  risk.  The  R.  childrenโs  long  standing \nrelationship  with  Ms.  G.,  as  well  as  the  recent  trauma of being  removed  from  their  motherโtheir \nsole  caretaker  since  birthโwould  make  removing  the  R.  children  from  Ms.  G.  devastating  for \nthe children. \n132.  Pursuant  to  Rule  17(c)(2)  of the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  Named \nPlaintiffs  R.  children  appear  by  their  next  friend,  Peggy  Cooper  Davis.  Ms.  Davis  is  familiar  with \nthe  issues  regarding  the  R.  childrenโs  experience  under  ACS  custody  and  supervision  and  is  well \n36\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  37  of  74  PagelD  #:  37 \nsuited  to  represent  the  R.  childrenโs  best  interests  in  this  case.  Ms.  Davis  is  a  Professor of Law  at \nNew  York  University  School  of Law.  She  also  previously  served  as  a judge  of the  Family  Court \nof the  State  of New  York. \nDEFENDANTS \n133.  Defendant  Governor  Hochul  is  the  Governor  of the  State  of  New  York  and  is  sued \nin  her official  capacity.  Under  N.Y.  CONST.  art  IV,  ยง  3,  the  Governor  is  required  to  execute  laws \nand,  therefore,  is  responsible  for ensuring  that  all  New  York  executive  departments  and  agencies, \nincluding  OCFS  and  the  local  departments  of social  services  that  OCFS  supervises,  such  as  ACS, \ncomply  with  all  applicable  federal  and  state  laws. \n134.  Defendant  Sheila  Poole  is  the  Commissioner  of  OCFS  and  is  sued  in  her  official \ncapacity.  OCFS  is  the executive  agency  responsible  for  programs  involving  foster  care,  adoption \nand  adoption  assistance  for children  in  New  York  State.  OCFS  is  responsible  for  overseeing \nACS  and  ensuring  that  ACS  complies  with  all  applicable  federal  and  state  laws.  As \nCommissioner,  Defendant  Poole  is  responsible  for  the  administration,  regulation,  and \nsupervision  of  the  child  welfare  system  in  the  State  of New  York.  Defendant  Poole  is  also \nresponsible  for providing  training  to  employees  of local  departments  of  social  services,  such  as \nACS,  with  regard  to  the  care  of children  removed  from  their  parents. \n135.  Defendant  the City  of New  York  (the  โCityโ)  is  a  municipal  entity  created  and \nauthorized  under  the  laws  of the  State  of New  York.  The  City  is  charged  with  certain  duties  and \nresponsibilities  under  the  Social  Services  Law  and  the  Family  Court  Act,  which  include,  but  are \nnot  limited  to,  the  care  and  protection  of  New  York  City  children.  The  City  carries  out  its \nresponsibilities  to  children  in  the  child  welfare  system  by  and  through  ACS,  and  is  authorized  by \nlaw  to  maintain  and  be  responsible  for  ACS.  ACS  delegates  the  care  of New  York  City  children \nin  foster  care  by  contract  to  26  foster  care  provider  agencies.  As  used  herein,  the  term  โACSโ \n37\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  38  of  74  PagelD  #:  38 \nincludes  both  ACS  and  the  agencies  under  contract  to  ACS.  Pursuant  to  its  Charter,  the  City  is \nresponsible  for  ensuring  that  ACS  complies  with  federal  and  state  law  and  regulation. \nJURISDICTION  AND  VENUE \n136.  This  action  is  brought  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983  to  redress  violations  of  the \nConstitution  of the  United  States.  This  Court  has  subject  matter jurisdiction  pursuant  to  28 \nU.S.C.  ยงยง  1331  and  1343(a)(3).  Each  of the  Defendants  is  a  resident  in,  or  organized  under  the \nlaws  of,  the  State  of New  York. \n137.

Venue  is  proper  in  this  District  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1391(b)  because  a \nsubstantial  part  of the events  or omissions  giving  rise  to  the  Plaintiffsโ  claims  occurred  in  this \ndistrict.  Additionally,  Defendants  OCFS  and  ACS  maintain  offices  in  the  Eastern  District  of New \nYork. \nFACTUAL  ALLEGATIONS \nA.  CHILDREN  IN  NEW  YORK  CITYโS  CHILD  WELFARE  SYSTEM \n139.  Almost  8,000  children  are  in  foster  care  in  New  York  City  under  the  custody  and \ncontrol  of  ACS.  In  Fiscal  Year  2020  alone,  3,094  children  were  removed  from  their  parentsโ \ncustody  due  to  allegations  of  abuse  or  neglect  and  entered  foster  care  in  New  York  City. \n140.  A  disproportionate  number  of children  in  foster care  in  New  York  City  are \nAfrican  American  and  Latinx.  African  American  children  enter  the  child  welfare  system  in \nnumbers  far  greater  than  their  proportion  of the  general  population.  For example,  while  African \nAmerican  children  represent  almost  21.6%  of  New  York  Cityโs  youth,  50%  of children  removed \nfrom  their parentsโ  custody  are  African  American.  Latinx  youth  in  NYC  are  5.6  times  more \n38\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  39  of  74  PagelD  #:  39 \nlikely  than  their  white  counterparts  to  be  admitted  into  foster  care.  And  over  80%  of children \nwho  remain  in  foster care  are  African  American  or  Latinx.  All  Named  Plaintiffs  are  children  of \ncolor. \n141.  There  is  also  a  disproportionate  number of low-income children  who  come  to  the \nattention  of the child  welfare  system.  Nationally,  nearly  half of families  who  have  children \nremoved  from  their  homes  have  trouble  paying  for  basic  necessities. \n142.  Families  often  come  to  the  attention  of  the  child  welfare  system  for  reasons \ndirectly  related  to  poverty.  According  to  one  study,  families  who  are  โbelow  the  poverty  line  are \n22  times  more  likely  to  be  involved  in  the  child  protection  system  than  families  with  incomes \nslightly  above  it.โ  This  is  partly  because  New  Yorkโs  definition  of  โneglectโ  closely  resembles \ncommon  experiences  of  impoverished  children.  Over  70%  of allegations  of child  maltreatment \nare  based  on  โneglect.โ \n143.  SCR  abuse  and  neglect  investigations  disproportionally  target  poor people  and \npeople  of color.  According  to  OCFS  data,  there  is  an  โextreme  disparityโ  in  the  ratio  of unique \nblack  and  Hispanic  children  in  SCR  reports  (per  1,000  black  and  Hispanic  children)  in  New  York \nCity  as  compared  to  the  rate  for  white  children.  The  community  districts  in  New  York  City  with \nthe  highest  rates  of child  poverty  have  rates  of  SCR  investigation  four  times  higher,  on  average, \nthan  the  districts  with  the  lowest  rates  of child  poverty.  And  among  districts  with  similar poverty \nrates,  those  with  higher concentrations  of African  American  and  Latinx  residents  tend  to  have \nhigher  rates  of SCR  investigations. \n144.  These  neighborhoods  with  the  highest  number of ACS  cases  have  the  lowest \nincomes,  highest  unemployment,  and  greatest  income-to-rent  disparities  in  the  city.  In  some  of \n39\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  40  of  74  PagelD  #:  40 \nthese  neighborhoods,  the  child  poverty  rate  is  over  80%.  Many  of  these  neighborhoods  are  also \nthe  biggest  sources  of  families  entering  homeless  shelters. \nB.  THE  IMPORTANCE  OF  KIN  CAREGIVERS  TO  THE  WELL-BEING  OF \nCHILDREN  REMOVED  FROM  THEIR  PARENTS  BY  ACS \n145.  As  child  welfare  practitioners  know  and  social  science  research  confirms,  forcibly \nseparating  children  from  their parents  โ  even  where  removal  from  the  home  is  necessary  โ  can \nhave  lifelong  negative  consequences  to  the  childโs  physical  and  emotional  health  and  wellbeing. \nFor  the  thousands  of children  removed  from  their parents  and  taken  into  ACS  custody,  the \nexperience  can  be  extraordinarily  traumatizing. \n146.  The data  with  regard  to  the  impact  foster  care  has  on  children,  both  nationally  and \nlocally  in  New  York  City,  is  grim.  Children  who  have  spent  time  in  stranger  foster care  have \npoorer  school  performance  and  are  more  susceptible  to  homelessness,  arrest,  chemical \ndependency,  and  mental  and  physical  illness  than  socioeconomically  similar children  who  have \nnever  been  removed  from  their  homes. \n147.  In  New  York,  children  are  particularly  vulnerable.  Federal  data  demonstrates  that \nchildren  in  foster  care  are  at  a  higher risk  of  maltreatment  than  almost  anywhere  else  in  the \ncountry.  Indeed,  New  York  State  ranks  the  third  worst  for  rates  of substantiated  reports  of \nmaltreatment  of children  in  foster care. \n148.  The  outlook  is  considerably  brighter  for  children  placed  with  Kin  Caregivers. \nSocial  science  research  establishes  that  placing  a  child  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  eases  the  trauma  of \nfamily  separation,  minimizes  the  need  for  the  child  to  adjust  to  an  entirely  new  environment,  and \nreduces  the  likelihood  that  a  child  will  develop  behavioral  and  psychological  disorders.  Children \nin  kinship  foster placements  are  two  times  more  likely  than  those  in  stranger  foster  homes  to \nreport  positive  emotional  health. \n40\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  41  of  74  PagelD  #:  41 \n149.  For  a  child,  the  opportunity  to  live  with  a  Kin  Caregiver can  provide  a \ndramatically  better  outcome  than  stranger  foster  care  and  can  allow  the  child  to  maintain  a  sense \nof โnormalcyโ  after  removal  from  a  parent.  It  may  mean  the  child  continues  to  live  with  someone \nto  whom  the  child  has  been  close  throughout  her  life,  an  adult  who  has  played  a  major  role  in  her \nchildhood,  and/or  someone  who  has  been  a  part  of  her  family  support  system.  These  adults  can \nbe  a  childโs  lifeline  during  a  traumatic  period  of change. \n150.  As  the  federal  Childrenโs  Bureau  has  found,  โ[k]inship  care  can  reduce  the  trauma \nthat  children  may  have  previously  endured  and  the  trauma  that  accompanies  parental  separation \nby  providing  them  with  a  sense  of stability  and  belonging  in  an  otherwise  unsettling  time.โ  The \nKin  Caregiver  may  also  feel  a  sense  of commitment  to  the  child  as  a  result  of  their  relationship \nwith  the  child,  the childโs  parent(s),  and/or  the  larger  family. \n151.  Children  placed  with  Kin  Caregivers  are  more  likely  to  be  placed  with  their \nsiblings  and  close  to  their  homes  than  children  in  the  general  foster  care  population.  In  New \nYork  City,  ACS  data  indicates  that  32%  of children  initially  placed  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  are \nplaced  within  their  home  community  district,  as  compared  to  only  14%  of children  placed  in \nstranger  foster  homes. \n152.  Children  in  foster  care  do  better  when  they  are  not  moved  from  foster  placement \nto  foster  placement,  but  rather  have  a  stable  placement.  Research  establishes  that  children  in \nkinship  placements  experience  more  stability  than  those  in  stranger  care.  An  analysis  of  ACS \ndata  shows  that  in  New  York  City,  children  in  stranger care  experience  approximately  three \ntimes  as  many  placement  moves  as  children  in  kinship  placements.  This  data  mirrors  research \nshowing  that  children  in  foster  care  are  2.6  times  more  likely  than  children  in  kinship  care  to \nhave  3  or  more  placements  and  are  1.9  times  more  likely  to  experience  a  placement  disruption. \n41\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  42  of  74  PagelD  #:  42 \n153.  Children  in  kinship  foster placements  are  less  likely  to  age  out  of  foster  care \nwithout  a permanent  home โ  whether  through  reunification  with  their  parent(s),  adoption,  or \nguardianship  โ  than  children  in  stranger  foster homes.  Children  in  kinship  foster  care  are  more \nlikely  to  report  liking  their  placement  and  wanting  it  to  become  permanent.  A  permanent  home  is \ncritical  to  the  long-term  safety  and  well-being  of children,  and  can  prevent  homelessness,  sexual \nexploitation,  and  unemployment. \n154.  Children  can  achieve  permanency  with  Kin  Caregivers  in  several  ways.  Adoption \nby  a  Kin  Caregiver  allows  children  to  permanently  remain  in  a  familiar,  safe  and  loving  home. \nThe child  can  maintain  connections  with  their  family  and  community  while  also  receiving \nmonthly  subsidies  and  medical  assistance.  Likewise,  their  Kin  Caregiver  receives  parenting \nsupport  for  their  care. \n155.  Alternatively,  placement  in  foster care  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  also  opens  up  the \npossibility  of permanency  through  KinGAP.  KinGAP  can  be  appealing  for  a child  and  Kin \nCaregiver because  it  does  not  require  termination  of parental  rights,  a  process  that  can  be \nemotionally  fraught  for  the  child,  parent  and  kin.  Under  KinGAP,  the  Kin  Caregiver  holds  legal \nresponsibility  for  the  care,  control  and  supervision  of  the  child  and  receives  a  subsidy \ncomparable  to  the  adoption  subsidy.*  To  be  eligible  for  KinGAP,  the  Kin  Caregiver  must  have \nbeen  the  childโs  foster parent  for  at  least  six  months. \n156.  New  York  State  uses  an  expanded  definition  of  kin,  including  fictive  kin,  for \npurposes  of foster parent  certification  and  KinGAP.  In  defining  kin  broadly,  New  York \n  \n* The  amount of the  kinship guardianship  assistance payment and of the  adoption  subsidy  payment  ranges  from  75% \nto  100% of the  foster care  rate. \n42\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  43  of  74  PagelD  #:  43 \nrecognized  that  many  children  are  raised  in  non-traditional  families,  and  benefit  from  including \nnon-traditional  family  members  in  their  long  term  planning  in  order  to  preserve  familial  bonds.* \nC.  NEW  YORKโS  STATUTORY  AND  REGULATORY  SCHEME  FOR \nCERTIFYING  KIN  CAREGIVERS  AS  FOSTER  PARENTS  AND ADOPTIVE \nPARENTS \n157.  In  recognition  of the  importance  of keeping  a  child  with  family  and  minimizing \ntrauma,  ACS  is  required  to  make  diligent  efforts  to  find  a  Kin  Caregiver  able  to  care  for  the  child \nwhen  it  removes  a  child  from  their parent(s).  Specifically,  OCFS  regulations  require  ACS  to  act \ndiligently  to  identify  the  childโs  grandparents,  all  parents  of  a  sibling  or  half-sibling  of the  child \nwhere  such  parent  has  legal  custody  of  the  sibling,  and  other  adult  relatives,  including  adult \nrelatives  suggested  by  the  childโs  parent(s),  within  30  days.โ  ACS  must  then  notify  these  relatives \nthat  the  child  has  been  or  is  being  removed  from  the  childโs  parents  and  explain  options  for  the \nchildโs  care  to  the  Kin  Caregiver. \n158.  Because  most  Kin  Caregivers  for  the  Plaintiff Class  do  not  have  the  ability  to  care \nfor  a  child  without  Childcare  Services  and  Supports,  when  ACS  identifies  a  potential  Kin \nCaregiver,  they  usually  work  to  certify  the  Kin  Caregiver  as  a  foster  parent.  New  York  state  law \nand  OCFS  regulations  dictate  the  process  by  which  any  person,  including  a  Kin  Caregiver,  can \nbe  certified  as  a  foster parent.ยฎ  Similarly,  in  order  to  serve  as  a  potential  adoptive  parent,  a  Kin \nCaregiver  must  go  through  the  adoptive  parent  approval  process. \n  \n* New  York  law defines  kin  to  include  any  individual  related to a  half-sibling of the child  through blood,  marriage or \nadoption  and  where  such  person  is  also the  prospective  or appointed  relative guardian of such  half-sibling  or an \nadult with  a  pre-existing  positive relationship  with  the child  including,  but not  limited to,  a step-parent,  godparent, \nneighbor or family  friend. \n>In  2020,  OCFS  issued  an  administrative directive  regarding  Kin  First Firewall  practice,  which  further outlined  the \nsteps  that  local departments  of social  services,  such  as ACS,  must  take  to  identify  and engage  kin.  The  directive  also \nput  into place a  review  process  to ensure that all  kin  foster  placements  had been considered. \nยฎ While  the  Kin Caregiverโs  application  for foster parent certification  is  in  process,  the  child  may be  temporarily \nplaced  with  the  Kin Caregiver,  subject  to an  emergency  ACS  review  of the  home.  If the child  is temporarily  placed, \nthe  Kin Caregiver may be  provided Childcare  Services  and  Supports  while  the  application  is  pending.  If certification \nof the  Kin  Caregiver is denied,  ACS  must  initiate  a  plan  to remove  the child  from  the  home. \n43\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  44  of  74  PagelD  #:  44 \n159.  During  the  certification  and  approval  process,  ACS  is  required  to  collect  detailed \ninformation  about  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  household,  and  determine  if the  specified  physical,  health, \nand  safety  requirements  are  met.  In  addition,  ACS  must  request  SCR  records  for  a  childโs  Kin \nCaregiver  and  all  adult  household  members  from  OCFS.  ACS  must  also  obtain  the  fingerprints \nof the  Kin  Caregiver  and  all  adult  household  members  and  submit  them  to  OCFS.  OCFS  then \nrequests  a  criminal  history  check  from  the  New  York  State  Division  of Criminal  Justice  Services \n(DCJS)  and  the  Federal  Bureau  of Investigation  (FBI). \n160.  OCFS  provides  ACS  with  a  summary  of any  SCR  record  as  well  as  of  the \ncriminal  history  record.  Regarding  the  criminal  history  record,  OCFS  also  notifies  ACS  whether, \nbased  on  the  history,  the  application  must  be  denied  (due  to  mandatory  disqualification),  must  be \nheld  in  abeyance  pending  subsequent  notification  from  OCFS,โ  or  may  proceed.  If OCFS  does \nnot  find  a  conviction  that  qualifies  as  a  mandatory  disqualifying  crime,  ACS  has  the  discretion  to \ncertify  the  Kin  Caregiver  for  the  foster care  placement  or  adoption  of a  child.  OCFS  provides  no \nguidance  as  to  the  exercise  of this  discretion. \n161.  Ifthe  Kin  Caregiver  is  ultimately  certified  as  a  foster parent,  the  family  receives \nChildcare  Services  and  Supports.  The  Supports  include  maintenance  payments  intended  to \nreimburse  the  family  for  the  cost  of caring  for  the  child  and  various  allowances  that  benefit  the \nchild,  such  as  transportation,  clothing  allowance,  school  related  expenses  and  miscellaneous \nexpenses  of growing  up  in  New  York  City. The  Services  include  coordination  and  provision  of \nservices  for the childโs  medical,  mental  health,  and  scholastic  needs,  and  training  to  assist  in \nproviding  proper care  for  the  child.  If the  child  has  special  needs,  a  Kin  Caregiver  may  be  able  to \n  \nโ  A  final  determination  of an  application  for certification or  approval of a Kin  Caregiver  must be  held  in  abeyance  if \nthe  Kin Caregiverโs criminal  history record  reveals  a pending  charge  for a mandatory  disqualifying crime  or when \nthere  is  uncertainty as  to whether  a conviction  falls  into  one of the  categories  listed  above. \noe\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  45  of  74  PagelD  #:  45 \nbe  certified  as  a  therapeutic  foster  home  and  receive  enhanced  payment  and  services  from  ACS \nand  specialized,  ongoing  training  to  assist  in  caring  for  the  child. \n162.  Moreover,  children  in  foster  care  are  automatically  eligible  for  Medicaid  which \nprovides  enormous  assistance  in  caring  for  the  childโs  physical  and  psychological  health.*  With \nMedicaid,  children  receive  well-child  care,  immunization,  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  illness  and \ninjury,  dental  care,  vision  care  as  well  as  any  needed  emergency  or  special  care  and  treatment. \n163.  Likewise,  if approved  as  an  adoptive  parent,  the  family  receives  an  adoption \nsubsidy,  caseworker  supervision  prior  to  finalization  of the  adoption,  and  post-adoption  services. \nFamilies  are  also  eligible  for  an  adoption  tax  credit.  Post-adoption  services  may  include \ncounseling,  caregiver  training,  clinical  and  consultative  services,  and  coordinating  access  to \ncommunity  supportive  services  for the  purpose  of ensuring  permanence  of placement.  These \nservices  may  extend  for  three  years  after the date  of the  adoption  and  can  be a lifeline,  especially \nfor  families  that  need  help  to  address  their  childrenโs  mental  health  issues  or other problems. \nThe  Defendantsโ  Disqualification  Systems \n164.  Before  2008,  all  children  in  New  York  were  entitled  under  state  law  to  an \nindividualized  assessment  of  all  potential  foster  and  adoptive  parent  applicants.  There  were  no \nmandatory  disqualifying  crimes.  However,  in  2008,  the  Defendants  began  to  adopt  and \nimplement  the  Disqualification  Systems  that  deprive  the  Plaintiff class  of their  constitutional \nrights.โ \n  \n*  All children  in  foster care  in  NYS  who  are citizens  or qualified  immigrants  are  Medicaid  eligible. \nยฐ In  2008,  the  federal government began  to condition  statesโ  receipt  of funding  under Title  IV-E  of the  Social \nSecurity  Act  (42  U.S.C.  ยงยง  671-679b) on  their automatic disqualification of proposed  foster  and  adoptive  parents \nwho had been convicted of certain  categories of crimes.  OCFSโs determination  of which crimes  fall  into each of the \nfederally  designated categories  is  more expansive  than  those  used  in  many  other  states. \n45\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  46  of  74  PagelD  #:  46 \nMandatory  Disqualification  System \n165.  Under  state  law,  if  a childโs  Kin  Caregiver  has  been  convicted  of certain  felony \ncrimes  the  Kin  Caregiver  is  ineligible  to  be  the  childโs  foster  or  adoptive  parent  and  their \napplication  must  be  denied.  As  a  result,  the  child  is  automatically  denied  foster  or  adoptive \nplacement  with  that  Kin  Caregiver,  regardless  of the  nature  and  duration  of the  relationship \nbetween  them  and  regardless  of whether  the  conviction  has  any  bearing  on  the  Kin  Caregiverโs \ncurrent  ability  to  care  for  their relative  child. \n166.  Specifically,  NY  Social  Services  Law  ยง  378-a(2)(e)(1) requires  that  โโan \napplication  for certification  or  approval  of  a prospective  foster  parent  or  prospective  adoptive \nparent  shall  be  denied  and  ...  an  agreement  to  provide  payments  to  a prospective  successor \nguardian  ...  shall  not  be  approved  ...  where  a  criminal  history  record  of the  [applicant]  ... \nreveals  a conviction  for:  (A)  a  felony  conviction  at any  time  involving:  (1)  child  abuse  or  neglect; \n(11)  spousal  abuse;  (i11)  a  crime  against  a  child,  including  child  pornography;  or  (iv)  a crime \ninvolving  violence,  including  rape,  sexual  assault,  or  homicide,  other  than  a  crime  involving \nphysical  assault  or  battery;  or  (B)  a  felony  conviction  within  the  past  five  years  for physical \nassault,  battery,  or  a drug  related  offenseโ  (emphasis  added). \n167.  OCEFS  broadly  defines  the  crimes  falling  within  the  statuteโs  categories.  As  of \nMarch  2016,  OCFS  had  designated  nearly  300  felonies  that  require  lifetime  mandatory \ndisqualification,  including  certain  โattemptedโ  felonies.  There  are  approximately  40  other \nfelonies,  including  certain  drug  possession  offenses,  that  require  a  five  year  mandatory \ndisqualification. \n168.  These  disqualifying  felony  crimes  include  Criminal  Possession  of Marijuana, \nFalsely  Reporting  an  Incident,  Second  Degree  Vehicular Manslaughter  and  Criminal  Possession \nof a  Weapon.  Under  OCFS  policy,  a  felony  conviction  for  an  attempt  to  commit  a  disqualifying \n46\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  47  of  74  PagelD  #:  47 \ncrime  (other  than  a  Class  E  felony)  is  also  a  disqualifying  crime.  These  crimes  result  in \nautomatic  disqualification  regardless  of how  long  ago  they  occurred,  and  regardless  of how \nsuccessfully  the  Kin  Caregiver  has  been  rehabilitated.  Assault,  battery  and  drug  related \nconvictions  must  be  within  the  past  five  years  to  result  in  automatic  disqualification. \n169.  While  the  exact  number  of children  denied  kin  foster  or  adoptive  homes  as  a \nresult  of  mandatory  disqualifying  convictions  is  unknown  to  the  Named  Plaintiffs, 10  criminal \nconviction  data  hints  at  the  potential  sweeping  impact  of this  Mandatory  Disqualification \nSystem.  In  2019  alone,  over  20,000  adults  were  convicted  of  a  felony  in  New  York  State  that \nwould  bar  them  from  ever becoming  a  foster or  adoptive  parent,  regardless  of  the  existing \nrelationship  they  have  with  the  child.  Another  18,385  were  convicted  of  a  drug  offense, \nincluding  convictions  for  possession  of marijuana,  which  would  bar  them  from  being  a  foster or \nadoptive  parent  within  five  years  of their  application. \n170.  This  same  data  reveals  that  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  disqualification  practices \nhave  a  disproportionate  impact  on  families  of color  and  serve  to  reinforce  other discriminatory \ngovernment  practices.  In  New  York,  disproportionate  minority  contact  with  police,  systemic \nracism,  and  poverty  lead  to  a  higher conviction  and  incarceration  rate  for  African  Americans.  For \nexample,  in  2018  in  New  York  City  alone,  4,458  African  American  New  Yorkers  were  convicted \nof a  felony  as  compared  to  902  white  New  Yorkers.  African  Americans  make  up  only  16%  of the \ntotal  population  in  New  York  State,  yet  they  comprise  53%  of the  incarcerated  population. \n171.  Apart  from  challenging  the  accuracy  of  the  criminal  record,  a  Kin  Caregiver  with \na  mandatory  disqualifying  conviction  has  no  recourse  in  order  to  be certified  as  a  foster  parent  or \n  \n' Tn  response  to an  April  2018  Freedom of Information  Law  request,  OCFS  confirmed  that  it  does  not categorize, \ndefine or tally  this data or  similar data  on children  whose  prospective  kin  foster  parent  had  a discretionary \ndisqualifying  crime or  SCR  history. \n47\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  48  of  74  PagelD  #:  48 \napproved  as  an  adoptive  parent.''  There  is  no  procedure  for  the  child  or  anyone  acting  on  the \nchildโs  behalf  to  challenge  ACSโs  denial  of  foster  care  or  adoption  approval  when  their  Kin \nCaregiver  has  a  mandatory  disqualifying  conviction.'* \nThe Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System \n172.  ACS  may  deny  achild  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver if the  kinโs  criminal \nhistory  record  reveals  a  charge  (even  if the  charge  resulted  in  no  conviction)  or  a  conviction  for \nany  other crime  at  any  point  in  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  past  other  than  those  categorized  as \nmandatory  disqualifiers.  ACS  may  also  deny  a  Kin  Caregiverโs  application  based  upon  any \ncriminal  record  of any  other  household  member  over  18,  including  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  own \nchildren.'? \n173.  While  the  exact  number  of children  denied  kin  foster  or  adoptive  homes  as  a \nresult  of  the  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System  is  unknown  to  the  Named \nPlaintiffs,  the  potential  impact  of this  problem  is  exemplified  by  criminal  conviction  data.  In \n2017  alone,  155,326  adults  in  New  York  State  were convicted  of discretionary  disqualifying \ncrimes  that  could  be  the  basis  for ACS  to  deny  a  foster or  adoptive  parent  application. \n174.  Neither  OCFS  nor  ACS  provides  guidance  on  how  ACS  should  appropriately \nexercise  discretion  if  a  discretionary  disqualifying  conviction  exists.  As  a  result,  ACS  makes \n  \n'  ACS  must  only  provide the  Kin Caregiver  with  a written  statement  setting  forth  the reasons  for the  denial, \nincluding  a summary  of the criminal  history  record  provided by OCFS, and  offer  a meeting  to discuss  the denial. \nACS  must  provide  the  Kin Caregiver  with  a description of the  DCJS  and  FBI  record  review  process,  which  allows \nthe  Kin Caregiver to contact DCJS  or the FBI  to  correct  errors  in  the  record.  Although  adoptive  parents  may  seek a \nfair hearing  if their  application  is denied,  in  cases  where  the denial  is  based  on  a mandatory  disqualifying conviction, \nthere  is  no  available  relief. \n'2 If the  Kin  Caregiver is disqualified  for a mandatory disqualifying crime  involving  spousal  abuse,  he or she can \napply  for a  fair  hearing  on  the grounds  that  he or she  was  the  victim of physical,  sexual  or  psychological  abuse by \nthe  victim of such offense and  such  abuse  was a  factor  in causing  the  Kin Caregiver to  commit  such  offense. \n'3 Tf the  child  is  temporarily  placed  with  the  Kin Caregiver and the criminal  history  record of the  Kin Caregiver or  an \nadult household  member reveals  a discretionary  disqualifying conviction,  state  law  requires  ACS  to  conduct  a safety \nassessment of the  home  in order to determine  whether  to proceed  with  foster  parent  certification  or adoption \napproval  of the  Kin Caregiver. \n48\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  49  of  74  PagelD  #:  49 \ninconsistent  determinations  and  routinely  deprives  the  Plaintiff Class  of placement  with  Kin \nCaregivers  due  to  discretionary  disqualifying  criminal  history  notwithstanding  their  current \nability  to  provide  a  safe  home  for  their  relative  child. \n175.  OCFS  requires  ACS  to  provide  the  Kin  Caregiver  with  a  written  statement  setting \nforth  the  reasons  for  the  denial,  offer  a  meeting  to  discuss  the  denial,  and  provide  information \nabout  the  DCJS  and  FBI  review  process  for  purposes  of correcting  factual  errors  in  the  criminal \nrecord.  If the  Kin  Caregiver  is  a  prospective  foster  parent,  neither  ACS  nor  OCFS  offer  them  any \nfurther opportunity  to  challenge  the  denial.  If the  Kin  Caregiver  is  a  prospective  adoptive  parent \nand  their  application  is  denied  they  may  request  a  fair  hearing.  For  both  foster  and  adoptive \nplacement  denials,  there  is  no  opportunity  for  the  child  to  challenge  the  decision. \nThe  SCR  Disqualification  System \n176.  As  part  of the  foster  or  adoptive  parent  application,  a  Kin  Caregiver  and  any \nperson  18  years  of age  or  older  residing  in  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  home  must  consent  to  an  ACS \nreview  of the  SCR  records  pertaining  to  them. \n177.  New  Yorkโs  SCR  includes  all  investigations  of reports  of  maltreatment  of \nchildren,  regardless  of the  outcome  of the  investigation.  Anyone  can  make a  report  to  the  SCR \nfor  investigation  and  reports  can  be  made  anonymously.  As  discussed  below,  there  are  numerous \nproblems  with  New  Yorkโs  SCR.  The  SCR  currently  has  one  of the  lowest  standards  of evidence \nto  place  an  individual  on  the  registry,  requiring  only  โsome  credible  evidence.โ'*  An  โindicatedโ \nreport  does  not  reflect  whether  a  petition  was  ever  filed  against  the  person  in  Family  Court,  nor \n  \n'* Recognizing  the  problems  with  the  SCR,  the  New  York  State  Legislature  passed  several  reforms  to the  registry as \npart of the  2020-2021  state budget.  The new  legislation  raises  the  standard  for an  indicated case  from  โsome credible \nevidenceโ  to a โpreponderance of the  evidenceโ  and requires that every Fair Hearing  challenging  the  indication \ninclude  an  assessment of rehabilitation.  In  addition,  if you  prevail  in  your Family Court case,  your record  in  the  SCR \nis  amended and  sealed,  and  records of neglect cases  will  now  automatically  be  sealed at  8  years.  Unfortunately, \nthese  historic  reforms  will  not go  into effect  until January  2022  and many  of the changes  are not retroactive.  It  is \nalso unclear whether  ACS  will  still  have  access  to  records once  they  are  sealed. \n49\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  50  of  74  PagelD  #:  50 \ndoes  it  reflect  whether  the  Family  Court  ever  issued  a  finding  against  the  person  for  abuse  or \nneglect.  And  once  a report  is  added  to  the  SCR  database,  it  remains  there  for  ten  years  after  the \n18th  birthday  of the  youngest  child  listed  in  the  report  โ  which  can  be  up  to  28  years. \n178.  The  SCR  system  has  a racially  disproportionate  impact  on  Black  and  Latinx  New \nYorkers.  African  American  children  in  NYC  are  6.2  times  more  likely  to  be  reported  to  the  SCR \nas  white  children,  the  report  is  7.8  times  more  likely  to  be  indicated,  and  the  child  is  12.8  times \nmore  likely  to  be  admitted  into  foster  care,  according  to  2014  OCFS  data.  Latinx  children  in \nNYC  are  also  more  likely  to  be  implicated  in  an  SCR  record  when  compared  to  their  white \ncounterparts  and  are  5.4  times  more  likely  to  be  involved  in  an  indicated  case. \n179.  Nonetheless,  OCFS  regulations  require  that  ACS  review  these  SCR  records  in \nassessing  a childโs  Kin  Caregiver  for  a  foster  or  adoptive  placement.  For  foster  care  placement, \nOCFS  Administrative  Directive  requires  ACS  to  take  additional  steps  if the  SCR  review  reveals \nthat  the  Kin  Caregiver  or  adult  household  member  is  a confirmed  subject  of an  indicated  report, \nincluding  requesting  the  underlying  investigation  records,  in  order  to  have  โcomplete  and \naccurate  information,โ  determine  whether  the  information  is  โrelevant  and  reasonably  related,โ \nand  โmake  an  informed  decisionโ  regarding  certification  of the  home.  Despite  this  OCFS \nrequirement,  upon  information  and  belief,  ACS  rarely  requests  these  underlying  documents. \n180.  OCFS  has  also  provided  guidance  as  to  what  ACS  should  consider  when \nevaluating  whether  the  SCR  record  of  an  applicant  or  household  member  should  prevent  foster \nparent  certification  of the  home.  These  factors  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  seriousness  of \nthe  incident  involved  in  the  report;  the  relevant  circumstances  surrounding  the  report;  the  time \nelapsed  since  the  most  recent  incident;  and  information  regarding  the  applicantโs  rehabilitation. \n50\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  51  of  74  PagelD  #:  51 \n181.  Despite  this  guidance,  OCFS  fails  to  oversee  and  ensure  that  ACS  relies  upon  its \nguidance  in  exercising  discretion  to  certify  Kin  Caregivers  as  foster  parents. \n182.  OCFS  also  fails  to  provide  any  guidance  or oversight  over the  exercise  of \ndiscretion  in  assessing  adoptive  placements  with  Kin  Caregivers  who  have  a  SCR  record. \n183.  While  the  exact  number  of children  denied  placement  with  Kin  Caregivers  based \non  SCR  history  is  unknown  to  the  Named  Plaintiffs,  the  potentially  enormous  impact  of SCR \nrecords  on  certification  and  approval  decisions  is  suggested  by  SCR  data.  In  2019,  for example, \nthere  were  54,879  SCR  investigations  in  New  York  City  alone,  of which  37.2%  resulted  in \nindicated  reports.  As  such,  a  SCR  record  โ  supported  by  โsome credible  evidenceโ  โ  has  the \npotential  to  disqualify  a  large  number  of  potential  foster  parents,  many  of  whom  may  be  well- \nsuited  to  care  for  their  kin. \n184.  Ifthe  Kin  Caregiverโs  application  is  denied,  ACS  is  required  to  furnish  the  Kin \nCaregiver  with  notice  setting  forth  its  reason(s)  for the  denial,  including  whether  the  denial  is \nbased  in  whole  or  in  part  on  the  existence  of an  indicated  SCR  report.  The  notice  must  also \ninform  the  Kin  Caregiver  that  he  or  she  has  the  right,  pursuant  to  Social  Services  Law  424-a,  to \nrequest  a  hearing  before  OCFS  regarding  the  SCR  record.  The  child  is  not  entitled  to  notice  or  a \nhearing. \n185.  The  OCFS  hearing  offered  to  the  Kin  Caregiver  is  not  an  opportunity  to  review \nthe denial  itself,  but  only  whether  the  Kin  Caregiver  has  been  shown  by  a  fair preponderance  of \nthe evidence  to  have  committed  the  act  or  acts  of child  abuse  or  maltreatment  giving  rise  to  the \nindicated  SCR  report.  The  Kin  Caregiver  cannot  present  any  evidence  of rehabilitation  or \nevidence  demonstrating  that  the  record  has  no  bearing  on  his  or  her  ability  to  be  a  suitable  foster \n51\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  52  of  74  PagelD  #:  52 \nor  adoptive  parent.'?  The  child  has  no  right  to  an  OCFS  hearing  or  any  opportunity  to  have  the \ndenial  of his  or  her  foster care  or  adoptive  placement  reviewed. \n186.  In  some  instances,  ACS  places  a  child  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  on  a  temporary \nemergency  basis  and  conducts  a  preliminary  emergency  evaluation  of  the  home,  until  a  full \nevaluation  can  be  completed.  If,  in  doing  so,  ACS  concludes  that  an  SCR  record  precludes  a  Kin \nCaregiver  from  emergency  certification,  ACS  does  not  provide  the  Kin  Caregiver  or child  with \nany  written  notice.  ACS  also  refuses  to  refer  the  Kin  Caregiver  for  full  foster  care certification. \nIn  doing  so,  ACS  simultaneously  denies  the  child  foster care  placement  with  the  Kin  Caregiver \nwithout  a  meaningful  assessment  and  fails  to  provide  written  notice  to  the  child  or  Kin \nCaregiver. \nD.  DEFENDANTSโ  DISQUALIFICATION  SYSTEMS  VIOLATE  THE  PLAINTIFF \nCLASSโS  SUBSTANTIVE  AND  PROCEDURAL  DUE  PROCESS  RIGHTS \n187.  The  Plaintiff Class  has  a  fundamental  right  under  the  Constitution  of  the  United \nStates  to  the  preservation  of family  association  and  integrity,  to  be  free  from  unnecessary  and \nunreasonable  intrusion  into  their  mental  and  emotional  stability  and  well-being,  and  to  be  under \ngovernment  care  or  supervision  no  longer  than  is  necessary.  The  Plaintiff Class  also  has  a \nconstitutional  right  to  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge  any  denial  of their  rights. \nDefendantsโ  Disqualification  Systems  violate  these  fundamental  rights. \n188.  Asa  direct  result  of Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  Disqualification  Systems, \nthousands  of  New  York  City  children  have  been  or  will  be  denied  safe  foster  or  adoptive \nplacements  with  loving  Kin  Caregivers.  Defendantsโ  disqualification  policies  and  practices \n  \n'S Even  if,  as  a result of the  hearing,  it  is  determined  that OCFS  has  failed  to  show  by  a fair preponderance of the \nevidence  that the  Kin Caregiver committed  the  act or  acts  upon  which the  indicated  report  is based,  ACS  still  has \ncomplete  discretion  whether to certify the  home. \n52\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  53  of  74  PagelD  #:  53 \nsubject  all  Plaintiff Class  to  an  undue  risk  of emotional  and  psychological  harm  and  further  the \ntrauma of parental  removal.'ยฎ \n189.  Because  potential  adoptive  parents  face  the  same  barriers  as  potential  foster \nparents,  Defendantsโ  unconstitutional  disqualification  policies  and  practices  are  further  violating \nthe  Plaintiff Classโs  due  process  rights  by  preventing  them  from  achieving  permanency  and \nstability  through  adoption  by  Kin  Caregivers. \n190.  Defendants  are  aware  of  the  harm  to  the  Plaintiff Class  when  they  deny  children \nplacement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  as  a result  of their  disqualification  policies  and  practices.  As  set \nforth  above,  the  Plaintiff Class  who  could  have  been  placed  with  loving,  familiar  relatives  are \ninstead  thrust  into  stranger  foster  care  or  institutional  group  care  or  are  left  without  necessary \nservices  and  supports.  Families  are  at  times  advised  to  further  split  up,  having  the  household \nmember  with  the  conviction  leave  the  home,  in  order  to  attain  ACS  approval.  After  the  trauma  of \nseparation  from  their parent(s),  the  Plaintiff Class  is  further  harmed  by  the  denial  of placement \nwith  their  Kin  Caregiver or  their  actual  or  threatened  removal  from  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  home. \n191.  Indeed,  it  is  often  undisputed  that  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  is  in  the  childโs \nbest  interest,  even  when  certification  of the  Kin  Caregiver  is  denied  as  a result  of one  of  these \nDisqualification  Systems.  In  some  of these  instances,  as  described  above,  ACS  approves \nplacement  of  the  child  โdirectlyโ  with  the  very  same  Kin  Caregiver  who  has  been  denied \ncertification.  According  to  OCFS  data,  across  New  York  State,  since  2012,  โ16,183  children \n[have  been  diverted]  from  foster care  through  the  use  of direct  custody  placements.โ \n  \n'ยฉ Again, the disproportionate  impact of Defendantsโ  disqualification  policies  and  practices on  African  American \nchildren  is glaringly  apparent  in  the data on  KinGAP  accessibility.  According  to  an  ACS  Deputy  Commissioner, \nAfrican  American  children  are 45%  less  likely  to be  discharged  to  KinGAP than  white children. \n53\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  54  of  74  PagelD  #:  54 \n192.  When  ACS  directly  places  the  Plaintiff Class  with  Kin  Caregivers,  it  shirks  its \nresponsibility  to  support  and  adequately  care  for  these  children.  The  Plaintiff Class  are  denied \nChildcare  Services  and  Supports,  including  foster care  maintenance  payments,  clothing \nallowances,  reimbursement  for  school  related  expenses,  transportation,  camp  fees,  or  any  of  the \nmany  miscellaneous  expenses  of growing  up  in  New  York  City.  In  addition,  the children  do  not \nbenefit  from  the  coordination  and  provision  of services  for  their  medical,  mental  health  or \nscholastic  needs,  and  automatic  enrollment  in  Medicaid. \n193.  According  to  a  report  by  the  American  Association  of Retired  Persons  on  kinship \ncare,  direct  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  leaves  the  family  with  the  burdens  of family  court \ninvolvement  but  โwithout  the  supportive  systems  in  place  to  provide  for  the  needs  of the  child.โ \nWhile  this  diversion  has  saved  the  government  money,  โfunding  to  support  those  kinship \nresources  has  remained  extremely  lowโ  ignoring  โmany  familiesโ  need  for  additional  support.โ \n194.   Itis  apparent  that  the  lack  of financial  support  is  detrimental  to  the  Plaintiff Class. \nAmong  foster children  living  with  kin  in  2012,  21%  had  no  health  insurance coverage,  and  44% \nwere  living  below  the  federal  poverty  level.  It  is  estimated  that  raising  a child  in  New  York  City \ncosts  an  average  of $500,000;  these  families  desperately  need  the  financial  and  general  welfare \nsupports  and  services  that  are  provided  through  foster care. \n195.  In  addition,  children  โdirectly  placedโ  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  are  not  eligible  for \nassistance  with  service  referrals  and  coordination  for  medical,  mental  health  or  school  needs \nfrom  ACS.  Moreover,  ACS  no  longer ensures  Medicaid  for  the  child.'โ  This  can  be  devastating \nfor children  in  the  care  of these  Kin  Caregivers.  Without  the  necessary  services  and  supports, \n  \n'? Without  automatic  Medicaid coverage  through  ACS,  it can be difficult  for families  to  secure Medicaid  coverage \nfor the  child  in  their care.  The childโs biological  parent(s),  who  is  subject to an open  Article  10 case  in  Family  court, \noften  holds the  medical  information  and  paperwork necessary to  secure  insurance coverage  for the child. \n54\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  55  of  74  PagelD  #:  55 \nthese  placements  have  a  greater  likelihood  of failure,  resulting  in  the  child  being  moved  again  to \na  different  placement,  compounding  the  harm  to  the  Plaintiff Class.  Adoption  and  KinGAP  are \nalso  foreclosed  by  direct  placement  since  by  law  the  Kin  Caregiver  would  have  to  first  be  a \nfoster  parent  in  order  to  qualify. \n196.  Kin  Caregivers  are  โmore  likely  to  experience  increased  stress  due  to  having  to \nmanage  relationships  with  the  parents  of the  children  in  their  care  and  take  on  a  new  parenting \nrole.โ  Moreover,  according  to  the  American  Association  of Retired  Persons,  โchildren  in  kinship \ncaregiver  homes  who  have  had  interaction  with  the  child  welfare  system  have  higher  rates  of \ntrauma  (38%  of children  involved  in  child  welfare  under  3  years  old  have  experienced  severe \ntrauma),  leading  to  higher  rates  of behavioral  and  emotional  health  disorders  and  a  disruptive \nhome  life.โ \n197.  Despite  being  aware  of the  myriad  harms  to  the  Plaintiff Class  as  a  result  of their \ndisqualification  policies  and  practices,  Defendants  fail  to  provide  adequate  oversight  of the  foster \nand  adoptive  parent  certification  process. \n198.  Indeed,  a  2016  federal  audit  found  that  OCFS  does  โnot  monitor  these  processes \n[background  checks  for  foster  and  adoptive  parents]  to  ensure  compliance,โ  including  failing  to \nput  into  place  a  โcase  planning  process  ...  to  ensure  appropriate  follow-up.โ  There  is  also  no \nindication  that  OCFS  conducts  any  review  of denied  foster or  adoptive  parent  applications. \n199.  ACS  similarly  fails  to  adequately  monitor  the  foster  parent  certification  process. \nAs  the  New  York  City  Comptroller  reported  in  a  2019  report  on  the certification  process: \nACS  has  no  process  in  place  to  independently  verify  that  its  contracted  foster care \nproviders  are  properly  certifying  prospective  foster  care  families  in  accordance \nwith  City  and  State  requirements  prior  to  their  issuance  of certifications  and  the \nplacement  of children  with  foster  families.  In  addition,  although  ACS  conducts \npost-certification  audits  to  assess  whether  required  steps  were  taken  and \n55\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  56  of  74  PagelD  #:  56 \ndocumented  for  recently  certified  and  recertified  foster care  families,  we  found \nthat  ACS  is  not  utilizing  this  tool  effectively. \n200.  The Comptroller concluded  that  โ[a]  significant  factor  that  directly  contributed  to \nthe  above  weaknesses  is  that  ACS  management  has  failed  to  develop,  implement  and  employ \nprocedures  and  measures  to  effectively  monitor  and  oversee  its  contracted  foster  agencies  with \nregard  to  the  foster  care  certification  process.โ \n201.  Defendants  also  fail  to  provide  effective  guidance,  in  the  form  of policies  or \ndirectives,  to  ensure  that  children  are  not  being  inappropriately  denied  safe  foster  and  adoptive \nplacement  with  Kin  Caregivers. \n202.  OCFS  provides  minimal  guidance  to  ACS  regarding  the  appropriate  process  for \nevaluating  whether to  certify  a  foster  or  adoptive  home  where  the  Kin  Caregiver or  household \nmember  has  a  criminal  record.  In  a  single  attachment  to  an  Administrative  Directive,  OCFS \nprovides  a  list  of factors  to  be  considered  during  โsafety  assessmentsโ  conducted  after  a criminal \nrecord  is  found. \n203.  Although  OCFS  provides  some  guidance  with  regard  to  assessing  the  application \nof a  potential  kin  foster  parent  with  SCR  history  or  criminal  record,  it  fails  to  ensure  that  ACS  is \nadhering  to  its  policies  and  guidelines.  OCFS  is  also  silent  on  how  ACS  should  properly  assess \nan  adoptive  applicant  with  SCR  history  or  criminal  record,  including  what,  if any,  weight  should \nbe  given  to  any  SCR  history. \n204.  ACS  fails  to  provide  any  policies,  directives  or  guidance  on  how  ACS  staff and \ncontracted  agencies  should  evaluate  a  foster  or  adoptive  home  where  a  Kin  Caregiver  or \nhousehold  member  has  criminal  or  SCR  record. \n56\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  57  of  74  PagelD  #:  57 \n205.  Moreover,  upon  information  and  belief,  both  OCFS  and  ACS  fail  to  ensure  that \ntheir  staff and  contracted  agencies  are  adhering  to  state  regulations  and  policy,  including \nproviding  notice  to  the  Kin  Caregiver  once  a  decision  has  been  made. \n206.  Neither  OCFS  nor  ACS  keep  track  of or collect  data  in  a  way  that  enables  them  to \nassess  the  certification  and  background  check  process  and  correct  problematic  practices. \n207.  These  systemic  failures  are  evident  in  the  histories  of each  of the  Named \nPlaintiffs.  Defendantsโ  failure  to  provide  adequate  guidance  and  oversight  over  the  certification \nprocess,  including  the  background  check  requirements,  results  in  a  system  that  fails  to  make \nindividualized  and  meaningful  determinations  of the  suitability  of Kin  Caregivers  and  routinely \ndeprives  the  Named  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff Class  of  placement  with  Kin  Caregivers \nnotwithstanding  their current  ability  to  provide  a  safe  home  for their  relative  child. \nDefendantsโ Mandatory  Disqualification  System  Violates  the  Constitutional  Rights  of the \nPlaintiff Class \n208.  Defendantsโ  Mandatory  Disqualification  System  violates  the  Plaintiff Classโs \nright  to  the  preservation  of  family  association  and  integrity,  to  be  free  from  unnecessary  and \nunreasonable  intrusion  into  their  mental  and  emotional  stability  and  well-being,  and  to  be  under \ngovernment  care  or  supervision  no  longer  than  is  necessary.  It  further denies  them  due  process  to \nchallenge  the  deprivation  of a  safe  foster or  adoptive  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver. \n209.  The  statute  creates  an  irrebuttable  presumption  that  Kin  Caregivers  with  certain \ncriminal  history  are  unfit  to  be  foster or  adoptive  parents  to  a  related  child,  regardless  of their \nrelationship  with  that  child  or  the  suitability  of their  home.  As  a  result,  children  such  as  B.B., \nJ.R.  and  the  R.  children  are denied  the  ability  to  live  in  a  loving  and  appropriate  home  with  a \nmember  of their  family. \n57\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  58  of  74  PagelD  #:  58 \n210.  OCFS  has  set  an  expansive  list  of crimes  that  would  automatically  bar  a  Kin \nCaregiver  from  caring  for  a  member  of the  Plaintiff Class.  As  a  result,  there  are  nearly  300 \ncrimes  that  could  deny  the  Plaintiff Class  a  familial  foster or  adoptive  home,  regardless  of how \nlong  ago  the  crime  occurred  and  whether  the  Kin  Caregiver  has  been  rehabilitated.  And \napproximately  40  other  felonies  that  require  a  five  year  mandatory  disqualification. \n211.  Moreover,  because  the  statute  creates  an  irrebuttable  presumption  that  these  Kin \nCaregivers  are  unfit  to  be  foster  or  adoptive  parents  to  a related  child,  the  Plaintiff Class  have  no \nrecourse  to  challenge  these  denials.  And  because  a  Kin  Caregiver cannot  be  a  KinGAP  guardian \nwithout  being  first  certified  as  a  foster parent,  that  path  to  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  is \nclosed  to  the  Plaintiff Class  as  well. \n212.  Defendants  deny  the  foster or  adoptive  parent  applications  of  Kin  Caregivers \nwithout  any  analysis  as  to  whether  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  conviction  bears  on  his  or  her  ability  to \ncare  for  the  Plaintiff Class.  In  some  cases,  these  convictions  are  decades  old  and  do  not  reflect \nupon  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  ability  to  successfully  parent  today.  The  relationship  between  the  Kin \nCaregiver  and  the  child  may  be  close  and  life-long,  but  these  factors  are  deemed  irrelevant. \nIndeed,  there  is  no  opportunity  for  the  Plaintiff Class  or  the  Kin  Caregiver  to  challenge  the \nrelevance  of the conviction  to  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  ability  to  care  for  the  child  or  the  propriety  of \nACSโs  decision  to  deny  the  placement. \n213.  OCFS  itself  has  admitted  that  a  full,  individualized  analysis  of a Kin  Caregiverโs  \nhome  is  necessary  to  make  an  accurate  assessment  of the  suitability  of a  home  when  there  is  a \ncriminal  history  record.  When  New  York  passed  the  mandatory  disqualification  requirements, \nOCFS  advocated  for  individualized  review  rather  than  the  Mandatory  Disqualification  System. \nIn  a  statement  to  the  Acting  Counsel  to  the  Governor,  OCFS  Deputy  Commissioner concluded \n58\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  59  of  74  PagelD  #:  59 \nthat  โcomprehensive  standards  that  look  at  criminal  histories  on  a  case-by-case  basis  are \nimportant  to  enable  certain  appropriate  relative  placements  to  occur.โ \n214.  OCFS  further  admitted  that  it  is  important  to  be  able  to  facilitate  kinship \nplacements  when  โthe  particular  history  and  background  of the  potential  caregiver demonstrates \nthat  the  placement  is  in  the  childโs  best  interest  and  is  stable  and  safe.  Without  the  ability  to \nconduct  an  individualized  assessment  in  these  situations,  children  who  could  live  in  viable \nkinship  care  placements  may  be  forced  into  other  foster care  and  group  home  arrangements  that \nmay  be  less  stable  and  more  traumatic  than  placing  them  with  relatives.โ \n215.  Yet,  OCFS  and  ACS  have  failed  to  provide  this  individualized  analysis,  thus \nautomatically  denying  children  foster  and  adoptive  placements  with  Kin  Caregivers  with \nmandatory  disqualifying  convictions,  causing  irreparable  harm  to  the  Plaintiff Class. \n216.  Moreover,  after  a  mandatory  disqualifying  conviction  is  discovered,  ACS  is \nrequired  by  statute  to  initiate  a  plan  to  remove  the  foster  child  from  the  home.  After the  trauma \nof separation  from  their parent(s),  the  actual  or  threatened  removal  acts  as  a  significant \ninterference  with  the  Plaintiff Classโs  fundamental  right  to  family  integrity  and  association, \ncauses  psychological  and  emotional  harm,  increases  their time  in  government  custody  and \nfurther  traumatizes  these  vulnerable children. \nDefendantsโ Discretionary  Criminal History  Disqualification  System  Violates  the \nConstitutional Rights  of the  Plaintiff Class \n217.  Although  by  statute  ACS  may  certify  or  approve  kin  foster  or  adoptive \nplacements  if the  Kin  Caregiver  has  a  non-mandatory  criminal  history  or  an  adult  household \nmember  has  a  criminal  conviction,  upon  information  and  belief,  in  practice  ACS  routinely  treats \nthese  convictions  as  automatic  disqualifications  or  places  undue  weight  on  the  history  and \ndeclines  to  conduct  any  further  analysis  of  the  suitability  of the  home.  Moreover,  by  denying  the \n59\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  60  of  74  PagelD  #:  60 \nPlaintiff Class  a  means  to  challenge  these discretionary  denials,  Defendants  unduly  interfere  with \nthe  Plaintiff Classโs  constitutional  rights  without  due  process. \n218.  First,  on  information  and  belief,  ACS  routinely  fails  to  fully  evaluate  the  Kin \nCaregiver  and  their  home  after  learning  of a  Kin  Caregiver  or  household  memberโs  criminal \nconviction.  Upon  information  and  belief,  if ACS  learns  of the  criminal  conviction  directly  from \nthe  Kin  Caregiver,  the  caseworker often  discourages  the  Kin  Caregiver  from  applying  for  foster \nparent  certification  and/or  does  not  proceed  with  a  full  evaluation  of  the  home.  Even  when  the \nACS  caseworker does  proceed  with  the  application  and  submits  the  paperwork  to  OCBFS,  the \ninquiry  into  the  home  usually  ends  when  the  caseworker  learns  there  is  a  criminal  history  record. \nAs  a  result,  Defendants  routinely  fail  to  conduct  a  full  evaluation  of Kin  Caregivers  (or  adult \nhousehold  members)  with  a  criminal  history  record. \n219.  Second,  even  when  there  is  an  evaluation  of  the  home  and  a  formal  denial  is \nmade,  Defendants  regularly  fail  to  provide  the  Kin  Caregiver  with  notice  of  the  reasons  for  the \ndenial,  as  required  by  statute  and  regulation. \n220.  Third,  Defendants  fail  to  provide  notice  or  an  opportunity  for  the  Plaintiff Class  to \nchallenge  the  denial  of  Kin  Caregivers  as  foster  or  adoptive  placements.  There  is  no  process  for \nthe  Plaintiff Class  or  the  Kin  Caregiver  to  challenge  the  relevance  of the  criminal  history  record \nto  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  ability  to  care  for  the  child  or  the  propriety  of  ACSโs  decision  to  deny  the \nplacement. \n221.  Finally,  OCFS  fails  to  oversee  ACSโs  practices  to  address  it  deficiencies.  As  a \nresult,  Defendantsโ  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System  denies  the  Plaintiff \nClass  a  safe  foster  or  adoptive  home  with  a  familiar  Kin  Caregiver,  and  does  so  without  due \n60\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  61  of  74  PagelD  #:  61 \nprocess  to  the  Plaintiff Class,  subjecting  Plaintiff Class  to  further  trauma  and  emotional  and \npsychological  harm. \nDefendantsโ SCR  Disqualification  System  Violates  the  Constitutional  Rights  of the  Plaintiff \nClass \n222.  Upon  information  and  belief,  ACS  routinely  denies  the  Plaintiff Class  kin  foster \nor  adoptive  placements  by  placing  undue  weight  on  the  Kin  Caregiver or  adult  household \nmemberโs  SCR  record  and  does  so  without  providing  notice  or  a  meaningful  opportunity  for  the \nPlaintiff Class  to  challenge  the  denial. \n223.  Defendantsโ  exclusive  reliance  upon  SCR  records  is  particularly  problematic.  An \nindicated  SCR  record  is  not  a  reliable  basis  on  which  to  determine  that  a  person  is  unfit  to  care \nfor  a  child.  SCR  investigations  are  either  unfounded  or  indicated  through  a  non-adversarial \nprocess.  As  discussed  above,  the  SCR  relies  upon  an  extremely  low  standard  for  โindicatingโ  a \nreport  of abuse  or  neglect.  The  SCR  requires  only  โsome  credible  evidenceโ  to  support  the \nallegations  โ  a  โbare  minimumโ  standard,  according  to  New  Yorkโs  highest  court,  that  โimposes \nno  duty  on  the  fact  finder  to  weigh  conflicting  evidence,  no  matter  how  substantial,  and  allows  a \nreport  to  be  indicated  if only  one  out  of  several  believable  items  of evidence  supports  it.โ  An \nindicated  SCR  report  does  not  mean  that  ACS  ever decided  to  open  a case  for  the  provision  of \npreventive  services  to  the  family.  And,  an  indicated  SCR  certainly  does  not  mean  that  ACS  ever \nfiled  a  petition  in  Family  Court,  or  that  a  petition  resulted  in  a  Family  Court  finding  of  abuse  or \nneglect  against  the  subject  of  the  report. \n224.  Indicated  reports  are  maintained  on  the  SCR  for  ten  years  after  the  18th  birthday \nof the  youngest  child  listed  in  the  report  โ  which  can  be  up  to  28  years.  These  indicated  reports \nremain  on  the  SCR during  this  period  regardless  of whether  the  report  ever  results  in  a  court \nproceeding.  They  even  remain  when  a  Family  Court  petition  has  been  filed  and  has  been \n61\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  62  of  74  PagelD  #:  62 \ndismissed  on  the  merits.  Unfounded  reports  remain  on  the  SCR,  available  to  ACS,  for  ten  years \nfrom  the  date  of the  report. \n225.  Upon  information  and  belief,  after  learning  of  a  Kin  Caregiverโs  SCR  record, \neither  directly  from  the  Kin  Caregiver or  through  an  SCR database  review,  ACS  routinely  will \nnot  proceed  with  a  full  evaluation  of  the  home.  In  defiance  of  state  regulation  and  policy,  ACS \noften  does  not  even  request,  let  alone  review,  the  underlying  SCR  record  to  determine  if the \ninformation  provided  is  โrelevant  and  reasonably  related  to  the  certification  or  approvalโ  of  the \nhome.  Moreover,  ACS  does  not  then  appropriately  evaluate  all  the  information  provided  during \nthe  home  study  and  application  process  to  determine  whether  to  certify  or  approve  the  home. \n226.  Moreover,  during  an  emergency  evaluation  of the  Kin  Caregiver,  if  ACS  decides \nthat  an  SCR  record  precludes  a  Kin  Caregiver  from  emergency  certification,  ACS  does  not \nprovide  any  written  notice.  ACS  also  refuses  to  refer  the  Kin  Caregiver  for  full  foster care \ncertification.  In  doing  so,  ACS  simultaneously  denies  the  child  foster  care  placement  with  the \nKin  Caregiver  without  a  meaningful  assessment  and  fails  to  provide  written  notice  to  the  child  or \nKin  Caregiver. \n227.  Upon  information  and  belief,  even  when  there  is  an  evaluation  of the  home  and  a \nformal  denial  decision  is  made,  ACS  often  fails  to  send  notice  with  the  reasons  for  the  denial  to \nthe  Kin  Caregiver  as  required  by  statute  and  regulation,  and  never  sends  such  notice  to  the \nPlaintiff Class.  As  a  result,  the  Plaintiff Class  members  are  not  notified  as  to  why  their  foster  or \nadoptive  placement  with  their  Kin  Caregiver  has  been  denied. \n228.  As  aresult,  Defendantsโ  SCR  Disqualification  System  denies  thousands  of \nPlaintiff Class  members  a  safe  foster  or  adoptive  home  with  a  familiar  Kin  Caregiver. \n62\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  63  of  74  PagelD  #:  63 \n229.  OCFS  additionally  fails  to  oversee  ACSโs  practices  sufficiently  to  identify  and \naddress  its  deficiencies. \n230.  At  no  point  in  this  process  is  there  any  opportunity  for  the  Plaintiff Class  to \nchallenge  the  denial  of their  kin  foster  or  adoptive  placement.  The  only  recourse  is  for  the  Kin \nCaregiver,  and  their only  recourse  is  to  challenge  the  validity  of the  underlying  SCR  report. \n231.  Defendants  fail  to  provide  any  process  for  members  of the  Plaintiff Class  or  the \nKin  Caregiver to  challenge  the  relevance  of the  SCR  report  to  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  ability  to  care \nfor the child  or  the  propriety  of ACSโs  decision  to  deny  the  placement.  As  a  result,  Defendants \nare  routinely  depriving  the  Plaintiff Class  of placement  in  a  foster  or  adoptive  home  with  a \nfamiliar  Kin  Caregiver  and  denying  the  Plaintiff Class  any  procedural  safeguards,  subjecting  the \nPlaintiff Class  to  further  trauma  and  emotional  and  psychological  harm. \nCLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n232.  Named  Plaintiffs  bring  this  action  pursuant  to  Rules  23(a)  and  23(b)(2)  of the \nFederal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure  on  behalf of a  class  of all  children  in  New  York  City  who  have \nbeen  or  will  be  removed  from  their  parents  or  guardians  by  ACS  pursuant  to  Article  10  of  the \nFamily  Court  Act,  and  have  been  denied  or  are  at  risk  of being  denied  a  foster  or  adoptive \nplacement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  based  on  the criminal  history  or  SCR  record  of the  Kin \nCaregiver or  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  adult  household  member. \na.  The  โMandatory  Disqualification  Subclassโ  consists  of all  Class  members \nwho  have  been  denied  or  are  at  risk  of being  denied  a  foster  or  adoptive \nplacement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  due  to  Defendantsโ  Mandatory \nDisqualification  System. \nb.  The  โDiscretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  Subclassโ  includes \nall  Class  members  who  have  been  denied  or  are  at  risk  of  being  denied  a \n63\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  64  of  74  PagelD  #:  64 \nfoster  or  adoptive  placement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  due  to  Defendantsโ \nDiscretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System. \nc.  The  โSCR  Disqualification  Subclassโ  consists  of  all  Class  members  who \nhave  been  denied  or  are  at  risk  of being  denied  a  foster  or  adoptive \nplacement  with  a  Kin  Caregiver  due  to  Defendantsโ  Discretionary  SCR \nDisqualification  System. \n233.  The Class  is  sufficiently  numerous  to  make joinder  impracticable.  Over 7,000 \nchildren  are  in  foster care  in  New  York  City  under  the  custody  and  control  of ACS.  In  Fiscal \nYear  2020  alone,  3,094  children  were  removed  from  their parentsโ  custody  and  entered  foster \ncare.  Over  500  children  in  ACS  custody  were  freed  for  adoption  in  2019  alone.  While  a  more \nexact  number  of Class  members  is  unknown  to  Named  Plaintiffs  at  this  time,  the  proposed  Class \nlikely  exceeded  several  hundred  members  in  2020  alone. \n234.  The questions  of fact  and  law  raised  by  Named  Plaintiffsโ  claims  are  common  to \nand  typical  of those  of each  member of the  Class  whom  they  seek  to  represent. \n235.  Questions  of  fact  common  to  the  entire  Plaintiff Class  include,  but  are  not  limited \nto: \na.  Whether Defendantsโ  Disqualification  Systems  deny  class  members  kin \nfoster  or  adoptive  placements  by  giving  undue  weight  to  the  Kin \nCaregiverโs  past  record. \nb.  Whether  each  Defendant  fails  to  conduct  adequate  oversight  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  its  laws,  regulations  and  policies  governing  prospective \nkin  foster  and  adoptive  parent  certification  process  for  class  members. \n64\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  65  of  74  PagelD  #:  65 \n236.  Questions  of  law  common  to  the  entire  Plaintiff Class  include,  but  are  not  limited \nto: \na.  Whether Defendantsโ  Disqualification  System  violates  class  membersโ \nsubstantive  rights  under  the  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution. \n237.  Additional  questions  of  fact  common  to  the  Mandatory  Disqualification  Subclass \ninclude,  but  are  not  limited  to: \na.  Whether the  Mandatory  Disqualification  System  denies  this  subclass  of \nchildren  kin  foster or  adoptive  placements  solely  on  the  basis  of the  Kin \nCaregiverโs  past  felony  record. \nb.  Whether the  Mandatory  Disqualification  System  routinely  denies  this \nsubclass  of children  an  individualized  assessment  of  whether  placement  in \na  foster  or  adoptive  home  with  Kin  Caregiver  with  a  mandatory \ndisqualifying  conviction  is  safe. \nC.  Whether the  Mandatory  Disqualification  System  denies  this  subclass  of \nchildren  notice  and  the  opportunity  to  challenge  denials  of foster  or \nadoptive  placements  with  Kin  Caregivers. \n238.  Questions  of  law  common  to  the  Mandatory  Disqualification  Subclass  include, \nbut  are  not  limited  to: \na.  Whether the  Mandatory  Disqualification  System  violates  this  subclassโs \nsubstantive  rights  under  the  due  process  clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution. \n65\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  66  of  74  PagelD  #:  66 \nb.  Whether the  Mandatory  Disqualification  System  violates  this  subclassโs \nprocedural  due  process  rights  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the \nUnited  States  Constitution. \n239.  Questions  of  fact  common  to  the  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification \nSubclass  include,  but  are  not  limited  to: \na.  Whether the  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System \ndenies  this  subclass  of children  kin  foster  or  adoptive  placements  by \ngiving  undue  weight  to  the  Kin  Caregiverโs  or  adult  household  memberโs \ncriminal  record. \nb.  Whether the  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System \ndenies  this  subclass  of children  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge \ndenials  of  foster or  adoptive  placements  with  Kin  Caregivers. \n240.  Questions  of  law  common  to  the  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification \nSubclass  include,  but  are  not  limited  to: \na.  Whether the  Discretionary  Criminal  History  Disqualification  System \nviolates  this  subclass  of childrenโs  procedural  due  process  rights  under  the \nFourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution. \n241.  Questions  of  fact  common  to  the  SCR  Disqualification  Subclass  include,  but  are \nnot  limited  to: \na.  Whether the  SCR  Disqualification  System  denies  this  subclass  of children \nkin  foster or  adoptive  placements  by  giving  undue  weight  to  the  Kin \nCaregiverโs  or  adult  household  memberโs  SCR  record. \n66\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  67  of  74  PagelD  #:  67 \nb.  Whether the  SCR  Disqualification  System  denies  this  subclass  of children \nnotice  and  an  opportunity  to  challenge  denials  of  foster  or  adoptive \nplacements  with  Kin  Caregivers. \n242.  Questions  of  law  common  to  the  SCR  Disqualification  Subclass  include,  but  are \nnot  limited  to: \na.  Whether the  SCR  Disqualification  System  violates  this  subclass  of \nchildrenโs  procedural  due  process  rights  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment \nto  the  United  States  Constitution. \n243.  The  Named  Plaintiffsโ  claims  are  typical  of the  claims  of other  members  of the \nPlaintiff Class  as  all  class  members  are  similarly  affected  by  Defendantsโ  policies  and  practices \nin  violation  of the  federal  constitution. \n244.  Named  Plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of all  members  of \nthe  Plaintiff Class  that  they  seek  to  represent. \n245.  Each  Named  Plaintiff appears  by  a  next  friend  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of Civil \nProcedure  17(c),  and  each  next  friend  is  sufficiently  familiar  with  the  facts  of the  childโs \nsituation  and  dedicated  to  the childโs  best  interests  to  fairly  and  adequately  represent  the  childโs \ninterests  in  this  litigation. \n246.  Aclass  action  is  the  superior  method  for  a  fair  and  efficient  adjudication  of this \nmatter  because  Defendants  have  acted  or  failed  to  act  on  grounds  generally  applicable  to  all \nmembers  of the  Plaintiff Class,  necessitating  class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief. \nCounsel  for  Plaintiffs  knows  of no  conflict  among  the  Class  members. \n67\nCase  1:21-cv-06229  Document1  Filed  11/10/21  Page  68  of  74  PagelD  #:  68 \n247.  Named  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff Class  are  represented  by  The  Legal  Aid  Society \nand  Dechert  LLP,  counsel  who  are  together competent  and  experienced  in  child  welfare \nlitigation,  class  action  litigation,  and  complex  civil  litigation. \n248.  Counsel  for  Named  Plaintiffs  have  identified  and  thoroughly  investigated  all \nclaims  in  this  action  and  have  committed  sufficient  resources  to  represent  the  Plaintiff Class \nthrough  trial  and  any  appeals. \nCAUSES  OF  ACTION \nFirst  Cause  of Action \n(Substantive  Due  Process  Under the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution) \n(Asserted  by  All  Named  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff Class  Against  All  Defendants) \n249.

When  Defendants  remove  a  member  of the  Plaintiff Class  from  its  parents,  they \nassume  an  affirmative  duty  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  protect  that  child  from  harm  and \nrisk  of harm. \n251.  By  the  foregoing  actions  and  inactions,  Defendants  have  acted  under  color  of state \nlaw  to  violate  this  duty  to  all  Named  Plaintiffs  and  the  Plaintiff Class. \n252.
