    "summary": "<p>This case is about a Protection and Advocacy (P&amp;A) agency&rsquo;s access authority, specifically access to a state agency&rsquo;s survey and investigation records of a nursing facility. On March 1, 2012, Disability Law Center Alaska (DLC) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska against Alaska Department of Health and Human Services, its Division of Health Care Services, and the Division&rsquo;s Section of Certification and Licensing (collectively &lsquo;DHHS&rsquo;), alleging violations of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act), the Protection and Advocacy of Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act), the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights Act (PAIR Act), and the Rehabilitation Act when defendants failed to provide survey files of a nursing facility investigation. Judge John W. Sedwick presided over this matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit began after DLC received complaints of abuse and neglect by Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility. The nursing facility reported several incidents of falls, and DHHS investigated these incidents. DLC requested DHHS&rsquo;s survey files for those investigations. In response, DHHS provided DLC with the Statements of Deficiencies and the Plans of Correction for several visits it had conducted. As a result of the numerous deficiencies found by DHHS, DLC determined probable cause existed that abuse or neglect had taken place at the facility. In order to assess the sufficiency of the surveys conducted by DHHS, and determine if the Plans of Correction were appropriate, DLC requested the survey files containing all documents underlying the Statements of Deficiencies and Plans of Correction concerning the facility. DHHS denied the request, and DLC then filed a complaint seeking a preliminary injunction and declaratory relief requiring DHHS release the files in question.</p>\r\n<p>On May 11, 2012, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss under the terms that the State provide DLC with access to those files, and that DLC keep the files confidential. DLC also agreed to recognize that its access authority under the DD Act, PAIMI Act, and PAIR Act is silent about redisclosure of files. The case closed on May 11, 2012.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

In order for the Disability \nLaw Center to investigate both the adequacy of the facilityโs corrective actions and the Stateโs own \nsurveys and investigations, it needs to review both facility records and State survey and investigation \nfiles.

Plaintiff Disability Law Center of Alaska, Inc. is the designated Protection and \nAdvocacy (โP&Aโ) system for the State of Alaska. The Disability Law Center is a nonprofit \ncorporation duly organized in accordance with the laws of the State of Alaska. Its principal place of \nbusiness is in Anchorage, Alaska.  The Disability Law Center also operates permanent offices in \nJuneau and Fairbanks. \n5.  Defendant Alaska Department of Health and Social Services is the agency for the State \nof Alaska responsible for administering the divisions and sections located within its department, \nwhich include the Division of Health Care Services and the Section of Certification and Licensing. \n6.  Defendant William Streur is the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Health and \nSocial Services and is named as a defendant in his official capacity as Commissioner. \n7.  Defendant Alaska Division of Health Care Services is the division for the State of \nAlaska responsible for overseeing the Section of Certification and Licensing. \n8.  Defendant Kimberli Poppe-Smart  is the Acting Director of the Division of Health Care \nServices and is named as a defendant in her official capacity as Acting Director. \n9.  Defendant Section of Certification and Licensing is a unit in the Division of Health \nCare Services, Alaska Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for determining \nwhether all health care facilities in the State, including nursing homes, meet State and Federal \nstandards.  Certification and Licensing in its role as a surveying and licensing entity is responsible \nfor ensuring that Medicaid and Medicare facilities are in compliance with federal conditions of \nparticipation.   \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 3 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 3 of 17\n\nBACKGROUND \n10. Congress established minimum requirements for nursing homes that want to provide services \nunder Medicare and Medicaid. These requirements are broadly outlined in the Social Security Act.  \nThe Social Security Act also entrusts the federal Secretary of Health and Human Services (DHHS) \nwith the responsibility of monitoring and enforcing these requirements. Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (CMS), a DHHS agency, is also charged with the responsibility of working out \nthe details of the law and how it will be implemented, which it does by writing regulations and \nmanuals and overseeing State compliance activities. \n11. CMS has contracted with each State to conduct onsite inspections (surveys) that determine \nwhether its nursing homes meet the minimum Medicare and Medicaid quality and performance \nstandards.  Those inspections are called surveys and surveys in Alaska are generally conducted by \nCertification and Licensing. \n12. In addition to performing inspections for CMS, Certification and Licensing also undertakes \nindependent licensure surveys and complaint investigations of nursing homes pursuant to its \nauthority under AS 18.30.300 et seq. \n13. Based on information and belief, state licensing and complaint investigations are conducted \nin a very similar manner to CMS survey visits conducted by Certification and Licensing staff and are \ngenerally conducted in conjunction with a CMS survey. \n14. Based on information and belief, licensing and certification files contain, including but not \nlimited to, written notice of deficiencies that are found to cause Immediate Jeopardy, interview notes, \nnotes from records reviews, observation notes, a statement of deficiencies, notice of termination or \nother sanctions, an allegation of credible compliance, notice of revisit, submission of the Plan of \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.

Based on information and belief, Certification and Licensing does not keep separate files for \nthe work it performs under its State authority from the surveys it conducts at the behest of CMS. \n16. Based on information and belief, Certification and Licensing is the custodian of the survey \nfiles for surveys it conducts at the behest of CMS. \nProtection and Advocacy Investigatory Authority \n17. The  Protection  and  Advocacy  (P&A)  System  comprises  the  nationwide  network  of \ncongressionally mandated, legally based disability rights agencies. In response to the public outcry \nabout the abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities in institutional care, the U.S. Congress in \n1975 mandated the creation of P&A agencies in every state and territory. The purpose of this \nnationwide system is to provide for the protection of and advocacy for the legal, civil, and human \nrights of persons with mental or physical disabilities. P&A agencies have unique authority under \nfederal law to enforce both state and federal laws concerning the rights and benefits of individuals \nwith disabilities. This authority includes initiating investigations of abuse and neglect in institutions \nthat serve individuals with disabilities.  \n18.  P&A organizations, including the Disability Law Center, carry out their federal \nmandates under the statutory authority provided by the DD Act, PAIMI Act and PAIR Act which \nprovide P&A organizations with the authority to investigate complaints of abuse and neglect \nreceived regarding individuals with disabilities residing in facilities that provide care and treatment.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. 10805; 42 U.S.C. ยง 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043 and 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e.  The PAIR Act is \ngoverned by the same provisions as the DD Act. 29 U.S.C. 794e(f)(2). \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 5 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 5 of 17\n\n19.  One of the major roles P&A organizations play in the role of investigating complaints \nof abuse and neglect is to ensure that state agencies charged with investigating abuse and neglect \nunder  state  and federal  law, such as state licensing agencies, conduct  thorough and timely \ninvestigations and provide for appropriate remedies of any problems found.   \n20.  In order to conduct a full investigation into abuse and neglect at Seward Mountain \nHaven, including the falls that residents suffered there and to assess the adequacy of the Certification \nand Licensing surveys and investigations, the Disability Law Center needs to review all of the \ninformation the regulations implementing the DD Act and the PAIMI Act require be made available \nto it.  These regulations provide P&A organizations with access to: \n(2) Reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating abuse, neglect, or injury occurring \nat a facility rendering care or treatment, or by or for the facility itself, that describe any or all of \nthe following:  \n \n(i) Abuse, neglect, or injury occurring at the facility;  \n \n(ii) The steps taken to investigate the incidents;  \n \n(iii) Reports and records, including personnel records, prepared or maintained by the facility, in \nconnection with such reports of incidents; or  \n \n(iv) Supporting information that was relied upon in creating a report, including all information \nand records used or reviewed in preparing reports of abuse, neglect or injury such as records \nwhich describe persons who were interviewed, physical and documentary evidence that was \nreviewed, and the related investigative findings.  \n \n42 CFR 51.1(c)(2)(i)-(iv). \n \n21.  As explained in the preamble to the regulatory access provisions, Protection and \nAdvocacy organizations must have sufficient access to records, like survey files, to determine \nโwhether the investigation of another agency or facility was sufficiently thorough.โ  62 FR 53548-\n53559-60. \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 6 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 6 of 17\n\nFACTS \n22.  On April 5, 2011, the Disability Law Center, as the State of Alaska designated \nProtection and Advocacy (P&A) system, initiated an investigation into complaints of abuse and \nneglect at the Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility in Seward, Alaska. \n23.  Specifically, the Disability Law Center received complaints that a resident had died \nbecause the Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility failed to take adequate precautions against a \nresidentโs falls.  The Disability Law Center also received complaints that two other residents had \nfallen and had been hospitalized. \n24.  The Disability Law Center received the deceased residentโs records.  The resident was \ninitially admitted to the nursing facility for dementia and was determined to be at risk for falls.  The \nresident suffered at least two falls during the spring and summer of 2010.  The resident fell a \nsubsequent time on October 14, 2010, resulting in a left hip fracture.  The resident subsequently \ndeveloped pneumonia as a complication to her hip fracture and died.   \n25.  Although Seward Mountain Haven Nursing facility was ordered by the Certification \nand Licensing to review fall potential and develop safety plans, it is impossible to discern from either \nthe text of Certification and Licensingโs orders or the nursing facility records exactly how the \nresident fell or if precautions were taken by nursing facility staff to prevent falls and if so, if those \nprecautions were followed.   Also, it is impossible to discern from the text of Certification and \nLicensingโs orders or the nursing facilityโs records whether the resident would have suffered the \nrespiratory distress and died if she had not fallen in the first instance. \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 7 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 7 of 17\n\n26.    Another resident with dementia and cognitive deficits suffered a fall on April 22, 2010 \nat Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility.  The incident report from the fall indicates that as a \nresult of the fall that she fractured her left hip.  While the nursing facility records indicate that she \nwas not aware of her safety needs, it is unclear whether the resident had been placed on fall \nprecautions prior to this incident.   \n27.  A third resident who is unable to speak or communicate his needs fell on May 25, 2011 \nin his room where he was found around 6 p.m.  The resident was taken to the hospital for a laceration \nto his left eyebrow.  The nursing facilityโs records noted that he required assistance in moving and \ndue to a cognitive impairment was unaware of his safety needs.  The residentโs records noted that his \nfall precautions were not updated when he moved from one wing of the nursing facility to another \nand that the facility was deficient in making the hourly checks on the resident the day of the fall for a \nperiod of three hours from 3 p.m. until the resident was found on the floor at 6 p.m.      \n28.  On information and belief, Certification and Licensing investigated all three of these \nincidents, generating surveyorโs notes, file reviews and interview notes.   \n29.  As part of its investigation, on April 5, 2011, the Disability Law Center requested \nlicensing and certification survey files for the Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility from the \nState of Alaska Section of Certification and Licensing to determine whether Certification and \nLicensing had investigated the complaints of abuse and neglect the Disability Law Center had \nreceived or found similar issues concerning falls at the facility during its surveys and licensing \ninvestigations. \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 8 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 8 of 17\n\n30.  Specifically, the Disability Law Center requested the survey files for Seward Mountain \nHaven Nursing Facility expecting to receive records, including, but not limited to, the notes of the \nsurveyors, any correspondence between Certification and Licensing and the nursing facility, names \nand contact information for residents where the surveyors found deficiencies related to the care and \ntreatment, including the implementation of fall protocols for residents identified as being at risk for \nfalls. \n31.  In response to the Disability Law Centerโs request, the State of Alaska Section of \nCertification and Licensing provided the Disability Law Center with the Statements of Deficiencies \nand the Plans of Correction for the Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility for several survey visits \nit has conducted under its delegated authority from CMS.   \n32.  From the records provided by Certification and Licensing, it appears that in July 2011, \nCertification and Licensing cited the nursing facility for failure to complete full assessments, \nincluding specific risk factors and conditions, creating an increased potential for falls and/or injury.  \nThe citation from that survey indicates that a resident fell on June 23, 2010 from the commode to the \nfloor.  The Plan of Correction indicates that beginning on August 30, 2010 the nursing facility was to \nconduct  assessments  of  residentsโ  functional  capacity  and  develop  appropriate  care  plan \ninterventions.  These assessments and care plans are to be done upon admission to the facility and \nthen on a quarterly basis.   \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 9 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 9 of 17\n\n33.  Less than a month later, federal surveyors from CMS conducted an unannounced \ninspection of the nursing facility.  During that inspection, CMS noted deficiencies, particularly in the \narea of safety assessment, which includes development of fall precautions.  The surveyors noted at \nleast one resident had fallen from his wheelchair onto the floor and that the staff was unsure where to \nfind the safety assessment for the resident although the resident was identified as needing fall \nprevention. \n34.  Another citation in the Statement of Deficiencies indicates a resident had fallen out of \nbed as staff went to turn her.  That same resident apparently suffered a second fall the same week \nwhen she fell off the toilet.  The nursing facility had been unable to determine which of the two falls \nresulted in her fractured leg.  The summary of the falls in the Statement of Deficiencies indicates \nserious concerns regarding the facilityโs documentation of the fall and whether the resident was \nproperly assessed following the falls, noting that the resident had exhibited signs of acute pain for \nfive days before the facility intervened on her behalf and transferred the resident to the emergency \nroom. \n35.  After reviewing the Statements of Deficiencies and Plans of Correction provided by \nCertification and Licensing, the Disability Law Center found that Certification and Licensing had \nfound problems related to resident falls and required the facility to implement Plans of Correction; \nyet it appeared that even with the Plans of Correction in place that resident falls continued.   \n36.  The Disability Law Center received an additional complaint of a resident suffering a fall \nin February 2011.   \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 10 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 10 of 17\n\n37.  In May of 2011, even though Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility had been cited \nnumerous times for inadequate fall assessments, precautions and response, it was cited again for \ninappropriate response after a resident with quadriplegia had fallen out of bed.  Although the fall \nrequired a visit to the emergency room because the resident had hit his head during the fall, after \nreturning the nursing facility the resident was left in his room unattended for almost five hours \nwithout any follow up. \n38.  Through receipt of the Statements of Deficiencies, the Disability Law Center was \nalerted to other deficiencies found by Certification and Licensing concerning resident falls and \nlearned of falls that were not the subject of the original complaints the Disability Law Center had \nreceived. \n39.  As a result of the complaints of abuse and neglect already received and the numerous \ndeficiencies found by CMS and Certification and Licensing, the Disability Law Center determined \nprobable cause existed that abuse or neglect had taken place at Seward Mountain Haven Nursing \nFacility concerning the identification of residents at risk for falls, the implementation of appropriate \nfall precautions and the adequacy of the facilityโs response to falls and proceeded with its \ninvestigation. \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.                                     Page 11 of 17 \nCase No. 3:12-cv-_____ (___) \n \nCase 3:12-cv-00050-JWS   Document 1   Filed 03/01/12   Page 11 of 17\n\n40.  In order to assess the sufficiency of the surveys and licensing inspections conducted by \nthe Certification and Licensing and determine if the Plans of Correction approved by Certification \nand Licensing concerning residents falls were appropriate and had been properly implemented, the \nDisability Law Center requested the survey and licensing files that contain all of the documents \nunderlying the Statements of Deficiencies and Plans of Correction concerning the Seward Mountain \nHaven Nursing Facility, including, but not limited to, the surveyorsโ notes, file reviews, interview \nnotes and other documents generated as a result of the survey. \n41.  The Disability Law Centerโs requests for the certification and licensing files were \ndenied by Certification and Licensing. \n42.  To date, the files have not been released or made available to the Disability Law Center \nand the Disability Law Center continues to have grave concerns regarding the state and federal \noversight of the Seward Mountain Haven Nursing Facility, especially with regard to residentโs \nquality of care and safety as it appears the issue of resident falls has not subsided. \n43.  The information in the surveyorโs notes, file reviews and interview notes is essential for \nthe Disability Law Center to determine whether the surveying and investigation system worked.  \nBecause there have been a series of citations and corrective plans, it is very important for the \nDisability Law Center to be able to review those materials to see what the surveyors learned about \nhow the facility had been responding to earlier versions of the citations and corrective action plans. \nDisability Law Center, Inc. v. Alaska Dept. of Health and Social Services, et al.

Only through obtaining the requested documentation from Certification and Licensing \ncan the Disability Law Center determine whether Certification and Licensing is adequately carrying \nout its investigatory responsibilities under state and federal law and ensuring that residents of the \nSeward  Mountain  Haven  Nursing  Facility  receive  adequate  and  appropriate  care  in  a  safe \nenvironment and that the rash of falls experienced by residents over the last two years are abated and \nappropriate fall precautions are implemented by the facility. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043 \n \n45.  Plaintiff incorporates all preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. \n46.
