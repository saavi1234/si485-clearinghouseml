Represented by itself, DLC alleged that the District violated the DD Act when they refused to provide DLC with a teacher&rsquo;s personnel file and records concerning post-investigation measures undertaken by the District against this teacher. Judge Timothy Mark Burgess presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit began after DLC received a complaint that a District-employed special education teacher abused students with disabilities. DLC began an investigation under its DD Act authority, through which they sought the teacher&rsquo;s personnel file. DLC also sought records of any remedial measures the District took following its own investigation into the teacher&rsquo;s conduct. The District refused to provide the personnel file, and said they did not have any physical records of post-investigation measures taken against the teacher.&nbsp; DLC and the district resolved the personnel file with an agreement allowing DLC to review that file.&nbsp; The only issue remaining was about post-investigation records.&nbsp; On August 14, 2007, the court ruled that while the District must provide records of any post-investigation records taken against the teacher, they were not required to create a new document detailing these measures under the DD Act. The case closed following this decision, on August 15, 2007.</p>",

DLC is mandated to investigate reports of abuse and neglect involving individuals \nwith disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(1) - (2). In order to aid these investigations, DLC has \nfederal  statutory  authority  to  access  certain  records  under  the  Developmental  Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (the DD Act).1 42 U.S.C. §15043.2  \n                                                 \n1 42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq. and the regulations promulgated thereunder. \n2 The investigation underlying the instant litigation involves individuals with developmental disabilities, therefore \nDLC’s access authority is found in the DD Act. However, DLC has substantially similar access authority provided \nin the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI) 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., and the \nProtection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of the Rehabilitation Act (PAIR) 29 U.S.C. § 794e. \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 1 of 7 \nCase No. 3:06-cv-00216 (TMB) \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nFACTS \n  DLC received a report of abuse by and/or involving a special education teacher at Finger \nLake Elementary School during the 2005-2006 school year. This report alleged several types of \ninappropriate behavior by a teacher (hereinafter “the Teacher) towards elementary age students \nwith disabilities.3 After receiving this report, DLC contacted the principal of the school and \nrequested a copy of the Finger Lake’s internal investigation into the matter and arranged a \nmeeting with the principal. A DLC investigator met with the principal and obtained copies of \nmiscellaneous materials related to the District’s investigation into the allegations of abuse. After \nreviewing these materials, DLC determined that a DLC investigation into the allegations was \nnecessary based on the severity of the conduct alleged, the potential for ongoing abuse or \nneglect, and the vulnerable nature of the children involved. \n  DLC communicated its concerns to the attorney for the school district. In addition to \nseveral other requests, DLC requested documentation of the steps the district took as a result of \ntheir investigation to ensure the safety of the students and copies of any and all disciplinary \nreports, file notes, incident reports and similar documents in the Teacher’s personnel file. The \ndistrict refused to provide DLC with the requested information from the Teacher’s personnel file \nand refused to provide documentation of the actions taken as a result of their investigation. Given \nDLC’s statutory authority to access the requested materials, DLC filed a complaint in this court \nin an attempt to compel the district to provide the requested materials. \nSTANDARD \n  Motions for summary judgment are governed by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  Rule  56  provides  that  judgment,  “shall  be  rendered  forthwith  if  the  pleadings, \n                                                 \n3 Reported abuse/neglect includes inappropriate use of restraint, force feeding children, inappropriate physical \ncontact with students, and yelling and/or screaming at children. \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 2 of 7 \nCase No. 3:06-cv-00216 (TMB) \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if \nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \n  The initial burden is on the moving party, to demonstrate that “there is no genuine issue \nas to any material fact” Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c). The burden then shifts to the non-moving party to \nestablish that a genuine issue as to any material fact actually does exist. Matsushita Elec. Indus. \nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). The moving party is entitled to summary \njudgment if the non-moving party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of \nan element, which is essential to the non-moving party’s case and upon which the non-moving \nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). \nTo demonstrate a genuine issue, the non-moving party “must do more than simply show that \nthere is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. … Where the record taken as a whole \ncould not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no ‘genuine issue \nfor trial.’” Matsushita 475 U.S. at 587. (internal citation omitted)  \nARGUMENT \n45 C.F.R. 1386.22(b)(2) grants DLC access to reports prepared by or for a facility that \ndescribe: \n(i) Abuse, neglect, injury, death; (ii) The steps taken to investigate \nthe  incidents;  (iii)  Reports  and  records,  including  personnel \nrecords, prepared or maintained by the facility in connection with \nsuch reports of incidents; or, (iv) Supporting information that was \nrelied  upon  in  creating  a  report,  including  all  information  and \nrecords which describe persons who were interviewed, physical \nand  documentary  evidence  that  was  reviewed,  and  the  related \ninvestigative findings \n \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 3 of 7 \nCase No. 3:06-cv-00216 (TMB) \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nDuring the course of its investigation of Defendant District, DLC requested various \nmaterials, including any internal report prepared by the district or school regarding the incident, \ndocumentation of the steps the district took as a result of their investigation to ensure the safety \nof the students and copies of any and all disciplinary reports, file notes, incident reports and \nsimilar documents in the teacher’s personnel file.  \nDefendant District provided what they alleged to be the internal investigation (although it \nappears to be incomplete) but declined to provide documentation of the steps taken to ensure \nstudent safety and the requested portions of the teacher’s personnel file. It is clear that the \nrequested information falls within DLC’s statutory access authority, and Defendant District has \nprovided no sufficient justification for its refusal to comply with DLC’s repeated requests. \nI.  Documentation of remedial measures taken by the school and/or district are \nwithin DLC’s access authority. \n45  C.F.R.  §  1386.22(b)(2)  clearly  states  “Reports  prepared  …  by  or  for  such  facility” \nregarding incidents of abuse or neglect are within DLC’s access authority. Additionally, 45 \nC.F.R. § 1386(b)(2)(iv) states that “Supporting information that was relied upon in creating a \nreport, including all information and records which describe persons who were interviewed, \nphysical and documentary evidence that was reviewed, and the related investigative findings”. \n(emphasis added).  \nDefendant purported to comply with DLC’s request for its internal investigation report and \nrelated materials. See Exhibit A to Affidavit of Ronald Cowan. It is clear that a complete \ninvestigative report was not provided. Nowhere, in the materials provided, did the district clearly \noutline their findings, or describe what remedial steps would be taken at the conclusion of the \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 4 of 7 \nCase No. 3:06-cv-00216 (TMB) \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n\ninvestigation. Of particular importance to DLC is what steps the school took as a result of their \ninvestigation.  \nThis type of information falls clearly within the limits of both 45 C.F.R. § 1386(b)(2)(iv) and \n45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(b)(2)(iii). There must be some documentation or record that outlines what \nsteps were taken by the school following the investigation. That information must be provided to \nDLC in compliance with the DD Act. DLC is aware of several steps allegedly taken by the \nschool, however, documentation of those steps is required to ensure student safety, and to \ndetermine whether the school acted appropriately given the severity of the alleged abuse.4 \nII.  Teacher’s personnel file falls within DLC’s statutory authority. \n45 C.F.R. § 1386 (b)(2)(iii) states that DLC’s authority entitles it to “Reports and records, \nincluding personnel records, prepared or maintained by the facility in connection with such \nreports of incidents.” (emphasis added). This regulation is unambiguous in its requirements. \nPersonnel files, at a minimum the portion of personnel files relating to incidents of abuse and \nneglect, are within DLC’s access authority and must be provided. DLC requested the materials \nseveral times and cited the above regulations in support of its request, but Defendant refused to \ncomply. \nIn addition, 45 C.F.R. § 1386(b)(2)(iv) states that “Supporting information that was relied \nupon in creating a report, including all information and records which describe persons who \nwere  interviewed,  physical  and  documentary  evidence  that  was  reviewed,  and  the  related \ninvestigative findings” (emphasis added). In an interview with the Finger Lake Elementary \nSchool Principal, DLC Investigator Ronald Cowan asked whether the Teacher’s personnel file \n                                                 \n4 The school principal and counsel for the defendant have identified several steps taken, including a reduction in \nclass size, additional training of some sort, and moving the Teacher’s classroom to a more centrally located and \neasily supervised location. \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 5 of 7 \nCase No. 3:06-cv-00216 (TMB) \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n\nwas used or relied upon during the course of the investigation and in the determination of what \nremedial measures were necessary. See Affidavit of Ronald Cowan. The principal confirmed that \nthe  personnel  file  had  been  used  during  the  investigation  and  during  the  determination  of \nremedial measures. Id. Thus, it is clear that the personnel file, in its entirety, falls within 45 \nC.F.R. § 1386(b)(2)(iv) as both “information relied upon in creating a report” and “documentary \nevidence that was reviewed”, and so should have been provided to DLC when requested. \nCONCLUSION \n  Given the unambiguous language in the above cited statutes and regulations, it is clear \nthat all of the requested records and other materials are well within DLC’s access authority. Thus \nDefendant’s refusal to provide the requested materials is in violation of the DD Act. For the \nforegoing reasons, Plaintiff hereby moves the court to award summary judgment in Plaintiff’s \nfavor by ordering the following: \n1.  Defendant must immediately provide DLC with copies of the entire internal investigation \nand related materials, including any and all documentation referencing remedial measures \ntaken as a result of the investigation. \n2.  Defendant must immediately provide DLC the entire personnel file of the Teacher. \n3.  In the alternative, Defendant must immediately provide to the court for its review, the \nentire personnel file of the Teacher. The court will then review said file and provide to \nDLC the portions of the Teacher’s personnel file that reference any and all incidents of \nreported or suspected abuse and/or neglect, any and all references to parent or student \ncomplaints  or  concerns  regarding  potential  abuse  and/or  neglect,  and  any  and  all \nreferences  to  discipline  and/or  remedial  measures  taken  as  a  result  of  such  reports, \ncomplaints or concerns. \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 6 of 7 \nCase No. 3:06-cv-00216 (TMB) \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n\n4.  In the alternative, Defendant must immediately provide DLC with the portions of the \nTeacher’s personnel file that reference any and all incidents of reported or suspected \nabuse  and/or  neglect,  any  discipline,  any  and  all  references  to  parent  or  student \ncomplaints or concerns regarding potential abuse and/or neglect, and/or any and all \nremedial measures taken as a result of such reports \n5.  Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs for the pursuit of this action. \n6.

INTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff, Disability Law Center of Alaska (hereinafter “DLC”), filed a complaint \nalleging a violation of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of \n2000 at 42 U.S.C. § 15041 et seq. (hereinafter “DD Act”).  In that complaint, DLC alleged \nthat the defendant, Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District (hereinafter “the District”), \nviolated  the  DD  Act,  more  specifically  the  implementing  regulation  45  CFR  § \n1386.22(b)(2), by declining to produce a teacher’s personnel file and written documentation \nof post-investigation measures undertaken by the District.   \nMore  than  five  months  since  filing  its  complaint,  and  nearly  six  months  since \nInvestigator Cowan completed his investigation, DLC has filed a motion for summary \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 1 \n\njudgment to compel the District to produce the teacher’s personnel file and other documents.  \nDuring all of that time, the teacher whose alleged improper conduct was the basis of DLC’s \ninvestigation, at the beginning of the school year, has remained in her classroom with no \nfurther reports of complaints from students, parents, or anyone else. \nAs discussed below, the regulation upon which DLC relies does not provide for the \nrelief requested, and the complaint on its face, therefore, fails to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted.  Furthermore, the fact that the teacher at issue has remained in the \nclassroom for nearly an entire school year without incident, during which time DLC has \ndone  nothing  by  way  of  further  investigation,  belies  DLC’s  position  that  it  needs  her \npersonnel  file  to  meet  its  statutory  obligations  under  the  DD  Act.    For  these  reasons, \ndiscussed more fully below, the District requests that the court dismiss the case, with \nprejudice, in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. \nII.  FACTS \nAccording to the complaint, on or about May 22, 2006, DLC received a report of \nabuse by and/or involving a special education teacher (Ms. M) at Finger Lake Elementary \nSchool during the 2005-2006 school year.  See Complaint at 2, ¶5.  The report alleged \ncertain  inappropriate  behavior  by  that  teacher  towards  elementary  age  students  with \ndisabilities.  See id. at ¶6. \nOn Thursday, August 24, 2006, a DLC investigator met with the principal of Finger \nLake Elementary, David Nufer, and obtained copies of certain materials related to the \nDistrict’s investigation into the allegations of abuse.  See id. at ¶9.  The following day, DLC \nrequested that the District remove the teacher from the classroom, arrange for interviews of \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 2 \n\nstaff members, produce directory information of the students in the classroom, and produce \nthe teacher’s personnel file.  See id. at 3, ¶11.   \nOn August 28, 2006, the District rejected DLC’s request to remove the teacher from \nthe classroom and declined to produce the teacher’s personnel file, but permitted voluntary \ninterviews to go forward.  See id. at ¶12.  On Wednesday, August 30, 2006, a DLC \ninvestigator interviewed several staff members.  The teacher declined to submit to interview.  \nSee id. at ¶14.  The interviews described some instances of abuse by the teacher during the \n2005-06 school year. See id. at ¶15.  Also on August 30, 2006, the District provided DLC \nwith directory information as requested. See id. at 4, ¶17. \nOn September 5, 2006, DLC requested that the District provide written confirmation \nof steps it had taken to ensure the safety of students.  See id. at ¶18.  DLC also again \nrequested that the District produce the teacher’s entire personnel file, under authority it \nperceived from 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2).  See id.  The District declined to produce the \npersonnel file and written documentation of steps taken as a result of its investigation. See \nid. at ¶19. \nAs a result of his investigation, Principal Nufer put several measures in place to \naddress the allegations of abuse.  Specifically, he changed the location of Ms. M’s classroom \nso that it was located near his office and near the nurse’s station in order to provide Ms. M \nwith additional support. See Exhibit 1 (Affidavit of David Nufer), ¶9.  He reduced her class \nsize and assigned a new teacher’s aide. See id., ¶¶10-11.  He informed affected staff about \nthe changes he had made. See id., ¶13.   \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 3 \n\nPrincipal Nufer did not memorialize the changes in classroom location, size, and \nteacher’s aide assignment in any written document, although he did verbally inform DLC \nInvestigator Cowan that he had made these changes. See id., ¶¶12-13. \nIn conducting his investigation, Principal Nufer did not refer to or rely on Ms. M’s \npersonnel  file,  nor  did  he  review  or  access  information  in  her  personnel  file  when \nimplementing measures following his investigation. See id., ¶6.  Like all teachers’ personnel \nfiles, Ms. M’s file is located at the District’s central office in Palmer and is not maintained at \nFinger Lake Elementary, which is located in Wasilla. See Exhibit 2 (Affidavit of Katie \nGardner), ¶2.  If Principal Nufer had wanted to access Ms. M’s personnel file, he would \nhave had to do so through the District’s central office. See id., ¶3.  He never did so. See id., \n¶¶5-7. \nIn its complaint, DLC has requested that this Court order the District to produce Ms. \nM’s  entire  personnel  file  and  written  documentation  of  steps  taken  as  a  result  of  the \nDistrict’s investigation into alleged abuse.  The complaint fails to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted.  While the District agrees that this lawsuit should be decided, as a \nmatter of law, on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, it is the District’s \nposition that its cross-motion for summary judgment should be granted and the complaint \ndismissed, with prejudice.   \nIII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW \nUpon motion, summary judgment should be granted if there is no genuine dispute as \nto a material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nFed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  The moving party has the initial burden of showing that there is no \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 4 \n\ngenuine dispute as to a material fact.1  The moving party does not have to present evidence, \nbut instead need only point out the lack of any genuine dispute as to any material fact.2  \nOnce the moving party has met its initial burden, the nonmoving party must set forth \nevidence of specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial.3  All evidence \npresented by the nonmoving party must be believed for purposes of summary judgment, and \nall justifiable inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.4  The nonmoving \nparty, however, may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must show that there is \nsufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute to require a fact-finder to resolve \nthe parties’ differing versions of the truth at trial.5\nIV.  ARGUMENT \nDLC’s complaint presents a single claim.  See Complaint at 4, ¶20.  Its claim is that \nthe District violated a regulation promulgated pursuant to the DD Act in two ways: (1) by \ndeclining to produce Ms. M’s entire personnel file; and (2) by declining to produce written \ndocuments that show what protective measures the District took as a result of its internal \ninvestigation. See Complaint at 4-5, ¶20.  The pertinent facts are not in dispute:  DLC \nrequested production of Ms. M’s personnel file and written documentation of any post-\ninvestigation safety measures undertaken, and the District declined DLC’s request.  Whether \nDLC is entitled to the documents requested can be decided as a matter of law on the parties’ \ncross-motions for summary judgment.   \n                                                 \n1   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).   \n2   Id. at 323-25. \n3   Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248-49 (1986). \n4   Id. at 255. \n5   Id. at 248-49. \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 5 \n\nIn its complaint, DLC alleged that 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2)(ii)-(iii) supports its \nrequest for relief.  See Complaint at 4.  In its motion for summary judgment, DLC also relies \non subsection (b)(2)(iv) of the regulation.  The regulation at issue, 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2), \nwas promulgated to implement that portion of the DD Act which permits restricted access to \nrecords and provides in relevant part: \n(b)  Individual records to which P&A [Protection and Advocacy] systems \nmust have access under § 142(A)(2)(i) (whether written or in another \nmedium,  draft  or  final,  including  handwritten  notes,  electronic  files, \nphotographs or video or audiotape records) shall include, but shall not be \nlimited to: \n. . . \n \n(2) reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating incidents \nof abuse or neglect, injury or death occurring at a facility or while \nthe individual with a developmental disability is under the care of a \nmember of the staff of a facility, or by or for such facility, that \ndescribe any or all of the following:   \n \n. . . \n \n(ii)  the steps taken to investigate the incidents; \n(iii)  reports  and  records,  including  personnel  records, \nprepared or maintained by the facility in connection \nwith such reports of incidents; or, \n(iv)  Supporting  information  that  was  relied  upon  in \ncreating  a  report,  including  all  information  and \nrecords  which  describe  persons  who  were \ninterviewed, physical and documentary evidence that \nwas reviewed, and the related investigative findings; \nand \n \n. . . \n(emphasis added). \n \nDLC alleges that the regulatory language quoted above provides the authority for its \nproduction request. See Complaint at 4-5 (Relief Requested).  DLC’s interpretation of the \nregulation is supported neither by the language of the regulation nor by any court decision. \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 6 \n\nA.  The  regulation  does  not  require  the  District  to  produce  written \ndocumentation of post-investigation measures taken as a result of its \ninternal investigation. \n \nDLC  has  requested  that  the  court  order  the  District  to  produce  any  written \ndocumentation of steps or measures taken by the District after its investigation into the \nallegations of abuse.  See Complaint at 4-5.  In its motion for summary judgment, DLC \ncontends that 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2)(iii) and (iv) support its request for any written reports \nof remedial measures. See DLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment at 4.  DLC misconstrues \nthe plain language of the regulation. \nThe ninth circuit has directed that “[a] regulation should be construed to give effect \nto the natural and plain meaning of its words.”6  The words of 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2) state \nthat a Protection and Advocacy agency (“P&A”), like DLC, can access certain reports \nprepared by a facility that provides services to individuals who qualify for protection under \nthe DD Act.  The regulation specifies which reports are subject to disclosure.  The regulation \nstates that reports that describe “steps taken to investigate the incidents” are subject to \ndisclosure.7  There is no dispute that the District has already produced the investigative \nreport prepared by Principal Nufer.  See Complaint at 2, ¶¶8-9; see Exhibit 1 (Affidavit of \nDavid Nufer), ¶4.   \nThe  regulation  also  allows  DLC  to  access  reports  prepared  by  Finger  Lake \nElementary that may or may not describe “reports and records, including personnel records \nprepared or maintained by [Finger Lake Elementary] in connection with [the allegations of \n                                                 \n6   Bayview Hunters Point Community Advocates v. Metropolitan Transp. Com’n., 366 \nF.3d 692, 698 (9th Cir. 2004). \n7   See 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2)(ii).   \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 7 \n\nabuse at the school].”8  The only report prepared by Finger Lake Elementary that may \ndescribe this information is Principal Nufer’s investigative report which has already been \nproduced.  Notably, Principal Nufer’s report does not reference any personnel records or \nremedial information.   \nFinally,  DLC  can  access  reports  prepared  by  Finger  Lake  Elementary  in  its \ninvestigation of the allegations of abuse that describe “[s]upporting information that was \nrelied upon in creating a report,” together with “the related investigative findings.”9  The \nonly report prepared by the District is the Finger Lake Elementary report prepared by \nPrincipal Nufer.  As mentioned above, his report has been produced. \nThe words of the regulation say nothing about access to any document that describes \nremedial steps taken by the District after its investigation is completed and its investigative \nreport is issued.   \nThe District has produced all records to which DLC may have access under 45 CFR \n§ 1386.22(b)(2).  The regulation does not require the additional access DLC seeks.   \n  B.  Information regarding remediation has been provided.\n  Notwithstanding the lack of regulatory directive to produce information regarding \nremediation, the District has verbally informed DLC of the measures taken upon completion \nof its investigation.  Principal Nufer’s sworn affidavit accompanying this motion again sets \nout the information previously provided to DLC regarding measures that he put in place at \nthe school following his investigation. See Ex. 1 (Nufer Aff.) ¶¶9-12.  He did not create a \nwritten document listing these measures, but he did discuss the measures with the affected \nmembers of his staff as is customarily done when changes of this sort are made in the \n                                                 \n8   45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2)(iii). \n9   45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2)(iv).   \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 8 \n\nschool.  See id. ¶13.  DLC’s request for a narrative report regarding this information would \nrequire the District to create a written document in order to provide DLC with information \nthat it already has.  Its request for such relief is not only unauthorized under the DD Act and \nits regulation, but is also unnecessary. \nC.  The regulation does not allow blanket access to Ms. M’s entire personnel \nfile. \n \nThe plain language of 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2)(iii) does not require the District to \nallow DLC blanket access Ms. M’s entire personnel file.  Rather, the regulation requires the \nDistrict to allow access to any report prepared at Finger Lake Elementary that describes any \npersonnel record prepared in connection with the District’s investigation into the allegations \nof abuse.  The regulation does not authorize direct access to an entire personnel file; rather, \nit allows DLC to access reports, such as Principal Nufer’s investigation report, which may or \nmay not refer to personnel records.  That his report has been produced and demonstrated no \ndescription of any personnel record makes the relevancy or accessibility of Ms. M’s entire \npersonnel file even more questionable. \nDLC attempts to bring the personnel file within the ambit of the regulation by \nasserting  that  Principal  Nufer  referred  to  and  relied  upon  Ms.  M’s  personnel  file  in \nconducting his investigation and in formulating remedial measures. See DLC’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment at 5-6 (citing Affidavit of Ronald Cowan).  DLC maintains that the \npersonnel file was “supporting information that was relied upon in creating a report” within \nthe meaning of 45 CFR § 1386.22(b)(2)(iv). Id. at 5.  DLC’s reliance is based upon both a \nmisinterpretation of the regulation and upon a mistaken assumption by Investigator Cowan.   \nFirst, as discussed above, subsection (b)(2)(iv) does not allow direct access to an \nentire personnel file, but rather allows access to reports prepared by the school that describe \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 9 \n\nsupporting information that was relied upon in creating the report, even if the information \nbeing described happens to be a personnel record.  Principal Nufer’s report neither describes \nnor indicates that he relied upon Ms. M’s personnel file in any way.   \nSecond, the absence of any reference in his report to Mr. M’s personnel file is not \ndifficult to explain, since Principal Nufer did not rely upon, or even refer to her personnel \nfile during his investigation or thereafter. See Ex. 1 (Nufer Affidavit), ¶¶5-6; see also \nExhibit 2 (Affidavit of Katie Gardner), ¶¶5-7.  In fact, Ms. M’s personnel file, like all other \nteachers’ personnel files is maintained at the District’s central office and restricted from \nunsupervised access. See Ex. 2 (Gardner Aff.), ¶¶2-3.    \nFinally, that access to a teacher’s personnel file is not required by the regulation is \nnot surprising in light of the purpose of the access to records provisions in the DD Act.  The \nAct  and  regulation  pertain  primarily  to  the  records  of  individuals  with  developmental \ndisabilities, namely students who are eligible for protection under the DD Act.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I) (pertaining to access to records of individuals with developmental \ndisabilities);  45  CFR  §  1386.22(b)(2)  (same).    Neither  the  Act  nor  the  implementing \nregulation at issue in this lawsuit authorize an agency like DLC blanket access a teacher’s \nentire personnel file. \nD.  Alaska law restricts the release of personnel files. \nThe absence of any express reference to access to personnel files in the regulation \nmust be considered together with the restrictions pertaining to disclosure of personnel files \nunder Alaska law.  Specifically, under 4 AAC 19.040, documents in a teacher’s personnel \nfile are not a matter of public record.  In fact, the regulation prohibits the District from \ndisclosing to anyone other than the teacher, or certain supervisory personnel, the teacher’s \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 10 \n\nprofessional  evaluation  or  any  document  in  the  teacher’s  personnel  file  used  in  the \npreparation  of  the  evaluation.    Thus,  a  teacher’s  personnel  file  is  exempt  from  public \ninspection under Alaska’s Public Records Act, which provides that “records required to be \nkept confidential by a federal law or regulation or by state law [i.e. 4 AAC 19.040]” are \nexcepted from the Act’s general requirement that public records be available for public \ninspection.10   \nFurthermore, District policy implements 4 AAC 19.040 and provides that teachers’ \npersonnel files are to be maintained as confidential. See Exhibit 3 (Board Policy regarding \nPersonnel Records).   DLC should not be allowed to circumvent 4 AAC 19.040 and District \npolicy by relying on a federal regulation that does not provide for the blanket access to \npersonnel files. \nE.  There is no other authority for permitting DLC the unrestricted access it \nseeks. \n \nIt  is  worth  noting  that  DLC  does  not  cite  to  a  single  decision  from  any  court \nregarding the scope of the DD Act’s records access provisions.  Admittedly, there does not \nappear to be a published decision in which a court has decided the particular questions \nregarding access to records that are presented in this lawsuit.  There are a few decisions, \nhowever, including decisions by federal circuit courts, which deal with access to records \nunder the DD Act and its regulations.  \nThe most recent circuit court opinions are from the seventh and second circuits. \nWhile neither decision addresses the specific dispute at issue here, both decisions contain a \nuseful discussion of a P&A’s authority to access certain records under the DD Act. \n                                                 \n10   AS 40.25.120. \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 11 \n\nFirst, in a dispute arising in Wisconsin, the seventh circuit was asked to determine \nwhether and to what extent the plaintiff P&A could access records uncovered during an \ninvestigation by a state agency into allegations of abuse in an elementary school.11  In \nrequesting access to records in that case, the P&A argued that it had blanket authority to \naccess all records to investigate allegations of abuse, whether or not parental authorization \nwas obtained.12  The court rejected the P&A’s argument, concluding that a P&A does not \nhave blanket authority to access  records in conducting an investigation, but that its authority \nis limited to that authorized under the DD Act and its regulations and must be balanced \nagainst the privacy rights of parents and students.13\nSimilarly, in a case arising in Connecticut and also involving a P&A’s investigation \nof abuse at a school, the second circuit court construed the language of the DD Act and its \nregulation  to  determine  how  much  access  the  agency  should  have  to  conduct  its \ninvestigation.14  The court explained that the Act allowed a P&A to have reasonable access \nto the school, and directory information, in order to investigate specific allegations of abuse \nsupported by probable cause.15  Here, the District has already provided that access.   \n                                                 \n11   Disability Rights Wisconsin, Inc. v. State of Wisconsin Dept. of Pub. Inst., 463 F.3d \n719 (7th Cir. 2006).   \n12   See id. at 727. \n13   See id. 727-30. \n14   State of Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 464 F.3d 229 (2nd Cir. 2006).  \n15   See id. at 242-46. \nDisability Law Center vs. Mat-Su Borough School District   Case No. 3:06-CV-00216 TMB \nDefendant’s Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment  \nand Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment  Page 12 \n\nSeveral other courts have also discussed the DD Act’s provisions for access to \nrecords.16  It is worth noting that in the cases where courts granted access to plaintiff P&As, \nit  was  access  that  the  District  has  already  provided  in  this  case;  that  is,  access  to \ninvestigation reports, directory information, facilities, and staff for interviews.  No court has \nordered the production of a teacher’s entire personnel file as is requested here. \nF.  There is no basis for in camera review. \nFor the first time in its motion for summary judgment, DLC suggests that the court \ncould conduct an in camera review of Ms. M’s personnel file before deciding what portions \nof it to disclose to DLC.  Because there is no basis under the DD Act or its implementing \nregulations to support a request for production of any part of the personnel file, there is no \nbasis nor purpose for conducting an in camera review.  The District has already fully \ncooperated with DLC’s request for access to the school, to staff, and to pertinent records.  \nNothing further is required under the Act.  \nV.  CONCLUSION\n  DLC has requested access to records, including a blanket request for a teacher’s \npersonnel file, which is not authorized under the DD Act, its regulations, or by any court \ndecision.  The District fully cooperated with DLC in its investigation by providing directory \ninformation, allowing access to the school and for interviews with staff, and by providing \n                                                 \n16   See e.g. State of Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with \nDisabilities v.

The District also verbally informed DLC of \nmeasures that had been taken at Finger Lake Elementary to address classroom location, class \nsize  and  other  issues  in  response  to  Principal  Nufer’s  investigation.    Adjustments  to \nclassroom location, class size, and similar measures of the sort put in place by Principal \nNufer in this case are not customarily reduced to writing, were not in this case, and no such \nwritten documentation is required under the DD Act. \nMeanwhile, Ms. M has remained in the classroom with Principal Nufer’s measures \nin place for nearly an entire school year and for more than six months since DLC completed \nits investigation.  During this time, there have been no complaints about Ms. M.  The \nDistrict  has  met  any  obligations  it  had  under  the  DD  Act  to  cooperate  with  DLC’s \ninvestigation, and nothing more is required.  There being no basis for the relief requested \nunder the DD Act and its regulations, the District requests that its cross-motion for summary \njudgment be granted, DLC’s motion be denied, and the complaint dismissed in its entirety.   \nDATED this 1st day of March, 2007, at Anchorage, Alaska. \n          HOLMES WEDDLE & BARCOTT, P.C. \n \n \n \n \n          By   s/Matthew K.

      "text": "MINUTES OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nDISTRICT OF ALASKA\nDisability Law Center of Alaska v. Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District\nCase No. 3:06-cv-00216 TMB\nBy: THE HONORABLE TIMOTHY M. BURGESS\nPROCEEDINGS: ORDER FROM CHAMBERS\nAt Docket No. 31, Plaintiff filed a status report informing the Court that the parties\nconferred via telephone, and Plaintiff learned that Defendant reviewed the personnel file at issue\nand found no reports, complaints, allegations or investigations of abuse or neglect.  Plaintiff also\ninformed the Court that Defendant was planning to file an affidavit to that effect.  Plaintiff then\nrequested that the Court issue a ruling relating to DLC’s request for additional information about\nany remedial measures taken by Defendant as a result of its investigation.  \nAt Docket No. 33, Defendant filed a reply to Plaintiff’s status report, attaching an\nunsigned affidavit stating that nothing in the personnel file fell within DLC’s request.  Defendant\nalso argued that the Court should dismiss the case because the information about remedial\nmeasures that DLC requested has already been given to DLC orally and Defendant should not\nhave to create a document that does not already exist in order to respond to DLC’s information\nrequest.  \nPlaintiff filed a request for a status conference in response.  Plaintiff noted that if a signed\nand notarized affidavit was filed, the dispute over the personnel file would be resolved.  A\nsigned, notarized affidavit was filed at Docket No. 36, and therefore, the Court deems the\npersonnel file issue to be resolved.  \n\nWith respect to the remedial measures, the Court agrees that Defendant is not required to\ncreate any documents to satisfy DLC’s information request.  Under 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22:\n(b) Individual records to which P&A systems must have access under section\n142(A)(2)(I) (whether written or in another medium, draft or final, including handwritten\nnotes, electronic files, photographs or video or audio tape records) shall include, but shall\nnot be limited to:\n(2) Reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating incidents of abuse\nor neglect, injury or death occurring at a facility or while the individual with a\ndevelopmental disability is under the care of a member of the staff of a facility, or\nby or for such facility, that describe any or all of the following:\n(i) Abuse, neglect, injury, death;\n(ii) The steps taken to investigate the incidents;\n(iii) Reports and records, including personnel records, prepared or maintained by\nthe facility in connection with such reports of incidents; or,\n(iv) Supporting information that was relied upon in creating a report, including all\ninformation and records which describe persons who were interviewed, physical\nand documentary evidence that was reviewed, and the related investigative\nfindings.\nThe Court concludes that, if any written materials documenting remedial measures exist,\nDefendant is required to produce them.  But under the statutes and regulations cited, Defendant is\nnot required to create documentation where none exists.  \nSeeing no need for a status conference, the Court hereby DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for a\nstatus conference at Docket No. 35.  Since the parties have resolved the personnel file issue\nthrough a negotiated compromise, the motions for summary judgment at Docket Nos. 12 and 15\nare hereby DENIED in part as moot.  The Court concludes that Defendant is required to provide\nto Plaintiff any documentation of remedial measures that exists, but is not required to create any\n2\n\ndocumentation that does not exist.  Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment at Docket No. 12\nwith respect to remedial measures is therefore GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  For the\nsame reasons, Defendant’s cross-motion for summary judgment at Docket No. 15 with respect to\nremedial measures is hereby GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nEntered at the direction of the Honorable Timothy M. Burgess, United States District Judge.\nDATE: August 14, 2007\n3",

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. This is an action \nbrought to secure rights conferred by the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of \nRights Act of 2000 at 42 U.S.C. § 15041 et seq (DD Act). \n2.   Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391.  Defendant, Matanuska-Susitna \nBorough School District (MSBSD), has its principal place of business within the District of \nAlaska and all of the events giving rise to this action occurred in the District of Alaska.  \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 1 of 5 \nComplaint \nCase 3:06-cv-00216-TMB   Document 1   Filed 09/13/06   Page 1 of 5\n\n \nPARTIES \n3.   Disability  Law  Center  of  Alaska  (DLC)  is  the  federally  mandated  protection  and \nadvocacy agency for the State of Alaska, established to protect the rights of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities.  \n4.   MSBSD is the school district responsible for the elementary school where the events \ngiving rise to this action occurred, and they are responsible for hiring, firing and disciplining its \nteacher employees.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n5.   On or about May 22, 2006, DLC received a report of abuse by and/or involving a special \neducation teacher, Ms. M1, at Finger Lake Elementary School during the 2005-2006 school year. \n6.   This  report  alleged  several  types  of  inappropriate  behavior  by  a  teacher,  Ms.  M, \nincluding force-feeding of and excessive and inappropriate restraint towards elementary age \nstudents with disabilities, at least some of whom were non-verbal. \n7.   This report also alleged that as a result of these inappropriate behaviors, one parent \nremoved her child from the classroom before the end of the school year. \n8.   After receiving this report, DLC contacted the principal of the school and requested a \ncopy of Finger Lake’s principal’s internal investigation into the matter and arranged a meeting \nwith the principal. \n9.   On Thursday, August 24, 2006 a DLC investigator met with the principal and obtained \ncopies of various materials related to the principal’s investigation into the allegations of abuse. \n                                                 \n1 Given the relatively cooperative spirit of interactions thus far between MSBSD and DLC, the name of the teacher \ninvolved has been kept confidential in this document.  \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 2 of 5 \nComplaint \nCase 3:06-cv-00216-TMB   Document 1   Filed 09/13/06   Page 2 of 5\n\n \n10.   After  reviewing  these  materials,  DLC  determined  that  an  investigation  into  the \nallegations was necessary based on the severity of the conduct alleged, the potential for ongoing \nabuse or neglect and the vulnerable nature of the children involved. \n11.   On August 25, 2006 DLC communicated its concerns to the attorney for the school \ndistrict. In that letter DLC, requested that Ms. M be removed from the classroom during the \ncourse of its investigation. In addition, DLC requested the directory information of the students \ncurrently in the classroom, as well as the information of those students in the classroom for the \n2005-2006 school year. DLC also requested that interviews be arranged with staff members \ninvolved in the schools investigation of the matter, as well as an interview with the teacher. \nFinally, DLC requested copies of any and all disciplinary reports, file notes, incident reports and \nsimilar documents in the teacher’s personnel file. \n12.   On August 28, 2006 the school district rejected DLC’s request to remove the teacher at \nissue from the classroom stating that “discipline has been imposed”. The district also refused to \nprovide DLC with the requested information from the teacher’s personnel file. \n13.   On or around August 29, 2006, in a telephone conversation between DLC and the \nattorney for the school district, the district made references to several actions taken as a result of \nthe investigation into the allegations of abuse, including additional training for Ms. M, a smaller \nclass size and a change in classroom location.  \n14.   On Wednesday, August 30, 2006, a DLC investigator undertook interviews with seven \nstaff members. However, Ms. M refused to participate in an interview with DLC. \n15.   The interviews confirmed and substantiated at least some instances of abuse towards \ndisabled children by Ms. M. during the 2005-2006 school year. \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 3 of 5 \nComplaint \nCase 3:06-cv-00216-TMB   Document 1   Filed 09/13/06   Page 3 of 5\n\n \n16.   During the course of the interviews the DLC investigator learned that Ms. M is alone \nwith the non-verbal, disabled 1st and 2nd grade students in her class for at least one hour a day. \n17.   On August 30, 2006 the district provided DLC with the requested directory information. \n18.   On September 5, 2006, DLC requested that written confirmation of the steps taken by the \ndistrict to ensure the safety of the students be provided. DLC again requested the teacher’s \npersonnel file citing 45 C.F.R. §1386.22(b)(2). DLC also indicated that based on its statutory \naccess authority, the requested documents must be provided within a three day period from the \ndate of the request.  \n19.   As of September 12, 2006, the district has refused to provide Ms. M’s personnel file, and \nhas not provided DLC with written confirmation regarding the safety of the students and the \nactions taken by the district as a result of the investigation. \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF NO. 1. \nVIOLATION OF 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(b)(2). \n20.  Defendant MSBSD has violated the DD Act by failing to allow DLC access to any \ndocumentation to establish the safety of the students and the personnel records of Ms. M and any \ndocumentation outlining what measures the district took as a result of their investigation of the \nallegations of abuse against her. 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(b)(2)(ii – iii). \n        RELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, pursuant to this Court’s authority and jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. § \n15041 et seq., DLC hereby requests that the Court: \n1.  Order MSBSD to provide DLC with a full and complete copy of the  personnel files of \nMs. M. \nDLC v. MSBSD    Page 4 of 5 \nComplaint \nCase 3:06-cv-00216-TMB   Document 1   Filed 09/13/06   Page 4 of 5\n\n \n2.   Order MSBSD to provide DLC with any documents relating to the steps they have taken \nas a result of their investigation into the allegations of abuse and to ensure the safety of the \nstudents. \n3.  Attorney fees and costs for the drafting of this complaint and reasonable attorneys’ fees \nand costs in the pursuit of this action. \n4.
