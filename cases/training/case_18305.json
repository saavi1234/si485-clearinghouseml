    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) agency&rsquo;s records access authority. On March 1, 2013, Disability Law Center of Arkansas (Arkansas P&amp;A) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Arkansas P&amp;A filed this lawsuit against Baptist Health, which operates multiple healthcare facilities in Arkansas. Arkansas P&amp;A alleged that Baptist Health violated the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights Act (PAIR Act) when they denied Arkansas P&amp;A records concerning three restraint-related deaths at Baptist facilities. Arkansas P&amp;A sought an order providing it access to the records and facilities, as well as attorneys' fees. Judge James Leon Holmes presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit began after the Arkansas P&amp;A received a notification from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that three Baptist facility residents died in restraints in a one-month period. Subsequently, the Arkansas P&amp;A requested records from Baptist concerning the deaths and practices concerning restraints. Baptist asserted that the P&amp;A could not access the records because none of the individuals had disabilities. Baptist also denied the P&amp;A access to its physical facilities to access these records, leading to Arkansas P&amp;A filing this lawsuit.</p>\r\n<p>On January 17, 2014, the Arkansas P&amp;A filed a Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents. The production of documents requests included the records at subject in the PAIR Act records request. On January 28, 2014, the court granted the Arkansas&rsquo;s P&amp;A in part, requiring that Baptist provide them with interrogatory answers and requests for production concerning Baptist&rsquo;s claim that the individual did not have a disability. However, the court denied the P&amp;A&rsquo;s other requests for interrogatories and production of documents. On July 24, 2014, the court granted the Arkansas P&amp;A's motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice. The case remains closed.</p>",

PLAINTIFF \nv.  Case No. l{~-c v-ID 2> \"':JLJ-1 \nBAPTIST HEALTH  DEFENDANT \nCOMPLAINT \nComes now the Plaintiff, Disability Rights Center of Arkansas, Inc., by and through its \nag~~stp~f9n~;; ~ ~/?\"I.J<--\n:::igned attorney, J. Paul Davidson, and for its Col!/f,J'Ft \n1.  The Disability Rights Center of Arkansas, Inc. (DRC) brings this action seeking \ndeclaratory and  injunctive relief to  compel  Defendant Baptist Health to  provide DRC  with \nmedical and related records pertaining to three (3) restraint related deaths that occurred in each \nof its facilities and more specifically, at Baptist Health Rehabilitation Institute on October 7, \n2012;  Baptist  Health  Medical  Center-North  Little  Rock  on  October  29,  2012;  and  Baptist \nMedical Center-Little Rock on October 31, 2012.1 \n2.  Pursuant to the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights Act (PAIR), 29 \nU.S.C. § 794e, DRC has a legal right to access the records regarding each individual's death. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This action arises under the PAIR Act and similar law analyzed below. \n4.  Jurisdiction is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331 as well as 28 U.S.C. § § 2201 \nand 2202. \n1 DRC does not know the identity of the three (3) deceased patients, but was notified of the deaths by the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services. The identity of the individuals, however, is irrelevant to the remedies DRC seeks \nat this time, except to the extent the individuals had disabilities and thus eligible for DRC services. The Defendant is \naware of the identity of the three individuals. \n1 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 2 of 47\n5.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) as a substantial part ofthe \nevents or omissions giving rise to this claim occurred in the judicial district of this Court. \nPARTIES \nA. The Plaintiff \n6.  Plaintiff DRC is  an  independent and private non-profit  corporation organized \nunder the laws of the State of Arkansas, and at all times relevant, DRC has been the statewide \nProtection and Advocacy (P&A) system designated by the Governor of the State of Arkansas to \nprotect and advocate for the legal and civil rights of those citizens in the State of Arkansas who \nhave disabilities pursuant to the following: the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights \nAct (PAIR), 29 U.S.C. § 794e; the Developmental Disabilities Act (DDA), 42 U.S.C. § 15041, et \nseq., the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAlMI), 42 U.S.C. § \n10801, et seq., and the Protection for Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injuries (PATBI), 42 \nU.S.C. § 300d-53. \n7.  This complaint involves activities undertaken by DRC pursuant to its duties and \nauthorities  set  forth  in  the  PAIR  Act.  The  PAIR  Act  specifically  incorporates  language, \nprocesses and procedures from the DDA. 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(2). \n8.  As the duly designated statewide P&A for individuals with disabilities in the State \nof Arkansas,  DRC  has  the  authority  to  pursue  legal,  administrative  and  other  appropriate \nremedies to ensure the protection of and advocacy for the rights of individuals with disabilities \nwithin the State. 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(3). \n9.  DRC is authorized, for instance, to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect of \nindividuals with disabilities such as the deaths that occurred at the Defendant's facilities if the \nincidents are reported to DRC or if there is probable cause to believe the individual has been \nsubject to abuse and neglect. 29 U.S.C. § 794e(f)(2) (PAIR); 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(B) (DDA). \n2 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 3 of 47\n10.  DRC is authorized to have access to all records of an individual with a disability \nif that individual is unable to authorize the DRC to have such access, if the individual does not \nhave a legal guardian, and if a complaint has been received by the system about the individual \nwith regard to the status or treatment of the individual. 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I). \n11.  DRC is authorized to access all records of an individual with disability such as the \nones referenced in this Complaint if that individual is unable to authorize DRC to have such \naccess, if the individual does not have a legal guardian, and, as a result of monitoring or other \nactivities, there is probable cause to believe such an individual has been subject to abuse or \nneglect. 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(i) \n12.  The  authorized  investigation  referred  to  in the  previous  paragraphs  includes \nimmediate access to the entire records of each individual referenced to herein, including any \nrecords received from other health care providers, all facility policies, procedures, and guidelines \nin effect during the individuals treatment at each respective facility owned and operated by the \nDefendant, including those in effect at the time of patients' deaths. 42 U.S.C. § 15043(c) \nB. The Defendant \n13.  The Defendant, Baptist Health, is a non-profit healthcare corporation organized \nand existing under the laws of the State of Arkansas with its principal place of business in the \njudicial district of this Court. \n14.  The Defendant owns and operates the three (3) facilities where the deaths \noccurred, namely: \n(1)  Baptist Health Rehabilitation Institute located at 9601 Interstate 630, Exit \n7, Little Rock, Arkansas, 72205; \n(2)  Baptist Health Medical Center located at 3333 Springhill Drive, North \nLittle Rock, Arkansas 72117; and \n3 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 4 of 47\n(3)  Baptist Medical Center located at 9601 Interstate 630, Exit 7, Little Rock, \nArkansas 72205. \n15.  The  Defendant  has  at  all  times  relevant  exercised  general  responsibility, \nsupervision and oversight of promulgation and implementation of the policies and practices of \neach above facility,  as well as the provision and coordination of all programs, treatment and \nservices offered to the individuals referenced herein. \nFACTS \n16.  In  accordance with 42  CFR  § 482.13( t)(7),  health care facilities  that receive \nfederal funding, like the Defendant, are required to report restraint related deaths to the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(CMS). In tum, CMS is required to report restraint related deaths to the P&A in the state in \nwhich the death occurred. \n17.  On October 23, 2012, DRC received notification from the CMS that a \"restraint \nassociated  death\"  had  occurred  at  the  Baptist  Rehabilitation  Institute  on  October  7,  2012. \nAccording to CMS, the type of restraint used on the deceased patient was an \"enclosed bed.\" The \nCMS  report did not disclose the identity of the patient to  DRC,  but indicated the patient's \ndiagnosis was subdural hematomas. See a true and correct copy of the notification to DRC at \nExhibit \"A.\" \n18.  On November 5, 2012, DRC received notification from the CMS that a \"restraint \nassociated death\" had occurred at Baptist Health Center-North Little Rock on October 29, 2012. \nAccording to the CMS report the type of restraint used on the deceased patient was an \"enclosed \nbed.\" The CMS report did not disclose the identity of the patient to DRC, but indicated the \npatient's diagnosis was pneumonia. See a true and correct copy of the notification to DRC at \nExhibit \"B.\" \n4 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 5 of 47\n19.  On November 5, 2012, DRC received notification from the CMS that a \"restraint \nassociated death\" had occurred at the Baptist Health Center-Little Rock on October 31, 2012. \nAccording to the CMS report, the type of restraint used on the deceased patient was an \"enclosed \nbed.\" The CMS report did not disclose the identity of the patient to DRC, but indicated the \npatient's diagnosis was chest pain. See a true and correct copy of the notification to DRC at \nExhibit \"C.\" \n20.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that certain enclosed beds, \nlike some manufactured by Vail Products Inc., pose a health risk because patients can become \nentrapped in them and suffocate. Because of the suffocation risk, the FDA has advised hospitals, \nnursing homes and consumers who have a specific Vail enclosed bed system to stop using it and \nmove the patient to an alternate bed.2 Although DRC has not been able to confirm the specific \nenclosed bed the Defendant used on each patient, it appears that at least one of the deceased \npatients was restrained by a Vail or similar enclosed bed. \n21.  After receiving notice that three (3) deaths had occurred within three (3) weeks of \none  another  and  that  all  three  (3)  deaths  involved  an  enclosed bed,  DRC  determined  that \nprobable cause existed that the three deaths may have been caused by abuse and neglect. DRC \nnotified  the  Defendant  through  its  administrator,  Mr.  Greg  Cain,  of the  probable  cause \ndetermination and requested documentation and information related to all three (3) deaths. See a \ntrue  and  correct  copy  of Jonathan  Whipp's  correspondence  to  Defendant's  administrator \nregarding each death collectively at Exhibit \"D.\" \n22.  The Defendant, by and through its legal counsel, initially informed DRC during a \nphone  call  that  the  Defendant  would  comply  with  DRC's written  request.  The  Defendant, \nhowever, requested several additional weeks to gather the documents because the holidays were \n2 See http://www. fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/ AlertsandNo tices/PublicHealthNo tifications/ucm062025 .htm \n5 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 6 of 47\napproaching. \n23.  After informing Defendant's counsel that a short extension would be given, but \nnot the length of time requested by the Defendant, Defendant's counsel informed DRC that her \nclient  would  not  comply  with  the  request  after  all  because  \"none  of the  individuals  had \ndisabilities\" and therefore, DRC did not have authority to review the requested materials. \n24.  After receiving this denial, DRC informed Defendant's counsel in writing that \nDRC would conduct an on-site review of the records at each facility. DRC provided counsel with \nDRC's authority to do so and provided counsel with the dates and times for the review. \n25.  Defendant's counsel met DRC's representative at each facility at the scheduled \ndate and time, but Defendant's counsel refused DRC's representative requests to  review the \nrecords and refused her requests to  examine the \"enclosed bed\" associated with each death. \nDuring  each  visit,  DRC  representative  provided  Defendant's  counsel  with  documentation \nconcerning DRC's authority and relevant documentation supporting DRC's authorized access to \nthe requested records.  See a true and correct copy of the documentation provided by DRC's \nrepresentative Dee Blakley collectively at Exhibit \"E.\" \n26.  After  DRC's  attempt  to  conduct  an  on-site  review  of the  records  proved \nunsuccessful,  DRC  contacted  Defendant's  counsel  by  phone  again  to  see  if a  reasonable \nagreement could be reached with respect to the records request. Unlike her previous defense, the \nDefendant's counsel argued this time that DRC did not have authority to  access the records \nbecause the Defendant was a private hospital. \n27.  The law regarding DRC's authority to access records from a facility is clear. The \nP&A shall have reasonable unaccompanied access to public and private facilities which provide \nservices,  supports,  and  other  assistance  for  individuals  with  disabilities  in  the  State  when \nnecessary to  conduct  a  full  investigation  of an  incident  of abuse  or  neglect  under  section \n6 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 7 of 47\n142(a)(2)(B) of the Act. See 29 U.S.C. 794e; 45 CFR § 1386.22(t). [Emphasis Supplied] \n28.  Although the Defendant has refused to  provide any records or documentation \nrelating to the deaths to date, DRC has received some documentation relating to the deaths from \nthe Arkansas Department of Health and CMS. This additional documentation confirmed each \nindividual had one or more disabilities and provided additional evidence that probable cause \nexisted that the individuals were likely subject to abuse and neglect. \nI.  Each patient had a disability. \n29.  For purposes of the PAIR statute, a person is considered to have a \"disability\" if \nhe/she has  a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life \nactivities; has a record of such impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment. 29 \nU.S.C. 705(9)(A-B). Major life activities include caring for one's self, walking, seeing, hearing, \nspeaking, breathing, working, performing manual task, and learning. \n30.  The additional documentation from the Arkansas Department of Health provided \ndocumentation that showed the individual who died at the Baptist Health Medical Center-Little \nRock suffered not only from chest pains, but also suffered from pneumonia, chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease and acute renal failure. See a true and correct copy of documentation from the \nArkansas Department of Health at Exhibit \"F.\" \n31.  The additional documentation from the Arkansas Department of Health provided \ndocumentation that demonstrated the individual who died at the Baptist Medical Center-North \nLittle Rock suffered from pneumonia, but also suffered from lung cancer. See a true and correct \ncopy of documentation from the Arkansas Department of Health at Exhibit \"G.\" \n32.  The additional documentation from the Arkansas Department of Health provided \ndocumentation that demonstrated the individual who died at the Baptist Rehabilitation Institute \nsuffered from subdural hematomas, but also suffered from hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, iron \n7 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 8 of 47\ndeficiency  anemia  and  benign  prostatic  hypertrophy.  See  a  true  and  correct  copy  of \ndocumentation from the Arkansas Department of Health at Exhibit \"H.\" \n33.  Based on the diagnosis  of each deceased patient,  all  three (3) patients had  a \ndisability as each had a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more \nmajor life activities; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarding as having such an \nimpairment. See 29 U.S.C. § 705 (9)(A-B). \nII.  There is probable cause to believe each individual was subject to abuse and neglect. \n34.  Consent for release of such records to the P&A is not required following the death \nof an individual(s) where, as here, the manner ofthe death provides probable cause to suspect the \npotential for abuse or neglect and any guardianship which existed previously has been terminated \nby virtue of the individual's death. See 42 U.S.C. 15043 and 45 CFR 1386.22(c) (DDA) and 29 \nU.S.C. 794e (PAIR). \n35.  The facts supporting probable cause include, but are not limited to, the following: \n(a) Three (3) restraint related deaths occurred at Defendant's facilities and the \ndeaths occurred within three (3) weeks of one another; \n(b) The Defendant restrained all three (3) patients with an enclosed bed; \n(c) The Baptist Medical Center-Little Rock was investigated by the Arkansas \nDepartment of Health and was cited for deficiencies relating to the facility's \nmonitoring  of patients  who  were  in  enclosed  beds.  As  a  result  of the \nDefendant's deficiencies, the Arkansas Department of Health recommended \na plan of correction to the Defendant; and \n(d)  The enclosed beds pose an unreasonable risk of harm to patients which \nDRC believes may have contributed to the patients' deaths. \n36.  Despite  multiple  correspondence  and  attempts  to  obtain  the  requested \n8 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 9 of 47\ndocumentation in order to avoid litigation, the Defendant continues to refuse DRC access to the \nrecords or the facilities at issue. As a result, DRC cannot fulfill its federal mandate to conduct a \nfull investigation into the abuse and neglect that may have occurred at Defendant's facilities. \n37.  The Defendant's refusal to  comply with DRC's rights to  access the requested \ndocumentation has caused irreparable harm to DRC and will continue to suffer irreparable harm \nunless this Court grants DRC's request for injunctive relief. \n38.  Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794e and 42 U.S.C. § 15043 et. seq., DRC has a right and \nlegal duty to access documents relating to the three (3) restraint related deaths that occurred at \nthe Defendant's facilities. \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff, Disability Rights Center of Arkansas, Inc., prays the Court \nenter an Order granting Plaintiff the following: \n(a)  Immediate access to  all  medical records and documents relating to  the \nthree restraint related deaths identified herein; \n(b)  Immediate access to the three facilities to view the enclosed beds and for \nsuch other purposes as may be necessary to carry out an investigation; \n(c)  Reasonable attorney's fees and related costs for bringing this action; and \n(d)  Any other relief to which the Plaintiff is entitled. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDISABILITY RIGHTS CENTER \nOF ARKANSAS, INC. \n1100 N.

I will clarify below \nseveral statements from your e-mail: \n1.  To clarify our conversation concerning CMS, I told you that I had spoken with several officials from \nCMS with regard to our concerns about disclosing information to your agency.  CMS shared my \nconcerns and asked if I would submit my concerns in writing to the CMS Regional Office so that they \ncould forward my concerns to CMS in Baltimore in hopes that the current process may be clarified. I \nplan to submit my concerns to the CMS Regional Office as soon as possible. \n2.  While you stated that you believe the failure on the part of Baptist Health Rehabilitation Institute to \nprovide the information requested constitutes a violation of Federal law, I do not agree with your \nposition.  I did state that your agency is free to obtain documentation from CMS or from the Arkansas \nDepartment of Health which will demonstrate that none of the patient deaths at issue were a result of the \nuse of restraints. Given the fact that both the Arkansas Department of Health and CMS have found that \nnone of the patient deaths at issue were a result of the use of restraints or that the use of restraints \ncontributed to the patient's death in any way, I do not agree that your agency has \"probable cause to \nbelieve that the health or safety of all patients in all three (3) is in serious and immediate jeopardy.\" \nI will be present at Baptist Health Springhill in the morning at 9 am and at Baptist Health Medical Center Little \nRock at 9 am on Monday. \nLynda M.

Johnson \nCc: Paul Davidson; Jonathan Whipps \nSubject: Follow-up to our meeting of this morning \nThanks for taking the time to meet with us. \nI wanted to summarize our meeting of today. \nI brought print copies of federal regulations defining DRC's access authority to you, pursuant to our federal \ngrants under the Protection and Advocacy system for Developmental Disability; Protection and Advocacy \nsystem for Individuals with Mental Illness; and Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights.  I also provided \nyou with a print copy of the FAQ from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office for \nCivil Rights (which enforces HIPAA) related to HIPAA and disclosures to Protection and Advocacy systems \n(P&As).  (See http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/fag/disclosures  required  by  law/909.html) \nIn response to my question about your conversation with CMS yesterday, it is my understand that you are \nexpecting correspondence from CMS clarifying when a covered entity must disclose PHI to a P&A \n(notwithstanding the seven (7) year old guidance posted on HHS' website). \nYou stated that DRC could obtain investigation reports on these deaths from the Arkansas Department of \nHealth, and from CMS, both of whom have conducted investigations and found that the deaths were \nunrelated to the enclosed bed.  I stated that failure of the three hospitals in the Baptist Health System to \ncooperate with DRC requests for access to information and documents previously requested was a violation of \nfederal law.  I also informed you that the three (3) deaths within the same hospital system, within three (3) \nweeks of each other with the manner of restraint described to DRC by CMS as \"enclosed bed\" gives us \nprobable cause to believe that the health or safety of all patients in all three (3) is in serious and immediate \njeopardy. \nWe disagreed that one or more of the decedents were people with disabilities. \nYour stated position was that none of the three (3) hospitals would provide DRC with access to the previously \nrequested information. \nI stated that I would be at Baptist Springhill tomorrow morning at 9 a.m., and Baptist Medical Center on \nMonday at 9 a.m.  You stated that you would be there also, and in response to my question, you said that I \nshould come to the administrative office of each hospital. \nI stated that unless your position changed overnight, the next two meetings would be for the purpose of \nhaving our access denied at each hospital, and these meetings were for the purpose of making a record. \nI will bring you one of my business cards tomorrow when we meet at Baptist Springhill. \nI look forward to seeing you. \nDee Blakley \nDisability Rights Center of Arkansas, Inc. \n2 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 21 of 47\nThe information contained in this message is confidential and is intended for the addressee only.

We were informed of the death in an enclosed bed by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). \nYou said your position to deny access had not changed. \nYou also stated that your position was that DRC did not have jurisdiction to request records or conduct an investigation. \nYou stated that the decedent was not a person with a disability, and that investigations conducted by the Arkansas \nDepartment of Health (ADH) and CMS had determined that the death was not related to the use of the enclosed bed. \nYou stated further that DRC could obtain those investigations from ADH and CMS. \nI stated that our position for the record was that DRC's statutory and regulatory access authority to documents and \ninformation generated by and in the custody of your client was not predicated on the existence of documents created \nby another entity. Nor was our access authority predicated on any finding by those entities or your client that the death \nwas unrelated to the use of the enclosed bed.  I said otherwise, a provider could simply deny DRC access by saying an \nallegation was unfounded, and further, that you would not be able to find regulations or case law which would support \nthat position. \nYou asked if I intended to be at Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock on Monday, November 19, 2012.  I said yes. \nYou said you would also be there. \nI look forward to meeting with you at 9 a.m. on Monday. \nDee Blakley \nDisability Rights Center of Arkansas, Inc. \nThe information contained in this message is confidential and is intended for the addressee only.

See CMS 2567 \nSECTION 13.E. \nBased on review of policy and procedures, interview and clinical record review, it was \ndetermined the facility failed to ensure five (#1, #2, #3, #4 and #10) of 10 (#1-#10) patients in \nrestraints were monitored every two hours according to facility policy. The failed practice \ncreated the potential for patient injury or death and did not allow the patient to be assessed and \nreleased from restraints as early as safely possible and could affect any patient in restraints. See \nCMS 2567 \nThe above  shall be corrected at the earliest possible date in order to provide maximum care \nand/or safety to the patients in your facility.  Your response on the above should be forwarded to \nthis office within ten calendar days of receipt of this correspondence. Such comments should \ninclude any corrective action, taken or proposed, the person responsible for correction and the \ndate of correction. \nIfw  e may be of assistance at any time, please call (501) 661-2201. \nEXHIBIT \nI  61 \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 34 of 47\nBaptist Health Medical Center \nNorth Little Rock \nPage2 \nSincerely, \n.··tv-\\ \noug Go  on, Program Manager \nHealth Facility Services \nArkansas Department ofHealth \n\nCase 4:13-cv-00103-JLH   Document 1   Filed 03/01/13   Page 35 of 47\nCOMPLAINT INVESTIGATION \nDATE:  November 15,2012 \nRE:  Provider#: 040036 \nBaptist Health Medical Center \n3333 Springhill Drive \nNorth Little Rock, AR 72117 \nAdministrator: Harrison Dean \nTelephone#: (501) 202-3000 \nSUBJECT:  State Agency Control# 13-021 \nThe complaint was investigated on November 13,2012.
