    "summary": "<p>On February 2, 2021, an eleven-year-old child with a disability filed suit through his parents, alleging that school police officers used excessive force and discriminated against him based on his disability and race when they violently handcuffed him multiple times while at school. The plaintiff also alleged that Defendants&rsquo; actions, inactions, policies, practices, customs, and procedures violated and continue to violate his rights under the U.S. and California Constitutions, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and multiple state civil rights laws, in addition to several common law torts. The plaintiff was represented by Disability Rights California, Barajas &amp; Rivera APC, and Disability Rights Education &amp; Defense Fund. The defendants included the District Superintendent, Riverside County, the Riverside County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, and Riverside County Sheriff and several individual officers. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Kenly Kiya Kato and later reassigned to District Judge Jesus Gilberto Bernal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, 2021, the court granted and denied in part defendant&rsquo;s Motions to Dismiss and permitted the case to proceed. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on March 25, 2022. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs substituted specific named defendants, added Plaintiff&rsquo;s newly diagnosed conditions, clarified Defendant&rsquo;s liability, removed claims related to particular state civil rights laws, and removed claims against the District and Superintendent for race and disability discrimination, IIED, false imprisonment, battery, assault, and negligent supervision.</p>\r\n<p>On September 14, 2023, the parties filed a joint notice of conditional settlement between Plaintiff and Defendants County of Riverside, Riverside County Sheriff's Department, and Deputy Sheriffs. This private settlement was proposed by a mediator, and we could not find the specific provisions or details of the agreement.</p>\r\n<p>After many months of pretrial discovery, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment as to the ADA and Section 504 claims against the School District and Superintendent on September 1, 2023. Judge Bernal granted partial summary judgment on October 13, 2023. The court determined that that Defendants&rsquo; methods of administration amount to a violation of students with disabilities&rsquo; right to meaningful access under the ADA and Section 504. In granting summary judgment, the Court ordered that the parties design a remedy to bring the School District into compliance.</p>\r\n<p>Then, on November 14, 2023, the parties filed a notice of settlement between the Plaintiff and the School District, Superintendent, and named Deputy Sheriffs. The notice stated that the parties had reached a settlement of all of Plaintiff's monetary damages claims. Two days later, as a result of the tentative settlement, Judge Bernal placed the action in inactive status and ordered that the Court retained full jurisdiction over the action. The Court ordered that the parties must file either stipulation and order for dismissal or a motion to reopen the case if settlement had not been finalized by March 25, 2024.</p>\r\n<p>On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case because the. parties were unable to finalize an agreement within the time period ordered by the Court. In response to the motion, Judge Bernal granted the parties an additional 120 days to reach a settlement agreement. In May 2024, Plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce compliance with the Court Order and alleged that the School District was nonresponsive to Plaintiff's attempts to meet and finalize a stipulated remedy.</p>\r\n<p>Before the Court ruled on the motion, the parties jointly stipulated injunctive and declaratory relief on June 18, 2024. The Court granted the injunctive and declaratory relief. The Order required that the School District bring methods of administering its police program into compliance with the ADA and Section 504 by implementing new policies, developing or modifying trainings, requiring and providing training to school officers to ensure compliance, and document monitor rates of use of removal, restraints, and referrals on students with disabilities.</p>\r\n<p>In August 2024, the parties filed a motion for the court to approve a compromise between the Plaintiff and the County of Riverside, Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, and named Deputy Sheriffs. The Court approved the compromise on September 5, 2024. This order provided that the County would pay Plaintiff a gross sum of $650,000.00 in full settlement and compromise of any and all claims, as well as attorneys' fees of $260,000 and costs of $57,835.55. The agreement did not include any provisions for injunctive or declaratory relief. The Court dismissed with prejudice the action against the Defendants County, Sheriffs Department, and Deputy Sheriffs on March 4, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>Also in August 2024, the parties filed a motion for the court to approve a compromise between the Plaintiff and the School District, Superintendent. On November 25, 2024, the Court granted the motion for court approval and ordered that the School District pay Plaintiff a gross sum of $1,200,000.00 in full settlement and compromise of any and all monetary damage claims. Plaintiffs filed a motion for attorneys&rsquo; fees against the School District and Superintendent on March 20, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>As of March 25, 2025, determination of attorneys fees owed to Plaintiff by the School District and Superintendent is ongoing. All other matters for this case have been dismissed or otherwise determined by a final order.</p>",

Plaintiff C.B., a minor, by and through his guardians ad litem W.B. \n3  and B.T. (“Plaintiff” or “C.B.”), brings this action for injunctive relief and \n4  damages against the Moreno Valley Unified School District (“District” or “Moreno \n5  Valley USD”), District Superintendent Martinrex Kedziora, the County of \n6  Riverside (“County”), the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department (“Sheriff’s \n7  Department”), Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, and various individuals for \n8  harms resulting from at least four violent handcuffings at his middle school \n9  campuses. C.B. alleges that Defendants’ actions, inactions, policies, practices, \n10  customs and procedures violated and continue to violate his rights under the U.S. \n11  Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et \n12  seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794 et \n13  seq., state civil rights laws, and common law torts.  \n14  2.  C.B. further alleges that the District, Sheriff’s Department, and \n15  County partner to operate a discipline system that discriminates against students \n16  with disabilities and Black students, including Black disabled students. The \n17  District employs its own Campus Security Officers (CSOs) and contracts with the \n18  Sheriff’s Department to provide School Resource Officers (SROs) at District \n19  schools. The District calls on CSOs and SROs (together, “school police officers”) \n20  to respond with physical force to minor and/or disability-related behaviors that \n21  could be managed by teachers or administrators with less harmful methods, such as \n22  crisis intervention, de-escalation, patience, communication, and waiting.  \n23  3.  C.B. is a Black student with disabilities residing within the boundary \n24  of the District. School police officers tackled and handcuffed C.B. in response to \n25  his disability-related behaviors at least four separate times over a less than four-\n26  month span in 2019. At the time of the handcuffings, C.B. was between ten and \n27  eleven years old, stood about four feet, eight inches, and weighed about seventy \n28  pounds. In at least one incident the school police officers simultaneously shackled \n \n3 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 4 of 76   Page ID #:4\n \n \n1  his wrists and ankles. \n2  4.  School police officer body camera footage captured part of the third \n3  mechanical restraint, which occurred on October 8, 2019. The officers entered \n4  C.B.’s special education classroom to investigate an allegation that he threw a rock \n5  the day before. C.B. sat with his head down on his desk while the school police \n6  officers questioned him. Within ninety seconds of their arrival, the officers \n7  physically pulled C.B. from his desk by his arms and shoulders, pushed him with \n8  force to the ground, and handcuffed him. One officer pinned his knee in C.B.’s \n9  back while another officer placed him in handcuffs.   \n10  5.  As a result of Defendants’ unnecessary and excessive physical and \n11  mechanical restraints, C.B. has suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional \n12  distress, mental anguish, pain, humiliation, and exacerbation of his disabilities. His \n13  parents have secured therapy services to help him cope with the trauma caused by \n14  these incidents.  \n15  6.  On information and belief, Defendants were and are on notice that \n16  interactions with school police officers trigger and exacerbate C.B.’s disabilities \n17  and cause emotional distress. Nevertheless, the District continues to request and \n18  direct school police officers to respond to C.B.’s minor and/or disability-related \n19  behaviors, unnecessarily escalating matters. By way of example, in a meeting with \n20  C.B.’s parents, Defendant District stated that it could not implement a policy at all \n21  times of exhausting less intrusive methods before calling officers. Further, school \n22  police officers responded and continue to respond with excessive physical force \n23  during each interaction with C.B.  \n24  7.  On information and belief, and as evidenced by the at least four \n25  handcuffings of C.B., the District fails to sufficiently train its teachers, \n26  administrators, and other non-school police officer staff on using alternatives to \n27  law enforcement to respond to minor and/or disability-related behaviors. The \n28  District’s law enforcement referral data demonstrates its excessive and \n \n4 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 5 of 76   Page ID #:5\n \n \n1  disproportionate reliance on school police officers. The District refers students to \n2  law enforcement at a significantly higher rate than comparable districts in the state. \n3  Moreover, while Black students make up about 14% of total District enrollment, \n4  they are nearly 30% of District referrals to law enforcement. The District’s rate of \n5  referring Black students to law enforcement is more than 2.5 times its rate of \n6  referring non-Black students to law enforcement.    \n7  8.  The injuries suffered by C.B. at the hands of SROs were also the \n8  product of Defendant Sheriff’s Department’s and County’s handcuffing policies \n9  and practices and failures to train and supervise its staff. The pattern of unlawful or \n10  excessive restraint and handcuffing in response to C.B.’s minor and/or disability-\n11  related behavior constitutes deliberate indifference to his constitutional rights.  \n12  9.  Defendants have practices, policies, and/or customs of willful failure \n13  to adequately report, document, investigate, and/or respond to, complaints of \n14  unnecessary mechanical and other physical restraints of students, which has caused \n15  C.B. to suffer constitutional injuries as a result, and has compounded the harms \n16  suffered by C.B. By way of example, Defendants have failed to provide any \n17  meaningful information regarding what transpired in the four incidents, despite \n18  C.B.’s parents’ repeated requests. Defendants have abdicated their responsibility to \n19  train, supervise, and discipline their employees by failing to adequately report, \n20  document, investigate and/or respond to complaints of unlawful or excessive force. \n21  10.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages and injunctive and declaratory relief \n22  for ongoing violations of his rights, including an order that Defendants cease the \n23  involvement of school police officers in low-level student misbehaviors and \n24  instead provide C.B. and similarly situated students with reasonable modifications \n25  and positive supports and services. \n26  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n27  11.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s federal claims pursuant to \n28  28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. The same actions and omissions that form the basis \n \n5 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 6 of 76   Page ID #:6\n \n \n1  of Plaintiff’s federal claims, form the basis of his California state law claims. Thus, \n2  this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims under 28 \n3  U.S.C. § 1367. Declaratory relief is available pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and \n4  Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Injunctive relief is authorized by \n5  28 U.S.C. § 2202 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n6  12.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California, Eastern Division, \n7  because Plaintiff resides in, and Defendants operate and perform official duties in, \n8  Riverside County. A substantial part of the events, acts, and omissions giving rise \n9  to the claims also occurred in Riverside County. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n10  PARTIES \n11  A. Plaintiff \n12  13.  Plaintiff C.B. is a Black, twelve-year-old boy with disabilities in the \n13  seventh grade. At the time of the events described herein, C.B. was between ten \n14  and eleven years old, approximately seventy pounds, and in the sixth grade. He \n15  appears by and through his parents and guardians ad litem W.B. and B.T.  \n16  14.  Presently, and at all times relevant to this action, C.B. was and is a \n17  qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of all applicable statutes \n18  including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504, and California \n19  Government Code § 12926. C.B. has diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \n20  Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), disabilities that \n21  make it difficult for him to regulate his emotions, maintain focus, communicate, \n22  and comply promptly with directions. C.B., at all times relevant to this action, \n23  received special education services.1 C.B.’s parents suspect that he may have \n24  additional undiagnosed emotional and behavioral disabilities, some of which \n25  resulted from or were exacerbated by his interactions with law enforcement. \n26 \n                                           \n27  1 Through this complaint, C.B. does not challenge the adequacy of his Individualized Education Program (IEP) \nor allege Defendants violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). All references to his IEP, \nIEP team meetings, or special education classroom herein are for background purposes, e.g., to support his \n28 \nstatus as a qualified individual with disabilities, establish Defendants’ knowledge of his disabilities, and provide \nevidence that Defendants discriminated against him by handcuffing him for disability-related behaviors. \n \n6 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 7 of 76   Page ID #:7\n \n \n1  15.

Plaintiff complied with the California Government Claims Act (also \n17  known as the Tort Claims Act), California Government Code § 900 et seq. On July \n18  15, 2020, Plaintiff filed an administrative tort claim pursuant to California \n19  Government Code § 910 et seq. with Defendants Moreno Valley USD, County, \n20  Sheriff’s Department, Sheriff Chad Bianco, Superintendent Kedziora, Director \n21  Scott, Principal Walker, CSO Arellano, CSO Owens, and Deputy Loza, notifying \n22  Defendants of claims that are now set forth herein.3 Plaintiff’s claim stated that the \n23  claim was timely as to all events, but also included an application for leave to file a \n24  late claim, to the extent any such claims were required. \n25  40.  On August 10, 2020, Defendant Moreno Valley USD rejected \n26  Plaintiff’s claim by way of letter. Similarly, on August 6, 2020, Defendant County \n27 \n                                           \n28 \n3 A true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s tort claim is incorporated by reference as Plaintiff’s Exhibit 1, and will be \nfiled separately under seal with this Court. \n \n11 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 12 of 76   Page ID #:12\n \n \n1  rejected Plaintiff’s claim by way of letter. On November 13, 2020, Plaintiff sought \n2  clarification of these Defendants’ purported rejection of Plaintiff’s application to \n3  present a late claim. Defendant Moreno Valley USD did not respond to Plaintiff’s \n4  request for clarification.  \n5  41.  On November 25, 2020, the County provided written letter directing \n6  Plaintiff to file a late claim petition pursuant to California Government Code § \n7  946.6. Petitioner filed that petition in Riverside County Superior Court on \n8  February 2, 2021, naming the District, County, and Sheriff’s Department.  \n9  42.  Defendant Sheriff’s Department failed to reply to Plaintiff’s claim \n10  and, by operation of law, Plaintiff’s claim was rejected on August 29, 2020. On \n11  November 13, 2020, Plaintiff sought clarification of Defendant Sheriff’s \n12  Department’s purported rejection of Plaintiff’s application to present a late claim. \n13  Defendant Sheriff’s Department did not respond to Plaintiff’s request for \n14  clarification. \n15  43.  Plaintiff has thus complied with the requirements of Government \n16  Code Section 910, et seq. \n17  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n18  A. Racial and Disability Disparities in School Policing and Restraint \n19  Increased Police Presence in America’s Schools \n20  44.  In recent decades, school districts have drastically expanded school \n21  police programs.4 Instead of addressing student behaviors by providing positive \n22  supports or through administrative discipline, school administrators now call the \n23  police.5 The addition of police officers in schools has not made schools safer and \n24  instead has increased the criminalization of minor and/or disability-related \n25 \n                                           \n26 \n4 In 1975, just 1% of schools placed police officers on campus, as compared to nearly half of schools today. This \n27  expansion was primarily driven by readily available federal funding for SRO programs, rather than an actual \nneed for increased police presence. See, e.g., Amir Whitaker, et al., AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, COPS \n28  AND NO COUNSELORS: HOW THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH STAFF IS HARMING STUDENTS (2019), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/030419-acluschooldisciplinereport.pdf.   \n5 Id. \n \n12 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 13 of 76   Page ID #:13\n \n \n1  behaviors.6  \n2  45.  As school districts have expanded school police programs, they have \n3  failed to fund behavioral and mental health supports. For instance, around fourteen \n4  million students in the United States attend schools patrolled by police but entirely \n5  lacking in counselors, nurses, psychologists, or social workers.7 \n6  46.  Increased police presence in schools has had a disproportionate \n7  impact on students with disabilities and Black students. According to the U.S. \n8  Department of Education’s 2015-16 Civil Rights Data Collection Survey,8 students \n9  with disabilities represent just 12% of the student population nationally but 28% of \n10  all students referred to law enforcement9 or arrested at school. Black students make \n11  up 15% of student enrollment nationally but 31% of students referred to law \n12  enforcement or arrested at school.  \n13  47.  These disparities are also present in the national data on mechanical \n14  restraints,10 the category capturing handcuffings. According to the 2017-18 Civil \n15  Rights Data Collection survey,11 students with disabilities again make up about \n16  12% of the student population nationally but 41% of all students subjected to \n17  mechanical restraints. Black students represent 18% of all students with disabilities \n18  nationally, but 34% of those put in mechanical restraints. \n19  48.  Police presence and contact have grave, lifelong consequences for \n20  students. Multiple studies demonstrate that police contact causes and exacerbates \n21                                             \n6 Id.; see also Emily K. Weisburst, Patrolling Public Schools: The Impact of Funding for School Police on \n22  Student Discipline and Long-Term Education Outcomes, 38 J. OF POLICY ANALYSIS & MANAGEMENT 338 \n(2019) (finding that federal grants placing police on school campuses increased sanctions for low-level offenses, \n23  particularly for Black students, and decreased high school graduation rates). \n7 Whitaker, supra note 4. \n24  8 U.S. Dept. of Educ., 2015-16 Civil Rights Data Collection: School Climate and Safety (May 2019), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/school-climate-and-safety.pdf.   \n25  9 The Civil Rights Data Collection defines law enforcement referral as “[A]ction[s] by which a student is \nreported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on \n26  school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether \nofficial action is taken.” See id. at p. 3. \n27  10 The Civil Rights Data Collection uses the same definition of “mechanical restraint” as California state law: \n“The use of a device or equipment to restrict a pupil’s freedom of movement.” Cal.

Code § 49005.1(d)(1). \n11 U.S. Dept. of Educ., 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection: The Use of Restraint and Seclusion on Children \n28 \nwith Disabilities in K-12 Schools (Oct. 2020), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/restraint-and-\nseclusion.pdf.  \n \n13 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 14 of 76   Page ID #:14\n \n \n1  mental health disabilities, especially trauma and anxiety.12 Youth are particularly \n2  vulnerable to heightened emotional distress when they experience intrusive police \n3  stops.13 Districts that are overpoliced and under-resourced thus subject their \n4  students to traumatic police contact, while simultaneously leaving them without \n5  mental health resources to process these events.  \n6  49.  Police contact causes even greater harm when accompanied by \n7  physical force. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) has \n8  explained that even if no physical injury is sustained, children who are restrained \n9  can be severely traumatized as a result.14 Students are too anxious, frightened, or \n10  angry to focus on and fully participate in classroom activities. When an individual \n11  is exposed to trauma, especially in the form of repeated traumatic stress of an \n12  extreme traumatic event, the brain becomes over-sensitized to any potential \n13  stimulus that might cue a threat. The individual thus perceives ordinary encounters \n14  as threatening ones, triggering a “fight or flight” or dissociative response.15 \n15  50.  Dissociative responses impair a student’s attention, organization, \n16  comprehension, memory, and trust, all necessary for the acquisition of academic \n17  skills. Thus, childhood trauma is linked to poor academic outcomes, including \n18  failure to reach proficiency in core subjects and/or to graduate from high school. \n19  Exposure to trauma causes challenges with emotional self-regulation – including \n20  aggression, disproportionate reactivity, impulsivity, distractibility, or withdrawal \n21  and avoidance – that disrupt the learning environment and frequently lead to \n22 \n                                           \n23  12 See, e.g., Amanda Geller et al., Aggressive Policing and the Mental Health of Young Urban Men, 104 AM. J. \nPUBLIC HEALTH 2321 (2014) (studying young men’s experiences of police encounters and finding that men who \n24  reported more police contact also reported more trauma and anxiety symptoms, indicating a need for less invasive \ntactics); Dylan B. Jackson et al., Police Stops Among At-Risk Youth: Repercussions for Mental Health, 65 J. \n25  ADOLESCENT HEALTH 627 (2019) (finding that youth who were stopped more often by police officers were more \nlikely to report emotional trauma).  \n26  13 Jackson et al., supra note 12.  \n14 See U.S. Gov’t Accountability Office, GAO-09-719T, Testimony before the Committee on Education and \n27  Labor, House of Representatives: Seclusions and Restraints, Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and \nPrivate Schools and Treatment Centers p.1, 8 (May 19, 2009), https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-719T.   \n15 Perry et al., Childhood Trauma, The Neurobiology of Adaptation, and “Use-dependent” Development of the \n28 \nBrain: How “States” Become “Traits” 16 INFANT MENT.

Thus, police \n2  presence, contact, and use of force are not only traumatizing, but also counter-\n3  productive to creating a safe school environment that is conducive to learning. \n4  California’s Movement Away from School Policing \n5  51.  School districts and other programs for children and youth throughout \n6  California have begun to incorporate behavioral supports, trauma-informed \n7  approaches, Restorative Justice practices, access to mental health services, and \n8  other positive strategies to focus on addressing the root causes of student behaviors \n9  and minimizing involvement with the juvenile justice system.  \n10  52.  Schools in California are reviewing and addressing racial and \n11  disability disparities in discipline to ensure students of color and students with \n12  disabilities, including disabled students of color, like C.B., are not \n13  disproportionately subject to police referrals and restraints as compared with their \n14  similarly situated peers. For these reasons, several large school districts, including \n15  Oakland Unified School District and Sacramento City Unified School District, \n16  have abolished their SRO programs completely.16 \n17  53.  Moreno Valley USD is not one of these districts. Following the \n18  murder of George Floyd, a coalition of Riverside County community groups \n19  organized to abolish the District’s SRO program. On July 23, 2020, the District’s \n20  Board conducted a “Study Session” to gather community input regarding the SRO \n21  program. During this Session, the Board received almost fifty public comments, \n22  with nearly all speakers urging the Board to abolish the SRO program and reinvest \n23  its $1.3 million-dollar budget in mental health supports, Restorative Justice, \n24  culturally relevant curricula, and other non-police programming. Many speakers \n25  specifically cited the officers’ abuse of C.B. as reason to make these changes. The \n26  Board, however, did not abolish the SRO program.    \n27 \n                                           \n16 Nicole Karlis, Oakland is at the Forefront of a National Movement to Abolish Police from K-12 Schools, \n28 \nSALON (June 30, 2020, 11:52 PM), https://www.salon.com/2020/06/30/oakland-is-at-the-forefront-of-a-national-\nmovement-to-ban-police-from-k-12-schools/.  \n \n15 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 16 of 76   Page ID #:16\n \n \n1  B.

According to the District’s position description,17 a CSO, under the \n9  general direction of the Director of Safety and Security, “supervises, monitors, and \n10  controls” school campuses and “enforces the rules and regulations governing \n11  student behavior.” Expected duties include “physically restrain[ing] persons \n12  involved in crimes, rights, or other acts of violence.” The position also requires \n13  CSOs to receive ongoing trainings on the use of pepper spray and tasers, \n14  suggesting that the District considers use of force to be essential to the CSOs’ role. \n15  57.  The CSOs wear police-style uniforms and are issued metal handcuffs. \n16  On information and belief, CSOs also carry pepper spray and tasers. \n17  58.  On information and belief, the District’s CSO Program has no written \n18  policies and/or procedures. CSOs instead take verbal orders from Director Scott. \n19  59.  State law governs the use of restraint, including mechanical restraint, \n20  in schools. Cal. Educ. Code § 49005 et seq. Staff may only use restraint in an \n21  emergency and not for the purpose of coercion, discipline, convenience, or \n22  retaliation. Cal. Educ. Code § 49005.2. They may not place a pupil in a facedown \n23  position with the pupil’s hands held or restrained behind the pupil’s back. Cal. \n24  Educ. Code § 49005.8(a)(5).  \n25  60.  District policy implementing these state laws prohibits its staff, \n26  including CSOs, from using restraints that employ a device, material, or objects \n27 \n                                           \n28 \n17 Moreno Valley USD Human Resources Division, Position Title: Campus Security Officer I (Oct. 17, 2017), \nhttps://4.files.edl.io/af25/09/04/18/173822-651104c9-971a-47b6-ba39-362fd1900e5b.pdf.  \n \n16 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 17 of 76   Page ID #:17\n \n \n1  that simultaneously immobilize all four extremities.18 The same District policy \n2  only allows its staff, including CSOs, to use restraint if they have received a \n3  certification in Crisis Prevention Intervention (CPI).  \n4  C. The District’s School Resource Officer Program \n5  Relationship Between the District and Sheriff’s Department \n6  61.  The District maintains an SRO program through a “Law Enforcement \n7  Services Agreement” with the Sheriff's Department and/or County. The agreement, \n8  effective July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2021, specifies that the Sheriff’s Department \n9  will provide nine SROs to the District, three of whom serve the middle school \n10  campuses and six of whom serve the high school campuses. The total cost of the \n11  three-year contract is $4.3 million, which includes the full cost of the SROs’ \n12  salaries. On information and belief, the District funds the Agreement almost \n13  entirely through Local Control Funding Formula Supplemental and Concentration \n14  Funds.  \n15  62.  On information and belief, the SROs are employees of the Sheriff’s \n16  Department and/or County of Riverside.  \n17  63.  According to the contract, the SROs are sworn law enforcement \n18  officers whose duties include patrolling and investigating crimes on Moreno \n19  Valley USD campuses, facilitating conversations between students and their \n20  parents, and serving as a liaison at elementary school sites. \n21  Department Policies Governing Body Camera Footage \n22  64.  Under a 2016 directive, the Sheriff’s Department requires its officers \n23  to create body camera recordings of “any law enforcement action where there is \n24  reason to believe it would be appropriate and valuable to record the event.” This \n25  includes citizen contacts and detentions.  \n26  65.  If an officer fails to initiate the recording of an event when required, \n27 \n                                           \n28 \n18 Moreno Valley USD, MVUSD SELPA Handbook at p. 6-4 (Aug. 26, 2020), \nhttps://4.files.edl.io/460c/08/26/20/224843-47f1cf94-84cd-47e4-8a31-5c07ab6ef4b2.pdf.   \n \n17 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 18 of 76   Page ID #:18\n \n \n1  the officer must document the reasons for the failure in a subsequent report or \n2  memorandum. Further, officers may not terminate the body camera recording until \n3  the conclusion of the encounter, “unless tactical or practical reasons dictate \n4  otherwise.” Even then, the officer must reinitiate the recording as soon as possible \n5  and document the reasons for early termination in a report.  \n6  Sheriff’s Department Policies on Restraint and Handcuffing \n7  66.  The Sheriff’s Department Standards Manual (“Manual”) sets out the \n8  standards for when officers may handcuff youth. Policy 306.2.3 directs officers not \n9  to handcuff youth under age fourteen “unless he/she is suspected of a dangerous \n10  felony or when the deputy has a reasonable suspicion that the juvenile may resist, \n11  attempt escape, injure him/herself, injure the deputy, or damage property.”  \n12  67.  Policy 324.9 further specifies that officers may not handcuff status \n13  offenders or children age eleven or younger unless they are “combative or \n14  threatening.” The Policy does not guide officers as to how to decide whether a \n15  child meets the standard of being “combative or threatening.” This standard is \n16  susceptible to implicit and explicit racial biases, since officers are more likely to \n17  view ambiguous or disability-related behavior as “combative and threatening” \n18  when shown by Black students rather than white students.19 \n19  68.  The Manual does not require, or even encourage, officers to use crisis \n20  communication or other non-violent alternatives to restraint, particularly for \n21  students with disabilities. \n22  D. Facts Regarding Plaintiff C.B. \n23  69.  C.B. is a student of Defendant Moreno Valley USD and is in the \n24  seventh grade at Mountain View Middle School. C.B. has been on a remote \n25  learning model for school since on or about March 16, 2020, due to the Covid-19 \n26 \n                                           \n27  19 See Kurt Hugenberg & Galen V.

At the time of the incidents described herein, C.B. was between ten and \n2  eleven years old and enrolled in the sixth grade.  \n3  70.  C.B. is an engaging and bright twelve-year-old boy who loves playing \n4  basketball, fishing competitively and with his father, playing video games, and \n5  spending time with his family. C.B. is intelligent and enjoys learning, showing \n6  particular aptitude in mathematics. He and his parents hope that he will one day \n7  attend college and pursue a career about which he is passionate. \n8  71.  C.B. has diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder \n9  (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), disabilities that make it \n10  difficult for him to regulate his emotions, maintain focus, communicate, and \n11  comply promptly with directions. C.B.’s parents suspect that he may have \n12  additional undiagnosed emotional and behavioral disabilities, some of which \n13  resulted from or were exacerbated by his interactions with law enforcement.   \n14  72.  C.B. enrolled in the District in May 2019 after attending other school \n15  districts in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties. Staff never handcuffed C.B. in his \n16  prior school districts. Since C.B. enrolled in the District, CSOs and SROs \n17  handcuffed him at least four times in less than four months, as detailed below.  \n18  Mechanical Restraint No. 1: On or about August 21, 2019, school police officers \n19  handcuffed C.B. for conduct resulting from his disabilities. \n20  73.  C.B. had been a student at Landmark Middle School (“Landmark”) \n21  for less than one month, when on or about August 21, 2019, school police officers \n22  handcuffed him.  \n23  74.  That day, then-Landmark Assistant Principal Pedro Gutierrez called \n24  C.B.’s mother, B.T., to tell her to pick him up from school early because he was \n25  “acting up.” On information and belief, C.B. was exhibiting behaviors caused by \n26  his disability.  \n27  75.  When C.B.’s mother arrived at Landmark, Mr. Gutierrez told her that \n28  school police officers had handcuffed C.B. The officers had removed the handcuffs \n \n19 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 20 of 76   Page ID #:20\n \n \n1  before she arrived. Mr. Gutierrez told C.B.’s mother that he instructed officers to \n2  remove the handcuffs because he believed that handcuffing C.B. was “totally \n3  unacceptable,” or words to that effect. Other than this statement, Mr. Gutierrez did \n4  not provide C.B.’s mother with any further information regarding the handcuffing.  \n5  76.  Contrary to District policy, the District did not document the \n6  mechanical restraint in an Incident Report. As a result, Plaintiff cannot state the \n7  names of the school police officers who handcuffed him. He believes this \n8  information is solely in the hands of Defendants.   \n9  77.  On information and belief, the District did not document the incident \n10  or adequately investigate, train, supervise, or discipline the staff involved. \n11  Mechanical Restraint No. 2: On August 26, 2019, school police officers shackled \n12  C.B.’s hands and ankles for conduct resulting from his disabilities. \n13  78.  Five days later, on August 26, 2019, District CSOs handcuffed and \n14  leg-cuffed C.B. at Landmark.  \n15  79.  That day, Mr. Gutierrez directed CSO Demetrius Owens to bring C.B. \n16  to the office for a meeting. CSO Owens’ witness statement does not describe a \n17  reason for this meeting. According to a behavior log drafted by C.B.’s teacher, Mr. \n18  Proprofsky, C.B. had disrupted class earlier in the day by cursing and ripping \n19  paper. Plaintiff suspects that the meeting with Mr. Gutierrez was related to his \n20  alleged disruptive behavior in class – which took place approximately three hours \n21  before Mr. Gutierrez summoned him to his office. Again, these behaviors were \n22  caused by his disabilities.  \n23  80.  CSO Owens, CSO King,20 and then-Landmark Assistant Principal \n24  Kamilah O’Connor found C.B. on the playground. All three directed C.B. to leave \n25  the playground and go to the office. C.B. verbally refused and started to exhibit \n26  conduct related to his disabilities, including an inability to self-regulate or express \n27  himself. He allegedly clenched his fists and began breathing heavily. CSO King \n28 \n                                           \n20 CSO King’s witness statement does not include his/her/their first name. \n \n20 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 21 of 76   Page ID #:21\n \n \n1  and CSO Owens responded by dragging C.B. by his arms to a seclusion room. \n2  81.  Then-Landmark Principal Scott Walker joined CSOs Owens and King \n3  in the seclusion room. Surrounded by three much larger adults in the seclusion \n4  room, C.B. began experiencing and externalizing emotions of fear, anxiety, and \n5  frustration. He began pulling away, pushing, and swinging with his arms in an \n6  attempt to free himself from the room. C.B. was not acting out physically before \n7  the CSOs physically dragged him to the seclusion room. \n8  82.  Principal Walker directed CSO King and CSO Owens to handcuff \n9  C.B. At the time, C.B. was four feet, eight inches tall and approximately seventy \n10  pounds. The CSOs placed C.B. in a physical hold, tackled him to the floor, and \n11  forced him into District-issued metal cuffs. The CSOs pulled C.B. up from the \n12  ground and attempted to sit him in a chair. Now handcuffed in a seclusion room \n13  and surrounded by three adults, C.B. became even more upset and distressed. \n14  Unable to regulate his emotions due to his disabilities, he began flailing his legs.  \n15  83.  Principal Walker then directed CSO King and CSO Owens to place \n16  separate handcuffs on C.B.’s ankles. The CSOs then immediately and \n17  simultaneously shackled C.B.’s hands and ankles with metal cuffs. C.B. remained \n18  shackled in this manner for an unknown period of time.  \n19  84.  The District suspended C.B. from school that day and his aunt came \n20  to pick him up. She was concerned and confused to find C.B. sitting in the fetal \n21  position against the wall of the seclusion room. His aunt observed that C.B.’s arms \n22  were hugging his knees and his head was down. C.B. was not wearing a shirt, \n23  which had come off during the CSOs’ interaction with him. A desk was blocking \n24  the door to the seclusion room. C.B. and his aunt helped school staff clean up the \n25  seclusion room, and then she took him home.  \n26  85.  No District staff told C.B.’s aunt that CSOs had physically tackled \n27  C.B. and then handcuffed and leg-cuffed him. District staff never told C.B.’s \n28  parents of the incident either.   \n \n21 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 22 of 76   Page ID #:22\n \n \n1  86.  Defendants’ actions, inter alia, violated District policies prohibiting \n2  staff from using mechanical restraints that simultaneously immobilize all four \n3  extremities.  \n4  87.  The District also failed to provide an Incident Report to C.B.’s \n5  parents. In November 2019, counsel made a request to the District for a full and \n6  complete copy of C.B.’s educational records. Only after counsel received the \n7  records did C.B.’s parents learn that the CSOs shackled C.B.’s hands and ankles. \n8  The District provided C.B. with CSO King’s and CSO Owens’ witness statements, \n9  which were missing at least two pages. Further, the District did not provide a \n10  witness statement from Principal Walker. The District has not responded to \n11  counsel’s January 2020 follow-up request for the missing pages.  \n12  88.  On information and belief, the District did not document the incident \n13  or adequately investigate, train, supervise, or discipline the staff involved. \n14  Mechanical Restraint No. 3: On October 8, 2019, school police officers tackled \n15  and handcuffed C.B. while pressing a knee into his back \n16  89.  On October 7, 2019, C.B. allegedly threw a rock in the general \n17  direction of CSO Manuel Arellano. No one from the District informed C.B.’s \n18  parents about this incident on the day that it allegedly occurred. According to a \n19  police report dated October 8, 2019, sometime after school hours on October 7, \n20  2019, an unidentified District staff member requested that Deputy Norma Loza  \n21  intervene and “investigate” the alleged rock throwing incident.21 \n22  90.  On October 8, Deputy Loza and CSO Arellano arrived at C.B.’s \n23  special education classroom to investigate the alleged rock-throwing from the day \n24  before. At no time prior to involving the CSOs and SROs did anyone with the \n25  District attempt to arrange a meeting with C.B. with his parents present.  \n26 \n                                           \n27 \n21 On information and belief, the unidentified District staff member is CSO Arellano. The police report states an \nindividual (name redacted) contacted Deputy Loza on October 7, 2019, and alleged that C.B. threw a rock in his \n28 \ndirection earlier that day. Separately, on October 7, 2019, CSO Arellano added a behavior log entry in C.B.’s \npupil file alleging he threw the rock. No one created a log entry documenting the restraints on October 8, 2019. \n \n22 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 23 of 76   Page ID #:23\n \n \n1  91.  Unlike the other incidents where school police officers handcuffed \n2  C.B., Deputy Loza’s body camera partially captured the October 8, 2019, \n3  incident.22 At C.B.’s counsel’s request, the Sheriff’s Department produced a video \n4  that is approximately eight minutes long. On information and belief, Deputy Loza \n5  shut off her body camera before the incident concluded, violating Sheriff’s \n6  Department policy and leaving the remaining hour of the incident unfilmed.  \n7  92.  Based on the review of the available Department footage, immediately \n8  upon entering C.B.’s classroom, Deputy Loza directed the teacher (name unknown) \n9  to remove the other students from the classroom. This left C.B. alone with Deputy \n10  Loza and CSO Arellano. C.B. sat motionless at his desk with his head down.  \n11  93.  Deputy Loza stood over C.B. and said, “You’re going to go to the \n12  office, no matter what. Either you go, cooperating, or I’m going to take you to the \n13  office.” Neither Deputy Loza nor CSO Arellano explained why they were asking \n14  him to go to the office. C.B. kept his head down and quietly said he was not going. \n15  For thirty seconds, Deputy Loza repeated different variations of “do you \n16  understand you are going to the office?” but never explained why. C.B. remained \n17  completely still, repeating that he was not going at a barely audible volume.  \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26  Body Camera Image: C.B. sits with his head down while Deputy Loza demands \nhe go to the office\n \n27 \n                                           \n28 \n22 A true and correct copy of the October 8, 2019, body camera footage is incorporated by reference as \nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 2. Plaintiff will fill Exhibit 2 separately under seal with this Court. \n \n23 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 24 of 76   Page ID #:24\n \n \n1  94.  After less than ninety seconds, Deputy Loza grabbed the back of \n2  C.B.’s sweatshirt and physically pulled him out of his seat. She then passed C.B. to \n3  CSO Arellano. While CSO Arellano twisted the four foot, eight inch boy’s wrists \n4  behind his back to try and force handcuffs on him, Deputy Loza repeated, “You are \n5  going to the office.” Again, consistent with his disabilities and behavior that they \n6  had seen him exhibit before, C.B. swore and stated that he was not going. The \n7  officers then tackled C.B., pinned him to the ground, and pressed him face down \n8  into the floor. He screamed out in pain: “Ow! My knee!” CSO Arellano then dug \n9  his own knee into C.B.’s back, and Deputy Loza placed him in handcuffs. Neither \n10  officer spoke to C.B. about his legal rights.  \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \nBody Camera Image: CSO Arellano puts his knee into C.B.’s back while Deputy \n22  Loza places C.B. in handcuffs\n \n23  95.  The Sheriff’s Department footage also shows that while the two \n24  officers pinned C.B. on the ground, Deputy Loza threatened him by stating that if \n25  he moved then the handcuffs were “going to get tight on [him].” While C.B.’s \n26  hands are out of frame, a distinct clicking can be heard on video for about thirty \n27  seconds, as Deputy Loza presumably followed through with her threat and \n28  tightened C.B.’s handcuffs. C.B. wiggled on his stomach briefly and swore, \n \n24 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 25 of 76   Page ID #:25\n \n \n1  behavior consistent with his disabilities and of being physically and mechanically \n2  restrained and having handcuffs tightened. He then laid still on the ground, \n3  facedown and handcuffed. Deputy Loza radioed an unknown person and stated: “I \n4  have one juvenile detained. He’s being uncooperative.” \n5  96.  The Sheriff’s Department footage then shows Deputy Loza and CSO \n6  Arellano pulling C.B. to his feet and pushing him towards the classroom door, \n7  while C.B. squirmed and cried out to be let go. The officers again physically forced \n8  C.B. face down onto the floor. Another CSO then arrived (the “second CSO”).23 \n9  The second CSO told C.B. that he should “relax.” At one point while CSO \n10  Arellano held C.B. facedown, Deputy Loza stood over him and accused him of \n11  kicking. The video does not show C.B. kicking anyone in frame.   \n12  97.  The officers surrounded C.B. and held him face-down on the floor for \n13  almost two minutes. The video shows Deputy Loza, CSO Arellano, and the second \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nBody Camera Image: Unknown CSO twists C.B.’s leg and pushes it into the \n25 \nground. CSO Arellano and Deputy Loza are to the left holding C.B. down.\n \n26 \n                                           \n23 On information and belief, the second CSO was Demetrius Owens. CSO Arellano is heard on video using his \n27 \nradio to ask someone he refers to as “Owens” to come assist in the classroom. About thirty seconds later, the \nvideo shows the second CSO entering the classroom. Owens was a CSO assigned to Landmark at the time of the \n28 \nincident. He also handcuffed C.B. on August 26, 2019, along with CSO King. \n \n25 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 26 of 76   Page ID #:26\n \n \n1  CSO pull him up to a seated position on the floor. Still handcuffed, C.B. cried out \n2  as CSO Arellano pressed down on his shoulders. The second CSO also held C.B. \n3  down. The video shows this person twisting C.B.’s leg and using both arms and his \n4  body weight to press C.B.’s calf into the ground.  \n5  98.  C.B. was visibly in pain and cried, “Let me go! Let me go!” While \n6  immobilizing C.B.’s hands, shoulders, and leg, the two male CSOs repeated: “If \n7  you calm down, we calm down. You calm down, we calm down.” C.B. – a child \n8  with known behavioral and emotional disabilities – was  unable to “calm down” \n9  while handcuffed and restrained by three officers.  \n10  99.  The Sheriff’s Department footage then shows two unidentified district \n11  staff arriving, but neither took any steps to intervene. One radioed for Principal \n12  Walker to come to the classroom, but could not reach him. CSO Arellano directed \n13  her to leave the room and find Mr. Walker. All the while, C.B. remained \n14  handcuffed, immobilized on the floor. Deputy Loza stood over him, and threatened \n15  to take him to the police station if he did not calm down.  \n16  100.  After two more minutes, the video shows the second CSO releasing \n17  C.B.’s leg from his hold. The three officers then pulled C.B. into a standing \n18  position, and C.B. cried out in apparent pain. Deputy Loza said that a fourth \n19  officer, her partner, would be arriving to help them escort C.B. off campus to an \n20  awaiting police car. At that point, the body camera footage abruptly ends.  \n21  101.  Deputy Loza and her partner, Deputy Toscano,24 later placed C.B. in \n22  the back of a police car. By that time, given the events that had just occurred and \n23  were continuing to occur, C.B. was experiencing worsening trauma. While locked \n24  in the back seat, C.B. reportedly stated: “I wish I was dead.” At times the deputies \n25  left C.B. alone in the locked car.  \n26  102.  While locked and handcuffed in the police car, C.B. managed to use \n27  his cell phone to call his mother. C.B.’s mother recalls that he repeatedly screamed, \n28 \n                                           \n24 Deputy Loza’s police report does not include Deputy Toscano’s first name.  \n \n26 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 27 of 76   Page ID #:27\n \n \n1  “Tell them to let me go!” before the phone hung up. C.B.’s mother was afraid and \n2  confused; no one from the school had contacted her about these events. When \n3  C.B.’s mother called her son back, Deputy Loza answered the phone. C.B.’s \n4  mother told Deputy Loza that she was on her way to pick C.B. up from school. \n5  Deputy Loza responded that it was too late; the ambulance was coming to pick him \n6  up. However, C.B. remained in the back of the police car for nearly an hour before \n7  an ambulance arrived. During this time, other students passing by saw C.B. \n8  handcuffed in the back of the police car.  \n9  103.  At approximately 12:55 pm, the ambulance took C.B. from Landmark \n10  to Riverside’s Emergency Treatment Service facility for a 5585 evaluation.25 At the \n11  time of hospitalization, the treating psychiatrist, Dr. Alexander Tsang, and treating \n12  therapist, Shirlee Lyons, noted that C.B. presented as “selectively mute.” His \n13  distress began to decrease once his mother arrived, and they discharged him that \n14  day at around 4:00 pm. C.B. spent over half a day handcuffed, held in a police car, \n15  transported by ambulance, and psychiatrically hospitalized. \n16  104.  Days after this incident, Landmark staff handed B.T. a notice of \n17  suspension, which mentioned the alleged rock throwing incident from October 7, \n18  but not the October 8 use of physical and mechanical restraints.  \n19  105.  C.B.’s mother asked staff to provide her with more information about \n20  the school police officers restraining, handcuffing, and holding her son in a police \n21  car. Staff told C.B.’s mother that they had no information about the incident. Based \n22  on information and belief, the District failed to properly document and/or report \n23  this incident. Contrary to its own documentation and reporting procedures, the \n24  District has failed to provide C.B.’s parents with any documentation related to the \n25  October 8, 2019, restraint, handcuffing, detention, or hospitalization. To date, the \n26  District has failed to produce any written Incident Reports from its staff related to \n27 \n                                           \n25 Under California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5585, officers may temporarily place a minor in a \n28 \npsychiatric facility where probable cause supports that “as a result of mental disorder” the minor is: (1) a danger \nto themselves or others or “gravely disabled”; and (2) “voluntary treatment is not available.” \n \n27 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 28 of 76   Page ID #:28\n \n \n1  this handcuffing, even after multiple requests by counsel. Plaintiff presumes based \n2  on this reasonable investigation that none exist.   \n3  106.  The Sheriff’s Department similarly failed to comply with its own \n4  documentation procedures. On information and belief, Deputy Loza turned off her \n5  body camera before the incident ended, against Sheriff’s Department policy. Also \n6  against Sheriff’s Department policy, Deputy Loza did not document her reasons for \n7  turning off her camera in a report or memorandum. In addition, despite requests \n8  from counsel, the Sheriff’s Department has not produced all body camera footage \n9  from Deputy Loza for this incident. Also, on information and belief, Deputy \n10  Toscano did not create a police report or body camera footage for this incident \n11  and/or the Sheriff’s Department did not produce these records. \n12  107.  The SROs violated their own Policies 306.2.3 and 324.9 when they \n13  handcuffed C.B., who was eleven years old at the time and not combative, \n14  threatening, or suspected of committing any crimes.  \n15  108.  Again, on information and belief, Defendants Moreno Valley USD \n16  and Sheriff’s Department did not document the incident or adequately investigate, \n17  train, supervise, or discipline the staff involved.  \n18  Mechanical Restraint No. 4: On December 9, 2019, school police officers \n19  handcuffed C.B. while he was already physically restrained for exhibiting \n20  disability-related behaviors. \n21  109.  After their son was restrained, handcuffed, locked in a police car, and \n22  sent for an involuntary psychiatric hold while at Landmark, C.B. and his parents \n23  were afraid for his safety and no longer wanted him to return to the same school. \n24  110.   After the October 8, 2019, incident, C.B.’s parents made the difficult \n25  decision to keep C.B. at home rather than subject him to further discrimination, \n26  harm and repeated constitutional injuries. He remained at home without any \n27  schooling for approximately five weeks. Desperate for another option, C.B.’s \n28  parents obtained an intra-district transfer permit so that C.B. could attend \n \n28 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 29 of 76   Page ID #:29\n \n \n1  Mountain View Middle School (“Mountain View”). The move forced C.B. to, \n2  among other things, leave his friends and social networks behind. \n3  111.  On December 9, 2019, shortly after starting at Mountain View, \n4  Deputy Loza again handcuffed C.B. after he had a disagreement with a classmate. \n5  C.B. allegedly pulled a classmate’s chair out from under him. The classmate then \n6  shoved C.B. The two children pushed each other a few times, and the teacher \n7  intervened to break it up. Unable to regulate his emotions effectively, C.B. pushed \n8  his teacher and began to throw classroom items.  \n9  112.  The teacher cleared the classroom and called for CSOs and SROs to \n10  respond. CSO Juan Ramirez and CSO Kristopher Woodside arrived first and, \n11  almost immediately, physically restrained C.B., who was displaying disability-\n12  related behaviors. CSO Woodside restrained C.B. on the ground. \n13  113.  Deputy Loza arrived next about fifteen minutes later. Contrary to \n14  Sheriff’s Department protocols, Deputy Loza did not turn on her body camera and \n15  later failed to report why she did not turn it on, despite Department procedures \n16  mandating otherwise. When Deputy Loza arrived, CSOs Ramirez and Woodside \n17  were still physically restraining C.B. Without attempting to deescalate the situation \n18  or address C.B.’s disability-related behaviors, Deputy Loza handcuffed C.B.  \n19  114.  After handcuffing C.B., Deputy Loza transported him to the Moreno \n20  Valley Police Station. While the police held C.B. at the station, Deputy Loza \n21  decided to refer C.B. to the Emergency Treatment Services Center (ETS) for a \n22  5585 evaluation and requested an ambulance transport. Before the ambulance got \n23  to the police station to transport C.B., his mother arrived and asked to take her son \n24  home. But Deputy Loza refused. Instead, C.B’s mother watched the officers escort \n25  her son outside the back of the police station building and into the ambulance.  \n26  115.  The ambulance transported C.B. to the ETS Center. According to the \n27  official police report, an unidentified person restrained C.B. to the gurney during \n28  the ride. Hours later, C.B. finally reunited with his mother and received his \n \n29 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 30 of 76   Page ID #:30\n \n \n1  discharge. This traumatic episode, which involved handcuffing, detention in a \n2  police station, physical restraint on an ambulance gurney, and a psychiatric \n3  hospitalization referral, lasted, in total, around three hours.  \n4  116.  The District later initiated expulsion proceedings against C.B. based \n5  on the initial incident with his classmate at school. On December 20, 2019, the \n6  Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) team met for a Manifestation \n7  Determination Review, a procedure required under federal law before expelling a \n8  student with a disability. The IEP team determined that C.B.’s behaviors – the \n9  same behaviors he had exhibited many times before and in each of the prior \n10  handcuffing incidents – were in fact caused by his disabilities, including ADHD \n11  and ODD. The IEP team’s determination nullified the pending expulsion charges.  \n12  117.  On information and belief, Defendants Moreno Valley USD and \n13  Sheriff’s Department did not document the incident or adequately investigate, \n14  train, supervise or discipline the staff involved. \n15  D. Facts Regarding Systemic Discrimination \n16  Racial and Disability Disparities in Moreno Valley USD \n17  118.  C.B.’s experience highlights systemic discrimination within Moreno \n18  Valley USD. The District refers its students to law enforcement at a much higher \n19  rate than other large California school districts. In 2017-18, as reported to the Civil \n20  Rights Data Collection, the District referred 2,108 students to police or about 6.3 \n21  per 100 students. By comparison, the Los Angeles Unified School District referred \n22  just 1 student per 100. Nearby Riverside Unified School District referred just 3 \n23  students per 1,000.  \n24  119.  The District refers Black students to law enforcement at dramatically \n25  higher rates than non-Black students. In 2017-18, as reported to the Civil Rights \n26  Data Collection, Black students were 13.7% of the District’s student population \n27  but 29% of referrals to law enforcement. The District’s law enforcement referral \n28  rate for Black students is 13.5 per 100 students, more than 2.5 times its referral rate \n \n30 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 31 of 76   Page ID #:31\n \n \n1  for non-Black students (5.2 per 100 students).  \n2  120.   The District’s referral rate of Black students to law enforcement is \n3  exponentially higher than the referral rates for Black students in similarly sized \n4  districts in the state:  \n5 \nLaw Enforcement Referral Rates for Black Students\n6 \nSource: Civil Rights Data Collection, 2017-18 Survey \n7 \n16\n13.5\n8  14\nReferrals Per 100 Black Students\n12\n9  10\n8\n10 \n6\n4\n2.2\n11  2 1.4 0.9 0 0 0.3 1.1 1.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.9 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 1 0.2\n0\n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17  121.  The Sheriff’s Department’s school arrest data further show that Black \n18  students are more likely to be arrested and arrested for non-violent offenses than \n19  their non-Black peers. Of Black students arrested on campus, 78% were arrested \n20  for non-violent offenses, compared to 63% of non-Black students arrested on \n21  campus. Similarly, 46% of Black students arrested on campus are arrested for the \n22  most minor offense – being out of class during school hours – while only 37% of \n23  non-Black students are arrested for this offense.  \n24  122.  Related to the disproportionate representation of Black students in law \n25  enforcement referrals and arrests is the fact that the District disproportionately \n26  restrains Black students. Per the Civil Rights Data Collection, Black students make \n27  up 37% of all students restrained, almost three times their representation in the \n28  District. The District also disproportionately restrains students with disabilities. \n \n31 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 32 of 76   Page ID #:32\n \n \n1  Students with disabilities make up 61% of all students restrained, over 3.5 times \n2  their representation in the District.  \n3  Defendants’ Discriminatory Policies, Practices, and Procedures \n4  123.  The high rates of law enforcement referrals result from Defendants’ \n5  various policies, practices and procedures that allow and even encourage school \n6  police officer involvement in low-level and disability-related behaviors, even for \n7  incidents that occurred on days prior – like C.B.’s act of throwing a rock. Teachers \n8  or administrators could handle these incidents instead. \n9  124.  For example, the aforementioned “Law Enforcement Services \n10  Agreement” between the District and Sheriff’s Department that establishes the \n11  SRO program does not prohibit SROs from intervening in minor school discipline \n12  incidents. It does not outline when SROs may use restraints or handcuffs. It does \n13  not describe applicable legal protections for students with disabilities, including \n14  the requirement to provide reasonable modifications in police encounters. It does \n15  not provide for alternatives to physical restraint. \n16  125.  The Sheriff’s Department Policies grant SROs broad authority to \n17  intervene in incidents involving students, even where the student has committed no \n18  crime. Policy SRU-003 authorizes SROs to “counsel” students who are “about to \n19  engage” in criminal misconduct. This policy further allows officers to search \n20  students with only “reasonable suspicion” that the student has violated a school \n21  rule, regardless of whether there is a basis for believing that the student has \n22  violated a law or is carrying weapons or contraband. The policy allows SROs to \n23  “stop, question, interview, and take police action without the prior authorization of \n24  the principal.” Policy SRU-004 further authorizes SROs to stop, question, detain, \n25  and cite students simply for being out of class during school hours. \n26  126.  Another example is the District’s 2019-20 Secondary Sequential \n27  Discipline Standard (the “Standard”), a document that dictates the “consequences” \n28  and “interventions” to violations of the student code of conduct. The Standard \n \n32 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 33 of 76   Page ID #:33\n \n \n1  authorizes, and at times requires, school staff to refer students to law enforcement \n2  in situations where California law does not.  \n3  127.  For instance, California Education Code § 48902 mandates school \n4  staff refer students to law enforcement in only limited circumstances involving \n5  major offenses (e.g., assault with a firearm). But the Standard requires District \n6  staff to refer students to law enforcement in many additional circumstances, \n7  including such minor infractions as vandalism or possession of a lighter.  \n8  128.  The Standard also gives staff discretion to refer students to law \n9  enforcement for other non-criminal, low-level offenses that can be handled through \n10  the administrative discipline system or by providing supports and reasonable \n11  modifications. The Standard does not guide staff as to how to exercise their \n12  discretion in referring students to law enforcement, nor does it explain why staff \n13  might refer some students but not others.  \n14  129.  On information and belief, the District does not provide any training \n15  to its staff on how to exercise their law enforcement referral discretion, including \n16  on whether the student conduct is the result of disabilities, whether such referral \n17  will exacerbate students’ disabilities or contribute to racial disparities, and \n18  alternatives to referrals. \n19  130.  On information and belief, the Sheriff’s Department has failed to \n20  properly train SROs on interacting with students with disabilities. On information \n21  and belief, the Sheriff’s Department has also failed to properly train SROs to \n22  abstain from intervening in incidents involving minor and/or disability-related \n23  behaviors. The SROs’ treatment of C.B. shows that SROs are not appropriately \n24  trained on how to interact with students with disabilities and when to refuse to \n25  intervene in on-campus incidents.  \n26  Failure to Document Mechanical Restraints and Use of Force Incidents \n27  131.  C.B.’s experiences also reveal Defendants’ pervasive failures to \n28  accurately document incidents of restraint and use of force, and to promptly notify \n \n33 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 34 of 76   Page ID #:34\n \n \n1  parents of such incidents. This practice of general applicability, inter alia, \n2  discriminates against students with disabilities who may not be able to explain \n3  what happened to them because of impaired communication abilities, trauma, or \n4  other disability-related reasons.   \n5  132.  The District’s own restraint policies, supra note 18, require “all \n6  personnel” who assist in a restraint to complete their own “Incident Report” and \n7  submit it to District administrators for their review. But as described above, the \n8  District and its staff routinely violated this policy by failing to complete an \n9  Incident Report for every single one of C.B.’s handcuffings. C.B.’s parents still do \n10  not know the full extent of the CSOs’ use of force and any injuries C.B. sustained. \n11  C.B. was, and still is, unable to fully discuss or describe these traumatic events.   \n12  133.  Further, under District Board Policy 5145.11, administrators must \n13  attempt to contact the parent before allowing law enforcement to question a \n14  student. Administrators must make further attempts to contact the student’s parent \n15  before allowing law enforcement to remove a student from campus. If an SRO \n16  arrests or removes a student from campus, both Policy SRU-003 and \n17  Administrative Regulation 5145.11 require the SRO to inform the school \n18  administrator and sign the “Removal of Student from Campus” form. In C.B.’s \n19  case, the District administrator failed to create this form or make any attempt to \n20  contact C.B.’s parents in three of the four known incidents.  \n21  134.  On information and belief, Defendants District, Kedziora, and Scott \n22  are aware that CSOs violate state law and District policies by unnecessarily \n23  restraining students, including disabled students, Black students, and Black \n24  disabled students, and by failing to document and report restraints and resulting \n25  student injuries to parents, but take no steps to investigate or discipline the CSOs. \n26  135.  The Sheriff’s Department and County have failed to provide all \n27  documentation of the cuffings of C.B. involving SROs. Further, contrary to \n28  Sheriff’s Department protocols, Deputy Loza turned off her body camera early \n \n34 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 35 of 76   Page ID #:35\n \n \n1  during the October 8, 2019, use of force incident. She failed to turn it on at all \n2  during the cuffing on December 9, 2019, and did not submit the required report \n3  explaining why.  \n4  136.  On information and belief, the Sheriff’s Department, Sheriff Bianco, \n5  and County are aware that SROs violate internal policies by failing to properly \n6  document use of force incidents in writing or on body camera, but fail to \n7  investigate or discipline these SROs.  \n8  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n9  Unreasonable Seizure and Excessive Force in Violation of the Fourth and \n10  Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n11  (Defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, Owens, Arellano, Does 1-10) \n12  137.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n13  fully set forth herein.  \n14  138.  The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects Plaintiff \n15  C.B. against unreasonable seizures and excessive force. The Fourteenth \n16  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution extends this protection to the states.  \n17  139.  Whether a seizure is unreasonable and unconstitutional depends upon \n18  the totality of the circumstances.  \n19  140.  Defendants’ actions described herein constituted a seizure that was \n20  objectively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances, in violation of the \n21  Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n22  141.  The seizures of Plaintiff C.B. were unreasonable in light of the totality \n23  of the circumstances, including but not limited to:  \n24  a.  C.B.’s age, size, and disabilities, including his limited ability to \n25  impose physical harms on others and limited ability to form criminal \n26  intent;  \n27  b.  That C.B. was exhibiting behavior typical of school-age children \n28  and/or related to his disabilities while at his middle school;  \n \n35 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 36 of 76   Page ID #:36\n \n \n1  c.  That C.B. did not actively resist school officer intervention or attempt \n2  to flee; \n3  d.  The length of the time between the alleged behaviors and the seizures \n4  (e.g., the third incident occurred more than twenty-four hours after the \n5  disciplinary incident involving C.B.);  \n6  e.  That the handcuffing incidents violated District and SRO policies and \n7  state law governing physical and mechanical restraints;  \n8  f.  The length of time of the handcuffing; and  \n9  g.  The trauma of the handcuffing and restraint techniques, including \n10  from officers simultaneously shackling C.B.’s wrists and ankles and \n11  digging a knee into his back while pinning him facedown. \n12  142.  By engaging in the acts described herein, Defendants Scott, Loza, \n13  Walker, Owens, Arellano, and Does 1-10, acting under color of state law and with \n14  deliberate indifference, violated C.B.’s rights under the U.S. Constitution to be free \n15  from unreasonable seizures and excessive force.  \n16  143.  Defendants Walker and Scott are liable as supervisors because the \n17  actions described herein constituted culpable action or inaction in the training, \n18  supervision, and control of subordinates, acquiescence in the constitutional \n19  deprivation after a complaint/incidents was made/occurred, and showed a reckless \n20  or callous indifference to C.B.’s rights. \n21  144.  The right of C.B. to be free from unreasonable seizures and excessive \n22  force as described herein was clearly established in law at the time of the incidents \n23  alleged. As a proximate result of Defendants’ unreasonable seizure and use of \n24  excessive force, C.B. has suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional \n25  distress, pain, humiliation and exacerbation of his disabilities. C.B. continues to \n26  experience fear, distrust, and anxiety regarding law enforcement officers.  \n27  145.  C.B. is entitled to damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and \n28  reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n \n36 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 37 of 76   Page ID #:37\n \n \n1  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  Monell Claim, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n3  (Defendants County of Riverside and Riverside County Sheriff’s Department) \n4  146.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n5  fully set forth herein. \n6  147.  Defendants County of Riverside and Sheriff’s Department maintain \n7  and implement the following unconstitutional policies, practices, and/or customs:  \n8  a.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of SRO intervention in minor \n9  misconduct typical of school-age children and/or related to their \n10  disabilities; \n11  b.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of SRO use of excessive and \n12  unnecessary physical and mechanical restraint and other physical \n13  force on children; \n14  c.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of repeated constitutional violations \n15  that were not properly investigated and/or documented and for which \n16  the violators were not disciplined, reprimanded, or punished, and C.B. \n17  suffered constitutional injuries as a result; and  \n18  d.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of SROs failing to use their body \n19  cameras, or using their body cameras improperly, during handcuffings \n20  and other use of force incidents at school. \n21  148.  These policies, practices, and customs were the moving forces in \n22  Defendants’ unreasonable seizures and use of excessive force on C.B. described \n23  above and alleged in the First Claim for Relief. Defendants’ policies, practices, and \n24  customs are frequent, consistent, and widespread, as evidenced in part by the \n25  SROs’ similar use of force on C.B. at two separate District campuses.  \n26  149.  Defendants exhibited deliberate indifference to the constitutional \n27  rights of C.B. in maintaining such policies, practices, and customs. Defendants’ \n28  practice violates the Sheriff’s Department’s own policies, including Policies \n \n37 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 38 of 76   Page ID #:38\n \n \n1  306.2.3 and 324.9, and Policy SRU-003. \n2  150.  Defendants knew or should have known that maintaining such \n3  policies, practices, and customs were in violation of well-established constitutional \n4  rights of minors – especially those with disabilities – to be treated with special care \n5  by police officers. The Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs did directly \n6  result in the pattern of violations of C.B.’s constitutional rights.  \n7  151.  Further, on information and belief, Defendants Sheriff’s Department \n8  and County have failed and continue to fail to train and supervise SROs so as to \n9  prevent a pattern of lawful restraints from occurring.  \n10  152.  Defendants do not adequately train SROs on how to safely and \n11  appropriately interact with students, especially students with disabilities. \n12  Defendants failure to train in this area constitutes deliberate indifference in light of \n13  the statistical likelihood, based on national and District-level data, that SROs will \n14  disproportionately encounter students with disabilities. Defendants also do not \n15  adequately train SROs on when to abstain from intervening in incidents involving \n16  minor and/or disability-related behaviors. \n17  153.  Defendants have also failed to train and ensure compliance with state \n18  laws and internal procedures pertaining to restraints, including but not limited to \n19  restrictions on the physical and mechanical restraint of children with and without \n20  disabilities, documentation and parent notification requirements for restraint and \n21  injury, and proper body camera procedures.   \n22  154.  Despite evidence that SROs routinely disregard state laws and internal \n23  procedures, Defendants have failed to investigate, discipline, and terminate officers \n24  who unlawfully restrain children and fail to document these restraints in police \n25  reports and on body camera footage. \n26  155.  As a proximate result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, C.B. has \n27  suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional distress, pain, and exacerbation \n28  of his disabilities. C.B. continues to experience fear, distrust, and anxiety regarding \n \n38 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 39 of 76   Page ID #:39\n \n \n1  law enforcement officers.  \n2  156.  C.B. is entitled to damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and \n3  reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  \n4  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  VIOLATIONS OF TITLE II OF THE ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 \n6  (Defendants Moreno Valley USD, Superintendent Kedziora, County of Riverside,  \n7  Sheriff’s Department, and Sheriff Bianco) \n8  157.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n9  fully set forth herein.  \n10  158.  Congress enacted the ADA to “to provide a clear and comprehensive \n11  national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \n12  disabilities” and “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \n13  discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)-(2). \n14  159.  Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a \n15  disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or \n16  be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \n17  be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n18  160.  C.B. is an individual with a disability under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § \n19  12102. His disabilities substantially limit one or more major life activities, \n20  including learning, concentration, thinking, and interacting with others.  \n21  161.  As a school-age child who lives in the District, he is qualified to \n22  participate in Defendants’ educational programs and services. 42 U.S.C. § \n23  12131(2). \n24  162.  Defendants Moreno Valley USD, County of Riverside, and Sheriff’s \n25  Department are all public entities within the meaning of the ADA. Defendants \n26  Superintendent Kedziora and Sheriff Bianco are officials responsible for running \n27  and/or supervising the operations of their respective public entities.  42 U.S.C. § \n28  12131(1).   \n \n39 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 40 of 76   Page ID #:40\n \n \n1  163.  Defendant Moreno Valley USD is legally responsible for all \n2  violations of the ADA committed by Defendants County and/or Sheriff’s \n3  Department in the course of performing security services to students within the \n4  District. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n5  164.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants are \n6  violating the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations, 28 \n7  C.F.R. Pt. 35, including by: \n8  a.  Failing to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and \n9  procedures to avoid discrimination against C.B.;  \n10  b.  Utilizing methods of administration that have the effect of defeating \n11  or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of \n12  Defendants’ programs with respect to C.B., including using police to \n13  enforce school rules, rather than teachers and administrators; \n14  c.  Denying C.B. an opportunity to participate in and benefit from \n15  educational services that is equal to that afforded of other students.  \n16  165.  In addition, through the acts and omissions described above, the \n17  District and Superintendent Kedziora in his official capacity are violating the \n18  ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, by: \n19  a.  Aiding or perpetuating discrimination by providing significant \n20  assistance to the County and/or Sheriff’s Department, public entities \n21  that discriminate against C.B.; and  \n22  b.  Subjecting C.B. to disability-based harassment that is so severe and \n23  pervasive that it creates a hostile learning environment. \n24  166.  Defendants at all times have known or should have known that C.B. \n25  was a student with disabilities and required reasonable modifications.  \n26  167.  Defendants have demonstrated a deliberate indifference that harm to \n27  Plaintiffs’ federally protected rights under the ADA was substantially likely, and \n28  failed to act upon that likelihood.  \n \n40 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 41 of 76   Page ID #:41\n \n \n1  168.  The acts and omissions of Defendants have caused and will continue \n2  to cause C.B. to suffer irreparable harm, and he has no adequate remedy at law. \n3  169.  Under the ADA, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs as \n4  appropriate and permitted by law, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205. \n5  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n6  VIOLATION OF SECTION 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n7  (Defendants Moreno Valley USD, Superintendent Kedziora, County of Riverside, \n8  Sheriff’s Department, and Sheriff Bianco) \n9  170.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n10  fully set forth herein. \n11  171.  Section 504 provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \n12  disability in the United States...shall, solely by reason of [their] disability, be \n13  excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n14  discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \n15  assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n16  172.  Plaintiff C.B. is a qualified individual with a disability under Section \n17  504.  \n18  173.  Defendants are recipients of federal funds.  \n19  174.  Solely by reason of his disabilities, C.B. has been excluded from \n20  participation in, denied the benefit of, and subjected to discrimination in his \n21  attempts to receive meaningful and equal access to the facilities, programs, \n22  services, and activities offered by Defendants in violation of Section 504, 29 \n23  U.S.C. § 794, et seq., and its implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. Pt. 104 (U.S. \n24  Department of Education) and 28 C.F.R. 42.501 et seq. (U.S. Department of \n25  Justice). The Defendants’ acts and omissions violating C.B.’s rights under the \n26  ADA also violate his rights under Section 504 (see Third Claim for Relief, supra). \n27  175.  Defendants have demonstrated a deliberate indifference that harm to \n28  Plaintiffs’ federally protected rights under Section 504 was substantially likely, \n \n41 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 42 of 76   Page ID #:42\n \n \n1  and failed to act upon that likelihood. \n2  176.  The acts and omissions of Defendants have caused and will continue \n3  to cause C.B. to suffer irreparable harm, and he has no adequate remedy at law. \n4  177.  Under Section 504, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs \n5  as appropriate and permitted by law, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a. \n6  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n7  VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE § 11135 et seq. \n8  (Defendants Moreno Valley USD, Superintendent Kedziora, County of Riverside,  \n9  Sheriff’s Department, and Sheriff Bianco) \n10  178.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n11  fully set forth herein. \n12  179.  California Government Code § 11135 prohibits discrimination under, \n13  and the denial of full and equal access to the benefits of, state-funded programs \n14  and activities on the basis of race, ethnicity, and disability.  \n15  180.  Violations of the ADA constitute violations of Government Code § \n16  11135(b).  \n17  181.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff C.B. has been and is a \n18  qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of California law. Cal. \n19  Gov’t Code § 12926. As a Black student, C.B. is entitled to California law \n20  protections against discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity. Id. \n21  182.  Defendants Moreno Valley USD, County of Riverside, and Sheriff’s \n22  Department are public agencies that receive financial assistance from the State of \n23  California. Defendants Kedziora and Sheriff Bianco are officials responsible for \n24  running and/or supervising the operations of their respective public entities.   \n25  183.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants are \n26  violating Government Code § 11135, and its implementing regulations, Cal. Code \n27  Regs. tit. 2, § 11154. Defendants discriminate against C.B. and other similarly \n28  situated Black students with respect to law enforcement referrals that result in an \n \n42 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 43 of 76   Page ID #:43\n \n \n1  adverse disparate impact. Defendants selectively enforce facially neutral policies \n2  by referring Black students to police for less severe behaviors than their non-Black \n3  peers, denying Black students full and equal access to the benefits of their \n4  education without nondiscriminatory justification. Defendants disproportionately \n5  arrest Black students for minor and/or disability-related behaviors. \n6  184.  Defendants also discriminate against C.B. and other similarly situated \n7  Black students with respect to school police restraints that result in an adverse \n8  disparate impact on Black students. These disparities result in part from \n9  Defendants’ implicit and unconscious biases and stereotypes against Black \n10  students, which are incorporated into the Sheriff’s Department policy allowing \n11  SROs to handcuff children who officers perceive as “combative or threatening.” \n12  185.  Defendant Moreno Valley USD has also aided or perpetuated \n13  discrimination by transferring state support to the County and/or Sheriff’s \n14  Department, other recipients of state support that discriminate against C.B. and \n15  other similarly situated Black students, as described supra. \n16  186.  Defendant Moreno Valley USD utilizes methods of administration \n17  that have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of \n18  the objectives of Defendants’ programs with respect to C.B. and other similarly \n19  situated Black students, including using police to enforce school rules, rather than \n20  teachers and administrators.  \n21  187.  Defendant Moreno Valley USD subjects C.B. and other similarly \n22  situated Black students to racial harassment that is so severe and pervasive that it \n23  creates a hostile learning environment. \n24  188.  Defendants have also violated Government Code § 11135 by \n25  discriminating against C.B. and other similarly situated students with disabilities in \n26  violation of the ADA (see Third Claim for Relief, supra).  \n27  189.  Defendant’s actions have caused and will continue to cause C.B. to \n28  suffer irreparable harm, and he has no adequate remedy at law. Because \n \n43 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 44 of 76   Page ID #:44\n \n \n1  Defendant’s discriminatory conduct is ongoing, declaratory and injunctive relief \n2  are appropriate remedies. \n3  190.  C.B. is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n4  SIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE § 51 et seq. \n6  (Defendants Moreno Valley USD and Superintendent Kedziora) \n7  191.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n8  fully set forth herein.   \n9  192.  California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act prohibits business establishments \n10  from discriminating against individuals with disabilities and also prohibits \n11  discrimination based on a person’s disability or perceived disability. Cal. Civ. \n12  Code § 51 et seq.  \n13  193.  Any violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act is also a \n14  violation of the Unruh Act. Cal. Civ. Code § 51(f). \n15  194.  The Unruh Act further makes any entity that “denies, aids or incites a \n16  denial, or makes any discrimination or distinction” prohibited by the Act liable for \n17  damages for “each and every offense.” Cal. Civ. Code § 52. \n18  195.  Defendants are a public entity under Title II of the ADA and a \n19  business establishment under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. \n20  196.  C.B. is an individual with a disability under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § \n21  12102. His disabilities substantially limit one or more major life activities, \n22  including learning, concentration, thinking, and interacting with others.  \n23  197.  Defendants have violated Title II of the ADA as described in the \n24  Third Claim for Relief, supra.  \n25  198.  As a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, C.B. has suffered \n26  injuries including, but not limited to, denial of meaningful access to the benefits of \n27  a public education, humiliation, hardship, pain and suffering, and anxiety. Plaintiff \n28  seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as statutory damages of at least \n \n44 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 45 of 76   Page ID #:45\n \n \n1  $4,000 under California Civil Code § 52(f) for “each and every offense” \n2  Defendants have committed against him or three times his actual damages and \n3  attorneys’ fees and costs.  \n4  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  VIOLATION OF ARTICLE I, § 7(A) AND ARTICLE IV, § 16(A) OF THE \n6  CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION \n7  (Defendants Moreno Valley USD and Superintendent Kedziora) \n8  199.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this \n9  Complaint as though fully set forth herein.  \n10  200.  Moreno Valley USD and Superintendent Kedziora have violated the \n11  rights of C.B. and other Black students and students with disabilities in the District \n12  to receive equal protection of the laws, as guaranteed by Article I, § 7(a) and \n13  Article IV, § 16(a) of the California Constitution, by failing to provide them with \n14  equal educational opportunities that meet the statewide standard.  \n15  201.  These constitutional provisions impose on Defendants the duty to \n16  provide Black students and students with disabilities an equal opportunity to \n17  educational services adequate to teach them the skills they need to succeed as \n18  productive members of society and to meet the statewide education standard – a \n19  safe learning environment free from unnecessary and abusive punishments, \n20  including police stops, restraints, and arrests. See Butt v. State of California, 4 Cal. \n21  4th 668, 687 & n.14, 16 (Cal. 1992).  \n22  202.  Yet Defendants subject Black students, including Black students with \n23  disabilities, to a school program that disproportionately refers them to law \n24  enforcement and thereby imposes unnecessary and harmful restraints and arrests \n25  that create and exacerbate emotional and psychological trauma and interfere with \n26  their fundamental right to a basic education.  \n27  203.  Defendants fall below statewide standards by referring students, and \n28  Black students in particular, to law enforcement at a much higher rate than \n \n45 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 46 of 76   Page ID #:46\n \n \n1  comparably sized school districts. The Defendants have failed to meet their \n2  constitutional duty to prevent these practices and thereby fully deprive Black \n3  students and students with disabilities of access to the classroom, learning, and \n4  their education rights. \n5  204.  As a proximate cause of the actions of Defendants herein, Plaintiff is \n6  entitled to an order and judgment enjoining Defendants from violating his rights \n7  and the rights of similarly situated Black and disabled students to equal protection \n8  under the California Constitution.  \n9  205.  As a proximate cause of the actions of Defendants herein, Plaintiff is \n10  also entitled to a Declaration that Defendants’ actions or omissions violated his \n11  rights and the rights of similarly situated Black and disabled students to equal \n12  protection under the California Constitution. \n13  206.  C.B. is also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. \n14  EIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15  INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS \n16  (All Defendants) \n17  207.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n18  fully set forth herein.   \n19  208.  Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, Arellano, and Does 1-10 \n20  engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct when they intentionally committed the \n21  acts described herein.  \n22  209.  As a proximate result of Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, \n23  Arellano, and Does 1-10’s extreme and outrageous conduct, Plaintiff C.B. has \n24  suffered severe emotional distress. \n25  210.  Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, Arellano, and Does 1-10 \n26  were adults in a position of power over Plaintiff C.B. and aware of his \n27  susceptibility to injuries through emotional distress as a minor student with \n28  disabilities.  \n \n46 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 47 of 76   Page ID #:47\n \n \n1  211.  California Government Code § 815.2 provides that a public entity is \n2  liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the \n3  public entity within the scope of their employment. \n4  212.  The District and Superintendent Kedziora in his official capacity were \n5  at all relevant times the employers of Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Arellano, \n6  and some or all of Does 1-10. \n7  213.  Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Arellano, and some or all of Does \n8  1-10 committed the acts described herein while acting within the scope of their \n9  employment. The District and Superintendent Kedziora are therefore vicariously \n10  liable for these acts.  \n11  214.  The County, Sheriff’s Department, and Sheriff Bianco in his official \n12  capacity were at all times relevant the employers of Defendants Loza and some or \n13  all of Does 1-10. \n14  215.  Defendants Loza and some or all of Does 1-10 committed the acts \n15  described herein while acting within the scope of their employment. The County, \n16  Department, and Sheriff Bianco are therefore vicariously liable for these acts. \n17  216.  Plaintiffs are entitled to Damages according to proof, reasonable \n18  attorneys’ fees, costs of suit incurred herein, and such other and further relief as the \n19  Court deems just and proper. \n20  NINTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n21  FALSE IMPRISONMENT \n22  (All Defendants) \n23  217.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n24  fully set forth herein.   \n25  218.  Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, Arellano, and Does 1-10 \n26  intentionally and unlawfully exercised force or the implied threat of force to \n27  restrain or confine C.B. when they committed the acts described herein.  \n28  219.  Each of the known unlawful restraints of C.B. described supra lasted \n \n47 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 48 of 76   Page ID #:48\n \n \n1  for an appreciable amount of time.  \n2  220.  C.B. did not consent to Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, \n3  Arellano, and Does 1-10’s acts, and as a result of their acts suffered severe harm \n4  and emotional distress. \n5  221.  California Government Code § 815.2 provides that a public entity is \n6  liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the \n7  public entity within the scope of their employment. \n8  222.  The District and Superintendent Kedziora in his official capacity were \n9  at all relevant times the employers of Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Arellano, \n10  and some or all of Does 1-10. \n11  223.

The County, Sheriff’s Department, and Sheriff Bianco in his official \n16  capacity were at all times relevant the employers of Defendants Loza and some or \n17  all of Does 1-10. \n18  225.  Defendants Loza and some or all of Does 1-10 committed the acts \n19  described herein while acting within the scope of their employment. The County, \n20  Department, and Sheriff Bianco are therefore vicariously liable for these acts. \n21  226.  Plaintiffs are entitled to Damages according to proof, reasonable \n22  attorneys’ fees, costs of suit incurred herein, and such other and further relief as the \n23  Court deems just and proper. \n24  TENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n25  BATTERY \n26  (All Defendants) \n27  227.

Defendants Arellano, Owens, and some or all of Does 1-10 became \n14  unfit to perform the work for which they were hired due to their propensity to \n15  subject students to harmful and excessive handcuffings and use of physical force.  \n16  250.  The at least four known, unlawful handcuffings establish that \n17  Defendants Scott and Walker had or should have had prior knowledge of \n18  Defendants Arellano, Owens, and Does 1-10’s propensity to subject C.B. to harm. \n19  They also establish that the risk of harm to C.B. from Defendants Arellano, \n20  Owens, and Does 1-10’s actions was reasonably foreseeable.  \n21  251.  Defendants Scott and Walker’s negligence in supervising Defendants \n22  Arellano, Owens, and Does 1-10 was a substantial factor in causing C.B.’s harm \n23  and injuries.  \n24  252.  California Government Code § 815.2 provides that a public entity is \n25  liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the \n26  public entity within the scope of their employment. \n27  253.  The District and Superintendent Kedziora in his official capacity were \n28  at all times relevant times the employers of Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, \n \n51 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 52 of 76   Page ID #:52\n \n \n1  Arellano, and some or all of Does 1-10. \n2  254.  Defendants Scott and Walker committed the negligent supervision \n3  described herein while acting within the scope of their employment. The District \n4  and Superintendent Kedziora are therefore vicariously liable for these acts.  \n5  255.  Plaintiffs are entitled to Damages according to proof, reasonable \n6  attorneys’ fees, costs of suit incurred herein, and such other and further relief as the \n7  Court deems just and proper. \n8  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n9  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff C.B. prays that the Court grant the following relief: \n10  256.  Order and declare that Defendants are violating the rights of Plaintiff \n11  C.B. under the U.S. Constitution, Title II of the ADA, Section 504, California \n12  Government Code § 11135, Unruh Civil Rights Act, California Constitution, and \n13  state common law torts.  \n14  257.  Enjoin Defendants their successors in office, agents, employees and \n15  assigns, and all persons acting in concert with them, to:  \n16  a.  Stop school police officers from mechanically restraining students and \n17  intervening in low level and disability-related behaviors, up to and \n18  including ordering school police officers to cease patrolling District \n19  schools.  \n20  b.  Provide C.B. and similarly situated students with positive supports \n21  and services in lieu of police intervention so that they may enjoy full \n22  and equal access to the District’s programs.  \n23  258.  Compensatory, general, and special damages, according to proof.  \n24  259.  Award Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs as appropriate and \n25  permitted by law.  \n26  260.  Any other relief as this Court finds just and proper.    \n27  /// \n28  /// \n \n52 \nCOMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 53 of 76   Page ID #:53\n \n \n1  DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL \n2  261.

Gov’t Code § \n910 et seq. \nTo whom it may concern: \nThis is a claim for damages against the Moreno Valley Unified School \nDistrict (“MVUSD” or “District”), the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department \n(“Department”), Moreno Valley Special Education Local Plan Area \n(“SELPA”), the County of Riverside (“County”), and the City of Moreno \nExhibit 1 - page 55\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 56 of 76   Page ID #:56\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 2 of 22 \nValley (“City”) (referred to collectively as “Respondents”) under California \nGovernment Code Section 910 et seq. for injuries sustained by Claimant \nC  B  (hereinafter “C.B.” or “Claimant”) arising out of violations of \nstatutory, common law, and constitutional rights as set forth below. \nI. Summary of Claim\nW  B  and B  T , on behalf of their son, C.B., a minor, bring \nthis claim for deprivations of C.B.’s constitutional, statutory, and common \nlaw rights by Respondents and persons employed by Respondents. B  \nand T  allege that Respondents have subjected C.B. to abusive and \ntraumatic physical and mechanical restraints and have discriminated \nagainst him on the basis of disability and race by, including, but not limited \nto: (1) failing to maintain, implement, and/or reasonably modify policies and \nprocedures to prohibit and prevent the systemic use of physical and \nmechanical restraints; (2) failing to maintain and enforce policies and \nprocedures that ensure prompt, accurate reporting of student injuries and \nrestraints to District administrators, additional authorities, and parents; (3) \nfailing to provide adequate structure, supervision, oversight, and training of \nemployees to ensure that students like C.B. are not injured, and that any \ninjuries are quickly identified, investigated, and prevented in the future.  \nDespite that school districts throughout California have begun to \nincorporate positive behavior supports, restorative justice practices and \nother strategies to focus on addressing the root causes of student \nmisconduct and minimizing the use of officers, the District continues to use \npolice officers to address student misconduct within the District resulting in \ndisability and race-based discrimination, among other legal wrongs.  \nII.

Address to Which Notices Should Be Sent\nPlease address all correspondence related to this claim to C.B.’s counsel, \nRobert Borrelle, at Disability Rights California, 350 South Bixel Street, Suite \n290, Los Angeles, CA 90017. Mr. Borrelle’s telephone number is (213) 213-\n8000 and his email address is Robert.Borrelle@disabilityrightsca.org. \nIV. Date, Place, and Other Circumstances Which Gave Rise to the\nClaim Asserted\nClaimant C.B. is a Black, eleven-year-old boy with multiple disabilities, \nincluding attention deficit hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and oppositional \ndefiant disorder (“ODD”). He has been a student of the District since March \n2019.1 He is an incoming 7th grader at Mountain View Middle School \n(“Mountain View MS”) in MVUSD and has received special education and \nrelated services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP) since \nat least the third grade.2 Prior to attending Mountain View MS, C.B. went to \nLandmark Middle School (“Landmark MS”). Both schools are within \nMVUSD’s boundaries. Claimant intends to remain a student of the District. \nAs a result of his disabilities, Claimant has difficulty with, inter alia, \nregulating his emotions, maintaining focus, and communicating and \ncomplying promptly with directives. These impairments substantially limit \nseveral major life activities including concentrating, thinking, and interacting \nwith others, and several major bodily functions, including brain function.  \n1 C.B. first enrolled in MVUSD in March 2019. He briefly reenrolled in Val Verde Unified \nSchool District from May to June 2019. C.B. then reenrolled in MVUSD in August 2019. \n2 Claimant notes he is eligible for special education and related services as evidence \nthat Respondents had knowledge of his disabilities and to support his disability \ndiscrimination claims. Claimant does not challenge the adequacy of his IEP, nor does \nhe assert the District violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The \nDistrict acknowledged in multiple IEP meetings that the handcuffing incidents described \nherein are not part of C.B.’s special education program or IEP and should not be \ndiscussed or addressed in an IEP. The District and Claimant agree these incidents and \nrelief for such claims are issues separate from C.B.’s IEP/special education. \nExhibit 1 - page 57\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 58 of 76   Page ID #:58\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 4 of 22 \nAt all times relevant to this claim, Respondents have known or should have \nknown that C.B. is a child with disabilities. For example, C.B.’s disabilities \nare well-documented in his IEP,3 which includes references to his \ndiagnoses and disability-related behaviors. His behaviors include acting \nout, cursing, and difficulty complying promptly with verbal demands. \nC.B.’s build is slender; he stood 4’8” tall and weighed about 70 pounds at \nthe time of the events discussed herein. Despite C.B.’s small size and their \nknowledge of his disabilities, Respondents and their agents repeatedly \ntackled and handcuffed him over a span of three and half months as \npunishment for his disability-related behavior. Claimant provides detailed \nfactual explanations of these illegal restraints in Section IV.A-D below. C.B. \nhad never been handcuffed before these incidents.\nAs a result of Respondents’ acts and/or omissions, C.B. has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer severe emotional distress, trauma, physical harm, \nhumiliation, reputational consequences, and loss of his civil rights. He has \nhad difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, and expressing his emotions. \nC.B.’s parents have noticed he is more “shut down” emotionally than he\nwas before. He has also exhibited new, more intense, and more frequent\nbehaviors in school and a fear of police officers. C.B.’s parents secured\ntherapy services for their son to help him cope with the trauma he\nexperienced and continues to experience from these incidents.\nA. On information and belief, on or about August 21, 2019, the\nDistrict’s agents and representatives handcuffed C.B. for\nconduct resulting from his disabilities.\nOn or about August 21, 2019, District staff handcuffed C.B. for the first time \nat Landmark MS. Then-Landmark MS Assistant Principal Pedro Gutierrez \ncalled C.B.’s mother, Ms. T , to tell her to pick C.B. up from school \nearly because he was “acting up.” On information and belief, C.B. was \nexhibiting behaviors that were caused by his disability.  \nWhen Ms. T  arrived at Landmark MS, Mr. Gutierrez verbally informed \nher that school police officers had handcuffed C.B. The officers removed \nthe handcuffs before Ms. T  arrived. Mr. Gutierrez said that he \n3 See footnote 2, supra. \nExhibit 1 - page 58\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 59 of 76   Page ID #:59\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 5 of 22 \ninstructed officers to remove the handcuffs because he believed \nhandcuffing C.B. was “totally unacceptable,” or words to that effect. \nMr. Gutierrez did not provide Ms. T  any further information. The \nDistrict did not provide parents or counsel with a written incident report for \nthis handcuffing incident, even though SELPA policy required District staff \nto create written reports (hereinafter “Incident Reports”) after using such \ninterventions on students. At this time, Claimant believes that only District \nstaff – i.e., not Department officers – were involved in the incident. \nB. On August 26, 2019, the District’s agents and\nrepresentatives shackled C.B.’s hands and ankles for\nconduct resulting from his disabilities.\nOn August 26, 2019, District staff handcuffed C.B. for the second time at \nLandmark MS. The incident began when Mr. Gutierrez directed Campus \nSecurity Officer (“CSO”)4 Demetrius Owens to bring C.B. to the office for a \nmeeting. CSO Owens’ report does not describe a reason for this meeting, \ndemonstrating the District’s defective record keeping practices. A behavior \nlog drafted by C.B.’s teacher, Mr. Proprofsky, says that C.B. had disrupted \nclass earlier in the day by cursing and ripping paper. As such, Claimant \nsuspects that the meeting with Mr. Gutierrez may have been related to his \nalleged disruptive behavior in class – which took place approximately three \nhours before Mr. Gutierrez summoned him to his office.  \nCSO Owens, along with CSO King (first name unknown), and then-\nLandmark MS Assistant Principal Kamilah O’Connor found C.B. on the \nplayground. All three directed C.B. to leave the playground and go to the \noffice. C.B. verbally refused and started to exhibit conduct related to his \ndisability, including an inability to self-regulate or express himself. He \nallegedly clenched his fists and began breathing heavily. CSO King and \nCSO Owens responded by dragging C.B. by his arms to a seclusion room. \nThen-Landmark MS Principal Scott Walker joined the CSOs Owens and \nKing. Surrounded by three much larger adults in the seclusion room, C.B. \nbegan experiencing and externalizing emotions of fear, anxiety, and \nfrustration. He began pulling away, pushing, and swinging with his arms in \n4 On information and belief, MVUSD established its CSO program pursuant to California \nEducation Code section 38000. Claimant believes that CSOs are District employees. \nExhibit 1 - page 59\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 60 of 76   Page ID #:60\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 6 of 22 \nan attempt to free himself from the room. C.B. was not acting out \nphysically before the CSOs physically dragged him to the seclusion room. \nMr. Walker directed CSO King and CSO Owens to handcuff C.B. At the \ntime, C.B. was 4’8” tall and approximately seventy pounds. The CSOs \nplaced C.B. in a physical control hold, tackled him to the floor, and forced \nhim into District-issued metal cuffs. The CSOs pulled C.B. up from the \nground and attempted to sit him in a chair. Now handcuffed in a seclusion \nroom and surrounded by three adults, C.B. became even more upset and \ndistressed. Unable to regulate his emotions due to his disabilities, he \nbegan flailing his legs towards the CSOs.  \nMr. Walker then directed CSO King and CSO Owens to place handcuffs \non C.B.’s ankles. The CSOs complied and simultaneously shackled C.B.’s \nhands and ankles with metal cuffs. C.B. remained shackled in this manner \nfor an unknown period of time.  \nThe District suspended C.B. from school that day and his aunt came to \npick him up. She was concerned and confused to find C.B. sitting in the \nfetal position against the wall of the seclusion room. His arms were \nhugging his knees and his head was down. C.B. was not wearing a shirt, \nwhich had come off during his struggle with the CSOs. A desk was \nblocking the door to the seclusion room. C.B. and his aunt helped school \nstaff clean up the room, and then she took him home. No one told C.B.’s \naunt that CSOs had physically tackled C.B. and then handcuffed and leg-\ncuffed him. District staff never told C.B.’s parents of the incident either.   \nThe District never gave an Incident Report to C.B.’s parents. In November \n2019, counsel made a request to MVUSD for a full and complete copy of \nC.B.’s educational records. Only after counsel received the records did \nC.B.’s parents learn that the CSOs shackled C.B.’s hands and ankles. The \nDistrict provided Claimant with CSO King’s and CSO Owens’ witness \nstatements, which were missing at least two pages. Further, the District \ndid not provide a witness statement from Mr. Walker. The District has not \nresponded to counsel’s January 2020 follow-up request for the missing \npages. On information and belief, the District did not adequately \ninvestigate, train, supervise, or discipline staff involved in this incident.\nExhibit 1 - page 60\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 61 of 76   Page ID #:61\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 7 of 22 \nC. On October 8, 2019, Respondents’ representatives and\nagents tackled C.B. and handcuffed him while pressing a\nknee into his back for disability-related behaviors.\nOn October 7, 2019, C.B. allegedly threw a rock in the general direction of \nCSO Manuel Arellano. Per the Department’s police report obtained by \nClaimant’s counsel dated October 8, 2019, sometime after school hours on \nOctober 7, 2019, an unidentified District staff member requested that \nDeputy Norma Loza (“Deputy Loza”) intervene and “investigate.”5 On \ninformation and belief, the District contracts with the Department to run its \nSchool Resource Officer (“SRO”) program. Unlike CSOs, SROs are \nemployees of the Department. Further, on information and belief, the City \nof Moreno Valley contracts with the Department for its services.   \nOn October 8, Deputy Loza and CSO Arellano arrived at C.B.’s special \neducation classroom to investigate the alleged rock-throwing from the day \nbefore. At no time prior to involving the CSOs and SROs did anyone with \nthe District attempt to arrange a meeting with C.B. with his parents present. \nUnlike the other incidents where school police officers handcuffed C.B., \nDeputy Loza’s body camera partially captured the October 8 incident. At \nClaimant’s counsel’s request, the Department produced a video that is \napproximately 8-minutes long. On information and belief, Deputy Loza shut \noff her body camera before the incident concluded, violating Department \npolicy and leaving the remaining hour of the incident unfilmed.  \nBased on the review of the available Department footage, immediately \nupon entering C.B.’s classroom, Deputy Loza directed the teacher (name \nunknown) to remove the other students from the classroom. This left C.B. \nalone with Deputy Loza and CSO Arellano. C.B. sat motionless at his desk \nwith his head down. Deputy Loza stood over C.B. and said, “You’re going \nto go to the office, no matter what. Either you go, cooperating, or I’m going \nto take you to the office.” Neither Deputy Loza nor CSO Arellano explained \n5 On information and belief, the unidentified District staff member in the police report is \nCSO Arellano. The police report states an individual (name redacted) contacted Deputy \nLoza on October 7, 2019 and alleged that C.B. threw a rock in his direction earlier that \nday at Landmark MS. Separately, on October 7, 2019, CSO Arellano added a behavior \nlog entry in C.B.’s education file alleging that C.B. threw a rock towards him. School \nstaff did not create a behavior log entry documenting its restraint of C.B. on October 8. \nExhibit 1 - page 61\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 62 of 76   Page ID #:62\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 8 of 22 \nto C.B. why they were asking him to go to the office. C.B. kept his head \ndown on his arms and quietly said he was not going. For thirty seconds, \nDeputy Loza repeated different variations of “do you understand you are \ngoing to the office?” but never explained why. C.B. remained completely \nstill, repeating that he was not going at barely audible volume.  \nAfter less than 90 seconds, the footage shows, Deputy Loza grabbed the \nback of C.B.’s sweatshirt and physically pulled him out of his seat. She then \npassed C.B. to CSO Arellano. While CSO Arellano twisted the 4’8” boy’s \nwrists behind his back to try and force handcuffs on him, Deputy Loza \nrepeated, “You are going to the office.” Again, consistent with his \ndisabilities and behavior that they had seen him exhibit before, C.B. swore \nand stated he was not going. The officers then tackled C.B., pinned him to \nthe ground, and pressed him face down into the floor. He screamed out in \npain: “Ow! My knee!” CSO Arellano then dug his own knee into C.B.’s back, \nand Deputy Loza placed him in handcuffs. Neither officer spoke to C.B. \nabout his legal rights.  \nThe Department footage also shows that while the two officers pinned C.B. \non the ground, Deputy Loza told him not to move or the handcuffs were \n“going to get tight on you.” While C.B.’s hands are out of frame, a distinct \nclicking can be heard on video for about thirty seconds, as Deputy Loza \npresumably followed through with her threat and tightened C.B.’s \nhandcuffs. C.B. wiggled on his stomach briefly and swore, behavior \nconsistent with his disabilities and of being physically and mechanically \nrestrained. He then laid still on the ground, facedown and handcuffed. \nDeputy Loza radioed an unknown person and stated: “I have one juvenile \ndetained. He’s being uncooperative.” \nThe video then shows Deputy Loza and CSO Arellano pulling C.B. to his \nfeet and pushing him towards the classroom door, while C.B. squirmed and \ncried out to be let go. The officers again physically forced C.B. face down \nonto the floor. Another CSO then arrived (the “second CSO”).6 The second \n6 On information and belief, the second CSO was Demetrius Owens. CSO Arellano can \nbe heard on video using his radio to ask someone he refers to as “Owens” to come \nassist in the classroom. About 30 seconds later, the video shows the second CSO \nentering the classroom. Owens was a CSO assigned to Landmark MS at the time of the \nincident. He also handcuffed C.B. on August 26, 2019, along with CSO King. \nExhibit 1 - page 62\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 63 of 76   Page ID #:63\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 9 of 22 \nCSO told C.B. that he should “relax.” At one point while CSO Arellano held \nC.B. facedown, Deputy Loza stood over him and accused him of kicking. \nThe video does not show C.B. kicking anyone in frame.\nThe officers surrounded C.B. and held him face-down on the floor for \nalmost two minutes. The video shows Deputy Loza, CSO Arellano, and the \nsecond CSO pull him up to a seated position on the floor. Still handcuffed, \nC.B. cried out as CSO Arellano pressed down on his shoulders. The \nsecond CSO used what appears to be a pain compliance hold on C.B. The \nvideo shows this person twisting C.B.’s leg and using both arms and his \nbody weight to press C.B.’s calf into the ground. C.B. cried, “Let me go! Let \nme go!” While immobilizing C.B.’s hands, shoulders, and leg, the two male \nCSOs repeated: “If you calm down, we calm down. You calm down, we \ncalm down.” C.B. – a child with known emotional disabilities – was unable \nto “calm down” while handcuffed and restrained by three officers.\nThe Department footage then shows two unidentified district staff arriving, \nbut neither took any steps to intervene. One radioed for Principal Walker to \ncome to the classroom, but could not reach him. CSO Arellano directed her \nto leave the room and find Mr. Walker. All the while, C.B. remained \nhandcuffed, immobilized on the floor. Deputy Loza stood over him, and \nthreatened to take him to the police station if he did not calm down.  \nAfter two more minutes, the second CSO can be seen finally releasing \nC.B.’s leg from the pain compliance hold. The three officers then pulled \nC.B. into a standing position, and C.B. cried out in apparent pain. Deputy \nLoza said that a fourth officer, her partner, would be arriving to help the \nthree officers escort C.B. off campus to the awaiting police car. At that \npoint, the body camera footage abruptly ends.\nDeputy Loza and her partner, Deputy Toscano (first name unknown), later \nplaced C.B. in the back of a police car. By that time, given the traumatic \nevents that had just occurred and were continuing to occur, C.B. was \nexperiencing worsening trauma. While locked in the back seat, C.B. stated: \nExhibit 1 - page 63\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 64 of 76   Page ID #:64\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 10 of 22 \n“I wish I was dead.”7 At times the deputies left C.B. alone in the locked car. \nOn information and belief, C.B. was in handcuffs for over an hour. \nWhile locked and handcuffed in the police car, C.B. managed to use his cell \nphone to call his mother. C.B.’s mom recalls that he repeatedly screamed, \n“Tell them to let me go!” before the phone hung up. C.B.’s mom was afraid \nand confused; no one from the school had informed her about these \nevents. When Ms. T  called her son back, Deputy Loza answered the \nphone. Ms. T  told Deputy Loza that she was on her way to pick C.B. \nup from school. Deputy Loza responded that it was too late; the ambulance \nwas coming to pick him up. C.B. remained in the back of the police car for \nnearly another hour before an ambulance arrived. During this time, other \nstudents passing by saw C.B. handcuffed in the back of the police car.  \nAt approximately 12:55 pm, the ambulance took C.B. from Landmark MS to \nRiverside’s Emergency Treatment Service facility for a Section 5585 \nevaluation.8 At the time of hospitalization, the treating psychiatrist, Dr. \nAlexander Tsang, and treating therapist, Shirlee Lyons, noted C.B. \npresented as “selectively mute.” His distress began to decrease once his \nmom arrived, and they discharged him that day at around 4:00 pm. C.B. \nspent over half a day handcuffed, held in a police car, transported by \nambulance, and psychiatrically hospitalized. \nDays after this incident, Landmark staff handed Ms. T  a notice of \nsuspension, which only mentioned the alleged rock throwing incident from \nOctober 7 and not the use of physical and mechanical restraints. Ms. T  \nasked staff to provide her with more information about the school police \nofficers restraining, handcuffing, and holding her son in a police car. Staff \ntold Ms. T  they had no information about the incident. Contrary to its \nown documentation and reporting procedures, the District did not and has \nnot provided Ms. T  and Mr. B  with any documentation related to \n7 C.B. later told his dad that he intentionally made these statements to protect himself. \nC.B. was afraid because Deputy Loza repeatedly threatened to take him juvenile hall\nwhile he was in the back seat of the police car.\n8 Under California Welfare & Institutions Code section 5585, officers may temporarily \nplace a minor in a psychiatric facility where probable cause supports that “as a result of \nmental disorder” the minor is: (1) a danger to themselves or others or “gravely disabled”; \nand (2) “voluntary treatment is not available.” \nExhibit 1 - page 64\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 65 of 76   Page ID #:65\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 11 of 22 \nthe October 8 restraint, handcuffing, detention, or hospitalization. To date, \nthe District has failed to produce any written Incident Reports from its staff \nrelated to this handcuffing, even after multiple requests by counsel.  \nThe Department similarly failed to comply with its own documentation \nprocedures. On information and belief, Deputy Loza turned off her body \ncamera before the incident ended, against Department policy. Also against \nDepartment policy, Deputy Loza did not document her reasons for turning \noff her camera in a report or memorandum. In addition, despite requests \nfrom counsel, the Department has not produced all body camera footage \nfrom Deputy Loza for this incident. Also, on information and belief, Deputy \nToscano did not create a police report or body camera footage for this \nincident and/or the Department did not produce these records. \nAgain, on information and belief, Respondents did not adequately \ninvestigate, train, supervise, or discipline staff following this incident. \nD. On December 9, 2019, Respondents’ agents and\nrepresentatives handcuffed C.B. while he was already\nphysical restrained for exhibiting disability-related\nbehaviors.\nAfter their son was restrained, handcuffed, locked in a police car, and sent \nfor an involuntary psychiatric hold while at Landmark MS, C.B.’s parents \nwere understandably afraid for his safety and no longer wanted him to \nreturn to the same school. After the October 8, 2019 incident, C.B. \nremained at home from school for approximately five weeks. Desperate for \nanother option, C.B.’s parents obtained an intra-district transfer permit so \nthat C.B. could attend Mountain View MS. The move forced C.B. to, among \nother things, leave his friends and social networks behind. \nEven after changing schools, Respondents’ district-wide discriminatory \npractices and policies and failure to supervise its employees continued to \nharm C.B. On December 9, 2019, shortly after starting at Mountain View \nMS, Respondents again handcuffed C.B. after he had an argument with a \nclassmate. The incident began when C.B. pulled a classmate’s chair out \nfrom under him. The classmate then shoved C.B. The two children pushed \neach other a few times, and the teacher intervened to break it up. Unable \nExhibit 1 - page 65\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 66 of 76   Page ID #:66\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 12 of 22 \nto regulate his emotions effectively, C.B. pushed his teacher and began to \nthrow classroom items.  \nThe teacher cleared the classroom and called for CSOs and SROs to \nrespond. CSO Juan Ramirez and CSO Kristopher Woodside arrived first \nand, almost immediately, physically restrained C.B., who was displaying \ndisability-related behaviors. CSO Woodside restrained C.B. on the ground. \nDeputy Loza arrived next about 15 minutes later. Deputy Loza did not turn \non her body camera and later failed to report why she did not turn it on, \ndespite Department procedures mandating otherwise. When Deputy Loza \narrived, CSOs Ramirez and Woodside were still physically restraining C.B. \nWithout attempting to deescalate the situation or address C.B.’s disability \nrelated behaviors, Deputy Loza handcuffed C.B.  \nAfter handcuffing C.B., Deputy Loza transported him to the Moreno Valley \nPolice Station. While the police held C.B. at the station, Deputy Loza made \nthe decision to refer C.B. to the Emergency Treatment Services Center for \nanother Section 5585 evaluation and requested an ambulance transport. \nBefore the ambulance got to the police station to transport C.B., Ms. T  \narrived and expressed her desire to take her son home. But Deputy Loza \nrefused. Instead, Ms. T  watched the police officers escort her son \noutside the back of the police station building and into the ambulance.  \nThe ambulance transported C.B. to the Emergency Treatment Services \nCenter. According to the official police report, an unidentified person \nrestrained C.B. to the gurney during the ride. Hours later, C.B. finally \nreunited with his mother and received his discharge. This traumatic \nepisode, which involved handcuffing, detention in a police station, physical \nrestraint on an ambulance gurney, and a psychiatric hospitalization referral, \nlasted, in total, approximately three hours.  \nThe District later initiated expulsion proceedings against C.B. based on the \ninitial fight at school. On December 20, 2019, the IEP team met for a \nManifestation Determination Review, a procedure required under the IDEA \nbefore expelling a student with a disability. The IEP team determined that \nC.B.’s behaviors – the same behaviors he had exhibited many times before \nand in each of the prior handcuffing incidents – were in fact caused by his\nExhibit 1 - page 66\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 67 of 76   Page ID #:67\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 13 of 22 \ndisabilities, including ADHD and ODD.9 The IEP team’s determination \nnullified the pending expulsion charges.  \nOn information and belief, Respondents did not document the incident or \nadequately investigate, train, supervise or discipline the staff involved. \nV. Nature of the Legal Claims That Claimant Asserts\nA. Respondents fail to maintain, implement, and reasonably\nmodify policies and procedures to prohibit and prevent the\nsystemic use of physical and mechanical restraints.\ni. Respondents fail to reasonably modify policies, denying\nstudents with disabilities, including students of color,\nmeaningful and equal access to their education\nRespondents’ policies, procedures, and practices related to referrals to law \nenforcement have discriminated against and continue to discriminate \nagainst C.B. and similarly situated students with disabilities and students of \ncolor. Respondents have an obligation to design and modify their policies \nand practices to avoid disability and race discrimination. Their individual \nand joint failures to do so have resulted in, among other things, students \nwith disabilities, like C.B., being subject to interrogation, use of force, \nand/or arrests for conduct relating to their disabilities.  \nThe failure to modify these policies as applied to students with disabilities \ndisproportionately impacts students with disabilities and Black students with \ndisabilities by subjecting them to physical restraint, handcuffing, arrest, \ncampus removal, and involuntary hospitalization at higher rates than their \nnon-disabled or non-Black peers. For example, during the 2015-16 school \nyear, the District referred at least 143 children to law enforcement.10 Of \n9 Claimant includes this information merely to provide evidence that Respondents \ndiscriminated against C.B. by handcuffing him for disability-related behaviors. Claimant \ndoes not challenge the adequacy of his IEP or allege Respondents violated the IDEA.  \n10 Moreno Valley Unified School District, Civil Rights Data Collection (2015-16), \navailable at https://ocrdata.ed.gov/Page?t=d&eid=30417&syk=8&pid=2539. Counsel for \nClaimant requested updated law enforcement referral, on-campus arrest, and \nmechanical restraint data through a California Public Record Act request to the District \non January 3, 2020. To date, the District has not produced this data. \nExhibit 1 - page 67\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 68 of 76   Page ID #:68\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 14 of 22 \nthese, 28% were students with disabilities, compared to just 16.6% of \nchildren districtwide who are students with disabilities.11 Of the students \nwith disabilities referred to law enforcement, 42.5% were Black. This is \nmore than twice the percentage of students with disabilities district-wide \nwho are Black (19.2%).  \nRespondents’ failure to reasonably modify their policies results in further \ntraumatized children, escalated and unnecessary use of physical restraints, \nand worsened behaviors. Respondents operate SRO and CSO programs \nthat discipline and punish students with disabilities, especially Black \nstudents with disabilities, and deny C.B. and similarly situated students \naccess to reasonable modifications in police encounters and deprive them \nof meaningful access to public education and Respondents’ services. \nii. Respondents’ use of force policies and practices are\nunconstitutional\nRespondent violated Claimant’s fourth amendment right to be free from \nunreasonable seizure and excessive use of force in violation of substantive \nand procedural due process. Respondents also violated Claimant’s \nsubstantive and procedural due process rights under the fourteenth \namendment.  \nFurther, based on information and belief, seizure and use of force practices \nused on students within the District were and are unconstitutional. Further, \non information and belief, the District and Department use of force on C.B., \nincluding the use of handcuffs and restraints, by Department officers and \nDistrict staff, resulted in part from a lack of effective training, force review, \nand complaint process. Contributing to these violations is the District’s lack \nof meaningful oversight of its CSOs pursuant to Education Code Section \n38000. On information and belief, Respondents’ policies and procedures \nrelating to the use of SROs and CSOs also have an adverse disparate \nimpact on students with disabilities and students of color like C.B. \n11 “Students with disabilities” refers to those eligible for an IEP under the IDEA. Claimant \nhere provides law enforcement referral data disaggregated by IDEA eligibility because \nthe data is only available in this form. But Claimant alleges Respondents discriminate \nagainst all students with disabilities, including those who are not IDEA-eligible.  \nExhibit 1 - page 68\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 69 of 76   Page ID #:69\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 15 of 22 \nB. Respondents fail to maintain and enforce policies and\nprocedures ensuring prompt, accurate reporting of\nrestraints and student injuries to District administrators,\nadditional authorities, and parents, as required by law.\ni. Respondents fail to ensure their respective employees\ncomply with the deficient reporting policies and\nprocedures already in place\nThe excessive use of physical restraints and seclusion that SROs and \nCSOs used on C.B. and on similarly situated students with disabilities in \nthe District often remains in the shadows. The District’s staff systematically \nfail to comply with internal documentation and notification policies for police \nincidents, which include incidents involving SROs.  \nFor example, existing District and SELPA policy – Administrative \nRegulation 5145.11 – mandates that administrators attempt to contact the \nparent before allowing law enforcement to question a student and before \nremoving a student from campus. Yet here, District administrators failed to \ncontact C.B.’s parents before police questioned or attempted to remove \nhim in any of the incidents described above.  \nFurther, existing District and SELPA policies require school staff to \nimmediately notify the Superintendent and to create a written report when \npolice take a student into custody. SELPA policy also requires District staff \nto create written Incident Reports after using physical interventions on a \nstudent. Each District staff member involved in the restraint must complete \na separate Incident Report and the school site administrator must review \nand forward them to the District’s Special Education Director. Yet the \nDistrict has not produced any Incident Reports for any of incidents \ndescribed above, demonstrating the District’s defective practices.  \nAs was the case with C.B., District staff frequently fail to timely notify \nparents, or notify them at all, when school police question, restrain, \nhandcuff, assault, or arrest their children. The District also fails to \nadequately document, report, or investigate these acts of abuse, and fails \nto take reasonable steps to prevent further abuse. When students with \ndisabilities struggle to communicate experiences, especially traumatic \nones, to parents or trusted adults, as was the case with C.B., these \nExhibit 1 - page 69\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 70 of 76   Page ID #:70\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 16 of 22 \ncaregivers are often unaware that their children have experienced any \ninteraction with police at all.  \nSimilarly, the Department’s SROs fail to adequately document incidents of \nrestraint involving MVUSD students. In a 2016 directive to all personnel, \nthe Department instructed officers to create body camera recordings of \n“any law enforcement action where there is reason to believe it would be \nappropriate and valuable to record the event.” This includes citizen \ncontacts and detentions. If an officer fails to initiate the recording of an \nevent when required, the officer must document the reasons for the failure \nin a report or memorandum. Officers may not terminate the body camera \nrecording until the encounter ends. Even at rare times when “tactical or \npractical reasons” necessitate temporarily pausing body camera footage, \nthe officer must reinitiate the recording as soon as possible. The officer \nmust then document the reasons for stopping their body camera in a report. \nAs was the case with C.B., SROs frequently fail to create police reports, fail \nto record incidents on their body cameras, and fail to document the reasons \nfor turning off their body cameras in incidents involving MVUSD students.  \nRespondents’ current policies and/or practices create little to no \ndocumentation regarding student injuries, handcuffing, and/or use of \nrestraints. As a result, parents of students with disabilities like C.B.’s cannot \nobtain adequate information about the cause of injuries suffered while at \nschool. Respondents have discriminated against C.B. and other similarly \nsituated students with disabilities and students of color by failing to create, \nfollow, and implement appropriate policies and procedures regarding \ndocumentation of student injuries, handcuffing, and/or use of restraints. \nii. The District violated the Child Abuse and Neglect\nReporting Act and other laws, by failing to report abuse\nagainst Claimant to the proper authorities.\nIn addition to not complying with its own deficient polices, the District and \nits employees violated their duties as mandated reporters by failing to \nreport the abuse of C.B. to the proper authorities. On information and \nbelief, at no point did any of the District employees who witnessed the \nhandcuffing incidents detailed above report this abuse of C.B. to the proper \nauthorities as required by state law.  \nExhibit 1 - page 70\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 71 of 76   Page ID #:71\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 17 of 22 \nOne such state law is the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act \n(“CANRA”), which requires certain “mandated reporters,” including \nteachers, teacher’s and instructional aids, and employees of an \norganization whose duties require direct contact and supervision of \nchildren, to exercise vigilance in identifying and reporting known or \nreasonably suspected instances of abuse.  Cal. Penal Code §§ 11164, \n11165.7, 11166.  Under CANRA, “abuse” includes “physical injury . . . \ninflicted upon a child by another person by other than accidental means . . . \nunlawful corporal punishment or injury . . . the willful harming or injuring of a \nchild or the endangering of the person or health of a child.”  Id. § 11165.5.   \nFurther, under CANRA, “the willful harming or injuring of a child or the \nendangering of the person or health of a child, means a situation in which \nany person willfully causes or permits any child to suffer, or inflicts thereon, \nunjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering, or having the care or custody \nof any child, willfully causes the person or health of the child to be placed in \na situation in which his or her person or health is endangered.”  Id. \n§ 11165.3. “The intent and purpose of [CANRA] is to protect children from \nabuse and neglect.”  Id. § 11164.\nThe school police officers’ use of physical and mechanical restraint on \nClaimant during the fall of 2019 met the standard for abuse under CANRA. \nBy failing to report this abuse to the proper authorities, the District and its \nemployees violated the spirit and letter of this law.  \nC. Respondents fail to provide adequate structure,\nsupervision, oversight, and training of employees to\nensure that students with disabilities like C.B. are not\ninjured, and that any injuries are quickly identified,\ninvestigated, and prevented in the future.\nRespondents do not provide officers (through their SRO program) or their \nemployees (through their CSO program or otherwise) or staff with adequate \ntraining – or any training at all – to work with students with disabilities. For \nexample, the nine SROs and dozens of CSOs patrolling MVUSD campuses \nfrequently and disproportionately subject students with disabilities, and \nBlack students with disabilities in particular, to handcuffing, physical \nrestraint, campus removal, arrest, and involuntary hospitalization for \ndisability-related behaviors. They use these traumatic practices to punish \nExhibit 1 - page 71\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 72 of 76   Page ID #:72\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 18 of 22 \nminor misconduct typical for school-age children and disability-related \nbehaviors, regardless of whether the behavior poses an imminent danger \nof physical harm to anyone. \nAccording to the District’s job description,12 CSOs “supervise,” “monitor,” \nand “control” school campuses and “enforce[] the rules and regulations \ngoverning student behavior.” They are expected to “physically restrain[] \npersons involved in crimes, fights, or other acts of violence,” and are \ntrained to use, among other things, Tasers and pepper spray.  \nDespite requiring these duties of its officers, the District’s CSO Program \nhas no written policies and/or procedures to communicate boundaries, \nguidelines, and best practices for staff. While providing training on the use \nof pepper spray and use of Tasers, the District provides no training \nregarding working with students with disabilities, de-escalation, or crisis \ncommunication. Instead, on information and belief, Director of Safety and \nSecurity Darryl Scott issues only verbal commands and guidelines to the \nCSOs. Also, on information and belief, Director Scott fails to investigate \nand discipline CSOs who use physical force on students, including students \nwith disabilities.  \nIn addition to the CSO program, the District established its SRO program \nthrough a Law Enforcement Services Agreement with the Riverside County \nSheriff’s Department. These SROs are sworn law enforcement officers \nwhose duties broadly include patrolling MVUSD campuses, investigating \ncrimes that occur on District grounds, facilitating conversations between \nstudents and their parents, and serving as a liaison at elementary school \nsites. The Law Enforcement Services Agreement, which governs the \nrelationship between the District and Department, does not prohibit SROs \nfrom intervening in minor school discipline incidents. It does not outline \nwhen they may use restraints or handcuffs. It does not describe applicable \nlegal protections for students with disabilities, including the requirement to \nprovide reasonable accommodations in police encounters.  \n12 MVUSD Human Resources Division, Position Title: Campus Security Officer I (Oct. \n17, 2017), available at: https://4.files.edl.io/af25/09/04/18/173822-651104c9-971a-47b6-\nba39-362fd1900e5b.pdf (last accessed July 13, 2020).   \nExhibit 1 - page 72\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 73 of 76   Page ID #:73\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 19 of 22 \nFurther, on information and belief, the Department does not have any \ntraining or policies on interacting with students with disabilities. For \nexample, based on information and belief, in fall 2019, the Department \nverbally ordered SROs to arrest any MVUSD student accused of on-\ncampus fighting, without exception. This order will likely disproportionately \naffect students with disabilities, including students of color with disabilities. \nThere is a fundamental flaw in the content and delivery of training by \nRespondents that requires, inter alia, system-wide fixes to appropriately \naccommodate students with disabilities and students of color to avoid \ndiscriminating against them, and to ensure that staff are properly trained to \nsupervise students’ behavior. As a result of these failures, Respondents \nhave discriminated against C.B. on the basis of his disability and race. \nVI. General Description of the Indebtedness, Obligation, Injury,\nDamage, or Loss Incurred\nRespondents have violated multiple federal and state laws, including but \nnot limited to: Title II of the ADA (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131, et seq.); Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794); Section 1983 (42 U.S.C. § \n1983); California Government Code Section 11135; California Disabled \nPersons Act (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 54.1 et seq.); California Education Code \nSection 220; California Education Code Section 234 et seq.; California \nEducation Code Section 38000 et seq.; California Education Code Section \n44807; California Education Code Section 49000 et seq.; California’s Unruh \nCivil Rights Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 51, et seq.); California’s Bane Act (Cal. \nCiv. Code § 52.1); California’s Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act (Cal. \nPenal Code §§ 11164 et seq.); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d, et seq.); U.S. Constitution; California Constitution; \nintentional torts; non-intentional torts; assault; battery; excessive force; \nunreasonable search and seizures; violations of substantive and procedural \ndue process; false arrest and imprisonment; intentional infliction of \nemotional distress; negligent infliction of emotional distress; negligence; \nnegligent supervision; invidious discrimination; non-invidious discrimination; \nvicarious liability; non-vicarious liability; discrimination against students with \ndisabilities and students of color like C.B. with respect to law enforcement \nreferrals that result in adverse disparate impact on students of color and \nstudents with disabilities; and all other legal theories that may apply. The \nforegoing list of legal claims is intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. \nExhibit 1 - page 73\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 74 of 76   Page ID #:74\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 20 of 22 \nAs a direct and proximate result of Respondents’ actions and omissions \ndescribed above, C.B. has experienced extreme emotional and physical \ninjuries and loss of his civil rights. C.B. claims damages for his physical and \nemotional injuries, punitive damages against the involved individuals, \nstatutory damages as appropriate, and attorneys’ fees and costs. C.B. has \nbeen and continues to be unlawfully excluded and denied meaningful \naccess to the programs, services, and activities offered by Respondents as \na result of the handcuffing incidents and Respondents’ unlawful policies \nand practices regarding the management of student behavior, including the \nSRO and CSO programs. Further, as a result of these practices, policies \nand/or failure to train and supervise staff, students with disabilities and \nstudents of color are being systemically excluded from equal access to a \npublic education and denied their right to full and equal access to, and use \nand enjoyment of, the facilities, programs, services and activities of \nRespondents as required by law. \nAdditionally, C.B. has been and continues to be excluded and deprived \nfrom having meaningful access to the programs, services and activities \noffered by Respondents based on Respondents’ failure to modify their \npolicies and procedures with respect to their law enforcement referrals and \nuse of SROs and CSOs. As Respondents’ discriminatory acts and \nomissions as herein alleged are ongoing, they constitute a continuing \nviolation of C.B.’s rights, for which Respondents are liable. \nAdditionally, C.B. contends, based on the foregoing, that Respondents \nincluding the District, the SELPA, the Department, the County, the City, and \ntheir employees and agents, acting under color of law and within the course \nand scope of their employment, subjected him to various common-law and \nstatutory torts, including but not limited to those described above, all of \nwhich subject the District, the SELPA, the Department, and the County and \nthe involved employees to personal and vicarious liability. \nVII. The Names of the Public Employees Causing the Injury,\nDamage, or Loss\nAs of the date of presentation of this claim, Claimant believes that the \nDistrict, the SELPA, the County, the Department, the City and their \nrespective current and former employees and agents of the same have \ncaused injury, damage, and loss. These employees and agents include but \nExhibit 1 - page 74\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 75 of 76   Page ID #:75\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 21 of 22 \nare not limited to: Superintendent Martinrex Kedziora, Director of Safety \nand Security Darryl Scott, Special Education Director Jason Ramirez, CSO \nDemetrius Owens, CSO King (first name unknown), former Landmark MS \nPrincipal Scott Walker, former Landmark MS Assistant Principal Kamilah \nO’Connor, former Landmark MS Assistant Principal Pedro Gutierrez, \nSchool Psychologist David Satre, Mr. Scarefone, former Landmark MS \nteacher Mr. Proprofsky, CSO Manuel Arellano, Josh (campus supervisor \ninvolved in October 8, 2019, incident, last name unknown), unknown \nfemale campus supervisor (involved in October 8, 2019, incident), \nLandmark MS Interim Administrator Penny Macon, CSO Kristopher \nWoodside, CSO Juan Ramirez, CSO Christopher Hill, Mountain View MS \nPrincipal Jon Black, Sheriff Chad Bianco, Deputy Norma Loza, and Deputy \nToscano (SRO, first name unknown), as well as all unknown persons \nresponsible for formulating the aforementioned illegal policies and \npractices, all unknown persons responsible for failing to modify said illegal \npolicies and practices to prevent discrimination, and all unknown persons \nresponsible for implementing the aforementioned illegal policies and \npractices.  \nClaimant further asserts that this is not an exhaustive list of the employees \nwho have caused his injury, damage, and loss. There are likely other \nwitnesses, although Claimant does not currently have those names. \nClaimant reserves the right to augment this list if and when he identifies \nother employees responsible for the injury, damage, and loss. \nVIII.  The Amount Claimed\nC.B. claims damages for his physical and emotional injuries, punitive \ndamages against the involved individuals, statutory damages as \nappropriate, and attorneys’ fees and costs. The amount of damages \nclaimed exceeds the jurisdiction for a limited civil case in state court.\nClaimant also seeks non-monetary declaratory and injunctive relief \nregarding Respondents’ school police officer programs.  \nClaimant supports the Moreno Valley community’s call for the District \nSchool Board to cut ties with the Riverside Sheriff Department’s SRO \nprogram. But should the Board not heed this call, Claimant maintains that \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief is necessary to prevent school police \nExhibit 1 - page 75\n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 1   Filed 02/02/21   Page 76 of 76   Page ID #:76\nStudent C.B.’s Claim for Damages \nJuly 15, 2020 \nPage 22 of 22 \nofficers from continuing their unlawful and systemic physical and \nmechanical restraint practices.   \nIX. Application for Late Claim\nTo the extent the District considers any part of this claim to be late filed, \nplease consider this an application for late filing. The District must grant a \ntimely application for leave to file a late claim if either: (1) the Claimant \nfailed to present the claim as a result of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or \nexcusable neglect,” and the public entity was not prejudiced by the failure \nto file the claim within the time allowed by California Government Code \nSection 911.2; or (2) the Claimant was a minor throughout the time \nallowed for filing such claims. E.M. v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 194 \nCal.App.4th 736, 746 (2011). \nHere, C.B. has been a minor throughout the entire time period. Thus, any \nclaims accrued are subject to the mandatory granting of leave for a late \nclaim. See E.M., 194 Cal.App.4th at 746. Moreover, as an eleven-year-old \nchild, C.B. was unaware of the tort claim requirement during the earlier \nperiod of the violations at issue. \nX.

Substantial reduction of the number of removals and the\n1 \ndisproportionate rates of removal of disabled students and\n2 \nBlack disabled students;\n3 \niii. Substantial reduction in the number of incidents involving\n4 \nrestraints and the disproportionate rates of use of restraints on\n5 \ndisabled students and Black disabled students;\n6 \niv. Substantial increase in the behavioral supports and\n7 \nassessments6 offered to students with disabilities to address\n8 \ndisability-related behaviors, such as Behavior Intervention\n9 \nPlans7; and\n10\nv.

The Independent Monitor’s four-year term may be\n7 \nextended as follows:\n8 \na. Stipulated Extension of Compliance Period: Six months prior to the\n9 \nconclusion of the Independent Monitor’s four-year term, the Parties\n10\nshall stipulate to extending the Independent Monitor’s term and the\n11\nterms of this agreement only if the Independent Monitor determines\n12\nthat MVUSD (i) will fail to meet the requirements of the Action Plan\n13\nby the end of the four-year term; (ii) cannot continue implementation\n14\nof the outcomes and systems change without the presence of a\n15\n16 monitor; and /or (iii) causes delay in implementation of the Action\n17 Plan for failure to adhere to the terms of this agreement and/or failure\n18 to cooperate with the Independent Monitor. Two months before the\n19 expiration of the Independent Monitor’s term, the Parties shall jointly\n20 file with the Court a Notice to extend the Independent Monitor’s\n21 Term and the terms of this agreement for a period of time necessary\n22 to ensure either compliance with the Action Plan or make up for the\n23 lost time.\n24 b.

The Parties shall then \n1 \nsubmit the Dispute to the selected mediator within thirty (30) days of \n2 \nmeeting and conferring, who shall have the authority to assist the \n3 \nParties in resolving the Dispute, but shall not have the authority to \n4 \ndirect any Party to take or refrain from taking any action or to render \n5 \ndecisions. The mediation shall be held and completed within forty-\n6 \nfive (45) calendar days of submission unless the mediator’s calendar \n7 \nwill not allow for such scheduling. In such instance, the mediation \n8 \nshall be scheduled as soon as practicable.\n9 \nc. Motion to Enforce: If a Party fails to meet and confer or if the Parties\n10\nare unable to resolve the dispute through the mediation process\n11\ndescribed above, any Party may seek enforcement of the Court’s\n12\nOrder and Permanent Injunction by motion to the Court.

C.B. \nattended Landmark Middle School (“Landmark”) and Mountain View Middle School \n(“Mountain View”), both located within the District.  (Id. ¶ 16.)  At the time of the incidents at \nissue, C.B. was between ten and eleven years old, approximately seventy pounds, and in the sixth \ngrade.  (Id. ¶ 13.)  C.B. has diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) \nand Oppositional Defiant Disorder (“ODD”), but his parents suspect that he may have \nadditional undiagnosed emotional and behavioral issues.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  C.B. received special \neducation services during the relevant period.  (Id.)    \n \nPage 2 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 3 of 19   Page ID #:696\nThis action concerns four incidents where C.B. was handcuffed by Campus Security \nOfficers (“CSOs”) and School Resource Officers (“SROs”) over the course of four months.   \n \nA. August 21, 2019 Incident  \n \nSchool police officers first handcuffed C.B. on August 21, 2019, while he was a student at \nLandmark School.  (Id. ¶ 73.)  Assistant Principal Pedro Gutierrez called C.B.’s mother, B.T., to \nask her to pick him up from school because he was “acting up.”  (Id. ¶ 74.)  When she arrived, \nGutierrez informed her that school police officers had handcuffed C.B., but the handcuffs were \nremoved before she arrived.  (Id. ¶ 75.)  Gutierrez told B.T. that he instructed officers to remove \nthe handcuffs because he believed that handcuffing C.B. was “totally unacceptable,” or words to \nthat effect.  (Id.)  The District did not document the mechanical restraint in an Incident Report.  \n(Id. ¶ 76.)  \n \nB.  August 26, 2019 Incident  \n \nOn August 26, 219, District CSOs handcuffed and leg-cuffed C.B. at Landmark School.  \n(Id. ¶ 78.)  Gutierrez directed Defendant CSO Owens to bring C.B. to the office for a meeting, \nspurred by C.B.’s alleged class disruption by cursing and ripping paper.  (Id. ¶ 79.)   CSOs Owens \nand King and Assistant Principal Kamilah O’Connor found C.B. on the playground and directed \nhim to go to the office.  (Id. ¶ 80.)  C.B. refused and allegedly clenched his fists and began \nbreathing heavily.  (Id.)  CSOs Owens and King dragged C.B. by his arms to a seclusion room.  \n(Id.)   \nPrincipal Scott Walker joined CSOs Owens and King in the seclusion room, surrounding \nC.B.  (Id. ¶ 81.)  C.B. began pulling away, pushing, and swinging with his arms to try to free \nhimself from the room.  (Id.)  Principal Walker directed CSOs King and Owens to handcuff C.B., \nwho was four feet, eight inches tall and approximately seventy pounds.  (Id. ¶ 82.)  The CSOs \nplaced C.B. in a physical hold, tackled him, and forced him into metal cuffs.  (Id.)  The CSOs \nthen pulled C.B. up from the ground and attempted to sit him in a chair.  (Id.)  C.B. became more \nupset and began flailing his legs.  (Id.)  \nPrincipal Walker then directed the CSOs to place separate handcuffs on C.B.’s ankles.  (Id. \n¶ 83.)  The CSOs did so, and C.B. remained with his hands and ankles shackled for an unknown \nperiod of time.  (Id.)   \nThe District suspended C.B. from school that day.  (Id. ¶ 84.)  When his aunt went to pick \nhim up, she found him sitting in a fetal position against the wall of the seclusion room, without a \nshirt, and with a desk blocking the door.  (Id.)  The District did not provide an Incident Report to \nC.B.’s parents.  (Id.)  \n \n// \n// \nPage 3 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 4 of 19   Page ID #:697\nC. October 8, 2019 Incident  \nOn October 7, 2019, C.B. allegedly threw a rock in the general direction of CSO Manuel \nArellano.  (Id. ¶ 89.)  The District did not inform C.B.’s parents about the incident on that day, \nbut it requested that Deputy Norma Loza intervene and investigate the alleged incident.  (Id.)   \nOn October 8, 2019, Deputy Loza and CSO Arellano went to C.B.’s special education \nclassroom to investigate the alleged incident from the day before.  (Id. ¶ 90.)  Loza’s body camera \npartially captured this interaction.  (Id. ¶ 91; Ex. 2 (Body camera footage).)  Immediately upon \nentering the classroom, Loza directed the teacher to remove other students from the classroom.  \n(Id. ¶ 92.)  C.B. sat motionless at his desk with his head down.  (Id.)  Loza told C.B., “You’re \ngoing to go to the office, no matter what.  Either you go, cooperating, or I’m going to take you to \nthe office.”  (Id. ¶ 93.)  Neither Loza nor Arellano explained why they were asking C.B. to go to \nthe office.  (Id.)  C.B. kept his head down and replied that he was not going.  (Id.) \n  After less than ninety seconds, Loza grabbed C.B.’s sweatshirt, pulled him out of his seat, \nand passed him over to Arellano.  (Id. ¶ 94.)  Arellano twisted C.B.’s wrists behind his back to try \nto place handcuffs on him, while Loza repeated, “You are going to the office.”  (Id.)  C.B. swore \nand stated that he was not going.  (Id.)  Loza and Arellano then tackled C.B., pinned him to the \nground, and pressed him face down into the floor.  (Id.)  Arellano then dug his knee into C.B.’s \nback, while Loza placed him in handcuffs.  (Id.)  Loza also stated that if C.B. moved, the \nhandcuffs were “going to get tight on [him].”  (Id. ¶ 95.)  Loza and Arellano then pulled C.B. to \nhis feet and pushed him towards the classroom door, while he squirmed and cried to be let go.  \n(Id. ¶ 96.)  The officers then forced C.B. down onto the floor.  (Id.)  A second CSO arrived, and \nthe officers surrounded and held C.B. face-down on the floor for almost two minutes.  (Id. ¶ 97.)  \nC.B. was then pulled up to a seated position, with Arellano pressing down on his shoulders, and \nthe second CSO twisting his leg.  (Id.)  C.B. cried, “Let me go! Let me go!”  The CSOs repeated, \n“If you calm down, we calm down.”  (Id. ¶ 98.)  \n  C.B. remained restrained for at least two more minutes.  (Id. ¶¶ 98-100.)  Loza and her \npartner, Deputy Toscano, later placed C.B. in the back of a police car.  (Id. ¶ 101.)  While locked \nin the back seat, C.B. reportedly stated, “I wish I was dead.”  (Id.)  C.B. remained in the back of \nthe police car for nearly an hour before the ambulance arrived, during which time students \npassing by saw him.  (Id.)  An ambulance took C.B. to Riverside’s Emergency Treatment Service \n(“ETS”) facility for a 5585 evaluation, and he was discharged that afternoon.  (Id. ¶ 103.)   \n  After the incident, C.B.’s parents were afraid for his safety and did not want him to return \nto the same school.  (Id. ¶ 109.)  After staying at home for approximately five weeks, C.B. \ntransferred to Mountain View.  (Id. ¶ 110.) \nD.  December 9, 2019 Incident  \n  Shortly after starting at Mountain View, on December 9, 2019, Deputy Loza handcuffed \nC.B. again.  (Id. ¶ 111.)  C.B. allegedly pulled a classmate’s chair out from under him, the \nclassmate shoved C.B., and they then pushed each other.  (Id.)  After C.B.’s teacher intervened \nPage 4 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 5 of 19   Page ID #:698\nto break it up, C.B. pushed his teacher and began to throw classroom items.  (Id.)  The teacher \ncleared the room and called for CSOs and SROs.  (Id. ¶ 112.)   \nCSOs Juan Ramirez and Kristopher Woodside arrived first and, almost immediately, \nphysically restrained C.B. on the ground.  (Id.)  Deputy Loza arrived about fifteen minutes later, \nwhile CSOs Ramirez and Woodside were still physically restraining C.B.  (Id. ¶ 113.)  Deputy \nLoza then handcuffed C.B. and transported him to the Moreno Valley Police Station.  (Id. ¶ 114.)  \nThere, Loza referred C.B. to the ETS Center for a 5585 evaluation and requested an ambulance \ntransport.  (Id.)  C.B.’s mother arrived before the ambulance and asked to take her son home, but \nLoza refused.  (Id.)  As an ambulance transported C.B. to the ETS Center, he was restrained to \nthe gurney during the ride.  (Id. ¶ 115.)  He was discharged and reunited with his mother hours \nlater.  (Id.)   \n  The District later initiated expulsion proceedings against C.B. based on the incident with \nhis classmate at Mountain View.  (Id. ¶ 116.)  On December 20, 2019, the Individualized \nEducation Program (“IEP”) team met for a Manifestation Determination Review.  (Id.)  The IEP \nteam determined that C.B.’s behaviors were caused by his disabilities (including ADHD and \nODD), and nullified the pending expulsion charges.  (Id.)   \n \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n \nDefendants move to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6) (“Rule 12(b)(6)”).  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the claims \nasserted in a complaint.  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the complaint \nlacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.”  \nMendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).  Factual \nallegations must be enough to “raise a right to relief above a speculative level.”  Bell Atlantic \nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  \n \nRule 12(b)(6) must be read in conjunction with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), \nwhich requires a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that a pleader is entitled to \nrelief,” in order to give the defendant “fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon \nwhich it rests.”  Id.; see Horosny v. Burlington Coat Factory, Inc., 2015 WL 12532178, at *3 \n(C.D. Cal. Oct. 26, 2015).  In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court must accept \nall material allegations in the complaint — as well as any reasonable inferences to be drawn from \nthem — as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See Doe \nv. United States, 419 F.3d 1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 2005); ARC Ecology v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, \n411 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 2005); Moyo v. Gomez, 32 F.3d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir. 1994).  \nDetermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is “a context-specific task that \nrequires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  \n \n“While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed \nfactual allegations, a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the ‘grounds’ of his ‘entitlement to relief’ \nrequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \nPage 5 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 6 of 19   Page ID #:699\naction will not do.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitted).  Rather, the allegations in the \ncomplaint “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Id.    \n \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 provides that leave to amend “shall be freely given \nwhen justice so requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).  The Ninth Circuit has held that “‘[t]his policy \nis to be applied with extreme liberality.’”  Eminence Capital, L.L.C. v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d \n1048, 1051 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Owens v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712 \n(9th Cir. 2001)).  Generally, a “district court should grant leave to amend even if no request to \namend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured \nby allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \n \nIV.  DISCUSSION \n \nA. County Defendants  \n \nCounty Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims, 1 arguing that (1) the Sheriff’s \nDepartment and Sheriff are redundant defendants; (2) Deputy Loza is entitled to qualified and \ndiscretionary act immunity; (3) the municipal entities are also entitled to immunity; and (4) the \nclaims fail on the merits.  For the reasons established below, the Court agrees in part and \ndisagrees in part.  \n \n1.  Redundant Defendants  \n \nCounty Defendants first seek to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against the Sheriff’s \nDepartment and Sheriff Bianco in his official capacity, arguing that they are redundant \ndefendants.  (County MTD at 3.)  Plaintiff counters that the County and the Sheriff’s \nDepartment are separate suable entities under Section 1983.  (County Opp’n at 2-3.)  The Court \nagrees.  “[I]f both a county and a county sheriff’s department are amenable to suit, they may both \nbe named in a single action.”  Hurth v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 2009 WL 10696491, at *5 (C.D. Cal. \nOct. 28, 2009) (citing Streit v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 236 F.3d 552 (9th Cir. 2001)).  Indeed, \n“there simply is no rule of law requiring a court to dismiss a municipal entity as duplicative, \nredundant, or unnecessary defendant in cases where the municipality itself is named.”  Id.  The \nCourt therefore DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to the Sheriff’s Department.  \n \nAs to Sheriff Bianco, Plaintiff argues that he is also a proper defendant, as he is a “classic \nEx Parte Young defendant” against whom C.B. can obtain injunctive relief.  (County Opp’n at 3 \n(citing Hurth, 2009 WL 10696941, at *4).)  The Ninth Circuit has held that “[w]hen a municipal \nofficer and a local government entity are named, and the officer is named only in an official \n \n1 Plaintiff asserts Claims 1 (unreasonable seizure and excessive force), 2 (Monell liability), \n3 (ADA violations), 4 (Rehabilitation Act violations), 5 (race and disability discrimination), 8 \n(intentional infliction of emotional distress), 9 (false imprisonment), 10 (battery), and 11 (assault) \nagainst Deputy Loza, the County, the Sheriff’s Department, and/or the Sheriff.   \nPage 6 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 7 of 19   Page ID #:700\ncapacity, the court may dismiss the officer as a redundant defendant.”  Ctr. for Bio-Ethical \nReform, Inc. v. L.A. Cty. Sheriff Dep’t, 533 F.3d 780, 799 (9th Cir. 2008).  That is because “[a]n \nofficial-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.”  \nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166 (1985).  Here, Sheriff Bianco is only sued in his official \ncapacity, and the governmental entities (the County and the Sheriff’s Department) are both \nrepresented in this suit.  While the Court recognizes that striking or dismissal of redundant \ndefendants is not mandatory, to avoid confusion and superfluity, the Court GRANTS County \nDefendants’ Motion as to Defendant Bianco.  \n \n2.  Immunity  \n \nCounty Defendants next argue that they are entitled to discretionary act immunity and \nqualified immunity.  For the reasons described below, the Court disagrees.  \n \na.  Discretionary Act Immunity  \n \nCounty Defendants argue that Deputy Loza is immune from liability for the discretionary \nacts related to detaining C.B. and referring him for a mental health evaluation under Cal. Welf. & \nInst. Code (“Cal. WIC”) Section 5585. \n \nA public employee can be held liable for an injury caused by their act or omission “to the \nsame extent as a private person.”  Cal. Gov’t Code § 820.  When that public employee’s act or \nomission occurs in the scope of their employment, the public entity that employs them can be \nheld vicariously liable for the injury.  Id. at § 815.2.  However, “a public employee is not liable for \nan injury resulting from [their] act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the \nexercise of the discretion vested in [them], whether or not such discretion be abused.”  Id. at § \n820.2.  Moreover, “a public entity is not liable for an injury resulting from an act or omission of \nan employee of the public entity where the employee is immune from liability.”  Id. at § 815.2(b).   \n \n  In addition, Cal. WIC Section 5278 provides that individuals authorized “to detain a \nperson for 72-hour treatment and evaluation … shall not be held either criminally or civilly liable \nfor exercising this authority in accordance with the law.”  This immunity may extend to assault \nand battery, false arrest, illegal imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and \nracial discrimination claims under California law.  Bias v. Moynihan, 508 F.3d 1212, 1221 (9th \nCir. 2007).  Accordingly, if Deputy Loza is entitled to immunity, the County and the Sheriff’s \nDepartment argue they are also entitled to immunity under Cal. Gov’t Code Section 820.2.  \n(County MTD at 15-16.)   \n \nHowever, discretionary act immunity is construed “as narrowly as possible,” and \n“government defendants have the burden of establishing that they are entitled to immunity for an \nactual policy decision made by an employee who ‘consciously balanc[ed] risks and \nadvantages…”  A.E. ex rel. Hernandez v. Cty. of Tulare, 666 F.3d 631, 639-40 (9th Cir. 2012).  \nCounty Defendants fail to meet this burden.  Moreover, Section 820.2 “does not shield from \nliability government employees who use excessive force in carrying out their duties.”  Rodriguez \nPage 7 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 8 of 19   Page ID #:701\nv. Cty. of Los Angeles, 891 F.3d 776, 799 (9th Cir. 2018); see also Blankenhorn v. City of Orange, \n485 F.3d 463, 487 (9th Cir. 2007) (“[I]t has long been established that this provision does not \napply to officers who use unreasonable force in making an arrest.”).  Nor can County Defendants \nclaim immunity from Plaintiff’s false imprisonment claims, Robinson v. Solano Cty., 278 F.3d \n1007, 1016 (9th Cir. 2002) (“Public employees are similarly not entitled to immunity in suits for \nfalse arrest or false imprisonment.”); Cal. Gov’t Code § 820.4 (“[N]othing in this section \nexonerates a public employee from liability for … false imprisonment.”), or for discrimination \nagainst Plaintiff, C.N. v. Wolf, 410 F. Supp. 2d 894, 902 (C.D. Cal. 2005).  The Court therefore \nrejects County Defendants’ assertion of discretionary act immunity as to Plaintiff’s false \nimprisonment, discrimination, and excessive force claims, as well as to the “remaining state law \nclaims aris[ing] from the alleged use of force during [C.B.’s detention].”  Blankenhorn, 485 F.3d \nat 487.   \n \nDeputy Loza’s immunity claim under Cal. WIC Section 5278 also fails.  “The scope of § \n5278 immunity … is not as all-encompassing as the defendants argue.”  Sheehan v. City & Cty. \nof San Francisco, 743 F.3d 1211, 1233 (9th Cir. 2014), rev’d in part, cert. dismissed in part sub \nnom. City & Cty. of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.S. 600, 135 S. Ct. 1765 (2015).  Rather, it \nonly “extends to claims based on circumstances that are inherent in an involuntary detention….”  \nId. (quoting Jacobs v. Grossmont Hospital, 108 Cal. App. 4th 69 (2003)) (emphasis in original).  \nIt only applies where “authority for such detention is exercised in accordance with the law.”  \nFarmer v. Cty. of Calaveras, 2018 WL 1919900, at *5 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 24, 2018) (emphasis in \noriginal).  Thus, Section 5278 “does not immunize the officers if they were negligent in executing \nthe detention[,]” for example.  Sheehan, 743 F.3d at 1234.   \n \nPlaintiff’s claims against Deputy Loza concern allegedly unlawful force, which is certainly \nnot an “inherent attribute” of a psychiatric hold.  As Plaintiff points out, Loza’s allegedly \ntortious acts began well before she initiated the involuntary holds, and her interventions with \nC.B. were spurred by investigations for alleged discipline infractions.  (County Opp’n at 14; \nCompl. ¶¶ 94-103, 113-115.)  Plaintiff alleges that Loza used unlawful force shortly after \nintervening with C.B., and that as a result of Loza’s actions, he experienced worsening trauma.  \n(See Compl. ¶ 101.)  Taking Plaintiff’s allegations to be true and construing reasonable inferences \nin his favor, as the Court must do at this stage, the Court finds that Section 5278 immunity does \nnot apply here.  \n \nBecause the Court finds that Deputy Loza is not entitled to discretionary act immunity, \nthe public entity that employs her can be held vicariously liable for Plaintiff’s alleged injuries.  \nCal. Gov. Code § 815.2.  The Court therefore DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to the \ndiscretionary act immunity.  \n   \nb.  Qualified Immunity  \n \nCounty Defendants next argue that Loza is entitled to qualified immunity.  The doctrine \nof qualified immunity protects government officials “from liability for civil damages insofar as \ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a \nPage 8 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 9 of 19   Page ID #:702\nreasonable person would have known.”  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) \n(quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  An officer will be denied qualified \nimmunity if (1) taking the alleged facts in the light most favorable to the party asserting injury, the \nofficer committed a constitutional violation, and (2) the officer’s specific conduct violated \n“clearly established” federal law at the time of the alleged misconduct such that a reasonable \nofficer would have understood the conduct to be unlawful.  Torres v. City of Madera, 648 F.3d \n1119, 1123 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201–02 (2001)).   \n \nFirst, as detailed in section A.3. below, the allegations in the Complaint sufficiently state a \nclaim that Deputy Loza’s use of force was excessive and unreasonable in violation of Plaintiff’s \nFourth Amendment rights.  Second, the Ninth Circuit has recognized as “clearly established” \nlaw that “police use of force in response to school-related incidents ha[s] to be reasonable in light \nof the circumstances and not excessively intrusive[,]” and that “police use of force must be \ncarefully calibrated to respond to the particulars of a case, including the wrongdoing at issue, the \nsafety threat posed by the suspect, and the risk of flight.”  C.B. v. City of Sonora, 769 F.3d 1005, \n1030 (9th Cir. 2014).  Thus, in C.B. v. Sonora, the Ninth Circuit held that applying handcuffs to \nan eleven-year-old student and keeping him in handcuffs for approximately thirty minutes was an \n“obvious violation” of these clearly established standards.  Id.  Accepting Plaintiff’s factually \nsimilar allegations as true, the Court finds that Deputy Loza’s actions were also an “obvious \nviolation” of clearly established standards.  Thus, Deputy Loza is not entitled to qualified \nimmunity.  The Court DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to qualified immunity.   \n   \nHaving found that none of the County Defendants are entitled to immunity from liability, \nthe Court considers the sufficiency of the allegations against County Defendants.   \n \n3.  Unreasonable Seizure and Excessive Force (Claim One)  \n \nThe Fourth Amendment, which applies to the states through the Fourteenth \nAmendment, prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement officials.  U.S. \nConst. amend. IV.  The Fourth Amendment requires the degree of force to be “objectively \nreasonable” under the circumstances.  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989).  Courts \napply an objective inquiry to determine whether excessive force was used.  The \n“reasonableness” of an officer’s particular use of force “must be judged from the perspective of \na reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.”  Id. at 396.  \nThis test considers the “totality of the circumstances,” including “the severity of the crime at \nissue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and \nwhether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.”  Id. \n \na.  October 8, 2019 Event  \n \nPlaintiff alleges that on October 8, 2019, Deputy Loza used excessive force and imposed \nunreasonable seizures on Plaintiff C.B.  The Complaint alleges that while investigating an alleged \nrock throwing incident at C.B.’s school, Deputy Loza pulled C.B. out of his seat, tackled and \npinned him to the ground, handcuffed him, threatened to tighten the handcuffs, and left him \nPage 9 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 10 of 19   Page ID #:703\nhandcuffed in the back of a police car for an extended period of time, among other actions.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 92-97, 100-01.)   \n \nCounty Defendants argue that these allegations are disputed by the body camera footage, \nattached to the Complaint as Exhibit 2.  (County MTD at 6.)  County Defendants seek to \nincorporate by reference additional events and context depicted in the video.  (Id. at 5-6.)  Under \nthe incorporation by reference doctrine, a court may consider material “properly submitted as \npart of the complaint[.]”  Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001).  The \ndoctrine is meant to prevent plaintiffs “from selecting only portions of documents that support \ntheir claims, while omitting portions of those very documents that weaken—or doom—their \nclaims.”  Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 899 F.3d 988, 1002 (9th Cir. 2018).  Defendants \nmay incorporate a document “if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document \nforms the basis of the plaintiff’s claim.”  Id. (quoting United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 907 \n(9th Cir. 2003)).  However, “what inferences a court may draw from an incorporated document \nshould also be approached with caution[,]” as “it is improper to assume the truth of an \nincorporated document if such assumptions only serve to dispute facts in a well-pleaded \ncomplaint.”  Id. at 1003.  The Court agrees that the video exhibit may be incorporated by \nreference.  Nonetheless, after reviewing Exhibit 2, the Court finds that it does not contradict \nPlaintiff’s allegations, nor does it doom his claims.  While County Defendants may dispute \nPlaintiff’s characterization of Deputy Loza’s actions as unreasonable, the video is consistent with \nthe allegations in the Complaint.  Rather than accepting County Defendants’ interpretation of \nportions of the video incorporated by reference to dispute the facts in the Complaint, the Court \nmust take Plaintiff’s allegations as true and construe all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff’s favor.   \n \nCounty Defendants also argue that Deputy Loza’s detention and use of force were \nreasonable, as Plaintiff was resisting and fighting throughout the interaction, and Loza was called \nout to respond to an assault (throwing a rock at CSO Arellano).  (Id.)  The Court disagrees.  \nApplying the Graham totality of the circumstances standard, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that \nDeputy Loza’s actions were unreasonable and excessive.  First, as Plaintiff points out, there was \nno crime, much less a severe crime.  While Defendant refers to the alleged rock throwing incident \nas assault, California law prohibits the prosecution of children under twelve for assault.  See Cal. \nWelf. & Inst. Code § 602.  Thus, C.B., who was under twelve at the time of the incident, could \nnot have been charged with assault.  Even if that were not the case, Deputy Loza allowed one day \nto elapse between the alleged rock throwing and her intervention with C.B., which weighs heavily \nagainst the severity of the “crime.”  (Opp’n at 5.)  Second, Plaintiff was not an immediate safety \nthreat to officers or others’ safety, as the officers were investigating a day-old incident, and at the \ntime of their intervention, Plaintiff was sitting motionless at his desk with his face down.  (Compl. \n¶ 92.)   \n \nIn addition, Plaintiff’s age, stature, and disability all weigh against the officer’s \nreasonableness.  At the time of the event, C.B. was between ten and eleven years old, weighed \napproximately seventy pounds, and had several documented disabilities.  (Compl. ¶ 13.)  He was \nsurrounded by at least two adults at all times, and there is nothing to suggest that he posed a \nsafety threat to warrant being forcibly removed from his seat, pinned to the floor, and handcuffed.  \nPage 10 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 11 of 19   Page ID #:704\nSee C.B. v. City of Sonora, 769 F.3d at 1030 (finding that officers’ decision to handcuff and \ndetain an eighty-pound eleven-year-old was unreasonable).  Even if Plaintiff were unresponsive \nand behaving disrespectfully, “[a]n arrest meant only to ‘teach a lesson’ and arbitrarily punish \nperceived disrespect is clearly unreasonable.”  Scott v. Cty. of San Bernardino, 903 F.3d 943, 950 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (concluding that handcuffing middle school students and transporting them to a \npolice station was unreasonable where there were generalized allegations of fighting and conflict \nand they were perceived to be non-responsive to officer’s questioning).  Nor does any resistance \nby C.B. defeat his claims, as even in the face of verbal and physical aggression, “the type and \namount of force inflicted” may be excessive.  Hayenga ex rel. Hayenga v. Nampa Sch. Dist. No. \n131, 123 F. App’x 783, 786 (9th Cir. 2005).   \n \nb.  December 9, 2019 Event  \n \nPlaintiff alleges that on December 9, 2019, Deputy Loza again used excessive force and \nunreasonably seized Plaintiff when she handcuffed him after he had a disagreement with a \nclassmate, allegedly pushed his teacher, and threw classroom items.  (Compl. ¶ 111.)  Deputy \nLoza handcuffed C.B. as he was physically restrained by CSOs Ramirez and Woodside and \ntransported him to the police station.  (Id. 113.)  Deputy Loza referred him to the ETS Center for \na 5585 evaluation, requested an ambulance transport, and refused his mother’s request to take \nher son home.  (Id.)   \n \nCounty Defendants argue that Deputy Loza’s actions were reasonable, as there was \nreasonable suspicion to detain and probable cause to arrest Plaintiff for assault and battery on \nanother student and his teacher.  Applying the Graham standard discussed above, Plaintiff’s \nallegations support a claim that, under the totality of the circumstances, Deputy Loza’s actions \non December 9, 2019 were also excessive and unreasonable.  In particular, as discussed above, \nCalifornia law prohibits prosecution of children under twelve for assault and battery.  See Cal. \nWelf. & Inst. Code § 602.  Further, there is no indication that Plaintiff was a safety threat to \nwarrant being immediately handcuffed and transferred to the police station.  See C.B., 769 F.3d \nat 1030; Scott, 903 F.3d at 950; Hayenga ex rel. Hayenga, 123 F. App’x at 786.   \n \nTaking Plaintiff’s allegations to be true and construing all inferences in his favor, the \nCourt concludes that Plaintiff sufficiently states a claim for excessive force and unreasonable \nseizure.   The Court DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to Claim One.   \n \n4.  Monell Liability (Claim 2)  \n \nUnder Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690-91 (1978), a municipality cannot \nbe sued under a theory of respondeat superior for injuries inflicted by its employees or agents.    \nRather, municipalities are subject to damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if the plaintiff proves: (1) \nthat a city employee committed the alleged constitutional violation pursuant to a formal \ngovernmental policy or a longstanding practice or custom; (2) that the individual who committed \nthe constitutional tort was an official with final policy-making authority and that the challenged \naction itself thus constituted an act of official governmental policy; or (3) that an official with \nPage 11 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 12 of 19   Page ID #:705\nfinal policy-making authority ratified a subordinate’s unconstitutional decision or action and the \nbasis for it.  Trevino v. Gates, 99 F.3d 911, 918 (9th Cir. 1996) (quoting Gillette v. Delmore, 979 \nF.2d 1342, 1346–47 (9th Cir. 1992)); Price v. Sery, 513 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. 2008).   \n \na.  Express Policy  \n \nFirst, Plaintiff may state a claim for Section 1983 liability based on a formal municipal \npolicy.  Trevino, 99 F.3d at 918.  Plaintiff points to specific Department policies that led to his \nalleged injury.  (Opp’n at 15.)  Sheriff’s Department Policy SRU-003 authorizes SROs to \n“counsel” students who are “about to engage” in criminal conduct, to search students with \n“reasonable suspicion” that the student has violated a school rule, and to “stop, question, \ninterview, and take police action without the prior authorization of the principal.”  (Compl. ¶ \n125.)  Policy SRU-004 authorizes SROs to stop, question, detain, and cite students simply for \nbeing out of class during school hours.  (Id. ¶ 125.)  Moreover, the Sheriff’s Department \nStandards Manual does not require or encourage officers to use crisis communication or other \nnon-violent alternatives to restraint.  (Id. ¶¶ 66-68.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff alleges that Deputy \nLoza went to Plaintiff’s class to investigate a minor incident that occurred a day earlier, and \nwithin minutes handcuffed and detained Plaintiff.  (Compl. ¶¶ 89-90.)  \n \nDefendant mostly disregards these alleged policies, arguing that Plaintiff’s allegation that \nDeputy Loza violated department policies on handcuffing youths defeats a Monell claim based on \nan official policy.  (County MTD at 9.)  That is not the case.  Unlike the County represents, \nMonell does not require a showing that an official was “following a policy that violates \nConstitutional rights.”  (Id.)  Rather, Monell requires a showing that the policies at issue were a \n“moving force behind the constitutional violations.”  Monell, 436 U.S. at 694.  That Loza is \nalleged to have followed some policies while flouting others is not determinative.  Plaintiff \nsufficiently alleges that the County’s policies on SROs’ intervention with students for low-level \nincidents were a “moving force” behind the alleged Fourth Amendment violations.  The Court \ntherefore DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to Plaintiff’s Monell claim based on official \npolicies.  \n   \nb.  Unconstitutional Policy, Practice, or Custom \n \nEven in the absence of an express policy, a municipality’s unconstitutional custom or \npractice “can be inferred from widespread practices or evidence of repeated constitutional \nviolations for which the errant municipal officers were not discharged or reprimanded.”  Hunter \nv. Cty. of Sacramento, 652 F.3d 1225, 1233 (9th Cir. 2011).  Plaintiff’s Complaint also makes this \nshowing.   \n \nPlaintiff describes two incidents where Deputy Loza allegedly used excessive force (on \nOctober 8, 2019 and December 9, 2019), months apart and at two different schools.  He further \nalleges that the County and Sheriff’s Department maintained four unconstitutional policies, \npractices, and/or customs that were the moving forces behind these constitutional violations: (1) \n“SRO intervention in minor misconduct typical of school-age children and/or related to their \nPage 12 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 13 of 19   Page ID #:706\ndisabilities;” (2) “SRO use of excessive and unnecessary physical and mechanical restraint and \nother physical force on children;” (3) “repeated constitutional violations that were not properly \ninvestigated and/or documented and for which the violators were not disciplined, reprimanded, \nor punished[;]” and (4) “SROs failing to use their body cameras, or using their body cameras \nimproperly, during handcuffings and other use of force incidents at school.”  (Compl. ¶ 147.)  \nPlaintiff argues that the two alleged handcuffings of C.B. are consistent with County Defendants’ \nspecific policies.  (See id. ¶¶ 93-94, 100, 113, 135, and 141.)  Drawing all inferences in Plaintiff’s \nfavor, these two incidents, coupled with the official policies listed above, raise a plausible claim of \na widespread custom of unnecessary intervention in minor incidents, failure to deescalate, use of \nexcessive force, and misuse of body cameras.  See Kirkpatrick v. Cty. of Washoe, 843 F.3d 784, \n796 (9th Cir. 2016).  \n \nThe Court DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to Plaintiff’s unconstitutional \ncustom claim.   \n \nc.  Failure to Train and Supervise  \n \nTo state a failure to train claim, Plaintiff must allege that (1) they were deprived of a \nconstitutional right, (2) the County had a training policy that amounts to deliberate indifference \nto the constitutional rights of the persons with whom its police officers are likely to come into \ncontact; and (3) their constitutional injury would have been avoided had the city properly trained \nthose officers.  Blankenhorn v. City of Orange, 485 F.3d 463, 484 (9th Cir. 2007).  A \nmunicipality’s “continued adherence to an approach that they know or should know has failed to \nprevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the \nconsequences of their action—the ‘deliberate indifference’—necessary to trigger municipal \nliability.”  Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cty., Okl. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407 (1997).  Thus, \nPlaintiffs may point to “a pattern of tortious conduct” by employees as evidence that a regime of \ninadequate training was the “moving force” behind their injuries.  Id. at 407-08 (citing Canton, \n489 U.S. at 390-91). \n \nPlaintiff alleges that the County and Sheriff’s Department failed to train and supervise \nSROs on: (1) “how to safely and appropriately interact with students, especially students with \ndisabilities[;]” (2) “when to abstain from intervening in incidents involving minor and/or \ndisability-related behaviors[;]” and (3) “compliance with state laws and internal procedures \npertaining to restraints…”  (Compl. ¶¶ 151-153.)  Plaintiff relies on national and district-level \ndata, the SRO policies, and the two incidents involving C.B. described above to support these \nallegations.  (County Opp’n at 19.)   \n \nThe County argues that Plaintiff merely alleges a single instance of unconstitutional \nactivity and fails to establish deliberate indifference.  (County MTD at 10-12.)  But as discussed \nabove, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges unconstitutional policies (both official and unofficial), which is \nsufficient to show deliberate indifference.  Kirkpatrick, 843 F.3d at 794.  The Court therefore \nfinds that Plaintiff sufficiently alleges a Monell claim based on the County’s failure to train and \nsupervise SROs, and DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to this claim.   \nPage 13 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 14 of 19   Page ID #:707\n \nBecause the Complaint sufficiently states a Monell claim based on an official municipal \npolicy, an unconstitutional practice or unofficial policy, and failure to train, the Court DENIES \nCounty Defendants’ Motion as to Claim 2.   \n \n5.  Disability Discrimination (Claims 3, 4, and 5)  \n \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) provides that individuals with \ndisabilities cannot be “excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, \nprograms, or activities of a public entity,” nor may they be “subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The Rehabilitation Act similarly provides that qualified \nindividuals with a disability may not be “excluded from the participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  California Government Code Section 11135(b) \nincorporates ADA standards for state-funded entities.   \n \nTo state a claim under Title II of the ADA, Plaintiff must allege that:  \n \n(1) []he is an individual with a disability; (2) []he is otherwise qualified to participate in or \nreceive the benefit of a public entity’s services, programs or activities; (3) []he was either \nexcluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the public entity’s services, \nprograms or activities or was otherwise discriminated against by the public entity; and (4) \nsuch exclusion, denial of benefits or discrimination was by reason of [his] disability.  \n \nSheehan, 743 F.3d at 1232.  To meet the third element, Plaintiff can show that “a law \nenforcement officer could have used less force or no force during the performance of his law-\nenforcement duties with respect to a disabled person.”  Armstrong v. Newsom, 2021 WL \n933106, at *25 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 11, 2021) (citing Sheehan, 743 F.3d at 1232-33). \n \nCounty Defendants argue that Plaintiff fails to identify any program that he was qualified \nto participate in, but was excluded from, because of his disability.  (County MTD at 13.)  County \nDefendants add that there are no factual allegations to support a claim that Plaintiff was \nhandcuffed because of his disability.  (Id. at 14.)  The Court disagrees.  \n \nFirst, Plaintiff alleges that he has a disability within the meaning of the applicable statutes, \nas he has diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and Oppositional \nDefiant Disorder (“ODD”).  (Compl. ¶ 14.)  Second, while County Defendants appear to adopt \na narrow definition of “programs,” the Ninth Circuit interprets “services, programs, or \nactivities” under the ADA to encompass “virtually anything that a public entity does.”  Barden \nv. City of Sacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002).  Accordingly, the ADA applies \nbroadly to police activities, including arrests.  Sheehan, 743 F.3d at 1232.  Plaintiff’s Complaint \ndescribes the SRO Program and its activities, and alleges plausible facts to support an inference \nthat SROs failed to accommodate C.B.’s disabilities and employed excessive force against him, \nPage 14 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 15 of 19   Page ID #:708\namounting to discrimination on the basis of his disability.  (Opp’n at 22; Compl. ¶¶ 20, 29-31, 53, \n61-63, 39-40, 162-63, 174.)   \n \nEven if Plaintiff did not identify a program he was excluded from, the plain language of \nthe statute provides that a plaintiff may allege that he was either excluded from programs or \n“subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C.A. § 12132; see also Bircoll v. \nMiami-Date Cty., 480 F.3d 1072, 1085 (11th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he final clause of § 12132 protects \nqualified individuals with a disability from being ‘subjected to discrimination by any such entity,’ \nand is not tied directly to the ‘services, programs, or activities’ of the public entity.”).  Plaintiff’s \nallegations support an inference that Deputy Loza “could have used less force or no force during \nthe performance of [her] law-enforcement duties” with respect to Plaintiff, a disabled person.  \n(See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 2-3, 5-8, 46-48, 67-68, 89-114, 123-25.)  Armstrong, 2021 WL 933106, at \n*25.  Plaintiff therefore states a disability discrimination claim under the ADA, the Rehabilitation \nAct, and Cal. Gov’t Code Section 11135.  \n \n  The Court DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as to Plaintiff’s disability \ndiscrimination claims (Claims 3, 4, and 5).   \n \n6.  Race Discrimination (Claim 5)  \n \n  Plaintiff asserts a race discrimination claim under California Government Code Section \n11135, which prohibits race-based discrimination by recipients of state funds.  Section 11135 \nprovides a private right of action to challenge disparate impact discrimination.  Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 2, § 11154.  Courts apply a burden-shifting framework to analyze disparate impact cases: (1) \nplaintiffs must show “defendant’s facially neutral practice causes a disproportionate adverse \nimpact on a protected class”; (2) “to rebut, the defendant must justify the challenged practice”; \nand (3) “if defendant meets its rebuttal burden, the plaintiff may still prevail by establishing a less \ndiscriminatory alternative.”  Darensburg v. Metro. Transp. Comm’n, 636 F.3d 511, 519 (9th Cir. \n2011).   \n \n  County Defendants set forth a bewildering argument to dismiss Plaintiff’s racial \ndiscrimination claim.  County Defendants repeatedly assert that Plaintiff is “[p]laying the race \ncard” by alleging that he is Black.  (County MTD at n.1, 13.)  They further assert that “there are \nno factual allegations nor any evidence to support any race based discrimination on the part of the \nCounty defendants.”  (Id. at n.1.)  County Defendants appear to have missed paragraphs 121-25 \nof the Complaint, which allege that “[t]he Sheriff’s Department’s school arrest data [] show that \nBlack students are more likely to be arrested and arrested for non-violent offenses than their non-\nBlack peers[,]” and point to relevant statistics.  (Compl. ¶ 121.)  The Complaint further alleges \nthat “Defendants disproportionately arrest Black students for minor and/or disability-related \nbehaviors[,]” and that “Defendants also discriminate against C.B. and other similarly situated \nBlack students with respect to school police restraints…”  (Id. ¶¶ 183-84.)  Plaintiff alleges that \n“the Sheriff’s Department Policies grant SROs broad authority to intervene in incidents \ninvolving students, even where the student has committed no crime.”  (Id. ¶ 125.)  Plaintiff also \nalleges that the “implicit and unconscious biases and stereotypes against Black students … are \nPage 15 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 16 of 19   Page ID #:709\nincorporated into the Sheriff’s Department policy allowing SROs to handcuff children who \nofficers perceive as ‘combative or threatening.’”  (Id. ¶ 184.)  These are specific allegations of \nracial discrimination against County Defendants.   \n \nAfter being directed to these allegations in Plaintiff’s Opposition, County Defendants \ndouble down on their “race card” argument, arguing in their Reply that “Plaintiff is in fact \nplaying the race card because there are absolutely no allegations related to any County \nDefendants that Plaintiffs was discriminated against, in any way, based on his race.…”  (County \nReply at 4.)  County Defendants may disagree with Plaintiff’s allegations, but merely dismissing \nthese (as well as the mere mention of Plaintiff’s race) as “playing the race card” is not a legal \nargument.  The Court expects County Defendants to address racial discrimination claims with \nthe same rigor as any other claims by offering legal authorities and arguments as to why they fail.  \nInstead, County Defendants chose to respond with facile jargon, which is both offensive and \nlegally insignificant.  County Defendants must do better in this Court, and their “race card” \nargument is rejected.  Taking Plaintiffs’ allegations to be true, the Court DENIES County \nDefendants’ Motion as to Claim 5. \n \n7.  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Claim 8) \n \nTo state a prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), \nPlaintiff must allege: “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of \ncausing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s \nsuffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the \nemotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct. . . . Conduct to be outrageous must be \nso extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.”  Miller v. \nFortune Commercial Corp., 15 Cal. App. 5th 214, 228–29 (2017) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  Behavior is considered outrageous where a defendant: “(1) abuses a relation or \nposition which gives him power to damage the plaintiff’s interest; (2) knows the plaintiff is \nsusceptible to injuries through mental distress; or (3) acts intentionally or unreasonably with the \nrecognition that the acts are likely to result in illness through mental distress.”  McDaniel v. Gile, \n230 Cal. App. 3d 363, 372 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991).  \n \nCounty Defendants argue that the Complaint does not allege any such extreme or \noutrageous conduct by Deputy Loza, or any conduct intended to cause emotional distress.  \n(County MTD at 15.)  The Court is unpersuaded.  Plaintiff alleges that Deputy Loza knew or \nshould have known that Plaintiff was a young child with disabilities, and that he was particularly \nsusceptible to mental distress because of his young age and documented disabilities.  (Compl. ¶¶ \n3-4, 210.)  As discussed above, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Loza acted unreasonably by \npulling, tackling, and handcuffing Plaintiff, even though he could not be charged with a crime.  \nThis is compounded by Deputy Loza’s position of power over Plaintiff as a resource officer.  See, \ne.g., Wordlow v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 2018 WL 6171792, at *14 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 26, 2018) (“[A] \njury could reasonably find [the resource officer’s] conduct ‘extreme and outrageous’ given: (1) \n[his] position of power over M.M. as a security officer; and (2) the reasonableness, or lack \nthereof, inherent in his decision to handcuff [the minor student].”)  To the extent that County \nPage 16 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 17 of 19   Page ID #:710\nDefendants disagree about Plaintiff’s susceptibility to emotional distress, or whether Loza knew \nPlaintiff was likely to be distressed by her actions, these are questions of fact not suitable for a \nmotion to dismiss.  \n \nThe Court DENIES the County’s Motion as to Claim 8.   \n \n8.  Battery, Assault, and False Imprisonment (Claims 9, 10, and 11)  \n \nCounty Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s battery, assault, and false imprisonment claims \nfail because Loza did not unlawfully detain or use excessive force on Plaintiff.  (County MTD at \n5-8.)  For the reasons discussed in section A.3. above, the Court finds that Plaintiff sufficiently \nstates a claim for excessive force.  The Court therefore DENIES County Defendants’ Motion as \nto Claims 9, 10, and 11.   \n \nB.  Individual Defendants  \n \nIndividual Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims,2 arguing that they are entitled to \ndiscretionary immunity under Cal. Gov’t Code Section 820.2.  As discussed in Section A.2 as to \nthe County Defendants, discretionary act immunity is construed “as narrowly as possible[,]” and \nthe burden is on government employees to establish that they are entitled to such immunity.  \nA.E. ex rel. Hernandez, 666 F.3d at 639-40.   \n \nFirst, much like with County Defendants, discretionary act immunity does not shield \nIndividual Defendants from liability for false imprisonment, Robinson, 278 F.3d at 1916; the use \nof excessive force, Rodriguez, 891 F.3d at 799; or state law claims arising from the alleged use of \nforce, such as intentional infliction of emotional distress, Blankenhorn, 485 F.3d at 487.  \nIndividual Defendants appear to acknowledge the second such limitation, noting that if the Court \ngrants their Motion, “Plaintiff may still proceed against Moving Defendants under his first cause \nof action for violation of his civil rights.”  (Arellano MTD at 9.)  However, as Plaintiff points out, \nPlaintiff’s allegations of excessive force also support his remaining state law claims against \nIndividual Defendants for battery, assault, false imprisonment, and IIED.   \n \nIndividual Defendants further argue that Arellano and Owens were acting within their \nauthority as law enforcement officers, and exercising their discretion in responding to Plaintiff’s \nconduct.  (Arellano MTD at 6-8.)  But in applying the discretionary act immunity, “[a]n \nemployee’s normal job duties are not determinative; the burden rests with government \ndefendants to demonstrate that they are entitled to § 820.2 immunity for a specific policy \n \n2 Plaintiff asserts Claims 1 (unreasonable seizure and excessive force), 8 (intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress), 9 (false imprisonment), 10 (battery), 11 (assault), and 12 \n(negligent supervision) against Individual Defendants Arellano, Scott, Walker, and Owens.  (See \nCompl.)   \nPage 17 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 18 of 19   Page ID #:711\ndecision made by an employee who consciously balanced the decision’s risks and benefits.”  Id. \nat 640.  Individual Defendants make no such showing here.3   \n \nFinally, Individual Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to allege any statute imposing a \nduty on Defendant Scott, the District’s Director of Safety and Security, to supervise or train the \nDistrict’s Campus Security Officers.  (Arellano MTD at 6.)  That is because California \nregulations require CSOs have training and verification as school security officers before their \nhiring.  (Id. (citing Cal. Educ. Code § 38001.5).)  However, Cal. Educ. Code Section 38000 also \nstates that security departments established by a school district are “under the supervision of a \nchief of security.”  Cal. Educ. Code § 38000(a).  Moreover, the District’s CSO position \ndescription states that CSOs must receive ongoing training “[u]nder the general direction of the \nDirector of Safety and Security.”   Id. at § 38001.5(b).  Even more, the Complaint alleges that \nScott supervised or directed the CSO program, and that on information and belief, he gave CSOs \nverbal orders, rather than promulgating policies and procedures.  (Compl. ¶¶ 54-58.)  The Court \nfinds that Scott may be held liable under the alleged facts.   \n \nTaking Plaintiff’s allegations to be true and construing all inferences in his favor, the \nCourt DENIES Individual Defendants’ Motion.  \n \nC. District Defendants  \n \nPlaintiff asserts Claims 3 (ADA violations), 4 (Rehabilitation Act violations), 5 (race and \ndisability discrimination), 6 (violation of Cal. Civ. Code Section 51), 7 (California Constitution \nviolations), 8 (IIED), 9 (false imprisonment), 10 (battery), 11 (assault), and 12 (negligent \nsupervision) against District Defendants.  \n \nDistrict Defendants move to dismiss the state law claims (Claims 5-12), arguing that \npursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, they are immune from suit in federal court for these \nclaims.  (See District MTD.)  Plaintiff does not oppose the District’s Motion as to these claims.  \n(See District Non-Opp’n.)  The Court therefore GRANTS the District MTD and DISMISSES \nClaims 5-12 against District Defendants.   \n \n// \n// \n// \n// \n \n3 Individual Defendants also argue that “Plaintiff should not be able to claim that his \ndisabilities caused him to behave the way he was reported to have behaved, and then impose legal \nprinciples that protect students with disabilities in order to suggest that he was improperly \ncontained based solely on his race.”  (Arellano Reply at 3 (emphasis in original).)  But at the \nmotion to dismiss stage, the Court must in fact assume that Plaintiff’s allegations are true, and \nconstrue all inferences in Plaintiff’s favor.   \n \nPage 18 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 83   Filed 06/17/21   Page 19 of 19   Page ID #:712\nV.  CONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons above, the Court GRANTS the District’s Motion, and GRANTS IN \nPART and DENIES IN PART the County’s and Arellano’s Motion.  The June 21, 2021 hearing \nis VACATED.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \nPage 19 of 19  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk MG   \n ",

Plaintiff C.B., a minor, by and through his guardians ad litem W.B. \n3  and B.T. (“Plaintiff” or “C.B.”), brings this action for injunctive relief and \n4  damages against the Moreno Valley Unified School District (“District” or “Moreno \n5  Valley USD”), District Superintendent Martinrex Kedziora, the County of \n6  Riverside (“County”), the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department (“Sheriff’s \n7  Department”), and various individuals for harms resulting from at least four violent \n8  handcuffings and detentions at his middle school campuses. C.B. alleges that \n9  Defendants’ actions, inactions, policies, practices, customs and procedures violated \n10  and continue to violate his rights under the U.S. Constitution, the Americans with \n11  Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq., Section 504 of the \n12  Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq., state civil rights laws, \n13  and common law torts.  \n14  2.  C.B. further alleges that the District, Sheriff’s Department, and \n15  County partner to operate a discipline system that discriminates against students \n16  with disabilities and Black students, including Black disabled students. The \n17  District employs its own Campus Security Officers (CSOs) and contracts with the \n18  Sheriff’s Department to provide School Resource Officers (SROs) at District \n19  schools. The District calls on CSOs and SROs (together, “school police officers”) \n20  to respond with physical force to minor and/or disability-related behaviors that \n21  could be managed by teachers or administrators with less harmful methods, such as \n22  crisis intervention, de-escalation, patience, communication, and waiting.  \n23  3.  C.B. is a Black student with disabilities residing within the boundary \n24  of the District. School police officers tackled and handcuffed C.B. in response to \n25  his disability-related behaviors at least four separate times over a less than four-\n26  month span in 2019. At the time of the handcuffings, C.B. was between ten and \n27  eleven years old, stood about four feet, eight inches, and weighed about seventy \n28  pounds. In at least one incident the school police officers simultaneously shackled \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 1 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 4 of 52   Page ID\n#:1070\n \n \n1  his wrists and ankles. \n2  4.  School police officer body camera footage captured part of the third \n3  mechanical restraint, which occurred on October 8, 2019, and part of the fourth \n4  mechanical restraint, which occurred on December 9, 2019.  \n5  5.  In the October 8 incident, the officers entered C.B.’s special education \n6  classroom to investigate an allegation that he threw a rock the day before. C.B. sat \n7  with his head down on his desk while the school police officers questioned him. \n8  Within ninety seconds of their arrival, the officers physically pulled C.B. from his \n9  desk by his arms and shoulders, pushed him with force to the ground, and \n10  handcuffed him. One officer pinned his knee in C.B.’s back while another officer \n11  placed him in handcuffs.   \n12  6.  In the December 9 incident, two officers entered C.B.’s special \n13  education classroom to investigate an allegation that C.B. had gotten into a shoving \n14  match with another student and had thrown classroom items. One of the officers \n15  immediately restrained C.B. on the floor until a third officer arrived and \n16  handcuffed him, and a fourth officer arrived to escort C.B. to a police cruiser. He \n17  complained several times of pain from the handcuffs, but the officers did nothing \n18  to address the pain, instead shoving his head into the side of the police cruiser, and \n19  yanking him from behind by his handcuffs. Rather than release C.B. to his mother, \n20  they took him to the police station and sent him off in an ambulance for a \n21  psychiatric evaluation. \n22  7.  As a result of Defendants’ unnecessary and excessive physical and \n23  mechanical restraints, C.B. has suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional \n24  distress, mental anguish, pain, humiliation, and exacerbation of his disabilities. His \n25  parents have secured therapy services to help him cope with the trauma caused by \n26  these incidents.  \n27  8.  On information and belief, Defendants were and are on notice that \n28  interactions with school police officers trigger and exacerbate C.B.’s disabilities \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 2 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 5 of 52   Page ID\n#:1071\n \n \n1  and cause emotional distress. Nevertheless, the District continues to request and \n2  direct school police officers to respond to C.B.’s minor and/or disability-related \n3  behaviors, unnecessarily escalating matters. By way of example, in a meeting with \n4  C.B.’s parents, Defendant District stated that it could not implement a policy at all \n5  times of exhausting less intrusive methods before calling officers. Further, school \n6  police officers responded and continue to respond with excessive physical force \n7  during each interaction with C.B.  \n8  9.  On information and belief, and as evidenced by the at least four \n9  handcuffings and detentions of C.B., the District fails to sufficiently train its \n10  teachers, administrators, and other non-school police officer staff on using \n11  alternatives to law enforcement to respond to minor and/or disability-related \n12  behaviors. The District’s law enforcement referral data demonstrates its excessive \n13  and disproportionate reliance on school police officers. The District refers students \n14  to law enforcement at a significantly higher rate than comparable districts in the \n15  state. Moreover, while Black students make up about 14% of total District \n16  enrollment, they are nearly 30% of District referrals to law enforcement. The \n17  District’s rate of referring Black students to law enforcement is more than 2.5 \n18  times its rate of referring non-Black students to law enforcement.    \n19  10.  The injuries suffered by C.B. at the hands of SROs were also the \n20  product of Defendant Sheriff’s Department’s and County’s handcuffing policies \n21  and practices and failures to train and supervise its staff. The pattern of unlawful or \n22  excessive restraint and handcuffing in response to C.B.’s minor and/or disability-\n23  related behavior constitutes deliberate indifference to his constitutional rights.  \n24  11.  Defendants have practices, policies, and/or customs of willful failure \n25  to adequately report, document, investigate, and/or respond to, complaints of \n26  unnecessary mechanical and other physical restraints of students, which has caused \n27  C.B. to suffer constitutional injuries as a result, and has compounded the harms \n28  suffered by C.B. By way of example, Defendants have failed to provide any \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 3 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 6 of 52   Page ID\n#:1072\n \n \n1  meaningful information regarding what transpired in the four incidents, despite \n2  C.B.’s parents’ repeated requests. Defendants have abdicated their responsibility to \n3  train, supervise, and discipline their employees by failing to adequately report, \n4  document, investigate and/or respond to complaints of unlawful or excessive force. \n5  12.  Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, including punitive damages, and \n6  injunctive and declaratory relief for ongoing violations of his rights, including an \n7  order that Defendants cease the involvement of school police officers in low-level \n8  student misbehaviors and instead provide C.B. and similarly situated students with \n9  reasonable modifications and positive supports and services. \n10  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11  13.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s federal claims pursuant to \n12  28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. The same actions and omissions that form the basis \n13  of Plaintiff’s federal claims, form the basis of his California state law claims. Thus, \n14  this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims under 28 \n15  U.S.C. § 1367. Declaratory relief is available pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and \n16  Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Injunctive relief is authorized by \n17  28 U.S.C. § 2202 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n18  14.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California, Eastern Division, \n19  because Plaintiff resides in, and Defendants operate and perform official duties in, \n20  Riverside County. A substantial part of the events, acts, and omissions giving rise \n21  to the claims also occurred in Riverside County. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). \n22  PARTIES \n23  A. Plaintiff \n24  15.  Plaintiff C.B. is a Black, twelve-year-old boy with disabilities in the \n25  seventh grade. At the time of the events described herein, C.B. was between ten \n26  and eleven years old, approximately seventy pounds, and in the sixth grade. He \n27  appears by and through his parents and guardians ad litem W.B. and B.T.  \n28  16.  Presently, and at all times relevant to this action, C.B. was and is a \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 4 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 7 of 52   Page ID\n#:1073\n \n \n1  qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of all applicable statutes \n2  including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504, and California \n3  Government Code § 12926. C.B. has diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \n4  Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Intermittent Explosive \n5  Disorder, and Other Specified Trauma and Stressor Related Disorder. C.B.’s \n6  diagnosis of Other Specified Trauma and Stressor Related Disorder is related to \n7  Defendants’ violent and degrading treatment of him. C.B.’s symptoms of \n8  Intermittent Explosive Disorder are exacerbated by his interactions with \n9  Defendants. These disabilities make it difficult for him to regulate his emotions, \n10  maintain focus, communicate, and comply promptly with directions. C.B., at all \n11  times relevant to this action, received special education services.1 C.B.’s parents \n12  suspect that he may have additional undiagnosed emotional and behavioral \n13  disabilities, some of which resulted from or were exacerbated by his interactions \n14  with law enforcement. \n15  17.  Presently, and at all times relevant to this action, C.B. was and is a \n16  resident of Moreno Valley, Riverside County, California. \n17  18.  Presently, and at all times relevant to this action, C.B. was a student at \n18  Landmark Middle School or Mountain View Middle School within the school \n19  district boundary of Moreno Valley USD. \n20  B. Defendants \n21  Moreno Valley USD \n22  19.

The District has a student population of 32,299, \n26 \n \n1 Through this complaint, C.B. does not challenge the adequacy of his Individualized Education Program (IEP) \n27 \nor allege Defendants violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). All references to his IEP, \nIEP team meetings, or special education classroom herein are for background purposes, e.g., to support his \n28 \nstatus as a qualified individual with disabilities, establish Defendants’ knowledge of his disabilities, and provide \nevidence that Defendants discriminated against him by handcuffing him for disability-related behaviors. \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 5 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 8 of 52   Page ID\n#:1074\n \n \n1  making it the twenty-fifth most populous school district in California.2  \n2  20.

Racial and Disability Disparities in School Policing and Restraint \n14  Increased Police Presence in America’s Schools \n15  47.  In recent decades, school districts have drastically expanded school \n16  police programs.4 Instead of addressing student behaviors by providing positive \n17  supports or through administrative discipline, school administrators now call the \n18  police.5 The addition of police officers in schools has not made schools safer and \n19  instead has increased the criminalization of minor and/or disability-related \n20  behaviors.6  \n21  48.  As school districts have expanded school police programs, they have \n22  failed to fund behavioral and mental health supports. For instance, around fourteen \n23 \n \n24 \n4 In 1975, just 1% of schools placed police officers on campus, as compared to nearly half of schools today. This \n25  expansion was primarily driven by readily available federal funding for SRO programs, rather than an actual \nneed for increased police presence. See, e.g., Amir Whitaker, et al., AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION, COPS \n26  AND NO COUNSELORS: HOW THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH STAFF IS HARMING STUDENTS (2019), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/030419-acluschooldisciplinereport.pdf.   \n5 Id. \n27 \n6 Id.; see also Emily K.

Increased police presence in schools has had a disproportionate \n4  impact on students with disabilities and Black students. According to the U.S. \n5  Department of Education’s 2015-16 Civil Rights Data Collection Survey,8 students \n6  with disabilities represent just 12% of the student population nationally but 28% of \n7  all students referred to law enforcement9 or arrested at school. Black students make \n8  up 15% of student enrollment nationally but 31% of students referred to law \n9  enforcement or arrested at school.  \n10  50.  These disparities are also present in the national data on mechanical \n11  restraints,10 the category capturing handcuffings. According to the 2017-18 Civil \n12  Rights Data Collection survey,11 students with disabilities again make up about \n13  12% of the student population nationally but 41% of all students subjected to \n14  mechanical restraints. Black students represent 18% of all students with disabilities \n15  nationally, but 34% of those put in mechanical restraints. \n16  51.  Police presence and contact have grave, lifelong consequences for \n17  students. Multiple studies demonstrate that police contact causes and exacerbates \n18  mental health disabilities, especially trauma and anxiety.12 Youth are particularly \n19  vulnerable to heightened emotional distress when they experience intrusive police \n20   \n7 Whitaker, supra note 4. \n21  8 U.S. Dept. of Educ., 2015-16 Civil Rights Data Collection: School Climate and Safety (May 2019), \nhttps://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/school-climate-and-safety.pdf.   \n22  9 The Civil Rights Data Collection defines law enforcement referral as “[A]ction[s] by which a student is \nreported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on \n23  school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether \nofficial action is taken.” See id. at p. 3. \n24  10 The Civil Rights Data Collection uses the same definition of “mechanical restraint” as California state law: \n“The use of a device or equipment to restrict a pupil’s freedom of movement.” Cal. Educ. Code § 49005.1(d)(1). \n25  11 U.S. Dept. of Educ., 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection: The Use of Restraint and Seclusion on Children \nwith Disabilities in K-12 Schools (Oct. 2020), https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/restraint-and-\nseclusion.pdf.  \n26 \n12 See, e.g., Amanda Geller et al., Aggressive Policing and the Mental Health of Young Urban Men, 104 AM. J. \nPUBLIC HEALTH 2321 (2014) (studying young men’s experiences of police encounters and finding that men who \n27 \nreported more police contact also reported more trauma and anxiety symptoms, indicating a need for less invasive \ntactics); Dylan B. Jackson et al., Police Stops Among At-Risk Youth: Repercussions for Mental Health, 65 J. \n28 \nADOLESCENT HEALTH 627 (2019) (finding that youth who were stopped more often by police officers were more \nlikely to report emotional trauma).  \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 12 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 15 of 52   Page ID\n#:1081\n \n \n1  stops.13 Districts that are overpoliced and under-resourced thus subject their \n2  students to traumatic police contact, while simultaneously leaving them without \n3  mental health resources to process these events.  \n4  52.  Police contact causes even greater harm when accompanied by \n5  physical force. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) has \n6  explained that even if no physical injury is sustained, children who are restrained \n7  can be severely traumatized as a result.14 Students are too anxious, frightened, or \n8  angry to focus on and fully participate in classroom activities. When an individual \n9  is exposed to trauma, especially in the form of repeated traumatic stress of an \n10  extreme traumatic event, the brain becomes over-sensitized to any potential \n11  stimulus that might cue a threat. The individual thus perceives ordinary encounters \n12  as threatening ones, triggering a “fight or flight” or dissociative response.15 \n13  53.  Dissociative responses impair a student’s attention, organization, \n14  comprehension, memory, and trust, all necessary for the acquisition of academic \n15  skills. Thus, childhood trauma is linked to poor academic outcomes, including \n16  failure to reach proficiency in core subjects and/or to graduate from high school. \n17  Exposure to trauma causes challenges with emotional self-regulation – including \n18  aggression, disproportionate reactivity, impulsivity, distractibility, or withdrawal \n19  and avoidance – that disrupt the learning environment and frequently lead to \n20  exclusionary school discipline measures or absence from school. Thus, police \n21  presence, contact, and use of force are not only traumatizing, but also counter-\n22  productive to creating a safe school environment that is conducive to learning. \n23  California’s Movement Away from School Policing \n24  54.

Schools in California are reviewing and addressing racial and \n6  disability disparities in discipline to ensure students of color and students with \n7  disabilities, including disabled students of color, like C.B., are not \n8  disproportionately subject to police referrals and restraints as compared with their \n9  similarly situated peers. For these reasons, several large school districts, including \n10  Oakland Unified School District and Sacramento City Unified School District, \n11  have abolished their SRO programs completely.16 \n12  56.  Moreno Valley USD is not one of these districts. Following the \n13  murder of George Floyd, a coalition of Riverside County community groups \n14  organized to abolish the District’s SRO program. On July 23, 2020, the District’s \n15  Board conducted a “Study Session” to gather community input regarding the SRO \n16  program. During this Session, the Board received almost fifty public comments, \n17  with nearly all speakers urging the Board to abolish the SRO program and reinvest \n18  its $1.3 million-dollar budget in mental health supports, Restorative Justice, \n19  culturally relevant curricula, and other non-police programming. Many speakers \n20  specifically cited the officers’ abuse of C.B. as reason to make these changes. The \n21  Board, however, did not abolish the SRO program.    \n22  B. Moreno Valley USD’s Campus Security Officer Program \n23  57.  On information and belief, the District established its CSO Program \n24  pursuant to the School Security Department provisions in California Education \n25  Code § 38000 et seq.

On information and belief, CSOs are employees of the District.  \n3  59.  According to the District’s position description,17 a CSO, under the \n4  general direction of the Director of Safety and Security, “supervises, monitors, and \n5  controls” school campuses and “enforces the rules and regulations governing \n6  student behavior.” Expected duties include “physically restrain[ing] persons \n7  involved in crimes, rights, or other acts of violence.” The position also requires \n8  CSOs to receive ongoing trainings on the use of pepper spray and tasers, \n9  suggesting that the District considers use of force to be essential to the CSOs’ role. \n10  60.  The CSOs wear police-style uniforms and are issued metal handcuffs. \n11  On information and belief, CSOs also carry pepper spray and tasers. \n12  61.  On information and belief, the District’s CSO Program has no written \n13  policies and/or procedures. CSOs instead take verbal orders from Director Scott. \n14  62.  State law governs the use of restraint, including mechanical restraint, \n15  in schools. Cal. Educ. Code § 49005 et seq. Staff may only use restraint in an \n16  emergency and not for the purpose of coercion, discipline, convenience, or \n17  retaliation. Cal. Educ. Code § 49005.2. They may not place a pupil in a facedown \n18  position with the pupil’s hands held or restrained behind the pupil’s back. Cal. \n19  Educ. Code § 49005.8(a)(5).  \n20  63.  District policy implementing these state laws prohibits its staff, \n21  including CSOs, from using restraints that employ a device, material, or objects \n22  that simultaneously immobilize all four extremities.18 The same District policy \n23  only allows its staff, including CSOs, to use restraint if they have received a \n24  certification in Crisis Prevention Intervention (CPI).  \n25  /// \n26 \n \n27 \n17 Moreno Valley USD Human Resources Division, Position Title: Campus Security Officer I (Oct. 17, 2017), \nhttps://4.files.edl.io/af25/09/04/18/173822-651104c9-971a-47b6-ba39-362fd1900e5b.pdf.  \n28 \n18 Moreno Valley USD, MVUSD SELPA Handbook at p. 6-4 (Aug. 26, 2020), \nhttps://4.files.edl.io/460c/08/26/20/224843-47f1cf94-84cd-47e4-8a31-5c07ab6ef4b2.pdf.   \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 15 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 18 of 52   Page ID\n#:1084\n \n \n1  C. The District’s School Resource Officer Program \n2  Relationship Between the District and Sheriff’s Department \n3  64.  The District maintains an SRO program through a “Law Enforcement \n4  Services Agreement” with the Sheriff's Department and/or County. The agreement, \n5  effective July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2021, specifies that the Sheriff’s Department \n6  will provide nine SROs to the District, three of whom serve the middle school \n7  campuses and six of whom serve the high school campuses. The total cost of the \n8  three-year contract is $4.3 million, which includes the full cost of the SROs’ \n9  salaries. On information and belief, the District funds the Agreement almost \n10  entirely through Local Control Funding Formula Supplemental and Concentration \n11  Funds.  \n12  65.  On information and belief, the SROs are employees of the Sheriff’s \n13  Department and/or County of Riverside.  \n14  66.  According to the contract, the SROs are sworn law enforcement \n15  officers whose duties include patrolling and investigating crimes on Moreno \n16  Valley USD campuses, facilitating conversations between students and their \n17  parents, and serving as a liaison at elementary school sites. \n18  Department Policies Governing Body Camera Footage \n19  67.  Under a 2016 directive, the Sheriff’s Department requires its officers \n20  to create body camera recordings of “any law enforcement action where there is \n21  reason to believe it would be appropriate and valuable to record the event.” This \n22  includes citizen contacts and detentions.  \n23  68.  If an officer fails to initiate the recording of an event when required, \n24  the officer must document the reasons for the failure in a subsequent report or \n25  memorandum. Further, officers may not terminate the body camera recording until \n26  the conclusion of the encounter, “unless tactical or practical reasons dictate \n27  otherwise.” Even then, the officer must reinitiate the recording as soon as possible \n28  and document the reasons for early termination in a report.  \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 16 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 19 of 52   Page ID\n#:1085\n \n \n1  Sheriff’s Department Policies on Restraint and Handcuffing \n2  69.  The Sheriff’s Department Standards Manual (“Manual”) sets out the \n3  standards for when officers may handcuff youth. Policy 306.2.3 directs officers not \n4  to handcuff youth under age fourteen “unless he/she is suspected of a dangerous \n5  felony or when the deputy has a reasonable suspicion that the juvenile may resist, \n6  attempt escape, injure him/herself, injure the deputy, or damage property.”  \n7  70.  Policy 324.9 further specifies that officers may not handcuff status \n8  offenders or children age eleven or younger unless they are “combative or \n9  threatening.” The Policy does not guide officers as to how to decide whether a \n10  child meets the standard of being “combative or threatening.” This standard is \n11  susceptible to implicit and explicit racial biases, since officers are more likely to \n12  view ambiguous or disability-related behavior as “combative and threatening” \n13  when shown by Black students rather than white students.19 \n14  71.  The Manual does not require, or even encourage, officers to use crisis \n15  communication or other non-violent alternatives to restraint, particularly for \n16  students with disabilities. \n17  D. Facts Regarding Plaintiff C.B. \n18  72.  C.B. is a student of Defendant Moreno Valley USD and is in the \n19  seventh grade at Mountain View Middle School. C.B. has been on a remote \n20  learning model for school since on or about March 16, 2020, due to the Covid-19 \n21  shutdown. At the time of the incidents described herein, C.B. was between ten and \n22  eleven years old and enrolled in the sixth grade.  \n23  73.  C.B. is an engaging and bright twelve-year-old boy who loves playing \n24  basketball, fishing competitively and with his father, playing video games, and \n25  spending time with his family. C.B. is intelligent and enjoys learning, showing \n26 \n \n19 See Kurt Hugenberg & Galen V. Bodenhausen, Facing Prejudice: Implicit Prejudice and the Perception of \n27 \nRacial Threat, 14 PSYCHOL.

He and his parents hope that he will one day \n2  attend college and pursue a career about which he is passionate. \n3  74.  C.B. has diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder \n4  (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Intermittent Explosive Disorder, \n5  and Other Specified Trauma and Stressor Related Disorder. C.B.’s diagnosis of \n6  Other Specified Trauma and Stressor Related Disorder is related to Defendants’ \n7  violent and degrading treatment of him. C.B.’s symptoms of Intermittent Explosive \n8  Disorder are exacerbated by his interactions with Defendants. These disabilities \n9  make it difficult for him to regulate his emotions, maintain focus, communicate, \n10  and comply promptly with directions. C.B.’s parents suspect that he may have \n11  additional undiagnosed emotional and behavioral disabilities, some of which \n12  resulted from or were exacerbated by his interactions with law enforcement.   \n13  75.  C.B. enrolled in the District in May 2019 after attending other school \n14  districts in Los Angeles and Riverside Counties. Staff never handcuffed C.B. in his \n15  prior school districts. Since C.B. enrolled in the District, CSOs and SROs \n16  handcuffed him at least four times in less than four months, as detailed below.  \n17  Mechanical Restraint No. 1: On or about August 21, 2019, school police officers \n18  handcuffed C.B. for conduct resulting from his disabilities. \n19  76.  C.B. had been a student at Landmark Middle School (“Landmark”) \n20  for less than one month, when on or about August 21, 2019, school police officers \n21  handcuffed him.  \n22  77.  That day, then-Landmark Assistant Principal Pedro Gutierrez called \n23  C.B.’s mother, B.T., to tell her to pick him up from school early because he was \n24  “acting up.” On information and belief, C.B. was exhibiting behaviors caused by \n25  his disability.  \n26  78.  When C.B.’s mother arrived at Landmark, Mr. Gutierrez told her that \n27  school police officers had handcuffed C.B. The officers had removed the handcuffs \n28  before she arrived. Mr. Gutierrez told C.B.’s mother that he instructed officers to \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 18 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 21 of 52   Page ID\n#:1087\n \n \n1  remove the handcuffs because he believed that handcuffing C.B. was “totally \n2  unacceptable,” or words to that effect. Other than this statement, Mr. Gutierrez did \n3  not provide C.B.’s mother with any further information regarding the handcuffing.  \n4  79.  Contrary to District policy, the District did not document the \n5  mechanical restraint in an Incident Report. As a result, Plaintiff cannot state the \n6  names of the school police officers who handcuffed him. He believes this \n7  information is solely in the hands of Defendants.   \n8  80.  On information and belief, the District did not document the incident \n9  or adequately investigate, train, supervise, or discipline the staff involved. \n10  Mechanical Restraint No. 2: On August 26, 2019, school police officers shackled \n11  C.B.’s hands and ankles for conduct resulting from his disabilities. \n12  81.  Five days later, on August 26, 2019, District CSOs handcuffed and \n13  leg-cuffed C.B. at Landmark.  \n14  82.  That day, Mr. Gutierrez directed CSO Demetrius Owens to bring C.B. \n15  to the office for a meeting. CSO Owens’ witness statement does not describe a \n16  reason for this meeting. According to a behavior log drafted by C.B.’s teacher, Mr. \n17  Proprofsky, C.B. had disrupted class earlier in the day by cursing and ripping \n18  paper. Plaintiff suspects that the meeting with Mr. Gutierrez was related to his \n19  alleged disruptive behavior in class – which took place approximately three hours \n20  before Mr. Gutierrez summoned him to his office. Again, these behaviors were \n21  caused by his disabilities.  \n22  83.  CSO Owens, CSO King, and then-Landmark Assistant Principal \n23  Kamilah O’Connor found C.B. on the playground. All three directed C.B. to leave \n24  the playground and go to the office. C.B. verbally refused and started to exhibit \n25  conduct related to his disabilities, including an inability to self-regulate or express \n26  himself. He allegedly clenched his fists and began breathing heavily. CSO King \n27  and CSO Owens responded by dragging C.B. by his arms to a seclusion room. \n28  84.  Then-Landmark Principal Scott Walker joined CSOs Owens and King \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 19 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 22 of 52   Page ID\n#:1088\n \n \n1  in the seclusion room. Surrounded by three much larger adults in the seclusion \n2  room, C.B. began experiencing and externalizing emotions of fear, anxiety, and \n3  frustration. He began pulling away, pushing, and swinging with his arms in an \n4  attempt to free himself from the room. C.B. was not acting out physically before \n5  the CSOs physically dragged him to the seclusion room. \n6  85.  Principal Walker directed CSO King and CSO Owens to handcuff \n7  C.B. At the time, C.B. was four feet, eight inches tall and approximately seventy \n8  pounds. The CSOs placed C.B. in a physical hold, tackled him to the floor, and \n9  forced him into District-issued metal cuffs. The CSOs pulled C.B. up from the \n10  ground and attempted to sit him in a chair. Now handcuffed in a seclusion room \n11  and surrounded by three adults, C.B. became even more upset and distressed. \n12  Unable to regulate his emotions due to his disabilities, he began flailing his legs.  \n13  86.  Principal Walker then directed CSO King and CSO Owens to place \n14  separate handcuffs on C.B.’s ankles. The CSOs then immediately and \n15  simultaneously shackled C.B.’s hands and ankles with metal cuffs. C.B. remained \n16  shackled in this manner for an unknown period of time.  \n17  87.  The District suspended C.B. from school that day and his aunt came \n18  to pick him up. She was concerned and confused to find C.B. sitting in the fetal \n19  position against the wall of the seclusion room. His aunt observed that C.B.’s arms \n20  were hugging his knees and his head was down. C.B. was not wearing a shirt, \n21  which had come off during the CSOs’ interaction with him. A desk was blocking \n22  the door to the seclusion room. C.B. and his aunt helped school staff clean up the \n23  seclusion room, and then she took him home.  \n24  88.  No District staff told C.B.’s aunt that CSOs had physically tackled \n25  C.B. and then handcuffed and leg-cuffed him. District staff never told C.B.’s \n26  parents of the incident either.   \n27  89.  Defendants’ actions, inter alia, violated District policies prohibiting \n28  staff from using mechanical restraints that simultaneously immobilize all four \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 20 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 23 of 52   Page ID\n#:1089\n \n \n1  extremities.  \n2  90.  The District also failed to provide an Incident Report to C.B.’s \n3  parents. In November 2019, counsel made a request to the District for a full and \n4  complete copy of C.B.’s educational records. Only after counsel received the \n5  records did C.B.’s parents learn that the CSOs shackled C.B.’s hands and ankles. \n6  The District provided C.B. with CSO King’s and CSO Owens’ witness statements, \n7  which were missing at least two pages. Further, the District did not provide a \n8  witness statement from Principal Walker. As of the date of this filing, the District \n9  has not provided the missing statements and pages.  \n10  91.  On information and belief, the District did not document the incident \n11  or adequately investigate, train, supervise, or discipline the staff involved. \n12  Mechanical Restraint No. 3: On October 8, 2019, school police officers tackled \n13  and handcuffed C.B. while pressing a knee into his back \n14  92.  On October 7, 2019, C.B. allegedly threw a rock in the general \n15  direction of CSO Manuel Arellano. No one from the District informed C.B.’s \n16  parents about this incident on the day that it allegedly occurred. According to a \n17  police report dated October 8, 2019, sometime after school hours on October 7, \n18  2019, an unidentified District staff member requested that Deputy Norma Loza  \n19  intervene and “investigate” the alleged rock throwing incident.20 \n20  93.  On October 8, Deputy Loza and CSO Arellano arrived at C.B.’s \n21  special education classroom to investigate the alleged rock-throwing from the day \n22  before. At no time prior to involving the CSOs and SROs did anyone with the \n23  District attempt to arrange a meeting with C.B. with his parents present.  \n24  94.  Unlike the other incidents where school police officers handcuffed \n25  C.B., Deputy Loza’s body camera partially captured the October 8, 2019, \n26 \n \n27 \n20 On information and belief, the unidentified District staff member is CSO Arellano. The police report states an \nindividual (name redacted) contacted Deputy Loza on October 7, 2019, and alleged that C.B. threw a rock in his \n28 \ndirection earlier that day. Separately, on October 7, 2019, CSO Arellano added a behavior log entry in C.B.’s \npupil file alleging he threw the rock. No one created a log entry documenting the restraints on October 8, 2019. \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 21 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 24 of 52   Page ID\n#:1090\n \n \n1  incident.21 At C.B.’s counsel’s request, the Sheriff’s Department produced a video \n2  that is approximately eight minutes long. On information and belief, Deputy Loza \n3  shut off her body camera before the incident concluded, violating Sheriff’s \n4  Department policy and leaving the remaining hour of the incident unfilmed.  \n5  95.  Based on the review of the available Department footage, immediately \n6  upon entering C.B.’s classroom, Deputy Loza directed the teacher (name unknown) \n7  to remove the other students from the classroom. This left C.B. alone with Deputy \n8  Loza and CSO Arellano. C.B. sat motionless at his desk with his head down.  \n9  96.  Deputy Loza stood over C.B. and said, “You’re going to go to the \n10  office, no matter what. Either you go, cooperating, or I’m going to take you to the \n11  office.” Neither Deputy Loza nor CSO Arellano explained why they were asking \n12  him to go to the office. C.B. kept his head down and quietly said he was not going. \n13  For thirty seconds, Deputy Loza repeated different variations of “do you \n14  understand you are going to the office?” but never explained why. C.B. remained \n15  completely still, repeating that he was not going at a barely audible volume.  \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBody Camera Image: C.B. sits with his head down while Deputy Loza demands \n26  he go to the office \n27 \n \n28 \n21 A true and correct copy of the October 8, 2019, body camera footage is incorporated by reference as \nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 2.

After less than ninety seconds, Deputy Loza grabbed the back of \n2  C.B.’s sweatshirt and physically pulled him out of his seat. She then passed C.B. to \n3  CSO Arellano. While CSO Arellano twisted the four foot, eight inch boy’s wrists \n4  behind his back to try and force handcuffs on him, Deputy Loza repeated, “You are \n5  going to the office.” Again, consistent with his disabilities and behavior that they \n6  had seen him exhibit before, C.B. swore and stated that he was not going. The \n7  officers then tackled C.B., pinned him to the ground, and pressed him face down \n8  into the floor. He screamed out in pain: “Ow! My knee!” CSO Arellano then dug \n9  his own knee into C.B.’s back, and Deputy Loza placed him in handcuffs. Neither \n10  officer spoke to C.B. about his legal rights.  \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \nBody Camera Image: CSO Arellano puts his knee into C.B.’s back while Deputy \n22  Loza places C.B. in handcuffs\n \n23  98.  The Sheriff’s Department footage also shows that while the two \n24  officers pinned C.B. on the ground, Deputy Loza threatened him by stating that if \n25  he moved then the handcuffs were “going to get tight on [him].” While C.B.’s \n26  hands are out of frame, a distinct clicking can be heard on video for about thirty \n27  seconds, as Deputy Loza presumably followed through with her threat and \n28  tightened C.B.’s handcuffs. C.B. wiggled on his stomach briefly and swore, \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 23 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 26 of 52   Page ID\n#:1092\n \n \n1  behavior consistent with his disabilities and of being physically and mechanically \n2  restrained and having handcuffs tightened. He then laid still on the ground, \n3  facedown and handcuffed. Deputy Loza radioed an unknown person and stated: “I \n4  have one juvenile detained. He’s being uncooperative.” \n5  99.  The Sheriff’s Department footage then shows Deputy Loza and CSO \n6  Arellano pulling C.B. to his feet and pushing him towards the classroom door, \n7  while C.B. squirmed and cried out to be let go. The officers again physically forced \n8  C.B. face down onto the floor. Another CSO then arrived (the “second CSO”).22 \n9  The second CSO told C.B. that he should “relax.” At one point while CSO \n10  Arellano held C.B. facedown, Deputy Loza stood over him and accused him of \n11  kicking. The video does not show C.B. kicking anyone in frame.   \n12  100.  The officers surrounded C.B. and held him face-down on the floor for \n13  almost two minutes. The video shows Deputy Loza, CSO Arellano, and the second \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nBody Camera Image: Unknown CSO twists C.B.’s leg and pushes it into the \n25 \nground. CSO Arellano and Deputy Loza are to the left holding C.B. down.\n \n26 \n \n22 On information and belief, the second CSO was Demetrius Owens. CSO Arellano is heard on video using his \n27 \nradio to ask someone he refers to as “Owens” to come assist in the classroom. About thirty seconds later, the \nvideo shows the second CSO entering the classroom. Owens was a CSO assigned to Landmark at the time of the \n28 \nincident. He also handcuffed C.B. on August 26, 2019, along with CSO King. \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 24 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 27 of 52   Page ID\n#:1093\n \n \n1  CSO pull him up to a seated position on the floor. Still handcuffed, C.B. cried out \n2  as CSO Arellano pressed down on his shoulders. The second CSO also held C.B. \n3  down. The video shows this person twisting C.B.’s leg and using both arms and his \n4  body weight to press C.B.’s calf into the ground.  \n5  101.  C.B. was visibly in pain and cried, “Let me go! Let me go!” While \n6  immobilizing C.B.’s hands, shoulders, and leg, the two male CSOs repeated: “If \n7  you calm down, we calm down. You calm down, we calm down.” C.B. – a child \n8  with known behavioral and emotional disabilities – was  unable to “calm down” \n9  while handcuffed and restrained by three officers.  \n10  102.  The Sheriff’s Department footage then shows two unidentified district \n11  staff arriving, but neither took any steps to intervene. One radioed for Principal \n12  Walker to come to the classroom, but could not reach him. CSO Arellano directed \n13  her to leave the room and find Mr. Walker. All the while, C.B. remained \n14  handcuffed, immobilized on the floor. Deputy Loza stood over him, and threatened \n15  to take him to the police station if he did not calm down.  \n16  103.  After two more minutes, the video shows the second CSO releasing \n17  C.B.’s leg from his hold. The three officers then pulled C.B. into a standing \n18  position, and C.B. cried out in apparent pain. Deputy Loza said that a fourth \n19  officer, her partner, would be arriving to help them escort C.B. off campus to an \n20  awaiting police car. At that point, the body camera footage abruptly ends.  \n21  104.  Deputy Loza and her partner, Deputy Jerssy Toscano, later placed \n22  C.B. in the back of a police car. By that time, given the events that had just \n23  occurred and were continuing to occur, C.B. was experiencing worsening trauma. \n24  While locked in the back seat, C.B. reportedly stated: “I wish I was dead.” At times \n25  the deputies left C.B. alone in the locked car.  \n26  105.  While locked and handcuffed in the police car, C.B. managed to use \n27  his cell phone to call his mother. C.B.’s mother recalls that he repeatedly screamed, \n28  “Tell them to let me go!” before the phone hung up. C.B.’s mother was afraid and \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 25 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 28 of 52   Page ID\n#:1094\n \n \n1  confused; no one from the school had contacted her about these events. When \n2  C.B.’s mother called her son back, Deputy Loza answered the phone. C.B.’s \n3  mother told Deputy Loza that she was on her way to pick C.B. up from school. \n4  Deputy Loza responded that it was too late; the ambulance was coming to pick him \n5  up. However, C.B. remained in the back of the police car for nearly an hour before \n6  an ambulance arrived. During this time, other students passing by saw C.B. \n7  handcuffed in the back of the police car.  \n8  106.  At approximately 12:55 pm, the ambulance took C.B. from Landmark \n9  to Riverside’s Emergency Treatment Service facility for a 5585 evaluation.23 At the \n10  time of hospitalization, the treating psychiatrist, Dr. Alexander Tsang, and treating \n11  therapist, Shirlee Lyons, noted that C.B. presented as “selectively mute.” His \n12  distress began to decrease once his mother arrived, and they discharged him that \n13  day at around 4:00 pm. C.B. spent over half a day handcuffed, held in a police car, \n14  transported by ambulance, and psychiatrically hospitalized. \n15  107.  Days after this incident, Landmark staff handed B.T. a notice of \n16  suspension, which mentioned the alleged rock throwing incident from October 7, \n17  but not the October 8 use of physical and mechanical restraints.  \n18  108.  C.B.’s mother asked staff to provide her with more information about \n19  the school police officers restraining, handcuffing, and holding her son in a police \n20  car. Staff told C.B.’s mother that they had no information about the incident. Based \n21  on information and belief, the District failed to properly document and/or report \n22  this incident. Contrary to its own documentation and reporting procedures, the \n23  District has failed to provide C.B.’s parents with any documentation related to the \n24  October 8, 2019, restraint, handcuffing, detention, or hospitalization. To date, the \n25  District has failed to produce any written Incident Reports from its staff related to \n26  this handcuffing, even after multiple requests by counsel. Plaintiff presumes based \n27 \n \n23 Under California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5585, officers may temporarily place a minor in a \n28 \npsychiatric facility where probable cause supports that “as a result of mental disorder” the minor is: (1) a danger \nto themselves or others or “gravely disabled”; and (2) “voluntary treatment is not available.” \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 26 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 29 of 52   Page ID\n#:1095\n \n \n1  on this reasonable investigation that none exist.   \n2  109.  The Sheriff’s Department similarly failed to comply with its own \n3  documentation procedures. On information and belief, Deputy Loza turned off her \n4  body camera before the incident ended, against Sheriff’s Department policy. Also \n5  against Sheriff’s Department policy, Deputy Loza did not document her reasons for \n6  turning off her camera in a report or memorandum. In addition, despite requests \n7  from counsel, the Sheriff’s Department has not produced all body camera footage \n8  from Deputy Loza for this incident. Also, on information and belief, Deputy \n9  Toscano did not create a police report for this incident and/or the Sheriff’s \n10  Department did not produce these records. \n11  110.  The SROs violated their own Policies 306.2.3 and 324.9 when they \n12  handcuffed C.B., who was eleven years old at the time and not combative, \n13  threatening, or suspected of committing any crimes.  \n14  111.  Again, on information and belief, Defendants Moreno Valley USD \n15  and Sheriff’s Department did not document the incident or adequately investigate, \n16  train, supervise, or discipline the staff involved.  \n17  Mechanical Restraint No. 4: On December 9, 2019, school police officers \n18  handcuffed C.B. while he was already physically restrained for exhibiting \n19  disability-related behaviors. \n20  112.  After their son was restrained, handcuffed, locked in a police car, and \n21  sent for an involuntary psychiatric hold while at Landmark, C.B. and his parents \n22  were afraid for his safety and no longer wanted him to return to the same school. \n23  113.   After the October 8, 2019, incident, C.B.’s parents made the difficult \n24  decision to keep C.B. at home rather than subject him to further discrimination, \n25  harm and repeated constitutional injuries. He remained at home without any \n26  schooling for approximately five weeks. Desperate for another option, C.B.’s \n27  parents obtained an intra-district transfer permit so that C.B. could attend \n28  Mountain View Middle School (“Mountain View”). The move forced C.B. to, \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 27 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 30 of 52   Page ID\n#:1096\n \n \n1  among other things, leave his friends and social networks behind. \n2  114.  On December 9, 2019, shortly after starting at Mountain View, \n3  Deputy Loza again handcuffed C.B. after he had a disagreement with a classmate. \n4  C.B. allegedly pulled a classmate’s chair out from under him. The classmate then \n5  shoved C.B. The two children pushed each other a few times, and the teacher \n6  intervened to break it up. Unable to regulate his emotions effectively, C.B. pushed \n7  his teacher and began to throw classroom items.  \n8  115.  The teacher cleared the classroom and called for CSOs and SROs to \n9  respond. CSO Juan Ramirez and CSO Kristopher Woodside arrived first and, \n10  almost immediately, physically restrained C.B., who was displaying disability-\n11  related behaviors. CSO Woodside restrained C.B. on the ground. \n12  116.  Deputy Loza arrived next about fifteen minutes later. Contrary to \n13  Sheriff’s Department protocols, Deputy Loza did not turn on her body camera and \n14  later failed to report why she did not turn it on, despite Department procedures \n15  mandating otherwise. When Deputy Loza arrived, CSOs Ramirez and Woodside \n16  were still physically restraining C.B. Without attempting to deescalate the situation \n17  or address C.B.’s disability-related behaviors, Deputy Loza handcuffed C.B. \n18  behind his back. \n19  117.  After Deputy Loza handcuffed C.B., Deputy Toscano arrived with his \n20  body camera activated. The footage shows24 Deputies Loza and Toscano each \n21  grabbing one of CB.’s arms and walking him across the campus in front of \n22  students and staff as he repeatedly asked the deputies to take the handcuffs off, \n23  continuously yelled in pain, and shouted at least twice, “It hurts!” Upon reaching \n24  Deputy Loza’s police cruiser, Deputy Toscano walked C.B. to the left rear door \n25  and ordered C.B. to “Get inside. Sit down.” Deputy Toscano smashed C.B.’s head \n26  against the left rear door frame as he shoved C.B.’s back, causing C.B. to fall \n27 \n \n28 \n24 A true and Correct copy of the December 9, 2019, body camera footage is incorporated by reference as \nPlaintiff’s Exhibit 3. Plaintiff will file Exhibit 3 separately under seal with this Court. \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 28 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 31 of 52   Page ID\n#:1097\n \n \n1  inside the vehicle. Deputy Toscano aggressively shoved C.B. farther inside the \n2  vehicle. When C.B. stuck his leg out of the open left rear door, Deputy Toscano \n3  told Deputy Loza, who was standing outside the right rear door, to “snatch him.” \n4  Deputy Loza reached in from the right rear door and ripped C.B. backwards by his \n5  handcuffs as C.B. screamed in pain. Deputy Toscano slammed the left rear door \n6  and turned off his body camera, and Deputy Loza proceeded to transport him to the \n7  Moreno Valley Police Station.  \n8  118.  While the police held C.B. at the station, Deputy Loza decided to refer \n9  C.B. to the Emergency Treatment Services Center (ETS) for a 5585 evaluation and \n10  requested an ambulance transport. Before the ambulance got to the police station to \n11  transport C.B., his mother arrived and asked to take her son home. But Deputy \n12  Loza refused. Instead, C.B’s mother watched the officers escort her son outside the \n13  back of the police station building and into the ambulance. \n14  119.  The ambulance transported C.B. to the ETS Center. According to the \n15  official police report, an unidentified person restrained C.B. to the gurney during \n16  the ride. Hours later, C.B. finally reunited with his mother and received his \n17  discharge. This traumatic episode, which involved handcuffing, detention in a \n18  police station, physical restraint on an ambulance gurney, and a psychiatric \n19  hospitalization referral, lasted, in total, around three hours.  \n20  120.  The District later initiated expulsion proceedings against C.B. based \n21  on the initial incident with his classmate at school. On December 20, 2019, the \n22  Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) team met for a Manifestation \n23  Determination Review, a procedure required under federal law before expelling a \n24  student with a disability. The IEP team determined that C.B.’s behaviors – the \n25  same behaviors he had exhibited many times before and in each of the prior \n26  handcuffing incidents – were in fact caused by his disabilities, including ADHD \n27  and ODD. The IEP team’s determination nullified the pending expulsion charges.  \n28  121.  On information and belief, Defendants Moreno Valley USD and \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 29 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 32 of 52   Page ID\n#:1098\n \n \n1  Sheriff’s Department did not document the incident or adequately investigate, \n2  train, supervise or discipline the staff involved. \n3  122.  As a result of these four handcuffings and detentions, C.B. is now so \n4  terrified of police that when he hears they are coming to a location, even if they are \n5  not seeking him, he flees. \n6  D. Facts Regarding Systemic Discrimination \n7  Racial and Disability Disparities in Moreno Valley USD \n8  123.  C.B.’s experience highlights systemic discrimination within Moreno \n9  Valley USD. The District refers its students to law enforcement at a much higher \n10  rate than other large California school districts. In 2017-18, as reported to the Civil \n11  Rights Data Collection, the District referred 2,108 students to police or about 6.3 \n12  per 100 students. By comparison, the Los Angeles Unified School District referred \n13  just 1 student per 100. Nearby Riverside Unified School District referred just 3 \n14  students per 1,000.  \n15  124.  The District refers Black students to law enforcement at dramatically \n16  higher rates than non-Black students. In 2017-18, as reported to the Civil Rights \n17  Data Collection, Black students were 13.7% of the District’s student population \n18  but 29% of referrals to law enforcement. The District’s law enforcement referral \n19  rate for Black students is 13.5 per 100 students, more than 2.5 times its referral rate \n20  for non-Black students (5.2 per 100 students).  \n21  125.   The District’s referral rate of Black students to law enforcement is \n22  exponentially higher than the referral rates for Black students in similarly sized \n23  districts in the state:  \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 30 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 33 of 52   Page ID\n#:1099\n \n \n1 \nLaw Enforcement Referral Rates for Black Students\n2 \nSource: Civil Rights Data Collection, 2017-18 Survey \n3 \n16\n13.5\n4  14\nReferrals Per 100 Black Students\n12\n5  10\n8\n6 \n6\n4\n2.2\n7  2 1.4 0.9 0 0 0.3 1.1 1.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.9 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.2 1 0.2\n0\n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13  126.  The Sheriff’s Department’s school arrest data further show that Black \n14  students are more likely to be arrested and arrested for non-violent offenses than \n15  their non-Black peers. Of Black students arrested on campus, 78% were arrested \n16  for non-violent offenses, compared to 63% of non-Black students arrested on \n17  campus. Similarly, 46% of Black students arrested on campus are arrested for the \n18  most minor offense – being out of class during school hours – while only 37% of \n19  non-Black students are arrested for this offense.  \n20  127.  Related to the disproportionate representation of Black students in law \n21  enforcement referrals and arrests is the fact that the District disproportionately \n22  restrains Black students. Per the Civil Rights Data Collection, Black students make \n23  up 37% of all students restrained, almost three times their representation in the \n24  District. The District also disproportionately restrains students with disabilities. \n25  Students with disabilities make up 61% of all students restrained, over 3.5 times \n26  their representation in the District.  \n27  Defendants’ Discriminatory Policies, Practices, and Procedures \n28  128.  The high rates of law enforcement referrals result from Defendants’ \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 31 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 34 of 52   Page ID\n#:1100\n \n \n1  various policies, practices and procedures that allow and even encourage school \n2  police officer involvement in low-level and disability-related behaviors, even for \n3  incidents that occurred on days prior – like C.B.’s act of throwing a rock. Teachers \n4  or administrators could handle these incidents instead. \n5  129.  For example, the aforementioned “Law Enforcement Services \n6  Agreement” between the District and Sheriff’s Department that establishes the \n7  SRO program does not prohibit SROs from intervening in minor school discipline \n8  incidents. It does not outline when SROs may use restraints or handcuffs. It does \n9  not describe applicable legal protections for students with disabilities, including \n10  the requirement to provide reasonable modifications in police encounters. It does \n11  not provide for alternatives to physical restraint. \n12  130.  The Sheriff’s Department Policies grant SROs broad authority to \n13  intervene in incidents involving students, even where the student has committed no \n14  crime. Policy SRU-003 authorizes SROs to “counsel” students who are “about to \n15  engage” in criminal misconduct. This policy further allows officers to search \n16  students with only “reasonable suspicion” that the student has violated a school \n17  rule, regardless of whether there is a basis for believing that the student has \n18  violated a law or is carrying weapons or contraband. The policy allows SROs to \n19  “stop, question, interview, and take police action without the prior authorization of \n20  the principal.” Policy SRU-004 further authorizes SROs to stop, question, detain, \n21  and cite students simply for being out of class during school hours. \n22  131.  Another example is the District’s 2019-20 Secondary Sequential \n23  Discipline Standard (the “Standard”), a document that dictates the “consequences” \n24  and “interventions” to violations of the student code of conduct. The Standard \n25  authorizes, and at times requires, school staff to refer students to law enforcement \n26  in situations where California law does not.  \n27  132.  For instance, California Education Code § 48902 mandates school \n28  staff refer students to law enforcement in only limited circumstances involving \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 32 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 35 of 52   Page ID\n#:1101\n \n \n1  major offenses (e.g., assault with a firearm). But the Standard requires District \n2  staff to refer students to law enforcement in many additional circumstances, \n3  including such minor infractions as vandalism or possession of a lighter.  \n4  133.  The Standard also gives staff discretion to refer students to law \n5  enforcement for other non-criminal, low-level offenses that can be handled through \n6  the administrative discipline system or by providing supports and reasonable \n7  modifications. The Standard does not guide staff as to how to exercise their \n8  discretion in referring students to law enforcement, nor does it explain why staff \n9  might refer some students but not others.  \n10  134.  On information and belief, the District does not provide any training \n11  to its staff on how to exercise their law enforcement referral discretion, including \n12  on whether the student conduct is the result of disabilities, whether such referral \n13  will exacerbate students’ disabilities or contribute to racial disparities, and \n14  alternatives to referrals. \n15  135.  On information and belief, the Sheriff’s Department has failed to \n16  properly train SROs on interacting with students with disabilities. On information \n17  and belief, the Sheriff’s Department has also failed to properly train SROs to \n18  abstain from intervening in incidents involving minor and/or disability-related \n19  behaviors. The SROs’ treatment of C.B. shows that SROs are not appropriately \n20  trained on how to interact with students with disabilities and when to refuse to \n21  intervene in on-campus incidents.  \n22  Failure to Document Mechanical Restraints and Use of Force Incidents \n23  136.  C.B.’s experiences also reveal Defendants’ pervasive failures to \n24  accurately document incidents of restraint and use of force, and to promptly notify \n25  parents of such incidents. This practice of general applicability, inter alia, \n26  discriminates against students with disabilities who may not be able to explain \n27  what happened to them because of impaired communication abilities, trauma, or \n28  other disability-related reasons.   \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 33 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 36 of 52   Page ID\n#:1102\n \n \n1  137.  The District’s own restraint policies, supra note 18, require “all \n2  personnel” who assist in a restraint to complete their own “Incident Report” and \n3  submit it to District administrators for their review. But as described above, the \n4  District and its staff routinely violated this policy by failing to complete an \n5  Incident Report for every single one of C.B.’s handcuffings. C.B.’s parents still do \n6  not know the full extent of the CSOs’ use of force and any injuries C.B. sustained. \n7  C.B. was, and still is, unable to fully discuss or describe these traumatic events.   \n8  138.  Further, under District Board Policy 5145.11, administrators must \n9  attempt to contact the parent before allowing law enforcement to question a \n10  student. Administrators must make further attempts to contact the student’s parent \n11  before allowing law enforcement to remove a student from campus. If an SRO \n12  arrests or removes a student from campus, both Policy SRU-003 and \n13  Administrative Regulation 5145.11 require the SRO to inform the school \n14  administrator and sign the “Removal of Student from Campus” form. In C.B.’s \n15  case, the District administrator failed to create this form or make any attempt to \n16  contact C.B.’s parents in three of the four known incidents.  \n17  139.  On information and belief, Defendants District, Kedziora, and Scott \n18  are aware that CSOs violate state law and District policies by unnecessarily \n19  restraining students, including disabled students, Black students, and Black \n20  disabled students, and by failing to document and report restraints and resulting \n21  student injuries to parents, but take no steps to investigate or discipline the CSOs. \n22  140.  The Sheriff’s Department and County have failed to provide all \n23  documentation of the cuffings of C.B. involving SROs. Further, contrary to \n24  Sheriff’s Department protocols, Deputy Loza turned off her body camera early \n25  during the October 8, 2019, use of force incident. She failed to turn it on at all \n26  during the cuffing on December 9, 2019, and did not submit the required report \n27  explaining why.  \n28  141.  On information and belief, the Sheriff’s Department and County are \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 34 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 37 of 52   Page ID\n#:1103\n \n \n1  aware that SROs violate internal policies by failing to properly document use of \n2  force incidents in writing or on body camera, but fail to investigate or discipline \n3  these SROs.  \n4  FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  Unreasonable Seizure and Excessive Force in Violation of the Fourth and \n6  Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n7  (Defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, Toscano, Owens, Arellano, King, and Does 3-\n8  10) \n9  142.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n10  fully set forth herein.  \n11  143.  The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects Plaintiff \n12  C.B. against unreasonable seizures and excessive force. The Fourteenth \n13  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution extends this protection to the states.  \n14  144.  Whether a seizure is unreasonable and unconstitutional depends upon \n15  the totality of the circumstances.  \n16  145.  Defendants’ actions and failures to act described herein constituted a \n17  seizure that was objectively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances, \n18  in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \n19  146.  The seizures of Plaintiff C.B. were unreasonable in light of the totality \n20  of the circumstances, including but not limited to:  \n21  a.  C.B.’s age, size, and disabilities, including his limited ability to \n22  impose physical harms on others and limited ability to form criminal \n23  intent;  \n24  b.  That C.B. was exhibiting behavior typical of school-age children \n25  and/or related to his disabilities while at his middle school;  \n26  c.  That C.B. did not actively resist school officer intervention or attempt \n27  to flee; \n28  d.  The length of the time between the alleged behaviors and the seizures \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 35 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 38 of 52   Page ID\n#:1104\n \n \n1  (e.g., the third incident occurred more than twenty-four hours after the \n2  disciplinary incident involving C.B.);  \n3  e.  That the handcuffing incidents violated District and SRO policies and \n4  state law governing physical and mechanical restraints;  \n5  f.  The length of time of the handcuffings and detentions; and  \n6  g.  The trauma of the handcuffing and restraint techniques, including, but \n7  not limited to, from officers simultaneously shackling C.B.’s wrists \n8  and ankles, digging a knee into his back while pinning him facedown, \n9  shoving him, and yanking him by his handcuffs. \n10  147.  By engaging in the acts and failures to act described herein, \n11  Defendants Scott, Loza, Toscano, Walker, Owens, King, Arellano, and Does 3-10, \n12  acting under color of state law and with deliberate indifference, violated C.B.’s \n13  rights under the U.S. Constitution to be free from unreasonable seizures and \n14  excessive force. This includes not only their own violations in effectuating and \n15  participating in these violations but their failures to intervene to stop them despite \n16  having the opportunity to do so. \n17  148.  Defendants Walker and Scott are liable as supervisors because the \n18  actions described herein constituted culpable action or inaction in the training, \n19  supervision, and control of subordinates, acquiescence in the constitutional \n20  deprivation after a complaint/incidents was made/occurred, and showed a reckless \n21  or callous indifference to C.B.’s rights. \n22  149.  The right of C.B. to be free from unreasonable seizures and excessive \n23  force as described herein was clearly established in law at the time of the incidents \n24  alleged. As a proximate result of Defendants’ unreasonable seizure and use of \n25  excessive force, C.B. has suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional \n26  distress, pain, humiliation and exacerbation of his disabilities. C.B. continues to \n27  experience fear, distrust, and anxiety regarding law enforcement officers.  \n28  150.  C.B. is entitled to damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 36 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 39 of 52   Page ID\n#:1105\n \n \n1  reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. The conduct of \n2  Defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, Toscano, Owens, Arellano, King, and Does 3-10 \n3  was willful, wanton, malicious, and done with an evil motive and intent and a \n4  willful, conscious, and reckless disregard for the rights of the Plaintiff and \n5  therefore warrants the imposition of exemplary and punitive damages against each \n6  individual Defendant (but not the entity Defendants) in an amount adequate to \n7  punish the wrongdoers and deter future misconduct. This is in part due to the \n8  particularly troubling circumstances of this case—which involved shackling, \n9  handcuffing, detaining, shoving, and kneeling on a Black student with disabilities \n10  at his middle school campuses. Punitive damages are therefore justified. \n11  SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n12  Monell Claim, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n13  (Defendants County of Riverside and Riverside County Sheriff’s Department) \n14  151.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n15  fully set forth herein. \n16  152.  Defendants County of Riverside and Sheriff’s Department maintain \n17  and implement the following unconstitutional policies, practices, and/or customs:  \n18  a.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of SRO intervention in minor \n19  misconduct typical of school-age children and/or related to their \n20  disabilities; \n21  b.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of SRO use of excessive and \n22  unnecessary physical and mechanical restraint and other physical \n23  force on children; \n24  c.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of repeated constitutional violations \n25  that were not properly investigated and/or documented and for which \n26  the violators were not disciplined, reprimanded, or punished, and C.B. \n27  suffered constitutional injuries as a result; and  \n28  d.  A policy, practice, and/or custom of SROs failing to use their body \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 37 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 40 of 52   Page ID\n#:1106\n \n \n1  cameras, or using their body cameras improperly, during handcuffings \n2  and other use of force incidents at school. \n3  153.  These policies, practices, and customs were the moving forces in \n4  Defendants’ unreasonable seizures and use of excessive force on C.B. described \n5  above and alleged in the First Claim for Relief. Defendants’ policies, practices, and \n6  customs are frequent, consistent, and widespread, as evidenced in part by the \n7  SROs’ similar use of force on C.B. at two separate District campuses.  \n8  154.  Defendants exhibited deliberate indifference to the constitutional \n9  rights of C.B. in maintaining such policies, practices, and customs. Defendants’ \n10  practice violates the Sheriff’s Department’s own policies, including Policies \n11  306.2.3 and 324.9, and Policy SRU-003. \n12  155.  Defendants knew or should have known that maintaining such \n13  policies, practices, and customs were in violation of well-established constitutional \n14  rights of minors – especially those with disabilities – to be treated with special care \n15  by police officers. The Defendants’ policies, practices, and customs did directly \n16  result in the pattern of violations of C.B.’s constitutional rights.  \n17  156.  Further, on information and belief, Defendants Sheriff’s Department \n18  and County have failed and continue to fail to train and supervise SROs so as to \n19  prevent a pattern of lawful restraints from occurring.  \n20  157.  Defendants do not adequately train SROs on how to safely and \n21  appropriately interact with students, especially students with disabilities. \n22  Defendants failure to train in this area constitutes deliberate indifference in light of \n23  the statistical likelihood, based on national and District-level data, that SROs will \n24  disproportionately encounter students with disabilities. Defendants also do not \n25  adequately train SROs on when to abstain from intervening in incidents involving \n26  minor and/or disability-related behaviors. \n27  158.  Defendants have also failed to train and ensure compliance with state \n28  laws and internal procedures pertaining to restraints, including but not limited to \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 38 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 41 of 52   Page ID\n#:1107\n \n \n1  restrictions on the physical and mechanical restraint of children with and without \n2  disabilities, documentation and parent notification requirements for restraint and \n3  injury, and proper body camera procedures.   \n4  159.  Despite evidence that SROs routinely disregard state laws and internal \n5  procedures, Defendants have failed to investigate, discipline, and terminate officers \n6  who unlawfully restrain children and fail to document these restraints in police \n7  reports and on body camera footage. \n8  160.  As a proximate result of Defendants’ acts and omissions, C.B. has \n9  suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional distress, pain, and exacerbation \n10  of his disabilities. C.B. continues to experience fear, distrust, and anxiety regarding \n11  law enforcement officers.  \n12  161.  C.B. is entitled to damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and \n13  reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  \n14  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15  VIOLATIONS OF TITLE II OF THE ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 \n16  (Defendants Moreno Valley USD, Superintendent Kedziora, County of Riverside, \n17  and Sheriff’s Department) \n18  162.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n19  fully set forth herein.  \n20  163.  Congress enacted the ADA to “to provide a clear and comprehensive \n21  national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with \n22  disabilities” and “clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \n23  discrimination against individuals with disabilities.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)-(2). \n24  164.  Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a \n25  disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or \n26  be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \n27  be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132.  \n28  165.  C.B. is an individual with a disability under the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 39 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 42 of 52   Page ID\n#:1108\n \n \n1  12102. His disabilities substantially limit one or more major life activities, \n2  including learning, concentration, thinking, and interacting with others.  \n3  166.  As a school-age child who lives in the District, he is qualified to \n4  participate in Defendants’ educational programs and services. 42 U.S.C. § \n5  12131(2). \n6  167.  Defendants Moreno Valley USD, County of Riverside, and Sheriff’s \n7  Department are all public entities within the meaning of the ADA. Defendant \n8  Superintendent Kedziora is an official responsible for running and/or supervising \n9  the operations of Defendant Moreno Valley USD.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).   \n10  168.  Defendant Moreno Valley USD is legally responsible for all \n11  violations of the ADA committed by Defendants County and/or Sheriff’s \n12  Department in the course of performing security services to students within the \n13  District. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1). \n14  169.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants are \n15  violating the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations, 28 \n16  C.F.R. Pt. 35, including by: \n17  a.  Failing to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and \n18  procedures to avoid discrimination against C.B.;  \n19  b.  Utilizing methods of administration that have the effect of defeating \n20  or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of \n21  Defendants’ programs with respect to C.B., including using police to \n22  enforce school rules, rather than teachers and administrators; \n23  c.  Denying C.B. an opportunity to participate in and benefit from \n24  educational services that is equal to that afforded of other students.  \n25  170.  In addition, through the acts and omissions described above, the \n26  District and Superintendent Kedziora in his official capacity are violating the \n27  ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its implementing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, by: \n28  a.  Aiding or perpetuating discrimination by providing significant \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 40 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 43 of 52   Page ID\n#:1109\n \n \n1  assistance to the County and/or Sheriff’s Department, public entities \n2  that discriminate against C.B.; and  \n3  b.  Subjecting C.B. to disability-based harassment that is so severe and \n4  pervasive that it creates a hostile learning environment. \n5  171.  Defendants at all times have known or should have known that C.B. \n6  was a student with disabilities and required reasonable modifications.  \n7  172.  Defendants have demonstrated a deliberate indifference that harm to \n8  Plaintiffs’ federally protected rights under the ADA was substantially likely, and \n9  failed to act upon that likelihood.  \n10  173.  The acts and omissions of Defendants have caused and will continue \n11  to cause C.B. to suffer irreparable harm, and he has no adequate remedy at law. \n12  174.  Under the ADA, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs as \n13  appropriate and permitted by law, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205. \n14  FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15  VIOLATION OF SECTION 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq. \n16  (Defendants Moreno Valley USD, Superintendent Kedziora, County of Riverside, \n17  and Sheriff’s Department) \n18  175.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n19  fully set forth herein. \n20  176.  Section 504 provides that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \n21  disability in the United States...shall, solely by reason of [their] disability, be \n22  excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \n23  discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \n24  assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794. \n25  177.  Plaintiff C.B. is a qualified individual with a disability under Section \n26  504.  \n27  178.  Defendants are recipients of federal funds.  \n28  179.  Solely by reason of his disabilities, C.B. has been excluded from \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 41 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 44 of 52   Page ID\n#:1110\n \n \n1  participation in, denied the benefit of, and subjected to discrimination in his \n2  attempts to receive meaningful and equal access to the facilities, programs, \n3  services, and activities offered by Defendants in violation of Section 504, 29 \n4  U.S.C. § 794, et seq., and its implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. Pt. 104 (U.S. \n5  Department of Education) and 28 C.F.R. 42.501 et seq. (U.S. Department of \n6  Justice). The Defendants’ acts and omissions violating C.B.’s rights under the \n7  ADA also violate his rights under Section 504 (see Third Claim for Relief, supra). \n8  180.  Defendants have demonstrated a deliberate indifference that harm to \n9  Plaintiffs’ federally protected rights under Section 504 was substantially likely, \n10  and failed to act upon that likelihood. \n11  181.  The acts and omissions of Defendants have caused and will continue \n12  to cause C.B. to suffer irreparable harm, and he has no adequate remedy at law. \n13  182.  Under Section 504, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs \n14  as appropriate and permitted by law, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 794a. \n15  FIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n16  VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE § 11135 et seq. \n17  (County of Riverside and Sheriff’s Department) \n18  183.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the above paragraphs as though \n19  fully set forth herein. \n20  184.  California Government Code § 11135 prohibits discrimination under, \n21  and the denial of full and equal access to the benefits of, state-funded programs \n22  and activities on the basis of race, ethnicity, and disability.  \n23  185.  Violations of the ADA constitute violations of Government Code § \n24  11135(b).  \n25  186.  At all times relevant to this action, Plaintiff C.B. has been and is a \n26  qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of California law. Cal. \n27  Gov’t Code § 12926. As a Black student, C.B. is entitled to California law \n28  protections against discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity. Id. \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 42 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 45 of 52   Page ID\n#:1111\n \n \n1  187.  Defendants County of Riverside and Sheriff’s Department are public \n2  agencies that receive financial assistance from the State of California. \n3  188.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants are \n4  violating Government Code § 11135, and its implementing regulations, Cal. Code \n5  Regs. tit. 2, § 11154. Defendants discriminate against C.B. and other similarly \n6  situated Black students with respect to law enforcement referrals that result in an \n7  adverse disparate impact. Defendants selectively enforce facially neutral policies \n8  by referring Black students to police for less severe behaviors than their non-Black \n9  peers, denying Black students full and equal access to the benefits of their \n10  education without nondiscriminatory justification. Defendants disproportionately \n11  arrest Black students for minor and/or disability-related behaviors. \n12  189.  Defendants also discriminate against C.B. and other similarly situated \n13  Black students with respect to school police restraints that result in an adverse \n14  disparate impact on Black students. These disparities result in part from \n15  Defendants’ implicit and unconscious biases and stereotypes against Black \n16  students, which are incorporated into the Sheriff’s Department policy allowing \n17  SROs to handcuff children who officers perceive as “combative or threatening.” \n18  190.  Defendants have also violated Government Code § 11135 by \n19  discriminating against C.B. and other similarly situated students with disabilities in \n20  violation of the ADA (see Third Claim for Relief, supra).  \n21  191.  Defendants’ actions have caused and will continue to cause C.B. to \n22  suffer irreparable harm, and he has no adequate remedy at law. Because \n23  Defendant’s discriminatory conduct is ongoing, declaratory and injunctive relief \n24  are appropriate remedies. \n25  192.

Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, Toscano, Arellano, King, \n8  and Does 3-10 engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct when they intentionally \n9  committed the acts described herein.  \n10  195.  As a proximate result of Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, \n11  Toscano, Arellano, King, and Does 3-10’s extreme and outrageous conduct, \n12  Plaintiff C.B. has suffered severe emotional distress. \n13  196.  Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, Toscano, Arellano, King, \n14  and Does 3-10 were adults in a position of power over Plaintiff C.B. and aware of \n15  his susceptibility to injuries through emotional distress as a minor student with \n16  disabilities.  \n17  197.

The conduct of Defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, \n20  Toscano, Owens, Arellano, King, and Does 3-10 was willful, wanton, malicious, \n21  and done with an evil motive and intent and a willful, conscious, and reckless \n22  disregard for the rights of the Plaintiff and therefore warrants the imposition of \n23  exemplary and punitive damages against each individual Defendant (but not the \n24  entity Defendants) in an amount adequate to punish the wrongdoers and deter \n25  future misconduct. This is in part due to the particularly troubling circumstances of \n26  this case—which involved shackling, handcuffing, detaining, shoving, and \n27  kneeling on a Black student with disabilities at his middle school campuses. \n28  Punitive damages are therefore justified. \n \n \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES        - 44 - \n& INJUNCTIVE & DECLARATORY RELIEF \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP     Document 109     Filed 03/25/22     Page 47 of 52   Page ID\n#:1113\n \n \n1  SEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n2  FALSE IMPRISONMENT \n3  (Defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, Toscano, Owens, Arellano, King, and Does 3-\n4  10) \n5  198.

Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, Toscano, Arellano, King, \n8  and Does 3-10 intentionally and unlawfully exercised force or the implied threat of \n9  force to restrain or confine C.B. when they committed the acts described herein.  \n10  200.  Each of the known unlawful restraints and detentions of C.B. \n11  described supra lasted for an appreciable amount of time.  \n12  201.  C.B. did not consent to Defendants Scott, Walker, Owens, Loza, \n13  Toscano, Arellano, King, and Does 3-10’s acts, and as a result of their acts \n14  suffered severe harm and emotional distress. \n15  202.

Defendants Scott and Walker were responsible for the supervision of \n7  Defendants Arellano, Owens, King, and some or all of Does 3-10.   \n8  215.  Defendants Arellano, Owens, King, and some or all of Does 3-10 \n9  became unfit to perform the work for which they were hired due to their propensity \n10  to subject students to harmful and excessive detentions, handcuffings and use of \n11  physical force.  \n12  216.  The at least four known, unlawful handcuffings and detentions \n13  establish that Defendants Scott and Walker had or should have had prior \n14  knowledge of Defendants Arellano, Owens, King, and Does 3-10’s propensity to \n15  subject C.B. to harm. They also establish that the risk of harm to C.B. from \n16  Defendants Arellano, Owens, King, and Does 3-10’s actions was reasonably \n17  foreseeable.  \n18  217.  Defendants Scott and Walker’s negligence in supervising Defendants \n19  Arellano, Owens, King, and Does 3-10 was a substantial factor in causing C.B.’s \n20  harm and injuries.  \n21  218.

Stop school police officers from mechanically restraining students and \n14  intervening in low level and disability-related behaviors, up to and \n15  including ordering school police officers to cease patrolling District \n16  schools.  \n17  b.  Provide C.B. and similarly situated students with positive supports \n18  and services in lieu of police intervention so that they may enjoy full \n19  and equal access to the District’s programs.  \n20  221.  Compensatory, general, and special damages, according to proof.  \n21  222.  Award Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs as appropriate and \n22  permitted by law.  \n23  223.  For punitive and exemplary damages against individually named \n24  Defendants in an amount appropriate to punish Defendant(s) and deter others from \n25  engaging in similar misconduct. \n26  224.

No. 205) (IN CHAMBERS) \n \nBefore the Court is a motion1 for partial summary judgment filed by plaintiff C.B., by and \nthrough his guardians ad litem W.B. and B.T. (“C.B.” or “Plaintiff”).  (“Motion,” Dkt. Nos. \n205, 211.)  The Court finds this matter appropriate for resolution without a hearing.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 78; L.R. 7-15.  After considering the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the \nMotion, the Court GRANTS the Motion as to Plaintiff’s ADA and Section 504 claims.  The \nCourt VACATES the October 23, 2023 hearing.  \n \nI.  BACKGROUND \n \nC.B.2 filed his complaint on February 2, 2021 against defendants Moreno Valley Unified \nSchool District (“MVUSD”), Martinrex Kedziora, in his official capacity as MVUSD \nSuperintendent (“Kedziora”), Darryl Scott (“Scott”), Scott Walker (“Walker”), Demetrius \nOwens (“Owens”), Manuel Arellano (“Arellano”), County of Riverside (“County”), Riverside \nCounty Sheriff’s Department (“Sheriff’s Dept.”), Chad Bianco, in his official capacity as \n \n1 While Plaintiff originally filed the Motion on September 1, 2023 (Dkt. No. 205), the \nCourt refers to the Corrected Memorandum and Corrected Statement of Uncontroverted Facts \nfiled as part of Plaintiff’s notice of errata as Plaintiff’s operative motion.  (“Motion,” Dkt. No. \n211.) \n2 On February 10, 2021, the Court appointed W.B. as guardian ad litem for minor C.B. in \nthis action.  (Dkt. No. 39.)  C.B. is a minor who is twelve years old, W.B. is his father, and B.T. is \nhis mother.

No. 1.) \n \nDefendants collectively filed three motions to dismiss (“County MTD,” Dkt. No. 68, \n“Arellano MTD,” Dkt No. 69, “MVUSD MTD,” Dkt No. 70.)  On June 17, 2021, the Court \ngranted the MVUSD MTD, denied the Arellano MTD and granted in part and denied in part the \nCounty MTD.  (Dkt No. 83.)  On July 1, 2021, an answer was filed by County, Loza, and the \nSheriff’s Dept.  (Dkt. No. 87.)  On July 16, 2021, an answer was filed by Kedziora and MVUSD.  \n(Dkt. No. 91.)  The same day, an answer was filed by Arellano, Owens, Scott and Walker.  \n(Dkt. No. 92.)   \n \nOn February 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint.  \n(Dkt. No. 101.)  On February 18, 2022, County, Loza, and the Sherriff’s Dept. opposed.  (Dkt. \nNos. 103.)  On February 28, 2022, MVUSD, Kedziora, Scott, Walker, Owens, and Arellano filed \na notice of joinder to County’s opposition.  (“Joinder,” Dkt. No. 104.)  On February 28, 2022, \nPlaintiff replied.  (Dkt. No. 105.)  On March 1, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion to strike the Joinder.  \n(“Motion to Strike,” Dkt. No. 106.)  On March 17, 2022, the Court denied defendants’ Joinder \nand granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a first amended complaint.  (Dkt. No. 108.)   \n \nOn March 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, the operative complaint, \nagainst defendants.  (“FAC,” Dkt. No. 109.)  Plaintiff brings the following claims:  \n \n1.  Unreasonable seizure and excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the U.S. Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, against defendants Scott, \nWalker, Loza, Toscano, Owens, Arellano, King, and Does 3-10 (“Claim One”); \n2.

Violation of Section 504, 29 U.S.C. § 794 et seq., against defendants MVUSD, \nKedziora, County and Sheriff’s Dept. (“Claim Four”); \n5.  Violation of California Government Code § 11135 et seq., against defendants County \nand Sheriff’s Dept. (“Claim Five”); \n6.  Intentional infliction of emotional distress against defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, \nToscano, Owens, Arellano, King, and Does 3-10 (“Claim Six”); \n7.  False imprisonment against defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, Toscano, Owens, \nArellano, King, and Does 3-10 (“Claim Seven”); \n8.  Battery against defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, Owens, Arellano, King, and Does 3-\n10 (“Claim Eight”); \n9.  Assault against defendants Scott, Walker, Loza, Toscano, Owens, Arellano, King, and \nDoes 3-10 (“Claim Nine”); and \n10. Negligent supervisions against defendants Scott and Walker (“Claim Ten”). \n \nPage 2 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 3 of 22   Page ID #:7655\n(See FAC.)  Plaintiff seeks damages, injunctive, and declaratory relief.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  Plaintiff’s \nclaims stem from alleged harms resulting from at least four violent handcuffings and detentions at \nC.B.’s middle school.  (Id. ¶¶ 1-2.)  Defendants collectively answered the FAC.  (Dkt. Nos. 119, \n122, 123.)   \n \nOn September 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Motion for summary judgement as to Claims \nThree and Four against MVUSD and Kedziora (“Defendants”) along with the following \ndocuments: \n \n  Statement of Undisputed Facts (Dkt. No. 205-2); \n  Declaration of Dr. Jaime Hernandez with attached exhibits (“Hernandez Decl.,” Dkt. \nNo. 205-3);  \n  Declaration of Dr. Edward Miguel with attached exhibits (“Miguel Decl.,”Dkt. No. \n205-5); and \n  Declaration of Munmeeth K. Soni, Plaintiff’s counsel, and 31 exhibits (“Soni Decl.,” \nDkt. No. 206).   \n \nOn September 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of errata as to Plaintiff’s corrected \nmemorandum of points and authorities (“Motion,” Dkt. No. 211-1), and Plaintiff’s corrected \nstatement of undisputed facts (“PSUF,” Dkt. No. 211-2.)  On September 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed \na notice of conditional settlement between Plaintiff and defendants County, Sheriff’s Dept., \nLoza, and Deputy Sheriff Jerssy Toscano.  (Dkt. No. 212.) \n \nOn September 18, 2023, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym issued a Report and \nRecommendation which would grant Plaintiff’s request for evidentiary sanctions against \nMVUSD, Owens and King for failure to comply with discovery obligations.  (“R&R,” Dkt. No. \n213 at 1-2.)  The Court now accepts the R&R in so far as it recommends the following.  (R&R at \n18; see Dkt. No. 181 at 3-12.) \n \nIn deciding Plaintiff’s MSJ, the Court will apply an adverse inference that MVUSD’s \ntestimony regarding the following topics would have been harmful to MVUSD: \n \n1.  From January 1, 2016 to the present, [MVUSD] policies, procedures, practices, \nprotocols, and training regarding each of the following, including any \nrecommendations made to change such policies, procedures, practices, protocols, \nor trainings, and whether or not those recommendations were adopted.  As for \ntrainings, each sub-topic includes whether such training is mandatory and if so the \nfrequency with which such training must be undertaken; the duration in days \nand/or hours of such training; whether the training is conducted in-person or \nonline; and materials used in such training and/or provided to attendees, \nincluding Training Bulletins, Safety and Security Memos, Security Department \nInter-Office Communications, video or other illustrative materials.   \nPage 3 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 4 of 22   Page ID #:7656\no  The Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct and provision of ACCOMMODATIONS to STUDENTS WITH \nDISABILITIES. \n \n2.  From January 1, 2016 to the present, [MVUSD] policies, procedures, practices, \nprotocols, and training regarding each of the following, including any \nrecommendations made to change such policies, procedures, practices, protocols, \nor trainings, and whether or not those recommendations were adopted. As for \ntrainings, each sub-topic includes whether such training is mandatory and if so the \nfrequency with which such training must be undertaken; the duration in days \nand/or hours of such training; whether the training is conducted in-person or \nonline; and materials used in such training and/or provided to attendees, \nincluding Training Bulletins, Safety and Security Memos, Security Department \nInter-Office Communications, video or other illustrative materials.   \no  The Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct and provision of ACCOMMODATIONS to STUDENTS WITH \nDISABILITIES. \n \n3.  From January 1, 2016 to the present, any mechanism or program used by MVUSD \nfor tracking data on actions by MVUSD personnel, including CSOs, including but \nnot limited to uses of force, handcuffing, shackling, and/or other restraint devices; \nand the use of such data in any type of early warning system to detect potential \nconcerns about particular personnel’s use of force, handcuffing, shackling, and/or \nuse of other restraint devices on STUDENTS, including STUDENTS WITH \nDISABILITIES. \n \n4.  From January 1, 2016 to the present, any mechanism or program used by MVUSD \nfor tracking data on actions by MVUSD personnel, including CSVs, including but \nnot limited to uses of force, handcuffing, shackling, and/or other restraint devices; \nand the use of such data in any type of early warning system to detect potential \nconcerns about particular personnel’s use of force, handcuffing, shackling, and/or \nuse of other restraint devices on STUDENTS, including STUDENTS WITH \nDISABILITIES. \n \n(R&R at 18; Dkt. No. 181 at 3-12.) \n \nOn September 25, 2023, Defendants opposed the Motion.  (“Opposition,” Dkt. No. 216.)  \nIn support of the Opposition, Defendants submitted the following documents:  \n \n  Declaration of Shelley Crandall with attached exhibits (“Crandall Decl.,” Dkt. No. \n216-1); \n  Declaration of Darryl Scott with attached exhibits (“Scott Decl.,” Dkt. No. 216-3); \n  Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact (“D.

Objections,” Dkt. No. 216-6). \n \nOn October 2, 2023, Plaintiff replied.  (“Reply,” Dkt. No. 241.)  In support of the Reply, \nPlaintiff submitted the following documents:  \n \n  Plaintiff’s Response to Defendants’ Evidentiary Objections (“Pl. Response to Def. \nObjections,” Dkt. No. 241-1); \n  Evidentiary Objections (“Pl. Objections,” Dkt. No. 241-2); \n  Response to Statement of Disputed Material Facts (“PSUF Reply,” “P. Opp. \nDSUF,” Dkt. No. 241-3); \n  Declaration of Munmeeth K. Soni in support of Plaintiff’s Reply, and 8 exhibits \n(“Reply Soni Decl.,” Dkt. No. 241-4). \n \nII.  FACTS \n \nA. Evidentiary Objections \n \n“A trial court can only consider admissible evidence in ruling on a motion for summary \njudgment.”  Orr v. Bank of America, NT & SA, 285 F.3d 764, 773 (9th Cir. 2002); see Fed. R. \nCiv. Proc. 56(e).  At the summary judgment stage, district courts consider evidence with content \nthat would be admissible at trial, even if the form of the evidence would not be admissible at trial.  \nSee, e.g., Fraser v. Goodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1036 (9th Cir. 2003).  The Court considers the \nparties’ objections only where necessary and all other objections are OVERRULED AS \nMOOT.   \n \n“[O]bjections to evidence on the ground that it is irrelevant, speculative, and/or \nargumentative, or that it constitutes an improper legal conclusion are all duplicative of the \nsummary judgment standard itself” and are thus “redundant” and unnecessary to consider here.  \nBurch v. Regents of Univ. of California, 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119 (E.D. Cal. 2006); see also \nAnderson, 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (“Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will \nnot be counted.”)   At the summary judgment stage, the Court focuses on the admissibility of the \nevidence’s contents, not the admissibility of the evidence’s form.  Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. \nN.H. Ins. Co., 953 F.2d 478, 485 (9th Cir. 1991) (“[T]he nonmoving party need not produce \nevidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment.”).   \n \nThe Court denies some of the parties’ objections as “boilerplate recitations of evidentiary \nprinciples or blanket objections without analysis applied to specific items of evidence.” Doe v. \nStarbucks, Inc., 2009 WL 5183773, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 18, 2009); Amaretto Ranch Breedables \nv. Ozimals Inc., 907 F. Supp. 2d 1080, 1081 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (“This Court need not address \nboilerplate evidentiary objections that the parties themselves deem unworthy of development”); \nCommunities Actively Living Indep. & Free v. City of Los Angeles, 2011 WL 4595993, at *8 \n(C.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2011) (summarily overruling boilerplate evidentiary objections when the \ngrounds for the objections were unduly vague and overbroad).   \n \nPage 5 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 6 of 22   Page ID #:7658\nThe Court overrules virtually all of the parties’ personal knowledge and foundation \nobjections; except where otherwise noted, the evidence relied upon in the order below has a \nsufficient basis in personal knowledge and foundation to be considered.  Most of the parties’ \nhearsay objections are likewise overruled.  Declarations which contain hearsay are admissible for \nsummary judgment purposes if they can be presented in an admissible form at trial.  Fonseca v. \nSysco Food Servs. of Arizona, Inc., 374 F.3d 840, 846 (9th Cir. 2004).  Furthermore, “[i]f the \nsignificance of an out-of-court statement lies in the fact that the statement was made and not in \nthe truth of the matter asserted, then the statement is not hearsay.”  Calmat Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of \nLabor, 364 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir. 2004).  At this stage, the Court does not find the parties’ \nhearsay objections to be preclusive of the evidence submitted.   \n \nDefendants make multiple references to federal and state laws that “recognize” special \neducation students’ “violence.”  (Opposition at 9; DSUF ¶¶ 22-24, 29; Crandall Decl. ¶¶ 15-16; \nScott Decl. ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff contends that disability-related behaviors are not referred to as \n“violent” anywhere in federal or state special education or disability law and objects to this \nevidence on various grounds including that it is impermissibly prejudicial and lacks foundation.  \n(Pl. Objections ¶ 22-24, 29); Federal Rules of Evidence 403, 901.  Defendants provide no \nauthority for these assertions.  The Court agrees with Plaintiff that these claims are baseless and \nsubstantially prejudicial to Plaintiff.  As such, the Court SUSTAINS Plaintiff’s Objections to \nDSUF ¶¶ 22-24, 29.  \n \nB.  Undisputed Facts \n \n“In determining any motion for summary judgment or partial summary judgment, the \ncourt may assume that the material facts as claimed and adequately supported by the moving \nparty are admitted to exist without controversy except to the extent that such material facts are \n(a) included in the ‘Statement of Genuine Disputes’ and (b) controverted by declaration or other \nwritten evidence filed in opposition to the motion.”  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); Local Rule 56-3 \n(emphasis added).  “If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly \naddress another party’s assertion of fact, the court may consider the fact undisputed for purposes \nof the motion.”  Elguezabal v. Hwang, 2015 WL 13918496, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 21, 2015) (citing \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2)).  In many instances, Defendants fail to provide any evidence to support \ntheir dispute, the Court finds these facts undisputed.  (See, e.g., D. Opp. PSUF ¶¶ 73(c)-78(d); \n91(b)-100.)  The following material facts are sufficiently supported by admissible evidence and \nare uncontroverted.  \n \n// \n// \n// \n// \n// \n// \n// \n// \nPage 6 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 7 of 22   Page ID #:7659\n1.  Applicable Statutes and Policies \n \nMVUSD Safety and Security, Security Officer Handbook (“CSO Handbook,” Soni Decl., \nEx. 14) \n \nCHAPTER 10 USE OF HANDCUFFS POLICY \n \n10.0 PURPOSE AND SCOPE  \nThis procedure provides guidelines for handling situations involving handcuffing \nduring detentions and arrests.  \n \n10.1 HANDCUFFING POLICY  \nAlthough recommended for most arrest situations, handcuffing is a discretionary \nprocedure and not an absolute rule of the Department. When deciding whether to \nhandcuff an arrestee, officers should carefully balance officer safety concerns with \nfactors including, but not limited to the following:  \n \n  The circumstances leading to the arrest. \n  The attitude and behavior of the arrested person. \n  The age, sex, and health of the person. \n  Whether the person has a hearing or speaking disability. In such cases \nconsideration should be given, safety permitting, to handcuffing to the front \nin order to allow the person to sign or write notes.  \n  Whether the person has any other apparent disability or pregnant. It is not the \nintent of the Department to dissuade officers from handcuffing all persons \nthey believe warrant that degree of restraint, nor is it the intent of this policy \nto create the atmosphere that in order to avoid risk, an officer should \nhandcuff all persons regardless of the circumstances. In most situations \nhandcuffs should be applied with the hands behind the person.  \n \n10.3 IMPROPER USE OF HANDCUFFS  \nHandcuffing is never done to punish, to display authority, or as a show of force. \nPersons are handcuffed only to restrain their hands to ensure officer safety. When \npractical, handcuffs shall be double locked to prevent tightening which may cause \nundue discomfort or injury to the hands or wrists.  \n \n10.4 JUVENILES  \nJuveniles 14-years of age or older may be handcuffed when the act committed is of a \nfelonious nature or when their acts have amounted to crimes where the officer has a \nreasonable suspicion the suspect may have a desire to escape, injure \nthemselves/others, injure the officer, or destroy property.  \n \nJuveniles under 14-years of age generally will not be handcuffed unless their acts have \namounted to a dangerous felony or when they are of a state of mind which suggests a \nPage 7 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 8 of 22   Page ID #:7660\nreasonable probability of their desire to escape, injure themselves/others, the officer, \nor to destroy property. \n \n10.5 HANDCUFFING OF DETAINEES  \nSituations may arise where it may be reasonable to handcuff an individual who may, \nafter subsequent investigation, be released prior to arrest. Such a situation is \nconsidered a detention, rather than an actual arrest. Unless arrested, the use of \nhandcuffs on detainees should continue for only as long as is reasonably necessary to \nassure the safety of officers and others. Officers should continuously weigh the safety \ninterests at hand against the intrusion upon the detainee when deciding to remove \nhandcuffs from a detainee. When an individual is handcuffed and released without an \narrest, a written repo11 of the incident shall be made to document the details of the \ndetention and need for use of handcuffs.  \n \nOfficers must not handcuff students merely because they are directed to do so by an \nadministrator.  \n \nThe handcuffing of a person is a serious action because it restricts that person’s freedom. \n \nThere are essentially two occasions when officers may use their handcuffs to restrain a \nsuspect. They are:  \n \n1. Making a \"PRIVATE PERSON ARREST.\"  \n2. A suspect presents an \"IMMINENT THREAT TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS.\"  \n \nAn officer can make a \"private person arrest\" when:  \n \n1. A public offense is attempted or committed in his/her presence.  \n2. The pers n has committed a felony, although not committed in his/her \npresence.  \n3. A felony has in fact been committed and he/she has reasonable cause to believe \nthat the person being arrested has committed it. (See PC 83 7)  \n \nREMINDER: When making an arrest, an officer (private person) may only use the \nrestraint necessary to:  \n \n1. Effect an arrest.  \n2. Overcome resistance.  \n3. Prevent escape.  \n4. Summon assistance to make an arrest.  \n \n\"Imminent threat\" is the presence of an impending danger or harm that could occur at \nany moment. Officers must be able to describe in clear and precise language what caused \nthem to ascertain the presence of an imminent threat. This is especially important \nPage 8 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 9 of 22   Page ID #:7661\nbecause you may need this information in your written report or a later legal proceeding. \nThe fact that a suspect is \"agitated\" or making \"furtive movements\" does not constitute \nan imminent threat.  \n \nRemember: After a suspect is in custody, he/she must be turned over to law enforcement \nwithout delay. Before taking your suspect into custody, the officer will ask you the \"cause \nand circumstances\" of the arrest. \n \n(Scott Decl. Ex. A 1196-1197.) \n \n2.  C.B. \n \nC.B. is, and has been, a special education student.  (PSUF ¶ 1.)  During the relevant time \nperiod, C.B. was 70 lbs., and 4 foot 7 inches tall.  (DSUF ¶ 54.)  In 2016, at the age of seven, C.V. \nwas diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and Oppositional \nDefiance Disorder (“ODD”).  (PSUF ¶ 2.)  In March 2019, when he was in fifth grade, C.B. \nenrolled in Moreno Valley Unified School District (“MVUSD”) and most recently attended \nMoreno Valley High School (“MVHS”).  (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.)  On April 23, 2019, MVUSD provided \nC.B. with a Behavior Support Plan (“BSP”) that described C.B.’s disability-related behavioral \nchallenges.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  C.B.’s BSP from April 23, 2019 indicated that he had tendencies to \n“punch, kick, and/or bite,” and that C.B. had a tendency to become “physically aggressive.”  \n(DSUF ¶¶ 1-2.)  The BSP stated that MVUSD were to give him space to cool down, redirect \nhim, or provide positive reinforcement if C.B. kicks or bites school staff.  (PSUF ¶ 11.)   \n \nC.B. entered sixth grade in August 2019 and attended MVUSD’s Landmark Middle \nSchool (“LMS”) from August 2019 to October 8, 2019.  (Id. ¶ 6.)  Walker was the Principal at \nLMS in 2019.  (DSUF ¶ 57.)  C.B.’s BSP from April 23, 2019 was in effect when he entered LMS \nin August 2019.  (PSUF ¶ 10.)  While at LMS, C.B. was placed in the special education classroom \ncalled the “Emotional Disturbance Classroom”.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  In November 2019, C.B. transferred \nto MVUSD’s Mountain View Middle School (“MVMS”).  (Id. ¶ 7.)  At MVMS, C.B. was \nplaced in the Special Day Class-Emotional Disturbance Classroom.  (Id. ¶ 9.)   \n \n3.  Security Resource Officers \n \nMVUSD receives federal funding.  (PSUF ¶ 13.)  Kedziora is the Superintendent of \nMVUSD.  (Id. ¶ 14.)  Scott, who joined MVUSD in December 2016, directs MVUSD’s Safety \nand Security Program and oversees Campus Security Officers (“CSOs”).3  (Id. ¶¶ 15-16.)  In this \n \n3 The vast majority of Defendants’ disputes of the PSUF are on the basis that Plaintiff \n“misstates” testimony.  (See, e.g., DSUF ¶¶ 15-18, 22, 24, 35-37, 44, 44(a), 47-48; PSUF \nReply.)  Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ responses are immaterial and that “[n]othing in \nDefendants response refutes the undisputed fact set forth here.”  (Id.)  The Court has carefully \ncombed through each pincite provided by Plaintiff to support the alleged disputes and found that \n \nPage 9 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 10 of 22   Page ID #:7662\nrole, Scott is responsible for providing direct safety supervision to all schools and implementing \nsystems and protocols to keep students and staff safe while on school grounds.  (Id. ¶¶ 16(b), \n16(c).)  Scott is also responsible for MVUSD’s law enforcement contract with the County of \nRiverside and Riverside County Sheriff’s Department.  (Id. ¶ 17; DSUF ¶ 31.) \n \nPursuant to the service contract, the Sheriff’s Department provides Sheriff’s Deputies as \nSchool Resource Officers (“SROs”) assigned to schools within MVUSD.  (PSUF ¶ 91; \nDSUF ¶ 32.)  The SROs are employed and trained by the Sheriff’s Department.  (PSUF ¶ 33.)  \nScott does not supervise or train the SROs and the SROs are not under his control.  (Id. ¶ 35.)   \n \nMVUSD “specifically task[s] [SROs] to provide law enforcement services.”  \n(Id. ¶ 91(e).)  MVUSD’s Secondary Sequential Discipline Standard (“SSDS”) also recommends \n“SRO intervention” as a disciplinary consequence for several categories of disruptive student \nbehavior.  (Id. ¶ 92.)  The categories of disruptive student behavior do not make exceptions for \ndisability-related disruptive behavior.  (Id. ¶ 92(a).)  MVUSD’s SSDS does not require SROs to \nprovide disability accommodations.  (Id. ¶ 92(d).)  MVUSD provides no training to SROs.  (Id. ¶ \n93.)  MVUSD’s contract with the Sheriff’s Department does not require SROs be trained on \nspecial education laws or on accommodating students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶¶ 94-94(a).)  \nMVUSD does not have a policy to inform SROs about its students with disabilities, the \naccommodations to which students with disabilities are entitled pursuant to their IEPs, the \naccommodations to which students with disabilities are entitled pursuant to their 504 Plans or \ntheir BSPs.  (Id. ¶¶ 95-95(c).)   \n \n4.  Campus Supervisors \n \nCampus Supervisors (“CSVs”) were tasked with “monitor[ing] student behavior before \nschool, during breaks, at lunch, after school, during school and at extracurricular activities.”  (Id. \n¶ 21.)  CSVs did not have handcuffs or weapons and were prohibited from conducting student \nsearches and seizures.  (Id. ¶ 22.)  CSVs did not receive any “direct training” on how to deal \nwith the “hazard” of disabled students.  (Id. ¶ 24.)  CSVs did not receive any training on special \neducation laws or Behavior Intervention Plans.  (Id. ¶¶ 25-26.)   \n \n \nPlaintiff consistently refers to the evidence in a correct and reasonable way.  While in some \ninstances Plaintiff may use synonymous words such as “directs”, “oversees” and “supervises”, \nthe Court finds that in the context of the evidence, Plaintiff’s SUF includes reasonable and \naccurate statements, not misstatements.  In some instances, Defendants dispute Plaintiff’s SUF \non the basis of misstatement of testimony when in fact Plaintiff’s statement is an identical copy of \nDefendants’ testimony.  (See, e.g., compare “Scott is responsible for providing direct \nsupervision of safety supervision to all schools” PSUF ¶ 16(b), with “I am tasked with \nsupervising roughly 83 employees under my direct supervision, to provide direct supervision of – \nsafety supervision to all the schools in MVUSD” Soni Decl., Ex. 3 at 33:18-22; PSUF ¶¶ 16(c), \n17.)  Accordingly, the Court admonishes Defendants for baselessly disputing matters which they \nshould have reasonably known were not in dispute. \nPage 10 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 11 of 22   Page ID #:7663\n  In 2016, MVUSD CSOs began its security transition to replace CSVs with CSOs.  \n(Id. ¶ 19.)  CSVs were not required to meet the minimum requirements of the current CSO \nprogram.  (DSUF ¶ 45.)  Scott recommended and led the transition to “enhance the safety and \nsecurity of the school district” and completed the transition in July 2020.  (PSUF ¶ 30.)  To \ntransition from a CSV to a CSO, MVUSD required the employee to first undergo mandatory \ntrainings and obtain certifications.  (Id. ¶ 33.)  CSVs were required to complete a 40-hour Peace \nOfficers Standards and Training (“POST”) Certification Course, provided by the Riverside \nCounty Sheriff’s Department, on arrest, search and seizure pursuant to California Penal Code \nSection 832.  (Id. ¶¶ 34-34(a).)   \n \n5.  CSOs \n \nCSOs take a guard card training and a state-mandated course on how to interact with \nchildren as required by SB 1626.  (Id. ¶¶ 34(b)-34(c); DSUF ¶ 37.)  CSOs possess the general \nauthority to use reasonable force and use physical, mechanical, and chemical restraints “to \ndeescalate a situation.”  (PSUF ¶¶ 35-36.)  CSOs are also authorized to remove students from \nthe classroom for de-escalation purposes.  (Id. ¶ 37.)  The role of a CSO is “essentially \ndefensive,” in that they are supposed to “defend and protect.”  (Id. ¶ 38.)  CSOs make up a \n“critical component of the District’s disciplinary program,” the purpose of which is to “change \nnegative pupil behavior.”  (Id. ¶ 38(a).)  CSOs may use a restraint to “effect arrest,” “overcome \nresistance,” prevent escape,” or “secure or obtain a dangerous object.”  (Id. ¶¶ 39-39(c).)  The \nCSO use of restraint policy makes no exception for students with disabilities and does not \nacknowledge that many of the types of behaviors for which CSOs are authorized to use restraints \nmay be disability-related behaviors.  (Id. ¶¶ 40-40(a).)  CSOs have more “tools at his or her \ndisposal” than campus supervisors, including but not limited to restraints and handcuffs.  (Id. ¶¶ \n42, 44, 44(a).)  CSOs receive additional trainings on arrest and control.  (Id. ¶ 43.)  Teachers can \nrequest CSO assistance whenever they “feel they need support” such as when disabled students’ \nbehavior is “disrupting the educational process for students.”  (Id. ¶ 59.)   \n \nMVUSD does not train CSOs about the rights of students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 50.)  \nCSOs interact with students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 50(a).)  CSOs are required to treat all \nstudents the same and cannot make exceptions in their enforcement of school rules and \nregulations governing a student’s behavior on account of a student’s disability-related behavior.  \n(Id. ¶ 51.)  CSOs do not investigate the reasons behind a student’s behavior, including \nascertaining whether the behavior is the result of a disability.  (Id. ¶ 52.)  CSOs are authorized to \nuse restraints for “defensive purposes,” “to gain compliance when commands have failed and a \nphysical confrontation appears reasonable and imminent,” “to gain compliance” when \n“circumstances indicate that a verbal control would be futile,” “to gain compliance” when \ncircumstances indicate that a verbal control would endanger security, “to gain compliance” \nwhen “circumstances indicate that a verbal control” would endanger law enforcement, or “to \ngain compliance” when “circumstances indicate that a verbal control” would endanger \npersons.”  (Id. ¶¶ 62-62(e).) \n \nPage 11 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 12 of 22   Page ID #:7664\n  Through a third-party contractor named Keenan and Associates, CSOs received training \neach academic year from 2016 through 2023.  (Id. ¶ 68.)  These training programs do not cover \ndisability-specific accommodations or behavioral interventions.  (Id. ¶ 69.) \n \n6.  Use of restraints on C.B.  \n \nDuring this time period, MVUSD CSOs and/or SROs used restraints on C.B. on multiple \noccasions, the parties’ account of which informs the basis of C.B.’s remaining claims.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  \nMVUSD employees and/or Riverside County Sheriff’s deputies restrained C.B. on August 26, \n2019.  (Id. ¶ 101.)  MVUSD employees and/or Riverside County Sheriff’s deputies restrained \nC.B. on October 8, 2019.  (Id. ¶ 101(a).)  MVUSD employees and/or Riverside County Sheriff’s \ndeputies restrained C.B. on December 9, 2019.  (Id. ¶ 101(b).)   \n \nArellano became a CSO in 2017.  (Id. ¶ 31.)  Arellano was a CSO at LMS when C.B. \nattended LMS.  (Id. ¶ 86(a).)  When Arellano was a CSO at LMS, he was never informed about \nC.B.’s disabilities, C.B.’s disability-related behaviors, or what accommodations C.B. required \npursuant to C.B.’s Behavior Support Plan.  (Id. ¶¶ 86(b)-86(d).)  Arellano testified that he had \nnever seen the CSV Handbook.  (Id. ¶ 28.)  Arellano was constantly called into C.B.’s special \neducation classroom by C.B.’s teacher to remove C.B. due to C.B.’s disruptive behavior.  (Id. ¶ \n81.) \n \nCSOs and SROs were never given C.B.’s BSP when responding to his disability-related \nbehavior.  (Id. ¶ 101(c).)  CSOs and SROs never requested C.B.’s BSP when responding to his \ndisability-related behavior.  (Id. ¶ 101(d).)  CSOs and SROs never implemented C.B.’s BSP when \nresponding to his disability-related behavior.  (Id. ¶ 101(e).) \n \n7.  CSV Handbook \n \n  The CSV Handbook outlines a verbal technique called “Verbal Judo,” which is an \nundescribed “communication technique” that claims to “redirect aggression into positive \nenergy.”  (Id. ¶ 70.)  Verbal Judo does not account for a student’s disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 71(a).)  The \nCSO Handbook outlines a “tactical five-step process” before using restraints, in which CSOs ask \nfor compliance, explain their reasoning, present “options,” ask if the officers can do something \nto gain cooperation, and then “act!!”  (Id. ¶ 70(a).)  The CSO Handbook’s “tactical five-step \nprocess” does not make exceptions for disabled students or account for a student’s disabilities.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 71(b)-71(c).)   \n \n8.  CSO Handbook \n \nFrom January 2016 to January 2021, CSOs relied on the CSV Handbook and followed \nMVUSD Board Policies.  (Id. ¶¶ 45-54.)  The CSV Handbook contained guidelines that provided \ngeneral best practices based on the Education Code and MVUSD Board Policies.  (Id. ¶ 46.)   \n \nPage 12 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 13 of 22   Page ID #:7665\nThe CSO Handbook contains MVUSD’s current policies, procedures, rules, and \nguidelines that CSOs must follow.  (Id. ¶ 48.)  The CSO Handbook authorizes CSOs to use \nrestraints, including on a student when the student attempts to escape, on a student when the \nstudent attempts to destroy property, or for any act of physical aggression, even if the student \ndoes not pose an imminent threat.  (Id. ¶¶ 56-56(c).)  The CSO Handbook directs CSOs to apply \na “good rule of thumb” when using handcuffs, which is to “only handcuff when it serves a \nreasonable purpose.”  (Id. ¶ 49.)  The CSO Handbook authorizes CSOs to remove a student \nfrom the classroom, including when a CSO determines “the student has created, or is creating, \nan unsafe condition,” at the request of faculty, classroom staff or administrator, or for “acts of \ndefiance.”  (Id. ¶¶ 55(b)-55(e), 57.)  CSOs can use restrains when a student engaging in acts of \ndefiance does not consent to being removed from the classroom.  (Id. ¶ 65.)  The CSO Handbook \ninstructs CSOs that an argument between a teacher and student could potentially rise to a \nscenario under which a “private person arrest” is warranted.  (Id. ¶ 64.)   \n \nThe CSO Handbook does not instruct CSOs to determine any information about the \nstudent or their potential disability where an argument between a teacher and student could rise \nto a scenario of making a private arrest.  (Id. ¶ 64(a).)  When asked about the role of CSOs in \naccommodating disabled students, Scott testified only that CSOs must “provide a safe and \nsecure learning environment for all students and staff.”  (Id. ¶ 72.) \n \nThe handcuffing policy does not require CSOs to investigate the reason behind an \nindividual’s behavior, whether an individual’s disability is the reason behind the individual’s \nbehavior, or whether an individual is exhibiting disability-related behavior.  (Id. ¶¶ 66-66(b).)  \nBeyond MVUSD employee’s general requirement to provide accommodations under the ADA, \nthere is no MVUSD policy that requires CSOs to provide disability-specific accommodations to \nprevent removal.  (Id. ¶ 67.)  There is no MVUSD policy that outlines how CSOs should provide \ndisability-specific accommodations to prevent the use of restraints.  (Id. ¶ 67(a).)   \n \nThe CSO Handbook does not include a policy requiring CSOs to provide \naccommodations to students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 82.)  The word accommodation does not \nappear anywhere in the CSO Handbook.  (Id. ¶ 82(a).)  The CSV Handbook does not include a \npolicy requiring CSVs to provide accommodations to students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 83.)  The \nword accommodation does not appear anywhere in the CSV Handbook.  (Id. ¶ 83(a).)  MVUSD \nBoard Policies do not have a policy requiring CSOs to provide accommodations to students with \ndisabilities.  (Id. ¶ 84.)  MVUSD Board Policies do not have a policy on the use of restraints by \nCSOs.  (Id. ¶ 84(a).)  CSOs must enforce District rules against all students with no consideration \nof whether the student is disabled.  (Id. ¶ 85.)   \n \nThe CSO Handbook makes removal the default response for all students, regardless of \nwhether they have a disability.  (Id. ¶ 104.)  The CSO Handbook does not outline alternatives to \nremoval.  (Id. ¶ 105.)  The CSO Handbook states officers should “[e]nforce school disciplinary \nprocedures” and “escort students.”  (Id. ¶ 107.) \n \n// \nPage 13 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 14 of 22   Page ID #:7666\n9.  MVUSD Training – Responding to Students with Disabilities \n   \n  MVUSD does not train CSOs about the rights of students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 50.)  \nFrom 2016 to present, MVUSD has not provided any training to CSOs on how to identify \ndisabled students.  (Id. ¶ 73.)  From 2016 to present, MVUSD has not provided any training to \nCSOs on how to provide disability-specific accommodations.  (Id. ¶ 73(a).)  From 2016 to \npresent, MVUSD has not provided any training on how to identify disabled students’ disability-\nrelated behavior.  (Id. ¶ 73(b).)  From 2016 to present, MVUSD has not provided any training to \nCSOs on how to provide de-escalation strategies for disabled students.  (Id. ¶ 73(c).)   \n \nMVUSD training does not address or account for any of the following instances:  \n  Whether the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal \nwhen defiance is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102.)   \n  Whether the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal \nwhen resistance is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102(a).)   \n  Whether the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal \nwhen escape is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102(b).)   \n  Whether the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal \nwhen physical aggression is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102(c).)   \n  How the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal when \ndefiance is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102(d).)   \n  How the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal when \nresistance is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102(e).)  \n  How the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal when \nescape is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102(f).)   \n  How the officers should respond differently than using restraint or removal when \nphysical aggression is exhibited by students with disabilities.  (Id. ¶ 102(g).) \n \nMVUSD policy does not prohibit staff from referring students with disabilities to CSOs \nor SROs for removal from the classroom.  (Id. ¶¶ 58-58(a).)  MVUSD does not train staff on \nwhen to refer disabled students to CSOs or SROs.  (Id. ¶¶ 58(b)-58(c).)  MVUSD follows a use \nof restraint continuum policy which begins with the least intrusive restraint of a “uniformed \npresence” and escalates to using “empty hand control holds” or “impact weapons.”  (Id. ¶ 61.)   \n \n10. MVUSD Policy – Sharing Information about Students’ Disabilities \n \n  MVUSD policy forbids MVUSD staff from informing CSOs about a student’s disability.  \n(Id. ¶ 74.)  MVUSD policy forbids MVUSD staff from informing CSOs about required \naccommodations listed in a student’s Individualized Education Plan.  (Id. ¶ 74(a).)  MVUSD \npolicy forbids MVUSD staff from informing CSOs about required accommodations listed in a \nstudent’s Section 504 Plan.  (Id. ¶ 74(b).)  MVUSD policy forbids MVUSD staff from informing \nCSOs about accommodations listed in a student’s Behavior Support Plan.  (Id. ¶ 74(c).)  \nMVUSD does not have any policy requiring school staff to share accommodations.  (Id. ¶ 75.)  \nMVUSD does not have any policy requiring school staff to share supports identified in students’ \nPage 14 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 15 of 22   Page ID #:7667\nIndividualized Education Plan with CSOs.  (Id. ¶ 75(a).)  MVUSD does not have any policy \nrequiring school staff to share Section 504 Plans with CSOs.  (Id. ¶ 75(b).)  MVUSD does not \nhave any policy requiring school staff to share Behavior Support Plans with CSOs.  (Id. ¶ 75(c).)   \n \n11. CPI Training \n   \n  In 2021, MVUSD began providing CSOs with training on de-escalation strategies through \nthe Crisis Prevention Institute (“CPI”) for the first time.  (Id. ¶ 76.)  CPI trainings do not \ninclude de-escalation strategies specific to disability accommodations.  (Id. ¶ 77(a).)  CPI \ntrainings do not include disability-specific interventions such as identifying disability-related \nbehaviors.  (Id. ¶ 77(b).)  CPI trainings do not include disability-specific interventions such as \ndifferential reinforcement strategies.  (Id. ¶ 77(c).)  CPI trainings do not include trainings on how \ndisability-related behaviors escalate.  (Id. ¶ 77(d).)  CPI trainings do not make exceptions for \ndisabled students when responding to disabled students who are “verbally aggressive.”  (Id. ¶ \n79(a).) \n  \n12. Disproportionate Impact \n \nMVUSD data shows disproportionate use of restraints on students with disabilities \ncompared to their non-disabled peers.  (Id. ¶¶ 87, 97.)  MVUSD’s data shows that students with \ndisabilities are disproportionately referred to law enforcement.  (Id. ¶¶ 88, 99.)  In 2018-2019, \nMVUSD’s data shows students with disabilities were 2.6 times more likely to be restrained than \ntheir non-disabled peers.  (Id. ¶ 98.)  In the same year, Black students with disabilities were 3.26 \ntimes more likely to be restrained than their non-disabled peers.  (Id. ¶ 98(a).)  In 2019-2020, the \ndata shows that students with disabilities were more than 8.90 times more likely to be restrained \nthan their non-disabled peers.  (Id. ¶ 98(b).)  The same year, Black students with disabilities were \n3.81 times more likely to be restrained than their non-disabled peers.  (Id. ¶ 98(c).)  The rates of \ndisproportionality for the use of restraints exceeds the 3.0 threshold established by the California \nDepartment of Education.  (Id. ¶ 98(d).)   \n \nDuring the 2018-2019 school year, students with disabilities were 8.97 times more likely \nto be referred to law enforcement than their non-disabled peers.  (Id. ¶ 99(a).)  The same year, \nBlack students with disabilities were more than 3.48 times more likely to be referred to law \nenforcement than their non-disabled peers.  (Id. ¶ 99(b).)

ADA Standard of Care \n \nThe standard of care under the ADA and Section 504 requires that CSOs and SROs \nreceive training on the functions of disability-related behavior.  (Id. ¶ 108.)  The standard of care \nunder the ADA and Section 504 requires that CSOs and SROs receive training on how disability-\nrelated behavior escalates.  (Id. ¶ 108(a).)  The standard of care under the ADA and Section 504 \nrequires that CSOs and SROs receive training on clinically proven strategies for reducing \ndisability-related behavior and incentivizing desired behavior to prevent removals and restraints.  \n(Id. ¶ 108(b).)  Removal has been “clinically proven to be harmful” for students with disabilities.  \n(Id. ¶ 109.)  Removal is “not a behavioral accommodation [when used] before the student hits \ntheir peak and becomes physically aggressive.”  (Id. ¶ 109(a).)   \n \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The \nmoving party has the initial burden of identifying the elements of the claim or defense and \nevidence that it believes demonstrates the absence of an issue of material fact.  See Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  The moving party must show that “under the governing \nlaw, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986). \n \nIf the moving party has sustained its burden, the non-moving party must then show that \nthere is a genuine issue of material fact that must be resolved at trial.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324.  \nThe non-moving party must make an affirmative showing on all matters placed at issue by the \nmotion as to which it has the burden of proof at trial.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322; Anderson, 477 \nU.S. at 252.  “This burden is not a light one.  The non-moving party must show more than the \nmere existence of a scintilla of evidence.”  In re Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th \nCir. 2010) (citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252).   \n \nA genuine issue of material fact exists “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could \nreturn a verdict for the non-moving party.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  When deciding a motion \nfor summary judgment, the court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party.  Barlow v. Ground, 943 F.2d 1132, 1134 (9th Cir. 1991).  Thus, summary judgment \nfor the moving party is proper when a “rational trier of fact” would not be able to find for the \nnon-moving party.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 599 \n(1986).  Plaintiffs “seeking summary judgment on a claim must offer evidence sufficient to \nsupport a finding upon every element of [their] claim other than elements admitted by the \ndefendants.”  Barnes v. Sea Hawaii Rafting, LLC, 889 F.3d 517, 537 (9th Cir. 2018).  “It is \nordinarily a heavy burden.”  Id. at 538. \n \n// \n// \n// \nPage 16 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 17 of 22   Page ID #:7669\nIV.  DISCUSSION \n \nThis Motion arises out of instances in which C.B., a small ten-year-old Black student with \ndocumented disabilities, was restrained at school on numerous occasions for exhibiting disability-\nrelated behavior.  (Motion at 6.)  Plaintiff argues that these instances are discriminatory results of \nMVUSD’s policies which permit CSOs and SROs to restrain, remove, and refer students with \ndisabilities to law enforcement without considering the student’s disabilities and violate the ADA \nand Section 504’s requirement to treat disabled student equitably.  (Id.)  Discrimination against \nstudents with disabilities is a serious and pervasive issue in our education system, and the Court \ndoes not take this Motion lightly.  The Court agrees that MVUSD’s methods of administration in \nmaintaining its police program violate the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  As \nsuch, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion as to Claim \nThree and Four.   \n \nTo prove a claim of discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must establish: (1) he is \n“qualified individual with a disability;” (2) he was either excluded from participation in or \ndenied the benefits of a public entity’s services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise \ndiscriminated against by the public entity; and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or \ndiscrimination was by reason of his disability.  (Reply at 3); Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d \n1124, 1135 (9th Cir. 2001). One way Plaintiff can establish the second and third elements of his \nADA claim is by showing that Defendants utilize a “criteria or methods of administration” that \nhas the effect or tendency of excluding disabled students like him.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(b)(3).   \n \nA claim under Section 504 is composed of identical elements and applies to any public \nprogram that receives federal financial assistance.  Duvall v. Cty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d at 1135; see \nalso Wong v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 193 F.3d 807, 816 (9th Cir. 1999). \n \nPlaintiff brings the Motion on the assertion that there is no genuine dispute of material \nfact that (1) Plaintiff is disabled, (2) MVUSD utilizes “methods of administration” under 28 \nC.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3) and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3), which “have the effect of subjecting qualified \nindividuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability” under 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(b)(8) and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(1) because they cause disproportionate restraints of \ndisabled students and (3) MVUSD receives federal financial assistance.  (See Motion.)  \nSpecifically, Plaintiff argues that MVUSD unlawfully applies the following policies, practices, \nand customs through the CSOs and the SROs: (1) MVUSD authorizes CSOs to remove and \nrestrain students but neither directs not authorizes CSOs or SROs to account for students with \ndisabilities or otherwise require accommodations; (2) MVUSD fails to train its CSOs and SROs \nabout the needs of students with disabilities and appropriate accommodations or behavioral \ninterventions; and (3) MVUSD directs its classroom and other school staff to refer students with \ndisabilities to unqualified CSOs and SROs for disability-related behaviors.  (Motion at 19.)  \nPlaintiff argues that the effect of these policies has resulted in the disproportionate and \ndiscriminatory use of removal and physical restraints, and law enforcement referrals as a \nresponse to disability-related behaviors.  (Id.) \n \nPage 17 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 18 of 22   Page ID #:7670\nDefendants fail to make any sound legal arguments to directly dispute Plaintiff’s claims, \nnor do Defendants raise any genuine material disputed facts.  (See Opposition.)  Instead, \nDefendants argue that other state and federal laws, such as the IDEA, “directly address the \nissues” and should preclude summary judgment here.  (Opposition at 1-3.)  Defendants argue \nthat Plaintiff has not met his burden under the ADA and Section 504 because (1) Plaintiff has not \nexhausted his remedies under the IDEA, and (2) Plaintiff has not provided competent expert \ntestimony that MVUSD’s policies, procedures and training for security and law enforcement \npersonnel fall below the standard of care as to students with disabilities.  (Opposition at 13-15.)  \nThe Court address each argument below. \n \nA.  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment of his ADA and \nSection 504 claims because he has not first “show[n] that he exhausted the procedures for \n[resolution] under the IDEIA.”  (Opposition at 14.)  The Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. guarantees individually tailored educational services, \nwhile Title II of the ADA and Section 504 promise non-discriminatory access to public \ninstitutions.  Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools, 580 U.S. 154, 170-71 (2017).   \n  \nDefendants’ reliance on Fry is misplaced.  In fact, Fry supports Plaintiff’s position, not \nDefendants’.  (See Opposition at 13-14.)  The Court finds that Defendants’ singular quote from \nFry is an attempt to mislead the Court, a poor attempt at advocacy, or both.  Defendants’ \nargument that 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l) provides a blanket exhaustion requirement for all ADA and \nSection 504 claims is incorrect and wholly ignores the lengthy reasoning and analysis in Fry.  \n(Opposition at 13-14); see Fry, 580 U.S., at 154.  While instances exist in which ADA and Section \n504 claims require exhaustion under the IDEA, this is not one of them.   \n \nIn Fry, Plaintiffs brought claims under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 on behalf of \ntheir daughter who was denied the use of a service-dog in elementary school.  Id.  The Court \nconsidered Section 1415(l), which added a “carefully defined exhaustion requirement” to the \nIDEA.  Id. at 161.  Section 1415(l) exhaustion can be required in ADA cases without IDEA claims, \nhowever the exhaustion rule “hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a “free \nappropriate public education” (“FAPE”).  Id. at 168.  A FAPE comprises “special education and \nrelated services”—both “instruction” tailored to meet a child’s “unique needs” and sufficient \n“supportive services” to permit the child to benefit from that instruction.  Id. at 158.  Fry \nconsidered the following factors when determining whether a plaintiff’s ADA claim required \nexhaustion under the IDEA: (1) whether the gravamen of a plaintiff’s complaint seeks relief for \nthe denial of an appropriate education, (2) whether a hearing officer would be able to make a \ndecision on a request for substantive relief, (3) whether a plaintiff has previously invoked the \nIDEA’s formal procedures to handle the dispute.  Id. at 166-73.  Further, Fry offered two \nhypothetical tests to help determine whether the gravamen of a disability discrimination \ncomplaint is really FAPE-related: (1) whether the same claim could be brought against another \npublic entity that is not a school, such as a theater or library; and (2) whether an employee or \nother adult could bring the same claim against the school.  Id. at 171-74.  “If, in a suit brought \nPage 18 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 19 of 22   Page ID #:7671\nunder a different statute, the remedy sought is not for the denial of a FAPE, then exhaustion of \nthe IDEA’s procedures is not required.”  Id. at 168.   \n \nHere, Plaintiff does not seek relief for the denial of an appropriate education, but relief for \ndiscrimination, irrespective of the IDEA’s FAPE obligation.  See id. at 171.  Plaintiff’s ADA and \nSection 504 discrimination claims challenge MVUSD’s methods of administration in maintaining \nits school police program and “sweep more broadly” than the IDEA.  (Reply at 10); see Smith v. \nOrcutt Union School District, 2021 WL 527124 at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 10, 2021) (finding that the \ngravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint concerned disability-based discrimination, not the denial of a \nFAPE.)  Additionally, multiple cases hold that non-school public entities must provide disability-\nspecific alternatives to force and law enforcement.  (Reply at 10-11); see, e.g., Sheehan v. City & \nCounty of San Francisco, 743 F.3d 1211, 1232-33 (9th Cir. 2014), rev’d on other grounds, 575 U.S. \n600 (2015) (holding that the ADA and Section 504 applied to a city’s police services and officers \nwere required to reasonably accommodate the plaintiff’s disability); Estate of Saylor v. Regal \nCinemas, Inc., 54 F. Supp. 3d 409, 427 (D. Md. Oct. 16, 2014) (accepting a disability \ndiscrimination claim under the ADA where the county failed to train its sheriff deputies to \nprovide disability accommodations).  The Court finds that the gravamen of Plaintiff’s complaint \nconcerns disability-based discrimination, not the denial of a FAPE.  Accordingly, exhaustion \nunder the IDEA is not required. \n \nDefendants admit that CSOs and SROs do not participate in IEP meetings, nor do CSVs.  \n(Opposition at 5.)  Defendants’ argument that special education staff receives training before \nbeing hired into MVUSD is immaterial here.  (Opposition at 5-6.)  Defendants argue that CSOs \nare required to complete “annual training for anti-harassment and anti-discrimination” but fail to \npoint to any disability-specific training or policy that would comply with the ADA and Section \n504 requirements.  (Opposition at 6.)    \n \n  The Court rejects Defendants’ additional arguments related to standard of care under the \nIDEA and state education law, and training outside the scope of MVUSD because they are \nimmaterial to the instant Motion.  (Opposition at 15-16.)  \n \nB.  ADA (Claim Three) \n \nTo make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff must establish: \n(1) he is “qualified individual with a disability;” (2) he was either excluded from participation in \nor denied the benefits of a public entity’s services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise \ndiscriminated against by the public entity; and (3) such exclusion, denial of benefits, or \ndiscrimination was by reason of his disability.  Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1135 \n(9th Cir. 2001). One way Plaintiff can establish the second and third elements of his ADA claim is \nby showing that Defendants utilize a “criteria or methods of administration” that has the effect \nor tendency of excluding disabled students like him.  28 C.F.R. §35.130(b)(3).   \n \nThe phrase “criteria or methods of administration” refers to official written policies and \nto the actual practices of the public entity, and thus extends beyond formal policies to widespread \nPage 19 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 20 of 22   Page ID #:7672\ncustoms and usage.  (Motion at 17); see 28 C.F.R. pt. 35 app. B, § 35.130 (2018); see also Oviatt \nv. Pearce, 954 F.2d 1470, 1477 (9th Cir. 1992) (defining policy as a “deliberate choice to follow a \ncourse of action made from among various alternatives by the official or officials responsible for \nestablishing final policy with respect to the subject matter in question.”) \n \nIt is undisputed that Plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability.  (PSUF ¶ 1.)  \nUnder the ADA and Section 504, a “disability” is “a physical or mental impairment that \nsubstantially limits” a “major life activity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12102(a)(A); 29 U.S.C. § 794.  Here, at \nall relevant times, Plaintiff’s ADHD and ODD have substantially limited the major life activities \nof thinking, learning, and concentrating.  (PSUD ¶ 3-4); see 42 U.S.C.  12102(2)(A). \n \nPlaintiff argues that MVUSD utilizes “methods of administration” under \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3) and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3), which “have the effect of subjecting \nqualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability” under 28 C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(8) and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(1) because they cause disproportionate restraints of \ndisabled students.  (Motion at 16-17.)   Plaintiff argues that MVUSD unlawfully applies the \nfollowing policies, practices, and customs to the CSOs and the SROs: (1) MVUSD authorizes \nCSOs to remove and restrain students but neither directs not authorizes CSOs or SROs to \naccount for students with disabilities or otherwise require accommodations; (2) MVUSD fails to \ntrain its CSOs and SROs about the needs of students with disabilities and appropriate \naccommodations or behavioral interventions; and (3) MVUSD directs its classroom and other \nschool staff to refer students with disabilities to unqualified CSOs and SROs for disability-related \nbehaviors.  (Motion at 19.)   \n \nPlaintiff provides sufficient evidence to support his claim that MVUSD utilizes methods \nof administration that have resulted in the disproportionate and discriminatory use of removal \nand physical restraints as well as law enforcement referrals as a response to disability-related \nbehaviors.  (Motion at 19.)  Defendants fail to adequately dispute any of Plaintiff’s material facts \nor provide any relevant evidence that would lead a reasonable jury to return a verdict for \nDefendants.  (See D. Opp. PSUF); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 \n(1986.)    \n \n1.  MVUSD Methods of Administration \n \nMVUSD policy requires CSOs to treat all students the same and to make no exceptions \nfor disability-related behavior in their enforcement of school rules and regulations.  (PSUF ¶ 51, \n81.)  CSOs do not investigate the reasons behind a student’s behavior, and therefore do not \nascertain whether the behavior is disability related.  (PSUF ¶ 52.)  MVUSD does not train CSOs \nabout the rights of students with disabilities, even though CSOs regularly interact with disabled \nstudents.  (PSUF ¶¶ 50-50(a).)  Although MVUSD provides CSOs with training through a third-\nparty contractor, the training programs do not cover disability-specific accommodations or \nbehavioral interventions.  (PSUF ¶¶ 67–69; 75–79(d).)  The CSV Handbook, CSO Handbook, \nand MVUSD’s Board Policies do not contain policies requiring CSOs to provide \naccommodations to students with disabilities or written procedures on how to provide \nPage 20 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 21 of 22   Page ID #:7673\naccommodations.  (PSUF ¶¶ 20, 48, 82–84.)  Aside from an employee handbook that applies to \nall MVUSD employees and imposes a general requirement to provide accommodations under the \nADA, no MVUSD policy requires or outlines how CSOs should provide disability-specific \naccommodations or de-escalation strategies to prevent removal and restraints of disabled \nstudents.  (PSUF ¶¶ 67–69; 75–77(d).)   \n \nMVUSD policy does not prohibit classroom and school administrative staff from referring \nstudents with disabilities to CSOs for removal from the classroom.  (PSUF ¶¶ 58-58(d).)  As \nsuch, teachers can request CSO assistance whenever they “fe[el] they need[] support,” such as \nwhen a disabled students’ behavior is “disrupting the educational process for students,” even if \nthe behavior is disability-related.  (PSUF ¶¶ 59-59(a).)  Since the position of CSO was created in \n2016, MVUSD has not trained CSOs on how to identify disabled students, understand disability-\nrelated behavior, and/or provide disability-specific accommodations.  (PSUF ¶¶ 34-34(c), 43, 50-\n50(a), 73-73(c).)  MVUSD does not maintain a policy that CSOs should be informed about a \nstudent’s disability or the accommodations and supports identified in the student’s IEP, Section \n504 Plan, or behavior plans.  (PSUF ¶¶ 74-74(c), 75-75(c).)  MVUSD provides no training to \nSROs, and MVUSD’s contract with the Sheriff’s Department does not inform SROs about its \nstudents with disabilities or the accommodations to which those students are entitled pursuant to \ntheir IEPs, 504 Plans, or BSPs.  (PSUF ¶¶ 95-95(c).)  Department does not require SROs be \ntrained on special education laws or on accommodating students with disabilities.  (PSUF ¶¶ 94-\n94(b); 95.)  As with its CSOs, MVUSD does not inform SROs about its students with disabilities \nor the accommodations to which those students are entitled pursuant to their IEPs, 504 Plans, or \nBSPs.  (PSUF ¶¶ 95-95(c).) \n \n2.  Discriminatory Effect on the Basis of Disability \n \nMVUSD’s data shows that students with disabilities and Black students with disabilities \nare disproportionately restrained and referred to law enforcement.  (PSUF ¶¶ 97, 99-99(d).)  In \n2018-19, students with disabilities were 2.6 times more likely to be restrained than their non-\ndisabled peers and Black students with disabilities were 3.26 times more likely to be restrained.  \n(PSUF ¶¶ 98-98(a).)  During the 2019-2020 school year, the rates increased significantly with \nstudents with disabilities being 8.90 times more likely to be restrained than their non-disabled \npeers and Black students with disabilities being 3.81 more likely to be restrained.  (PSUF ¶¶ \n98(b)-(c).)  MVUSD data also shows students with disabilities are disproportionately referred to \nlaw enforcement.  (PSUF ¶¶ 99-99(d).)  During the 2018–2019 school year, students with \ndisabilities were 8.97 times more likely to be referred to law enforcement than their nondisabled \npeers and Black students with disabilities were more than 3.48 times more likely to be referred.  \n(PSUF ¶¶ 99(a)-(b).)  The statistics did not improve for the 2019–2020 school year. (PSUF ¶¶ \n99(c)-(d).) \n \n  Plaintiff contends that based on these facts, as well as those outlined above, there is no \ndispute that MVUSD’s policies and trainings, along with the absence of necessary policies and \ntrainings, subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability \nPage 21 of 22  CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL  Initials of Deputy Clerk mg   \n \n\nCase 5:21-cv-00194-JGB-SP   Document 254   Filed 10/13/23   Page 22 of 22   Page ID #:7674\nthrough disproportionate use of restraints and referrals of disabled students to CSOs and SROs.  \n(Reply at 149-50.)  The Court agrees. \n \nFor the reasons above, the Court finds that there is no genuine dispute as to any material \nfacts and that Plaintiff is entitled to judgment under the ADA.  The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s \nMotion as to Claim Three.4 \n \nC.  Section 504 (Claim Four) \n \nTitle II of the ADA was expressly modeled after § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Duvall, \n260 F.3d, at 1135.  Plaintiff must show (1) he is an individual with a disability; (2) he is otherwise \nqualified to receive the benefit; (3) he was denied the benefits of the program solely by reason of \nhis disability; and (4) the program receives federal financial assistance.  Id.  \n \nDefendants do not dispute that MVUSD receives federal funding.  (D. Opp. PSUF ¶ 13.)  \nMVUSD is a covered entity under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act because it receives \n“federal financial assistance.”  (Reply at 149); 29 U.S.C. ¶ 794(a).  For this reason and the \nundisputed facts established above, the Court finds that Defendants violated Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act and GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion as to Claim Four.  \n \nV.  CONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons above, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion and VACATES the \nOctober 23, 2023 hearing.   \n \nFinding that Defendants’ methods of administration amount to a violation of students with \ndisabilities’ right to meaningful access under the ADA and Section 504, the Court ORDERS the \nparties to design a remedy to bring MVUSD into compliance. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n4 The Court reaches this decision before applying the adverse inference pursuant to the \nR&R which only solidifies the Court’s finding.
