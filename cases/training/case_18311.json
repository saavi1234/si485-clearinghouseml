    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a Protection and Advocacy agency's records access authority. On May 22, 2009, Disability Rights California (DRC) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Sierra Vista Rehabilitation Center, a nursing facility whose residents included people with disabilities, and SunBridge, the company that operated it. DRC alleged that Sierra Vista violated the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 10801 et seq., the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 15001 et seq., and California state law by failing to provide records about unlawful restraints at the facility and failing to allow DRC proper facility access. As California's Protection and Advocacy agency for people with disabilities, DRC had authority under federal law to request records and facility access. DRC sought a declaratory judgment and preliminary and permanent injunctions allowing DRC to access the records and the facility. Judge Frederick F. Mumm presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>In its complaint, DRC alleged that it had received multiple reports that Sierra Vista residents were slammed against a wall and placed in unlawful restraints at the facility. Following these reports, DRC opened an investigation into Sierra Vista. As part of this investigation, DRC requested records from Sierra Vista on restraints used against residents, third-party incident reports on restraints, and Sierra Vista policies on restraints and uses of force against residents; Sierra Vista allegedly refused to provide some of these records. DRC also alleged that it had asked to visit the facility in order to inform residents about their rights and examine facility conditions, but Sierra Vista would only allow this with specific limitations. When Sierra Vista allegedly refused to provide all the requested information and facility access, DRC filed this lawsuit and moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On June 10, 2009, after a motion by the defendants, the court ordered that SunBridge Braswell Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Sierra Vista Rehabilitation Center, would replace the two previously-named defendants. Later that month, on June 22, DRC filed an amended complaint to reflect the substituted defendant. A week later, on June 29, SunBridge moved to dismiss the case.</p>\r\n<p>Before the court ruled on the motions, the parties settled the lawsuit. On January 26, 2010, DRC notified the court it was voluntarily dismissing the case. The parties later filed a sealed agreement specifying the facility access procedures.</p>\r\n<p>DRC subsequently moved for attorney's fees, arguing that the lawsuit and settlement had led to the records and facility access it had initially wanted. However, the court denied the motion on September 9, 2010. The court held that DRC was not entitled to attorney's fees because it had not won the case on the merits and its litigation did not benefit the public or cause the defendants to provide all the requested relief.</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed.</p>",

BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nPlaintiff Disability Rights California is the designated Protection\nand Advocacy agency serving individuals with disabilities for the state\nof California. Defendant Sunbridge Braswell Enterprises, Inc., dba Sierra\nVista Rehabilitation Center, is a licensed skilled nursing facility that\nhouses developmentally and/or mentally disabled individuals in\nCalifornia.\nOn May 22, 2009, Plaintiff filed its Complaint for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, alleging eight causes of action for failure to provide\naccess to facility residents, resident records, and the facility itself,\nin violation of the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals With Mental\nIllness Act (โPAIMI Actโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 10801 et seq., the Protection and\nAdvocacy for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities Act (โPADD\nActโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 15041 et seq. and Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code ยง 4900 et\nseq. (dkt. #1). \nOn May 22, 2009, Plaintiff brought a Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction (dkt. #2). On June 5, 2009, the Court granted a continuance on\nPlaintiffโs Motion to July 6, 2009 (dkt. #10).\nOn June 11, 2009, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss Case (dkt.\n#13), contending that Plaintiffโs requests for records, facility and\npatient access were overbroad and exceeded Plaintiffโs rights under the\napplicable statutes and regulations. \nOn June 22, 2009, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (โFACโ)\n(dkt. #22), alleging the same causes of action. On June 29, 2009,\nDefendant filed a Motion to Dismiss FAC (dkt. #25).\nOn July 2, 2009, July 13, 2009, July 23, 2009, October 20, 2009 and\nNovember 17, 2009 the Court granted continuances on Plaintiffโs Motion\nfor a Preliminary Injunction and on Defendantโs Motion to Dismiss the FAC\n(dkt. #37, 41, 43, 57).\nOn January 26, 2010, Plaintiff filed a voluntary dismissal of the\nFAC without prejudice, except that the Court retained jurisdiction to\nresolve the issue of attorneysโ fees (dkt. #63).\nMINUTES FORM 90 Initials of Deputy Clerk     jre   \nCIVIL - GEN\n-2-\n\nCase 2:09-cv-03664-VBF-FFM   Document 99   Filed 09/09/10   Page 3 of 7   Page ID #:2153\nOn June 1, 2010, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Attorney Fees (dkt.\n#74), noticed for July 12, 2010.  On June 4, 2010, the Court granted a\ncontinuance of the hearing to August 30, 2010 (dkt. #77).\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\nWhere plaintiffs prevail on claims under both state and federal law,\nthe Ninth Circuit has applied state law in determining the right to fees\nand in the method of calculating fees. See Mangold v. California Public\nUtilities Commission, 67 F.3d 1470, 1478 (9th Cir. 1995).\nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure authorizes the Court to award\nattorneysโ fees to a successful party โin any action which has resulted\nin the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest\nif: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has\nbeen conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the\nnecessity and financial burden of private enforcement . . . are such as\nto make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the\ninterest of justice be paid out of the recovery.โ Cal. Code Civ. Proc. ยง\n1021.5; see also Woodland Hills Residents Assn. Inc. v. City Counsel of\nLos Angeles, 23 Cal. 3d 917, 935 (1979).\nWhere a litigant seeks attorneysโ fees without a favorable\ntermination on the merits, litigants must satisfy a three-prong analysis\n(the โcatalyst theoryโ) before fees will be rewarded: โ(1) the lawsuit\nwas a catalyst motivating the defendants to provide the primary relief\nsought; (2) . . . the lawsuit had merit and achieved its catalytic effect\nby threat of victory, not by dint of nuisance and threat of expense; and\n(3) . . . the plaintiff reasonably attempted to settle the litigation\nprior to filing the lawsuit.โ Tipton-Whittingham v. City of Los Angeles,\n34 Cal. 4th 604, 608 (2004); see also Wegner, Fairbank and Epstein,\nCalifornia Practice Guide: Civil Trial and Evidence ยง 17:150.10f (The\nRutter Group 2009); Graham, 34 Cal. 4th at 560-61. \nThe burden is on the fee claimant to establish each statutory\nrequirement. See id. at ยง 17:150.60.\nIV. ANALYSIS\nThe Court DENIES Plaintiffโs Motion as Plaintiff has not met all the\nrequirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5 and the\nthree prongs of the โcatalyst theory.โ Because there was no favorable\ntermination on the merits, Plaintiff must meet the requirements of both\nSection 1021.5 and the โcatalyst theory.โ See Graham, 34 Cal. 4th at 560-\n61. Specifically, Plaintiff has not shown, as required, that: (1) it\nMINUTES FORM 90 Initials of Deputy Clerk     jre   \nCIVIL - GEN\n-3-\n\nCase 2:09-cv-03664-VBF-FFM   Document 99   Filed 09/09/10   Page 4 of 7   Page ID #:2154\nconferred a significant benefit on a large class of people; (2) the suit\nwas a catalyst motivating Defendant to provide the primary relief sought,\nand (3) Plaintiff reasonably attempted to settle before filing suit. See\nid.\nThe partiesโ raised evidentiary issues which, to be complete, the\nCourt will address. However, the rulings are not determinative. Even if\nPlaintiffโs objections were all sustained (which is not the case),\nPlaintiff still has not met its burden and the Court considers only\nDefendantโs evidence as to which there is no objection. The evidentiary\nissues are addressed at the conclusion.\nA. As Required Under California Code Civil Procedure ยง 1021.5, a\nSignificant Benefit Was Not Conferred on a Large Class \nPlaintiff does not adequately support a finding that a sufficiently\nsignificant benefit was conferred on a large class of persons as a result\nof this litigation. In determining whether a significant benefit has been\nconferred on the general public or a large class, courts must perform โa\nrealistic assessment of all the relevant surrounding circumstances.โ Ryan\nv. Calif. Interscholastic Federation, 94 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1044 (2001). \nPlaintiff does not adequately show how access to the documents\nobtained conferred a significant benefit. As Defendant sets forth, of the\nten categories of documents requested in Plaintiffโs Motion for a\nPreliminary Injunction, Defendant provided to Plaintiff, after litigation\ncommenced, only restraint logs and data and records for residents for\nwhom Plaintiff had received an authorization for release. See Proposed\nOrder for Preliminary Injunction (dkt. #2-1), Libby Decl. ยถ 15; Def.โs\nOpp. at 14:3-15:4; Joint Report from Plaintiff and Defendant Re: Status\nof Resolved Issues (dkt. #46); Gassis Decl. ยถยถ 24-31.\nAdditionally, Plaintiff does not adequately show that if the suit\nresulted in a significant benefit, such a benefit was conferred on a\nlarge class of persons. As Defendant asserts, the benefit would be\nconferred only on residents of the Sierra Vista facility. This is\ninsufficient to show that a large class of persons would benefit. See\nCity of Hawaiian Gardens v. City of Long Beach, 61 Cal. App. 4th 1100\n(1998); see also Wegner, Fairbank and Epstein, California Practice Guide:\nCivil Trial and Evidence ยงยง 17:150.15 - 24 (The Rutter Group 2009).\nB.

As Defendant asserts, both before and after Plaintiff filed its\nComplaint, Defendant provided Plaintiff with access to the facility and\nits residents. See Gassis Decl. at ยถยถ 65, 87. Defendant also informed\nPlaintiff that it was willing to meet with Plaintiff to determine a\nprotocol that provided for Plaintiffโs โreasonableโ access to the\nfacility. See Stortz Decl., Ex. 15; Ex. 17.\nAdditionally, of the ten categories of documents requested in\nPlaintiffโs Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, Defendant provided to\nPlaintiff, only restraint logs and data and records for residents for\nwhom Plaintiff had received an authorization for release. See Proposed\nOrder for Preliminary Injunction (dkt. #2-1); Libby Decl. ยถ 15; Def.โs\nOpp. at 14:3-15:4; see also Joint Report from Plaintiff and Defendant Re:\nStatus of Resolved Issues (dkt. #46); Gassis Decl. ยถยถ 24-31. Access to\nthese categories of documents does not adequately support a finding that\nDefendant provided the primary relief sought.\nC. Whether Plaintiff Reasonably Attempted to Settle Before Filing \nPlaintiff does not adequately support a finding that it made\nreasonable attempts to settle the litigation before filing suit. Prior to\nlitigation, Defendant complied with several of Plaintiffโs document\nrequests. See Stortz Decl., Ex. 4, Ex. 5, Ex. 6, Ex. 7, Ex. 8. Upon\nrequest, Defendant met with Plaintiff to discuss โPro-Act techniques and\nfacility policies concerning physical contact between staff and\nresidents.โ See Stortz Decl., Ex. 2, Ex. 3, Ex. 6; Gassis Decl. ยถ 24.\nWhen Plaintiff made additional document requests, including the\nproduction of redacted records for every resident of Defendantโs facility\nfrom January 1, 2008 through February 28, 2009, Defendant declined to\ncomply and explained that the request exceeded Plaintiffโs statutory\naccess rights. See Stortz Decl., Ex. 10, Ex. 11. According to the\nevidence provided, Plaintiff never provided a substantive response to\nthis letter. See Stortz Decl., Ex. 12.\nRegarding Plaintiffโs attempt to settle the facility access dispute,\nDefendant responded to Plaintiffโs request for access by acknowledging\nPlaintiffโs right to โreasonableโ access and stating that they were\nโwilling to meet and confer with you to develop a protocol for such\naccess.โ Stortz Decl., Ex. 13, Ex. 15; Libby Decl. at ยถยถ 8-10. Plaintiff,\nhowever, declined to meet with Defendant until it received a โcommitment\nthat [its] access authority would be respected to the extent set out in\nstate and federal law.โ Stortz Decl., Ex. 16. On May 20, 2009, Defendant\ninformed Plaintiff that it would provide access to the facility pursuant\nMINUTES FORM 90 Initials of Deputy Clerk     jre   \nCIVIL - GEN\n-5-\n\nCase 2:09-cv-03664-VBF-FFM   Document 99   Filed 09/09/10   Page 6 of 7   Page ID #:2156\nto proposed conditions and repeated that it was willing to meet and\nconfer regarding Plaintiffโs request for access. See Stortz Decl., Ex.\n17; Libby Decl. at ยถยถ 11-12. Later that day, Plaintiff informed Defendant\nthat it intended to initiate litigation and seek a preliminary\ninjunction. On May 22, 2009, Plaintiff filed its Complaint and\nPreliminary Injunction Motion. \nV. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS\nThe Court considered the Plaintiffโs Objections to Defendantโs\nEvidence (dkt. #88, filed on June 29, 2010). With respect to the\nobjections to the Declaration of Brand Cooper (dkt. #80), those are not\npertinent, given the Courtโs finding that Plaintiff is not entitled to\nattorneysโ fees. The Cooper Declaration relates to the amount of\nattorneysโ fees and the Court finds this is not an issue that needs to be\naddressed. Plaintiff also objects (dkt. #88, page 10:10-18) to the\nDeclaration of Michael Gassis (dkt. #81) by referring to earlier filed\nobjections (dkt. #32). The Plaintiffโs objections, particularly relevancy\nobjections, are overruled.\nThe Plaintiffโs objections (dkt. #88) address the Declaration of\nJohn Libby (dkt. #79). As noted, the Courtโs ruling to deny the\nPlaintiffโs Motion would remain the same regardless of the ruling on\nobjections to the Libby Declaration. To be complete the Court is ruling\non the objections. First, the Plaintiffโs objections, as presented, are\ndifficult and unmanageable to rule on especially to the extent they\nobject to entire paragraphs containing disparate parts. For example,\nportions of but not the entirety of paragraphs are subject to objections.\nDespite the defects in Plaintiffโs papers, the Court rules as follows on\nobjections to the Libby Declaration:\n(1) Paragraph 2: Objection overruled as to first sentence. As to the\nsecond sentence, objection sustained on ground of insufficient\nfoundation, except that the Court overrules the objection to the\nstatement that Sierra Vista made effort to comply. Fed. R. Evid. 602.\n(2) Paragraph 3: Objections overruled, except the Court sustains the\nobjections and disregards Declarantโs value judgments as to which there\nis a lack of foundation. This includes the assertions that Sierra Vista\nmade โfull and complete responses.โ (Libby Decl., para. 3, page 2:26-27).\n(3) Paragraph 4: Objections sustained as to โnew request was enormous in\nburden and scope.โ\n(4) Paragraph 7: Objections overruled.\nMINUTES FORM 90 Initials of Deputy Clerk     jre   \nCIVIL - GEN\n-6-\n\nCase 2:09-cv-03664-VBF-FFM   Document 99   Filed 09/09/10   Page 7 of 7   Page ID #:2157\n(5) Paragraph 14: Objection sustained as to โincluding the massively\nburdensome and overbroad requests.โ\n(6) Paragraph 20: Objections overruled.\n(7) Paragraph 21: Objections sustained as to text because of inadequate\nfoundation of personal knowledge. Fed. R. Evid. 602. However, as to the\nreferenced Exhibit D, the objection is overruled. Although for purposes\nof ruling on this Motion, the Court finds that it is unnecessary to\nconsider Exhibit D (and other portions of the Libby Declaration to which\nPlaintiff objects), the Court overrules the Confidential Settlement\nCommunication. Fed. R. Evid. 602. The Court finds that this objection is\nnot shown to be applicable.\n(8) Paragraphs 22 and 23: Objections overruled.\n(9) Paragraph 25: Objection sustained, lack of foundation.\nThe Court would note that the portions of the Libby Declaration\nwhich are admissible provide additional support for the Defendantโs\nOpposition, including, for example, the following paragraphs: 5-6, 8-13,\n15-19. Further, the Court finds that the evidence submitted by the Moving\nParty Plaintiff tends to support, rather than undercut, the Courtโs\nfindings. See, e.g., Supplemental Declaration of Michael Stortz (dkt.\n#87, filed June 29, 2010) and Supplemental Declaration of Rachel Scherer\n(dkt. #85, filed June 29, 2010). The Court considered all Plaintiffโs\nevidence.\nAlthough the Defendantโs may have had some grounds for the Ex Parte\nApplication (dkt. #94), the Court, as indicated, essentially found that\nthe Ex Parte was not timely and therefore denied it, noting that\nPlaintiffโs Reply papers were filed on June 29, 2010 and the Defendantโs\nEx Parte filed August 24, 2010. The Court also considered whether further\nbriefing by the parties would be helpful on any issues and concluded that\nthe issues were adequately briefed and that the Motion would be\nappropriately denied on the briefing before it.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nMINUTES FORM 90 Initials of Deputy Clerk     jre   \nCIVIL - GEN\n-7-",
