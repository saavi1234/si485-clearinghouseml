Defendants Pasadena Unified School District (“Pasadena USD” or \n3  “District”) and Brian McDonald, the Superintendent of Pasadena USD, operate a \n4  public school system that discriminates against students with behavior-related \n5  disabilities.  Pasadena USD sends students with these disabilities and only such \n6  students to a segregated school site, Focus Point Academy (“Focus Point”), where \n7  they are consigned to an inferior education, denied access to electives and \n8  extracurricular activities, isolated from their non-disabled peers, deprived of the \n9  benefits of normal socialization, and, in general, suffer the same harms as any other \n10  victims of segregation.  This practice violates the Americans with Disabilities Act \n11  (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132 et seq., along with state disability rights laws.  \n12  Consequently, this court has jurisdiction over this action under Title II of the ADA, \n13  42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12133, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n14  2.  Although Pasadena USD considers Focus Point a “therapeutic setting,” \n15  it is far from being therapeutic.  Placement at Focus Point is more likely to \n16  exacerbate a child’s mental health condition than improve it.  Academic \n17  expectations are low, and students make little academic progress there.  Rather than \n18  fostering learning, the emphasis at Focus Point is on behavior control using drastic \n19  methods including dangerous physical restraints, inappropriate forced isolation, \n20  threatened and repeated arrests, and suspensions for minor offenses. \n21  3.  Tragically, most if not all of the children placed at Focus Point do not \n22  need to be there. These are children of great promise. They could be educated \n23  successfully in classrooms with students without disabilities in Pasadena USD’s \n24  neighborhood schools with reasonable modification of Pasadena USD’s programs \n25  and services, namely, the provision of school-based behavioral services there.  \n26  4.  The ADA imposes on Defendants the obligation to reasonably modify \n27  Pasadena USD’s programs and services to avoid discrimination.  Providing children \n28  with a behavior-related disability access to school-based behavioral services—to \n   1 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 5 of 31   Page ID #:5\n \n1  afford them an equal education and to enable them to be educated in neighborhood \n2  schools—is a reasonable modification required by the ADA.  \n3  5.  The ADA mandates that Defendants (i) provide children with a \n4  behavior-related disability educational opportunities that are equal to and as \n5  effective as those provided other students, and (ii) serve students with a behavior-\n6  related disability in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, that is, the \n7  setting in which they interact with their peers without a disability to the fullest \n8  extent possible.  By warehousing students with behavior-related disabilities at \n9  Focus Point, Defendants are violating both of the ADA’s legal mandates.  \n10  6.  Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief for ongoing violations \n11  of the ADA, including an order that Defendants provide the named Plaintiffs and \n12  the Plaintiff class with school-based behavioral services in neighborhood schools to \n13  afford them an equal education and enable them to be educated in neighborhood \n14  schools with their peers without disabilities. \n15  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16  7.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Title II of the ADA, \n17  42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12133, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Declaratory relief is available \n18  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n19  Injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2202 and Rule 65 of the Federal Rules \n20  of Civil Procedure.  \n21  8.  Plaintiffs’ claims for violations of California state law concern the \n22  same actions and omissions that form the basis of their claims under federal law \n23  because they are all part of the same case or controversy.  This court has \n24  supplemental jurisdiction over those state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, \n25  California Government Code § 11139, and California Civil Code § 54.3.  \n26  9.  Venue is proper in the Central District of California pursuant to 28 \n27  U.S.C. § 1391(b) (2), because all of the acts and omissions giving rise to these \n28  claims occurred in the Central District.  \n   2 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 6 of 31   Page ID #:6\n \n1  PARTIES \n2  A.  Plaintiffs \n3  10.  The named Plaintiffs, described in more detail in paragraphs 68 \n4  through 110 below, all reside in Pasadena and have behavior-related disabilities that \n5  impair their ability to learn, read, concentrate, think, and communicate.  All are \n6  either students at Focus Point or are at serious risk of reassignment to it because \n7  Defendants are not providing them the school-based behavioral services they need \n8  to be educated in their neighborhood schools. \n9  11.  In each case, the student’s guardian ad litem brings this action on the \n10  student’s behalf. \n11  12.  All the named Plaintiffs in this matter are minors and have requested \n12  leave to proceed in this matter under fictitious names.   \n13  B.  Defendants  \n14  13.  Defendant Pasadena Unified School District (“Pasadena USD”) \n15  operates and funds public school programs, services, and activities.  Pasadena USD \n16  is a public entity as defined by Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131.  Pasadena \n17  USD’s offices are located at 351 S. Hudson Ave., Pasadena, California 91101.  \n18  14.  Defendant Brian McDonald is sued in his official capacity as the \n19  Superintendent of Pasadena USD.  Defendant McDonald is responsible for the daily \n20  operations of Pasadena USD, including its programs and services for students with \n21  a disability.  \n22  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n23  15.  Pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \n24  Procedure, named Plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action on their own behalf and \n25  on behalf of the following class:  All Pasadena USD students who, now or in the \n26  future, are placed at Focus Point or are at serious risk of being placed at Focus \n27  Point.  A student is at “serious risk” of being placed at Focus Point if the student \n28  (a) is being considered for placement at Focus Point, or (b) has recently been \n   3 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 7 of 31   Page ID #:7\n \n1  transitioned from Focus Point to a neighborhood school and is having behavior \n2  problems at that school.   \n3  16.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. \n4  Pasadena USD has reported that, during the 2014-2015 school year, over 80 \n5  students with a behavior-related disability were enrolled at Focus Point.  Joinder is \n6  also impracticable because Pasadena USD routinely considers new students for \n7  enrollment at Focus Point, and enrolls new children at Focus Point on an ongoing \n8  basis.  In addition, most class members lack the means to maintain individual \n9  actions.  \n10  17.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class, including \n11  whether Defendants are discriminating against named Plaintiffs and those similarly \n12  situated in violation of the ADA, California Government Code § 11135, and the \n13  California Disabled Persons Act, California Civil Code § 54 et seq., by, among \n14  other actions, employing policies and practices that: \n15  a.  Deny named Plaintiffs and members of the class an opportunity \n16  to participate in and benefit from educational services that are \n17  equal to that afforded students without a behavior-related \n18  disability;  \n19  b.  Deny named Plaintiffs and members of the class educational \n20  services that are as effective in affording equal opportunity to \n21  obtain the same result, gain the same benefit, or reach the same \n22  level of achievement as that provided students without a \n23  behavior-related disability;  \n24  c.  Fail to provide named Plaintiffs and members of the class \n25  educational programs and services in the most integrated setting \n26  appropriate, by unnecessarily segregating them at Focus Point;  \n27  d.

Utilize methods of administration that have the effect of \n2  defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the \n3  objectives of Defendants’ educational programs with respect to \n4  students with a behavior-related disability.   \n5  18.  The named Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the class.  \n6  19.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of \n7  the class.  The named Plaintiffs will vigorously represent the interests of the \n8  unnamed class members, and all members of the proposed class will benefit from \n9  Plaintiffs’ efforts.  There is no conflict between the interests of the named Plaintiffs \n10  and the proposed class.  Furthermore, Plaintiffs have retained competent counsel \n11  experienced in educational and class action litigation. \n12  20.  Defendants have acted and continue to act on grounds generally \n13  applicable to the Plaintiff class, thereby making appropriate injunctive and \n14  declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.  \n15  THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n16  21.  Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 \n17  U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for \n18  the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities and to provide \n19  strong and enforceable standards for addressing such discrimination.  42 U.S.C. \n20  § 12101(b)(1), (2).  \n21  22.  The ADA is based on Congress’s findings that, inter alia, \n22  (i) “historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with \n23  disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against \n24  individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem,” \n25  42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2), and (ii) “discrimination against individuals with \n26  disabilities persists in such critical areas as . . . education,” 42 U.S.C. \n27  § 12101(a)(3); and (iii) “individuals with disabilities continually encounter various \n28  forms of discrimination, including . . . segregation, and relegation to lesser services, \n   5 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 9 of 31   Page ID #:9\n \n1  programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities.” 42 U.S.C. \n2  § 12101(a)(5).  \n3  23.  The ADA defines a “disability” as “a physical or mental impairment \n4  that substantially limits one or more major life activities.”  42 U.S.C. \n5  § 12102(1)(A).  The ADA provides that for purposes of this definition, “major life \n6  activities” include but are not limited to “learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, \n7  [and] communicating.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A). \n8  24.  The ADA defines “qualified individual with a disability” as an \n9  “individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, \n10  policies, or practices, . . . meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt \n11  of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public \n12  entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).   \n13  25.  As school-age residents of Pasadena, all named Plaintiffs are eligible \n14  for educational services provided by the Pasadena USD, and, by virtue of their \n15  disabilities, all are qualified for the protections of the ADA. \n16  26.  Title II of the ADA mandates that “no qualified individual with a \n17  disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \n18  denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be \n19  subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132; see also 28 \n20  C.F.R. § 35.130.  \n21  27.  Title II of the ADA applies to all of the activities of public entities, \n22  including providing education. Each Defendant is either a public entity subject to \n23  Title II of the ADA or an official responsible for supervising the operations of a \n24  public entity subject to Title II of the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  \n25  28.  The ADA directs the Attorney General to promulgate regulations \n26  enforcing Title II of the ADA and provides guidance on their content.  The \n27  regulations promulgated by the Attorney General require public entities to “make \n28 \n   6 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 10 of 31   Page ID #:10\n \n1  reasonable modifications” to their programs and services “when the modifications \n2  are necessary to avoid discrimination.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  \n3  29.  The regulations also specify that it is unlawful discrimination for a \n4  public entity to:  \n5  a.  “Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to \n6  participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is \n7  not equal to that afforded others,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii);  \n8  b.  “Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, \n9  benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal \n10  opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, \n11  or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to \n12  others,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii);  \n13  c.  Fail to “administer services, programs, and activities in the most \n14  integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified \n15  individuals with disabilities,” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), which the \n16  Attorney General has defined as “a setting that enables \n17  individuals with disabilities to interact with non-disabled \n18  persons to the fullest extent possible,” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, \n19  p. 450; or  \n20  d.  “[U]tilize criteria or methods of administration … [t]hat have \n21  the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing \n22  accomplishment of the objectives of the public entity’s program \n23  with respect to individuals with disabilities,” 28 C.F.R. \n24  § 35.130(b)(3)(ii).  \n25  30.  The Supreme Court has held that discrimination prohibited under Title \n26  II of the ADA includes the needless isolation or segregation of persons with \n27  disabilities.  Olmstead v. L.C., ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 600 (1999) \n28  (“unjustified institutional isolation of persons with disabilities is a form of \n   7 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 11 of 31   Page ID #:11\n \n1  discrimination”); see also 2011 Statement of the US Department of Justice on \n2  Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the ADA and Olmstead, June \n3  22, 2011.  \n4  31.  As the Supreme Court has held in a different context:  “We conclude \n5  that in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no \n6  place.  Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.”  Brown v. Bd. of Ed. \n7  of Topeka, Shawnee Cnty., Kan., 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954).   \n8  32.  Unjustified isolation of disabled persons who, with reasonable \n9  accommodations, could participate in an integrated setting is unlawful \n10  discrimination because (1) segregation “perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that \n11  persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life,” \n12  and (2) segregation “severely diminishes life activities of individuals, including \n13  family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational \n14  advancement, and cultural enrichment.”  Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 600-601. \n15  33.  Congress specifically provided for a private right of action to enforce \n16  Title II.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (incorporating the remedies and enforcement \n17  procedures available under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which includes a \n18  private right of action).  \n19  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n20  A.  The Pasadena Unified School District \n21  34.  Defendant Pasadena USD is a unified school district that is responsible \n22  for the schools in the cities of Pasadena, Sierra Madre and the unincorporated \n23  community of Altadena.  It has approximately 26 neighborhood schools in which \n24  students with and without disabilities are enrolled.  Enrollment at Focus Point is \n25  limited to students with behavior-related disabilities.  \n26  35.  Defendants have not reasonably modified Pasadena USD \n27  neighborhood schools to provide school-based behavioral services for children with \n28  a behavior-related disability.  The essential components of school-based behavioral \n   8 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 12 of 31   Page ID #:12\n \n1  services are: (a) a comprehensive assessment, including determination of the \n2  purpose and triggers for the child’s behavior; (b) an individualized school-based \n3  intervention plan that relies on positive support, social skills training, a care \n4  coordinator, and adjustments to curriculum or schedule as needed; (c) training for \n5  school staff and parents in implementing the plan; and (d) coordination with non-\n6  school providers involved with the child (collectively, “school-based behavioral \n7  services”). \n8  36.  There is a professional consensus that such school-based behavioral \n9  services are necessary to afford children like named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff class \n10  members an equal opportunity to advance academically and graduate and the \n11  opportunity to be educated in neighborhood schools along with their non-disabled \n12  peers.  \n13  37.  Instead of providing school-based behavioral services in neighborhood \n14  schools, Defendants routinely inform students who need them, and their caregivers, \n15  that they are only available at Focus Point.  The District then transfers these \n16  students to Focus Point.  \n17  38.  In addition, students at Pasadena USD schools other than Focus Point \n18  have access to a rich array of educational and extracurricular activities.  For high \n19  school students, this includes a Regional Occupation Program that offers training in \n20  high school for careers in health care, entertainment, computer science and video \n21  game development and television and video production classes taught through the \n22  District's own cable access station.  Pasadena USD also offers ROTC, including \n23  Naval Cadet training at one high school.  Plaintiffs do not have these opportunities \n24  at Focus Point.   \n25  39.  For example, John Muir High School is the neighborhood school that \n26  named Plaintiffs Sam Doe and Walter Doe would attend if they were not placed at \n27  Focus Point.  The Muir campus has a swimming pool, separate sports fields for \n28  soccer, baseball and football, an auditorium, little theater, business academy, a large \n   9 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 13 of 31   Page ID #:13\n \n1  library and computer lab, and a building dedicated to auto shop, art rooms and a \n2  career training program.  Muir has more than 17 clubs and sports activities for \n3  students, such as robotics, band, and the school newspaper.  Its school literary \n4  magazine is supported by the local Rotary club and publishes student poetry, \n5  artwork, and fiction.  Muir Ranch is an on-site school garden staffed by student \n6  farmers that partners with local restaurants, and sells farm boxes and floral \n7  bouquets to fund paid student internships.  Neither Sam nor Walter can participate \n8  in any of these programs and activities while enrolled at Focus Point. \n9  40.  Similarly, Sierra Madre Middle School is the neighborhood school that \n10  named Plaintiff Deborah Doe would attend if she had not been placed at Focus \n11  Point.  Sierra Madre is a comprehensive campus with classes not only in traditional \n12  academic subjects, but also vocal training, drama and robotics.  Every 8th grade \n13  student at Sierra Madre Middle School has the opportunity to spend a week at a \n14  science camp on Catalina Island.  Students at Sierra Madre can participate in an \n15  annual talent show, art contest, school dances including a winter formal, and school \n16  plays such as “the Music Man.”  One school group organizes volunteer \n17  opportunities for students, such as food drives, spirit day, and neighborhood \n18  improvement.  Student athletics include flag football, soccer, and basketball.  \n19  Deborah cannot participate in any of these activities at Focus Point.  \n20  B.  Focus Point – Pasadena USD’s Segregated School \n21  41.  Focus Point serves first through twelfth grade students (up to age 21) \n22  who have behavior-related disabilities.  During the 2014-2015 school year, \n23  approximately 82 students attended Focus Point, according to Focus Point \n24  enrollment logs.   \n25  42.  The students at Focus Point have many talents and strengths.  They \n26  have the same aspirations as other Pasadena USD students.  They have hobbies; \n27  enjoy sports, music, and art; and would like to participate in extracurricular \n28  activities.  After they graduate from high school, they would like to get good jobs. \n   10 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 14 of 31   Page ID #:14\n \n1  Many would like to go to college.  Most have supportive families, guardians, or \n2  caregivers. \n3  43.  The students at Focus Point could be successfully educated in \n4  neighborhood schools if provided school-based behavioral services.   \n5  44.  By removing them from neighborhood schools, PUSD needlessly \n6  segregates these students from their peers without disabilities \n7  45.  The isolation of students at Focus Point severely diminishes their \n8  educational opportunity.  They are denied the same opportunity to learn and \n9  graduate that is afforded their peers.   \n10  46.  Their isolation at Focus Point also denies the students opportunities to \n11  develop appropriate social skills, including through interacting with their peers \n12  without disabilities.  \n13  47.  Moreover, the students at Focus Point are stigmatized as a result of the \n14  unwarranted assumption that they are incapable or unworthy of attending their \n15  neighborhood schools with their non-disabled peers. \n16  48.  Once transferred to Focus Point, many students remain there for years \n17  even though part of Focus Point’s purported mission is to transition students back \n18  to neighborhood schools. \n19  49.  The few Focus Point students whom Defendants do permit to \n20  transition to a neighborhood school from Focus Point are at risk of returning to \n21  Focus Point because Defendants fail to provide them the school-based behavioral \n22  services they need to be successful in a neighborhood school.  If a former student \n23  has a crisis that requires additional support, Defendants send the student back to \n24  Focus Point, instead of providing the school-based behavioral services the student \n25  needs.  \n26  50.  Pasadena USD often tells parents, guardians, or other educational \n27  rights holders that students with behavior-related disabilities must be placed at \n28  Focus Point or they will fail educationally. \n   11 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 15 of 31   Page ID #:15\n \n1  Behavior Management \n2  51.  School-based behavioral services are largely unavailable to children at \n3  Focus Point, which does not use effective and professionally accepted practices for \n4  managing and improving the behavior of its students.  Focus Point uses the same \n5  ineffective program for managing and improving the behavior of each of its \n6  students, consisting primarily of a points system and the use of restraint and \n7  seclusion.  \n8  52.  Because they do not receive school-based behavioral services, Focus \n9  Point students at times engage in disruptive behavior.  Although District mental \n10  health staff and personnel from Pacific Clinics, a private mental health services \n11  provider, are on Focus Point’s campus, deescalating students when they engage in \n12  disruptive behavior is not part of their responsibilities.  Rather, this is left to Focus \n13  Point’s inadequately trained school personnel, who often resort to harsh and \n14  counterproductive responses, including physical restraints, unnecessary forced \n15  isolation, and inappropriate arrests and suspensions for minor offenses.  These \n16  methods interfere with students’ education and their ability to learn, and tend to \n17  exacerbate their mental health symptoms.  \n18  53.  Focus Point uses a point system for earning rewards or to qualify for \n19  transfer to another school.  A student must earn a certain number of points each day \n20  to be considered for transfer to another school.  If the student does not earn enough \n21  points each day over a 30-day period, the calendar is reset to day one.   \n22  54.  The point system used by Focus Point is not an appropriate \n23  intervention for students with behavior-related disabilities, including because it is \n24  not individualized to students’ strengths and needs.  It is also implemented \n25  arbitrarily.  A behavior that on one day is acceptable can result in points being \n26  withheld on another day.  The inconsistent application of the point system \n27  contributes to the environment at Focus Point being unpredictable and unstable.   \n28 \n   12 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 16 of 31   Page ID #:16\n \n1  55.  Focus Point staff inappropriately rely on restraint and seclusion to \n2  address problematic behaviors.  Seclusion takes place in an isolation room, which \n3  staff and students call the “boring room.”  The “boring room” has no windows and \n4  the walls are padded.  Focus Point staff frequently use restraints when they place \n5  students in the boring room. \n6  Academics \n7  56.  At Focus Point, academic instruction is “dumbed down” and \n8  secondary to behavioral control based on the unwarranted assumption that students \n9  at Focus Point are incapable of achieving academically at the same level as their \n10  peers without a disability. \n11  57.  Moreover, students from a range of grades are placed in the same \n12  classroom, making instruction challenging.  Students from 6th-8th grade are mixed \n13  together in middle school classrooms, students from 9th-12th grade are mixed \n14  together in Focus Point’s high school classrooms.  At Focus Point teachers of multi-\n15  grade classrooms typically employ one-size-fits-all lesson plans and do not \n16  differentiate instruction based on grade level or ability.  \n17  58.  Focus Point requires many students to leave the school at 1:00 p.m. to \n18  participate in a non-academic day treatment program at Pacific Clinics from 1:30 to \n19  5:30 p.m.  Some Focus Point students must attend this program five days per week, \n20  others attend two days per week.  These students receive far less instructional time \n21  per week than other Pasadena USD students, who attend school until 3:00 p.m. each \n22  day.   \n23  59.  Focus Point students are not taught the same curriculum provided to \n24  their non-disabled peers, or even a comparable curriculum.  Focus Point students do \n25  not take tests that are the same or comparable to those tests given to their non-\n26  disabled peers.  They are also not given homework that is the same or comparable \n27  to that given non-disabled peers. \n28 \n   13 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 17 of 31   Page ID #:17\n \n1  Other Unequal Educational Opportunities \n2  60.  Focus Point has no extracurricular activities or clubs, and does not \n3  offer the elective classes available at Pasadena USD neighborhood schools.  Middle \n4  and high school students at Focus Point cannot take physical education classes.  \n5  There are no intermural athletics or student sports teams.  Students cannot play \n6  interscholastic sports against other schools within Pasadena USD or inter-district \n7  sports against teams from other school districts.  There is no auditorium, no music \n8  or band classes or clubs, and no drama or dance program.  There are no school \n9  dances.  There are no vocational programs nor is there a school garden.  There is no \n10  ROTC.  There are no classes in film, video, visual and fine arts, or graphic design.  \n11  There is no student government.  Students do not have the opportunity to participate \n12  in Pasadena USD-sponsored college, military, and job informational and \n13  recruitment activities available to students in the neighborhood high schools. \n14  Students do not even have access to a lunchroom or cafeteria and must eat lunch in \n15  their small classrooms.   \n16  61.  Focus Point requires students who want to return to an integrated \n17  campus to participate first in “dual enrollment,” a process that is poorly planned \n18  and executed, deprives students of valuable instructional time, and hinders their \n19  social integration into the new school.  Dual enrollment requires the student to \n20  attend one or two classes at a neighborhood school, and then be transported by bus \n21  to Focus Point, where they spend the remainder of the day.  Dual enrollment is \n22  often initiated mid-year, so the Focus Point students start off behind other students \n23  in their new classes at the neighborhood school.  Teachers at the neighborhood \n24  school are typically not involved in planning the students’ transition, nor are they \n25  adequately trained or supported to respond to disruptive behavior that may occur at \n26  the new school.  \n27  62.  Even after Focus Point staff identifies a student as eligible to transfer \n28  to a neighborhood school, District staff may wait months or even years before \n   14 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 18 of 31   Page ID #:18\n \n1  taking steps to return the student to a neighborhood school.  No explanation is \n2  given for the delay. \n3  C.  The Named Plaintiffs \n4  Allegations Common to All Named Plaintiffs \n5  63.  All of the named Plaintiffs attend Focus Point or are at serious risk of \n6  attending Focus Point because of Defendants’ policy and practice of failing to \n7  provide school-based behavioral services at neighborhood schools.    \n8  64.  While at Focus Point, each of the named Plaintiffs was denied equal \n9  educational opportunity and the opportunity to be educated in the most integrated \n10  setting appropriate to their needs.  Each made little or no educational progress, and \n11  their behavior and mental health status deteriorated.    \n12  65.  Each of the named Plaintiffs wants to and could be educated in a \n13  neighborhood school if Pasadena USD would reasonably modify its programs and \n14  services by providing school-based behavioral services to students with behavior-\n15  related disabilities.  Each of their guardians ad litem wants them to attend a \n16  neighborhood school, which would be the most integrated setting appropriate for \n17  them.   \n18  66.  Defendants placed all of the named Plaintiffs at Focus Point on the \n19  grounds that they could not be educated in a neighborhood school because they \n20  required services that can only be provided at Focus Point.  However, the services \n21  the named Plaintiffs required could reasonably be provided to the named Plaintiffs \n22  at a neighborhood school.  \n23  67.  Each of the named Plaintiffs has suffered serious harms as a result of \n24  his or her placement at Focus Point. \n25  Plaintiff Sam Doe \n26  68.  Plaintiff Sam Doe is 14 years old.  He is a student in the ninth grade at \n27  Focus Point, which he has attended since starting fifth grade in 2011.  He lives in \n28  Pasadena with his mother, L.R., who is his guardian ad litem and brings this action \n   15 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 19 of 31   Page ID #:19\n \n1  on his behalf.  He is interested in learning about computers and designing video \n2  games, and likes to entertain people and make them laugh.  \n3  69.  Sam has a behavior-related disability that impairs his ability to learn, \n4  read, concentrate, think, communicate, or develop and maintain relationships.  He \n5  has been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and has problems \n6  processing new information.  He sometimes is verbally defiant to staff and teachers, \n7  is aggressive with peers, leaves campus without permission, and is late to or absent \n8  from school.   \n9  70.  He attended neighborhood schools in Pasadena USD from first through \n10  fifth grade, before the District transferred him to Focus Point.  During this time, the \n11  District did not provide school-based behavioral services to Sam, and he has \n12  continued to have behavior issues in school.   \n13  71.  Sam spent sixth grade at Focus Point.  During his seventh grade year, \n14  Sam was permitted to dual enroll at a neighborhood middle school in the morning, \n15  returning to Focus Point for the afternoon.  The District did not prepare Sam to \n16  attend his neighborhood school, and did not provide Sam with school-based \n17  behavioral services at that school.  After several months, the District ended Sam’s \n18  dual enrollment, and he returned full-time to Focus Point. \n19  72.  Sam is now in ninth grade at Focus Point.  He has made virtually no \n20  academic progress over the last four years.  Each year that he is at Focus Point, he \n21  falls further behind his non-disabled peers.   \n22  73.  Focus Point has not been successful in improving Sam’s behavior, \n23  School staff frequently send Sam to the “boring room” as a punishment for \n24  disruptive behavior.  In one instance he was sent to the “boring room” at the end of \n25  the day and was required to return the next day to finish his punishment.    \n26  74.  Sam has told his counselors that he often “acts out” because he has \n27  given up hope of ever being able to leave Focus Point and returning to a \n28  neighborhood school. \n   16 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 20 of 31   Page ID #:20\n \n1  75.  With school-based behavioral services, Sam could be educated in a \n2  Pasadena USD neighborhood school. \n3  Plaintiff Deborah Doe \n4  76.  Plaintiff Deborah Doe is 11 years old and is in the sixth grade at Focus \n5  Point.  She has attended Focus Point since February 2012 when she was in the third \n6  grade, with a brief break in 2013 when she was temporarily placed outside the \n7  school district.  She is in foster care and lives at a group foster home in Pasadena.  \n8  Her aunt, S.H., is her guardian ad litem and brings this action on her behalf.  She \n9  enjoys dancing, socializing, playing sports and interacting with classmates whether \n10  it is on the athletic fields or in the classroom.  She is interested in dance, drama, and \n11  athletics, and would like to work on a school yearbook. \n12  77.  Deborah has a behavior-related disability that impairs her ability to \n13  learn, concentrate, think, communicate, or develop and maintain relationships.  She \n14  has problems with visual processing and controlling her temper and emotions.  She \n15  has been in foster care since she was very young and experienced trauma at an early \n16  age, which has impaired her cognitive and emotional functioning.  Her behavioral \n17  issues include departures from school and class without permission, immature \n18  social relations, physical and verbal aggression to peers, and defiance toward staff.  \n19  She has difficulty adjusting to change and is easily frustrated when faced with new \n20  or challenging tasks.  \n21  78.  When she was in second grade and attended a neighborhood school, \n22  Deborah was reading at grade level and was close to grade level in other areas.  \n23  Focus Point has failed to help her to make progress academically.  She wants to \n24  attend a Pasadena USD neighborhood school.   \n25  79.  The District placed Deborah in dual enrollment at a neighborhood \n26  middle school for fifth grade.  However, Deborah was not provided with school-\n27  based behavioral services at the middle school, and she was not successful in dual \n28  enrollment.  She returned to full-time enrollment at Focus Point in early 2015.   \n   17 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 21 of 31   Page ID #:21\n \n1  80.  The District has again placed Deborah in dual enrollment at a \n2  neighborhood middle school in January 2016.  This transition has not been well \n3  planned; Deborah only attends one class at the middle school—physical \n4  education—and loses valuable instructional time riding the school bus back and \n5  forth between Focus Point and the middle school each day.  Because she does not \n6  receive school-based behavioral services, and she continues to have disability-\n7  related behaviors, she is at serious risk of returning to Focus Point.  The District \n8  does not have a plan for responding to her disability-related behaviors other than by \n9  returning Deborah to Focus Point.   \n10  81.  At Focus Point, when Deborah has become defiant or aggressive with \n11  peers, she has been restrained and sent to the “boring room” as punishment.   \n12  82.  With school-based behavioral services, Deborah could be educated in \n13  a Pasadena USD neighborhood school. \n14  Plaintiff Tanya Doe \n15  83.  Plaintiff Tanya Doe is 12 years old and in the sixth grade.  She \n16  attended Focus Point from June 2013, when she was finishing the third grade, to \n17  October 23, 2015.  Tanya is in foster care and lives in a group home in Pasadena.  \n18  Her court-appointed special advocate, F.H., is her guardian ad litem and brings this \n19  action on her behalf.  Tanya enjoys drawing and arts and crafts projects that involve \n20  working with her hands and putting things together.  She likes music.  She is \n21  articulate, with a strong ability to communicate verbally.  She has clear plans for \n22  the future:  she wants to live in a foster family and have a dog, and to spend more \n23  time with her siblings, who are also in foster care. \n24  84.  Tanya has a behavior-related disability that impairs her ability to learn, \n25  read, concentrate, think, communicate, or develop and maintain relationships.  She \n26  has a history of trauma and loss as a result of frequent moves while in foster care \n27  and being separated from her four siblings.  Her behaviors have included leaving \n28  classes without permission and walking away from campus, physical and verbal \n   18 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 22 of 31   Page ID #:22\n \n1  aggression toward staff, and tantrums in class.  She has difficulty controlling her \n2  anger and sadness when she is teased, and has difficulty completing school work.   \n3  85.  Tanya attended neighborhood schools from first through third grade.  \n4  In January 2013, Tanya moved to the group home where she currently lives and \n5  enrolled in a Pasadena USD neighborhood elementary school, where she had \n6  serious behavior issues.  The District did not provide her with school-based \n7  behavioral services at her neighborhood school.  Instead, the District reduced her \n8  schedule to a half day. \n9  86.  In June 2013, the District transferred Tanya to Focus Point.  At Focus \n10  Point, Tanya has had virtually no opportunity to learn or practice social skills.  Staff \n11  has tried to control her behavior through use of dangerous restraints and placement \n12  in the “boring room.”  In one instance, Tanya received a black eye while staff \n13  restrained her.  She feels that people at Focus Point do not listen to her.  Tanya \n14  made almost no academic progress while at Focus Point.   \n15  87.  Through advocacy by Tanya’s guardian ad litem, Tanya finally was \n16  able to transfer to McKinley Middle School on October 23, 2015, after attending \n17  fourth and fifth grade at Focus Point.   \n18  88.  Tanya is at serious risk of returning to Focus Point.  The District did \n19  not plan for her transition, and she has not been provided school-based behavioral \n20  services at McKinley.  As a result, she is having behavior issues at the school.  \n21  Recently she walked away from the school campus.  She was found by group home \n22  staff walking around downtown Pasadena.  Defendants do not have a plan for \n23  responding to her behavior issues at school other than by returning Tanya to Focus \n24  Point.   \n25  89.  With school-based behavioral services, Tanya could be educated in a \n26  Pasadena USD neighborhood school. \n27 \n28 \n   19 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 23 of 31   Page ID #:23\n \n1  Plaintiff Eric Doe \n2  90.  Plaintiff Eric Doe is 11 years old and in the sixth grade at a \n3  neighborhood middle school in Pasadena USD.  He attended fifth grade at Focus \n4  Point.  He lives in Pasadena with his great aunt, G.B., who is his guardian ad litem \n5  and brings this action on his behalf.  Eric is an intelligent and precocious young \n6  man.  He enjoys learning, reading, and riding his scooter, but his passion is \n7  basketball.  He is interested in working in the sports industry or in television as a \n8  newscaster.   \n9  91.  Eric has a behavior-related disability that impairs his ability to learn, \n10  read, concentrate, think, communicate, or develop and maintain relationships.  He \n11  has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), \n12  mood disorder and anxiety disorder among other conditions.  He experienced early \n13  trauma in his life, and was separated from his siblings.  His behaviors include \n14  defiance, difficulty controlling his anger, and leaving class when he wants to avoid \n15  a task.   \n16  92.  Despite being intellectually capable, Eric has struggled academically \n17  because of his disability, particularly with writing.  His frustration with writing \n18  often leads to behavior outbursts.  On occasion, Eric has fought with peers over \n19  disagreements or when provoked.  Rather than deescalating his behavior or using \n20  positive behavior interventions, Focus Point staff restrained Eric and took him to \n21  “the boring room.”   \n22  93.  As a result of Eric’s great-aunt and guardian ad litem’s persistent \n23  advocacy, Eric was allowed to begin dual enrollment, with two class periods at the \n24  District’s Marshall Fundamental School and his other classes at Focus Point.  Soon \n25  after, Eric began full-time enrollment at Marshall, where he has joined the \n26  basketball team.  He plays basketball at recess and participates in P.E. classes.   \n27  94.  Eric continues to have disability-related behaviors.  He is not receiving \n28  school-based behavioral services and is at serious risk of returning to Focus Point.   \n   20 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 24 of 31   Page ID #:24\n \n1  Defendants do not have a plan for responding to his disability-related behaviors \n2  other than by returning Eric to Focus Point.   \n3  95.  With school-based behavioral services, Eric could be educated in a \n4  Pasadena USD neighborhood school. \n5  Plaintiff Walter Doe \n6  96.  Plaintiff Walter Doe is seventeen years old and in the twelfth grade at \n7  Focus Point.  He lives with his parents in Pasadena.  His mother, M.F., is his \n8  guardian ad litem and brings this action on his behalf.  Walter is very charismatic.  \n9  He is also thoughtful, creative and technologically savvy.  He frequently uses his \n10  cell phone to make videos, and is interested in learning about video production.  He \n11  aspires to be a stage and concert lighting technician.   \n12  97.  Walter has a behavior-related disability that impairs his ability to learn, \n13  read, concentrate, think, communicate, or develop and maintain relationships.  He \n14  has been diagnosed with depression, a generalized anxiety disorder, and a specific \n15  learning disability, among other conditions.  He has engaged in self-injurious and \n16  disruptive behavior.  He has had difficulty completing work, is frequently absent or \n17  tardy without excuse, and has been defiant toward teaching staff.     \n18  98.  Walter has struggled academically since kindergarten as a result of his \n19  disability.  The District never provided him with school-based behavioral services.  \n20  After repeated problems in neighborhood schools, it transferred Walter to Focus \n21  Point for eleventh grade. \n22  99.  After two years at Focus Point, Walter’s behaviors have not improved.  \n23  He continues to be sent to the “boring room” when he is defiant with staff.  At \n24  times, being sent there has caused his behavior to escalate.  Walter is frustrated and \n25  angry about being unable to transfer from Focus Point to a neighborhood high \n26  school.  \n27  100.  With school-based behavioral services, Walter could be educated in a \n28  Pasadena USD neighborhood school. \n   21 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 25 of 31   Page ID #:25\n \n1  Plaintiff Evan Doe \n2  101.  Plaintiff Evan Doe is 14 years old and in the ninth grade at Focus \n3  Point, which he has attended since May 2015.  He lives with his mother, C.M., who \n4  is his guardian ad litem and brings this action on his behalf.  Evan is close with his \n5  family and siblings, and loves sports and athletics.  When he attended a \n6  neighborhood school, he enjoyed physical education and sports, including playing \n7  soccer and basketball at lunch with other students.  This helped him to focus in his \n8  classes.   \n9  102.  Evan has a behavior-related disability that impairs his ability to learn, \n10  read, concentrate, think, communicate, or develop and maintain relationships.  He \n11  has been diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD, among other conditions.  Evan’s \n12  behaviors include talking out of turn in class, using inappropriate language, leaving \n13  classes or arriving late to classes that are challenging for him, verbal aggression, \n14  and physical aggression to peers. \n15  103.  Although Evan is only 14 years old, he is 6’3” tall and over 200 \n16  pounds.  Evan is able to concentrate better and perform better academically when \n17  he has opportunities for physical activity throughout the school day, including P.E. \n18  class, recreation at recess and lunch, and organized sports.   \n19  104.  As a result of Evan’s increasing behavior problems, the District \n20  transferred him to Focus Point for the ninth grade.  \n21  105.  At Focus Point, Evan does not have the opportunity to attend a \n22  physical education class.  The campus does not have a field or track on which \n23  students can run and play to release extra energy and anxiety.  Students have \n24  limited opportunities to engage in play and recreation.  Evan would like to play \n25  interscholastic sports, especially basketball, but such activities are not offered at \n26  Focus Point. \n27 \n28 \n   22 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 26 of 31   Page ID #:26\n \n1  106.  Evan has observed other students being restrained and dragged into the \n2  the “boring room” at Focus Point, which Evan calls “the padded room.”  He is \n3  worried about being forced into the “padded room” himself.    \n4  107.  In October 2015, Defendants let Evan participate in Focus Point’s dual \n5  enrollment program.  He began attending Pasadena High School one month after \n6  the classes had begun.  He spent mornings at Pasadena High School and afternoons \n7  at Focus Point.  His mid-day bus trip disrupted his school day.   \n8  108.  Pasadena USD did not provide Evan school-based behavioral services \n9  at Pasadena High School and, as a result, he was not successful there.  After 10 \n10  weeks, the District ended Evan’s dual enrollment and sent him back full-time to \n11  Focus Point.   \n12  109.  Placement at Focus Point has not been effective in improving Evan’s \n13  behavior in school.  To the contrary, it has eroded his self-esteem and exacerbated \n14  his disability-related behaviors.  Evan wants to return to Pasadena High School \n15  including because he feels stigmatized at Focus Point.   \n16  110.  With school-based behavioral services, Evan could be educated in a \n17  Pasadena USD neighborhood school. \n18  D.  The Plaintiff Class \n19  111.  These named Plaintiffs are not alone in their experiences in Pasadena \n20  USD and at Focus Point.  Their experiences are endured by the scores of students \n21  with a behavior-related disability in the proposed Plaintiff class.  These students \n22  suffer the same injuries and require the same relief as the named Plaintiffs.  \n23  112.  The proposed class consists of:  “All Pasadena USD students who, \n24  now or in the future, are placed at Focus Point or are at serious risk of being placed \n25  at Focus Point.”  A student is at “serious risk” of being placed at Focus Point if the \n26  student (a) is being considered for placement at Focus Point, or (b) has been \n27  recently transitioned from Focus Point to a neighborhood school and is having \n28  behavior problems at school.   \n   23 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 27 of 31   Page ID #:27\n \n1  113.  Defendants have failed to reasonably modify Pasadena USD’s \n2  programs and services to provide the named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class with \n3  the school-based behavioral services they need to enjoy an equal education and to \n4  be educated in Pasadena USD neighborhood schools. \n5  COUNT I \nVIOLATION OF  \n6  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n42 U.S.C. § 12132 \n7 \n8  114.  Plaintiffs re-allege the allegations in all preceding paragraphs as \n9  though fully set forth herein.  \n10  115.  Named Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff class are individuals \n11  with a disability within the meaning of the ADA.  Their disabilities substantially \n12  limit one or more major life activities, including learning, reading, concentrating, \n13  thinking, communicating, or developing and maintaining relationships.  \n14  116.  As school-age children who live in the District, they are qualified to \n15  participate in Defendants’ educational programs and services.  42 U.S.C. \n16  § 12131(2).  \n17  117.  Defendant Pasadena USD is a public entity within the meaning of the \n18  ADA.  Defendant MacDonald is an official responsible for running this public \n19  entity and supervising its operations. 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  \n20  118.  Through the acts and omissions described above, Defendants are \n21  violating the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, by:  \n22  a.  Denying named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class an opportunity \n23  to participate in and benefit from educational services that is \n24  equal to that afforded other students;  \n25  b.  Denying named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class educational \n26  services that are as effective in affording equal opportunity to \n27  obtain the same result, gain the same benefit, or reach the same \n28  level of achievement as that provided other students;  \n   24 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 28 of 31   Page ID #:28\n \n1  c.  Denying named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class the opportunity \n2  to receive educational programs and services in the most \n3  integrated setting appropriate to their needs;  \n4  d.  Failing to reasonably modify Pasadena USD’s programs and \n5  services as needed to avoid discrimination against named \n6  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class; and  \n7  e.  Utilizing methods of administration that have the effect of \n8  defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the \n9  objectives of Defendants’ educational programs with respect to \n10  named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class.  \n11  119.  Granting relief to Plaintiffs would not fundamentally alter Defendants’ \n12  programs, services, and activities.  \n13  120.  The acts and omissions of Defendants have caused and will continue to \n14  cause named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class to suffer irreparable harm, and they \n15  have no adequate remedy at law.  \n16  121.  Under the ADA, Plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs as \n17  appropriate and permitted by law, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205. \n18  COUNT II \nVIOLATION OF  \n19  CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE § 11135 \n \n20 \n21  122.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n22  in the foregoing paragraphs.  \n23  123.  Section 11135(a) of the California Government Code provides in \n24  pertinent part: \"No person in the State of California shall, on the basis of . . . \n25  disability, be unlawfully denied the benefits of, or be unlawfully subjected to \n26  discrimination under, any program or activity that is funded directly by the state or \n27  receives any financial assistance from the state.”  \n28 \n   25 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 29 of 31   Page ID #:29\n \n1  124.  Pasadena USD is a public agency that receives financial assistance \n2  from the State of California.  \n3  125.  Through their acts and omissions described herein, Defendants are \n4  violating California Government Code § 11135 by unlawfully denying Plaintiffs \n5  and the Plaintiff class the benefits of, and unlawfully subjecting them to \n6  discrimination under, Defendants’ educational programs and activities.  \n7  126.  Defendants’ actions have caused and will continue to cause named \n8  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class to suffer irreparable harm, and they have no \n9  adequate remedy at law.  Because Defendants’ discriminatory conduct is ongoing, \n10  declaratory and injunctive relief are appropriate remedies.  \n11  127.  Plaintiffs and Class Members are also entitled to reasonable attorneys’ \n12  fees and costs in filing this action.  \n13  COUNT III \nVIOLATION OF DISABLED PERSONS ACT, \n14  CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE § 54 ET SEQ. \n \n15 \n16  128.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained \n17  in the foregoing paragraphs.  \n18  129.  Through the acts and omissions described herein, Defendants are \n19  violating California Civil Code § 54, which provides that “[i]ndividuals with \n20  disabilities or medical conditions have the same rights as the general public to the \n21  full and free use of . . . public facilities.”  \n22  130.  Under California Civil Code § 54(c), a violation of the ADA also \n23  constitutes a violation of California Civil Code §§ 54 et seq.  \n24  131.  Plaintiffs and Class Members are persons with disabilities within the \n25  meaning of California Civil Code § 54(b)(1). \n26  132.  Pasadena USD provides public facilities, within the meaning of \n27  California Civil Code §§ 54 et seq.  \n28 \n   26 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 30 of 31   Page ID #:30\n \n1  133.  By the acts and omissions described herein, Defendants are violating \n2  California Civil Code § 54.  \n3  134.  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are entitled to recover reasonable \n4  attorneys’ fees and costs in an action to enforce California Civil Code §§ 54.3(a), \n5  55. \n6  135.  Defendants’ actions have caused and will continue to cause named \n7  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class to suffer irreparable harm, and they have no \n8  adequate remedy at law.  Because Defendants’ discriminatory conduct is ongoing, \n9  declaratory and injunctive reliefs are appropriate remedies.  \n10  RELIEF REQUESTED \n11  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that the Court grant the following relief:  \n12  A.  Order that Plaintiffs may maintain this action as a class action pursuant \n13  to Rule 23(b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n14  B.  Order and declare that Defendants are violating the rights of the named \n15  Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, et seq., \n16  California Government Code § 11135, and California Civil Code §§ 54 et seq.  \n17  C.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants, their successors in \n18  office, agents, employees and assigns, and all persons acting in concert with them \n19  to provide named Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff class with the school-based behavioral \n20  services they need to enjoy an equal education and to receive educational programs \n21  and services in the most integrated setting, as required by Title II of the ADA.  \n22  D.  Award Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs as appropriate and \n23  permitted by law, including pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12205.  \n24  E.  Any other relief as this Court finds just and proper. \n25   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n   27 \nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n  \nla-1310699\n\nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 1   Filed 02/11/16   Page 31 of 31   Page ID #:31\n \n1  Dated:  February 11, 2016 MORRISON & FOERSTER LLP\n2 \nBy:   /s/ Robert S.

Madigan, 503 U.S.  140, \n4\n112  S.Ct.  1081,  1086,  117  L.Ed.2d291(1992).    The \nIDEA’s  exhaustion  requirement  also  recognizes  the \n5\ntraditionally  strong  state  and  local  responsibility.    The \nIDEA  charges  local  educational  agencies  with  the \n6\nresponsibility of establishing programs to provide disabled \nstudents with a “free appropriate public education.”  See \n7\n20 U.S.C. § 1414(a).  At the same time, the states have \nprimary responsibility for ensuring that local educational \n8\nagencies comply with the requirements of the IDEA.  See \n20  U.S.C.  §§  1412(6),  1414(b).    Exhaustion  of  the \n9\nadministrative process allows for the exercise of discretion \n \nO\nand  educational  expertise  by  state  and  local  agencies, \nM\n10\nO affords  full  exploration  of  technical  educational  issues, \nR\nfurthers  development  of  a  complete  factual  record,  and \n(cid:16)  11 promotes judicial efficiency by giving these agencies the \n  (cid:25) \nD (cid:25) first  opportunity  to  correct  shortcomings  in  their \nUU (cid:28)TE !  12 educational programs for disabled children.

In  concluding  that  exhaustion  of  administrative \n2 remedies was required the court held: \n3\nEligibility criteria and methodology are classic examples \nof the kind of technical questions of educational policy \n4\nbest resolved with the benefit of agency expertise and a \nfully  developed  administrative  record.    Cf.  Hendrick \n5\nHudson Cent. School Dist. Bd. Of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 \nU.S.  176,  208,  102  S.Ct.  3034,  3051,  73  L.Ed.2d  16 \n6\n(1973)).    Far  from  presenting  purely  legal  issues, \nadjudicating the validity of these policies requires a fact-\n7\nspecific inquiry into their operation in an individual case. \n(Id. at 1305-06.) \n8\nFurther, the court determined that exhaustion is required where, \n9\n \nO\nA dispute over such eligibility criteria policies concerns, in \nM\n10\nO essences, questions about identification and evaluation of \nR\nindividual disabled children, precisely the kind of dispute \n(cid:16)  11 to which the IDEA’s administrative scheme is addressed.  \n  (cid:25) \nD (cid:25) See  20  U.S.C.  §1415(b)(1)(E).

(20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).)  \n2 The preponderance of the evidence standard “is by no means an invitation to \n3 the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the \n4 school authorities which they review.”  (Rowley, supra, 458 U.S. at 206.)  Rather, \n5 the  Court  must  give  “due  weight”  to  the  administrative  proceedings.   (Id.; \n6 Capistrano  Unified  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Wartenberg,  59  F.3d  884,  891-92  (9th  Cir. \n7 1995).)  More specifically, the Court “should give substantial weight to the hearing \n8 officer's  decision  if  the  court  finds  that  the  decision  was  careful,  impartial  and \n9 sensitive to the complexities presented.”  (Ojai, supra, 4 F3d at 1476.)

Clark County Sch. \n21 Dist.,  267  F.3d  877,  887  (9th  Cir.  2001)  (“complete  de  novo  review  is \n22 inappropriate”).)  \n23 In  particular,  the  Ninth  Circuit  describes  the  proceeding  where  the \n24 administrative hearing decision is challenged as a “puzzling procedural problem” \n25 that arises whenever the district court adjudicates administrative appeals, because \n26 the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not plainly speak to how such appeals \n27 should be handled:   \n28\n  - 13 -   \nSEPARATE STATEMENT OF UNCONTROVERTED FACTS AND \n   \n006237.00006 \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR SUMMARY \n14856320.2 \nJUDGMENT \n \n\n   \nCase 2:16-cv-00984-GJS   Document 95   Filed 01/20/17   Page 14 of 17   Page ID #:1038\n \n1 “It is hard to see what else the district court could do as a \npractical  matter  under  the  statute  except  read  the \n2 administrative  record,  consider  the  new  evidence,  and \nmake an independent judgment based on a preponderance \n3 of  the  evidence  and  giving  due  weight  to  the  hearing \nofficer's determinations.  The district court's independent \n4 judgment  is  not  controlled  by  the  hearing  officer's \nrecommendations, but neither may it be made without due \n5 deference.”  (Capistrano, supra, 59 F.3d at 892) \n6 Exhaustion is not required if the IDEA’s administrative procedures cannot \n7 redress the injury.  (McCormick v. Waukegan Sch. Dist. #60, 374 F.3d 564 (7th Cir. \n8 2004); Porter v. Board of Trs. Of Manhattan Beach Unified Sch. Dist., 307 F.3d \n9 1064  (9th  Cir.  2002)  (exhaustion  was  futile  where  the  parents  claimed  that  the \n \nO\nM 10 district failed to implement orders issued by an Independent Hearing Officer).)  As \nO\nR\n(cid:16)  11 has already been explained above, exhaustion is required because OAH can provide \n  (cid:25) \nD (cid:25)\nUU (cid:28)TE !  12 relief  to  redress  Plaintiffs’  alleged  injuries  in  the  form  of  ordering  different \n(cid:8)L(cid:8)RDELSON OYA  PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION ATTORNEYS AT LAW CDS(cid:8)SNTER OURT RIVE OUTH UI(cid:8)C(cid:29)(cid:25)(cid:30)(cid:25)(cid:28)(cid:31)(cid:29)(cid:28) RITOS ALIFORNIA \"#$ (cid:23)% $(cid:28)(cid:31)(cid:28)(cid:23)(cid:25)(cid:25) ELEPHONE   F\"#$ (cid:23)% $(cid:28)(cid:31)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:28) AX      11113456 e(2SSd0tueu1dec5,ea0 ntP5ito0a, nr3eaO0nl0 At sp(H lAao cnuCe gmaB 1seee2nh ,ta sN2l f0oa 1.no 5df2 )/;o0S r1Ct u4atdh0pee3ins 0ttp1 rra0von4.v o iL s(UoiUosnnn ie Afioxelpfad em sdSciicthtoehosd.o   lDS-Dbcishaetsc..  eivsDdi. o isbPntea).,h r ea(OnvJutAi oloH rna1 l 7 CBs,a eeshr2eva0 il1cfN 4eoos)f;..     \nN A  CEERT\nA (cid:25) C 17 Fairfield-Suisun Unified Sch.

Student, OAH Case No. 2007050139 (Oct 9, \n(cid:8)N  (cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:25)\nO 18 2007).)   \nS\nN\nKI 19 The United States Department of Education Office of Special Education and \nT\nA\n20 Rehabilitative  Services  (“OSERS”),  issued  an  Advisory  Letter  Dated  August  1, \n21 2016 which specifically discusses school districts’ obligations to students under the \n22 IDEA and establishes why exhaustion is required under the IDEA in the instant \n23 action.  (See, U.S. Dept. of Educ., OSERS Dear Colleague Advisory Letter (Aug 1, \n24 2016).)  Therefore, any argument that exhaustion is futile should fail. \n25 Exhaustion may be excused in cases where the case involves widespread, \n26 systemic violations of the IDEA.  (J.G. v. Board of Educ. of Rochester City Sch. \n27 Dist., 648 F. Supp. 1452, 1456-58 (2d Cir. 1987).)

Plaintiffs admit that the District does not have a written \n3 policy that is discriminatory, however, they believe such a discriminatory pattern \n4 and practice exists within the District.   \n5 The  Ninth  Circuit  has  already  determined  that  students  cannot  avoid  the \n6 IDEA’s exhaustion requirements simply by dressing up their complaints to read as a \n7 challenge to district  practice or  pattern of behavior,  when  in  reality  it is  just a \n8 dispute over individual services.   \n9 The Ninth Circuit has held that where claims involved only one component of \n \nO\nM\n10 the school district’s special education program, the claims neither rose to systemic \nO\nR\n(cid:16)  11 proportions nor required structural relief.

Plaintiffs must demonstrate in addition that the underlying \n3 purposes of exhaustion would not be furthered by enforcing the requirement.  This \n4 they have failed to do.
