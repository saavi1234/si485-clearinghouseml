On May 25, 2012, Hawaii Disability Rights Center (Hawaii DRC), Hawaii&rsquo;s P&amp;A, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii. Represented by itself, Hawaii DRC alleged that the Hawaii Department of Education violated the under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act) when they refused to provide DRC with records requested under its investigative authority. Judge Alan Cooke Kay presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit began after parents of a student with disabilities contacted Hawaii DRC. The parents alleged that their child was abused by a staff member at a Department operated elementary school. The school denied the parent&rsquo;s request for records concerning the incident and follow-up investigation, so the parents subsequently notified Hawaii DRC. Hawaii DRC requested the information under its DD Act investigations authority, but the Department denied their request. On July 9, 2012, Hawaii DRC voluntarily dismissed this matter.</p>",
