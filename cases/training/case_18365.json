    "summary": "<p>This case is about a Protection and Advocacy agency&rsquo;s (P&amp;A) access authority to interview relevant parties during an investigation. Iowa Protection and Advocacy Services (Iowa P&amp;A) filed this lawsuit on June 3, 2004, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa. Iowa P&amp;A filed this lawsuit against Tanager, Inc., a private facility offering youth inpatient psychiatric services, under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) Act. Represented by a private law firm, Iowa P&amp;A sought declarative relief that Tanager violated the PAIMI Act by interfering with Iowa P&amp;A&rsquo;s investigation after a facility resident disappeared, as well as a permanent injunction requiring Tanager to provide Iowa P&amp;A with reasonable access to their facility to conduct investigations. Tanager filed a counterclaim for defamation under state law against Iowa P&amp;A and its Executive Director for public statements made about the investigation. The court severed the defamation claim from the PAIMI Act case. Judge Linda R. Reade presided over both matters.</p>\r\n<p>In June 2004, Iowa P&amp;A opened an investigation into a resident disappearance at Tanager. Iowa P&amp;A requested interviews with two residents of the cottage where the resident lived before disappearing, but Tanager only allowed them to interview one resident. Iowa P&amp;A opened a second investigation in July 2004 where they requested contact information for twelve residents of the cottage. Tanager only permitted interviews with four residents, with a therapist present, that passed a clinical status review and whose parents or guardians consented to the interview request.</p>\r\n<p>In reviewing Iowa P&amp;A&rsquo;s request for injunctive relief, the court focused on whether Tanager provided Iowa P&amp;A with reasonable unaccompanied access to interview residents during their investigation. The court rejected Tanager&rsquo;s claims that Iowa P&amp;A were a state actor subject to the Fourth Amendment search and seizure requirements, and that the PAIMI Act violated the Constitution. The court determined that Tanager unreasonably interfered with the investigation because they barred Iowa P&amp;A from interviewing residents without the consent of their parent or guardian, and only permitted interviews with a therapist present. However, the court also found that Tanager acted reasonably when they reviewed resident&rsquo;s clinical statuses before allowing interviews, and that Iowa P&amp;A exceeded its PAIMI Act authority because they did not notify Tanager that they would not interview the four residents. Tanager removed these residents from their programming for that day so that Iowa P&amp;A could interview them, and this unreasonably interfered with their treatment. The court stated that they should have notified Tanager at least 1 hour before the scheduled interview.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, the court granted Iowa P&amp;A a permanent injunction allowing reasonable unaccompanied access to the facility to conduct interviews despite finding that the plaintiff also acted unreasonably. Although Tanager appealed this decision on the grounds that the PAIMI Act violated the Constitution, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found that the case was moot. On November 18, 2005, the case was dismissed with prejudice. On March 9, 2006, Tanager dismissed its defamation counterclaim with prejudice. The case is now closed.</p>",

The court granted Iowa P&A a permanent enjoinment for reasonable unaccompanied access to the facility while minimizing interference with facility programming.  The facility appealed the enjoinment, but the court dismissed the case with prejudice because Iowa P&A completed their investigation. The case closed on March 9, 2006.",

The first matter is Counterclaim Plaintiff\nTanager Placeโs Motion for Pretrial Determination (docket no. 51).  The second matter is\na Motion for Summary Judgment filed by Counterclaim Defendant Iowa Protection and\nAdvocacy Services, Inc. (โIP&Aโ) and Third-Party Defendant Sylvia Piper (docket no.\n59).\nII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe facts giving rise to this dispute are set forth in a prior order of this court.  See\ngenerally Iowa Protection & Advocacy Servs., Inc. v. Tanager Place, 2004 WL 2270002\n(N.D. Iowa 2004).  Only those facts pertinent to this counterclaim will be reiterated here.\nTanager Place operates a psychiatric medical institution for children (โPMICโ) in\nCedar Rapids.  On May 29, 2004, R.J., a mentally-ill juvenile resident of the PMIC at\nTanager Place, ran away.  His clothes were later found next to the Cedar River after\nwitnesses reported a person jumping off a nearby bridge.  \nOn June 1, 2004, Tanager Place notified IP&A that R.J. had run away and may\nhave drowned.  IP&A is a private, non-profit Iowa corporation that is authorized to\ninvestigate incidents of abuse and neglect of mentally-ill individuals.  See 42 U.S.C. ยง\n2\n\n10805(a)(1)(A).  IP&A is funded entirely with federal money but does not report to any\ngovernmental agencies about its work.\nAfter receiving notification of R.J.โs disappearance, IP&A determined there was\nprobable cause that R.J. had suffered neglect or abuse at Tanager Place.  IP&A faxed\nTanager Place a letter, in which it announced its federal authority and advised that it was\nconducting an investigation.  In a second letter faxed the same day, IP&A specifically\nasked for a list of the names of Tanager Placeโs residents, as well as the names and contact\ninformation of the residentsโ guardians.\nOn June 2, 2004, IP&A sent two investigators to Tanager Place.  The investigators\nasked to see R.J.โs file and to interview staff.  George Estle, the Chief Executive Officer\nof Tanager Place, told the investigators that the Iowa Department of Inspections and\nAppeals (DIA) had R.J.โs file.  Estle promised the investigators they could see the file\nwhen DIA returned it.  In the meantime, Estle allowed the investigators to interview staff,\ntour the facility, and take photographs. \nThe investigators then asked to interview two residents who had lived with R.J.\nEstle told the investigators that he would first have to consult with the Tanager Place\ntreatment team to make sure an interview would not adversely affect the children.  The\ntreatment team, however, had already left for the day.  The investigators left.\nThe same day, IP&Aโs legal director, Edie Bogzczyk, called Tanager Placeโs\nattorney, Vernon Squires, to see if IP&A could interview the residents.  Squires told\nBogzczyk he did not think Estle would permit IP&A to interview the residents.  Sylvia\nPiper, the Executive Director of IP&A, called Estle to see if the two could work things\nout.  Estle did not return Piperโs phone call.\nOn June 3, 2004, the investigators returned to Tanager Place.  They picked up a\ncopy of R.J.โs file and again asked to speak with the two residents.  Estle told the\ninvestigators he had not yet spoken with the treatment team.   The investigators waited\n3\n\nwhile Estle spoke with the treatment team.\nAfter consulting the treatment team, Estle permitted the investigators to interview\nonly one of the two residents.  The treatment team determined the other resident, C.S.,\nwas too fragile to talk with the investigators at that time.  IP&A then filed this lawsuit,\nwhich seeks to fully enforce its federal mandate.\nOn June 5, 2004, the Cedar Rapids Gazette, a local newspaper, published an article\nabout the lawsuit.  The article quoted Piper as saying:\n(1) โTanager Place has done everything within their power to\nroadblock our investigation.โ\nand\n(2) โWhen we went to the location, they refused to provide us\naccess and delayed our ability to review records.โ\n \nThe Gazette article was republished in other newspapers across Iowa.\nOn June 11, 2004, a second Gazette article quoted Piper as saying:\n(3) โWe believe these children were in immediate jeopardy for\ntheir safety.โ\nThe same article noted that during the past twelve months there were ninety-two reports\nof runaways from Tanager Place.\nIII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nAs indicated, on June 3, 2004, IP&A filed a Complaint against Tanager Place.1\nIP&A alleged Tanager Place was interfering with IP&Aโs right to access residents, in\nviolation of the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986 (the\nโPAMII Actโ), 42 U.S.C. ยง 10801, et seq.  IP&A sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n1 IP&A also named Tanager, Inc., the non-profit Iowa corporation which runs\nTanager Place, as a defendant.  It is not involved in the counterclaim. \n4\n\nOn June 14, 2004, Tanager Place filed a Counterclaim against IP&A.  In Count I,\nTanager Place sought a declaratory judgment that (1) IP&Aโs investigation constituted an\nunlawful search and seizure and (2) the PAMII Act was unconstitutional both on its face\nand as applied.  In Count II, Tanager Place asserted a state law slander claim against IP&A\nand Piper, whom Tanager Place joined as a third-party defendant.  Tanager Place\ncontended Piperโs statements to the Gazette โconstitute[d] slander, both per se and per\nquod.โ  Tanager Place alleged Piper made the statements in the scope of her employment,\nand thus IP&A was liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior.\nAt a hearing conducted on June 16, 2004, IP&A orally moved to sever Count II of\nTanager Placeโs counterclaim from the rest of the case.  The court granted the motion.\nA bench trial was held on IP&Aโs claims and Count I of the counterclaim on July\n20, 2004.  On September 30, 2004, the court issued a permanent injunction requiring\nTanager Place to provide IP&A reasonable access in accordance with the PAMII Act and\nthe regulations promulgated pursuant to it.  See generally Iowa Protection & Advocacy\nServs., 2004 WL 2270002, at *23 (citing 42 U.S.C. ยง 10805 et seq. and 42 C.F.R. ยง\n51.42 et seq.).\nFollowing trial, Tanager Place filed a โMotion for Pretrial Determination of\nDefamation Per Seโon Count II of its counterclaim.   Tanager Place asked the court to rule\nthat Piperโs first two statements to the Gazette  were โdefamatory per se under Iowa law.โ\nTanager Place alleged the statements were defamatory per se because they attacked its\nintegrity and moral character, as well as affected its business.\nIP&A and Piper filed a Resistance and a Motion for Summary Judgment.  In their\nResistance, IP&A and Piper insisted that Piperโs statements were not defamatory per se\nbecause they did not specifically charge Tanager Place with incompetence or lack of skill\nin its business.  In their Motion for Summary Judgment, IP&A and Piper argued they\nshould prevail as a matter of law because Piperโs statements were true and, in any event,\n5\n\nconstituted protected opinion.\nIn  what  follows,  the  court  considers  Tanager  Placeโs  Motion  for  Pretrial\nDetermination and IP&Aโs and Piperโs Motion for Summary Judgment.\nIV.  MOTION FOR PRETRIAL DETERMINATION\nIn its Motion for Pretrial Determination, Tanager Place asks this court to rule in\nadvance of trial that Piperโs first two statements to the Gazette were โdefamatory per se\nunder Iowa law.โ2  Before delving into Tanager Placeโs argument, a brief summary of\nIowa defamation law is necessary.\nA. The Law of Defamation in Iowa\nThe law of defamation provides redress for damage to reputation.  Kiesau v. Bantz,\n686 N.W.2d 164, 174 (Iowa 2004).  It โis composed of the twin torts of libel and\nslander.โ  Barreca v. Nickolas, 683 N.W.2d 111, 116 (Iowa 2004).  Whereas libel\ninvolves written statements, slander involves oral statements.   Kiesau, 686 N.W.2d at\n174.  The parties apparently assume this case involves slander because Tanager Place seeks\ncompensation for Piperโs oral statements to the Gazette.3  Because the court is not\n2 Although Tanager Place brought its Motion for Pretrial Determination pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 7(b)(1), the court treats it as a Motion for Summary\nJudgment pursuant to Rule 56.  For the applicable standard of review, see infra Part V.A.\n3 This is not the view of the authors of the Restatement, who write:\nA  publication  of  a  libel  may  be  made  by  an  oral\ncommunication that is intended to be, and is, reduced to\nwriting . . . [such as] when a statement is given orally to a\nnewspaper reporter and is published in the paper.  . . .[T]he\noral communication takes on the character of libel because of\nthe intended and actual embodiment in permanent form.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts ยง 568 cmt. f  (1977).  Recognition of this view is important\nbecause the Iowa Supreme Court often follows the Restatement in defamation law.  See,\ne.g., Barreca, 683 N.W.2d at 118 (adopting Restatement framework for determining\n6\n\npresented with an argument to the contrary, it likewise assumes the same.\nAn employer may be held liable for the defamatory statements of one of its\nemployees provided the statements were made while the employee was acting within the\nscope of her employment.  Huegerich v. IBP, Inc., 547 N.W.2d 216, 221 (Iowa 1996);\nVowles v. Yakish, 191 Iowa 368, 371-72, 179 N.W. 117, 119 (1920).  The parties agree\nthat Piper was acting within the scope of her employment when she made her statements\nabout Tanager Place.\nOrdinarily a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit must prove malice, falsity, and\ndamages.    Kerndt v. Rolling Hills Nat. Bank, 558 N.W.2d 410, 418 (Iowa 1997).    \nHowever, some statements are defamatory per se; that is, they\nare of such a nature that the court can presume as a matter of\nlaw that their publication will have a defamatory effect, even\nwithout  a  showing  by  the  plaintiff  of  malice,  falsity,  or\ndamage. In such cases, malice is presumed.  Defamatory\nstatements affecting a person in his or her business, trade,\nprofession, or office fall into this category, as do attacks on a\npersonโs integrity and moral character.\nId.  When the statement is unambiguous, the court decides whether a statement is\ndefamatory per se.  Vinson v. Linn-Mar Cmty. Sch. Dist., 360 N.W.2d 108, 116 (Iowa\n1984).\nTanager Place claims Piperโs first two statements to the Gazette were defamatory\nper se because they affected its business and attacked its integrity and moral character.4\nTanager Place claims these statements (i.e., โTanager Place has done everything within\nwhether a statement is qualifiedly privileged).  However, it appears the Iowa Supreme\nCourt has not yet had the occasion to consider this particular provision.\n4 In its reply brief, Tanager Place also asks the court to rule that Piperโs third\nstatement (i.e., โWe believe these children were in immediate jeopardy for their safety.โ)\nwas defamatory per se.  The court declines to consider this issue because Tanager Place\ndid not request such a determination in its original motion.  See LR 7.1(g).\n7\n\ntheir power to roadblock our investigation.โ and โ[T]hey refused to provide us access and\ndelayed our ability to review records.โ) implied it was hiding something about R.J.โs\ndisappearanceโan implication which, it alleges, eroded public confidence in its ability to\ncare for children and attacked its integrity and moral character.\nIP&A and Piper urge a narrower construction of Iowa law.  They contend Tanager\nPlace must prove Piperโs statements directly charged it with business incompetence or lack\nof skill; that is, to show her statements merely โaffectedโ Tanager Placeโs business or\nattacked its integrity or moral character is insufficient to prove defamation per se.\nThis court must decide how the Iowa Supreme Court would rule if faced with the\nsame arguments and facts.  See, e.g., Nebraska Plastics, Inc. v. Holland Colors Americas,\nInc., 408 F.3d 410, 419-20 (8th Cir. 2005).  Because the Iowa Supreme Court has applied\nthe broader standard in a number of slander cases, the court holds that to prove defamation\nper se it is sufficient to show Piperโs statements affected Tanager Placeโs business or\nattacked  its  integrity  or  moral  character.   See, e.g., Kerndt,  558  N.W.2d  at  418\n(โDefamatory statements affecting a person in his or her business, trade, profession, or\noffice  [are  defamatory  per  se],  as  [are]  attacks  on  a  personโs  integrity  and  moral\ncharacter.โ); Lara v. Thomas, 512 N.W.2d 777, 785 (Iowa 1994) (โAn attack on the\nintegrity and moral character of a party is [slanderous] per se.  Slanderous imputations\naffecting a person in his or her business, trade, profession, or office are also actionable\nwithout proof of actual harm.โ (Citations omitted, brackets in original.)); see also Vinson,\n360 N.W.2d at 116 (holding an attack on the honesty of an employee would be slander per\nse).\nIP&A and Piper rejoin that the Iowa Supreme Court recently cited a law review\narticle which opines that a narrower standard once existed in Iowa law for slander claims.\nSee Barreca, 683 N.W.2d at 116 (citing Patrick J. McNulty, The Law of Defamation: A\nPrimer for the Iowa Practitioner,  44  Drake  L.  Rev.  639,  650  (1996)  [hereinafter\n8\n\nMcNulty]5).  In Barreca, the Iowa Supreme Court only referenced this standard; the Iowa\nSupreme Court made clear that the issue of slander per se was not before it.  Id.; see also\nVinson, 360 N.W.2d at 116 (expressly declining โto determine . . . what differences exist\nin Iowa, if any, in the actionability of libel and slanderโ).  The court cannot find a single\nIowa case which definitively holds that slander per se is limited to the four well-defined\ncategories mentioned in the law review article and briefly referenced in Barreca.  Because\nthis court must rely upon what the Iowa Supreme Court has held, those cases in which the\nIowa Supreme Court has repeatedly applied the broader standard to slander per se claims\nare dispositive.\nB. Application of the Facts\nAlthough  the  court  concludes  the  broader  standard  should  apply,  the  court\nnonetheless declines to rule as a matter of law that Piperโs statements are defamatory per\nse.  The  statements are susceptible to two reasonable constructions, and therefore the jury\n5 In that article, the author wrote:\nConsistent with the common law, the Iowa Supreme Court has\ntreated verbal defamation almost the exact opposite of libel.\nWhereas all written defamatory statements whose danger to\nreputation is facially apparent are actionable per se, only four\ncategories of oral accusations are actionable without proof of\nfalsity, malice, and special harm.  Known as slander per se,\nthese categories consist of charges of: (1) indictable criminal\nconduct  punishable  by  imprisonment  or  involving  moral\nturpitude; (2) loathsome disease; (3) business incompetence or\nlack of skill in an occupation by which one earns a living; and\n(4) unchastity of a woman or a married man.\nMcNulty, 44 Drake L. Rev. at 650. But see id. (conceding that โ[n]ot many slander per\nse cases have been decided by the Iowa Supreme Courtโ and โ[m]any are of distant vintage\nand concern a charge of unchastityโ).\n9\n\nshould decide if they are defamatory per se.  For example, the jury could find Piperโs\nstatements about โroadblockingโ and โdelayingโ IP&A investigators to mean that Tanager\nPlace was hiding something about R.J.โs disappearance.  In this sense, Piperโs statements\ncould be construed to attack Tanager Placeโs integrity and affect its business.  That said,\nthe jury could just as easily find these same statements only indicated Tanager Place was\nnot cooperating with IP&Aโs investigationโbecause it was jealously guarding its privacy,\nnot covering something up.\nThe case at bar is similar to several decided by the Iowa Supreme Court over the\nyears.    These  cases  hold  that  when  a  statement  is  susceptible  to  two  reasonable\nconstructions, the jury should decide whether the statement was defamatory per se.  For\nexample, in Vinson the defendant orally stated that the plaintiff was fired for making\nincorrect entries on her time card.  360 N.W.2d at 114.  The district court let the jury\ndecide whether the statement was slander per se.  Id. at 116.  The Iowa Supreme Court\naffirmed.  It wrote:\nThe  rule  is  that  when  the  language  of  the  publication  is\nunambiguous,  the  issue  of  whether  the  publication  is\ndefamatory per se is for the court. If the language is capable\nof  two  meanings  including  the  one  ascribed  by  the\ncomplainant, it is for the jury to say whether such meaning\nwas the one conveyed.\n. . . .\nWe believe that a statement that an employee was fired for\nmaking incorrect entries on her time card could reasonably be\ntaken as imputing dishonesty to the employee. Therefore we\nfind that [the defendantโs] statement could be understood as\ndefamatory per se. The trial court did not err in allowing the\njury to determine whether the defamatory meaning was the one\nconveyed. \nId.; accord Jackson v. Ferguson, 181 Iowa 1192, 1193-94, 165 N.W. 326, 326 (1917)\n10\n\n(finding defendantโs statement that his wife and her female friend were โmaking dates with\nmenโ while he was away was not, as a matter of law, slander per se; although the\nstatement could imply โan appointment for some unlawful or immoral purposeโ it could\nalso mean something innocent, such as a โtheater party,โ โcard party,โ or โjoy-riding\npartyโ).  Because Piperโs statements about Tanager Place are likewise capable of two\nconstructions, the court will refrain from ruling on the issue as a matter of law and instruct\nthe jury on both defamation and defamation per se.  See Kerndt, 558 N.W.2d at 418  (โIf\na statement can have two reasonable constructions, the jury may then reach one of three\npossible conclusions: (1) the statement was reasonably understood as defamatory per se;\n(2) the statement was understood as defamatory, but not defamatory per se (the jury must\nthen determine whether the plaintiff has shown malice, falsity, and damage); or (3) the\nstatement was not understood as defamatory.โ).\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court denies Tanager Placeโs Motion for Pretrial\nDetermination.\nV.  MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nIP&A and Piper assert two defenses in their motion for summary judgment: truth\nand opinion.  The court considers each in turn.\nA.  Principles of Review\nSummary judgment is appropriate if the record shows โthere is no genuine issue as\nto any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.โ\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  โAn issue of fact is genuine when โa reasonable jury could return\na verdict for the nonmoving partyโ on the question.โ  Woods v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.,\n409 F.3d 984, 990 (8th Cir. 2005) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.\n242, 248 (1986)).  A fact is material when it is a fact that โmight affect the outcome of the\nsuit under the governing law.โ Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  The court must view the\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and afford it all reasonable\n11\n\ninferences.  See McCoy v. City of Monticello, 411 F.3d 920, 922 (8th Cir. 2005);Woods,\n409 F.3d at 990.\n B.  Truth                \n  Truth is a complete defense to a defamation claim.  Delaney v. Intโl Union UAW\nLocal No. 94, 675 N.W.2d 832, 843 (Iowa 2004).  A defendant need not establish literal\ntruth โas long as the โstingโ or โgistโ of the defamatory charge is substantially true.โ\nWilson, 558 N.W.2d at 140; see Hovey v. Iowa State Daily Publication Bd., Inc., 372\nN.W.2d 253, 255-56 (Iowa 1985).\nThe gist or sting of the defamatory charge . . . is โthe heart of\nthe matter in questionโthe hurtfulness of the utterance.โ  [The\nIowa  Supreme  Court]  determine[s]  the  gist  or  sting  by\nโlook[ing] at the highlight of the [publication], the pertinent\nangle of it, and not to items of secondary importance which are\ninoffensive details, immaterial to the truth of the defamatory\nstatement.โ\nBehr v. Meredith Corp., 414 N.W.2d 339, 342 (Iowa 1987) (quoting Vachet v. Cent.\nNewspapers, Inc., 816 F.2d 313, 316 (7th Cir. 1987)).   In this context, then, summary\njudgment is proper only if the facts underlying the gist or sting of the defamatory charge\nare undisputed.  Id.  \nIP&A  and  Piper  contend  Piperโs  first  two  statements  to  the  Gazette  were\nsubstantially, if not literally true,6 because Estle refused to let the investigators interview\nC.S. and delayed them from accessing R.J.โs records.  Tanager Place, in turn, points out\nthat it let IP&A interview staff, take photos, and gave the investigators access to R.Jโs file\nas soon as it became available.  Tanager Place  maintains it gave IP&A reasonable access\n6 Piperโs statement that Tanager Place did โeverything within [its] powerโ to\nโroadblockโ IP&Aโs investigation cannot, of course, be literally true.  Tanager Place did\nnot, for example, order its staff to form a human chain around the building, stage a sit in,\netc.\n12\n\nto the facility, and Piperโs statements to the Gazette clearly assert the contrary. Tanager\nPlace also notes Piper admitted in a deposition that she believed some of Tanager Placeโs\nactions were โreasonableโ under the circumstances. \nThe court concludes summary judgment is improper.  As the courtโs discussion of\ndefamation per se showed (and the foregoing illustrates), the parties do not agree about\nhow to interpret Piperโs statements.  Whereas IP&A and Piper urge the court to take\nPiperโs statements more or less at face value, Tanager Place contends the statements were\nmeant  to  impugn  its  integrity  and  imply  it  had  something  to  hide  about  R.J.โs\ndisappearance.  Clearly, then, the partiesโ arguments are at cross-purposes because the\nparties do not, in the first place, agree about what must be shown to make Piperโs\nstatements true.  The Iowa Supreme Court has repeatedly held that in mounting a truth\ndefense the defendant carries โthe burden of proving the truth of the statements in the\nsense imputed to them by the plaintiff.โ  Brown v. First Nat. Bank of Mason City, 193\nN.W.2d 547, 553 (Iowa 1972) (emphasis added); see also Vojak v. Jensen, 161 N.W.2d\n100, 109 (Iowa 1968) (โ[T]he defense of truth must go to the libel in its entirety and as\nplaintiff claims it was used.โ), abrogated on other grounds by Barreca, 683 N.W.2d at\n117; Morse v. Times-Republican Printing Co., 124 Iowa 707, 720-21, 100 N.W. 867, 872\n(1904) (same); Kelly v. Iowa State Educ. Assโn, 372 N.W.2d 288, 297 (Iowa Ct. App.\n1985) (considering truth of statements in the sense plaintiff imputed).   IP&A and Piper\ndo not contend Piperโs statements to the Gazette are true in the sense Tanager Place\nimputes to them: that is,  that Tanager Place was unreasonably delaying and roadblocking\naccess  to  its  facility  and  records  because  it  had  something  to  hide  about  R.J.โs\ndisappearance.  The court therefore cannot say as a matter of law that these statements\nwere true.  Accordingly, the motion for summary judgment is denied with respect to these\ntwo statements. \nIP&A and Piper also argue Piperโs third statement to the Gazette (i.e. โWe believe\n13\n\nthese children were in immediate jeopardy for their safety.โ) is true.  The record contains\nsome evidence to support this claim, such as the fact that there were ninety-two reports of\nrunaways from Tanager Place in the twelve months preceding R.J.โs disappearance.\nHowever, Tanager Place vigorously disputes Piperโs claim: whether the children were in\ndanger is, after all, the fighting issue in this lawsuit.  It is also a contested matter of fact.\nBecause the court is convinced that there is a genuine issue of material fact warranting trial\non this issue, summary judgment is not proper.\nC.  Opinion\nAs an alternative defense, IP&A and Piper contend Piperโs statements were not\nstatements of fact, but rather mere opinion.  Whether a statement is an opinion or fact is\nan issue for the court to decide.  See Secrist v. Harkin, 874 F.2d 1244, 1248 (8th Cir.\n1989).  Under Iowa law, opinion is protected.  See Kiesau, 686 N.W.2d at 177; Jones, 440\nN.W.2d 884, 891 (Iowa 1989), abrogated on other grounds by Schlegel v. Ottumwa\nCourier, 585 N.W.2d 217, 224 (Iowa 1998).  The Iowa Supreme Court has identified three\nfactors a court should consider when determining whether a statement is fact or opinion:\n(1) the precision of the statement, (2)  the verifiability of the statement, and (3) the literary\ncontext in which the statement was made.  Kiesau, 686 N.W.2d at 177; accord  Janklow\nv. Newsweek, Inc., 788 F.2d 1300, 1302-03 (8th Cir. 1986) (articulating same factors).\nIn balancing these factors, the court must consider the statement as a whole, paying\nattention to its tone and use of cautionary language.  Jones, 440 N.W.2d at 892; accord\nJanklow, 788 F.2d at 1302. \nHaving considered the foregoing principles, the court concludes Piperโs statements\nto the Gazette were statements of fact, not opinion.  All three statements were precise,\nspecific, and verifiable.  Tanager Place either did or did not โroadblockโ the investigation;\nlikewise, the children at Tanager Place either were or were not โin immediate jeopardy for\ntheir safety.โ  Given their nature, Piperโs statements are likely statements of fact.  See\n14\n\nJones, 440 N.W.2d at 891-92.  The court recognizes that the statements were made to a\nnewspaper reporter and must be considered in the context of a newsworthy eventโthe\ndisappearance of a juvenile from a local institution.  See Kiesau, 686 N.W.2d at 177\n(noting โliterary contextโ โincludes the โsocial context,โ which focuses on the category of\nthe publication, its style and intended audience, and the โpolitical contextโ in which the\nstatement was madeโ); Jones, 440 N.W.2d at 891 (same).  Although the context arguably\nweighs in favor of a finding of opinion, the court concludes the first two factors (precision\nand verifiability) weigh more heavily in the opposite direction.  Under the totality of the\ncircumstances, the court finds all three of Piperโs statements are statements of fact, not\nopinion. \nIP&A and Piper point out that Piper prefaced her third remark to the Gazette with\na cautionary phrase: she stated โWe believe these children were in immediate jeopardy for\ntheir safety.โ (Emphasis added.).  IP&A and Piper claim this statement, at the very least,\nis  protected  opinion.    The  court  does  not  find  this  argument  persuasive  under  the\ncircumstances presented in this case.  As the United States Supreme Court observed,\nIf a speaker says, โIn my opinion John Jones is a liar,โ he\nimplies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion that\nJones told an untruth. . . . [T]he statement may . . . imply a\nfalse assertion of fact.  Simply couching such statements in\nterms of opinion does not dispel these implications; and the\nstatement, โIn my opinion Jones is a liar,โ can cause as much\ndamage to reputation as the statement, โJones is a liar.โ . . .\n[It] would be destructive of the law of libel if a writer could\nescape liability for accusations of [defamatory conduct] simply\nby using, explicitly or implicitly, the words โI think.โ\nMilkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 18-19 (1990) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง 566 (1977).  While the\nFirst Amendment protects so-called โpureโ opinions, statements which may imply a false\nassertion of fact are nonetheless actionable.  See Milkovich, 497 U.S. at 18-19; Harrington\n15\n\nv. Wilber, 353 F. Supp. 2d 1033, 1042 (S.D. Iowa 2005).  Piperโs statement that she\nbelieved the children at Tanager Place were in immediate danger clearly implied she knew\nsome undisclosed facts to support this conclusion.  Therefore her statement is actionable,\neven though she prefaced it with cautionary language.  The motion for summary judgment\nmust be denied.\nVI.  DISPOSITION\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that:\n1.   Counterclaim Plaintiffโs Motion for Pretrial Determination of Defamation\nPer Se (docket. no. 51) is DENIED; and\n2.

Both letters set forth IP & Aโs federal \nauthority. Only Plaintiffโs Exhibit 13 requests specific information. \n \n2  During the hearing, it was clear IP & A staff members did not hold a consistent opinion as to whether IP & A had to \n  contact the parent or guardian of a resident before viewing the residentโs file. \n \n3  The PAMII Act was amended and re-authorized by Congress in 1991 under the title, โProtection and Advocacy for \n  Mentally Ill Individuals Amendments Act of 1991.โ See Pub.L. No. 102โ173, ยง 1, 105 Stat. 1217, 1217 (1991). \n \n4  Tanager Place also filed a slander counterclaim against IP & A and joined Sylvia Piper in the suit as a third-party \n  defendant on that claim. The court severed the slander claim from the rest of the case and does not rule on the \nslander claim in this Order. \n \n5  During trial, Tanager Place objected to the admission of Plaintiffโs Exhibit 17 on relevance grounds. The court \n  indicated it would rule on the objection in its decision and indicate to the parties whether the court had relied upon \nPlaintiffโs Exhibit 17 in making its ruling. The court sustains the objection. Plaintiffโs Exhibit 17 was in no way \nconsidered in the courtโs ruling. \n \n6  The court agrees the June 1, 2004 letter does not set forth the basis upon which IP & A established probable cause \n  to investigate, but IP & A is not required to alert Tanager Place to the purpose of its investigation. IP & A sent the \nletter to Tanager Place to inform Tanager Place that IP & A investigators would be arriving at Tanager Place to \nconduct an investigation. \n \n7  The court relies on the court reporterโs notes because no official transcript is available. \n \n \n8  IP & A objected to Tanager Placeโs requirement a therapist be present for the interviews. The investigators normally \n  conduct conversational interviews, asking the children if they mind talking to the investigators, and if the children \nare willing, ask the individuals if there is a comfortable place they would like to go to talk. Next, they ask if they \nwould like to select someone with whom they feel comfortable to sit with them during the interview. Ms. Piper \nstated this style of interview is used so the individuals making the selections feel in charge of their environments, \nand it gives them a much better opportunity to converse. \n20 \n \n\nIowa Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)   \n2004 WL 2270002 \n \n \n9  At trial, Mr. Estle explained of the remaining eight residents of Dutton Cottage, one had been interviewed already by \n  IP & A on June 3, one was C.S., whom IP & A had withdrawn its request to interview, one child was away from \nTanager Place on a scheduled home visit, two DHS guardians did not want their wards interviewed, two parents did \nnot want their children interviewed, and the final residentโs medical condition prevented him or her from being \ninterviewed. None of this was explained to IP & A in the July 8, 2004 letter. See Pl.Ex. 9. \n \n10  The court finds unreasonable IP & Aโs request for the list of all residentsโ names and their parentsโ or guardiansโ \n  contact information. IP & Aโs authority to access residents during an investigation is limited to interviewing only \nthose residents โwho might be reasonably believed by the [IP & A] system to have knowledge of the incident under \ninvestigation.โ See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.42(b). While IP & Aโs authority to request records is not so limited, the court finds \nunreasonable a request for records of a resident who is not reasonably believed to have knowledge of the incident \nunder investigation. It is highly unlikely that residents in the shelter, summer camp, and ICFMR would have \nknowledge of the incident involving R.J. and also somewhat unlikely residents of the other PMIC cottages would \nhave knowledge of the incident. \n \n11  IP & A did not address the โreasonable expectation of privacyโ issue in its brief or at trial. \n \n \n12  The court is not referring to situations in which a resident grants access to his or her records but the residentโs \n  parent or guardian denies such access. In that situation, a P & A system would have authorization to access a \nresidentโs records under 42 U.S.C. ยง 10805(a)(4)(A) (granting access to records of a resident if the resident has \nauthorized the P & A system to have such access). \n \n \n \n \nEnd of Document   \n \n \n \n \n21 \n ",
