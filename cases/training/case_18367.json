    "summary": "<p>This is a case about a protection and advocacy (P&amp;A) agency&rsquo;s records access authority. On January 3, 2002, Iowa Protection and Advocacy Services (Iowa P&amp;A), filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa against Jessie K. Rasmussen in her official capacity as Director of Iowa&rsquo;s Department of Human Services (Department). Represented by itself, Iowa P&amp;A alleged that Rasmussen violated the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) when she refused to provide records requested by Iowa P&amp;A under its DD and PAIMI Act investigations authority following the death of an individual at a Department operated facility. Judge Robert W. Pratt presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit began following the death of a resident at a Department operated facility for individuals with disabilities. Iowa P&amp;A requested all records concerning the individual&rsquo;s death, including an Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals (DIA) report. DIA is the agency responsible for internal death investigations at Department operated facilities. Rasmussen refused to provide the records requested, asserting that no abuse or neglect occurred, and that state law prevented disclosure of the records that Iowa P&amp;A requested. On March 12, 2002, the court granted Iowa P&amp;A&rsquo;s Motion for Preliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief, holding that they could access all the records requested under the DD and PAIMI Acts. The court found that the protection and advocacy agency determines what constitutes probable cause of abuse and neglect for records access. The court also found that the DD and PAIMI Acts pre-empted state law prohibiting the release of the DIA report. Moreover, the court determined that the work product doctrine did not bar Iowa P&amp;A from accessing an internal investigation report prepared by Iowa&rsquo;s deputy attorney general. On March 12, 2002, the court also closed the case. On September 10, 2002, the court granted Iowa P&amp;A $727.00 in attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>",

For the reasons set\n2\n1\n/\n3\n  forth below, the motion is granted.\nD\nE\nL\nFI I. Facts\nIowa Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc. (“Iowa P&A”) is a private, non-profit Iowa\ncorporation which provides protection and advocacy services to persons with mental retardation\nand mental illness pursuant to the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act\nof 2000 (“PADD Act”), 42 U.S.C. § 15001, et seq., and the Protection and Advocacy for\nIndividuals with Mental Illness Act (“PAIMI Act”), 42 U.S.C. § 10801, et seq.\n\nThe Woodward Resource Center (“Woodward”) is a certified health care facility serving\npersons with mental retardation.  Larry Tieleban was a resident of Woodward in March 2001 and\ndied of suffocation on March 18, 2001 while being restrained by Woodward employees.  Mr.\nTielebein is a person with developmental and mental illness disabilities within the meaning of\nthe PADD Act and the PAIMI Act.  The medical examiner conducted an autopsy of Mr.\nTielebein, and later classified the death as homicide.\nOn March 20, 2001, a member from the media contacted Iowa P&A and reported the\ndeath at Woodward.  Iowa P&A responded by contacting Dr. Michael Davis, the Superintendent\nfor Woodword, for information regarding the reported death.  Dr. Davis stated that Mr. Tielebein\ndied while he was restrained.  Dr. Davis also indicated that he had obtained statements from\nemployees and would be interviewing staff regarding Mr. Tielebein’s death.  That same day,\nMarch 20, Iowa P&A contacted the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals (“DIA”) to\nreport the death and ask whether they were conducting an investigation.  \nOn March 22, 2001, staff from Iowa P&A went to Woodward to investigate Mr.\nTielebein’s death.  Upon arriving at Wooward, the Iowa P&A staff presented Dr. Davis with a\nletter outlining Iowa P&A’s federal authority to investigate Mr. Tielebein’s death, and which\nrequested the following information:\nany and all records of Larry Tielebein and all other individuals placed within your\nfacility including but not limited to treatment plans, nursing and other staff\nprogress notes, physician orders and progress notes; social history, history and\nphysical, medication lists and medication administrative record, and incident\nreports; restraint, seclusion records, individual habitation plans, behavior\nmanagement programs, Woodward Resource Center policies, procedures,\ndirectives and guidelines in effect at the time of death and subsequent to death,\ncommunication with Woodward Resource Center staff regarding Mr. Tielebein’s\ntreatment and death; access to all areas of the Woodward Resource Center; access\n-2-\n\nto communication with other consumers at the Woodward Resource Center; and\naccess to other records and information necessary to complete this investigation.\nDr. Davis told the Iowa P&A staff they could conduct interviews of residents and staff.\nDuring the investigation, Iowa P&A experienced difficulty in obtaining information. \nThis was due in part to the fact that most of the residents of 109 Franklin at Woodward have\nsevere and profound mental retardation and could not assist with the investigation.  In addition,\nthe other individuals who were interviewed did not witness the restraint and emergency\nmeasures.\nA. DIA Investigative Report\nOn March 19, 2001, DIA initiated an investigation regarding the circumstances of Mr.\nTielebein’s death for the purposes of determining whether Mr. Tielebein’s death involved either\nan act of dependent adult abuse or non-compliance with the certification requirements.  On\nMarch 21, 2001, Rhonda Bennett from the DIA contacted Iowa P&A and stated that someone\nfrom the DIA would be sent out to investigate Mr. Tielebein’s death.  \nDIA is the state agency responsible for the licensing, inspection, and regulatory oversight\nof Iowa health care facilities.  DIA is also “solely responsible for the evaluation and disposition\nof dependent adult abuse cases within health care facilities . . .”  Iowa Code § 235B.3 (2001).  In\naddition, DIA is the state agency responsible for determining whether health care facilities\ncertified for participation in federally funded programs have satisfied the required conditions of\nparticipation.  Detected noncompliance with the federal certification requirements are\ncommunicated in writing in a report detailing the findings referred to as the “Statement of\nDeficiencies.”\n-3-\n\nWhen conducting an investigation of dependent adult abuse or non-compliance with the\nfederal certification standards, DIA uses a preponderance of the evidence standard.  The results\nof a dependent adult abuse investigation are classified as “founded” (i.e. the preponderance of the\nevidence establishes that an alleged act of dependent abuse occurred) and “unfounded” (i.e. the\npreponderance of the evidence establishes that an alleged act of dependent adult abuse did not\noccur).  \nThe DIA investigation concluded on or about April 26, 2001.  DIA determined that the\npreponderance of the evidence established that the allegation of dependent adult abuse was\nunfounded and further determined that Woodward was non-compliant with certain federal\ncertification requirements.  The DIA’s unfounded findings regarding the allegation of dependent\nadult abuse were filed with the Department of Human Services in accordance with state law.\nOn July 6, 2001, Iowa P&A contacted Ms. Bennett and requested a copy of the DIA’s\ninvestigative report regarding Mr. Tielebein’s death.  DIA provided Iowa P&A with a complete\ncopy of the Statement of Deficiencies regarding DIA’s findings of noncompliance arising from\nthe treatment provided to Mr. Tielebein; however, it did not provide a copy of DIA’s findings\nregarding the allegation of dependent adult abuse investigated.  DIA, acting through their legal\ncounsel, Melissa Biederman of the Attorney General’s office, advised Iowa P&A that DIA could\nnot comply with this portion of Iowa P&A’s request due to the prohibition found in Iowa Code §\n235B.6(2).\nThe Statement of Deficiencies listed the following deficiencies: (1) Woodward staff did\nnot explain the risks involved with physical restraints properly to Mr. Tielebein’s guardian prior\nto obtaining the signed consent for restraints; and (2) Mr. Tielebein’s behavioral plan was not\n-4-\n\nfollowed prior to implementing restraints, nor was there proper monitoring of Mr. Tielebein\nwhile he was restrained.\nOn July 11, 2001, Iowa P&A sent a letter to Ms. Bennett and Ms. Biederman, requesting\nthe complete DIA report.  Ms. Biederman responded by letter on September 4, 2001, indicating\nIowa P&A was not authorized to receive the report under Iowa Code § 235B.6, which does not\nauthorize the release of “unfounded dependent adult abuse information” to Iowa P&A.  Iowa\nCode § 235B.6 (emphasis added).  On September 11, 2001, Iowa P&A again requested a copy of\nthe report, stating that Iowa Code § 235B.6 is preempted by the PADD Act 42 U.S.C. § 15001, et\nseq., and the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801, et seq.  On October 4, 2001, Marvin Tooman,\nAdministrator for the DIA sent a letter to Iowa P&A indicating the full DIA report would not be\nproduced as “[c]hapter 135C.17 contains an express limitation that requires DIA to cooperate\nwith reasonable requests for information only ‘as required by federal law and this chapter,’” and\nstating that Iowa P&A must gather materials through its “own investigation.”  Iowa P&A now\nseeks the report by court order through preliminary and permanent injunction.\nB. Woodward Internal Investigation Report\nOn July 6, 2001, Iowa P&A sent a letter to Dr. Davis requesting a copy of the internal\ninvestigation report of Mr. Tielebein’s death.  Dr. Davis responded by letter on July 23, 2001,\nstating he would not provide a copy of the internal investigation report.  On July 30, 2001, Iowa\nP&A sent Dr. Davis a second request for a copy of the report.\nOn August 15, 2001, Iowa P&A met with Gordon Allen, the Deputy Attorney General,\nand Jessie Rasmussen, the Executive Director of the Department of Human Services (“DHS”), to\ndiscuss in part the Woodward internal investigation report.  At that time, Mr. Allen indicated that\n-5-\n\nhe had advised Dr. Davis not to produce a copy of the report.  On September 13, 2001, Iowa\nP&A sent a letter to Mr. Allen requesting a copy of the report.  Iowa P&A did not receive a\nresponse, so it sent a second letter to Mr. Allen requesting the report on October 13, 2001.\nOn October 19, 2001, Iowa P&A sent a letter to Ms. Rasmussen requesting a copy of the\nreport.  Ms. Rasmussen responded by letter on November 19, 2001, stating that, at the direction\nof Mr. Allen, the “Randall Hines” report would not be produced because it was prepared in\nanticipation of litigation with the Department of Justice.  Ms. Rasmussen and Mr. Allen base\ntheir privilege claim on a letter that the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) served upon\nthe state in 1999 indicating that it would initiate an investigation, asserting that the report, known\nas the Hines Report, was prepared in response to that investigation.  Mr. Allen contends that he\nhired Randall Hines, an expert on restraints, to reach findings independent of the DOJ’s\ninvestigation regarding Woodward and another facility.  Mr. Allen admits that part of the report\naddresses Mr. Tielebien’s death, but Mr. Allen asserts that Mr. Tielebien’s death is not the\nmotivating factor behind the report nor its focus.\nMr. Allen acknowledged at the hearing on this matter that two years have passed since the\nDOJ investigation, although they have requested more documents recently.  Furthermore, the\nonly concrete evidence of a litigation threat that Mr. Allen has offered is the letter from the DOJ\nthat cites, 42 U.S.C. § 1997.   That statute says that upon investigation, DOJ may commence\nlitigation after serving notice on the Governor, state attorney general, and the director of the\ninstitution. \nC. The Minutes of the Woodward Mortality Review Meeting \nIowa P&A has also not received the minutes of the mortality review meeting conducted\n-6-\n\nby Woodward’s professional staff (the “Minutes”), although it has received the report generated\nby that meeting.  Mr. Allen also claims that the work-product privilege that covers the Hines\nreport covers the Minutes.  Mr. Allen has also refused to produce the Minutes on the grounds that\ntheir communications were ‘privileged’ and he quotes that they “must be able to speak freely,\nwithout fear of discipline or repercussions.”  Mr. Allen is apparently quoting the professional\nemployees’ own statements at the meeting.\nII. Preliminary and Permanent Injunction Standards\n“The burden of establishing the propriety of a preliminary injunction is on the movant.”\nBaker Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Chaske, 28 F.3d 1466, 1472 (8th Cir.1994).  District courts have broad\ndiscretion with respect to requests for preliminary injunctions, and are reviewed on a standard that\nallows reversal “only for clearly erroneous factual determinations, an error of law, or an abuse of\nthat discretion.” United Indust. Corp. v. Clorox Co., 140 F.3d 1175, 1179 (8th Cir.1998)(citation\nomitted.). \nThe relevant factors in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction are: “(1) the\nprobability of success on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable harm to the movant; (3) the\nbalance between this harm and the injury that granting the injunction will inflict on other\ninterested parties; and (4) whether the issuance of an injunction is in the public interest.” Sanborn\nMfg. Co., Inc. v. Campbell Hausfeld/Scott Fetzer Co., 997 F.2d 484, 485-86 (8th Cir.1993) (citing\nDataphase Sys., Inc. v. C.L. Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir.1981) (en banc)).  These four\nfactors are typically referred to as the “Dataphase factors.” See, e.g., Entergy, Ark., Inc., 210 F.3d\nat 893.  “The standard for granting a permanent injunction is essentially the same as for a\npreliminary injunction, except that to obtain a permanent injunction the movant must attain\n-7-\n\nsuccess on the merits,” rather than simply establish a likelihood of success.  Bank One v. Guttau,\n190 F.3d 844, 847 (8th Cir.1999) (citing Amoco Production Co. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S.\n531, 546 n. 12, (1987)).\nThe Dataphase factors are not a rigid formula; however, “[t]he basis of injunctive relief in\nthe federal courts has always been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal remedies.” Beacon\nTheatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506-07 (1959).  “Thus, to warrant a preliminary\ninjunction, the moving party must demonstrate a sufficient threat of irreparable harm.” Iowa\nProtection and Advocacy Serv., Inc. v. Gerard Treatment Programs, 152 F.Supp.2d 1150, 1156\n(N.D. Iowa 2001) (citing Adam-Mellang v. Apartment Search, Inc., 96 F.3d 297, 299 (8th\nCir.1996)); see also Baker Elec. Co-op., Inc., 28 F.3d at 1472 (\"No single factor in itself is\ndispositive; in each case all of the factors must be considered to determine whether on balance,\nthey weigh towards granting the injunction. However, a party moving for a preliminary injunction\nis required to show the threat of irreparable harm.”) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\nIII. Discussion\nUpon examining past treatment of the Dataphase factors by other district courts in cases\nrelated to investigations by either Iowa P&A or comparable organizations in other states, it\nbecomes clear that the decision must hinge on the first Dataphase factor: whether the case is\nmeritorious or is likely to succeed on the merits.  First, this decision will address why the case law\nfavors Iowa P&A on the other Dataphase factors.  Second, the Court will respectively address the\nmerits for each of the three documents that Iowa P&A is seeking. \n-8-\n\nA. Other Dataphase Factors\n1. Irreparable Harm\nThe questions of whether a failure to issue a preliminary injunction to produce the\ndocuments that Iowa P&A requests will cause irreparable harm is one that was addressed with\nrespect to another preliminary injunction sought by Iowa P&A in the Northern District of Iowa. \nIn Iowa Protection and Advocacy Services, the Court held that:\n [W]hether or not other investigations have already been conducted of alleged\nabuse and neglect . . . and whether or not any investigation already undertaken by\n[Iowa P&A] or likely to be undertaken by [Iowa P&A] has or will reveal that no\nabuse or neglect has occurred . . . [Iowa P&A] is still irreparably harmed by being\nprevented from pursuing fully its right to access records . . . in pursuit of its duty to\ninvestigate circumstances providing probable cause to believe abuse or neglect may\nbe occurring.\nIowa Protection and Advocacy, at 1173 (citing to a similar holding in Wisconsin Coalition for\nAdvocacy, Inc. v. Czaplewski, 131 F.Supp2d 1039, 1051 (E.D. Wis. 2001)).  Furthermore, the\nCourt in Iowa Protection and Advocacy also cites Advocacy Center v. Stalder, 128 F.Supp.2d 358\n(M.D. La 1999) where the court reached the same holding with respect to a permanent injunction. \nIowa P&A has argued that it replicating the findings from these undisclosed reports would be time\nconsuming and costly.  Indeed, in the case of the Minutes, replication is impossible.\n2. Balance of Harms\n The primary potential harm cited by both DHS and DIA in this case is confidentiality;\nhowever, “PAIMI imposes a duty of confidentiality on the advocacy organizations.”  Iowa\nProtection and Advocacy, at 1160 (citing Oklahoma Disability Law Ctr., Inc. v. Dillon Family &\nYouth Servs., Inc., 879 F.Supp. 1110, 1112 (N.D. Okla 1995)).  See also 42 U.S.C. § 10806(a). \nConsequently, several district courts have concluded that the issue of confidentiality should not\n-9-\n\nact as a bar to disclosure to a protection and advocacy system.  See Iowa Protection and\nAdvocacy, at 1174-75; Stalder at 366 (“[U]nder the [PAIMI] Act a protection and advocacy\nsystem must maintain the confidentiality of the records to the same extent as the provider of the\nservice.  There is no reason to suspect that the confidentiality of the records will be breached.”);\nPennsylania Protection and Advocacy, Inc. v. Houstoun, 228 F.3d 423, 428-29 (3rd Cir. 2000);\nWisconsin Coalition for Advocacy, Inc. at 1052.  Furthermore, the Court in Iowa Protection and\nAdvocacy astutely points out that “one would suppose that a facility’s legitimate interests are\nserved when abuse and neglect are uncovered and can be corrected.” Iowa Protection and\nAdvocacy, at 1175.\n3. Public Interest\n“[T]he public interest, as weighed by Congress, weighs in favor of injunctive relief\npermitting [Iowa P&A] to obtain access . . .”  Iowa Protection and Advocacy, at 1175.  This holds\nequally true in the case at bar.  The PADD Act and the PAIMI Act set forth a clear federal\nlegislative mandate for protection and advocacy systems to review independently care for\ndependent adults by state and privately run caregivers.  The PADD Act requires states receiving\ncertain allotments to “have in effect a system to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities,” where a system is defined as a “protection and advocacy system . . .\nto protect the legal and human rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.”  42 U.S.C. §\n15043(a)(1); 42 U.S.C. § 15041.  The congressional findings in the PAIMI Act states that “[s]tate\nsystems for monitoring compliance with respect to the rights of individuals with mental illness\nvary widely and are frequently inadequate.”  42 U.S.C. § 10801(a)(4).  Furthermore, Congress\nexplicitly stated in the PAIMI Act that its purpose is to “(1) ensure that the rights of individuals\n-10-\n\nwith mental illness are protected; and (2) to assist States to establish and operate a protection and\nadvocacy system for individuals with mental illness which will . . . (B) investigate incidents of\nabuse and neglect of individuals with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the system or if\nthere is probable cause to believe that the incidents occurred.”  42 U.S.C. § 10801(b).\nTo the extent that Iowa law conflicts with Congress’s establishment of public policy, or to\nthe extent issues of attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product conflict, those questions go\nto the merits of the case.  Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, this\nCourt must give deference to the federal government’s policy intentions with respect to enabling\nprotection and advocacy systems to investigate allegations of abuse of adults in dependent care.\nOne other policy consideration raised by Mr. Allen was the ability of employees “to speak\nfreely, without fear of discipline or repercussions” in mortality review meetings.  Mr. Allen has\nnot offered any authority for carving out such a privilege.  While this Court understands the value\nof a protected exchange of views and ideas, it does not have the authority to countermand the\nexpress policy preferences of Congress.  It is Congress’s clear intent for protection and advocacy\nsystems to participate in the review of treatment of dependent adults and ultimately to ensure their\nrights.  It would certainly undermine Congressionally mandated independent review if dependent\nadult care workers can cloak discussions about potential abuse at will by simply declaring such\ndiscussions “off the record,” even if the motives for doing so are genuinely constructive.  To\nshield from independent review valuable records of this type of appraisal would directly\ncontradict the expressly stated public policy of Congress. \n-11-\n\nB. The Merits\n1. The DIA Report\na. The Applicability of Federal Statutes and Regulations\nMr. Techau and Mr. Tooman contend that Iowa Code § 235B.6 prohibits them from\nreleasing the DIA report.  Iowa Code § 235B.6(3) states:\nAccess to unfounded dependent adult abuse information is authorized only to those\npersons identified in subsection 2, paragraph “a,” paragraph “b,” subparagraphs (2)\nand (6), and paragraph “e,” subparagraph (2).\nIndeed, Iowa P&A is not covered in any of the aforementioned sections.  Mr. Techau and Mr.\nTooman argue that this prohibition does not conflict with the PADD and PAIMI Acts.  Before\nexamining the language of the federal statutes, it is worth noting that subsection 2, paragraph “b,”\nmentioned above, which excludes Iowa P&A, enumerates who may be a “person involved in an\ninvestigation of dependent adult abuse . . .”  Thus, while the defendants in this case have not\ncalled into question Iowa P&A’s right to investigate, it is clear from that section that Iowa Code §\n235B.6 in a broad sense does not conform to federal law.\nMr. Techau and Mr. Tooman argue that because the DIA report concluded that abuse\nallegations are “unfounded,” it is not covered by the PADD and PAIMI Acts.  They point to 42\nC.F.R. 51.41(c)(2)(i):\n(c) Information and individual records, whether written or in another medium . . .\nshall be available to the P&A system under the Act shall include but not be limited\nto:\n. . . (2) Reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating\nabuse, neglect, or injury occurring at a facility rendering care or\ntreatment, or by or for the facility itself, that describe any or all of\nthe following:\n(i)    Abuse, neglect, or injury occurring at the facility;\n-12-\n\n42 C.F.R. 51.41(c)(2)(i)(emphasis added).  Mr. Techau and Mr. Tooman argue that since by a\npreponderance of the evidence, there was no finding of abuse, the federal regulation and statute\ndoes not mandate the release of the report.  To say this is a tortured reading of the statutory\nscheme is too generous.\nFirst, Mr. Techau and Mr. Tooman ignore the language italicized above which explicitly\nstates that the regulation in no way intends to limit what a protection and advocacy system is\nentitled to under the statute or other parts of the regulatory scheme.  Second, Mr. Techau and Mr.\nTooman read this regulation as limiting Iowa P&A’s access to reports of abuse, even though the\nsubparagraph lists “abuse, neglect, and injury.”  Hence, even if this Court were to accept the\nargument that the state can escape independent review by simply “finding” that abuse did not\noccur, in this case there is no question that there was an injury to Mr. Tielebien.  \nThird, Mr. Techau and Mr. Tooman overlook subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) in that\nsection, which entitle Iowa P&A to reports that relate to:\n(ii) The steps taken to investigate the incidents;\n(iii) Reports and records, including personnel records, prepared or maintained by\nthe facility, in connection with such reports of incidents; or\n(iv) Supporting information that was relied upon in creating a report, including\nall information and records used or reviewed in preparing reports of abuse,\nneglect or injury such as records which describe persons who were interviewed,\nphysical and documentary evidence that was reviewed, and the related\ninvestigative findings.\nIt is important to note that neither subparagraphs (ii) nor (iii) are in any way limited by the\nexistence of abuse, neglect or injury.  Nor is there any reason to conclude that the term “incident”\nis invested with a formal qualitative finding on what took place.  Neither the regulation nor the\n-13-\n\nstatute defines “incident” more narrowly than its common usage.\nFurthermore, the statute itself provides clear authority to Iowa P&A to have access to\nrecords of an investigation regardless of the agency’s internal findings of abuse or neglect.1  42\nU.S.C.  § 15043(a)(2)(I)(ii) & (iii) both state that a state’s protection and advocacy system shall\n“have access to all records of an individual with a developmental disability, in a situation which:”\n[A] complaint has been received by the system about the individual with regard\nto the status or treatment of the individual with regard to the status or treatment\nof the individual or, as a result of monitoring or other activities, there is probable\ncause to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect . . .2\n1 The PADD Act defines the term “records” broadly:\nIn this section, the term “record” includes-\n(1) a report prepared or received by any staff at any location at which services,\nsupports, or other assistance is provided to individuals with developmental\ndisabilites;\n(2) a report prepared by an agency or staff person charged with investigating\nreports of incidents of abuse or neglect, injury or death occurring at such location,\nthat describes such incidents and the steps taken to investigate such incidents; and \n(3) a discharge planning record.\n2 In full, 42 U.S.C.  § 15043(a)(2)(I) states that a protection and advocacy system shall:\n(I) have access to all records of-\n(i) any individual with a developmental disability who is a client of the system if such individual,\nor the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative of such individual, has authorized\nthe system to have such access;\n(ii) any individual with a developmental disability, in a situation in which-\n(I) the individual, by reason of such individual’s mental or physical condition, is\nunable to authorize the system to have access;\n(II) the individual does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal\n-14-\n\nThere is no qualification about the findings with respect to the “complaint” mentioned above, just\nthat one was filed.  Moreover, even if a complaint is not filed, if the protection and advocacy\nsystem determines that there is “probable cause” of “abuse or neglect,” it may access the\nindividual’s records.  It is worth noting that the PADD Act, as well as the PAIMI Act, are explicit\nabout a probable cause standard, and not the “preponderance of the evidence” standard by which\nMr. Tooman and Mr. Techau claim to assert that abuse has not taken place.  More importantly, the\nstatute is clear that it is the protection and advocacy systems that shall make the relevant probable\ncause determination, as a result of its “monitoring and other activities,” and not a state agency.\nFurthermore, the next subsection, 42 U.S.C.  § 15043(a)(2)(J) states that the protection\nand advocacy system shall “have access to the records of individuals described” in subparagraph\nrepresentative, or the legal guardian of the individual is the State; and\n(III) a complaint has been received by the system about the individual with regard\nto the status or treatment of the individual with regard to the status or treatment of\nthe individual or, as a result of monitoring or other activities, there is probable\ncause to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect; and\n(iii) any individual with a developmental disability, in a situation in which-\n(I) the individual has a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative;\n(II) a complaint has been received by the system about the individual with regard\nto the status or treatment of the individual with regard to the status or treatment of\nthe individual or, as a result of monitoring or other activities, there is probable\ncause to believe that such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect;\n(III) such representative has been contacted by such system, upon receipt of the\nname and address of such representative;\n(IV) such system has offered assistance to such representative to resolve the\nsituation; and\n(V) such representative has failed or refused to act on behalf of the individual . . .\n-15-\n\n(I) and “other records that are relevant to conducting an investigation.”  Thus, the statutory\nmandate for production of records is intentionally broad.\nIn 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(3) of the PADD Act, Congress broadens even further the scope\nof documents to which Iowa P&A is entitled with respect to other independent reviews of\ntreatment that are conducted:\n(3) to the extent that information is available, the State shall provide to the\nsystem-\n(A) a copy of each independent review, pursuant to section\n1396a(a)(30)(C) of this title, of an Intermediate Care Facility (Mental\nRetardation) within the State, not later than 30 days after the availability\nof such a review; and\n(B) information about the adequacy of health care and other services,\nsupports, and assistance that individuals with developmental disabilities\nwho are served through home and community-based waivers (authorized\nunder section 1396n(c) of this title) receive . . .”\nThus, even if this Court agreed that all the other parts of this statute with respect to an\ninvestigation were limited somehow by DIA’s findings, the subparagraph above would probably\ncover them.\nThe PAIMI Act is no less clear, it states that a protection and advocacy system shall:\n(4) in accordance with section 10806 of this title, have access to all records of-\n(A) any individual who is a client of the system if such individual, or the legal\nguardian, conservator, or other legal representative of such individual, has\nauthorized the system to have such access;\n(B) any individual (including an individual who has died or whose whereabouts\nunknown)-\n(i)   who by reason of the mental or physical condition of such individual\nis unable to authorize the system to have such access.\n-16-\n\n(ii) who does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or other legal\nrepresentative, or for whom the legal guardian is the State; and\n(iii) with respect to whom a complaint has been received by the\nsystem or with respect to whom as a result of monitoring or other\nactivities (either of which result from a complaint or other\nevidence) there is probable cause to believe that such individual\nhas been subject to abuse or neglect . . .\n42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(4) (emphasis added).  Once again, Congress applies the complaint or\nprobable cause standard to whether the protection and advocacy system may access records.\nb. Federal Preemption\nBy virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, federal law —\nwhich “encompasses both federal statutes themselves and federal regulations that are properly\nadopted in accordance with statutory authorization,” City of New York v. Federal\nCommunications Comm’n, 486 U.S. 57, 63 (1988) — can preempt state law.  In some cases,\nfederal law may expressly preempt state or local law, see Kinley Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 999\nF.2d 354 (8th Cir. 1993), or federal law may so “occupy the field” of a given area that state law is\ndeemed preempted, see Heart of Am. Grain Inspection Serv., Inc. v. Missouri Dep’t of Agric., 123\nF.3d 1098 (8th Cir. 1997).  Even if, as in this case, Congress has not occupied the field, “state law\nis naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute, . . . [or] where under the\ncircumstances of a particular case, the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the\naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.”  Crosby v.\nNational Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 372-73 (2000) (citations and brackets omitted).\nIn the case of the PAIMI Act, the state law is expressly preempted.  It states:\nIf the laws of a State prohibit an eligible system from obtaining access to the\nrecords of individuals with mental illness in accordance with section 10805(a)(4)\n-17-\n\nof this title and this section shall not apply to such system before–\n(i) the date such system is no longer subject to the prohibition; or\n(ii) the expiration of the 2-year period beginning on May 23, 1986, whichever\noccurs first.\n42 U.S.C. § 10806(b)(2)(C).  Thus, after May 23, 1988, the section will apply regardless of the\nlaws of the State.  At least two other district courts have upheld this express preemption.  Stalder,\nat 367; Okla. Disability Law Ctr., Inc., at 1112.\nIn the case of both the PAIMI Act and the PADD Act, it is clear that Congress has,\nindeed, “occupied the field,” with respect to the investigatory powers and rules of disclosure\nregarding protection and advocacy systems for dependent adults.  The statutory and regulatory\nscheme would not make sense any other way.  Protection and advocacy systems are established as\nindependent checks on state care and regulation of care for dependent adults.  That independent\ncheck would become meaningless if a state was allowed to simply legislate away a protection and\nadvocacy system’s power to investigate by enacting restrictions.\n2. The Woodward Internal Investigation Report\nMs. Rasmussen and Ms. Davis declined to produce the Hines Report at the insistence of\nMr. Allen, who claims the report was prepared for him and is therefore covered by the attorney\nwork product doctrine.  Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure codifies the general\njudicial rule protecting attorney work product set forth in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510-\n11 (1947); however, Rule 26 limits discovery in the civil litigation process, and therefore does not\napply in this case.  Hence, the authority for application of the work product doctrine in this case\nflows exclusively from the judicial doctrine of Hickman and not any statutory mandate.  In\n-18-\n\ndetermining whether the Hines Report is protected by attorney work product doctrine, this Court\nfirst must decide whether it is covered, and then whether the federal statutory mandate of the\nPADD Act and the PAIMI Act overrides the qualified privilege that the work product doctrine\ncreates.\na.  The Applicability of the Work Product Doctrine\n“The work product doctrine was designed to prevent ‘unwarranted inquiries into the files\nand mental impressions of an attorney,’ and recognizes that it is ‘essential that a lawyer work with\na certain degree of privacy, free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their\ncounsel.’” Simon v. G.D. Searle & Co., 816 F.2d 397, 400 (8th Cir. 1987) (quoting Hickman at\n510-11).  “The rule establishes a qualified immunity for ordinary work product that which does\nnot contain the mental impressions, conclusions or opinions of the attorney.” Id.  Under the\ngeneral rule, “[s]uch work product is discoverable only upon a showing of substantial need and an\ninability to secure the substantial equivalent of the items through alternate means without undue\nhardship.”  In re Murphy, 560 F.2d 326, 334 (8th Cir.1977).   Nevertheless “the parties asserting\nprivilege as a bar to discovery, must carry the initial burden of proving a factual basis establishing\nthe applicability of the privilege.”  St. Paul Reins. Co., Ltd. et al. v.  Commercial Fin. Corp., 197\nF.R.D. 620, 631 (N.D. Iowa 2000). \nIn the Eighth Circuit, the test for whether documents are protected by the attorney work\nproduct doctrine is simply whether they were prepared “in anticipation of litigation.”  Simon at\n400.  Furthermore, the Eighth Circuit explicitly adopts the test set forth in Wright & Miller for\ndetermining whether a document was prepared in anticipation of litigation:\n“[T]he test should be whether, in light of the nature of the document and the\n-19-\n\nfactual situation in the particular case, the document can fairly be said to have been\nprepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation. But the converse of this\nis that even though litigation is already in prospect, there is no work product\nimmunity for documents prepared in the regular course of business rather than for\npurposes of litigation.”\nId. (quoting 8 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2024, at 198-99 (1970)\n(footnotes omitted)).\nThe question of whether the Hines Report was legitimately prepared in anticipation of\nlitigation under this standard is a close one.  Mr Allen contends that he, as a lawyer for DHS,\ncommissioned the Hines Report upon receiving a letter from DOJ informing him that they would\ninvestigate Woodward and the Glenwood Resource Center, another facility.  Indeed, there is very\nlittle case law that speaks to the issue of whether a document prepared in response to a\ngovernment investigation is a document prepared in anticipation of litigation.\nIowa P&A cites Guizzino v. Felterman, 174 F.R.D. 59, 63 (W.D. La 1997) as persuasive\nauthority that a document prepared “in anticipation of a federal agency’s investigation” is not\ncovered by the work product doctrine.  What Iowa P&A does not reveal is that Guizzino also\nstates that “[f]ederal courts have concluded that once an investigation by a federal agency has\ncommenced . . . a [party] may reasonably said to anticipate litigation.”  Id. (citing Koenig v.\nInternational Systems & Controls Corp., 693 F.2d 1235 (5th Cir. 1982)).  \nNevertheless, the rule stated in Guizzino is not necessarily as broad as the court makes it\nappear.  The court in Koenig refers to a specific circumstance where the Securities and Exchange\nCommission initiated an investigation regarding “sensitive payments” or in layman’s terms,\noverseas payoffs, a circumstance where apparently shareholder litigation reliably ensues.  Koenig,\nat 1239, n.4.  See also In re Grand Jury Investigation, 599 F.2d 1224, 1229 (3rd Cir. 1979)\n-20-\n\n(holding that documents were covered by work product because “investigation concerned\nsuspected criminal violations,” evidence supporting illicit activity was already uncovered, and\n“potential for litigation was immeasurably intensified by [the company’s] legal obligations to\nreport any wrongdoing to its stockholders and to various governmental agencies.”)\nFurthermore, in cases where the investigating agency itself is the party asserting work-\nproduct doctrine, courts have held that a government investigation alone does not imply\nanticipation of litigation.  In Peterson v. United States, 52 F.R.D. 317, 321 (S.D. Ill. 1971), the\ncourt rejected the assertion of the government that Internal Revenue Service investigatory and\nsettlement memoranda were trial preparation materials, stating that “[p]resumably [the\ndocuments] are prepared in the assessment and review process and, if they be held to be in\nanticipation of litigation, it is hard to see what would not be.  Litigation cannot be anticipated in\nevery such case when relatively few result in litigation.”  See also Abel v. Investment Co. v.\nUnited States, 53 F.R.D. 485 (D. Neb. 1971); SEC v. Nat’l Student Mktg. Corp., 1974 WL 415, *9\n(D.D.C. ) (extending holdings of Peterson and Abel to discoverability of internal Securities and\nExchange Commission investigatory documents).  But see Crocker in United States, 51 F.R.D.\n155 (N. D. Miss. 1970); Weir Foundation v. United States, 1972 WL 411, *2 (S.D.N.Y.).\nIn Culinary Foods, Inc. v. Raychem Corp., 150 F.R.D. 122, 130 (N.D.Ill. 1993), the court\nused a similar analysis in declining to shield documents belonging to the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (“OSHA”) that arose out of an investigation.\nBecause one of the general purposes of OSHA is to investigate work related deaths\nand injuries, no clear cut rule can be established for determining whether these\ninvestigations fall under the work product doctrine.  That an investigation was\nconducted does not alone cloak the documents prepared by an attorney as work\nproduct.\n-21-\n\nId. (citing McLaughlin v. Miles Laboratories, Inc., 124 F.R.D. 629, 630 (N.D.Ind. 1988).  Thus, it\nappears that regardless of whether the party asserting work product doctrine was investigated or\nan investigating agency, determining whether a party can claim that an investigation reasonably\nimplied pending litigation depends upon the nature of the agency investigation and how regularly\nsuch investigations result in litigation.\nIn this case, the Court does not find sufficient evidence that the DOJ investigation\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997 created a reasonable expectation of litigation.  Aside from Mr.\nAllen’s assertions in his briefs and at arguments and his stated belief that the investigation was\n“widely reported,” the only other information on the DOJ investigation is a letter from the DOJ\nproduced by Mr. Allen after the hearing at the Court’s request.  According to Mr. Allen, “[t]he\nresult of that investigation, if they find egregious, flagrant and a pattern of practice of\nconstitutional violations . . . the ultimate result of that is litigation commenced by the U.S.\nAttorney General against the state of Iowa.”  While such a finding could naturally result in\nlitigation, the letter itself is clear that such a finding is not a foregone conclusion, nor is litigation\nthe only corrective action that might result.  “The inititation of this investigation does not indicate\na prejudgment on our part that residents’ federal rights, in fact, have been violated.  However, if\nany violations are found, we look forward to conferring with you and your staff concerning\nappropriate corrective action.”  When asked if, in addition to the letter of investigation, there was\nany other evidence that such litigation would inevitably ensue, Mr. Allen responded “[o]ther than\nmy discussions with them, the exit interviews that I have had at the facilities, my anticipation and\nmy reading of cases in other jurisdictions . . . in answer to your question, the short answer is no.”  \n “It is not the court’s burden to establish the applicability of the privilege to the documents\nby engaging in a factual and legal analysis on the discovery opponent’s behalf.”  Culinary Foods,\nInc. at 130 (citing Holzman v. Jaymar- Ruby, Inc., 916 F.2d 1298, 1303 (7th Cir. 1990)).  In order\nto block the production of the Hines Report, Ms. Rasmussen and Mr. Davis had the burden to\n-22-\n\nestablish that a DOJ investigation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997 strongly implies future litigation. \nAll that was offered was verbal assertions by counsel.  If the Court found that sufficient, it would\nrender the burden to establish the privilege meaningless.\nHence, the Court finds that Ms. Rasmussen and Mr. Davis did not meet their burden to\nshow that the “Hines” Report is protected by the attorney work product doctrine.\nb. Overcoming the Qualified Work Product Privilege\nEven if Ms. Rasmussen and Mr. Davis had sufficiently showed that the Hines Report was\nprepared in anticipation of litigation, established that it was covered by the work product doctrine,\nand protected by a qualified privilege, Iowa P&A could overcome the qualified privilege with a\ngood faith showing of good cause.\nIn the context of civil litigation, when a document is covered by the qualified privilege\ncreated by work product doctrine, the party seeking the document can overcome that privilege by\nshowing a substantial need for the document and an inability to reasonably obtain the information\nwithin those documents through other means.  Murphy at 334.  On the other hand, in a case such\nas this, where the production of the documents in question is mandated by statute, the standard for\novercoming the qualified work product privilege is far less stringent.\nAt least one other federal district court has addressed the qualified work product privilege\nwith respect to a request backed by a federal statute outside the context of civil litigation.  In\nUnited States v. Brown, 349 F.Supp 420 (N.D.Ill. 1972), the Internal Revenue Service sought\ndocuments prepared by an individual’s accountant pursuant to investigative authority established\nby federal statute.  The court addressed the extent to which this authority eroded the qualified\nwork product privilege protecting the documents, stating that “the work product doctrine as\npromulgated in Hickman [should] be tailored to reflect the important policies with which\nCongress was concerned in passing [the legislation].”  Id at 430.  \nThe court in Brown cited several factors for why it is necessary to modify the work\n-23-\n\nproduct doctrine.  “First, there is the general policy that access to information is productive of\njustice in administrative proceedings and investigations as it is in both civil and criminal\nlitigation.” Id. Second, the importance of the particular investigation “to the integrity and equity of\nthe system. . .”  In Brown, the investigation was by the IRS and the system was that of taxation, in\nthis case, the investigation is by Iowa P&A and the system is that of care for dependent adults. \nThird, the court stated that the “intent of Congress in [the] particular legislation [was]\nunequivocal.”\nUnlike the case in Hickman, there is here a clear statute which reflects the strong\ncongressional desire to further . . . inquiries.  While the statute cannot be fairly said\nto overrule the qualified privilege based on the work product doctrine by its\nsilence, courts should scrutinize and give the most careful consideration to any\napplication of the work product doctrine which would have the effect of impairing\nthe effectiveness of such clearly mandated administrative investigations.\nId. at 430-1.  Consequently, the court endeavored to create a lower standard for obtaining\ndocuments covered by the qualified work product privilege than the substantial need standard\nused in civil litigation.  \nThe court held that a party by statutory mandate seeking documents covered by the work\nproduct doctrine must simply “show ‘good cause’ by making a good faith declaration that the\ndocuments are believed necessary . . . and that it is believed that the information contained therein\ncannot be obtained from any other source.”   Id. at 431.  Upon this showing, the other party\n“should then have the opportunity to show the court that the contents of the particular documents\nat issue are not related . . . or necessary . . .”  Id.  The court in Brown concluded that “the effect of\nthis modification of the work product doctrine . . . will be to protect legitimate work product\nmaterials consistent with the purpose of the doctrine in the Hickman context of civil litigation,\nwhile avoiding unnecessary conflict with . . . statutory language . . .”  Id.  \nThe standard enunciated in Brown is apt in this case.  The interest in disclosure in this case\nis not the private interest of a litigant but a public interest codified in federal statute.  The integrity\nof the system of care for dependent adults demands that relevant information come to light and\n-24-\n\nthat courts not afford wide ranging protection of potentially incriminating information.  Finally,\nCongress enumerated a wide ranging statutory and regulatory scheme for the disclosure of\ninformation in the field of dependent adult care.  Congress certainly did not intend for a\ngovernment investigation to create an umbrella of qualified work product privilege that prevents\nprotection and advocacy systems from fulfilling their statutory duty of independent review.\nIn light of this analysis, this Court holds that Iowa P&A is entitled to the Hines Report on\nWoodward regardless of whether it is, in fact, covered by the work product doctrine.\n3. The Minutes\nMr. Allen’s argument for protecting the Minutes did not rest on any established legal\ndoctrine, but the policy arguments discussed above.  Since, as discussed above, those policy\narguments fail, the Court finds that Ms. Rasmussen and Ms. Davis must produce them.\nIV. Order\nIn light of the findings above, the Court hereby permanently enjoins the Iowa Department\nof Investigations and Appeals and the Department of Human Services from withholding the\nsection of the Randall Hines Report pertaining to the Woodward facility, the Department of\nInspections and Appeals findings on the allegations of abuse of Larry Tielebein, and the minutes\nof the mortality review committee meeting on the death of Larry Tielebein. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDated this ___12th___ day of March, 2002.\n-25-",
