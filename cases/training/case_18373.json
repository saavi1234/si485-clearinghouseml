Equip for Equality, Illinois&rsquo;s P&amp;A, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on February 3, 2003. Previously, in August 2002, Equip for Equality staff tried entering the shelter but were denied access. The complaint named Christian Women Services, a homeless shelter operator, and alleged violations of the Protection and Advocacy for Individual&rsquo;s With Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act) 42 U.S.C. &sect; 10801 et. seq., and the Illinois PAIMI Act, 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. 45/1 et seq. Equip for Equality represented itself and sought injunctive and declaratory relief that mandated Christian Women Services provide them with unsupervised access to the shelter. Judge Matthew F. Kennelly presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2003 the parties settled the case. They agreed that the Equip for Equality could access the shelter, residents, and staff at all hours, communicate with shelter residents and staff, and review medical and psychiatric records for shelter residents. Following the settlement agreement, the court dismissed the case.</p>",

In April 2003, the parties reached a settlement that permitted the plaintiffs access the defendant’s facility. The case closed in August 2003.",
