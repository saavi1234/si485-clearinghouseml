On February 3, 2003, Equip for Equality, Inc., Illinois&rsquo;s P&amp;A, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Equip for Equality filed this lawsuit against Ingalls Memorial Hospital (Ingalls), a private hospital offering outpatient and inpatient psychiatric services. This case arose because Equip for Equality were denied entry to monitor Ingalls with reasonable unaccompanied access and educate patients and staff on multiple occasions in 2002. Ingalls asserted that Equip for Equality could only access the facility if they obtained a court order, were conducting an investigation, or received a complaint from a patient. Represented by itself, Equip for Equality alleged that Ingalls violated the federal and Illinois Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) Acts by not letting them access the facility. Equip for Equality also sought reasonable, unaccompanied access to Ingalls twenty-four hours per day. Magistrate Judge Morton Denlow presided over the dispute.</p>\r\n<p>On November 25, 2003, the court granted Equip for Equality&rsquo;s Motion for Summary Judgement as a matter of law to monitor Ingalls unannounced and unaccompanied during, at a minimum, all normal business hours. However, the court did not determine as a matter of law that Equip for Equality could access Ingalls for monitoring twenty-four hours a day. The court ordered the parties to develop protocol for future facilities access. On August 5, 2004, the court adopted protocols that permitted Equip for Equality to have spontaneous conversations with patients on Ingalls&rsquo;s inpatient psychiatric units while monitoring, and that defined reasonable unaccompanied access to the facility as access from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. 92 F.Supp.2d 1086. Equip for Equality v. Ingalls, 329 F. Supp.2d 982 (N.D. Illinois 2004).</p>",

The plaintiff alleged that a private hospital violated their legal rights under the federal and Illinois Protection and Advocacy for Individuals wit Mental Illness (PAIMI) Acts by denying plaintiffโs access to monitor its psychiatric units. The court granted a summary judgment as a matter of law that plaintiffs could access the units and their patients at a minimum, during normal business hours. As part of the judgment, the defendant and plaintiff developed protocol for how plaintiffs could access inpatient units where patients received 24-hour care. In 2004, the court adopted protocols outlining the scope of access for facilities and individual patients. The case closed in August 2004.",
