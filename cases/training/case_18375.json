On March 27, 2006, Equip for Equality (EFE), the P&amp;A for Illinois, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Northern Illinois against Robbins Supportive Living LLC. Robbins Supportive Living LLC operated Robbins Senior Living (&ldquo;Robbins&rdquo;), a supportive living facility in Illinois for individuals 65 or older. Plaintiff alleged that defendant violated the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights Act (PAIR Act) when it denied EFE access to the facility and its residents and employees. Judge Mark R. Filip presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit began when EFE, in response to information regarding the conditions at Robbins, visited and sought access to the facility. EFE staff spoke with the Robbins supervisor over the phone, who denied access and demanded additional proof of authority. After faxing a letter with the requested information, EFE staff again visited Robbins, seeking access to the facility. The Robbins supervisor again denied access. Additional efforts to acquire access were unsuccessful.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctions to gain unaccompanied access to Robbins and other supportive living facilities operated by defendant, and attorneys' fees. On June 13, 2006, defendant filed a motion to dismiss. On August 21, 2006, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action. The case is now closed.</p>",

Introduction \n \nPlaintiff, Equip for Equality, Inc. (โEFEโ), is a private not-for-profit organization with \nfederal statutory mandates to protect and advocate on behalf of individuals with mental illness, \nindividuals with developmental disabilities, and individuals with other disabilities as defined by \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. Pursuant to its statutory authority, under the Protection and \nAdvocacy for Individual Rights Act (hereinafter โPAIRโ) 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e, et seq., EFE sought \naccess to Defendantโs supportive living facility, Robbins Supportive Senior Living, in Robbins, \nIllinois, to investigate conditions of residents for possible abuse or neglect. Defendant, by its \nagents and employees, refused and continues to refuse to allow EFE access.  EFE brings this \naction  to  obtain  a  declaration  of  its  right  to  access  Defendantโs  facilities,  residents  and \nemployees, and an injunction preventing Defendant from denying EFE access to its facilities, \nresidents and employees in accordance with Plaintiffโs statutory right. \n \n\nCase: 1:06-cv-01671 Document #: 17 Filed: 05/30/06 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:35\nII.   The Parties\n1.  EFE is a not-for-profit Illinois corporation, which was founded in 1985 under the \nname Protection and Advocacy, Inc., as an organization dedicated to protecting and upholding \nthe rights of individuals with disabilities in the State of Illinois. EFEโs principal office is located \nin Chicago, Illinois in Cook County. \n2.  Defendant Robbins Supportive Living LLC is a for-profit corporation, organized \nunder Illinois Law, with its principal place of business located in Northbrook, Illinois. \n3.  Defendant  Robbins  Supportive  Living  LLC  operates  Robbins  Senior  Living \n(โRobbinsโ), which is a โsupportive living facility,โ as that term is defined in applicable Illinois \nlaw, and is located in Robbins, Illinois. \n4.  In  its  Robbins  facility,  Defendant  provides  housing  and  services  to  eligible \nindividuals who are the age of 65 or older.  The Robbins facility is wheelchair accessible to serve \nnon-ambulatory residents. \n5.  Services  provided  by  Robbins  include  temporary  nursing  services,  health \nassessments and other well-being services, including, but not limited to bathing, dressing, and \nother self-care services. \n6.  Robbins has had people with physical disabilities living in the facility in the past \nand currently has people with physical disabilities living in the facility. \n7.  Residents at Robbins include one or more individuals who use wheelchairs and \nare substantially limited in the major life activity of walking and, on information and belief, \nindividuals with arthritis, diabetes, hip and/or knee replacements, heart disease, and dementia. \nThese individuals qualify for services as people with physical disabilities who are covered by \nPAIR. \n  2\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-01671 Document #: 17 Filed: 05/30/06 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:36\n \nIII.   Jurisdiction and Venue\n6.  This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331. \n7.  Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b), as the parties are Illinois \nentities and all of the events and omissions complained of occurred within this district. \nIV.    Denial of Access \n8.   EFEโs federal and state mandates include the responsibility to ensure that the \nrights of individuals with physical disabilities are protected.   EFE serves the important function \nof providing independent oversight of programs and facilities that offer treatment or care to \nindividuals with physical disabilities in Illinois. \n9.  In August 2006, EFE received a call from a relative of a resident of Robbins, who \nreported to EFE that Robbins was not providing necessary services to the resident for issues \nregarding her disability.  The resident was reported to have diabetes and cognitive functioning \nimpairments that affected her thinking and self-care. The caller reported that there were other \nresidents with similar and other impairments who were also being neglected. \n10.  Based on the information described in paragraph 9 above, EFE staff determined \nthat residents of Robbins who have physical disabilities may have been and may continue to be \nsubject to neglect at the facility.  EFE staff sought access to Robbins to monitor its compliance \nwith respect to the rights and safety of residents.  \n11.  On August 31, 2006, representatives of EFE visited Robbins and sought access to \nthe facility, its residents and employees.  \n12.  At the time they sought access, EFE representatives provided identification and \ncredentials to the Robbins facility administrator, Tammy Wilson.   \n  3\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-01671 Document #: 17 Filed: 05/30/06 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:37\n13.  Ms. Wilson talked generally with EFE representatives about Robbins, and then \nreferred them to her supervisor, Terry Bathum, for permission to enter the facility. \n14.  During their visit at Robbins, EFE representatives observed numerous individuals \nwith physical disabilities, including, but not limited to, individuals with mobility impairments \nwho used wheelchairs for ambulation. \n15.  While still at the offices of Robbins on August 31, EFE staff spoke by telephone \nwith Mr. Bathum, explained the purpose of their visit and informed him of the authority pursuant \nto which the visit was to be conducted. \n16.  Mr. Bathum denied access to the EFE staff on August 31.  He also demanded \nwritten proof of their authority and scheduled a meeting with them for the following day, \nSeptember 1, 2005. \n17.  Later in the day on August 31, 2005, Deborah Kennedy, Director of Equip for \nEqualityโs Abuse Investigations Unit, faxed a letter to Mr. Bathum, which provided him with the \nrequested information. \n18.  On September 1, 2005, representatives of EFE again traveled to Robbins and \nsought  access  to  the  facility,  whereupon  they  were  greeted  by  Mr.  Bathum.  During  this \nsubsequent visit at Robbins, EFE representatives again observed numerous individuals with \nphysical disabilities, including, but not limited to, individuals with mobility impairments who \nused wheelchairs for ambulation. \n19.  Rather than permitting them access to the facility on September 1, 2005, Mr. \nBathum cancelled the scheduled meeting with EFE representatives and informed them they \nwould not be allowed access to the facility. \n  4\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-01671 Document #: 17 Filed: 05/30/06 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:38\n20.  Following September 1, 2005, Equip for Equality made additional efforts were to \nsecure access through contacts with Robbinsโ legal counsel, which efforts were unsuccessful. \n21.  Subsequent telephone calls by EFE legal counsel to Robbins' legal counsel to \ndiscuss the subject of access were not returned. \n22.  EFE  continues  to  desire  access  to  Robbins  for  the  purpose  of  fulfilling  its \nstatutory such access. \n23.  The  Protection  and  Advocacy  for  Individual  Rights  Act,  29  U.S.C.  ยง  794e,  \nincorporates all access rights of 42 U.S.C.ยง 15041 et seq.

VIOLATION OF PAIR ACT \n25.  Defendantโs denial of access to Equip for Equality to its Robbins facility in order \nto access individuals resident therein who are protected by the PAIR Act and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act is a violation of PAIR, 29 U.S.C., 794e et seq., and its continued denial of access \nrepresents a continuing violation of that Act. \n  5\n\nCase: 1:06-cv-01671 Document #: 17 Filed: 05/30/06 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:39\n \nVI.
