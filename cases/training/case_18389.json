Plaintiffs sought certification of a class consisting of all children who are now, or will be, in the custody of DCS. Plaintiffs allege that DCS failed to &ldquo;provide safe and appropriate foster care placements; failed to provide appropriate services to the children and their families to allow safe reunification; and, for those for whom safe family reunification is not possible, failed to timely pursue termination of parental rights legal proceedings and failed to seek and secure safe, permanent homes. In doing so, Defendants have violated Plaintiffs&rsquo; federal constitutional and statutory rights.&rdquo; Plaintiffs also proposed a subclass of children with disabilities currently residing in institutional settings alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (&ldquo;ADA&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>On 10/29/2021, Defendants requested an interlocutory appeal to the Seventh Circuit on Younger abstention grounds, and the request was granted. The Seventh Circuit concluded that the live issues remaining in the case could be resolved by judges in CHINS proceedings, requiring the federal court to abstain. The court held further that questions remaining that could not be resolved by the CHINS court, such as how the Department handles investigations before filing a CHINS petition, do not affect the status of the two remaining plaintiffs who are already past this stage in the process. &nbsp;Accordingly, the case was then dismissed in the district court.</p>",

On December 12, 2017, the Director of Indiana’s Department of Child Services \n(“DCS”), Mary Beth Bonaventura, submitted her letter of resignation to Defendant Governor Eric \nHolcomb, warning that Indiana officials were systematically placing Hoosier children at risk “in \nways that all but ensure children will die.” Today, Indiana’s child welfare system continues to fail \nto protect children, and, in many instances, inflicts further trauma upon an already vulnerable \npopulation.  \n  1 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 2 of 85 PageID #: 142\n   \n   \n2.  Indiana has long assumed responsibility for children who have been abused or \nneglected by their parents or caregivers. Yet the system Indiana has created to protect these \nchildren, administered through its Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”), instead often \ncauses them further trauma.   \n3.  Indiana removes children from their homes and places them into foster care at a \nstaggering rate—more than double the national rate. While children are in DCS custody, Indiana \nfails to keep them safe, often placing them in inappropriate, unstable, or overly restrictive \nplacements; fails to provide necessary support services and medical and mental health care; and \nfails to provide meaningful case management. Many of these children unnecessarily languish in \nfoster care for years before they are reunified with their primary caretakers, are adopted, or age \nout of the system. The delays caused by DCS inflict further emotional trauma.  \n4.  The shortcomings of the Indiana foster care system are well known by state \nofficials, who have received numerous reports documenting its disarray over the past five years.   \nThe most recent of these reports is an extensive expert analysis by the well-respected Child \nWelfare Consulting Group (“CWG”). The state’s systemic and continued failure to correct these \nissues leaves children in serious and unconstitutional danger.   \n5.  Although the state has made some changes to the foster care system since the \nissuance of the CWG report, the changes are minimal, and the basic problems continue. The agency \nappears to be focused more on statistics than outcomes, by allegedly not investigating cases or \nclosing cases that are not yet ripe for closing and without providing necessary services to children. \nMoreover, the state has not taken necessary steps to address the shortage of appropriate placements \nfor children, particularly those who remain in inappropriate and sometimes abusive institutional \nsettings for long periods of time.  \n  2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 3 of 85 PageID #: 143\n   \n   \n6.  The named Plaintiffs1—Sara, Logan, Ashley and Betty of Marion County, Jaidyn \nand James of Allen County, Thomas and Milo of Spencer County, Desmond of Wells County, and \nBraxton of Wayne County—are children in foster care in Indiana. They bring this lawsuit as a civil \nrights action on behalf of all children who are now, or will be, in the custody of DCS. For each \nnamed plaintiff, DCS has failed to provide safe and appropriate foster care placements; failed to \nprovide appropriate services to the children and their families to allow safe reunification; and, for \nthose for whom safe family reunification is not possible, failed to timely pursue termination of \nparental rights legal proceedings and failed to seek and secure safe, permanent homes.  In doing \nso, Defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ federal constitutional and statutory rights.  \n7.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants—the state \nagency and state officials responsible for operating Indiana’s foster care system—for violating \nPlaintiffs’ rights under the U.S. Constitution and federal laws, which promise vulnerable children \nfor whom the State has assumed responsibility the right to be free from physical and psychological \nharm. The subclass of children with disabilities who are currently residing in institutional settings \nare further entitled to be free from discrimination based on their disabilities under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”). \n8.  Director Bonaventura’s resignation prompted Governor Holcomb to commission \nan evaluation of DCS. On June 18, 2018, the CWG released its Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (“the CWG Report”), which identified a number of challenges \nfacing Indiana’s child welfare system, including, but not limited to, Indiana’s: \na.  Extremely high rate of children in out-of-home care compared to the rest of \nthe nation; \n                                                 \n1 The named Plaintiff children and any other minors mentioned by name in this Complaint all appear by \npseudonyms with the same first and last initials as their real names.  \n  3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 4 of 85 PageID #: 144\n   \n   \nb.  High caseloads amongst DCS Family Case Managers (“FCMs”) and agency \nattorneys; \nc.  High rates of FCM and DCS attorney turnover, as well as a “culture of fear” \nwithin DCS; \nd.  Highly centralized management and approval processes that lead to delayed \nservice delivery for children and their families; \ne.  Uneven interpretation and implementation of policies across counties; and \nf.  DCS’s  failure  to  meet  the  federal  standard  for  instances  of  repeat \nmaltreatment. \n9.  Notably, the CWG Report revealed that there have been at least five other DCS \nevaluations prepared by external evaluators since 2013. Those prior reports highlight many of the \nsame systemic issues afflicting Indiana’s child welfare system today. Despite the fact that these \nissues have been called to the attention of officials before, they persist.  Moreover, the recent \nchanges announced by the Governor are not fundamental and do not address the systemic issues  \nraised by the CWG Report.   Indeed, many of the statements issued by DCS in its periodic progress \nreports, the most recent of which was issued on June 14, 2019, either involve DCS having more \nmeetings with state officials or creating processes that enable DCS to deny responsibility for many \nof the problems. \n10.  The problems with Indiana’s child welfare system run even deeper than those \ncovered by the CWG Report. DCS lacks sufficient foster placements for youth alleged to be \nChildren in Need of Services (“CHINS”), leaving children for extended periods of time in \nemergency shelter care or forcing children to sleep in DCS offices; fails to engage in appropriate \nplacement matching, subjecting children to multiple and inappropriate foster care placements; \n  4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 5 of 85 PageID #: 145\n   \n   \nregularly separates sibling groups; and fails to provide children with disabilities with adequate  \nsupport services to meet their medical,  psychological, or developmental needs in the most \nappropriate, least restrictive environment.  \n11.  Additionally, when children cannot be safely reunified with their parents, DCS fails \nto develop a realistic alternative permanency plan, often filing multiple unsuccessful termination \nof parental rights petitions. In instances where children are legally freed for adoption, DCS has \nfailed to seek and secure appropriate adoptive homes in a timely manner, essentially rendering \nthese children legal orphans.  \n12.  DCS has also failed to provide appropriate integrated community-based services, \nprograms, or activities to children with disabilities who are wards of DCS, consistent with their \nindividual needs. Instead, DCS routinely places these children in overly restrictive residential or \ninstitutional settings. For many children with disabilities, their involvement in the child welfare \nsystem places them at a greater risk of institutionalization. \n13.  Plaintiffs  seek  a  ruling  from  this  Court  that  the  structural  deficiencies  and \nlong-standing actions and inactions of the Defendants described in this Complaint violate the \nstatutory and constitutional rights of all children dependent on the Indiana child welfare system \nfor their safety, well-being, and futures. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against \nDCS  and  state  officials  named  as  Defendants  in  this  lawsuit,  directing  that  necessary  and \nappropriate relief be granted so that Indiana’s children are no longer irreparably harmed by the \nsystem that that has failed its mandate to protect them. Plaintiffs ask this Court to protect their \nright to a safe and nurturing childhood.  \n  5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 6 of 85 PageID #: 146\n   \n   \nPARTIES \nA.

DCS is the agency with overall non-delegable custodial responsibility for \ninvestigating allegations of child abuse and neglect, placing children in appropriate and safe foster \n  9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 10 of 85 PageID #: 150\n   \n   \ncare placements, ensuring children’s safety and well-being, and guaranteeing that children in foster \ncare receive appropriate services, mental health screening, and treatment. DCS also regulates and \nlicenses Indiana’s child caring institutions, foster homes, group homes, and child placing agencies. \nDCS has offices throughout the state, including in this District.  \n30.  Terry Stigdon, Director of DCS, is sued in her official capacity. Director Stigdon \nis “responsible for administering” DCS. IND. CODE § 31-25-1(b) (2019). She employs personnel \nto carry out DCS’s responsibilities and must organize DCS in a manner best suited for providing \nits necessary services and carrying out its functions throughout the state. Director Stigdon is \nultimately responsible for ensuring DCS finds suitable homes for children in need of care, keeps \nthem safe while in DCS custody, properly supervises children, and provides them and their \nfamilies with necessary services.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n31.  This action for injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is based upon the \ncontinuing violations of Plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments of \nthe  United  States  Constitution,  the  Adoption  Assistance  and  Child  Welfare  Act  of  1980 \n(“AACWA”), the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, and the respective implementing regulations.    \n32.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). \n33.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n34.  Venue  in  this  District  is  proper  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)  because  a \nsubstantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District, \n  10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 11 of 85 PageID #: 151\n   \n   \nand Defendants maintain offices and conduct business in this District. In addition, two of the \nnamed Plaintiffs’ CHINS cases were filed in this District.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nA.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES \nPLAGUING INDIANA’S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND RESULTING \nHARM TO PLAINTIFF CHILDREN. \n \n35.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n36.  This action consists of one general class and one subclass: \na.  A class comprised of all children for whom Indiana DCS has or will ever \nhave legal responsibility and/or a special relationship in the context of the \nchild protection system (the “General Class”); and \nb.  A subclass comprised of all members of the General Class who have or will \nhave  emotional,  psychological,  cognitive,  or  physical  disabilities  (the \n“ADA Subclass”). \n37.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 22,000 children who are in the legal and/or physical custody of DCS \nand/or  with  whom  DCS  has  a  special  relationship.  Over  14,300  of  these  children  are  in \nout-of-home care. \n38.  The ADA Subclass consists of thousands of children with disabilities who are or \nwill become a ward of DCS and who, because of a disability, are at a higher risk of being placed \nin overly-restrictive, institutional settings or are currently placed in overly restrictive institutional \nsettings.  \n  11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 12 of 85 PageID #: 152\n   \n   \n39.  The questions of fact and law raised by named Plaintiffs are common and typical \nof each putative member of the classes whom they seek to represent.  \n40.  The named Plaintiffs rely on Defendants for foster care services in Indiana and \nwholly depend on Defendants for provisions of those services.  \n41.  Defendants’  long-standing  and  well-documented  actions  and  inactions \nsubstantially depart from accepted professional judgment and constitute deliberate indifference to \nthe harm, risk of harm, and violations of legal rights suffered by the named Plaintiffs and the \nclasses they represent.  \n42.  Questions of fact common to the classes include: \na.  whether  Defendants  fail  to  protect  the  General  Class  from  physical, \npsychological, and emotional harm; \nb.  whether Defendants fail to make sufficient efforts to place members of the \nGeneral Class in appropriate permanent homes within a reasonable period \nof time;  \nc.  whether  Defendants  fail  to  provide  foster  care  placements  and \nindividualized services that ensure members of the General Class’s well-\nbeing; \nd.  whether Defendants provide adequate case worker resources to ensure that \nmembers of the General Class can routinely and meaningfully meet with \ncaseworkers face-to-face and engage in individual services; \ne.  whether Defendants operate a system that provides an adequate diversity of \nplacements to permit the members of the General Class and ADA Subclass \n  12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 13 of 85 PageID #: 153\n   \n   \nto reside in the most integrated, least restrictive, and most family-like \nenvironment; \nf.  whether Defendants fail to take reasonable steps to make it such that \nmembers of the General Class do not experience failed trial home visits; \nand \ng.  whether Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass necessary and \nappropriate services and treatment to ensure access to a stable, family-like \nfoster placement in the least restrictive environments. \nh.  whether Defendants failed to provide appropriate, integrated community-\nbased services, programs, or activities to the Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass \nin order to support their needs in the community and prevent unnecessary \nand prolonged institutionalization.   \ni.  whether Defendants have placed an over-reliance on institutional settings \nfor Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass and have failed to provide meaningful \ncase management services or create a realistic permanency plan that does \nnot include institutionalization. \nj.  whether Defendants have violated the rights of the plaintiffs within the \nADA Subclass by administering the State's foster care system in a manner \nthat denies qualified children with disabilities the benefits of the State's \nservices, programs, or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs, and by failing to reasonably modify the State's foster care \nsystem to avoid discrimination against children with disabilities. \n43.  Questions of law common to the classes include: \n  13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 14 of 85 PageID #: 154\n   \n   \na.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive rights \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution; \nb.  whether  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  right  to  a \npermanent home and family, as well as their right to be free from harm and \nhave  their  basic  needs  met  under  the  First,  Ninth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution; \nc.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997;  \nd.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the respective \nimplementing regulations; by unnecessarily placing youth with disabilities, \nor placing them at risk thereof, in institutional settings and denying them \naccess to meaningful, individualized, and appropriate community-based \ntreatment and supports. \n44.  The violations of law and resulting harms averred by Plaintiffs are typical of the \nlegal violations and harms and/or risk of harms experienced by all of the children in the classes. \n45.  The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the classes \nthat they seek to represent. Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable \nto all members of the classes, necessitating class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. Counsel \nfor Plaintiffs know of no conflict among the class members.  \n  14 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 15 of 85 PageID #: 155\n   \n   \n46.  The named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Children are represented by the following \nattorneys, who are competent and experienced in class action litigation, child welfare litigation, \nand complex litigation: \na.  Marcia Robinson Lowry, an attorney with A Better Childhood, Inc., a non-\nprofit  legal  advocacy  organization,  who  has  extensive  experience  and \nexpertise in federal child welfare class actions throughout the U.S.;  \nb.  Melissa Keyes, Thomas Crishon, and Nikki Gray, attorneys with Indiana \nDisability Rights, which is the service arm of the Indiana Protection and \nAdvocacy  Services  Commission,  who  have  extensive  experience  and \nexpertise representing individuals with disabilities; and  \nc.  Aaron Marks, Carrie Bodner, Kara Cheever, and Kristen Bokhan, attorneys \nwith Kirkland & Ellis LLP, which has extensive experience and expertise \nin federal class actions throughout the U.S. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  OVERVIEW OF DCS AND FEDERAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL \nREQUIREMENTS. \nA.  The Role of DCS. \n47.  DCS is the Indiana state agency responsible for the safety and well-being of all \nHoosier children who come into contact with the state’s child welfare system.  DCS has a central \noffice in Indianapolis and 18 regional offices that cover Indiana’s 92 counties. \n48.  DCS’s mandate is twofold:  it is charged with overseeing the protection of Hoosier \nchildren and with child support enforcement.  DCS is the primary state agency responsible for \nreceiving and assessing reports of alleged child abuse and neglect.  Under Indiana law, DCS’s \nresponsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing child protection services; providing child \n  15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 16 of 85 PageID #: 156\n   \n   \nabuse  and  neglect  prevention  services;  providing  family  preservation  services;  regulating, \nlicensing, and monitoring foster family homes, licensed child placing agencies, child caring \ninstitutions, group homes, and private secure facilities; administering foster care services; and \nconducting adoption and guardianship services.  \n49.  DCS has created child welfare policies and practice standards in order to carry out \nits responsibilities and comply with legal requirements under state and federal law.  \n50.  The Director of DCS employs personnel to carry out DCS’s mandate, including but \nnot limited to family case managers (“FCMs”), who are responsible for investigating allegations \nof abuse and neglect as well as planning for children in foster care. The Director is also responsible \nfor monitoring and supervising the services associated with ongoing child in need of services \n(“CHINS”) cases.  \n51.  Limits on FCM caseloads are intended to help ensure that each child and family \nreceives sufficient attention and prevents burnout among FCMs.  By statute, FCM caseloads are \nto be capped at 12 families who are receiving in-home services and 13 children who are in out-of-\nhome placements, a provision which was passed by this session of the legislature and went into \neffect on June 13, 2019. However, defendants did not meet the caseload limits set previously, when \nthe caseloads were capped at 12 cases for assessment of reports of abuse and/or neglect and 17 for \nongoing cases. \n52.  DCS also contracts with numerous service providers throughout Indiana to deliver \nservices related to the prevention of abuse and neglect, preservation of families, placement of \nchildren, and permanency goals for children who enter foster care. \nB.  Overview of Federal Law. \n  16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 17 of 85 PageID #: 157\n   \n   \n53.  The U.S. Constitution and federal statutes impose affirmative obligations on all \nstate and child welfare officials, including Defendants and others employed by DCS.   \n54.  For instance, the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that all state \nand local child welfare officials ensure that each child placed in foster care: is free from the \nforeseeable risk of physical, psychological, and emotional harm; receives the services necessary \nfor his or her physical, psychological, and emotional well-being; is provided with conditions, \ntreatment, and care consistent with the purpose and assumption of custody; is not maintained in \ncustody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of custody; and is provided with an \nappropriate permanent home and family within a reasonable period of time. \n55.  Similarly, federal law requires that state child welfare officials place each child in \nfoster care in a foster placement that conforms to nationally recommended professional standards, \nand provide each child quality services to protect his or her safety and health. See 42 U.S.C. §§ \n671(a)(10),(22). Officials must also provide an individualized, written case plan that seeks to \nprovide safe, appropriate, and stable foster care placements or, when reunification with the child’s \nparents is not possible or appropriate, a written case plan that ensures the identification of an \nappropriate adoptive or other permanent home for the child. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16); \n675(1)(A),(E). Written case plans must also ensure the child’s educational stability. See 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(G). \n56.  Federal law also regulates child welfare officials’ case review systems, and requires \nthat these officials maintain a case review system in which: each child in foster care has a case \nplan designed to achieve safe, appropriate, and stable foster care placements; the status of each \nchild in foster care is reviewed at least every six months by a court or person responsible for case \nmanagement for purposes of determining the safety of the child, the continuing necessity and \n  17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 18 of 85 PageID #: 158\n   \n   \nappropriateness of the foster placement, the extent of compliance with the permanency plan, and \nthe projected date of permanency; and, for each child who has been in foster care for 15 of the \nmost recent 22 months, the responsible child welfare agency files a petition to terminate the \nparental rights of the child’s parents and concurrently identifies, recruits, processes, and approves \na qualified family for an adoption, or documents compelling reasons for determining that filing \nsuch a petition would not be in the best interests of the child. See  42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16); \n675(5)(A)-(C),(E). \n57.  Title II of the ADA prohibits the unjustified segregation of persons with disabilities, \nsee 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999), and requires that state \nagencies, such as Defendants, “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n58.  Defendants have and continue to violate each of the aforementioned federal rights \nof the named Plaintiffs and other Hoosier children in the affected Class.  \nII.  THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS. \n59.  DCS’s failings are readily apparent in the case of the named Plaintiffs, all of whom \nhave suffered significant harm under Defendants’ watch.   \nA.  Ashley W. and Betty W. \n60.  Ashley W. and Betty W. are sisters. Ashley is four years old and Betty is five years \nold. Ashley and Betty have been in court-ordered out-of-home placement under the custody of \nDCS for over two-and-a-half years. Prior to entering foster care, they were living with their mother \nand stepfather.  \n61.  Ashley and Betty’s father is not a respondent in the CHINS action.  \n62.  Ashley and Betty first came to the attention of DCS in July 2016. DCS received a \nreport that Ashley (then age one) and Betty (then age two) were being sexually abused by their \n  18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 19 of 85 PageID #: 159\n   \n   \nstepfather. The report indicated that the girls would hide when their stepfather came home. Betty \nwas observed fondling herself in her diaper and later said she touched her vaginal area because \nthat is what her stepfather does. DCS also received reports that Ashley had soreness and tears in \nher vaginal area. Ashley repeatedly pointed at her vaginal area and said “owie.”  \n63.  Upon receiving the reports, DCS opened the case for an investigation, but did not \nremove the children from the home.  \n64.  A few weeks later, upon information and belief, while DCS’s investigation was \nongoing, DCS received another report that the girls’ mother, stepfather, and other adults were \nabusing methamphetamine in the home. At some point, DCS received additional reports that the \nstepfather kept a gun in the home, punched walls, and was threatening to blow the house up.  \n65.  Upon information and belief, despite receiving credible reports of sexual abuse, \nsubstance abuse, and violence within the home, DCS waited weeks to remove Ashley and Betty \nfrom their home and file a CHINS petition against their mother and stepfather. The CHINS petition \nincluded allegations of substance abuse and having a dirty home, but did not even mention the \ncredible reports of sexual abuse against the sisters.  \n66.  After removing the children from their home, DCS initially placed the girls with \ntheir uncle. This placement failed, and after less than a month, they were moved to their aunt’s \nhome, which, upon information and belief, was an unlicensed kinship placement. At the time, the \naunt was on medical leave from work, and, upon information and belief, repeatedly informed DCS \nthat she could not continue to care for Ashley and Betty after she returned to work in October. She \nalso informed the service providers that she had no help caring for the children and could not afford \nto take care of them. As expected, in October 2016, the aunt requested the girls’ removal. DCS \n  19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 20 of 85 PageID #: 160\n   \n   \nfailed to identify a new placement for the girls despite knowing for over a month that they would \nneed to be moved.  \n67.  Instead, DCS placed Ashley and Betty in emergency shelter care, where they \nremained for almost two months. This placement was in direct violation of DCS policy, which \ndoes not recommend placement of children under the age of 10 in residential settings, and limits \nemergency shelter care stays to 20 days unless there are exceptional circumstances and approval \nfrom the Deputy Director of Placement Support and Compliance. While Ashley and Betty were in \nemergency shelter care, their behaviors began to noticeably deteriorate during their weekly \nsupervised visits. \n68.  Beginning in December 2016, Ashley and Betty were placed with a series of \nout-of-home foster parents. Over the course of the next two years, Ashley and Betty cycled through \n13 and 14 additional placements respectively, many of which lasted for only a month. \n69.  The girls also spent the winter holidays in 2017 in emergency shelter care again. \nBy DCS’s own admission in its policy on placement changes, “[d]isruption in placement may have \nserious negative consequences for [children’s] sense of security and self-worth. A placement \nchange may be another loss, rejection, or possible trauma for [children] and may affect the \n[children’s] ability to form positive attachments in the future.” DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 38, Version \n4 (July 1, 2018). \n70.  Many of Ashley and Betty’s foster parents, as well as their therapists, noticed that \nthe girls displayed sexually maladaptive behaviors. Betty was increasingly violent towards other \nchildren, and the girls were physically aggressive with one another. Betty was also sexually acting \nout on Ashley as a result of the abuse she suffered.  \n  20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 21 of 85 PageID #: 161\n   \n   \n71.  Despite the significant trauma Ashley and Betty reportedly experienced at home \nand their concerning behaviors while in DCS care, DCS did not provide Ashley and Betty any \ncommunity-based  services  until  months  after  they  were  removed  from  their  home.  Upon \ninformation and belief, in January 2017, approximately five months after their initial placement, a \nfoster parent requested therapy for the girls to address their concerning behaviors, as well as their \ncognitive and speech delays. Only after this foster parent’s request did DCS enroll Betty in \nhome-based/play therapy and Ashley in speech therapy and home-based/play therapy.  \n72.  The girls’ sexually maladaptive and aggressive behaviors were noted by their \ntherapists as well as during weekly supervised visits with their mother and father. \n73.  Ashley and Betty’s visits with their father quickly progressed to unsupervised visits \nat his home. Soon after visits at his home started, the girls’ foster parent complained that the \nfather’s residence had a flea infestation. As a result, in January 2017, DCS requested that the \nfather’s visits revert to being supervised, and the court temporarily ordered supervised visits. DCS \nnoted that the father lacked appropriate housing and displayed concerning behavior when visiting \nwith the girls.  \n74.  Despite these concerns, in the spring of 2017, DCS placed Ashley and Betty on a \ntrial home visit with their father. At the same time, only a few short months after services began, \nDCS ended home-based/play therapy for both girls because they had purportedly met their \ntreatment goals. \n75.  Per DCS policy, trial home visits are for a period of up to three months, which may \nbe extended in three month increments, “when the safety and well-being of the child can be \nreasonably ensured” and the child’s permanency goal is reunification, there is progress towards \nthe case goals, any safety concerns have been addressed, and the service level of the case can be \n  21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 22 of 85 PageID #: 162\n   \n   \ndecreased. DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 39, Version 5 (Jan. 1, 2019). Service levels are based on a family’s \nrisk level, and factors which might suggest that a child can remain safely in a home, include, but \nare not limited to, whether the non-offending parent demonstrates protective capacities and \nacknowledges the risk to the child, whether the non-offending parent and child are in a safe \nlocation, and other issues, such as substance abuse or mental health, do not pose safety threats. See \nDCS Policy, Ch. 4, § 26, Version 3 (May 1, 2009). \n76.  DCS maintains placement and care responsibilities for children who are on trial \nhome visits and the FCM must provide continued services to the family and make weekly face-to-\nface contact with the children and parent. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 39, Version 5 (Jan. 1, 2019); \nCh. 8, § 10, Version 11 (Mar. 1, 2019).  \n77.  Upon information and belief, DCS failed to ensure the girls’ well-being while they \nwere living with their father. The trial home visit failed within two months, and DCS requested \nauthorization to remove the girls from their father’s home due to allegations of neglect. In the two \nmonths in their father’s care, Ashley and Betty were dirty, had lice, contracted ringworms, missed \nservice appointments, and had unexplained bruises and injuries on their bodies. In addition, Betty \ndeveloped a urinary tract infection, Ashley suffered a black eye, and their father tested positive on \ntwo drug screens.  \n78.  After the failed trial home visit, DCS placed the girls together in a series of non-\nkinship foster homes. DCS also resumed supervised visitation with the father. Ashley and Betty \ncontinued to engage in sexually maladaptive behaviors and fight with one another in their foster \nhomes, during therapy sessions, and during visits. After a several-month disruption in their \ntherapy, DCS re-enrolled the girls in therapy.  \n  22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 23 of 85 PageID #: 163\n   \n   \n79.  During a May 2017 play therapy session, Betty verbalized, for the first time, that \nher stepfather had sexually abused her. In the summer of 2017, the girls’ therapist noted that Ashley \nwas starting to mimic some of her older sister’s sexually maladaptive behaviors, and the therapist \ndetermined it was best to separate the girls for their therapy sessions. Ashley and Betty continued \nto report and show signs of trauma during their therapy sessions over the following year. In July \n2018, Ashley reported that her stepfather had sexually abused her. Ashley also reported that Betty \nwas sexually abusing her. \n80.  The girls continued to cycle through foster home placements, and in October 2018, \nAshley  (four  years  old)  and  Betty  (five  years  old)  were  separated  and  placed  in  different \nnon-kinship foster homes. Ashley was moved again, to her 17th foster home.  \n81.  Upon information and belief, since October 2018, Ashley and Betty only see each \nother during their weekly joint-supervised visits with their father.  \n82.  DCS did not change the girls’ permanency goal to adoption until the fall of 2018—\ntwo years after they entered foster care and more than a year since Betty had made her own \nallegations of sexual abuse against her stepfather. At the same time DCS changed the sisters’ \npermanency goals to adoption, it separated them, making it less likely that the two sisters will be \nadopted by the same family.  \n83.  DCS filed a termination of parental rights petition regarding Ashley and Betty, but \nthe judge dismissed it in February 2019 because DCS had failed to meet a statutory deadline. \nTherefore,  the  termination  of  parental  rights  process  had  to  begin  anew,  further  delaying \nachievement of the girls’ permanency plans.  \n  23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 24 of 85 PageID #: 164\n   \n   \n84.  Upon information and belief, there have been at least three FCMs assigned to the \ngirls, further adding to the girls’ experience of instability while in foster care and contributing to \ncase management problems.  \n85.  When Betty entered foster care, she was assessed to be a Child and Adolescent \nNeeds and Strengths (“CANS”) level two. CANS is a tool developed for children’s services to \nsupport and inform decision-making, including to determine the appropriate level of care and \nnecessary service planning, and to better monitor the outcome of services. Two years later, likely \nas a result of her traumatic experience in foster care, she was assessed to be a CANS level seven, \na more serious level, which typically requires residential placement.  \n86.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Ashley and Betty have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had \nmade reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement \nmatching, not acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Ashley and \nBetty’s cases, and not acted with deliberate indifference to their legal rights, Defendants may well \nhave prevented years of additional trauma the girls have suffered while in the custody of DCS. \nB.  Milo S. and Thomas M. \n87.  Milo S. and Thomas M. are brothers. Milo is three years old and Thomas is five \nyears old. Milo has been in foster care for nearly three years—his entire life, and Thomas has been \nin foster care for over four years. Milo has been in two foster homes. Thomas has been placed in \nfive foster homes and experienced one failed trial home visit. Milo and Thomas currently live \n  24 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 25 of 85 PageID #: 165\n   \n   \ntogether in a pre-adoptive non-kinship foster home. The boys have a half-sister, Caroline T., who, \nupon information and belief, is eight years old and is placed in a separate non-kinship foster home.  \n88.  In March 2015, DCS responded to a report that the children’s mother and her \nthen-husband were involved in a domestic violence-related altercation. DCS removed Thomas, \nwho  was  at  the  mother’s  home,  because  of  domestic  violence  and  the  mother’s  use  of \nmethamphetamine. Upon information and belief, both Thomas and his sister were placed in DCS \ncustody in the home of Thomas’s grandmother, where they lived for nearly a year. In February \n2016, DCS moved two-year-old Thomas to another foster home or relative placement for less than \na week. He was moved again in February 2016 to a foster home or relative placement, where he \nremained for only four-and-a-half months. Upon information and belief, at some point during these \nplacement changes Thomas and Caroline were placed in separate non-kinship foster homes. \n89.  On March 21, 2015, DCS filed a petition alleging Thomas and Caroline were \nChildren in Need of Services, and on April 16, 2015, the children were adjudicated CHINS. On \nJune 8, 2015, the trial court entered its dispositional order on the case, ordering the parents to \nengage in services. \n90.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  children  were  assigned  the  same  FCMs \nthroughout their child welfare proceedings, and, initially, Spencer County DCS was assigned to \nthe children’s case. The first FCM assigned to the case was replaced by a second FCM. DCS \nterminated the second FCM for filing a false report in connection with the family. DCS replaced \nher with a third FCM. The third FCM was on the case for a short period of time and was replaced \nby a fourth FCM. \n  25 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 26 of 85 PageID #: 166\n   \n   \n91.  At some point, the fourth FCM and Caroline’s father began engaging in a sexual \nrelationship. Caroline’s father testified that the fourth FCM gave him advanced notice of drug \nscreens and informed him that he did not need to continue engaging in certain services.  \n92.  In March 2016, while Caroline was on a trial home visit with her father, the \nchildren’s FCM gave Caroline’s father a drug screen, which he failed. The FCM assured the father \nshe would “take care of it,” but Caroline’s father failed a subsequent drug screen as well. He was \narrested for violating the terms of his probation and reported the FCM to her supervisor. Soon \nthereafter, DCS fired the fourth FCM based on her inappropriate relationship with Caroline’s \nfather. In March 2016, a fifth FCM took over the children’s case. \n93.  During this time, the mother was engaged in services, but DCS denied her requests \nfor a trial home visit. On May 24, 2016, the mother gave birth to Milo, and, upon information and \nbelief, DCS allowed the mother to take him home, despite the open CHINS proceeding involving \nher two other children. Thomas and Milo’s father was incarcerated at the time of Milo’s birth for \nfailing to register as a sex offender. \n94.  On July 8, 2016, DCS sent Thomas and Caroline on a trial home visit with their \nmother. While on the trial home visit, DCS was obligated to maintain placement and care \nresponsibilities, and the FCM was required to both provide services and make weekly face-to-face \ncontact with the children and parent.  \n95.  Despite DCS’s obligation to closely monitor the family, DCS failed to intervene \nwhile the mother neglected all three children during Thomas and Caroline’s trial home visit. On \nSeptember 6, 2016, following a hearing, the mother went to the local DCS office and admitted to \nusing methamphetamine over the weekend. She stated that while she was using, she left her three \nchildren with her elderly father, who was in poor health and unable to care for the children, and \n  26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 27 of 85 PageID #: 167\n   \n   \nher 20-year-old son, who was facing child molestation criminal charges. The mother returned \nhome while she was under the influence of methamphetamine to care for her three children.  \n96.  On  September  6,  2016,  DCS  removed  Thomas,  Milo  and  Caroline.  Upon \ninformation and belief, at this time DCS filed a CHINS petition against the mother on behalf of \nMilo. Thomas and Milo were placed in a non-kinship foster home and Caroline was placed with a \nkinship placement. At the time of his removal, Milo, who was only three months old, had severe \nscabies, and it appeared as though he had had the scabies for some time. Milo had sores on his \nback, redness on his feet, and bumps on his face, legs, feet, stomach, arms, back, and in the creases \nbetween his fingers and toes.  \n97.  Milo lasted only one day at his first foster home placement. Upon information and \nbelief, on September 7, 2016, Milo was moved to a new non-kinship foster home, because he was \ncrying too much at his previous placement.  \n98.  On September 14, 2016, Thomas was moved into the same foster home as Milo. \nThe boys are still in that foster home, which is a pre-adoptive placement. They were separated \nfrom their sister because DCS was unable to identify a foster home that could take all three \nchildren. \n99.  Upon information and belief, DCS played a minimal role, if any, in setting up \nservices and evaluations for the boys. Instead, upon information and belief, DCS relied on Thomas \nand Milo’s foster mother to arrange services and medical appointments. Thomas was initially \ndiagnosed with Adjustment Disorder and attended individual therapy. His foster mother expressed \nconcerns about Thomas’s behavior, but the FCM did not arrange for an additional evaluation. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  in  December  2018,  the  foster  mother  took  Thomas  in  for  a \nneurological-psychological evaluation. Upon information and belief, Thomas was diagnosed with \n  27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 28 of 85 PageID #: 168\n   \n   \nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder  and  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  and  he  was \nprescribed medication. \n100.  Milo is diagnosed with contact dermatitis and eczema. He received physical therapy \nfor a developmental delay until he was about one year old. \n101.  DCS also failed to arrange services for the mother. For instance, in February 2017, \nthe mother contacted the FCM to ask for help finding an inpatient substance abuse treatment center. \nThe FCM provided the mother with a list of inpatient treatment facilities but testified it was the \nmother’s “responsibility to get into those places.” A.S. v. Ind. Dep’t of Child Servs., 111 N.E.3d \n207, 210-11 (Ind. Ct. App. 2018). Ultimately, the mother moved in with Caroline’s father and lost \nher job due to lack of transportation. \n102.  On January 8, 2018, the parental rights of the boys’ mother and father were \ninvoluntarily terminated. The mother appealed the termination, and on July 9, 2018, the Court of \nAppeals of Indiana reversed and remanded the order terminating the mother’s parental rights. See \nid. at 213. The mother’s parental rights were reinstated on September 11, 2018. In its decision, the \nCourt of Appeals noted that the case involved not only five FCMs, two of whom were terminated \nfor inappropriate behavior, but also four DCS attorneys. See id. at 212. The boys’ father did not \nappeal the termination of his parental rights. \n103.  In 2018, Thomas and Milo’s case was reassigned to a sixth FCM from the Perry \nCounty DCS office. Upon information and belief, Perry County DCS took over the case because \nof Spencer County DCS’s serious mishandling of the case.  \n104.  Upon information and belief, the mother voluntarily surrendered her parental rights \nin the spring of 2019. The boys are both freed for adoption but have not yet achieved permanency. \n  28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 29 of 85 PageID #: 169\n   \n   \n105.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Thomas and Milo have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had \nmade reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning, not acted in \ndisregard of professional standards as to the management of Thomas and Milo’s cases, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to their legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented \nadditional trauma the boys have suffered while in the custody of DCS.  \nC.  Jaidyn R. & James M. \n106.  Jaidyn  and  James  are  currently  in  court-ordered  out-of-home  placement  in  a \nnon-kinship foster home. The boys have been in the custody of DCS since December 12, 2016. \n107.  Jaidyn was born on September 28, 2014 and is four years old. James was born on \nMarch 10, 2016 and is three years old. The boys share the same mother but have different fathers. \n108.   James was born three months premature and weighed only two pounds at the time \nof his birth. Upon information and belief, James was born with severely underdeveloped lungs, a \npossible heart defect, thyroid level abnormalities, and marijuana in his system. Once he was \ndischarged from the hospital, his mother failed to follow through with his required breathing \ntreatments and doctor appointments.  \n109.  DCS received several  reports of suspected child abuse or neglect concerning Jaidyn \nand James prior to their December 12, 2016 removal. On March 14, 2016, DCS substantiated a \nreport that James was a drug-exposed infant. Upon information and belief, in late 2016, DCS \nreceived multiple reports of suspected child neglect, but DCS failed to substantiate any of the \nreports. \n110.  On December 7, 2016, the mother called 911 and drove James to a hospital located \nin Fort Wayne, Indiana, because he was non-responsive. The mother reported that James, who was \n  29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 30 of 85 PageID #: 170\n   \n   \nseven months old and weighed only six pounds, had been lethargic for the previous three days. \nThe mother admitted she was not giving James necessary medication at home and had not taken \nhim to the doctor for months. James was admitted to the hospital for severe malnourishment and a \nfailure to thrive. On the same day, hospital staff made a report of suspected child abuse to the DCS \nhotline, and DCS opened an investigation. \n111.  On December 12, 2016, Jaidyn and James were removed from their mother and her \nboyfriend, James’s father, and placed in a non-kinship foster home. DCS informed the foster \nparents that James was hospitalized and would likely remain in the hospital for a few months. \nUpon information and belief, DCS provided the foster parents with incorrect names for the boys, \nan incorrect Medicaid number, and minimal information regarding their histories or medical needs. \nThis violated DCS’s own policy, which requires that DCS provide foster parents with information \nregarding the reason for the removal, full and accurate medical information, the children’s \nMedicaid numbers and other insurance information, and any special needs, among other things. \nSee DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 9, Version 7 (July 1, 2018). Moreover, upon information and belief, at \nthe time of his initial placement, the foster mother noticed that Jaidyn had large circular scars on \nhis upper thighs that resembled burns from a car lighter. \n112.  Upon information and belief, soon thereafter, the foster mother visited James at the \nhospital. To her surprise, two days later, on December 14, 2016, the hospital told her they were \nreleasing James. DCS neither oversaw the introduction of the foster parents to James nor his \ndischarge from the hospital to their home. \n113.  Jaidyn and James’s mother gave birth to another baby boy on December 18, 2016. \nThis baby was also born prematurely and was placed in out-of-home care after the mother tested \npositive for marijuana at the hospital. He was placed in a different non-kinship foster home from \n  30 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 31 of 85 PageID #: 171\n   \n   \nhis brothers because DCS could not identify a foster home that could care for a toddler and two \nmedically fragile infants.  \n114.  After leaving the hospital, James had to see an occupational and physical therapist \nthree times a week, a pediatrician once a week, a surgeon as needed, a pulmonologist every month, \nan ENT doctor as needed, a neonatal intensive care unit doctor, and a Women, Infants, and \nChildren federal grant specialist. James also receives weekly therapy. Initially, Jaidyn only had to \nsee a pediatrician as needed. Upon information and belief, the boys’ foster parents secured these \nnumerous appointments without, or with minimal, DCS assistance. \n115.  Over the next year, James’s foster parents had to take him to the hospital three times \nand the emergency room twice due to his severe medical issues. \n116.  The court entered a CHINS finding against the mother and James’s father on \nFebruary 2, 2017. The same day, the court entered a dispositional finding, continuing the children’s \nplacement with DCS and ordering services for the parents. The parents’ ordered services included \nsubmitting to diagnostic assessments, engaging in substance abuse treatment, submitting to drug \nscreens, engaging in home-based services, completing a psychological assessment, participating \nin anger management classes, and visiting with their children. Both parents failed to comply with \ntheir court-ordered services and repeatedly tested positive for marijuana. In addition, on February \n16, 2017, James’s father tested positive for trace amounts of cocaine. \n117.  The parents were granted supervised visits with the boys twice weekly for a total \nof eight hours. The parents regularly arrived late and failed to appear for nearly a third of the visits. \nThey were also permitted to attend the children’s medical appointments, but rarely took advantage \nof this opportunity.  \n  31 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 32 of 85 PageID #: 172\n   \n   \n118.  On October 14, 2017, the mother was arrested and criminally charged with Neglect \nof a Dependent Resulting in Serious Injury, stemming from her neglect of James. Later that month, \nthe mother was evicted from her home, which she shared with James’s father. James’s father \nstopped attending visits and participating in any services in the fall of 2017. \n119.  On November 14, 2017, DCS, in its Permanency Plan, sought permission from the \ncourt to initiate a termination of parental rights proceeding. DCS noted that James’s father failed \nto benefit from services and the boys’ mother was incarcerated.  \n120.  In early 2018, James’s father informed DCS that he was homeless and again tested \npositive for THC with trace amounts of cocaine.  \n121.  On February 16, 2018, the mother pled guilty and was sentenced to nine years’ \nincarceration with four years executed and five years’ probation following her release. She is \nexpected to spend two-and-a-half years in prison, with an early release date, upon information and \nbelief, in the summer or fall of 2019. During her incarceration and probationary period, the mother \nis prohibited from being around any child under the age of 14. She is permitted supervised \nvisitation with Jaidyn, but not James. \n122.  On March 20, 2018, after the boys had been in their foster home for more than two \nyears, DCS abandoned its plan to terminate the parents’ parental rights. Instead, DCS, at the behest \nof the boys’ mother and James’s father, asked the court to place Jaidyn, James and their younger \nbrother with their maternal great aunt within 90 days. Prior to moving the boys, DCS asked the \ncourt to order alternating weekend visitation with the aunt. The aunt had no intention of adopting \nthe boys and indicated she would care for them only until their mother could be reunited with \nthem—in seven-and-a-half years. The children’s guardian ad litem (“GAL”) and court appointed \nspecial advocate (“CASA”) both objected to the proposed move, and, instead, advocated for the \n  32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 33 of 85 PageID #: 173\n   \n   \nthree boys to remain in their respective foster homes, all of which were pre-adoptive. The GAL \nand CASA noted the foster mothers stayed at home with the children in order to meet their \nextensive medical needs and recommended that DCS file a petition to terminate the parents’ rights \nand change the goal to adoption. \n123.  On August 6, 2018, DCS again asked that the court transfer all three boys to the \naunt’s home. Upon information and belief, the aunt still had never met the boys.  \n124.  By October 2018, DCS had lost contact with James’s father due to his continued \nhomelessness and failure to notify DCS of his whereabouts.  \n125.  In the fall of 2018, Jaidyn was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. At \nthe foster parents’ request, DCS submitted a referral for therapy and Jaidyn was evaluated. But the \nprovider  agency  indicated  they  did  not  have  sufficient  staff  to  provide  Jaidyn  with  the \nrecommended therapy services. As a result, upon information and belief, his foster parents had to \nsearch for a new therapist through a different agency. \n126.  A hearing to determine whether the children should be transferred to the care of \ntheir aunt began in November 2018 and concluded in December 2018. The court heard evidence \nthat James has chronic lung disease; was malnourished and suffered from severe reflux when he \nfirst came into foster care; requires oxygen, feeding therapy and breathing treatments; and engages \nin therapy to address his speech and cognitive issues. The court also learned that, in the fall of \n2018, Jaidyn was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and participates in weekly mental \nhealth and speech therapy. The boys’ younger brother likewise suffers from chronic lung disease; \nis regularly seen by a pulmonologist, cardiologist, and pediatrician; and is involved in multiple \nweekly therapies. The court observed that the aunt has one calendar week on and one calendar \nweek off from work and would require a caregiver. Additionally, the children were bonded with \n  33 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 34 of 85 PageID #: 174\n   \n   \ntheir foster parents and lacked an emotional bond with the aunt. A neuropsychologist also testified \nthat removing the children from their foster parents could cause them to develop attachment \ndisorders. Nonetheless, DCS still supported this plan. \n127.  On March 11, 2019, the court concluded that DCS’s proposed permanency plan of \ngranting the aunt custody of the three boys was not in the children’s best interests. The court \nordered a permanency plan of termination of parental rights with adoption for all three boys. At \nthis point, Jaidyn and James had been in foster care for two years and three months. \n128.  Nevertheless, during a status hearing on April 25, 2018, DCS indicated it was in \ndisagreement with the court’s March 11th order and continued to advocate for a change of custody \nto the aunt. The children’s CASA informed the court that a DCS case manager told the foster \nparents that DCS would not file a termination of parental rights petition and is, instead, going to \nwait until the mother is released from prison and recommend reunification at that time. However, \neven if the mother is released in mid-2019, the no contact order will be in place until 2024, \nprohibiting her from having any contact with James and limiting her to supervised contact with \nJaidyn. In addition, the assigned DCS attorney emailed the CASA a few days before the hearing, \nstating that he had no intention of filing a termination of parental rights petition.  \n129.  To date, the aunt has never visited Jaidyn and James. The boys have not seen their \nfather in well over six months and have not had contact with their mother since her 2017 \nincarceration. They have been in the same pre-adoptive foster home for nearly two-and-a-half \nyears, yet due to DCS’s mismanagement of their case, Jaidyn and James have failed to achieve \npermanency.  \n130.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Jaidyn and James have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had \n  34 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 35 of 85 PageID #: 175\n   \n   \nmade reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning, not acted in \ndisregard of professional standards as to the management of Jaidyn and James’s cases, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to their legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented \nadditional trauma the boys have suffered while in the custody of DCS.  \nD.  Logan S. \n131.  Logan S. is a 12-year-old boy who entered Indiana’s foster care system and became \na ward of DCS over 10 years ago. He was born in Chicago, Illinois. \n132.  In April 2008, when Logan was two years old, DCS received a report that someone \nwas physically abusing him and there was no food or diapers in his home. When DCS came to the \nhome to investigate, police were in the process of arresting the mother and father. The mother had \nan outstanding warrant from another state and was also charged with battery. DCS found Logan \nand his older brother in the home. Logan’s brother had scars on his finger, which he said were \nfrom the father whipping him with a spatula. The brother also had a burn mark on his body and \nadditional marks on his back. On a later date, the brother reported that the mother used all kinds \nof “stuff” to whip both him and Logan. During the investigation, DCS observed numerous scars \non Logan’s body. Logan’s brother said that Logan was whipped for drinking water out of the toilet \nand urinating on the floor. \n133.  DCS removed the children and placed them in foster care in April 2008. The court \nfound Logan to be a CHINS in 2008. \n134.  The mother’s parental rights were involuntarily terminated for Logan on January 8, \n2013—five years after entering foster care, when he was six years old.  \n135.  Logan’s father’s parental rights were involuntarily terminated on February 6, 2012. \nHe was never involved with the case.  \n  35 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 36 of 85 PageID #: 176\n   \n   \n136.  Today, Logan has no contact with his biological parents or siblings.  \n137.  During his time in foster care, DCS has moved Logan to at least 15 different \nplacements. This exacerbates Logan’s history of instability. Prior to entering care, Logan’s mother \nwould leave him with other adults while she was incarcerated and later homeless.  \n138.  DCS placed Logan in emergency foster care with a non-kinship foster family from \nApril 23, 2008 until May 2, 2008. After this, Logan was placed in another foster home for \napproximately four months. DCS then moved Logan to live with his maternal grandmother in \nIllinois. \n139.  Logan lived with his grandmother for nine months. This placement, however, \ndisrupted after DCS received an Interstate Compact Placement Case Report. Concerningly, this \nimplies that DCS placed Logan with his grandmother before receiving the full Interstate Compact \nReport, which involves clearances of out-of-state resources and their homes and is required before \nsending a child out-of-state. Indeed, per DCS policy, DCS will not allow an Indiana child to be \nplaced in another state without written approval from both Indiana’s and the receiving state’s \nInterstate Compact on the Placement of Children Office. See DCS Policy, Ch. 9, § 1, Version 2 \n(Mar. 1, 2013).  \n140.  The Interstate Compact Report revealed that Logan’s grandmother had a history \nwith the Illinois Department of Child Services relating to sexual abuse of Logan’s mother and a \nphysical abuse case. The Illinois caseworker noted that the grandmother was not affectionate with \nLogan. Logan also began urinating himself in her home.  \n141.  DCS then placed Logan back in his first (non-emergency) foster home, where he \nlived for less than two months. This family initially stated they wanted to adopt Logan, but they \nchanged their minds, because they claimed Logan did not get along with their biological children.  \n  36 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 37 of 85 PageID #: 177\n   \n   \n142.  DCS moved Logan to another non-kinship foster home, and he lived there for \nalmost two years before the placement disrupted. DCS returned Logan to his first foster family \nagain—their third attempt at making this placement work, but the placement disrupted again two \nmonths later. \n143.  In May 2013, DCS placed Logan in yet another non-kinship foster home, his \nseventh placement in five years. At this point, Logan was legally freed for adoption, but this family \nwas “ambivalent” about adopting Logan and blamed him for anything that went wrong in their \nhome. They refused to cooperate with Logan’s bonding therapist and claimed they could not deal \nwith a child who wets the bed.  \n144.  In January 2014, DCS placed Logan in his first therapeutic foster home with his \nmentor  from  his  wrap-around  services.  During  this  placement,  DCS began  arranging  visits \nbetween Logan and his stepmother, who expressed an interest in caring for Logan. Once these \nvisits  began,  Logan’s  behavior  in  his  foster  home  deteriorated.  Logan  required  two  acute \nhospitalizations while in this home, the second of which lasted over a month. DCS filed a report \nof abuse in the foster home after Logan reported to his FCM that his foster father put him in a \nphysical hold with his hands behind his back, and Logan could not breathe.  \n145.  DCS transferred Logan to another therapeutic foster home, where he lived for only \ntwo months. From July to August of 2016, DCS placed Logan in emergency shelter care in \nIndianapolis because he was displaying self-harm behaviors, including cutting and banging his \nhead on the wall.  \n146.  When he was discharged from emergency shelter care, DCS placed Logan in the \nnon-kinship foster home of his Next Friend, Gloria Coyle. Upon information and belief, Logan \nlived there for one to two years, and he was hospitalized at least once. Ms. Coyle reported that she \n  37 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 38 of 85 PageID #: 178\n   \n   \nreceived minimal information about Logan’s family, placement, or developmental history from \nDCS—leaving her ill-prepared to handle his level of need. This was in violation of DCS policy, \nwhich requires DCS to provide the foster parent with “as much information about the child and his \n. . . case as legally possible.” DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 9, Version 7 (July 1, 2018). By this time, Logan \nwas significantly behind academically, had few friends and poor self-esteem, and experienced \nissues with incontinence. Logan also had “meltdowns,” after which he would beg Ms. Coyle to \nnot have DCS remove him.  \n147.  Upon information and belief, DCS moved Logan from Ms. Coyle’s home because \nDCS identified an adoptive home for him. Upon information and belief, DCS sent Logan on only \ntwo visits with the new family prior the move, leaving both Logan and his potential adoptive \nparents ill-suited for success. Upon information and belief, the placement quickly disrupted. Upon \ninformation and belief, DCS briefly returned Logan to Ms. Coyle's home, but Logan’s behaviors \nhad significantly deteriorated due to the failed pre-adoptive placement. Upon information and \nbelief, DCS removed Logan from Ms. Coyle’s home and placed him in residential care at a facility \nthat  offers  day  treatment,  open  residential  treatment,  psychiatric  residential  treatment,  and \nemergency shelter care. Logan lived there for between one and two years, until May 28, 2018.  \n148.  When Logan was discharged, DCS placed him in a pre-adoptive foster home. He \nwas removed from this home less than three months later because Logan claimed his foster parents \nwere “hurting” and “hitting” him.  \n149.  In August 2018, DCS again placed Logan in emergency shelter care because he had \nallegedly made false allegations against his foster parents. \n  38 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 39 of 85 PageID #: 179\n   \n   \n150.  Soon thereafter, Logan began engaging in self harm, and, in October 2018, DCS \nplaced Logan in a private secure facility with locked units in northern Indiana. Logan remains \nthere today. \n151.  Logan has sickle cell anemia. In September 2018, he was also diagnosed with Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder, \nBipolar I Disorder, and Reactive Attachment Disorder.  \n152.  Logan has been engaged in mental health therapy during much of his time in foster \ncare to address his many changes in placements, feelings of loss and rejection, and coping skills. \nHowever, providers have noted that Logan will likely make little progress in addressing his \nattachment issues until he is in a permanent placement. \n153.  Therapy has also revealed that Logan has received minimal hugging and tactile \ninput through much of his life. This is consistent with sensory processing and sensory-motor areas \nof deficit, difficulty with emotional and behavioral regulation, fight/flight/freeze responses to \nstress and anxiety and difficulty with self-soothing skills. While in foster care, Logan received \nservices with an occupational therapist, but those were discontinued due to challenges with \npayment for services. \n154.  Although the court legally freed Logan for adoption in 2013, DCS has left Logan a \nlegal orphan for much of his childhood. Logan longs to be permanently placed in a home and wants \na family who will love him and not hurt him. Logan has a history of rejection from his mother and \nhis prospective adoptive parents, which could have been avoided had DCS engaged in appropriate \nplacement matching and given Logan necessary supports.  \n155.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Logan has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \n  39 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 40 of 85 PageID #: 180\n   \n   \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Logan’s case, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented years of \nadditional trauma he has suffered while in the custody of DCS. Moreover, if Defendants had \nprovided Logan with sufficient and reasonable services, he may have been able to remain in a less \nrestrictive, non-institutional setting.  \nE.  Sara O. \n156.  Sara O. is 14 years old. She first entered foster care in Indiana when she was seven \nyears old.  \n157.  When Sara was approximately three years old, her mother and father divorced and \nher mother moved to the east coast and left Sara with her father. Upon information and belief, soon \nthereafter, Sara’s father began sexually abusing her. Upon information and belief, on February 16, \n2012, when Sara was seven years old, DCS received a report of the abuse, opened an investigation, \nand removed Sara from the home. Upon information and belief, DCS filed a CHINS petition \nagainst Sara’s father, and Sara was placed in court-ordered out-of-home placement with her \npaternal grandmother. \n158.  Sara lived with her grandmother for approximately one year and was then moved \nto a non-kinship foster home. It is unknown whether the court entered a CHINS finding against \nSara’s father or criminal charges were brought against him. \n159.  In October 2013, when Sara was nine years old, DCS reunited Sara with her father. \nUpon information and belief, he began sexually abusing Sara again. In May 2014,  DCS removed \nher from her father a second time after Sara called 911 to report the sexual abuse she was suffering. \n  40 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 41 of 85 PageID #: 181\n   \n   \nThe court ordered out-of-home placement for Sara. Upon information and belief, in at least one \nfoster home Sara began to display sexually maladaptive behavior towards other children.  \n160.  During the following years, upon information and belief, Sara cycled through \nnumerous non-kinship foster homes. Upon information and belief, DCS failed to arrange timely \nand  appropriate  services  for  Sara  in  each  of  these  placements,  further  failing  this  already \ntraumatized child.  \n161.  In the summer of 2015, DCS placed Sara with her Next Friend, Holly Carrow, on \nan emergency basis until a bed opened up at a residential facility. Upon information and belief, \nSara was terrified to go into the bathroom at Ms. Carrow’s home due to the abuse she suffered in \nher father’s home. Upon information and belief, at the time, DCS was working towards a plan of \nreunifying Sara with her father.  \n162.  Upon information and belief, Sara experienced at least two acute hospital stays. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  she  was  placed  at  a  private  for-profit  residential  facility  for \napproximately one year. Upon information and belief, in approximately 2015, DCS transferred \nSara to a residential private behavioral healthcare facility. Upon information and belief, at this \nfacility Sara would bang her head on the wall to the point of bleeding. \n163.  On March 22, 2016, Sara was placed in a state psychiatric hospital in Indianapolis. \nShe remained there until March 2019. Sara was initially admitted to this hospital because she was \ndisplaying aggressive, destructive, and inappropriate sexual behaviors.  \n164.  Upon information and belief, in September 2018, Sara’s treatment team at the \npsychiatric hospital determined that Sara had reached her maximum treatment benefit and was \nready to be discharged to a less restrictive setting. Upon information and belief, Sara’s FCM sought \npermission to move Sara to a less restrictive residential setting, but did not receive approval to do \n  41 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 42 of 85 PageID #: 182\n   \n   \nso despite three separate requests. Upon information and belief, Sara’s FCM’s requests to transfer \nSara to a less restrictive setting were rejected because Sara is pre-adoptive and DCS wanted to \nwait until a pre-adoptive foster home became available for her. As such, DCS forced Sara to \nunnecessarily remain in a psychiatric hospital, a traumatizing experience for anyone, especially a \nneglected and abused child.  \n165.  Upon information and belief, in March 2019, DCS finally agreed to move Sara to \na group home. DCS moved Sara abruptly, with only one day’s notice, to a group home north of \nIndianapolis. Upon information and belief, staff at the psychiatric hospital had advocated that it \nwas important for DCS to implement a therapeutic transition plan when moving Sara to the group \nhome, given her fragile mental health. However, this recommendation was ignored.  \n166.  Upon information and belief, within a few weeks of moving to the group home, \nSara required emergency psychiatric hospitalization and DCS transferred her to the psychiatric \nunit of a hospital in Indianapolis. After an acute stay, on March 28, 2019, DCS placed Sara in a \nprivate secure facility in northwestern Indiana.  \n167.  Sara is diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, Child Sex Abuse, and Enuresis.  \n168.  In total, Sara has been in at least 17 different placements since becoming a ward of \nDCS.  \n169.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Sara has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Sara’s case, and not acted \nwith deliberate indifference to her legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented further abuse \n  42 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 43 of 85 PageID #: 183\n   \n   \nat the hands of her father as well as years of additional trauma Sara has suffered while in the \ncustody of DCS. Moreover, if Defendants had provided Sara with sufficient and reasonable \nservices, she may have been able to remain in a less restrictive, non-institutional setting.  \nF.  Desmond C. \n170.  Desmond has been in court-ordered out-of-home placement under the custody of \nDCS for seven years. Desmond is 16 years old and currently residing, at the decision of DCS, on \nthe adult wing of a long-term care nursing home facility. \n171.  Desmond was born on May 14, 2003 and has a twin brother and younger sister. \nDesmond has limited verbal skills and requires a wheelchair. Desmond is diagnosed with autism \nspectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and dysphasia. Desmond also suffers \nseizures.  \n172.  On September 6, 2012, Desmond’s home caught fire after a methamphetamine lab \nDesmond’s parents were operating exploded. Desmond and his siblings were inside the home, \nsleeping on the living room floor, at the time of the explosion. Firefighters and law enforcement \nresponded to the scene. During their investigation, local law enforcement officers discovered drug \nparaphernalia throughout the home. DCS’s Central Intake Unit received a report alleging Desmond \nand his siblings were the victims of neglect, and DCS opened an investigation and immediately \ntook custody of the children. Desmond and his siblings were transported to the hospital for a \nroutine medical evaluation. \n173.  Desmond’s  mother  and  father  were  arrested  and  charged  with  Dealing  in \nMethamphetamine, Possession of Methamphetamine, and three counts of Neglect of a Dependent, \nalong with other related charges. They both pleaded guilty to Possession of Methamphetamine and \nthree counts of Neglect of a Dependent. On October 16, 2013, Desmond’s father was sentenced to \n  43 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 44 of 85 PageID #: 184\n   \n   \n10 years in prison with a period of four years’ probation following his release. On February 28, \n2013, Desmond’s mother was sentenced to four years in prison with two years’ probation, which \nshe later violated by again using drugs.  \n174.  Desmond’s family was known to DCS prior to the September 2012 fire. On \nFebruary 8, 2010, DCS substantiated allegations that Desmond’s parents medically neglected him \nand his twin brother. The boys both have cerebral palsy, but the parents had failed to get them any \nmedical treatment for two years. That same month, Desmond’s parents entered into an Informal \nAdjustment agreement with DCS. On April 27, 2012, just months before the explosion, DCS \nunsubstantiated  a  report  that  Desmond’s  parents  were  abusing  and  manufacturing \nmethamphetamines inside their home. At that time, Desmond’s parents refused to submit to drug \nscreens.  A  few  months  later,  on  August  16,  2012,  DCS  unsubstantiated  an  allegation  that \nDesmond’s sister was found a few blocks away from the home without an adult present. On \nSeptember 1, 2012, five days before the explosion, DCS began investigating a report that Desmond \nwas found alone in the street. His parents agreed to a safety plan and to again enter into an Informal \nAdjustment. \n175.  Pursuant to DCS policy, DCS will initiate a program of Informal Adjustment when \na child neglect allegation is substantiated, the voluntary participation of the family in services is \nthe most appropriate course of action to protect the well-being of the children, the parents consent \nto the Informal Adjustment, and the court approves the Informal Adjustment. See DCS Policy, Ch. \n5, § 9, Version 8 (Mar. 1, 2019). Here, it is clear DCS failed to properly assess whether an Informal \nAdjustment was the most appropriate course of action given the evidence of drug use throughout \nthe home. Moreover, as part of an Informal Adjustment, FCMs are required to develop a safety \n  44 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 45 of 85 PageID #: 185\n   \n   \nplan, which an FCM supervisor must approve, to ensure the children are safe. See id. FCMs must \nalso monitor the family’s progress. See id. \n176.  When DCS interviewed Desmond’s mother in connection with the September 6, \n2012 incident, she admitted that she had been abusing methamphetamine for the past ten years. \n177.  Following  Desmond’s  removal,  the  court  entered  a  CHINS  finding  against \nDesmond’s parents and later terminated their parental rights as to all three children. Today, \nDesmond’s parents have no contact with him. \n178.  When DCS removed the children in September 2012, DCS initially placed them \ntogether in a non-kinship foster home. Upon information and belief, the foster home was not a \ntherapeutic foster home, and DCS failed to inform the foster parents of Desmond’s disabilities, \nonly telling them that Desmond required a wheelchair for traveling long-distances.  \n179.  DCS did not tell the foster parents that Desmond was non-verbal, incontinent \n(requiring a diaper), or that he needed a wheelchair anytime he left the house. Upon information \nand belief, DCS provided no assistance in arranging transportation for Desmond to and from \nschool. In addition, upon information and belief, the foster parents were forced to take it upon \nthemselves to reach out to Desmond’s prior school to determine what accommodations he required \nat his new school. Upon information and belief, they also spoke with his past teachers to find out \nDesmond’s history—they needed to know how to meet his basic needs.  \n180.  Notably, pursuant to DCS policy, DCS is charged with obtaining education records \nfor children in out-of-home care and reviewing them to determine whether an Individualized \nEducation Program is required and to develop a plan to ensure children’s educational needs are \nmet. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 20, Version 9 (July 1, 2108); Ch. 8, § 21, Version 4 (July 1, 2108). \nUpon information and belief, DCS failed to do this for Desmond.  \n  45 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 46 of 85 PageID #: 186\n   \n   \n181.  Upon information and belief, Desmond was moved to a new foster home after a \nweek because his first placement was unable to meet his needs, especially without assistance from \nDCS. Upon information and belief, Desmond’s siblings were later split up into two separate foster \nhomes. \n182.  Upon information and belief, Desmond lived at his second foster home, the home \nof his Next Friend, Mr. Foreman, for approximately four-and-a-half years. Upon information and \nbelief, DCS again failed to provide the Foremans with his complete medical history and refused \nto assist in transporting Desmond to his medical appointments, many of which were several hours \naway. Upon information and belief, Desmond underwent five surgeries in Indianapolis while he \nlived in this foster home, one of which resulted in his legs being placed in full casts for several \nweeks. Upon information and belief, DCS failed to monitor or check in on Desmond while he was \nhospitalized for his surgeries.  \n183.  DCS failed to support Desmond in other ways as well. Upon information and belief, \nDCS failed to ensure visits with Desmond’s parents were properly supervised, failed to ensure \nDesmond’s educational needs were met, and failed to ensure necessary accommodations were \nmade so Desmond could remain in his foster home. For example, upon information and belief, the \nForemans repeatedly asked DCS to have a wheelchair lift installed in their home, but DCS refused \nto do so. As Desmond grew older, it became increasingly difficult for his foster parents to lift him \nin and out of his wheelchair.  \n184.  Upon information and belief, at one point Desmond’s FCM went on leave, and no \none at DCS would approve services for Desmond during the several months she was gone. \nMoreover, upon information and belief, DCS failed to obtain a timely psychological evaluation or \narrange independent living skills training for Desmond.  \n  46 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 47 of 85 PageID #: 187\n   \n   \n185.  Upon information and belief, Desmond’s foster parents, who were left without \nsupport from DCS, were forced to put in their notice, seeking to have Desmond moved from their \nhome. In response, DCS, upon information and belief, sent out a referral stating that Desmond \nrequired a higher than necessary level of care.  \n186.  As a result, two years ago, on March 17, 2017, DCS placed Desmond at a nursing \nfacility—on the adult wing. This is in violation of DCS’s policy that children be placed in the least \nrestrictive environment available to provide for their individual needs. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 1, \nVersion 10 (Jan. 1, 2019). Moreover, under DCS policy, institutional placements are only to be \nused when there are “extenuating circumstances documented that prevent the child from being \nplaced in the least restrictive, most family-like setting.” DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 4, Version 3 (Dec. \n1, 2013). \n187.  Though Desmond’s disabilities require well-coordinated and supportive care, upon \ninformation and belief, one of Desmond’s service providers experienced a six to eight month delay \nwhen initiating his services due to DCS. Additionally, upon information and belief, Desmond, who \nwas previously attending school full-time, is now only on a half-day school schedule. \n188.  Upon information and belief, Desmond has minimal, if any, contact with his sister. \nUpon information and belief, Desmond’s twin brother visits him but without DCS’s assistance or \ncoordination. Indeed, upon information and belief, during the pendency of Desmond’s CHINS \ncase, DCS has done little to ensure Desmond and his siblings maintain contact with one another.  \n189.  This is yet another violation of DCS policy, which clearly states that sibling \nvisitation should be promoted for children in foster care. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 12, Version 6 \n(July 1, 2017).  Indeed, visitation plans are to include face-to-face contact with siblings at least \nonce  per  week.  See  id.  Maintaining  sibling  contact  is  critical,  because,  as  DCS  policy \n  47 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 48 of 85 PageID #: 188\n   \n   \nacknowledges, “[t]he longest lasting relationship a child shares is often with his or her sibling. . . . \n[T]he ability to maintain contact with each other can help alleviate the emotional impact of removal \nfor each child.” Id. \n190.  Upon information and belief, DCS is attempting to identify an adoptive family for \nDesmond but has failed to do so thus far, leaving him to unnecessarily languish in an inappropriate, \noverly restrictive institutional setting. Desmond spends most of his time with elderly adults or \nadults with developmental disabilities that require a high level of care. He spends very little time, \nif any, with other children or anyone who does not have a disability, with the exception of his \nservice providers.  \n191.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Desmond has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Desmond’s case, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, they may well have prevented years of \nadditional trauma he has suffered while in the custody of DCS. Moreover, if Defendants had \nprovided Desmond with sufficient and reasonable services, he may have been able to remain in a \nless restrictive, non-institutional setting. \nG.  Braxton F. \n192.  Braxton, 15 years old, has been a ward of DCS since he was six. Braxton is \ncurrently in court-ordered out-of-home placement in a private secure facility located in eastern \nIndiana.  \n193.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Braxton  was  born  in  Illinois,  and  the  Illinois \nDepartment of Children and Family Services may have been involved with his family when he \n  48 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 49 of 85 PageID #: 189\n   \n   \nwas  a  toddler.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Braxton’s  parents  had  a  history  of  abusing \nmethamphetamine. Either through a private placement or through Illinois DCFS, Braxton was \nplaced with his uncle in Vermillion County, Indiana.  \n194.  On or about June 7, 2011, the Indiana State Police and Vermillion County Sheriff’s \nOffice served a drug-related arrest warrant on Braxton’s uncle. The police called the DCS hotline \nwhen they discovered that six-year-old Braxton was residing in the home. Witnesses reported that \nthe uncle regularly subjected Braxton to severe, physical abuse and a detailed description of the \nabuse from multiple witnesses was documented within his uncle’s criminal charging instrument. \nFurther, his uncle also allegedly regularly, withheld Braxton’s attention deficit/hyperactivity \ndisorder medication.  \n195.  Upon information and belief, DCS removed Braxton from his uncle’s home and \nplaced him in a foster home. Upon information and belief, DCS initiated a CHINS proceeding on \nbehalf of Braxton.  \n196.  Braxton’s uncle was arrested on charges of neglect of a dependent resulting in \nbodily injury and battery resulting in serious bodily injury, both class C felony charges. He was \nalso charged with felony drug-related charges in a separate case. On April 11, 2012, the uncle \nentered a guilty plea to charges of dealing in a schedule II controlled substance, a class B felony, \nand dealing in a schedule IV controlled substance, a class C felony. The criminal child abuse \ncharges were dismissed. Under the plea agreement, the uncle was to receive 10- and two-year \nsentences, respectively, with five years of home detention as a condition of probation. Upon \ninformation and belief, the uncle served less than a year in prison.  \n197.  Notably, the same attorney that represented his uncle in the child abuse criminal \ncase was also assigned to be Braxton’s GAL. \n  49 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 50 of 85 PageID #: 190\n   \n   \n198.  Upon information and belief, in 2012, DCS terminated Braxton’s parents’ parental \nrights after obtaining a voluntary surrender. \n199.  In the nine  years  following his  removal, Braxton  has experienced placement \ninstability while in DCS custody. Between June 2011 and October 2013, Braxton was in three \ndifferent foster placements, most of which, upon information and belief, were kinship placements. \nUpon information and belief, one of these placements was with Braxton’s grandmother, who lived \nin Illinois and was allowing Braxton’s parents unsupervised visits with Braxton, in violation \nDCS’s safety plan. \n200.  Upon information and belief, at some point, DCS moved Braxton to a private secure \nfacility in Indianapolis. \n201.  On April 4, 2016, when he was only 12 years old, DCS moved Braxton to a private \nsecure facility in eastern Indiana. He remains there today. Upon information and belief, Braxton \nis largely confined to the facility, and lacks access to age appropriate activities. Upon information \nand belief, Braxton has not had access to a community school setting for at least five years but \ninstead has been educated within the confines of a secured facility.  Additionally, upon information \nand belief, this facility was required to submit multiple plans of correction as a result of a DCS \nclinical and contract review.  \n202.  Upon information and belief, DCS has assigned multiple FCMs to Braxton’s case. \nUpon information and belief, while Braxton’s FCM may visit with him every month, as required \nby DCS policy, such visits do not appear to be beneficial to his case planning and permanency \nneeds. Upon information and belief, Braxton does not require a residential setting as restrictive as \nhis current placement, but DCS has failed to identify an appropriate placement for him.  \n  50 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 51 of 85 PageID #: 191\n   \n   \n203.  Moreover,  DCS  has  failed  to  formulate  an  appropriate  permanency  plan  for \nBraxton. Upon information and belief, at one point, DCS planned to move Braxton to his \ngrandmother’s home. But, upon information and belief, it took over a year to complete the \nInterstate Compact on the Placement of Children, and, during that time, the grandmother was \ndiagnosed with a terminal illness and later passed away. Upon information and belief, DCS has \nfailed to develop an alternative permanency plan for Braxton. \n204.  Upon information and belief, Braxton’s current FCM contacted Braxton’s parents \nto try to reestablish contact and determine whether they could be a permanent resource for \nBraxton—even though DCS terminated their rights years ago. Upon information and belief, \nBraxton’s parents are not following up on DCS’s outreach efforts.  \n205.  Upon information and belief, Braxton has several mental illness diagnoses, as well \nas a mild intellectual disability. Upon information and belief, DCS has failed to provide adequate \nmedical care to address Braxton’s needs nor properly address his past trauma, which is likely \ncreating a barrier to placement in a less restrictive setting. DCS has failed to arrange necessary, \ntimely, and appropriate services for Braxton. \n206.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Braxton has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable  professional  judgments  and  engaged  in  reasonable  case  planning  and  placement \nmatching and not acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Braxton’s \ncase and not acted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, they may well have prevented \nyears of additional trauma he has suffered while in the custody of DCS. Moreover, if Defendants \nhad provided Braxton with sufficient and reasonable services, he may have been able to remain in \na less restrictive, non-institutional setting.   \n  51 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 52 of 85 PageID #: 192\n   \n   \nIII.  DCS’S SYSTEMIC FAILURES AND RESULTING HARM TO CHILDREN. \nA.  Director Bonaventura’s Resignation.  \n207.  Indiana is in dire need of an effective child welfare system.  The state is plagued by \nhigh rates of child abuse and neglect, with the third highest rate of general child maltreatment in \nthe country. It also has the fourth highest number of children in foster care in the nation. Notably, \nthe child abuse and neglect rate in Indiana has nearly doubled over the past decade. In 2017, \nIndiana had a child abuse and neglect rate of 20.8 per 1,000 children compared to only 11.9 per \n1,000 children in 2007. Without a doubt, DCS has proven incapable of ensuring the safety and \nwell-being of the Hoosier youth.  \n208.  Former DCS Director Bonaventura highlighted the systemic issues with Indiana’s \nchild welfare system in her December 12, 2017 letter of resignation to Defendant Governor Eric \nHolcomb.  \n209.  Director Bonaventura noted that the years before her appointment “were marked \nwith conflict and strife between DCS and the provider community, including foster parents . . . .” \nLetter from Mary Beth Bonaventura, Dir. DCS, to Eric Holcomb, IN Gov. (Dec. 12, 2017). \n210.  According to Director Bonaventura, DCS distorted its data regarding staffing levels \nprior to 2013, “manipulat[ing]” the “officially reported staffing numbers . . . to the point that they \nwere nothing more than pure fantasy.” Id. \n211.  Director Bonaventura attempted to remedy DCS’s internal failures. However, \nDefendant Holcomb’s staff “cut funding and services to children in the midst of the opioid crisis,” \nthus threatening the safety, permanency and well-being of children in foster care. Id. Moreover, \naccording to Director Bonaventura, Defendant Holcomb undertook “efforts to reduce or cap” FCM \nand DCS attorney staffing, and made no attempt to collaborate with the provider community in \nsetting rates and forming licensing rules. Id. Therefore, Director Bonaventura wrote, she felt she \n  52 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 53 of 85 PageID #: 193\n   \n   \nwas compelled to resign, because “Hoosier children [were] being systematically placed at risk…” \nId. \nB.  The CWG Report. \n212.  The June 18, 2019 CWG report that followed Director Bonaventura’s resignation \nfound serious, systemic deficiencies within DCS. Among other things, CWG’s report noted DCS’s \nhigh removal rates; poor data collection system; uneven workloads that, at times, far exceed \nnational caseload standards; highly centralized management that causes unnecessary delay in \nservices;  uneven  interpretation  and  implementation  of  DCS  policies  across  counties;  and \ninexperienced attorneys with high turnover rates. See CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department \nof Child Services (June 18, 2018). The CWG Report revealed that, for years, Defendants have \nproven ill-prepared and incapable of appropriately handling  reports of suspected child abuse and \nneglect.  \n213.  CWG made 17 recommendations to address DCS’s most significant challenges, \nwhich included, but were not limited to: reclaiming a family-centered practice model, which \nrequires understanding “the harmful effects of child removal and disrupted attachment for children \nas a counterbalance in considering whether removal is the safest course of action”; establishing \ncaseload  standards  of  no  more  than  17  families  for  in-home  services  and  15  children  for \nout-of-home cases; creating a small unit of data professionals to analyze the data DCS collects; \nstrengthening DCS’s quality assurance capacity; reducing the supervisor-to-caseworker ratio to \none supervisor for every five FCMs; addressing the culture of fear within DCS; developing a \nstrategy for recruiting, training, and retaining staff; decentralizing decision-making within DCS; \nassessing counties where CHINS cases remain open for lengthy periods of time; using a Medicaid \n  53 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 54 of 85 PageID #: 194\n   \n   \nexpert to assist DCS in maximizing the use of Medicaid for services; resolving attorney turnover \nissues; and forming better partnerships with the provider community. Id. \n214.  Defendants have been long aware of these shortcomings of Indiana’s child welfare \nsystem, but they have failed to act in a meaningful way to address the noted deficiencies.  As the \nCWG noted, “in five years, external evaluators have prepared five evaluation reports about DCS, \nrequiring much time on behalf of evaluators and DCS staff and leadership” but “[a] large number \nof these recommendations have not yet been implemented.” Id. \nC.  DCS’s Deficient Federal Audit Results. \n215.  Federal  audits  have  consistently  revealed  flaws  with  Indiana’s  child  welfare \nsystem. Since the early 2000s, the Children’s Bureau of the United States Department of Health \nand Human Services has conducted audits of each state’s child welfare system.  These audits are \ncalled Child and Family Service Reviews (“CFSR”). As part of each CFSR, the Children’s Bureau \nconducts a review of 65 randomly-chosen cases in each state. Indiana has been evaluated three \ntimes through the CFSR process—in 2002, 2008 and 2016.  \n216.  The CFSR evaluates seven “outcomes” of the safety, well-being and permanency \nof children in foster care, which are considered the three objectives of all child welfare systems \npursuant to federal statutory law. The CFSR also reports on seven “systemic factors,” which are \npractices and structures that affect the delivery of foster care services. Taken together, these \nmetrics provide a comprehensive analysis tool for each state by identifying areas of weakness with \nthe goal of then implementing corrective actions to improve outcomes for children.   \n217.  Unfortunately, outcomes for Indiana’s children have not improved since the CFSR \nprocess was initiated.  In fact, Indiana’s performance has worsened in each subsequent CFSR.   \n  54 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 55 of 85 PageID #: 195\n   \n   \n218.  Indiana received its worst CFSR  in 2016,  failing to achieve any of the “outcomes” \nrelating to the permanency, safety, and well-being of children in care. During that year, Indiana \nwas in substantial conformity with just one of the seven systemic factors. See U.S. DEP’T OF \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVS., ADMIN. FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES, INDIANA FINAL REPORT (2016). \n219.  In the area of safety, the Children’s Bureau decided that “children are, first and \nforemost, protected from abuse and neglect” in only 35 percent of the cases reviewed. Id.  The \nChildren’s Bureau determined that just 30 percent of the children had “permanency and stability \nin their living situations.” Id. Indiana DCS is also struggling to provide for the well-being of \nchildren in its care; the Children’s Bureau determined that families have “enhanced capacity to \nprovide for children’s needs” in just 33 percent of the foster care cases that were reviewed. Id.  \n220.  Indiana  has  struggled  with  many  of  the  CFSR’s  systemic  factors,  which  are \nmeasures of how the child welfare structure functions. Indiana did not achieve “conformity” on \nthe CFSR for its Case Review System, which includes items such as case plans, permanency \nhearings  and  termination  of  parental  rights  proceedings.  Id.  Indiana’s  own  internal  quality \nassurance review revealed that DCS often fails to develop written case plans in conjunction with \nparents. See id. The Children’s Bureau’s review also revealed that timely filing of termination of \nparental rights petitions are an “area of challenge” in the state. Id. \n221.  The 2016 CFSR also rated Indiana as deficient in “Service Array and Resource \nDevelopment,” as it lacked qualified service providers in a variety of areas, such as substance \nabuse, mental health, domestic violence and services to mentor youth. Id. Further, the 2016 CFSR \nfound that Indiana needed improvement on the diligent recruitment of foster and adoptive homes. \nSee id. \n  55 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 56 of 85 PageID #: 196\n   \n   \nD.  Inadequate Assessments and Responses to Reports of Child Abuse and \nNeglect. \n \n222.  Indiana has the third highest rate of child maltreatment in the country. According \nto  the  Children’s  Bureau  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  “Child \nMaltreatment” report, Indiana had 29,198 child victims in 2017—a 34.2 percent increase from \n2013. This represents a rate of 18.6 victims per 1,000 children—more than double the national \naverage.  \n223.  Indiana has the highest rate of court-involved maltreatment victims of any state of \nthe 41 states reporting. In 2016, over 72 percent of Hoosier child victims had court cases, compared \nwith a national average of 29 percent. In Indiana, cases are either adjudicated as a CHINS or \nInformal Adjustment. The degree to which Indiana courts monitor Informal Adjustments depends \non the local judge, with some simply signing off on the Informal Adjustment authorization. Unlike \nother jurisdictions, DCS does not appear to enter into voluntary out-of-court agreements to provide \nservices to families, likely resulting in the state’s high rate of court involvement. \n224.  The CWG Report noted a sharp increase in the number of children in out-of-home \ncare in Indiana. From September 2005 to September 2017, DCS reported that the number of \nchildren in out-of-home care almost doubled, from 10,767 to 20,394 children. Additionally, as of \n2017, Indiana’s rate of children in out-of-home care was approximately twice the national average, \nat 13 children for every 1,000 in the state. Meanwhile, three of Indiana’s neighboring states \n(Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio) experienced decreases in the number of children in out-of-home \ncare during the same period of time.  \n225.  After the release of the CWG Report, DCS tried to reduce the number of children \nin care, appearing to focus more on the numbers than on providing meaningful services. From \nDecember 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, DCS reduced the number of open CHINS cases from \n  56 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 57 of 85 PageID #: 197\n   \n   \n28,502 to 23,908, a decrease of 16 percent in just one year. On December 31, 2018, DCS reported \nhaving 14,789 children in out-of-home placements, which is 1,618 fewer children than in May \n2018 and quadruple the decline over the same period in 2017. But inappropriately screening out, \nentering into Informal Adjustments rather than filing CHINS petitions, or hurriedly closing cases \nplaces children in danger of remaining in or being returned to potentially unsafe homes.   \n226.  The large number of out-of-home placements is understandable in the context of \nDCS’s involuntary removal policy, which applies when DCS “will remove a child from his or her \nparent, guardian, or custodian.” DCS Policy, Ch. 4, § 28, Version 7 (July 1, 2018). Notably, the \ngrounds  warranting  an  involuntary  removal  under  DCS  policy  closely  mimic  the  statutory \nlanguage for finding a CHINS. CWG concluded that DCS’s policy “seems to encourage removal \nover consideration of other options that might  protect  the child while avoiding the trauma \nassociated with his or her placement outside of the family.” CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (June 18, 2018).  \n227.  While DCS often removes children inappropriately, the agency also fails to remove \nchildren and make effective safety plans when necessary. CWG’s analysis revealed that FCMs \nwould develop safety plans with substance-abusing parents and caregivers in which the parents \nwould merely promise to refrain from using drugs in the presence of their children. Several of \nthese cases involved young children and parents or other adults in the homes who were actively \nabusing opiates and methamphetamine. This is unsound safety planning, especially when parental \n“use of substances may well be beyond their control.” See CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (June 18, 2018).  \n  57 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 58 of 85 PageID #: 198\n   \n   \n228.  Defendants’ failures to adequately assess and respond to allegations of child abuse \nand neglect substantially depart from widely-accepted professional standards and demonstrate a \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nE.  Inadequate Child Placement Array. \n229.  Indiana lacks a sufficient placement array, i.e., the types of residential settings or \nhomes into which DCS may place a foster child,  all too often leaving children in inappropriate \nand dangerous environments.  \n230.  DCS not only has the authority to place children in residential, institutional settings, \nit also licenses those same facilities and is responsible for ensuring that minimum standards are \nmet. DCS issues licenses for (a) child care institutions (which have a capacity of over 10 youth for \nstays over 60 days); (b) emergency shelter care services (which must not exceed stays of 60 days); \n(c) private secure facilities  (which are locked units within an institution designed to serve children \nwho are determined to be “gravely disabled” with a capacity of over 10 youth for stays over 60 \ndays); (d) group homes (which house a maximum of 10 youth for over 60 days); (e) emergency \nshelter care group homes (that provide emergency shelter care services for less than 60 days); and \n(f) licensed child placing agencies (which license and monitor some foster homes).  DCS also \nlicenses a portion of Indiana’s foster homes.  \n231.  In addition to licensing, Indiana also contracts with private providers for residential \nservices  for  children  in  foster  care,  congregate  care,  or  treatment,  including  psychiatric \nhospitalization. \n232.  Instead  of  providing  children  with  disabilities  with  access  to  in-home  or \ncommunity-based support services, DCS often places these children—and specifically those with \ndevelopmental disabilities or significant mental illness—in residential, institutional facilities. \n  58 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 59 of 85 PageID #: 199\n   \n   \nInstead of exploring another appropriate, less restrictive community placement, these children are \noften needlessly and inappropriately housed in highly restrictive institutional settings. These \nunnecessary  institutional  placements  create  another  significant  barrier  for  the  children’s \npermanency plan and violate the children’s right to receive services in the community. \n233.  DCS  has  also  failed  to  provide  children  with  appropriate  services  and \naccommodations  within  residential  settings  or  has  failed  to  ensure  residential  treatment  is \nappropriate for the individual child, thus subjecting children to prolonged institutionalization and \ninappropriate placements.  \n234.  Upon information and belief, while the high percentage of youth in kinship (or \nrelative) care appears laudable, many of these kinship placements are unlicensed foster homes and \nsome are beyond the realm of ordinary fictive kin (i.e., a person who knows the child but is not \nrelated by blood, such as a godparent). Upon information and belief, DCS exercises less scrutiny \nover unlicensed relative homes. Additionally, upon information and belief, DCS at times has \ninappropriately placed children in the homes of their service providers and DCS employees, \nclassifying these homes as “kinship” placements.  \nF.  Overreliance on Institutional Placements. \n235.  Rather than correcting the licensure issues causing the shortage in residential \nplacements, DCS relies upon child caring institutions to house children for extended periods of \ntime. DCS fails to take proactive steps to move children out of institutional care even after the \nchild has met the maximum therapeutic value of the facility or in instances where the placement \nis not appropriate or therapeutic for the child.  \n236.  In June 2018, Indiana had 128 active residential treatment licenses, which included \nchild caring institutions, private secure facilities, and group homes. Upon information and belief, \n  59 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 60 of 85 PageID #: 200\n   \n   \napproximately nine are run by DCS county offices, 25 percent are private for-profit facilities, and \nthe remainder are private non-profit facilities. CWG found that Indiana still has a “gap in \nresources” for children who require placement at a level higher than a foster home but lower than \na residential treatment center, such as a therapeutic foster home. CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (June 18, 2018). \n237.  Often, by the time children enter residential care, they have already experienced \nmultiple placements, including kinship and non-kinship foster homes, and perhaps emergency \nshelter care placements. When youth have multiple placements, they are more likely to have \ndifficulty stabilizing. \n238.  There are a number of large child caring institutions and private secure facilities in \nIndiana. Notably, most of these accept youth from both DCS (CHINS) and probation. In fact, \nDCS’s Juvenile Justice Program makes “all services within the DCS service array” available to \nthe county probation departments for juvenile delinquencies, including placement in residential \ntreatment facilities, group homes, and foster care. Letter from Terry Stigdon, Dir. DCS, to Jason \nDudich, Dir. State Budget Agency (Aug. 20, 2018). The CWG Report stated that DCS’s practice \nof placing CHINS and probation youth together occurs throughout Indiana, “which is counter to \nrequirements that they be placed separately.” See CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department of \nChild Services (June 18, 2018). \n239.  Title IV-E of the Social Security Act provides federal matching funds to help states, \nincluding Indiana, pay for foster care placements for children who meet certain eligibility criteria. \nIn Indiana, DCS is responsible for administering the state’s Title IV-E funds, for which both child \nwelfare and juvenile delinquency services are eligible. But facilities do not qualify for funding if \nthey are “detention facilities . . . or other facilities operated primarily for the detention of children \n  60 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 61 of 85 PageID #: 201\n   \n   \ndetermined to be delinquent.” National Juvenile Justice Network, Title IV-E for Youth in the \nJuvenile  Justice  System,  njjn.org,  http://www.njjn.org/uploads/digital-library/resource_425.pdf \n(last visited June 20, 2019). Concerningly, upon information and belief, some DCS-licensed \nresidential facilities house more youth sent via probation than CHINS. \n240.  DCS has failed to take sufficient steps to ensure that children with disabilities in \nthe foster care system have access to medical and mental health and requisite support services to \nallow them to remain in the least-restrictive, most family-like setting. Instead, children with \ndisabilities are unnecessarily placed in segregated institutional treatment facilities for extended \nperiods of time, and DCS has failed to take proactive steps to integrate these children back into the \ncommunity or ensure that they are placed in healthy, therapeutic environments that can support \ntheir needs. \n241.  Further, children with disabilities that are placed by DCS within child caring \ninstitutions may be subjected to substandard care and treatment, excessive physical restraints, an \ninstitutional environment, and limited community access. The providers are allowed to continue \nthese improper practices, thus causing further traumatization, as DCS is the placement agency, \nfunding source, and is responsible for licensing and overseeing the conditions and practices. This \nconflict of interest means that DCS has little incentive to improve the conditions as they are reliant \nupon these institutions for bed availability for children that are challenging to place.  \n242.  Children living in the residential settings have little to no autonomy over their daily \nlives. Their activities of daily living and standards for whether they have complied with treatment, \nand are thus eligible for a less restrictive setting, are restricted and limited by inflexible rules and \npolicies. Children in residential settings are subjected to blanket rights restrictions that are not \ntailored to individual needs, structured meal times, limited visitation without outside adults or \n  61 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 62 of 85 PageID #: 202\n   \n   \nproviders present, and restricted movement to any other location besides the facility, including \naccess to a community-based school. As a result, all aspects of their daily lives are controlled by \nthe residential provider, and they have very few, if any, meaningful opportunities to participate in \nor access the community.  \n243.  These  residential  settings  also  provide  little  opportunity  for  children  with \ndisabilities to interact with individuals without disabilities, apart from staff and case workers that \nmay do in-person visits, and they are subjected to the same conditions and restrictions as children \nthat are placed for disciplinary reasons through the juvenile justice system. \n244.  The  types  of  services  needed  to  support  children  with  disabilities  in \ncommunity-based settings already exist in DCS’s service system. However, these services are not \nimplemented in a consistent or timely manner, nor are they sufficiently provided to meet the needs \nof children who are unnecessarily institutionalized or those at serious risk of institutionalization. \nWith reasonable modifications, including expansion of the capacity to provide existing services, \nreallocation of funds from institutions to community integration services, and additional training \nand support to FCMs working with children with disabilities, Indiana would be able to meet the \nneeds of children with disabilities or significant behavioral needs in a less restrictive environment \nthan institutionalization. \n245.  These failures in Indiana’s use of residential placements substantially depart from \nwidely-accepted professional standards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the risk of \nharm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \n  62 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 63 of 85 PageID #: 203\n   \n   \nG.  Foster Home Shortage. \n246.  Indiana has also  failed to recruit and retain an adequate number and range of foster \nparents. Indeed, over the past few years, media outlets have reported a dire shortage of foster \nhomes in Indiana.   \n247.  DCS is responsible for licensing all foster homes, and licenses are issued for \nfour-year periods. Both DCS and the licensed child placing agencies find foster homes for children \nand manage and train foster families. Licensed child placing agencies also train foster parents for \nfoster children with disabilities and therapeutic foster home licenses. \n248.  In Indiana, the timeframes for attaining foster home licensures vary by region. \nMany regions suffer from lengthy administrative delays. One county allegedly told foster parents \nit takes a year because they lack sufficient staff to process the licenses.  \n249.  As a result of Indiana’s foster home shortage, DCS often has nowhere to place \nchildren. Children are forced to sleep in local DCS offices, sent to emergency shelter care for \nextended periods of time, placed unnecessarily in an institution, or placed in foster homes that are \nfilled past their licensed capacity limits.  \n250.  The shortage of foster homes means that children are frequently placed far from \ntheir homes. In November 2017, nearly 35 percent of children were placed outside of their home \ncounties. The problem is more acute in rural areas, with nearly half of children placed in other \ncounties. The CWG Report found that some children are placed three-to-five hours away from \ntheir home communities and schools. This inhibits children from maintaining meaningful contact \nwith their families and support networks. Lengthy travel is also burdensome to caseworkers, who \nare required to see children monthly.  \n  63 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 64 of 85 PageID #: 204\n   \n   \n251.  These failures in Indiana’s use and number of foster homes substantially depart \nfrom widely accepted professional standards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the risk \nof harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nH.  Emergency Shelter Care. \n252.  DCS places children in emergency shelter care—a short-term placement that is \nmeant to provide temporary, 24-hour care—far too often and for far too long. Because Indiana \nlacks sufficient resources to handle the increased volume of children in its care, when children are \nremoved from their homes, they are often placed in inappropriate or inadequate temporary \nplacements. These are typically group or institutional facilities, upon information and belief, \nsometimes with a separate designated area for emergency shelter care beds.  \n253.  According to DCS policy, emergency shelter care stays must not exceed 20 days \nwithout approval. The emergency shelter facility or Local Office Director can request an extension \nif DCS has not identified a permanent placement for the child at the end of 20 days. DCS policy \nalso mandates that DCS must seek court approval for all emergency shelter care placements within \n48  hours  of  a  child  entering  such  a  facility.  DCS  policy  imposes  additional  restrictions, \nrecommending that no children under the age of 10 be placed in emergency shelter care. \n254.  In contravention of these legal and policy requirements, DCS unnecessarily places \nchildren of all ages in emergency shelter care.  Overburdened FCMs have insufficient time to \nengage in meaningful case planning and placement matching, and Indiana lacks an adequate array \nof  placements.  As  a  result,  children  are  placed  in  emergency  shelter  care,  thus  needlessly \nsubjecting them to institutionalization for extended periods of time.   \n  64 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 65 of 85 PageID #: 205\n   \n   \n255.  For example, Plaintiffs Ashley W. and Betty W. lived in emergency shelter care for \nmonths when they were toddlers, which is against DCS policy’s minimum age requirement. Logan \nwas also placed in emergency shelter care as a nine-year-old.  \n256.  Moreover, providers offering emergency shelter care are regularly forced to request \nplacement extensions as a result of DCS’s failure to identify appropriate long-term placements \nwithin 20 days.  Due to DCS’s failures, children often remain in these temporary placements for \nmonths. Upon information and belief, some of these youth, especially teens, are left at the facilities \nand transitioned from emergency shelter care beds to long-term residential beds at the same \ninstitution when DCS is unable to identify placements for them.  \n257.  DCS’s overreliance on  emergency shelter care  defies extensive evidence and \nguidance in the child welfare field about the importance of minimizing institutional care for \nchildren.    Moreover,  these  temporary  emergency  shelter  care  placements  mark  yet  another \nplacement for children, despite undisputed best practices in the child welfare field to minimize the \nnumber of placements. \n258.  Children in emergency shelter care are at increased risk of educational and service \ndisruptions  as  well.  This  becomes  increasingly  problematic  the  longer  children  are  left  in \nemergency shelter care. Children who are not in school or remain without services fall further \nbehind, and it is challenging for them to catch up to where they were when their education and \nservices resume. \n259.  These failures in Indiana’s use of emergency shelter care substantially depart from \nwidely-accepted professional standards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the risk of \nharm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \n  65 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 66 of 85 PageID #: 206\n   \n   \nI.  Defendants Fail to Adequately Train, Supervise and Retain Caseworkers.  \n260.  While many FCMs undoubtedly want to help children and their families, FCMs in \nIndiana face many obstacles that prevent them from effectively performing their critical job \nfunctions.  \n261.  In Indiana, FCMs bear case management responsibilities for out-of-home CHINS \ncases. FCMs must assess family needs regarding child safety and well-being, identify service \nneeds, make referrals for services, work with families and service providers to assess progress, and \nprovide necessary information to the court. \n262.  FCMs in Indiana experience low morale and repeatedly described a “culture of \nfear” at DCS. CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department of Child Services (June 18, 2018). \nEven more alarming, some FCMs reported to CWG that they did not feel safe to “tell the truth.” \nId. They reported feeling unable to bend policy, even if they thought it would lead to better \noutcomes.  \n263.  Moreover, FCMs reported that “DCS does not have a learning culture,” and that \nthey fear supervisors will punish them for acknowledging any lack of knowledge or skills or for \nasking for help. Id. \n264.  Not surprisingly, this translates to a high turnover rate within DCS. As of March \n2018, FCM turnover at 12 months was 30.4 percent. A 2017 report found that more than half of \nFCMs who leave DCS do so within the first two years.  See id. And CWG found that “[h]igh levels \nof turnover, especially  among  FCMs,  was  among the most  commonly  cited themes in  the \ninterviews conducted over the course of the review.” Id. \n  66 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 67 of 85 PageID #: 207\n   \n   \n265.  There  are  many  reasons  for  this  high  rate  of  FCM  turnover,  including \nunmanageable workloads, lack of support, required on-call and overtime work, and pay that is \nincommensurate with the demands of the job.  \n266.  High FCM turnover leaves families in a “chronic state of re-introduction and \nre-assessment.”  Id.  High  turnover  also  creates  discontinuity  of  services.  When  FCMs  are \ninexperienced, poorly trained, and overwhelmed with unmanageable caseloads, permanency is \n“lost in the mix.” Id.  \n267.  Indiana’s high turnover rate for FCMs has significant negative consequences for \nthe  children  in  foster  placements  and  institutional  settings.  Research  has  shown  that  high \ncaseworker  turnover  is  strongly  correlated  with  children  experiencing  multiple  placements, \nreceiving fewer services, remaining in foster care longer, and failing to achieve permanency. In \naddition, FCMs reported that high rates of turnover and “the constant state of cases being \nre-assigned is a stressor.” Id. FCMs acknowledge that turnover negatively affects families, “as \n[FCMs] were regularly sent to work with families who had just established a relationship with the \nprior FCM[s].” Id. Birth parents reflected this sentiment, expressing frustration that they had to \n“start over” with each subsequent FCM. Id.  \n268.  Additionally, many FCMs in Indiana carry higher-than-standard and statutorily \nmandated caseloads. Until June 2019, FCMs were prohibited under state law from carrying \ncaseloads involving more than 17 children. As of June 13, 2019, with the passage of new \nlegislation, that number was reduced to 13 children in out-of-home placement. Despite this, in \n2018, CWG found that FCMs commonly carry caseloads of 25 to 35 children. CWG even found \nthat one FCM had a caseload of 52 children, several of whom were placed several hours away. \nThe CWG created a DCS weighted caseload management report for May 2018, which revealed \n  67 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 68 of 85 PageID #: 208\n   \n   \nthat an additional 421 caseworkers are required in order to meet Child Welfare League of America \ncaseload standards.   \n269.  DCS has recently reported that it is now 99 percent compliant with caseload \nstandards and has reduced FCM turnover by 18.7 percent in the past year. Notably, however, FCM \nturnover is still extremely high—with a quarter of the FCMs turning over in 2018, even after many \nFCMs received salary raises in 2018. Additionally, year after year, studies have pointed to high \ncaseloads and high turnover within DCS, but DCS repeatedly failed to find sustainable solutions. \nAfter the CWG Report was publicized, DCS hurriedly found ways to improve its caseload and \nemployment statistics, but, if the past is any indicator of future performance, the recent fixes are \nlikely not long-term solutions. And, even if DCS’s problematic caseloads were resolved, many \nother issues remain with Indiana’s child welfare system.  \n270.  Moreover, the already overwhelmed FCMs are subjected to further stress from \nDCS’s highly centralized structure, which requires them to constantly seek approvals during the \npendency of their cases. This organizational structure causes delays in cases, as FCMs often lack \nauthority  to  make  decisions  or  offer  services.  Instead,  parties  must  wait  for  DCS  upper \nmanagement or the central office to make decisions regarding case planning. For instance, even \nwhere there are compelling reasons not to terminate parental rights, some Local Office Directors \nrequire Regional Managers to approve casework recommendations for children who have been in \nfoster care 15 out of the last 22 months, causing even further delays. Delays in these cases put \nfamilies, who are already on the brink of permanently separating, at significant risk of harm. \n271.  Defendants’ failure to employ a sufficient number of caseworkers and qualified \nsupervisors, and failure to adequately train them and ensure that they carry reasonable caseloads, \n  68 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 69 of 85 PageID #: 209\n   \n   \nsubstantially departs from widely accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nJ.  Inadequate Case Planning and Insufficient Services. \n272.  DCS’s high staff turnover and high caseloads have and continue to impair effective \ncase planning.   \n273.  Upon information and belief, many children in Indiana foster care do not receive \nappropriate case plans that fully comply with the federal requirements for such plans, such as the \nrequirements that they include a discussion of how the case plan is designed to achieve a safe \nplacement for a child in the least restrictive and most family-like setting, a description of services \noffered, and documentation of the steps required to finalize a placement when the goal is adoption \nor another permanent home. See 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(g). Furthermore, children may not receive \nnecessary services that are recommended in their case plans due to (i) Defendants’ failure to make \ntimely  referrals  and  (ii)  FCM’s  excessive  caseloads,  which  preclude  them  from  effectively \nmanaging each child’s case effectively.  \n274.  FCMs rarely adhere to the practice model concerning Child and Family Team \nMeetings (“CFTMs”), which are meetings in which DCS and service providers discuss the \nprogress of the case and families’ goals. \n275.  Under DCS policy, CFTMs are held at “critical junctures throughout the life” of a \ncase, which can include assessing the need for a removal, developing a case plan, revising a \npermanency plan prior to court, safety and service planning, changing a permanency plan to \nanother planned, permanent living arrangement for older youth, or changing a placement. DCS \nPolicy, Ch. 5, § 7, Version 5 (July 1, 2015). DCS often fails to prepare families for CFTMs and \nfails to communicate the purpose of the meetings.  \n  69 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 70 of 85 PageID #: 210\n   \n   \n276.  Some families reported to CWG that their planning consisted of FCMs simply \ndoling out directives, rather than asking for their input. Other parties, including foster parents, \ntherapists, extended family, and CASAs are frequently excluded from the meetings. Providers also \nreported that DCS regularly fails to include them in CFTMs; when DCS does include them, DCS \nrushes through CFTMs in court or immediately before or following hearings. CWG reported that \nrelatives, providers, community resources, educators, and perhaps alleged or legal fathers and \npaternal relatives were usually not involved in CFTMs.  \n277.   Providers estimated that CFTMs occurred in only 50 percent of key decisions. \nInstead, important issues surfaced in court.  \n278.  Moreover,  CWG  noted  that  FCMs  failed  to  conduct  comprehensive  family \nfunctional assessments during the case planning process. This leaves FCMs without critical \ninformation regarding families’ needs, which hampers their ability to make meaningful service \nreferrals.  \n279.  Defendants’  failure  to  engage  in  adequate  and  meaningful  case  planning \nsubstantially departs from widely-accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nK.  Poor Placement Matching. \n280.  DCS  further  harms  children  by  often  placing  them  in  inappropriate  foster \nplacements that are ill-equipped to meet their needs. Upon information and belief, DCS fails to \nengage in effective placement matching, instead hurriedly placing youth in the first available \nplacement.   \n281.  Foster parents report that FCMs have failed to provide them with accurate or \npertinent information about children before placing them in their homes. Foster parents are \n  70 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 71 of 85 PageID #: 211\n   \n   \ntherefore unprepared to meet the children’s needs, which ultimately increases the likelihood of \nplacement instability.  \n282.  The named Plaintiffs’ experiences, described in detail above, illustrate how poor \nsupport in a foster home might lead to instability, whereby children are shuffled from foster \nplacement to foster placement.  For instance, DCS placed Logan in multiple foster homes and \npre-adoptive homes without fully informing those placements about his history and needs. DCS \nalso  failed to consider the most appropriate  type of home that would best support Logan’s needs \nand his disability. As a result, many of Logan’s placements failed, further traumatizing him. \n283.  Upon information and belief, DCS also pushes premature trial home visits. This \npractice only re-traumatizes children if the trial home visits fail and DCS has to conduct another \nremoval. And, as with Plaintiffs Ashley W. and Betty W., inappropriate trial home visits may place \nchildren at risk of harm.  \n284.  DCS frequently, and often abruptly, moves the foster children in its custody from \nplacement to placement.  For instance, Ashley, Betty, Sara, and Logan have all been in well over \na dozen different placements since becoming wards of DCS.  Placement changes negatively impact \nchildren’s education, therapy, and access to services.  \n285.  Shuffling children from foster placement to foster placement negatively affects \ntheir well-being in other ways too. Children are sometimes transferred to new placements with no \nexplanation of where they are or why. This degree of turbulence and uncertainty can lead to \nemotional trauma and attachment disorders, and causes children to have feelings of instability and \ninsecurity. Frequent moves may also result in children losing contact with their siblings, relatives, \ncommunity supports, friends, and other adults in their lives.  \n  71 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 72 of 85 PageID #: 212\n   \n   \n286.  Defendants’ failure to ensure placement stability to children substantially departs \nfrom widely-accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk \nof harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nL.  Insufficient and Ineffective Services. \n287.  Federal law requires states to provide a continuum of services, such as mental \nhealth treatment, visitation, domestic violence victim support and batterer intervention, and drug \nscreening, in order to protect and promote the welfare of children; prevent the neglect, abuse and \nexploitation of children; support at-risk families through services that allow children to safely \nremain with their families or return home in a timely manner; promote the safety, permanency, \nand well-being of children in foster care; and provide training, professional development, and \nsupport to ensure a well-qualified child welfare workforce. See 42 U.S.C. § 621. \n288.  Despite the high number of contracted community-based service providers, Indiana \nlacks a sufficient array of services necessary to meet the needs of children and families involved \nwith its child welfare system. Further, FCMs fail to ensure that children access services that are \navailable in a timely manner, contrary to legal requirements. Hoosier children and their families \noften remain on waiting lists for services, or are never referred at all. Accurate and necessary \ninformation about children’s circumstances, including medical and social histories as well as \nspecial needs, are withheld from foster parents or residential providers. \n289.  Services  are  critical  to  the  well-being  of  children  in  DCS  custody,  who  are \nparticularly vulnerable for a number of reasons. Children in foster care have often experienced \nsevere and chronic trauma and may have been exposed to other stressors, such as extreme poverty \nor parental substance abuse. Research shows that children exposed to repeated traumatic stress or \npervasive neglect, including children removed from their homes due to allegations of abuse or \n  72 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 73 of 85 PageID #: 213\n   \n   \nneglect,  manifest  increased  physical,  psychological,  and  emotional  problems  later  in  life. \nTraumatic foster care experiences, without adequate services, only compound these problems. \n290.  In Indiana, FCMs often fail to ensure children are assessed and receive necessary \nservices in a timely manner. Rather, FCMs often abdicate these responsibilities to foster parents, \nrelying on them to proactively seek or request services without DCS oversight or guidance.  \n291.  In the 2016 CFSR, the Children’s Bureau found severe service gaps for substance \nabuse, mental health, domestic violence and youth mentoring. See U.S. DEP’T OF HEALTH AND \nHUMAN SERVS., ADMIN. FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES, INDIANA FINAL REPORT (2016). In the areas \nfor which services are offered, upon information and belief, many of the service providers, \nincluding those providing mental health services, are ineffective and of poor quality. Nevertheless, \nDCS continues to renew contracts with these substandard service providers. \n292.  The CWG Report noted that some FCMs think they cannot or should not request \nservices for CHINS.  Further, a group of FCMs said that home-based services were “not allowed \nanymore.” CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department of Child Services (June 18, 2018). CWG \nfound that “[m]any FCM’s were repeatedly uneasy about requesting or approving services.” Id. \nReviewers heard that this wariness was rooted in a lack of autonomy perceived by the FCMs, \ncoupled with heightened scrutiny around local spending in particular. \n293.  FCMs reported that it takes weeks to complete certain referrals, waitlists are months \nlong, and some services are long distances away. CWG concluded, “one thing was obvious: the \nFCMs do not have a clear sense of what treatment is and isn’t available; whether it can be paid for \nby DCS; and what is occurring at the leadership level to combat addiction.” Id. Concerningly, \n“FCMs may also be expected to administer drug tests, a duty that raises serious concerns . . . \nregarding family engagement and blurring of roles.” Id.  \n  73 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 74 of 85 PageID #: 214\n   \n   \n294.  Effective services are especially lacking for members of the ADA Subclass, who \nare put at increased risk of institutionalization when their needs are left unmet. For instance, Sara \nwas shuffled from foster home to foster home and did not receive effective therapy or other forms \nof treatment to address the sexual abuse she has repeatedly suffered, and Desmond has been forced \nto live in an adult-nursing home instead of a foster home because of DCS’s failure to provide \nin-home supports to accommodate his disability.   \n295.  Defendants’ failure to provide necessary services to children and parents impedes \nreunification efforts, because children are either unable to return home, or they are returned home \nbefore the issues that led to their removal are adequately addressed.  \n296.  Defendants’ failure to provide necessary services substantially departs from widely \naccepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk of harm to \nPlaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nM.  Lack of Permanency.  \n297.  Permanent  homes  and  families  are  critical  to  ensuring  a  child’s  healthy \ndevelopment. Research shows that children suffer when they grow up in state custody without \nachieving permanency.  \n298.  But the length of time children in out-of-home placements in Indiana wait to \nachieve permanency has increased over the years.  \n299.  As of May 27, 2018, 5,897 Hoosier children’s case plans included adoption as a \ngoal. But only 143 children of those children were adopted in the six months between October \n2017 and March 2018. \n300.  Indiana’s low adoption rate is partially a result of DCS’s ineffective legal division. \nThe legal division is staffed with attorneys who represent the agency in child welfare legal \n  74 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 75 of 85 PageID #: 215\n   \n   \nproceedings, including CHINS and termination of parental rights proceedings. But the DCS legal \nworkforce suffers from a high turnover rate, persistent vacancies, and inexperienced employees. \nThis results in “inconsistent availability of consistent and good quality legal consultation to case \nmanagers and…continuances of scheduled court hearings as well as delayed filing for termination \nof parental rights when reunification efforts have been unsuccessful.” Id. \n301.  Last summer, the Indiana Court of Appeals rebuked DCS regarding its handling of \nproceedings involving the termination of parental rights. On July 9, 2018, the Indiana Court of \nAppeals issued an Order noting a “disturbing trend” with nine cases it had received in the prior six \nmonths. A.A. v. Ind. Dep’t of Child Servs., 100 N.E.3d 708, 709 (Ind. Ct. App. 2018). In these \ncases, parents appealed the termination of their parental rights, and DCS moved for the cases to be \nremanded to the trial court, conceding DCS had violated the parents’ due process rights. Id. The \ncourt  wrote,  “[t]he  increasing  frequency  of  these  motions  suggest  that  there  are  repeated, \nsignificant violations of due process occurring in termination of parental rights cases throughout \nthis state.” Id. The Court went so far as to “formally admonish DCS for its failure to afford litigants \nthroughout this state the due process rights they are owed.” Id.  \n302.  This serious mishandling of termination of parental rights matters harms not only \nparents but also children, who are left languishing in foster care as the legal proceedings are \nunnecessarily drawn out. \n303.  Indiana’s failure to provide children with permanent homes within a reasonable \nperiod of time is a direct result of Defendants’ failure to bring and appropriately litigate termination \nof parental rights proceedings; failure to secure adoptive homes for children on paths to adoption; \nand failure to remedy structural and systemic deficiencies that have negatively affected Indiana’s \nfoster care system for years.  \n  75 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 76 of 85 PageID #: 216\n   \n   \n304.  DCS’s failure to ensure Plaintiff children are placed in permanent homes within a \nreasonable period of time substantially departs from professional judgment and demonstrates a \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff children and the classes they represent.  \nCAUSES OF ACTON \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nSubstantive Due Process under the U.S. Constitution \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n305.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein.  \n306.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution to provide reasonable care to, and to protect from harm, a child with whom it has \nformed a special relationship. \n307.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment \nand amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests \nof all of the members of the General Class. Defendants are well aware of the policies and practices \nin place, which prevent these class members from receiving adequate protection from physical and \npsychological harm after the State has formed a special relationship with them. As a result, the \nnamed Plaintiffs and all of the members of the class of children to whom the state owes a special \nduty, children who have a special relationship with Defendants, including wards of DCS, have \nbeen, and are, at risk of being deprived of their substantive due process rights conferred upon them \nby the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n308.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \na.  the right to investigations of maltreatment that conform with reasonable \nprofessional standards; \n  76 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 77 of 85 PageID #: 217\n   \n   \nb.  the right to conditions and duration in foster care reasonably related to the \npurpose of government custody; \nc.  the right to freedom from maltreatment, and repeated maltreatment, while \nunder the protective supervision of the State; \nd.  the  right  to  protection  from  unnecessary  intrusions  into  the  child’s \nemotional well-being once the State has established a special relationship \nwith the child; \ne.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm; \nf.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions \nof government custody; and \ng.  the right  not  to  be maintained in  custody longer than is  necessary to \naccomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \ncustody. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n309.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n310.  Plaintiffs and the class members they represent are in Defendants’ custody or \nguardianship  and  are  wholly  dependent  on  Defendants  to  provide  for  their  basic  physical, \npsychological,  and emotional needs, and to  protect  them from  physical,  psychological,  and \nemotional harm. \n311.  Children frequently and foreseeably suffer physical, psychological, and emotional \nharm in DCS custody. They suffer harm in part because, in sharp contrast with the ideal of a stable \nand permanent home and family, they are continually shuttled between temporary and often \n  77 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 78 of 85 PageID #: 218\n   \n   \nnon-familial custodial arrangements.  Professional judgment and standards of conduct require the \nDefendants to make reasonable efforts toward placing children in their care in stable, permanent \nhomes and families.  \n312.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of professional judgment and amounts \nto deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the members of the General \nClass.  \n313.  By failing to take all reasonable efforts toward fostering familial association and \nsecuring a permanent home and family for the named Plaintiffs and the class members they \nrepresent, Defendants have failed to protect them from psychologically and emotionally harmful \nshuttling between temporary living arrangements.  \n314.  As a result, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of the General Class have \nbeen, and are at risk of being, deprived of the right to familial association and reasonable protection \nfrom psychological and emotional harm while in Defendants’ custody, in violation of the First \nAmendment’s right of association, the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections.  \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq. \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n315.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n316.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom of depriving the named Plaintiffs and the classes they represent of the \nrights contained in the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoptive and Safe Families \nAct of 1997, to: \n  78 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 79 of 85 PageID #: 219\n   \n   \na.  a written case plan that includes a plan to provide safe, appropriate, and \nstable placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A); \nb.  a written case plan that ensures that the child receives safe and proper case \nmanagement while in foster care and implementation of that plan, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16, 675(1)(B); \nc.  a written case plan that ensures provision of services to parents, children, \nand foster parents to facilitate reunification, or where that is not possible, \nthe permanent placement of the child and implementation of that plan, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B); and \nd.  a case review system in which each child has a case plan designed to \nachieve safe and appropriate foster care placements in the least restrictive \nand most family-like setting, closest to their home community, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A). \n317.  These provisions of the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997, are clearly intended to benefit Plaintiffs and the classes they \nrepresent; the rights conferred are neither vague nor amorphous such to strain judicial competence; \nand the statute imposes a binding obligation on the states. 42 U.S.C. § 1983; see also Henry A. v. \nWillden, 678 F.3d 991, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 2012).  \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAmerican with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act \n(Asserted by the ADA Subclass Against Defendants) \n318.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n  79 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 80 of 85 PageID #: 220\n   \n   \n319.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nits enabling regulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.101 et seq., prohibit discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities.  \n320.  ADA  Subclass  Plaintiffs  have  behavioral,    developmental  and  psychiatric \ndisabilities, which qualify them as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132(2)  and  “otherwise  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability”  under  the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). They meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of foster care services provided by DCS. \n321.  Defendants are public entities, or public officials of a public entity, subject to the \nprovisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132(1)(A). Such entities also receive federal financial \nassistance and are thus subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b); \n34 C.F.R. 104.51. Defendants Holcomb and Stigdon are sued in their official capacities as state \nofficials responsible for administering and/or supervising Indiana programs and activities related \nto foster care services.  \n322.  Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from excluding a person with a \ndisability from participating in, or denying the benefits of, the goods, services, programs and \nactivities of the entity or otherwise discriminating against a person on the basis of his or her \ndisability. \n323.  Likewise,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and  its  enabling  regulations  prohibit \ndiscrimination in the provision of services by any entity receiving federal funding. 34 C.F.R. \n104.4(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. 104.52(a)(2).  \n324.  Under the regulations enforcing the ADA, the state may not “[p]rovide a qualified \nindividual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal \n  80 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 81 of 85 PageID #: 221\n   \n   \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \nachievement as that provided to others . . . .” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). \n325.  Accordingly, DCS must provide children with disabilities an equal opportunity to \naccess foster care services, in the least restrictive appropriate setting, as it provides to children \nwithout disabilities in its custody.  \n326.  Moreover, Defendants have an affirmative duty to “make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \nwould  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service,  program,  or  activity.”  28  C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(7). \n327.  As set forth above, the regulatory hallmark and guiding force of disability law is \nthe provision of services, including the child’s placement in the most integrated environment \nappropriate to the youth’s needs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(b)(2); see also Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999).  \n328.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violations of Title II of the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs have been or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive \nsettings and subjected to unnecessary trauma because of their disabilities, as set forth above, and \nwill continue to suffer injury until Defendants are required to, and have, come into compliance \nwith the requirements of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \nI.  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \n  81 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 82 of 85 PageID #: 222\n   \n   \nII.  Order the Plaintiff Children may maintain this action as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \nIII.  Pursuant  to  Rule  57  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  declare \nunconstitutional and unlawful: \na.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s right to be free from harm \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \nb.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under the First, Ninth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; \nc.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under the Adoption \nAssistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.;  \nd.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.; and,  \nIV.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting Plaintiff Children to practices that \nviolate their rights, including: \na.

Require that DCS periodically \nverify that it is meeting and maintaining the applicable caseload standards, \nand that its verification process and the results shall be public information;  \n  82 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 16-1   Filed 06/26/19   Page 83 of 85 PageID #: 223\n   \n   \nb.

On December 12, 2017, the Director of Indiana’s Department of Child Services \n(“DCS”), Mary Beth Bonaventura, submitted her letter of resignation to Defendant Governor Eric \nHolcomb, warning that Indiana officials were systematically placing Hoosier children at risk “in \nways that all but ensure children will die.” Today, Indiana’s child welfare system continues to fail \nto protect children, and, in many instances, inflicts further trauma upon an already vulnerable \npopulation.  \n  1 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 2 of 81 PageID #: 2\n    \n \n2.  Indiana has long assumed responsibility for children who have been abused or \nneglected by their parents or caregivers. Yet the system Indiana has created to protect these \nchildren, administered through its Department of Children’s Services (“DCS”), instead often \ncauses them further trauma.   \n3.  Indiana removes children from their homes and places them into foster care at a \nstaggering rate—more than double the national rate. While children are in DCS custody, Indiana \nfails to keep them safe, often placing them in inappropriate, unstable, or overly restrictive \nplacements; fails to provide necessary support services and medical and mental health care; and \nfails to provide meaningful case management. Many of these children unnecessarily languish in \nfoster care for years before they are reunified with their primary caretakers, are adopted, or age \nout of the system. The delays caused by DCS inflict further emotional trauma.  \n4.  The shortcomings of the Indiana foster care system are well known by state \nofficials, who have received numerous reports documenting its disarray over the past five years.   \nThe most recent of these reports is an extensive expert analysis by the well-respected Child \nWelfare Consulting Group (“CWG”). The state’s systemic and continued failure to correct these \nissues leaves children in serious and unconstitutional danger.   \n5.  Although the state has made some changes to the foster care system since the \nissuance of the CWG report, the changes are minimal, and the basic problems continue. The agency \nappears to be focused more on statistics than outcomes, by allegedly not investigating cases or \nclosing cases that are not yet ripe for closing and without providing necessary services to children. \nMoreover, the state has not taken necessary steps to address the shortage of appropriate placements \nfor children, particularly those who remain in inappropriate and sometimes abusive institutional \nsettings for long periods of time.  \n  2 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 3 of 81 PageID #: 3\n    \n \n6.  The named Plaintiffs1—Sara, Logan, Ashley and Betty of Marion County, Jaidyn \nand James of Allen County, Thomas and Milo of Spencer County, and Desmond of Wells \nCounty—are  children in foster care in Indiana. They bring this lawsuit as a civil rights action on \nbehalf of all children who are now, or will be, in the custody of DCS. For each named plaintiff, \nDCS  has  failed  to  provide  safe  and  appropriate  foster  care  placements;  failed  to  provide \nappropriate services to the children and their families to allow safe reunification; and, for those for \nwhom safe family reunification is not possible, failed to timely pursue termination of parental \nrights legal proceedings and failed to seek and secure safe, permanent homes.  In doing so, \nDefendants have violated Plaintiffs’ federal constitutional and statutory rights.  \n7.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the Defendants—the state \nagency and state officials responsible for operating Indiana’s foster care system—for violating \nPlaintiffs’ rights under the U.S. Constitution and federal laws, which promise vulnerable children \nfor whom the State has assumed responsibility the right to be free from physical and psychological \nharm. The subclass of children with disabilities who are currently residing in institutional settings \nare further entitled to be free from discrimination based on their disabilities under the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”). \n8.  Director Bonaventura’s resignation prompted Governor Holcomb to commission \nan evaluation of DCS. On June 18, 2018, the CWG released its Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (“the CWG Report”), which identified a number of challenges \nfacing Indiana’s child welfare system, including, but not limited to, Indiana’s: \na.  Extremely high rate of children in out-of-home care compared to the rest of \nthe nation; \n                                                 \n1 The named Plaintiff children and any other minors mentioned by name in this Complaint all appear by \npseudonyms with the same first and last initials as their real names.  \n  3 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 4 of 81 PageID #: 4\n    \n \nb.  High caseloads amongst DCS Family Case Managers (“FCMs”) and agency \nattorneys; \nc.  High rates of FCM and DCS attorney turnover, as well as a “culture of fear” \nwithin DCS; \nd.  Highly centralized management and approval processes that lead to delayed \nservice delivery for children and their families; \ne.  Uneven interpretation and implementation of policies across counties; and \nf.  DCS’s  failure  to  meet  the  federal  standard  for  instances  of  repeat \nmaltreatment. \n9.  Notably, the CWG Report revealed that there have been at least five other DCS \nevaluations prepared by external evaluators since 2013. Those prior reports highlight many of the \nsame systemic issues afflicting Indiana’s child welfare system today. Despite the fact that these \nissues have been called to the attention of officials before, they persist.  Moreover, the recent \nchanges announced by the Governor are not fundamental and do not address the systemic issues  \nraised by the CWG Report.   Indeed, many of the statements issued by DCS in its periodic progress \nreports, the most recent of which was issued on June 14, 2019, either involve DCS having more \nmeetings with state officials or creating processes that enable DCS to deny responsibility for many \nof the problems. \n10.  The problems with Indiana’s child welfare system run even deeper than those \ncovered by the CWG Report. DCS lacks sufficient foster placements for youth alleged to be \nChildren in Need of Services (“CHINS”), leaving children for extended periods of time in \nemergency shelter care or forcing children to sleep in DCS offices; fails to engage in appropriate \nplacement matching, subjecting children to multiple and inappropriate foster care placements; \n  4 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 5 of 81 PageID #: 5\n    \n \nregularly separates sibling groups; and fails to provide children with disabilities with adequate  \nsupport services to meet their medical,  psychological, or developmental needs in the most \nappropriate, least restrictive environment.  \n11.  Additionally, when children cannot be safely reunified with their parents, DCS fails \nto develop a realistic alternative permanency plan, often filing multiple unsuccessful termination \nof parental rights petitions. In instances where children are legally freed for adoption, DCS has \nfailed to seek and secure appropriate adoptive homes in a timely manner, essentially rendering \nthese children legal orphans.  \n12.  DCS has also failed to provide appropriate integrated community-based services, \nprograms, or activities to children with disabilities who are wards of DCS, consistent with their \nindividual needs. Instead, DCS routinely places these children in overly restrictive residential or \ninstitutional settings. For many children with disabilities, their involvement in the child welfare \nsystem places them at a greater risk of institutionalization. \n13.  Plaintiffs  seek  a  ruling  from  this  Court  that  the  structural  deficiencies  and \nlong-standing actions and inactions of the Defendants described in this Complaint violate the \nstatutory and constitutional rights of all children dependent on the Indiana child welfare system \nfor their safety, well-being, and futures. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against \nDCS  and  state  officials  named  as  Defendants  in  this  lawsuit,  directing  that  necessary  and \nappropriate relief be granted so that Indiana’s children are no longer irreparably harmed by the \nsystem that that has failed its mandate to protect them. Plaintiffs ask this Court to protect their \nright to a safe and nurturing childhood.  \n  5 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 6 of 81 PageID #: 6\n    \n \nPARTIES \nA.

Eric Holcomb, Governor of Indiana, is sued in his official capacity. Under Article \n5, Sections 1 and 16 of the Indiana Constitution, the Governor holds executive power of the state \n  8 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 9 of 81 PageID #: 9\n    \n \nand is responsible for executing Indiana’s laws and ensuring executive departments comply with \nall applicable laws. Governor Holcomb has the power to issue executive orders and to shape the \nfunctions and coordination of DCS. Governor Holcomb is charged with appointing the Director of \nDCS, who serves “at the pleasure of the Governor” and reports “directly to the Governor.” IN \nExec. Order No. 05-15 (Jan. 11, 2005); IND. CODE § 31-25-1(b) (2019). The Governor has used \nhis executive authorities to manage the work of DCS, and, as such, child welfare in Indiana.  \n27.  DCS serves as the executive agency responsible for the safety and well-being of \nchildren in Indiana. DCS is the agency with overall non-delegable custodial responsibility for \ninvestigating allegations of child abuse and neglect, placing children in appropriate and safe foster \ncare placements, ensuring children’s safety and well-being, and guaranteeing that children in foster \ncare receive appropriate services, mental health screening, and treatment. DCS also regulates and \nlicenses Indiana’s child caring institutions, foster homes, group homes, and child placing agencies. \nDCS has offices throughout the state, including in this District.  \n28.  Terry Stigdon, Director of DCS, is sued in her official capacity. Director Stigdon \nis “responsible for administering” DCS. IND. CODE § 31-25-1(b) (2019). She employs personnel \nto carry out DCS’s responsibilities and must organize DCS in a manner best suited for providing \nits necessary services and carrying out its functions throughout the state. Director Stigdon is \nultimately responsible for ensuring DCS finds suitable homes for children in need of care, keeps \nthem safe while in DCS custody, properly supervises children, and provides them and their \nfamilies with necessary services.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n29.  This action for injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is based upon the \ncontinuing violations of Plaintiffs’ rights under the First, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments of \n  9 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 10 of 81 PageID #: 10\n    \n \nthe  United  States  Constitution,  the  Adoption  Assistance  and  Child  Welfare  Act  of  1980 \n(“AACWA”), the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct, and the respective implementing regulations.    \n30.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a). \n31.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n32.  Venue  in  this  District  is  proper  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)  because  a \nsubstantial part of the events and omissions giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District, \nand Defendants maintain offices and conduct business in this District. In addition, two of the \nnamed Plaintiffs’ CHINS cases were filed in this District.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \nA.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS REGARDING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES \nPLAGUING INDIANA’S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND RESULTING \nHARM TO PLAINTIFF CHILDREN. \n \n33.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n34.  This action consists of one general class and one subclass: \na.  A class comprised of all children for whom Indiana DCS has or will ever \nhave legal responsibility and/or a special relationship in the context of the \nchild protection system (the “General Class”); and \nb.  A subclass comprised of all members of the General Class who have or will \nhave  emotional,  psychological,  cognitive,  or  physical  disabilities  (the \n“ADA Subclass”). \n  10 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 11 of 81 PageID #: 11\n    \n \n35.  Each class is sufficiently numerous to make joinder impracticable. The General \nClass consists of at least 22,000 children who are in the legal and/or physical custody of DCS \nand/or  with  whom  DCS  has  a  special  relationship.  Over  14,300  of  these  children  are  in \nout-of-home care. \n36.  The ADA Subclass consists of thousands of children with disabilities who are or \nwill become a ward of DCS and who, because of a disability, are at a higher risk of being placed \nin overly-restrictive, institutional settings or are currently placed in overly restrictive institutional \nsettings.  \n37.  The questions of fact and law raised by named Plaintiffs are common and typical \nof each putative member of the classes whom they seek to represent.  \n38.  The named Plaintiffs rely on Defendants for foster care services in Indiana and \nwholly depend on Defendants for provisions of those services.  \n39.

Questions of fact common to the classes include: \na.  whether  Defendants  fail  to  protect  the  General  Class  from  physical, \npsychological, and emotional harm; \nb.  whether Defendants fail to make sufficient efforts to place members of the \nGeneral Class in appropriate permanent homes within a reasonable period \nof time;  \n  11 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 12 of 81 PageID #: 12\n    \n \nc.  whether  Defendants  fail  to  provide  foster  care  placements  and \nindividualized services that ensure members of the General Class’s well-\nbeing; \nd.  whether Defendants provide adequate case worker resources to ensure that \nmembers of the General Class can routinely and meaningfully meet with \ncaseworkers face-to-face and engage in individual services; \ne.  whether Defendants operate a system that provides an adequate diversity of \nplacements to permit the members of the General Class and ADA Subclass \nto reside in the most integrated, least restrictive, and most family-like \nenvironment; \nf.  whether Defendants fail to take reasonable steps to make it such that \nmembers of the General Class do not experience failed trial home visits; \nand \ng.  whether Defendants deprive Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass necessary and \nappropriate services and treatment to ensure access to a stable, family-like \nfoster placement in the least restrictive environments. \nh.  whether Defendants failed to provide appropriate, integrated community-\nbased services, programs, or activities to the Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass \nin order to support their needs in the community and prevent unnecessary \nand prolonged institutionalization.   \ni.  whether Defendants have placed an over-reliance on institutional settings \nfor Plaintiffs of the ADA Subclass and have failed to provide meaningful \n  12 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 13 of 81 PageID #: 13\n    \n \ncase management services or create a realistic permanency plan that does \nnot include institutionalization. \nj.  whether Defendants have violated the rights of the plaintiffs within the \nADA Subclass by administering the State's foster care system in a manner \nthat denies qualified children with disabilities the benefits of the State's \nservices, programs, or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate \nto their needs, and by failing to reasonably modify the State's foster care \nsystem to avoid discrimination against children with disabilities. \n41.  Questions of law common to the classes include: \na.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ substantive rights \nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution; \nb.  whether  Defendants’  systemic  failures  violate  Plaintiffs’  right  to  a \npermanent home and family, as well as their right to be free from harm and \nhave  their  basic  needs  met  under  the  First,  Ninth,  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution; \nc.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997;  \nd.  whether Defendants’ systemic failures violate Plaintiffs’ rights under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2), Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794, and the respective \nimplementing regulations; by unnecessarily placing youth with disabilities, \n  13 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 14 of 81 PageID #: 14\n    \n \nor placing them at risk thereof, in institutional settings and denying them \naccess to meaningful, individualized, and appropriate community-based \ntreatment and supports. \n42.

The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the classes \nthat they seek to represent.

OVERVIEW OF DCS AND FEDERAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL \nREQUIREMENTS. \nA.  The Role of DCS. \n45.  DCS is the Indiana state agency responsible for the safety and well-being of all \nHoosier children who come into contact with the state’s child welfare system.  DCS has a central \noffice in Indianapolis and 18 regional offices that cover Indiana’s 92 counties. \n46.  DCS’s mandate is twofold:  it is charged with overseeing the protection of Hoosier \nchildren and with child support enforcement.  DCS is the primary state agency responsible for \nreceiving and assessing reports of alleged child abuse and neglect.  Under Indiana law, DCS’s \nresponsibilities include, but are not limited to, providing child protection services; providing child \nabuse  and  neglect  prevention  services;  providing  family  preservation  services;  regulating, \nlicensing, and monitoring foster family homes, licensed child placing agencies, child caring \ninstitutions, group homes, and private secure facilities; administering foster care services; and \nconducting adoption and guardianship services.  \n47.  DCS has created child welfare policies and practice standards in order to carry out \nits responsibilities and comply with legal requirements under state and federal law.  \n48.  The Director of DCS employs personnel to carry out DCS’s mandate, including but \nnot limited to family case managers (“FCMs”), who are responsible for investigating allegations \nof abuse and neglect as well as planning for children in foster care. The Director is also responsible \nfor monitoring and supervising the services associated with ongoing child in need of services \n(“CHINS”) cases.  \n49.  Limits on FCM caseloads are intended to help ensure that each child and family \nreceives sufficient attention and prevents burnout among FCMs.  By statute, FCM caseloads are \n  15 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 16 of 81 PageID #: 16\n    \n \nto be capped at 12 families who are receiving in-home services and 13 children who are in out-of-\nhome placements, a provision which was passed by this session of the legislature and went into \neffect on June 13, 2019. However, defendants did not meet the caseload limits set previously, when \nthe caseloads were capped at 12 cases for assessment of reports of abuse and/or neglect and 17 for \nongoing cases. \n50.  DCS also contracts with numerous service providers throughout Indiana to deliver \nservices related to the prevention of abuse and neglect, preservation of families, placement of \nchildren, and permanency goals for children who enter foster care. \nB.  Overview of Federal Law. \n51.  The U.S. Constitution and federal statutes impose affirmative obligations on all \nstate and child welfare officials, including Defendants and others employed by DCS.   \n52.  For instance, the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that all state \nand local child welfare officials ensure that each child placed in foster care: is free from the \nforeseeable risk of physical, psychological, and emotional harm; receives the services necessary \nfor his or her physical, psychological, and emotional well-being; is provided with conditions, \ntreatment, and care consistent with the purpose and assumption of custody; is not maintained in \ncustody longer than is necessary to accomplish the purpose of custody; and is provided with an \nappropriate permanent home and family within a reasonable period of time. \n53.  Similarly, federal law requires that state child welfare officials place each child in \nfoster care in a foster placement that conforms to nationally recommended professional standards, \nand provide each child quality services to protect his or her safety and health. See 42 U.S.C. §§ \n671(a)(10),(22). Officials must also provide an individualized, written case plan that seeks to \nprovide safe, appropriate, and stable foster care placements or, when reunification with the child’s \n  16 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 17 of 81 PageID #: 17\n    \n \nparents is not possible or appropriate, a written case plan that ensures the identification of an \nappropriate adoptive or other permanent home for the child. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16); \n675(1)(A),(E). Written case plans must also ensure the child’s educational stability. See 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(G). \n54.  Federal law also regulates child welfare officials’ case review systems, and requires \nthat these officials maintain a case review system in which: each child in foster care has a case \nplan designed to achieve safe, appropriate, and stable foster care placements; the status of each \nchild in foster care is reviewed at least every six months by a court or person responsible for case \nmanagement for purposes of determining the safety of the child, the continuing necessity and \nappropriateness of the foster placement, the extent of compliance with the permanency plan, and \nthe projected date of permanency; and, for each child who has been in foster care for 15 of the \nmost recent 22 months, the responsible child welfare agency files a petition to terminate the \nparental rights of the child’s parents and concurrently identifies, recruits, processes, and approves \na qualified family for an adoption, or documents compelling reasons for determining that filing \nsuch a petition would not be in the best interests of the child. See  42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16); \n675(5)(A)-(C),(E). \n55.  Title II of the ADA prohibits the unjustified segregation of persons with disabilities, \nsee 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597 (1999), and requires that state \nagencies, such as Defendants, “administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated \nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n56.  Defendants have and continue to violate each of the aforementioned federal rights \nof the named Plaintiffs and other Hoosier children in the affected Class.  \n  17 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 18 of 81 PageID #: 18\n    \n \nII.  THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS. \n57.  DCS’s failings are readily apparent in the case of the named Plaintiffs, all of whom \nhave suffered significant harm under Defendants’ watch.   \nA.  Ashley W. and Betty W. \n58.  Ashley W. and Betty W. are sisters. Ashley is four years old and Betty is five years \nold. Ashley and Betty have been in court-ordered out-of-home placement under the custody of \nDCS for over two-and-a-half years. Prior to entering foster care, they were living with their mother \nand stepfather.  \n59.  Ashley and Betty’s father is not a respondent in the CHINS action.  \n60.  Ashley and Betty first came to the attention of DCS in July 2016. DCS received a \nreport that Ashley (then age one) and Betty (then age two) were being sexually abused by their \nstepfather. The report indicated that the girls would hide when their stepfather came home. Betty \nwas observed fondling herself in her diaper and later said she touched her vaginal area because \nthat is what her stepfather does. DCS also received reports that Ashley had soreness and tears in \nher vaginal area. Ashley repeatedly pointed at her vaginal area and said “owie.”  \n61.  Upon receiving the reports, DCS opened the case for an investigation, but did not \nremove the children from the home.  \n62.  A few weeks later, upon information and belief, while DCS’s investigation was \nongoing, DCS received another report that the girls’ mother, stepfather, and other adults were \nabusing methamphetamine in the home. At some point, DCS received additional reports that the \nstepfather kept a gun in the home, punched walls, and was threatening to blow the house up.  \n63.  Upon information and belief, despite receiving credible reports of sexual abuse, \nsubstance abuse, and violence within the home, DCS waited weeks to remove Ashley and Betty \nfrom their home and file a CHINS petition against their mother and stepfather. The CHINS petition \n  18 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 19 of 81 PageID #: 19\n    \n \nincluded allegations of substance abuse and having a dirty home, but did not even mention the \ncredible reports of sexual abuse against the sisters.  \n64.  After removing the children from their home, DCS initially placed the girls with \ntheir uncle. This placement failed, and after less than a month, they were moved to their aunt’s \nhome, which, upon information and belief, was an unlicensed kinship placement. At the time, the \naunt was on medical leave from work, and, upon information and belief, repeatedly informed DCS \nthat she could not continue to care for Ashley and Betty after she returned to work in October. She \nalso informed the service providers that she had no help caring for the children and could not afford \nto take care of them. As expected, in October 2016, the aunt requested the girls’ removal. DCS \nfailed to identify a new placement for the girls despite knowing for over a month that they would \nneed to be moved.  \n65.  Instead, DCS placed Ashley and Betty in emergency shelter care, where they \nremained for almost two months. This placement was in direct violation of DCS policy, which \ndoes not recommend placement of children under the age of 10 in residential settings, and limits \nemergency shelter care stays to 20 days unless there are exceptional circumstances and approval \nfrom the Deputy Director of Placement Support and Compliance. While Ashley and Betty were in \nemergency shelter care, their behaviors began to noticeably deteriorate during their weekly \nsupervised visits. \n66.  Beginning in December 2016, Ashley and Betty were placed with a series of \nout-of-home foster parents. Over the course of the next two years, Ashley and Betty cycled through \n13 and 14 additional placements respectively, many of which lasted for only a month. \n67.  The girls also spent the winter holidays in 2017 in emergency shelter care again. \nBy DCS’s own admission in its policy on placement changes, “[d]isruption in placement may have \n  19 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 20 of 81 PageID #: 20\n    \n \nserious negative consequences for [children’s] sense of security and self-worth. A placement \nchange may be another loss, rejection, or possible trauma for [children] and may affect the \n[children’s] ability to form positive attachments in the future.” DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 38, Version \n4 (July 1, 2018). \n68.  Many of Ashley and Betty’s foster parents, as well as their therapists, noticed that \nthe girls displayed sexually maladaptive behaviors. Betty was increasingly violent towards other \nchildren, and the girls were physically aggressive with one another. Betty was also sexually acting \nout on Ashley as a result of the abuse she suffered.  \n69.  Despite the significant trauma Ashley and Betty reportedly experienced at home \nand their concerning behaviors while in DCS care, DCS did not provide Ashley and Betty any \ncommunity-based  services  until  months  after  they  were  removed  from  their  home.  Upon \ninformation and belief, in January 2017, approximately five months after their initial placement, a \nfoster parent requested therapy for the girls to address their concerning behaviors, as well as their \ncognitive and speech delays. Only after this foster parent’s request did DCS enroll Betty in \nhome-based/play therapy and Ashley in speech therapy and home-based/play therapy.  \n70.  The girls’ sexually maladaptive and aggressive behaviors were noted by their \ntherapists as well as during weekly supervised visits with their mother and father. \n71.  Ashley and Betty’s visits with their father quickly progressed to unsupervised visits \nat his home. Soon after visits at his home started, the girls’ foster parent complained that the \nfather’s residence had a flea infestation. As a result, in January 2017, DCS requested that the \nfather’s visits revert to being supervised, and the court temporarily ordered supervised visits. DCS \nnoted that the father lacked appropriate housing and displayed concerning behavior when visiting \nwith the girls.  \n  20 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 21 of 81 PageID #: 21\n    \n \n72.  Despite these concerns, in the spring of 2017, DCS placed Ashley and Betty on a \ntrial home visit with their father. At the same time, only a few short months after services began, \nDCS ended home-based/play therapy for both girls because they had purportedly met their \ntreatment goals. \n73.  Per DCS policy, trial home visits are for a period of up to three months, which may \nbe extended in three month increments, “when the safety and well-being of the child can be \nreasonably ensured” and the child’s permanency goal is reunification, there is progress towards \nthe case goals, any safety concerns have been addressed, and the service level of the case can be \ndecreased. DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 39, Version 5 (Jan. 1, 2019). Service levels are based on a family’s \nrisk level, and factors which might suggest that a child can remain safely in a home, include, but \nare not limited to, whether the non-offending parent demonstrates protective capacities and \nacknowledges the risk to the child, whether the non-offending parent and child are in a safe \nlocation, and other issues, such as substance abuse or mental health, do not pose safety threats. See \nDCS Policy, Ch. 4, § 26, Version 3 (May 1, 2009). \n74.  DCS maintains placement and care responsibilities for children who are on trial \nhome visits and the FCM must provide continued services to the family and make weekly face-to-\nface contact with the children and parent. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 39, Version 5 (Jan. 1, 2019); \nCh. 8, § 10, Version 11 (Mar. 1, 2019).  \n75.  Upon information and belief, DCS failed to ensure the girls’ well-being while they \nwere living with their father. The trial home visit failed within two months, and DCS requested \nauthorization to remove the girls from their father’s home due to allegations of neglect. In the two \nmonths in their father’s care, Ashley and Betty were dirty, had lice, contracted ringworms, missed \nservice appointments, and had unexplained bruises and injuries on their bodies. In addition, Betty \n  21 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 22 of 81 PageID #: 22\n    \n \ndeveloped a urinary tract infection, Ashley suffered a black eye, and their father tested positive on \ntwo drug screens.  \n76.  After the failed trial home visit, DCS placed the girls together in a series of non-\nkinship foster homes. DCS also resumed supervised visitation with the father. Ashley and Betty \ncontinued to engage in sexually maladaptive behaviors and fight with one another in their foster \nhomes, during therapy sessions, and during visits. After a several-month disruption in their \ntherapy, DCS re-enrolled the girls in therapy.  \n77.  During a May 2017 play therapy session, Betty verbalized, for the first time, that \nher stepfather had sexually abused her. In the summer of 2017, the girls’ therapist noted that Ashley \nwas starting to mimic some of her older sister’s sexually maladaptive behaviors, and the therapist \ndetermined it was best to separate the girls for their therapy sessions. Ashley and Betty continued \nto report and show signs of trauma during their therapy sessions over the following year. In July \n2018, Ashley reported that her stepfather had sexually abused her. Ashley also reported that Betty \nwas sexually abusing her. \n78.  The girls continued to cycle through foster home placements, and in October 2018, \nAshley  (four  years  old)  and  Betty  (five  years  old)  were  separated  and  placed  in  different \nnon-kinship foster homes. Ashley was moved again, to her 17th foster home.  \n79.  Upon information and belief, since October 2018, Ashley and Betty only see each \nother during their weekly joint-supervised visits with their father.  \n80.  DCS did not change the girls’ permanency goal to adoption until the fall of 2018—\ntwo years after they entered foster care and more than a year since Betty had made her own \nallegations of sexual abuse against her stepfather. At the same time DCS changed the sisters’ \n  22 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 23 of 81 PageID #: 23\n    \n \npermanency goals to adoption, it separated them, making it less likely that the two sisters will be \nadopted by the same family.  \n81.  DCS filed a termination of parental rights petition regarding Ashley and Betty, but \nthe judge dismissed it in February 2019 because DCS had failed to meet a statutory deadline. \nTherefore,  the  termination  of  parental  rights  process  had  to  begin  anew,  further  delaying \nachievement of the girls’ permanency plans.  \n82.  Upon information and belief, there have been at least three FCMs assigned to the \ngirls, further adding to the girls’ experience of instability while in foster care and contributing to \ncase management problems.  \n83.  When Betty entered foster care, she was assessed to be a Child and Adolescent \nNeeds and Strengths (“CANS”) level two. CANS is a tool developed for children’s services to \nsupport and inform decision-making, including to determine the appropriate level of care and \nnecessary service planning, and to better monitor the outcome of services. Two years later, likely \nas a result of her traumatic experience in foster care, she was assessed to be a CANS level seven, \na more serious level, which typically requires residential placement.  \n84.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Ashley and Betty have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had \nmade reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement \nmatching, not acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Ashley and \nBetty’s cases, and not acted with deliberate indifference to their legal rights, Defendants may well \nhave prevented years of additional trauma the girls have suffered while in the custody of DCS. \n  23 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 24 of 81 PageID #: 24\n    \n \nB.  Milo S. and Thomas M. \n85.  Milo S. and Thomas M. are brothers. Milo is three years old and Thomas is five \nyears old. Milo has been in foster care for nearly three years—his entire life, and Thomas has been \nin foster care for over four years. Milo has been in two foster homes. Thomas has been placed in \nfive foster homes and experienced one failed trial home visit. Milo and Thomas currently live \ntogether in a pre-adoptive non-kinship foster home. The boys have a half-sister, Caroline T., who, \nupon information and belief, is eight years old and is placed in a separate non-kinship foster home.  \n86.  In March 2015, DCS responded to a report that the children’s mother and her \nthen-husband were involved in a domestic violence-related altercation. DCS removed Thomas, \nwho  was  at  the  mother’s  home,  because  of  domestic  violence  and  the  mother’s  use  of \nmethamphetamine. Upon information and belief, both Thomas and his sister were placed in DCS \ncustody in the home of Thomas’s grandmother, where they lived for nearly a year. In February \n2016, DCS moved two-year-old Thomas to another foster home or relative placement for less than \na week. He was moved again in February 2016 to a foster home or relative placement, where he \nremained for only four-and-a-half months. Upon information and belief, at some point during these \nplacement changes Thomas and Caroline were placed in separate non-kinship foster homes. \n87.  On March 21, 2015, DCS filed a petition alleging Thomas and Caroline were \nChildren in Need of Services, and on April 16, 2015, the children were adjudicated CHINS. On \nJune 8, 2015, the trial court entered its dispositional order on the case, ordering the parents to \nengage in services. \n88.  Upon  information  and  belief,  the  children  were  assigned  the  same  FCMs \nthroughout their child welfare proceedings, and, initially, Spencer County DCS was assigned to \nthe children’s case. The first FCM assigned to the case was replaced by a second FCM. DCS \n  24 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 25 of 81 PageID #: 25\n    \n \nterminated the second FCM for filing a false report in connection with the family. DCS replaced \nher with a third FCM. The third FCM was on the case for a short period of time and was replaced \nby a fourth FCM. \n89.  At some point, the fourth FCM and Caroline’s father began engaging in a sexual \nrelationship. Caroline’s father testified that the fourth FCM gave him advanced notice of drug \nscreens and informed him that he did not need to continue engaging in certain services.  \n90.  In March 2016, while Caroline was on a trial home visit with her father, the \nchildren’s FCM gave Caroline’s father a drug screen, which he failed. The FCM assured the father \nshe would “take care of it,” but Caroline’s father failed a subsequent drug screen as well. He was \narrested for violating the terms of his probation and reported the FCM to her supervisor. Soon \nthereafter, DCS fired the fourth FCM based on her inappropriate relationship with Caroline’s \nfather. In March 2016, a fifth FCM took over the children’s case. \n91.  During this time, the mother was engaged in services, but DCS denied her requests \nfor a trial home visit. On May 24, 2016, the mother gave birth to Milo, and, upon information and \nbelief, DCS allowed the mother to take him home, despite the open CHINS proceeding involving \nher two other children. Thomas and Milo’s father was incarcerated at the time of Milo’s birth for \nfailing to register as a sex offender. \n92.  On July 8, 2016, DCS sent Thomas and Caroline on a trial home visit with their \nmother. While on the trial home visit, DCS was obligated to maintain placement and care \nresponsibilities, and the FCM was required to both provide services and make weekly face-to-face \ncontact with the children and parent.  \n93.  Despite DCS’s obligation to closely monitor the family, DCS failed to intervene \nwhile the mother neglected all three children during Thomas and Caroline’s trial home visit. On \n  25 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 26 of 81 PageID #: 26\n    \n \nSeptember 6, 2016, following a hearing, the mother went to the local DCS office and admitted to \nusing methamphetamine over the weekend. She stated that while she was using, she left her three \nchildren with her elderly father, who was in poor health and unable to care for the children, and \nher 20-year-old son, who was facing child molestation criminal charges. The mother returned \nhome while she was under the influence of methamphetamine to care for her three children.  \n94.  On  September  6,  2016,  DCS  removed  Thomas,  Milo  and  Caroline.  Upon \ninformation and belief, at this time DCS filed a CHINS petition against the mother on behalf of \nMilo. Thomas and Milo were placed in a non-kinship foster home and Caroline was placed with a \nkinship placement. At the time of his removal, Milo, who was only three months old, had severe \nscabies, and it appeared as though he had had the scabies for some time. Milo had sores on his \nback, redness on his feet, and bumps on his face, legs, feet, stomach, arms, back, and in the creases \nbetween his fingers and toes.  \n95.  Milo lasted only one day at his first foster home placement. Upon information and \nbelief, on September 7, 2016, Milo was moved to a new non-kinship foster home, because he was \ncrying too much at his previous placement.  \n96.  On September 14, 2016, Thomas was moved into the same foster home as Milo. \nThe boys are still in that foster home, which is a pre-adoptive placement. They were separated \nfrom their sister because DCS was unable to identify a foster home that could take all three \nchildren. \n97.  Upon information and belief, DCS played a minimal role, if any, in setting up \nservices and evaluations for the boys. Instead, upon information and belief, DCS relied on Thomas \nand Milo’s foster mother to arrange services and medical appointments. Thomas was initially \ndiagnosed with Adjustment Disorder and attended individual therapy. His foster mother expressed \n  26 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 27 of 81 PageID #: 27\n    \n \nconcerns about Thomas’s behavior, but the FCM did not arrange for an additional evaluation. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  in  December  2018,  the  foster  mother  took  Thomas  in  for  a \nneurological-psychological evaluation. Upon information and belief, Thomas was diagnosed with \nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder  and  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  and  he  was \nprescribed medication. \n98.  Milo is diagnosed with contact dermatitis and eczema. He received physical therapy \nfor a developmental delay until he was about one year old. \n99.  DCS also failed to arrange services for the mother. For instance, in February 2017, \nthe mother contacted the FCM to ask for help finding an inpatient substance abuse treatment \ncenter. The FCM provided the mother with a list of inpatient treatment facilities but testified it was \nthe mother’s “responsibility to get into those places.” A.S. v. Ind. Dep’t of Child Servs., 111 N.E.3d \n207, 210-11 (Ind. Ct. App. 2018). Ultimately, the mother moved in with Caroline’s father and lost \nher job due to lack of transportation. \n100.  On January 8, 2018, the parental rights of the boys’ mother and father were \ninvoluntarily terminated. The mother appealed the termination, and on July 9, 2018, the Court of \nAppeals of Indiana reversed and remanded the order terminating the mother’s parental rights. See \nid. at 213. The mother’s parental rights were reinstated on September 11, 2018. In its decision, the \nCourt of Appeals noted that the case involved not only five FCMs, two of whom were terminated \nfor inappropriate behavior, but also four DCS attorneys. See id. at 212. The boys’ father did not \nappeal the termination of his parental rights. \n101.  In 2018, Thomas and Milo’s case was reassigned to a sixth FCM from the Perry \nCounty DCS office. Upon information and belief, Perry County DCS took over the case because \nof Spencer County DCS’s serious mishandling of the case.  \n  27 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 28 of 81 PageID #: 28\n    \n \n102.  Upon information and belief, the mother voluntarily surrendered her parental rights \nin the spring of 2019. The boys are both freed for adoption but have not yet achieved permanency. \n103.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Thomas and Milo have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had \nmade reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning, not acted in \ndisregard of professional standards as to the management of Thomas and Milo’s cases, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to their legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented \nadditional trauma the boys have suffered while in the custody of DCS.  \nC.  Jaidyn R. & James M. \n104.  Jaidyn  and  James  are  currently  in  court-ordered  out-of-home  placement  in  a \nnon-kinship foster home. The boys have been in the custody of DCS since December 12, 2016. \n105.  Jaidyn was born on September 28, 2014 and is four years old. James was born on \nMarch 10, 2016 and is three years old. The boys share the same mother but have different fathers. \n106.   James was born three months premature and weighed only two pounds at the time \nof his birth. Upon information and belief, James was born with severely underdeveloped lungs, a \npossible heart defect, thyroid level abnormalities, and marijuana in his system. Once he was \ndischarged from the hospital, his mother failed to follow through with his required breathing \ntreatments and doctor appointments.  \n107.  DCS received several  reports of suspected child abuse or neglect concerning Jaidyn \nand James prior to their December 12, 2016 removal. On March 14, 2016, DCS substantiated a \nreport that James was a drug-exposed infant. Upon information and belief, in late 2016, DCS \nreceived multiple reports of suspected child neglect, but DCS failed to substantiate any of the \nreports. \n  28 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 29 of 81 PageID #: 29\n    \n \n108.  On December 7, 2016, the mother called 911 and drove James to a hospital located \nin Fort Wayne, Indiana, because he was non-responsive. The mother reported that James, who was \nseven months old and weighed only six pounds, had been lethargic for the previous three days. \nThe mother admitted she was not giving James necessary medication at home and had not taken \nhim to the doctor for months. James was admitted to the hospital for severe malnourishment and \na failure to thrive. On the same day, hospital staff made a report of suspected child abuse to the \nDCS hotline, and DCS opened an investigation. \n109.  On December 12, 2016, Jaidyn and James were removed from their mother and her \nboyfriend, James’s father, and placed in a non-kinship foster home. DCS informed the foster \nparents that James was hospitalized and would likely remain in the hospital for a few months. \nUpon information and belief, DCS provided the foster parents with incorrect names for the boys, \nan incorrect Medicaid number, and minimal information regarding their histories or medical needs. \nThis violated DCS’s own policy, which requires that DCS provide foster parents with information \nregarding the reason for the removal, full and accurate medical information, the children’s \nMedicaid numbers and other insurance information, and any special needs, among other things. \nSee DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 9, Version 7 (July 1, 2018). Moreover, upon information and belief, at \nthe time of his initial placement, the foster mother noticed that Jaidyn had large circular scars on \nhis upper thighs that resembled burns from a car lighter. \n110.  Upon information and belief, soon thereafter, the foster mother visited James at the \nhospital. To her surprise, two days later, on December 14, 2016, the hospital told her they were \nreleasing James. DCS neither oversaw the introduction of the foster parents to James nor his \ndischarge from the hospital to their home. \n  29 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 30 of 81 PageID #: 30\n    \n \n111.  Jaidyn and James’s mother gave birth to another baby boy on December 18, 2016. \nThis baby was also born prematurely and was placed in out-of-home care after the mother tested \npositive for marijuana at the hospital. He was placed in a different non-kinship foster home from \nhis brothers because DCS could not identify a foster home that could care for a toddler and two \nmedically fragile infants.  \n112.  After leaving the hospital, James had to see an occupational and physical therapist \nthree times a week, a pediatrician once a week, a surgeon as needed, a pulmonologist every month, \nan ENT doctor as needed, a neonatal intensive care unit doctor, and a Women, Infants, and \nChildren federal grant specialist. James also receives weekly therapy. Initially, Jaidyn only had to \nsee a pediatrician as needed. Upon information and belief, the boys’ foster parents secured these \nnumerous appointments without, or with minimal, DCS assistance. \n113.  Over the next year, James’s foster parents had to take him to the hospital three times \nand the emergency room twice due to his severe medical issues. \n114.  The court entered a CHINS finding against the mother and James’s father on \nFebruary 2, 2017. The same day, the court entered a dispositional finding, continuing the children’s \nplacement with DCS and ordering services for the parents. The parents’ ordered services included \nsubmitting to diagnostic assessments, engaging in substance abuse treatment, submitting to drug \nscreens, engaging in home-based services, completing a psychological assessment, participating \nin anger management classes, and visiting with their children. Both parents failed to comply with \ntheir court-ordered services and repeatedly tested positive for marijuana. In addition, on February \n16, 2017, James’s father tested positive for trace amounts of cocaine. \n115.  The parents were granted supervised visits with the boys twice weekly for a total \nof eight hours. The parents regularly arrived late and failed to appear for nearly a third of the visits. \n  30 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 31 of 81 PageID #: 31\n    \n \nThey were also permitted to attend the children’s medical appointments, but rarely took advantage \nof this opportunity.  \n116.  On October 14, 2017, the mother was arrested and criminally charged with Neglect \nof a Dependent Resulting in Serious Injury, stemming from her neglect of James. Later that month, \nthe mother was evicted from her home, which she shared with James’s father. James’s father \nstopped attending visits and participating in any services in the fall of 2017. \n117.  On November 14, 2017, DCS, in its Permanency Plan, sought permission from the \ncourt to initiate a termination of parental rights proceeding. DCS noted that James’s father failed \nto benefit from services and the boys’ mother was incarcerated.  \n118.  In early 2018, James’s father informed DCS that he was homeless and again tested \npositive for THC with trace amounts of cocaine.  \n119.  On February 16, 2018, the mother pled guilty and was sentenced to nine years’ \nincarceration with four years executed and five years’ probation following her release. She is \nexpected to spend two-and-a-half years in prison, with an early release date, upon information and \nbelief, in the summer or fall of 2019. During her incarceration and probationary period, the mother \nis prohibited from being around any child under the age of 14. She is permitted supervised \nvisitation with Jaidyn, but not James. \n120.  On March 20, 2018, after the boys had been in their foster home for more than two \nyears, DCS abandoned its plan to terminate the parents’ parental rights. Instead, DCS, at the behest \nof the boys’ mother and James’s father, asked the court to place Jaidyn, James and their younger \nbrother with their maternal great aunt within 90 days. Prior to moving the boys, DCS asked the \ncourt to order alternating weekend visitation with the aunt. The aunt had no intention of adopting \nthe boys and indicated she would care for them only until their mother could be reunited with \n  31 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 32 of 81 PageID #: 32\n    \n \nthem—in seven-and-a-half years. The children’s guardian ad litem (“GAL”) and court appointed \nspecial advocate (“CASA”) both objected to the proposed move, and, instead, advocated for the \nthree boys to remain in their respective foster homes, all of which were pre-adoptive. The GAL \nand CASA noted the foster mothers stayed at home with the children in order to meet their \nextensive medical needs and recommended that DCS file a petition to terminate the parents’ rights \nand change the goal to adoption. \n121.  On August 6, 2018, DCS again asked that the court transfer all three boys to the \naunt’s home. Upon information and belief, the aunt still had never met the boys.  \n122.  By October 2018, DCS had lost contact with James’s father due to his continued \nhomelessness and failure to notify DCS of his whereabouts.  \n123.  In the fall of 2018, Jaidyn was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. At \nthe foster parents’ request, DCS submitted a referral for therapy and Jaidyn was evaluated. But the \nprovider  agency  indicated  they  did  not  have  sufficient  staff  to  provide  Jaidyn  with  the \nrecommended therapy services. As a result, upon information and belief, his foster parents had to \nsearch for a new therapist through a different agency. \n124.  A hearing to determine whether the children should be transferred to the care of \ntheir aunt began in November 2018 and concluded in December 2018. The court heard evidence \nthat James has chronic lung disease; was malnourished and suffered from severe reflux when he \nfirst came into foster care; requires oxygen, feeding therapy and breathing treatments; and engages \nin therapy to address his speech and cognitive issues. The court also learned that, in the fall of \n2018, Jaidyn was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and participates in weekly mental \nhealth and speech therapy. The boys’ younger brother likewise suffers from chronic lung disease; \nis regularly seen by a pulmonologist, cardiologist, and pediatrician; and is involved in multiple \n  32 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 33 of 81 PageID #: 33\n    \n \nweekly therapies. The court observed that the aunt has one calendar week on and one calendar \nweek off from work and would require a caregiver. Additionally, the children were bonded with \ntheir foster parents and lacked an emotional bond with the aunt. A neuropsychologist also testified \nthat removing the children from their foster parents could cause them to develop attachment \ndisorders. Nonetheless, DCS still supported this plan. \n125.  On March 11, 2019, the court concluded that DCS’s proposed permanency plan of \ngranting the aunt custody of the three boys was not in the children’s best interests. The court \nordered a permanency plan of termination of parental rights with adoption for all three boys. At \nthis point, Jaidyn and James had been in foster care for two years and three months. \n126.  Nevertheless, during a status hearing on April 25, 2018, DCS indicated it was in \ndisagreement with the court’s March 11th order and continued to advocate for a change of custody \nto the aunt. The children’s CASA informed the court that a DCS case manager told the foster \nparents that DCS would not file a termination of parental rights petition and is, instead, going to \nwait until the mother is released from prison and recommend reunification at that time. However, \neven if the mother is released in mid-2019, the no contact order will be in place until 2024, \nprohibiting her from having any contact with James and limiting her to supervised contact with \nJaidyn. In addition, the assigned DCS attorney emailed the CASA a few days before the hearing, \nstating that he had no intention of filing a termination of parental rights petition.  \n127.  To date, the aunt has never visited Jaidyn and James. The boys have not seen their \nfather in well over six months and have not had contact with their mother since her 2017 \nincarceration. They have been in the same pre-adoptive foster home for nearly two-and-a-half \nyears, yet due to DCS’s mismanagement of their case, Jaidyn and James have failed to achieve \npermanency.  \n  33 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 34 of 81 PageID #: 34\n    \n \n128.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Jaidyn and James have \nsuffered and continue to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had \nmade reasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning, not acted in \ndisregard of professional standards as to the management of Jaidyn and James’s cases, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to their legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented \nadditional trauma the boys have suffered while in the custody of DCS.  \nD.  Logan S. \n129.  Logan S. is a 12-year-old boy who entered Indiana’s foster care system and became \na ward of DCS over 10 years ago. He was born in Chicago, Illinois. \n130.  In April 2008, when Logan was two years old, DCS received a report that someone \nwas physically abusing him and there was no food or diapers in his home. When DCS came to the \nhome to investigate, police were in the process of arresting the mother and father. The mother had \nan outstanding warrant from another state and was also charged with battery. DCS found Logan \nand his older brother in the home. Logan’s brother had scars on his finger, which he said were \nfrom the father whipping him with a spatula. The brother also had a burn mark on his body and \nadditional marks on his back. On a later date, the brother reported that the mother used all kinds \nof “stuff” to whip both him and Logan. During the investigation, DCS observed numerous scars \non Logan’s body. Logan’s brother said that Logan was whipped for drinking water out of the toilet \nand urinating on the floor. \n131.  DCS removed the children and placed them in foster care in April 2008. The court \nfound Logan to be a CHINS in 2008. \n132.  The mother’s parental rights were involuntarily terminated for Logan on January 8, \n2013—five years after entering foster care, when he was six years old.  \n  34 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 35 of 81 PageID #: 35\n    \n \n133.  Logan’s father’s parental rights were involuntarily terminated on February 6, 2012. \nHe was never involved with the case.  \n134.  Today, Logan has no contact with his biological parents or siblings.  \n135.  During his time in foster care, DCS has moved Logan to at least 15 different \nplacements. This exacerbates Logan’s history of instability. Prior to entering care, Logan’s mother \nwould leave him with other adults while she was incarcerated and later homeless.  \n136.  DCS placed Logan in emergency foster care with a non-kinship foster family from \nApril 23, 2008 until May 2, 2008. After this, Logan was placed in another foster home for \napproximately four months. DCS then moved Logan to live with his maternal grandmother in \nIllinois. \n137.  Logan lived with his grandmother for nine months. This placement, however, \ndisrupted after DCS received an Interstate Compact Placement Case Report. Concerningly, this \nimplies that DCS placed Logan with his grandmother before receiving the full Interstate Compact \nReport, which involves clearances of out-of-state resources and their homes and is required before \nsending a child out-of-state. Indeed, per DCS policy, DCS will not allow an Indiana child to be \nplaced in another state without written approval from both Indiana’s and the receiving state’s \nInterstate Compact on the Placement of Children Office. See DCS Policy, Ch. 9, § 1, Version 2 \n(Mar. 1, 2013).  \n138.  The Interstate Compact Report revealed that Logan’s grandmother had a history \nwith the Illinois Department of Child Services relating to sexual abuse of Logan’s mother and a \nphysical abuse case. The Illinois caseworker noted that the grandmother was not affectionate with \nLogan. Logan also began urinating himself in her home.  \n  35 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 36 of 81 PageID #: 36\n    \n \n139.  DCS then placed Logan back in his first (non-emergency) foster home, where he \nlived for less than two months. This family initially stated they wanted to adopt Logan, but they \nchanged their minds, because they claimed Logan did not get along with their biological children.  \n140.  DCS moved Logan to another non-kinship foster home, and he lived there for \nalmost two years before the placement disrupted. DCS returned Logan to his first foster family \nagain—their third attempt at making this placement work, but the placement disrupted again two \nmonths later. \n141.  In May 2013, DCS placed Logan in yet another non-kinship foster home, his \nseventh placement in five years. At this point, Logan was legally freed for adoption, but this family \nwas “ambivalent” about adopting Logan and blamed him for anything that went wrong in their \nhome. They refused to cooperate with Logan’s bonding therapist and claimed they could not deal \nwith a child who wets the bed.  \n142.  In January 2014, DCS placed Logan in his first therapeutic foster home with his \nmentor  from  his  wrap-around  services.  During  this  placement,  DCS began  arranging  visits \nbetween Logan and his stepmother, who expressed an interest in caring for Logan. Once these \nvisits  began,  Logan’s  behavior  in  his  foster  home  deteriorated.  Logan  required  two  acute \nhospitalizations while in this home, the second of which lasted over a month. DCS filed a report \nof abuse in the foster home after Logan reported to his FCM that his foster father put him in a \nphysical hold with his hands behind his back, and Logan could not breathe.  \n143.  DCS transferred Logan to another therapeutic foster home, where he lived for only \ntwo months. From July to August of 2016, DCS placed Logan in emergency shelter care in \nIndianapolis because he was displaying self-harm behaviors, including cutting and banging his \nhead on the wall.  \n  36 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 37 of 81 PageID #: 37\n    \n \n144.  When he was discharged from emergency shelter care, DCS placed Logan in the \nnon-kinship foster home of his Next Friend, Gloria Coyle. Upon information and belief, Logan \nlived there for one to two years, and he was hospitalized at least once. Ms. Coyle reported that she \nreceived minimal information about Logan’s family, placement, or developmental history from \nDCS—leaving her ill-prepared to handle his level of need. This was in violation of DCS policy, \nwhich requires DCS to provide the foster parent with “as much information about the child and \nhis . . . case as legally possible.” DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 9, Version 7 (July 1, 2018). By this time, \nLogan  was  significantly  behind  academically,  had  few  friends  and  poor  self-esteem,  and \nexperienced issues with incontinence. Logan also had “meltdowns,” after which he would beg Ms. \nCoyle to not have DCS remove him.  \n145.  Upon information and belief, DCS moved Logan from Ms. Coyle’s home because \nDCS identified an adoptive home for him. Upon information and belief, DCS sent Logan on only \ntwo visits with the new family prior the move, leaving both Logan and his potential adoptive \nparents ill-suited for success. Upon information and belief, the placement quickly disrupted. Upon \ninformation and belief, DCS briefly returned Logan to Ms. Coyle's home, but Logan’s behaviors \nhad significantly deteriorated due to the failed pre-adoptive placement. Upon information and \nbelief, DCS removed Logan from Ms. Coyle’s home and placed him in residential care at a facility \nthat  offers  day  treatment,  open  residential  treatment,  psychiatric  residential  treatment,  and \nemergency shelter care. Logan lived there for between one and two years, until May 28, 2018.  \n146.  When Logan was discharged, DCS placed him in a pre-adoptive foster home. He \nwas removed from this home less than three months later because Logan claimed his foster parents \nwere “hurting” and “hitting” him.  \n  37 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 38 of 81 PageID #: 38\n    \n \n147.  In August 2018, DCS again placed Logan in emergency shelter care because he had \nallegedly made false allegations against his foster parents. \n148.  Soon thereafter, Logan began engaging in self harm, and, in October 2018, DCS \nplaced Logan in a private secure facility with locked units in northern Indiana. Logan remains \nthere today. \n149.  Logan has sickle cell anemia. In September 2018, he was also diagnosed with Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder, \nBipolar I Disorder, and Reactive Attachment Disorder.  \n150.  Logan has been engaged in mental health therapy during much of his time in foster \ncare to address his many changes in placements, feelings of loss and rejection, and coping skills. \nHowever, providers have noted that Logan will likely make little progress in addressing his \nattachment issues until he is in a permanent placement. \n151.  Therapy has also revealed that Logan has received minimal hugging and tactile \ninput through much of his life. This is consistent with sensory processing and sensory-motor areas \nof deficit, difficulty with emotional and behavioral regulation, fight/flight/freeze responses to \nstress and anxiety and difficulty with self-soothing skills. While in foster care, Logan received \nservices with an occupational therapist, but those were discontinued due to challenges with \npayment for services. \n152.  Although the court legally freed Logan for adoption in 2013, DCS has left Logan a \nlegal orphan for much of his childhood. Logan longs to be permanently placed in a home and wants \na family who will love him and not hurt him. Logan has a history of rejection from his mother and \nhis prospective adoptive parents, which could have been avoided had DCS engaged in appropriate \nplacement matching and given Logan necessary supports.  \n  38 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 39 of 81 PageID #: 39\n    \n \n153.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Logan has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Logan’s case, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented years of \nadditional trauma he has suffered while in the custody of DCS. Moreover, if Defendants had \nprovided Logan with sufficient and reasonable services, he may have been able to remain in a less \nrestrictive, non-institutional setting.  \nE.  Sara O. \n154.  Sara O. is 14 years old. She first entered foster care in Indiana when she was seven \nyears old.  \n155.  When Sara was approximately three years old, her mother and father divorced and \nher mother moved to the east coast and left Sara with her father. Upon information and belief, soon \nthereafter, Sara’s father began sexually abusing her. Upon information and belief, on February 16, \n2012, when Sara was seven years old, DCS received a report of the abuse, opened an investigation, \nand removed Sara from the home. Upon information and belief, DCS filed a CHINS petition \nagainst Sara’s father, and Sara was placed in court-ordered out-of-home placement with her \npaternal grandmother. \n156.  Sara lived with her grandmother for approximately one year and was then moved \nto a non-kinship foster home. It is unknown whether the court entered a CHINS finding against \nSara’s father or criminal charges were brought against him. \n157.  In October 2013, when Sara was nine years old, DCS reunited Sara with her father. \nUpon information and belief, he began sexually abusing Sara again. In May 2014,  DCS removed \n  39 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 40 of 81 PageID #: 40\n    \n \nher from her father a second time after Sara called 911 to report the sexual abuse she was suffering. \nThe court ordered out-of-home placement for Sara. Upon information and belief, in at least one \nfoster home Sara began to display sexually maladaptive behavior towards other children.  \n158.  During the following years, upon information and belief, Sara cycled through \nnumerous non-kinship foster homes. Upon information and belief, DCS failed to arrange timely \nand  appropriate  services  for  Sara  in  each  of  these  placements,  further  failing  this  already \ntraumatized child.  \n159.  In the summer of 2015, DCS placed Sara with her Next Friend, Holly Carrow, on \nan emergency basis until a bed opened up at a residential facility. Upon information and belief, \nSara was terrified to go into the bathroom at Ms. Carrow’s home due to the abuse she suffered in \nher father’s home. Upon information and belief, at the time, DCS was working towards a plan of \nreunifying Sara with her father.  \n160.  Upon information and belief, Sara experienced at least two acute hospital stays. \nUpon  information  and  belief,  she  was  placed  at  a  private  for-profit  residential  facility  for \napproximately one year. Upon information and belief, in approximately 2015, DCS transferred \nSara to a residential private behavioral healthcare facility. Upon information and belief, at this \nfacility Sara would bang her head on the wall to the point of bleeding. \n161.  On March 22, 2016, Sara was placed in a state psychiatric hospital in Indianapolis. \nShe remained there until March 2019. Sara was initially admitted to this hospital because she was \ndisplaying aggressive, destructive, and inappropriate sexual behaviors.  \n162.  Upon information and belief, in September 2018, Sara’s treatment team at the \npsychiatric hospital determined that Sara had reached her maximum treatment benefit and was \nready to be discharged to a less restrictive setting. Upon information and belief, Sara’s FCM sought \n  40 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 41 of 81 PageID #: 41\n    \n \npermission to move Sara to a less restrictive residential setting, but did not receive approval to do \nso despite three separate requests. Upon information and belief, Sara’s FCM’s requests to transfer \nSara to a less restrictive setting were rejected because Sara is pre-adoptive and DCS wanted to \nwait until a pre-adoptive foster home became available for her. As such, DCS forced Sara to \nunnecessarily remain in a psychiatric hospital, a traumatizing experience for anyone, especially a \nneglected and abused child.  \n163.  Upon information and belief, in March 2019, DCS finally agreed to move Sara to \na group home. DCS moved Sara abruptly, with only one day’s notice, to a group home north of \nIndianapolis. Upon information and belief, staff at the psychiatric hospital had advocated that it \nwas important for DCS to implement a therapeutic transition plan when moving Sara to the group \nhome, given her fragile mental health. However, this recommendation was ignored.  \n164.  Upon information and belief, within a few weeks of moving to the group home, \nSara required emergency psychiatric hospitalization and DCS transferred her to the psychiatric \nunit of a hospital in Indianapolis. After an acute stay, on March 28, 2019, DCS placed Sara in a \nprivate secure facility in northwestern Indiana.  \n165.  Sara is diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, Child Sex Abuse, and Enuresis.  \n166.  In total, Sara has been in at least 17 different placements since becoming a ward of \nDCS.  \n167.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Sara has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Sara’s case, and not acted \n  41 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 42 of 81 PageID #: 42\n    \n \nwith deliberate indifference to her legal rights, Defendants may well have prevented further abuse \nat the hands of her father as well as years of additional trauma Sara has suffered while in the \ncustody of DCS. Moreover, if Defendants had provided Sara with sufficient and reasonable \nservices, she may have been able to remain in a less restrictive, non-institutional setting.  \nF.  Desmond C. \n168.  Desmond has been in court-ordered out-of-home placement under the custody of \nDCS for seven years. Desmond is 16 years old and currently residing, at the decision of DCS, on \nthe adult wing of a long-term care nursing home facility. \n169.  Desmond was born on May 14, 2003 and has a twin brother and younger sister. \nDesmond has limited verbal skills and requires a wheelchair. Desmond is diagnosed with autism \nspectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and dysphasia. Desmond also suffers \nseizures.  \n170.  On September 6, 2012, Desmond’s home caught fire after a methamphetamine lab \nDesmond’s parents were operating exploded. Desmond and his siblings were inside the home, \nsleeping on the living room floor, at the time of the explosion. Firefighters and law enforcement \nresponded to the scene. During their investigation, local law enforcement officers discovered drug \nparaphernalia throughout the home. DCS’s Central Intake Unit received a report alleging Desmond \nand his siblings were the victims of neglect, and DCS opened an investigation and immediately \ntook custody of the children. Desmond and his siblings were transported to the hospital for a \nroutine medical evaluation. \n171.  Desmond’s  mother  and  father  were  arrested  and  charged  with  Dealing  in \nMethamphetamine, Possession of Methamphetamine, and three counts of Neglect of a Dependent, \nalong with other related charges. They both pleaded guilty to Possession of Methamphetamine and \n  42 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 43 of 81 PageID #: 43\n    \n \nthree counts of Neglect of a Dependent. On October 16, 2013, Desmond’s father was sentenced to \n10 years in prison with a period of four years’ probation following his release. On February 28, \n2013, Desmond’s mother was sentenced to four years in prison with two years’ probation, which \nshe later violated by again using drugs.  \n172.  Desmond’s family was known to DCS prior to the September 2012 fire. On \nFebruary 8, 2010, DCS substantiated allegations that Desmond’s parents medically neglected him \nand his twin brother. The boys both have cerebral palsy, but the parents had failed to get them any \nmedical treatment for two years. That same month, Desmond’s parents entered into an Informal \nAdjustment agreement with DCS. On April 27, 2012, just months before the explosion, DCS \nunsubstantiated  a  report  that  Desmond’s  parents  were  abusing  and  manufacturing \nmethamphetamines inside their home. At that time, Desmond’s parents refused to submit to drug \nscreens.  A  few  months  later,  on  August  16,  2012,  DCS  unsubstantiated  an  allegation  that \nDesmond’s sister was found a few blocks away from the home without an adult present. On \nSeptember 1, 2012, five days before the explosion, DCS began investigating a report that Desmond \nwas found alone in the street. His parents agreed to a safety plan and to again enter into an Informal \nAdjustment. \n173.  Pursuant to DCS policy, DCS will initiate a program of Informal Adjustment when \na child neglect allegation is substantiated, the voluntary participation of the family in services is \nthe most appropriate course of action to protect the well-being of the children, the parents consent \nto the Informal Adjustment, and the court approves the Informal Adjustment. See DCS Policy, Ch. \n5, § 9, Version 8 (Mar. 1, 2019). Here, it is clear DCS failed to properly assess whether an Informal \nAdjustment was the most appropriate course of action given the evidence of drug use throughout \nthe home. Moreover, as part of an Informal Adjustment, FCMs are required to develop a safety \n  43 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 44 of 81 PageID #: 44\n    \n \nplan, which an FCM supervisor must approve, to ensure the children are safe. See id. FCMs must \nalso monitor the family’s progress. See id. \n174.  When DCS interviewed Desmond’s mother in connection with the September 6, \n2012 incident, she admitted that she had been abusing methamphetamine for the past ten years. \n175.  Following  Desmond’s  removal,  the  court  entered  a  CHINS  finding  against \nDesmond’s parents and later terminated their parental rights as to all three children. Today, \nDesmond’s parents have no contact with him. \n176.  When DCS removed the children in September 2012, DCS initially placed them \ntogether in a non-kinship foster home. Upon information and belief, the foster home was not a \ntherapeutic foster home, and DCS failed to inform the foster parents of Desmond’s disabilities, \nonly telling them that Desmond required a wheelchair for traveling long-distances.  \n177.  DCS did not tell the foster parents that Desmond was non-verbal, incontinent \n(requiring a diaper), or that he needed a wheelchair anytime he left the house. Upon information \nand belief, DCS provided no assistance in arranging transportation for Desmond to and from \nschool. In addition, upon information and belief, the foster parents were forced to take it upon \nthemselves to reach out to Desmond’s prior school to determine what accommodations he required \nat his new school. Upon information and belief, they also spoke with his past teachers to find out \nDesmond’s history—they needed to know how to meet his basic needs.  \n178.  Notably, pursuant to DCS policy, DCS is charged with obtaining education records \nfor children in out-of-home care and reviewing them to determine whether an Individualized \nEducation Program is required and to develop a plan to ensure children’s educational needs are \nmet. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 20, Version 9 (July 1, 2108); Ch. 8, § 21, Version 4 (July 1, 2108). \nUpon information and belief, DCS failed to do this for Desmond.  \n  44 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 45 of 81 PageID #: 45\n    \n \n179.  Upon information and belief, Desmond was moved to a new foster home after a \nweek because his first placement was unable to meet his needs, especially without assistance from \nDCS. Upon information and belief, Desmond’s siblings were later split up into two separate foster \nhomes. \n180.  Upon information and belief, Desmond lived at his second foster home, the home \nof his Next Friend, Mr. Foreman, for approximately four-and-a-half years. Upon information and \nbelief, DCS again failed to provide the Foremans with his complete medical history and refused \nto assist in transporting Desmond to his medical appointments, many of which were several hours \naway. Upon information and belief, Desmond underwent five surgeries in Indianapolis while he \nlived in this foster home, one of which resulted in his legs being placed in full casts for several \nweeks. Upon information and belief, DCS failed to monitor or check in on Desmond while he was \nhospitalized for his surgeries.  \n181.  DCS failed to support Desmond in other ways as well. Upon information and belief, \nDCS failed to ensure visits with Desmond’s parents were properly supervised, failed to ensure \nDesmond’s educational needs were met, and failed to ensure necessary accommodations were \nmade so Desmond could remain in his foster home. For example, upon information and belief, the \nForemans repeatedly asked DCS to have a wheelchair lift installed in their home, but DCS refused \nto do so. As Desmond grew older, it became increasingly difficult for his foster parents to lift him \nin and out of his wheelchair.  \n182.  Upon information and belief, at one point Desmond’s FCM went on leave, and no \none at DCS would approve services for Desmond during the several months she was gone. \nMoreover, upon information and belief, DCS failed to obtain a timely psychological evaluation or \narrange independent living skills training for Desmond.  \n  45 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 46 of 81 PageID #: 46\n    \n \n183.  Upon information and belief, Desmond’s foster parents, who were left without \nsupport from DCS, were forced to put in their notice, seeking to have Desmond moved from their \nhome. In response, DCS, upon information and belief, sent out a referral stating that Desmond \nrequired a higher than necessary level of care.  \n184.  As a result, two years ago, on March 17, 2017, DCS placed Desmond at a nursing \nfacility—on the adult wing. This is in violation of DCS’s policy that children be placed in the least \nrestrictive environment available to provide for their individual needs. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 1, \nVersion 10 (Jan. 1, 2019). Moreover, under DCS policy, institutional placements are only to be \nused when there are “extenuating circumstances documented that prevent the child from being \nplaced in the least restrictive, most family-like setting.” DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 4, Version 3 (Dec. \n1, 2013). \n185.  Though Desmond’s disabilities require well-coordinated and supportive care, upon \ninformation and belief, one of Desmond’s service providers experienced a six to eight month delay \nwhen initiating his services due to DCS. Additionally, upon information and belief, Desmond, who \nwas previously attending school full-time, is now only on a half-day school schedule. \n186.  Upon information and belief, Desmond has minimal, if any, contact with his sister. \nUpon information and belief, Desmond’s twin brother visits him but without DCS’s assistance or \ncoordination. Indeed, upon information and belief, during the pendency of Desmond’s CHINS \ncase, DCS has done little to ensure Desmond and his siblings maintain contact with one another.  \n187.  This is yet another violation of DCS policy, which clearly states that sibling \nvisitation should be promoted for children in foster care. See DCS Policy, Ch. 8, § 12, Version 6 \n(July 1, 2017).  Indeed, visitation plans are to include face-to-face contact with siblings at least \nonce  per  week.  See  id.  Maintaining  sibling  contact  is  critical,  because,  as  DCS  policy \n  46 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 47 of 81 PageID #: 47\n    \n \nacknowledges, “[t]he longest lasting relationship a child shares is often with his or her sibling. . . . \n[T]he ability to maintain contact with each other can help alleviate the emotional impact of removal \nfor each child.” Id. \n188.  Upon information and belief, DCS is attempting to identify an adoptive family for \nDesmond but has failed to do so thus far, leaving him to unnecessarily languish in an inappropriate, \noverly restrictive institutional setting. Desmond spends most of his time with elderly adults or \nadults with developmental disabilities that require a high level of care. He spends very little time, \nif any, with other children or anyone who does not have a disability, with the exception of his \nservice providers.  \n189.  As a direct result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Desmond has suffered and \ncontinues to suffer emotional and psychological harm. Specifically, if Defendants had made \nreasonable professional judgments, engaged in reasonable case planning and placement matching, \nnot acted in disregard of professional standards as to the management of Desmond’s case, and not \nacted with deliberate indifference to his legal rights, they may well have prevented years of \nadditional trauma he has suffered while in the custody of DCS. Moreover, if Defendants had \nprovided Desmond with sufficient and reasonable services, he may have been able to remain in a \nless restrictive, non-institutional setting. \nIII.  DCS’S SYSTEMIC FAILURES AND RESULTING HARM TO CHILDREN. \nA.  Director Bonaventura’s Resignation.  \n190.  Indiana is in dire need of an effective child welfare system.  The state is plagued by \nhigh rates of child abuse and neglect, with the third highest rate of general child maltreatment in \nthe country. It also has the fourth highest number of children in foster care in the nation. Notably, \nthe child abuse and neglect rate in Indiana has nearly doubled over the past decade. In 2017, \nIndiana had a child abuse and neglect rate of 20.8 per 1,000 children compared to only 11.9 per \n  47 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 48 of 81 PageID #: 48\n    \n \n1,000 children in 2007. Without a doubt, DCS has proven incapable of ensuring the safety and \nwell-being of the Hoosier youth.  \n191.  Former DCS Director Bonaventura highlighted the systemic issues with Indiana’s \nchild welfare system in her December 12, 2017 letter of resignation to Defendant Governor Eric \nHolcomb.  \n192.  Director Bonaventura noted that the years before her appointment “were marked \nwith conflict and strife between DCS and the provider community, including foster parents . . . .” \nLetter from Mary Beth Bonaventura, Dir. DCS, to Eric Holcomb, IN Gov. (Dec. 12, 2017). \n193.  According to Director Bonaventura, DCS distorted its data regarding staffing levels \nprior to 2013, “manipulat[ing]” the “officially reported staffing numbers . . . to the point that they \nwere nothing more than pure fantasy.” Id. \n194.  Director Bonaventura attempted to remedy DCS’s internal failures. However, \nDefendant Holcomb’s staff “cut funding and services to children in the midst of the opioid crisis,” \nthus threatening the safety, permanency and well-being of children in foster care. Id. Moreover, \naccording to Director Bonaventura, Defendant Holcomb undertook “efforts to reduce or cap” FCM \nand DCS attorney staffing, and made no attempt to collaborate with the provider community in \nsetting rates and forming licensing rules. Id. Therefore, Director Bonaventura wrote, she felt she \nwas compelled to resign, because “Hoosier children [were] being systematically placed at risk…” \nId. \nB.  The CWG Report. \n195.  The June 18, 2019 CWG report that followed Director Bonaventura’s resignation \nfound serious, systemic deficiencies within DCS. Among other things, CWG’s report noted DCS’s \nhigh removal rates; poor data collection system; uneven workloads that, at times, far exceed \n  48 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 49 of 81 PageID #: 49\n    \n \nnational caseload standards; highly centralized management that causes unnecessary delay in \nservices;  uneven  interpretation  and  implementation  of  DCS  policies  across  counties;  and \ninexperienced attorneys with high turnover rates. See CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department \nof Child Services (June 18, 2018). The CWG Report revealed that, for years, Defendants have \nproven ill-prepared and incapable of appropriately handling  reports of suspected child abuse and \nneglect.  \n196.  CWG made 17 recommendations to address DCS’s most significant challenges, \nwhich included, but were not limited to: reclaiming a family-centered practice model, which \nrequires understanding “the harmful effects of child removal and disrupted attachment for children \nas a counterbalance in considering whether removal is the safest course of action”; establishing \ncaseload  standards  of  no  more  than  17  families  for  in-home  services  and  15  children  for \nout-of-home cases; creating a small unit of data professionals to analyze the data DCS collects; \nstrengthening DCS’s quality assurance capacity; reducing the supervisor-to-caseworker ratio to \none supervisor for every five FCMs; addressing the culture of fear within DCS; developing a \nstrategy for recruiting, training, and retaining staff; decentralizing decision-making within DCS; \nassessing counties where CHINS cases remain open for lengthy periods of time; using a Medicaid \nexpert to assist DCS in maximizing the use of Medicaid for services; resolving attorney turnover \nissues; and forming better partnerships with the provider community. Id. \n197.  Defendants have been long aware of these shortcomings of Indiana’s child welfare \nsystem, but they have failed to act in a meaningful way to address the noted deficiencies.  As the \nCWG noted, “in five years, external evaluators have prepared five evaluation reports about DCS, \nrequiring much time on behalf of evaluators and DCS staff and leadership” but “[a] large number \nof these recommendations have not yet been implemented.” Id. \n  49 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 50 of 81 PageID #: 50\n    \n \nC.  DCS’s Deficient Federal Audit Results. \n198.  Federal  audits  have  consistently  revealed  flaws  with  Indiana’s  child  welfare \nsystem. Since the early 2000s, the Children’s Bureau of the United States Department of Health \nand Human Services has conducted audits of each state’s child welfare system.  These audits are \ncalled Child and Family Service Reviews (“CFSR”). As part of each CFSR, the Children’s Bureau \nconducts a review of 65 randomly-chosen cases in each state. Indiana has been evaluated three \ntimes through the CFSR process—in 2002, 2008 and 2016.  \n199.  The CFSR evaluates seven “outcomes” of the safety, well-being and permanency \nof children in foster care, which are considered the three objectives of all child welfare systems \npursuant to federal statutory law. The CFSR also reports on seven “systemic factors,” which are \npractices and structures that affect the delivery of foster care services. Taken together, these \nmetrics provide a comprehensive analysis tool for each state by identifying areas of weakness with \nthe goal of then implementing corrective actions to improve outcomes for children.   \n200.  Unfortunately, outcomes for Indiana’s children have not improved since the CFSR \nprocess was initiated.  In fact, Indiana’s performance has worsened in each subsequent CFSR.   \n201.  Indiana received its worst CFSR  in 2016,  failing to achieve any of the “outcomes” \nrelating to the permanency, safety, and well-being of children in care. During that year, Indiana \nwas in substantial conformity with just one of the seven systemic factors. See U.S. DEP’T OF \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVS., ADMIN. FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES, INDIANA FINAL REPORT (2016). \n202.  In the area of safety, the Children’s Bureau decided that “children are, first and \nforemost, protected from abuse and neglect” in only 35 percent of the cases reviewed. Id.  The \nChildren’s Bureau determined that just 30 percent of the children had “permanency and stability \nin their living situations.” Id. Indiana DCS is also struggling to provide for the well-being of \n  50 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 51 of 81 PageID #: 51\n    \n \nchildren in its care; the Children’s Bureau determined that families have “enhanced capacity to \nprovide for children’s needs” in just 33 percent of the foster care cases that were reviewed. Id.  \n203.  Indiana  has  struggled  with  many  of  the  CFSR’s  systemic  factors,  which  are \nmeasures of how the child welfare structure functions. Indiana did not achieve “conformity” on \nthe CFSR for its Case Review System, which includes items such as case plans, permanency \nhearings  and  termination  of  parental  rights  proceedings.  Id.  Indiana’s  own  internal  quality \nassurance review revealed that DCS often fails to develop written case plans in conjunction with \nparents. See id. The Children’s Bureau’s review also revealed that timely filing of termination of \nparental rights petitions are an “area of challenge” in the state. Id. \n204.  The 2016 CFSR also rated Indiana as deficient in “Service Array and Resource \nDevelopment,” as it lacked qualified service providers in a variety of areas, such as substance \nabuse, mental health, domestic violence and services to mentor youth. Id. Further, the 2016 CFSR \nfound that Indiana needed improvement on the diligent recruitment of foster and adoptive homes. \nSee id. \nD.  Inadequate Assessments and Responses to Reports of Child Abuse and \nNeglect. \n \n205.  Indiana has the third highest rate of child maltreatment in the country. According \nto  the  Children’s  Bureau  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  “Child \nMaltreatment” report, Indiana had 29,198 child victims in 2017—a 34.2 percent increase from \n2013. This represents a rate of 18.6 victims per 1,000 children—more than double the national \naverage.  \n206.  Indiana has the highest rate of court-involved maltreatment victims of any state of \nthe 41 states reporting. In 2016, over 72 percent of Hoosier child victims had court cases, compared \nwith a national average of 29 percent. In Indiana, cases are either adjudicated as a CHINS or \n  51 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 52 of 81 PageID #: 52\n    \n \nInformal Adjustment. The degree to which Indiana courts monitor Informal Adjustments depends \non the local judge, with some simply signing off on the Informal Adjustment authorization. Unlike \nother jurisdictions, DCS does not appear to enter into voluntary out-of-court agreements to provide \nservices to families, likely resulting in the state’s high rate of court involvement. \n207.  The CWG Report noted a sharp increase in the number of children in out-of-home \ncare in Indiana. From September 2005 to September 2017, DCS reported that the number of \nchildren in out-of-home care almost doubled, from 10,767 to 20,394 children. Additionally, as of \n2017, Indiana’s rate of children in out-of-home care was approximately twice the national average, \nat 13 children for every 1,000 in the state. Meanwhile, three of Indiana’s neighboring states \n(Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio) experienced decreases in the number of children in out-of-home \ncare during the same period of time.  \n208.  After the release of the CWG Report, DCS tried to reduce the number of children \nin care, appearing to focus more on the numbers than on providing meaningful services. From \nDecember 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, DCS reduced the number of open CHINS cases from \n28,502 to 23,908, a decrease of 16 percent in just one year. On December 31, 2018, DCS reported \nhaving 14,789 children in out-of-home placements, which is 1,618 fewer children than in May \n2018 and quadruple the decline over the same period in 2017. But inappropriately screening out, \nentering into Informal Adjustments rather than filing CHINS petitions, or hurriedly closing cases \nplaces children in danger of remaining in or being returned to potentially unsafe homes.   \n209.  The large number of out-of-home placements is understandable in the context of \nDCS’s involuntary removal policy, which applies when DCS “will remove a child from his or her \nparent, guardian, or custodian.” DCS Policy, Ch. 4, § 28, Version 7 (July 1, 2018). Notably, the \ngrounds  warranting  an  involuntary  removal  under  DCS  policy  closely  mimic  the  statutory \n  52 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 53 of 81 PageID #: 53\n    \n \nlanguage for finding a CHINS. CWG concluded that DCS’s policy “seems to encourage removal \nover consideration of other options that might  protect  the child while avoiding the trauma \nassociated with his or her placement outside of the family.” CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (June 18, 2018).  \n210.  While DCS often removes children inappropriately, the agency also fails to remove \nchildren and make effective safety plans when necessary. CWG’s analysis revealed that FCMs \nwould develop safety plans with substance-abusing parents and caregivers in which the parents \nwould merely promise to refrain from using drugs in the presence of their children. Several of \nthese cases involved young children and parents or other adults in the homes who were actively \nabusing opiates and methamphetamine. This is unsound safety planning, especially when parental \n“use of substances may well be beyond their control.” See CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (June 18, 2018).  \n211.  Defendants’ failures to adequately assess and respond to allegations of child abuse \nand neglect substantially depart from widely-accepted professional standards and demonstrate a \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nE.  Inadequate Child Placement Array. \n212.  Indiana lacks a sufficient placement array, i.e., the types of residential settings or \nhomes into which DCS may place a foster child,  all too often leaving children in inappropriate \nand dangerous environments.  \n213.  DCS not only has the authority to place children in residential, institutional settings, \nit also licenses those same facilities and is responsible for ensuring that minimum standards are \nmet. DCS issues licenses for (a) child care institutions (which have a capacity of over 10 youth for \nstays over 60 days); (b) emergency shelter care services (which must not exceed stays of 60 days); \n  53 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 54 of 81 PageID #: 54\n    \n \n(c) private secure facilities  (which are locked units within an institution designed to serve children \nwho are determined to be “gravely disabled” with a capacity of over 10 youth for stays over 60 \ndays); (d) group homes (which house a maximum of 10 youth for over 60 days); (e) emergency \nshelter care group homes (that provide emergency shelter care services for less than 60 days); and \n(f) licensed child placing agencies (which license and monitor some foster homes).  DCS also \nlicenses a portion of Indiana’s foster homes.  \n214.  In addition to licensing, Indiana also contracts with private providers for residential \nservices  for  children  in  foster  care,  congregate  care,  or  treatment,  including  psychiatric \nhospitalization. \n215.  Instead  of  providing  children  with  disabilities  with  access  to  in-home  or \ncommunity-based support services, DCS often places these children—and specifically those with \ndevelopmental disabilities or significant mental illness—in residential, institutional facilities. \nInstead of exploring another appropriate, less restrictive community placement, these children are \noften needlessly and inappropriately housed in highly restrictive institutional settings. These \nunnecessary  institutional  placements  create  another  significant  barrier  for  the  children’s \npermanency plan and violate the children’s right to receive services in the community. \n216.  DCS  has  also  failed  to  provide  children  with  appropriate  services  and \naccommodations  within  residential  settings  or  has  failed  to  ensure  residential  treatment  is \nappropriate for the individual child, thus subjecting children to prolonged institutionalization and \ninappropriate placements.  \n217.  Upon information and belief, while the high percentage of youth in kinship (or \nrelative) care appears laudable, many of these kinship placements are unlicensed foster homes and \nsome are beyond the realm of ordinary fictive kin (i.e., a person who knows the child but is not \n  54 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 55 of 81 PageID #: 55\n    \n \nrelated by blood, such as a godparent). Upon information and belief, DCS exercises less scrutiny \nover unlicensed relative homes. Additionally, upon information and belief, DCS at times has \ninappropriately placed children in the homes of their service providers and DCS employees, \nclassifying these homes as “kinship” placements.  \nF.  Overreliance on Institutional Placements. \n218.  Rather than correcting the licensure issues causing the shortage in residential \nplacements, DCS relies upon child caring institutions to house children for extended periods of \ntime. DCS fails to take proactive steps to move children out of institutional care even after the \nchild has met the maximum therapeutic value of the facility or in instances where the placement \nis not appropriate or therapeutic for the child.  \n219.  In June 2018, Indiana had 128 active residential treatment licenses, which included \nchild caring institutions, private secure facilities, and group homes. Upon information and belief, \napproximately nine are run by DCS county offices, 25 percent are private for-profit facilities, and \nthe remainder are private non-profit facilities. CWG found that Indiana still has a “gap in \nresources” for children who require placement at a level higher than a foster home but lower than \na residential treatment center, such as a therapeutic foster home. CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana \nDepartment of Child Services (June 18, 2018). \n220.  Often, by the time children enter residential care, they have already experienced \nmultiple placements, including kinship and non-kinship foster homes, and perhaps emergency \nshelter care placements. When youth have multiple placements, they are more likely to have \ndifficulty stabilizing. \n221.  There are a number of large child caring institutions and private secure facilities in \nIndiana. Notably, most of these accept youth from both DCS (CHINS) and probation. In fact, \n  55 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 56 of 81 PageID #: 56\n    \n \nDCS’s Juvenile Justice Program makes “all services within the DCS service array” available to \nthe county probation departments for juvenile delinquencies, including placement in residential \ntreatment facilities, group homes, and foster care. Letter from Terry Stigdon, Dir. DCS, to Jason \nDudich, Dir. State Budget Agency (Aug. 20, 2018). The CWG Report stated that DCS’s practice \nof placing CHINS and probation youth together occurs throughout Indiana, “which is counter to \nrequirements that they be placed separately.” See CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department of \nChild Services (June 18, 2018). \n222.  Title IV-E of the Social Security Act provides federal matching funds to help states, \nincluding Indiana, pay for foster care placements for children who meet certain eligibility criteria. \nIn Indiana, DCS is responsible for administering the state’s Title IV-E funds, for which both child \nwelfare and juvenile delinquency services are eligible. But facilities do not qualify for funding if \nthey are “detention facilities . . . or other facilities operated primarily for the detention of children \ndetermined to be delinquent.” National Juvenile Justice Network, Title IV-E for Youth in the \nJuvenile  Justice  System,  njjn.org,  http://www.njjn.org/uploads/digital-library/resource_425.pdf \n(last visited June 20, 2019). Concerningly, upon information and belief, some DCS-licensed \nresidential facilities house more youth sent via probation than CHINS. \n223.  Moreover, DCS relies upon potentially unsafe facilities.  Specifically, nine of \nDCS’s residential facilities are owned and operated by Acadia Healthcare, a publicly traded \nfor-profit company. One analyst recently shorted Acadia stock amid allegations that “the company \nhas concealed widespread patient abuse and neglect that results from pervasive understaffing at its \nfacilities.”  Aurelius  Value,  Acadia  Healthcare:  Destructive  Greed,  www.aureliusvalue.com, \nhttp://www.aureliusvalue.com/research/acadia-healthcare/  (last  visited  June  20,  2019).  The \n  56 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 57 of 81 PageID #: 57\n    \n \nscathing analyst report further claimed that Acadia’s “business model depends on acquiring new \nfacilities and then degrading care…” Id.  \n224.  For  instance,  Resource  Treatment  Facility,  an  Acadia-operated  facility,  has \ngarnered media attention because there were reports of violence within the facility and a large \nnumber of youth ran away. In each month between January and November 2017, there were more \nthan 35 resident-on-resident assaults and 28 resident-on-staff assaults at Resource, which only \nhoused an average of 81.9 children per month. A former employee told reporters that staff working \nwith youth with significant mental health issues were young and underqualified. Staff members \nwere often violent with children, would encourage them to fight one another, and used restraints \ndaily. This former employee also alleged that one male staff member engaged in sexual activity \nwith female residents.  \n225.   DCS has failed to take sufficient steps to ensure that children with disabilities in \nthe foster care system have access to medical and mental health and requisite support services to \nallow them to remain in the least-restrictive, most family-like setting. Instead, children with \ndisabilities are unnecessarily placed in segregated institutional treatment facilities for extended \nperiods of time, and DCS has failed to take proactive steps to integrate these children back into the \ncommunity or ensure that they are placed in healthy, therapeutic environments that can support \ntheir needs. \n226.  Further, children with disabilities that are placed by DCS within child caring \ninstitutions may be subjected to substandard care and treatment, excessive physical restraints, an \ninstitutional environment, and limited community access. The providers are allowed to continue \nthese improper practices, thus causing further traumatization, as DCS is the placement agency, \nfunding source, and is responsible for licensing and overseeing the conditions and practices. This \n  57 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 58 of 81 PageID #: 58\n    \n \nconflict of interest means that DCS has little incentive to improve the conditions as they are reliant \nupon these institutions for bed availability for children that are challenging to place.  \n227.  Children living in the residential settings have little to no autonomy over their daily \nlives. Their activities of daily living and standards for whether they have complied with treatment, \nand are thus eligible for a less restrictive setting, are restricted and limited by inflexible rules and \npolicies. Children in residential settings are subjected to blanket rights restrictions that are not \ntailored to individual needs, structured meal times, limited visitation without outside adults or \nproviders present, and restricted movement to any other location besides the facility, including \naccess to a community-based school. As a result, all aspects of their daily lives are controlled by \nthe residential provider, and they have very few, if any, meaningful opportunities to participate in \nor access the community.  \n228.  These  residential  settings  also  provide  little  opportunity  for  children  with \ndisabilities to interact with individuals without disabilities, apart from staff and case workers that \nmay do in-person visits, and they are subjected to the same conditions and restrictions as children \nthat are placed for disciplinary reasons through the juvenile justice system. \n229.  The  types  of  services  needed  to  support  children  with  disabilities  in \ncommunity-based settings already exist in DCS’s service system. However, these services are not \nimplemented in a consistent or timely manner, nor are they sufficiently provided to meet the needs \nof children who are unnecessarily institutionalized or those at serious risk of institutionalization. \nWith reasonable modifications, including expansion of the capacity to provide existing services, \nreallocation of funds from institutions to community integration services, and additional training \nand support to FCMs working with children with disabilities, Indiana would be able to meet the \n  58 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 59 of 81 PageID #: 59\n    \n \nneeds of children with disabilities or significant behavioral needs in a less restrictive environment \nthan institutionalization. \n230.  These failures in Indiana’s use of residential placements substantially depart from \nwidely-accepted professional standards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the risk of \nharm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nG.  Foster Home Shortage. \n231.  Indiana has also  failed to recruit and retain an adequate number and range of foster \nparents. Indeed, over the past few years, media outlets have reported a dire shortage of foster \nhomes in Indiana.   \n232.  DCS is responsible for licensing all foster homes, and licenses are issued for \nfour-year periods. Both DCS and the licensed child placing agencies find foster homes for children \nand manage and train foster families. Licensed child placing agencies also train foster parents for \nfoster children with disabilities and therapeutic foster home licenses. \n233.  In Indiana, the timeframes for attaining foster home licensures vary by region. \nMany regions suffer from lengthy administrative delays. One county allegedly told foster parents \nit takes a year because they lack sufficient staff to process the licenses.  \n234.  As a result of Indiana’s foster home shortage, DCS often has nowhere to place \nchildren. Children are forced to sleep in local DCS offices, sent to emergency shelter care for \nextended periods of time, placed unnecessarily in an institution, or placed in foster homes that are \nfilled past their licensed capacity limits.  \n235.  The shortage of foster homes means that children are frequently placed far from \ntheir homes. In November 2017, nearly 35 percent of children were placed outside of their home \ncounties. The problem is more acute in rural areas, with nearly half of children placed in other \n  59 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 60 of 81 PageID #: 60\n    \n \ncounties. The CWG Report found that some children are placed three-to-five hours away from \ntheir home communities and schools. This inhibits children from maintaining meaningful contact \nwith their families and support networks. Lengthy travel is also burdensome to caseworkers, who \nare required to see children monthly.  \n236.  These failures in Indiana’s use and number of foster homes substantially depart \nfrom widely accepted professional standards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the risk \nof harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nH.  Emergency Shelter Care. \n237.  DCS places children in emergency shelter care—a short-term placement that is \nmeant to provide temporary, 24-hour care—far too often and for far too long. Because Indiana \nlacks sufficient resources to handle the increased volume of children in its care, when children are \nremoved from their homes, they are often placed in inappropriate or inadequate temporary \nplacements. These are typically group or institutional facilities, upon information and belief, \nsometimes with a separate designated area for emergency shelter care beds.  \n238.  According to DCS policy, emergency shelter care stays must not exceed 20 days \nwithout approval. The emergency shelter facility or Local Office Director can request an extension \nif DCS has not identified a permanent placement for the child at the end of 20 days. DCS policy \nalso mandates that DCS must seek court approval for all emergency shelter care placements within \n48  hours  of  a  child  entering  such  a  facility.  DCS  policy  imposes  additional  restrictions, \nrecommending that no children under the age of 10 be placed in emergency shelter care. \n239.  In contravention of these legal and policy requirements, DCS unnecessarily places \nchildren of all ages in emergency shelter care.  Overburdened FCMs have insufficient time to \nengage in meaningful case planning and placement matching, and Indiana lacks an adequate array \n  60 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 61 of 81 PageID #: 61\n    \n \nof  placements.  As  a  result,  children  are  placed  in  emergency  shelter  care,  thus  needlessly \nsubjecting them to institutionalization for extended periods of time.   \n240.  For example, Plaintiffs Ashley W. and Betty W. lived in emergency shelter care for \nmonths when they were toddlers, which is against DCS policy’s minimum age requirement. Logan \nwas also placed in emergency shelter care as a nine-year-old.  \n241.  Moreover, providers offering emergency shelter care are regularly forced to request \nplacement extensions as a result of DCS’s failure to identify appropriate long-term placements \nwithin 20 days.  Due to DCS’s failures, children often remain in these temporary placements for \nmonths. Upon information and belief, some of these youth, especially teens, are left at the facilities \nand transitioned from emergency shelter care beds to long-term residential beds at the same \ninstitution when DCS is unable to identify placements for them.  \n242.  DCS’s overreliance on  emergency shelter care  defies extensive evidence and \nguidance in the child welfare field about the importance of minimizing institutional care for \nchildren.    Moreover,  these  temporary  emergency  shelter  care  placements  mark  yet  another \nplacement for children, despite undisputed best practices in the child welfare field to minimize the \nnumber of placements. \n243.  Children in emergency shelter care are at increased risk of educational and service \ndisruptions  as  well.  This  becomes  increasingly  problematic  the  longer  children  are  left  in \nemergency shelter care. Children who are not in school or remain without services fall further \nbehind, and it is challenging for them to catch up to where they were when their education and \nservices resume. \n  61 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 62 of 81 PageID #: 62\n    \n \n244.  These failures in Indiana’s use of emergency shelter care substantially depart from \nwidely-accepted professional standards and demonstrate a deliberate indifference to the risk of \nharm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent. \nI.  Defendants Fail to Adequately Train, Supervise and Retain Caseworkers.  \n245.  While many FCMs undoubtedly want to help children and their families, FCMs in \nIndiana face many obstacles that prevent them from effectively performing their critical job \nfunctions.  \n246.  In Indiana, FCMs bear case management responsibilities for out-of-home CHINS \ncases. FCMs must assess family needs regarding child safety and well-being, identify service \nneeds, make referrals for services, work with families and service providers to assess progress, and \nprovide necessary information to the court. \n247.  FCMs in Indiana experience low morale and repeatedly described a “culture of \nfear” at DCS. CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department of Child Services (June 18, 2018). \nEven more alarming, some FCMs reported to CWG that they did not feel safe to “tell the truth.” \nId. They reported feeling unable to bend policy, even if they thought it would lead to better \noutcomes.  \n248.  Moreover, FCMs reported that “DCS does not have a learning culture,” and that \nthey fear supervisors will punish them for acknowledging any lack of knowledge or skills or for \nasking for help. Id. \n249.  Not surprisingly, this translates to a high turnover rate within DCS. As of March \n2018, FCM turnover at 12 months was 30.4 percent. A 2017 report found that more than half of \nFCMs who leave DCS do so within the first two years.  See id. And CWG found that “[h]igh levels \n  62 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 63 of 81 PageID #: 63\n    \n \nof turnover, especially  among  FCMs,  was  among the most commonly  cited themes in  the \ninterviews conducted over the course of the review.” Id. \n250.  There  are  many  reasons  for  this  high  rate  of  FCM  turnover,  including \nunmanageable workloads, lack of support, required on-call and overtime work, and pay that is \nincommensurate with the demands of the job.  \n251.  High FCM turnover leaves families in a “chronic state of re-introduction and \nre-assessment.”  Id.  High  turnover  also  creates  discontinuity  of  services.  When  FCMs  are \ninexperienced, poorly trained, and overwhelmed with unmanageable caseloads, permanency is \n“lost in the mix.” Id.  \n252.  Indiana’s high turnover rate for FCMs has significant negative consequences for \nthe  children  in  foster  placements  and  institutional  settings.  Research  has  shown  that  high \ncaseworker  turnover  is  strongly  correlated  with  children  experiencing  multiple  placements, \nreceiving fewer services, remaining in foster care longer, and failing to achieve permanency. In \naddition, FCMs reported that high rates of turnover and “the constant state of cases being \nre-assigned is a stressor.” Id. FCMs acknowledge that turnover negatively affects families, “as \n[FCMs] were regularly sent to work with families who had just established a relationship with the \nprior FCM[s].” Id. Birth parents reflected this sentiment, expressing frustration that they had to \n“start over” with each subsequent FCM. Id.  \n253.  Additionally, many FCMs in Indiana carry higher-than-standard and statutorily \nmandated caseloads. Until June 2019, FCMs were prohibited under state law from carrying \ncaseloads involving more than 17 children. As of June 13, 2019, with the passage of new \nlegislation, that number was reduced to 13 children in out-of-home placement. Despite this, in \n2018, CWG found that FCMs commonly carry caseloads of 25 to 35 children. CWG even found \n  63 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 64 of 81 PageID #: 64\n    \n \nthat one FCM had a caseload of 52 children, several of whom were placed several hours away. \nThe CWG created a DCS weighted caseload management report for May 2018, which revealed \nthat an additional 421 caseworkers are required in order to meet Child Welfare League of America \ncaseload standards.   \n254.  DCS has recently reported that it is now 99 percent compliant with caseload \nstandards and has reduced FCM turnover by 18.7 percent in the past year. Notably, however, FCM \nturnover is still extremely high—with a quarter of the FCMs turning over in 2018, even after many \nFCMs received salary raises in 2018. Additionally, year after year, studies have pointed to high \ncaseloads and high turnover within DCS, but DCS repeatedly failed to find sustainable solutions. \nAfter the CWG Report was publicized, DCS hurriedly found ways to improve its caseload and \nemployment statistics, but, if the past is any indicator of future performance, the recent fixes are \nlikely not long-term solutions. And, even if DCS’s problematic caseloads were resolved, many \nother issues remain with Indiana’s child welfare system.  \n255.  Moreover, the already overwhelmed FCMs are subjected to further stress from \nDCS’s highly centralized structure, which requires them to constantly seek approvals during the \npendency of their cases. This organizational structure causes delays in cases, as FCMs often lack \nauthority  to  make  decisions  or  offer  services.  Instead,  parties  must  wait  for  DCS  upper \nmanagement or the central office to make decisions regarding case planning. For instance, even \nwhere there are compelling reasons not to terminate parental rights, some Local Office Directors \nrequire Regional Managers to approve casework recommendations for children who have been in \nfoster care 15 out of the last 22 months, causing even further delays. Delays in these cases put \nfamilies, who are already on the brink of permanently separating, at significant risk of harm. \n  64 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 65 of 81 PageID #: 65\n    \n \n256.  Defendants’ failure to employ a sufficient number of caseworkers and qualified \nsupervisors, and failure to adequately train them and ensure that they carry reasonable caseloads, \nsubstantially departs from widely accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nJ.  Inadequate Case Planning and Insufficient Services. \n257.  DCS’s high staff turnover and high caseloads have and continue to impair effective \ncase planning.   \n258.  Upon information and belief, many children in Indiana foster care do not receive \nappropriate case plans that fully comply with the federal requirements for such plans, such as the \nrequirements that they include a discussion of how the case plan is designed to achieve a safe \nplacement for a child in the least restrictive and most family-like setting, a description of services \noffered, and documentation of the steps required to finalize a placement when the goal is adoption \nor another permanent home. See 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(g). Furthermore, children may not receive \nnecessary services that are recommended in their case plans due to (i) Defendants’ failure to make \ntimely  referrals  and  (ii)  FCM’s  excessive  caseloads,  which  preclude  them  from  effectively \nmanaging each child’s case effectively.  \n259.  FCMs rarely adhere to the practice model concerning Child and Family Team \nMeetings (“CFTMs”), which are meetings in which DCS and service providers discuss the \nprogress of the case and families’ goals. \n260.  Under DCS policy, CFTMs are held at “critical junctures throughout the life” of a \ncase, which can include assessing the need for a removal, developing a case plan, revising a \npermanency plan prior to court, safety and service planning, changing a permanency plan to \nanother planned, permanent living arrangement for older youth, or changing a placement. DCS \n  65 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 66 of 81 PageID #: 66\n    \n \nPolicy, Ch. 5, § 7, Version 5 (July 1, 2015). DCS often fails to prepare families for CFTMs and \nfails to communicate the purpose of the meetings.  \n261.  Some families reported to CWG that their planning consisted of FCMs simply \ndoling out directives, rather than asking for their input. Other parties, including foster parents, \ntherapists, extended family, and CASAs are frequently excluded from the meetings. Providers also \nreported that DCS regularly fails to include them in CFTMs; when DCS does include them, DCS \nrushes through CFTMs in court or immediately before or following hearings. CWG reported that \nrelatives, providers, community resources, educators, and perhaps alleged or legal fathers and \npaternal relatives were usually not involved in CFTMs.  \n262.   Providers estimated that CFTMs occurred in only 50 percent of key decisions. \nInstead, important issues surfaced in court.  \n263.  Moreover,  CWG  noted  that  FCMs  failed  to  conduct  comprehensive  family \nfunctional assessments during the case planning process. This leaves FCMs without critical \ninformation regarding families’ needs, which hampers their ability to make meaningful service \nreferrals.  \n264.  Defendants’  failure  to  engage  in  adequate  and  meaningful  case  planning \nsubstantially departs from widely-accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate \nindifference to the risk of harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nK.  Poor Placement Matching. \n265.  DCS  further  harms  children  by  often  placing  them  in  inappropriate  foster \nplacements that are ill-equipped to meet their needs. Upon information and belief, DCS fails to \nengage in effective placement matching, instead hurriedly placing youth in the first available \nplacement.   \n  66 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 67 of 81 PageID #: 67\n    \n \n266.  Foster parents report that FCMs have failed to provide them with accurate or \npertinent information about children before placing them in their homes. Foster parents are \ntherefore unprepared to meet the children’s needs, which ultimately increases the likelihood of \nplacement instability.  \n267.  The named Plaintiffs’ experiences, described in detail above, illustrate how poor \nsupport in a foster home might lead to instability, whereby children are shuffled from foster \nplacement to foster placement.  For instance, DCS placed Logan in multiple foster homes and \npre-adoptive homes without fully informing those placements about his history and needs. DCS \nalso  failed to consider the most appropriate  type of home that would best support Logan’s needs \nand his disability. As a result, many of Logan’s placements failed, further traumatizing him. \n268.  Upon information and belief, DCS also pushes premature trial home visits. This \npractice only re-traumatizes children if the trial home visits fail and DCS has to conduct another \nremoval. And, as with Plaintiffs Ashley W. and Betty W., inappropriate trial home visits may place \nchildren at risk of harm.  \n269.  DCS frequently, and often abruptly, moves the foster children in its custody from \nplacement to placement.  For instance, Ashley, Betty, Sara, and Logan have all been in well over \na dozen different placements since becoming wards of DCS.  Placement changes negatively impact \nchildren’s education, therapy, and access to services.  \n270.  Shuffling children from foster placement to foster placement negatively affects \ntheir well-being in other ways too. Children are sometimes transferred to new placements with no \nexplanation of where they are or why. This degree of turbulence and uncertainty can lead to \nemotional trauma and attachment disorders, and causes children to have feelings of instability and \n  67 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 68 of 81 PageID #: 68\n    \n \ninsecurity. Frequent moves may also result in children losing contact with their siblings, relatives, \ncommunity supports, friends, and other adults in their lives.  \n271.  Defendants’ failure to ensure placement stability to children substantially departs \nfrom widely-accepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk \nof harm to the Plaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nL.  Insufficient and Ineffective Services. \n272.  Federal law requires states to provide a continuum of services, such as mental \nhealth treatment, visitation, domestic violence victim support and batterer intervention, and drug \nscreening, in order to protect and promote the welfare of children; prevent the neglect, abuse and \nexploitation of children; support at-risk families through services that allow children to safely \nremain with their families or return home in a timely manner; promote the safety, permanency, \nand well-being of children in foster care; and provide training, professional development, and \nsupport to ensure a well-qualified child welfare workforce. See 42 U.S.C. § 621. \n273.  Despite the high number of contracted community-based service providers, Indiana \nlacks a sufficient array of services necessary to meet the needs of children and families involved \nwith its child welfare system. Further, FCMs fail to ensure that children access services that are \navailable in a timely manner, contrary to legal requirements. Hoosier children and their families \noften remain on waiting lists for services, or are never referred at all. Accurate and necessary \ninformation about children’s circumstances, including medical and social histories as well as \nspecial needs, are withheld from foster parents or residential providers. \n274.  Services  are  critical  to  the  well-being  of  children  in  DCS  custody,  who  are \nparticularly vulnerable for a number of reasons. Children in foster care have often experienced \nsevere and chronic trauma and may have been exposed to other stressors, such as extreme poverty \n  68 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 69 of 81 PageID #: 69\n    \n \nor parental substance abuse. Research shows that children exposed to repeated traumatic stress or \npervasive neglect, including children removed from their homes due to allegations of abuse or \nneglect,  manifest  increased  physical,  psychological,  and  emotional  problems  later  in  life. \nTraumatic foster care experiences, without adequate services, only compound these problems. \n275.  In Indiana, FCMs often fail to ensure children are assessed and receive necessary \nservices in a timely manner. Rather, FCMs often abdicate these responsibilities to foster parents, \nrelying on them to proactively seek or request services without DCS oversight or guidance.  \n276.  In the 2016 CFSR, the Children’s Bureau found severe service gaps for substance \nabuse, mental health, domestic violence and youth mentoring. See U.S. DEP’T OF HEALTH AND \nHUMAN SERVS., ADMIN. FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES, INDIANA FINAL REPORT (2016). In the areas \nfor which services are offered, upon information and belief, many of the service providers, \nincluding those providing mental health services, are ineffective and of poor quality. Nevertheless, \nDCS continues to renew contracts with these substandard service providers. \n277.  The CWG Report noted that some FCMs think they cannot or should not request \nservices for CHINS.  Further, a group of FCMs said that home-based services were “not allowed \nanymore.” CWG, Evaluation of the Indiana Department of Child Services (June 18, 2018). CWG \nfound that “[m]any FCM’s were repeatedly uneasy about requesting or approving services.” Id. \nReviewers heard that this wariness was rooted in a lack of autonomy perceived by the FCMs, \ncoupled with heightened scrutiny around local spending in particular. \n278.  FCMs reported that it takes weeks to complete certain referrals, waitlists are months \nlong, and some services are long distances away. CWG concluded, “one thing was obvious: the \nFCMs do not have a clear sense of what treatment is and isn’t available; whether it can be paid for \nby DCS; and what is occurring at the leadership level to combat addiction.” Id. Concerningly, \n  69 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 70 of 81 PageID #: 70\n    \n \n“FCMs may also be expected to administer drug tests, a duty that raises serious concerns . . . \nregarding family engagement and blurring of roles.” Id.  \n279.  Effective services are especially lacking for members of the ADA Subclass, who \nare put at increased risk of institutionalization when their needs are left unmet. For instance, Sara \nwas shuffled from foster home to foster home and did not receive effective therapy or other forms \nof treatment to address the sexual abuse she has repeatedly suffered, and Desmond has been forced \nto live in an adult-nursing home instead of a foster home because of DCS’s failure to provide \nin-home supports to accommodate his disability.   \n280.  Defendants’ failure to provide necessary services to children and parents impedes \nreunification efforts, because children are either unable to return home, or they are returned home \nbefore the issues that led to their removal are adequately addressed.  \n281.  Defendants’ failure to provide necessary services substantially departs from widely \naccepted professional standards and demonstrates a deliberate indifference to the risk of harm to \nPlaintiffs and the classes they represent.  \nM.  Lack of Permanency.  \n282.  Permanent  homes  and  families  are  critical  to  ensuring  a  child’s  healthy \ndevelopment. Research shows that children suffer when they grow up in state custody without \nachieving permanency.  \n283.  But the length of time children in out-of-home placements in Indiana wait to \nachieve permanency has increased over the years.  \n284.  As of May 27, 2018, 5,897 Hoosier children’s case plans included adoption as a \ngoal. But only 143 children of those children were adopted in the six months between October \n2017 and March 2018. \n  70 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 71 of 81 PageID #: 71\n    \n \n285.  Indiana’s low adoption rate is partially a result of DCS’s ineffective legal division. \nThe legal division is staffed with attorneys who represent the agency in child welfare legal \nproceedings, including CHINS and termination of parental rights proceedings. But the DCS legal \nworkforce suffers from a high turnover rate, persistent vacancies, and inexperienced employees. \nThis results in “inconsistent availability of consistent and good quality legal consultation to case \nmanagers and…continuances of scheduled court hearings as well as delayed filing for termination \nof parental rights when reunification efforts have been unsuccessful.” Id. \n286.  Last summer, the Indiana Court of Appeals rebuked DCS regarding its handling of \nproceedings involving the termination of parental rights. On July 9, 2018, the Indiana Court of \nAppeals issued an Order noting a “disturbing trend” with nine cases it had received in the prior six \nmonths. A.A. v. Ind. Dep’t of Child Servs., 100 N.E.3d 708, 709 (Ind. Ct. App. 2018). In these \ncases, parents appealed the termination of their parental rights, and DCS moved for the cases to be \nremanded to the trial court, conceding DCS had violated the parents’ due process rights. Id. The \ncourt  wrote,  “[t]he  increasing  frequency  of  these  motions  suggest  that  there  are  repeated, \nsignificant violations of due process occurring in termination of parental rights cases throughout \nthis state.” Id. The Court went so far as to “formally admonish DCS for its failure to afford litigants \nthroughout this state the due process rights they are owed.” Id.  \n287.  This serious mishandling of termination of parental rights matters harms not only \nparents but also children, who are left languishing in foster care as the legal proceedings are \nunnecessarily drawn out. \n288.  Indiana’s failure to provide children with permanent homes within a reasonable \nperiod of time is a direct result of Defendants’ failure to bring and appropriately litigate termination \nof parental rights proceedings; failure to secure adoptive homes for children on paths to adoption; \n  71 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 72 of 81 PageID #: 72\n    \n \nand failure to remedy structural and systemic deficiencies that have negatively affected Indiana’s \nfoster care system for years.  \n289.  DCS’s failure to ensure Plaintiff children are placed in permanent homes within a \nreasonable period of time substantially departs from professional judgment and demonstrates a \ndeliberate indifference to the risk of harm to Plaintiff children and the classes they represent.  \nCAUSES OF ACTON \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nSubstantive Due Process under the U.S. Constitution \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n290.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein.  \n291.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution to provide reasonable care to, and to protect from harm, a child with whom it has \nformed a special relationship. \n292.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of accepted professional judgment \nand amounts to deliberate indifference to the constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests \nof all of the members of the General Class. Defendants are well aware of the policies and practices \nin place, which prevent these class members from receiving adequate protection from physical and \npsychological harm after the State has formed a special relationship with them. As a result, the \nnamed Plaintiffs and all of the members of the class of children to whom the state owes a special \nduty, children who have a special relationship with Defendants, including wards of DCS, have \nbeen, and are, at risk of being deprived of their substantive due process rights conferred upon them \nby the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  \n293.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: \n  72 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 73 of 81 PageID #: 73\n    \n \na.  the right to investigations of maltreatment that conform with reasonable \nprofessional standards; \nb.  the right to conditions and duration in foster care reasonably related to the \npurpose of government custody; \nc.  the right to freedom from maltreatment, and repeated maltreatment, while \nunder the protective supervision of the State; \nd.  the  right  to  protection  from  unnecessary  intrusions  into  the  child’s \nemotional well-being once the State has established a special relationship \nwith the child; \ne.  the right to services necessary to prevent unreasonable risk of harm; \nf.  the right to treatment and care consistent with the purpose and assumptions \nof government custody; and \ng.  the right  not  to  be maintained in  custody longer than is  necessary to \naccomplish the purpose to be served by taking a child into government \ncustody. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n294.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n295.  Plaintiffs and the class members they represent are in Defendants’ custody or \nguardianship  and  are  wholly  dependent  on  Defendants  to  provide  for  their  basic  physical, \npsychological,  and emotional needs, and to  protect  them from  physical,  psychological,  and \nemotional harm. \n  73 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 74 of 81 PageID #: 74\n    \n \n296.  Children frequently and foreseeably suffer physical, psychological, and emotional \nharm in DCS custody. They suffer harm in part because, in sharp contrast with the ideal of a stable \nand permanent home and family, they are continually shuttled between temporary and often \nnon-familial custodial arrangements.  Professional judgment and standards of conduct require the \nDefendants to make reasonable efforts toward placing children in their care in stable, permanent \nhomes and families.  \n297.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom that is inconsistent with the exercise of professional judgment and amounts \nto deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs and the members of the General \nClass.  \n298.  By failing to take all reasonable efforts toward fostering familial association and \nsecuring a permanent home and family for the named Plaintiffs and the class members they \nrepresent, Defendants have failed to protect them from psychologically and emotionally harmful \nshuttling between temporary living arrangements.  \n299.  As a result, the named Plaintiffs and all of the members of the General Class have \nbeen, and are at risk of being, deprived of the right to familial association and reasonable protection \nfrom psychological and emotional harm while in Defendants’ custody, in violation of the First \nAmendment’s right of association, the Ninth Amendment’s reservation of rights to the people, and \nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive due process protections.  \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nThe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq. \n(Asserted by the General Class Against Defendants) \n300.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n  74 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 75 of 81 PageID #: 75\n    \n \n301.  The foregoing actions and inactions of Defendants constitute a policy, pattern, \npractice, and/or custom of depriving the named Plaintiffs and the classes they represent of the \nrights contained in the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoptive and Safe Families \nAct of 1997, to: \na.  a written case plan that includes a plan to provide safe, appropriate, and \nstable placements, 42 U.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A); \nb.  a written case plan that ensures that the child receives safe and proper case \nmanagement while in foster care and implementation of that plan, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16, 675(1)(B); \nc.  a written case plan that ensures provision of services to parents, children, \nand foster parents to facilitate reunification, or where that is not possible, \nthe permanent placement of the child and implementation of that plan, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(B); and \nd.  a case review system in which each child has a case plan designed to \nachieve safe and appropriate foster care placements in the least restrictive \nand most family-like setting, closest to their home community, 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 671(a)(16), 675(1)(A). \n302.  These provisions of the Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997, are clearly intended to benefit Plaintiffs and the classes they \nrepresent; the rights conferred are neither vague nor amorphous such to strain judicial competence; \nand the statute imposes a binding obligation on the states. 42 U.S.C. § 1983; see also Henry A. v. \nWillden, 678 F.3d 991, 1008-09 (9th Cir. 2012).  \n \n  75 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 76 of 81 PageID #: 76\n    \n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nAmerican with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act \n(Asserted by the ADA Subclass Against Defendants) \n303.  Each of the foregoing allegations is incorporated as if fully set forth herein. \n304.  Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and \nits enabling regulations, 28 C.F.R. 35.101 et seq., prohibit discrimination against individuals with \ndisabilities.  \n305.  ADA  Subclass  Plaintiffs  have  behavioral,    developmental  and  psychiatric \ndisabilities, which qualify them as individuals with disabilities within the meaning of the ADA, \n42  U.S.C.  §  12132(2)  and  “otherwise  qualified  individuals  with  a  disability”  under  the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794; 29 U.S.C. § 705(20). They meet the essential eligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of foster care services provided by DCS. \n306.  Defendants are public entities, or public officials of a public entity, subject to the \nprovisions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132(1)(A). Such entities also receive federal financial \nassistance and are thus subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b); \n34 C.F.R. 104.51. Defendants Holcomb and Stigdon are sued in their official capacities as state \nofficials responsible for administering and/or supervising Indiana programs and activities related \nto foster care services.  \n307.  Title II of the ADA prohibits a public entity from excluding a person with a \ndisability from participating in, or denying the benefits of, the goods, services, programs and \nactivities of the entity or otherwise discriminating against a person on the basis of his or her \ndisability. \n  76 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 77 of 81 PageID #: 77\n    \n \n308.  Likewise,  the  Rehabilitation  Act  and  its  enabling  regulations  prohibit \ndiscrimination in the provision of services by any entity receiving federal funding. 34 C.F.R. \n104.4(b)(1)(ii), (b)(2); 34 C.F.R. 104.52(a)(2).  \n309.  Under the regulations enforcing the ADA, the state may not “[p]rovide a qualified \nindividual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal \nopportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of \nachievement as that provided to others . . . .” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). \n310.  Accordingly, DCS must provide children with disabilities an equal opportunity to \naccess foster care services, in the least restrictive appropriate setting, as it provides to children \nwithout disabilities in its custody.  \n311.  Moreover, Defendants have an affirmative duty to “make reasonable modifications \nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination \non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications \nwould  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  the  service,  program,  or  activity.”  28  C.F.R. \n§ 35.130(b)(7). \n312.  As set forth above, the regulatory hallmark and guiding force of disability law is \nthe provision of services, including the child’s placement in the most integrated environment \nappropriate to the youth’s needs. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d); 34 C.F.R. 104.4(b)(2); see also Olmstead \nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 602 (1999).  \n313.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violations of Title II of the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiffs have been or are at risk of being placed in overly restrictive \nsettings and subjected to unnecessary trauma because of their disabilities, as set forth above, and \n  77 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 78 of 81 PageID #: 78\n    \n \nwill continue to suffer injury until Defendants are required to, and have, come into compliance \nwith the requirements of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Honorable Court: \nI.  Assert jurisdiction over this action; \nII.  Order the Plaintiff Children may maintain this action as a class action pursuant to \nRule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; \nIII.  Pursuant  to  Rule  57  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  declare \nunconstitutional and unlawful: \na.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s right to be free from harm \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; \nb.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under the First, Ninth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; \nc.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under the Adoption \nAssistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended by the Adoption \nand Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. § 670 et seq.;  \nd.  Defendants’ violation of Plaintiff Children’s rights under Title II of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and the \nRehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794.; and,  \nIV.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting Plaintiff Children to practices that \nviolate their rights, including: \na.  Enjoin  Defendants  from  failing  to  maintain  caseloads  for  all  workers \nproviding  direct  supervision  and  planning  for  children  at  accepted \n  78 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 79 of 81 PageID #: 79\n    \n \nprofessional standards, as developed by either the COA and/or the CWLA, \nor a workload analysis conducted by DCS. Require that DCS periodically \nverify that it is meeting and maintaining the applicable caseload standards, \nand that its verification process and the results shall be public information;  \nb.  Enjoin Defendants from investigating, creating, and maintaining Informal \nAdjustments  of  children  reported  for  maltreatment  without  thorough, \nadequate, and professionally acceptable investigations and provision of \nnecessary services; \nc.  Enjoin defendants from failing to conduct an emergency evaluation of all \nchildren who enter foster care within 72 hours  to determine their immediate \nfoster care needs, and from failing to conduct a full and comprehensive \nevaluation of their placement needs no later than 30 days after they enter \nfoster care to ensure that the children are matched with the most appropriate \nplacement; \nd.  Enjoin defendants from separating siblings when they enter foster care \ntogether unless it is contrary to the best interests of any of the children to be \nplaced together with his or her siblings; \ne.  Enjoin defendants from failing to provide all necessary services to each \nchild who enters foster care, including necessary services to the child’s \nparents  to  ensure  a  speedy  reunification  for  as  long  as  the  child’s \npermanency plan remains reunification;  \nf.  Enjoin defendants from placing any child in a congregate care setting based \non the unavailability of foster home resources; \n  79 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 80 of 81 PageID #: 80\n    \n \ng.  Enjoin defendants from failing to file and proceed with a timely petition to \nfree a child for adoption when the child’s permanency plan is adoption; \nh.  Enjoin defendants from failing to take all necessary steps to seek and secure \nan appropriate adoptive placement for a child when the child’s plan is \nadoption; \ni.  Require that DCS conduct annual case record reviews of a statistically \nsignificant sample of children in DCS custody to measure the degree to \nwhich  children  in  DCS  custody  are  receiving  timely  permanence,  as \nrequired by state and federal law, and the degree to which they are being \nmaltreated in care; the degree to which placement stability is maintained for \nthese children, and issue annual public reports on the findings of these case \nrecord reviews; and \nj.  Appoint a neutral monitor to oversee compliance with the terms of this \nCourt’s order.  \nV.  Award Plaintiff Children the reasonable costs and expenses incurred to litigate this \naction, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920 and 42 \nU.S.C. § 1988, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(e) and (h).  \nVI.  Grant such other and further equitable relief as the Court deems just, necessary and \nproper to protect Plaintiff Children from further harm while in Defendant Stigdon’s \ncustody in foster care.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  80 \n\nCase 3:19-cv-00129-RLY-MPB   Document 1   Filed 06/25/19   Page 81 of 81 PageID #: 81\n    \n \nDated: June 25, 2019 \n \n \n            Respectfully submitted, \n \n \ns/ Melissa Keyes    \nMelissa Keyes, No. 30152-49 \nNikki Gray, No. 31209-49 \nIndiana Disability Rights \n4701 North Keystone Avenue, Suite 222 \nIndianapolis, Indiana 46205 \nTel.: (317) 722-5555 \nFax: (317) 722-5564 \nmkeyes@indianadisabilityrights.org  \nngray@indianadisabilityrights.org  \n \nMarica Lowry, pro hac vice pending \nAnastasia Benedetto, pro hac vice pending \nA Better Childhood \n355 Lexington Avenue, Floor 16 \nNew York, NY 10017 \nTel.: (646) 795-4456 \nFax: (212) 692-0415 \nmlowry@abetterchildhood.org \nabenedetto@abetterchildhood.org   \n \nAaron Marks, pro hac vice pending \nCarrie Bodner, pro hac vice pending \nKara Cheever, pro hac vice pending \nKirkland & Ellis, LLP \n601 Lexington Avenue \nNew York, NY 10022 \nTel.: (212) 446-4800 \nFax: (212) 446-4900 \naaron.marks@kirkland.com \ncarrie.bodner@kirkland.com \nkara.cheever@kirkland.com  \n \nKristen Bokhan, pro hac vice pending \nKirkland & Ellis, LLP \n1301 Pennsylvania Avenue N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20004 \nTel.: (202) 389-5000 \nFax: (202) 389-5200 \nkristen.bokhan@kirkland.com  \n  81 ",
