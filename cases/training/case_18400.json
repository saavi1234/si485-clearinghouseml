    "summary": "<p>On Aug. 6, 2019, Plaintiffs Christopher Meyer, Sarah Meyer, and the National Federation of the Blind, Inc. filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District Of Indiana. &nbsp;The suit alleged systemic violations of the civil rights of blind Indiana residents that denied them equally effective access to all print and website communications created or distributed by Defendants and their contractors concerning government benefits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that these communications violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (&ldquo;ADA&rdquo;) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (&ldquo;Section 504&rdquo;). Specifically, the complaint cited communications related to the application, eligibility, receipt, and administration of HIP (Medicaid), SNAP, and other state benefit programs, stating that defendants and their contractors provided such communications only in standard print and on inaccessible websites. The suit named as defendants Jennifer Walthall, in her official capacity as Secretary of The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, and Adrienne Shields, in her official capacity as Director of The Indiana Division of Family Resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs were represented by Indiana Protection and Advocacy Service, Brown, Goldstein &amp; Levy, LLP and the Law Office of Jana Eisinger, PLLC. Defendants were represented by the Indiana Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney fees. They requested a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from violating Title II of the ADA and Section 504, and requiring Defendants to ensure that Plaintiffs have equally effective access to all information Defendants provide to Indiana residents. Specifically, plaintiffs requested equal access to all print communications in appropriately secure formats that are accessible to blind users; remediation of state websites so that they provide equally effective communication to blind users; and the &nbsp;implementation of policy changes to ensure the consistent and affirmative provision of alternative formats to blind individuals going forward.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to the Honorable Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson who set a trial date of April 19, 2021. &nbsp;The parties appeared on May 21, 2020 for a status conference to address three discovery disputes, which the court resolved. On Oct. 6, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and Defendants replied with a cross motion on Nov. 4, 2020. &nbsp;On March 25, 2021, the court denied the Motion for Summary Judgment and set the following issues as remaining for trial: 1) Whether Plaintiffs' claims were moot because of Defendants' remedial actions; 2) Whether Defendants' print communications violate Title II of the ADA and Section 504; and 3) &nbsp;Whether Defendants' websites violate Title II and Section 504.</p>\r\n<p>The parties appeared on June 18, 2021, and informed the court that they had settled the case; the contents of the settlement do not appear in the docket. The case was dismissed with prejudice by Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson on 8/31/2021.</p>",

Plaintiffs Christopher Meyer, Sarah Meyer, and the National Federation of the\nBlind, Inc. (“NFB”) bring this action against Jennifer Walthall, in her official capacity as Secretary \nof the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (“FSSA”), and Adrienne Shields, in her \nofficial capacity as Director of the Indiana Division of Family Resources (“DFR”), to end systemic \nviolations of the civil rights of blind Indiana residents by requiring Defendants to provide blind \npersons equally effective access to all print and website communications created or distributed by \nDefendants and their contractors concerning government benefits, including health care coverage \nand food assistance benefits, as required by Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), \n29 U.S.C. § 794. \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 2 of 20 PageID #: 2\n2.  For semantic convenience throughout this complaint, the term “blind” is used in \nthe broadest sense to include all persons who, under federal civil rights laws, have a vision-related \ndisability that requires alternative methods to access hard-copy standard print. \n3.  The State of Indiana, through its agencies FSSA and DFR, and their contractors, \nprovides government benefits such as health care coverage, food assistance, and cash assistance to \nthousands of its residents in need.  As of December 2018, more than 424,000 Indiana residents were \nenrolled in the Healthy Indiana Plan (“HIP”), one of the State’s health insurance programs through \nwhich it provides Medicaid and, at that same time, the State had issued nearly $69 million dollars \nin benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”).   This action arises \nfrom the systemic failure of Defendants and their contractors to provide blind individuals with \nequally effective access to their program-related communications, including but not limited to, \nthose regarding the application, eligibility, receipt, and administration of HIP, SNAP, and other \nlife-sustaining  government  benefits.    Defendants  and  their  contractors  provide  such \ncommunications in standard print and on their websites, both of which are inaccessible to blind \nindividuals.  By offering only inaccessible communications, Defendants and their contractors \nprevent blind Indiana residents from participating equally in Indiana’s state-administered benefits \nservices, programs, and activities.   \n4.  When blind recipients of government benefits have requested print communications \nin alternative formats such as Braille, Defendants have failed to provide them, instead directing \nblind individuals to rely on assistance from sighted third parties. This ineffective communication \nwith blind individuals compromises their ability to privately, independently, and securely access \ninformation concerning their government benefits, as well as apply for, renew, or modify benefits, \namong other things.  Blind Indiana residents are thus at a greater risk of failing to obtain or maintain \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 3 of 20 PageID #: 3\nenrollment in benefits programs, causing lapses in necessary health care coverage, food, and cash \nassistance.   \n5.  Title II of the ADA and Section 504 require Defendants to communicate in an \nequally effective manner with blind individuals. Defendants must provide auxiliary aids and \nservices and make the modifications necessary to ensure that blind individuals have an equal \nopportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of their programs and services.  Appropriate \nauxiliary aids and services for blind individuals may include providing documents in alternative \nformats, such as Braille, audio CD, and digital navigable formats supported by computers and/or \ndigital talking-book players, transmitted through data CD, flash drive, email, or other requested \nmedia.  More than four decades after the enactment of Section 504 and two decades after the \nenactment of the ADA, Defendants, directly and through their contractors, have failed to and \ncontinue to fail to communicate effectively with blind individuals. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331, 1343(a)(3)–(4). \n7.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial \npart of the events, acts, and omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims have occurred in this District \nand Defendant maintains several offices and operates in the District.  \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff Christopher Meyer is blind and uses Braille and accessible electronic \nformats to make and receive written communications. He uses screen access software, such as Job \nAccess With Speech (“JAWS”), which transmits textual information presented visually on a \ncomputer, tablet, or smartphone screen into an audio output or refreshable Braille display. Mr. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 4 of 20 PageID #: 4\nMeyer  receives  assistance  from  the  State  of  Indiana  through  several  government  benefits \nprograms, including Medicaid, through HIP, and SNAP.  Mr. Meyer resides in Indianapolis, \nIndiana, and is a member of the NFB.    \n9.  Plaintiff Sarah Meyer is blind and uses Braille and accessible electronic formats to \nmake and receive written communications.  Ms. Meyer also uses screen access software such as \nJAWS.  Ms. Meyer is a Medicaid recipient. She resides in Indianapolis, Indiana and is a member \nof the NFB. \n10.  The National Federation of the Blind (“NFB”), the oldest and largest national \norganization of blind persons, is a non-profit corporation duly organized under the laws of the \nDistrict of Columbia with its principal place of business in Baltimore, Maryland.  It has affiliates \nin all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.  The vast majority of its approximately 50,000 \nmembers are blind persons who are recognized as a protected class under federal laws.   The NFB \nis widely recognized by the public, Congress, executive agencies of government, and the courts as \na collective and representative voice on behalf of blind Americans and their families.  The NFB \npromotes the general welfare of the blind by assisting the blind in their efforts to integrate \nthemselves into society on terms of equality and by removing barriers that result in the denial of \nopportunity to blind persons in virtually every sphere of life, including education, health care, \nemployment, family and community life, transportation, and recreation.  The NFB has many \nmembers, including Plaintiffs Christopher Meyer and Sarah Meyer, as well as Kaiti Shelton, who \nreside in Indiana and rely on the FSSA and DFR for benefits and seek to access their benefits \ninformation on a private and equal basis.  NFB sues on behalf of its members throughout Indiana.   \n11.  The NFB also sues on its own behalf.  The ultimate purpose of the NFB is the \ncomplete integration of the blind into society on a basis of equality.  This objective includes the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 5 of 20 PageID #: 5\nremoval of legal, economic, and social discrimination.  As part of its mission, and to achieve these \ngoals, the NFB has worked actively to ensure that the blind have an equal opportunity to access \ninformation related to their health care by working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to \nensure provision of accessible communications to blind Medicare applicants, recipients, and \nbeneficiaries, and by partnering with private companies to provide accessible health-related \ntechnology to the blind.  The NFB brings this suit in furtherance of its extensive efforts and \nexpenditure of resources in promoting two of its principal missions: independence of the blind and \nequal access to government services and information for the blind.   \n12.  Defendant Jennifer Walthall is the Secretary of the Indiana Family and Social \nServices Administration.  FSSA administers Indiana’s health care and social services programs.  \nFSSA’s mission is to compassionately serve Hoosiers of all ages and connect them with social \nservices, health care, and their communities.  FSSA receives federal financial assistance to \nadminister federal government benefits programs, such as SNAP, Medicaid, and Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (“TANF”), which provide individuals with food assistance, health \ncoverage, and cash assistance, respectively.  FSSA is comprised of six divisions including: Family \nResources, Medicaid Policy and Planning, Disability and Rehabilitative Services, Mental Health \nand Addiction, Aging, and Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning.  Secretary Walthall is \nresponsible for oversight of FSSA and its six divisions, including DFR.  The Office of the Secretary \nis also tasked with improving its system through technology and training, including ensuring an \nefficient provider payment system and improving service to families.  Director Walthall is sued in \nher official capacity as the official charged with performing the statutory and regulatory duties of \nFSSA, and with supervisory responsibility over FSSA and its divisions, agents, employees, \nrepresentatives, and contractors. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 6 of 20 PageID #: 6\n13.  Defendant Adrienne Shields is the Director of the Indiana Division of Family \nResources.   DFR is the division of FSSA tasked with establishing eligibility for Medicaid, SNAP, \nand TANF benefits. The division also manages the timely and accurate delivery of SNAP and \nTANF benefits. DFR receives federal financial assistance. Director Shields is sued in her official \ncapacity as the official charged with performing the statutory and regulatory duties of DFR, and \nwith  supervisory  responsibility  over  DFR  and  its  agents,  employees,  representatives,  and \ncontractors. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nPlaintiff Christopher Meyer  \n14.  Mr. Meyer is a blind resident of Indianapolis, Indiana.  He receives Medicaid health \ncare coverage through HIP.  He also receives food assistance through SNAP.   \n15.  Defendants, and their contractor health insurance plans, send correspondence such \nas  notices  and  letters  to  HIP  and  SNAP  participants  exclusively  through  standard  print \ncommunications. Defendants also communicate with benefits recipients through their websites, \nincluding the FSSA Benefits Portal. \n16.  Since 2016, Mr. Meyer has attempted to obtain from FSSA and DFR Braille rather \nthan standard print communications.  To date, all such efforts have failed as representatives of \nFSSA and DFR have told Mr. Meyer that they cannot provide any communications in Braille. \n17.  Despite Mr. Meyer first requesting Braille communications in 2016, DFR mailed \nMr. Meyer a standard print letter in or around September 2017 stating that he needed to submit \nadditional information to DFR to remain enrolled in Medicaid.  Because Mr. Meyer is blind, he \ncould not independently review this letter.  Engrossed in his collegiate studies at the time, it was \ndifficult for Mr. Meyer to schedule a sighted assistant help him review his mail.  Therefore, he \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 7 of 20 PageID #: 7\nmissed this critical notification from DFR.  He only later learned that he had been disenrolled from \nMedicaid.   \n18.  In March 2018, Mr. Meyer attempted to reapply for Medicaid using FSSA’s online \nbenefits portal.  Although Mr. Meyer regularly navigates through accessible websites using JAWS, \nhe could not complete the online application because of access barriers on the website.  Because \nseveral form fields, such as checkboxes and dropdown menus, were not properly labeled for screen \naccess software, Mr. Meyer could not submit required information.   \n19.  The  information  needed  to  create  and  maintain  accessible  digital  websites, \nincluding online forms, has long been readily available to Defendants. The World Wide Web \nConsortium issued the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (2.0 AA) (“WCAG 2.0 AA”), which \nexplain how to make web content and processes accessible, in 2008.  The United States Access \nBoard’s Section 508 Standards were updated to incorporate WCAG 2.0 AA in 2017.   \n20.  Because Mr. Meyer could not independently reapply for Medicaid benefits, he had \nto obtain sighted assistance.  \n21.    On or about April 10, 2018, Mr. Meyer wrote to DFR, informing the division once \nagain that he is blind and cannot read print notices.  Mr. Meyer requested Braille communications \nand expressly stated that he wanted such communications so as not to miss important deadlines \nregarding the benefits eligibility redetermination process.  He asked DFR to respond to his request \nwithin 10 days.  DFR never responded to Mr. Meyer’s letter.  \n22.  As a result of DFR’s failure to provide Mr. Meyer with notices and communications \nin Braille, he missed the deadline to submit documents to verify his eligibility to receive benefits.  \n23.  On or about May 1, 2018, Mr. Meyer called DFR to lodge a complaint about the \nlack of accessible communications and DFR’s failure to provide him with communications in \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 8 of 20 PageID #: 8\nBraille.    During  the  call,  Mr.  Meyer  requested  an  extension  of  the  deadline  to  submit \ndocumentation regarding his Medicaid eligibility, but the representative declined to provide an \nextension. \n24.  On or about May 1, 2018, DFR denied Mr. Meyer’s application for HIP and sent \nhim a print letter explaining that the reasons for his denial were his alleged failure to provide all \nrequired information and his failure to cooperate in verifying income.  \n25.  On or about May 6, 2018, Mr. Meyer again wrote to DFR requesting Braille \ncommunications from DFR and FSSA.  He requested a written response from DFR by June 8, \n2018, but DFR never responded to Mr. Meyer’s letter. \n26.  On or about June 1, 2018, Mr. Meyer again filed for Medicaid and SNAP benefits, \nwith assistance from a sighted third party.  He was conditionally approved for HIP benefits on or \nabout June 13, 2018. \n27.  At his interview for SNAP benefits on or around June 18, 2018, Mr. Meyer again \nrequested Braille notifications from Defendants. \n28.  Mr. Meyer appealed DFR’s initial denial of HIP benefits and called FSSA on or \nabout June 21, 2018, for a pre-hearing conference.  At that time, he requested that all hearing \nnotices be sent to him in Braille. A representative told Mr. Meyer that FSSA did not have the \ncapability to provide documents in Braille, but that perhaps a local office could provide them.  \nWhen Mr. Meyer called FSSA again on or about June 28, 2018, to reschedule his hearing date, he \nonce again requested that all hearing notices be sent in Braille. This time, the FSSA representative \ntold him that Braille simply could not be provided. \n29.  Mr. Meyer called FSSA again on or about July 2, 2018, to learn what materials he \nneeded to submit to proceed with his appeal of the denial of HIP benefits.  Mr. Meyer also followed \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 9 of 20 PageID #: 9\nup on his request for Braille documents and a representative told him that a supervisor was aware \nof his request, but that FSSA could not provide documents in Braille, nor could it confirm in \nwriting that it was unable to provide Braille documents.  No local office of FSSA ever provided \nMr. Meyer with Braille documents. \n30.  On or about July 17, 2018, an FSSA administrative judge heard Mr. Meyer’s appeal \nof the initial denial of HIP benefits. The administrative judge told Mr. Meyer that his request for \nBraille communications could not be included as part of his case regarding benefits eligibility. \n31.  In or around August 2018, FSSA fully approved Mr. Meyer for HIP benefits.  \n32.  On or about November 9, 2018, Plaintiffs’ counsel wrote to Secretary Walthall and \nDirector  Shields,  on  behalf  of  Mr.  Meyer  and  the  NFB,  informing  them  of  Mr.  Meyer’s \nunsuccessful attempts to obtain Braille documents and  the accessibility  barriers on FSSA’s \nwebsite.  Counsel for Mr. Meyer offered to work collaboratively with Defendants to resolve these \nissues and provide accessible formats and websites to blind individuals.   \n33.  Director Shields responded to Plaintiffs’ letter by stating that DFR would provide \nall future print correspondence to Mr. Meyer in Braille, and that DFR’s assessment of its website \ndid not reveal any accessibility issues. DFR did not address how it would provide other blind \nindividuals accessible formats or publicize their availability.  In response, Plaintiffs’ counsel again \nwrote to Director Shields, pointing out the deficiencies in DFR’s response and renewing their offer \nto work collaboratively with DFR to implement a comprehensive solution to its accessibility \nissues. Director Shields again declined Plaintiffs’ invitation.  \n34.  Despite these repeated requests for accessible communications, FSSA and DFR \nhave yet to provide Mr. Meyer any documents in Braille or another accessible format.  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 10 of 20 PageID #: 10\n35.   To the contrary, in or around March and April 2019, one of Defendants’ health \ninsurance contractors sent Mr. Meyer letters, including a notice that his request for coverage of \ncertain medication was being denied, in standard print, not Braille.   \n36.  Mr. Meyer  wants  to  review information  related to  his benefits  privately  and \nindependently.  He could do so if Defendants provided these critical written communications in \nBraille. He is concerned that if Defendants continue to communicate with him exclusively through \nprint documents, he will once again miss critical deadlines and requests for additional information \nand risk being disenrolled from benefits. \nPlaintiff Sarah Meyer \n37.  Ms. Meyer resides in Muncie, Indiana. She has received health coverage benefits \nthrough Indiana’s Medicaid program for more than a decade.  She relies on these benefits to obtain \nand pay for necessary medical care.  \n38.  In or about 2010, Ms. Meyer was removed from Indiana’s Medicaid program after \nshe failed to submit the required paperwork to prove her eligibility for benefits.  Ms. Meyer was \nunable to read the standard print notices that DFR had mailed to her home, which instructed her to \nsubmit the paperwork.  Ms. Meyer had not learned of the notices until after she disenrolled from \nthe Medicaid plan.   \n39.  In or around May 2019, after reviewing her mail with the assistance of a sighted \nfriend, Ms. Meyer learned that Defendants had again sent her print correspondence informing her \nthat she was once again at risk of losing her Medicaid benefits, and that to maintain her benefits, \nshe was required to submit paperwork to FSSA to confirm her residency.  \n40.  On or about May 13, 2019, several months after Mr. Meyer and the NFB wrote to \nDFR and FSSA informing them of the problem of inaccessible communications, Ms. Meyer called \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 11 of 20 PageID #: 11\na regional FSSA office, confirmed her residency in Indiana, and requested that FSSA provide all \nfuture communications in Braille or electronic format—formats that allow her to privately and \nindependently access her benefits information.  The representative with whom Ms. Meyer spoke \ntold her that someone would follow up with her regarding her request for alternative formats. \n41.  Approximately two weeks later, having not heard back from the regional office, \nMs.  Meyer  called  back  FSSA  on  or  about  May  28,  2019,  and  repeated  her  request  for \ncommunications in Braille or electronic format.  A representative told her that someone would get \nback to her within 24 hours. \n42.  The next day, a representative returned Ms. Meyers’ call and informed her that \nFSSA was unable to produce communications and notices in Braille or electronic format, but that \nMs.  Meyer  could  authorize  a  sighted  representative  to  receive  copies  of  all  her  FSSA \ncommunications and notices and read the documents to her.  The representative directed Ms. \nMeyer to the National Federation of the Blind of Indiana and Indiana Blind and Visually Impaired \nServices for further assistance.  \n43.  Even after agreeing to produce Braille documents to Mr. Meyer, and having been \nput on notice that Ms. Meyer is also blind, FSSA and DFR never provided Ms. Meyer any \ndocuments in alternative formats, and Ms. Meyer continues to receive communications and notices \nrelated to her Medicaid coverage in standard print.   She is concerned that she could again miss \ncritical Medicaid deadlines if she continues to receive communications from Defendants solely in \nstandard print.  Ms. Meyer wants to review information related to her benefits privately and \nindependently. She could do so if Defendants provided these critical written communications in \nBraille or electronic formats.  \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 12 of 20 PageID #: 12\nPlaintiff NFB \n44.  The National Federation of the Blind has been and continues to be harmed by \nDefendants’ discriminatory actions, as set forth herein, in two ways.  \n45.  First, because the ultimate purpose of the NFB is the complete integration of the \nblind into society on a basis of equality, Defendants’ discriminatory treatment of blind individuals \nwho receive government benefits frustrates the NFB’s organizational mission.  Defendants’ use of \ninaccessible communications has required the NFB to divert its resources to address Indiana’s \ndiscriminatory practices that otherwise could have been directed to other programs and activities.  \nIndeed, before filing this lawsuit, the NFB devoted resources to offering to work collaboratively \nwith Defendants to remedy the problems outlined in this Complaint.  The NFB, through counsel, \nwrote to Secretary Walthall and Director Shields to inform them of their failure to communicate \nwith blind individuals in a manner that is equally effective as Defendants’ communications with \nall other individuals, and to offer the NFB’s experience working with large governmental agencies \nto implement comprehensive accessible format plans.  In spite of those efforts, Defendants have \ncontinued to provide Plaintiffs Christopher Meyer and Sarah Meyer, and other blind individuals, \nwith inaccessible print communications, and accessibility barriers on Defendants’ websites persist.  \n46.  Second, the NFB is a membership organization and has many blind members, \nincluding Christopher Meyer and Sarah Meyer, as well as Kaiti Shelton, who receive government \nbenefits from Indiana and wish to review information related to their benefits privately and \nindependently.  \n47.  Kaiti  Shelton  resides  in  Muncie,  Indiana  and  has  experienced  discriminatory \nconduct by Defendants similar to that faced by Mr. Meyer and Ms. Meyer.  Ms. Shelton is blind \nand uses Braille and accessible electronic formats to make and receive written communications.  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 13 of 20 PageID #: 13\nShe also uses magnification and screen access software, such as JAWS and NonVisual Desktop \nAccess, to read written communications.  \n48.  Ms. Shelton began receiving Medicaid benefits from the State of Indiana in or \naround  September  2018  after  moving  from  Ohio.    All  communications  from  Defendants \nconcerning Ms. Shelton’s eligibility and enrollment for Medicaid benefits have been in standard \nprint, a format she cannot independently access. \n49.  To read Defendants’ print communications, Ms. Shelton has relied on sighted \nassistance from her parents or Aira, a paid service that connects blind individuals with sighted \nagents who read written communications from a camera on the individual’s mobile device or \nmounted in eyeglasses worn by the blind individual.   \n50.  While  Ms.  Shelton  has  accessed  Defendants’  written  communications  with \nassistance from her parents and Aira, she has sacrificed her privacy and independence to do so, \nand, in the case of Aira, has had to pay for this assistance.  \n51.  In or around April 2019, Ms. Shelton called FSSA to request that she receive all \nwritten communications in Braille or electronic format.  She was told by an FSSA representative \nthat a supervisor would return her call and speak with her directly about her request.  The \nrepresentative also provided Ms. Shelton with a phone number with a 202 area code and told her \nto call the number for assistance with receiving accessible communications. Ms. Shelton called the \nphone number, but no one ever answered.   \n52.  Ms. Shelton called FSSA a second time to request accessible communications, but \nthe FSSA representative told her that the agency could not provide her any documents in Braille.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 14 of 20 PageID #: 14\n53.  Each time Ms. Shelton called FSSA, she lodged a complaint regarding FSSA’s \nprovision of inaccessible print communications. No one ever called Ms. Shelton to follow up or \nresolve her complaints. \n54.  Ms. Shelton never received a call from any FSSA supervisor, and despite her \nefforts, she has yet to receive any accessible communications from Defendants.  \nCOUNT ONE - VIOLATION OF TITLE II OF THE ADA \n55.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in the preceding paragraphs, as if alleged \nherein. \n56.  Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB members are qualified individuals with a \ndisability protected by the ADA, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102, 12131(2); they are persons with \ndisabilities within the meaning of the ADA in that they have impairments that substantially limit \nthe major life activity of seeing. \n57.  FSSA and DFR, as agencies, divisions, or instrumentalities of the State of Indiana, \nare public entities subject to Title II of the ADA.   \n58.  Title II of the ADA guarantees qualified individuals with disabilities an equal \nopportunity to access the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity.  42 \nU.S.C. § 12132.  The ADA specifically requires public entities to offer communications with \nindividuals with disabilities that are as effective as communications with others, and to provide \nauxiliary aids  and services where necessary to  afford individuals with disabilities an equal \nopportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity of a public \nentity.  28 C.F.R. § 35.160.  For the communications to be effective, auxiliary aids and services \nmust be provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and in such a way as to protect the \nprivacy and independence of the individual with a disability.  Id.  Public entities must give primary \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 15 of 20 PageID #: 15\nconsideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities when considering what types of \nauxiliary  aids  and  services  are  necessary.    Id.    Public  entities  must  also  make  reasonable \nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability.  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i). \n59.  Defendants’ provision and administration of benefits, such as health care coverage, \ndirectly and through its contractors, constitutes a service, program, or activity subject to Title II of \nthe ADA.  \n60.  In failing to provide blind individuals like Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB \nmembers communications in accessible formats, such as Braille and electronic formats, and by \nfailing to remove accessibility barriers from their websites, Defendants have refused to provide \nthe auxiliary aids and services necessary to communicate with blind individuals in an equally \neffective and timely manner that protects their privacy and independence. This deprives Mr. \nMeyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB members an equal opportunity to benefit from Defendants’ \nservices, programs, and activities. Defendants’ failure to comply with the ADA is ongoing. \n61.  Because Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB members cannot independently \naccess standard print or portions of Defendants’ websites, they must either find and rely on third-\nparty assistance, which intrudes upon the privacy of their personal information, or forego accessing \ntheir benefits information altogether.  Defendants’ failure to communicate effectively with blind \nindividuals puts them at risk of denial or interruption of critical benefits.  \n62.  Accessible formats such as Braille and large print are auxiliary aids and services \nunder the Title II regulations.  28 C.F.R. § 35.104.  Numerous governmental agencies and \ncommercial entities already provide individual account and benefits information to blind persons \nin similar accessible formats.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 16 of 20 PageID #: 16\n63.  Unless the Court enjoins Defendants from continuing to engage in these unlawful \npractices, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm: they have suffered and continue to \nsuffer from discrimination and unequal access to Defendants’ benefits programs, services, or \nactivities.  If there is no change in the status quo, Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB members \nwill be denied their right to access and engage fully in the provision of their social service and \nhealth benefits.  \n64.  Defendants’ failure to meet their obligations to communicate with blind persons in \nan equally effective manner constitutes an ongoing and continuous violation of the ADA and its \nimplementing regulations.  Unless restrained from doing so, Defendants will continue to violate \nthe ADA.  Unless enjoined, Defendants’ conduct will continue to inflict injuries for which \nPlaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  \n65.  The  ADA  authorizes  injunctive  relief  as  appropriate  to  remedy  acts  of \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities.  42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1). \n66.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and \ncosts. \nCOUNT TWO - VIOLATION OF REHABILITATION ACT \n67.  The allegations contained in the previous paragraphs are incorporated by reference. \n68.  Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB members are qualified individuals with a \ndisability protected by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  See 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); 45 C.F.R. § \n84.3(j). \n69.  FSSA and DFR receive federal financial assistance and are therefore covered by \nthe Rehabilitation Act.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 17 of 20 PageID #: 17\n70.  The Rehabilitation Act mandates that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving \nFederal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  As part of that accessibility mandate, the \nRehabilitation  Act  requires  that  recipients  of  federal  financial  assistance  shall  ensure  that \ncommunications with their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries are effectively conveyed to \nthose having impaired vision and hearing.  28 C.F.R. § 42.503.   \n71.  Discrimination includes failing to “[a]fford a qualified handicapped person an \nopportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that \nafforded others,” or providing qualified handicapped persons with “an aid, benefit, or service that \nis not as effective as that provided to others.”  45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(ii)-(iii); see 45 C.F.R. § \n84.52(a)(2)-(3).    \n72.   Section 504 requires recipients of federal financial assistance that provide health, \nwelfare, or other social services or benefits and that have at least fifteen employees to provide \nauxiliary aids and services, such as written notices and other documents in Braille, to individuals \nwho are blind.  45 C.F.R. § 84.52(b), (d).  \n73.  A recipient of federal financial assistance may not directly or through contractual, \nlicensing, or other arrangements, discriminate on the basis of disability.  45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1).  \n74.  Defendants’ provision and administration of benefits, such as health care coverage, \nconstitutes a program or activity receiving federal financial assistance and must therefore comply \nwith Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  \n75.  Defendants have failed and are failing to meet their obligation to provide blind \nindividuals an equal opportunity to use and benefit from their public assistance programs and \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 18 of 20 PageID #: 18\nactivities.  In failing to provide blind individuals like Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB \nmembers with accessible print and website communications, Defendants and their contractors have \nrefused to provide the auxiliary aids and services necessary to communicate with blind individuals \nin an equally effective and timely manner that protects their privacy and independence.  \n76.  Because Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB members cannot independently \naccess standard print or portions of Defendants’ websites, they must either find and rely on third-\nparty assistance, which intrudes upon the privacy of their personal information, or forego accessing \ntheir benefits information altogether.  Defendants’ failure to communicate effectively with blind \npatients puts them at risk of denial or interruption of critical benefits.  \n77.  Accessible formats, such as Braille, constitute auxiliary aids and services under the \nSection  504  regulations.    45  C.F.R.  §  84.52(d)(3).    Numerous  governmental  agencies  and \ncommercial entities already provide individual account and benefits information to blind persons \nin similar accessible formats.  \n78.  Unless the Court enjoins Defendants from continuing to engage in these unlawful \npractices, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm: they have suffered and continue to \nsuffer from discrimination and unequal access to Defendants’ benefits programs, services, or \nactivities.  If there is no change in the status quo, Mr. Meyer, Ms. Meyer, and other NFB members \nwill be denied their right to access and engage fully in the provision of their social service and \nhealth benefits.  \n79.  Defendants’ failure to meet their obligations to communicate with blind individuals \nin an equally effective manner constitutes an ongoing and continuous violation of Section 504 and \nits implementing regulations.  Unless restrained from doing so, Defendants will continue to violate \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 19 of 20 PageID #: 19\nSection 504.  Unless enjoined, Defendants’ conduct will continue to inflict injuries for which \nPlaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  \n80.  Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and \ncosts.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request judgment as follows: \nA.  Declare that Defendants’ failure to ensure that they and their contractors offer and \nprovide information and other communications in accessible formats to blind individuals violates \nTitle II of the ADA and Section 504. \nB.  Declare that Defendants have a duty to provide equally effective access to all \ninformation they and their contractors provide to recipients of government benefits, including, but \nnot limited to, notices, correspondence, forms, and publications, in appropriately secure formats \nthat are accessible to blind individuals, including Braille, large print, audio CD, and digital \nnavigable formats supported by computers and/or digital talking-book players, transmitted through \ndata CD, flash drive, e-mail, or other requested media, and all website communications; \nC.  Grant a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from violating Title II of the \nADA and Section 504, and requiring Defendants, their successors, agents, contractors, assigns, \nrepresentatives, employees, and all persons acting in concert therewith, to ensure that Plaintiffs \nhave equally effective access to all information Defendants provide to Indiana residents, including, \nbut not limited to: by providing equal access to all print communications in appropriately secure \nformats that are accessible to blind persons, including Braille, large print, audio CD, and digital \nnavigable formats supported by computers and/or digital talking-book players, transmitted through \ndata CD, flash drive, e-mail, or other requested media; by remediating their websites so that they \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 1   Filed 08/06/19   Page 20 of 20 PageID #: 20\nprovide equally effective communication to the blind; and by implementing policies, procedures, \nand practices to ensure the consistent and affirmative provision of alternative formats to blind \nindividuals, such that blind individuals need not make multiple requests for accessible formats, \nand the long-term maintenance of accessible websites; \nD.

A bench trial in this \nmatter is scheduled for June 14, 2021, and Defendants have filed a Motion to Exclude Expert \nTestimony at Trial, [Filing No. 79], which is now ripe for the Court's consideration. \nI. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n \n  Federal Rule of Evidence 104 instructs that \"[t]he court must decide any preliminary \nquestion about whether a witness is qualified…or evidence is admissible.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 104(a).  \nFederal Rule of Evidence 702 provides that expert testimony is admissible if: \"(a) the expert's \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 2 of 10 PageID #: 2095\nscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the \nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) \nthe testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably \napplied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 702.  A trial judge \"must \ndetermine at the outset…whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that \n(2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.  This entails a preliminary \nassessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically \nvalid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue….  \nMany factors will bear on the inquiry….\"  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 \nU.S. 579, 592-93 (1993). \n  The Court has a \"gatekeeping obligation\" under Rule 702, and \"'must engage in a three-\nstep analysis before admitting expert testimony.  It must determine whether the witness is \nqualified; whether the expert's methodology is scientifically reliable; and whether the testimony \nwill 'assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.'\"  Gopalratnam \nv. Hewlett-Packard Co., 877 F.3d 771, 779 (7th Cir. 2017) (quoting Myers v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., \n629 F.3d 639, 644 (7th Cir. 2010)).  Put another way, the district court must evaluate: \"(1) the \nproffered expert's qualifications; (2) the reliability of the expert's methodology; and (3) the \nrelevance of the expert's testimony.\"  Gopalratnam, 877 F.3d at 779 (emphasis omitted).  The \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals \"give[s] the district court wide latitude in performing its gate-\nkeeping function and determining both how to measure the reliability of expert testimony and \nwhether the testimony itself is reliable.\"  Bielskis v. Louisville Ladder, Inc., 663 F.3d 887, 894 (7th \nCir. 2011). \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 3 of 10 PageID #: 2096\nII. \nBACKGROUND \n \n  Plaintiffs Christopher and Sarah Meyer are brother and sister.  Mr. Meyer was born with \nLeber's congenital amaurosis, a condition present at birth that causes significant vision loss and \nblindness, and he is blind as a result.  [Filing No. 66-3 at 7.]  He reads braille and uses a variety of \nassistive technology to read standard alphanumeric print.  [Filing No. 66-3 at 7-8.]  To read \nhardcopy alphanumeric print documents, he uses applications that turn text into an audio output, \nor he uses human readers – referred to as sighted assistance – to read documents to him.  [Filing \nNo. 66-3 at 8-9.]  To navigate websites, Mr. Meyer uses \"screen readers,\" which are software \nprograms that read a computer screen and provide an audio output.  [Filing No. 66-3 at 11-12.]   \n  Ms. Meyer has also been blind since birth as a result of Leber's congenital amaurosis.  \n[Filing No. 66-4 at 8.]  She also reads braille and uses a variety of text-to-audio applications to \nread hard copy documents.  [Filing No. 66-4 at 9; Filing No. 66-4 at 14.]  Ms. Meyer also uses \nscreen readers to navigate websites.  [Filing No. 66-4 at 12.] \n  The FSSA is the agency responsible for administering public benefits programs in the State \nof Indiana.  [Filing No. 71-12 at 2.]  DFR is a division within the FSSA that determines applicants' \neligibility for benefits programs, including Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n(\"SNAP\"), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (\"TANF\"), and then administers those \nprograms.  [Filing No. 66-14 at 8.]  The FSSA and DFR receive federal funds and are therefore \nsubject to Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  [Filing No. 66-8 at 5-7.]  \nAll websites operated by the FSSA, including the FSSA Homepage and Medicaid Homepage, \ninclude a button for a user to utilize a built-in \"BrowseAloud\" text-to-audio program.  [Filing No. \n66-19 at 24; Filing No. 66-21 at 36.] \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 2097\n  Mr. Meyer and Ms. Meyer receive SNAP and Medicaid benefits through the State of \nIndiana, and this litigation relates to difficulties they have had applying for and maintaining \nbenefits either through Defendants' print communications or their websites.  On March 25, 2021, \nthe Court denied Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, denied Defendants' Cross-Motion for \nSummary Judgment, and found that the following issues remain for trial: (1) whether Plaintiffs' \nclaims  are  moot  because  of  Defendants'  remedial  actions;  (2)  whether  Defendants'  print \ncommunications violate Title II and Section 504; and (3) whether Defendants' websites violate \nTitle II and Section 504.  [Filing No. 82.]  Defendants have moved to exclude the expert testimony \nof Terri Youngblood Savage, who conducted an accessibility review of Defendants' websites.  \n[Filing No. 79.] \nIII. \nDISCUSSION \n \n  Ms.  Youngblood  Savage  is  the  President  of  Accessible  Systems,  Inc.,  and  tested \nDefendants' websites using the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Guidelines \n(\"WCAG 2.1\").  [Filing No. 74-8 at 2-3.]  Her Expert Report \"summarizes the testing of the issues \nfound from an accessibility review of [the FSSA and DFR] websites.\"  [Filing No. 71-8 at 4.]  Ms. \nYoungblood Savage summarized the methodology used to test the websites as follows: \nThe  websites  were  evaluated  against  the  [WCAG  2.1]    WCAG  is  a  set  of \nrequirements  that  is  the  international  system  of  coding  standards.    WCAG \ncompliance ensures that your website is accessible by everyone, irrespective of \ndisabilities and age. \n \nThe evaluation was completed by using a combination of methods to evaluate \naccessibility.  Testing included direct code inspection and helper tools (such as \nspecial browser add-ons) to locate issues, [and] look for other issues that manual \ntesting did not detect.  For example, only a human evaluator can determine if the \nalternative text for an image is a meaningful equivalent of that image.  Another \nmanual  method  we  will  use  is  screen  reader  and  other  assistive  technology \nevaluation.  We used a screen reader called JAWS and NVDA to read the websites.  \nTo evaluate keyboard accessibility and focus handling we use the keyboard to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 2098\nnavigate the websites.  The reviews below were conducted on publicly available \nwebsites. \n \n[Filing No. 71-8 at 8.]   \n  As for the BrowseAloud feature, Ms. Youngblood Savage opined the following: \nAt the very bottom of the home page there is a toolbar for accessibility that features \n\"Browse Aloud\" and a text-only version of the website.  Browse [A]loud is an \naccessibility tool that reads the page to a user.  It is a nice feature but does not \nreplace  accessibility  programming  of  the  website.    Many  requirements  for \naccessibility have not been addressed by using this tool, [and] people who are blind \nwould not have full access to the website the way they would if it followed \nguidelines for accessibility. \n \n[Filing No. 71-8 at 10.]  Ms. Youngblood Savage concluded: \nIt is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of professional certainty, that: 1) The \nwebsites evaluated in this report are not fully accessible to people who are blind; \nand 2) there are barriers for people who are blind that prevent them from accessing \nservices and information on the websites. \n \n[Filing No. 71-8 at 37.] \n  In support of their Motion to Exclude, Defendants argue that Ms. Youngblood Savage did \nnot perform testing on BrowseAloud, and therefore cannot testify as to whether Defendants' \nwebsites are accessible.  [Filing No. 79 at 4.]  They assert that Ms. Youngblood Savage \"claims to \nhave researched…data on Defendants' websites to assert that the websites are not Accessible, when \nshe never tested the Accessibility tool on Defendants' websites,\" and \"has not completed the \nscientific analysis that would be necessary for [her] conclusory opinion.\"  [Filing No. 79 at 5.]  \nDefendants also argue that because Ms. Youngblood Savage never tested BrowseAloud, her \ntestimony is not reliable or helpful.  [Filing No. 79 at 5.]  They assert that \"[i]f Ms. [Youngblood] \nSavage did not test the Defendants' websites for Accessibility using the software designed to make \nthe websites Accessible, then her evidence was insufficient, and therefore not helpful to this \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 2099\nCourt.\"  [Filing No. 79 at 6.]  Finally, Defendants contend that Ms. Youngblood Savage's \n\"assumptions do not fit with the facts in this case.\"  [Filing No. 79 at 6-7.] \n  In  their  response,  Plaintiffs  argue  that  Ms.  Youngblood  Savage  used  a  reliable \nmethodology by following the guidelines provided in WCAG 2.1, \"using a combination of five \nmanual and assistive tools: (1) the Web Accessibility Toolbar; (2) Job Access With Speech \n('JAWS'); (3) Non-Visual Desktop Access ('NVDA'); (4) The Color Contrast Analyzer; and (5) \nJavaScript Bookmarklets for Accessibility Testing.\"  [Filing No. 80 at 5.]  Plaintiffs note that Ms. \nYoungblood Savage also used \"direct code inspection\" and evaluations, relied on JAWS and \nNVDA to \"read the websites,\" used a keyboard for navigation to evaluation accessibility and \n\"focus handling,\" and evaluated the pages and tools available on each of the websites.  [Filing No. \n80 at 5.]  As for BrowseAloud, Plaintiffs argue that Ms. Youngblood Savage considered it and \n\"ultimately concluded that its limited features  were incompatible with the full accessibility \nrequirements in the WCAG2.1 standards.\"  [Filing No. 80 at 6.]  Plaintiffs assert that Defendants' \nargument – that Ms. Youngblood Savage should have more thoroughly analyzed accessibility \nusing BrowseAloud – goes to the weight of Ms. Youngblood Savage's testimony, and not to \nwhether her opinions are admissible.  [Filing No. 80 at 6.]  Plaintiffs argue further that Ms. \nYoungblood  Savage's  opinions  are  based  on  sufficient  data,  and  that  she  \"did  not  ignore \nBrowseAloud or turn a blind eye to the fact that it is available on Defendants' websites.\"  [Filing \nNo. 80 at 7-8.]  Plaintiffs also contend that Ms. Youngblood Savage's \"specialized knowledge of \nweb accessibility will assist the trier of fact to determine whether Defendants' websites contain \naccessibility barriers – a key issue in this case.\"  [Filing No. 80 at 9.] \n  In their reply, Defendants argue that although Plaintiffs state that Ms. Youngblood Savage's \ntestimony is to assist the Court in determining whether Defendants' websites are accessible, \"there \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 7 of 10 PageID #: 2100\nis no possible instance in which [she] can articulate [this] as she never tested the Accessibility \nsoftware that is provided on Defendants' websites.\"  [Filing No. 81 at 1-2.]  They contend that Ms. \nYoungblood  Savage  did  not  cite  any  scientific  discipline  to  support  her  conclusion  that \nBrowseAloud  does  not  satisfy  WCAG  2.1  standards,  and  reiterate  their  argument  that  her \ntestimony will not aid the Court.  [Filing No. 81 at 4-7.]  Defendants argue further that the issues \nwith Ms. Youngblood Savage's testimony cannot be dealt with on cross-examination because the \nconcern with her testimony \"is not questioning one simple input, but indeed her entire methodology \nin not testing the actual Accessibility software provided to form her conclusions.\"  [Filing No. 81 \nat 7.]   \n  A.  Whether Ms. Youngblood Savage is Qualified \n  Fed. R. Evid. 702 allows the opinions of witnesses who have the requisite \"knowledge, \nskill, experience, training, or education.\"  Defendants do not challenge Ms. Youngblood Savage's \nqualifications, and the Court finds that she is qualified to testify as an expert on the accessibility \nof Defendants' websites.  Ms. Youngblood Savage is the President and Owner of Accessible \nSystems,  Inc.,  a  company  that  provides  consulting  services  for  information  systems  and \naccessibility support, including the development of accessible websites and accessibility testing \nand evaluation.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 2.]  She is a member of the International Association of \nAccessibility Professionals, and has provided accessibility consulting to numerous public and \nprivate entities since 1991.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 7-11.]  Her background and extensive experience \nmake her qualified to testify as an expert regarding the accessibility of Defendants' websites. \n  B.  Whether Ms. Youngblood Savage's Methodology is Scientifically Reliable \n  The  Supreme  Court  in  Daubert  set  forth  four  factors  a  court  may  consider  when \ndetermining whether an expert witness's methodology is reliable, including: (1) whether the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 8 of 10 PageID #: 2101\nmethodology \"can be (and has been) tested\"; (2) whether the methodology \"has been subjected to \npeer review and publication\"; (3) the \"known or potential rate of error\"; and (4) whether the \nmethodology is generally accepted.  Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94.  These factors are not a \n\"definitive checklist or test,\" id. at 593, and the weight of the factors is dependent on \"the particular \ncircumstances of the particular case at issue,\" Kumho Tire Co., Ltd., v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, \n150 (1999).  The key focus \"is to make certain that an expert, whether basing testimony upon \nprofessional studies or personal experience, employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual \nrigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\"  Id. at 152. \nDefendants' qualm with Ms. Youngblood Savage's methodology centers on her failure to \nperform testing on BrowseAloud.  Ms. Youngblood Savage readily admits that she did not test \nBrowseAloud, but she explains why that is the case in her Expert Report, stating: \nAt the very bottom of the home page there is a toolbar for accessibility that features \n\"Browse Aloud\" and a text-only version of the website.  Browse [A]loud is an \naccessibility tool that reads the page to a user.  It is a nice feature but does not \nreplace  accessibility  programming  of  the  website.    Many  requirements  for \naccessibility have not been addressed by using this tool, people who are blind would \nnot have full access to the website the way they would if it followed guidelines for \naccessibility. \n \nThe text only view makes it very easy for a blind user to find content.  Text only is \nnot a widely accepted alternative for accessibility.  Each time you find something \nand switch pages the user must convert to text only again.  One of the myths of web \naccessibility is that people with disabilities benefit from text-only versions. \n \n[Filing No. 66-26 at 22.]  She also testified as follows: \nQ:  How can you determine that if you've never even went through BrowseAloud? \n \nA:  Well, BrowseAloud is reading text only on a website.  It does not provide the \nother accessibility necessities that people who are blind need. \n \n[Filing No. 71-9 at 4.] \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 9 of 10 PageID #: 2102\n  The Court finds that the fact that Ms. Youngblood Savage did not test BrowseAloud in \nconnection with Defendants' websites does not make her methodology unreliable such that her \ntestimony  should  be  prohibited.    She  explained  that  she  was  aware  of  the  accessibility  of \nBrowseAloud on Defendants' websites, but discounted its usefulness based on its features because \nit simply reads text to blind users and still would not give blind users full access to Defendants' \nwebsites.  Ms. Youngblood Savage also noted that the text-only view – the view for which \nBrowseAloud is used – does not make a website accessible because a user must convert content to \ntext-only each time they find something and switch pages.  Ms. Youngblood Savage's conclusions \nregarding  the  effect  that  BrowseAloud  has  on  accessibility  were  reached  using  reliable \nmethodology.    Defendants  are  free  to  address  any  shortcomings  they  believe  exist  in  Ms. \nYoungblood  Savage's  methodology  during  cross-examination.    Daubert,  509  U.S.  at  596 \n(\"Vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the \nburden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible \nevidence\"); see also Gayton v. McCoy, 593 F.3d 610, 616 (7th Cir. 2010) (\"Determinations on \nadmissibility  should  not  supplant  the  adversarial  process;  'shaky'  expert  testimony  may  be \nadmissible, assailable by its opponents through cross-examination\"). \n  C.  Whether Ms. Youngblood Savage's Testimony Will Aid the Trier of Fact \n  Defendants also characterize Ms. Youngblood Savage's failure to test the BrowseAloud \nfeature on Defendants' websites as rendering her opinion unhelpful to the trier of fact – in this case, \nthe Court at the upcoming bench trial.  An expert \"must testify to something more than what is \nobvious to the layperson.\"  Dhillon v. Crown Controls Corp., 269 F.3d 865, 871 (7th Cir. 2001) \n(quotation and citation omitted).  The Court does not have extensive and specialized knowledge \nregarding the website accessibility issues that will be key to resolving this lawsuit.  It finds that \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 99   Filed 05/13/21   Page 10 of 10 PageID #: 2103\nMs. Youngblood Savage's expert testimony – including her explanation for why she found that \nBrowseAloud did not enhance the accessibility of Defendants' websites – will be helpful at trial.  \nAgain,  Defendants  will  have  ample  opportunity  to  cross-examine  Ms.  Youngblood  Savage \nregarding BrowseAloud and all of her opinions. \n  In sum, while Ms. Youngblood Savage did not test BrowseAloud, she explained her \nopinion that it did not render Defendants' websites accessible.  She is qualified to testify regarding \naccessibility, her methodology is sound, and her testimony will aid the trier of fact.  Defendants' \nMotion to Exclude Expert Testimony at Trial, [Filing No. 79], is DENIED. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony at Trial, [79], \nis DENIED.  Ms. Youngblood Savage's testimony and expert report will be admissible at trial. \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \nDistribution via ECF only to all counsel of record \n \n10 \n ",

Defendants fail to \nconsistently provide  print  correspondence  to Plaintiffs  in accessible alternative formats, namely \nBraille.  Defendants’  websites are not equally available to blind individuals  because they have not  \nbeen created or maintained in a manner  compatible with screen  access software  that many blind \nindividuals utilize  to access information on the  Internet.  Defendants’ denial of equal treatment as  \ndescribed in this Memorandum of Law  constitutes  a violation of  Title II of the  Americans with  \nDisabilities Act of 1990  (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131–12134, and Section 504 of the  \nRehabilitation Act (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794.  \nSTATEMENT OF  MATERIAL FACTS  NOT IN DISPUTE  \nI.   Plaintiffs Christopher Meyer, Sarah Meyer, and the National Federation of the  \nBlind, Inc.  \nPlaintiffs Christopher Meyer and Sarah Meyer are  blind as a result of Leber’s Congenital  \nAmaurosis. [Filing No. 66-3 at  6–7  (C. Meyer Dep.  at pp. 10:25–11:24)]; [Filing No. 66-4 at  8  \n(S. Meyer Dep. at p. 9:1–16)]; [Filing No. 66-5 at  3]; [Filing No. 66-6 at  3.]. They are members  \nof the National Federation of the Blind, Inc. [Filing No. 66-3 at  25–26 (C. Meyer Dep. pp. \n46:13–47:8)]; [Filing No. 66-4 at  28  (S. Meyer  Dep. 38:13–18).].  They each read Braille and rely  \non Braille to read standard print documents. [Filing No. 66-5 at 4];  [Filing No. 66-4 at 51 (S. \nMeyer Dep. 62:19–25)]; [Filing No. 66-6 at 4.]. They also  utilize screen  readers  to access the \n \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 9 of 44 PageID #: 1296\nInternet.  [Filing No. 66-3 at 11–12 (C. Myer Dep. pp.15:15–16:25)]; [Filing No. 66-4 at 12–13 \n(S. Meyer Dep. pp. 13:16–14:2)]; [Filing No. 66-5 at 4]; [Filing No. 66-6 at  4.].  A screen reader  \nis a software  application that conveys to a blind person through non-visual means what sighted \npeople see on a screen, often by using text-to-speech functionality. [Filing No. 66-26 at  3,  ¶ 8.].  \nJob Access with Speech, or JAWS and NonVisual  Desktop Access, or NVDA, are screen  \nreaders.  [Filing No. 66-26 at  3,  ¶ 8.].  \nChristopher and Sarah Meyer receive public assistance benefits from  FSSA and DFR, \nincluding Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”) benefits. [Filing  \nNo. 66-3 at 17–18 (C. Meyer Dep. pp. 21:25–22:20)]; [Filing No. 66-4 at 21 (S. Meyer Dep. p. \n27:10–24).]. Since at least 2017, Christopher Meyer has  made more than  a dozen  requests to  \nFSSA and DFR to send all print correspondence  in Braille. [Filing No. 66-5 at 6–9]; [Filing No. \n66-27 at 2–6, 20, 22, 25–26, 28, 32–33, 35]; [Filing No. 66-30  at 2.]. In September 2017, Mr. \nMeyer was disenrolled from Medicaid because he  did not submit the required documentation to \nremain eligible.  [Filing No. 66-5  at 4–5.]. Mr. Meyer could not read the print notices from FSSA  \nand DFR requesting verification information and therefore missed the deadline to respond. \n[Filing No. 66-5  at 4–5]; [Filing No. 66-27 at 8.]. In March 2018, Mr. Meyer attempted to re-\nenroll  for benefits by visiting Defendants’  website, the FSSA Benefits Portal, but was unable to \ncomplete the application  because the website was  not accessible with  screen access software. \n[Filing No.66-5 at 5–6]; [Filing No. 66-3 at 43–44 (C. Meyer Dep. pp. 64:11–65:4).].  In May \n2018, Mr. Meyer was denied Medicaid benefits under  the Healthy Indiana  Plan due to a failure to \nsubmit income verification information by the deadline. [Filing No. 66-27 at 2.]  Mr. Meyer \nappealed the denial of benefits, but later dropped the administrative appeal  [Filing No. 66-5 at  \n10–11.].  \n2  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 10 of 44 PageID #: 1297\nThe health insurance provider for Mr. Meyer’s Medicaid benefits is Managed Health  \nServices (“MHS”).  [Filing No. 66-12 at 2,  ¶ 2.].  Mr. Meyer has requested MHS to provide him  \nall print communications in Braille, including most recently in January 2020; however MHS  \ncontinues to send Mr. Meyer only standard print  documents. [Filing No. 66-12 at 2,  ¶ 3.].  As a \nresult, Mr. Meyer has been unable to read important notices regarding denials of coverage, \ninsurance overpayments, and past due payments. [Filing No. 66-12 at 2–3,  ¶¶ 4–6.].  \nSarah  Meyer was disenrolled from Medicaid  in 2010 due to a failure to submit  \ndocumentation verifying her income and resources. [Filing No. 66-6 at 4–5]; [Filing No. 66-4  at  \n51–52  (S. Meyer Dep. pp. 62:7–63:4)]; [Filing No. 66-28 at 2.]. Ms.  Meyer  was unable to read  \nthe print notice requesting the documentation and therefore did not submit the information within \nthe deadline. [Filing No. 66-6 at 4–5]; [Filing No. 66-4 at 51–52 (S. Meyer  Dep. pp. 62:10– \n63:8).]. Ms.  Meyer  contacted  FSSA and DFR  several times, including in March 2014, June 2014, \nand May 2019, to notify the  agencies  that she could not read print notices and to request all  print  \ncorrespondence in Braille. [Filing No. 66-6  at 5–6]; [Filing No. 66-29 at  3, 15, 16.].   \nPlaintiff  the National Federation of the Blind, Inc. (“NFB”) is a non-profit corporation \nand the oldest and largest national organization of  blind individuals. [Filing No. 66-7 at 3–4.]. \nThe NFB’s mission is to  “promote[] the general welfare of the blind by assisting the blind in \ntheir efforts to integrate themselves into society on terms of equality and by removing barriers  \nthat result in the denial of opportunity to blind persons in virtually every sphere of life, including \neducation, health care, employment, family and community life, transportation, and recreation.” \n[Filing No. 66-7 at 3–4.]. The NFB has  expended time and efforts towards ensuring that  \nDefendants’ print communications and websites comply  with federal law.  [Filing No. 66-7 at 5– \n8.].  \n3  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 11 of 44 PageID #: 1298\nThe NFB has  approximately 113 members who reside in Indiana, at least six of whom  \nreceive government benefits through FSSA  and/or DFR. [Filing No. 66-7  at 4–5.]. Kaiti  Shelton \nis a member of the NFB.  [Filing No. 66-11 at  2,  ¶ 1.].  She, too, has requested that FSSA and \nDFR provide all print correspondence in an alternative format, namely Braille or an accessible  \nelectronic copy. [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  ¶ 5.]. Ms.  Shelton requested Braille correspondence on \nApril 18, 2019, April 25, 2019, May 14, 2019, and May 20, 2019. [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  ¶ 6];  \n[Filing No. 66-37 at 2–4]; [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  ¶ 6.].  She has yet to receive any Braille \ndocuments  from Defendants. [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  ¶ 7.].  Ms.  Shelton also  does not  consistently \nreceive accessible print communications  from Defendants’ contractors. [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  \n¶  9.].  One such contractor is  MHS, a health insurance plan servicing eligible  Indiana Medicaid \nrecipients.  [Filing No. 66-11 at  2–3,  ¶¶ 2, 8–9.].  Ms.  Shelton has received some brochures, \nflyers, and general information in an accessible  electronic format, but continues to receive only \nstandard print for  correspondence  and documents  specific to her  membership. [Filing No. 66-11 \nat  3,  ¶ 9.].   \nII.   Defendants’ Public Benefits Programs  \nFSSA  and DFR are agencies, divisions, or instrumentalities of the State of  Indiana  and \nare therefore public entities subject to Title  II of the ADA.  [Filing No. 66-8  at 5–6.]. Defendants  \nalso receive federal financial assistance and are subject to Section 504. [Filing No. 66-8 at 6–7.]. \nDefendant  FSSA is the agency responsible  for  administering Indiana’s public assistance \nprograms, and DFR is a  division of FSSA responsible for administering Medicaid, SNAP, and \nTemporary Assistance for  Needy  Families (“TANF”) benefits.  [Filing No. 66-14 at 7–10 (A.  \nShields Dep. pp. 45:17–46:19; 47:20–48:18).].  \n4  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 12 of 44 PageID #: 1299\nIII.   Defendants’ Inaccessible Print Documents  \n  In late August 2019, following the filing of Plaintiffs’ lawsuit, DFR implemented a  \npolicy by which it would record and fulfill requests for  large print or Braille documents as  \nalternatives to standard print correspondence.  [Filing No. 66-20 at 5–6, 9, 13–14 (DFR 30(b)(6) \nA. Shields Dep. pp. 12:8–13:14; 16:13–21; 20:10–21:5).]. DFR designated Jasmine Holliday as  \nthe primary person to fulfill such requests. [Filing No. 66-20 at 21–22 (DFR 30(b)(6) A. Shields  \nDep. pp. 42:16–43:6).].  DFR purchased a Braille embosser  after September 2019  and thereafter  \nbegan producing its own Braille correspondence.

DFR believes that Braille should be  \nreadable and accurate.  [Filing No. 66-20 at 41–42 (DFR 30(b)(6) A. Shields  Dep. pp. 102:18– \n103:2).].  However, it  does not evaluate or monitor the quality of Braille produced by \nMs.  Holliday, and no one within DFR reads Braille. [Filing No. 66-20 at 38, 41–42  (DFR  \n30(b)(6) A. Shields Dep. pp. 99:1–6,  102:15–17,  103:3–104:6).].  Defendants did not begin to \nsend Mr. Meyer Braille documents until after August 7, 2019.  [Filing No. 66-3 at 30 (C. Meyer \nDep. p. 51:6–9)];  [Filing No. 66-27 at  25). Defendants did not begin to send Ms.  Meyer  Braille  \ndocuments until after September 26, 2019. [Filing No. 66-29 at 2.].   \n  Plaintiffs Christopher Meyer and Sarah Meyer reported several problems with the Braille \nthey received from Defendants, including errant symbols, uncollated pages, and Braille  printing \nalong page perforations. [Filing No. 66-3 at 36–38 (C. Meyer Dep.  pp. 57:24–59:25)]; [Filing  \nNo. 66-4 at 35–39 (S. Meyer Dep.  pp. 46:25–50:5).].  Plaintiffs’ Braille expert, Jennifer Dunnam,  \nreviewed several Braille documents  Christopher Meyer  received,  and thermoform copies of those  \ndocuments, and confirmed problems with the quality of the Braille.

[Filing No. 66-25 at 11]; [Filing No. 66-24 at 5–6  (J. \nDunnam Dep. pp. 18:13–19:25).].  As a result, punctuation and symbols are  represented with \ndifferent  characters from  what should appear in a standard Braille document. [Filing No. 66-25 at  \n11.].  Ms.  Dunnam also reported that the margins in some documents were  not respected, \nresulting in unreadable lines of text. [Filing No. 66-25 at 11.].  Pages were not collated  and \nmaterial  in tables were presented in a list without the proper  formatting. [Filing No. 66-25 at 11]; \n[Filing No. 66-24 at 15–19 (J.

Several  \ndocuments had large sections of blank space  and improper paragraph formatting. [Filing No. 66-\n25 at 12]; [Filing No. 66-24 at 7 (J. Dunnam Dep. p. 20:2–16).].  Ms.  Dunnam concluded that  \nmost documents “reflect[] “little to no knowledge  on the part of the preparer of how to properly \nformat and translate a Braille document or how to verify a Braille document for accuracy.” \n[Filing No. 66-25 at 13.].  The quality of the Braille was so poor  as to render the documents  \n“impossible to read, or would take hours for  a reader to understand.”  [Filing No. 66-25 at 13.].  \nIV.   Defendants’ Websites   \n  DFR does not  maintain  any written policies on website accessibility, nor does  it maintain  \nany written or internal policies regarding website testing and compliance  for accessibility  \npurposes.

[Filing No. 66-21 at 13 (DFR  30(b)(6) Dep. J.

Montgomery Dep. p. 87:1–12).].  The Benefits Portal allows  Medicaid, SNAP,  and  TANF  \n“clients or authorized representatives or  citizens in general to apply for  Indiana-provided social  \nservice—or social  –  social program assistance.” [Filing No. 66-21 at 47–48 (DFR 30(b)(6) J. \nMontgomery Dep. pp. 67:19–68:10)]; [Filing No. 66-16 at 7 (S.

[Filing No. 66-21 at 48–49 (DFR  \n30(b)(6) J. Montgomery Dep. pp. 68:6–69:6).].  Traffic on the Benefits Portal totals in the  \n“hundreds of thousands over the course of  a year.”  [Filing No. 66-21 at 10–11(DFR  30(b)(6)  \nDep. J. Montgomery pp. 12:19–13:21).].  Online applications are the most  popular method for  \napplying for benefits and account for 60 to 80 percent of applications. [Filing No. 66-21 at 12–13 \n(DFR  30(b)(6) Dep. pp. J. Montgomery 14:12–15:6).].   \n  While DFR controls the  Benefits Portal website, it has contracted with RCR Technology \nfor management of the Benefits Portal.  [Filing No. 66-14 at 38 (A. Shields  Dep. p. 176:3–7)];  \n[Filing No. 66-21 at 15  (DFR  30(b)(6) Dep. J. Montgomery p. 17:8–11)]; [Filing No. 66-22 at 7 \n(G. Hart Dep. p. 26:4–17).].  Other than the requirement in the RFP that contractors comply with \nfederal law, DFR does not provide  any additional guidance  regarding accessibility requirements. \n[Filing No. 66-17 at 18 (J. Montgomery Dep. p. 61:2–20)]; [Filing No. 66-22 at 7–8  (G. Hart  \nDep. pp. 26:18–27:6).].  DFR delegates compliance with federal law  to RCR technology.  [Filing  \nNo. 66-14 at 51 (A Shields Dep. p. 189:9–20).].  DFR has  also  delegated all accessibility testing  \n7  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 15 of 44 PageID #: 1302\nand maintenance of the Benefits Portal to RCR Technology.  [Filing No. 66-21 at 20–21 (DFR  \n30(b)(6) J. Montgomery pp. 22:19–23:2)]; [Filing No. 66-16 at 14 (S.

[Filing No. 66-17 at 20–24 (J. Montgomery Dep. pp.  63:12–67:3).].  \nFSSA Homepage  and Indiana Medicaid  \n  The FSSA homepage (www.IN.gov/FSSA)  “is meant to be the home page  and the front  \ndoor of  [the] agency” and is akin to a landing page for visitors to “steer people in all of the right  \ndirections to –  help them get services.” [Filing No. 66-19 at 39 (FSSA 30(b)(6) Dep. J. Linder  p. \n77:5–15).].  Similarly, the Indiana Medicaid website (www.IN.gov/Medicaid) is the “home page \nand landing page” for  Indiana Medicaid. [Filing No. 66-19 at 46–47 (FSSA 30(b)(6)  Dep. J. \nLinder  pp. 86:14–87:19).].  The FSSA home page  and the Indiana  Medicaid landing page are \nowned by FSSA and managed by Indiana  Interactive, a State contractor.  [Filing No. 66-19 at 7, \n9–11 (FSSA 30(b)(6) J.  Linder pp. 45:15–21; 47:8–49:11)]; [Filing No. 66-10 at 10–11.].  FSSA  \ncontrols the content  and  color scheme  of the FSSA homepage  and Indiana Medicaid page, but  it \ndoes not control the domain,  hosting,  or technical  development. [Filing No. 66-19 at 54–55 \n(FSSA 30(b)(6) J. Linder Dep. pp. 115:11–116:5).].  \nV.   Barriers on Defendants’  Websites   \nA.   Testing and Barriers Admitted by Defendants   \nBenefits Portal  \n  Three  different individuals or entities tested the  DFR Benefits Portal  for accessibility: \nRon Mis, Joe Montgomery, and RCR Technology. [Filing No. 66-21 at 24 (DFR 30(b)(6) J. \nMontgomery p. 26:2–17).].  DFR employee Ron Mis completed testing of the Benefits Portal  \n8  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 16 of 44 PageID #: 1303\nusing JAWS and was unable to independently access the online application, due to accessibility \nbarriers on the website.  [Filing No. 66-38 at 2–4]; [Filing No. 66-14 at 58–64 (A. Shields Dep.  \npp.  198:10–204:20).].  The testing performed by Joe Montgomery, an information technology \ncontractor  reporting to FSSA and DFR  was  “informal” “not exhaustive” and “cursory.” [Filing  \nNo. 66-17 at 7 (J. Montgomery Dep. p. 15:7–13)]; [Filing No. 66-21 at  75–77 (DFR 30(b)(6)  J. \nMontgomery Dep.  pp. 109:2–111:19).].  RCR Technology performed accessibility testing on \nthree dates—August 7, 2019, September 12, 2019, and September 24, 2019—and reported \nseveral barriers  or “limitations”  to DFR.  [Filing No. 66-21 at 31–32 (DFR 30(b)(6) J.  \nMontgomery Dep. pp. 45:1–46:7)]; [Filing No. 66-22 at 15–16 (G.

Testing and Barriers Identified by Plaintiffs’ Expert  \n  Plaintiffs’ web accessibility expert, Terri Youngblood, reviewed Defendants’ websites  \nand noted many accessibility issues. See generally  [Filing No. 66-26 at 13–71.]. Ms.  Youngblood \nanalyzed Defendants’ websites against the World Wide Web Consortium  Web Accessibility \nGuidelines (“WCAG”) 2.1, which includes all guidelines in WCAG version 2.0. [Filing No. 66-\n23  at  7 (T. Youngblood Dep. p. 13:11–20)]; [Filing No. 66-26 at 16.]. All of the accessibility  \nproblems that  Ms.  Youngblood examined can  be resolved if Defendants’  websites were coded to  \ncomply with the WCAG standards. [Filing No. 66-23 at 15 (T. Youngblood Dep. p. 84:12–20).].  \nBenefits Portal  \n  Terri Youngblood observed several barriers on the Benefits Portal website.  See generally  \n[Filing No. 66-26 at 51–71.]. The orange and white color combination on the  pop-up login \nwindow that appears on the  Benefits Portal page suffers  from poor color  contrast. [Filing No. 66-\n26 at  56.].  The “Forgot User  ID”  and “Forgot Password”  links  on the pop-up window are  not  \nkeyboard accessible  [Filing No. 66-26 at 57.].  Within the online application for benefits, help  \n9  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 17 of 44 PageID #: 1304\nicons  are  not accessible throughout the application. [Filing No. 66-26 at  58.].  In addition, several  \ntext  fields  where users are required to enter data are not accessible.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 59–71.].  \nAt virtually every page in the  online application, these “form  fields” are  not announced via  \nscreen  access software and a blind user  cannot determine  what information to enter into  the \nunlabeled fields. [Filing No. 66-26 at 59–71.].  Terri Youngblood concluded that the online  \napplication is not fully accessible to the  blind due to barriers that prevent  blind individuals  from  \ncompleting the form and that the Benefits Portal may be made  accessible using proper coding \nstandards. [Filing No. 66-26 at 71.].  \nFSSA Homepage  \n  On the FSSA homepage, Terri Youngblood noted that the  search option is not labeled as  \na button or a link, so a screen reader would interpret the search option as static text only. [Filing  \nNo. 66-26 at 23.].  The “advanced search” feature at the bottom of the page is similarly not  \naccessible because the labels identifying the text fields in which a user would enter search terms  \nare not read to screen reader users.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 23.].  The side navigation  buttons on the  \nFSSA homepage are not  recognized as expandable links, so a screen reader user cannot navigate  \nto any pages within the expand controls. [Filing No. 66-26 at 24.].  \n  On the Child Care and Education page, the pop-up window that appears on the “Find \nChildcare” feature is not focused, so an individual using a screen reader  does  not know this pop-\nup window has opened and therefore  cannot read any text within the window. [Filing No. 66-26 \nat 28.].  The text fields  allowing a user to filter  childcare  results is inaccessible to screen  reader  \nusers. [Filing No. 66-26 at 29.]. Terri Youngblood also reported several problems with tables. \n[Filing No. 66-26 at 34, 38.]. One table showing monthly limits and the maximum SNAP  \nallotment is  not accessible.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 34.]. The table headers  are  not  coded properly, \nso there is no clear relationship between the information in the header  cells and data cells.  [Filing  \n10  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 18 of 44 PageID #: 1305\nNo. 66-26 at 34.].  For example,  if  properly coded,  when a blind user tabs through a calendar,  \nJAWS will read Monday the first, Tuesday the second and so on, but the  way  Defendants  have  \ncoded tables,  JAWS reads the days of the week, in order, and then simply reads the dates, \nwithout the associated day information.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 4,  ¶ 10, 34.].  Another table to  \ndetermine what is covered by Indiana Medicaid is  also  not properly marked, resulting in header  \ncells that are  not associated with data cells.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 38–39.].  \n  Other tools on the website are inaccessible. The HIP Eligibility and Contribution \nCalculator  is  not accessible  because the fields to enter information are not  properly labeled \n[Filing No. 66-26 at 35.].  Similarly, the option to search and find a local DFR office is not  \naccessible.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 34.].  The search  box announces  “Frame Edit” rather than the \nlabel to search for  a local DFR office.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 34.].  \nIndiana Medicaid  \n  The Indiana Medicaid page lacks a visual focus on the main menu. [Filing No. 66-26 at  \n40.]. The visual focus tool is primarily for keyboard users who rely on keyboard navigation and \nprovides on-screen indications of what objects or  links are in focus as  a user tabs through a  \nwebpage [Filing No. 66-26 at 21.].  The page also  suffers from poor color  contrast ratio. Color  \ncontrast ratios should be  4.5:1, and the  orange  and white color combination results in a ratio of  \nonly 2.9:1. [Filing No. 66-26 at 41.].  The blue background with white text  color  combination \nresults in a color contrast ratio of 3.9:1. [Filing No. 66-26 at 42.].  The  chartreuse background \nwith white  text color combination  has a color contrast ratio of 1.7:1 [Filing No. 66-26 at 42.]. \nMenus on the website  are  not accessible using keyboard navigation. [Filing No. 66-26 at 43.].  At  \nleast two documents  on the website are  not accessible—either because text fields  on the  \ndocument  are  not fillable,  or because the documents  are  scanned and  appeared as a static image \nrather than  readable text. [Filing No. 66-26 at 45.].  \n11  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 19 of 44 PageID #: 1306\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW   \nUnder Rule  56 of the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court must  “grant summary \njudgment if the movant shows that  there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the  \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The relevant inquiry is  \n“whether there is the need for a trial—whether, in other words, there  are any genuine factual  \nissues that properly can be resolved only by a  finder of fact because they may reasonably be  \nresolved in favor of either party.” Anderson  v.  Liberty  Lobby,  Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250  (1986).  \nARGUMENT   \nTo  establish a violation of Title II of the ADA, “the plaintiff must prove that he is a  \n‘qualified individual with a disability,’ that he was denied ‘the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity’ or otherwise subjected to discrimination by such an entity, and \nthat the denial or discrimination was ‘by reason of’ his disability.”  Wagoner  v.  Lemmon, 778 \nF.3d 586, 592 (7th Cir. 2015)  (citing  Love  v.  Westville  Corr.  Ctr.,  103 F.3d 558, 560 (7th \nCir.1996)).  Entities that receive federal financial assistance are subject to Section 504. 29 U.S.C.  \n§ 794(a).  Claims under Section 504 are  “functionally identical” requiring a  plaintiff to allege  \n“(1)  he is a qualified person (2) with a disability and (3) the state agency denied him access to a  \nprogram or activity because of his disability.”   Id.  (citation omitted); see also Vaughn v. \nWalthall, 968 F.3d 814, 819 (7th Cir. 2020)  (stating that “there is no material difference between  \n[the ADA  and the Rehabilitation Act]”).  There is no dispute that Defendants are public entities  \nthat receive federal financial assistance and are therefore subject to Title II of the ADA  and  \nSection 504.  \n12  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 20 of 44 PageID #: 1307\nI.   The Individual  Plaintiffs  and Other Members of the National Federation of the \nBlind, Inc.  Are Qualified Individuals with Disabilities Under the ADA  and  Section  \n504.   \nA.   Christopher Meyer, Sarah  Meyer, and  other NFB  members,  including Kaiti \nShelton,  are individuals with disabilities.  \nThe ADA defines  “disability,”  with respect to  an individual,  as a person with  “a physical  \nor mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life  activities.”  42 U.S.C. § \n12102(1)(A).  “Seeing” is among the major life activities.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2)(A); see also  \n28 C.F.R. § 35.108(d)(2)(iii)(B)  (“Blindness substantially limits seeing[.]”).  “An  impairment that \nsubstantially limits one major life activity need not limit other major life activities in order to be  \nconsidered a disability.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(C).  \nSiblings  Christopher and Sarah Meyer  live with Leber’s Congenital Amaurosis, an eye  \ndisorder that causes vision loss.

Mr. Meyer has significant vision loss;  he \nnavigates using a cane and cannot read large print. [Filing No. 66-3 at 6–8 (C. Meyer Dep. pp. \n10:22–12:3).].  Sarah Meyer also has significant vision loss. She  can perceive some light  but  \ncannot recognize  any types of print, whether standard print or large print. [Filing No. 66-4 at 7–9 \n(S. Meyer Dep. pp. 8:23–10:9).].  Both Christopher Meyer and Sarah Meyer  read Braille and rely  \non Braille to read print documents. [Filing No. 66-3 at 18 (C.

The  NFB has approximately 50,000 members—113 of whom reside in Indiana. \n[Filing No. 66-7 at 3–4.].  While some NFB members are sighted, they make up less than five  \npercent of the total membership. See [Filing No. 66-13 at 7 (Pres. Riccobono Dep. p. 15:2–9).].  \nKaiti Shelton is a blind NFB member residing in Indiana. [Filing No. 66-11 at  2,  ¶ 1.].  She \ncannot read print documents and relies on Braille  or accessible electronic formats. [Filing No. \n66-11 at  2,  ¶ 3.].   \nB.   Christopher Meyer, Sarah Meyer, and  other NFB members  residing in \nIndiana  are qualified  individuals.   \n“Under  Title  II, a  qualified  individual is an individual with a  disability, who  with  or  \nwithout  reasonable  modifications  to  rules  meets the essential eligibility requirements for the  \nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.”  Washington  v.  Indiana  High  \nSch.  Athletic  Ass’n,  Inc., 181 F.3d 840, 849 (7th Cir. 1999)  (emphasis omitted); see also  \n42  U.S.C. §  12131(2). Similarly, under the  Rehabilitation  Act, “an otherwise  qualified  person is  \none who is able to meet all of a program’s  requirements in spite of his handicap  with  reasonable  \naccommodation.”  Indiana High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, Inc., 181 F.3d at 849.  (citation omitted)  \n(emphasis omitted).  \nChristopher Meyer, Sarah Meyer, and NFB member Kaiti Shelton  meet the essential  \neligibility requirements to participate in Defendants’ public benefits programs  and to access  \nDefendants’ websites  concerning those programs.  Both Christopher Meyer  and Sarah Meyer  are \nresidents of  Indiana and receive  Medicaid and SNAP  benefits through FSSA and DFR. See  \n[Filing No. 66-39 at 2]; [Filing No. 66-28 at 2.].  Kaiti Shelton is a resident of  Indiana  and a \nrecipient of  Indiana  Medicaid benefits. [Filing No. 66-11 at  2,  ¶¶ 1–2]. Current  and prospective  \nbenefits  recipients  are eligible to use Defendants’  websites  to obtain information related to the  \napplication and receipt of benefits.  Indeed, the very  purpose of the  Benefits Portal  website is to  \n14  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 22 of 44 PageID #: 1309\nallow individuals  to submit  online  applications for Medicaid, SNAP, and TANF benefits.

Linder Dep. pp. \n86:14–87:19)  (describing purpose of  FSSA Medicaid page).].  \nII.   Defendants’ Public  Benefits  Programs and Websites  Are  Services,  Programs, or  \nActivities  Subject to Title II  of the ADA  and Section 504.   \n“[W]hether  a  particular  event  is  a  service,  program,  or  activity  of  a  public  entity  turns  on  \nwhat  the  public  entity  itself  is  doing,  providing,  or  making  available.  Ashby  v.  Warrick  Cnty.  Sch.  \nCorp., 908 F.3d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 2018).  Title II  broadly covers  “all services, programs, and \nactivities  provided or made available  by public entities”  28 C.F.R. § 35.102  (emphasis added) \nand  includes  “anything a  public entity does.” 28 C.F.R. § Pt. 35, App. B. Under Section 504, a \n“program or  activity”  is also broadly defined and extends to “all of the operations” of the entity. \n29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(1)(A).   \nWebsites operated by a public entity are covered by the ADA  and Section 504. “[S]uch \nsites must provide their services in an  accessible manner or provide an accessible alternative to  \nthe website that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”  28 C.F.R. § Pt. 35, App. A.  \nPublic entities that choose to provide services through web-based applications (e.g., \nrenewing  library  books  or  driver’s  licenses)  or  that  communicate  with  their  \nconstituents  or  provide  information  through  the   Internet   must  ensure  that  \nindividuals with disabilities have equal  access to such services or information,  \nunless doing so would result in an undue financial and administrative burden or a  \n15  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 23 of 44 PageID #: 1310\nfundamental alteration in the nature of the programs, services, or activities being \noffered.   \n \nId.1  The regulations of the Department of Justice  (“DOJ”) implementing Title  II are entitled to  \ndeference and “warrant respect.”  Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 597–98 (1999). Guidance from  \nthe DOJ regarding interpretation of its own regulations is similarly entitled to deference.  See \nSteimel v. Wernert, 823 F.3d 902, 911 (7th Cir. 2016)  (citing  Olmstead  and stating that the  \ndegree of deference owed to DOJ’s guidance under Title II is to  “defer to an agency’s \ninterpretation of its own regulation unless the agency’s interpretation is plainly  erroneous or  \ninconsistent with the regulation or there is reason to suspect that the agency’s interpretation does  \nnot reflect the agency’s fair and considered judgment on the matter in question”).   \nCourts in other Circuits have interpreted the ADA  to apply to a  Title II or Section 504 \ndefendant’s website. See  Hindel v. Husted, No. 2:15-cv-3061, 2017 WL 432839, at *5  (S.D. \nOhio Feb. 1, 2017)  (granting permanent injunction to Plaintiffs requiring Ohio Secretary of State  \nto make its website accessible and finding that Plaintiffs established that website violated Title  II  \nof the ADA because it was inaccessible to blind individuals utilizing screen access software); see  \nalso Innes v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Md., No. DKC-13-2800, 2015 WL 1210484, at  \n*10  (D. Md. Mar. 16, 2015)  (finding that Section 504 applied to content on Defendant-\nUniversity’s  website  because the website  was properly considered a “program or activity” of the  \n \n1  Under Title III of  the ADA, the Seventh Circuit has  recognized that  the ADA reaches wherever a  defendant  \nprovides  its services, including over  the Internet. See  Morgan  v.  Joint  Admin.  Bd.,  Ret.  Plan  of  Pillsbury  \nCo.  &  Am.  Fed’n  of  Grain  Millers,  AFL-CIO-CLC, 268 F.3d 456, 459 (7th Cir. 2001)  (analyzing claim  \nunder Title III and stating “An  insurance company  can no more  refuse to sell a  policy to a  disabled person  \nover the Internet  than a furniture store can refuse to sell furniture to a disabled person who enters the store  \n.  .  .  The site of  the sale is irrelevant  to  Congress’s goal  of  granting  the disabled  equal  access to  sellers of  \ngoods and services. What matters  is that  the good or service be offered to the  public.”);  accord Doe v.  \nMutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 179 F.3d 557, 559 (7th Cir. 1999)  (interpreting Title III of the ADA as  \nprohibiting the exclusion of people with disabilities from entering a  facility and using the facility in the  \nsame way as people without disabilities whether  the facility is “in physical  space or in  electronic space”).   \n \n16  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 24 of 44 PageID #: 1311\nentity  receiving federal financial assistance and  “‘Program or activity’  is defined as  all of the  \noperations of ‘a college, university, or other postsecondary institution, or a public system of  \nhigher education.’”)  (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)).   \nFSSA is an agency of the State of  Indiana that  administers Indiana’s health care and  \nsocial services programs. DFR is a division of FSSA responsible for administering Medicaid, \nSNAP, and TANF benefits. See [Filing No. 66-14 at 7–8 (A. Shields Dep. pp. 45:17–46:19).].  \nSuch benefits  programs clearly fall within the scope of a “service, program, or activity” of a  \npublic entity under the ADA. Defendants’ websites, which  convey information related  to their  \nbenefits programs  and allow individuals to submit  online applications for benefits, are \nthemselves a “service, program, or activity” of the public entity.   \n  Defendants maintain and support the Benefits Portal through a vendor, RCR Technology. \nSee [Filing No. 66-9 at 19–21.]. The central purpose of the Benefits Portal is to allow Indiana  \nresidents to apply for public assistance benefits  online. See [Filing No. 66-17 at 39 (J. \nMontgomery Dep. p. 87:1–12)]; [Filing No. 66-21 at 7–8 (DFR 30(b)(6) Dep. J. Montgomery pp. \n9:7–10:13).].  The website is  also  mandated by several federal agencies, including the \nDepartment of  Health and Human Services, Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Administration  \nfor Children and Families, and Food and Nutrition Services.  [Filing No. 66-21 at 7–8 (DFR  \n30(b)(6) J. Montgomery Dep. pp. 9:7–10:13).].  Visitors to the Benefits Portal website may also  \naccess “downstream tools” that allow them to “check the status of pending  applications,” “check  \ntheir eligibility  status in general,” “provide online changes . . . in status” and utilize a “screening \ntool . . . to determine if . . . there’s a possibility [to be]  eligible for one of the programs.”  [Filing  \nNo. 66-21 at 47–49 (DFR 30(b)(6) Dep. J. Montgomery pp. 67:19–69:6).].  Web traffic on the \nBenefit Portal totals  “hundreds of thousands” of visitors over the course of  a year,  [Filing No. \n17  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 25 of 44 PageID #: 1312\n66-21 at 10–11 (DFR 30(b)(6) Dep. J. Montgomery pp. 12:19–13:11)], and approximately “60 to \n80 percent” of all benefits applications submitted to DFR  are received through the Benefits  \nPortal. [Filing No. 66-21 at 12–13 (DFR 30(b)(6)  Dep. J. Montgomery pp. 14:17–15:6).].  \n  Defendants acknowledge that their websites are a gateway to information concerning \nIndiana’s  public assistance benefits.  The FSSA home page was described as a “front door of  \n[the] agency”  whose purpose is “to steer people in all of the right directions to –  help them get  \nservices.” [Filing No. 66-19 at 39 (FSSA 30(b)(6)  Dep. J. Linder  p. 77:5–19).].  FSSA’s  \nMedicaid page is similarly “the landing page  and the home page  for Medicaid specifically.”  \n[Filing No. 66-19 at 46–47 (FSSA 30(b)(6) Dep. J. Linder  pp. 86:14–87:19).].  Both domains are  \na critical access point for resources and services. From the  FSSA home page, visitors can reach  \npages for  each division within FSSA. Visitors may also: obtain resources for child-care and  \neducation, such as  finding  licensed  child-care providers using an interactive search tool; obtain \nassistance seeking employment; access information about the various benefits programs  \navailable and  eligibility requirements; and locate the nearest local DFR office.  See [Filing No. \n66-26 at 16–17.]. On the  Indiana Medicaid domain, users may apply for Medicaid coverage, find \na Medicaid provider, and learn information regarding Medicaid member rights and \nresponsibilities, among other things. [Filing No. 66-26 at 17–18.]. The  amount of information \nconveyed on Defendants’ websites is extensive, and the websites allow for  users to both learn \ninformation and engage in necessary transactions to obtain benefits.  \nIII.   Defendants Are Violating  Title II of the  ADA and  Section 504.  \nTitle II of the ADA guarantees  qualified individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity \nto access the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity. 42 U.S.C. § \n12132. The regulations implementing Title II  provide that a public entity providing any aid, \nbenefit or service may not discriminate on the basis of disability  by:  “deny[ing] a qualified \n18  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 26 of 44 PageID #: 1313\nindividual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or  \nservice,” see  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(i), “afford[ing] a qualified individual with a disability an \nopportunity to participate in or benefit from the  aid, benefit, or service that  is not equal to that  \nafforded  others” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii), or  by “provid[ing]  a qualified individual with a  \ndisability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to \nobtain the same result, to gain the same  benefit, or to reach the same  level of achievement as that  \nprovided to others.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iii). Public entities must also  make reasonable  \nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures  when the modifications are necessary to avoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7)(i).  \nUnder Title  II,  a public entity is liable for its own discriminatory actions and the  \ndiscriminatory actions of private entities with whom it has a contractual relationship.   See, e.g., \n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)  (“[a] public entity, in providing any . . . service, may not,  directly or  \nthrough contractual . . . arrangements [discriminate] on the basis of disability”); 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35 \nApp. B  (2017) (“All governmental activities of public entities are covered, even if they are  \ncarried out by contractors.”). According to Title  II’s Technical Assistance  Manual, a defendant  \nmay be  liable for the violations of  its  contractors even if those contractors are private  entities not  \nthemselves  subject to Title II.   See Technical Assistance Manual, 42 U.S.C. § 12206(c)(3), Part  \nII-1.3000.   \n  Section 504 prohibits an entity receiving federal financial assistance from failing to \n“[a]fford a qualified [individual with a disability] an opportunity to participate in or benefit from  \nthe aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others,”  or providing qualified \n[individuals with disabilities] with “an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that \nprovided to others.” 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(1)(ii)-(iii); see  45 C.F.R. § 84.52(a)(2)-(3).  \n19  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 27 of 44 PageID #: 1314\nTitle II  and Section 504 specifically require  public entities  and federally funded programs  \nto offer communications with individuals with disabilities that are as effective as  \ncommunications with others, and to provide  auxiliary aids and services  where necessary to afford \nindividuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a  \nservice, program, or  activity of a public entity. See generally  28 C.F.R. § 35.160. For the  \ncommunications to be effective, “auxiliary aids and services must be provided in  accessible \nformats, in a timely manner, and in such a way as to protect the privacy and independence of the  \nindividual with a disability.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2).  Public entities must give  “primary  \nconsideration to the requests of individuals with disabilities”  when considering what types of  \nauxiliary aids and services are necessary. Id.   \nDefendants  have failed to provide Plaintiffs  with  equally effective access to Defendants’  \nprint and website communications and, as a result, have  denied  Plaintiffs an equal opportunity to \nparticipate  in and  enjoy the  benefits of  Defendants’  services, programs, or  activities. Plaintiffs  \nand blind Hoosiers cannot access vital correspondence and information  in a manner that is “equal  \nto that afforded others.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii).   \nA.   Defendants’ print communications are inaccessible to the blind.   \nDefendants routinely communicate with  Hoosiers receiving health coverage benefits and \nfood and cash assistance  through written correspondence. Such correspondence includes notices  \nregarding Medicaid, SNAP, and/or TANF  approvals, renewals, discontinuances, and denials, \nname change notices, interview appointment notices, redetermination summaries, and proof of  \neligibility notices,  among other  communications. See [Filing No. 66-9 at 12–17.].  Defendants  \nprovide all written correspondence in standard print unless  the benefits  applicant or recipient \naffirmatively requests an  alternative format.  [Filing No. 66-14 at 17–18 (A. Shields Dep.  pp.  \n69:13–70:13).].   \n20  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 28 of 44 PageID #: 1315\nDefendants’ records demonstrate multiple  requests for Braille correspondence from  \nChristopher Meyer  beginning on December 13, 2017. See [Filing No. 66-27 at 2, 4,  5, 28, 32, 35 \n(demonstrating requests for Braille on January 29, 2018, January 31, 2018, May 1, 2018, June  \n14, 2018  and June 29, 2018, February 4, 2019).].  Defendants first  mailed  Mr. Meyer  Braille  \ndocuments on August 7, 2019—one day after the  filing of Plaintiffs’ complaint. See  [Filing No. \n66-27 at  25]; [Filing No. 66-3 at 30 (C. Meyer Dep. p. 51:6–9)  (Mr. Meyer  stating that he  first  \nreceived Braille documents “three or  four days  after we filed the complaint”).].  Sarah Meyer’s  \nrequested  Braille on May 13, 2019  and May 21, 2019, see  [Filing No. 66-34 at 2–3] and \nDefendants did not begin mailing  Ms.  Meyer  Braille documents until after  September 26, 2019. \n[Filing No. 66-29 at  2).  Similarly, Kaiti  Shelton requested Braille correspondence on April 18, \n2019 and has yet to receive any Braille documents from Defendants. [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  ¶ 6.].  \nWhile Defendants have started to  provide  Braille  documents to Christopher Meyer  and Sarah  \nMeyer, the quality of the Braille is so poor  that  it is at times  wholly unreadable.  [Filing No. 66-3 \nat 36–37 (C. Meyer  Dep.  pp. 57:24–58:20)]; [Filing No. 66-4 at 41–42  (S. Meyer  Dep. pp. \n52:25–53:11).].  \nDefendants lack proper  staff training and quality control measures to ensure that its  \nBraille communications are  accessible.  Braille that is indecipherable, or of  such poor quality that  \nit takes hours for a blind individual to understand, violates Title II and Section 504.  \n1.   Defendants’ Braille documents are low-quality  and demonstrate a  \nlack of knowledge regarding proper Braille production.  \nAt Plaintiffs  Christopher Meyer’s  and Sarah Meyer’s depositions, they each testified to \nthe myriad problems with the quality of Defendants’ Braille documents, including indecipherable  \nsymbols and improper formatting and spacing.  One  Braille document that was mailed to Mr.  \nMeyer contained  the Indiana State seal, which obscured the date and month at the top of the  \n21  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 29 of 44 PageID #: 1316\nletter.  See [Filing No. 66-3 at 36–38 (C. Meyer Dep.  pp. 57:24–59:25 (describing problems with \nBraille documents).].  The Braille documents that  both Mr. Meyer and Ms.  Meyer  received were \nin a single stack, uncollated, and attached in a “fan-fold formation”  with Braille characters  \nprinted along the perforated edges, making it  difficult or near-impossible  to read the Braille text \nwhen  the pages were separated.  [Filing No. 66-3 at 36–38 (C. Meyer Dep. pp. 57:24–59:25)];  \n[Filing No. 66-4 at 36  (S. Meyer Dep.  p.  47:2–12).].  Sarah Meyer  testified during her deposition \nthat a copy of a Braille  document  that she had received included “wonky symbols” and was  \nprepared in uncontracted Braille, making it difficult to read. [Filing No. 66-4 at 38–39 (S. Meyer  \nDep. pp. 49:12–50:1).].  She described the Braille as “very poor.” [Filing No. 66-4 at 44 (S. \nMeyer Dep.  p. 55:22).].  \nPlaintiffs’ Braille expert, Jennifer Dunnam,  confirmed the poor quality of the Braille  \ndocuments that Mr. Meyer and Ms.  Meyer  received, stating in her report that  the documents “did \nnot show even a basic understanding of the standard representative  capitalization, numbers, \npunctuation, contractions, and formatting for navigability.”  [Filing No. 66-25  at 9.].  Ms.  Dunnam  \nnoted several problems  with the Braille documents. First, some documents were prepared using \nASCII, or  “computer Braille” which lacks standard translation for punctuation and symbols. \n[Filing No. 66-25  at 10.].  Second, some documents were not collated or formatted with proper  \nmargins. [Filing No. 66-25  at 11.]. Other documents contained large  amounts of blank space or  \nlacked page numbers  altogether.  [Filing No. 66-25  at 12.]. Certain lines in the documents were  \nillegible and contained anomalous symbols. [Filing No. 66-25  at 12–13.]. Ms.  Dunnam opined \nthat the documents “reflect little to no knowledge on the part of the preparer of how to properly \nformat and translate a Braille document or how to verify a Braille document for accuracy.” \n[Filing No. 66-25  at 13.].  Ms.  Dunnam concluded that “[i]n most instances, the quality of the  \n22  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 30 of 44 PageID #: 1317\nBraille is so poor that the documents are impossible to read,  or would take hours for a  reader to \nunderstand. [Filing No. 66-25  at 13.].  \nThe quality of Defendants’  Braille documents is a direct reflection of the inadequate \ntraining Defendants  provide  their  staff on how to produce  Braille communications and the  lack  \nof any quality control measures to ensure that  all Braille communications are accessible.  DFR  \nemployee,  Jasmine Holliday,  is responsible for preparing DFR’s Braille correspondence. [Filing  \nNo. 66-15 at 10 (J. Holliday Dep. p. 19:6–11).].  Ms.  Holliday does not read Braille and has no \nBraille certifications.  [Filing No. 66-15 at 8, 17 (J. Holliday Dep. pp. 17:2–5; 27:13–18).].  She \ntestified  during her deposition that she relies  exclusively  on a computer program for Braille  \ntranscription and cannot independently confirm that the Braille text is accurate.  [Filing No. 66-15 \nat 18–22 (J. Holliday Dep. pp. 28:16–32:13).].   \n  Ms.  Holliday received little training on Braille production. An employee of  the Division \nof Disability and Rehabilitative  Services  instructed  Ms.  Holliday on how to use  an embosser that  \nDFR  purchased for the purpose of producing Braille documents, and Ms.  Holliday  attended a \nweb-based  Braille  training program. [Filing No. 66-15 at 7, 30–31 (J. Holliday Dep. 16:11–12;  \n83:11–84:3)]; [Filing No. 66-14 at 28–30 (A. Shields Dep. pp. 125:7–127:2).].  Defendants  \nacknowledged that after  a Braille document is prepared, they take no  steps  to independently \nverify that the document is legible and accurate to  a Braille reader.  See [Filing  No. 66-20 at  42– \n43  (DFR  30(b)(6)  A. Shields  Dep. pp. 103:3–104:1)]; [Filing No. 66-14 at 31 (A. Shields  Dep. p. \n128:1–9).].     \n2.   Defendants’ contractors continue to provide inaccessible standard \nprint documents.  \nWhile Defendants have started to provide  Braille  documents  to Mr. Meyer  and \nMs.  Meyer,  their contractors  do not  provide  documents in alternative  formats.  For example,  \n23  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 31 of 44 PageID #: 1318\nChristopher Meyer  and Kaiti  Shelton continue to receive standard print notices from Managed \nHealth Services  (“MHS”), a health insurance provider servicing Indiana Medicaid recipients. \n[Filing No. 66-11 at  2–3,  ¶¶ 2, 9]; [Filing No. 66-12,  at 2  ¶ 3.].  Mr. Meyer  has made multiple \nrequests to MHS for Braille communications, including most recently in  or about January 2020. \n[Filing No. 66-12 at 2,  ¶ 3.].  To date, MHS has not provided any Braille communications to \nMr.  Meyer.  [Filing No. 66-12 at 2,  ¶ 3.].  Rather, MHS continues to send standard print notices to \nMr. Meyer that  contain critical information about  his benefits, including notices denying \ncoverage for prescription medication and mental health services.  [Filing No. 66-12 at 2–3  ¶¶ 3– \n5.].   \nMs.  Shelton notified MHS that she is blind and requested all print correspondence in \nBraille or electronic format.  [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  ¶ 8.].  While MHS has provided some general  \ndocuments, such as member brochures and flyers in an accessible electronic format, MHS has  \nyet to provide any correspondence specific to Ms.  Shelton in either an accessible electronic \nformat or Braille.  [Filing No. 66-11 at  3,  ¶ 9.].   \nB.   Accessibility barriers  exist on Defendants’ websites.  \n  For sighted and blind persons, the Internet is a significant source of information, services, \nand transactions with instant and 24/7 availability and without the need to travel to attain them. \nThe blind access the  Internet from mobile devices and/or personal computers by using keyboards  \nor touch-screen gestures  in conjunction with screen access software, which  vocalize textual  \ninformation presented visually on a computer screen or display that information on a user-\nprovided refreshable  Braille display. JAWS  and NVDA  are two examples of such screen-access  \nsoftware,  commonly referred to as “screen readers.”  Director Shields acknowledged that JAWS  \nis the  most utilized  software by visually-impaired recipients.  [Filing No. 66-14 at 71–74 (A.  \nShields Dep. pp. 221:8–224:7).].  Screen access software provides  the only method by which \n24  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 32 of 44 PageID #: 1319\nblind persons can independently access the  Internet and associated computer programs. When \nInternet websites are not  designed to allow for use with screen access software, blind persons  are  \nunable to fully access the information, products, and services offered through the Internet.  \n  The barriers described below  were identified by Plaintiffs’ expert, Terri Youngblood, \nduring her evaluations of Defendants’ websites. Defendants have maintained throughout this  \nlawsuit that its websites  are accessible, see [Filing No. 66-16 at 18–19 (S. Beam Dep.  pp. 50:17– \n51:1)]; [Filing No. 66-21 at 69–70 (DFR 30(b)(6)  J. Montgomery Dep. pp. 103:11–104:4)]; \n[Filing No. 66-14 at 47 (A. Shields Dep  p. 185:6–10)]; [Filing No. 66-19 at 60–61 (FSSA  \n30(b)(6)  Dep. J. Linder  pp. 121:10–122:4)], yet  there is no evidence in the record that the \nbarriers no longer exist, nor is there any evidence to rebut or contradict  Ms.  Youngblood’s  \nfindings.  \n3.   Accessibility barriers  pervade the Benefits Portal.  \nDefendants’ websites  contain accessibility barriers that  preclude blind individuals from  \naccessing vital information. Mr. Meyer testified to the barriers he encountered on the Benefits  \nPortal when attempting to apply for benefits  on or about March 2018. [Filing No. 66-3 at 43–44 \n(C. Meyer Dep.  pp. 64:11–65:4).].  Mr. Meyer was unable to complete the  application \nindependently because certain text fields on the application page, known as  “form fields,” were \nnot accessible.  [Filing No. 66-3 at 43–44 (C. Meyer Dep.  pp. 64:11–65:4).].  Plaintiffs’ web  \naccessibility expert, Terri Youngblood, confirmed the existence of such barriers and identified \nseveral other  barriers  across the Benefits Portal website. See  generally  [Filing No. 66-26 at 51– \n71.].  \n  Ms.  Youngblood reported  barriers on the Benefits Portal landing page and within the  \nonline  benefits  application process.  See  generally  [Filing No. 66-26 at 51–71.].Within the online  \napplication, Ms.  Youngblood confirmed Mr. Meyer’s experience that at many places throughout  \n25  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 33 of 44 PageID #: 1320\nthe online application, form fields  are  not read aloud to a blind person using a screen reader. \n[Filing No. 66-26 at 51–71.]. For  example, on the page where applicants input their home  \naddress, the following fields, among others,  are  inaccessible: (1) country; (2) Do you have  a  \nmailing address  different than your home address?; (3) Are you currently enrolled in a health \nplan or program?  See  [Filing No. 66-26 at 60.]. In the “Information About You” section of the  \nonline  application, the following form fields, among others, are  also inaccessible: (1)  Suffix; (2) \nGender; (3) Marital Status; (4) State; (5) County; (6) How many people are  living at this address  \nincluding you?; (7) Are you currently enrolled in a health plan or program?  [Filing No. 66-26 at  \n61.].  Several other pages  within the online application contained inaccessible form fields, \nincluding the following pages: More About You; Tobacco Usage  Information About You; More \nContact Information; Additional Information; Navigator Information; Health Plan Selection; \nHousehold Member Details; More Household Members; Household Relationship; Additional  \nInformation for  all Applicants; Tax dependent  Information; Income Information; Resource \nInformation; and Mail Authorize Representative  Form and Voter Registration Form.  [Filing No. \n66-26 at 62–71.].  \n  In addition to inaccessible form fields on the Benefits Portal application, \nMs.  Youngblood also  observed  color  contrast issues and inaccessible icons  throughout the  \nBenefits Portal website.  The orange background with white text color combination on the  \nBenefits Portal login pop-up is “exceedingly difficult to read for people who are Blind.”  [Filing  \nNo. 66-26  at 57.]. Similarly, “[g]reen buttons with white text are  also difficult to read” and “do \nnot meet color contrast requirements.”  [Filing No. 66-26 at 57.]. Additionally, the login page  of \nthe Benefits Portal includes inaccessible “Forgot  User  ID/Password” links,  and the icons for  an \n26  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 34 of 44 PageID #: 1321\napplicant to request help are only accessible if  a mouse hovers over the icon; the help icon is not  \naccessible via a screen  reader.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 57–58.].  \n4.   Accessibility barriers  are present  on Defendants’ other  webpages.  \nMs.  Youngblood reported accessibility barriers on the FSSA website (www.in.gov/fssa), \nthe Indiana Medicaid website (www.in.gov/medicaid),  and several webpages within those \ndomains. Ms.  Youngblood tested the FSSA and Indiana Medicaid domains  and sub-domains  in \nMarch 2020 and noted many  barriers,  including the following:  \nA user cannot access the “search” button by using keyboard navigation and the  \nbutton is not labeled as such, so a screen reader interprets  this button as static text  \nonly.  \n \nThe “Advanced Search” feature at the bottom of the FSSA home page contains  \nunlabeled form fields.  \n \nThe “search results” page does not announce when no results are  found.  \n \nThe drop-down buttons in the side navigation column are not recognized by screen  \nreaders as  expandable buttons, so a blind user cannot navigate to any information \nwithin the drop-down menus.  \n \nWithin the “Child Care and Education” page, the pop-up window that appears after  \na user selects the “Find  Childcare” feature is not accessible. The window does not  \nappear to a screen reader user and therefore the text inside the window is not  \nannounced.  \n \nThe form fields to filter a list of Child Care providers are “completely inaccessible  \nfor people who use a screen reader.”  \n \nThe color-coded Child Care and Development  Fund Eligibility Map is  not fully  \ntagged for accessibility, and therefore  a blind individual  does  not know what  \ninformation is contained in the map.  \n \nA  table  illustrating   the  income  limits  and  maximum  SNAP  allotment  is  not  \naccessible. The table’s headers are not associated with the cell data,  and screen  \nreader users  are not able  to determine SNAP income limits.   \n \nThe search box to find a local DFR office does not  announce that it is a search box,  \nbut rather announces  “Frame Edit,” so a blind individual using a screen reader  is \nunable  to access the search tool.  \n \n27  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 35 of 44 PageID #: 1322\nThe form  fields in the  HIP  eligibility and contribution calculator  are not labeled.  \nA  blind person using a screen reader would only hear the word “edit” on each form  \nfield.  \n \nHIP  documents and press releases  are  minimally  accessible. Some documents  are  \nscanned,  static  documents,  which  a  screen  reader  cannot  recognize.  Other  \ndocuments  are  text files  with missing tags and alt text on headers.  \n \nThe Medicaid home page contains  text and images with poor color contrast, lacked  \na visual focus, and do  not announce the side menu.  \n \nAt least two forms on the Medicaid page—the “Authorized Representative Form”  \nand  the  Indiana  Health  Coverage  Programs  “Personal  Representative \nAuthorization”  form—are  accessible to read, but not fillable, thereby preventing a  \nblind user from inputting any information into the forms.  \n \nSee generally  [Filing No. 66-26 at 22–45.].  The myriad accessibility barriers on \nDefendants’ websites demonstrate that Defendants fail to communicate with blind users  \nas effectively as they  communicate with sighted ones.  \n5.   Defendants lack policies and procedures to identify and remediate \naccessibility barriers.   \nDefendants  have acknowledged  that  they completely delegate ADA compliance to their  \nvendors.  [Filing No. 66-21 at 20–24, 59–60 (DFR  30(b)(6) Dep. J. Montgomery pp. 22:19–26:1;  \n79:20–80:12).].  With respect to the Benefits Portal,  the only “policy” that DFR communicates to \nits vendors  concerning website accessibility is  its  expectation that the vendor complies with all \nfederal laws.  See [Filing No. 66-17 at 14, 16–18 (J. Montgomery Dep. pp. 57:2–12; 59:16– \n61:1).].  This expectation is  included in the vendor  contract,  and DFR provides no further support  \nor guidance  regarding compliance. [Filing No. 66-17 at 18–19 (J. Montgomery Dep. pp. 61:21– \n62:11).].  Jeffrey Montgomery testified during his deposition that DFR  expects  the vendor to \n“figure out federal law for themselves and figure out policies for themselves  . . .”  [Filing No. 66-\n17 at 18 (J. Montgomery Dep. p. 61:2–10).].  Not only does DFR lack its own  policies regarding \nwebsite accessibility, it has no policy to monitor accessibility compliance through routine  \n28  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 36 of 44 PageID #: 1323\nwebsite  testing or audits.  [Filing No. 66-21 at 39–40, 61–62 (DFR 30(b)(6) Dep. J. Montgomery \npp. 59:15–60:5,  81:18–82:3).].  Jeffrey  Montgomery testified during his deposition that, while  \nDFR utilizes testers to monitor its websites for compliance with business requirements, those  \ntesters do not monitor accessibility.  [Filing No. 66-17 at 20–21, 22–24, 46  (J. Montgomery Dep. \npp. 63:12–64:9,  65:19–67:3, 120:6–20).].  Vendors  working with DFR are  expected to maintain  \ncompliance, [Filing No. 66-17 at 21–22 (J. Montgomery Dep. pp. 64:10–65:18)], and to \nremediate  any errors they might find. [Filing No. 66-17 at 28–29 (J. Montgomery Dep.  pp. \n71:16–72:7).].  DFR has  no policy in effect  to verify whether  an accessibility barrier has been  \nsuccessfully remediated.  [Filing No. 66-17 at 29–32 (J. Montgomery Dep. pp. 72:8–75:14).].  \nFSSA takes a similar hands-off approach to website accessibility issues.  In its vendor  \ncontracts,  FSSA communicates its expectation that the vendor  will comply  with Section 508 of  \nthe Rehabilitation Act. [Filing No. 66-19 at 19–20, 29–32 (FSSA 30(b)(6)  Dep. J. Linder  pp. \n57:10–58:3; 67:7–70:12).].  However, FSSA does not perform ongoing testing specifically for  \naccessibility issues and  has no dedicated employees responsible for  ensuring that its homepage  \nand  Indiana Medicaid websites are accessible.  [Filing No. 66-19 at 15, 29–32  (FSSA 30(b)(6) \nDep.  J. Linder  pp.  53:3–11; 67:7–70:12).].  FSSA performs regular tests and audits of its websites  \nto assess for functionality, but it does not  specifically  test for accessibility.  [Filing No. 66-19 at  \n22–25, (FSSA 30(b)(6)  Dep. J. Linder  pp. 60:18–61:14; 62:16–63:18).].   \nIV.   This Court Should Award Plaintiffs Injunctive Relief.  \nInjunctive relief is necessary and appropriate here because Defendants continue to deny  \nPlaintiffs equally effective access to print and website communications concerning life-\nsustaining government benefits. Defendants’  contractors continue to send standard print  \ndocuments,  and Defendants  lack the necessary training and policies to ensure that  all  Braille  \ndocuments they  produce  are  accessible. Accessibility barriers are also littered throughout \n29  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 37 of 44 PageID #: 1324\nDefendants’ websites,  and Defendants lack any policies or protocol to routinely identify and \npromptly remediate these barriers.   \nGiven these continued violations, this Court should grant a  permanent injunction \nrequiring Defendants and their contractors to (1) provide equal access to print communications in \nsecure,  accessible formats, including Braille; (2) remediate Defendants’ websites so that they  \nprovide equally effective communication to  the blind; and (3) implement policies, procedures, \nand practices to ensure that blind individuals are  consistently  provided with fully accessible \nalternative formats and websites are  continuously  maintained in an accessible state.  \nA.   Plaintiffs Satisfy the Four-Prong Test for Injunctive Relief.  \nTo obtain a permanent injunction, Plaintiffs  must demonstrate:  \n‘(1) that  [they]  ha[ve]  suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at  \nlaw, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3)  \nthat, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff[s]  and defendant[s], \na remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be  \ndisserved by a permanent injunction.’  \n \nVaughn  v.  Walthall,  968  F.3d  814,  824  (7th  Cir.  2020)  (citing  eBay  Inc.  v.  MercExchange,  \nL.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391  (2006)).  \n  Plaintiffs satisfy all four requirements.  First, Plaintiffs have suffered an irreparable injury  \nbecause they have  experienced, and continue to experience, the  denial of  equally effective \ncommunication. Despite repeated requests, Defendants  have ignored the  requests for Braille  \ncommunications from Christopher Meyer, Sarah Meyer, and Kaiti Shelton. Defendants still have \nnot produced any Braille documents to Kaiti Shelton. The quality of the Braille  that Defendants  \nhave produced  is  so poor that it  is at times  unintelligible or  requires  considerable effort on the  \npart of Mr. and Ms.  Meyer  to read.  Plaintiffs are  also deprived of an equal  opportunity  to  access  \nthe information and services Defendants make available to sighted individuals through their  \nwebsites. The accessibility barriers on Defendants’ websites preclude blind individuals from  \n30  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 38 of 44 PageID #: 1325\ncompleting applications for government benefits and from obtaining information related  to  \nbenefits programs and other  vital resources.  \nSecond, given the  discriminatory nature of the harm suffered by Plaintiffs, monetary \ndamages are inadequate to compensate for their injuries.   \nThird, a remedy in equity is warranted because Plaintiffs’ requested  relief  will not pose a  \nhardship to Defendants. To the extent that Defendants argue that they already provide Braille  \ncommunications and accessible websites, requiring Defendants to implement policies and \npractices to  ensure that the Braille communications are  accurate and  readable  and that website \nbarriers  are remediated is relatively insignificant.  Moreover,  the ADA  and Section 504 allow  \nDefendants to raise the  affirmative defenses of undue burden or  fundamental  alteration as an  \nexcuse to compliance, see  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(3); 28 C.F.R. § 35.164; 28 C.F.R. § 41.53. \nHowever, the record here  does not support either defense.  \nUnder Title  II of the ADA, an assessment of  whether compliance would result in an \nundue burden or  fundamental alteration “must be  made by the head of the  public entity or his or  \nher designee after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the  \nservice, program, or  activity.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.164. Here, neither the heads  of FSSA and DFR, or  \ntheir designees, have determined  that Plaintiffs’  requested relief  would pose an undue burden. \nSee [Filing No. 66-18 at  14–16 (FSSA 30(b)(6) Dep. A. Shields  pp. 61:3–63:16)]; [Filing No. \n66-20 at 55–57 (DFR 30(b)(6) Dep. A. Shields  pp. 137:12–139:20).]  For  Fiscal  Year 2020,  the \namount allocated in FSSA’s  general fund  is 4.9 billion dollars. [Filing No. 66-20 at 50–51 (DFR  \n30(b)(6) Dep. A. Shields  pp. 132:19–133:18).].  Of that amount, approximately 133 million \ndollars are  allocated to DFR.  [Filing No. 66-20 at  50–51 (DFR 30(b)(6) Dep. A. Shields  pp. \n31  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 39 of 44 PageID #: 1326\n132:19–133:18).].  The costs associated with Plaintiffs’ requested relief, relative to Defendants’  \navailable resources,  is likely to be  insignificant.  \nGranting a permanent injunction would also not  constitute a fundamental alteration.  \nDefendants already communicate with the constituents to whom they provide services. Plaintiffs’  \nrequested relief requires  Defendants to communicate with blind individuals in as equally \neffective a manner as  Defendants communicate with sighted individuals. Requiring Defendants  \nand their contractors to produce  accessible alternative formats, including  readable Braille \ndocuments,  and to remediate all accessibility barriers on their websites  promotes communication.  \nFinally, an injunction is in the public interest because it serves the broader  purpose of the  \nADA and Section 504  by ending the discriminatory treatment of individuals with disabilities and  \nmay benefit several hundred blind individuals  currently receiving government benefits  from the  \nState of  Indiana.  See  Mortland  v.  Lights  Out  Developments,  LLC, No. 1:19-CV-2557-JMS-DLP,  \n2020 WL 3577867, at *2 (S.D. Ind. July 1, 2020)  (“And finally, the public  has a strong interest  \nin eliminating discrimination and in enforcing the  ADA, as that statute was  intended to provide a  \nclear  and comprehensive  national mandate for the  elimination of discrimination against  \nindividuals with disabilities.”) (citation omitted); [Filing No. 66-14 at  25–26 (A. Shields. Dep. \npp. 122:17–123:10)  (noting that 200 blind individuals in Indiana are recipients of Medicaid for  \nthe Blind).].  \nB.   This Court Should Grant a Permanent Injunction Requiring  Defendants  \nand  their Contractors  to Provide Equal Access to  Print Communications  \nin  Secure, Accessible Formats.   \nDefendants and their contractors continue to deny equal access to their print  \ncommunications. Despite multiple requests for Braille or electronic  formats, FSSA and DFR  \nhave yet to produce any accessible  documents to Kaiti Shelton. [Filing No. 66-11 at 3,  ¶¶ 5–6.]. \nDefendants’ contractors similarly provide inaccessible print communications. [Filing No. 66-12 \n32  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 40 of 44 PageID #: 1327\nat 2,  ¶ 3]; [Filing No. 66-11 at 3,  ¶¶ 8–9.].  This Court should prohibit Defendants from violating \nTitle II  and Section 504 by requiring them  to provide blind persons with secure, accessible  \nformats.   \nThis Court should also require Defendants to implement  policies regarding  the timely  \nproduction of Braille documents, training  in Braille preparation,  and quality control measures  for  \nall Braille  documents  Defendants produce. Defendants must timely produce  print  \ncommunications in accessible formats and, where  there is a delay in the production of such \ncommunications, Defendants must extend any response period by at least the number of days  \nthat it took Defendants or their contractors to send the communications in the accessible formats. \nDefendants have implemented a policy for providing Braille communications when an applicant  \naffirmatively requests Braille as their  preferred alternative format. However,  as described above, \nthe quality of Defendants’ Braille documents is so poor that  substantial  information is unreadable  \nor requires great  effort on the part of the reader to understand. See generally [Filing No. 66-25 at  \n9–13.]. A policy requiring Defendants to adequately train staff in the preparation of Braille  \ndocuments and to implement quality assurance measures  would ensure that all future Braille  \ncommunications are accessible.   \nThe record demonstrates  that the  DFR  staff person responsible for producing  Braille  \ndocuments cannot read Braille, see [Filing No. 66-15 at 17 (J. Holliday Dep. p. 27:13–18)], and \nthat Defendants  have no procedure  to independently verify  the accuracy of  the Braille produced. \n[Filing No. 66-15 at 18–22 (J. Holliday Dep.  pp. 28:16–29:3,  30:14–31:16,  31:18–32:13).].  \nPlaintiffs’ expert, Jennifer Dunnam, testified that “someone with expertise in Braille should be  \ninvolved” in the production of Braille documents, “whether that person became an expert or was  \nhired as an  expert.” [Filing No. 66-24 at 14 (J. Dunnam Dep. p. 40:2–10).]  This recommendation \n33  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 41 of 44 PageID #: 1328\nis critical because Defendants lack the expertise to corroborate obvious deficiencies in the Braille  \ndocuments. Even after  learning of the issues that  Christopher Meyer  reported with the quality of  \nBraille documents he received,  FSSA  concluded that there were no errors in production that it  \nneeded to resolve. [Filing No. 66-18 at 7–9 (FSSA 30(b)(6) Dep. A. Shields  pp. 54:8–56:10).].  \nFor example, FSSA concluded that there were no issues with printing Braille documents as one  \ncontinuous sheet, see [Filing No. 66-18 at 7–8 (FSSA 30(b)(6) Dep. A. Shields  pp. 54:8–55:5).].  \nYet Jennifer  Dunnam explained in her report that  by leaving Braille documents in the “fan-fold \nformation,” the pages are not collated. [Filing No. 66-25 at 11–12.]  A  review of the  Braille  \ndocument by someone who can read Braille would identify these and other  errors before the \ndocument is mailed to FSSA and DFR constituents—a necessary backstop to producing \ninaccessible communications.  \nC.   This Court Should Grant a Permanent Injunction Requiring Defendants  to  \nRemediate Existing  Website Barriers and  Implement a Six-Part Protocol to \nMaintain Web Accessibility.   \nPlaintiffs’ web accessibility expert, Terri Youngblood, evaluated Defendants’ websites  \nagainst the World Wide  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (“WCAG”) version 2.1. WCAG  \n2.1. is widely viewed as the standard barometer for measuring website accessibility.2  \nMs.  Youngblood testified that developing Defendants’ websites according to the WCAG  2.1 AA  \nstandards would resolve the existing accessibility  problems. See generally [Filing No. 66-26 at  4, \n¶  11, 13–71]; [Filing No. 66-23 at 15 (T. Youngblood Dep. 84:12–20).]. This Court should order  \nDefendants to undertake  a full accessibility audit of each website and develop a remediation plan \nfor correcting existing barriers.  \n \n2   In 2017, the  federal government incorporated WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level  AA as the  standard with  \nwhich all federal agencies and contractors  must comply. See 80 Fed. Register 5790, 5791 (Jan. 18, 2017)  \n(codified at 36 CFR Parts 1193 and 1194).  \n34  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 42 of 44 PageID #: 1329\nIn  addition to remediating the current accessibility barriers,  Ms.  Youngblood  explained in \nher  expert report that  maintaining an accessible website  “requires the organization to develop \npolicies and procedures that make a commitment to compliance with accessibility standards.” \n[Filing No. 66-26 at 48.].  Ms.  Youngblood set forth six discrete steps that organizations should \ntake to ensure that accessibility practices are maintained long-term: (1) develop an accessibility  \npolicy which will establish the standards, the commitment, the roles and responsibilities, and \nimplementation processes; (2) hire or assign a web accessibility coordinator who is responsible  \nfor oversight of the  websites; (3) establish a remediation prioritization process; (4) develop or  \nobtain accessibility training for any staff that are responsible for updating or maintaining web \ncontent; (5) retain an independent accessibility consultant to provide a written evaluation of the  \nwebsites and to make recommendations to improve their accessibility; and (6) develop regular  \nmonitoring and reporting to ensure that accessibility is maintained.  [Filing No. 66-26 at 48.]  \nDefendants have failed to identify a web accessibility expert of their own to rebut or  \notherwise challenge the reasonableness and feasibility of  Ms.  Youngblood’s recommendations.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons described herein, this Court should enter judgment in favor  of Plaintiffs  \nand  require Defendants to: (1) ensure that Plaintiffs have equally effective access to Defendants’  \nprint communications; (2) remediate their websites so that the websites provide blind individuals  \nwith equal access to all information, transactions, and resources; and (3) adopt policies, \nprocedures, and training necessary to maintain effective communication with blind individuals.  \n \n   \n35  \n\nCase 1:19-cv-03311-JMS-TAB   Document 68   Filed 10/06/20   Page 43 of 44 PageID #: 1330\nDated:  October 6, 2020   Respectfully submitted,  \n \n/s/  Chelsea J.
