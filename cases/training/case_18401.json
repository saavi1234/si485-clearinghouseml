    "summary": "<p>On November 21, 2018, the plaintiff, a deaf woman, was arrested by the Anderson Police Department and transported to the Madison County Jail. The plaintiff was handcuffed behind her back while she was detained, preventing her from communicating using American Sign Language (ASL). Her requests for an interpreter were ignored and she was not provided with access to a qualified interpreter or other functional auxiliary aids (at one point, she was given a teletypewriter (TTY) but the facility lacked the equipment necessary for it to function). Medical staff also injected her with an unknown vaccination during the medical intake process. On November 13, 2020, the plaintiff, represented by Indiana Disability Rights (IDR), the state protection and advocacy entity, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against Madison County, the Madison County Sheriff's Department, the Madison County Commissioner&rsquo;s Office, and Madison County Council. The complaint alleged violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and various tort claims under state law. The plaintiff sought a declaration that her rights were violated, monetary relief, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya Walton Pratt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties entered into settlement discussions with the county&rsquo;s insurance carrier in the early stages of discovery. On April 1, 2021, the parties informed the court that a preliminary settlement agreement had been reached. The Clearinghouse was unable to obtain a copy of the settlement agreement, however, local news reported that the County approved a payment of $9,500 to the plaintiff. The case was dismissed on June 22, 2021.&nbsp;</p>",

On November 21, 2018, officers with the Anderson Police Department responded \nto a disturbance at 3610 Forrest Terrace, Anderson IN 46013.  \n2.  Ms. Ray was present at this address.  \n3.  Ms. Ray is Deaf and communicates using American Sign Language (“ASL”).  \n4.  Ms.  Ray  was  placed  under  arrest  by  the  Anderson  Police  Department  and \ntransported to the Madison County Jail. \n5.  The Madison County Jail is operated by the Madison County Sheriff’s Department.  \n6.  While detained within the jail, Ms. Ray was handcuffed behind her back. \n7.  As Ms. Ray communicates using ASL, the handcuffs completely prevented her \nability to sign or communicate.  \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02973-TWP-MG   Document 1   Filed 11/13/20   Page 2 of 10 PageID #: 2\n8.  Once her handcuffs were removed, Ms. Ray repeatedly tried to gesture and sign to \njail staff that she is deaf and needed access to a qualified ASL interpreter in order to effectively \ncommunicate.  \n9.  Ms. Ray’s requests for an ASL interpreter were ignored and denied. \n10.  At no time during her incarceration with the Madison County Jail was Ms. Ray \nprovided access to a qualified ASL interpreter or other auxiliary aids.  \n11.  Ms. Ray was unable to understand the instructions and processes she was expected \nto follow within the jail. \n12.  While in custody, Ms. Ray was fingerprinted, had her mugshot taken, and was taken \nto the medical department without ever having access to a qualified sign language interpreter or \nany other auxiliary aids to allow for effective communication.   \n13.  When completing the booking questionnaire, Ms. Ray wrote “I’m full Deaf” next \nto the question “Do you understand all the questions?”  \n14.  Also in the booking questionnaire, Ms. Ray responded to the question, “are you \nfearful for any reason?” by writing, “I’m alone! I’m deaf.” \n15.  The officers attempted to gesture to Ms. Ray to explain what she was required to \ndo within the jail; however, without effective communication methods, Ms. Ray was unable to \nunderstand what she was supposed to do.  \n16.  At no time during her arrest or incarceration were Ms. Ray’s charges ever explained \nto her.  \n17.  The only method of communication made available to Ms. Ray was written notes. \n18.  Ms. Ray’s first language is American Sign Language, not English.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02973-TWP-MG   Document 1   Filed 11/13/20   Page 3 of 10 PageID #: 3\n19.  Given  this,  exchanging  written  communication  was  labored,  confusing,  and \nineffective for Ms. Ray.  \n20.  Written communication is not Ms. Ray’s preferred method of communication, nor \nis it effective, especially in a stressful environment such as a jail.   \n21.  Ms. Ray also requested to have access to her video phone. \n22.  Her phone was in her possession when she was arrested. \n23.  Upon information and belief, Ms. Ray’s video phone was inventoried at the jail. \n24.  At no time did jail staff allow Ms. Ray to have access to her video phone in order \nto contact anyone. \n25.  Ms. Ray was detained without having the rules and procedures of the jail explained \nto her or any explanation as to how she might access services available within the jail – such as \naccess to a telephone, recreational or religious activities, or equal access to medical care as hearing \noffenders. \n26.  Ms. Ray was also taken to medical staff during her incarceration.  \n27.  After Ms. Ray’s weight and blood pressure were taken, she was given a piece of \npaper with information regarding “TB.”  \n28.  Ms. Ray only recalls being told, “TB,” and she was unable to read and understand \nthe paperwork provided. She did not know what “TB” meant and was unable to understand or \nanswer the nurse’s questions fully.  \n29.  Ms. Ray was then given an unknown injection on the top of her left forearm. Shortly \nafter receiving the injection, her arm was red and swollen. Ms. Ray also felt warm, had a dry mouth \nand recalls feeling dizzy.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02973-TWP-MG   Document 1   Filed 11/13/20   Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 4\n30.  Ms. Ray was frightened as she did not know what had been injected into her arm, \ndid not know if she was or could experience significant side effects, and was scared she would be \nsick. She also didn’t know if she required medical follow up care.  \n31.  Medical staff also failed to provide Ms. Ray with a qualified ASL interpreter or \nauxiliary aids when they attempted to ask her medical intake questions.  \n32.  Without an ASL interpreter or any other auxiliary aid, Ms. Ray was unable to \nunderstand what was being asked and was unable to provide staff with her complete medical \ninformation. \n33.  A  hearing  individual  would  have  been  provided  with  information  about  any \ninjection before administration as well as information about side effects, treatment, and likely \nwould have given his or her consent.   \n34.   Both  custody  and  medical  staff  refused  to  provide  Ms.  Ray  with  effective \ncommunication through a qualified sign language interpreter or any appropriate auxiliary aid.  \n35.  Without a qualified sign language interpreter or any other appropriate auxiliary aid, \nMs. Ray was unable to effectively communicate while in custody with jail personnel and medical \nstaff, and she did not have meaningful access to the services or information available to an inmate \nwho is hearing. \n36.  During her time in the Madison County Jail, officers attempted to communicate \nwith Ms. Ray by speaking. Ms. Ray could not understand them.  \n37.  Upon information and belief, these officers expected Ms. Ray to read their lips.  \n38.  Ms. Ray has very limited ability to read lips. \n39.  Lip reading is not an effective form of communication for Ms. Ray.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02973-TWP-MG   Document 1   Filed 11/13/20   Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 5\n40.  Being incarcerated without any way to effectively communicate was stressful and \nconfusing for Ms. Ray.  \n41.  When in her cell, Ms. Ray gestured through the window to staff that she needed to \nmake a phone call.  \n42.  In response, an officer took her out of her cell and provided a TTY, an outdated \ntechnology. \n43.  A TTY is a telecommunication device that allows a deaf individual to use the \ntelephone to communicate, by allowing her to use the phone to exchange written messages instead \nof talking and listening. \n44.  Ms. Ray attempted to plug the TTY into the phone provided by the correctional \nofficer with a cord. However, the officer did not have the power cord.  \n45.  The cord was never located so the TTY was inoperable and Ms. Ray was unable to \ncall any family members or friends during her incarceration.   \n46.  The Madison County Sheriff’s Office maintains a Jail Division policy, “Facility \nDisabled  Persons,”  where  staff  are  directed  to  approach  inmates  with  disabilities  in  a \ndiscriminatory manner as the policy states, “[c]orrectional officers are cautioned that persons with \ndisabilities often rely on their disability to attempt to manipulate and control their environment.  \nDo not be lulled into an unsafe practice.” \n47.  Defendants’ failure to provide Ms. Ray with effective communication via access to \nan ASL interpreter or any other auxiliary aid or service caused her to experience stress, trauma, \nand confusion during her incarceration. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:20-cv-02973-TWP-MG   Document 1   Filed 11/13/20   Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 6\n48.  Defendants’ obligation to provide Ms. Ray with effective communication during \nincarceration is well founded. (see Kennington v. Carter, 2004 WL 2137652 (S.D. Ind. June 28, \n2004)). \nPARTIES \n \n49.
