INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT \n1.  This case concerns the Defendants’ failures to provide needed mental \nhealth  services  to  tens  of  thousands  of  children  and  their  families,  which \nDefendants have a legal duty to provide, causing tragic and incalculable damage to \nhuman lives.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1188   Filed 02/13/22   Page 3 of 66\n \n2.  Historically, children with intensive mental health care needs were \neither  treated in  large  institutions or were  left untreated  and  faced  a  future  of \njuvenile  detention,  adult  incarceration,  homelessness,  and  ever-declining \npsychological, physical, and social conditions. There is now widespread agreement \namong  children’s  mental  health  experts  that  restrictive,  institutional  treatment \ncenters pose unacceptable risks and can be a harmful environment for children.   \nBy contrast, years of research and clinical experience have proven that intensive \nhome and community-based mental health services are both successful and cost \neffective. Such services are now relied upon as a necessary treatment modality, \neven for children with the most severe emotional and behavioral problems. As a \nresult,  courts  around  the  country  have  required  that  state  Medicaid  programs \nensure the provision of an array of services under Medicaid’s Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnostic and Treatment (“EPSDT”) requirements of Title XIX of the \nfederal Social Security Act (“Medicaid Act”). Recognizing their legal obligation \nand the effectiveness of such services, several states have voluntarily reformed \ntheir systems to ensure that such services are made available to their Medicaid \nchildren and youth. \n3.  By  failing  to  create,  provide,  and  support  Medicaid  services  in \nchildren’s  homes  and  communities,  and  only  offering  minimal,  if  any,  mental \nhealth services in restrictive institutional settings, the current system in Michigan is \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1189   Filed 02/13/22   Page 4 of 66\n \nplacing Plaintiffs and the members of the Plaintiff class at risk of (and in many \ncases  ensuring)  avoidable  psychiatric  hospitalizations  or  commitment  to  the \njuvenile delinquency system and permanent damage to their lives. \n4.  The  cost  of  failing to provide  necessary  treatment  and services  to \nchildren is well documented: inadequate care leads to a worsening of symptoms, \nwith costlier consequences requiring more expensive responses. The cost in lost \nopportunities to the children themselves—through higher school drop-out rates, \ninvolvement in the juvenile and criminal justice systems, and a very real prospect \nof  a  lifetime  of  cycling  in  and  out  of  state  psychiatric  hospitals—cannot  be \ncalculated. These are the many families devastated by the Defendants’ failure to \ncomply with the law and provide critical services needed by those entitled to them.   \n5.  The  harm  to  the  named  Plaintiffs  and  to  the  Plaintiff  class  is \nirreparable.  The  Defendants’  failure  to  ensure  the  provision  of  necessary \nbehavioral health services substantially harms each of the named Plaintiffs and \nPlaintiff class members as they remain without services, or spend days, weeks, \nmonths, and in some cases years, in institutions, detention centers, jail, and out-of-\nhome  placement  far  from  their  families  and  communities.  Injunctive  and \ndeclaratory relief are necessary and appropriate because, absent relief ensuring that \nthe  Plaintiffs  are  provided  necessary  and  legally  required  services,  the  named \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1190   Filed 02/13/22   Page 5 of 66\n \nPlaintiffs  and  the  class  they  represent  will  continue  to  suffer  irreparable  harm \nbecause of the Defendants’ continued violations of their legal rights.   \n6.  This  case  concerns  thousands  of  families  who  desperately  need \nbehavioral health services, such as Community Living Supports (“CLS”) services,1 \ncrisis  intervention  services,  and  other  intensive  home  and  community-based \nservices that the State of Michigan is required to offer. \n7.  The families discussed below, who have filed this action as a class, \nare suffering irreparable injury daily because of the State of Michigan’s wrongful \nfailure to provide the medically necessary services these children require. These \nfamilies are also representative of the numerous other Michigan families who have \nbeen denied access to medically necessary services by the State of Michigan, and \nwho are representative of a class of citizens who require the protections provided \nunder the United States Constitution and the Medicaid Act.  \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This  action  is  brought  pursuant  to  Title  II  of  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities  Act  (“ADA”),  42  U.S.C.  §  12132  et  seq.;  Section  504  of  the \n \n1 CLS services “are used to increase or maintain personal self-sufficiency, facilitating an individual’s achievement \nof his goals of community inclusion and participation, independence or productivity. The supports may be provided \nin the participant’s residence or in community settings.” Michigan Medicaid Provider Manual, Behavioral Health \nand Intellectual and Developmental Disability Supports and Services, Section 17.3.B. Coverage includes assisting, \nprompting, reminding, cueing, observing, guiding, and/or training in the following activities: laundry, meal \npreparation, household care and maintenance, activities of daily living (such as bathing, toileting, etc.), and shopping \nfor food and other necessities of daily living. Id. Coverage also includes, e.g., assistance with socialization and \nrelationship building, transportation to/from and participation in community activities, and assistance “with \npreserving the health and safety of the individual in order that he/she may reside or be supported in the most \nintegrated, independent community setting.” Id. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1191   Filed 02/13/22   Page 6 of 66\n \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794; and the Social Security Act, 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(r)(5), and 1396a(a)(43)(C).  \n9.  Jurisdiction is conferred on the Court by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343. \n10.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201, 2202; 29 U.S.C. § 794a; 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and 42 U.S.C. §12133.  \n11.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  District  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b) \nbecause the Defendants are sued in their official capacity and perform their official \nduties by and through offices within the District and thus reside therein, and a \nsubstantial  part  of  the  events  and  omissions  giving  rise  to  the  claims  herein \noccurred in this District. Some of the named Plaintiffs reside in this District.   \nIII.  PARTIES \nA.  The Plaintiff Children \n12.    The  Plaintiffs  in  this  lawsuit  consist  of  children  with  emotional, \nbehavioral, or psychiatric conditions who require intensive home-and-community \nbased behavioral health services. \n13.  Each Plaintiff is a Medicaid beneficiary who resides in Michigan or \nintends to reside in Michigan if appropriate home and community-based support is \nmade available to them. \n14. The Plaintiffs are all children with disabilities who reside in institutional \nsettings,  have  resided  there  in  the  past,  or  are  at  serious  risk  of  institutional \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1192   Filed 02/13/22   Page 7 of 66\n \nplacement unless they receive an array of intensive home and community-based \nservices. \n15. Plaintiffs bring this action through their parents or legal guardians or \nrepresentatives. Each Plaintiff is a Medicaid recipient for whom the Defendants \nhave  failed  to  arrange  and  provide  the  intensive  home  and  community-based \nservices in Michigan needed to correct or ameliorate their emotional, behavioral, or \npsychiatric condition. \nB.  The Defendants \n16.  Defendant  Michigan  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services \n(“MDHHS”) is the agency designated as the single state agency responsible for \nadministering and implementing Michigan's Medicaid program under 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(5). \n17.  Defendant Elizabeth Hertel is the Director of MDHHS.  \n18.  As  Director,  Defendant  Hertel  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that \nMichigan’s Medicaid program is administered and implemented consistent with \nthe requirements of federal law.    \n19. Defendant Hertel is sued in her official capacity. \nIV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n20. The Plaintiffs bring this action as a statewide class action pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2) on behalf of: All Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1193   Filed 02/13/22   Page 8 of 66\n \nunder the age of 21 in the State of Michigan for whom a licensed practitioner of \nthe healing arts acting within the scope of practice under state law has determined, \nthrough  an  assessment,  that  intensive  home-and-community  based  services  are \nneeded  to  correct  or  ameliorate  their  emotional,  behavioral,  or  psychiatric \ncondition. \n21. The Class is so numerous that joinder of all persons is impracticable. \nUpon information and belief, there are more than 60,0002 individuals potentially \neligible  to  receive  intensive  home  and  community-based  services  through  the \nMichigan  Medicaid  program,  who  are  unable  to  receive  the  services  that \nDefendants are required to provide. \n22. The Plaintiffs and Class Members have severe disabilities and limited \nfinancial resources. They are unlikely to institute individual actions. \n23. The claims of the Plaintiffs and Class Members raise common questions \nof law and fact. The factual questions common to the entire Class include whether \nthe Defendants’ system-wide policies, practices, and procedures have resulted in \nMedicaid  beneficiaries  under  the  age  of  21  being  unable  to  obtain  Medicaid-\ncovered, medically necessary, intensive home and community-based services. The \nlegal  questions  common  to  the  Plaintiffs  and  all  Class  Members  include:  (a) \n \n2 Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Report on CMHSPs, PIHPs \nand Regional Entities, Per Section 904(1) of PA 67 of 2019, \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/Section_904-1_715330_7.pdf (Last \nVisited February 3, 2022).\n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1194   Filed 02/13/22   Page 9 of 66\n \nWhether the Defendants have failed to “arrange for (directly or through referral to \nappropriate  agencies,  organizations,  or  individuals)  corrective  treatment  for \n[intensive  home  and  community-based  services]”  to  the  Plaintiffs  and  Class \nMembers as mandated by the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act pursuant to \n42  U.S.C.  §  1396a(a)(43)(C)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1396d(r)(5);  (b)  Whether  the \nDefendants have violated Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct  by  failing  to  arrange  for  Medicaid-covered,  medically  necessary  intensive \nhome and community-based services, thereby placing the Plaintiffs and the Class \nat  risk  of  unnecessary  institutionalization;  (c)  Whether  the  Defendants  have \nviolated Title II of the ADA or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing to \nensure that intensive home and community-based services are administered to the \nPlaintiffs and Class Members in the most integrated setting appropriate to their \nneeds; (d) Whether the Defendants have violated Title II of the ADA and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing to make reasonable modifications to their \nprograms and policies, which would result in the availability of intensive home and \ncommunity-based services; and (e) Whether the Defendants have violated Title II \nof the  ADA  and  Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act  by utilizing criteria or \nmethods of administration that have the effect of subjecting the Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers to discrimination on the basis of disability, or defeating or substantially \nimpairing accomplishment of the objectives of the Defendants’ program. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1195   Filed 02/13/22   Page 10 of 66\n \n24.  The Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the Class Members’ claims. None of \nthe Plaintiffs and Class Members is receiving the intensive home and community-\nbased  services  which  are  medically  necessary  and  are  required  to  correct  or \nameliorate their emotional, behavioral, or psychiatric conditions. \n25. The Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the Class because they \nsuffer  from the same  deprivations as the  other Class  Members  and have been \ndenied the same federal rights that they seek to enforce on behalf of the other Class \nMembers. \n26. The Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the \nabsent Class Members. \n27. The Plaintiffs’ interest in obtaining injunctive relief for the violations of \ntheir rights and privileges is consistent with and not antagonistic to that of any \nperson within the Class. \n28. The Plaintiffs’ counsel are qualified, experienced, and able to conduct \nthe proposed litigation. \n29.  Prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  individual  Class  Members  would \ncreate a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudication with respect to individual Class \nMembers, which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party \nopposing the Class or could be dispositive of the interests of the other members or \nsubstantially impair or impede the ability to protect their interests. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1196   Filed 02/13/22   Page 11 of 66\n \n30. A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and \nefficient adjudication of the controversy in that: (a) A multiplicity of suits with \nconsequent burden on the courts and the Defendants should be avoided; and (b) It \nwould  be  virtually  impossible  for  all  Class  Members  to  intervene  as  parties-\nplaintiffs in this action. \n31. The Defendants have acted or refused to act, and continue to act or \nrefuse to act, on grounds applicable to the Class, thereby making appropriate final \ninjunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the Class as a whole.  \nV.  STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nA.  Brief Overview of the Medicaid Program in Michigan for Individuals \nwith Developmental Disabilities and Serious Mental Illness. \n \n32. The Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 31, as if \nfully set forth herein. \n33.  The  Medicaid  program  is  jointly  funded  by  the  state  and  federal \ngovernment under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et \nseq. States are reimbursed by the federal government for a portion of the cost of \nproviding Medicaid benefits. \n34.  The  Medicaid  program  provides  medical  assistance  for  certain  low-\nincome children, families, pregnant women, individuals with disabilities, and the \nelderly. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1197   Filed 02/13/22   Page 12 of 66\n \n35. States are not required to participate in Medicaid, but once a state agrees \nto participate in Medicaid, it must comply with the requirements imposed by the \nAct. \n36.  Michigan  must  operate  and  administer  its  Medicaid  program  in \ncompliance with federal Medicaid statutes and regulations. \n37. States submit a plan for how the Medicaid program will be administered \nin accordance with federal law, called the State Plan. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). \n38. Under federal law, that State Plan must contain and describe the nature \nand scope of the State’s Medicaid program. 42 C.F.R. § 430.10. \n39. Federal law requires participating states to cover certain “mandatory” \nservices. One mandatory service is Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and \nTreatment services (“EPSDT”) for Medicaid-eligible children under the age of 21. \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A); 1396a(a)(43); 1396a(a)(4)(B); and 1396d(r). \n40. Further, states must provide Medicaid benefits to all eligible individuals \nwith reasonable promptness. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(a). \n41.  MDHHS  has  been  designated  as  the  single  state  Medicaid  agency \nresponsible for administering the Medicaid program in Michigan under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(5). \n42. MDHHS contracts the provision of services out to ten Prepaid Inpatient \nHealth Plans (“PIHPs”) throughout the state. 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2(a)(1)(B). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1198   Filed 02/13/22   Page 13 of 66\n \n43.  PIHPs  are  Medicaid  Managed  Care  Organizations  (“MCO”)  under \nM.C.L. § 400.109f. Under federal law, a Medicaid Managed Care Organization \nprovides or arranges for services under 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2(a)(1)(B). \n44.  Prepaid inpatient health plans are established through a procurement \nprocess  administered  by  MDHHS.  Some  Community  Mental  Health  Service \nProviders  (“CMHSP”)3  operate  as  PIHPs,  including  Wayne,  Oakland,  and \nMacomb.  Others  are  made  up  of  multiple  CMHSPs  and  cover  more  than  one \ncounty. \n45.  Medicaid-covered  specialty  mental  health  services  and  supports  for \nMedicaid  beneficiaries  with  a  serious  mental  illness,  developmental  disability, \nserious  emotional  disturbance,  or  substance  abuse  disorder  are  managed  and \ndelivered by those PIHPs. M.C.L. § 400.109f. \n46. Under M.C.L. § 400.109f, a PIHP “shall be responsible for providing \ndefined inpatient services, outpatient hospital services, physician services, other \nspecified Medicaid state plan services, and additional services approved by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid services under section 1915(b)(3) of title XIX \nof the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396n.” \n \n3 CMHSPs are agencies established under the Michigan Mental Health Code to \nprovide a comprehensive array of mental health services in their region (typically a \ncounty).  \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1199   Filed 02/13/22   Page 14 of 66\n \n47. All 10 PIHPs provide and arrange for Medicaid’s intensive home and \ncommunity-based services through the local Community Mental Health Service \nProviders. \n48. MDHHS is required to have methods of keeping itself informed of local \nagency  adherence  to  the  State  Plan  and  to  take  corrective  action  to  ensure \nadherence. 42 C.F.R. § 435.903. \n49. The Medicaid agency may not delegate, to other than its own officials, \nthe  authority  to  supervise  the  plan  or  to  develop  or  issue  policies,  rules,  or \nregulations on program matters. 42 C.F.R. § 431.10. \n50. In other words, MDHHS is required to make the rules and regulations \nthat it follows in administering the plan or that are binding upon local agencies that \nadminister the plan. 42 C.F.R. § 431.10. \nB.  Medicaid’s EPSDT and Reasonable Promptness Requirements. \n \n  51. Under federal law, the Defendants are mandated to provide Early and \nPeriodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment services to children under age 21 \nwith  reasonable  promptness.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396a(a)(10)(A);  1396a(a)(43); \n1396d(a)(4)(B); 1396d(r); 1396a(a)(8); and 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(a). \n  52. EPSDT services are defined under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5) as: \n[T]he term ‘early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment \nservices’ means the following items and services: . . . (5) Such other \nnecessary  health  care,  diagnostic  services,  treatment,  and  other \nmeasures  described  in  subsection  (a)  [42  USC  1396d(a)]  of  this \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1200   Filed 02/13/22   Page 15 of 66\n \nsection  to  correct  or  ameliorate  defects  and  physical  and  mental \nillnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether \nor not such services are covered under the State plan. \n \n  53. The PIHP contract is required by law to specify all mandatory benefits.  \nThe State must ensure that the PIHP has the capacity to offer the full range of \nnecessary  and  appropriate  preventive  and  primary  services  for  all  enrolled \nbeneficiaries.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2.  \n  54.  According  to  MDHHS’  contracts,  each  PIHP  must  have  network \nadequacy such that no Medicaid child is placed on a waiting list for services. \n  55. While states may adopt managed care concepts and contract with entities \nto oversee the delivery of services, arrange services through provider networks, \nand  deliver  services,  in  doing  so,  the  state  remains  responsible  for  ensuring \ncompliance with all relevant Medicaid requirements, including the mandates of the \nEPSDT program. 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2. \n  56.  Federal  law  requires  MDDHS  to  have  “methods  and  procedures”  to \nassure that payments to providers are consistent with “efficiency, economy, and \nquality  of  care  and  are  sufficient  to  enlist  enough  providers  so  that  care  and \nservices  are  available  under  the  Plan  at  least  to  the  extent  that  such  care  and \nservices are available to the general population in the geographic area.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n  57. Under EPSDT provisions, MDHHS must provide and make available all \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1201   Filed 02/13/22   Page 16 of 66\n \nthe services listed in 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a) when needed to correct or ameliorate a \npsychiatric, behavioral, or emotional condition. 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5). Just a few \nof the services included under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a) are: home health care services \n(42  U.S.C.  §  1396d(a)(7)),  rehabilitative  services  (42  U.S.C.  §  1396d(a)(13)), \ncommunity supported living arrangements (42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(23)), services in \nintermediate care facilities (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(15)), and inpatient psychiatric \nhospitalization (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(16)). \n  58. Michigan’s Medicaid Provider Manual requires: \nMedically  necessary  services  include  habilitative  or \nrehabilitative services that are expected to attain, maintain, or \nregain functional capacity and to achieve maximum health and \nfunction. A service need not cure a condition in order to be \ncovered under EPSDT, and maintenance services or services \nthat  improve  the  child's  current  health  condition  are  also \ncovered in EPSDT because they ameliorate a condition. The \ncommon definition of ameliorate is “to make more tolerable.”  \nThus, services such as physical and occupational therapy are \ncovered when they have an ameliorative, maintenance purpose.  \nMaintenance  services  are  defined  as  services  that  sustain  or \nsupport rather than those that cure or improve health problems.   \n \nMichigan Medicaid Provider Manual, EPSDT Chapter, Page 1. \n \n59.  Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services’ guidance similarly states: \nA service need not cure a condition in order to be covered under \nEPSDT. Services that maintain or improve the child’s current health \ncondition are  also  covered  in EPSDT because they  “ameliorate” a \ncondition. Maintenance services are defined as services that sustain or \nsupport  rather  than  those  that  cure  or  improve  health  problems. \nServices are covered when they prevent a condition from worsening \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1202   Filed 02/13/22   Page 17 of 66\n \nor prevent development of additional health problems. The common \ndefinition of “ameliorate” is to “make more tolerable.”4   \n \n  60.  EPSDT  services  include  all  forms  and  types  of  behavioral  health \nMedicaid services which are medically necessary for children. \n  61. MDHHS has mandated that each PIHP make EPSDT services available \nto  children  where  medically  necessary.  These  services  include,  among  many \nothers,  crisis  intervention,  CLS,  therapeutic  foster  care,  targeted  case \nmanagement/intensive  care  coordination,  and  home  and  community  based \nbehavioral health services and supports. \nC.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \n62.  Title  II  of  the  ADA  provides  that  “no  qualified  individual  with  a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n63.

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that segregation of individuals with \ndisabilities  “perpetuates  unwarranted  assumptions  that  persons  so  isolated  are \nincapable  or  unworthy  of  participating  in  community  life”  and  “severely \ndiminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, \nsocial contacts, work options, and economic independence.” Olmstead v.

Procedural Due Process. \n  71.  The  right  to  procedural  due  process  is  guaranteed  by  the  14th \nAmendment of the United States Constitution.  Individuals have a constitutionally-\nprotected  property  interest  in  public  benefits,  including  Medicaid.  Goldberg  v. \nKelly, 397 U.S. 254, 262 (1970). \n  72. Medicaid participants’ hearing and notice rights under Goldberg are \ncodified at 42 C.F.R. § 431.205(d): “The hearing system must meet the due process \nstandards set forth in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), and any additional \nstandards specified in this subpart.” \n  73. Under Goldberg, the state must provide “a meaningful notice stating the \nbasis for the action and, when coverage is to be reduced or terminated, a pre-\ntermination notice informing the claimant of the right to continue benefits pending \na final administrative decision.” \n  74. The Medicaid Act requires that “[a] State plan for medical assistance \nmust . . . provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State \nagency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is \ndenied or not acted upon with reasonable promptness.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n  75.  42  C.F.R.  §  431.206  requires  that  a  state  provide  notice  of  a \nbeneficiary’s right to a hearing and provide instructions on how to request it “[a]t \nthe time of any action affecting his or her claim.” \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1206   Filed 02/13/22   Page 21 of 66\n \n  76. Medicaid beneficiaries who  are  enrolled in  managed  care  plans are \nentitled to notice and opportunity for a hearing when the plan makes an “adverse \nbenefit  determination,”  which  includes  (a)  denial  or  limited  authorization  of  a \nrequested service, including determinations based on the type or level of service, \nrequirements for medical necessity, appropriateness, setting, or effectiveness of a \ncovered benefit; (b) reduction, suspension, or termination of an authorized service; \nand (c) failure to provide a service in a timely manner.  42 C.F.R. § 438.400(b). \n  77.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  78. MDHHS is failing to ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries under the age of \n21 with behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric disorders receive medically necessary \nintensive home and community based services required by law.  \n  79. Over the past few years, MDHHS has convened several workgroups to \nassess access to specialty mental health services. \n  80. One such workgroup was established and mandated by the Legislature, \nand consisted of PIHP network providers, MDDHS, CMHSPs, and others. It was \nestablished to “analyze the workforce challenges of recruitment and retention of \nstaff  who  provide  Medicaid-funded  community  living  supports,  personal  care \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1207   Filed 02/13/22   Page 22 of 66\n \nservices, respite services, skill building services, and other similar supports and \nservices.” Recruitment and Retention Challenges for the Workforce Delivering the \nMost Frequently Used Supports and Services (September 30, 2016), available at:  \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/Section_1009-3_530703_7.pdf. \n  81. This workgroup substantiated the difficulties Medicaid-funded agencies \nand beneficiaries have in attracting and retaining competent staff, which result in \n“negative outcomes and  consequences  for  beneficiaries,  their  employers,  direct \nsupport staff, the system of supports and services, and the state of Michigan.” Id. \n  82. The workgroup concluded that “the direct support workforce is woefully \nunderstaffed, rendering the Medicaid funded supports and services delivery system \nunstable. This instability has led to declines in access and quality of the supports \nand services delivered.” Id. \n  83. As  early  as 2016,5  MDHHS knew  it  was  not  fulfilling  its Medicaid \nmandates due to systemic problems with access to services, as evidenced by the \nworkgroup’s recommendations: \nAfter months of discussion and review of available data, the \nworkgroup on the direct support workforce mandated by the \nMichigan Legislature has concluded that the critically important \nfrontline  workforce  delivering  face-to-face  supports  and \nservices  to  the  state’s  residents  with  intellectual  and \n \n5 In fact, Michigan’s direct care staffing problems go back at least to 2013, when the Office of Services on Aging of \nthe Michigan Department of Community Health collected data on the direct-care workforce in \nhome and community-based services (HCBS) programs. This statewide survey revealed significant staff recruitment \nand retention problems. Findings from a Survey of Community Mental Health Provider Organizations.

Employers, including individuals using \nself-determination as well as organizational employers are not \nable to recruit and retain a qualified, competent workforce. In \norder to fulfill the service and support requirements of both the \nstate’s  Mental  Health  Code  and  the  Medicaid  program, \nadditional state investments and new state policies and practices \nare needed to secure the dignity, well-being, and independence \nof people living with disabilities.  \n \n  84. Despite the workgroup’s dire findings, Defendants did little to improve \nthe situation. In a 2019 report issued by another workgroup consisting of Region 6 \nproviders, the workgroup concluded that: \nThe  findings  in  the  2016  1009  Report  regarding  the  critical \nstaffing  shortage  have  not  improved.  Just  as  Direct  Care \nWorker (DCW) wages are underfunded, so are the providers’ \nreimbursement rates to be able to ensure quality care is supplied \nutilizing a stable workforce. There has been only one of the \n1009 Report recommendations that were partially implemented, \nand this was a .50 increase to DCW wages. The wage increase \nhad unintended negative consequences on providers. \n \n     Deconstructing the Direct Care Service Crisis (2019).

In a 2018 report, MDHHS highlighted the systemic problem of timely \naccess to services, this time in the context of psychiatric hospitalization services. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1209   Filed 02/13/22   Page 24 of 66\n \n  86. MDHHS had convened a workgroup to evaluate access to psychiatric \nhospitalization services in Michigan. The workgroup reported that “the crisis in \naccess to inpatient psychiatric services has continued unabated.”6 \n87. MDHHS’ report found that access is even more difficult for “individuals \nwith  complex  needs,  including  (1)  aggression,  (2)  intellectual  and/or \ndevelopmental disabilities (including Autism Spectrum Disorder), (3) substance \nuse disorders, and (4) medical co-morbidities. Individuals with complex needs are \nalso the most likely to be denied admission for inpatient psychiatric services.” Id. \n  88.  MDHHS  further  noted  that  limited  access  to  treatment  for  children \nresults in children cycling in and out of hospitals and jails: \nThe sub-workgroup members also noted that there is a lack of \ncontinuity of care when the individual is discharged from one \nprogram or department to another resulting in the individual not \nreceiving  services  in  a  timely  fashion  or  receiving  limited \nfollow-up of services, which contributes to recidivism.  \n  \nThe sub-workgroup members noted that (1) the limitations on \nmental health services at jails and jail diversion efforts and (2) \nongoing  barriers  to  accessing  community-based  services \ncontribute  to  the  increased  demand  for  inpatient  psychiatric \nservices. The sub-workgroup members specifically highlighted \nthat the shortage of crisis residential and after-care programs \nelevates the demand for inpatient psychiatric services.  \n  \nThe  sub-workgroup  members  also  emphasized  the  role  that \nstaffing  shortages  and  lack  of  specialized  trainings  for  staff \n \n6 Final Workgroup Report Michigan Inpatient Psychiatric Admissions Discussion, MICHIGAN \nDEPARTMENT  OF  HEALTH  AND  HUMAN  SERVICES  (Feb.  13,  2018), \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/MIPAD_WorkgroupReport_613570_7.pdf \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1210   Filed 02/13/22   Page 25 of 66\n \nhave  across  all  service  domains,  which  includes  psychiatry, \nsocial work, nursing, behaviorists, and behavioral technicians.  \n \n    Id. at 14. \n \n  89.  Other  reviews  conducted  recently  by  MDHHS  have  uncovered  and \nhighlighted significant contract violations which have resulted in hundreds, if not \nthousands,  of  children  not  receiving  authorized  medically  necessary  services. \nMDHHS has not demonstrated an ability to enforce compliance among the PIHPs \nwith any meaningful outcomes for those most in need. \n  90. Despite annual reporting data reflecting problems of access to services \nfor  children  with  more  intensive  service  needs,  Defendants  have  not  been \nproviding intensive home and community based services, including mobile crisis \nservices, to class members when medically necessary, and are wrongfully failing to \nprovide such services in violation of federal law. \n  91. In addition to intensive mobile crisis services, Defendants are failing to \nprovide  class  members  with  intensive  care  coordination,  intensive  home  and \ncommunity-based behavioral health services and supports, and therapeutic foster \ncare, which are all coverable rehabilitation services under the Medicaid Act. \n  92. The children in the class cannot obtain the medically necessary treatment \nthey require, resulting in, among other things, these children cycling in and out of \nthe hospital, being boarded in emergency rooms, being removed from their home \nto  receive  treatment  in  segregated  institutional  settings,  becoming  wards  or \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1211   Filed 02/13/22   Page 26 of 66\n \ndependents of the state, being jailed, unable to receive a proper education, and \nharmed because of the lack of provision of appropriate services. \n  93. The following are examples of the difficulties class members have faced \nin obtaining services under this poorly regulated system. \nThe Plaintiff Children \nD.D. (Genesee County) \n  94.  D.D.  is  a  11-year-old  Medicaid  beneficiary  from  Genesee  County, \nMichigan with significant mental health care needs. Due to lack of intensive home \nand community-based services, D.D. has been sent to emergency departments at \nleast thirty times during mental health crises and has been placed in a residential \ntreatment facility twice since 2019. \n  95.  Over  the  course  of  his  life,  D.D.  has  been  diagnosed  with  bipolar \ndisorder,  reactive  attachment  disorder  (“RAD”),  attention  deficit  hyperactivity \ndisorder (“ADHD”), obsessive-compulsive disorder (“OCD”), oppositional defiant \ndisorder (“ODD”), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, Autism, insomnia, and \nanxiety. \n  96. D.D. is not the only child with significant mental health needs in his \nhousehold. He has an 18-year-old brother who has been in and out of psychiatric \nhospitals for mental health treatment, and 3 other siblings with disabilities live in \nthe family home. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1212   Filed 02/13/22   Page 27 of 66\n \n  97. D.D.’s mother describes her home as a “psychiatric ward” and has paid \nout of her own pocket for home modifications necessary to prevent harm to her \nchildren when mental health emergencies arise. \n  98. D.D. began showing signs of extreme hyperactivity at the age of 3. D.D. \nwould not sleep for days and showed no connection with anyone. His mother \ndescribes  him  as  a  child  who  never  stopped  moving  and  experienced  severe \noutbursts of rage from a very young age. D.D.’s rage manifested in behaviors that \npresented a harm to himself and others in the home, including banging his head, \nbiting, pinching, and scratching himself or other people. \n  99.  Since  the  age  of  3,  D.D.  could  not  handle  being  told  “no”  or \ninterruptions in a set schedule, he was unable to be around other people without \ndirect supervision, and he exhibited an intolerance of water. \n  100. At the age of 3, D.D. was diagnosed with ADHD and Autism while he \nwas  at  the  Behavioral  Health  Unit  of  the  Riley  Children’s  Health  Facility  in \nIndianapolis. \n  101. D.D. was 4 years old when he first eloped from the family home. If his \nmother was unable to find him, she would call the police to help. While residing in \nIndiana, D.D. had a radio frequency tracker (which was provided by the County) \naffixed to his ankle so that the fire department could assist in locating him when \nhis mother was unable to prevent an elopement or intervene during one. Once D.D. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1213   Filed 02/13/22   Page 28 of 66\n \nmoved to Lansing, Michigan, his mother began purchasing monitors to help find \nD.D.  when  he  would  elope.  As  D.D.  got  older,  he  learned  to  take  off  these \nmonitors. \n  102. Elopements happened once or twice a month between the ages of 4 and \n6. Elopements increased to once a week once D.D. relocated to Lansing, Michigan \nat the age of 6. From the time D.D. was 8 years old, he began attempting to elope \non a daily basis, sometimes multiple times per day. His mother currently uses \nhouse alarms and motion detectors in addition to a personal monitor to monitor and \nattempt to prevent elopements. D.D. also has a history, since the age of 6, of \neloping from school. \n  103.  The  family  sought  services  for  D.D.  from  the  Community  Mental \nHealth Authority of Clinton, Eaton, & Ingham Counties (“CEI”) after relocating to \nLansing. \n  104. After completing an intake, D.D.’s mother was told he would have to \nbe  reassessed  for  Autism  related  services  and  was  offered  Medicaid  covered \nindividual therapy once a week and medication management. CEI failed to assess \nhim for Autism services during the time D.D. was a CEI consumer. When his \nmother would call CEI, she was told by a CEI employee that there was a year \nwaitlist for Autism assessment, and he was placed on that waitlist. \n  105. Over the course of his treatment at CEI, his diagnosis and medication \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1214   Filed 02/13/22   Page 29 of 66\n \nregiment changed several times. Despite the medication and individual therapy, \nD.D.’s behavioral issues grew more severe and frequent. \n  106. At the age of 8, D.D. moved to Flint, Michigan, where his mental \nhealth issues and behaviors worsened. \n  107. D.D. began receiving services from Genesee Health System, which \ninitially provided him case management and medication management Medicaid \nservices. \n  108.  After  case  management  and  medication  management  proved \nineffective, D.D.’s mother  made  repeated  oral  requests to his  case  manager  at \nGenesee  Health  System  for  Medicaid  covered  individual  therapy  and  respite \nservices, which were denied without appropriate written notice of his appeal rights \nor explanation for why he did not qualify for those services. \n  109. D.D. was placed in Harbor Oaks Hospital in the summer of 2020 and \nsuffered abuse from staff. He was discharged to his mother and, after a week at \nhome, his mother called the police to intervene in a mental health emergency. The \npolice took him to Hurley Hospital’s emergency department, which discharged him \nthe same  day. After  returning home  for  two weeks, his psychiatrist  called  the \npolice to intervene in a mental health emergency, and he was taken to Sparrow \nHospital’s emergency department, where he stayed in the emergency department \nfor 30 days waiting for a psychiatric bed to become available. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1215   Filed 02/13/22   Page 30 of 66\n \n  110. While in Sparrow Hospital, a supervisor at MDHHS, who his mother \nwas working with to get him approved for placement at the Hawthorn Center,7 \nadvised  his  mother  about  additional  Medicaid  services  that  should  be  made \navailable  to  him  through  the  CMH,  including  wraparound,  respite,  and  parent \nsupports.  Once  advised  of  these  specific  services,  his  mother  requested  those \nservice from Genesee Health System and was subsequently approved for each. \n  111.  Beginning  in  the  Fall  of  2020  D.D.  was  authorized  for  case \nmanagement,  medication  management,  wraparound  services,  parent  support, \nrespite, and individual therapy. He has also worked with a behavioral specialist as \na part of his plan of services, which was authorized and provided in the winter of \n2020. \n  112.  D.D.  has worked  with  two different  wraparound  coordinators  since \n2020,  and  his  wraparound  benefit  consists  of  a  weekly  meetings  with  D.D.’s \nbehavioral  specialist,  therapist,  mother,  and  wraparound  coordinators.  D.D.’s \npsychiatrist has never attended a wraparound meeting, and employees from his \nschool rarely attend. As of the filing of this Amended Complaint, meetings consist \nof only D.D.’s wraparound coordinator and mother. \n  113.  As  described  by  his  mother,  D.D.’s  first  wraparound  coordinator’s \nweekly  meetings  consisted  of  an  hour-long  discussion  of  D.D.’s  needs  and \n \n7 The Hawthorne Center is a State run children’s psychiatric hospital that provides intensive inpatient psychiatric \nservices to children and adolescents. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1216   Filed 02/13/22   Page 31 of 66\n \nbrainstorming how the treatment team could meet those needs so that all parties \nwere on the same page. With a second wraparound coordinator, who started in \nOctober 2021, the meetings have lasted about a half hour and are not focused on \nD.D.’s needs and how the treatment team will address those needs. \n  114. D.D. has Medicaid covered in-home respite care as a part of his plan of \nservice with Genesee Health System. However, D.D. has only received his respite \nbenefit twice, which consisted of an initial meeting and a single day of services \nprovision.  Genesee  Health  System  has  advised  D.D.’s  mother  that  she  must \nprovide this care as natural support due to the lack of available respite staffing. \nD.D.’s  mother  has  never  received  written  notice  advising  that  this  Medicaid-\ncovered service has been terminated, nor been advised that she can challenge the \nfailure to provide respite services in a Medicaid Fair Hearing.8 \n  115. D.D.’s mother has been informed by Genesee Health System that she \ncan access very limited mobile crisis services through the CMH. But mobile crisis \nservices in Genesee County are only offered 9-5 on weekdays, and consist only of \na crisis hotline number as opposed to timely mobile/on-site crisis services offered \nby a provider who is familiar with D.D. \n \n8 The failure to provide an authorized Medicaid service in a timely manner is an Adverse Benefit Determination \nwhich entitles a Medicaid consumer receiving specialty Medicaid services through a PIHP to written notice and \nadvice of rights to appeal. 438.400(b)(4).

Currently, the mobile crisis team at Genesee Health System will only \ncome out until 7pm on weekdays.

When D.D.’s mother called the crisis \nline, she was also forced to wait on hold, sometimes for over an hour, before \nconnecting with a CMH representative. \n  117. D.D. has never been able to access mobile crisis services outside of \nthese limited operating hours. \n  118. D.D.’s mother has contacted the crisis line at least 6 times, and has \nbeen told each time to take D.D. to the emergency department or call the police. \nD.D.’s mother no longer calls the crisis line, and instead takes D.D. directly to the \nemergency room or calls the police directly. \n  119. D.D. has never been provided or offered intensive care coordination. \nThe  home-based  services  and  supports  authorized  and  contained  in  D.D.’s \nIndividual Plan of Service (“IPOS”) fail to correct or ameliorate his mental health \ncondition. \n  120. D.D. was admitted to Pine Rest, a psychiatric hospital located in Gaines \nTownship, Michigan in the summer of 2021, and stayed in that facility for two and \nhalf weeks. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1218   Filed 02/13/22   Page 33 of 66\n \n  121. Since his stay at Pine Rest in the summer of 2021, D.D.’s mother has \nbeen told by Genesee Health System staff that he can no longer go to Pine Rest due \nto lack of beds and his violent behaviors. Genesee Health System’s staff have \nadvised D.D.’s mother that he has a sufficient level of services to address his needs \nin the home, and that hospitalization is not necessary for him. However, D.D.’s \nmother continues to have to take him to his local emergency department whenever \na mental health crisis arises. \n  122. When D.D. goes without necessary intensive home and community-\nbased services, his behavior escalates and mental health crises occur in his family \nhome. During mental health crises, D.D. has broken his mother’s knee, shoulder, \nand wrist. D.D. has communicated homicidal intentions to his mother and those \naround him when in crisis.  \n  123. As D.D. continues to go without intensive home and community-based \nservices, he becomes stronger, bigger, and more capable of behavior that his aging \nmother cannot reasonably handle without the needed support and services in the \nhome. \n  124. Since his Summer 2021 stay at Pine Rest, D.D. has been repeatedly \ndenied psychiatric hospitalization at The Hawthorn Center and psychiatric units in \nprivate hospitals due to being considered too dangerous and due to hospital “bed” \nshortages.  D.D.  is  repeatedly  sent  home  from  emergency  departments  and \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1219   Filed 02/13/22   Page 34 of 66\n \nresidential treatment facilities without the intensive home and community-based \nservices he requires. \nG.G. (Lapeer County) \n  125. G.G. is an 18-year-old Medicaid beneficiary. He has been diagnosed \nwith bipolar disorder, ADHD, and his treating doctors have noted symptoms of \nschizophrenia. He also has a developmental disability of Down Syndrome. \n  126. G.G. is a Lapeer County Community Mental Health consumer who is \nnot receiving the intensive home and community-based services he needs to correct \nor ameliorate his mental health conditions and reduce his behavioral symptoms. \n  127. G.G.’s biological grandparents (herein referred to as mother and father) \nhave adopted G.G. He calls them “mom” and “dad.” He is described as cuddly as a \nteddy bear until he has a “behavior” due to his mental health condition. \n  128. At the time G.G. resided in the family home, he weighed approximately \n300 pounds.  G.G.’s mental  illness leads to severe behavioral  outbursts, during \nwhich he has targeted his mother, who is petite and six inches shorter than he. G.G. \nwill throw anything in sight during his outbursts.   \n  129. As the result of G.G.’s problematic behaviors and lack of access to \nintensive home and community-based mental health services, his parents have had \nto replace all the windows in the home with plexiglass and remove their French \ndoors, replacing them with steel ones. G.G.’s family regularly patches drywall and \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1220   Filed 02/13/22   Page 35 of 66\n \nreplaces furniture on account of G.G. throwing things. \n  130. Throughout the week, G.G. resides in a residential treatment facility, \nLighthouse Rehabilitation Center (“Lighthouse”), which is about 45 minutes from \nhis home. His residency is paid for by the public-school system that he attended \nbefore  Lighthouse.  He  began  going  to  Lighthouse  in  2011  or  2012,  and  the \nplacement was initially covered by his community mental health provider. \n  131. In 2016, G.G.’s family received written notice that CMH would no \nlonger fund services at Lighthouse over the summer break or on weekends because \nof issues with funding (not because of his condition having improved) resulting \nfrom alleged federal budget cuts. In the summer of 2017, G.G. came back home \nand the CMH authorized only CLS. The CMH did not authorize intensive care \ncoordination,  mobile  crisis  stabilization,  and  home  and  community  based \nbehavioral health services and supports. Even when the CMH authorized services, \nthe CMH staff or contracted providers did not show up or provide the CLS services \nin the amount authorized in his IPOS. The CLS agency that the CMH contracted \nwith suddenly stopped providing services altogether during the summer of 2017, \nleaving G.G. without services. No other provider was sent, and CLS services were \nnot  provided  for  the  remainder  of  the  summer  without  written  notice  issued \ncommunicating the adverse benefit determination due to failure to provide timely \nservices. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1221   Filed 02/13/22   Page 36 of 66\n \n  132.  By  fall  2017,  G.G.  was  back  at  Lighthouse  during  the  week  and \nreturning home on the weekends. CMH could not find a CLS provider willing to \nserve G.G. on the weekends, even though G.G. required 24/7 care and supervision. \n  133. CMH refused to provide intensive home and community-based services \nduring the weekend.  CMH instead  offered  to place  G.G. in  Hawthorn,  a state \npsychiatric hospital (despite there being a three-month waiting list at the time). \nG.G.’s parents refused to place G.G. at Hawthorn at this time due to their previous \nexperience with G.G being hospitalized at Hawthorn and witnessing him being \novermedicated there. \n  134. According to a behavior assessment dated January 18, 2018, G.G. had \nsignificant behavioral conditions both at Lighthouse and at home. These resulted in \n“severe  temper  tantrums,  physical  aggression  (hitting,  kicking,  spitting,  some \nbiting,  and  throwing  things  at  people),  property  destruction  (throwing  things, \nbreaking  things,  knocking  things  over,  tearing  things  down),  and  SIB  [self \ninjurious behavior] (biting himself and history of banging his head against hard \nsurfaces).” These behaviors were a direct result of his mental illness and the lack of \nintensive home and community-based services provided. \n  135. For over nine months after the fall of 2017, CMH failed or refused to \nprovide  G.G.  with  intensive  home  and  community-based  services,  including \nmobile  crisis  services,  intensive  care  coordination,  and  intensive  home  and \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1222   Filed 02/13/22   Page 37 of 66\n \ncommunity behavioral health services and supports. As a result, G.G.’s parents had \nto pay out of pocket to send him to Lighthouse during times of crisis. Instead of \nproviding services, a CMH representative has advised the parents to work out a \npayment plan with the facility.  \n  136. The CMH does not provide or offer intensive mobile crisis services in \nthe  county,  nor  will  it  offer  or  provide  therapeutic  foster  care  or  home  and \ncommunity based behavioral health services (including CLS) on a consistent basis \nto G.G. \n  137. G.G. has not received written notices of the denials, suspensions, or \nfailure to timely provide his Medicaid services, nor has he been advised of his right \nto  request  a  hearing  or  appeal  the  denials  of  requests  for  Medicaid  covered \nintensive home and community-based services. \n  138. Without the necessary mental health services G.G. needs, his condition \nwill not improve. Without the necessary intensive home and community based \nmental  health  services,  his  behaviors  and  mental  health  condition  continue  to \ndeteriorate, resulting in him being a safety risk to himself, the community, and his \nfamily. \nG.P. (Iron County) \n  139. G.P. is a 15-year-old Medicaid beneficiary diagnosed with ADHD and \nIntermittent Explosive Disorder, and tentatively diagnosed with unspecified bipolar \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1223   Filed 02/13/22   Page 38 of 66\n \nand a related disorder. She also has developmental disabilities, including Autism \nSpectrum Disorder and an Intellectual Development Disability. \n  140. G.P. is not receiving the intensive home and community-based mental \nhealth services she needs to correct or ameliorate her mental health conditions and \naddress her behavioral symptoms. \n  141.  G.P.  began  receiving  mental  and  behavioral  health  services  from \nNorthpoint Community Mental Health since 2009. \n  142. G.P. has been in and out of the emergency department since she was 6 \nyears old. G.P. would go to the emergency department one to two times per month \non average, and police were called by her parents three to four times per month to \nassist  with  mental  health  crises.  G.P.  has  be  unable  to  obtain  psychiatric \nhospitalization, because the private hospitals she visited refused to admit her and a \nrepresentative from her community mental health denied her placement due to lack \nof beds and wanting her in the least restrictive setting. \n  143. G.P does not receive necessary intensive home and community-based \nmental health services. \n  144. G.P has been authorized for CLS, respite, medication management, and \nsupports coordination as part of her care plan. The CLS and respite have been only \nsporadically provided due to lack of staff, and G.P.’s mother was required to obtain \na provider on her own. Frequent staff turnovers contributed to the exacerbation of \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1224   Filed 02/13/22   Page 39 of 66\n \nG.P.’s  mental  and  behavioral  health  symptoms.  Despite  Defendants’  failure  to \nprovide  these  Medicaid  services,  G.P.’s  mother  did  not  receive  written  notice \ncommunicating  any  suspension  or  adverse  benefit  determination,  nor  was  she \nadvised of her right to a Medicaid Fair Hearing to challenge the failure to provide \nthese services. \n  145.  G.P.’s  mother  has  repeatedly  asked  for  more  intensive  home-based \nservices, home modifications, and CLS, but has been repeatedly denied, despite the \ninsurmountable evidence of need. G.P.’s mother began emailing these requests in \n2017, and only then finally received denials in writing communicating her appeal \nrights.  Prior  to  putting  these  requests  in  writing,  G.P.’s  mother  would  request \nincreased services orally and would be denied without written notification. \n  146. As a result of the failure to provide intensive home and community-\nbased  services,  G.P.  has  exhibited  escalating  behaviors,  including  putting  her \nwhole body through a glass window and chicken wire fencing; punching holes in \nwalls; and throwing a metal coffee mug at her mother’s head, which required her \nmother to be hospitalized. \n  147. CMH representatives have advised G.P.’s mother that service provision \nto G.P. is based on staffing availability, and the CMH has told G.P.’s mother to be \npatient  and  to  utilize  what  can  be  offered  to  her.  Although  G.P.  consistently \nreceived medication management and supports coordination, she regularly went \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1225   Filed 02/13/22   Page 40 of 66\n \nwithout  CLS  and  respite,  despite  those  services  being  identified  as  medically \nnecessary in her IPOS. \n  148. Throughout the period that G.P. has sought services in the community \nthat were not provided, G.P. has exhibited unmanageable behavior at home and \nwith the staff that she did have (for ABA services), including striking staff and \nbreaking and throwing objects. G.P. also has pulled her own hair and engaged in \nother self-injurious behavior while without intensive home and community-based \nservices. \n  149. G.P.’s mother has been advised by ABA staff to abandon G.P. and give \nup custody of her to place her in the foster care system, so that G.P. can allegedly \nget the services she needs and to keep her younger sibling safe. \n  150. As a result of the Defendants’ failure to provide intensive home and \ncommunity-based  services  to  address  her  mental  health  conditions  and \ndevelopmental  disabilities,  G.P.  continues  to  be  a  safety  risk  to  herself,  the \ncommunity, and her family. \n  151. G.P currently resides out of state at the Great Lakes Autism Center. She \nhas  been  placed  out  of  state  since  2019.  The  Great  Lakes  Autism  Center  is \ndiscussing discharge in 2022 with the family. Her mother is gravely concerned \nabout bringing her back home without the intensive home and community-based \nservice array she needs. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1226   Filed 02/13/22   Page 41 of 66\n \nM.M.

M.M.  has  a  long  history  of \npsychiatric hospitalization, placement outside the home in residential treatment \nfacilities, and frequent trips to hospital emergency departments for mental health \ntreatment. \n  153. M.M. has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. He \nreceived those diagnoses while hospitalized at the Hawthorne Center at the age of \n10. \n  154.  M.M.  has  been  receiving  services  from  Network  180  Community \nMental Health since he was 7 years old. M.M. began receiving individual therapy, \nwraparound supports, medication management, and supports coordination. \n  155.  Wraparound supports consisted of a weekly meeting with some of \nM.M.’s treatment team. M.M.’s wraparound meetings involved M.M.’s mother, \nM.M., his therapist. and the wraparound coordinator, but M.M.’s psychiatrist and \nschool did not participate in the wrap around meetings. \n  156.  M.M.  also  had  respite  services  approved  in  his  care  plan,  but  that \nservice was terminated when he was 10 or 11 years old because of his behavioral \nissues. The termination of this service was communicated during a wraparound \nmeeting and no written notice was provided explaining his appeal rights. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1227   Filed 02/13/22   Page 42 of 66\n \n  157. M.M. has been denied mobile crisis services by his CMH. M.M. is \ntherefore required to call Family Outreach, the agency that provides his individual \ntherapy, to obtain crisis services. When M.M. experiences a crisis, his family calls \nFamily Outreach and is instructed to call the police and have him taken to the \nemergency room. \n  158. M.M. has been to the emergency department and his mother has had the \npolice called on him over one hundred times since the age of 5  during mental \nhealth crises. \n  159. M.M. is currently residing in a residential treatment program out of the \nhome at Wedgewood Christin Services, where he was placed by the Child welfare \nagency. M.M. has resided in Wedgewood since October 2020. M.M. has begun \nleaving the facility during the day to spend time with his family since August or \nSeptember of 2021, and he receives no CMH services during these visits. \n  160. M.M. has exhibited violent behaviors toward police, hospital staff, and \nfamily members since the age of 5. His violence has resulted in Child Protective \nServices (CPS) being called to the family home by Network 180.   \n  161.  CPS has opened several investigations since M.M. was 4 years old due \nto concerns for the safety of the other children in the home. A CPS worker advised \nM.M.’s mom about additional CMH services, such as CLS, and told the parent she \nwould  help  her  obtain  those  services  through  the  CMH.  However,  instead  of \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1228   Filed 02/13/22   Page 43 of 66\n \nassisting the family with obtaining increased support, a neglect charge was filed \nagainst M.M.’s mother. M.M.’s mother continues to be court involved due to on-\ngoing neglect charges. \n  162. M.M.’s most recent neglect charge resulted in him being placed in the \nMichigan foster care system in July 2021. M.M. was initially placed in Wellsprings \nfoster care home in Kent County. He was moved to a group home in the Detroit \narea in August 2021. He was subsequently moved to his current placement at \nWedgewood in October 2021. \n  163. M.M.’s mother has been told by CPS workers that they do not believe \nthat she is a neglectful parent, but that M.M. must be in Michigan’s foster care \nsystem in order to be placed at Wedgewood. \n  164. Since entering the foster care system, M.M.’s mother has participated in \nthe  reunification  process  and  has  not  had  her  parental  rights  terminated.

L.G.  has  a  long  history  of \nplacement outside the home in residential treatment facilities, frequent trips to the \nemergency room for mental health treatment, and has had criminal charges filed \nagainst her due to behavioral issues. \n  168.  L.G. has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, Reactive \nAttachment Disorder, and a mood disorder. \n  169. L.G. was adopted by her family and sought mental health services with \nAu Sable Valley CMH in 2016. L.G.’s mother was advised to pursue CMH service \nby a representative from the adoption subsidy office in Lansing, Michigan after \nseeking residential placement through her adoption subsidy. L.G.’s mother was \nadvised that she must exhaust all available services in her local area before having \nresidential placement approved by the adoption subsidy. L.G.’s mother contacted \nAu Sable CMH, did an intake, and a CMH representative performed an evaluation \non L.G. A month from the initial intake, L.G. began receiving monthly individual \ntherapy. L.G. received medication management and additional therapy through her \nprivate insurance before and during her time as a CMH consumer. \n  170. After receiving some mental health services through the CMH, L.G.’s \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1230   Filed 02/13/22   Page 45 of 66\n \nmother again pursued residential placement through her adoption subsidy and was \ntold she had not exhausted all of the home and community-based services offered \nthrough her CMH. \n  171. L.G. mother then requested all available services through her CMH and \nwas  authorized  for  wraparound,  CLS,  respite,  and  the  previously  authorized \nindividual therapy. \n  172. However, since being determined eligible for respite, CLS, individual \ntherapy,  and  wraparound  mental  health  services  by  the  CMH,  she  has  only \nsporadically been provided any of these services, and only then on an inconsistent \nbasis. These services were also not intensive and did not meet L.G.’s needs. Since \n2017, L.G. has had at least 13 different CLS/Respite workers and three different \nwraparound coordinators. \n  173. L.G.’s mother has filed three Office of Recipient Rights complaints \nrelated to the failure to provide services and the low quality of the services she has \nreceived,  all  of  which  have  been  substantiated  in  her  favor.  Substantiated \ncomplaints related to the failure to provide authorized Medicaid services. \n  174. In L.G.’s county,  there are no  mobile crisis services available, and \nL.G.’s  family  has  been  forced  to  call  the  police  or  take  L.G.  to  the  hospital \nemergency department when she experiences a mental health crisis. \n  175. In August, 2019 L.G. was placed in a residential treatment facility in \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1231   Filed 02/13/22   Page 46 of 66\n \nCalifornia,  which  was  covered  by  the  family’s  private  insurance  carrier.  This \nplacement was required after the Medicaid home and community-based services \nprovided failed to correct or ameliorate L.G.’s mental illness. After 28 days in the \nfacility,  she was  expelled due to  behavior. L.G.’s private  insurance would  not \ncover  intensive  home  and  community-based  services  or  additional  in-home \nsupports  beyond  the  individual  therapy  and  medication  management  she  was \nreceiving.  L.G.  mother  paid  over  $4,000  for  airfare  and  accommodations  to \nfacilitate the California placement, which required her to refinance her home to \ncover those costs. Once L.G. returned to Michigan, she was denied residential \nplacement by both her CMH and the adoption subsidy. \n  176. Due to L.G.’s frequent need for hospitalization, police intervention, and \nthe family’s inability to obtain appropriate intensive home and community-based \nservices,  her  mother  was  advised  by  a  CMH  employee  to  file  incorrigibility \ncharges  against her daughter,  as that was  the only  way she would  qualify  for \nresidential treatment. L.G.’s mother followed that advice and filed criminal charges \nagainst her daughter in the spring of 2020. \n  177.  In  October  2021,  L.G.  was  placed  in  Wedgewood,  a  residential \ntreatment facility in Michigan, for six months. This move was coordinated by her \nprobation  officer  and  the  adoption  subsidy,  and  was  financed  by  her  adoption \nsubsidy. \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1232   Filed 02/13/22   Page 47 of 66\n \n  178. In April 2021, after discharge from Wedgewood, L.G. was sent to a \nBlodgett residential treatment facility in Michigan, which is a facility for long-term \npsychiatric inpatient stays, until July of 2021. This placement was also covered by \nher adoption subsidy as a step-down program due to a 6-month cap on residential \nplacement under the subsidy. \n  179. After being discharged from Blodget, L.G. returned home, where the \nhome and community-based services provided have continued to be insufficient. \nL.G. has continued to deteriorate since returning home, leading her mother to again \nseek residential placement. Residential placement was subsequently ordered by the \njudge assigned to her criminal matter, and L.G. is currently awaiting residential \nplacement once an opening becomes available. \nS.W.

As  a  young  child,  S.W.  did  not  wish  to  be  held,  was \ncontinuously  agitated,  appeared  nervous  throughout  the  day,  would  scream \nthroughout the day, and was inconsolable during bouts of rage. \n  182. S.W. received his first neuropsychological evaluation at the age of 5 \nand received multiple mental health diagnoses. S.W. was diagnosed with ADHD, \nODD, RAD, and mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. \n  183. At the age of nine, S.W. began receiving mental health services from \nOCHN. S.W. was authorized for individual therapy, respite, CLS and wraparound, \nbut experienced frequent staffing changes with his treatment team and did not \nreceive appropriate intensive home and community-based services: \na.  While  a  CMH  consumer,  S.W.  received  therapy  from  4  different \ntherapists.  \nb.  Despite having respite included in his plan of service, K.M. did not \nreceive  that  service.  After  the  services  were  authorized  and \ndetermined  medically  necessary,  S.W.’s  CMH  case  manager  and \nwraparound coordinator advised that there were no CLS or respite \nproviders, and that the family must find their own providers. S.W.’s \nmother never received written notice communicating the reason for \nfailing to provide services in the IPOS.  \nc.  After a year of being a CMH consumer, S.W. was provided CLS for \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1234   Filed 02/13/22   Page 49 of 66\n \nthe  first  time,  but  these  services  were  provided  sporadically  and \ninconsistently for the rest of his time as a OCHN consumer. When the \nCMH found staff to provide CLS, the staff would leave shortly after \nstarting, and no written notice was provided when the CMH failed to \nlocate another provider.  \nd.  S.W. has never received the respite benefit contained in his plan. \n  184. At the age of twelve, S.W.’s Medicaid services were terminated. His \nfamily  disagreed  that  they  should  end  and  fought  this  termination;  they \nsuccessfully  reinstated  his  services  by  enlisting  the  help  of  a  supervisor  at \nMDHHS. His mother did not receive written notice communicating the termination \nand the reasons why he was being terminated. The termination resulted in S.W. \nlosing the therapist he’d been working with for the last year, requiring S.W. to find \na new therapist. \n  185. Once OCHN developed a mobile crisis hotline, S.W. was determined to \nneed crisis services, but the services only consisted of a phone number S.W.’s \nfamily could call to speak with a crisis worker when S.W. was in crisis. S.W. never \nreceived mobile crisis (intervention) services, and the family was repeatedly told to \nsimply call the police or take S.W. to the hospital emergency department during a \nmental health crisis. \n  186. The police have become very familiar with S.W., having been called to \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1235   Filed 02/13/22   Page 50 of 66\n \nthe family’s home since he was five. Police were called when S.W. eloped, was \nsuicidal, or was threatening or engaging in violence against his family. \n  187. At the age of 12, S.W.’s parents pressed charges against him at the \nrequest of the responding police officers. He was placed in diversion after a judge \ndetermined that he had a disability and that his needs were not being met. \n  188. S.W. was eventually charged with incorrigibility in 2020. \n  189. S.W. was placed in Harbor Oaks, a residential care facility, by his \nfamily in February 2021, but was discharged after eleven days. This placement was \npaid for by his private insurance and was required due to the lack of intensive \nhome and community-based services in the home. \n  190. S.W. was taken to the emergency room at Beaumont Hospital after \nanother  suicide  attempt  on  February  19th,  days  after  he  was  discharged  from \nHarbor Oaks. \n  191. S.W. was then placed by the family in a residential facility in Georgia, \nwhere he stayed for 13 weeks after the second suicide attempt. Despite the Georgia \nfacility recommending therapeutic foster care or group home placement before \nreturning to his family home, S.W. was discharged back to his parents with the \nsame minimal mental health services  and supports. S.W.’s family was told by \nCMH representatives responsible for providing services to S.W. that therapeutic \nfoster care and group home placement are only available to children in foster care \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1236   Filed 02/13/22   Page 51 of 66\n \nin Michigan. An individual working for the local Court advised the family that, if \nthey released their parental rights, it would create additional placement options for \nS.W. S.W.’s parents refused to release their rights. \n  192. The CMH provided no intensive home and community-based services \nto S.W and, within days of being home, S.W. experienced another crisis and was \nplaced in Family Youth Intervention, a residential treatment facility, for 6 days. \n  193. S.W.’s parents were asked to come pick him up from Family Youth \nIntervention because he was actively suicidal with a plan. His parents took him to \nBeaumont  Hospital  in  Troy,  Michigan,  where  he  awaited  placement  in  a \npsychiatric hospital.  \n  194.  The  family  then  contacted  their  State  Legislator,  and  S.W.  was \napproved by MDHHS for admission to the state hospital, Hawthorn, in June 2021. \nHe would stay in Hawthorn until September 15, 2021. \n  195. After being told that S.W. would be discharged from Hawthorn, the \nfamily located a facility in Indiana that agreed to take S.W. S.W.’s parents elected \nto  send  him  there  because  they  were  desperate,  and  because  S.W.  was  not \nreceiving  the  intensive  home  and  community-based  mental  health  services  he \nneeded in their home or in the community. The family has been required to pay out \nof  their  own  pocket  for  this  residential  placement,  and  was  told  by  a  OCHN \nrepresentative  that  the  CMH  would  close  S.W.’s  case  due  to  his  out  of  state \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1237   Filed 02/13/22   Page 52 of 66\n \nplacement. \n  196.  SW  had his  Medicaid terminated due  to out  of state  placement  on \nJanuary 21, 2022.  \n  197. With the assistance of his legal counsel in this matter, he was found \neligible for Medicaid services and has reapplied for home and community-based \nservices with OCHN. Since returning to Michigan, he has resided in an apartment, \nwith his parents splitting time to ensure his safety and the safety of those around \nhim. \n  K.M. (Kent County) \n  198.  K.M  is  a  13-year-old  Medicaid  Beneficiary  from  Kent  County, \nMichigan with significant mental health needs. K.M. has a history of placement in \nresidential  treatment  facilities  and  has  been  taken  to  hospital  emergency \ndepartments due to experiencing mental health crises. He has had criminal charges \nbrought against him due to his behavior resulting from his mental illness. \n  199. K.M. was adopted by his family from Ethiopia when he was 14 months \nold. He is the middle child in his family and has a younger and older brother who \nare the biological children of his mother and father. \n  200. Before being brought to America, K.M. lost his birth mother and had \nbeen moved to multiple placements within his home county. \n  201. K.M. was brought to Michigan from Ethiopia at 14 months and quickly \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1238   Filed 02/13/22   Page 53 of 66\n \nbegan exhibiting signs of mental illness. \n  202. K.M. was not able to be comforted when upset; cried and screamed \nconstantly; and engaged in long, uncontrollable tantrums. \n  203. K.M.’s parents tried to enroll him in Tri-Unity Christian School at the \nage of three. He began school on a limited schedule, 2 and a half hours per day for \ntwo days a week, but was expelled from school after two weeks for behaviors. \n  204. K.M. began receiving individual therapy at the age of 3. \n  205. Since birth, K.M. had issues with his sleep. He became unable to sleep \nfor long periods of time, only taking short naps, and became active throughout the \nnight. Around the age of 3, his parent sought medical treatment for his sleep issues \nfrom an ear, nose, and throat doctor. \n  206. After treatment from the ear, nose, and throat doctor proved ineffective, \nat age 5 K.M. began seeing a psychiatrist for his sleep and rage issues. \n  207. K.M. received a diagnosis of ADHD and began taking medications for \nsleep and ADHD as prescribed by his treating psychiatrist. \n  208. K.M. began receiving services from Network 180 CMH at age 6. He \nreceived individual therapy in the home. The services were provided consistently \nbut were not sufficiently intensive to meet his needs. As a result, the symptoms and \nbehaviors exhibited due to K.M.’s mental illness continued to worsen. \n  209.  At  the  age  of  7,  K.M.  was  authorized  for  services  under  the  SED \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1239   Filed 02/13/22   Page 54 of 66\n \nwaiver, including wraparound, CLS, music therapy, and equine therapy. While he \nreceived  the  therapies  authorized  in  the  plan  with  minimal  issues  during  the \nCOVID  pandemic,  his  authorized  CLS  services  were  sporadically  and \ninconsistently provided due to the CMH’s failure to provide CLS workers in the \nhome.  The  CLS  authorization  was  limited  to  3  hours  a  week.  K.M.’s  family \nreceived no written notice regarding the failure to provide the CLS benefit, nor \nwere they advised that they could file a Medicaid Fair Hearing related to the failure \nto provide services in the IPOS. \n  210. During the time K.M. was receiving CLS, he had at least 6 different \nCLS workers. Most quit their jobs before working 6 months with him, but he was \nable to keep working with one staff member for almost a year in 2018. \n  211.  K.M.  was  taken  to  the  DeVos  Children’s  hospital  emergency \ndepartment  after  a  mental  health  crisis  for  the  first  time  at  the  age  of  8.  At \ndischarge K.M.’s parents were told  by hospital  staff  that they were  concerned \nabout  the  safety  of  the  other  children  living  in  K.M.’s  home.  Despite  these \nconcerns, the hospital threatened to call CPS if his family did not come pick up \nK.M.  immediately.  No  intensive  home  and  community  based  mental  health \nservices were offered or provided by the CMH in addition to the current content of \nhis plan of service after discharge. To avoid a CPS case, K.M.’s parents moved his \nsiblings out of the home for months to ensure their safety after discharge. \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1240   Filed 02/13/22   Page 55 of 66\n \n  212. At the age of 11, K.M. was terminated from the SED waiver and told \nthat the termination was because he had been on the waiver too long. The impact \nof his removal from the SED wavier caused him to lose his respite benefit and \nwraparound benefit, and K.M.’s parents were told that he could no longer receive \nthe authorized CLS services due to lack of available staffing. K.M.’s parents have \nno recollection of receiving written notice communicating the termination of his \nrespite or CLS benefit and believe this was communicated to them verbally by \ntheir therapist at the time. \n  213. After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, K.M.’s behaviors continued \nto escalate and remote services proved to be ineffective for him. \n  214. K.M.’s family repeatedly asked for CLS services and additional home \nand  community-based  mental  health  services,  but  those  requests  were  denied \nwithout written notice. \n  215. In 2021 K.M. was advised he would qualify for mobile crisis services, \nbut when K.M.’s family called the crisis line, they were referred to Arbor Circle, \nthe  CMH  contracted  service  provider  through  which  he  receives  therapy,  and \nadvised to obtain crisis services through that entity. \n  216. When K.M.’s mother contacted Arbor Circle for the first time in 2021, \nduring a crisis where K.M. was exhibiting homicidal ideation, rage, and destroying \nproperty, the provider did not respond to provide the crisis evaluation until 3 days \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1241   Filed 02/13/22   Page 56 of 66\n \nlater. While the family waited for the evaluation to be completed, the police were \ncontacted  to  assist  the  family  during  the  ongoing  crisis.  The  evaluation  was \neventually completed over Zoom, and the provider then advised K.M.’s mother \nthat  the  CMH  must  approve  hospitalization.  K.M.  was  taken  to  Helen  Devos \nChildren’s hospital after the evaluation and remained there overnight. K.M. was \nsubsequently transferred to Pine Rest, an in-patient treatment facility, for a 12 day \nin-patient stay. \n  217. Within two hours of returning home from Pine Rest, K.M. was in a rage \nand his parents contacted the CMH for an emergency medication review. \n  218. Despite K.M. hallucinating, a symptom that was not common for him, \nhis medications were not reviewed until 48 hours after discharge from Pine Rest. \n  219. The crisis that resulted in the in-patient stay at Pine Rest also resulted in \ncriminal charges being filed by the responding police officers  against K.M for \ndomestic violence and malicious destruction of property. A family friend advised \nthat criminal charges would give K.M. access to residential placement options that \nthe CMH would not cover. \n  220. K.M. experienced another mental health crisis in January 2022. K.M.’s \nmother contacted Arbor Circle’s crisis line and was advised to reach out to his \ntherapist for assistance. When K.M.’s therapist did not respond to the contact, his \nmother called the police for assistance. The police called for an ambulance. K.M. \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1242   Filed 02/13/22   Page 57 of 66\n \nwas taken to Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital and was subsequently transferred to \nPine Rest a second time for a 7 day in-patient stay. \n  221.  As  of  the  filing  of  this  Complaint,  K.M.  only  receives  individual \ntherapy from the CMH. The CMH has never provided the intensive home and \ncommunity-based services K.M. needs to remain in his family home, including, but \nnot  limited  to,  CLS,  Wraparound,  Intensive  Care  Coordination,  and  effective \nMobile Crisis services. \nVI.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I - Violation of the Federal Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, \nDiagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) Mandate (Defendant Hertel) \n \n  222. The Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and \nevery allegation and paragraph set forth previously. \n  223. In violation of the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act, 42 U.S.C. \n§§  1396a(a)(10)(A),  1396d(a)(4)(B),  1396d(r)(5),  and  1396a(a)(43)(C),  the \nDefendants,  while  acting  under  the  color  of  law,  have  failed  to  provide  the \nPlaintiffs and Class Members with intensive home and community-based mental \nhealth services necessary to correct or ameliorate their conditions. \n  224.  In  violation  of  the  EPSDT  provisions  of  the  Medicaid  Act,  the \nDefendants,  while  acting  under  the  color  of  law,  have  failed  to  “arrange  for \n(directly or through referral to appropriate agencies, organizations, or individuals) \ncorrective  treatment  [intensive  home  and  community-based  mental  health \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1243   Filed 02/13/22   Page 58 of 66\n \nservices]”  to  the  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  § \n1396a(a)(43)(C). \n  225. The Defendants have repeatedly and knowingly violated Plaintiffs’ and \nthe Class Members’ rights under the EPSDT Mandate, rights enforceable pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  \nCount II - Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq. (Defendant Hertel) \n \n  226. The Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and \nevery allegation and paragraph set forth previously. \n  227. Title II of the ADA provides that no qualified person with a disability \nshall be subjected to discrimination by a public entity. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-32. It \nrequires public entities to administer services, programs, and activities in the most \nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities. \nSee 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). \n  228. The Plaintiffs and Class  Members are “qualified individuals with a \ndisability” within the meaning of the ADA in that they have physical and/or mental \nimpairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities, including \ntheir ability to live independently without support. \n  229.  The  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  are  entitled  by  law  to  receive \nMedicaid  specialty  mental  health  services,  including  by  requiring  services \nnecessary to remain in their homes in the community. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1244   Filed 02/13/22   Page 59 of 66\n \n  230.  The  Defendants,  who  are  responsible  for  administering  Michigan’s \nMedicaid program in accordance with state and federal law, are subject to Title II \nof the ADA. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(1)(A) and (B) (1990). \n  231. The Defendants are obligated under the ADA to administer MDHHS’ \nprograms in a manner that enables qualified individuals with disabilities to live in \nthe most integrated setting appropriate to their needs. The Defendants’ failure to \narrange for (directly or through referral to appropriate agencies, organizations, or \nindividuals)  corrective  treatment  (intensive  home  and  community-based  mental \nhealth services) for qualified individuals with disabilities such as the Plaintiffs and \nClass Members has placed the Plaintiffs and the Class Members at serious risk of \ninstitutionalization, in violation of the ADA’s integration mandate. \n  232. The Defendants have discriminated against qualified individuals with \ndisabilities  such  as  the  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  by  failing  to  provide \nreasonable modifications to programs and services in order to arrange for intensive \nhome and community-based medically necessary mental health services. \n  233. The Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration \nthat subject the Plaintiffs, Class Members, and other qualified individuals with \ndisabilities  to  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  disability,  including  risk  of \nunnecessary institutionalization, in ways that include failing to take the necessary \nsteps to arrange for medically necessary intensive home and community-based \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1245   Filed 02/13/22   Page 60 of 66\n \nmental health services. \n  234. The Defendants’ actions are in violation of Title II of the ADA. The \nPlaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, and \nreasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing this action, pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 12133.  \nCount III - Violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 \net seq. (both Defendants) \n \n  235. The Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and \nevery allegation and paragraph set forth previously. \n  236. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, prohibits public \nentities and recipients of federal funds from discriminating against any individual \nby reason of disability. Public and federally-funded entities must provide programs \nand  activities  “in  the  most  integrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  the \nqualified individual with a disability.” See 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). \n  237.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, together with \nits  implementing  regulations,  including  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51(d)  and  45  C.F.R.  § \n84.4(b)(vii)(2),  and  the  right  of  action  granted  by  29  U.S.C.  §  794a,  are  all \nconstrued in pari materia with the ADA with respect to Olmstead/“most integrated \nsetting” claims. \n  238. Policies, practices, and procedures that have the effects of unjustifiably \nsegregating  persons  with  disabilities  in  institutions  constitute  prohibited \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1246   Filed 02/13/22   Page 61 of 66\n \ndiscrimination under Section 504. The Plaintiffs and Class Members are “qualified \nindividuals with a disability” under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \nin that they have physical and/or mental impairments that substantially limit one or \nmore  major  life  activities, including their  ability  to live  independently without \nsupport. \n  239. The Plaintiffs and Class Members meet the eligibility requirements for \nMichigan Medicaid services, including services necessary to maintain them in their \nhomes in the community. \n  240. Defendant MDHHS is a recipient of federal funds and is therefore a \ngovernment entity subject to Section 504. 29 U.S.C. § 794(b). Defendants’ failure \nto arrange for (directly or through referral to appropriate agencies, organizations, \nor individuals) corrective treatment (intensive home and community-based mental \nhealth  services)  to  the  Plaintiffs  and  Class  Members  places  them  at  risk  of \ninstitutionalization in violation of Section 504’s integration mandate. \n  241. The Defendants have utilized criteria and methods of administration \nthat subject qualified individuals with disabilities such as the Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers to discrimination on the basis of disability, including risk of unnecessary \ninstitutionalization, by the Defendants’ failure to arrange for (directly or through \nreferral to appropriate agencies, organizations, or individuals) corrective treatment \n(intensive home and community-based mental health services) to the Plaintiffs and \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1247   Filed 02/13/22   Page 62 of 66\n \nClass Members. \n  242. By continuing to participate in the Medicaid program, and continuing to \naccept federal funding therefor, after enactment of 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7, the State \nof Michigan has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity for claims under the \nRehabilitation Act related to its conduct of the Medicaid program. \n  243.  Plaintiffs  have  a  right  to  relief  under  29  U.S.C.  §  794a  against \nDefendants Hertel and MDHHS for violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct to the same extent that they have a right to relief against Defendant Hertel as \nalleged in Count II. \nCount IV - Violation of the Due Process Provisions of the Federal Medicaid \nAct. (Defendant Hertel) \n \n  244. The Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and \nevery allegation and paragraph set forth previously. \n  245.  The  Medicaid  Act  requires  that  participating  states  provide  an \nopportunity  for  a  fair  hearing  for  any  individual  whose  requests  for  Medicaid \nservices have been denied or not provided with reasonable promptness.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(3). \n  246. The Defendants have failed to establish and maintain customs, policies, \nand  practices  to  provide  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  Plaintiff  Class  with \nadequate  written  notice  of  reductions,  terminations,  and  denials  of  Medicaid \nfunded  intensive  home  and  community-based  mental  health  services  and  their \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 71, PageID.1248   Filed 02/13/22   Page 63 of 66\n \nrights to a  denial, pre-termination or reduction fair hearing, in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n  247.

(Defendant Hertel) \n \n  248. The Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and \nevery allegation and paragraph set forth previously. \n  249. The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution established \nthe right for the Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff Class to receive notice of \nreductions, terminations, and denials of Medicaid funded services and their right to \na fair hearing to challenge such actions prior to implementation.  See Goldberg v. \nKelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970); 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n  250. The Defendants have failed to establish and maintain customs, policies, \nand practices to provide  the Plaintiffs and members of the Plaintiff class with \nadequate  written  notice  of  reductions,  terminations,  and  denials  of  Medicaid \nfunded  intensive  home  and  community-based  mental  health  services  and  their \nrights to a pre-termination or reduction fair hearing, in violation of the Due Process \nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. \n  251.

Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure 23(a) and (b)(2), Plaintiffs now seek certification of this class:  \nAll Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries under the age of 21 in the State of \nMichigan for whom a licensed practitioner of the healing arts acting \nwithin the scope of practice under state law has determined, through an \nassessment,  that  intensive  home  and  community-based  services  are \nneeded to correct or ameliorate their emotional, behavioral, or psychiatric \ncondition. See First Amended Class Action Complaint, para. 20, pp.  7-8.  \n \nHere, tens of thousands of children, young adults, and their families, limited \nnot only by the modesty of their financial resources but also by the emotional, phys-\nical, and financial burdens of their disabilities, respectfully seek certification as a \nclass. Without such permission, the vast majority of these families will continue to \nbe denied any meaningful opportunity to seek vindication of their children’s right, \nguaranteed by federal law, to receive medically necessary services and supports to \ntreat their conditions. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1469   Filed 04/11/22   Page 13 of 35\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI.  The Federal Medicaid Program \n \nThe Medicaid program was “designed to provide medical assistance to per-\nsons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary care \nand services.” Atkins v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 154, 156 (1986). State participation in the \nMedicaid program is not compulsory, but, once a state agrees to participate, it must \ncomply with the requirements imposed by the Social Security Act (the “Medicaid \nAct” or the “Act”). See, e.g., Nat’l Fed’n of Ind. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 541-\n542 (2012); Brown v. Tenn. Dept. of Finance & Admin., 561 F.3d 542, 544 (6th Cir. \n2009).  \nThe Medicaid Act imposes upon participating states the obligation to either \nprovide or arrange for the provision of medically necessary Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (“EPSDT”) services to all Medicaid benefi-\nciaries under age 21. See 42 U.S.C. §§  1396a(a)(43); 1396d(r); and 1369d(a)(4)(B). \nEPSDT services include “such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treat-\nment, and other measures described in [42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)] to correct or amelio-\nrate defects and physical and mental illnesses discovered by the screening services, \nwhether or not such services are covered by the State plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r).  \nEPSDT requires coverage of community-based services, such as community \nliving  supports  (“CLS”),  intensive  crisis  stabilization,  intensive  home-based \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1470   Filed 04/11/22   Page 14 of 35\nservices, intensive care coordination, rehabilitation services, psychosocial/behav-\nioral assessment, trauma services, behavioral health services/therapy, and outpatient \nmental health treatment by psychologists, physicians, and social workers. Michigan \nMedicaid Provider Manual, pp. 339, 361, 382, 447, 468, 596, 672-3, 681, 682, 684, \nand  685  https://www.mdch.state.mi.us/dch-Medicaid/manuals/Medi-\ncaidProviderManual.pdf.  According  to  the  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid \n(“CMS”), the federal agency that administers the Medicaid program, “the goal of \nEPSDT is to assure that individual children get the health care that they need when \nthey need it – the right care to the right child at the right time in the right setting.” \nEPSDT:  A  Guide  for  States,  Centers  for  Medicare,  and  Medicaid  Services, \nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/benefits/downloads/epsdt coverage_guide.pdf, \np. 1 (June 2014).  \nII.  The Medicaid Program in Michigan \n \nThe State of Michigan participates in the Medicaid program and has desig-\nnated the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (“MDHHS”) as the \nstate agency ultimately responsible for administering the Medicaid program under \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(5). MDHHS contracts the provision of Medicaid and other \nservices out to ten Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (“PIHPs”) located throughout \nMichigan.  The  PIHPs  then  contract  with  Community  Mental  Health  Service \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1471   Filed 04/11/22   Page 15 of 35\nProviders (“CMHSPs”) to provide EPSDT and other Medicaid services in desig-\nnated geographic regions.   \nOnce a qualified medical provider has determined that an EPSDT service is \n“medically necessary,” MDHHS is required to ensure that the service is available to \nthe eligible Medicaid beneficiary. K.B. by next friend T.B. v. Mich. Dep’t of Health \n& Human Servs., 367 F. Supp. 3d 647, 658-59 (E.D. Mich. 2019). The Michigan \nMedicaid Provider Manual explains that “[i]t is important to identify illnesses and \nconditions early and to treat any health problems discovered in children before they \nbecome worse and more costly.” Michigan Medical Provider Manual online in PDF \nformat, Version dated January 1, 2022, at https://www.mdch.state.mi.us/dch-medi-\ncaid/manuals/MedicaidProviderManual.pdf, p. 672.  (Emphasis added.)   \nIII.  The Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabili-\ntation Act \n \nTitle II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) prohibits a public \nentity from discriminating against individuals with disabilities or denying those in-\ndividuals the benefits of services, programs, or activities of that entity. 42 U.S.C. § \n12132. The law further requires that a public entity administer services in the most \nintegrated settings appropriate to the needs of people with disabilities. 28 C.F.R. § \n35.130(d). Where persons with disabilities are able to be treated in their communi-\nties, the ADA’s proscription on discrimination requires them to be treated in the \ncommunity, rather than in an institution. Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1472   Filed 04/11/22   Page 16 of 35\n581, 587 (1999). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act similarly prohibits discrimi-\nnation and requires administration of services in the most integrated setting. 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). Moreover, “CMS has long encouraged states \nto provide services in home and community settings, particularly for children, not \nonly because of Olmstead, but because community-based care is considered a best \npractice for supporting children with disabilities and chronic conditions. In addition, \nit is generally more cost-effective.” EPSDT: A Guide for States, at 21-22. \nIV.  Medicaid Beneficiaries Under Age 21 in Michigan \n \nThere are tens of thousands of children under 21 with developmental disabil-\nities, serious emotional disturbances, and mental illness in Michigan who are Medi-\ncaid beneficiaries and, thus, are eligible for medically necessary EPSDT services. \nAccording to data compiled by the State of Michigan, there were more than 60,000 \nchildren (under age 18) with serious emotional disturbances in Michigan in 2019.1 \nAll of these children are eligible for medically necessary EPSDT services and do not \nreceive and/or at risk of not receiving the medically necessary EPSDT services to \nwhich they are entitled.     \n \n1     Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Report on CMHSPs, \nPIHPs  and  Regional  Entities,  Per  Section  904(1)  of  PA  67  of  2019, \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/Section_904-1_715330_7.pdf p. \n85 (Last Visited February 3, 2022). This number does not include the 19 and \n20 year olds who are also entitled to EPSDT. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1473   Filed 04/11/22   Page 17 of 35\n  All the named Plaintiffs are Medicaid beneficiaries under the age of 21, and \nall have been diagnosed with one or more emotional impairments and/or mental ill-\nnesses. Under the Medicaid Act’s EPSDT provisions, the named Plaintiffs and the \nunnamed Class members they represent are all entitled to receive medically neces-\nsary Medicaid services. Virtually all class members are being harmed or are at future \nrisk of harm caused by not receiving the services that treating providers have deter-\nmined are necessary to treat or ameliorate their conditions. As set forth in detail in \nthe First Amended Complaint (Dkt. 71), each of the named Plaintiffs and unnamed \nClass members has experienced barriers to accessing EPSDT services to which they \nare entitled and, if unremedied, will continue to confront such barriers. MDHHS has \nfailed to provide or arrange for the provision of the full spectrum of services each \nnamed Plaintiff is entitled to receive under the EPSDT provisions of the Act, and/or \nto apprise them of their due process rights. All of the Plaintiffs have experienced \nrepeated mental health crises in the community. These crises often result in Emer-\ngency Department visits and/or police interventions. Without appropriate and med-\nically necessary supports and services, these children and their families will continue \nto suffer irreparable emotional, developmental, and financial harm in addition to in-\njury to their autonomy and dignity.   \nFor example, D.D. is an 11-year-old Medicaid beneficiary from Genesee \nCounty, Michigan. He has been diagnosed with a variety of mental health conditions, \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1474   Filed 04/11/22   Page 18 of 35\nincluding bipolar disorder, reactive attachment disorder (“RAD”), attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), and Autism. He has severe behavior problems \nand has injured himself and members of his family. D.D. has been sent to emergency \ndepartments at least thirty times during mental health crises and has been placed in \na residential treatment facility twice since 2019. He has been found eligible for a \nvariety of intensive home and community-based services but has not received them \nin the amount and frequency he needs. As a result, he is suffering harm and at great \nrisk of further harm. See First Amended Complaint, p. 26-33. \nG.P. is a 15-year-old Medicaid beneficiary from Iron County who has been \ndiagnosed with autism, intellectual disabilities, and ADHD. G.P. displays aggres-\nsion, impulsivity,  and self-injurious behaviors. She has been in and out of the emer-\ngency room, broken windows, and seriously injured her mother (resulting in her \nmother’s hospitalization).  She has not received the intensive in home services found \nnecessary to treat her condition and enable her to live safely in the community, and \nher family has been encouraged to consider placing her in foster care so that she can \nget the services she needs. See First Amended Class Action Complaint, p 37-40. \nG.G. is an 18-year-old Medicaid beneficiary from Lapeer County who has \nbeen diagnosed with Down syndrome and bipolar disorders and shows symptoms of \nschizophrenia. G.G. is a loving child, but, as a result of his illnesses, G.G. displays \naggressive behavior and has violent tantrums. Due to his significant behavioral \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1475   Filed 04/11/22   Page 19 of 35\nneeds, G.G. has been approved for intensive home-based services around the clock \nin the home. Despite this, for over eighteen months, he has not received these au-\nthorized supports. As a result of the failure to provide these intensive home and com-\nmunity based services, he is residing in a child caring institution (“CCI”). The \nCMHSP responsible for providing his services has suggested to the family that they \ngive up parental rights for G.G. so that he may receive the services he needs. See \nFirst Amended Complaint, pp. 37-40. \nLike these three children, the remaining Named Plaintiffs and class members \nare children with severe emotional, behavioral, and psychiatric conditions for whom \nintensive community-based services are necessary and/or have been approved, but \nwho have not received them. As a result, they suffer harm, struggle to attend school \nand remain in their homes, and are at risk of institutionalization. See First Amended \nComplaint, pp. 41-57. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Introduction \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that the party moving for class \ncertification satisfy all the requirements of Rule 23(a) and one of the subparts of \nRule 23(b). The discretion to pursue a class action resides in the plaintiff, and a court \nmust “certify a class ‘in each and every case’ where the Rules’ [here, Rule 23(a) and \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1476   Filed 04/11/22   Page 20 of 35\n(b)(2)] criteria are met.” Shady Grove Orthopedic Assoc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 \nU.S. 393, 400 (2010).  \nCourts frequently certify classes in cases involving Medicaid-eligible children \nalleging EPSDT violations like the claims at issue in this matter. See, e.g., S.R. by \nand through Rosenbauer v. Penn. DHS, 309 F. Supp. 3d 250 (M.D. Pa. 2018); Don-\negan v. Norwood, 2017 WL 6569634 (N.D. Ill. 2017); O.B. v. Norwood, 2016 WL \n2866132 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2016); N.B. Hamos, 26 F. Supp. 3d 756 (N.D. Ill. 2014); \nFla. Pediatric Soc./Fla. Chapter of Am. Academy of Pediatrics v. Benson, 2009 WL \n10668660 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2009); Katie A. ex rel. Ludin v. L.A. County, 481 F. \n3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2007); Rosie D. v. Patrick, 497 F. Supp. 2d 76 (D. Mass. 2007); \nRisinger ex rel. Risinger v. Concannon, 201 F.R.D. 16 (D. Me. 2001); Emily Q. v. \nBonta, 208 F. Supp. 2d 1078 (C.D. Cal. 2001); and J.K. ex rel. R.K. v. Dillenberg, \n836 F. Supp. 694 (D. Ariz. 1993). \nII.  Plaintiffs Satisfy Rule 23(a) \nRule 23(a) sets forth four criteria for certifying a class action: (1) numer-\nosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality, and (4) adequacy of representation. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(a). The proposed Class meets all four requirements. \nA. The Class is so Numerous That Joinder is Impracticable \n \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be so numerous that joinder of all class \nmembers is “impracticable.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). Generally, numerosity is \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1477   Filed 04/11/22   Page 21 of 35\nsatisfied where the potential class exceeds 40 members. Curry v. SBC Comms., 250 \nF.R.D. 301, 310 (E.D. Mich. 2008). “There is no strict numerical test, substantial \nnumbers usually satisfy the numerosity requirement.” Hamama v. Adducci, 342 F. \nSupp. 2d 751, 762 (E.D. Mich. 2018) (citing Daffin v. Ford Motor Co., 458 F.3d \n549, 552 (6th Cir. 2006)). The exact number of members of a proposed class need \nnot be known if general knowledge and common sense indicate that the class is large. \nBeattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 234 F.R.D. 160, 168 (E.D. Mich. 2006), aff’d in part and \nrev’d in part, 511 F.3d 554 (6th Cir. 2007). “Other factors to consider include judi-\ncial economy, geographical dispersion of class members, ease of identifying putative \nclass members, and practicality with which individual class members could sue on \ntheir own.” Barry v. Corrigan, 79 F. Supp. 3d 712, 731 (E.D. Mich. 2015) aff’d sub \nnom. Barry v. Lyon, 834 F.3d 706 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Crawley v. Ahmed, 2009 \nWL 1384147, at *10 (E.D. Mich. May 14, 2009)); Carr v. Wilson-Coker, 203 F.R.D. \n66, 72-73 (D. Conn. 2001) (joinder impracticable where, as here, financial and health \nstatus of proposed class complicate ability to obtain information about their rights). \n  Here, the numerosity requirement is easily satisfied. The challenged statute, \nthe Medicaid Act, is generally applicable to a class of recipients that is large and \nspread across the entire state. General knowledge and common sense indicate that \nthe proposed class is very large, which is supported by the statistics published by \nDefendant MDHHS. While the statistics MDHHS issued only reflect a subset of the \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1478   Filed 04/11/22   Page 22 of 35\nClass (those children under age 18), they suggest that the class is larger than 60,000 \nchildren.2 MDHHS Memo 2019, supra n. 1. Moreover, the limited finances of the \nproposed class members and attendant difficulty in obtaining information about their \nrights also contribute to the impracticability of individual suits. See Barry, 79 F. \nSupp. 3d at 731 (numerosity satisfied where putative class consisted of several thou-\nsand people spread across Michigan who faced difficulty bringing suit given low-\nincome status); N.B. v. Hamos, 26 F. Supp. 3d 756, 770 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (joinder \nimpracticable where putative class consisted of children with health issues and lim-\nited financial means who were spread across the entire state).   \nB. Rule 23(a) Requires Only a Single Common Question of Law or \nFact; Here, There Are Many Common Such Questions And Such \nQuestions Predominate \n \nCommonality requires that there be “questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). A Plaintiff must be part of the same class and “pos-\nsess the same interest and suffer the same injury” as the putative class members. \nGen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982) (quotations and citations \nomitted). A claim must involve a common contention which is capable of class-wide \nresolution through a common answer. Wal-Mart v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349-350 \n(2012); see also In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Prods. Liab. Litig., \n \n2   Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Report on CMHSPs, \nPIHPs  and  Regional  Entities,  Per  Section  904(1)  of  PA  67  of  2019, \nhttps://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/Section_904-1_715330_7.pdf \n(Last Visited February 3, 2022).   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1479   Filed 04/11/22   Page 23 of 35\n722 F.3d 838, 857 (6th Cir. 2013). There must be “at least one common question \nthat,  when  answered,  substantially  advances  the  litigation.”  Dozier,  2014  WL \n5483008, at *22 (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. at 350). “[T]here need be only one common \nquestion to certify a class.” In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Prods. \nLiab. Litig., 722 F.3d at 853 (6th Cir. 2013). \n Factual variation among the class members does not defeat commonality. \nYoung v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 693 F.3d 532, 543 (6th Cir. 2012). “The common \n  \nelement may be one of fact or law and need not be one of each . . . either a question \nof law or a question of fact will suffice. Thus, for example, factual differences are \nnot fatal to a class action if common questions of law exist.” McCullough v. City of \nMontgomery, 2020 WL 7647634, at*4 (M. D. Alaska 2020) (“the existence of fac-\ntual differences does not prevent a finding of commonality”). A valid claim for class-\nwide relief may be “based on an allegation that the [defendant] engages in a pattern \nor practice of agency action or inaction—including a failure to correct a structural \ndeficiency within the agency, such as insufficient staffing—with respect to the class, \neven if plaintiffs do not contend that every member of the class has suffered an actual \ninjury.” M.D. ex rel. Stukenberg v. Perry, 675 F.3d 832, 847–48 (5th Cir. 2012).  \n“Individual differences do not defeat certification because there is no require-\nment that every other class member be affected by the institutional practice in the \nsame way. Braggs v. Dunn, 317 F.R.D. 634, 657 (M.D. Ala., 2016). \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1480   Filed 04/11/22   Page 24 of 35\n  Plaintiffs, individually and on behalf of the Class, have raised the following \ncommon claims against all Defendants, which claims are capable of class-wide res-\nolution that will advance the litigation:  \n(a) Failure to provide or arrange for home and community-based ser-\nvices and establish policies and procedures that facilitate access to \nthese services as required under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(43)(C) and \n42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5);  \n \n(b) Failure to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard after deny-\ning requests for services, reducing, suspending, or terminating ser-\nvices, and failing to provide services timely, in violation of due pro-\ncess under the United States Constitution and the Medicaid Act (42 \nU.S.C. §1396 a(a)(3), 42 CFR §431.210 and 42 CFR §431.206);  \n \n(c) Failure to operate and oversee the behavioral health managed care \nprogram consistent with Title XIX of the Social Security Act and \nimplementing regulations under 42 C.F.R. Part 438;  \n \n(d) Failure to arrange for medically necessary intensive home and com-\nmunity-based Medicaid services and administer them in the least \nrestrictive setting in violation of Title II of the ADA and § 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act; \n \n(e) Failure to make reasonable modifications to programs and policies \nto make intensive home and community-based services available in \nviolation of Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act;  \n \n(f) Failure to inform individuals of the EPSDT program what services \nare available to them, and how they may obtain those services; and  \n \n(g) Use of criteria or methods of administration which result in discrim-\nination based on disability or defeat or substantially impair accom-\nplishing their objectives in violation of Title II of the ADA and § \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1481   Filed 04/11/22   Page 25 of 35\nThe commonality requirement is satisfied where, as here, the claims are based \non a systemic failure to comply with a legal requirement, such as a provision of the \nMedicaid Act. Courts have certified classes in similar cases. For example, in O.B. v. \nNorwood, 2016 WL 2866132 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2016), the court certified a class of \nchildren who needed in-home nursing after finding that commonality was satisfied \nwhere plaintiffs alleged a systemic failure by the state agency to “arrange for” \nEPSDT services, in violation of the Medicaid Act.  \nIn N.B. v. Hamos, 26 F. Supp. 3d 756 (N.D. Ill. 2014), the court certified a \nclass of Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21 with mental health conditions and de-\nvelopmental disabilities who were eligible for, but not in receipt of, medically nec-\nessary EPSDT services. The court determined that the injuries were capable of class-\nwide resolution because the plaintiffs alleged that the state’s system violated EPSDT \nand the integration mandate of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, and that the defend-\nant failed to make available medically necessary services. Hamos, 26 F. Supp. 3d at \n773-774. The fact that the plaintiffs suffered from different mental illnesses or emo-\ntional disorders and were entitled to different EPSDT services did not inhibit a find-\ning of commonality, because the plaintiffs alleged systemic failure to provide ser-\nvices. Id at 773. Similarly, in S.R. by and through Rosenbauer v. Penn. Dept. of \nHuman Servs., 325 F.R.D. 103 (M.D. Penn. 2018), as here, the plaintiffs sought cer-\ntification  of  a  class  of  Medicaid-eligible  children  under  age  21  who  alleged \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1482   Filed 04/11/22   Page 26 of 35\nviolations of the Medicaid Act’s EPSDT provisions, the ADA, and the Rehabilita-\ntion Act. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs could not satisfy commonality, \nciting Wal-Mart v. Dukes. Id. at 109-110. In that case the court found defendants’ \nreliance on Dukes misdirected in part because plaintiffs alleged systemic deficien-\ncies that did not require individualized determinations. Id. The court found that “this \nis exactly the type of ‘common mode’ or practice predicating each alleged violation \nthat  was  noticeably  absent  from  Dukes.”  Id.  See  also,  e.g.,  Dozier,  2014  WL \n5483008, at *22 (claims that former Medicaid beneficiaries’ coverage was termi-\nnated without adequate notice capable of class-wide resolution). Here, as in Hamos \nand Rosenbauer, the Class claims are based on common contentions capable of \nclass-wide resolution and Plaintiffs have satisfied commonality. \nC. The Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical of The Class Claims \n \nTo be certified, the plaintiffs’ claims must be typical of the class claims. Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). The typicality requirement is satisfied where the claims arise \nfrom the same event or conduct or practice and are based on the same legal theory.  \nIn re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. 1996). Typicality serves to \nensure that the named plaintiff’s interests are aligned with the class members’ inter-\nests so that the plaintiff advocates on the class members’ behalf. In re Whirlpool, \n722 F.3d at 852. The requirement is satisfied if the plaintiff’s claims fairly encom-\npass the class claims. Id.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1483   Filed 04/11/22   Page 27 of 35\n “A claim is typical if ‘it arises from the same event or practice or course of \nconduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, and if his or her claims \nare based on the same legal theory.’” Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, 561 \n(6th Cir. 2007) (quoting In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. \n1996)). In this case, the injury suffered by all class members arises from the alleged \nfailure of MDHHS to provide or arrange for medically necessary services and ob-\nserve due process, as required by the Medicaid Act, ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cases alleging denial of a \nstatutorily mandated benefit usually meet the typicality requirement. The particular \nreason why this statutory obligation is not being fulfilled for a particular member of \nthe class is not relevant to finding that their injury arises from violation of the same \nstatute. See Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936-37 (2d Cir. 1993) (“When it is \nalleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named \nplaintiff and the class . . . the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of \nminor variations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims.”). \nHere, Plaintiffs’ claims and the claims of each putative Class member arise \nfrom the same events, practices, or course of conduct – namely, Defendants’ denial \nor failure to provide medically necessary intensive home and community based ser-\nvices as required under EPSDT. Moreover, the claims are premised upon the exact \nsame violations of federal law. Because Plaintiffs cannot prove their own claims \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1484   Filed 04/11/22   Page 28 of 35\nagainst Defendants without necessarily proving each putative Class member’s indi-\nvidual claim against Defendants, it goes without saying that Plaintiffs’ claims are \ntypical of the Class claims. Roberts, 2015 WL 1401352, at *4 (typicality is not sat-\nisfied where plaintiff proves his claim without proving anyone else’ claim). The \nnamed Plaintiffs’ injuries arise from the same conduct affecting the Class in its en-\ntirety – Defendants’ failure to make available medically necessary intensive home \nand community-based mental health services covered under EPSDT services. See \nN.B., 26 F. Supp. 3d at 771 (finding typicality where named plaintiffs all had mental \nhealth or behavioral health disorders and alleged denial of access to intensive com-\nmunity based services). A sufficient relationship exists between the named Plain-\ntiffs’ injuries and the conduct affecting the class.  \nD. The Plaintiffs Will Fairly and Adequately Protect the Class \n \nFinally, Rule 23(a)(4) requires that the class be adequately and fairly repre-\nsented by both the named plaintiffs and counsel. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). This in-\nquiry involves two criteria: “(1) the representative must have common interests with \nunnamed members of the class, and (2) it must appear that the representatives will \nvigorously prosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.” Young, \n693 F.3d at 543. Class counsel must also be qualified, experienced, and able to liti-\ngate the matter. Id.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1485   Filed 04/11/22   Page 29 of 35\n Here, the named Plaintiffs and the Class members have common interests \nsuch that no conflict of interest exists between them. As discussed, Plaintiffs share \nthe same interests and incentives as the Class members: to receive the medically \nnecessary home and community-based services to which they are entitled under the \nMedicaid Act’s EPSDT provisions. Because their claims arise out of the same con-\nduct, Plaintiffs’ will necessarily advocate zealously on behalf of the Class.  \nFurther, the firms serving as class counsel – Mantese Honigman, P.C., Disa-\nbility Rights Michigan, the National Health Law Program, Inc., and John J Conway \nP.C. – are qualified, experienced, and able to conduct this litigation. The cocounsel \nagreement between the firms provides that Dave Honigman of Mantese Honigman, \nP.C. and Kyle Williams of Disability Rights Michigan shall jointly serve as lead \ncounsel.

Plaintiffs Meet the Requirements for Certification Under Rule \n23(b)(2)  \n \nIn addition to Rule 23(a), a class seeking certification must satisfy one sub-\nsection  of  Rule  23(b).  Plaintiffs  seek  to  certify  their  class  in  accordance  with \nRule 23(b)(2), which is appropriate where “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive \n \n4   See, e.g., McBride, et al. v. Mich. Dept. of Corr., No. 2:1S-cv-11222 (E.D. \nMich.); Waskul v. Washtenaw County Community Mental Health, 979 F.3d 426 \n(6th Cir. 2020). \n \n5   See, e.g., O.B. v. Norwood, 2016 WL 2866132 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2016); T.R. \nv. Dreyfus, No. 2:09-cv-01677-TSZ (W.D. Wash. July 23, 2010) (certifying \nclass); Pashby v. Cansler, 297 F.R.D. 347 (E.D.N.C. 2011), aff’d on other \ngrounds sub nom. Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307 (4th Cir. 2013). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1487   Filed 04/11/22   Page 31 of 35\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nIndeed, courts frequently certify classes under Rule 23(b)(2) in cases where \nMedicaid recipients seek to enforce their rights. See Hamos, 26 F. Supp. 3d at 774 \n(Rule 23(b)(2) satisfied where the only remedy for class alleging violations of \nEPSDT provisions was statewide implementation of services); M.H. v. Berry, 2017 \nWL 2570262 at *6 (N.D. Georgia, 2017) (Rule 23(b)(2) met where injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment would resolve issues); Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48 (3rd \nCir. 1994) (class of child welfare recipients alleging systemic violations met Rule \n23(b)(2) criteria); Cutler v. Perales, 128 F.R.D. 39, 47 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (class of \nMedicaid recipients alleging fair hearing delays under Rule 23(b)(2));  see also Koss \nv. Norwood, 305 F.Supp.3d 897 (N.D. Ill. 2018); Rosie D. ex rel. John D. v. Romney, \n474 F.Supp.2d 238 (D. Mass. 2007) (remedial order following decision involving \nclass of Medicaid-eligible children with serious emotional disturbances). \nLawsuits like this one, in which plaintiffs allege systemic violations of civil \nrights guaranteed by federal law, is a classic example of an action appropriate for \ncertification under subdivision (b) (2): \nSubdivision (b)(2). This subdivision is intended to reach situations \nwhere a party has taken action or refused to take action with respect to \na class, and final relief of an injunctive nature or of a corresponding \ndeclaratory nature, settling the legality of the behavior with respect to \nthe class as a whole, is appropriate . . . Action or inaction is directed \nto a class within the meaning of this subdivision even if it has taken \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1488   Filed 04/11/22   Page 32 of 35\neffect or is threatened only as to one or a few members of the class, \nprovided it is based on grounds which have general application to \nthe class. Illustrative are various actions in the civil-rights field where \na party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class, usu-\nally one whose members are incapable of specific enumeration. \n \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, Advisory Committee Notes, 1966 Amendment \n(Emphasis supplied). \n \nMoreover, “[Rule] 23 (b)(2) certification is not barred when not all the class \nmembers have been injured since ‘not all class members must be aggrieved by the \ndefendant’s conduct as long as the challenged policy is generally applicable to the \nclass as a whole.’” Newberg On Class Actions, §4:28, p. 105 \nHere, plaintiffs allege violations of their rights under the Medicaid Act, ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. Moreover, \nDefendants are charged with action or inaction directed to the class based on gener-\nally applicable grounds. Here, Plaintiffs seek to “settl[e] the legality of th[is] behav-\nior with respect to the class as a whole.” (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, Advisory Committee \nNotes, 1966 Amendment). This case is a paradigmatic instance for the certification \nof a (b)(2) class and Plaintiffs have more than satisfied the minimum requirements \nthat entitle them to maintain a (b)(2) class action.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court certify \nthis Class pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2). \nDated: April 11, 2022         \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 77, PageID.1489   Filed 04/11/22   Page 33 of 35\n              Respectfully submitted, \n              MANTESE HONIGMAN, P.C. \n \n              Attorneys for Plaintiffs       \n              By: /s/ Dave Honigman     \nDave Honigman (P33146) \ndhonigman@manteselaw.com \nBy: /s/Gerard V.

Plaintiffs,  seven  children  receiving  Medicaid  benefits  for \nmental-health conditions, allege Michigan is not providing them home- and community-based \nservices (HCBS) for mental health with reasonable promptness, if at all. They seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief to mandate Michigan’s compliance with federal law.  \nPlaintiffs now seek class certification. As explained hereafter, Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion \nfor Class Certification will be granted and the proposed class will be certified.  \nI.   \nThis  case  involves  Michigan’s  compliance  with  the  Federal  Medicaid  Program,  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and procedural \ndue process. ECF. No. 71 at PageID.1190–91. Federal and State governments jointly fund \nMedicaid under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. See 42 U.S.C. § 1296 et seq. Like all states \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 83, PageID.1551   Filed 11/03/22   Page 2 of 9\nparticipating in Medicaid, Michigan must provide EPSDT services1 to eligible children under the \nage of 21. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10)(A), (4)(B), (43), 1396d(r).  \nMichigan receives Medicaid funds to provide health services. Id. at PageID.1197–98. The \nMichigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) administers Medicaid. ECF No. \n77 at PageID.1470–71. To that end, the MDHHS contracts with ten Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans \n(“PIHPs”) that contract with Community Mental Health Service Providers that deliver HCBS in \ndesignated geographic regions. Id. \nPlaintiffs brought this case in June 2018 against the MDHHS, Nick Lyon, and the Governor \nof Michigan. ECF No. 1. The latter has since been dismissed. ECF No. 59. Plaintiffs contend the \nPIHPs, and thus the MDHHS, are not fulfilling Medicaid’s requirements and therefore seek \ninjunctive and declaratory relief.2 ECF No. 71.  \nPlaintiffs are seven Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries under the age of 21 allegedly injured \nby Defendant’s failure to provide the required EPSDT services promptly, if at all. D.D. is 11 and \n \n1 The MDHHS must provide EPSDT services with reasonable promptness. See 42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(8); 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(a). EPSDT services includes a variety screening, diagnostic, and \ntreatment services. See Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment, MEDICAID.GOV, \nhttps://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/benefits/early-and-periodic-screening-diagnostic-and-treatment/index.html \n[https://perma.cc/8MY6-AG5Y]. More specifically, EPSDT services include all 31 services listed \nunder  §  1396d(a).  These  services  include:  home  health-care  services,  id.  §  1396d(a)(7), \nrehabilitative services, id. § 1396d(a)(13), arrangements for community-supported living, id. § \n1396d(a)(23), services in intermediate-care facilities, id. § 1396d(a)(15), and inpatient psychiatric \nhospitalization, id. § 1396d(a)(16). \n \n2 Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, a federal court with subject-matter jurisdiction “may \ndeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.” 28 \nU.S.C. § 2201(a). A declaratory judgment may be the basis of “further necessary or proper \nrelief” against the adverse party. Id. § 2022. But the Declaratory Judgment Act does not “relax \nArticle III’s command that an actual case or controversy exist” before a federal court may \nadjudicate a question and grant declaratory relief.

Genetech, Inc., 549 U.S. \n118, 138 (2007) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (“[T]he question in each case is whether the facts \nalleged . . . show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal \ninterests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.” \n(citation omitted)). \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 83, PageID.1552   Filed 11/03/22   Page 3 of 9\nhas had more than 30 ER visits for mental-health crises. See ECF No. 71 at PageID.1211. G.G. is \n18, has ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Down Syndrome, and experiences “severe behavioral \noutbursts,” often becoming physically aggressive and destroying property. Id. at PageID.1219, \n1221. L.G. is 16, has PTSD, Reactive Attachment Disorder, and a mood disorder, and her mother \nbrought criminal charges against her on a CMH employee’s advice that it was “the only way she \nwould qualify for residential treatment.” Id. at PageID.1230–31. S.W. is 15 and has attempted \nsuicide on multiple occasions. Id. at PageID.1235. M.M. is 14, has schizophrenia and bipolar \ndisorder, and is institutionalized. Id. at PageID.1226–27.

ECF No. 1. But after a partially successful \nmotion to dismiss, the remaining claims include violations of the Federal Medicaid Early and \nPeriodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment Mandate (Count I), the ADA (Count II), and § 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act (Count III). Plaintiffs also allege a violation of the due-process provisions \nof the Federal Medicaid Act (Count IV) and Fourteenth Amendment (Count V). ECF No. 71. \nIn  August  2020,  the  parties  filed  an  interim  agreement  that  outlined  their  goals, \ncommitments, and expected achievements. See generally ECF No. 50. The agreement highlighted \nthe  expectation  that  Michigan  would  detail  various  “implementation  plans”  for  timely  and \neffectively providing HCBS to eligible children, ensuring the quality and adequacy of the PIHPs’ \ncapacity throughout Michigan, and conducting effective outreach.

ECF No. 64 at PageID.1162. \nPlaintiffs seek the following relief:  \n(1)  a  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants  have  not  complied  with  certain \nprovisions of the previously mentioned acts;  \n(2) a declaration that Defendants unlawfully failed to provide certain services to \nPlaintiffs and Class Members;  \n(3) a preliminary injunction permanently enjoining Defendants from violating the \nrights of Plaintiffs and Class Members; \n(4)  a  preliminary  injunction  permanently  mandating  Defendants  to  arrange \ntreatment for Plaintiffs and Class Members; \n(5) costs and attorney’s fees; and \n(6) for this Court to retain jurisdiction “until such time as [it] is satisfied that the \nDefendants’ unlawful policies, practices, and acts . . . cannot recur[.]” \n \nECF No. 71 at PageID.1249.  \nPlaintiffs propose that the class includes \nAll Medicaid-eligible beneficiaries under the age of 21 in the State of \nMichigan for whom a licensed practitioner of the healing arts acting within the \nscope of practice under state law has determined, through an assessment, that \nintensive [HCBS] are needed to correct or ameliorate their emotional, behavioral, \nor psychiatric condition. \n \nECF No. 77 at PageID.1468. \nDefendants “do not object” but “reserve the right to challenge the facts and \nallegations brought forth in Plaintiff’s [sic] Amended Motion for Class Certification and \nto  move  to  de-certify  the  class  should  circumstances  warrant  it.”  ECF  No.  79  at \nPageID.1536–37.  \nII. \n  Rule 23 governs certification of putative classes. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 350 (2011). A “district court has broad discretion to decide whether to certify a class.” Glazer \n- 4 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 83, PageID.1554   Filed 11/03/22   Page 5 of 9\nv. Whirlpool Corp. (In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer Prods. Liab. Litig.), 722 F.3d \n838, 850 (6th Cir. 2013). \nA. \n  A putative class must meet Rule 23(a)’s four requirements: numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequate representation. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a). A court may certify a class only \nif “the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.”  Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350–51 (citations \nomitted). As explained below, the putative class satisfies Rule 23(a)’s four requirements.  \ni. \nFirst, the putative class must be so numerous that joinder is “impracticable.” FED. R. CIV. \nP. 23(a)(1). Although the number of potential class members is not always dispositive, “a number \nmore than several hundred[] can be the only factor needed to satisfy Rule 23(a)(1).” Bacon v. \nHonda of Am. Mfg., Inc., 370 F.3d 565, 570 (6th Cir. 2004). \nJoinder would be impracticable here. Plaintiffs contend there are more than 60,000 eligible \nchildren in Michigan who have not received EPSDT services through Michigan’s Medicaid \nprogram. ECF. No. 71 at PageID.1193. Although the exact number of class members is unknown \nbecause the MDHHS maintains data for only Medicaid-beneficiaries under the age of 18, ECF No. \n77 at PageID.1477–78, “general knowledge and common sense indicate that it is large,” see Beattie \nv. CenturyTel, Inc., 234 F.R.D. 160, 168 (E.D. Mich. 2006), aff’d 511 F.3d 554 (6th Cir. 2007). \nFor these reasons, numerosity is satisfied. \nii. \nSecond, the putative class must share at least one common issue of fact and law. FED. R. \nCIV. P. 23(a)(2). “Commonality” merely requires one “common contention” that is “capable of \nclasswide resolution.” Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350; accord In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading \n- 5 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 83, PageID.1555   Filed 11/03/22   Page 6 of 9\nWasher Prods. Liab. Litig., 722 F.3d 838, 853 (6th Cir. 2013) (“[T]here need be only one common \nquestion  to  certify  a  class.”).  Factual  variation  among  the  class  members  does  not  defeat \ncommonality. Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins., 693 F.3d 532, 543 (6th Cir. 2012).  \nPlaintiffs have raised the following common questions of law and fact against Defendants:  \n(a) Whether Defendants failed to provide or to arrange for HCBS and to establish \npolicies and procedures that facilitate access to HCBS, as required under 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(43)(C), 1396d(r)(5);  \n(b) Whether Defendants failed to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard \nafter  denying  requests  for  services;  reducing,  suspending,  or  terminating \nservices;  or  failing  to  provide  services  timely  violating  the  due-process \nrequirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Medicaid Act (42 U.S.C. § \n1396a(a)(3), and 42 CFR §§ 431.210, 431.206);  \n(c) Whether Defendants failed to operate and to oversee the behavioral-health \nmanaged-care program consistent with Title XIX of the Social Security Act and \nthe implementation regulations of 42 C.F.R. § 438 et seq.; \n(d) Whether Defendants failed to arrange for medically necessary HCBS and to \nadminister them in the least restrictive setting under Title II of the ADA and § \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act;  \n(e) Whether Defendants failed to reasonably modify programs and policies to make \nHCBS available under Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act; \n(f) Whether Defendants failed to inform individuals of the EPSDT program, what \nservices are available to them, and how they can obtain those services; and  \n(g) Whether  Defendants  discriminated  based  on  disability  or  defeated  or \nsubstantially impaired their objectives, violating Title II of the ADA and § 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act.  \nECF No. 77 at PageID.1480.  \nThese eight common questions of law and fact satisfy commonality. Because the claims \nare based on Michigan’s allegedly systematic failure to comply with Medicaid requirement, their \ninjuries are capable of a class-wide resolution. See, e.g., N.B. v. Hamos, 26 F. Supp. 3d 756, 773–\n74 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (“[T]he systemic failure to provide required coverage for [HCBS] . . . . supplies \na common contention capable of resolution on a class-wide basis.”). \niii. \nThird, Plaintiffs’ claims must be “typical of the [putative class’s] claims.” FED. R. CIV. P. \n23(a)(3). “Typicality is met if the class members’ claims are fairly encompassed by the named \n- 6 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 83, PageID.1556   Filed 11/03/22   Page 7 of 9\nplaintiffs’ claims.” In re Whirlpool, 722 F.3d 838, 852 (6th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks \nomitted); see also Beattie v. CenturyTel, Inc., 511 F.3d 554, 561 (6th Cir. 2007) (“A claim is \ntypical if ‘it arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims \nof other class members, and if his or her claims are based on the same legal theory.’” (quoting In \nre Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. 1996))).   \nPlaintiffs’ claims involve the same types of injuries as the members of the putative class: \nthe MDHHS’s systematic failure to provide medically necessary HCBS and to observe due \nprocess, as required by the Medicaid Act, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ECF No. 77 at PageID.1483. The similar injuries satisfy \ntypicality. See N.B., 26 F. Supp. 3d at 771 (holding that typicality was satisfied because named \nplaintiffs all had mental- or behavioral-health disorders and alleged “common question [of] \nwhether the state is providing required [HCBS] services” that “are ‘medically necessary’”). \niv. \nFinally, Plaintiffs must “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.” FED. R. \nCIV. P. 23(a)(4). Two criteria govern adequacy: “1) the representative must have common interests \nwith unnamed members of the class, and 2) it must appear that the representatives will vigorously \nprosecute the interests of the class through qualified counsel.” In re Am. Med. Sys., 75 F.3d at \n1083; see also Young v. Nationwide Mut. Ins., 693 F.3d 532, 543 (6th Cir. 2012) (holding class \ncounsel must be qualified, experienced, and able to litigate the matter).  \nThe proposed class is adequate. Plaintiffs bring the same claims as every other class \nmember, and their interests are not antagonistic. See discussion supra Section II.A.ii. Indeed, they \napparently have the same goal: to obtain declaratory and injunctive relief requiring Michigan to \nprovide HCBS as required by the Medicaid Act’s EPSDT provisions. ECF No. 77 at PageID.1485.  \n- 7 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 83, PageID.1557   Filed 11/03/22   Page 8 of 9\nAnd the proposed class counsel—Mantese Honigman, P.C., Disability Rights Michigan, \nthe National Health Law Program, Inc., and John J. Conway P.C.—are qualified, experienced, and \nready to conduct the litigation. Mantese Honigman specializes in and has more than ten years of \nexperience litigating complex class actions in federal and state courts. See ECF No. 77-2 at \nPageID.1493–96, 1502–05. Disability Rights Michigan is a protection-and-advocacy organization \nlegally authorized to advocate for and to protect the rights of disabled people in Michigan, and its \nattorneys  have  extensive  experience  litigating  Medicaid  disputes.  See  ECF  No.  77-3  at \nPageID.1511–12. John Conway specializes in class actions and has more than 21 years of \nexperience as colead counsel in class actions. See ECF No. 77-4 at PageID.1515. The National \nHealth Law Program’s attorneys have experience with Medicaid class actions and have served as \nclass counsel in similar cases. See ECF No. 77-5. \nAlthough all four firms serving as counsel are adequate, “the court must appoint the \napplicant best able to represent the interests of the class.” FED. R. CIV. P. 23(g)(2) (emphasis \nadded). This Court finds that Attorney David Honigman is the applicant best able to represent the \ninterests of the class based on his experience litigating class actions and his active involvement \nwith this case. Accordingly, he will be appointed as class counsel.   \nB. \nHaving decided that the putative class satisfies the four requirements of Rule 23(a), the \nsecond step is to determine whether it “fits within one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b).” \nHicks v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 965 F.3d 452, 457 (6th Cir. 2020); FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b). \n  A district court may certify a “mandatory class” if the opposing party “has acted or refused \nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2); see also \n- 8 - \n \n\nCase 1:18-cv-11795-TLL-PTM   ECF No. 83, PageID.1558   Filed 11/03/22   Page 9 of 9\nColeman v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 296 F.3d 443, 447 (6th Cir. 2002) (explaining that \nRule 23(b)(2) classes do not require “notice and the opportunity to ‘opt out’ of the class action”).  \nThis class fits within Rule 23(b)(2). Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from withholding \nmedically necessary HCBS that is required by the Medicaid Act’s EPSDT provisions. See ECF \nNo. 77 at PageID.1483. Plaintiffs also “seek ‘to settl[e] the legality of [Defendants’] behavior with \nrespect to the class as a whole.’” Id. at PageID.1488 (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 23 advisory \ncommittee’s  note  to  1966  amendment).  Thus,  the  interests  of  the  class  members  are \n“homogenous.” See N.B. v. Hamos, 26 F. Supp. 3d 756, 774 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (holding that Rule \n23(b)(2)  was  satisfied  because  the  only  remedy  for  EPSDT  violations  was  statewide \nimplementation of services). \nIII. \nAccordingly, it is ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Certify, ECF No. 77, is \nGRANTED. The putative class, defined in Part I, supra, is certified under Rule 23(a) and Rule \n23(b)(2).  \nFurther, it is ORDERED that Plaintiffs are APPOINTED as class representatives and \nPlaintiffs’ counsel David Honigman is APPOINTED as class counsel.  \n \nDated: November 3, 2022        s/Thomas L.

(ECF No. 50) \n2. Since that date, the parties have continued to actively engage in \nsettlement negotiations.  While the parties have made significant \nprogress toward settlement, additional time is needed to draft a \nfinal settlement agreement. \n3.  As such, the parties stipulate to extend the Interim Agreement to \nFebruary 1, 2022, at which time the parties intend to have a final \nagreement to submit to the Court.   \n4.
