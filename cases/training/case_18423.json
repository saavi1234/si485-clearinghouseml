Plaintiff, Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service, Inc. (“MPAS”), \nbrings this action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 15041-15045, Developmental Disabilities Assistance and \nBill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD); and 29 U.S.C. § 794e, the Protection \nand  Advocacy  of  Individual  Rights  (“PAIR”),  Program  of  the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973. \n2.  MPAS  challenges  Defendants’  failure  to  disclose  documents  and \ninformation  relating  to  the  abuse/neglect  investigation  of  patients \nresiding in its nursing home facilities. \n3.  This information was requested by Plaintiff and disclosure is required \nby the DD and/or PAIR Acts. \n4.  Regardless of the specifics of the individuals’ disabilities, MPAS has \naccess authority under either the DD or PAIR Act, or both.  \n5.  MPAS is charged with the responsibility, both under federal and state \nlaw, to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect against persons \nwith disabilities. \n6.  Defendants’ failure to provide the documents and information at issue \nhas interfered with Plaintiff’s investigative responsibilities and resulted \nin Plaintiff being denied its rights pursuant to the PAIMI, DD, and \n2 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.3   Filed 12/19/13   Page 3 of 12\nPAIR  Acts  to  investigate  the  suspected  incidents  of  abuse  and \nneglect. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n7.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  this  action  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1331. \n8.  Plaintiff’s federal claims are made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 15041-\n15045 and 29 U.S.C. § 794e. \n9.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201, 2202. \n10.  Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), \nas all of the events and omissions complained of below occurred in \nthis district. \nPARTIES \n \n11.  Plaintiff, MPAS, is a Michigan non-profit corporation. \n12.  The  Governor  of  Michigan  has  designated  MPAS  as  the  state’s \nprotection and advocacy system, pursuant to MCL 330.1931 with the \nresponsibility to enforce and carry out the federal mandates under the \nPAIMI, DD, and PAIR Acts. \n3 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.4   Filed 12/19/13   Page 4 of 12\n13.  As the state’s protection and advocacy system, MPAS has a duty to \ninvestigate  allegations  of  abuse  and  neglect  of  persons  with \ndisabilities. MCLA 330.1931(2). \n14.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Aspen  Ridge,  LLC  is  a \ndomestic  limited  liability  company  conducting  business  under  the \nassumed name of Hickory Ridge of Temperance (“Hickory”). \n15.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendant  Ciena  Health  Care \nManagement,  Inc.  is  a  domestic  profit  corporation  conducting \nbusiness  under  the  assumed  names  of  Ciena  Healthcare \nManagement, Inc. and Ciena Healthcare. \n16.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Hickory  Ridge  of  Temperance,  which \nDefendants  own  and  operate,  is  a  nursing  home  located  in \nTemperance, Michigan, in Monroe County.  \nFACTS \n \n17.  On or about September 30, 2013, MPAS learned of allegations of \nabuse/neglect  against  individuals  who  were  patients  at  Hickory, \nthrough  an  abbreviated  survey  completed  by  the  Michigan \nDepartment  of  Licensing  and  Regulatory  Affairs,  Bureau  of  Health \nCare Services. \n4 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.5   Filed 12/19/13   Page 5 of 12\n18.  The survey, dated September 6, 2013 identified the alleged victims \nonly as Resident #102 and Resident #105. \n19.  Based on the abbreviated survey of Hickory, MPAS determined that \nResident  #102  had  been  diagnosed  with  physical  disabilities, \nincluding aphasia and history of a stroke that resulted in her right arm \nbeing contracted. \n20.  According to the survey, Resident #102 sustained fractures to her \nright wrist and elbow. The examining physician determined that the \ninjuries most likely occurred when a staff member was forceful with \nResident #102’s arm during application of a splint. \n21.  Based on the abbreviated survey of Hickory, MPAS determined that \nResident #105 had been diagnosed with physical disabilities including \nhistory  of  a  stroke  with  left-sided  Hemiparesis  and  left  arm \ncontracture. \n22.  According to the survey, Resident #105 was subjected to rude and \nhostile treatment by a certified nursing assistant (“CNA”) who threw a \ntowel  on  Resident  #105  while  she  was  showering  and  left  her \nunattended in the shower room, and who was also rough with her \nduring transfers from her wheelchair to her bed. \n5 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.6   Filed 12/19/13   Page 6 of 12\n23.  Based on these facts, MPAS determined it had probable cause, as \nthe state’s protection and advocacy system, to open an investigation \ninto  the  possible  abuse  and/or  neglect  of  people  with  disabilities \nresiding at Whitehall, specifically Resident #102 and Resident #105. \n24.  On October 1, 2013, an advocate from MPAS sent a letter to Hickory \nrequesting specific records related to Resident #102 and Resident \n#105. \n25.  MPAS sent the letter by United States Postal Service Certified Mail \n(return receipt). It was received by Hickory on October 7, 2013, and \nsigned for by Hickory employee Heidi Clark. \n26.  Defendants  made  no  disclosure  of  records,  nor  acknowledged  the \nrequest in any way. \n27.  On October 15, 2013, an advocate from MPAS sent a second records \nrequest letter to Hickory. The letter reiterated MPAS’ access authority \nand the purpose of the request for records. \n28.  MPAS sent the letter by United States Postal Service Certified Mail \n(return receipt).  It was received by Hickory on October 18, 2013, and \nsigned for by Hickory employee Robert Moore. \n6 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.7   Filed 12/19/13   Page 7 of 12\n29.  As  of  the  date  of  this  filing,  MPAS  has  not  received  any  of  the \nrequested  records,  nor  has  there  been  any  response  from \nDefendants. \nCOUNT I – VIOLATION OF THE DD ACT \n \n30.  Plaintiff incorporates and re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 29, as if \nfully set forth herein. \n31.  As  Michigan’s  designated  protection  and  advocacy  system,  MPAS \nhas the right to access all records of individuals to which the DD Act \napplies when conducting abuse and neglect investigations. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 15043. \n32.  The  DD  Act  applies  to  Hickory  Ridge  of  Temperance.  42  U.S.C. \n§ 15043(2)(B). \n33.  Upon information and belief, the DD Act applies to Resident #102 and \nResident #105 due to each patient’s residence in a facility and their \ndiagnoses. 42 U.S.C. § 15002(8). \n34.  Based on survey results, MPAS determined it had probable cause to \nopen an investigation, as the state’s protection and advocacy system, \ninto the possible abuse and/or neglect of persons with disabilities. 42 \nU.S.C. § 5043(a)(2)(B).  \n7 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.8   Filed 12/19/13   Page 8 of 12\n35.  This determination of probable cause is within the discretion of MPAS \nalone. See Arizona Center for Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689 \n(D. Ariz. 2000) (“. . . the P&A is the final arbiter of probable cause for \nthe  purpose  of  triggering  its  authority  to  access  all  records  for  an \nindividual that may have been subject to abuse or neglect.”) \n36.  Defendants’  failure  to  provide  Plaintiff  with  the  requested  records, \nrelating  to  the  allegations  of  abuse  and/or  neglect  of  residents  of \nWhitehall and Fenton, violates MPAS’ rights under the DD Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043. \n37.  The incidents at issue fall clearly within the Act’s definitions of abuse \nor neglect. 45 C.F.R. § 1386.19. \n38.  P&A systems must have access to individual records “prepared or \nreceived in the course of providing intake, assessment, evaluation, \neducation, training and other supportive services, including medical \nrecords, financial records, and monitoring and other reports prepared \nor received by a member of the staff of a facility that is providing care \nor treatment.” 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22(b). \n39.  MPAS  is  also  entitled  to  incident  reports  prepared  by  a  facility \nrendering care or treatment, in whatever format they are kept. This \nincludes reports that describe abuse, neglect, or injury occurring at \n8 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.9   Filed 12/19/13   Page 9 of 12\nthe  facility,  the  steps  taken  to  investigate  the  incidents,  personnel \nrecords and supporting information relied upon in creating a report, \nand records describing persons who were interviewed, physical and \ndocumentary  evidence  that  was  reviewed,  and  the  related \ninvestigative findings. 45 C.F.R. § 1386.22. \n40.  The DD Act requires prompt written justification if a request is denied \nfor lack of authorization, as well as provision of contact information for \na resident or his or her legal representative. \n41.   Defendants did not respond to MPAS’ records requests in any way.  \n42.  Defendants’  actions  frustrate,  impinge,  and  prevent  MPAS  from \nmeeting its responsibilities under federal and state law to investigate \nallegations of abuse and/or neglect of individuals with developmental \ndisabilities. \n43.  MPAS has no adequate remedy at law. \nCOUNT II – VIOLATION OF THE PAIR ACT \n \n44.  Plaintiff incorporates and re-alleges paragraphs 1 through 43, as if \nfully set forth herein. \n45.  As  Michigan’s  designated  protection  and  advocacy  system,  MPAS \nhas the right to access all records of individuals to which the PAIR \n9 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.10   Filed 12/19/13   Page 10 of 12\nAct  applies  when  conducting  abuse  and  neglect  investigations.  29 \nU.S.C. § 794e, and 42 U.S.C. § 15043. \n46.  Upon  information  and  belief,  if  the  patients  named  above  are  not \ncovered by the DD Act, they are covered under the PAIR Act. 29 \nU.S.C. § 794e(a)(1)(B). \n47.  Based on survey results, MPAS determined it had probable cause to \nopen an investigation, as the state’s protection and advocacy system, \ninto the possible abuse and/or neglect of persons with disabilities. \n48.  This determination of probable cause is within the discretion of MPAS \nalone. See Arizona Center for Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689 \n(D. Ariz. 2000) (“. . . the P&A is the final arbiter of probable cause for \nthe  purpose  of  triggering  its  authority  to  access  all  records  for  an \nindividual that may have been subject to abuse or neglect.”) \n49.  Defendants’  failure  to  provide  Plaintiff  with  the  requested  records, \nrelating  to  the  allegations  of  abuse  and/or  neglect  of  residents  of \nHickory Ridge of Temperance, violates MPAS’ rights under the PAIR \nAct.  29 U.S.C. § 794e. \n50.  Defendants’  actions  frustrate,  impinge  and  prevent  MPAS  from \nmeeting its responsibilities under federal and state law to investigate \nallegations of abuse and/or neglect of individuals with disabilities. \n10 \n\nCase 2:13-cv-15177-LPZ-MKM   ECF No. 1, PageID.11   Filed 12/19/13   Page 11 of 12\n \n51.  MPAS has no adequate remedy at law. \nREQUESTED RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court: \nA. Enter  a  declaratory  judgment,  in  accordance  with  28  U.S.C.  §  2201, \ndeclaring that Defendants’ actions and omissions violate the DD and/or \nPAIR Act(s) by: \ni)  Denying Plaintiff access to patient records; and \nii)  Preventing MPAS from fully performing its statutory duty to \ninvestigate incidents of suspected abuse and/or neglect of \nindividuals with disabilities; \nB. Enter  permanent  injunctive  relief,  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2202, \nrequiring Defendants to provide MPAS any and all reports, documents, \nand records pertaining to the patients and alleged incidents in question; \nC.
