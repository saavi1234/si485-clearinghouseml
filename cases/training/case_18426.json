On December 11, 1992, Michigan Protection and Advocacy (P&amp;A) Service filed this lawsuit against Gerard H. Miller in his official capacity as Director of Michigan&rsquo;s Department of Social Services (Department) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The P&amp;A filed this lawsuit under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act) and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI Act). Represented by itself, Michigan P&amp;A sought injunctive relief that required the Department provide them access to youth residents at Department operated facilities under its DD Act and PAIMI Act access authority. Judge David William McKeague presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>This case began after the Department denied Michigan P&amp;A access to residents at youth facilities it operated where Michigan P&amp;A alleged that individuals with disabilities resided. The Department maintained that the P&amp;A could only speak with residents at these facilities if the individual was a client of the P&amp;A or the P&amp;A received a complaint of abuse or neglect about the individual, and also argued that the P&amp;A could not access facilities they operated. In March 24 1994, the court granted the P&amp;A&rsquo;s Motion for Summary Judgment under both the PAIMI and DD Acts. The court held that the P&amp;A could access Department operated facilities, and that Michigan&rsquo;s PAIMI and DD Act authorities included speaking with facility residents even when residents are not P&amp;A clients. The court appointed two Special Masters to determine the scope of Michigan&rsquo;s individual access authority under both acts. In April 22 1994, the case was dismissed. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>No documents available from PACER - restricted</p>",
