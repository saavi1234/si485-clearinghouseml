Plaintiff alleged that the City of Lansing violated the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) Act, the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights (DD) Act, and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights (PAIR) Program, when the City of Lansing Police Department (Police Department) refused to provide access to records for purposes of investigating abuse and neglect. Judge Hon. Paul L. Maloney presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>This lawsuit began after MPAS determined that it had probable cause to investigate the possible abuse and/or neglect of an individual with a disability upon receiving a death report of a patient in the psychiatric unit of Sparrow Hospital. The Police Department denied MPAS&rsquo; request to access records pertaining to the alleged abuse and/or neglect, insisting that the records must be redacted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</p>\r\n<p>On January 31, 2020, the court approved a consent decree negotiated by the parties. The decree stated that plaintiff would have access to the records, with Law Enforcement Information Network information but not personal health information redacted, and that the lawsuit would be dismissed with prejudice. The defendant paid $462.56 in litigation costs to MPAS. On February 6, 2020, the court issued an order of dismissal.</p>\r\n<p>The case is now closed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Plaintiff, Michigan Protection and Advocacy Service, Inc. (MPAS), brings \nthis action for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to the Protection and \nAdvocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986 (PAIMI Act), 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 10807-10827; the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill \nof Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 15041-15045; the Protection \nand Advocacy of Individual Rights Program of the Rehabilitation Act of \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.2   Filed 01/13/20   Page 2 of 10\n1973 (PAIR Act), as amended, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e and for attorney fees and \ncosts pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \n2.  Plaintiff,  MPAS,  challenges  Defendant's  failure  to  disclose  documents \nrelating to allegations of abuse and neglect regarding the alleged victim. \n3.  This information was requested by Plaintiff and disclosure is required by the \nPAIMI, DD, and PAIR Acts. \n4.  MPAS is charged with the responsibility, both under federal and state law, to \ninvestigate allegations of abuse and neglect against persons with disabilities. \n5.  Defendant's failure to provide the documents and information at issue has \ninterfered  with  Plaintiff's  investigative  responsibilities  and  resulted  in \nPlaintiff being denied its rights, pursuant to the PAIMI, DD, and PAIR Acts \nto investigate the suspected incidents of abuse and neglect. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331. \n7.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  district  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  ยง  1391(b)(1)-(2) \nbecause the Defendant resides in the district and the events giving rise to this \nclaim occurred in the district.  \n8.  Plaintiff's federal claims are made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801-10827; \n42 U.S.C. ยงยง 15041-15045; 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.3   Filed 01/13/20   Page 3 of 10\n9.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง \n2201, 2202. \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff, MPAS, is a Michigan non-profit corporation. \n11.  The Governor of Michigan has designated MPAS as the state's protection \nand  advocacy  system,  pursuant  to  M.C.L.  ยง  330.1931(1),  with  the \nresponsibility  to  enforce  and  carry  out  the  federal  mandates  under  the \nPAIMI, DD and PAIR Acts. \n12.  As  the  state's  protection  and  advocacy  system,  MPAS  is  authorized  to \ninvestigate  allegations  of  abuse  and  neglect  of  persons  with  disabilities.  \nM.C.L. ยง 330.1931 (2). \n13.  Defendant, City of Lansing, is a City in Michigan and operates the City of \nLansing Police Department.  \nFACTS \n14.  A project was opened after MPAS requested psychiatric death notifications \nfrom  the  Michigan  Department  of  Licensing  and  Regulatory  Affairs \n(LARA). Those reports detail the deaths of psychiatric patients in Michigan \neither in the psychiatric units of hospitals or shortly after discharge from \npsychiatric units.  \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.4   Filed 01/13/20   Page 4 of 10\n15.  One of the death reports to LARA that MPAS received in response to the \nabove request came from Sparrow Hospital (Sparrow), located at 1210 W. \nSaginaw Street, Lansing, MI 48915.  \n16.  After review of the report, MPAS saw that Sparrow notified the Lansing \nPolice Department of the patientโs death, and that a โfull investigationโ was \nunderway.  \n17.  Sparrow  admitted  the  patient  to  the  psychiatric  unit  with  a  diagnosis  of \nSchizoaffective Disorder and Mixed Personality Traits. The patient received \ninpatient psychiatric treatment at Sparrow, which qualifies the patient as an \nโindividual with a mental illnessโ under 42 U.S.C. ยง 10802(4). \n18.  The report lists the cause of death as unknown.  \n19.  Sparrow staff found the patient in full rigor mortis and life saving measures \nwere not attempted.  \n20.  Based on the information received, MPAS determined it had probable cause \nto open an investigation into the allegations of possible neglect and/or abuse. \n21.  Beginning on or about October 29, 2019, MPAS has sent numerous requests \nto the Defendant via first class mail and e-mail.  \n22.  MPAS staff has followed up its correspondence with several telephone calls \nand emails to the City of Lansing Police Departmentโs records department.   \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.5   Filed 01/13/20   Page 5 of 10\n23.  MPAS staff has also followed up its correspondence with several telephone \ncalls and emails to the City of Lansing legal staff Mary Bowen.  \n24.  To aid in identifying the correct police report, MPAS staff provided Lansing \nPolice Department with the LARA death notification. \n25.  Despite  assertions  that  Lansing  Police  Department  was  working  on  the \nrequest, neither the City of Lansing nor the Lansing Police Department has \nproduced any of the records MPAS requested.  \n26.  In all communications with the City of Lansing, Lansing Police Department \nstaff and Mary Bowen, MPAS has clearly and consistently stated that the \nrequest is not a FOIA request, but an access request under federal law.  \n27.  From  the  first  request,  Plaintiff  MPAS  cited  the  federal  laws  that  grant \naccess to the requested documents. None of those federal laws are part of \nFOIA statutes.  \n28.  Despite this, the City of Lansing, Lansing Police Department staff and Mary \nBowen have insisted on treating the request as a FOIA request for public \ndocuments.  \n29.  Lansing  Police  Department  staff  Emily  Lensing  and  City  of  Lansing \nattorney  Mary  Bowen  made  clear  that  they  will  only  provide  redacted \nversions of the records MPAS requested, pursuant to FOIA and Lansing \nPolice Department practices.  \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.6   Filed 01/13/20   Page 6 of 10\n30.  MPAS has patiently waited over ten weeks for the records to be produced \nbut has not received them and now brings this action to enforce its rights \nunder the federal Protection and Advocacy Acts. \nCOUNT I - VIOLATION OF THE PAIMI ACT'S \nACCESS TO RECORDS PROVISION \n31.   Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 30 as though fully \nset forth herein. \n32.  MPAS, as Michigan's designated protection and advocacy system, has the \nright to access all records relating to individuals to which the PAIMI Act \napplies when conducting abuse and neglect investigations.  42 U.S.C. ยงยง \n10805(a)(4), 10806(b)(3)(A,B). \n33.  These  records  include  investigating  reports  prepared  by  agencies,  like \nLansing  PD,  charged  with  investigating  reports  of  incidents  of  abuse, \nneglect, and injury at medical facilities. 42 U.S.C. ยง 10806(3)(A).  \n34.  Defendant's failure to provide Plaintiff with the requested records relating to \nthe allegations of abuse and/or neglect of the alleged victim violates MPAS' \nrights under the PAIMI Act, 40 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801-10827. \n35.  Defendant's actions frustrate, impinge and prevent MPAS from meeting its \nresponsibilities  under  federal  and  state  law  to  investigate  allegations  of \nabuse and/or neglect of individuals with mental illness. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.7   Filed 01/13/20   Page 7 of 10\n36.  MPAS has no adequate remedy at law and, therefore, seeks injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief. \nCOUNT II - VIOLATION OF THE DD ACT'S \nACCESS TO RECORDS PROVISION \n37.   Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 36 as though fully \nset forth herein. \n38.  MPAS, as Michigan's designated protection and advocacy system, has the \nright to access all records relating to individuals to which the DD Act applies \nwhen conducting abuse and neglect investigations.  42 U.S.C. ยง 15043. \n39.  Defendant's failure to provide Plaintiff with the requested records relating to \nthe allegations of abuse and/or neglect of the alleged victim violates MPAS' \nrights under the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043. \n40.  Defendant's actions frustrate, impinge and prevent MPAS from meeting its \nresponsibilities  under  federal  and  state  law  to  investigate  allegations  of \nabuse and/or neglect of individuals with developmental disabilities. \n41.  MPAS has no adequate remedy at law and, therefore, seeks injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.8   Filed 01/13/20   Page 8 of 10\nCOUNT III - VIOLATION OF THE PAIR ACT'S \nACCESS TO RECORDS PROVISION \n42.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 41 as though fully \nset forth herein. \n43.  MPAS, as Michigan's designated protection and advocacy system, has the \nright to access all records relating to individuals to which the PAIR Act \napplies  when  conducting  abuse  and  neglect  investigations.    29  U.S.C.  ยง \n794e, and 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043. \n44.  Defendant's failure to provide Plaintiff with the requested records, relating to \nthe allegations of abuse and/or neglect of the alleged victim, violates MPAS' \nrights under the PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e. \n45.  Defendant's actions frustrate, impinge and prevent MPAS from meeting its \nresponsibilities  under  federal  and  state  law  to  monitor  facilities  and  to \nprevent abuse and/or neglect of individuals with mental illness. \n46.  MPAS has no adequate remedy at law and, therefore, seeks injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief. \nCOUNT IV โ VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n47.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 46 as though fully \nset forth herein. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.9   Filed 01/13/20   Page 9 of 10\n48.  The  Defendant,  the  City  of  Lansing,  through  Emily  Lensing,  a  Lansing \nPolice Department staff member, and Mary Bowen, Attorney for the City of \nLansing, acting under color of state law and pursuant to and in accordance \nwith Lansing Police Department Policy, refused to provide Plaintiff with the \nrequested records or to provide them in a timely manner.  \n49.  Defendantโs actions deprived Plaintiff of its federally protected rights to the \nrequested records under the PAIMI, DD, and PAIR Acts.  \n50.  MPAS seeks costs and reasonable attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1988.  \nREQUESTED RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests this Court: \nA.  Enter a declaratory judgment, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201, \ndeclaring  that  Defendant's  actions  and  failures  to  act  violate  the \nPAIMI, DD, and/or PAIR Acts by: \ni)  Denying Plaintiff access to records and information to which it \nis entitled to under federal law; and \nii)  Preventing MPAS from fully performing its statutory duty to \ninvestigate  incidents  of  suspected  abuse  and/or  neglect  of \npersons  with  disabilities,  in  violation of  PAIMI, DD,  and/or \nPAIR Acts. \n\nCase 1:20-cv-00030-PLM-SJB   ECF No. 1,  PageID.10   Filed 01/13/20   Page 10 of 10\n B.
