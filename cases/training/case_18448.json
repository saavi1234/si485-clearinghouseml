During the family’s first visit, Carowinds denied them access to at least twelve \nrides. On the family’s second visit, Carowinds denied them access to at least eight rides, and then \nlater in the day, increased the number of prohibited rides to at least twenty-eight. Mr. Aldridge \nreturned to Carowinds a third time and was again denied access to at least twenty-eight rides at \nCarowinds. Plaintiffs were denied access based on speculation, stereotypes, and generalizations \nabout their ability to safely enjoy different rides as individuals with lower leg amputations, and \nnot because of legitimate safety requirements. Defendants illegally discriminated against \nPlaintiffs based on their disability. Plaintiffs desire to return to Carowinds and to enjoy any rides \nwhich they are safely able to enjoy.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n1.  This action is brought under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 \n(“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189.    \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 1 of 11\n\n \n \n2.  Plaintiffs’ action for disability discrimination is authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 12188. \n3.  This Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal \nquestion) and 1343 (civil rights). \n4.  Declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 & 2202, 42 U.S.C. \n§12188(a), Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.     \n5.   Venue is proper because the actions and omissions of which Plaintiffs complain occurred \nin this district. See 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).    \nPARTIES \n6.  Grady Aldridge is a U.S. citizen and resident of Clover, South Carolina. \n7.  G.A. is a U.S. citizen, and resident of Clover, South Carolina. He is 5 years old; Renee \nAldridge is his mother and maintains this action on his behalf.  \n8.  M.A. is a U.S. citizen, and resident of Clover, South Carolina. She is 10 years old; Renee \nAldridge is her mother and maintains this action on her behalf.  \n9.  Mr. Aldridge, G.A., and M.A. were born without shin bones. Each has had both legs \namputated at the knee in a procedure known as a bilateral knee disarticulation.  \n10.  Plaintiffs are substantially limited in walking and are individuals with disabilities. \n11.  Plaintiffs use wheelchairs for assistance with mobility. Each is able to sit upright in a \nwheelchair without assistance from seat belts or other mechanical restraints.   \n12.  Mr. Aldridge possesses prosthetic legs, but no longer utilizes them for mobility.  \n13.  G.A. has prosthetic legs and frequently utilizes them for mobility.  \n14.  M.A. does not have prosthetics.  \n15.  Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, M.L.P. is a publicly-traded company based in Ohio \nthat owns the Carowinds amusement park.   \n2 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 2 of 11\n\n \n \n16.  Cedar Fair Southwest Inc. is a corporation formed in Delaware and registered with the \nNorth Carolina Secretary of State. Upon information and belief, it participates in the \noperation, management, and/or ownership of Carowinds.     \n17.  Carowinds LLC is an entity formed in Delaware and registered with the North Carolina \nSecretary of State. Upon information and belief, it participates in the operation, \nmanagement, and/or ownership of Carowinds. \n18.  The Carowinds amusement park is located in both Charlotte, North Carolina and Fort Mill, \nSouth Carolina.  \nFACTS \n19.  Carowinds is an amusement park offering more than fifty rides.   \n20.  In 2016, Mr. Aldridge and his wife purchased Carowinds season passes for themselves and \ntheir children, including M.A. and G.A.   \n21.  Plaintiffs paid the same price for their season passes that people without disabilities pay.  \nGuest Assistance Guide (“Guide”) \n22.  Carowinds publishes rider qualifications for its rides in the Guide.   \n23.  According to the 2016 Guide, Mr. Aldridge was allowed to ride fewer than half of the rides \noffered.  \n24.  Carowinds relies on height to determine a guest’s level of maturity and eligibility to ride \ncertain attractions. Depending on how Carowinds calculates the height of guests with \namputations, M.A. and G.A. are eligible to ride some or all of the rides Mr. Aldridge is \neligible to ride.   \n25.  Upon information and belief, Carowinds’ rider qualifications are not individualized to each \nride and include unnecessary qualifications.      \n3 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 3 of 11\n\n \n \n26.  For example, the rider qualifications for the Yo-Yo, a free-hanging swing ride, include a \nrequirement that riders have a minimum of three functioning extremities and the ability to \nbrace themselves.  \n27.  The Yo-Yo has riders sit in seats with their legs dangling. Riders hold on to the metal arms \nof the seat or the metal suspension cables, have their hands in the air, or on their laps; \nnotably absent is a solid surface against which riders could brace themselves.  \n28.  Charlie Brown’s Wind-up is a free-hanging swing ride for children that is very similar to \nthe Yo-Yo.  \n29.  The rider qualifications for Charlie Brown’s Wind-up also require that riders have a \nminimum of three functioning extremities and the ability to brace themselves despite the \nlack of solid surfaces against which a rider could brace themselves.      \n30.  On information and belief, other rides have unnecessary rider qualifications.     \n31.  Carowinds denied Plaintiffs access to rides based on what appear to be unnecessary rider \nqualifications because they are individuals with disabilities. \nRide Admission Policy Guest Form (“Rider Form”) \n32.  When people with disabilities enter Carowinds, they are directed to stop by guest services \nto obtain a Rider Form, a document that purports to establish which attractions the guest \nmeets the rider qualifications to ride.  \n33.  Plaintiffs visited Carowinds on June 4th and 8th, and Mr. Aldridge visited alone on June \n9th, 2016. Rider Forms were obtained during each visit.   \n34.  The Rider Forms were not consistent from visit to visit.  \n4 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 4 of 11\n\n \n \n35.  For example, on June 4th and the first part of June 8th, Plaintiffs were permitted to ride \nDrop Tower and Lucy’s Crabbie Cabbie. During the second half of June 8th and on June \n9th, Plaintiffs were excluded from these rides.    \n36.  It is unclear whether the Rider Forms are filled out based on the rider guidelines in the \nGuide or based on some other criteria.  \n37.  Carowinds excluded Plaintiffs from Drop Tower, Scrambler, Slingshot, Yo-Yo, Afterburn, \nCarolina Goldrusher, Fury 325, Hurler, Intimidator, Lucy’s Crabbie Cabbie, Woodstock \nExpress, and Woodstock Gliders when Plaintiff met the rider guidelines to ride these rides \naccording to the Guide.     \n38.  Carowinds denied Plaintiffs access to rides they are qualified to ride because they are \nindividuals with disabilities. \nPlaintiffs’ June 4th Carowinds Visit \n39.  The family’s first visit to Carowinds in 2016 was on June 4th. They were celebrating \nG.A.’s birthday and were accompanied by family friends.     \n40.  Upon entering Carowinds on June 4th, the family went to Guest Services to obtain Rider \nForms for Mr. Aldridge, M.A., and G.A.  \n41.  It took almost two hours for Carowinds to issue Rider Forms to Plaintiffs.  \n42.  Mr. Aldridge has visited Carowinds multiple times over many years, and has worked at \nCarowinds intermittently since he was a teenager. As of June 2016, he had ridden almost \nevery ride in the park except those currently known as Intimidator, Plants vs. Zombies, \nWindseeker, and Fury 325.  \n43.  It was G.A. and M.A.’s first trip to Carowinds.  \n5 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 5 of 11\n\n \n \n44.  Mr. Aldridge was surprised to see that the Rider Forms excluded Plaintiffs from rides he \nhad ridden before, but he did not address the issue because he and his family were anxious \nto start enjoying their day at Carowinds.  \n45.  The family chose Peanuts Pirates as their first ride. The Rider Forms indicated that \nPlaintiffs were eligible to ride Peanuts Pirates because each has “two functioning \narms…[and] a normal center of gravity and the lower extremities are sufficiently strong to \nmaintain proper riding posture under the dynamic conditions of the ride.”  \n46.  Ms. Aldridge, G.A., M.A., and another family member approached Peanuts Pirates, but \nwere told by Carowinds staff that it was not safe for G.A. and M.A. to ride Peanuts Pirates.     \n47.  A supervisor was called to the ride to resolve the discrepancy between the Rider Form and \nthe Carowinds staff’s assertion that M.A. and G.A. could not ride Peanuts Pirates.  \n48.  The supervisor told the ride operator that it was safe for M.A. and G.A. to ride Peanuts \nPirates, and assured Ms. Aldridge that she would speak with other ride staff to ensure they \nwould not experience any further situations such as this one.    \n49.  After completing the ride on Peanuts Pirates, Ms. Aldridge and G.A. next got on the \nCharacter Carousel. G.A. sat astride one of the horses with Ms. Aldridge’s assistance.  \n50.  Carowinds staff approached Ms. Aldridge and explained that G.A. could not ride in this \nmanner and asked them to exit the ride.  \n51.  Ms. Aldridge observed an infant nearby who was sitting astride a carousel horse with a \nwoman’s assistance and did not see any Carowinds staff approach this woman and ask her \nto move. She did not understand why G.A. was not permitted to ride astride one of the \nCarousel horses.     \n6 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 6 of 11\n\n \n \n52.  After their experiences at the Peanuts Pirates and Carousel rides, the Aldridges left \nCarowinds.  \nPlaintiffs’ June 8th Carowinds Visit  \n53.  The Aldridge family returned to Carowinds on June 8, 2016.  \n54.  They went to guest services and obtained their Rider Forms.  \n55.  The Rider Forms issued for Mr. Aldridge and M.A. were identical.  \n56.  For unknown reasons, Carowinds did not issue G.A. a separate Rider Form. Mr. Aldridge \nwas told at one point by Carowinds staff that they did not need separate Rider Forms for \neach family member. \n57.  The Rider Forms permitted Plaintiffs to ride a greater number of rides than Plaintiffs were \npermitted to ride under the Rider Forms issued on June 4th.  \n58.  The June 8th Rider Forms also excluded Plaintiffs from rides they were previously \npermitted to ride on June 4th, such as Woodstock Gliders.    \n59.  The family selected Rip Roarin’ Rapids as their first ride because it is located near guest \nservices. The Rider Forms did not indicate any restrictions on Plaintiffs enjoying the ride.   \n60.  Mr. Aldridge has ridden Rip Roarin’ Rapids in the past, with and without his prosthetics.    \n61.  Shortly after checking in with the ride attendant, Mr. Aldridge and his family were directed \nto the accessible entrance.  \n62.  The accessible route to Rip Roarin’ Rapids leads to a side door, through which is the \naccessible boarding area. Once through the door, guests are in a dock area where riders \ndisembark from the ride. Riders with disabilities board the ride at this point and travel with \nthe ride to the general boarding area where riders without disabilities then board the ride.    \n7 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 7 of 11\n\n \n \n63.  When the Aldridges entered the accessible boarding area, the ride operators began to argue \naudibly about whether Plaintiffs should be permitted to ride. One operator said they should \nfollow the Rider Form permitting the Plaintiffs to ride, the other said that the Plaintiffs did \nnot meet the criteria for the ride notwithstanding the Rider Form.  \n64.  One of the ride operators called for security. A supervisor was also called over. The \nsupervisor admonished the ride operator for calling security as there had been no threats of \nviolence or other reason for their presence. \n65.  The conversation between the ride operator, the supervisor, and the Aldridge family took \nplace in the accessible boarding area of Rip Roarin’ Ride Rapids, within earshot and in full \nview of other park guests.  \n66.  Ultimately, Plaintiffs were told they could not ride Rip Roarin’ Rapids. The remaining \nfamily members elected not to ride Rip Roarin’ Rapids without Plaintiffs.    \n67.  Carowinds issued new Rider Forms for Plaintiffs as they prepared to leave Rip Roarin’ \nRapids. By this time, it had been about two hours since the Aldridges tried to board Rip \nRoarin’ Rapids.   \n68.  The second set of Rider Forms issued on June 8th was radically different from the first set. \nWhereas Plaintiffs were permitted to ride thirty rides when they entered the park, now they \ncould only ride ten.   \n69.  The second set of Rider Forms issued on June 8th were also radically different from the \nones issued on June 4, 2016.  \n70.  On June 4th, Plaintiffs were allowed to ride all but one of the rides in Planet Snoopy (the \nchildren’s section of Carowinds); on June 8th, Plaintiffs were only permitted to ride four of \nthe thirteen Planet Snoopy rides.  \n8 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 8 of 11\n\n \n \n71.  It is unclear what criteria Carowinds staff relied upon in creating either set of Rider Forms \nissued to Plaintiffs on June 8th.        \nMr. Aldridge’s June 9th Carowinds Visit \n72.  On June 9, 2016, Mr. Aldridge entered Carowinds on his own. His goal was to get \nclarification about the rides Plaintiffs would be permitted to ride.  \n73.  He was issued a Rider Form prohibiting him from riding all but ten rides; it appeared \nidentical to the second Rider Form from the day before (June 8th).    \n74.  Among the rides Mr. Aldridge was excluded from on June 9th were ride Afterburn, \nIntimidator, and Fury 325.    \n75.  The Guide states that guests with amputations at the knee meet the rider qualifications to \nride Afterburn, Intimidator, and Fury 325 if they are using a separate three-point harness.   \n76.  Mr. Aldridge asked why he was not permitted to ride the Afterburn, Intimidator, and Fury \n325 using a chest harness as a reasonable modification of the ride restraint system; he was \ntold it was because he did not have knees.  \n77.  Mr. Aldridge advised Carowinds staff that his amputation is at the knee, but to no avail.   \n78.  Upon information and belief, Carowinds does not rely on appropriate standards or criteria \nfor assessing whether an individual with a disability can safely enjoy its rides.  \n79.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs have been excluded from other rides they would be \neligible to enjoy but for Defendants’ refusal to make reasonable modifications to the rides.  \n2017 Guest Assistance Guide (“2017Guide”) \n80.  Upon information and belief, the 2017 Guide did not meaningfully alter ride guidelines.  \n81.  The primary changes reflected in the 2017 Guide appear to be the addition of ride \nguidelines for four newly opened attractions in the “County Fair” section of the park, \n9 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 9 of 11\n\n \n \nincluding the Electro-Spin, the Zephyr, the Rock N Roller, and the Do-Si-Do. It also \nreflects the renaming of the Carolina Cobra as the Flying Cobras.  \n82.  Plaintiffs would like to return to Carowinds and enjoy access to all rides they can safely \nenjoy.  \nCLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act) \n \n83.  Plaintiffs adopt and restate the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 – 82. \n84.  Defendants own and operate a place of public accommodation.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n12181(7)(I).     \n85.  Title III of the ADA prohibits amusement parks from discriminating on the basis of \ndisability. 42 U.S.C. § 12182. \n86.  Prohibited discrimination includes denying individuals with disabilities equal access to \namusement park rides unless doing so poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. \nSee 42 U.S.C. §12182(b)(1)(A)(i) & (b)(3). \n87.  Amusement parks cannot impose unnecessary eligibility criteria to deny individuals with \ndisabilities the opportunity to ride amusement park rides. See 42 U.S.C. § \n12182(b)(2)(A)(i).     \n88.  Amusement parks cannot deny individuals with disabilities equal access to amusement \npark rides by refusing to make reasonable modifications that would permit them to ride \namusement park rides. See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).     \n89.  Plaintiffs are individuals with disabilities who are substantially limited in the major life \nactivity of walking.  \n90.  Defendants’ exclusion of Plaintiffs from rides they met the published rider qualifications to \nenjoy discriminated against Plaintiffs based on disability. \n10 \nCase 3:17-cv-00708-FDW-DSC   Document 1   Filed 12/06/17   Page 10 of 11\n\n \n \n91.  Upon information and belief, Carowinds’ rider guidelines do not correspond to the \nphysical requirements of each particular ride; Defendants’ reliance on unnecessary \neligibility criteria to exclude Plaintiffs from rides discriminated against them based on \ndisability.    \n92.  Defendants discriminated against Plaintiffs by failing to make reasonable modifications \nthat would permit Plaintiffs equal access to additional rides.    \n93.  Defendants denied Plaintiffs equal access to Carowinds rides based on their disability. \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant the following relief: \n1.  Declare that Defendants’ actions, policies, procedures and practices as alleged herein \nviolated the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n2.  Enjoin Defendants’ continuing violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n3.  Award Plaintiffs the costs of this action and reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 12205. \n4.
