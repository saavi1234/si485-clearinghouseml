    "summary": "<p>This case is about a Protection and Advocacy (P&amp;A) Agency&rsquo;s access authority, specifically relating to: 1) confidentially laws such as the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and 2) the grounds necessary for a probable cause determination. On August 18, 2017, Charlotte Mecklenburg Board of Education (CMBOE) filed a complaint for declaratory judgement in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against Disability Rights North Carolina (DRNC). CMBOE challenged DRNC&rsquo;s assertion of its authority to access contact directory records for every student at the CMBOE-operated Metro School based on probable cause of abuse and neglect under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance [CB1] and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act). On August 23, 2017, DRNC filed a separate action against CMBOE, seeking declaratory judgment that CMBOE&rsquo;s refusal violates the DD Act and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (PAIR Act), as well as injunctive relief requiring CMBOE to provide the requested information. This action was consolidated with CMBOE&rsquo;s action. Judge Robert J. Conrad, Jr. presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit began when DRNC received complaints about Metro School and determined it had probable cause that students were being subjected to abuse or neglect. DRNC requested that CMBOE provide records and information, including contact information for the parents or guardians of all students. CMBOE declined the request. CMBOE then filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that 1) FERPA prohibits CMBOE from providing DRNC the contact directory information, and 2) DRNC does not have a sufficient basis for its determination of probable cause. DRNC filed a lawsuit alleging that CMBOE violated the DD Act by refusing to provide the records requested, and the two suits were consolidated. Regarding the FERPA claim, DRNC argued that CMBOE suffered no an actual or imminent injury based on the request for information. Moreover, DRNC maintained that CMBOE suffered no injury from DRNC&rsquo;s refusal to provide the basis for its probable cause because CMBOE is not entitled to that information. Second, DRNC alleged that CMBOE&rsquo;s request for declaratory relief does not serve the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act because there is no justiciable controversy. On August 15, 2018, the Court denied DRNC&rsquo;s motion to dismiss.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In discovery, CMBOE then requested information from DRNC, including the number of complaints and the date DRNC received the complaints, the identity of any person, excluding clients, who has knowledge regarding the received complaint, the facts underlying DRNC&rsquo;s basis for its probable cause determination, and any DRNC records about an individual reporting an allegation of abuse or neglect. On January 29, 2019, DRNC filed a Motion for Protective Order. Here, DRNC argued that CMBOE seeks to achieve, through discovery, the same remedy it would obtain if it were successful in the present action and that the information requested is irrelevant to CMBOE&rsquo;s claims. DRNC further maintained that the lawsuit asked the Court to determine who is the final arbiter of probable cause, a question of statutory interpretation, so the underlying facts of the probable cause determination are immaterial, and therefore not discoverable. Finally, DRNC argued that CMBOE seeks information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege, protected as attorney work protect, and/or prohibited from disclosure by the DD and PAIR acts. The Court granted DRNC&rsquo;s motion for a protective order on March 19, 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On December 31, 2019, the Court ruled that 1) FERPA does not prohibit CMBOE from providing DRNC the parent contact information for all Metro students, and 2) DRNC failed to provide a sufficient factual basis to support its probable cause determination as to all Metro students. Therefore, the Court granted CMBOE&rsquo;s motion for summary judgment on the probable cause claim, as the basis DRNC communicated to support its probable cause determination was insufficient, and DRNC failed to come forward with any supportive evidence. &nbsp;The case remains closed.</p>",

The records \nto which DRNC is entitled access include the names and contact information for the parent or \nguardian of an individual โabout whom a complaint has been received by the [P&A] system or, as \na result of monitoring or other activities, the system has determined that there is probable cause to \nbelieve that the individualโฆ has been subject to abuse or neglect.โ 45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.25(a)(3). \nDRNC seeks to access the names and contact information of parents/guardians of students who \nattend CMBOEโs Metro School, as it has received one or more complaints and determined that \nthere is probable cause to believe the students have been subject to abuse or neglect. CMBOE has \ndeclined to provide the requested information, citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy \nAct (โFERPAโ) and its assertion that DRNC lacks a complaint and/or probable cause to assert its \naccess authority. Both CMBOE and DRNC asked this Court to interpret the DD and PAIR Acts to \ndetermine, as between the parties, who is the final arbiter of probable cause; in other words, \nwhether DRNC is required to provide CMBOE with any information regarding the basis for its \n  2 \n\nassertion that it has received one or more complaints and/or its probable cause determination. \n  On October 29, 2018, CMBOE sent by email Plaintiffโs First Combined Requests. On \nNovember 29, 2018, DRNC submitted its Response to Plaintiffโs First Combined Requests. DRNC \nobjected to a number of the Requests, as CMBOE sought information that is protected under the \nattorney-client privilege, the confidentiality protections of the DD and PAIR Acts (hereinafter โthe \nP&A privilegeโ) and/or the work product doctrine. On January 18, 2019, CMBOE sent by email a \nrequest for supplemental discovery, seeking the information DRNC declined to provide in its \nResponse. The parties conferred by phone on January 28, 2019. The parties determined that they \nwere unable to resolve the dispute as to the outstanding requests. The information sought is: \nโข  The number of complaints, and the date(s) on which DRNC received, one or more \ncomplaints regarding the alleged improper use of assistive technology devices at Metro \nSchool;  \nโข  The identity of any person, excluding clients, who has knowledge regarding the received \ncomplaint(s) or the records CMBOE provided in response to DRNCโs request of June 7, \n2017;  \nโข  The facts underlying DRNCโs basis for its determination that probable cause exists to \nbelieve abuse or neglect has occurred; and \nโข  DRNC records, including electronic files from and about an individual(s) reporting an \nallegation of abuse or neglect; notes and files of non-attorney advocates working under the \nsupervision of an attorney; and waivers or release forms obtained as part of DRNCโs \ninvestigation. \nARGUMENT \nA protective order is available to a party for good cause shown, and the Court may order, \namong other things, that the discovery will not be had, that the discovery will be available only on \n  3 \n\nspecified terms, that the discovery may only be had by a different method of discovery other than \nthe one sought, or that the scope will be limited. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). The Court has discretion in \nruling on a Motion for Protective Order. M&M Medical Supplies and Serv. Inc. v. Pleasant Valley \nHospital, Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 163 (4th Cir. 1992). \n  DRNC seeks a protective order because the discovery sought by CMBOE would require \ndisclosure of the same information CMBOE seeks as the remedy in the present matter โ \ninformation that relates to one or more complaints received by or probable cause determination \nmade by DRNC. DRNC also seeks a protective order because the discovery sought by CMBOE is \nirrelevant to the resolution of the subject matter of the inquiry. Finally, the discovery sought is \nprotected by the attorney-client privilege, and/or the P&A privilege, and/or the work product \ndoctrine.  \nI.  CMBOEโs Discovery Requests Seek the Same Information Sought Through the Present \nAction \nCMBOE initiated this action to seek the Courtโs interpretation of the standard and process \nthrough which DRNC can assert its access authority after making a probable cause determination. \n(Pl. Am. Comp. ยถ 54.) CMBOE posits that DRNC is required to provide CMBOE with the facts \nunderlying one or more complaints and/or its probable cause determination, thereby permitting \nCMBOE to assess the sufficiency of DRNCโs assertion for itself. (Pl. Am. Comp. ยถ 43.) \nConversely, DRNC asserts that the DD and PAIR Acts require it only notify CMBOE that it has \nreceived a complaint and/or made a probable cause determination, and prohibit DRNC from \nproviding CMBOE any information regarding the complaint or the basis for its determination. \n(Def. Comp. ยถ 24, 27.)  CMBOEโs discovery requests seeking the facts underlying any \ncomplaint(s) and/or DRNCโs probable cause determination is an attempt to obtain the relief it \nrequests of this Court prior to resolution of the legal issue at the core of this litigation. To permit \n  4 \n\nCMBOE to obtain information now that the Court may subsequently rule it is not entitled to \nreceive at all would leave DRNC without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights. \nThe present matter is analogous to cases challenging a government bodyโs refusal to \nprovide records it asserts are exempt from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. In many \nsuch cases, the plaintiff seeks to obtain, through discovery, the document that the government \nalleges is exempt from the FOIA request. Courts have repeatedly held that where discovery would \nessentially grant the plaintiff the substantive relief it requests, i.e. disclosure of a document that the \ngovernment claims is exempt, the plaintiff is not entitled to discovery of such documents. For \nexample, in Local 3, Intโl Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. NLRB, a labor union filed numerous petitions \nin support of its effort to become a certified bargaining agent for construction contractors in the \nNew York area. 845 F.2d 1177, 1178-1179 (2d Cir. 1988). The National Labor Relations Board \n(NLRB) dismissed the petitions without hearing; the union filed a FOIA request seeking records \nregarding NLRBโs decision. Id. at 1179. NLRB declined to provide the records, claiming they \nwere exempt from FOIA. Id. The union filed a lawsuit seeking to compel production of the \ndocuments under FOIA; the district court denied the unionโs motion. Id. On appeal, the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit held that in an action to determine whether a party has the right \nto receive agency documents, and discovery โwould essential grant [the party] the substantive \nrelief if requests,โ i.e. disclosure of documents the agency claims are exempt from disclosure, the \nparty โis not entitle to discovery of documents claimed to be exempt.โ Id.; see also Hill v. Exec. \nOffice for United States Attys., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187968 (W.D. Va. 2017); Pollard v. FBI, \n705 F.2d 1151 (9th Cir. 1983). This Court should similarly hold that where, as here, the plaintiff \nseeks to obtain information through discovery that the P&A alleges is exempt from disclosure, the \nplaintiff is not entitled to recover such information through discovery.  \n \n  5 \n\nII. The Information CMBOE Seeks is Irrelevant to Its Claims and Defenses and Therefore \nOutside the Scope of Discovery \nRule 26(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly limits the scope of discovery \nto โany nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any partyโs claim or defense and proportional to the \nneeds of the case.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Where the Court is presented solely with an issue of \nstatutory interpretation, and the underlying facts are immaterial to such interpretation, the facts are \nirrelevant and therefore not discoverable.  \nAt its core, this litigation asks the Court to determine who is the final arbiter of probable \ncause as between the P&A (DRNC) and the service provider (CMBOE).1 This is solely a matter of \nstatutory interpretation; the number or substance of any complaint(s) received by DRNC, and/or \nthe facts and deliberations underlying its probable cause determination, are irrelevant to that \ninterpretation.2 Therefore, CMBOE is not entitled to discover the information it seeks. \nIII. CMBOE Seeks to Discover Information that is Privileged and/or Protected Work \nProduct. \na.  Some Facts Underlying DRNCโs Basis for its Probable Cause Determination are \nAttorney-Client Communications and Thus are Privileged. \nWhen a party holds information that is otherwise discoverable by asserting a claim of \nprivilege, the party must expressly state the claim and describe the nature of communications not \ndisclosed in a manner that enables the other party to assess the claim without revealing the \nprivileged information. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5).  \n                                                           \n1 The Court is also asked to interpret the relationship between the DD and PAIR Acts and FERPA. This is clearly \nsettled law, resolved in favor of the P&A system. Any factual basis underlying DRNCโs request for parent/guardian \nnames and contact information is irrelevant to the interpretation sought and is therefore not addressed further in this \nmemorandum.  \n2 While it is within the Courtโs discretion to review the sufficiency of DRNCโs basis for determining probable cause, \nthe Court is not required to do so in order to resolve ultimate issue regarding who the final arbiter of probable cause is \nas between the P&A and a service provider.  \n  6 \n\nIn Plaintiffโs First Combined Request, CMBOE sought to obtain details of any \ncomplaint(s) DRNC received regarding the alleged improper use of assistive technology devices at \nMetro School, include โthe nature of those complaints,โ the dates of each, and โwho made those \ncomplaints.โ Plaintiffโs First Combined Request No. 3. In its Response, DRNC asserted that to the \nany complaint DRNC received pursuant to a confidential communication with a client(s), such \ninformation is subject to the attorney-client privilege and therefore would not be provided to \nCMBOE. Similarly, any communication from an individual to a DRNC attorney or a non-attorney \nadvocate working under the supervision of a DRNC attorney, made for the purpose of obtaining a \nlegal opinion or legal services, constitutes a communication from a client and is also privileged, \nand therefore not discoverable.  \nb.  Any Non-Privileged Complaints or Factual Information Used in DRNCโs Probable \nCause Determination are Protected as Attorney Work Product. \nCMBOE seeks discovery of โall documents that summarize, memorialize or detail the \nobservations made by DRNC during visits at Metro Schoolโ and/or the nature of any complaint(s) \nit received. (Plaintiffโs First Combined Request No. 2 and No. 3.) In its Response, DRNC \nexplained that such documentation, including a memorandum that details DRNCโs basis for its \nprobable cause determination, constitutes the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions and/or \nlegal theories of a DRNC attorney(s) and is therefore attorney work product. In its request for \nsupplemental responses, CMBOE again seeks the facts underlying DRNCโs basis for its probable \ncause determination, alleging that such facts are not privileged and therefore discoverable. \nTo the extent that factual information was obtained from communications with non-client \nparties, DRNC concedes that the information is not privileged. However, such information is \ninextricably entwined in DRNCโs determination regarding probable cause. In the P&A context, \nโprobable causeโ means a reasonable ground for the belief that an individual has been, or may be, \n  7 \n\nsubject to abuse or neglect. 45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.19. Determining whether probable cause exists \nnecessarily entails drawing conclusions and forming opinions about any complaints the P&A has \nreceived and/or observations of P&A staff, as well as drawing reasonable inferences from the \nexperience and training of those staff. It is DRNCโs policy and practice to have an attorney(s) \nconduct or participate in making any probable cause determination, and in drafting a memorandum \noutlining the basis for probable cause where the attorney(s) anticipate there may be litigation. \nDRNC adhered to that policy and practice in this case; the probable cause determination was made \nby a DRNC attorney(s), and memorandum drafted by such attorney(s) after CMBOE first declined \nto provide the requested guardian names and contact information and indicated that it would seek \ncourt resolution if necessary. The information regarding alleged abuse or neglect provided to \nDRNC is indivisible from the conclusions, opinions and inferences drawn by DRNC, and \nCMBOEโs request for such information constitutes a request that DRNC reveal its attorneyโs \ninterpretation of the information, i.e. its attorneyโs work product. \nMaterials that are not normally discoverable, such as work product, can be subject to \ndiscovery where the party requesting them demonstrates โit has substantial need for the materials \nto prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other \nmeans.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A)(ii). As previously discussed, CMBOE does not have a \nsubstantial need for the materials it seeks, as the factual basis for DRNCโs probable cause \ndetermination are irrelevant to the central issue of who determines the existence of probable cause \nas between CMBOE and DRNC. Therefore, the court should prohibit the discovery of the \ninformation protected by the work product doctrine. \n \n \n \n  8 \n\nc.  The DD and PAIR Acts Prohibit DRNC From Disclosing Information Regarding Any \nComplaint and its Probable Cause Determination, Including the Identity of Any \nPerson Who Has Knowledge of Such Information. \nThe DD and PAIR Acts proscribe the P&A from disclosing a wide range of information. \nThe P&A is obligated to  \nkeep confidential all records and information, including information contained in \nany automated electronic database pertaining to clientsโฆ the identity of individuals \nwho report incidents of abuse or neglect, or who furnish information that forms the \nbasis for a determination that probable cause exists; and names of individuals who \nhave received services, supports or other assistance, and who provided information \nto the P&A for the record.  \n \n45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.28(b)(1). Regarding โindividuals who provided information to the P&A for the \nrecordโ or who furnish information that forms the basis for a probable cause determination, the \nDD and PAIR Acts make no distinction between individuals employed by the P&A and \nindividuals outside of its employ. Further, โrecords maintained by the P&A system are the \nproperty of the P&A system which must protect them from loss, damage, tampering, [or] \nunauthorized use.โ ยง 1326.28(b). \nAll of the information CMBOE seeks through discovery is information that is protected \nunder this privilege. The number of complaints received and the date(s) on which such complaints \nwere received is information that is part of a probable cause determination. The identity of any \nperson who has provided information to DRNC, whether employed by the organization or not, is \nconfidential. A DRNC employee who observed conditions at Metro School, reviewed documents, \nor spoke with an individual making a complaint, is a person who provided information to the P&A \nfor the record. And all DRNC records are similarly confidential pursuant to the P&A privilege. \nTherefore, the provision of such documents and information cannot be compelled through \ndiscovery.  \n  9 \n\n  At least one court has held that the P&A privilege is a bar to discovery. In Disability Law \nCtr. of Alaska, Inc. v. N. Star Behavioral Health Sys., the P&A sought to obtain peer review \nrecords from a service provider. When the provider refused to deliver the records, the P&A filed \nan action for declaratory judgment establishing that it is entitled access to the requested records. \n2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16403, 2008 WL 616054 at *2-3 (D. Alaska 2008). The service provider \nsought, through discovery, to obtain notes regarding interviews with individuals reporting \ncomplaints of abuse or neglect, a memorandum regarding the interview, and correspondence from \nthe P&A to the complainants and to a state licensing and certification agency. Id. at *5. The court \ndenied the service providerโs request to compel discovery of the documents it sought, finding that \nthe P&A privilege and confidentiality provisions required the P&A to keep โall records and \ninformation,โ including the requested documents, confidential. Id. at *12. \nAlthough the Alaska P&A sought access to records pursuant to the Protection and \nAdvocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (โthe PAIMI Actโ), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801 et seq., \nnot the DD and PAIR Acts, the relevant confidentiality provisions of the DD and PAIMI Acts are \nidentical. Both the DD and PAIMI Acts require that the P&A maintain the confidentiality of โall \nrecords and information.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 10806(a); 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.45; 45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.28(b)(1). \nThis confidentiality requirement compelled the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska to \nprohibit discovery of information and records in the possession of the P&A; this court should \nsimilarly prohibit CMBOE from seeking discovery of information and records in the possession of \nDRNC. \nConclusion \n  For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that the Court grant its Motion \nfor Protective Order. \n \n  10 \n\nRespectfully submitted, this the 29th day of January, 2019. \n/s/ Kristine L.

This Memorandum supersedes and \nsupplants Defendantโs original Memorandum. \nINTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (โCMBOEโ), brought this action \nfor declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201. Defendant, \nDisability Rights North Carolina (โDRNCโ), is the Protection and Advocacy system (โP&Aโ) \ndesignated by the Governor of the State of North Carolina to provide protection and advocacy \nservices to individuals with disabilities. As the P&A, DRNC has the responsibility and authority \nto investigate allegations of abuse and/or neglect of individuals with disabilities. By this action, \nPlaintiff seeks to prevent DRNC from carrying out such an investigation at the Metro School, a \n \n \n\n \n \nschool that serves only students with disabilities, located in Charlotte, NC and operated by \nPlaintiff. \n  DRNC received complaints regarding abuse and/or neglect of students at the Metro \nSchool. DRNC initiated monitoring activities at Metro School, during which time DRNC staff \nobserved circumstances and received information that led DRNC to determine that it had \nprobable cause, as that term is defined in the federal statutes and regulations governing the P&A, \nto believe that students at Metro School were being subjected to abuse and/or neglect, thus \nmeriting further investigation. On August 3, 2017, in furtherance of such investigation, DRNC \nrequested in writing that Plaintiff provide it with the names and contact information of the \nparents and guardians of each student attending Metro School, so that written releases might be \nobtained, thus permitting DRNC to review student records as deemed necessary for the \ninvestigation. (Amend. Compl. ยถยถ 22-23). In this request, DRNC notified Plaintiff that โ[i]f the \nrequest for information is denied, Disability Rights NC will be forced to seek a court order \nresolving this matter.โ (Amend. Compl. Exhibit 4). On August 9, 2017, counsel for Plaintiff \nnotified DRNC of its decision to deny DRNCโs request for parent and guardian names and \ncontact information. (Amend. Compl. ยถ 26). At that time, Plaintiff invited DRNC to provide \nfurther information regarding the basis for its probable cause determination. (Amend. Compl. \nExhibit 5). On August 14, 2017, DRNC provided its response to Plaintiff regarding its authority \nto obtain the names and contact information requested โ i.e. its receipt of complaints and \ndetermination of probable cause โ and clarifying that Plaintiff is not entitled to a detailed \nrecitation of DRNCโs basis for its probable cause determination, as such a determination is the \nsole province of the P&A system. DRNC requested a response by August 16, 2017, and \n2 \n \n\n \n \nindicated that if the matter was not resolved by that date, DRNC would be โprepared to proceed \nas necessary at that time.โ (Amend. Compl. Exhibit 6). \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nRather than respond directly to DRNCโs August 14, 2017 letter, Plaintiff instead filed the \npresent action for declaratory judgment. Specifically, Plaintiff seeks โthe Courtโs interpretation \nof the Developmental Disabilities Act (DDA) and Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights \n(PAIR), as those statutes relate to FERPA [the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act], and \nwhether CMBOE is required to release the information demanded by Defendant.โ (Amend. \nCompl. ยถ 35) (hereinafter referred to as โPlaintiffโs FERPA claimโ). Plaintiff further โrequests \nthe Court clarify what determines the standard for probable cause when Protection and Advocacy \nagencies seek access to all studentsโ PPI [Personally Identifiable Information], and whether, \nbased on the standard provided by Defendant, CMBOE is required to release the requested \ninformation.โ (Amend. Compl. ยถ 54) (hereinafter referred to as โPlaintiffโs probable cause \nclaimโ). \nPlaintiff served the original complaint on DRNC by registered mail, and did not \notherwise notify DRNC of its actions.  In the meantime, on August 23, 2017, DRNC initiated a \nseparate action in this Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Disability Rights North \nCarolina v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education, Civil Action No. 3:17-cv-\n00511. A copy of the file-stamped complaint is attached and incorporated as Exhibit A. DRNC \nprovided counsel for Plaintiff with a courtesy copy of its complaint by email that same day. A \ncopy of the referenced email is attached and incorporated as Exhibit B. DRNC learned of the \npresent matter when Plaintiff provided a copy of the complaint and summons, by email, on \nAugust 24, 2017. A copy of the referenced email is attached and incorporated as Exhibit C. \n3 \n \n\n \n \nDefendant filed its original Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and Motion \nto Dismiss pursuant to the discretion granted to the Court by the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nOn September 28, 2017, Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint.  Defendant has filed \nthe accompanying Renewed Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and \nRenewed Motion to Dismiss pursuant to the discretion granted to the court by the Declaratory \nJudgment Act. \nFIRST ARGUMENT: LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \nPlaintiff has not established that it has standing, and therefore the Court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction over this matter. \nI.  Standard of Review: Rule 12(b)(1) \nWhere there is a question of subject matter jurisdiction, the court โmay weigh the \nevidence in determining whether the facts support the jurisdictional allegations.โ Lovern v. \nEdwards, 190 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 1999).  The court must โregard the pleadingsโ allegations \nas mere evidence on the issue, and may consider evidence outside the pleadings.โ Richmond, \nFredericksburg & Potomac R. Co. v. United States, 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir. 1991). \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution limits federal jurisdiction to live โcasesโ and \nโcontroversies.โ  U.S. Const., art. III, ยง 2.  A crucial aspect of this case-or-controversy \nrequirement is standing, and the plaintiff, seeking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of \nestablishing standing. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). To establish it has \nstanding, Plaintiff CMBOE must allege (1) it has suffered an actual or imminent, concrete and \nparticularized injury, (2) that is fairly traceable to an action by Defendant DRNC that it is \nchallenging, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by the declaratory relief requested. Krebs v. \nCharlotte Sch. of Law, LLC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143060, *30 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 5, \n4 \n \n\n \n \n2017)(citing Lujan at 561). โWhere a plaintiff does not establish each of the elements of \nstanding, a court must dismiss that claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. (citing Valley \nForce Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 475-\n76 (1982)). Any decision by the court where the case-or-controversy requirement is not met \nโwould be an improper advisory opinion on an abstract question.โ Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pacific \nCo., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941). \nII. The FERPA claim \nPlaintiff has not demonstrated that it has suffered an actual or imminent injury based on \nDRNCโs request for information that, according to Plaintiff, is protected by FERPA.1 Plaintiff \nhas affirmatively stated that it will not produce the information requested by DRNC. The only \nrecourse available to DRNC is the action it has taken, i.e. to file a civil action for declaratory and \n                                                            \n1 For the sake of argument in this Memorandum only, we will assume that FERPA applies to the \ninformation requested, and DRNC explicitly reserves the right to challenge this assertion in further \nproceedings. However, Plaintiffโs application of FERPA to the names and contact information of the \nparents/guardians of students is erroneous. FERPA defines information such as the name, address and \ntelephone number of a student as โdirectory information.โ 20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(a)(5)(A). The regulations \nexpressly permit general disclosure of directory information. 34 C.F.R. ยง 99.31(a)(3)(ii)(9)(i). Several \ncourts have applied this provision to permit the P&A to obtain such directory information. For example, \nin Disability Law Ctr. of Alaska, Inc. v. Anchorage Sch. Dist., 581 F.3d 936 (9th Cir. 2009), the court \nreferenced amicus briefs filed by the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services in a similar case before the Second Circuit. The Ninth Circuit adopted the agenciesโ \ninterpretation of the DD Act and FERPA.  \n \nThe agencies stated that โif a school or other facility could refuse to \nprovide the name and contact information, it could interfere substantially \nwith P&Aโs investigation of abuse or neglect, thereby thwarting Congressโ \nintent that P&As act to protect vulnerable populations from abuse or \nneglect.โ Furthermore, the agencies found โno indication that Congress \nbelieved that the carefully tailored access rights required under [the DD \nAct]  would  be  subordinate  to  the  general  privacy  requirements  of \nFERPA.โ Rather, โpermitting access as provided for underโฆ the DD Act \nis generally consisted with Congressโ intent relating to student privacy.โ  \n \nId. at 940 (citing Conn. Office of Prot. & Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Hartford Bd. Of \nEduc., 464 F.3d 229, 236 (2nd Cir. 2006)).  \n5 \n \n\n \n \ninjunctive relief requiring CMBOE to produce the requested information. There is no civil or \ncriminal sanction for failure to produce the information. DRNCโs written indication of its intent \nto initiate a civil action regarding this matter may not be used to demonstrate injury to Plaintiff, \nas the threat of a lawsuit is not sufficient to establish actual or imminent injury. See Klingspor \nAbrasives, Inc. v. Woolsey, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66747, *7, 2009 WL 2397088 (W.D.N.C. \n2009). \nIn its Amended Complaint, Plaintiff posits that by providing the requested information to \nDRNC, Plaintiff โwould breach the rights of the students under its protection and violate federal \nlaw which can lead to the loss of federal funds required for the delivery of essential educational \nservices.โ (Amend. Compl. ยถ 34). Neither of these alleged possible injuries are sufficient to \nestablish an actual or imminent injury, however. Plaintiff is currently in possession of the \ninformation sought by DRNC. The potential for injury, i.e. that Plaintiff would violate federal \nlaw and thus lose federal funding, is entirely speculative and will not come to pass through any \naction on the part of DRNC. Plaintiff controls whether it will suffer this alleged harm by \ndisclosing the information in question. Having clearly indicated it will not release the requested \ninformation in the absence of a court order, Plaintiff cannot simultaneously allege that the \ntenuous possibility that it will produce the information and thereby violate federal law, at which \npoint the federal government may or may not terminate its provision of certain monies to \nPlaintiff, constitutes a โconcrete and particularized injury.โ Moreover, production of the \ninformation would not violate federal law. FERPA permits the general disclosure of โdirectory \ninformation,โ and specifically permits the disclosure of any student information where such \ndisclosure โis to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena.โ 34 C.F.R. ยง \n99.31(a)(3)(ii)(9)(i) โ (11). See Arista Records LLC v. Doe, 551 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. \n6 \n \n\n \n \n2008)(holding that, because the court authorized various record companies to serve a subpoena \non George Washington University seeking directory information for students the companies \nalleged infringed their copyrighted recordings by using an online file-sharing system, such \ndisclosure was permitted by FERPA); Warner Bros. Records Inc., et al. v. Does 1-6, 527 F. \nSupp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2007)(holding that Georgetown Universityโs disclosure of information in \nresponse to plaintiffโs subpoena complied with FERPA). \nAs Plaintiff has not alleged it has suffered an actual or imminent, concrete and \nparticularized injury, and therefore has failed to make the requisite showing that it has standing, \nthe Amended Complaint must be dismissed as to the FERPA claim.    \nIII.  The probable cause claim \nIn its Complaint, Plaintiff suggests, though does not explicitly state, that DRNCโs refusal \nto provide the basis for its probable cause determination prevents Plaintiff from making its own \nevaluation regarding probable cause and, therefore, injures Plaintiff.  However, Plaintiff has not \ndemonstrated that it has suffered an actual or imminent injury based on DRNCโs refusal to \nprovide its basis for its probable cause determination. Nor can Plaintiff demonstrate such an \ninjury โ Plaintiff cannot be injured by DRNCโs refusal to provide information to which Plaintiff \nis unequivocally not entitled. \nThe Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (โthe DD Actโ), 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 15041 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 45 C.F.R. ยงยง 1326.19 et seq., provide \nthe P&A system the right to access certain information โwhen the system determines that there is \nprobable causeโ to believe that an individual has been subject to abuse or neglect. 45 C.F.R. ยงยง \n1326.25(a)(3) and 1326.27(b)(ii) (emphasis added). โProbable causeโ is defined as \na  reasonable  ground  for  the  belief  that  an  individual  with \ndevelopmental disability(ies) has been or may be, subject to abuse \n7 \n \n\n \n \nor neglect, or that the health and safety of the individual is in serious \nand immediate jeopardy. The individual making such determination \nmay base the decision on reasonable inferences drawn from his or \nher experience or training regarding similar incidents, conditions or \nproblems that are usually associated with abuse or neglect. \n \nยง 1326.19. The plain language of the regulations endows the P&A with substantial discretion in \nmaking a probable cause determination. Further, the statute and regulations are entirely devoid of \nany suggestion that the service provider from whom the P&A seeks information has any role in \nthe probable cause determination. On the contrary, the comments to the regulations explicitly \nreject that premise, stating, โWhere there is controversy between the P&A and service provider \n[regarding grounds to request records], the P&A makes the relevant determination, in the interest \nof providing strong protection and advocacy for people with developmental disabilities in \nkeeping with the purposes of the DD Act.โ Developmental Disabilities Program, 80 Fed. Reg. \n44,796, 44,800 (July 27, 2015)(emphasis added). The Protection and Advocacy of Individual \nRights Program (โthe PAIR Actโ), 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e, incorporates the provisions of the DD Act \nand thus endows the P&A with the same right to determine whether probable cause exists. 29 \nU.S.C. ยง 794e(f)(2).2  \nIn the present case, DRNC has made a determination that probable cause exists to believe \nthat an individual(s) has been subject to abuse or neglect. This determination is sufficient to \ninvoke its authority to access certain records; there is no accompanying requirement that DRNC \ndivulge the basis for its determination. Such a requirement would undermine the statutesโ clear \nintent that a probable cause determination remain the exclusive domain of the P&A. 42 U.S.C. ยง \n                                                            \n2 Although not referenced in Plaintiffโs complaint, the third principle statute governing the P&A, the \nProtection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (โthe PAIMI Actโ), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801 \net seq., and its implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. ยงยง 51.1 et seq., contain identical language regarding \nprobable cause determinations. See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.41(b)(2)(iii) (โโฆand the P&A system has determined \nthat there is probable cause to believe that the individual has been or may be subject to abuse or \nneglect.โ)(emphasis added). \n8 \n \n\n \n \n10805(a)(4)(iii); 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043 (a)(2)(A)(I)(ii)(III); 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.41(b)(2)(iii); 45 C.F.R. \nยงยง 1326.25(a)(3) and 1326.27(b)(ii).  \nMore importantly, the DD and PAIR Acts prohibit such disclosure, as DRNC is obligated \nto maintain the confidentiality of all records and information pertaining to โthe identity of the \nindividualsโฆ who furnish information that forms the basis for a determination that probable \ncause existsโ and those individuals who โprovided information to the P&A for the record.โ 45 \nC.F.R. ยง 1326.28(b)(1)(iii-iv). \nEach court to consider probable cause determinations in the P&A context has held that as \nbetween the P&A and a service provider, it is the P&A, not a provider agency or state agency, \nwho determines whether probable cause exists. See, e.g., Arizona Ctr. for Disability Law v. \nAllen, 197 F.R.D. 689, 693 (D. Ariz. 2000)(โNeither the P&A laws nor the regulations \npromulgated thereunder contemplate that the state or a service provider will reevaluate the \nP&Aโs determination of probable cause and deny access to the P&A because the state or service \nprovider disagrees that probable cause exists.โ). See also Sonnenberg v. Disability Rights Idaho, \nInc. (In re Disability Rights Idaho Request for Ada Cnty. Coroner Records Relating to the Death \nof D.T.), 168 F. Supp. 3d 1282 (D. Idaho 2016)(โIn short, DRI [Disability Rights Idaho] has \ndetermined probable cause exists to investigate D.T.โs death and the Coroner is not permitted to \nchallenge this conclusion.โ); Ala.

Armstrong, 266 F. Supp. 2d 303 (D. Conn. 2003)(โIt is \nby now a settled principle that the P&A is โthe final arbiter of probable cause for the purpose of \n9 \n \n\n \n \ntriggering its authority to access all records for an individual that may have been subject to abuse \nor neglect.โโ (internal citations omitted)); Iowa Prot. & Advocacy Servs. v. Rasmussen, 521 F. \nSupp. 2d 895 (S.D. Iowa 2002)(โ[t]he statute [DD Act] is clear that it is the protection and \nadvocacy systems that shall make the relevant probable cause determination, as a result of its \nโmonitoring and other activities,โ and not a state agency.โ (emphasis in original)); Ctr. for Legal \nAdvocacy v. Earnest, 188 F. Supp. 2d 1251, 1257 (D. Colo. 2002)(โThe Court also recognizes \nthat a determination of probable cause made by the protection and advocacy system will not be \nreevaluated by the state or service provider merely because the state or service provider disagrees \nthat probable cause exists.โ).3 \nAs Plaintiff has not alleged it has suffered an actual or imminent, concrete and \nparticularized injury, and therefore has failed to make the requisite showing that it has standing, \nthe Amended Complaint must be dismissed as to the probable cause claim.    \nSECOND ARGUMENT: DISCRETION UNDER DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT \nPlaintiffโs claims do not serve the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act. Further, \nPlaintiff is using its requests for declaratory relief to effect a race to the courthouse, and \nexercising jurisdiction in the present matter would not further judicial efficiency. \nI.  Standard of Review: Discretion Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act \nThe Declaratory Judgment Act provides that โ[i]n a case of actual controversy within its \njurisdictionโฆ any court of the Unites Statesโฆ may declare the rights and other legal relations of \nany interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.โ \n                                                            \n3 Plaintiffโs Amended Complaint alleges it is DRNCโs position that the discretion of the P&A is absolute and there is \nno mechanism for โchecks and balances.โ (Amend. Compl. ยถ 53). As DRNC noted in its letter to Plaintiff dated \nAugust 3, 2017 (Amend. Compl. Ex. 4), the plain language of the regulations make clear that as between a service \nprovider and the P&A, the P&A alone determines whether probable cause exists. However, the regulations also \nmake clear that โ[i]n situations regarding abuse and neglect, the court remains โthe final arbiterโ with respect to \ndetermining whether an adequate basis for probable cause exists.โ Developmental Disabilities Program, 80 Fed. \nReg. 44,796, 44,800 (July 27, 2015). \n10 \n \n\n \n \n28 U.S.C. ยง 2201(a). A courtโs exercise of jurisdiction under the Act is not compulsory; rather, \nthe Declaratory Judgment Act has โbeen understood to confer on federal courts unique and \nsubstantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights of litigants.โ Wilton v. Seven \nFalls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 286 (1995)(emphasis added). A federal district court has โโgreat latitude \nin determining whether to assert jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions,โ but should \nrefuse to entertain a declaratory judgment only for good cause.โ First Nationwide Mortgage \nCorp. v. FISI Madison, LLC, 219 F. Supp. 2d 669, 672 (D.Md. 2002)(quoting Aetna Cas. & \nSurety Co. v. Quarles, 92 F.2d 321, 324 (4th Cir. 1937)). โA balance must be struck between \nthe... [potential plaintiffโs] traditional interests in choice of forum, timing, and avoiding a race to \nthe courthouseโฆ [and a potential defendantโs] interest in being relieved from the uncertainty and \ninsecurity arising from a controversy.โ State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Taylor, 118 F.R.D. 426, \n430 (M.D.N.C. 1988). In deciding whether to entertain a declaratory action, โa court should \nconsider whether a useful practical purpose will be served thereby; in other words, does the \ndeclaratory plaintiff need the remedy.โ Id. (citing United States v. Jones, 176 F.2d 278, 280 (4th \nCir. 1949)). The factors typically considered by courts include โ(1) whether the action serves the \npurpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act; (2) whether the action constitutes procedural fencing; \n(3) judicial efficiency; and (4) fairness to the parties.โ Hipage Co. v. Access2Go, Inc., 589 \nF.Supp.2d 602, 614-615 (E.D. Va. 2008)(internal citations omitted). \nII. Plaintiffโs requests for declaratory relief do not serve the purpose(s) of the Declaratory \nJudgment Act. \na.  Plaintiff seeks an advisory opinion, not the resolution of a controversy. \nJurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act is appropriate only where a justiciable \ncontroversy exists. โThe controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations \n11 \n \n\n \n \nof parties having adverse legal interests. It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting \nof specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion \nadvising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.โ Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. \nHaworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240-241 (1937)(internal citations omitted). The Act โdoes not exist to \nconvert judicial tribunals into counselors and impose upon them the duty of giving advisory \nopinions to any parties who may come into court and ask for either academic enlightenment or \npractical guidance concerning their legal affairs.โ Klingspor Abrasives, Inc. v. Woolsey, 2009 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 66747, *8, 2009 WL 2397088 (W.D.N.C. 2009). \nPlaintiffโs Amended Complaint clearly seeks an advisory opinion from this Court. With \nregard to its FERPA claim, Plaintiff requests โthe Courtโs interpretationโ of the relationship \nbetween FERPA and the DD and PAIR Acts, and whether it is required to release the requested \ninformation to DRNC โ in other words, practical guidance regarding its behavior. As to the \nprobable cause claim, Plaintiff similarly fails to identify a justiciable controversy; it again seeks \nan abstract interpretation as to what determines the existence of probable cause in the context of \nthe DD and PAIR Acts. As discussed more fully in Defendantโs First Argument, the dispute \nunderlying Plaintiffโs claims is not โof sufficient immediacy to warrant the issuance of a \ndeclaratory judgment, [and] any decision by this Court on this claim would be an improper \nadvisory opinion.โ Krebs v. Charlotte Sch. of Law, LLC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143060, *32 \n(W.D.N.C. Sept. 5, 2017). Therefore, the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the \naction. \n \n \n12 \n \n\n \n \nb.  This belated action is inappropriate under the Declaratory Judgment Act, as DRNC \nhas already been injured and its claims are ripe for adjudication. \nDeclaratory actions are designed to clarify the rights of each party so they can tailor their \nconduct to prevent the accrual of damages and to avoid future litigation. At first blush, it would \nseem that a declaratory judgment action is appropriate in the present case, as such relief would \nclarify Plaintiffโs obligations and rights, and avoid actions that would expose it to liability. \nHowever, โa declaratory judgment is unavailable in situations whereโฆ claims and rights asserted \nhave fully matured, and the alleged wrongs have already been committed.โ Trull v. Smolka, \n2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70233, *8, 2008 WL 4279599 (E.D. Va. 2008). Where a declaratory \njudgment โwould do nothing to steer Plaintiff away fromโ the alleged injury to the defendant, โa \ndeclaration from this Court is not consistent with the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act.โ \nTucker Materials, Inc. v. Safesound Acoustics, Inc., 971 F. Supp. 2d 537, 551 (W.D.N.C. 2013).   \nIn the present matter, the alleged wrong has already been committed: Plaintiff has denied \nDRNC access to records to which it is entitled. A judgment from the Court will not prevent \nPlaintiff from injuring DRNC. Therefore, Plaintiffโs request for declaratory relief at this stage \ndoes not serve the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nc.  This action is inappropriate under the Declaratory Judgment Act, as DRNC has not \nfailed or delayed in litigating its injuries. \nAnother purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to provide โa remedy in situations in \nwhich a dispute has reached the point that a party is entitled to seek a coercive remedy but has \nfailed to do so.โ State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Taylor, 118 F.R.D. 426, 429 (M.D.N.C. \n1988)(emphasis in original). โThe person who may be entitled to coercive relief has traditional \ninterests in choice of forum, timing, and avoiding a race to the courthouse,โ while โthe other \n13 \n \n\n \n \nparty has an interest in being relieved from the uncertainty and insecurity arising from a \ncontroversy.โ Id. at 430. Thus, where the party entitled to bring a coercive action fails or delays \nin bringing it, a declaratory judgment is useful โif it prevents the accrual of damagesโ and/or โif \nit relieves a party from acting at his peril while uncertain of his legal rights because another party \nis yet to bring a coercive action.โ Id. at 429.   \nWhether a party has failed or delayed in bringing a coercive action is a fact-specific \ndetermination. For example, in State Farm v. Taylor, State Farm filed a declaratory judgment \naction three days before notifying the Taylors that their insurance claim was denied. The court \nfound that the Taylors did not fail or delay in bringing a coercive action; instead, they were \ndeprived the opportunity to bring such action. The Taylors filed coercive counterclaims and \nindicated that, should the court dismiss the declaratory judgment action, they intended to initiate \na coercive suit immediately. In dismissing State Farmโs action, the court found that โ[s]ince there \nwas no delay, State Farm did not need relief from uncertainty and insecurity resulting from a \nโcoercive plaintiffโsโ failure to bring an affirmative action.โโ Id. at 430. The court also noted, \nโState Farm has not contended, nor does the Court perceive, a potential for the accrual of \ndamages or the need for State Farm to act at its peril while being uncertain of its rights.โ Id. at \n429. See also Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Williams, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3391, 2010 WL 274233 \n(M.D.N.C. 2010)(holding that filing an action for declaratory relief in the midst of ongoing \nsettlement negotiations, โabruptly ending any possibilityโ of settlement, constituted an action in \nanticipation of coercive litigation, and therefore dismissing the case as an improper use of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act.). \nState Farm is analogous to the matter at hand. There is a dispute regarding the partiesโ \nlegal rights and obligations, and one party, DRNC, is entitled to seek a coercive remedy, i.e. an \n14 \n \n\n \n \ninjunction compelling Plaintiff to produce the requested records. DRNC has not failed or delayed \nin bringing such suit. In a letter dated August 9, 2017, Plaintiff stated its belief that FERPA, state \nlaw and CMBOE policies prevent it from providing the information DRNC requested. However, \ncounsel for CMBOE invited DRNC to discuss the matter further in an attempt to reach a \nresolution. On August 14, DRNC responded to this invitation, in writing, and asked for a \nresponse by August 16. DRNC explicitly indicated that, should the parties not reach a resolution, \nDRNC intended to pursue litigation. Plaintiff did not respond to the August 14 letter; instead, \nPlaintiff filed its original complaint on August 18. DRNC had no notice of such filing, and \ninitiated its own action on August 23 (one week after the deadline for the requested response had \npassed). Disability Rights NC v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education, Civil \nAction No. 3:17-cv-00511. DRNC did not fail or delay in filing a coercive action, and Plaintiff \ndid not need relief from any resulting uncertainty or insecurity.  Nor has Plaintiff demonstrated \nthat it may accrue damages or that it needs to act while still uncertain of its rights. Therefore, \nPlaintiffโs request for declaratory relief at this stage does not serve the purpose of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, and this action should be dismissed. \nIII.  Plaintiffโs claims constitute a race to the courthouse in order to test potential defenses, \nwhich is an impermissible use of the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nGenerally, โwhere the same parties have filed similar litigation in separate federal fora, \ndoctrines of federal comity dictate that the matter should proceed in the court where the action \nwas first filed, and that the later-filed action should be stayed, transferred, or enjoined.โ L&H \nTechs., Inc. v. Technosports, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5089, *4, 2006 WL 163622 \n(W.D.N.C. 2006). Where โspecial circumstancesโ exist, an exception to this first-filed rule may \nbe warranted. For example, โthere may be a point at which โthe potential lawsuit that may \n15 \n \n\n \n \notherwise have given rise to a proper declaratory judgment action has become so certain or \nimminent, that the declaratory judgment action is merely an improper act of forum shopping, or a \nrace to the courthouse.โ Id. at *4-5. โIt is well established that courts disfavorโ such races to the \ncourthouse. Hipage Co. v. Access2Go, Inc., 589 F. Supp. 2d 602, 614 (E.D. Va. 2008)(citing \nNautilus Ins. Co. v. Winchester Homes, Inc., 15 F.3d 371, 377 (4th Cir. 1994)).  The Court โmay \nproperly consider the inequity of permitting a declaratory plaintiff to gain precedence in time and \nforum by filing a declaratory action which is merely anticipatory ofโ a defendantโs action. State \nFarm at 430 (emphasis in original).  \nIn Tucker Materials, Inc. v. Safesound Acoustics, Inc., 971 F. Supp. 2d 537 (W.D.N.C. \n2013), this Court found that where the plaintiff was on notice that the defendant planned to \ninitiate litigation against it, โ[t]he procedural fencing and race to the courthouse employed by \nPlaintiff in bringing this action weighs strongly in favor of declining to exercise jurisdiction in \nthis case.โ Id. at 552. Like the plaintiff in that case, Plaintiff CMBOE was on notice, as of \nAugust 3 and again on August 14, of DRNCโs unequivocal intent to litigate the dispute if \nresolution could not be reached. Plaintiff filed the present action on August 16, a mere two days \nafter DRNC reiterated its intent to initiate litigation. The timing of Plaintiffโs action demonstrates \nthat it engaged in an improper race to the courthouse. Therefore, Plaintiffโs declaratory actions \nshould be dismissed. \nAnother context in which courts have identified โspecial circumstancesโ supporting an \nexception to the first-filed rule (and therefore dismissal of a declaratory action) is the use of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act to improperly race to the courthouse in order to test the viability of a \ndefense. Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740 (1998)(holding a party cannot use the Declaratory \nJudgment Act โto gain a litigation defense by obtaining a ruling on an affirmative defense.โ). \n16 \n \n\n \n \nโThe anticipation of defenses is not a proper purpose of the declaratory remedy because it would \nlead to a race to the courthouse.โ State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Taylor, 118 F.R.D. 426, 431 \n(M.D.N.C. 1988). This Court has expressed the view โthat where a declaratory plaintiff raises \nchiefly an affirmative defense, and it appears that granting relief could effectively deny an \nallegedly injured party its otherwise legitimate choice of the forum and time for suit, no \ndeclaratory judgment should issue.โ Tucker Materials at 552 (internal citations omitted).  \nState Farm v. Taylor is again analogous to the matter at hand. In seeking a declaration \nregarding its liability under a policy issued to the Taylors, โState Farm simply anticipated the \ndefense it would assert against the Taylors and outraced them to the courthouse before giving \nthem notice of denial.โ 118 F.R.D. 426, 430. The court found this particularly compelling in \ngranting the Taylorsโ motion to dismiss, writing โthe anticipation of defenses is not ordinarily a \nproper use of the declaratory judgment procedure. It deprives the plaintiff of his traditional \nchoice of forum and timing, and it provokes a disorderly race to the courthouse.โ Id. at 429-430. \nSimilarly, in Tucker Materials, a building supply company brought suit against an installation \nagency. The supply company sought a declaration that it had not violated state consumer \nprotection and/or federal antitrust law. In dismissing the action, this Court observed that \nโ[c]ourts have nearly uniformly held that declaratory relief is inappropriate in cases such as this \nwhere an alleged tortfeasor sues the insured party for a declaration of nonliability in anticipation \nof suit.โ 971 F. Supp. 2d 537, 552. This Court found that โ[a]t the time Plaintiff brought this \naction, [Plaintiff] was on notice that Defendant was planning on initiating litigation against it for \nalleged violations of Chapter 75 [state consumer protection laws]. The procedural fencing and \nrace to the courthouse employed by Plaintiff in bringing this action weighs strongly in favor of \ndeclining to exercise jurisdiction in this case.โ Id. at 552.  \n17 \n \n\n \n \nLike the plaintiff in State Farm, Plaintiff in this case has simply anticipated the defenses \nit might assert in a coercive action filed by DRNC โ that disclosure of the requested information \nis prohibited by FERPA, and that DRNC lacks probable cause to access the information โ and \noutraced DRNC to the courthouse in order to convert those defenses into an action for \ndeclaratory judgment. Similar to the plaintiff in Tucker Materials, Plaintiff was on notice, as \nrecently as two days before initiating this action, that DRNC intended to litigate the dispute if \nresolution could not be reached. The timing of Plaintiffโs action demonstrates that it engaged in \nan improper race to the courthouse. Therefore, Plaintiffโs declaratory actions should be \ndismissed. \nIV.  Judicial efficiency will not be served by granting jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs claims. \nDeclaratory judgment is not intended to permit parties to โtry a controversy by piecemeal, \nor to try particular issues without settling the entire controversy.โ Alphatronix, Inc. v. Pinnacle \nMicro, Inc., 814 F. Supp. 455, 456 (M.D.N.C. 1993)(citing Mitcheson v. Harris, 955 F.2d 235, \n239 (4th Cir. 1992)). โA court may be induced to deny declaratory relief if the judgment sought \nwould not settle the controversy between the parties; such relief is not to be used to try a case by \npiecemeal.โ State Farm at 430. โA contrary view would promote a disorderly race to the \ncourthouse. It would create an environment in which parties to disputes would feel the urgency \nto file a lawsuit lest they lose a tactical advantage. Such an environment would discourage the \nprelitigation settlement of disputes and thus prejudice judicial economy.โ  Id. at 431; see also \nHipage Co., 589 F.Supp.2d 602, 614 (E.D. Va. 2008). \nKlingspor Abrasives, Inc. v. Woolsey is instructive, though based upon the State version \nof the Declaratory Judgment Act, not the federal Act. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66747, 2009 WL \n2397088 (W.D.N.C. 2009). In that case, Woolsey filed a charge of discrimination against \n18 \n \n\n \n \nKlinspor with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging he was terminated \nbased on his age and his opposition to discriminatory actions against older employees and \nfemales. Klingspor sought a declaration that it had not unlawfully discriminated against \nWoolsey. This Court held โdeclaratory judgment should not be invoked to try a controversy by \npiecemeal, or to try particular issues without settling the entire controversy. This is especially so \nwhere a separate suit has been filed, or is likely to be filed, that will more fully encompass the \nscope of the entire controversy.โ Id. at *8-9. See Tucker Materials, 971 F. Supp. 2d 537, 551 \n(holding that, among other factors, because a declaratory judgment โwould do nothing to address \nthe breach of contract or some of the additional torts asserted by Defendant,โ dismissal of the \naction was appropriate). \nPlaintiffโs declaratory judgment action in the present case is the embodiment of \npiecemeal litigation. Resolution of Plaintiffโs two claims would not settle the entire controversy \nbetween the parties. For example, Plaintiffโs original Complaint asked the Court to decide who \ndetermines the existence of probable cause, leaving open the question as to whether Plaintiff is \nrequired to produce the information requested in the present circumstances. While Plaintiffโs \nAmended Complaint attempts to close this gap by rewording its request and seeking specific \nguidance on its obligations to release the information, the claims presented still would not \nresolve the entire controversy. Plaintiff may still seek to defend its failure to produce the \ninformation by, e.g., invoking state and federal confidentiality requirements. Such assertions by \nPlaintiff would necessitate further judicial review to determine whether DRNC is entitled to \naccess the requested information. As DRNC has filed an action that will more completely \nencompass the full scope of the controversy, that action is the appropriate forum for resolution. \n19 \n \n\n \n \nAs both Plaintiffโs Civil Action (498) and DRNCโs subsequent Civil Action (511) were \nfiled in this forum, the Court may consider that consolidation is a potential remedy. However, \nconsolidation would not serve judicial efficiency. It would merely combine the two matters, \nresulting in confusion and a lack of clear delineation as to the parties (CMBOE would become \nboth Plaintiff and Consolidated Defendant; DRNC would be both Defendant and Consolidated \nPlaintiff). Judicial economy can be most effectively served if the present Civil Action (498) is \nswept aside and litigation of the issues proceeds in a recognized framework (i.e. Civil Action \n511), where the P&A demands access to information and records, and the service provider raises \nwhat it deems to be appropriate defenses. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendant has shown that Plaintiff has not met its burden to establish standing in the \npresent case. Defendant has also shown good cause as to why this Court should not exercise \njurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Defendant thus requests the Court grant \njudgment in its favor, and grant Defendantโs Renewed Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint. \nRespectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Kristine L.

CMBOE is bound by federal, state, and local laws to protect and hold \nconfidential the PPI of its students unless a statutorily defined exception exists. In support of this \nComplaint, CMBOE alleges the following: \n1 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 1 of 11\n\nPARTIES \n1.   Plaintiff is a corporate entity whose board members are duly elected citizens of \nMecklenburg County which is charged by state law with the control and operation of the \nMecklenburg County public schools. Plaintiff is also known as Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools \nor CMS.   \n2.   Upon information and belief, Defendant is a private organization, receiving \nfederal funding, with its primary offices located at 3724 National Drive, Suite 100, Raleigh, NC \n27612. This organization was designated as the stateโs Protection and Advocacy Agency by \nGovernor Mike Easley as of 2007. Defendant may be served by serving registered agent, Vicki \nSmith at the aforementioned address.  \n3.  This is a declaratory judgment action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201 for the \npurposes of resolving an actual controversy between the parties, as more fully appears below.  \nJURISDICTION \n \n4.  This action is brought pursuant to the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. ยง 220, and jurisdiction in this action is based upon 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, and is proper \nbecause Plaintiff is seeking an interpretation of 20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g, 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043(a)(2)(B), \n29 U.S.C. ยง 794e, 45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.25, and 45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.19. The parties are subject to \nfederal statutes and regulations which address the unauthorized disclosure of PPI of students.  \nBACKGROUND \n \n5.   On or about June 7, 2017, CMBOE received a letter from Defendant, through \nattorney, Kristine Sullivan (hereinafter referred to as โSullivanโ), seeking confidential student \ninformation from Metro School (hereinafter referred to as โMetroโ) pursuant to 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e \n(f)(2), 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043(a)(2)(B), 45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.25, and 45 C.F.R.ยง 1326.19.  Metro is a \n2 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 2 of 11\n\nschool that serves students who are all cognitively disabled. A true and correct copy of the \nreferenced letter is attached and hereto incorporated by reference as Exhibit A.  \n6.   The confidential student information sought by Defendant was the Individualized \nEducation Plans (IEP) for all students at Metro, approximately 250 students, the permission or \nparental waiver forms given to the school that allowed use of โwheelchairs or other devices in \norder to support or mitigate harm to the child . . . โ, or in the alternative, the names and contact \ninformation for the parents or guardians of all Metro students. \n7.   Defendantโs letter asked that all identifying information be redacted and that the \nIEPs only contain information that described the use of assistive technology, restraint, and/or \nseclusion.  \n8.   Defendantโs letter stated โDisability Rights NC has received a complaint \nregarding improper use of restraintโ and based on said complaint, Defendant was โconducting an \ninvestigation into student care and treatment.โ There were no other specifics regarding the \ncomplaint.  \n9.  Defendant set a deadline of fifteen (15) days to comply with the demand.   \n10.   On or about June 13, 2017, J. Melissa Woods, Counsel for CMBOE, (hereinafter \nreferred to as โWoodsโ) spoke with Sullivan and requested an agreement to extend the deadline \nto July 14, 2017. Sullivan agreed to this change.  \n11.   On June 16, 2017, Woods and Sullivan engaged in a telephone conversation \nregarding the information sought by Defendant.  The purpose of the conversation was to obtain \nclarity regarding Defendantโs purported authority to access records, and to receive additional \ninformation about the alleged complaint. \n3 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 3 of 11\n\n12.   During the June 16, 2017 conversation, Woods asked Sullivan for details about \nthe complaint. Sullivan stated there was not a complaint from a person, but that Defendant used \nthe term โcomplaintโ broadly.  \n13.  Sullivan further explained that probable cause was based on monitoring done \nwhile Sullivan visited Metro, and her observations to the following: \na.  A female student being offered a wheelchair by a staff member and the \nmother of the student replying that the student did not need it. Sullivan \nthen observed this student โwalk on her own.โ When an inquiry was made \nas to why an ambulatory student would be offered a wheelchair, the \nassistant principal of Metro allegedly replied: wheelchairs were used for \nambulatory students for various reasons, including staff convenience;  \nb.  A male student in a Rifton chair1 during class time. When an inquiry was \nmade, the assistant principal allegedly replied: the chair was used to \nmobilize the student during class time; and   \nc.  โthe extensive number of wheelchairs, Rifton chairs, and other devices \npresent in Metroโs classrooms that constitute a restraint.2 \n \n14.  Per Sullivan, the information provided by the assistant principal did not represent \nan appropriate use of said devices, and based on the observations and comments, Defendant \nโthinks they have gotten to the level of probable cause.โ \n  15.   Woods inquired whether Defendant would be willing to narrow their request for \ndocuments to the observed studentsโif said students could be identifiedโor students whose \n                                                           \n1 Activity Chair is intended to provide comfortable seating with adjustable support for children and adolescents \nwith disabilities in the classroom or at home. http://www.rehabmart.com/product/rifton-activity-chair-r840-\nstandard-base-medium-31780.html \n2 This information was conveyed not in the phone conversation, but in the email that was dated June 16, 2017. See \nExhibit B. \n4 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 4 of 11\n\nparents had authorized use of assistive devices in the way Sullivan had observed; Sullivan agreed \nto consider the narrowing the records request.  \n  16.   Woods also informed Sullivan that CMBOE would be willing to correct any \ndeficiencies, if they could be identified, and cooperate with any investigation. \n  17.  Although the assistant principal who spoke to Defendantโs employees during the \nabove referenced visit admits to stating that assistive devices are sometimes used for \nconvenience, she denies stating that โconvenienceโ was for staff purposes.  \n  18.   The Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) for some students at Metro allow for \nthe use of assistive technology devices, such as wheelchairs, for ambulatory students, at the \nstudentโs convenience, when there is a risk of safety to the student.  \n19.  On June 23, 2017, Sullivan sent an email to Woods refusing to narrow the request \nbecause there โwas probable cause regarding all the students at Metro.โ (emphasis added). A true \nand correct copy of the referenced email is attached and hereto incorporated by reference as \nExhibit B.  \n20.   On July 13, 2017, CMBOE mailed Defendant the redacted IEPs of all students \nwho were enrolled at Metro.  \n21.  Also, on July 13 2017, CMBOE, through Woods, sent a letter, explaining why \nCMBOE had provided the requested documents and advising Defendant that CMBOE did not \nagree with Defendantโs determination of probable cause. CMBOE also reiterated that Defendant \nwas not entitled to PPI regarding every student at Metro and promised strict scrutiny of future \nrequests. A true and correct copy of the referenced letter is attached and hereto incorporated by \nreference as Exhibit C.  \n5 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 5 of 11\n\n22.   On August 3, 2017, Defendant sent a letter in response to CMBOEโs July 13, \n2017 letter. A true and correct copy of the referenced letter is attached and hereto incorporated \nby reference as Exhibit D. \n23.  In the letter,  Defendant contends it has probable cause to believe that abuse \nand/or neglect occurred at Metro and demanded the names and contact information for the \nparents or guardians of all students be provided to Defendant within three (3) business days.  \n24.  In the letter, Sullivan claimed Woods had inaccurately recounted the telephone \nconversation on June 16, and denied the alleged probable cause was solely based on observations \nof Defendantโs employees and statements by the assistant principal.  \n25.   Although there was no new details provided, Defendant claimed there existed a \nreport which constitutes a complaint.  \n26.  On August 9, 2017, CMBOE sent a response to the letter dated August 3, 2017, \nrequesting details of the complaint or report upon which Defendant based probable cause and \nrefusing the demand for parent or guardian information because a release of this information \nwould violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and CMBOE Policies. A \ntrue and accurate copy of the letter is attached hereto and incorporated by reference as Exhibit \nE.  \n27.  Defendant responded on August 14, 2017, stating that Protection and Advocacy \nAgencies, such as the Defendant, have the final authority regarding the determination of \nprobable cause, and are not required to disclose the basis for probable cause. A true and accurate \ncopy of the letter is attached hereto and incorporated by reference as Exhibit F.  \n28.   This letter, however, again stated that the probable cause for Defendantโs request \nfor the information at Metro was based on observations and โreceived information.โ  \n6 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 6 of 11\n\nCount 1: Declaratory Judgment regarding FERPA  \n \n  29.  CMBOE restates and incorporates by reference each of the preceding paragraphs. \n \n30.  The information Defendant seeks is PPI as defined by FERPA and protected by \nthe mandates of that statute.3 \n31.  FERPA provides the circumstances by which PPI can be released without parental \nconsent.4 Release of this information to Defendant, acting as a Protection and Advocacy agency, \nis not an exception set forth in FERPA.  \n32.  The Fourth Circuit has not addressed the authority of Protection and Advocacy \nagencies to obtain PPI from a public school. \n33.  By providing the information sought by the Defendant, CMBOE would breach the \nrights of the students under its protection and violate federal law.  \n34.  Due to the partiesโ disagreement regarding the interpretation of the confidentiality \nprovision of FERPA and whether, or under what circumstances, CMBOE should release the \ninformation demanded by the Defendant, CMBOE requests the Courtโs interpretation of the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Act (DDA) and Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights \n(PAIR), as those statutes relate to FERPA, and whether CMBOE is required to release the \ninformation demanded by Defendant.   \nCount 2: Declaratory Judgment Regarding Probable Cause \n35.   CMBOE restates and incorporates by reference each of the preceding paragraphs. \n36.  Defendant interprets the federal statutes regarding access to records very broadly \nand relies heavily on authority from outside the Fourth Circuit to support its perceived powers.5  \n                                                           \n3 20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g (b)(1) et. seq. \n4 Id.  \n5 See Exhibit A. \n7 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 7 of 11\n\n37.  However, Defendantโs authority to access records of disabled individuals is \nlimited to three circumstances: 1) when the individual is a client; 2) when the individual is \nwithout a parent or guardian to authorize access or the individual is unable to authorize access; or \n3) when there has been a complaint or probable cause exists to believe an individual has been \nsubject to abuse or neglect. 6 \n38.  In an email dated June 16, 2017, Defendant admitted that the first of the three \nenumerated circumstance is not applicable to this matter.7 A true and correct copy of the \nreferenced email is attached and hereto incorporated by reference as Exhibit G. \n39.   The second circumstance is not satisfied because, upon information and belief, all \nstudents at Metro have parents or guardians. CMBOE therefore rejects Defendantโs contention \nthat the second condition is relevant to this matter.  \n40.   Therefore, the only relevant condition under which Defendant could validly claim \naccess to records at Metro is the condition which requires Defendant to receive a complaint \nalleging abuse or neglect or when probable cause for abuse or neglect exists. \n41.  Probable cause is defined as a โreasonable ground for belief that an individual \nwith developmental disabilities has, or may be, subject to abuse [or] neglect.โ8 \n42.  Although the Defendant continues to assert a complaint has been received, \nCMBOE has not been provided with any details of said complaint or report that constitute \nprobable cause of abuse or neglect outside of what is listed in Paragraph 13 and Exhibit F.  \n43.  Even assuming the assistive technology devices were being used in the manner \nDefendant alleges, such use does not constitute abuse or neglect. \n                                                           \n6 42. U.S.C. ยง 15043 (a)(2)(I); 45 C.F.R. 1326.25(a) (1-3). \n7 See Exhibit G. \n8 45 CRF 1386.19. \n8 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 8 of 11\n\n44.  Furthermore, if a studentโs IEP provides for use of an assistive technology device \nin a way that prevents harm to the student or aids in the studentโs convenience, such use would \nnot constitute an inappropriate use of said device, and therefore would not, per Defendantโs \ndefinition interpretation, rise to the level of abuse or neglect.  \n45.   CMBOE offered Defendant an opportunity to view IEPs which contained \ninstructions specifically related to the use of assistive devices of ambulatory students, but \nDefendant refused to narrow its request and instead requested all redacted IEPs.9  \n46.   The redacted IEPs prevented Defendant from linking particular studentsโwho \nwere authorized by the IEP team to use assistive technology devices for their convenience or \nsafety โto specific IEPs.   \n47.  A complaint related to a limited number of students does not constitute probable \ncause for every student in a school.10  \n48.   While it โmay be made based on reasonable inferencesโ11, probable cause must be \nconcrete and articulable.12 \n49.  While CMBOE does not agree that the provided information meets the definition \nof probable cause, as it relates to the observed students, CMBOE forcefully objects to such \ninformation being used to support Defendantโs contention that it has reasonable grounds to \nbelieve that โall  . . . students at Metro have been or may be subject to abuse/neglect.โ13 \n                                                           \n9 See Exhibit B. \n10 See Wash. Prot. & Advocacy Sys. v. Evergreen Sch. Dist., Case No. C03-5062 FDB (W.D. Wash. 2003), \n(unpublished) affโd, 71 Fed. Appx. 654, 2003 WL 21751827 (9th Cir. Wash), finding no abuse of discretion.  \n11 45 C.F.R. 1236.19.  \n12 See Pennsylvania Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Royer-Greaves Sch. for Blind, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4609, at *26 \n(E.D. Pa. March 24, 1999). \n13 See Exhibit F. \n9 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 1   Filed 08/18/17   Page 9 of 11\n\n50.  While some jurisdictions have allowed Protection and Advocacy agencies access \nto the records of all students, these instances have been limited to circumstances where there has \nbeen serious injury or death or allegations of pervasive systematic abuses. 14  \n51.   Such reasoning is lacking in this case and, therefore, probable cause for obtaining \nthe records of every student at Metro school does not exist.  \n  Due to the partiesโ failure to agree upon what constitutes reasonable probable \ncause and whether probable, as it relates to a finite number of students, permits Defendant to \nobtain PPI for every student at a school, CMBOE requests the Court clarify who determines the \nstandard for probable cause when Protection and Advocacy agencies seek access to all studentsโ \nPPI. \nWHEREFORE, for all the reasons set forth above, CMBOE respectfully requests that the \nCourt issue a finding that FERPA prohibits the release of the names of all the parents or \nguardians of the Metro students, and that Defendantโs overly broad requests lacks grounds on \nwhich to base a reasonable belief that โall students at Metro have or may be subject to abuse or \nneglect,โ and find that Defendant has not met its burden that there are reasonable grounds for \nobtaining parent/guardian information for all students at Metro. CMBOE further requests that the \nCourt grant any other such relief as may be appropriate.  \n  Respectfully submitted, this the 18th day of August, 2017.  \n \n           \ns/ J.

No. 12); its \nMemorandum in Support, (Doc. No. 13); Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Educationโs \n(โPlaintiffโsโ)  Response  in  Opposition  to  Defendantโs  Motion,  (Doc.  No.  18); \nDefendantโs Reply to Plaintiffโs Response, (Doc. No. 19); and the Magistrate Judgeโs \nMemorandum and Recommendation (โM&Rโ), (Doc. No. 21); recommending that this \nCourt deny the defendantโs motion.  The parties have not filed objections to the M&R \nand the time for doing so has expired.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). \nI.  BACKGROUND \n No party has objected to the Magistrate Judgeโs statement of the factual and \nprocedural background of this case.  Therefore, the Court adopts the facts as set forth \nin the M&R. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n1 \n\nA district court may assign dispositive pretrial matters, including motions to \ndismiss, to a magistrate judge for โproposed findings of fact and recommendations.โ  \n28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(A) & (B).  The Federal Magistrate Act provides that a district \ncourt โshall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified \nproposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.โ  Id. ยง 636(b)(1)(C); \nFed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).  However, โwhen objections to strictly legal issues are raised \nand no factual issues are challenged, de novo review of the record may be dispensed \nwith.โ  Orpiano v. Johnson, 687 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir. 1982).  De novo review is also \nnot required โwhen a party makes general or conclusory objections that do not direct \nthe  court  to  a  specific  error  in  the  magistrate  judgeโs  proposed  findings  and \nrecommendations.โ  Id.  Similarly, when no objection is filed, โa district court need \nnot conduct a de novo review, but instead must โonly satisfy itself that there is no \nclear error on the face of the record in order to accept the recommendation.โโ  Diamond \nv. Colonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 315 (4th Cir. 2005) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 72, advisory committee note). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nUnder Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court judge \nshall make a de novo determination of any portion of an M&R to which specific \nwritten objection has been made.  A partyโs failure to make a timely objection is \naccepted as an agreement with the conclusions of the Magistrate Judge.  See Thomas \nv. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 149โ50 (1985).  No objection to the M&R having been filed, and \nthe time for doing so having passed, the parties have waived their right to de novo \n2 \n\nreview of any issue covered in the M&R.  Nevertheless, this Court has conducted a \nfull review of the M&R and other documents of record and, having done so, hereby \nfinds  that  the  recommendation  of  the  Magistrate  Judge  is,  in  all  respects,  in \naccordance with the law and should be approved.  Accordingly, the Court ADOPTS \nthe recommendation of the Magistrate Judge as its own.  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that: \n1.  The Magistrate Judgeโs M&R, (Doc. No. 21), is ADOPTED; and \n2.  Disability Rights North Carolinaโs Motion to Dismiss, (Doc. No. 12), is \nDENIED.  \nSigned: August 15, 2018 \n \n \n   \n3 ",

Defendant, \nDisability Rights North Carolina (โDRNCโ), is the Protection and Advocacy system (โP&Aโ) \ndesignated by the Governor of the State of North Carolina to provide protection and advocacy \nservices to individuals with disabilities. As the P&A, DRNC has the responsibility and authority \nto investigate allegations of abuse and/or neglect of individuals with disabilities. By this action, \nPlaintiff seeks to prevent DRNC from carrying out such an investigation at the Metro School, a \nschool that serves only students with disabilities, located in Charlotte, NC and operated by \nPlaintiff. \n \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 1 of 21\n\n \n \n  DRNC received complaints regarding abuse and/or neglect of students at the Metro \nSchool. DRNC initiated monitoring activities at Metro School, during which time DRNC staff \nobserved circumstances and received information that led DRNC to determine that it had \nprobable cause, as that term is defined in the federal statutes and regulations governing the P&A, \nto believe that students at Metro School were being subjected to abuse and/or neglect, thus \nmeriting investigation. On August 3, 2017, in furtherance of such investigation, DRNC requested \nin writing that Plaintiff provide it with the names and contact information of the parents and \nguardians of each student attending Metro School, so that written releases might be obtained, \nthus permitting DRNC to review student records as deemed necessary for the investigation \n(Compl. ยถยถ 22-23). In this request, DRNC notified Plaintiff that โ[i]f the request for information \nis denied, Disability Rights NC will be forced to seek a court order resolving this matter.โ \n(Compl. Exhibit D). On August 9, 2017, counsel for Plaintiff notified DRNC of its decision to \ndeny DRNCโs request for parent and guardian names and contact information (Compl. ยถ 26). At \nthat time, Plaintiff invited DRNC to provide further information regarding the basis for its \nprobable cause determination (Compl. Exhibit E). On August 14, 2017, DRNC provided its \nresponse to Plaintiff regarding its authority to obtain the names and contact information \nrequested โ i.e. its receipt of complaints and determination of probable cause โ and clarifying \nthat Plaintiff is not entitled to a detailed recitation of DRNCโs basis for its probable cause \ndetermination, as such a determination is the sole province of the P&A system. DRNC requested \na response by August 16, 2017, and indicated that if the matter was not resolved by that date, \nDRNC would be โprepared to proceed as necessary at that time.โ (Compl. Exhibit F). \n \n \n2 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 2 of 21\n\n \n \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nRather than respond directly to DRNCโs August 14, 2017 letter, Plaintiff instead filed the \npresent action for declaratory judgment. Specifically, Plaintiff seeks โthe Courtโs interpretation \nof the Developmental Disabilities Act (DDA) and Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights \n(PAIR), as those statutes relate to FERPA [the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act], and \nwhether CMBOE is required to release the information demanded by Defendant.โ (Compl. ยถ 34) \n(hereinafter referred to as โPlaintiffโs FERPA claimโ). Plaintiff further โrequests the Court \nclarify who determines the standard for probable cause when Protection and Advocacy agencies \nseek access to all studentsโ PPI [Personally Identifiable Information].โ (Compl. ยถ 51) (hereinafter \nreferred to as โPlaintiffโs probable cause claimโ). \nPlaintiff served the complaint on DRNC by registered mail, and did not otherwise notify \nDRNC of its actions.  In the meantime, on August 23, 2017, DRNC initiated a separate action in \nthis Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Disability Rights North Carolina v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education, Civil Action No. 3:17-cv-00511. A copy of \nthe file-stamped complaint is attached and incorporated as Exhibit A. DRNC provided counsel \nfor Plaintiff with a courtesy copy of its complaint by email that same day. A copy of the \nreferenced email is attached and incorporated as Exhibit B. DRNC learned of the present matter \nwhen Plaintiff provided a copy of the complaint and summons, by email, on August 24, 2017. A \ncopy of the referenced email is attached and incorporated as Exhibit C. \nDefendant has filed the accompanying Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction, and Motion to Dismiss pursuant to the discretion granted by the Declaratory \nJudgment Act. \n \n3 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 3 of 21\n\n \n \nFIRST ARGUMENT: LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \nPlaintiff has not established that it has standing, and therefore the Court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction over this matter. \nI.  Standard of Review: Rule 12(b)(1) \nWhere there is a question of subject matter jurisdiction, the court โmay weigh the \nevidence in determining whether the facts support the jurisdictional allegations.โ Lovern v. \nEdwards, 190 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 1999).  The court must โregard the pleadingsโ allegations \nas mere evidence on the issue, and may consider evidence outside the pleadings.โ Richmond, \nFredericksburg & Potomac R. Co. v. United States, 945 F.2d 765, 768 (4th Cir. 1991). \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution limits federal jurisdiction to live โcasesโ and \nโcontroversies.โ  U.S. Const., art. III, ยง 2.  A crucial aspect of this case-or-controversy \nrequirement is standing, and the plaintiff, seeking federal jurisdiction, bears the burden of \nestablishing standing. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992). To establish it has \nstanding, Plaintiff CMBOE must allege (1) it has suffered an actual or imminent, concrete and \nparticularized injury, (2) that is fairly traceable to an action by Defendant DRNC that it is \nchallenging, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by the declaratory relief requested. Krebs v. \nCharlotte Sch. of Law, LLC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143060, *30 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 5, \n2017)(citing Lujan at 561). โWhere a plaintiff does not establish each of the elements of \nstanding, a court must dismiss that claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id. (citing Valley \nForce Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 475-\n76 (1982)). Any decision by the court where the case-or-controversy requirement is not met \nโwould be an improper advisory opinion on an abstract question.โ Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pacific \nCo., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941). \n4 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 4 of 21\n\n \n \nII. The FERPA claim \nPlaintiff has not demonstrated that it has suffered an actual or imminent injury based on \nDRNCโs request for information that, according to Plaintiff, is protected by FERPA.1 Plaintiff \nhas affirmatively stated that it will not produce the information requested by DRNC. The only \nrecourse available to DRNC is the action it has taken, i.e. to file a civil action for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief requiring CMBOE to produce the requested information. There is no civil or \ncriminal sanction for failure to produce the information. DRNCโs written indication of its intent \nto initiate a civil action regarding this matter may not be used to demonstrate injury to Plaintiff, \nas the threat of a lawsuit is not sufficient to establish actual or imminent injury. See Klingspor \nAbrasives, Inc. v. Woolsey, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66747, *7, 2009 WL 2397088 (W.D.N.C. \n2009). \n                                                           \n1 For the sake of argument in this Memorandum only, we will assume that FERPA applies to the \ninformation requested, and DRNC explicitly reserves the right to challenge this assertion in further \nproceedings. However, Plaintiffโs application of FERPA to the names and contact information of the \nparents/guardians of students is erroneous. FERPA defines information such as the name, address and \ntelephone number of a student as โdirectory information.โ 20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(a)(5)(A). The regulations \nexpressly permit general disclosure of directory information. 34 C.F.R. ยง 99.31(a)(3)(ii)(9)(i). Several \ncourts have applied this provision to permit the P&A to obtain such directory information. For example, \nin Disability Law Ctr. of Alaska, Inc. v. Anchorage Sch. Dist., 581 F.3d 936 (9th Cir. 2009), the court \nreferenced amicus briefs filed by the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services in a similar case before the Second Circuit. The Ninth Circuit adopted the agenciesโ \ninterpretation of the DD Act and FERPA.  \n \nThe agencies stated that โif a school or other facility could refuse to \nprovide the name and contact information, it could interfere substantially \nwith P&Aโs investigation of abuse or neglect, thereby thwarting Congressโ \nintent that P&As act to protect vulnerable populations from abuse or \nneglect.โ Furthermore, the agencies found โno indication that Congress \nbelieved that the carefully tailored access rights required under [the DD \nAct]  would  be  subordinate  to  the  general  privacy  requirements  of \nFERPA.โ Rather, โpermitting access as provided for underโฆ the DD Act \nis generally consisted with Congressโ intent relating to student privacy.โ  \n \nId. at 940 (citing Conn. Office of Prot. & Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Hartford Bd. Of \nEduc., 464 F.3d 229, 236 (2nd Cir. 2006)).  \n5 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 5 of 21\n\n \n \nIn its Complaint, Plaintiff posits that by providing the requested information to DRNC, \nPlaintiff โwould breach the rights of the students under its protection and violate federal law.โ \n(Compl. ยถ 33). Neither of these alleged possible injuries are sufficient to establish an actual or \nimminent injury, however. Plaintiff is currently in possession of the information sought by \nDRNC. The potential for injury, i.e. that Plaintiff would violate federal law, is entirely \nspeculative and will not come to pass through any action on the part of DRNC. Plaintiff controls \nwhether it will suffer this alleged harm by disclosing the information in question. Having clearly \nindicated it will not release the requested information in the absence of a court order, Plaintiff \ncannot simultaneously allege that the tenuous possibility that it will produce the information and \nthereby violate federal law constitutes a โconcrete and particularized injury.โ Moreover, \nproduction of the information would not violate federal law. FERPA permits the general \ndisclosure of โdirectory information,โ and specifically permits the disclosure of any student \ninformation where such disclosure โis to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued \nsubpoena.โ 34 C.F.R. ยง 99.31(a)(3)(ii)(9)(i) โ (11). See Arista Records LLC v. Doe, 551 F. Supp. \n2d 1 (D.D.C. 2008)(holding that, because the court authorized various record companies to serve \na subpoena on George Washington University seeking directory information for students the \ncompanies alleged infringed their copyrighted recordings by using an online file-sharing system, \nsuch disclosure was permitted by FERPA); Warner Bros. Records Inc., et al. v. Does 1-6, 527 F. \nSupp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2007)(holding that Georgetown Universityโs disclosure of information in \nresponse to plaintiffโs subpoena complied with FERPA). \nAs Plaintiff has not alleged it has suffered an actual or imminent, concrete and \nparticularized injury, and therefore has failed to make the requisite showing that it has standing, \nthe Complaint must be dismissed as to the FERPA claim.    \n6 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 6 of 21\n\n \n \nIII.  The probable cause claim \nIn its Complaint, Plaintiff suggests, though does not explicitly state, that DRNCโs refusal \nto provide the basis for its probable cause determination prevents Plaintiff from making its own \nevaluation regarding probable cause and, therefore, injures Plaintiff.  However, Plaintiff has not \ndemonstrated that it has suffered an actual or imminent injury based on DRNCโs refusal to \nprovide its basis for its probable cause determination. Nor can Plaintiff demonstrate such an \ninjury โ Plaintiff cannot be injured by DRNCโs refusal to provide information to which Plaintiff \nis unequivocally not entitled. \nThe Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (โthe DD Actโ), 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 15041 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 45 C.F.R. ยงยง 1326.19 et seq., provide \nthe P&A system the right to access certain information โwhen the system determines that there is \nprobable causeโ to believe that an individual has been subject to abuse or neglect. 45 C.F.R. ยงยง \n1326.25(a)(3) and 1326.27(b)(ii) (emphasis added). The statute and regulations are entirely \ndevoid of any suggestion that the service provider from whom the P&A seeks information has \nany role in the probable cause determination. On the contrary, the comments to the DD Act \nregulations explicitly state, โWhere there is controversy between the P&A and service provider \n[regarding grounds to request records], the P&A makes the relevant determination, in the interest \nof providing strong protection and advocacy for people with developmental disabilities in \nkeeping with the purposes of the DD Act.โ Developmental Disabilities Program, 80 Fed. Reg. \n44,796, 44,800 (July 27, 2015)(emphasis added). The Protection and Advocacy of Individual \nRights Program (โthe PAIR Actโ), 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e, incorporates the provisions of the DD Act \n7 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 7 of 21\n\n \n \nand thus endows the P&A with the same right to determine whether probable cause exists. 29 \nU.S.C. ยง 794e(f)(2).2  \nIn the present case, DRNC has made a determination that probable cause exists to believe \nthat an individual(s) has been subject to abuse or neglect. This determination is sufficient to \ninvoke its authority to access certain records; there is no accompanying requirement that DRNC \ndivulge the basis for its determination. Such a requirement would undermine the statutesโ clear \nintent that a probable cause determination remain the exclusive domain of the P&A. 42 U.S.C. ยง \n10805(a)(4)(iii); 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043 (a)(2)(A)(I)(ii)(III); 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.41(b)(2)(iii); 45 C.F.R. \nยงยง 1326.25(a)(3) and 1326.27(b)(ii).  \nMore importantly, the DD and PAIR Acts prohibit such disclosure, as DRNC is obligated \nto maintain the confidentiality of all records and information pertaining to โthe identity of the \nindividualsโฆ who furnish information that forms the basis for a determination that probable \ncause existsโ and those individuals who โprovided information to the P&A for the record.โ 45 \nC.F.R. ยง 1326.28(b)(1)(iii-iv). \nEach court to consider probable cause determinations in the P&A context has held that \nthe P&A, not a provider agency or state agency, is the party who determines whether probable \ncause exists. See, e.g., Arizona Ctr. for Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689, 693 (D. Ariz. \n2000)(โNeither the P&A laws nor the regulations promulgated thereunder contemplate that the \nstate or a service provider will reevaluate the P&Aโs determination of probable cause and deny \naccess to the P&A because the state or service provider disagrees that probable cause exists.โ). \n                                                           \n2 Although not referenced in Plaintiffโs complaint, the third principle statute governing the P&A, the \nProtection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (โthe PAIMI Actโ), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 10801 \net seq., and its implementing regulations, 42 C.F.R. ยงยง 51.1 et seq., contain identical language regarding \nprobable cause determinations. See 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.41(b)(2)(iii) (โโฆand the P&A system has determined \nthat there is probable cause to believe that the individual has been or may be subject to abuse or \nneglect.โ)(emphasis added). \n8 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 8 of 21\n\n \n \nSee also Sonnenberg v.

Further, \nPlaintiff is using its requests for declaratory relief to effect a race to the courthouse, and \nexercising jurisdiction in the present matter would not further judicial efficiency. \nI.  Standard of Review: Discretion Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act \nThe Declaratory Judgment Act provides that โ[i]n a case of actual controversy within its \njurisdictionโฆ any court of the Unites Statesโฆ may declare the rights and other legal relations of \nany interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.โ \n28 U.S.C. ยง 2201(a). A courtโs exercise of jurisdiction under the Act is not compulsory; rather, \nthe Declaratory Judgment Act has โbeen understood to confer on federal courts unique and \nsubstantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights of litigants.โ Wilton v. Seven \nFalls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 286 (1995)(emphasis added). A federal district court has โโgreat latitude \nin determining whether to assert jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions,โ but should \nrefuse to entertain a declaratory judgment only for good cause.โ First Nationwide Mortgage \nCorp. v. FISI Madison, LLC, 219 F. Supp. 2d 669, 672 (D.Md. 2002)(quoting Aetna Cas. & \nSurety Co. v. Quarles, 92 F.2d 321, 324 (4th Cir. 1937)). โA balance must be struck between \nthe... [potential plaintiffโs] traditional interests in choice of forum, timing, and avoiding a race to \nthe courthouseโฆ [and a potential defendantโs] interest in being relieved from the uncertainty and \ninsecurity arising from a controversy.โ State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Taylor, 118 F.R.D. 426, \n430 (M.D.N.C. 1988). In deciding whether to entertain a declaratory action, โa court should \nconsider whether a useful practical purpose will be served thereby; in other words, does the \ndeclaratory plaintiff need the remedy.โ Id. (citing United States v. Jones, 176 F.2d 278, 280 (4th \nCir. 1949)). The factors typically considered by courts include โ(1) whether the action serves the \n10 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 10 of 21\n\n \n \npurpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act; (2) whether the action constitutes procedural fencing; \n(3) judicial efficiency; and (4) fairness to the parties.โ Hipage Co. v. Access2Go, Inc., 589 \nF.Supp.2d 602, 614-615 (E.D. Va. 2008)(internal citations omitted). \nII. Plaintiffโs requests for declaratory relief do not serve the purpose(s) of the Declaratory \nJudgment Act. \na.  Plaintiff seeks an advisory opinion, not the resolution of a controversy. \nJurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act is appropriate only where a justiciable \ncontroversy exists. โThe controversy must be definite and concrete, touching the legal relations \nof parties having adverse legal interests. It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting \nof specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion \nadvising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.โ Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. \nHaworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240-241 (1937)(internal citations omitted). The Act โdoes not exist to \nconvert judicial tribunals into counselors and impose upon them the duty of giving advisory \nopinions to any parties who may come into court and ask for either academic enlightenment or \npractical guidance concerning their legal affairs.โ Klingspor Abrasives, Inc. v. Woolsey, 2009 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 66747, *8, 2009 WL 2397088 (W.D.N.C. 2009). \nThe plain language of Plaintiffโs complaint makes clear it seeks an advisory opinion from \nthis Court. With regard to its FERPA claim, Plaintiff requests โthe Courtโs interpretationโ of the \nrelationship between FERPA and the DD and PAIR Acts, and whether it is required to release \nthe requested information to DRNC โ in other words, practical guidance regarding its behavior. \nAs to the probable cause claim, Plaintiff similarly fails to identify a justiciable controversy; it \nagain seeks an abstract interpretation as to who determines the existence of probable cause in the \ncontext of the DD and PAIR Acts. As discussed more fully in Defendantโs First Argument, the \n11 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 11 of 21\n\n \n \ndispute underlying Plaintiffโs claims is not โof sufficient immediacy to warrant the issuance of a \ndeclaratory judgment, [and] any decision by this Court on this claim would be an improper \nadvisory opinion.โ Krebs v. Charlotte Sch. of Law, LLC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143060, *32 \n(W.D.N.C. Sept. 5, 2017). Therefore, the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the \naction. \nb.  This belated action is inappropriate under the Declaratory Judgment Act, as DRNC \nhas already been injured and its claims are ripe for adjudication. \nDeclaratory actions are designed to clarify the rights of each party so they can tailor their \nconduct to prevent the accrual of damages and to avoid future litigation. At first blush, it would \nseem that a declaratory judgment action is appropriate in the present case, as such relief would \nclarify Plaintiffโs obligations and rights, and avoid actions that would expose it to liability. \nHowever, โa declaratory judgment is unavailable in situations whereโฆ claims and rights asserted \nhave fully matured, and the alleged wrongs have already been committed.โ Trull v. Smolka, \n2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70233, *8, 2008 WL 4279599 (E.D. Va. 2008). Where a declaratory \njudgment โwould do nothing to steer Plaintiff away fromโ the alleged injury to the defendant, โa \ndeclaration from this Court is not consistent with the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act.โ \nTucker Materials, Inc. v. Safesound Acoustics, Inc., 971 F. Supp. 2d 537, 551 (W.D.N.C. 2013).   \nIn the present matter, the alleged wrong has already been committed: Plaintiff has denied \nDRNC access to records to which it is entitled. A judgment from the Court will not prevent \nPlaintiff from injuring DRNC. Therefore, Plaintiffโs request for declaratory relief at this stage \ndoes not serve the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act. \n \n12 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 12 of 21\n\n \n \nc.  This action is inappropriate under the Declaratory Judgment Act, as DRNC has not \nfailed or delayed in litigating its injuries. \nAnother purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to provide โa remedy in situations in \nwhich a dispute has reached the point that a party is entitled to seek a coercive remedy but has \nfailed to do so.โ State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Taylor, 118 F.R.D. 426, 429 (M.D.N.C. \n1988)(emphasis in original). โThe person who may be entitled to coercive relief has traditional \ninterests in choice of forum, timing, and avoiding a race to the courthouse,โ while โthe other \nparty has an interest in being relieved from the uncertainty and insecurity arising from a \ncontroversy.โ Id. at 430. Thus, where the party entitled to bring a coercive action fails or delays \nin bringing it, a declaratory judgment is useful โif it prevents the accrual of damagesโ and/or โif \nit relieves a party from acting at his peril while uncertain of his legal rights because another party \nis yet to bring a coercive action.โ Id. at 429.   \nWhether a party has failed or delayed in bringing a coercive action is a fact-specific \ndetermination. For example, in State Farm v. Taylor, State Farm filed a declaratory judgment \naction three days before notifying the Taylors that their insurance claim was denied. The court \nfound that the Taylors did not fail or delay in bringing a coercive action; instead, they were \ndeprived the opportunity to bring such action. The Taylors filed coercive counterclaims and \nindicated that, should the court dismiss the declaratory judgment action, they intended to initiate \na coercive suit immediately. In dismissing State Farmโs action, the court found that โ[s]ince there \nwas no delay, State Farm did not need relief from uncertainty and insecurity resulting from a \nโcoercive plaintiffโsโ failure to bring an affirmative action.โโ Id. at 430. The court also noted, \nโState Farm has not contended, nor does the Court perceive, a potential for the accrual of \ndamages or the need for State Farm to act at its peril while being uncertain of its rights.โ Id. at \n13 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 13 of 21\n\n \n \n429. See also Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Williams, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3391, 2010 WL 274233 \n(M.D.N.C. 2010)(holding that filing an action for declaratory relief in the midst of ongoing \nsettlement negotiations, โabruptly ending any possibilityโ of settlement, constituted an action in \nanticipation of coercive litigation, and therefore dismissing the case as an improper use of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act.). \nState Farm is analogous to the matter at hand. There is a dispute regarding the partiesโ \nlegal rights and obligations, and one party, DRNC, is entitled to seek a coercive remedy, i.e. an \ninjunction compelling Plaintiff to produce the requested records. DRNC has not failed or delayed \nin bringing such suit. In a letter dated August 9, 2017, Plaintiff stated its belief that FERPA, state \nlaw and CMBOE policies prevent it from providing the information DRNC requested. However, \ncounsel for CMS invited DRNC to discuss the matter further in an attempt to reach a resolution. \nOn August 14, DRNC responded to this invitation, in writing, and asked for a response by \nAugust 16. DRNC explicitly indicated that, should the parties not reach a resolution, DRNC \nintended to pursue litigation. Plaintiff did not respond to the August 14 letter; instead, Plaintiff \nfiled its complaint on August 18. DRNC had no notice of such filing, and initiated its own action \non August 23 (one week after the deadline for the requested response had passed). Disability \nRights NC v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Board of Education, Civil Action No. 3:17-cv-\n00511. DRNC did not fail or delay in filing a coercive action, and Plaintiff did not need relief \nfrom any resulting uncertainty or insecurity.  Nor has Plaintiff demonstrated that it may accrue \ndamages or that it needs to act while still uncertain of its rights. Therefore, Plaintiffโs request for \ndeclaratory relief at this stage does not serve the purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act, and \nthis action should be dismissed. \n14 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 14 of 21\n\n \n \nIII.  Plaintiffโs claims constitute a race to the courthouse in order to test potential defenses, \nwhich is an impermissible use of the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nGenerally, โwhere the same parties have filed similar litigation in separate federal fora, \ndoctrines of federal comity dictate that the matter should proceed in the court where the action \nwas first filed, and that the later-filed action should be stayed, transferred, or enjoined.โ L&H \nTechs., Inc. v. Technosports, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5089, *4, 2006 WL 163622 \n(W.D.N.C. 2006). Where โspecial circumstancesโ exist, an exception to this first-filed rule may \nbe warranted. For example, โthere may be a point at which โthe potential lawsuit that may \notherwise have given rise to a proper declaratory judgment action has become so certain or \nimminent, that the declaratory judgment action is merely an improper act of forum shopping, or a \nrace to the courthouse.โ Id. at *4-5. โIt is well established that courts disfavorโ such races to the \ncourthouse. Hipage Co. v. Access2Go, Inc., 589 F. Supp. 2d 602, 614 (E.D. Va. 2008)(citing \nNautilus Ins. Co. v. Winchester Homes, Inc., 15 F.3d 371, 377 (4th Cir. 1994)).  The Court โmay \nproperly consider the inequity of permitting a declaratory plaintiff to gain precedence in time and \nforum by filing a declaratory action which is merely anticipatory ofโ a defendantโs action. State \nFarm at 430 (emphasis in original).  \nIn Tucker Materials, Inc. v. Safesound Acoustics, Inc., 971 F. Supp. 2d 537 (W.D.N.C. \n2013), this Court found that where the plaintiff was on notice that the defendant planned to \ninitiate litigation against it, โ[t]he procedural fencing and race to the courthouse employed by \nPlaintiff in bringing this action weighs strongly in favor of declining to exercise jurisdiction in \nthis case.โ Id. at 552. Like the plaintiff in that case, Plaintiff CMBOE was on notice, as of \nAugust 3 and again on August 14, of DRNCโs unequivocal intent to litigate the dispute if \nresolution could not be reached. Plaintiff filed the present action on August 16, a mere two days \n15 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 15 of 21\n\n \n \nafter DRNC reiterated its intent to initiate litigation. The timing of Plaintiffโs action demonstrates \nthat it engaged in an improper race to the courthouse. Therefore, Plaintiffโs declaratory actions \nshould be dismissed. \nAnother context in which courts have identified โspecial circumstancesโ supporting an \nexception to the first-filed rule (and therefore dismissal of a declaratory action) is the use of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act to improperly race to the courthouse in order to test the viability of a \ndefense. Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740 (1998)(holding a party cannot use the Declaratory \nJudgment Act โto gain a litigation defense by obtaining a ruling on an affirmative defense.โ). \nโThe anticipation of defenses is not a proper purpose of the declaratory remedy because it would \nlead to a race to the courthouse.โ State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Taylor, 118 F.R.D. 426, 431 \n(M.D.N.C. 1988). This Court has expressed the view โthat where a declaratory plaintiff raises \nchiefly an affirmative defense, and it appears that granting relief could effectively deny an \nallegedly injured party its otherwise legitimate choice of the forum and time for suit, no \ndeclaratory judgment should issue.โ Tucker Materials at 552 (internal citations omitted).  \nState Farm v. Taylor is again analogous to the matter at hand. In seeking a declaration \nregarding its liability under a policy issued to the Taylors, โState Farm simply anticipated the \ndefense it would assert against the Taylors and outraced them to the courthouse before giving \nthem notice of denial.โ 118 F.R.D. 426, 430. The court found this particularly compelling in \ngranting the Taylorsโ motion to dismiss, writing โthe anticipation of defenses is not ordinarily a \nproper use of the declaratory judgment procedure. It deprives the plaintiff of his traditional \nchoice of forum and timing, and it provokes a disorderly race to the courthouse.โ Id. at 429-430. \nSimilarly, in Tucker Materials, a building supply company brought suit against an installation \nagency. The supply company sought a declaration that it had not violated state consumer \n16 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 16 of 21\n\n \n \nprotection and/or federal antitrust law. In dismissing the action, this Court observed that \nโ[c]ourts have nearly uniformly held that declaratory relief is inappropriate in cases such as this \nwhere an alleged tortfeasor sues the insured party for a declaration of nonliability in anticipation \nof suit.โ 971 F. Supp. 2d 537, 552. This Court found that โ[a]t the time Plaintiff brought this \naction, [Plaintiff] was on notice that Defendant was planning on initiating litigation against it for \nalleged violations of Chapter 75 [state consumer protection laws]. The procedural fencing and \nrace to the courthouse employed by Plaintiff in bringing this action weighs strongly in favor of \ndeclining to exercise jurisdiction in this case.โ Id. at 552.  \nLike the plaintiff in State Farm, Plaintiff in this case has simply anticipated the defenses \nit might assert in a coercive action filed by DRNC โ that disclosure of the requested information \nis prohibited by FERPA, and that DRNC lacks probable cause to access the information โ and \noutraced DRNC to the courthouse in order to convert those defenses into an action for \ndeclaratory judgment. Similar to the plaintiff in Tucker Materials, Plaintiff was on notice, as \nrecently as two days before initiating this action, that DRNC intended to litigate the dispute if \nresolution could not be reached. The timing of Plaintiffโs action demonstrates that it engaged in \nan improper race to the courthouse. Therefore, Plaintiffโs declaratory actions should be \ndismissed. \nIV.  Judicial efficiency will not be served by granting jurisdiction over Plaintiffโs claims. \nDeclaratory judgment is not intended to permit parties to โtry a controversy by piecemeal, \nor to try particular issues without settling the entire controversy.โ Alphatronix, Inc. v. Pinnacle \nMicro, Inc., 814 F. Supp. 455, 456 (M.D.N.C. 1993)(citing Mitcheson v. Harris, 955 F.2d 235, \n239 (4th Cir. 1992)). โA court may be induced to deny declaratory relief if the judgment sought \nwould not settle the controversy between the parties; such relief is not to be used to try a case by \n17 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 17 of 21\n\n \n \npiecemeal.โ State Farm at 430. โA contrary view would promote a disorderly race to the \ncourthouse. It would create an environment in which parties to disputes would feel the urgency \nto file a lawsuit lest they lose a tactical advantage. Such an environment would discourage the \nprelitigation settlement of disputes and thus prejudice judicial economy.โ  Id. at 431; see also \nHipage Co., 589 F.Supp.2d 602, 614 (E.D. Va. 2008). \nKlingspor Abrasives, Inc. v. Woolsey is instructive, though based upon the State version \nof the Declaratory Judgment Act, not the federal Act. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66747, 2009 WL \n2397088 (W.D.N.C. 2009). In that case, Woolsey filed a charge of discrimination against \nKlinspor with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging he was terminated \nbased on his age and his opposition to discriminatory actions against older employees and \nfemales. Klingspor sought a declaration that it had not unlawfully discriminated against \nWoolsey. This Court held โdeclaratory judgment should not be invoked to try a controversy by \npiecemeal, or to try particular issues without settling the entire controversy. This is especially so \nwhere a separate suit has been filed, or is likely to be filed, that will more fully encompass the \nscope of the entire controversy.โ Id. at *8-9. See Tucker Materials, 971 F. Supp. 2d 537, 551 \n(holding that, among other factors, because a declaratory judgment โwould do nothing to address \nthe breach of contract or some of the additional torts asserted by Defendant,โ dismissal of the \naction was appropriate). \nPlaintiffโs declaratory judgment action in the present case is the embodiment of \npiecemeal litigation. Resolution of Plaintiffโs claims would not settle the entire controversy \nbetween the parties.  For example, should this Court hold that the P&A alone determines \nprobable cause, the question remains as to whether, in the present case, Plaintiff is required to \nproduce the information requested. Plaintiff may still seek to defend its failure to produce the \n18 \n \nCase 3:17-cv-00498-RJC-DSC   Document 8   Filed 09/15/17   Page 18 of 21\n\n \n \ninformation by, e.g., invoking state and federal confidentiality requirements. Such assertions by \nPlaintiff would necessitate further judicial review to determine whether DRNC is entitled to \naccess the requested information. As DRNC has filed an action that will more completely \nencompass the full scope of the controversy, that action is the appropriate forum for resolution. \nAs both Plaintiffโs Civil Action (498) and DRNCโs subsequent Civil Action (511) were \nfiled in this forum, the Court may consider that consolidation is a potential remedy. However, \nconsolidation would not serve judicial efficiency. It would merely combine the two matters, \nresulting in confusion and a lack of clear delineation as to the parties (CMBOE would become \nboth Plaintiff and Consolidated Defendant; DRNC would be both Defendant and Consolidated \nPlaintiff). Judicial economy can be most effectively served if the present Civil Action (498) is \nswept aside and litigation of the issues proceeds in a recognized framework (i.e. Civil Action \n511), where the P&A demands access to information and records, and the service provider raises \nwhat it deems to be appropriate defenses. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendant has shown that Plaintiff has not met its burden to establish standing in the \npresent case. Defendant has also shown good cause as to why this Court should not exercise \njurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Defendant thus requests the Court grant \njudgment in its favor, and grant Defendantโs Motion to Dismiss. \nRespectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Kristine L. Sullivan_________ \nKristine L. Sullivan, N.C.

      "text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA  \nCHARLOTTE DIVISION \nCIVIL ACTION NO. 3:17-cv-00498 \n \nCHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG  ) \nBOARD OF EDUCATION,  ) \n  ) \nPlaintiff and Consolidated  )   \nDefendant,                       )     \n  )  MOTION FOR  \nv.  )  PROTECTIVE ORDER   \n  ) \nDISABILITY RIGHTS NORTH  ) \nCAROLINA,  ) \n  ) \nDefendant and Consolidated  ) \nPlaintiff.  ) \n \n   \nDefendant/Consolidated Plaintiff, by and through counsel and pursuant to Rule 26 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, submits this Motion for Protective Order as to Plaintiffโs First \nCombined Requests for Admissions, Interrogatories and Requests for Production (โPlaintiffโs First \nCombined Requestsโ). In support hereof, Defendant shows the Court the following: \n1.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (โCMBOEโ) operates the system of \npublic schools serving Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, including the Metro School, which \nserves only students with disabilities, most of whom have limited verbal communication skills. \n2.  Disability Rights North Carolina (โDRNCโ) is the designated Protection and \nAdvocacy system (โP&Aโ) for North Carolina. Each State and U.S. Territory has a designated \nP&A pursuant to federal law. 42 U.S.C. ยง 15043. \n3.  DRNC notified CMBOE that, in its role as the P&A, it had received a complaint \nregarding alleged abuse and/or neglect of students at Metro School. DRNC also determined that \nthere is probable cause to believe such abuse and/or neglect had occurred. DRNC therefore \nasserted its statutory authority to access the names and contact information for the parents or \n  1 \n\nguardians of students enrolled in the Metro School. \n4.  CMBOE filed this action on August 18, 2017, seeking a declaratory judgment \nregarding the standard under which DRNC can assert it has determined there is probable cause to \nbelieve that abuse or neglect has occurred at Metro School.  \n5.  On August 23, 2017, DRNC, unaware of CMBOEโs lawsuit, filed its own action \nseeking declaratory and injunctive relief requiring CMBOE to provide the requested names and \ncontact information. \n6.  On October 29, 2018, CMBOE sent by email Plaintiffโs First Combined Requests. \n(Exhibit A.) \n7.  On November 29, 2018, DRNC submitted its Response to Plaintiffโs First \nCombined Requests. DRNC objected to a number of the Requests, as CMBOE sought information \nthat is protected under the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, and the \nconfidentiality protections (hereinafter โthe P&A privilegeโ) of the Developmental Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act (โthe DD Actโ), 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 15001 et seq. and the Protection \nand Advocacy of Individual Rights Program (โthe PAIR Actโ), 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e. \n8.  On January 18, 2019, CMBOE sent by email a request for supplemental responses, \nseeking the information DRNC declined to provide in its Response.  \n9.  The information sought is: \nโข  The number of complaints, and the date(s) on which DRNC received, a \ncomplaint(s) regarding the alleged improper use of assistive technology devices at \nMetro School; \nโข  The identity of any person, excluding clients, who has knowledge regarding the \nreceived complaint(s) or the records CMBOE provided in response to DRNCโs \nrequest of June 7, 2017; \n  2 \n\nโข  The facts underlying DRNCโs basis for its determination that probable cause exists \nto believe abuse or neglect has occurred; and \nโข  DRNC records, including electronic files from and about an individual(s) reporting \nan allegation of abuse or neglect; notes and files of non-attorney advocates working \nunder the supervision of an attorney; and waivers or release forms obtained as part \nof DRNCโs investigation. \n10.  The parties conferred by telephone on the afternoon of January 28, 2019, as to \nDRNCโs position that CMBOE is not permitted to obtain the requested documents and \ninformation, as it is privileged and/or protected by the work product doctrine. \n11.  The parties determined during the telephone conference that they were unable to \nresolve this dispute regarding discovery. DRNC files this Motion for Protective Order as a result. \nLegal Framework: \n12.  A protective order is available to a party for good cause shown, and the Court may \norder, among other things, that the discovery will not be had, that the discovery will be available \nonly on specified terms, that the discovery may only be had by a different method of discovery \nother than the one sought, or that the scope will be limited. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c). The Court has \ndiscretion in ruling on a Motion for Protective Order. M&M Medical Supplies and Serv. Inc. v. \nPleasant Valley Hospital, Inc., 981 F.2d 160, 163 (4th Cir. 1992). \n13.  The scope of discovery is limited to โany nonprivileged matter that is relevant to \nany partyโs claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). In \nother words, the party is not entitled to discovery of irrelevant information. \n14.  CMBOEโs discovery request seeks information that is irrelevant to its claims and \ndefenses. At its core, this litigation asks the Court to determine who is the final arbiter of probable \ncause as between the P&A (DRNC) and the service provider (CMBOE). As a matter of statutory \n  3 \n\ninterpretation, the underlying facts of the probable cause determination are immaterial and \ntherefore not discoverable. \n15.  CMBOEโs discovery request also seeks information that is privileged. As DRNC \nreceived one or more complaints alleging abuse or neglect pursuant to a confidential \ncommunication with a client(s), such information is subject to the attorney-client privilege. \n(Sullivan Aff. ยถ 3.) Similarly, any communication from an individual to a DRNC attorney, or non-\nattorney advocate working under the supervision of a DRNC attorney, made for the purpose of \nobtaining a legal opinion or legal services, constitutes a communication from a client and is also \nprivileged.  \n16.  The information sought by CMBOE is also protected by the P&A privilege. The \nP&A is required to keep confidential all records and information, including the identity of an \nindividual who reports abuse or neglect, or who furnishes information that forms the basis of a \nprobable cause determination, and the names of individuals who provided information to the P&A \nโfor the record.โ 45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.28(b)(1). Further, โrecords maintained by the P&A system are \nthe property of the P&A system which must protect them from loss, damage, tampering, [or] \nunauthorized use.โ ยง 1326.28(b). All records and information maintained by DRNC are protected \nby this P&A privilege and therefore not subject to discovery. \n17.  Attorney work product is normally not discoverable. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A). \nCMBOE seeks information that constitutes attorney work product, specifically information \ncontained in a memorandum developed by DRNC attorneys outlining the basis for its probable \ncause determination. (Sullivan Aff. ยถยถ 6-9.) \n18.  Attorney work product may be subject to discovery where the party requesting the \nmaterials demonstrates โit has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, \nwithout undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. \n  4 \n\n26(b)(3)(A)(ii). As the facts underlying a complaint(s) or probable cause determination are \nirrelevant to the statutory interpretation sought from the Court, CMBOE does not have a \nsubstantial need for the information it seeks to discover. \n19.  Finally, a party is not entitled to discovery of documents and information where \nthat discovery would essentially grant the party the substantive relief it requests, i.e. disclosure of \nthe documents and information that is purportedly not subject to disclosure. See, e.g., Hill v. Exec. \nOffice for United States Attys., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187968 (W.D. Va. 2017); Local 3, Intโl \nBhd. of Elec. Workers v. NLRB, 845 F.2d 1177 (2d Cir. 1988); Pollard v. FBI, 705 F.2d 1151 (9th \nCir. 1983). \n20.  CMBOEโs discovery request seeks the same information as the remedy in this \nmatter, i.e. information that relates to a complaint(s) received by or probable cause determination \nmade by DRNC. Thus, the information CMBOE seeks is not within the realm of discovery. Even \nif it were, the information is privileged and/or constitutes work product, and DRNC is therefore \nprohibited from providing it to CMBOE. As such, CMBOE is not entitled to discovery of the \ninformation.  \nWHEREFORE, Defendant respectfully submits that Defendantโs Motion for Protective \nOrder should be granted. \nThis the 29th day of January, 2019. \n/s/ Kristine L.

No. 49), and Defendantโs Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. No. \n50).  Plaintiff Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (โPlaintiffโ or โCMBEโ) \ncontrols  and  operates  Mecklenburg  County  public  schools,  including  the  Metro \nSchool.  Metro serves students who are cognitively disabled.  Defendant Disability \nRights of North Carolina (โDefendantโ or โDRNCโ) is a private organization that has \nbeen designated as the Protection and Advocacy Agency (โP&Aโ) for the State of \nNorth Carolina.  The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act \n(โDDAโ) and the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Program (โPAIRโ) \nauthorize a P&A to have access to records of individuals with disabilities under \ncertain circumstances.  One such circumstance is when the P&A has probable cause \nto believe that an individual has been or may be subject to abuse or neglect.  DRNC \ndetermined that it had such probable cause as to all Metro students and requested \n\nthat CMBE provide certain records and information, including the names of and \ncontact information for the parents or guardians of all students.  CMBE refused to \nprovide the requested parent name and contact information, contending that the \nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (โFERPAโ) prohibited it from doing so.  \nCMBE also contended that DRNCโs stated basis for its probable cause determination \nwas insufficient under the DDA and PAIR.  Through this action, the parties ask the \nCourt to interpret these statutes and the partiesโ respective obligations thereunder.    \nI.  BACKGROUND \nOn June 7, 2017, DRNC sent a letter to CMBE stating, in relevant part, that \nDRNC โreceived a complaint regarding improper use of restraint, including but not \nlimited to wheelchairs and other assistive technology devices, at Metroโ and thus was \nโconducting an investigation into student care and treatment.โ  (Doc. No. 10, at Ex. \n1.)  DRNC requested that CMBE provide the individual education plans (โIEPsโ) for \nall students at Metro and copies of all forms, waivers, and other parental permission \ngiven to the school for the use of wheelchairs or other devices.1  In the alternative, \nDRNC requested the names of and contact information for the parents or guardians \n(โparent name and contact informationโ) of each student enrolled at Metro so that \nDRNC could contact the parents or guardians to obtain consent to the release of \ncomplete records.  \n  At some point, DRNC initiated monitoring activities at Metro.  Thereafter, on \n                                                 \n1 DRNC requested that all personally identifiable information be redacted and that \nCMBE include only those portions of the IEPs that describe the use of assistive \ntechnology, seclusion, and/or restraint.  (Doc. No. 10, at Ex. 1.)  \n2 \n \n\nJune 16, 2017, DRNC sent an email to CMBE stating:  \nFor some of the students, [DRNC] has received a complaint of alleged \nabuse or neglect, and seeks the requested records based upon such a \ncomplaint. . . .  For  the  remainder  of  the  students . . . [DRNC]  has \ndetermined that there is probable cause to believe that the students may \nhave  been,  or  may  be,  subjected  to  abuse/neglect.    Based  on  the \ninformation provided to [DRNC] and [DRNCโs] observations during the \nmonitoring visit (including the extensive number of wheelchairs, Rifton \nchairs,2 and other devices present in Metroโs classrooms that constitute \na restraint), [DRNC] finds there is a reasonable ground to believe that \nall  of  the  other  students  at  Metro have  been  or  may  be  subject  to \nabuse/neglect.  Therefore, [DRNC] is entitled to obtain the requested \nrecords for all students at Metro. \n \n(Doc. No. 10, at Ex. 7.)  \n  On July 13, 2017, CMBE mailed to DRNC the redacted IEPs of all Metro \nstudents.  (Doc. No. 10, ยถ 20; Doc. No. 25, ยถ 20.)   \n  On August 3, 2017, DRNC sent a letter to CMBE stating that it had probable \ncause to believe that abuse or neglect occurred at Metro and requested parent name \nand contact information for all students.  (Doc. No. 10, at Ex. 4.) \n  On August 9, 2017, CMBE sent a response letter to DRNC denying DRNCโs \nrequest for parent name and contact information for all students.  (Doc. No. 10, at Ex. \n5.)  CMBE requested additional information underlying DRNCโs probable cause \ndetermination.  CMBE stated that its position was that โDRNC is not entitled to \nparent or guardian contact information due to the protections guaranteed to [its] \nstudents under FERPA, North Carolina privacy laws, and CMS board policies.โ  (Doc. \nNo. 10, at Ex. 5.)  \n                                                 \n2  A  Rifton  chair  is  an  activity  chair  for  individuals  with  disabilities.    See \nhttps://www.rifton.com/products/special-needs-chairs/rifton-activity-chairs.  \n3 \n \n\n  On August 14, 2017, DRNC sent a letter to CMBE in which it provided a \nโlimited summary of the information underlying [its] probable cause determinationโ \nas follows:  \nDuring visits to Metro School, [DRNC] staff members observed students \nbeing transported throughout the school in wheelchairs.  [They] learned \nthat many of these students are capable of ambulating and do not \nrequire the use of a wheelchair.  Instead, the wheelchairs were used for \nโsafetyโ and the convenience of staff.  Such use of a wheelchair is an \ninappropriate  form  of  restraint.    During  these  visits,  [DRNC]  staff \nmembers observed students sitting in Rifton chairs.  [They] learned that \nfor many of these students, the Rifton chairs do not serve as adaptive \nequipment or assistive technology.  Instead, they are used to contain the \nstudents and โkeep them stillโ during classroom instruction.  Such use of \na Rifton chair is an inappropriate form of restraint.  [DRNC] received \ninformation  indicating  that  these  practices  are  fairly  commonplace.  \nTherefore, [DRNC] determined that there is probable cause to believe \nstudents at Metro School have been subjected to the use of inappropriate \nrestraint, and thus to abuse and/or neglect. \n \n(Doc. No. 10, at Ex. 6.)  \n  CMBE initiated this action on August 18, 2017.  CMBEโs first claim seeks a \ndeclaratory judgment that FERPA prohibits CMBE from providing to DRNC parent \nname and contact information for all Metro students.  (Doc. No. 10, at 7โ8, 11.)  \nCMBEโs second claim seeks a declaratory judgment that DRNC does not have a \nsufficient factual basis for its determination that it has probable cause to believe all \nMetro students have been or may be subject to abuse or neglect and, thus, CMBE is \nnot required to provide the requested parent name and contact information.  (Doc. \nNo. 10, at 8โ11.) \n  On August 23, 2017, DRNC initiated a separate action against CMBE, which \nwas consolidated with this action on November 9, 2017.  (Doc. No. 20.)  DRNC seeks \n4 \n \n\ndeclaratory  and  injunctive  relief  under  the  DDA,  PAIR,  and  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983.  \nSpecifically, DRNC seeks (1) a declaratory judgment that CMBEโs refusal to provide \nthe requested information violates the DDA and PAIR and (2) permanent injunctive \nrelief requiring CMBE to provide parent name and contact information for all Metro \nstudents.  (No. 3:17-cv-00511-RJC-DSC, Doc. No. 1, at 8.)  \n  On September 6, 2019, the parties moved for summary judgment on all claims \nand issues.3  On November 26, 2019, the Court held oral argument on the pending \nmotions.  Having been fully briefed and argued, these motions are now ripe for \nadjudication.  \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nSummary judgment shall be granted โif the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  A factual dispute is genuine if the evidence is \nsuch that a reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  See \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  A fact is material only if \nit might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.  Id.  The movant has the \nโinitial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and \nidentifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand  admissions  on  file,  together  with  the  affidavits,  if  any,  which  it  believes \ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.โ  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n                                                 \n3 Both partiesโ briefs make clear that they each move for summary judgment on all \nclaims.  (Doc. No. 49-1, at 1; Doc. No. 50-1, at 4.) \n5 \n \n\n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (quotation marks omitted).  This โburden on the moving \nparty may be discharged by showingโthat is, pointing out to the district courtโthat \nthere is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving partyโs case.โ  Id. at 325 \n(quotation marks omitted).   \n  Once this initial burden is met, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party, \nwhich โmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.โ  \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 250.  The nonmoving party may not rely upon mere allegations \nor denials of allegations in the pleadings to defeat a motion for summary judgment; \nrather, it must present sufficient evidence from which โa reasonable [factfinder] could \nreturn a verdict for the nonmoving party.โ  Id. at 248; accord Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. \nCalvert Cty., 48 F.3d 810, 818 (4th Cir. 1995).   \nWhen ruling on a summary judgment motion, a court must view the evidence \nand any inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  \nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 255.  โWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a \nrational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for \ntrial.โ  Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 586 (2009) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. \nCo. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)).  The mere argued existence of a \nfactual dispute does not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion.  Anderson, \n477 U.S. at 248โ49.  โIf the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly \nprobative,โ summary judgment is appropriate.  Id. at 249โ50 (citations omitted). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nThe motions raise two main issues.  First, does FERPA prohibit CMBE from \n6 \n \n\nproviding to DRNC parent name and contact information for all Metro students?  And \nsecond, does DRNC have a sufficient factual basis for its determination that it has \nprobable cause to believe all Metro students have been or may be subject to abuse or \nneglect?  \nA.  FERPA does not prohibit CMBE from providing to DRNC parent name \nand contact information for all Metro students.  \n \nCMBE argues that FERPA prohibits it from releasing parent name and contact \ninformation,  notwithstanding  the  DDA  and  PAIR.    DRNC  agrees  that  FERPA \ngenerally prohibits CMBE from releasing parent name and contact information; \nhowever, DRNC argues that the DDA and PAIR provide a limited override of FERPA \nsuch  that  CMBE  must  release  parent  name  and  contact  information  when  the \nrequirements for access to such information under the DDA and PAIR are satisfied.  \nThe Court concludes that it need not reach the issue of whether the DDA and PAIR \nprovide a limited override of FERPA because FERPA and the DDA/PAIR are not in \nconflictโthat is, FERPA does not prohibit CMBE from providing to DRNC parent \nname and contact information where DRNC has satisfied the prerequisites for access \nto such information under the DDA and PAIR.  \nA courtโs objective in all cases of statutory interpretation is โto ascertain and \nimplement the intent of Congress, and Congressโs intent can most easily be seen in \nthe text of the Acts it promulgates.โ  Aziz v. Alcolac, Inc., 658 F.3d 388, 392 (4th Cir. \n2011) (quotation marks omitted).  Thus, a courtโs inquiry begins with โthe plain \nmeaning of the statutory language.โ  Schilling v. Schmidt Baking Co., 876 F.3d 596, \n601 (4th Cir. 2017).  โWhen a term goes undefined in a statute, [courts] give the term \n7 \n \n\nits ordinary meaning.โ  Kouichi Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.S. 560, 566 \n(2012).  Courts frequently turn to dictionaries for help in determining a termโs \nordinary meaning.  Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 (2015); Johnson v. \nZimmer, 686 F.3d 224, 232 (4th Cir. 2012).  โIn interpreting the plain language of the \nstatute, [courts] also look to the specific context in which the language is used, and \nthe broader context of the statute as a whole.โ  Hurlburt v. Black, 925 F.3d 154, 158 \n(4th Cir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court has โstated time and \nagain that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means \nand  means  in  a  statute  what  it  says  there.    When  the  words  of  a  statute  are \nunambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is complete.โ  \nUnited States v. Hager, 721 F.3d 167, 182 (4th Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted) \n(quoting Conn. Natโl Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253โ54 (1992)).  โOn the other \nhand,  if  the  text  of  a  statute  is  ambiguous,  [courts]  look  to  other  indicia  of \ncongressional intent such as the legislative history to interpret the statute.โ  Lee v. \nNorfolk S. Ry., 802 F.3d 626, 631 (4th Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted).  A statute \nis ambiguous if โit lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation.โ  Newport \nNews Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. Brown, 376 F.3d 245, 248 (4th Cir. 2004). \nFERPA provides that โ[n]o funds shall be made available under any applicable \nprogram to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of \nreleasing, or providing access to, any personally identifiable information,โ which \nincludes parent name and contact information.4  20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g(b)(2) (emphasis \n                                                 \n4 FERPA provides specific exceptions allowing release of information, none of which \n8 \n \n\nadded); 34 C.F.R. ยง 99.3 (defining โpersonally identifiable informationโ).  Around the \ntime of FERPAโs enactment, โpolicyโ was defined as โa definite course of action \nadopted for the sake of expediency, facility, etc.,โ and โpracticeโ was defined as \nโhabitual or customary performance; operationโ and โhabit; custom.โ  The Random \nHouse Dictionary of the English Language 1113, 1128 (1971).   \nConsistent  with  these  definitions  of  โpolicyโ  and  โpractice,โ  courts  have \nrecognized that โthe language of [FERPA], on its face, appears to limit its prohibition \nto those situations where an educational agency has a policy or practice of permitting \nthe release of education records.โ  Ellis v. Cleveland Mun. Sch. Dist., 309 F. Supp. 2d \n1019, 1023 (N.D. Ohio 2004) (quotation marks omitted); see also Gonzaga Univ. v. \nDoe, 536 U.S. 273, 288 (2002) (โFERPAโs nondisclosure provisions further speak only \nin terms of institutional policy and practice, not individual instances of disclosure.โ).  \nโ[T]he requirement placed on the participating institution is not that it must prevent \nthe unauthorized release of education records, . . . but that it cannot improperly \nrelease such records as a matter of policy or practice.โ  Gundlach v. Reinstein, 924 F. \nSupp.  684,  692  (E.D.  Penn.  1996).    Indeed,  โFERPA  was  designed  to  address \nsystematic, not individual, violations of studentsโ privacy by unauthorized releases of \nsensitive information in their educational records.โ  Ellis, 309 F. Supp. 2d at 1023 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, an educational agency does not violate \nFERPA by releasing records or information unless it does so pursuant to an official \npolicy or practice.  Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of N.Y., 287 F.3d 138, 151 (2d Cir. 2002) \n                                                 \nare applicable here.  \n9 \n \n\n(affirming dismissal of FERPA claim where plaintiff alleged that defendants released \ninformation in violation of FERPA but failed to allege that defendants had a policy or \npractice of permitting unauthorized release of educational records or information); \nAchman v. Chisago Lakes Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 2144, 45 F. Supp. 2d 664, 674 (D. \nMinn.  1999)  (concluding  that  an  educational  agency  did  not  violate  FERPA  by \nreleasing  educational  records  without  parental  consent  because  there  was  no \nevidence that the agency had a policy or practice of releasing such records).  \nHere, CMBE claims that FERPA prohibits it from ever disclosing parent name \nand contact information unless a specific exception under FERPA appliesโthere is \nno allegation or evidence that CMBE has a policy or practice of releasing parent name \nand contact information (or any other information covered by FERPA).  As FERPA \nonly prohibits the release of records and information pursuant to a policy or practice, \nFERPA does not prohibit CMBE from releasing to DRNC parent name and contact \ninformation  when  DRNC  has  satisfied  the  prerequisites  for  access  to  such \ninformation under the DDA and PAIR.  Therefore, the Court denies CMBEโs Motion \nfor Summary Judgment as to its first claim for a declaratory judgment and grants \nDRNCโs Motion for Summary Judgment as to this claim.  \nB.  DRNC has failed to come forward with any evidence to support its \nprobable cause determination as to all Metro students. \n \nCMBE & DRNC disagree as to whether DRNCโs stated basis is sufficient under \nthe DDA and PAIR for its determination that it has probable cause to believe all \nMetro students have been or may be subject to abuse or neglect.  \nCongress  enacted  the  DDA  โin  response  to  the  inhumane  and  despicable \n10 \n \n\ncondition in which persons with developmental disabilities were living.โ  Arizona Ctr. \nfor Disability Law v. Allen, 197 F.R.D. 689, 692 (D. Az. 2000).  The DDA โoffers States \nfederal money to improve community services . . . for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities.โ  Va. Office for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 250 (2011).  \nโIn return, the DDA requires each state to establish a [P&A] that is authorized to \ninvestigate reports of abuse and neglect of people with developmental disabilities, to \nremedy rights violations, and to provide other advocacy services.โ  Allen, 197 F.R.D. \nat 692.  Under PAIR, these protections were extended to people with disabilities \ngenerally.  Id.  To receive funding under PAIR, a state must establish a P&A that has \nthe same general authorities as set forth in the DDA.  29 U.S.C. ยง 794e; Disability \nRights Wis., Inc. v. State Depโt of Pub. Instruction, 463 F.3d 719, 725 (7th Cir. 2006).   \nThe DDA and PAIR contain three provisions granting a P&A access to records, \nonly one of which is applicable here.  Under this provision, a P&A shall have access \nto all records of any individual with a disability when: (1) the individual has a legal \nguardian,  conservator,  or  other  legal  representative;  (2)  a  complaint  has  been \nreceived by the P&A about the individual with regard to the status or treatment of \nthe  individual  or,  as  a  result  of  monitoring  or  other  activities,  the  P&A  has \ndetermined that โthere is probable cause to believe that such individual has been \nsubject to abuse or neglectโ; (3) the P&A, upon receipt of the name of and contact \ninformation for the parent or guardian, has contacted the individualโs parent or \nguardian; (4) the P&A has offered assistance to the individualโs parent or guardian \nto resolve the situation; and (5) the parent or guardian has failed or refused to provide \n11 \n \n\nconsent on behalf of the individual.  42 U.S.C. ยง 15043(a)(2)(I)(iii); 29 U.S.C. ยง 794e; \n45  C.F.R.  ยง  1326.25(a)(3);  Conn.

The \nimplementing  regulations  for  the  DDA  and  PAIR  expressly  provide  that \nโ[e]ducational  agencies . . . must  provide  a  P&A  with  the  name  of  and  contact \ninformation for the parent or guardian of a student for whom the P&A has probable \ncause to obtain records under the [DDA and PAIR].โ  45 C.F.R. ยง 1326.25(f).  \nโProbable causeโ is defined as  \na reasonable ground for belief that an individual with developmental \ndisability(ies) has been, or may be, subject to abuse or neglect . . . .  The \nindividual  making  such  determination  may  base  the  decision  on \nreasonable inferences drawn from his or her experience or training \nregarding similar incidents, conditions or problems that are usually \nassociated with abuse or neglect.   \n \nId. ยง 1326.19.  โAbuseโ is defined as โany act or failure to act which was performed, \nor which was failed to be performed, knowingly, recklessly, or intentionally, and \nwhich  caused,  or  may  have  caused,  injury  or  death  to  an  individual  with \ndevelopmental disabilitiesโ and specifically includes โthe use of bodily or chemical \nrestraints which is not in compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations.โ  \nId.  โNeglectโ is defined as โa negligent act or omission by an individual responsible \nfor providing services, supports or other assistance which caused or may have caused \ninjury or death to an individual with a developmental disability(ies) or which placed \nan individual with developmental disability(ies) at risk of injury or death.โ  Id. \n  It is well settled that as between a P&A and a custodian from whom records or \ninformation is sought, โa P&A is the final arbiter of probable cause for the purpose of \n12 \n \n\ntriggering its authority to access all records for an individual that may have been \nsubject to abuse or neglect.โ  Allen, 197 F.R.D. at 693; Disability Rights Ohio v. \nBuckeye Ranch, Inc., 375 F.

At the same time, \nhowever,  a  P&Aโs  probable  cause  determination  is  subject  to  judicial  review.  \nDevelopmental Disabilities Program, 80 Fed.

Iowa 2001) \n(stating that the custodian was not barred from seeking judicial review of the P&Aโs \ndetermination that it had probable cause as to all residents of the custodianโs facility). \n  Here, DRNC contends that it has probable cause to believe that every student \n13 \n \n\nat Metro has been or may be subject to abuse or neglect because it observed students \nbeing transported throughout the school in wheelchairs and students sitting in Rifton \nchairs,  but  learned  that  โmany  of  these  studentsโ  do  not  require  the  use  of  a \nwheelchair or a Rifton chair.  Instead, the wheelchairs were used for safety and staff \nconvenience, and the Rifton chairs were used to contain the students and keep them \nstill during classroom instruction.  DRNC states that such uses of a wheelchair and \na Rifton chair are inappropriate forms of restraint and that it โreceived information \nindicating that these practices are fairly commonplace.โ  (Doc. No. 10, at Ex. 6.)  Thus, \nDRNC concluded it had probable cause to believe all students at Metro have been or \nmay be subject to abuse or neglect.  \n  The Court concludes that DRNC has failed to provide a sufficient factual basis \nfor its determination that it has probable cause to believe all students at Metro have \nbeen or may be subject to abuse or neglect.  The bare facts that a wheelchair or a \nRifton chair was unnecessarily used for โmanyโ students and that such use is โfairly \ncommonplaceโ  is  insufficient  to  allow  this  Court  to  conclude  that  DRNC  has  a \nreasonable ground to believe that every student at Metro has been or may be subject \nto abuse or neglect.   \nMoreover, even if these facts were sufficient, DRNC has not come forward with \nany evidence to support these factsโit merely argues that it determined it had \nprobable cause as to all students based on these facts, informed CMBE of these facts, \nand CMBE was thus required to release parent name and contact information.5  J.S. \n                                                 \n5 During the hearing, DRNC stated that, if necessary, it could submit evidence to \n14 \n \n\nTarwater Developmental Ctr., 97 F.3d at 495 (reviewing transcript of anonymous \nphone call that provided basis for the P&Aโs probable cause determination); Buckeye \nRanch, Inc., 375 F. Supp. 3d at 890โ91 (stating that both parties submitted the \nevidence used by the P&A in concluding that it had a factual basis for its probable \ncause determination and thus the case was not one where the P&A failed to come \nforward with any factual support for its probable cause determination); Discovery \nAcad., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 410, at *14, *16 (granting the custodianโs motion for \nsummary judgment where the P&A failed to come forward with any evidence to \nsupport its probable cause  determination); Pa. Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Royer-\nGreaves Sch. for Blind, No. 98-3995, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4609, at *26โ27 (E.D. \nPenn. Mar. 25, 1999) (denying the P&Aโs motion for summary judgment and entering \nsummary judgment in favor of the custodian where the P&A had failed to come \nforward with any evidence to support a finding of probable cause).   \nIn short, the basis DRNC communicated to CMBE is insufficient to support \nDRNCโs probable cause determination as to all Metro students, and DRNC has failed \nto come forward with any evidence to support its probable cause determination. \nTherefore, the Court grants CMBEโs Motion for Summary Judgment as to its second \nclaim and DRNCโs claims, and denies DRNCโs Motion for Summary Judgment as to \nits claims and CMBEโs second claim.  \nsupport its probable cause determination for in camera review.  DRNC has had ample \nopportunity to submit evidence in support of its motion and in opposition to CMBEโs \nmotion as required by Rule 56, but at no time sought to submit such evidence for in \ncamera review or otherwise.     \n15 \n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that CMBEโs Motion for Summary Judgment,\n(Doc.  No.  49),  and  DRNCโs  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  (Doc.  No.  50),  are \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part as follows: \n1. As to CMBEโs first claim for a declaratory judgment, the Court DENIES\nCMBEโs Motion for Summary Judgment and GRANTS DRNCโs Motion\nfor Summary Judgment.  CMBEโs first claim is DISMISSED.\n2. As  to  CMBEโs  second  claim  for  a  declaratory  judgment,  the  Court\nGRANTS  CMBEโs  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  and  DENIES\nDRNCโs Motion for Summary Judgment.  DRNC has failed to come\nforward with any evidence to support its determination that it has\nprobable cause to believe all Metro students have been or may be subject\nto abuse or neglect.\n3. As to DRNCโs first claim for a declaratory judgment, the Court DENIES\nDRNCโs Motion for Summary Judgment and GRANTS CMBEโs Motion\nfor Summary Judgment.  DRNCโs first claim is DISMISSED.\n4. As to DRNCโs second claim for permanent injunctive relief, the Court\nDENIES  DRNCโs  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  and  GRANTS\nCMBEโs  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment.    DRNCโs  second  claim  is\nDISMISSED.\nSigned: December 30, 2019 \n16",
