Unless a party raises objection to a stay of these activities, pending completion of briefing on the motion now at issue, and decision thereon by this court, in filing due within fourteen (14) days from date of entry of this order, the court will stay that aspect of the case so as to promote focus on the issues raised in defendant's motion.

The National Health Law Program was co-counsel in the case.</p>\r\n<p>DRNC sought a court order requiring DHHS to comply with federal Medicaid law and provide these children services to correct or ameliorate their conditions, including comprehensive assessments, home and community-based behavioral support services provided by trained professionals, psychiatric and other clinical services, crisis services, and case management services. Without these Medicaid supports children are unnecessary placed in psychiatric hospitals, sometimes out of the state.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The parties mediated the dispute and arrived at a settlement on November 18, 2016.</p>\r\n<p>On December 20, 2016, DRNC filed a stipulation to dismiss the case.&nbsp; Based on other information, District Judge Louise Wood Flanagan granted the parties' Joint Motion to Dismiss the case and approved a settlement.&nbsp; the settlement required DHHS to take specific actions to provide community based services and resolve the concerns that DRNC raised in its complaint. In April 2018, DHHS agreed to a plan of corrections to ensure DHHS continued to comply with the settlement agreement. On December 18, 2018, Judge Wood Flanagan granted the parties joint request to dismiss the case.</p>",

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and  \n1343(a)(3), which grant this Court original jurisdiction in all actions authorized by 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under color of State law of any rights, privileges, \nor immunities guaranteed by the United States Constitution and Acts of Congress.  \nDeclaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n4.  Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1).  A \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred here \nand Defendant Brajer may be found here.    \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff DRNC is the duly-designated P&A for individuals with disabilities in \nNorth Carolina.  42 U.S.C. § 10801(b); 42 U.S.C. § 15001(b)(2).  DRNC, a non-profit \ncorporation independent of state government, is incorporated in North Carolina and \nmaintains its principal place of business in Raleigh, North Carolina. \n6.  DRNC receives federal funds pursuant to the DD Act and is thereby obligated to \nprovide protection and advocacy services for individuals with developmental disabilities.  \nUnder the DD Act, DRNC is also authorized to investigate suspected incidents of abuse \n2 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 2 of 17\n\n \n \nand neglect and to pursue administrative, legal and other remedies on behalf of \nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  In order to carry out its investigative \nfunctions, DRNC is granted the authority to have access to individuals with disabilities in \nthe locations where they receive services, and to have access to their medical and other \nrecords under certain conditions.  42 U.S.C. § 15043(I); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(a). \n7.  DRNC is a “person” authorized to seek legal and equitable relief against entities \nthat deprive it of rights granted to it under federal law.   \n8.  Defendant Brajer is the Secretary of the North Carolina DHHS.  DHHS is the \nState agency responsible for providing public mental health, developmental disability and \nsubstance abuse services for individuals who have disabilities.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 122C-\n112.1.  As part of that responsibility, DHHS oversees fourteen State-operated healthcare \nfacilities, including Black Mountain Neuro-Medical Treatment Center in Black \nMountain, North Carolina.  § 122C-111.   \n9.  Defendant Brajer is charged with overall responsibility for the administration of \nDHHS.  Defendant has policy-making authority over the fourteen State-operated \nhealthcare facilities.  All of Defendant’s complained-of actions were taken under color of \nstate law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n10.  Black Mountain Neuro-Medical Treatment Center (“BMNTC”) is a State-\noperated healthcare facility that provides services to individuals affected by \ndevelopmental disabilities and by Alzheimer’s Disease. \n3 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 3 of 17\n\n \n \n11.  On September 14, 2015, DRNC received a complaint regarding an individual with \na developmental disability, hereinafter referred to as “the resident.”  According to the \ncomplaint, the resident frequently disrobes and walks around in the nude in common \nareas of the unit, where other residents are exposed to this behavior.  Additionally, the \nresident allegedly urinates and defecates on the floor of both the common areas and \nhis/her bedroom, creating health and safety hazards for all residents.  According to a \nsecond complaint received on the same date, BMNTC staff found the resident on the \nfloor and subsequently determined that the resident had a fractured hip.  A staff member \ndisclosed his/her belief that the resident had urinated on the floor and slipped in the urine, \ncausing the fall and fractured hip. \n12.  Based on the complaints DRNC received, DRNC initiated an investigation into \nthe possible abuse and/or neglect of the resident, and others on the same unit, pursuant to \nits federal authority under the DD Act. \n13.  On November 20, 2015, DRNC notified BMNTC, in writing, that it was \ninvestigating the allegation concerning the abuse and/or neglect of the resident.  As part \nof that investigation, DRNC requested, in writing, a variety of documents, including \nincident reports regarding the resident and any internal management investigation \nrecords.  The letter provided detail concerning the statutory basis for the request.  The \nletter also requested access to these records within three business days, as required by the \nDD Act.  42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(J)(i).  The letter is attached as Exhibit 1. \n14.  DRNC’s receipt of the records was delayed for a few weeks due to a variety of \nfactors, including excessive redactions and a misunderstanding of the statutory basis for \n4 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 4 of 17\n\n \n \nthe request.  On December 10, 2015, DRNC received a set of records.  According to the \nAssistant Attorney General representing BMNTC, these records included all documents \nDRNC requested other than those that are confidential and privileged pursuant to the \nPatient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (“PSQIA”), 42 U.S.C.  §§ 299b-21 et seq. \n15.  Upon review of the records, DRNC determined that BMNTC did not provide the \nincident reports regarding the resident or any internal management investigation records.  \nBoth types of documents are prepared by the facility in the course of regular business, \nprior to and following the passage of the PSQIA, when an injury to a resident occurs. \n16.  On December 14, 2015, DRNC made an oral request for a list of the types of \nrecords that BMNTC declined to produce pursuant to the PSQIA.  DRNC submitted a \nwritten request for the same on December 16, 2015.  The request is attached as Exhibit 2. \n17.  On December 17, 2015, the Assistant Attorney General representing BMNTC \nresponded to this request by stating, “The information that has not been produced meets \nthe definition of Patient Safety work product as that term is defined in DOSHF [sic] \n[Division of State-Operated Healthcare Facilities, an office of DHHS] policy and the \nfederal Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and its accompanying federal \nregulations.  BMNTC has provided you with all information concerning this incident \nother than that which is confidential and privileged pursuant to the Patient Safety and \nQuality Improvement Act.”  BMNTC counsel copied the Assistant General Counsel for \nDHHS on the response.  The response is attached as Exhibit 3. \n18.  On December 17, DRNC made a written request of both the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral representing BMNTC and the Assistant General Counsel for DHHS, seeking an \n5 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 5 of 17\n\n \n \nexpanded explanation as to the types of documents (e.g. incident reports, management \nreports, etc.) that were being withheld by BMNTC.  The request is attached as Exhibit 4. \n19.  As of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to provide DRNC with the \nincident reports and management investigation documents it requested, and failed to \nprovide DRNC with any further statement of the types of documents DHHS has declined \nto produce pursuant to the PSQIA. \nDRNC’s Authority to Access Records \n20.  The DD Act and its implementing regulations give DRNC, as North Carolina’s \ndesignated P&A, the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals \nwith developmental disabilities if the incidents are reported to the system or there is \nprobable cause to believe the incidents occurred.  42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(B); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 1386.25(a)(2)-(5). \n21.  The DD Act and its implementing regulations give DRNC the authority to access \nall individual records of: \nany  individual  with  a  developmental  disability,  in  a  situation  in \nwhich – \na.  the individual, by reason of such individual’s mental or physical \ncondition, is unable to authorize the system to have such access;  \nb.  the individual does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or \nother legal representative, or the legal guardian of the individual \nis the State; and  \n6 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 6 of 17\n\n \n \nc.  a complaint has been received by the system about the individual \nwith regard to the status or treatment of the individual or, as a \nresult of monitoring or other activities, there is probable cause to \nbelieve that such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect. \n42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I)(ii); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(a)(2). \n22.  The resident who is the subject of DRNC’s investigation is an individual with a \ndevelopmental disability.  His/her guardian, the Burke County Department of Social \nServices, is a division of the State of North Carolina.  DRNC has received a complaint \nregarding alleged abuse and/or neglect of the resident.  Therefore, DRNC is entitled to \naccess the resident’s individual records pursuant to the authority granted by the DD Act. \n23.  The DD Act defines an individual record to include “a report prepared or received \nby any staff at any location at which services, supports, or other assistance is provided to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities [or] a report prepared by an agency or staff \nperson charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse or neglect, injury, or death \noccurring at such location, that describes such incidents and the steps taken to investigate \nsuch incidents.”  42 U.S.C. § 15043(c)(1)-(2). \n24.  The implementing regulations to the DD Act, which were revised and became \neffective on August 26, 2015, define individual records to include “reports prepared by a \nFederal, State or local governmental agency, or a private organization charged with \ninvestigating incidents of abuse or neglect, injury or death.”  These include  \nthe incidents of abuse, neglect, injury and/or death; the steps \ntaken  to  investigate  the  incidents;  reports  and  records, \n7 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 7 of 17\n\n \n \nincluding personnel records, prepared or maintained by the \nservice provider in connection with such reports of incidents; \nor supporting information that was relied upon in creating a \nreport  including  all  information  and  records  that  describe \npersons  who  were  interviewed,  physical  and  documentary \nevidence  that  was  reviewed,  and  the  related  investigative \nfindings. \n45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(b)(2). \n25.  The regulations further explain that individual records to which the P&A is \nentitled access include “reports prepared by a Federal, State or local governmental \nagency, or a private organization charged with investigating incidents of abuse or neglect, \ninjury or death.  The organizations whose reports are subject to this requirement include, \nbut are not limited to… developmental disabilities systems… or by medical care \nevaluation or peer review committees, regardless of whether they are protected by federal \nor state law.”  Id. \n26.  As Secretary of DHHS, Defendant Brajer shall “administer and enforce rules that \nare conditions of participation for federal or State financial aid.”  N.C. Gen. Stat.  § \n122C-112.1(a)(18).  This includes the regulation which requires BMNTC, as a long-term \ncare facility, to document and investigate incidents of abuse or neglect.  42 C.F.R. § \n483.13(c)(2)-(3).   \n27. DHHS policy requires BMNTC and other facilities to undertake investigations \ninto allegations of abuse or neglect.  DHHS policy SOHF 136-AL(2), “Protecting \n8 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 8 of 17\n\n \n \nPatients/Residents from Rights Infringements.”  Therefore, any reports or documents \ngenerated during BMNTC’s investigation of incidents regarding the resident are \nconsidered individual records to which DRNC is entitled under the authority of the DD \nAct. \nPSQIA and Patient Safety Work Product \n28.  Congress passed the PSQIA in response to a 1999 report from the Institute of \nMedicine, which urged Congress to “pass legislation to extend peer review protections to \ndata related to patient safety and quality improvement that are collected and analyzed by \nhealth care organizations for internal use or shared with others solely for the purpose of \nimproving safety and quality.”  S. Rep. No. 108-196, at 2 (2003). \n29.  The PSQIA created a mechanism to permit health care facilities to utilize \nexternal, federally-certified review bodies, known as Patient Safety Organizations \n(“PSO”), to analyze incidents and events involving patient safety and to develop methods \nof improving the provision of patient care.  Information submitted to or developed by a \nPSO enjoys protection under the PSQIA, permitting health care facilities and their \nemployees to participate candidly in the review process.   \n30.  The PSQIA grants the protection of privilege and confidentiality to certain types \nof documents that are collected or developed as part of a patient safety evaluation system, \nor “the collection, management, or analysis of information for reporting to or by a PSO.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(6); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n9 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 9 of 17\n\n \n \n31.  These protections are extended only to a particular category of information and \ndocuments known as Patient Safety Work Product (“PSWP”).  The PSQIA defines PSWP \nas \nany data, reports, records, memoranda, analyses (such as root \ncause  analyses),  or  written  or  oral  statements  which  are \nassembled  or  developed  by  a  provider  for  reporting  to  a \npatient safety organization and are reported to a patient safety \norganization; or developed by a patient safety organization \nfor the conduct of patient safety activities; and which could \nresult in improved patient safety, health care quality, or health \ncare  outcomes;  or  which  identify  or  constitute  the \ndeliberations or analysis of, or identify the fact of reporting \npursuant to, a patient safety evaluation system. \n42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n32.  The PSQIA specifically excludes certain types of information from being \ncategorized as PSWP.  PSWP does not include information such as “a patient’s medical \nrecord, billing and discharge information, or any other original patient or provider \nrecords.”  42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(i); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20.  Nor is “information that is \ncollected, maintained, or developed separately, or exists separately, from a patient safety \nevaluation system” considered PSWP.  “Such separate information or a copy thereof \nreported to a patient safety organization shall not by reason of its reporting be considered \npatient safety work product.”  42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n10 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 10 of 17\n\n \n \n33.  Under the PSQIA, PSWP is privileged and cannot be subject to a subpoena from \nany Federal, State, local, or Tribal government; is not “subject to discovery in connection \nwith a Federal, State, local, or Tribal civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding;” is not \nsubject to a Freedom of Information Act request; and may not be admitted as evidence in \nany civil, criminal or administrative proceeding or in a professional disciplinary \nproceeding.  42 C.F.R. § 3.204(a). \nApplication of PSQIA to the Requested Records \nA.  Incident Reports are not PSWP \n34.  The incident reports constitute the type of information that is specifically \nexcluded from the definition of PSWP, i.e. “information that is collected, maintained, or \ndeveloped separately, or exists separately from a patient safety evaluation system.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20.   \n35.  The commentary to the regulations implementing the PSQIA clarifies that the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not intend for the PSQIA to prevent \nthe P&A from accessing information to which it is otherwise entitled.  The regulations \nnote, “Information is not patient safety work product if it is collected to comply with \nexternal obligations such as: state incident reporting requirements… or provision of \naccess to records by the Protection and Advocacy organizations as required by law.”  73 \nFed. Reg. 70,732, 70,743 (2008). \n36.  Federal law requires long-term care facilities, such as BMNTC, to “have evidence \nthat all alleged violations involving mistreatment, neglect, or abuse, including injuries of \nunknown source, and misappropriation of resident property are reported immediately to \n11 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 11 of 17\n\n \n \nthe administrator of the facility and to other officials in accordance with State law \nthrough established procedures.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.13(c)(2). \n37.  DHHS policy requires that staff who “observe, discover or hear about suspected \nrights infringements (including abuse, neglect and exploitation) will report all incidents to \nthe designated supervisory staff on duty and to an internal Advocate.”  SOHF 136-AL(2) \nat (IV)(C)(1).   \n38.  DHHS policy further requires such events to be documented in an incident report.  \nSOHF 126-AL(1), “Patient Safety Evaluation System.”  The policy defines an incident \nreport as \na log report of patient safety events that shall include only and \nall of the following data field elements: date and time of the \nevent; date when the event was reported; patient and resident \nname; patient or resident Medical Record Number (MRN); \nnature or event type (e.g. fall, medication related); severity of \npatient  or  resident  harm  resulting  from  the  event;  location \nwhere  the  event  occurred;  staff  involved  in  the  incident \n(excludes  the  Reporter’s  name  if  the  report  is  submitted \nanonymously); and brief facts of the event. \nId. at (IV)(G). \n39.  The requested incident reports are vehicles by which a facility, such as BMNTC, \ndemonstrates compliance with DHHS policy and federal law.  Such reports have been \ncreated and maintained for many years, long before the passage of the PSQIA.  As such, \n12 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 12 of 17\n\n \n \nthey are documents that are created and exist separately from the PSO system, and \ntherefore do not constitute PSWP.  As non-PSWP, the incident reports cannot be shielded \nunder the PSQIA. \n40.  DHHS acknowledges that incident reports are non-PSWP.  Policy SOHF 136-\nAL(2) contains a statement of purpose which does not mention the PSO system and does \nnot contemplate that an incident report would be gathered for any reason other than to \nensure that the State-operated facilities “respond in a consistent manner when there are \nallegations or suspicions of rights infringements (including abuse, neglect and \nexploitation).”  Id. at (I).  Policy SOHF 126-AL(1) explicitly affirms that an event or \nincident report “is considered Non-PSWP.”  Id. at (V)(B)(1)(b)(1)(c).  DHHS cannot \nsimultaneously acknowledge that the incident reports are non-PSWP and seek to protect \nsuch records as PSWP under the PSQIA. \nB.  Management Investigations are not PSWP \n41.  Investigations conducted by BMNTC management into incidents involving the \nresident are specifically excluded from the definition of PSWP, as they are “collected, \nmaintained, or developed separately from, or exists separately from a patient safety \nevaluation system.”  42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n42.  Federal law requires long-term care facilities, such as BMNTC, to “have evidence \nthat all alleged violations [involving mistreatment, neglect or abuse] are thoroughly \ninvestigated, and must prevent further potential abuse while the investigation is in \nprogress.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.13(c)(3). \n13 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 13 of 17\n\n \n \n43.  DHHS policy requires facility management to collaborate with the internal \nadvocacy department in conducting interviews and collecting supporting documents and \nevidence regarding an allegation of abuse, neglect or other rights infringement.  SOHF \n136-AL(2).  Based upon that information, management and internal advocacy make \nindependent determinations about the matter.  Management is charged with making \nfindings “as they relate to personnel and/or quality assurance aspects of the incident.  \nFinding may include, but are not limited to: job performance issues; personal conduct \nissues; system issues; [and] Quality of Care related issues.”  Id. at (IV)(F)(1)(b). \n44.  The management investigations are conducted to comply with DHHS policy and \nfederal law.  Such investigations have been created and maintained for many years, long \nbefore the passage of the PSQIA.  As such, they are documents that are created and exist \nseparately from the PSO system, and therefore do not constitute PSWP.  As non-PSWP, \nthe management investigations cannot be shielded under the PSQIA. \nC.  In the Alternative: the PSQIA Privilege Does Not Apply to the Incident  \nReports or Management Investigations \n45.  Regardless of whether the records sought by DRNC meet the definition of PSWP, \nDRNC is entitled to obtain those records.  The PSQIA essentially creates a federal peer \nreview privilege, exempting PSWP from, inter alia, discovery in connection with a civil, \ncriminal or administrative proceeding.   \n46.  DRNC does not seek access to the incident reports or management investigations \nin connection with any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding.  DRNC has requested \nthe records in furtherance of its federally-mandated investigatory authority as the P&A.  \n14 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 14 of 17\n\n \n \nTherefore, the PSQIA privilege does not apply to the records.  See, e.g., Disability Rights \nN.C. v. Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. Operating Corp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129367, \n10-12 (M.D.N.C. 2013).  See also Disability Rights N.C. v. Frye Reg’l Med. Ctr., Inc., \n2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158306 (W.D.N.C. 2014). \n47.  The DD Act requires DRNC to “keep confidential all records and information” \nrelating to clients and investigations.  Access to the incident reports and management \ninvestigations therefore would not run afoul of the PSQIA’s confidentiality protections.  \n45 C.F.R. § 1386.28(b)(1).  See Cone at 12. \nD. In the Alternative: If the PSQIA Privilege Does Apply, DRNC is  \nEntitled to Pierce the Privilege \n48.  The DD Act entitles DRNC to access peer review records, as such records are \nwithin the definition of “individual records.”  The regulations implementing the DD Act \ndefine individual records to include “reports prepared by a Federal, State or local \ngovernmental agency… charged with investigating incidents of abuse or neglect, injury \nor death.  The organizations whose reports are subject to this requirement include, but are \nnot limited to… medical care evaluation or peer review committees, regardless of \nwhether they are protected by federal or state law.”  45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(b)(2) (emphasis \nadded).  \n49.  In passing the regulations to the DD Act, the Administration on Intellectual and \nDevelopmental Disabilities specifically noted this regulation “facilitates the P&As \nfulfilling their responsibilities under the DD Act, maximizes the most efficient use of \n15 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 15 of 17\n\n \n \nresources, and is consistent with court decisions allowing P&As access to all records of \nan individual.”  80 Fed. Reg. 44,802 (2015) (emphasis added).   \n50.  As with the State peer review privilege at issue in Cone and Frye, the regulations \nexpressly intend the P&A’s access authority to preempt any State or federal peer review \nprivilege.  Therefore, DRNC is entitled to access records that would otherwise be \nprivileged under the PSQIA. \nCAUSE OF ACTION \n51.  In denying DRNC access to the incident reports and management investigations \nas requested, Defendant Brajer has acted pursuant to the authority vested in him by State \nlaw. \n52.  By refusing DRNC’s written request for access to the incident reports and \nmanagement investigations, Defendant Brajer has deprived DRNC of its statutory rights \nunder the DD Act, U.S.C. §§ 15001 et seq., and the regulations promulgated pursuant to \nit, 45 C.F.R. §§ 1386.1 et seq. \n53.  Defendant’s violation of the DD Act irreparably harms DRNC by preventing it \nfrom carrying out its responsibilities under the Act. \n54.  Unless Defendant Brajer is enjoined to provide DRNC the access required by the \nDD Act, DRNC will continue to be irreparably harmed and will be unable to protect and \nadvocate for persons with disabilities. \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n55.  Plaintiff adopts and restates the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-54 of this \nComplaint. \n16 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 16 of 17\n\n \n \n56.  As a proximate result of Defendant’s violation of the DD Act, DRNC has \nsuffered, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm for which there is no remedy at \nlaw. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the following relief: \n1.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant’s refusal to provide the requested \nrecords violates the DD Act;  \n2.  Enter permanent injunctive relief requiring the Defendant to provide Disability \nRights NC with access to the requested incident reports and management investigations; \n3.  Retain jurisdiction over this action to ensure Defendant’s compliance with the \nmandates of the DD Act;  \n4.  Award DRNC attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n5.  Award such other, further or different relief as the Court deems equitable and just. \nThis 12th day of February 2016.      Respectfully submitted, \n               \n/s/ Kristine L.

Plaintiff, Disability Rights North Carolina (“DRNC”), is the Protection and \nAdvocacy System (“P&A”) for individuals with disabilities in North Carolina.  DRNC \nadvocates for and protects the civil rights of individuals with disabilities in this State \nthrough, among other means, investigating allegations of abuse or neglect.  In the course \nof such investigations, DRNC is authorized to access records of individuals with \ndisabilities.  Defendant Richard Brajer, Secretary of the North Carolina Department of \nHealth and Human Services (“DHHS”), has denied DRNC access to records to which it is \nlegally entitled.  By this action, DRNC seeks an order from this Court requiring \nDefendant to provide the requested information so that DRNC may discharge its statutory \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 1 of 17\n\n \n \nduties and investigate the alleged abuse and neglect of an individual with a \ndevelopmental disability. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n2.  DRNC brings this action for declaratory and injunctive relief for violation of the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (“the DD Act”), 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 15001 et seq.   \n3.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and  \n1343(a)(3), which grant this Court original jurisdiction in all actions authorized by 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 to redress the deprivation under color of State law of any rights, privileges, \nor immunities guaranteed by the United States Constitution and Acts of Congress.  \nDeclaratory and injunctive relief is authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n4.  Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1).  A \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims occurred here \nand Defendant Brajer may be found here.    \nPARTIES \n5.  Plaintiff DRNC is the duly-designated P&A for individuals with disabilities in \nNorth Carolina.  42 U.S.C. § 10801(b); 42 U.S.C. § 15001(b)(2).  DRNC, a non-profit \ncorporation independent of state government, is incorporated in North Carolina and \nmaintains its principal place of business in Raleigh, North Carolina. \n6.  DRNC receives federal funds pursuant to the DD Act and is thereby obligated to \nprovide protection and advocacy services for individuals with developmental disabilities.  \nUnder the DD Act, DRNC is also authorized to investigate suspected incidents of abuse \n2 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 2 of 17\n\n \n \nand neglect and to pursue administrative, legal and other remedies on behalf of \nindividuals with developmental disabilities.  In order to carry out its investigative \nfunctions, DRNC is granted the authority to have access to individuals with disabilities in \nthe locations where they receive services, and to have access to their medical and other \nrecords under certain conditions.  42 U.S.C. § 15043(I); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(a). \n7.  DRNC is a “person” authorized to seek legal and equitable relief against entities \nthat deprive it of rights granted to it under federal law.   \n8.  Defendant Brajer is the Secretary of the North Carolina DHHS.  DHHS is the \nState agency responsible for providing public mental health, developmental disability and \nsubstance abuse services for individuals who have disabilities.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 122C-\n112.1.  As part of that responsibility, DHHS oversees fourteen State-operated healthcare \nfacilities, including Black Mountain Neuro-Medical Treatment Center in Black \nMountain, North Carolina.  § 122C-111.   \n9.  Defendant Brajer is charged with overall responsibility for the administration of \nDHHS.  Defendant has policy-making authority over the fourteen State-operated \nhealthcare facilities.  All of Defendant’s complained-of actions were taken under color of \nstate law for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  He is sued in his official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n10.  Black Mountain Neuro-Medical Treatment Center (“BMNTC”) is a State-\noperated healthcare facility that provides services to individuals affected by \ndevelopmental disabilities and by Alzheimer’s Disease. \n3 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 3 of 17\n\n \n \n11.  On September 14, 2015, DRNC received a complaint regarding an individual with \na developmental disability, hereinafter referred to as “the resident.”  According to the \ncomplaint, the resident frequently disrobes and walks around in the nude in common \nareas of the unit, where other residents are exposed to this behavior.  Additionally, the \nresident allegedly urinates and defecates on the floor of both the common areas and \nhis/her bedroom, creating health and safety hazards for all residents.  According to a \nsecond complaint received on the same date, BMNTC staff found the resident on the \nfloor and subsequently determined that the resident had a fractured hip.  A staff member \ndisclosed his/her belief that the resident had urinated on the floor and slipped in the urine, \ncausing the fall and fractured hip. \n12.  Based on the complaints DRNC received, DRNC initiated an investigation into \nthe possible abuse and/or neglect of the resident, and others on the same unit, pursuant to \nits federal authority under the DD Act. \n13.  On November 20, 2015, DRNC notified BMNTC, in writing, that it was \ninvestigating the allegation concerning the abuse and/or neglect of the resident.  As part \nof that investigation, DRNC requested, in writing, a variety of documents, including \nincident reports regarding the resident and any internal management investigation \nrecords.  The letter provided detail concerning the statutory basis for the request.  The \nletter also requested access to these records within three business days, as required by the \nDD Act.  42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(J)(i).  The letter is attached as Exhibit 1. \n14.  DRNC’s receipt of the records was delayed for a few weeks due to a variety of \nfactors, including excessive redactions and a misunderstanding of the statutory basis for \n4 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 4 of 17\n\n \n \nthe request.  On December 10, 2015, DRNC received a set of records.  According to the \nAssistant Attorney General representing BMNTC, these records included all documents \nDRNC requested other than those that are confidential and privileged pursuant to the \nPatient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (“PSQIA”), 42 U.S.C.  §§ 299b-21 et seq. \n15.  Upon review of the records, DRNC determined that BMNTC did not provide the \nincident reports regarding the resident or any internal management investigation records.  \nBoth types of documents are prepared by the facility in the course of regular business, \nprior to and following the passage of the PSQIA, when an injury to a resident occurs. \n16.  On December 14, 2015, DRNC made an oral request for a list of the types of \nrecords that BMNTC declined to produce pursuant to the PSQIA.  DRNC submitted a \nwritten request for the same on December 16, 2015.  The request is attached as Exhibit 2. \n17.  On December 17, 2015, the Assistant Attorney General representing BMNTC \nresponded to this request by stating, “The information that has not been produced meets \nthe definition of Patient Safety work product as that term is defined in DOSHF [sic] \n[Division of State-Operated Healthcare Facilities, an office of DHHS] policy and the \nfederal Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act and its accompanying federal \nregulations.  BMNTC has provided you with all information concerning this incident \nother than that which is confidential and privileged pursuant to the Patient Safety and \nQuality Improvement Act.”  BMNTC counsel copied the Assistant General Counsel for \nDHHS on the response.  The response is attached as Exhibit 3. \n18.  On December 17, DRNC made a written request of both the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral representing BMNTC and the Assistant General Counsel for DHHS, seeking an \n5 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 5 of 17\n\n \n \nexpanded explanation as to the types of documents (e.g. incident reports, management \nreports, etc.) that were being withheld by BMNTC.  The request is attached as Exhibit 4. \n19.  As of the date of this Complaint, Defendant has failed to provide DRNC with the \nincident reports and management investigation documents it requested, and failed to \nprovide DRNC with any further statement of the types of documents DHHS has declined \nto produce pursuant to the PSQIA. \nDRNC’s Authority to Access Records \n20.  The DD Act and its implementing regulations give DRNC, as North Carolina’s \ndesignated P&A, the authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals \nwith developmental disabilities if the incidents are reported to the system or there is \nprobable cause to believe the incidents occurred.  42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(B); 45 C.F.R. \n§ 1386.25(a)(2)-(5). \n21.  The DD Act and its implementing regulations give DRNC the authority to access \nall individual records of: \nany  individual  with  a  developmental  disability,  in  a  situation  in \nwhich – \na.  the individual, by reason of such individual’s mental or physical \ncondition, is unable to authorize the system to have such access;  \nb.  the individual does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or \nother legal representative, or the legal guardian of the individual \nis the State; and  \n6 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 6 of 17\n\n \n \nc.  a complaint has been received by the system about the individual \nwith regard to the status or treatment of the individual or, as a \nresult of monitoring or other activities, there is probable cause to \nbelieve that such individual has been subject to abuse or neglect. \n42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I)(ii); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(a)(2). \n22.  The resident who is the subject of DRNC’s investigation is an individual with a \ndevelopmental disability.  His/her guardian, the Burke County Department of Social \nServices, is a division of the State of North Carolina.  DRNC has received a complaint \nregarding alleged abuse and/or neglect of the resident.  Therefore, DRNC is entitled to \naccess the resident’s individual records pursuant to the authority granted by the DD Act. \n23.  The DD Act defines an individual record to include “a report prepared or received \nby any staff at any location at which services, supports, or other assistance is provided to \nindividuals with developmental disabilities [or] a report prepared by an agency or staff \nperson charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse or neglect, injury, or death \noccurring at such location, that describes such incidents and the steps taken to investigate \nsuch incidents.”  42 U.S.C. § 15043(c)(1)-(2). \n24.  The implementing regulations to the DD Act, which were revised and became \neffective on August 26, 2015, define individual records to include “reports prepared by a \nFederal, State or local governmental agency, or a private organization charged with \ninvestigating incidents of abuse or neglect, injury or death.”  These include  \nthe incidents of abuse, neglect, injury and/or death; the steps \ntaken  to  investigate  the  incidents;  reports  and  records, \n7 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 7 of 17\n\n \n \nincluding personnel records, prepared or maintained by the \nservice provider in connection with such reports of incidents; \nor supporting information that was relied upon in creating a \nreport  including  all  information  and  records  that  describe \npersons  who  were  interviewed,  physical  and  documentary \nevidence  that  was  reviewed,  and  the  related  investigative \nfindings. \n45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(b)(2). \n25.  The regulations further explain that individual records to which the P&A is \nentitled access include “reports prepared by a Federal, State or local governmental \nagency, or a private organization charged with investigating incidents of abuse or neglect, \ninjury or death.  The organizations whose reports are subject to this requirement include, \nbut are not limited to… developmental disabilities systems… or by medical care \nevaluation or peer review committees, regardless of whether they are protected by federal \nor state law.”  Id. \n26.  As Secretary of DHHS, Defendant Brajer shall “administer and enforce rules that \nare conditions of participation for federal or State financial aid.”  N.C. Gen. Stat.  § \n122C-112.1(a)(18).  This includes the regulation which requires BMNTC, as a long-term \ncare facility, to document and investigate incidents of abuse or neglect.  42 C.F.R. § \n483.13(c)(2)-(3).   \n27. DHHS policy requires BMNTC and other facilities to undertake investigations \ninto allegations of abuse or neglect.  DHHS policy SOHF 136-AL(2), “Protecting \n8 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 8 of 17\n\n \n \nPatients/Residents from Rights Infringements.”  Therefore, any reports or documents \ngenerated during BMNTC’s investigation of incidents regarding the resident are \nconsidered individual records to which DRNC is entitled under the authority of the DD \nAct. \nPSQIA and Patient Safety Work Product \n28.  Congress passed the PSQIA in response to a 1999 report from the Institute of \nMedicine, which urged Congress to “pass legislation to extend peer review protections to \ndata related to patient safety and quality improvement that are collected and analyzed by \nhealth care organizations for internal use or shared with others solely for the purpose of \nimproving safety and quality.”  S. Rep. No. 108-196, at 2 (2003). \n29.  The PSQIA created a mechanism to permit health care facilities to utilize \nexternal, federally-certified review bodies, known as Patient Safety Organizations \n(“PSO”), to analyze incidents and events involving patient safety and to develop methods \nof improving the provision of patient care.  Information submitted to or developed by a \nPSO enjoys protection under the PSQIA, permitting health care facilities and their \nemployees to participate candidly in the review process.   \n30.  The PSQIA grants the protection of privilege and confidentiality to certain types \nof documents that are collected or developed as part of a patient safety evaluation system, \nor “the collection, management, or analysis of information for reporting to or by a PSO.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(6); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n9 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 9 of 17\n\n \n \n31.  These protections are extended only to a particular category of information and \ndocuments known as Patient Safety Work Product (“PSWP”).  The PSQIA defines PSWP \nas \nany data, reports, records, memoranda, analyses (such as root \ncause  analyses),  or  written  or  oral  statements  which  are \nassembled  or  developed  by  a  provider  for  reporting  to  a \npatient safety organization and are reported to a patient safety \norganization; or developed by a patient safety organization \nfor the conduct of patient safety activities; and which could \nresult in improved patient safety, health care quality, or health \ncare  outcomes;  or  which  identify  or  constitute  the \ndeliberations or analysis of, or identify the fact of reporting \npursuant to, a patient safety evaluation system. \n42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n32.  The PSQIA specifically excludes certain types of information from being \ncategorized as PSWP.  PSWP does not include information such as “a patient’s medical \nrecord, billing and discharge information, or any other original patient or provider \nrecords.”  42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(i); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20.  Nor is “information that is \ncollected, maintained, or developed separately, or exists separately, from a patient safety \nevaluation system” considered PSWP.  “Such separate information or a copy thereof \nreported to a patient safety organization shall not by reason of its reporting be considered \npatient safety work product.”  42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n10 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 10 of 17\n\n \n \n33.  Under the PSQIA, PSWP is privileged and cannot be subject to a subpoena from \nany Federal, State, local, or Tribal government; is not “subject to discovery in connection \nwith a Federal, State, local, or Tribal civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding;” is not \nsubject to a Freedom of Information Act request; and may not be admitted as evidence in \nany civil, criminal or administrative proceeding or in a professional disciplinary \nproceeding.  42 C.F.R. § 3.204(a). \nApplication of PSQIA to the Requested Records \nA.  Incident Reports are not PSWP \n34.  The incident reports constitute the type of information that is specifically \nexcluded from the definition of PSWP, i.e. “information that is collected, maintained, or \ndeveloped separately, or exists separately from a patient safety evaluation system.”  42 \nU.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20.   \n35.  The commentary to the regulations implementing the PSQIA clarifies that the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not intend for the PSQIA to prevent \nthe P&A from accessing information to which it is otherwise entitled.  The regulations \nnote, “Information is not patient safety work product if it is collected to comply with \nexternal obligations such as: state incident reporting requirements… or provision of \naccess to records by the Protection and Advocacy organizations as required by law.”  73 \nFed. Reg. 70,732, 70,743 (2008). \n36.  Federal law requires long-term care facilities, such as BMNTC, to “have evidence \nthat all alleged violations involving mistreatment, neglect, or abuse, including injuries of \nunknown source, and misappropriation of resident property are reported immediately to \n11 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 11 of 17\n\n \n \nthe administrator of the facility and to other officials in accordance with State law \nthrough established procedures.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.13(c)(2). \n37.  DHHS policy requires that staff who “observe, discover or hear about suspected \nrights infringements (including abuse, neglect and exploitation) will report all incidents to \nthe designated supervisory staff on duty and to an internal Advocate.”  SOHF 136-AL(2) \nat (IV)(C)(1).   \n38.  DHHS policy further requires such events to be documented in an incident report.  \nSOHF 126-AL(1), “Patient Safety Evaluation System.”  The policy defines an incident \nreport as \na log report of patient safety events that shall include only and \nall of the following data field elements: date and time of the \nevent; date when the event was reported; patient and resident \nname; patient or resident Medical Record Number (MRN); \nnature or event type (e.g. fall, medication related); severity of \npatient  or  resident  harm  resulting  from  the  event;  location \nwhere  the  event  occurred;  staff  involved  in  the  incident \n(excludes  the  Reporter’s  name  if  the  report  is  submitted \nanonymously); and brief facts of the event. \nId. at (IV)(G). \n39.  The requested incident reports are vehicles by which a facility, such as BMNTC, \ndemonstrates compliance with DHHS policy and federal law.  Such reports have been \ncreated and maintained for many years, long before the passage of the PSQIA.  As such, \n12 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 12 of 17\n\n \n \nthey are documents that are created and exist separately from the PSO system, and \ntherefore do not constitute PSWP.  As non-PSWP, the incident reports cannot be shielded \nunder the PSQIA. \n40.  DHHS acknowledges that incident reports are non-PSWP.  Policy SOHF 136-\nAL(2) contains a statement of purpose which does not mention the PSO system and does \nnot contemplate that an incident report would be gathered for any reason other than to \nensure that the State-operated facilities “respond in a consistent manner when there are \nallegations or suspicions of rights infringements (including abuse, neglect and \nexploitation).”  Id. at (I).  Policy SOHF 126-AL(1) explicitly affirms that an event or \nincident report “is considered Non-PSWP.”  Id. at (V)(B)(1)(b)(1)(c).  DHHS cannot \nsimultaneously acknowledge that the incident reports are non-PSWP and seek to protect \nsuch records as PSWP under the PSQIA. \nB.  Management Investigations are not PSWP \n41.  Investigations conducted by BMNTC management into incidents involving the \nresident are specifically excluded from the definition of PSWP, as they are “collected, \nmaintained, or developed separately from, or exists separately from a patient safety \nevaluation system.”  42 U.S.C. § 299b-21(7)(B)(ii); 42 C.F.R. § 3.20. \n42.  Federal law requires long-term care facilities, such as BMNTC, to “have evidence \nthat all alleged violations [involving mistreatment, neglect or abuse] are thoroughly \ninvestigated, and must prevent further potential abuse while the investigation is in \nprogress.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.13(c)(3). \n13 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 13 of 17\n\n \n \n43.  DHHS policy requires facility management to collaborate with the internal \nadvocacy department in conducting interviews and collecting supporting documents and \nevidence regarding an allegation of abuse, neglect or other rights infringement.  SOHF \n136-AL(2).  Based upon that information, management and internal advocacy make \nindependent determinations about the matter.  Management is charged with making \nfindings “as they relate to personnel and/or quality assurance aspects of the incident.  \nFinding may include, but are not limited to: job performance issues; personal conduct \nissues; system issues; [and] Quality of Care related issues.”  Id. at (IV)(F)(1)(b). \n44.  The management investigations are conducted to comply with DHHS policy and \nfederal law.  Such investigations have been created and maintained for many years, long \nbefore the passage of the PSQIA.  As such, they are documents that are created and exist \nseparately from the PSO system, and therefore do not constitute PSWP.  As non-PSWP, \nthe management investigations cannot be shielded under the PSQIA. \nC.  In the Alternative: the PSQIA Privilege Does Not Apply to the Incident  \nReports or Management Investigations \n45.  Regardless of whether the records sought by DRNC meet the definition of PSWP, \nDRNC is entitled to obtain those records.  The PSQIA essentially creates a federal peer \nreview privilege, exempting PSWP from, inter alia, discovery in connection with a civil, \ncriminal or administrative proceeding.   \n46.  DRNC does not seek access to the incident reports or management investigations \nin connection with any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding.  DRNC has requested \nthe records in furtherance of its federally-mandated investigatory authority as the P&A.  \n14 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 14 of 17\n\n \n \nTherefore, the PSQIA privilege does not apply to the records.  See, e.g., Disability Rights \nN.C. v. Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. Operating Corp., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129367, \n10-12 (M.D.N.C. 2013).  See also Disability Rights N.C. v. Frye Reg’l Med. Ctr., Inc., \n2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158306 (W.D.N.C. 2014). \n47.  The DD Act requires DRNC to “keep confidential all records and information” \nrelating to clients and investigations.  Access to the incident reports and management \ninvestigations therefore would not run afoul of the PSQIA’s confidentiality protections.  \n45 C.F.R. § 1386.28(b)(1).  See Cone at 12. \nD. In the Alternative: If the PSQIA Privilege Does Apply, DRNC is  \nEntitled to Pierce the Privilege \n48.  The DD Act entitles DRNC to access peer review records, as such records are \nwithin the definition of “individual records.”  The regulations implementing the DD Act \ndefine individual records to include “reports prepared by a Federal, State or local \ngovernmental agency… charged with investigating incidents of abuse or neglect, injury \nor death.  The organizations whose reports are subject to this requirement include, but are \nnot limited to… medical care evaluation or peer review committees, regardless of \nwhether they are protected by federal or state law.”  45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(b)(2) (emphasis \nadded).  \n49.  In passing the regulations to the DD Act, the Administration on Intellectual and \nDevelopmental Disabilities specifically noted this regulation “facilitates the P&As \nfulfilling their responsibilities under the DD Act, maximizes the most efficient use of \n15 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 15 of 17\n\n \n \nresources, and is consistent with court decisions allowing P&As access to all records of \nan individual.”  80 Fed. Reg. 44,802 (2015) (emphasis added).   \n50.  As with the State peer review privilege at issue in Cone and Frye, the regulations \nexpressly intend the P&A’s access authority to preempt any State or federal peer review \nprivilege.  Therefore, DRNC is entitled to access records that would otherwise be \nprivileged under the PSQIA. \nCAUSE OF ACTION \n51.  In denying DRNC access to the incident reports and management investigations \nas requested, Defendant Brajer has acted pursuant to the authority vested in him by State \nlaw. \n52.  By refusing DRNC’s written request for access to the incident reports and \nmanagement investigations, Defendant Brajer has deprived DRNC of its statutory rights \nunder the DD Act, U.S.C. §§ 15001 et seq., and the regulations promulgated pursuant to \nit, 45 C.F.R. §§ 1386.1 et seq. \n53.  Defendant’s violation of the DD Act irreparably harms DRNC by preventing it \nfrom carrying out its responsibilities under the Act. \n54.  Unless Defendant Brajer is enjoined to provide DRNC the access required by the \nDD Act, DRNC will continue to be irreparably harmed and will be unable to protect and \nadvocate for persons with disabilities. \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n55.  Plaintiff adopts and restates the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-54 of this \nComplaint. \n16 \nCase 1:16-cv-00137-MOC-DLH   Document 1   Filed 02/12/16   Page 16 of 17\n\n \n \n56.  As a proximate result of Defendant’s violation of the DD Act, DRNC has \nsuffered, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm for which there is no remedy at \nlaw. \nRELIEF REQUESTED \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant the following relief: \n1.  Enter a declaratory judgment that Defendant’s refusal to provide the requested \nrecords violates the DD Act;  \n2.  Enter permanent injunctive relief requiring the Defendant to provide Disability \nRights NC with access to the requested incident reports and management investigations; \n3.  Retain jurisdiction over this action to ensure Defendant’s compliance with the \nmandates of the DD Act;  \n4.  Award DRNC attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n5.  Award such other, further or different relief as the Court deems equitable and just. \nThis 12th day of February 2016.      Respectfully submitted, \n               \n/s/ Kristine L.
