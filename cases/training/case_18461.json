( “NFB”), \nby and through undersigned counsel, file this complaint against Defendant Duke \nUniversity (“Duke”) for denying the blind equal access to Duke’s programs and activities \nin violation of federal law. They allege as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Mary Fernandez was a graduate student at Duke. She first enrolled for the \nfall of 2018 to pursue a Master of Business Administration. Ms. Fernandez is blind and is \na member of the National Federation of the Blind. She was persuaded to select Duke in \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 1 of 38\n\nlarge part because of its assurances that it could and would give her an opportunity equal \nto her sighted peers to pursue her career goals. \n2.  Instead, as set forth in detail below, Duke denied Ms. Fernandez an \nopportunity equal to that afforded her sighted peers to access course materials and \neducational technology and, as a result, denied her the opportunity to learn in an equally \neffective and integrated manner alongside her sighted peers. That denial stemmed from \nDuke’s failure to provide Ms. Fernandez timely and adequate access to: (1) course \nmaterials in an accessible format including handouts, assignments, PowerPoint \npresentations, and class notes; (2) useful tactile graphics; and (3) accessible course \nregistration and employer recruiting software programs. \n3.  Braille is Ms. Fernandez’s primary reading method. As the NFB has \nemphasized, Braille is vital to literacy for the blind.  \n4.  For digital text, Ms. Fernandez uses screen access software, Job Access \nwith Speech (“JAWS”), which displays text on a refreshable Braille display or vocalizes \nthe text using synthesized speech. Screen access software such as JAWS enables Ms. \nFernandez to use keyboard commands to easily navigate text, to change the speed of the \nvocalized text, to enhance her reading speed and comprehension, and to receive audible \ncues concerning paragraphing, punctuation, and other organizational information. In \nshort, screen access software allows Ms. Fernandez to read textual content with the same \nindependence and ease of use that visual readers enjoy.  \n5.  When digital content is properly formatted, it is universally available to \nsighted and blind alike and does not require the re-creation of text in a separate format.  \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 2 of 38\n\n6.  Recognized standards exist for the preparation and presentation of \nuniversally designed mainstream digital content. For example, the International Digital \nPublishing Forum has established the ePub 3.0.1 standard for published digital content, \nand the World Wide Web Consortium has promulgated Web Content Accessibility \nGuidelines 2.1. Accessible math content, critical to Ms. Fernandez’s educational path, is \nbest presented in MathML. Free open-source software has been written to make it easy to \nconvert equations from the language in which they are typically written (LaTex) into \nMathML. When source files are not available, equations can be pasted into Microsoft \nWord and then, with the aid of an inexpensive (approximately $30) plug-in, can be \nexported from Word into MathML.  \n7.  Like a public accommodation building an entrance with steps and no ramp, \nDuke has created accessibility problems by making procurement decision about digital \ncontent without considering whether students with disabilities will have integrated and \nimmediate access to that content. Duke compounds that failure by not timely converting \ninaccessible content to accessible content so that students with disabilities may have \naccess to course-related content at the same time as their nondisabled peers. \n8.  Universities use a wide array of software programs to help students search \nfor jobs and sign up for events on campus, including job interviews and networking \nevents. Duke has acquired inaccessible software for these activities. Consequently, Duke \nforced on Ms. Fernandez less effective and segregated communication methods, which \nmade it difficult, if not impossible, for her to acquire basic information on available jobs \nthrough the software systems used by her peers. \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 3 of 38\n\n9.  Ms. Fernandez relies on tactile graphics, including raised line illustrations \nand their accompanying Braille labels, to comprehend images and diagrams that appear \ndigitally and in print. The preparation of tactile illustration requires precision and \nexpertise. Modes of producing tactile images range in quality and accuracy. Because \ndiagrams and graphics are critical to accounting, statistics, and other quantitative courses \noffered in Duke’s MBA program, tactile graphics that are prepared accurately are an \nessential component of Ms. Fernandez’s education. Duke did not provide Ms. Fernandez \nwith an equal opportunity to access graphical information. In accounting, statistics, and \nother quantitative classes, this failure meant that she was deprived of an important body \nof information that was communicated timely and effectively to her fellow students. \n10.  Duke’s failure to provide Ms. Fernandez an equal opportunity to access the \ncontent, classroom learning, and activities in these required courses forced her to achieve \ngrades that did not reflect her intelligence, aptitude, and efforts and instead reflects only \nthe barriers to learning that Duke erected. Duke’s failure to afford Ms. Fernandez an \nequal opportunity to compete at a level commensurate with her capabilities caused her: \n(1) to expend tuition, fees, and expenses in exchange for an inferior educational \nexperience to that which Duke has offered her sighted peers; (2) lost career opportunities; \nand (3) severe emotional distress.  \n11.  Ms. Fernandez relied on Duke’s assurances of equal access and upheld her \nend of the bargain by enrolling, paying tuition, and applying herself to her studies. Duke, \nfar from providing an equal opportunity to access educational benefits, offered Ms. \nFernandez a nightmarish experience of failed and broken promises, unfair disadvantage \n4 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 4 of 38\n\nand discrimination, and an educational experience that was inferior to what she was \nentitled and what others received.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the claims of Ms. Fernandez and the NFB arise under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq., and Section \n504 of Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794.  \n13.  Ms. Fernandez is a resident of Woodbridge, New Jersey.  \n14.  Duke University is a not-for-profit corporation registered with the North \nCarolina Secretary of State. Its principal office is located in Durham, North Carolina. The \nacts and injuries complained of herein occurred in Durham, North Carolina. \n15.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) because the \nDefendant does business in this district, the acts constituting violations of the ADA and \nSection 504 occurred in this district, and Ms. Fernandez resides in this district. \nTHE PARTIES \n16.  Ms. Fernandez has been blind since the age of four. She grew up in \nWoodbridge, New Jersey. She graduated from Emory University with a 3.8 grade point \naverage. Duke awarded her a scholarship, as did the New Jersey Commission for the \nBlind. For the rest of her educational expenses at Duke, she has incurred student loan \ndebt.  \n17.  Ms. Fernandez enrolled at Duke for the fall of 2018 and chose Duke \nspecifically because when she was admitted to Duke but had not yet decided whether she \n5 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 5 of 38\n\nwould attend the university, Ms. Fernandez met with Duke’s Assistant Director of \nStudent Life, Daytime MBA Program, Rebecca McMillan, who assured Ms. Fernandez \nthat Duke would fulfill her requested accommodations. Ms. McMillan told Ms. \nFernandez that she would be provided Braille content for her quantitative classes and that \nshe would be able to take notes on her computer during class. In short, Ms. McMillan \nassured Ms. Fernandez that Duke took its legal obligation of equal access seriously to \nensure that Ms. Fernandez would have an academic experience equal to her fellow \nstudents. \n18.  The National Federation of the Blind, the oldest and largest national \norganization of blind persons, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation duly organized under \nthe laws of the District of Columbia and headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. It has \naffiliates in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The NFB and its affiliates \nare widely recognized by the public, Congress, executive agencies of state and federal \ngovernments, and the courts as a collective and representative voice on behalf of blind \nAmericans and their families. The organization promotes the general welfare of the blind \nby assisting the blind in their efforts to integrate themselves into society on terms of \nequality and by removing barriers that result in the denial of opportunity to blind persons \nin virtually every sphere of life, including education, employment, family and community \nlife, transportation, and recreation.  \n19.  The mission of the National Federation of the Blind is to achieve the \ncomplete integration of the blind into society on a basis of equality. This mission includes \nthe removal of legal, economic, and social discrimination against the blind. As part of its \n6 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 6 of 38\n\nmission and to achieve these goals, the NFB actively pursues advocacy, education, and \nlitigation to ensure that the blind receive equal access to the opportunities, facilities, \nservices, programs, and activities offered by institutions of higher education.  \n20.  The NFB devotes substantial resources to accessible post-secondary \neducation. It supports a division, the National Association of Blind Students, that brings \nstudents together to discuss barriers and solutions to equal access to education. Each year, \nthe NFB provides over $120,000 in scholarships to blind students pursuing their college \ncareers across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. This is the largest \nscholarship program of its kind in the country. In addition, the NFB developed the Self-\nAdvocacy in Higher Education Toolkit to help blind students better understand the higher \neducation accommodation request process, mitigate access barriers on campus, and \nultimately to succeed as a student. \n21.  For over forty years, the NFB has been directly involved in the \ndevelopment of technology that helps blind people, including post-secondary students, \naccess print materials. In the 1970’s, it collaborated with Ray Kurzweil to develop the \nKurzweil Reading Machine, the first machine to use optical character recognition to \nconvert text to speech. More recently, the NFB led the team that evolved this \nrevolutionary technology into an app for smartphones, making it more universally \navailable to blind and other print-disabled people. To promote the development of \nuniform practices by colleges for print-disabled students, the NFB persuaded Congress to \ncreate a federal Advisory Commission for Accessible Instructional Materials in \nPostsecondary Education for Students with Disabilities (“AIM Commission”) that \n7 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 7 of 38\n\nexamined the barriers faced by students and faculty with disabilities in gaining access to \ninstructional materials and made recommendations. Currently, the NFB is working with \nthe Association of American Publishers, the Software Industry and Information \nAssociation, and the American Council on Education to support federal legislation that \nwould authorize a Federal Advisory Commission for Accessible Instructional Materials \nin Postsecondary Education for Students with Disabilities. The NFB has established a \nCenter of Excellence in Nonvisual Access (CENA) to Education, Public Information, and \nCommerce with support from the Maryland Department on Disability through a Non-\nVisual Access Initiative Grant that offers Accessibility Boutiques (introductions to \naccessibility) that are free of charge and open to the public. Boutiques on topics relevant \nto higher education include: tactile graphics, document accessibility, web accessibility, \nAmazon accessibility, Google apps, and digital books. It also conducted day-long web \naccessibility training conferences in 2014 and 2015.  \n22.  The NFB also developed the Higher Education Accessibility Online \nResource Center that provides links to accessibility standards and guidelines, guidance on \nhow to create non-visually accessible documents, links to federal guidance documents, \nand links to settlement agreements with institutions of higher education. The NFB has \ndeveloped best practices for institutions of higher education that cover policies on \naccessibility, procurement procedures, accessibility audits and corrective action plans, \nand training of faculty, staff, volunteers, and students. To educate the university \ncommunity, the NFB has done presentations on accessibility organizations of institutions \nof higher education including EDUCAUSE, the Association of Independent Colleges and \n8 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 8 of 38\n\nUniversities in Massachusetts (AICUM), the Tennessee Board of Regents, and at \nAccessible Instructional Materials and Technology in Higher Education Summit. Two \nNFB staff members participated on the Maryland Legislative Workgroup on Accessibility \nConcepts in Computer Science, Information Systems, and Information Technology \nPrograms in Higher Education. The purpose of the workgroup was to evaluate the extent \nto which accessibility is incorporated into the curriculum of computer science, \ninformation systems, and information technology programs in Maryland institutions of \nhigher education and to make recommendations.  \n23.  In addition, through collaboration, negotiation, complaints with the Office \nof Civil Rights of the Department of Education or litigation, the NFB has assisted \nstudents in resolving issues and reaching comprehensive agreements addressing access to \neducational content and software at Penn State University, Arizona State University, \nFlorida State University, University of Miami, University of Montana, Atlantic Cape \nCommunity College, Maricopa County Community College, Southern Oregon, and \nWichita State University. \n24.  The NFB has diverted significant resources to identify and counteract the \nuse of inaccessible, discriminatory technology and course materials at educational \ninstitutions, including at several colleges and universities that provide courses, job search, \nand interview opportunities similar to Duke. The NFB brings this suit in furtherance of its \nextensive efforts and expenditure of resources in promoting two of its principal missions: \nindependence of the blind and equal access to higher education institutions for the blind.  \n9 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 9 of 38\n\n25.  The NFB sues Duke in furtherance of its extensive efforts and expenditure \nof resources in working to ensure equal access to institutions of higher education for the \nblind and as a result of Duke’s frustration of the NFB’s mission. \n26.  Ms. Fernandez is a member of the NFB. \n27.  Defendant Duke is a public accommodation pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 12181(7)(J). \n28.  Defendant Duke receives federal financial assistance in many forms, \nincluding, but not limited to, direct grants of assistance as well as student financial aid, \nand is therefore required to comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n29 U.S.C. § 794. \n29.  As a condition of receiving federal funds from the Department of \nEducation, Defendant Duke is required to sign a Certificate of Compliance certifying that \nit is in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nI.  Prior to matriculation at Duke \n \n30.  Ms. Fernandez applied to Duke’s MBA program in November 2017. \nBecause Duke’s web-based application was inaccessible, Ms. Fernandez was forced to \nsubmit a paper application. Upon information and belief, Ms. Fernandez was the only \n2018 applicant to Duke’s Master of Business Administration program who had to submit \na paper application, contrary to Duke’s policy that applications be completed online.  \n31.  Initially Duke mailed Ms. Fernandez inaccessible screenshots of the online \napplication that made it impossible for Ms. Fernandez to apply. The application process \n10 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 10 of 38\n\nwas overly time consuming and took far longer to complete than any of her other MBA \napplications.  \n32.  In March 2018, Ms. Fernandez learned that she had been accepted to Duke. \n33.  Duke uses course packs instead of traditional textbooks, so all the course \nmaterials are given to students in paper. Duke also generally does not allow students to \nuse computers or electronic devices in class.  \n34.  During Duke’s Admitted Student Weekend, April 5–7, 2018, Ms. \nFernandez met with Ms. McMillan to discuss the modifications that she would require for \nher course materials. Ms. Fernandez needed Braille materials and tactile graphics for \nquantitative classes, and Ms. McMillan assured Ms. Fernandez that Braille materials \nwould be provided. Ms. Fernandez also discussed with Ms. McMillan about the \naccommodations she would need for the job interview process.  \n35.  In July 2018, Ms. Fernandez took an optional one-week math refresher \ncourse. Ms. McMillan was able to provide Ms. Fernandez with hardcopy Braille course \nmaterials, so Ms. Fernandez was hopeful that Duke would provide her with the materials \nshe needed to have equal access to all of her learning opportunities. Unfortunately, Ms. \nFernandez’s hopes were dashed shortly thereafter. \n36.  Also in July 2018, Ms. McMillan assisted Ms. Fernandez with requesting \nreasonable accommodations through Duke’s Student Disability Access Office (“SDAO”).  \n37.  On July 26, 2018, Ms. Fernandez received a Formal Liaison Letter from the \nSDAO granting accommodations, including the following: \na.  Priority Registration; \n11 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 11 of 38\n\nb.  Books in Alternative Format/: Accessible Electronic or Braille; \nc.  Alternative  Format//Course  Materials/handouts  in  Alternative  Format \nAccessible Electronic or Braille; and \nd.  Alternative Format//Exams/Tests/Quizzes in Alternative Format Accessible \nElectronic or Braille.  \n38.  In late July or early August, Ms. Fernandez met with the Director of Duke’s \nCareer Management Center, Sheryle Dirks, and Mary Beck White-Sutton, her Career \nCoach, who both assured Ms. Fernandez that the accommodations she needed for the \ninterview process would be in place. \n39.  During the summer of 2018, incoming students were required to complete \nan online mathematics tutorial, MBA Math, consisting of video lectures, which were \ninaccessible, and online math problems, which were not accessible with screen access \nsoftware. Ms. Fernandez immediately contacted Ms. McMillan to inform her of these \nbarriers.  \n40.  In an attempt to resolve the accessibility issues with the tutorial, Ms. \nMcMillan signed a contract for Aira, “a service that connects blind and low-vision people \nto highly trained, remotely-located agents” to assist Ms. Fernandez. Aira agents, \nhowever, do not know mathematics and accounting principles, which made it impossible \nfor them to accurately and meaningfully describe the contents of the video lectures and \nonline problems to Ms. Fernandez. As a result, Duke waived the MBA Math tutorial \nrequirement for Ms. Fernandez, and she did not complete the course. Thus, Duke failed to \n12 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 12 of 38\n\nprovide Ms. Fernandez access equal to that of her peers, and she began her MBA \ncoursework at a disadvantage, having not received the benefit of the MBA Math tutorial.  \n41.  When it came time to register for classes, Ms. Fernandez learned that \nDukeHub, Duke’s course registration system, is not fully accessible. Although Duke \nallowed Ms. Fernandez to participate in early registration with the Registrar completing \nregistration for her, she was denied the ability to access the important information \navailable from DukeHub’s “Book Bag” feature which provides a course listing and \ncourse descriptions, and she had to rely on the Registrar to get this information. Thus, \nMs. Fernandez did not have access to Duke’s course catalogue equal to that of her sighted \npeers and could not make equally informed decisions when making course selections.  \n42.  In July 2018, Ms. Fernandez attempted to take another prerequisite online \ncourse, “Business Computer Application,” which is designed to teach students how to use \nmore advanced functions in Excel. The course consisted of five assignments and each \nassignment had ten different tabs with exercises that students had to complete. The \ninstructions were visual, using screen captures of Excel embedded in a PDF document, \nboth of which were inaccessible, to illustrate how to perform the advanced functions. The \ninstructions used arrows, circles, and other shapes in different colors drawn on top of the \nscreen captures to highlight where to find a function, which were inaccessible because \nJAWS does not indicate when there is a change in color.  \n43.  Because Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with the necessary \naccessible course materials, it waived the Business Computer Application course \nrequirement. As a result, Ms. Fernandez did not acquire the necessary skills from the \n13 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 13 of 38\n\nBusiness Computer Application course that other students acquired. Thus, Duke again \nfailed to provide Ms. Fernandez access equal to that of her peers and again disadvantaged \nher because she did not acquire the knowledge from the Business Computer Application \ncourse that her peers did and which she certainly needed and her prospective employers \nexpected her to have.  \n44.  In August 2018, Duke began its three-week Global Institute Courses, \nconsisting of three classes—two traditional and one experiential. The traditional courses, \nLeadership, Environment, and Organizations (“LEO”) and Global Institutes and \nEnvironments (“GIE”), were text-based and required papers and projects to be completed \nin teams. Although Ms. Fernandez received the LEO cases in an accessible format, she \ndid not receive them until the day or night before the class in which she was expected to \ndiscuss them, so she could not properly prepare for class. In addition, the accessible \nversions of the LEO cases often lacked informative exhibits, which Ms. Fernandez’s \nsighted peers received, that provided the full context of the case.  \n45.  Duke also failed to ensure that its web-based employer recruiting system, \nGlobal Talent System (“GTS”), which students use to learn about prospective employer \nevents, interviews, and job postings was accessible. Setting up the user profile for GTS \nwas a completely inaccessible process, and Ms. Fernandez was eventually forced to have \nan Aira agent do it for her. GTS would sometimes require users to update certain parts of \ntheir profiles, and every time Ms. Fernandez would have to contact an Aira representative \nfor assistance, otherwise she would be locked out of GTS. Once she was able to log into \nher GTS account, Ms. Fernandez learned that there was no accessible search function for \n14 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 14 of 38\n\nthe over 400 job postings on GTS that changed on a daily basis. Unlike her sighted peers, \nMs. Fernandez had to review every post every day to find just a single job posting. In \naddition, the unusable navigational structure of GTS made it impossible to quickly scan \nand skip through past postings. The sign-up system for appointments for one-on-one or \nsmall group events with employers was inaccessible, and Ms. Fernandez was forced to \nemail staff in the Career Management Center or an Aira agent to have them sign her up. \nLike the job postings, there was no accessible search function or navigation for employer \nevents and job fairs, so Ms. Fernandez had to sort through all posted events. In addition, \nGTS contains significant content, such as resume books for the first- and second-year \nclasses. Students use the resume books to connect and network with Duke alumni who \nwork at the companies they are interested in. The resume books are inaccessible because \nthe resumes are displayed as graphics, as opposed to text, and the resume books \nthemselves are PDF documents that have not been made accessible. This prevented Ms. \nFernandez from using Duke’s alumni network to aid her job search, unlike her sighted \npeers. The job search process was frustrating and incredibly time consuming. \nConsequently, Ms. Fernandez was forced to devote an immeasurable amount time and \nmental energy to searching for a job, signing up for interviews, and finding workarounds \nto the accessibility barriers GTS put in her way—time and energy that she otherwise \nwould have devoted to her classes and extra-curricular activities.  \n46.  In addition, Duke’s Career Management Center failed to take any steps to \nspeak with recruiters about accommodations for the interview process, contrary to what \n15 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 15 of 38\n\nMs. Fernandez discussed with Ms. McMillan and the Career Management Center during \norientation.  \n47.  For consulting job interviews, the employers create business mini-cases, \nnone of which were accessible. Duke has a casebook of mini-cases to aid students in \npreparing for consulting interviews, which is also inaccessible. Ms. Fernandez asked her \ncareer advisor, Mary Beth White, to do one-on-one discussions of the mini-cases in \npreparation for the consulting interviews, but Ms. White never followed up with Ms. \nFernandez. Instead, Ms. Fernandez personally found first- and second-year Duke students \nto help her prepare. Ms. Fernandez also attempted to prepare for these interviews by \nattending a class called “Road Map” offered by Duke’s consulting club, but the course \nmaterials were inaccessible. When Ms. Fernandez got to the mini-cases in the interviews, \nshe struggled, in large part because she never had access to the tools made available to all \nother students to prepare for consulting interviews. In addition, because the Career \nManagement Center failed to take any steps to request accommodations from the \nemployers for Ms. Fernandez, Ms. Fernandez had to contact the employers directly to \nrequest accessible versions of the exhibits to their mini-cases, but none of the employers \nprovided them.  \n48.  For networking purposes, Duke required students to complete a “List, \nAlumni, Motivation, Posting” (“LAMP”) whereby students would generate a list of 40 \ntarget employers using LinkedIn. Although the assignment was only intended to take 40 \nminutes, because LinkedIn is not accessible, it took much longer for Ms. Fernandez to \n16 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 16 of 38\n\ncomplete. Ultimately, Duke required Ms. Fernandez to generate ten employers instead of \n40 and she ended up being locked out of GTS because her assignment was late.  \n49.  Duke alumni can use the Career Management Center’s resume book, which \nis inaccessible and thus unavailable to a blind alumnus. Ms. Fernandez believes, now that \nshe has graduated from Duke, she will encounter similar barriers in searching for jobs \nusing Duke resources as an alumna to the ones she faced with the GTS system.  \nII.  Fall 2018  \n \n50.  Duke’s failures to provide Ms. Fernandez with equal access to \nopportunities, services, programs, and activities continued into the 2018–2019 Academic \nYear.    \n51.  Duke uses the following grading scale: Superior Pass (SP) = 4.0; High Pass \n(HP) = 3.5; Pass (P) = 3.0; Low Pass (LP) = 2.5; and Fail (F) = 0. \nA.       2018 Fall I \n52.  Ms. Fernandez registered for four courses for the Fall I Term: Financial \nAccounting, Managerial Economics, Probability and Statistics, and Leadership \nCommunication I.  \n53.  Before the Fall I Term began, Ms. McMillan repeatedly contacted \nprofessors and staff for Ms. Fernandez’s courses about providing Ms. Fernandez with \naccessible materials. On information and belief, Duke told Ms. McMillan to stop \nbothering faculty and staff.  \n17 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 17 of 38\n\n54.  In August 2018, Ms. Fernandez learned that no one had begun preparing \naccessible course materials for Managerial Economics or Probability and Statistics \nbecause Duke barred Ms. McMillan from speaking directly with the professors.  \n55.  On the first day of classes for the Fall I Term, Ms. Fernandez did not have \naccessible materials for any of her courses.  \n56.  Ms. Fernandez also learned that the online system for simulations, which \nstudents are required to use, is inaccessible. Ms. Fernandez was forced to rely on other \nstudents to complete the simulations.  \n57.  On August 10, 2018, the first Friday of the Fall I Term, the Assistant Dean, \nSteve Misuraca, and a Senior Associate Dean, Russ Morgan, asked to meet with Ms. \nFernandez. Ms. Fernandez informed Deans Misuraca and Morgan that Duke was not \nproviding her the necessary and required accessible course materials and other content, \nand that Duke’s failure to do so would negatively impact her educational opportunities, \nincluding job prospects. They apologized and acknowledged that Duke had not provided \nher accessible course materials and stated that they would work to improve the situation. \nDeans Misuraca and Morgan did not resolve the myriad problems that existed. \ni.  Financial Accounting  \n58.  The course materials for the Financial Accounting course were at least a \nweek late, so Ms. Fernandez could not prepare for class. \n59.  Eventually Ms. Fernandez received the Accounting course materials in \nMathML, which reads the equations, and not as tactile graphics with Braille explanations, \nthe format that would have permitted Ms. Fernandez to fully access the unfamiliar \n18 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 18 of 38\n\nsymbols used in the equations. In addition, the professor would use financial statements \nfrom the Target Corporation for about 30 minutes at the beginning of each class to \nillustrate the concepts he had taught in the previous course, but Duke initially failed to \nprovide Ms. Fernandez accessible versions of the financial statements, so she was \nperpetually trying to catch up in the course. Towards the end of the course, Duke \nprovided Ms. Fernandez the Target financial statements in Braille, but she received them \ntoo late for her to catch up. As a result, Ms. Fernandez was not able to prepare for class, \nprocess the course materials concurrently with the lectures, fully absorb the content, or go \nback to find mistakes.  \n60.  Because Ms. Fernandez was not provided with tactile materials, and the \nmaterials she was provided through MathML were always late, she was not able to \nmaster the content nor perform at the level of her ability. As a result, Ms. Fernandez \nreceived a P in the course.  \nii.  Managerial Economics  \n \n61.  Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with accessible course materials for \nher Managerial Economics class, even though the professor gave Duke the course \nmaterials so they could be made accessible.  \n62.  Because Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with accessible course \nmaterials, the Managerial Economics professor met with her before scheduled quizzes the \nweek of a quiz for an hour to go through the concepts being tested. However, Ms. \nFernandez was forced to sit through class without any course materials, which affected \n19 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 19 of 38\n\nher ability to understand the lectures on the materials and ask questions in real time about \ncritical course concepts. \n63.  Although other students had access to practice materials and solutions for \nquizzes two weeks in advance, the Managerial Economics professor worked through the \npractice material and the solutions for quizzes with Ms. Fernandez the day before each \nquiz.  \n64.  Although Ms. Fernandez received an HP in the course, she knows that she \ndid not acquire an actual working understanding of the materials or the proficiency \nexpected of an MBA, and only achieved her grade because she devoted an inordinate \nabout of time attempting to learn the course materials.  \niii.  Probability and Statistics \n \n65.  Dean Misuraca was the only person communicating with the Probability \nand Statistics professor because Duke had barred Ms. McMillan from doing so.  \n66.  Notwithstanding Dean Misuraca’s earlier assurances that the situation \nwould improve, Ms. Fernandez did not timely receive accessible course materials for the \nProbability and Statistics course.  \n67.  Because Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with accessible course \nmaterials, she was forced to ask her fellow students to make them accessible for her. But \nthese materials did not allow her to have full access to the unfamiliar symbols in the \nequations because they were not produced as tactile graphics with Braille explanations. \n20 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 20 of 38\n\n68.  The Probability and Statistics professor’s solutions were all handwritten, so \nthe contractor creating Braille materials for Ms. Fernandez could not read them and \nconvert them to tactile graphics with Braille explanations. \n69.  Ms. Fernandez met with a Teacher’s Assistant for the course who helped \nher, including by recreating the professor’s solutions in accessible PDF documents. \nNevertheless, the Teacher’s Assistant could not complete the PDFs in time for Ms. \nFernandez to use the materials to prepare for class,  forcing her to meet with the \nTeacher’s Assistant in person, which would not have been necessary had the materials \nbeen provided in an accessible format.  \n70.  Because employers began conducting recruiting events in September, Ms. \nFernandez was unable to continue meeting with the Teacher’s Assistant as frequently as \nshe would have liked to sufficiently understand course concepts. \n71.  Ms. Fernandez was also forced to rely on second-year students to write the \nproblems out in a Word document with solutions.  \n72.  In addition, up to three Teachers Assistants devoted countless hours to \ntutoring Ms. Fernandez for each quiz because she was unable to follow the lecture in \nwhich the professor wrote on a whiteboard while he lectured and did not provide the \ncharts, problems, and other image-heavy information in an accessible format prior to \nclass. Although Duke provided Ms. Fernandez a list of Teachers Assistants she could \ncontact for tutoring, she had to schedule the tutoring sessions with the Teachers \nAssistants herself, and they were not always able to meet with her. As a result, Ms. \nFernandez devoted countless extra hours to scheduling these tutoring sessions, and \n21 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 21 of 38\n\nsometimes she was unable to receive tutoring when she needed it; Ms. Fernandez was \nforced to use the Teaching Assistants as the only means available to her to access her \ncourse materials, not as a supplement to her learning as was the case for her sighted \npeers.  \n73.  Ms. Fernandez received a P in the course but could have received a higher \ngrade if Duke had provided accessible course materials in a timely manner.  \niv.  Effect on Other Aspects of Education \n \n74.  The extra time Ms. Fernandez had to devote to overcoming inaccessible \nmaterials in classes had a domino effect on her other, non-quantitative classes that either \ndid not have course materials or for which she received accessible course materials, such \nas Managerial Communication I, and on other aspects of her life at Duke.  \n75.  Although Ms. Fernandez received an HP grade in Managerial \nCommunication I, she could have received a higher grade had she not been forced to \nspend extra time on her other courses. \n76.  Because Ms. Fernandez was forced to schedule and attend tutoring sessions \nand use other work arounds to ensure she learned the course materials, the extra time \ndoing these activities took up time for sleeping, attending recruiting events, and \nparticipating in extra-curricular activities. \n77.  Unlike her peers, Ms. Fernandez’s final exams were pushed into fall break. \nAs a result, she did not have time to rest and recuperate, or to do activities she planned to \ndo during fall break.  \n \n22 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 22 of 38\n\nB.  2018 Fall II \n78.  Ms. Fernandez registered for four courses for the Fall II Term: Global \nFinancial Management, Marketing Management, Foundations of Strategy, and \nLeadership Communication II.  Although she would have preferred to do so, she avoided \ntaking additional quantitative classes because, based on her previous experience, she \nlacked confidence that Duke would provide accessible course materials. \n79.  Duke provided the course materials for her Global Financial Management \ncourse in MathML. However, the lecture notes were text heavy and contained many \nformulas and explanations, and MathML only reads the formulas and equations. Tactile \ngraphics would have allowed Ms. Fernandez to fully comprehend the unfamiliar symbols \nin the formulas and equations. Had Ms. Fernandez received these materials in Braille \nwith tactile graphics, she would have had a much better opportunity to understand the \nconcepts being taught.  \n80.  Ms. Fernandez received a P in Global Financial Management but could \nhave received a higher grade if Duke had provided her accessible course materials that \nallowed her to fully interact with the content.  \nIII.  Spring 2019 Term  \n \n81.  In January 2019, Ms. McMillan left Duke’s Office of Institutional Equity. \nUntil Duke hired Madeleine Dreher to replace Ms. McMillan, Ms. Fernandez worked \nwith Ruth Tolman, the Director of Office of Student Life.  \n82.  Ms. Tolman was dismissive of Ms. Fernandez’s concerns over accessibility \nissues at Duke, stating that “everyone feels like they’re not going to survive.” But no \n23 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 23 of 38\n\nother student had to cope with not being able to access course materials and having to \nrepeatedly request that Duke provide them. Also, no other student had to spend extra time \nwith professors and teaching assistants just to have access to the course content or \nexperienced barriers in accessing the course registration and job search platforms.  \n83.  Due to Duke’s failure to provide accessible course materials that permitted \nMs. Fernandez to access Duke’s courses on equal terms as the other students, and Duke’s \nfailure to provide some accessible materials altogether, Ms. Fernandez continued to avoid \ntaking quantitative classes, which utilize formulas, charts, and graphs, and instead tried to \ntake as many non-quantitative courses, which required primarily required reading and \nwriting, as possible. The lack of more quantitative foundation will forever be missing \nfrom Ms. Fernandez’ MBA knowledge base. \n84.  Ms. Fernandez registered for five courses: Negotiation, Power and \nInfluence, Strategic Brand Management, Operations Management, and a Client \nConsulting Practicum. \n85.  In Operations Management, the only course that had quantitative content, \nMs. Fernandez requested the equations in Braille, and Duke contracted with a third-party \nvendor to provide them. The vendor failed to provide Braille solutions to the equations. \nAs a result, Ms. Fernandez was forced to have a friend transcribe the solutions for her, \nbut they could not be done in time for her to have the learning materials \ncontemporaneously with the lectures.  \n86.  Ms. Fernandez received a P in Operations Management but could have \nreceived a higher grade if Duke had provided accessible solutions to the equations. In the \n24 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 24 of 38\n\nfour non-quantitative courses for which Ms. Fernandez received accessible course \nmaterials—Negotiation, Power and Influence, Strategic Brand Management, and a Client \nConsulting Practicum—she received SP grades.  \nIV.  Fall 2019 & Spring 2020 Terms  \n87.  During the 2019 Fall Term, Ms. Fernandez continued to avoid taking non-\nquantitative courses due to Duke’s failure to provide these materials to her in an \naccessible format.  \n88.  In October 2019, as a result of the issues Ms. Fernandez continued to \nexperience with Duke’s failure to provide her with accessible materials, she filed a \ncomplaint with Duke’s Office of Institutional Equity.  \n89.  The Office of Student Life began creating accessible slide decks and PDF \ndocuments. However, the PDF documents continued to have accessibility errors.  \n90.  In the Spring 2020 Term, hopeful that Duke would fulfill its obligation of \nproviding accessible course materials, Ms. Fernandez registered for a quantitative course: \nArt and Application Game Theory. She requested the course materials in Braille and in \ntactile graphics because they cannot be rendered in an accessible manner using a \ncomputer program like MathML.  \n91.  Initially Duke attempted to create its own Braille materials and tactile \ngraphics. While these materials were technically accessible, Duke did not provide the \nexplanations for the equations with the tactile graphics, so Ms. Fernandez was unable to \nfully interact with the content.  \n25 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 25 of 38\n\n92.  Ms. Fernandez then received the slide decks in an accessible PDF and book \nwith professionally made tactile graphics and Braille that cited the relevant slide number, \nwhich allowed Ms. Fernandez to fully interact with the course materials.  \n93.  Ms. Fernandez’s experience in this class was far better than in any other \nquantitative course, which is reflected in the HP she received, in contrast to her other \nquantitative courses.  \nV.  Duke’s Deliberate Indifference to Equal Educational Opportunity \n \n94.  As technology and digital content has permeated post-secondary education, \nthere has been an extraordinary opportunity for students with print disabilities to have \nequal and mainstream access to the same content at the same time as everyone else. \nUnfortunately, at some campuses, like Duke, the failure to insist on accessible technology \nand content, and the failure of leadership to require accessible copies of course materials, \nassignments, graphics displayed in class, and class notes has resulted in greater inequality \nof access than existed when everything was printed on paper. This failure then \nnecessitates the use of vastly inferior after-the-fact alternate auxiliary aids and services, \nsuch as assistants/scribes/readers who, under the best of circumstances, produce less \neffective communications, who interfere with privacy, independence, and time flexibility \nfor the students who rely on them, and who, often, are insufficiently trained and \ninsufficiently available.  \n95.  Through a combination of assiduous advocacy, education, and litigation, \nthe NFB and other disability rights groups and state and federal agencies have attempted \nto focus the attention of post-secondary education on meeting the legal and moral \n26 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 26 of 38\n\nimperatives raised by these developments. The Departments of Justice and Education \nwrote the presidents of all American post-secondary institutions in June 2010 to advise \nthem that:  \nRequiring  use  of  an  emerging  technology  in  a  classroom \nenvironment when the technology is inaccessible to an entire \npopulation of individuals with disabilities- individuals with \nvisual  disabilities-  is  discrimination  prohibited  by  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) unless \nthose  individuals  are  provided  accommodations  or \nmodifications that permit them to receive all the educational \nbenefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and \nequally integrated manner. \n \nThe Departments of Justice and Education explained that this advice includes not only \nemerging technology used in the classroom, but all “online courses and other online \ncontent, such as online applications for admission, class assignments, and housing.”  \n96.  Unfortunately, since that letter, Duke has expanded its use of emerging \ntechnology to every aspect of education without making any effort to ensure the \ntechnology is accessible to an entire population of individuals with disabilities, who, like \nMs. Fernandez, cannot see. Instead, it has chosen to rely on low-tech, after-the-fact \nauxiliary aids and services that did not permit Ms. Fernandez to receive all the \neducational benefits provided by the technology, much less in an equally effective and \nequally integrated manner and that Duke, in practice, failed to provide timely or \neffectively.  \n27 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 27 of 38\n\n97.  Duke was previously subject to litigation regarding its denial of accessible \ncourse materials for a student who cannot access hard copy, print course materials. See \nElmendorf v. Duke University, 1:14-cv-697 (M.D.N.C. 2014).  \n98.  On information and belief, Duke has taken no action to identify and replace \ninaccessible technology and digital content with accessible technology and content.  \n99.  This deliberate inattention to accessibility pervades the campus beyond the \nclassroom. As mentioned earlier, Duke’s application for admission; Duke’s course \nregistration system, DukeHub; and Duke’s web-based employer recruiting system, GTS, \nare completely inaccessible to Ms. Fernandez.  \nVI.  Impact of Discrimination on Ms. Fernandez \n \n100.  Ms. Fernandez’s experiences have been humiliating and demoralizing. Ms. \nFernandez has not been given an equal and independent opportunity to learn. The grades \nshe received do not accurately reflect her knowledge and skill, but instead reflect the \ndiscrimination she suffered. \n101.  Since the fall of 2018, Ms. Fernandez worked tirelessly to pass the courses \nrequired to successfully complete a Master of Business Administration. Although she \ntook the required courses, Duke routinely failed to timely provide her with accessible \ncourse materials.  \n102.  As a result of the barriers Duke forced her to encounter, Ms. Fernandez \nreceived lower grades than she would have otherwise achieved and lacks confidence in \nher mastery of course concepts.  \n28 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 28 of 38\n\n103.  Ms. Fernandez also avoided taking quantitative courses that she otherwise \nwould have taken, and that her sighted peers have the benefit of taking, because of \nDuke’s repeated failure to provide her accessible materials in those courses. This did not \nneed to be if Duke had done what it had promised and what, at all events, it was obligated \nto do.  \n104.  After receiving more accessible course materials, Ms. Fernandez \nexperienced a sharp increase in her grades, but she was still forced to miss out on the \nquantitative classes other students were taking because Duke failed to provide her \naccessible course materials in those classes. In the quantitative courses that she did take, \nif Duke had provided Ms. Fernandez with accessible course materials, she would have \nreceived higher grades and would have acquired a mastery of the materials expected of an \nMBA.  \n105.  In addition, Ms. Fernandez was forced to spend countless extra hours that \nshe could have devoted to her classes and extra-curricular activities to setting up and \nupdating her profile and searching for jobs and employer events on GTS because its user \nprofile, searches, and event sign ups were all inaccessible.  \n106.  Similarly, Ms. Fernandez was forced to have the Registrar register her for \nclasses, as opposed to using DukeHub like her sighted peers, requiring her to devote \nadditional time and energy to registering for classes that she could have otherwise used to \nstudy for her classes, search for a job, or participate in extra-curricular activities.  \n29 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 29 of 38\n\n107.  Ms. Fernandez became emotionally exhausted, depressed, and anxious \nfrom her efforts to get Duke to provide her with an equal opportunity to learn and from \nher efforts to overcome, on her own, the barriers Duke put in her way. \n108.  Ms. Fernandez continued to pay tuition for an inferior educational \nexperience while Duke failed to uphold its obligations. Duke failed to educate Ms. \nFernandez in an equally effective manner and prepare her to enter the job market \nalongside her sighted classmates. \nCOUNT I \nViolations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq. \n \n109.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs, as if alleged herein. \n110.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates that “[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a).  \n111.  Section 504 defines “program or activity,” in pertinent part, as “all of the \noperations of a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a \nState or of a local government; or the entity of such State or local government that \ndistributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or \nlocal government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a \nState or local government.” Id. § 794(b)(1).  \n30 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 30 of 38\n\n112.  Such federally funded programs and activities “shall take such steps as are \nnecessary to ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from \nparticipation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of the absence of \neducational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.” \n34 C.F.R. § 104.44(1); see also id. § 104.44(2).  \n113.  Duke receives federal grants, contracts, and other financial assistance, \nthereby subjecting itself to the requirements of Section 504. \n114.  Ms. Fernandez is blind and was admitted based on all general requirements \nto be a student at Duke. She and similarly situated blind students are qualified individuals \nwith a disability under Section 504. \n115.  Duke has, solely by reason of disability, excluded blind applicants,  \nstudents and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez, from applying to and effectively \nparticipating in its MBA program, denied them the benefits of the degree afforded to their \nsighted peers and otherwise discriminated against them in, its facilities, services, \nprograms, or activities. Duke’s violation of Section 504 and its regulations has denied \nblind applicant, students and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez, an equal opportunity to \naccess the educational benefits, as well as the programs and services, Duke offers and \nunless enjoined will continue to deny blind applicants, students, and alumni these \nbenefits, programs, and services..  \n116.  Duke’s actions constitute intentional discrimination on the basis of a \ndisability in violation of Section 504, in that Duke: (1) failed to effectively implement \npolicies and procedures to ensure compliance with Section 504, specifically policies that \n31 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 31 of 38\n\nprovide equal access and effective communication to individuals with disabilities; (2) \nfailed to ensure that communications with blind applicants, students, and alumni, \nincluding Ms. Fernandez, were as effective as communications with nondisabled \napplicants, students, and alumni; (3) failed to provide auxiliary aids and services or to \nmodify policies and procedures to prevent discrimination; (4) failed to provide reasonable \nmodifications of policies, practices, and procedures; (5) purchased and deployed new \nequipment and software that is inaccessible to blind applicants, students, and alumni, \nincluding Ms. Fernandez, after the effective date of Section 504; (6) failed to provide \neducational opportunities and educational information in a manner that is timely, equally \neffective, and equally integrated; and (7) otherwise discriminated against blind \napplicants, students, and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez. \n117.  As a result of Duke’s actions, Ms. Fernandez suffered and will continue to \nsuffer harm: she suffered from discrimination and unequal access to Duke’s programs \nand activities, she expended time and energy attempting to overcome Duke’s \ndiscrimination, she did not receive the grades she could have earned had she been granted \nan equal opportunity, and she did not receive the education and skills Duke’s courses are \nintended to provide. As a result of Duke’s actions, Ms. Fernandez’s grades do not \naccurately reflect her knowledge and skills, she expended tuition money as well as time \nfor benefits she did not receive, she experienced emotional distress, and she was denied \nfull access to the knowledge intended to be communicated in her classes, which she \nneeds to be successful in her career and confident in her abilities, and that prospective \nemployers expect her to have as an MBA recipient. Now that she has graduated, Ms. \n32 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 32 of 38\n\nFernandez will be denied equal access to the Career Management Center’s services and \nprograms, which are administered through inaccessible software platforms and materials, \nand are thus unavailable to blind alumni. \n118.  Unless the requested relief is granted, blind applicants, students, and \nalumni, including Ms. Fernandez, will suffer irreparable harm in that they will be \ndiscriminated against and denied equal access to the programs and activities of Duke. \n119.  As a result of Duke’s actions, NFB suffered harm: it has been and will be \nrequired to continue to expend limited resources in vindicating the rights and interests of \nblind students to receive an equal education, as well as blind applicants who seek equal \naccess to a Duke education and blind alumni who are being denied the benefits of Duke’s \ncareer development services and programs.  \n120.  The actions by Duke were done intentionally or with deliberate indifference \nto the protected rights of blind applicants, students, and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez.  \n121.  By failing to meet its obligations to provide blind individuals with \neducational opportunities that are equal to those provided to students without disabilities, \nDuke excluded Ms. Fernandez and will continue to exclude other blind applicants, \nstudents, and alumni from participating in, and enjoying the benefits of, the educational \nopportunities, facilities, services, programs, or activities offered by Duke.  \n122.  Ms. Fernandez is entitled to compensatory damages, injunctive relief, \nreasonable attorney’s fees, and costs. The NFB is entitled to injunctive relief, as well as \nreasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  \n \n33 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 33 of 38\n\nCOUNT II \nViolations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq. \n \n123.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in the preceding paragraphs, as if \nalleged herein. \n124.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq., \nguarantees equal access for qualified individuals to full and equal enjoyment of the \ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of \npublic accommodation. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182(a).  \n125.  Public accommodations are prohibited from subjecting “an \nindividual . . . on the basis of a disability . . .  to a denial of the opportunity of the \nindividual or class to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, \nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations of an entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i). \n126.  Title III of the ADA provides that no public accommodation may “afford \nan individual or class of individuals, on the basis of a disability . . . with the opportunity \nto participate in or benefit from a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or \naccommodation that is not equal to that afforded to other individuals.” 42 U.S.C. § \n12182(b)(1)(A)(ii). \n127.  Discrimination includes “a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to \nensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or \notherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary \naids and services.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). \n34 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 34 of 38\n\n128.  The regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Justice implementing \nTitle III of the ADA provide that a public accommodation “shall take those steps that \nmay be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied \nservices, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the \nabsence of auxiliary aids and services.” 28 C.F.R. § 36.303(a). For auxiliary aids and \nservices to be “effective,” they “must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely \nmanner, and in such a way as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual \nwith a disability.” 28 C.F.R. § 36.303(c)(1)(ii). \n129.  Auxiliary aids and services include: “Qualified readers; taped texts; audio \nrecordings; Brailled materials and displays; screen reader software; magnification \nsoftware; optical readers; secondary auditory programs (SAP); large print materials; \naccessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods of making \nvisually delivered materials available to individuals who are blind or have low vision.” \n“28 C.F.R. § 36.303. \n130.  Duke, as a private post-secondary school, is a public accommodation under \nTitle III of the ADA.  \n131.  As a result of Duke’s actions, Ms. Fernandez suffered and will continue to \nsuffer harm: she was denied equal access to Duke’s Career Management Center’s \nservices and programs, which are administered through inaccessible software platforms \nand materials, that will continue to be inaccessible to her and discriminate against her as \nan alumna. \n35 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 35 of 38\n\n132.  Among its members, the NFB has thousands of high school students and \ncollege students and graduates who are blind, and therefore are individuals with a \ndisability under the ADA and are entitled to the protections of the ADA. \n133.  Duke is failing to meet its obligations to provide blind applicants, students, \nand alumni with educational and career opportunities that are equal to those provided to \napplicants, students, and alumni without disabilities. Duke’s exclusion of blind \nindividuals from participation in and the benefits of the educational experience it \nprovides, denies them full and equal enjoyment of Duke’s services, and otherwise \ndiscriminates against them in, its facilities, services, programs, or activities by denying \nthem accessible educational and other materials and denying them auxiliary aids and \nservices necessary to communicate those materials effectively, timely, privately, and \nindependently. Ms. Fernandez’s experience reflects Duke’s failure to have systems in \nplace to ensure that blind students have educational opportunities equal to those provided \nto students without disabilities. \n134.  Duke’s failure to meet its obligations to provide blind individuals with \neducational and career opportunities equal to those provided to individuals without \ndisabilities constitutes an ongoing and continuous violation of the ADA and its \nsupporting regulations. Unless restrained from doing so, Duke will continue to violate the \nADA and discriminate against blind applicants, students, and alumni. Unless enjoined, \nDuke’s conduct will continue.  \n135.  Unless the requested relief is granted, blind applicants, students, and alumni \nof the NFB will suffer harm in that they will be discriminated against and denied equal \n36 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 36 of 38\n\naccess to the educational opportunities, facilities, services, programs, or activities of \nDuke, and will be unlawfully burdened in their pursuit of higher education. \n136.  As a result of Duke’s actions, NFB suffered harm: it has been and will be \nrequired to continue to expend limited resources in vindicating the rights and interests of \nblind applicants, students, and alumni to receive an equal education and access to Duke’s \nprograms and services.  \n137.  The ADA authorizes injunctive relief as appropriate relief to remedy acts of \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1). \n138.  The NFB and Ms. Fernandez are entitled to injunctive relief, as well as \nreasonable attorney’s fees and costs. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Ms. Fernandez and the NFB demand a judgment as \nfollows: \n(a)  A declaration that the Defendant has and continues to violate Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title III of the ADA;  \n(b)  An injunction: (1) prohibiting the Defendant from violating Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title III of the ADA; (2) requiring Duke to \nadopt and implement policies requiring procurement and use of accessible \neducational and other materials unless no appropriate accessible materials are \navailable; (3) requiring Duke to provide fully accessible alternative format \nversions of inaccessible course materials in a timely manner; and (4) requiring \nDuke to make its course registration and job search and employer interview \n37 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 37 of 38\n\nregistration software platforms accessible; (5) requiring Duke to make all \nresources available to alumni through the Career Management Center accessible;  \n(c)  An award of Ms. Fernandez’s compensatory damages for her time, \nemotional distress, and other damages in an amount to be determined by a jury;  \n(d)  An award of Ms. Fernandez’s and the NFB’s reasonable attorney’s \nfees and costs; and \n(e)  Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just. \nThis the 4th day of June, 2020. \n/s/ Holly Stiles     \nHolly Stiles \nN.C.

( “NFB”), \nby and through undersigned counsel, file this complaint against Defendant Duke \nUniversity (“Duke”) for denying the blind equal access to Duke’s programs and activities \nin violation of federal law. They allege as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Mary Fernandez was a graduate student at Duke. She first enrolled for the \nfall of 2018 to pursue a Master of Business Administration. Ms. Fernandez is blind and is \na member of the National Federation of the Blind. She was persuaded to select Duke in \n1 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 1 of 38\n\nlarge part because of its assurances that it could and would give her an opportunity equal \nto her sighted peers to pursue her career goals. \n2.  Instead, as set forth in detail below, Duke denied Ms. Fernandez an \nopportunity equal to that afforded her sighted peers to access course materials and \neducational technology and, as a result, denied her the opportunity to learn in an equally \neffective and integrated manner alongside her sighted peers. That denial stemmed from \nDuke’s failure to provide Ms. Fernandez timely and adequate access to: (1) course \nmaterials in an accessible format including handouts, assignments, PowerPoint \npresentations, and class notes; (2) useful tactile graphics; and (3) accessible course \nregistration and employer recruiting software programs. \n3.  Braille is Ms. Fernandez’s primary reading method. As the NFB has \nemphasized, Braille is vital to literacy for the blind.  \n4.  For digital text, Ms. Fernandez uses screen access software, Job Access \nwith Speech (“JAWS”), which displays text on a refreshable Braille display or vocalizes \nthe text using synthesized speech. Screen access software such as JAWS enables Ms. \nFernandez to use keyboard commands to easily navigate text, to change the speed of the \nvocalized text, to enhance her reading speed and comprehension, and to receive audible \ncues concerning paragraphing, punctuation, and other organizational information. In \nshort, screen access software allows Ms. Fernandez to read textual content with the same \nindependence and ease of use that visual readers enjoy.  \n5.  When digital content is properly formatted, it is universally available to \nsighted and blind alike and does not require the re-creation of text in a separate format.  \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 2 of 38\n\n6.  Recognized standards exist for the preparation and presentation of \nuniversally designed mainstream digital content. For example, the International Digital \nPublishing Forum has established the ePub 3.0.1 standard for published digital content, \nand the World Wide Web Consortium has promulgated Web Content Accessibility \nGuidelines 2.1. Accessible math content, critical to Ms. Fernandez’s educational path, is \nbest presented in MathML. Free open-source software has been written to make it easy to \nconvert equations from the language in which they are typically written (LaTex) into \nMathML. When source files are not available, equations can be pasted into Microsoft \nWord and then, with the aid of an inexpensive (approximately $30) plug-in, can be \nexported from Word into MathML.  \n7.  Like a public accommodation building an entrance with steps and no ramp, \nDuke has created accessibility problems by making procurement decision about digital \ncontent without considering whether students with disabilities will have integrated and \nimmediate access to that content. Duke compounds that failure by not timely converting \ninaccessible content to accessible content so that students with disabilities may have \naccess to course-related content at the same time as their nondisabled peers. \n8.  Universities use a wide array of software programs to help students search \nfor jobs and sign up for events on campus, including job interviews and networking \nevents. Duke has acquired inaccessible software for these activities. Consequently, Duke \nforced on Ms. Fernandez less effective and segregated communication methods, which \nmade it difficult, if not impossible, for her to acquire basic information on available jobs \nthrough the software systems used by her peers. \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 3 of 38\n\n9.  Ms. Fernandez relies on tactile graphics, including raised line illustrations \nand their accompanying Braille labels, to comprehend images and diagrams that appear \ndigitally and in print. The preparation of tactile illustration requires precision and \nexpertise. Modes of producing tactile images range in quality and accuracy. Because \ndiagrams and graphics are critical to accounting, statistics, and other quantitative courses \noffered in Duke’s MBA program, tactile graphics that are prepared accurately are an \nessential component of Ms. Fernandez’s education. Duke did not provide Ms. Fernandez \nwith an equal opportunity to access graphical information. In accounting, statistics, and \nother quantitative classes, this failure meant that she was deprived of an important body \nof information that was communicated timely and effectively to her fellow students. \n10.  Duke’s failure to provide Ms. Fernandez an equal opportunity to access the \ncontent, classroom learning, and activities in these required courses forced her to achieve \ngrades that did not reflect her intelligence, aptitude, and efforts and instead reflects only \nthe barriers to learning that Duke erected. Duke’s failure to afford Ms. Fernandez an \nequal opportunity to compete at a level commensurate with her capabilities caused her: \n(1) to expend tuition, fees, and expenses in exchange for an inferior educational \nexperience to that which Duke has offered her sighted peers; (2) lost career opportunities; \nand (3) severe emotional distress.  \n11.  Ms. Fernandez relied on Duke’s assurances of equal access and upheld her \nend of the bargain by enrolling, paying tuition, and applying herself to her studies. Duke, \nfar from providing an equal opportunity to access educational benefits, offered Ms. \nFernandez a nightmarish experience of failed and broken promises, unfair disadvantage \n4 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 4 of 38\n\nand discrimination, and an educational experience that was inferior to what she was \nentitled and what others received.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 because the claims of Ms. Fernandez and the NFB arise under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131 et seq., and Section \n504 of Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794.  \n13.  Ms. Fernandez is a resident of Woodbridge, New Jersey.  \n14.  Duke University is a not-for-profit corporation registered with the North \nCarolina Secretary of State. Its principal office is located in Durham, North Carolina. The \nacts and injuries complained of herein occurred in Durham, North Carolina. \n15.  Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(b) because the \nDefendant does business in this district, the acts constituting violations of the ADA and \nSection 504 occurred in this district, and Ms. Fernandez resides in this district. \nTHE PARTIES \n16.  Ms. Fernandez has been blind since the age of four. She grew up in \nWoodbridge, New Jersey. She graduated from Emory University with a 3.8 grade point \naverage. Duke awarded her a scholarship, as did the New Jersey Commission for the \nBlind. For the rest of her educational expenses at Duke, she has incurred student loan \ndebt.  \n17.  Ms. Fernandez enrolled at Duke for the fall of 2018 and chose Duke \nspecifically because when she was admitted to Duke but had not yet decided whether she \n5 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 5 of 38\n\nwould attend the university, Ms. Fernandez met with Duke’s Assistant Director of \nStudent Life, Daytime MBA Program, Rebecca McMillan, who assured Ms. Fernandez \nthat Duke would fulfill her requested accommodations. Ms. McMillan told Ms. \nFernandez that she would be provided Braille content for her quantitative classes and that \nshe would be able to take notes on her computer during class. In short, Ms. McMillan \nassured Ms. Fernandez that Duke took its legal obligation of equal access seriously to \nensure that Ms. Fernandez would have an academic experience equal to her fellow \nstudents. \n18.  The National Federation of the Blind, the oldest and largest national \norganization of blind persons, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation duly organized under \nthe laws of the District of Columbia and headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. It has \naffiliates in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The NFB and its affiliates \nare widely recognized by the public, Congress, executive agencies of state and federal \ngovernments, and the courts as a collective and representative voice on behalf of blind \nAmericans and their families. The organization promotes the general welfare of the blind \nby assisting the blind in their efforts to integrate themselves into society on terms of \nequality and by removing barriers that result in the denial of opportunity to blind persons \nin virtually every sphere of life, including education, employment, family and community \nlife, transportation, and recreation.  \n19.  The mission of the National Federation of the Blind is to achieve the \ncomplete integration of the blind into society on a basis of equality. This mission includes \nthe removal of legal, economic, and social discrimination against the blind. As part of its \n6 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 6 of 38\n\nmission and to achieve these goals, the NFB actively pursues advocacy, education, and \nlitigation to ensure that the blind receive equal access to the opportunities, facilities, \nservices, programs, and activities offered by institutions of higher education.  \n20.  The NFB devotes substantial resources to accessible post-secondary \neducation. It supports a division, the National Association of Blind Students, that brings \nstudents together to discuss barriers and solutions to equal access to education. Each year, \nthe NFB provides over $120,000 in scholarships to blind students pursuing their college \ncareers across all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. This is the largest \nscholarship program of its kind in the country. In addition, the NFB developed the Self-\nAdvocacy in Higher Education Toolkit to help blind students better understand the higher \neducation accommodation request process, mitigate access barriers on campus, and \nultimately to succeed as a student. \n21.  For over forty years, the NFB has been directly involved in the \ndevelopment of technology that helps blind people, including post-secondary students, \naccess print materials. In the 1970’s, it collaborated with Ray Kurzweil to develop the \nKurzweil Reading Machine, the first machine to use optical character recognition to \nconvert text to speech. More recently, the NFB led the team that evolved this \nrevolutionary technology into an app for smartphones, making it more universally \navailable to blind and other print-disabled people. To promote the development of \nuniform practices by colleges for print-disabled students, the NFB persuaded Congress to \ncreate a federal Advisory Commission for Accessible Instructional Materials in \nPostsecondary Education for Students with Disabilities (“AIM Commission”) that \n7 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 7 of 38\n\nexamined the barriers faced by students and faculty with disabilities in gaining access to \ninstructional materials and made recommendations. Currently, the NFB is working with \nthe Association of American Publishers, the Software Industry and Information \nAssociation, and the American Council on Education to support federal legislation that \nwould authorize a Federal Advisory Commission for Accessible Instructional Materials \nin Postsecondary Education for Students with Disabilities. The NFB has established a \nCenter of Excellence in Nonvisual Access (CENA) to Education, Public Information, and \nCommerce with support from the Maryland Department on Disability through a Non-\nVisual Access Initiative Grant that offers Accessibility Boutiques (introductions to \naccessibility) that are free of charge and open to the public. Boutiques on topics relevant \nto higher education include: tactile graphics, document accessibility, web accessibility, \nAmazon accessibility, Google apps, and digital books. It also conducted day-long web \naccessibility training conferences in 2014 and 2015.  \n22.  The NFB also developed the Higher Education Accessibility Online \nResource Center that provides links to accessibility standards and guidelines, guidance on \nhow to create non-visually accessible documents, links to federal guidance documents, \nand links to settlement agreements with institutions of higher education. The NFB has \ndeveloped best practices for institutions of higher education that cover policies on \naccessibility, procurement procedures, accessibility audits and corrective action plans, \nand training of faculty, staff, volunteers, and students. To educate the university \ncommunity, the NFB has done presentations on accessibility organizations of institutions \nof higher education including EDUCAUSE, the Association of Independent Colleges and \n8 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 8 of 38\n\nUniversities in Massachusetts (AICUM), the Tennessee Board of Regents, and at \nAccessible Instructional Materials and Technology in Higher Education Summit. Two \nNFB staff members participated on the Maryland Legislative Workgroup on Accessibility \nConcepts in Computer Science, Information Systems, and Information Technology \nPrograms in Higher Education. The purpose of the workgroup was to evaluate the extent \nto which accessibility is incorporated into the curriculum of computer science, \ninformation systems, and information technology programs in Maryland institutions of \nhigher education and to make recommendations.  \n23.  In addition, through collaboration, negotiation, complaints with the Office \nof Civil Rights of the Department of Education or litigation, the NFB has assisted \nstudents in resolving issues and reaching comprehensive agreements addressing access to \neducational content and software at Penn State University, Arizona State University, \nFlorida State University, University of Miami, University of Montana, Atlantic Cape \nCommunity College, Maricopa County Community College, Southern Oregon, and \nWichita State University. \n24.  The NFB has diverted significant resources to identify and counteract the \nuse of inaccessible, discriminatory technology and course materials at educational \ninstitutions, including at several colleges and universities that provide courses, job search, \nand interview opportunities similar to Duke. The NFB brings this suit in furtherance of its \nextensive efforts and expenditure of resources in promoting two of its principal missions: \nindependence of the blind and equal access to higher education institutions for the blind.  \n9 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 9 of 38\n\n25.  The NFB sues Duke in furtherance of its extensive efforts and expenditure \nof resources in working to ensure equal access to institutions of higher education for the \nblind and as a result of Duke’s frustration of the NFB’s mission. \n26.  Ms. Fernandez is a member of the NFB. \n27.  Defendant Duke is a public accommodation pursuant to 42 \nU.S.C. § 12181(7)(J). \n28.  Defendant Duke receives federal financial assistance in many forms, \nincluding, but not limited to, direct grants of assistance as well as student financial aid, \nand is therefore required to comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n29 U.S.C. § 794. \n29.  As a condition of receiving federal funds from the Department of \nEducation, Defendant Duke is required to sign a Certificate of Compliance certifying that \nit is in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nI.  Prior to matriculation at Duke \n \n30.  Ms. Fernandez applied to Duke’s MBA program in November 2017. \nBecause Duke’s web-based application was inaccessible, Ms. Fernandez was forced to \nsubmit a paper application. Upon information and belief, Ms. Fernandez was the only \n2018 applicant to Duke’s Master of Business Administration program who had to submit \na paper application, contrary to Duke’s policy that applications be completed online.  \n31.  Initially Duke mailed Ms. Fernandez inaccessible screenshots of the online \napplication that made it impossible for Ms. Fernandez to apply. The application process \n10 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 10 of 38\n\nwas overly time consuming and took far longer to complete than any of her other MBA \napplications.  \n32.  In March 2018, Ms. Fernandez learned that she had been accepted to Duke. \n33.  Duke uses course packs instead of traditional textbooks, so all the course \nmaterials are given to students in paper. Duke also generally does not allow students to \nuse computers or electronic devices in class.  \n34.  During Duke’s Admitted Student Weekend, April 5–7, 2018, Ms. \nFernandez met with Ms. McMillan to discuss the modifications that she would require for \nher course materials. Ms. Fernandez needed Braille materials and tactile graphics for \nquantitative classes, and Ms. McMillan assured Ms. Fernandez that Braille materials \nwould be provided. Ms. Fernandez also discussed with Ms. McMillan about the \naccommodations she would need for the job interview process.  \n35.  In July 2018, Ms. Fernandez took an optional one-week math refresher \ncourse. Ms. McMillan was able to provide Ms. Fernandez with hardcopy Braille course \nmaterials, so Ms. Fernandez was hopeful that Duke would provide her with the materials \nshe needed to have equal access to all of her learning opportunities. Unfortunately, Ms. \nFernandez’s hopes were dashed shortly thereafter. \n36.  Also in July 2018, Ms. McMillan assisted Ms. Fernandez with requesting \nreasonable accommodations through Duke’s Student Disability Access Office (“SDAO”).  \n37.  On July 26, 2018, Ms. Fernandez received a Formal Liaison Letter from the \nSDAO granting accommodations, including the following: \na.  Priority Registration; \n11 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 11 of 38\n\nb.  Books in Alternative Format/: Accessible Electronic or Braille; \nc.  Alternative  Format//Course  Materials/handouts  in  Alternative  Format \nAccessible Electronic or Braille; and \nd.  Alternative Format//Exams/Tests/Quizzes in Alternative Format Accessible \nElectronic or Braille.  \n38.  In late July or early August, Ms. Fernandez met with the Director of Duke’s \nCareer Management Center, Sheryle Dirks, and Mary Beck White-Sutton, her Career \nCoach, who both assured Ms. Fernandez that the accommodations she needed for the \ninterview process would be in place. \n39.  During the summer of 2018, incoming students were required to complete \nan online mathematics tutorial, MBA Math, consisting of video lectures, which were \ninaccessible, and online math problems, which were not accessible with screen access \nsoftware. Ms. Fernandez immediately contacted Ms. McMillan to inform her of these \nbarriers.  \n40.  In an attempt to resolve the accessibility issues with the tutorial, Ms. \nMcMillan signed a contract for Aira, “a service that connects blind and low-vision people \nto highly trained, remotely-located agents” to assist Ms. Fernandez. Aira agents, \nhowever, do not know mathematics and accounting principles, which made it impossible \nfor them to accurately and meaningfully describe the contents of the video lectures and \nonline problems to Ms. Fernandez. As a result, Duke waived the MBA Math tutorial \nrequirement for Ms. Fernandez, and she did not complete the course. Thus, Duke failed to \n12 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 12 of 38\n\nprovide Ms. Fernandez access equal to that of her peers, and she began her MBA \ncoursework at a disadvantage, having not received the benefit of the MBA Math tutorial.  \n41.  When it came time to register for classes, Ms. Fernandez learned that \nDukeHub, Duke’s course registration system, is not fully accessible. Although Duke \nallowed Ms. Fernandez to participate in early registration with the Registrar completing \nregistration for her, she was denied the ability to access the important information \navailable from DukeHub’s “Book Bag” feature which provides a course listing and \ncourse descriptions, and she had to rely on the Registrar to get this information. Thus, \nMs. Fernandez did not have access to Duke’s course catalogue equal to that of her sighted \npeers and could not make equally informed decisions when making course selections.  \n42.  In July 2018, Ms. Fernandez attempted to take another prerequisite online \ncourse, “Business Computer Application,” which is designed to teach students how to use \nmore advanced functions in Excel. The course consisted of five assignments and each \nassignment had ten different tabs with exercises that students had to complete. The \ninstructions were visual, using screen captures of Excel embedded in a PDF document, \nboth of which were inaccessible, to illustrate how to perform the advanced functions. The \ninstructions used arrows, circles, and other shapes in different colors drawn on top of the \nscreen captures to highlight where to find a function, which were inaccessible because \nJAWS does not indicate when there is a change in color.  \n43.  Because Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with the necessary \naccessible course materials, it waived the Business Computer Application course \nrequirement. As a result, Ms. Fernandez did not acquire the necessary skills from the \n13 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 13 of 38\n\nBusiness Computer Application course that other students acquired. Thus, Duke again \nfailed to provide Ms. Fernandez access equal to that of her peers and again disadvantaged \nher because she did not acquire the knowledge from the Business Computer Application \ncourse that her peers did and which she certainly needed and her prospective employers \nexpected her to have.  \n44.  In August 2018, Duke began its three-week Global Institute Courses, \nconsisting of three classes—two traditional and one experiential. The traditional courses, \nLeadership, Environment, and Organizations (“LEO”) and Global Institutes and \nEnvironments (“GIE”), were text-based and required papers and projects to be completed \nin teams. Although Ms. Fernandez received the LEO cases in an accessible format, she \ndid not receive them until the day or night before the class in which she was expected to \ndiscuss them, so she could not properly prepare for class. In addition, the accessible \nversions of the LEO cases often lacked informative exhibits, which Ms. Fernandez’s \nsighted peers received, that provided the full context of the case.  \n45.  Duke also failed to ensure that its web-based employer recruiting system, \nGlobal Talent System (“GTS”), which students use to learn about prospective employer \nevents, interviews, and job postings was accessible. Setting up the user profile for GTS \nwas a completely inaccessible process, and Ms. Fernandez was eventually forced to have \nan Aira agent do it for her. GTS would sometimes require users to update certain parts of \ntheir profiles, and every time Ms. Fernandez would have to contact an Aira representative \nfor assistance, otherwise she would be locked out of GTS. Once she was able to log into \nher GTS account, Ms. Fernandez learned that there was no accessible search function for \n14 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 14 of 38\n\nthe over 400 job postings on GTS that changed on a daily basis. Unlike her sighted peers, \nMs. Fernandez had to review every post every day to find just a single job posting. In \naddition, the unusable navigational structure of GTS made it impossible to quickly scan \nand skip through past postings. The sign-up system for appointments for one-on-one or \nsmall group events with employers was inaccessible, and Ms. Fernandez was forced to \nemail staff in the Career Management Center or an Aira agent to have them sign her up. \nLike the job postings, there was no accessible search function or navigation for employer \nevents and job fairs, so Ms. Fernandez had to sort through all posted events. In addition, \nGTS contains significant content, such as resume books for the first- and second-year \nclasses. Students use the resume books to connect and network with Duke alumni who \nwork at the companies they are interested in. The resume books are inaccessible because \nthe resumes are displayed as graphics, as opposed to text, and the resume books \nthemselves are PDF documents that have not been made accessible. This prevented Ms. \nFernandez from using Duke’s alumni network to aid her job search, unlike her sighted \npeers. The job search process was frustrating and incredibly time consuming. \nConsequently, Ms. Fernandez was forced to devote an immeasurable amount time and \nmental energy to searching for a job, signing up for interviews, and finding workarounds \nto the accessibility barriers GTS put in her way—time and energy that she otherwise \nwould have devoted to her classes and extra-curricular activities.  \n46.  In addition, Duke’s Career Management Center failed to take any steps to \nspeak with recruiters about accommodations for the interview process, contrary to what \n15 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 15 of 38\n\nMs. Fernandez discussed with Ms. McMillan and the Career Management Center during \norientation.  \n47.  For consulting job interviews, the employers create business mini-cases, \nnone of which were accessible. Duke has a casebook of mini-cases to aid students in \npreparing for consulting interviews, which is also inaccessible. Ms. Fernandez asked her \ncareer advisor, Mary Beth White, to do one-on-one discussions of the mini-cases in \npreparation for the consulting interviews, but Ms. White never followed up with Ms. \nFernandez. Instead, Ms. Fernandez personally found first- and second-year Duke students \nto help her prepare. Ms. Fernandez also attempted to prepare for these interviews by \nattending a class called “Road Map” offered by Duke’s consulting club, but the course \nmaterials were inaccessible. When Ms. Fernandez got to the mini-cases in the interviews, \nshe struggled, in large part because she never had access to the tools made available to all \nother students to prepare for consulting interviews. In addition, because the Career \nManagement Center failed to take any steps to request accommodations from the \nemployers for Ms. Fernandez, Ms. Fernandez had to contact the employers directly to \nrequest accessible versions of the exhibits to their mini-cases, but none of the employers \nprovided them.  \n48.  For networking purposes, Duke required students to complete a “List, \nAlumni, Motivation, Posting” (“LAMP”) whereby students would generate a list of 40 \ntarget employers using LinkedIn. Although the assignment was only intended to take 40 \nminutes, because LinkedIn is not accessible, it took much longer for Ms. Fernandez to \n16 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 16 of 38\n\ncomplete. Ultimately, Duke required Ms. Fernandez to generate ten employers instead of \n40 and she ended up being locked out of GTS because her assignment was late.  \n49.  Duke alumni can use the Career Management Center’s resume book, which \nis inaccessible and thus unavailable to a blind alumnus. Ms. Fernandez believes, now that \nshe has graduated from Duke, she will encounter similar barriers in searching for jobs \nusing Duke resources as an alumna to the ones she faced with the GTS system.  \nII.  Fall 2018  \n \n50.  Duke’s failures to provide Ms. Fernandez with equal access to \nopportunities, services, programs, and activities continued into the 2018–2019 Academic \nYear.    \n51.  Duke uses the following grading scale: Superior Pass (SP) = 4.0; High Pass \n(HP) = 3.5; Pass (P) = 3.0; Low Pass (LP) = 2.5; and Fail (F) = 0. \nA.       2018 Fall I \n52.  Ms. Fernandez registered for four courses for the Fall I Term: Financial \nAccounting, Managerial Economics, Probability and Statistics, and Leadership \nCommunication I.  \n53.  Before the Fall I Term began, Ms. McMillan repeatedly contacted \nprofessors and staff for Ms. Fernandez’s courses about providing Ms. Fernandez with \naccessible materials. On information and belief, Duke told Ms. McMillan to stop \nbothering faculty and staff.  \n17 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 17 of 38\n\n54.  In August 2018, Ms. Fernandez learned that no one had begun preparing \naccessible course materials for Managerial Economics or Probability and Statistics \nbecause Duke barred Ms. McMillan from speaking directly with the professors.  \n55.  On the first day of classes for the Fall I Term, Ms. Fernandez did not have \naccessible materials for any of her courses.  \n56.  Ms. Fernandez also learned that the online system for simulations, which \nstudents are required to use, is inaccessible. Ms. Fernandez was forced to rely on other \nstudents to complete the simulations.  \n57.  On August 10, 2018, the first Friday of the Fall I Term, the Assistant Dean, \nSteve Misuraca, and a Senior Associate Dean, Russ Morgan, asked to meet with Ms. \nFernandez. Ms. Fernandez informed Deans Misuraca and Morgan that Duke was not \nproviding her the necessary and required accessible course materials and other content, \nand that Duke’s failure to do so would negatively impact her educational opportunities, \nincluding job prospects. They apologized and acknowledged that Duke had not provided \nher accessible course materials and stated that they would work to improve the situation. \nDeans Misuraca and Morgan did not resolve the myriad problems that existed. \ni.  Financial Accounting  \n58.  The course materials for the Financial Accounting course were at least a \nweek late, so Ms. Fernandez could not prepare for class. \n59.  Eventually Ms. Fernandez received the Accounting course materials in \nMathML, which reads the equations, and not as tactile graphics with Braille explanations, \nthe format that would have permitted Ms. Fernandez to fully access the unfamiliar \n18 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 18 of 38\n\nsymbols used in the equations. In addition, the professor would use financial statements \nfrom the Target Corporation for about 30 minutes at the beginning of each class to \nillustrate the concepts he had taught in the previous course, but Duke initially failed to \nprovide Ms. Fernandez accessible versions of the financial statements, so she was \nperpetually trying to catch up in the course. Towards the end of the course, Duke \nprovided Ms. Fernandez the Target financial statements in Braille, but she received them \ntoo late for her to catch up. As a result, Ms. Fernandez was not able to prepare for class, \nprocess the course materials concurrently with the lectures, fully absorb the content, or go \nback to find mistakes.  \n60.  Because Ms. Fernandez was not provided with tactile materials, and the \nmaterials she was provided through MathML were always late, she was not able to \nmaster the content nor perform at the level of her ability. As a result, Ms. Fernandez \nreceived a P in the course.  \nii.  Managerial Economics  \n \n61.  Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with accessible course materials for \nher Managerial Economics class, even though the professor gave Duke the course \nmaterials so they could be made accessible.  \n62.  Because Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with accessible course \nmaterials, the Managerial Economics professor met with her before scheduled quizzes the \nweek of a quiz for an hour to go through the concepts being tested. However, Ms. \nFernandez was forced to sit through class without any course materials, which affected \n19 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 19 of 38\n\nher ability to understand the lectures on the materials and ask questions in real time about \ncritical course concepts. \n63.  Although other students had access to practice materials and solutions for \nquizzes two weeks in advance, the Managerial Economics professor worked through the \npractice material and the solutions for quizzes with Ms. Fernandez the day before each \nquiz.  \n64.  Although Ms. Fernandez received an HP in the course, she knows that she \ndid not acquire an actual working understanding of the materials or the proficiency \nexpected of an MBA, and only achieved her grade because she devoted an inordinate \nabout of time attempting to learn the course materials.  \niii.  Probability and Statistics \n \n65.  Dean Misuraca was the only person communicating with the Probability \nand Statistics professor because Duke had barred Ms. McMillan from doing so.  \n66.  Notwithstanding Dean Misuraca’s earlier assurances that the situation \nwould improve, Ms. Fernandez did not timely receive accessible course materials for the \nProbability and Statistics course.  \n67.  Because Duke failed to provide Ms. Fernandez with accessible course \nmaterials, she was forced to ask her fellow students to make them accessible for her. But \nthese materials did not allow her to have full access to the unfamiliar symbols in the \nequations because they were not produced as tactile graphics with Braille explanations. \n20 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 20 of 38\n\n68.  The Probability and Statistics professor’s solutions were all handwritten, so \nthe contractor creating Braille materials for Ms. Fernandez could not read them and \nconvert them to tactile graphics with Braille explanations. \n69.  Ms. Fernandez met with a Teacher’s Assistant for the course who helped \nher, including by recreating the professor’s solutions in accessible PDF documents. \nNevertheless, the Teacher’s Assistant could not complete the PDFs in time for Ms. \nFernandez to use the materials to prepare for class,  forcing her to meet with the \nTeacher’s Assistant in person, which would not have been necessary had the materials \nbeen provided in an accessible format.  \n70.  Because employers began conducting recruiting events in September, Ms. \nFernandez was unable to continue meeting with the Teacher’s Assistant as frequently as \nshe would have liked to sufficiently understand course concepts. \n71.  Ms. Fernandez was also forced to rely on second-year students to write the \nproblems out in a Word document with solutions.  \n72.  In addition, up to three Teachers Assistants devoted countless hours to \ntutoring Ms. Fernandez for each quiz because she was unable to follow the lecture in \nwhich the professor wrote on a whiteboard while he lectured and did not provide the \ncharts, problems, and other image-heavy information in an accessible format prior to \nclass. Although Duke provided Ms. Fernandez a list of Teachers Assistants she could \ncontact for tutoring, she had to schedule the tutoring sessions with the Teachers \nAssistants herself, and they were not always able to meet with her. As a result, Ms. \nFernandez devoted countless extra hours to scheduling these tutoring sessions, and \n21 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 21 of 38\n\nsometimes she was unable to receive tutoring when she needed it; Ms. Fernandez was \nforced to use the Teaching Assistants as the only means available to her to access her \ncourse materials, not as a supplement to her learning as was the case for her sighted \npeers.  \n73.  Ms. Fernandez received a P in the course but could have received a higher \ngrade if Duke had provided accessible course materials in a timely manner.  \niv.  Effect on Other Aspects of Education \n \n74.  The extra time Ms. Fernandez had to devote to overcoming inaccessible \nmaterials in classes had a domino effect on her other, non-quantitative classes that either \ndid not have course materials or for which she received accessible course materials, such \nas Managerial Communication I, and on other aspects of her life at Duke.  \n75.  Although Ms. Fernandez received an HP grade in Managerial \nCommunication I, she could have received a higher grade had she not been forced to \nspend extra time on her other courses. \n76.  Because Ms. Fernandez was forced to schedule and attend tutoring sessions \nand use other work arounds to ensure she learned the course materials, the extra time \ndoing these activities took up time for sleeping, attending recruiting events, and \nparticipating in extra-curricular activities. \n77.  Unlike her peers, Ms. Fernandez’s final exams were pushed into fall break. \nAs a result, she did not have time to rest and recuperate, or to do activities she planned to \ndo during fall break.  \n \n22 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 22 of 38\n\nB.  2018 Fall II \n78.  Ms. Fernandez registered for four courses for the Fall II Term: Global \nFinancial Management, Marketing Management, Foundations of Strategy, and \nLeadership Communication II.  Although she would have preferred to do so, she avoided \ntaking additional quantitative classes because, based on her previous experience, she \nlacked confidence that Duke would provide accessible course materials. \n79.  Duke provided the course materials for her Global Financial Management \ncourse in MathML. However, the lecture notes were text heavy and contained many \nformulas and explanations, and MathML only reads the formulas and equations. Tactile \ngraphics would have allowed Ms. Fernandez to fully comprehend the unfamiliar symbols \nin the formulas and equations. Had Ms. Fernandez received these materials in Braille \nwith tactile graphics, she would have had a much better opportunity to understand the \nconcepts being taught.  \n80.  Ms. Fernandez received a P in Global Financial Management but could \nhave received a higher grade if Duke had provided her accessible course materials that \nallowed her to fully interact with the content.  \nIII.  Spring 2019 Term  \n \n81.  In January 2019, Ms. McMillan left Duke’s Office of Institutional Equity. \nUntil Duke hired Madeleine Dreher to replace Ms. McMillan, Ms. Fernandez worked \nwith Ruth Tolman, the Director of Office of Student Life.  \n82.  Ms. Tolman was dismissive of Ms. Fernandez’s concerns over accessibility \nissues at Duke, stating that “everyone feels like they’re not going to survive.” But no \n23 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 23 of 38\n\nother student had to cope with not being able to access course materials and having to \nrepeatedly request that Duke provide them. Also, no other student had to spend extra time \nwith professors and teaching assistants just to have access to the course content or \nexperienced barriers in accessing the course registration and job search platforms.  \n83.  Due to Duke’s failure to provide accessible course materials that permitted \nMs. Fernandez to access Duke’s courses on equal terms as the other students, and Duke’s \nfailure to provide some accessible materials altogether, Ms. Fernandez continued to avoid \ntaking quantitative classes, which utilize formulas, charts, and graphs, and instead tried to \ntake as many non-quantitative courses, which required primarily required reading and \nwriting, as possible. The lack of more quantitative foundation will forever be missing \nfrom Ms. Fernandez’ MBA knowledge base. \n84.  Ms. Fernandez registered for five courses: Negotiation, Power and \nInfluence, Strategic Brand Management, Operations Management, and a Client \nConsulting Practicum. \n85.  In Operations Management, the only course that had quantitative content, \nMs. Fernandez requested the equations in Braille, and Duke contracted with a third-party \nvendor to provide them. The vendor failed to provide Braille solutions to the equations. \nAs a result, Ms. Fernandez was forced to have a friend transcribe the solutions for her, \nbut they could not be done in time for her to have the learning materials \ncontemporaneously with the lectures.  \n86.  Ms. Fernandez received a P in Operations Management but could have \nreceived a higher grade if Duke had provided accessible solutions to the equations. In the \n24 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 24 of 38\n\nfour non-quantitative courses for which Ms. Fernandez received accessible course \nmaterials—Negotiation, Power and Influence, Strategic Brand Management, and a Client \nConsulting Practicum—she received SP grades.  \nIV.  Fall 2019 & Spring 2020 Terms  \n87.  During the 2019 Fall Term, Ms. Fernandez continued to avoid taking non-\nquantitative courses due to Duke’s failure to provide these materials to her in an \naccessible format.  \n88.  In October 2019, as a result of the issues Ms. Fernandez continued to \nexperience with Duke’s failure to provide her with accessible materials, she filed a \ncomplaint with Duke’s Office of Institutional Equity.  \n89.  The Office of Student Life began creating accessible slide decks and PDF \ndocuments. However, the PDF documents continued to have accessibility errors.  \n90.  In the Spring 2020 Term, hopeful that Duke would fulfill its obligation of \nproviding accessible course materials, Ms. Fernandez registered for a quantitative course: \nArt and Application Game Theory. She requested the course materials in Braille and in \ntactile graphics because they cannot be rendered in an accessible manner using a \ncomputer program like MathML.  \n91.  Initially Duke attempted to create its own Braille materials and tactile \ngraphics. While these materials were technically accessible, Duke did not provide the \nexplanations for the equations with the tactile graphics, so Ms. Fernandez was unable to \nfully interact with the content.  \n25 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 25 of 38\n\n92.  Ms. Fernandez then received the slide decks in an accessible PDF and book \nwith professionally made tactile graphics and Braille that cited the relevant slide number, \nwhich allowed Ms. Fernandez to fully interact with the course materials.  \n93.  Ms. Fernandez’s experience in this class was far better than in any other \nquantitative course, which is reflected in the HP she received, in contrast to her other \nquantitative courses.  \nV.  Duke’s Deliberate Indifference to Equal Educational Opportunity \n \n94.  As technology and digital content has permeated post-secondary education, \nthere has been an extraordinary opportunity for students with print disabilities to have \nequal and mainstream access to the same content at the same time as everyone else. \nUnfortunately, at some campuses, like Duke, the failure to insist on accessible technology \nand content, and the failure of leadership to require accessible copies of course materials, \nassignments, graphics displayed in class, and class notes has resulted in greater inequality \nof access than existed when everything was printed on paper. This failure then \nnecessitates the use of vastly inferior after-the-fact alternate auxiliary aids and services, \nsuch as assistants/scribes/readers who, under the best of circumstances, produce less \neffective communications, who interfere with privacy, independence, and time flexibility \nfor the students who rely on them, and who, often, are insufficiently trained and \ninsufficiently available.  \n95.  Through a combination of assiduous advocacy, education, and litigation, \nthe NFB and other disability rights groups and state and federal agencies have attempted \nto focus the attention of post-secondary education on meeting the legal and moral \n26 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 26 of 38\n\nimperatives raised by these developments. The Departments of Justice and Education \nwrote the presidents of all American post-secondary institutions in June 2010 to advise \nthem that:  \nRequiring  use  of  an  emerging  technology  in  a  classroom \nenvironment when the technology is inaccessible to an entire \npopulation of individuals with disabilities- individuals with \nvisual  disabilities-  is  discrimination  prohibited  by  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) unless \nthose  individuals  are  provided  accommodations  or \nmodifications that permit them to receive all the educational \nbenefits provided by the technology in an equally effective and \nequally integrated manner. \n \nThe Departments of Justice and Education explained that this advice includes not only \nemerging technology used in the classroom, but all “online courses and other online \ncontent, such as online applications for admission, class assignments, and housing.”  \n96.  Unfortunately, since that letter, Duke has expanded its use of emerging \ntechnology to every aspect of education without making any effort to ensure the \ntechnology is accessible to an entire population of individuals with disabilities, who, like \nMs. Fernandez, cannot see. Instead, it has chosen to rely on low-tech, after-the-fact \nauxiliary aids and services that did not permit Ms. Fernandez to receive all the \neducational benefits provided by the technology, much less in an equally effective and \nequally integrated manner and that Duke, in practice, failed to provide timely or \neffectively.  \n27 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 27 of 38\n\n97.  Duke was previously subject to litigation regarding its denial of accessible \ncourse materials for a student who cannot access hard copy, print course materials. See \nElmendorf v. Duke University, 1:14-cv-697 (M.D.N.C. 2014).  \n98.  On information and belief, Duke has taken no action to identify and replace \ninaccessible technology and digital content with accessible technology and content.  \n99.  This deliberate inattention to accessibility pervades the campus beyond the \nclassroom. As mentioned earlier, Duke’s application for admission; Duke’s course \nregistration system, DukeHub; and Duke’s web-based employer recruiting system, GTS, \nare completely inaccessible to Ms. Fernandez.  \nVI.  Impact of Discrimination on Ms. Fernandez \n \n100.  Ms. Fernandez’s experiences have been humiliating and demoralizing. Ms. \nFernandez has not been given an equal and independent opportunity to learn. The grades \nshe received do not accurately reflect her knowledge and skill, but instead reflect the \ndiscrimination she suffered. \n101.  Since the fall of 2018, Ms. Fernandez worked tirelessly to pass the courses \nrequired to successfully complete a Master of Business Administration. Although she \ntook the required courses, Duke routinely failed to timely provide her with accessible \ncourse materials.  \n102.  As a result of the barriers Duke forced her to encounter, Ms. Fernandez \nreceived lower grades than she would have otherwise achieved and lacks confidence in \nher mastery of course concepts.  \n28 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 28 of 38\n\n103.  Ms. Fernandez also avoided taking quantitative courses that she otherwise \nwould have taken, and that her sighted peers have the benefit of taking, because of \nDuke’s repeated failure to provide her accessible materials in those courses. This did not \nneed to be if Duke had done what it had promised and what, at all events, it was obligated \nto do.  \n104.  After receiving more accessible course materials, Ms. Fernandez \nexperienced a sharp increase in her grades, but she was still forced to miss out on the \nquantitative classes other students were taking because Duke failed to provide her \naccessible course materials in those classes. In the quantitative courses that she did take, \nif Duke had provided Ms. Fernandez with accessible course materials, she would have \nreceived higher grades and would have acquired a mastery of the materials expected of an \nMBA.  \n105.  In addition, Ms. Fernandez was forced to spend countless extra hours that \nshe could have devoted to her classes and extra-curricular activities to setting up and \nupdating her profile and searching for jobs and employer events on GTS because its user \nprofile, searches, and event sign ups were all inaccessible.  \n106.  Similarly, Ms. Fernandez was forced to have the Registrar register her for \nclasses, as opposed to using DukeHub like her sighted peers, requiring her to devote \nadditional time and energy to registering for classes that she could have otherwise used to \nstudy for her classes, search for a job, or participate in extra-curricular activities.  \n29 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 29 of 38\n\n107.  Ms. Fernandez became emotionally exhausted, depressed, and anxious \nfrom her efforts to get Duke to provide her with an equal opportunity to learn and from \nher efforts to overcome, on her own, the barriers Duke put in her way. \n108.  Ms. Fernandez continued to pay tuition for an inferior educational \nexperience while Duke failed to uphold its obligations. Duke failed to educate Ms. \nFernandez in an equally effective manner and prepare her to enter the job market \nalongside her sighted classmates. \nCOUNT I \nViolations of § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n29 U.S.C. §§ 794 et seq. \n \n109.  Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all allegations contained in the preceding \nparagraphs, as if alleged herein. \n110.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act mandates that “[n]o otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a).  \n111.  Section 504 defines “program or activity,” in pertinent part, as “all of the \noperations of a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a \nState or of a local government; or the entity of such State or local government that \ndistributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or \nlocal government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a \nState or local government.” Id. § 794(b)(1).  \n30 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 30 of 38\n\n112.  Such federally funded programs and activities “shall take such steps as are \nnecessary to ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from \nparticipation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of the absence of \neducational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.” \n34 C.F.R. § 104.44(1); see also id. § 104.44(2).  \n113.  Duke receives federal grants, contracts, and other financial assistance, \nthereby subjecting itself to the requirements of Section 504. \n114.  Ms. Fernandez is blind and was admitted based on all general requirements \nto be a student at Duke. She and similarly situated blind students are qualified individuals \nwith a disability under Section 504. \n115.  Duke has, solely by reason of disability, excluded blind applicants,  \nstudents and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez, from applying to and effectively \nparticipating in its MBA program, denied them the benefits of the degree afforded to their \nsighted peers and otherwise discriminated against them in, its facilities, services, \nprograms, or activities. Duke’s violation of Section 504 and its regulations has denied \nblind applicant, students and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez, an equal opportunity to \naccess the educational benefits, as well as the programs and services, Duke offers and \nunless enjoined will continue to deny blind applicants, students, and alumni these \nbenefits, programs, and services..  \n116.  Duke’s actions constitute intentional discrimination on the basis of a \ndisability in violation of Section 504, in that Duke: (1) failed to effectively implement \npolicies and procedures to ensure compliance with Section 504, specifically policies that \n31 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 31 of 38\n\nprovide equal access and effective communication to individuals with disabilities; (2) \nfailed to ensure that communications with blind applicants, students, and alumni, \nincluding Ms. Fernandez, were as effective as communications with nondisabled \napplicants, students, and alumni; (3) failed to provide auxiliary aids and services or to \nmodify policies and procedures to prevent discrimination; (4) failed to provide reasonable \nmodifications of policies, practices, and procedures; (5) purchased and deployed new \nequipment and software that is inaccessible to blind applicants, students, and alumni, \nincluding Ms. Fernandez, after the effective date of Section 504; (6) failed to provide \neducational opportunities and educational information in a manner that is timely, equally \neffective, and equally integrated; and (7) otherwise discriminated against blind \napplicants, students, and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez. \n117.  As a result of Duke’s actions, Ms. Fernandez suffered and will continue to \nsuffer harm: she suffered from discrimination and unequal access to Duke’s programs \nand activities, she expended time and energy attempting to overcome Duke’s \ndiscrimination, she did not receive the grades she could have earned had she been granted \nan equal opportunity, and she did not receive the education and skills Duke’s courses are \nintended to provide. As a result of Duke’s actions, Ms. Fernandez’s grades do not \naccurately reflect her knowledge and skills, she expended tuition money as well as time \nfor benefits she did not receive, she experienced emotional distress, and she was denied \nfull access to the knowledge intended to be communicated in her classes, which she \nneeds to be successful in her career and confident in her abilities, and that prospective \nemployers expect her to have as an MBA recipient. Now that she has graduated, Ms. \n32 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 32 of 38\n\nFernandez will be denied equal access to the Career Management Center’s services and \nprograms, which are administered through inaccessible software platforms and materials, \nand are thus unavailable to blind alumni. \n118.  Unless the requested relief is granted, blind applicants, students, and \nalumni, including Ms. Fernandez, will suffer irreparable harm in that they will be \ndiscriminated against and denied equal access to the programs and activities of Duke. \n119.  As a result of Duke’s actions, NFB suffered harm: it has been and will be \nrequired to continue to expend limited resources in vindicating the rights and interests of \nblind students to receive an equal education, as well as blind applicants who seek equal \naccess to a Duke education and blind alumni who are being denied the benefits of Duke’s \ncareer development services and programs.  \n120.  The actions by Duke were done intentionally or with deliberate indifference \nto the protected rights of blind applicants, students, and alumni, including Ms. Fernandez.  \n121.  By failing to meet its obligations to provide blind individuals with \neducational opportunities that are equal to those provided to students without disabilities, \nDuke excluded Ms. Fernandez and will continue to exclude other blind applicants, \nstudents, and alumni from participating in, and enjoying the benefits of, the educational \nopportunities, facilities, services, programs, or activities offered by Duke.  \n122.  Ms. Fernandez is entitled to compensatory damages, injunctive relief, \nreasonable attorney’s fees, and costs. The NFB is entitled to injunctive relief, as well as \nreasonable attorney’s fees and costs.  \n \n33 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 33 of 38\n\nCOUNT II \nViolations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq. \n \n123.  Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in the preceding paragraphs, as if \nalleged herein. \n124.  The Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181 et seq., \nguarantees equal access for qualified individuals to full and equal enjoyment of the \ngoods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of \npublic accommodation. 42 U.S.C. §§ 12182(a).  \n125.  Public accommodations are prohibited from subjecting “an \nindividual . . . on the basis of a disability . . .  to a denial of the opportunity of the \nindividual or class to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, \nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations of an entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(A)(i). \n126.  Title III of the ADA provides that no public accommodation may “afford \nan individual or class of individuals, on the basis of a disability . . . with the opportunity \nto participate in or benefit from a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or \naccommodation that is not equal to that afforded to other individuals.” 42 U.S.C. § \n12182(b)(1)(A)(ii). \n127.  Discrimination includes “a failure to take such steps as may be necessary to \nensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or \notherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary \naids and services.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii). \n34 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 34 of 38\n\n128.  The regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Justice implementing \nTitle III of the ADA provide that a public accommodation “shall take those steps that \nmay be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded, denied \nservices, segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the \nabsence of auxiliary aids and services.” 28 C.F.R. § 36.303(a). For auxiliary aids and \nservices to be “effective,” they “must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely \nmanner, and in such a way as to protect the privacy and independence of the individual \nwith a disability.” 28 C.F.R. § 36.303(c)(1)(ii). \n129.  Auxiliary aids and services include: “Qualified readers; taped texts; audio \nrecordings; Brailled materials and displays; screen reader software; magnification \nsoftware; optical readers; secondary auditory programs (SAP); large print materials; \naccessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods of making \nvisually delivered materials available to individuals who are blind or have low vision.” \n“28 C.F.R. § 36.303. \n130.  Duke, as a private post-secondary school, is a public accommodation under \nTitle III of the ADA.  \n131.  As a result of Duke’s actions, Ms. Fernandez suffered and will continue to \nsuffer harm: she was denied equal access to Duke’s Career Management Center’s \nservices and programs, which are administered through inaccessible software platforms \nand materials, that will continue to be inaccessible to her and discriminate against her as \nan alumna. \n35 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 35 of 38\n\n132.  Among its members, the NFB has thousands of high school students and \ncollege students and graduates who are blind, and therefore are individuals with a \ndisability under the ADA and are entitled to the protections of the ADA. \n133.  Duke is failing to meet its obligations to provide blind applicants, students, \nand alumni with educational and career opportunities that are equal to those provided to \napplicants, students, and alumni without disabilities. Duke’s exclusion of blind \nindividuals from participation in and the benefits of the educational experience it \nprovides, denies them full and equal enjoyment of Duke’s services, and otherwise \ndiscriminates against them in, its facilities, services, programs, or activities by denying \nthem accessible educational and other materials and denying them auxiliary aids and \nservices necessary to communicate those materials effectively, timely, privately, and \nindependently. Ms. Fernandez’s experience reflects Duke’s failure to have systems in \nplace to ensure that blind students have educational opportunities equal to those provided \nto students without disabilities. \n134.  Duke’s failure to meet its obligations to provide blind individuals with \neducational and career opportunities equal to those provided to individuals without \ndisabilities constitutes an ongoing and continuous violation of the ADA and its \nsupporting regulations. Unless restrained from doing so, Duke will continue to violate the \nADA and discriminate against blind applicants, students, and alumni. Unless enjoined, \nDuke’s conduct will continue.  \n135.  Unless the requested relief is granted, blind applicants, students, and alumni \nof the NFB will suffer harm in that they will be discriminated against and denied equal \n36 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 36 of 38\n\naccess to the educational opportunities, facilities, services, programs, or activities of \nDuke, and will be unlawfully burdened in their pursuit of higher education. \n136.  As a result of Duke’s actions, NFB suffered harm: it has been and will be \nrequired to continue to expend limited resources in vindicating the rights and interests of \nblind applicants, students, and alumni to receive an equal education and access to Duke’s \nprograms and services.  \n137.  The ADA authorizes injunctive relief as appropriate relief to remedy acts of \ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1). \n138.  The NFB and Ms. Fernandez are entitled to injunctive relief, as well as \nreasonable attorney’s fees and costs. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs Ms. Fernandez and the NFB demand a judgment as \nfollows: \n(a)  A declaration that the Defendant has and continues to violate Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title III of the ADA;  \n(b)  An injunction: (1) prohibiting the Defendant from violating Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title III of the ADA; (2) requiring Duke to \nadopt and implement policies requiring procurement and use of accessible \neducational and other materials unless no appropriate accessible materials are \navailable; (3) requiring Duke to provide fully accessible alternative format \nversions of inaccessible course materials in a timely manner; and (4) requiring \nDuke to make its course registration and job search and employer interview \n37 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 1   Filed 06/04/20   Page 37 of 38\n\nregistration software platforms accessible; (5) requiring Duke to make all \nresources available to alumni through the Career Management Center accessible;  \n(c)  An award of Ms. Fernandez’s compensatory damages for her time, \nemotional distress, and other damages in an amount to be determined by a jury;  \n(d)  An award of Ms. Fernandez’s and the NFB’s reasonable attorney’s \nfees and costs; and \n(e)  Such other and further relief as the Court may deem just. \nThis the 4th day of June, 2020. \n/s/ Holly Stiles     \nHolly Stiles \nN.C.

(“NFB”) \n(collectively, the “Plaintiffs”).  For the reasons below, the motion is granted in part \nand denied in part.  \nI.   \n \nPlaintiffs’ claims arise from Ms. Fernandez’s experience as an applicant, \nstudent, and now alumnus at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business. (Compl. [Doc. #1] \n¶ 1.)  Plaintiffs alleged in their June 2020 Complaint that Ms. Fernandez—who is \nblind and a member of the NFB—was denied equal access to various components \nof Duke’s programs and activities in violation of Title III of the Americans with \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 1 of 18\n\nDisabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct (“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). (Compl. at 1, ¶ 1.) \nMs. Fernandez applied to Duke’s MBA program in November 2017, \nultimately selecting the University in part due to assurances from an administrator \nthat it was committed to meeting Ms. Fernandez’s accessibility needs. (Id. ¶¶ 17, \n30.)  Allegedly however, even from her initial application, Ms. Fernandez was \nconfronted with accessibility issues, so that she had to submit a paper rather than \nan electronic application and expend more time than her sighted peers to do so. \n(Id. ¶¶ 30-31.)  Once enrolled at Duke, Plaintiffs contend that the accessibility \nissues continued; for example, Ms. Fernandez was unable to access the online \nmathematics tutorial required for incoming students—even with the assistance of a \nthird-party service Duke hired to support her—so the University waived the course \nand she did not complete it. (Id. ¶¶ 39-40.)  Ms. Fernandez alleges that without \ncompleting the tutorial, she lacked the foundation for success in more advanced \ncourses that her classmates received. (Id. ¶ 40.) \nPlaintiffs argue similar inequities marked Ms. Fernandez’s time at Duke. (Id. \n¶¶ 41-93.)  Ms. Fernandez found the class registration system inaccessible; other \ncourse prerequisites—akin to the math tutorial—were inaccessible; her coursework, \ndespite earlier assurances from University administrators, was not provided in an \naccessible form, so she relied on classmates or Teaching Assistants or expended \nmore time and energy to prepare for class or complete assignments—if she was \nable to at all. (See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 41-44, 69, 71.)  She alleges she was also unable to \n2 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 2 of 18\n\nfully access Duke’s web-based employer recruiting system (“Alumni Career \nPortal”), which was the primary method for students and alumni to review and \napply for job postings. (Id. ¶ 45.)  With respect to the Alumni Career Portal, \nPlaintiffs contend that Ms. Fernandez had to spend an immeasurable amount of \ntime—and depend on the third-party service—to navigate it but was still unable to \nuse content on the Portal, such as resume books, to connect with the University’s \nalumni network given that the books were displayed as graphics rather than text. \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs believe these issues have and will persist for Ms. Fernandez as an \nalumnus, following her graduation from Duke. (Id. ¶ 49.)  Ms. Fernandez further \nargues that Duke did not mitigate her accessibility barriers as she went through the \nassociated employment recruiting process: failing to communicate with potential \nemployers regarding her needs, to provide accessible interview preparation \nmaterials, and to facilitate accessible networking resources. (Id. ¶¶ 46-49.) \nAccording to the Complaint, the University attempted to address some of \nMs. Fernandez’s accessibility challenges by, for example, hiring third-party vendors \nand, at one point, creating its own Braille materials and tactile graphics for her use. \n(Id. ¶¶ 40, 85, 89-92, 104).  However, Plaintiffs allege that Duke failed to fully \nprovide accessible programs and policies, despite the fact Ms. Fernandez made \nadministrators aware of those failures prior to graduation, including filing a \ncomplaint with the University’s Office of Institutional Equity. (Id. ¶¶ 47, 53, 57, \n65, 82, 88.)  Thus, Plaintiffs argue, because of the discrimination, Ms. Fernandez \nmade lower grades and took fewer quantitative courses than she could have; spent \n3 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 3 of 18\n\ncountless hours trying to solve accessibility issues that otherwise could have been \ndevoted to extracurriculars or other endeavors such as recruiting; and became \n“emotionally exhausted, depressed, and anxious.” (Id. ¶¶ 104-08.)  Though the \nNFB describes its purpose and activities in detail, (see id. ¶¶ 18-24), it articulated \ngenerally the harms it suffered specifically as a result of Duke’s actions, namely \nthat it was and is “required to expend limited resources in vindicating the rights \nand interests of blind students to receive an equal education, as well as blind \napplicants who seek equal access to a Duke education and blind alumni who are \nbeing denied the benefits of Duke’s career development services and programs,” \n(id. ¶ 119; see also id. ¶¶ 25, 136).  \nII.   \n \nSoon after Ms. Fernandez’s May 2020 graduation from Duke, Plaintiffs filed \nthe instant lawsuit in this Court on June 4, 2020, alleging that the University’s \npolicies and programs with respect to Ms. Fernandez and other blind students \namounted to violations of Section 504 and the ADA. (Id. ¶¶ 109-22, 123-38.)  \nPlaintiffs requested injunctive and declaratory relief for those policies and \nprograms, including the Alumni Career Portal, as well as awards of compensatory \ndamages for Ms. Fernandez and attorneys’ fees for Ms. Fernandez and the NFB. \n(Id. at 37-38.)   \nDuke then moved to partially dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. (Partial Mot. to Dismiss for Lack of \nSubject Matter Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim (“Partial Mot. to Dismiss”) \n4 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 4 of 18\n\n[Doc. #14].)  Specifically, Duke argues that Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief concerning its policies and practices for students is moot, as is \ntheir claim regarding the Alumni Career Portal, which apparently is being replaced, \nprohibiting standing for both Ms. Fernandez and the NFB. (Id. at 1-2.)  Duke also \ncontends that Ms. Fernandez’s request for compensatory damages for conduct \nprior to June 4, 2018 is time-barred—effectively excluding her allegations \nconcerning her Fall 2017 application—given Duke’s contention that their claims are \nsubject to a two-year statute of limitations. (Id. at 2.)  In support of its argument, \nDuke submitted a declaration providing information about the Alumni Career Portal \nreplacement and some evidence that accessibility was a consideration when \nselecting the replacement and that the replacement is “substantially compli[ant]” \nwith accessibility requirements under the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. \n(Decl. of Sheryle Dirks, Def.’s Br. in Supp. of Partial Mot. to Dismiss (“Def.’s Br. in \nSupp.”), Ex. 1 [Doc. #15-1] (“Dirks Decl.”).) \nIn their Response, Plaintiffs concede that Ms. Fernandez does not have \nstanding to pursue injunctive and declaratory relief for Duke’s policies and \nprocedures for students since she is no longer one, (Pls.’ Resp. in Opp’n to Def. \nDuke Univ.’s Partial Mot. to Dismiss at 13 n.2 [Doc. #16] (“Pls.’ Resp. in Opp’n”)), \nbut that the NFB has organizational standing on its own to do so, (id. at 6-12).  \nPlaintiffs further contend that the allegations as to the Alumni Career Portal are a \njusticiable controversy to which both Ms. Fernandez and the NFB on her behalf \nhave standing, and that Ms. Fernandez’s request for compensatory damages is not \n5 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 5 of 18\n\ntime-barred. (Id. at 12-22.)  Plaintiffs attached three declarations to their \nResponse, one of which was from Ms. Fernandez alleging and describing the \n“accessibility barriers” she “encountered” when she accessed the Alumni Career \nPortal replacement in August 2020. (Decl. of Mary Fernandez, Pls.’ Resp., Ex. 3 \n[Doc. #16-4] (“Fernandez Decl.”).)  The remaining two declarations describe in \nfurther detail the NFB’s mission and ways in which it seeks to achieve its mission, \n(Decl. of Mark Riccobono, Pls.’ Resp., Ex. 1 [Doc. #16-2] (“Riccobono Decl.”)), \nand challenge the appropriateness and accessibility of the Alumni Career Portal \nreplacement, (Decl. of Peter Bossley, Pl.’s Resp., Ex. 2 [Doc. #16-3]).   \na.   \n \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a party may contest a \ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction through an avenue such as standing. See, e.g., \nWhite Tail Park, Inc. v. Stroube, 413 F.3d 451, 459 (4th Cir. 2005).  A defendant \nmay bring such a “challenge in one of two ways: facially or factually.” Beck v. \nMcDonald, 848 F.3d 262, 270 (4th Cir. 2017) (citing Kerns v. United States, 585 \nF.3d 187, 192 (4th Cir. 2009)).  In a facial challenge, “the defendant may contend \n‘that a complaint simply fails to allege facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction \ncan be based,” which, “’in effect, [affords the plaintiff] the same procedural \nprotection [s]he would receive under a Rule 12(b)(6) consideration.’” Kerns, 585 \nF.3d at 192 (quoting Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982)).  In \nthat instance, “the facts alleged in the complaint are taken as true, and the motion \nmust be denied if the complaint alleges sufficient facts to invoke subject matter \n6 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 6 of 18\n\njurisdiction.” Id. (reciting applicable Rule 12(b)(6) standard); see also Wikimedia \nFound. v. Nat’l Sec. Agency, 857 F.3d 193, 212-13 (4th Cir. 2017) (declining to \nreview two declarations and other extrinsic evidence submitted by defendant given \ndefendant brought facial rather than factual challenge).    \n“On the other hand, when the defendant challenges the veracity of the facts \nunderpinning subject matter jurisdiction”—a factual challenge—“the trial court may \ngo beyond the complaint, conduct evidentiary proceedings, and resolve the \ndisputed jurisdictional facts.” Kerns, 585 F.3d at 193; see also White Tail, 413 \nF.3d at 459 (writing that the “district court may consider evidence outside the \npleadings without converting the proceeding to one for summary judgment” \n(internal citations omitted)).  Nevertheless, the Fourth Circuit has held that “when \nthe jurisdictional facts are inextricably intertwined with those central to the merits, \nthe court should resolve the relevant factual disputes only after appropriate \ndiscovery, unless the jurisdictional allegations are clearly immaterial or wholly \nunsubstantial and frivolous.” Bone v. Univ. of N.C. Health Care Sys., No. 1:10-CV-\n994, 2019 WL 4393531, at *5 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 13, 2019) (quoting Kerns, 585 \nF.3d at 193). \nb.   \n \n“The purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is to test the sufficiency of the \ncomplaint; importantly a Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not resolve contests \nsurrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.” \nEdwards v. City of Greensboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999) (internal \n7 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 7 of 18\n\ncitations omitted).  Despite this general rule, dismissal on the grounds that the \nclaim is time-barred may be raised “under ‘the relatively rare circumstances where \nfacts sufficient to rule on an affirmative defense are alleged in the complaint.’” \nTucker v. Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC, 83 F. Supp. 3d 635, 648 (D. Md. \n2015) (quoting Goodman v. Praxair, Inc., 494 F. 3d 458, 464 (4th Cir. 2007)).  \nAccordingly, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, “all facts necessary to the affirmative \ndefense [that the plaintiff’s claims are time-barred] [must] ‘clearly appear[] on the \nface of the complaint,’” Goodman, 494 F.3d at 464 (quoting Richmond, \nFredericksburg & Potomac R.R. v. Forst, 4 F.3d 244, 250 (4th Cir. 1993), and if \nthey do, “the plaintiff fails to state a claim,” Tucker, 83 F. Supp. 3d at 686 (citing \nJones v. Back, 549 U.S. 199, 214-15 (2007)).  \nc.   \n \nCentral to Duke’s motion are the doctrines of mootness and standing.  While \n“standing is determined at the commencement of a lawsuit,” Pashby v. Delia, 709 \nF.3d 307, 316 (4th Cir. 2013) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 571 n.5 (1992)), an initial finding of standing can be undone should \n“subsequent events moot the claim,” id. (citing Simmons v. United Mortg. & Loan \nInv., LLC, 634 F.3d 754, 763 (4th Cir. 2011)).  A case is rendered moot and the \ncourt deprived of subject matter jurisdiction “when the issues presented are no \nlonger ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” \nSimmons, 634 F.3d at 763 (quoting United States v. Hardy, 545 F.3d 280, 283 \n(4th Cir. 2008)); see also Ross v. Reed, 719 F.2d 689, 693-94 (4th Cir. 1983) (“If \n8 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 8 of 18\n\nintervening factual or legal events effectively dispel the case or controversy during \nthe pendency of the suit, the federal courts are powerless to decide the questions \npresented.”)  However, “a party asserting mootness bears a ‘heavy burden of \npersuading’ the court that ‘subsequent events [make] it absolutely clear that the \nallegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” Deal v. \nMercer Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 911 F.3d 183, 191 (4th Cir. 2018) (quoting Friends of \nthe Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env’t Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180 (2000)) (emphasis \nadded in original). \nAs for standing, “the question . . . is whether the litigant is entitled to have \nthe court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues,” which “involves \nboth constitutional limitations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations \non its exercise.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975); see also White Tail, \n413 F.3d at 458 (quoting Planned Parenthood of S.C. v. Rose, 361 F.3d 786, 789 \n(4th Cir. 2004) (“A justiciable case or controversy requires a plaintiff [who] has \nalleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his \ninvocation of federal court jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court’s \nremedial powers on his behalf.”)  The constitutional limitations on standing are \novercome when a plaintiff “provide[s] evidence to support the conclusion that: (1) \n‘[she] . . . suffered an injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest \nwhich is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural \nor hypothetical’; (2) ‘there [is] a causal connection between the injury and the \nconduct complained of’; and (3) ‘it [is] likely, as opposed to merely speculative, \n9 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 9 of 18\n\nthat the injury will be redressed by a federal decision.’” White Tail, 413 F.3d at \n458 (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61).  \n“The standing requirement must be satisfied by individual and organizational \nplaintiffs alike.” Id.  An organization may establish standing in its own right—\norganizational standing—“when it seeks redress for an injury suffered by the \norganization itself.” Id. (citing Warth, 422 U.S. at 511).  The requirements here are \nthe same as for an individual plaintiff. See S. Walk at Broadlands Homeowners \nAss’n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, 182 (4th Cir. 2013).  \nAn organization may also establish standing on behalf of its members—\nassociational or representational standing—when “(1) its members would otherwise \nhave standing to sue as individuals; (2) the interests at stake are germane to the \ngroup’s purpose; and (3) neither the claim made nor the relief requested requires \nthe participation of individual members in the suit.” Friends for Ferrell Parkway, \nLLC v. Stasko, 282 F.3d 315, 320 (4th Cir. 2002).  Though at the motion to \ndismiss stage, “general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant’s \nconduct may suffice” to demonstrate standing, Beck, 848 F.3d at 270 (internal \ncitations omitted in original), the allegations still must contain “sufficient ‘factual \nmatter’ to render them ‘plausible on [their] face,’” id. (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)). Further, the Court will not, “apply the same \npresumption of truth to ‘conclusory statements’ and ‘legal conclusions’ contained \nin [a plaintiff’s] complaint.” Id.; see also Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n556-56 (2007).  \n10 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 10 of 18\n\nIII.   \n \nBefore addressing the merits of Duke’s motion, the Court declines to review \nthe declarations submitted by the parties.  Duke explained in its Reply that it was \nbringing a facial challenge, which “attacks only the Complaint’s allegations” and \nthus “the Court’s analysis is based on the four corners of the Complaint” rather \nthan outside evidence. (Def.’s Br. in Reply to Pls.’ Resp. in Opp’n to Def. Duke \nUniv.’s Partial Mot. to Dismiss at 3-4 (“Def.’s Reply”).)  Therefore, the Court will \ntreat Duke’s challenge as such and not look beyond the Complaint or any \ndocument incorporated by reference. See Beck, 848 F.3d at 270; Wikimedia \nFound., 857 F.3d at 212-13. \na.   \n \nDuke contends that Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the Alumni Career Portal are \nmoot—effectively precluding standing for Ms. Fernandez and the NFB on her \nbehalf—given that it is in the process of being replaced.  However, there are no \nallegations regarding a replacement portal in the Complaint.1  Consequently, there \nis still a dispute about whether the Alumni Career Portal is accessible and whether \nany replacement “completely and irrevocably eradicate[s] the effects of the alleged \nviolation” stemming from the Portal in place at the time of Ms. Fernandez’s \n                                              \n1 Even if the Court reviewed the declarations relevant to the Alumni Career Portal, \nMs. Fernandez’s declaration alleged that she still “encountered accessibility barriers” \nwhen she accessed the replacement in August 2020, (Fernandez Decl. ¶ 9), and Ms. \nDirks’ declaration states only that the replacement “substantially complies with the \nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines” rather than with appropriate federal law, \n(Dirks Decl. ¶ 7). \n11 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 11 of 18\n\nallegations. (Def.’s Br. in Supp. at 13-14 (quoting Cnty. of Los Angeles v. Davis, \n440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)).)  Therefore, Duke has not met the “heavy burden” of \ndemonstrating mootness and the issue remains justiciable.   \nWhile Duke challenges the justiciability of Plaintiffs’ claims regarding the \nAlumni Career Portal, as well as any organizational or associational standing the \nNFB may assert with respect to Defendant’s student policies or procedures2, the \nUniversity does not appear to have contested Ms. Fernandez’s individual or the \nNFB’s associational standing should those claims not be rendered moot.  Ms. \nFernandez alleges that the process for setting up a profile on the Alumni Career \nPortal was “completely inaccessible,” requiring assistance from a third-party \nvendor, and that the Portal lacked an accessible (1) search function for navigating \njob postings, (2) sign-up system for appointments and small group events with \nemployers, and (3) content such as resume books to aid her job search. (Compl. ¶ \n45.)  Given the nature of the allegations and their connection to Duke, the Court \nfinds Ms. Fernandez has standing to pursue relief for the Alumni Career Portal. See \ngenerally Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61.   \nSimilarly, the Court finds that the NFB has associational standing to pursue \nthese claims.  As stated, Ms. Fernandez possesses individual standing in her own \n                                              \n2 Plaintiffs seemingly concede that the NFB lacks associational standing to bring \nclaims related to Duke’s student policies or procedures given that Ms. Fernandez \ndoes not have standing to do so as an alumnus and the organization has not identified \nany other individual member who would have standing. See White Tail, 413 F.3d at \n458 (requiring an organization to identify at least one member who has standing in \norder to establish associational standing). \n12 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 12 of 18\n\nright, and the action promotes the NFB’s organizational purposes of “independence \nof the blind and equal access to higher education institutions for the blind.” \n(Compl. ¶ 24). See Bone, 2019 WL 4393531, at *10.)  Further, the declaratory \nand injunctive relief sought against Duke would benefit other members of the NFB \nwithout simultaneously requiring them to participate in the litigation. See, e.g., \nWhite Tail, 413 F.3d at 458; Hunt v. W.A. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333, 343 (1977) (“If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, \ninjunction or some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed \nthat the remedy, if granted, will insure to the benefit of those members of the \nassociation actually injured.”)  Accordingly, both Ms. Fernandez and the NFB have \nstanding to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief concerning the Alumni Career \nPortal.  \nb.   \n \nDuke next challenges the NFB’s organizational standing for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief relating to Duke’s student policies and procedures.  Because \nPlaintiffs concede Ms. Fernandez lacks standing to pursue these claims as an \nalumnus and the NFB has identified no other member who would have standing, \nthe organization seeks standing on its own behalf rather than on behalf of its \nmembers.  Duke argues, among other things, that “[t]he Complaint fails to allege \nthat [its] alleged conduct hampered [the] NFB’s ‘advocacy, education or litigation \nactivities,’” and makes only “the conclusory allegation that Duke ‘frustrat[ed] . . . \n[its] mission.’” (Def.’s Reply at 4-5 (quoting Compl. ¶¶ 19, 25).)  The Court agrees \n13 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 13 of 18\n\nthat these conclusory allegations are insufficient to meet the burden for standing, \neven at the pleading stage. \nAlthough courts provide more leeway for general factual allegations at this \nstage, assuming that general allegations “embrace those specific facts necessary \nto support the claim,” Hutton v. Nat’l Bd. of Exam’rs in Optometry, Inc., 892 F.3d \n613, 620 (4th Cir. 2018), there must still be sufficient facts to plausibly and \ncausally connect the injury alleged to a defendant’s action or inaction, see Iqbal, \n556 U.S. at 678.  Although it detailed its purpose and activities, the NFB did not \nsufficiently articulate how Duke frustrated those, nor did it do more than allude to \nits need to “expend limited resources” “as a result of Duke’s actions.”  (Compl. ¶ \n136.)  Despite the presumptions in its favor, the NFB has simply not demonstrated \n“personal harm both traceable to the challenged provisions and redressable by a \nfederal court.”3 S. Walk, 713 F.3d at 182-83 (emphasis in original). Compare \nHavens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378 (1982) (finding organizational \nstanding when plaintiff-organization demonstrated defendant’s practices \n“perceptibly impaired” its activities and that “[s]uch concrete and demonstrable \ninjury to the organization’s activities—with the consequent drain on the \norganizations resources—constitutes far more than simply a setback to the \norganizations abstract social interests”) with M.D. Shall Issue, Inc. v. Hogan, 963 \n                                              \n3 Plaintiffs may have provided the Riccobono Declaration in an attempt to remedy \nthis deficiency in its Complaint; however, it could have amended its Complaint so \nthat the Court could review the more detailed allegations in response to a facial \nchallenge. \n \n14 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 14 of 18\n\nF.3d 356, 362 (4th Cir. 2020) (holding plaintiff-organization failed to demonstrate \norganizational standing by merely alleging that challenged policy “undermined” and \n“acted as an obstacle” to its purpose and message and did not “explain” how the \npolicy “perceptibly impaired its activities”). \nAccordingly, Ms. Fernandez and the NFB may seek declaratory and \ninjunctive relief for claims concerning the Alumni Career Portal but the NFB lacks \norganizational standing to pursue the same relief for Duke’s student policies and \npractices. \nIV.   \n \nDuke’s final ground for partial dismissal is that Plaintiffs’ request for \ncompensatory damages based on allegations of conduct prior to June 4, 2018 are \ntime-barred because certain claims brought pursuant to Section 504 and the ADA \ncarry a two-year statute of limitations.  The Court concurs and grants Duke’s \npartial motion on this basis.   \nNeither Section 504 nor the ADA contain a statute of limitations, so courts \ngenerally borrow the statute of limitations that applies to the most analogous \nstate-law claim. See 42 U.S.C. § 1988(a); A Soc’y Without a Name v. Virginia, \n655 F.3d 342, 347 (4th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1960 (2012) \n(addressing ADA); McCullough v. Branch Banking & Trust Co., 35 F.3d 127, 129 \n(4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1151 (1995) (addressing Section 504).  \nOne notable exception is for federal laws enacted or amended after December 1, \n1990 that do not otherwise contain a limitations period, which maintain a catch-all \n15 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 15 of 18\n\nfour-year statute of limitations provided by the Civil Justice Reform Act (“CJRA”). \n28 U.S.C ¶ 1658. See Boone v. Bd. of Governors of the Univ. of N.C., 395 F. \nSupp. 3d 657, 666-67 (M.D.N.C. 2019) (citing Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons \nCo., 541 U.S. 369, 382-83 (2004)).  Importantly, whether the CJRA’s statutory \nperiod applies depends upon whether “the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant \nwas made possible by a post-1990 amendment.” Id. (emphasis added).  The \nrelevant question then is whether Ms. Fernandez’s disability—blindness—would \nhave been recognized by the ADA and Section 504 prior to their 2008 \namendments under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act \n(“ADAAA”). \n In Runnebaum v. NationsBank of Maryland, N.A., 123 F.3d 156, 166 n.5 \n(4th Cir. 1997) (en banc), abrogated on other grounds, Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 \nU.S. 624, 631 (1998), the Fourth Circuit answered in the affirmative, prior to the \nADAAA, determining that blindness would always constitute a disability.  The \nCourt acknowledged that while “a finding of disability under the [ADA] must be \nmade on a case-by-case basis,” id. (citing Ennis v. Nat’l Ass’n of Bus. & Educ. \nRadio, Inc., 53 F.3d 55, 59 (4th Cir. 1995)), it also recognized  “that some \nconditions will always constitute impairments that substantially limit the major life \nactivities of the afflicted individuals,” id. (emphasis added).  It found one of these \nconditions was “blindness” and “[i]n such cases, an individualized determination of \nwhether the condition is an impairment that substantially limits one of more of the \nmajor life activities is unnecessary.” Id.; see also Heiko v. Colombo Savings Bank, \n16 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 16 of 18\n\nF.S.B., 434 F.3d 249, 256 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Runnebaum and writing, \n“recognition of a major life activity gives rise to the implication that certain \nimpairments are by their very nature substantially limiting: the major life activity of \nseeing, for example, is always substantially limited by blindness”). \nPlaintiffs urge the Court to allow the parties to engage in further fact-finding \nto determine the appropriate statute of limitations.  However, there are no further \nfacts to be developed for the applicable inquiry here.  The parties agree that Ms. \nFernandez has been completely blind since childhood.  Courts engaging in the kind \nof fact-finding Plaintiffs request assess “whether a given impairment substantially \nlimits one or more of the major life activities of the individual.” Runnebaum, 123 \nF.3d at 166 (citing Ennis, 53 F.3d at 59).  As the Runnebaum court wrote, \nblindness always will constitute a substantial impairment, and Plaintiffs cite no \ncase concerning total blindness suggesting otherwise.  Therefore, the Court \ndetermines that Plaintiffs’ claims for compensatory damages under Section 504 \nand the ADA are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. \nV.   \nAt this stage, Plaintiffs have standing to pursue declaratory and injunctive \nrelief pursuant to Section 504 and the ADA for claims related to the Alumni Career \nPortal, although the NFB lacks standing for the same relief for those claims arising \nfrom Duke’s student policies and procedures.  Further, Plaintiffs’ request for \ncompensatory damages are subject to a two-year statute of limitations.  Plaintiffs \n17 \n \nCase 1:20-cv-00492-NCT-JLW   Document 21   Filed 07/29/21   Page 17 of 18\n\nmay proceed with claims and requests for relief not addressed by Duke’s motion \nand ruled upon by this Court. \nVI.   \nFor the reasons stated in this Memorandum Opinion, IT IS HEREBY \nORDERED that Defendant Duke University’s Partial Motion to Dismiss [Doc. #14] is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows: it is GRANTED as to the \ninjunctive and declaratory relief sought in Counts I and II for Defendant’s student \npolicies and practices and GRANTED as to the request for compensatory damages \nfor alleged violations preceding June 4, 2018 and it is otherwise DENIED.  \nThis the 29th day of July, 2021. \n \n                    /s/ N.
