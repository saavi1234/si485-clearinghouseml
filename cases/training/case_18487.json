          "description": "ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE: Plaintiff's 2 Motion for Leave to Proceed in forma pauperis is granted. However, the court has concerns regarding whether venue in this district is proper considering that the individual defendants reside in, and the facility at issue is located in, Greene County, New York, which sits in the Northern District of New York. See 28 U.S.C. § 112(a). A substantial part of the events giving rise to plaintiff's claims occurred in the Northern District. (See ECF No. 1, Compl.) The court also understands that all the individual defendants, and the witnesses and evidence the parties will rely on to prove their claims and defenses, are located in that District. See N. Y. Mar. and Gen. Ins. Co. v. Lafarge N. Am., Inc. 599 F.3d 102, 112 (2d Cir. 2010). Therefore, plaintiff is ORDERED to show cause, by written submission to this court, no later than May 17, 2019, why this matter should not be transferred to the Northern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), in the interests of justice and for the convenience of the parties and witnesses. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to serve a copy of this order on plaintiff at his address of record. Ordered by Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto on 4/11/2019.

    "summary": "<p>This case challenged an incarcerated person's lack of access to a drug treatment program in a corrections facility due to his disabilities.</p>\r\n<p>The case began after plaintiff was excluded from a drug treatment program provided by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), due to his disabilities. The plaintiff had a number of disabilities, including a seizure disorder and heart conditions. He applied to join a drug treatment program in the DOC called SHOCK, which consists of physical exercise and work therapy along with education, and had been recommended, but not ordered, by his sentencing judge. Successful completion of the program conferred benefits on participants, including extra good time credits and the possibility of earlier release. He was denied on the basis that he was not medically fit to participate. The DOC had an alternate program for people who were court ordered to the program but could not meet the physical demands -- the Comprehensive Alcohol &amp; Substance Abuse Treatment (CASAT). However, CASAT was not made available to volunteers like the plaintiff; only to those who had been court-ordered to participate. The plaintiff filed multiple grievances throughout his term of incarceration protesting his exclusion from the program, and Disability Rights New York filed an investigation on his behalf in 2017. When DRNY&rsquo;s advocacy did not alter the DOC&rsquo;s eligibility determination, the plaintiff served a notice of intention to file a claim on the attorney general on December 23, 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On Jan. 23, 2019, a month after plaintiff's initial release from incarceration, plaintiff brought this suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. He named multiple officers of DOCCS in both their individual and official capacities, and requested compensatory and punitive damages and declaratory relief.&nbsp; Following an initial filing in the Eastern District of New York, where the plaintiff resided at the time of filing (following his release from incarceration; he has subsequently been re-incarcerated due to parole violations), the case was moved to the Northern District of New York, the proper venue for the defendants and the jurisdiction in which the plaintiff was incarcerated. Once removed, the case was before Judge David N. Hurd. The plaintiff initially filed pro se and in forma pauperis. Disability Rights New York later joined as plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on December 6, 2019. On March 31, 2020, the court ruled that his &sect; 1983 claims against DOCCS and the individual defendants in their official capacities were dismissed, as were the ADA claims against individual defendants, but the &sect; 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their individual capacities and Count II ADA claim against DOCCS could proceed.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff thereafter filed an amended complaint on June 30, 2021. Discovery disputes took place throughout 2022, and on April 30, 2023 the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. Litigation continued; most recently with defendants objections to plaintiff&rsquo;s request for an extension of page limit in further filings in relation to the motion for summary judgment following defendant&rsquo;s challenges to it, on July 25, 2023.&nbsp; On March 26, 2024 the court denied cross motions for summary judgment and indicated that the plaintiff's three claims&mdash;under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and &sect; 1983&mdash;remain for trial but certain individual defendants were dismissed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As of April 2024, the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "Plaintiff brought disability discrimination claims under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiff alleges that DOCCS excluded him from a voluntary, rehabilitative early release program because of his disability, failed to provide him an accommodation, and denied him access to an existing, accessible alternative program. Plaintiff additionally claimed that there was no rational basis for having an accessible alternative program,  but denying incarcerated people with disabilities access to that alternative, unless he or she is court-ordered into it. He sought a declaratory judgement and damages.\r\nAs of April 2024, the case is ongoing.",

Cluever, Laurie Fisher, Marie Hammond, Bryan \nHilton, L. Mardon, New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision \n(\"DOCCS\"), M. Noriega, L. O'Hara, and Brandon Smith (together \"defendants\").  Plaintiff, a \nphysically and psychologically disabled person, objects to DOCCS’s allegedly discriminatory \nhandling of its Shock Incarceration Program (\"SIP\") and its alternatives  \nGoodall’s claims rely on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"§ 1983\") and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-213 (the \"ADA\").  Defendants, for their part, have moved \nto dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  \nThe motion having been fully briefed, it will now be considered on the basis of the parties' \nsubmissions without oral argument. \n  BACKGROUND \nA. Plaintiff's Sentencing and Early Encounters with SIP. \nOn July 14, 2015, Goodall was sentenced to three to six years’ imprisonment for \nthird-degree robbery in violation of N.Y. PENAL LAW § 160.05.  Dkt. 9 (the amended complaint, \nor \"AC\"), ¶ 37.1  His sentencing judge recommended—but did not order—that plaintiff \nparticipate in SIP.  Id.  SIP is a six-month program combining intense regimentation, exercise, \nand work therapy on the one hand with \"substance abuse treatment, education, pre-release \ncounseling, and life skills counseling\" on the other.  AC ¶ 31.   \n                                            \n1 The facts are taken entirely from plaintiff's complaint and any and all documents attached to it, because for the \npurposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, this Court must \"accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint, and \nconstrue all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the complaint in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff[.]\"  Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 185 (2d Cir. 2012). \n2 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 3 of 22\nTo be eligible for SIP, an inmate must be:  (1) between sixteen and forty-nine years of \nage both currently and at the time he committed his crime; (2) serving a sentence for which \nhe will be eligible for release, on parole or otherwise, within three years; (3) free of any prior \nconviction for a violent felony offense; (4) serving a sentence for a crime that is not among \nthose that automatically render an inmate ineligible for SIP; (5) free of any outstanding \nwarrants, commitments, charges, or immigration flags; and (6) medically and psychologically \nfit for the program as determined by DOCCS or New York's Office of Mental Health \nprofessionals.  Dkt. 9-1, p. 2.2  Plaintiff alleges that he meets each of these requirements \nsave the fitness requirement.  See id.; see also AC ¶ 32.  Inmates can be placed in SIP via \nvolunteer or court order.  AC ¶ 33. \nAlternatively, DOCCS has created the Comprehensive Alcohol & Substance Abuse \nTreatment (\"CASAT\") program.  AC ¶ 33.  CASAT has similar goals to SIP, but focuses \nprimarily on education and drug abuse prevention as opposed to SIP's heavy dose of \nphysical exercise.  Id.  According to Goodall, CASAT is exclusively available to the narrow \ncategory of inmates who were explicitly ordered into SIP but who could not meet the latter \nprogram’s physical and mental fitness requirements.  Id.  Completing either program without \nincident rewards an inmate with early release from incarceration or parole.  AC ¶¶ 31, 33. \nOn July 24, 2015, Goodall was transferred from county jail to Ulster Correctional \nFacility, run by DOCCS.  AC ¶ 38.  When Goodall arrived at Ulster, he alleges that the \nfacility's medical department stamped the word \"Shock\" on his chart, but drew an X through it \nto note that they did not find him qualified for SIP.  AC ¶ 38.   \nOn July 27, 2015, Ulster's medical staff notified more explicitly in his records that he \nwas '[n]ot a [SIP] candidate.\"  AC ¶ 39.  In particular, plaintiff's classification as in need of \n                                            \n2 Pagination corresponds with CM/ECF. \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 4 of 22\n\"level three mental health services\" automatically excluded him from SIP.  AC ¶ 40.  \nAdditionally, DOCCS noted plaintiff’s heart disease, cardiac risk factors, and epilepsy as \ndisabilities that impeded his participation in SIP.  AC ¶ 41.  Plaintiff does not dispute that \nthose disabilities exist, and in fact alleges that they substantially limit \"one or more\" of his \n\"major life activities, including lifting and strenuous exercise.\"  AC ¶ 30. \nNevertheless, Goodall alleges that on October 23, 2015, he was offered a chance to \nparticipate in SIP.  AC ¶ 42.  However, his concern for his health and his fear that he would \nsuffer injury as a result of the program won out, and he declined the opportunity.  Id.  \nApparently, it struck Goodall as unfair that his only opportunity for early release \nthrough intensive therapy and treatment involved risking physical injury.  On February 19, \n2017, he submitted a Request for Reasonable Accommodations to participate in a SIP \nalternative including, potentially, CASAT.  AC ¶ 43.  Defendant Laurie Fisher (\"Fisher\"), the \nAssistant Deputy Superintendent of Programs at Greene Correctional Facility3 (\"Greene\"), \nallegedly denied plaintiff's request because SIP eligibility is determined by set requirements \nthat could not be circumvented.  Id. \nUndeterred, Goodall filed an Inmate Grievance Complaint on March 20, 2017.  \nAC ¶ 44.  That grievance argued that denying SIP violated his right to be “free from \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability\" including his rights under the ADA.  Id.  While the \ndecision on his grievance was pending, plaintiff requested to be reconsidered for SIP, but \ndefendant Offender Rehabilitation Coordinator (\"ORC\") Welytok refused to answer him.  \nAC ¶¶ 45-46.   \n                                            \n3 Apparently, at some point plaintiff was transferred to Greene from Ulster Correctional Facility, although the \ncomplaint is silent as to when—and even whether—this happened. \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 5 of 22\nOn April 24, 2017, DOCCS denied plaintiff's grievance, allegedly stating again that SIP \nis not a reasonable accommodation, but a special program targeting specific inmates.  \nAC ¶ 47.  Apparently, the denial made no mention of CASAT or any available alternative.  Id. \nB. Plaintiff's May 25, 2017 Grievance. \nOn May 23, 2017, Fisher allegedly sent Goodall an Interdepartmental Communication \ninforming him that he was not eligible for SIP because he had already refused its generic \nform and because alternatives were only available by court order.  AC ¶ 48.  Plaintiff objected \nto the communication, because the declination form he had signed back in 2015 had explicitly \nallowed him to be reconsidered for SIP if he notified an ORC that he wanted to be considered \nagain.  Id.  According to plaintiff, he had done exactly what the form instructed him to do if he \nwished to be reconsidered for SIP.  Id. ¶¶ 45-46, 48.   \nGoodall voiced his displeasure at the Interdepartmental Communication with another \ngrievance, this one dated May 25, 2017.  AC ¶ 49.  On May 30, plaintiff asked defendant M. \nNoriega (\"Noriega\"), another Greene ORC, to clarify what, precisely, the communication \nmeant.  AC ¶ 50.  In response, he alleges that he only received another Interdepartmental \nCommunication stating that his SIP application was denied because he was a violent felon, \nwhich plaintiff asserts is untrue.  Id.  \nEvidently, Goodall’s May 25 grievance was denied, because he appealed the \ngrievance to Greene's superintendent, defendant Brandon Smith (\"Smith\").  AC ¶ 55; see \nDkt. 9-21.  When Smith denied his appeal on July 31, 2017, plaintiff appealed his grievance \nfurther to DOCCS's Central Office Review Committee (\"CORC\").  AC ¶ 55.  By extension, \nplaintiff alleges that he completely exhausted his administrative remedies for this grievance.  \nId. \nC. Plaintiff's August 23, 2017 Grievance. \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 6 of 22\nSeeing one grievance through to completion did not satisfy Goodall, however.  \nEventually, on July 24, 2017, he and an unnamed ORC signed a \"Memo of Agreement\" for \nplaintiff to participate in SIP.  AC ¶ 52.  Plaintiff attached a reasonable accommodation form \nto the agreement to clarify that he still could not participate in the full program and was \nhoping for a viable alternative.  Id.  However, defendant Dr. Doreen Smith (\"Dr. Smith\"), \nGreene's Health Services Director, noted that plaintiff's seizure disorder precluded SIP \nparticipation, and Fisher further noted that SIP had specific required qualifications that could \nnot be accommodated.  AC ¶ 53.  As a result, plaintiff was denied participation in the program \nthat same day.  AC ¶ 54.  Plaintiff would grieve Dr. Smith's and Fisher's decision on August \n23, 2017.  AC ¶ 59. \n  The same pattern repeated itself several more times in the following months; Goodall \nwould request to be placed on SIP, get denied, and file a grievance, only to see the grievance \ndenied as well.  AC ¶¶ 55-65.  Meanwhile, a DOCCS Grievance Resolution Committee \nreviewed the August 23, 2017 grievance.  AC ¶ 61.  The committee stated that \"DOCCS \nshould have a medical alternative\" to SIP even if it would require a change to state law.  Id.; \nsee Dkt. 9-26.  However, the committee also noted that no further action was necessary \nbecause plaintiff had already submitted identical grievances in the past which were denied.  \nDkt. 9-26.  Plaintiff contended that the committee was wrong to find no further action possible \nbecause his grievance was based on a novel denial of SIP participation.  Id.  To express his \ndisagreement, and to exhaust his administrative remedies, plaintiff appealed the committee’s \ndetermination to Smith.  Id.; see AC ¶ 61. \n  On October 20, 2017, Smith combined Goodall's August 23, 2017 grievance with his \nseveral others, and presumably denied them all.4  AC ¶ 66.  Dissatisfied, plaintiff filed one \n                                            \n4 The complaint and its attached papers do not definitively say one way or the other whether Smith approved or \ndenied the appeal.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 7 of 22\nfinal grievance on October 27, 2017.  Dkt. 9-33, p. 1.  On December 20, 2017, Smith again \ndenied plaintiff's grievance.  AC ¶ 69.  Plaintiff alleges that he appealed this last denial to \nCORC to completely exhaust his administrative remedies.  Id.   \nApparently deciding that grievances were not going to provide him with the remedy he \nsought, plaintiff served on the Attorney General a Notice of Intention to File a Claim on \nDecember 23, 2017.  AC ¶ 70.  A year later, on December 26, 2018, Goodall was released \nfrom prison.  AC ¶ 4.  On January 23, 2019, he followed through on his intention to file a \nclaim and brought the present complaint.  Dkt. 1.  In addition to the defendants named in the \nfactual recitation above, plaintiff brought § 1983 and ADA claims against defendants Anthony \nAnnucci and Bryan Hilton as Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of DOCCS, arguing \nthat they are responsible for the conduct of their subordinates.  AC ¶¶ 6-9.   \nAdditionally, Goodall alleges that defendant Marie Hammond, as Deputy \nSuperintendent of Programs at Greene, is responsible for ensuring proper placement of \ninmates in programs.  AC ¶¶ 12-13.  Defendants L. Mardon and L. O'Hara are the \nSenior/Supervising ORCs at Greene, and thus, plaintiff alleges, were responsible for every \nclaimed deprivation their subordinates caused.  AC ¶¶ 18-21.  Finally, defendant alleges that \ndefendant A. Cluever is a Greene ORC who is similarly responsible for coordinating \nrehabilitative efforts, including ensuring that plaintiff be able to take advantage of SIP.  \nAC ¶¶ 22-23. \nOn December 6, 2019, defendants, consisting of DOCCS and several of its employees \nwho were responsible for denying plaintiff's accommodation requests, filed the present \nmotion to dismiss the complaint.  Dkt. 87. \n  LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 8 of 22\n\"A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) \nwhen the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"  Makarova \nv. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000).  \"The plaintiff bears the burden of proving \nsubject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Aurecchione v. Schoolman \nTransp. Sys., Inc., 426 F.3d 635, 638 (2d Cir. 2005).  \"In determining the existence of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, a district court may consider evidence outside the pleadings.\"  Saleh v. \nHolder, 84 F. Supp. 3d 135, 137-38 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Makarova, 201 F.3d at 113).  \n\"Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue and, thus, when a party moves to dismiss \nunder both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), the motion court must address the 12(b)(1) motion \nfirst.\"  Id. at 138 (citations omitted). \nThe Eleventh Amendment provides a limitation to district courts’ subject-matter \njurisdiction such that \"[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to \nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United \nStates by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"  U.S. \nCONST. amend. XI.  In other words, that Amendment \"generally bars suits in federal court by \nprivate individuals against non-consenting states.\"  Leitner v. Westchester Cmty. Coll., 779 \nF.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2015).  The Eleventh Amendment’s sovereign immunity extends not \nonly to cases where the state itself is a named party, but also to cases where an action is \nagainst certain state agents or instrumentalities.  Leitner, 779 F.3d at 134.   \nCongress may nevertheless abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity \nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Garcia v. SUNY Health Scis. Ctr., 280 F.3d 98, 108 \n(2d Cir. 2001).  It may only do so, however, if the statute abrogating immunity seeks to:  \n(1) prevent a State from depriving \"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law\"; (2) prevent a State from denying any person \"equal protection of the laws\"; or (3) to \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 9 of 22\nremedy or deter a State's conduct that violates those substantive guarantees, so long as \nthere is \"congruence and proportionality between the violation to be prevented or remedied \nand the means adopted to that end.\"  Id. (cleaned up). \nAlternatively, a state may waive its right to Eleventh Amendment immunity.  In re \nCharter Oak Assocs., 361 F.3d 760, 765 (2d Cir. 2004).  A State's decision to waive its \nimmunity is \"altogether voluntary” on the part of the state.  Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 675 (1999).  Therefore, under the \n\"stringent\" test for finding waiver, a State must either voluntarily invoke the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts or else make a \"clear declaration\" that it intends to submit itself to that \njurisdiction.  Id. at 675-76. \nB. Failure to State a Claim. \n\"To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the '[f]actual allegations must be enough \nto raise a right to relief above the speculative level.'\"  Ginsburg v. City of Ithaca, 839 F. Supp. \n2d 537, 540 (N.D.N.Y. 2012) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  \nInstead, the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter that it presents a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).   \nIn assessing the plausibility of the plaintiff's complaint, \"the complaint is to be \nconstrued liberally, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\"  \nGinsburg, 839 F. Supp. 2d at 540.  The complaint may be supported by \"any written \ninstrument attached to it as an exhibit, materials incorporated in it by reference, and \ndocuments that, although not incorporated by reference, are 'integral' to the complaint.\"  L-7 \nDesigns, Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC, 647 F.3d 419, 422 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing Sira v. Morton, 380 \nF.3d 57, 67 (2d Cir. 2004)). \n  DISCUSSION \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 10 of 22\nGoodall asserts two claims:  (1) a claim under § 1983 for denial of his rights to equal \nprotection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United \nStates; and (2) a claim under Title II of the ADA for denial of access to public services. \nA. Plaintiff's § 1983 Claims. \nDefendants argue for the dismissal of Goodall's § 1983 claims on two grounds:  (1) the \nEleventh Amendment provides DOCCS, as an arm of the State of New York, with sovereign \nimmunity; and (2) plaintiff failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted. \n1.  Sovereign Immunity. \nIt is undisputed that \"Congress, in passing § 1983, had no intention to disturb the \nStates' Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"  Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 \n(1989).  Moreover, New York has not waived its sovereign immunity for § 1983 claims.  See \nJones v. N.Y. Div. of Military & Naval Affairs, 166 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir. 1999).  Of course, \n\"[t]here can be no dispute that DOCCS is an agency and arm of the State of New York and, \ntherefore, entitled to New York's Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"  Czerwinski v. N.Y. State \nDep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 394 F. Supp. 3d 210, 227 (N.D.N.Y. 2019).  Claims for \nmoney damages against state officials in their official capacity are similarly barred by the \nEleventh Amendment.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167-68 (1985). \nBy extension, Goodall's § 1983 claims must be dismissed to the extent that he asserts \nthem against DOCCS or any defendant in his or her official capacity.  However, the Eleventh \nAmendment has no bearing on his § 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their \nindividual capacities.  See, e.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 31 (1991) (holding that state \nofficials may be sued in their individual capacities under § 1983). \n2.  Adequacy of Plaintiff's Pleadings. \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 11 of 22\nA plaintiff lodging an equal protection claim must demonstrate both:  (1) adverse \ntreatment as compared to similarly situated individuals; and (2) \"that such selective treatment \nwas based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish \nthe exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\"  Miner \nv. Clinton Cty., 541 F.3d 464, 474 (2d Cir. 2008) (cleaned up).  Even if a plaintiff establishes \nselective treatment, however, he must also show that that treatment cannot survive the \napplicable level of scrutiny.  Phillips v. Girdich, 408 F.3d 124, 129 (2d Cir. 2005).   \nIn turn, the appropriate level of scrutiny hinges on whether a plaintiff can establish he \nwas a member of a suspect class, a quasi-suspect class, or no class at all.  See Mass. Bd. of \nRetirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 312 (1976) (noting that if action \"interferes with the \nexercise of a fundamental right\" or disadvantages a \"suspect class\" strict scrutiny applies); \nAdkins v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 138-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (applying \nintermediate scrutiny to a \"quasi-suspect class\"); see also Spavone v. N.Y. State Dep't of \nCorr. Servs., 719 F.3d 127, 136 (2d Cir. 2013) (applying rational basis review where plaintiff \nis not member of protected class).  Being disabled or perceived as disabled does not place a \nperson in either a suspect or a quasi-suspect class.  Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 \nU.S. 356, 366-68 (2001).  As such, Goodall's claim must survive rational basis review to grant \nhim relief.  See id. \nRational basis review protects from constitutional censure any decision by a State \nwhich acts on the basis of a group's \"distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the \nState has the authority to implement[.]\"  Garrett, 531 U.S. at 366-67 (internal citations \nomitted).  In other words, a State's classification of a group of people \"cannot run afoul of the \n[e]qual [p]rotection [c]lause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of \ntreatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\"  Id. (citing Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. \n11 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 12 of 22\n312, 320 (1993)).  The plaintiff bears the pronounced burden to negative \"any reasonably \nconceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\"  Heller, \n509 U.S. at 320 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \nAlternatively, a plaintiff can also bring an equal protection claim on the basis that a \ngovernment action is treating him, as an individual, unfairly.  Fortress Bible Church v. Feiner, \n694 F.3d 208, 221 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis added) (citing Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 \nU.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam)).  These claims are commonly referred to as \"class-of-one\" \nclaims.  Feiner, 694 F.3d at 221.  If a plaintiff can establish himself as a class of one, he can \nclaim a violation of his equal protection rights based on arbitrary, disparate treatment to him \nspecifically.  NRP Holdings LLC v. City of Buffalo, 916 F.3d 177, 198 (2d Cir. 2019). \nBut to put that cart behind a proper horse, a plaintiff must first prove that:  (1) no \nrational person would view his circumstances as different from a comparator's to a degree \nthat his differential treatment would be justified based on a legitimate government policy; and \n(2) the circumstances between the plaintiff and this comparator are so similar, and the \ntreatment so different, that there is no possibility that the disparate treatment was a mistake.  \nNRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  \"[T]he standard for determining whether another person's \ncircumstances are similar to the plaintiff's [is] whether they are prima facie identical.\"  Terrill v. \nWindham-Ashland-Jewett Cent. Sch. Dist., 176 F. Supp. 3d 101, 110 (N.D.N.Y. 2016). \nAs an initial matter, some misconceptions must be cleared up as to how both parties \nhave postured their arguments on defendants' motion.  Defendants argue that because \nGoodall does not allege that he is a member of a class subject to heightened scrutiny, he \nmust bring a class-of-one claim.  For plaintiff's part, he argues that a class-of-one claim is \nsimply an interchangeable term for rational basis review. \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 13 of 22\nNeither party completely grasps the state of the law.  As the law recited above \nabundantly demonstrates, class-of-one claims are a distinct breed of equal protection claims, \nsubject to their own unique analysis.  Goodall is thus wrong to lump it together with rational \nbasis review, even though rational basis review is part of the class-of-one analysis.  Martine’s \nServ. Ctr., Inc. v. Town of Wallkill, 554 F. App’x 32, 35-36 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order) \n(“To state a class-of-one equal protection claim the plaintiff must allege that he has been \nintentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis \nfor the difference in treatment.” (cleaned up)).  But defendants are not blameless, either.   \nThey rely on Long v. Annucci, 2018 WL 6982086, at *6 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 16, 2018) for the \nproposition that a plaintiff claiming an equal protection violation based on disability must bring \na class-of-one claim.  Long, in turn, relied on Kaiser v. Highland Cent. Sch. Dist., 2008 WL \n5157450, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2008), which cited Price v. City of New York, 264 F. App'x \n66, 68 (2d Cir. 2008), for the same principle.   \nHowever, Price did not consider an equal protection claim rooted in disability writ \nlarge; it dealt with an archetypal class-of-one claim in which the plaintiff alleged that he was \ntreated differently than other similarly situated people who were injured in the course of their \nemployment.   264 F. App'x at 68.  By extension, Price never held or suggested that disabled \npersons must bring class-of-one claims.  Id.  Nor could it, considering that Garrett, the \nSupreme Court case that first held that disabled persons do not occupy a protected or \nquasi-suspect class, used generic rational basis review to analyze the claim presented and \nnever considered the existence of comparators—the hallmark of class of one analysis.  531 \nU.S. at 366-67.  By extension, the simple fact that disabled persons are not a protected class \ndoes not automatically require a disabled plaintiff to plead a class-of-one claim. \n13 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 14 of 22\nThus, each party's contention that there is only one flavor of claim available to Goodall \nis incorrect.  The question now must be whether he has cognizably alleged either claim.  As \nan initial matter, it is clear that plaintiff cannot state a class-of-one claim.  Such a claim would \nrequire that he, specifically, was denied SIP or CASAT for entirely arbitrary and personal \nreasons.  He would need to allege that there were other inmates who were permitted to enter \neither SIP or CASAT despite being so similar to him that no reasonable person would believe \nthat their admission would be owed to legitimate policy.  NRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  He \ncannot. \nAfter all, he can hardly dispute that his denial from participation in SIP and CASAT \nwas attributable to a policy duly enacted by DOCCS.  The two categories of inmates he \nidentifies as having been treated differently—those who are not disabled and those judicially \nordered into SIP—are both sufficiently different from his own circumstances so as to be \nattributable to the DOCCS policy of only admitting inmates into CASAT if they were \ncourt-ordered into SIP—rather than a target on his back.  NRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  If, \nfor example, plaintiff had been ordered into SIP and been denied entry into CASAT, he could \nbring a plausible class-of-one claim, but that is not his case.  Alternatively, if he could identify \ncomparators who were disabled and placed in CASAT despite not being judicially ordered \ninto it, that also would allow for a cognizable class-of-one claim.  But that, too, is not his case, \nand thus to whatever extent plaintiff alleges a class-of-one claim, his claim must be \ndismissed. \nHowever, that does not answer whether Goodall has stated an equal protection claim \nas a member of the class of disabled people.  Construing the complaint liberally, plaintiff has \npled that disabled people are denied the opportunity to volunteer for early release through an \nintensive rehabilitative program aimed at alcohol treatment and therapy.  AC ¶ 82.  Plaintiff \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 15 of 22\nalso alleges that there is no rational basis for having a readily available alternative to SIP but \nwalling that alternative off unless an inmate is ordered into it.  Id.   \nMoreover, looking at the complaint as alleged, Goodall has taken sufficient steps to \nnegative any potential rational basis for limiting CASAT to those inmates who are ordered \ninto SIP when the physically able have the ability to simply volunteer for the latter program.  \nAlthough it is plaintiff's burden to do so, the Court can bring no rational basis to mind, and \ndefendants' arguments in their motion to dismiss are less than persuasive.  It is doubtful that \nDOCCS saves much in the way of funding or public resources by keeping disabled inmates \nincarcerated for longer periods when CASAT already exists to offer them rehabilitative \nmeasures that result in less time and money spent feeding and housing them.   \nNor is it clear what defendants mean when they offer \"trying to preserve the uniformity \nand serve the underlying purpose of the normal shock regimen\" as a governmental interest.  \nCASAT already deviates from the normal SIP program in terms of its physical rigor, and \nlimiting CASAT participants to inmates who otherwise qualify for SIP but are physically \nincapable of participating in the exercise regimen would not appreciably change the status \nquo.   \nOf course, Goodall's burden of proving that there is no conceivable rational basis for \nthe individual defendants' alleged policy of not admitting disabled persons into CASAT if they \nare not ordered into SIP will be enormously difficult to carry forward.  Nevertheless, at this \nearly stage, plaintiff's claim cannot be so lightly dismissed.  Accordingly, defendants' motion \nto dismiss plaintiff's § 1983 claims against the individual defendants must be denied.5 \nB. Plaintiff's ADA Claims. \n                                            \n5 The Court need not reach the question of whether plaintiff has adequately alleged personal involvement by \neach defendant at this juncture, because defendants did not move to dismiss plaintiff's complaint on that ground. \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 16 of 22\nDefendants offer two familiar arguments in favor of dismissing Goodall's ADA claims:  \n(1) Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity; and (2) failure to state a claim for which relief \ncan be granted. \n1.  Sovereign Immunity. \nIn enacting the ADA, Congress unequivocally abrogated the States' Eleventh \nAmendment immunity.  42 U.S.C. § 12202.  However, as discussed above, Congress's \nauthority to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity is necessarily cabined to deprivations \nand violations of the Fourteenth Amendment where the abrogation is congruent and \nproportional to the violation.  Garcia, 280 F.3d at 108; see United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. \n151, 158-59 (2006) (discussing whether and to what extent the ADA abrogates Eleventh \nAmendment immunity). \nIn Georgia, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the ADA's \nabrogation of sovereign immunity.  546 U.S. at 158-59.  Ultimately, the Georgia court found \nthat the abrogation was constitutional as long as the particular claim that a plaintiff brings \nseeks damages for a State's conduct that \"actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Id. \nat 159.  Thus, courts must analyze on a claim-by-claim basis:  \"(1) which aspects of the \nState's alleged conduct violated Title II [of the ADA]; (2) to what extent such misconduct also \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but \ndid not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,\" whether the purported abrogation of sovereign \nimmunity is nevertheless valid.  Id. \nThe Georgia question in this case could not be much more straightforward.  Goodall's \namended complaint alleges that the same policy of limiting CASAT to disabled persons who \nwere ordered into it \"simultaneously\" denied plaintiff equal protection under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and violated Title II of the ADA.  AC ¶ 84.  Moreover, as discussed above, \n16 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 17 of 22\nplaintiff has plausibly alleged that that policy did, in fact, violate his Fourteenth Amendment \nright to equal protection under the law.  There is thus perfect overlap between defendants' \nconduct for plaintiff's § 1983 and ADA claims, and that conduct plausibly violated the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Therefore, New York's Eleventh Amendment immunity has been \nconstitutionally abrogated for the purposes of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, and defendants' motion \nto dismiss plaintiff's ADA claim on the basis of sovereign immunity must be denied. \n2.  Adequacy of Plaintiff's Pleadings. \nTo state a claim for denial of access to public services under Title II of the ADA, a \nplaintiff must show that:  (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) defendants are an \nentity subject to the ADA; and (3) plaintiff was denied the opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by \nreason of disability.  Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003).  \nAdditionally, a plaintiff must have actually requested an accommodation, although that \nrequirement is unnecessary if the disability is obvious or known to the defendant.  Brady v. \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008).  \nA qualified person with a disability is a disabled person who, \"with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions\" of the program in which \nthey hope to participate.  42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).  Additionally, to be a qualified individual, the \nplaintiff must meet every essential eligibility requirement of the program he seeks to enter.  \nMary Jo C. v. N.Y. State and Local Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2013).  A plaintiff \nis disabled within the meaning of the ADA if he:  (1) suffers from a physical or mental \nimpairment; and (2) that impairment substantially limits a major life activity upon which the \nplaintiff relies.  See Potter v. Xerox Corp., 1 F. App'x 34, 37 (2d Cir. 2001) (summary order).   \n17 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 18 of 22\nBy the language of the ADA itself, discrimination includes \"not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability who is an applicant . . . .\"  42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).  A failure to \naccommodate can only be excused if a defendant \"can demonstrate that the accommodation \nwould impose an undue hardship\" on its operations.  Id. \nTo the extent that defendants argue that Goodall's ADA claims against the individual \ndefendants in their personal capacities must be dismissed, they are correct.  Although the \nSecond Circuit has not expressly ruled that there is no available remedy under the ADA \nagainst individual defendants, the district courts of this circuit—including this one—have \noverwhelmingly done so.  See, e.g., Frantti v. N.Y., 2017 WL 922062, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, \n2017); Dominelli v. N. Country Acad., 2016 WL 616375, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2016); \nSherman v. Cty. of Suffolk, 71 F. Supp. 3d 332, 343 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).  There is no apparent \nreason to deviate from that precedent, and Goodall supplies none.  Thus, plaintiff's ADA \nclaims against the individual defendants must be dismissed. \nAs for Goodall's ADA claim against DOCCS, it is beyond dispute that DOCCS is an \nentity subject to the ADA.  Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016).  \nNeither do defendants dispute that plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, given \nhis several allegations of medical conditions that substantially limit major life activities.  AC \n¶ 30; Potter, 1 F. App'x at 37.  Additionally, plaintiff has demonstrated several times over that \nhe requested accommodation.  See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 43, 52.  Accordingly, the only questions left \nare whether Goodall:  (1) was qualified for SIP and/or CASAT; and (2) was denied access to \na program or was otherwise discriminated against on the basis of his disability. \nAs to the first question, defendants cite Doe v. Goord and Dimperio v. N.Y. Dep't of \nCorr. & Cmty. Supervision, two cases that allegedly support the proposition that Goodall is \n18 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 19 of 22\nnot qualified for SIP or CASAT.  Defendants' citation to Doe, 2005 WL 3116413, at *1-5, \n18-19 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2005) is inapposite for two reasons.  First, the Doe court found its \nplaintiff unqualified for CASAT on summary judgment, not on a motion to dismiss, and the \ndifference in standards gives pause.  Id.  Second, the Doe plaintiff was a violent felon and, as \na result, unqualified for SIP or CASAT regardless of disability, unlike plaintiff.  Id.   \nThough much more persuasive, defendants' citation to Dimperio, 2015 WL 1383831, \nat *6-7 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2015) is also inapt.  In Dimperio, this Court adopted a report and \nrecommendation to the effect that, because plaintiff was not ordered into SIP, he was not \nqualified for CASAT as a matter of law.  Id.  The Second Circuit affirmed, but did so on the \nbasis that DOCCS could not be obligated to create an alternative to SIP where none existed.6  \nDimperio v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 653 F. App'x 52, 54 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(summary order). \nHowever, the plaintiff in Dimperio was exclusively seeking entry into CASAT, or else \nthe creation of an alternative program.  2015 WL 1383831, at *6-7; 653 F. App'x at 54.  As \nGoodall correctly notes, he is not challenging that he was denied entry into CASAT or SIP.  \nNor is he calling for a new alternative to be created.  Instead, he is challenging DOCCS' \npolicy of only permitting inmates into CASAT by court order.  In other words, plaintiff is \nalleging that the court order requirement that defendants now rely on to dismiss his claim is \nitself a discriminatory act under the ADA.  \nSome explanation may be necessary.  A judicial order is not required to enter SIP. But \nSIP is not available for the physically disabled.  CASAT exists as an alternative to SIP.  But \ndisabled people can only reach CASAT by judicial order.  These four truths are undisputed.  \nTogether, however, they mean that disabled inmates face a barrier to a rehabilitative \n                                            \n6 Curiously, the Second Circuit's opinion made no mention whatsoever of CASAT.  See generally Dimperio, 653 \nF. App'x at 54. \n19 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 20 of 22\nearly-release program that physically able inmates do not.  Disabled inmates—and only \ndisabled inmates—cannot volunteer for an existing rehabilitative program, even though able \ninmates may volunteer for their corresponding program.   \nDimperio is thus a poor fit because the Second Circuit's concern with ordering the \nstate to create a new program is not the solution to Goodall's concern, all that is required is \nthat disabled inmates be given the same opportunity to volunteer for their existing program.  \n653 F. App'x at 54.  Similarly, the Dimperio District Court's ruling that its plaintiff could not \nrecover because he was not qualified for CASAT is inapplicable here because plaintiff alleges \nthat exact qualification is itself discriminatory, which that plaintiff did not.  2015 WL 1383831, \nat *6-7.   \nAssuming Goodall is correct, which this Court must on a motion to dismiss, invalidating \nhis claim based on a discriminatory qualification would destroy the purpose of an ADA claim, \nbecause ADA defendants could simply create qualifications that apply only to disabled \npeople.  A discriminatory qualification broad enough to cover the entire swath of the disabled \nwould mean that no disabled person would be qualified for the program, and thus there could \nbe no qualified disabled person capable of bringing an ADA claim.  Thus, DOCCS' policy of \nrequiring disabled inmates to be ordered into CASAT cannot render plaintiff unqualified. \nAll told, were Goodall not disabled he would be qualified for SIP, and the additional \nqualification requiring a court order for CASAT applies to him only because of his disabilities.  \nMoreover, plaintiff has adequately alleged that he meets every criteria for entry into CASAT \nand SIP other than those that he specifically objects to as discriminatory.  Therefore, plaintiff \nhas adequately alleged that he is a qualified, eligible person with a disability. \nFinally, precisely because Goodall only faces impediments to participating in the two \nexisting early release programs because of his physical and mental disabilities, it cannot be \n20 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 21 of 22\ndoubted that he was denied access to those programs because he was disabled.  As a result, \nplaintiff has adequately pled every element of a Title II ADA claim.  Defendants' motion to \ndismiss his ADA claim against DOCCS must therefore be denied. \n  CONCLUSION \nUltimately, the question at stake in this case is whether depriving disabled inmates, \nincluding Goodall, of the ability to volunteer for CASAT in the same manner that physically \nable inmates can volunteer for SIP, violated plaintiff's rights under § 1983 and the ADA.  The \nquestion poses a bit of a thicket, because it involves not one program, or even two, but rather \nthe intersectionality of SIP and CASAT.  At this juncture, plaintiff has plausibly alleged that \nDOCCS and the individual defendants run those two programs together in a manner that \nviolates his rights to equal protection and under the ADA.  His complaint must therefore \nsurvive defendants' motion to dismiss. \nTherefore, it is \nORDERED THAT \n1.  Defendants' Dkt. 87 motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN \nPART; \n2.  Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against DOCCS and the individual defendants in their \nofficial capacities are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE; \n3.  Plaintiff's ADA claims against the individual defendants are DISMISSED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE; \n4.  Plaintiff's Count I § 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their individual \ncapacities and Count II ADA claim against DOCCS may proceed; and \n5.  Defendants are directed to answer plaintiff's amended complaint no later than \nTuesday, April 14, 2020. \n21 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 22 of 22\n \n \n \n             \nDated:  March 31, 2020 \n    Utica, New York.  \n \n22 \n ",

Cluever, Laurie Fisher, Marie Hammond, Bryan \nHilton, L. Mardon, New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision \n(\"DOCCS\"), M. Noriega, L. O'Hara, and Brandon Smith (together \"defendants\").  Plaintiff, a \nphysically and psychologically disabled person, objects to DOCCS’s allegedly discriminatory \nhandling of its Shock Incarceration Program (\"SIP\") and its alternatives  \nGoodall’s claims rely on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"§ 1983\") and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-213 (the \"ADA\").  Defendants, for their part, have moved \nto dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  \nThe motion having been fully briefed, it will now be considered on the basis of the parties' \nsubmissions without oral argument. \n  BACKGROUND \nA. Plaintiff's Sentencing and Early Encounters with SIP. \nOn July 14, 2015, Goodall was sentenced to three to six years’ imprisonment for \nthird-degree robbery in violation of N.Y. PENAL LAW § 160.05.  Dkt. 9 (the amended complaint, \nor \"AC\"), ¶ 37.1  His sentencing judge recommended—but did not order—that plaintiff \nparticipate in SIP.  Id.  SIP is a six-month program combining intense regimentation, exercise, \nand work therapy on the one hand with \"substance abuse treatment, education, pre-release \ncounseling, and life skills counseling\" on the other.  AC ¶ 31.   \n                                            \n1 The facts are taken entirely from plaintiff's complaint and any and all documents attached to it, because for the \npurposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, this Court must \"accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint, and \nconstrue all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the complaint in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff[.]\"  Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 185 (2d Cir. 2012). \n2 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 3 of 22\nTo be eligible for SIP, an inmate must be:  (1) between sixteen and forty-nine years of \nage both currently and at the time he committed his crime; (2) serving a sentence for which \nhe will be eligible for release, on parole or otherwise, within three years; (3) free of any prior \nconviction for a violent felony offense; (4) serving a sentence for a crime that is not among \nthose that automatically render an inmate ineligible for SIP; (5) free of any outstanding \nwarrants, commitments, charges, or immigration flags; and (6) medically and psychologically \nfit for the program as determined by DOCCS or New York's Office of Mental Health \nprofessionals.  Dkt. 9-1, p. 2.2  Plaintiff alleges that he meets each of these requirements \nsave the fitness requirement.  See id.; see also AC ¶ 32.  Inmates can be placed in SIP via \nvolunteer or court order.  AC ¶ 33. \nAlternatively, DOCCS has created the Comprehensive Alcohol & Substance Abuse \nTreatment (\"CASAT\") program.  AC ¶ 33.  CASAT has similar goals to SIP, but focuses \nprimarily on education and drug abuse prevention as opposed to SIP's heavy dose of \nphysical exercise.  Id.  According to Goodall, CASAT is exclusively available to the narrow \ncategory of inmates who were explicitly ordered into SIP but who could not meet the latter \nprogram’s physical and mental fitness requirements.  Id.  Completing either program without \nincident rewards an inmate with early release from incarceration or parole.  AC ¶¶ 31, 33. \nOn July 24, 2015, Goodall was transferred from county jail to Ulster Correctional \nFacility, run by DOCCS.  AC ¶ 38.  When Goodall arrived at Ulster, he alleges that the \nfacility's medical department stamped the word \"Shock\" on his chart, but drew an X through it \nto note that they did not find him qualified for SIP.  AC ¶ 38.   \nOn July 27, 2015, Ulster's medical staff notified more explicitly in his records that he \nwas '[n]ot a [SIP] candidate.\"  AC ¶ 39.  In particular, plaintiff's classification as in need of \n                                            \n2 Pagination corresponds with CM/ECF. \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 4 of 22\n\"level three mental health services\" automatically excluded him from SIP.  AC ¶ 40.  \nAdditionally, DOCCS noted plaintiff’s heart disease, cardiac risk factors, and epilepsy as \ndisabilities that impeded his participation in SIP.  AC ¶ 41.  Plaintiff does not dispute that \nthose disabilities exist, and in fact alleges that they substantially limit \"one or more\" of his \n\"major life activities, including lifting and strenuous exercise.\"  AC ¶ 30. \nNevertheless, Goodall alleges that on October 23, 2015, he was offered a chance to \nparticipate in SIP.  AC ¶ 42.  However, his concern for his health and his fear that he would \nsuffer injury as a result of the program won out, and he declined the opportunity.  Id.  \nApparently, it struck Goodall as unfair that his only opportunity for early release \nthrough intensive therapy and treatment involved risking physical injury.  On February 19, \n2017, he submitted a Request for Reasonable Accommodations to participate in a SIP \nalternative including, potentially, CASAT.  AC ¶ 43.  Defendant Laurie Fisher (\"Fisher\"), the \nAssistant Deputy Superintendent of Programs at Greene Correctional Facility3 (\"Greene\"), \nallegedly denied plaintiff's request because SIP eligibility is determined by set requirements \nthat could not be circumvented.  Id. \nUndeterred, Goodall filed an Inmate Grievance Complaint on March 20, 2017.  \nAC ¶ 44.  That grievance argued that denying SIP violated his right to be “free from \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability\" including his rights under the ADA.  Id.  While the \ndecision on his grievance was pending, plaintiff requested to be reconsidered for SIP, but \ndefendant Offender Rehabilitation Coordinator (\"ORC\") Welytok refused to answer him.  \nAC ¶¶ 45-46.   \n                                            \n3 Apparently, at some point plaintiff was transferred to Greene from Ulster Correctional Facility, although the \ncomplaint is silent as to when—and even whether—this happened. \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 5 of 22\nOn April 24, 2017, DOCCS denied plaintiff's grievance, allegedly stating again that SIP \nis not a reasonable accommodation, but a special program targeting specific inmates.  \nAC ¶ 47.  Apparently, the denial made no mention of CASAT or any available alternative.  Id. \nB. Plaintiff's May 25, 2017 Grievance. \nOn May 23, 2017, Fisher allegedly sent Goodall an Interdepartmental Communication \ninforming him that he was not eligible for SIP because he had already refused its generic \nform and because alternatives were only available by court order.  AC ¶ 48.  Plaintiff objected \nto the communication, because the declination form he had signed back in 2015 had explicitly \nallowed him to be reconsidered for SIP if he notified an ORC that he wanted to be considered \nagain.  Id.  According to plaintiff, he had done exactly what the form instructed him to do if he \nwished to be reconsidered for SIP.  Id. ¶¶ 45-46, 48.   \nGoodall voiced his displeasure at the Interdepartmental Communication with another \ngrievance, this one dated May 25, 2017.  AC ¶ 49.  On May 30, plaintiff asked defendant M. \nNoriega (\"Noriega\"), another Greene ORC, to clarify what, precisely, the communication \nmeant.  AC ¶ 50.  In response, he alleges that he only received another Interdepartmental \nCommunication stating that his SIP application was denied because he was a violent felon, \nwhich plaintiff asserts is untrue.  Id.  \nEvidently, Goodall’s May 25 grievance was denied, because he appealed the \ngrievance to Greene's superintendent, defendant Brandon Smith (\"Smith\").  AC ¶ 55; see \nDkt. 9-21.  When Smith denied his appeal on July 31, 2017, plaintiff appealed his grievance \nfurther to DOCCS's Central Office Review Committee (\"CORC\").  AC ¶ 55.  By extension, \nplaintiff alleges that he completely exhausted his administrative remedies for this grievance.  \nId. \nC. Plaintiff's August 23, 2017 Grievance. \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 6 of 22\nSeeing one grievance through to completion did not satisfy Goodall, however.  \nEventually, on July 24, 2017, he and an unnamed ORC signed a \"Memo of Agreement\" for \nplaintiff to participate in SIP.  AC ¶ 52.  Plaintiff attached a reasonable accommodation form \nto the agreement to clarify that he still could not participate in the full program and was \nhoping for a viable alternative.  Id.  However, defendant Dr. Doreen Smith (\"Dr. Smith\"), \nGreene's Health Services Director, noted that plaintiff's seizure disorder precluded SIP \nparticipation, and Fisher further noted that SIP had specific required qualifications that could \nnot be accommodated.  AC ¶ 53.  As a result, plaintiff was denied participation in the program \nthat same day.  AC ¶ 54.  Plaintiff would grieve Dr. Smith's and Fisher's decision on August \n23, 2017.  AC ¶ 59. \n  The same pattern repeated itself several more times in the following months; Goodall \nwould request to be placed on SIP, get denied, and file a grievance, only to see the grievance \ndenied as well.  AC ¶¶ 55-65.  Meanwhile, a DOCCS Grievance Resolution Committee \nreviewed the August 23, 2017 grievance.  AC ¶ 61.  The committee stated that \"DOCCS \nshould have a medical alternative\" to SIP even if it would require a change to state law.  Id.; \nsee Dkt. 9-26.  However, the committee also noted that no further action was necessary \nbecause plaintiff had already submitted identical grievances in the past which were denied.  \nDkt. 9-26.  Plaintiff contended that the committee was wrong to find no further action possible \nbecause his grievance was based on a novel denial of SIP participation.  Id.  To express his \ndisagreement, and to exhaust his administrative remedies, plaintiff appealed the committee’s \ndetermination to Smith.  Id.; see AC ¶ 61. \n  On October 20, 2017, Smith combined Goodall's August 23, 2017 grievance with his \nseveral others, and presumably denied them all.4  AC ¶ 66.  Dissatisfied, plaintiff filed one \n                                            \n4 The complaint and its attached papers do not definitively say one way or the other whether Smith approved or \ndenied the appeal.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 7 of 22\nfinal grievance on October 27, 2017.  Dkt. 9-33, p. 1.  On December 20, 2017, Smith again \ndenied plaintiff's grievance.  AC ¶ 69.  Plaintiff alleges that he appealed this last denial to \nCORC to completely exhaust his administrative remedies.  Id.   \nApparently deciding that grievances were not going to provide him with the remedy he \nsought, plaintiff served on the Attorney General a Notice of Intention to File a Claim on \nDecember 23, 2017.  AC ¶ 70.  A year later, on December 26, 2018, Goodall was released \nfrom prison.  AC ¶ 4.  On January 23, 2019, he followed through on his intention to file a \nclaim and brought the present complaint.  Dkt. 1.  In addition to the defendants named in the \nfactual recitation above, plaintiff brought § 1983 and ADA claims against defendants Anthony \nAnnucci and Bryan Hilton as Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of DOCCS, arguing \nthat they are responsible for the conduct of their subordinates.  AC ¶¶ 6-9.   \nAdditionally, Goodall alleges that defendant Marie Hammond, as Deputy \nSuperintendent of Programs at Greene, is responsible for ensuring proper placement of \ninmates in programs.  AC ¶¶ 12-13.  Defendants L. Mardon and L. O'Hara are the \nSenior/Supervising ORCs at Greene, and thus, plaintiff alleges, were responsible for every \nclaimed deprivation their subordinates caused.  AC ¶¶ 18-21.  Finally, defendant alleges that \ndefendant A. Cluever is a Greene ORC who is similarly responsible for coordinating \nrehabilitative efforts, including ensuring that plaintiff be able to take advantage of SIP.  \nAC ¶¶ 22-23. \nOn December 6, 2019, defendants, consisting of DOCCS and several of its employees \nwho were responsible for denying plaintiff's accommodation requests, filed the present \nmotion to dismiss the complaint.  Dkt. 87. \n  LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 8 of 22\n\"A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) \nwhen the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"  Makarova \nv. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000).  \"The plaintiff bears the burden of proving \nsubject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Aurecchione v. Schoolman \nTransp. Sys., Inc., 426 F.3d 635, 638 (2d Cir. 2005).  \"In determining the existence of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, a district court may consider evidence outside the pleadings.\"  Saleh v. \nHolder, 84 F. Supp. 3d 135, 137-38 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Makarova, 201 F.3d at 113).  \n\"Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue and, thus, when a party moves to dismiss \nunder both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), the motion court must address the 12(b)(1) motion \nfirst.\"  Id. at 138 (citations omitted). \nThe Eleventh Amendment provides a limitation to district courts’ subject-matter \njurisdiction such that \"[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to \nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United \nStates by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"  U.S. \nCONST. amend. XI.  In other words, that Amendment \"generally bars suits in federal court by \nprivate individuals against non-consenting states.\"  Leitner v. Westchester Cmty. Coll., 779 \nF.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2015).  The Eleventh Amendment’s sovereign immunity extends not \nonly to cases where the state itself is a named party, but also to cases where an action is \nagainst certain state agents or instrumentalities.  Leitner, 779 F.3d at 134.   \nCongress may nevertheless abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity \nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Garcia v. SUNY Health Scis. Ctr., 280 F.3d 98, 108 \n(2d Cir. 2001).  It may only do so, however, if the statute abrogating immunity seeks to:  \n(1) prevent a State from depriving \"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law\"; (2) prevent a State from denying any person \"equal protection of the laws\"; or (3) to \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 9 of 22\nremedy or deter a State's conduct that violates those substantive guarantees, so long as \nthere is \"congruence and proportionality between the violation to be prevented or remedied \nand the means adopted to that end.\"  Id. (cleaned up). \nAlternatively, a state may waive its right to Eleventh Amendment immunity.  In re \nCharter Oak Assocs., 361 F.3d 760, 765 (2d Cir. 2004).  A State's decision to waive its \nimmunity is \"altogether voluntary” on the part of the state.  Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 675 (1999).  Therefore, under the \n\"stringent\" test for finding waiver, a State must either voluntarily invoke the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts or else make a \"clear declaration\" that it intends to submit itself to that \njurisdiction.  Id. at 675-76. \nB. Failure to State a Claim. \n\"To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the '[f]actual allegations must be enough \nto raise a right to relief above the speculative level.'\"  Ginsburg v. City of Ithaca, 839 F. Supp. \n2d 537, 540 (N.D.N.Y. 2012) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  \nInstead, the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter that it presents a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).   \nIn assessing the plausibility of the plaintiff's complaint, \"the complaint is to be \nconstrued liberally, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\"  \nGinsburg, 839 F. Supp. 2d at 540.  The complaint may be supported by \"any written \ninstrument attached to it as an exhibit, materials incorporated in it by reference, and \ndocuments that, although not incorporated by reference, are 'integral' to the complaint.\"  L-7 \nDesigns, Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC, 647 F.3d 419, 422 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing Sira v. Morton, 380 \nF.3d 57, 67 (2d Cir. 2004)). \n  DISCUSSION \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 10 of 22\nGoodall asserts two claims:  (1) a claim under § 1983 for denial of his rights to equal \nprotection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United \nStates; and (2) a claim under Title II of the ADA for denial of access to public services. \nA. Plaintiff's § 1983 Claims. \nDefendants argue for the dismissal of Goodall's § 1983 claims on two grounds:  (1) the \nEleventh Amendment provides DOCCS, as an arm of the State of New York, with sovereign \nimmunity; and (2) plaintiff failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted. \n1.  Sovereign Immunity. \nIt is undisputed that \"Congress, in passing § 1983, had no intention to disturb the \nStates' Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"  Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 \n(1989).  Moreover, New York has not waived its sovereign immunity for § 1983 claims.  See \nJones v. N.Y. Div. of Military & Naval Affairs, 166 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir. 1999).  Of course, \n\"[t]here can be no dispute that DOCCS is an agency and arm of the State of New York and, \ntherefore, entitled to New York's Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"  Czerwinski v. N.Y. State \nDep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 394 F. Supp. 3d 210, 227 (N.D.N.Y. 2019).  Claims for \nmoney damages against state officials in their official capacity are similarly barred by the \nEleventh Amendment.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167-68 (1985). \nBy extension, Goodall's § 1983 claims must be dismissed to the extent that he asserts \nthem against DOCCS or any defendant in his or her official capacity.  However, the Eleventh \nAmendment has no bearing on his § 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their \nindividual capacities.  See, e.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 31 (1991) (holding that state \nofficials may be sued in their individual capacities under § 1983). \n2.  Adequacy of Plaintiff's Pleadings. \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 11 of 22\nA plaintiff lodging an equal protection claim must demonstrate both:  (1) adverse \ntreatment as compared to similarly situated individuals; and (2) \"that such selective treatment \nwas based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish \nthe exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\"  Miner \nv. Clinton Cty., 541 F.3d 464, 474 (2d Cir. 2008) (cleaned up).  Even if a plaintiff establishes \nselective treatment, however, he must also show that that treatment cannot survive the \napplicable level of scrutiny.  Phillips v. Girdich, 408 F.3d 124, 129 (2d Cir. 2005).   \nIn turn, the appropriate level of scrutiny hinges on whether a plaintiff can establish he \nwas a member of a suspect class, a quasi-suspect class, or no class at all.  See Mass. Bd. of \nRetirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 312 (1976) (noting that if action \"interferes with the \nexercise of a fundamental right\" or disadvantages a \"suspect class\" strict scrutiny applies); \nAdkins v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 138-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (applying \nintermediate scrutiny to a \"quasi-suspect class\"); see also Spavone v. N.Y. State Dep't of \nCorr. Servs., 719 F.3d 127, 136 (2d Cir. 2013) (applying rational basis review where plaintiff \nis not member of protected class).  Being disabled or perceived as disabled does not place a \nperson in either a suspect or a quasi-suspect class.  Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 \nU.S. 356, 366-68 (2001).  As such, Goodall's claim must survive rational basis review to grant \nhim relief.  See id. \nRational basis review protects from constitutional censure any decision by a State \nwhich acts on the basis of a group's \"distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the \nState has the authority to implement[.]\"  Garrett, 531 U.S. at 366-67 (internal citations \nomitted).  In other words, a State's classification of a group of people \"cannot run afoul of the \n[e]qual [p]rotection [c]lause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of \ntreatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\"  Id. (citing Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. \n11 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 12 of 22\n312, 320 (1993)).  The plaintiff bears the pronounced burden to negative \"any reasonably \nconceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\"  Heller, \n509 U.S. at 320 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \nAlternatively, a plaintiff can also bring an equal protection claim on the basis that a \ngovernment action is treating him, as an individual, unfairly.  Fortress Bible Church v. Feiner, \n694 F.3d 208, 221 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis added) (citing Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 \nU.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam)).  These claims are commonly referred to as \"class-of-one\" \nclaims.  Feiner, 694 F.3d at 221.  If a plaintiff can establish himself as a class of one, he can \nclaim a violation of his equal protection rights based on arbitrary, disparate treatment to him \nspecifically.  NRP Holdings LLC v. City of Buffalo, 916 F.3d 177, 198 (2d Cir. 2019). \nBut to put that cart behind a proper horse, a plaintiff must first prove that:  (1) no \nrational person would view his circumstances as different from a comparator's to a degree \nthat his differential treatment would be justified based on a legitimate government policy; and \n(2) the circumstances between the plaintiff and this comparator are so similar, and the \ntreatment so different, that there is no possibility that the disparate treatment was a mistake.  \nNRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  \"[T]he standard for determining whether another person's \ncircumstances are similar to the plaintiff's [is] whether they are prima facie identical.\"  Terrill v. \nWindham-Ashland-Jewett Cent. Sch. Dist., 176 F. Supp. 3d 101, 110 (N.D.N.Y. 2016). \nAs an initial matter, some misconceptions must be cleared up as to how both parties \nhave postured their arguments on defendants' motion.  Defendants argue that because \nGoodall does not allege that he is a member of a class subject to heightened scrutiny, he \nmust bring a class-of-one claim.  For plaintiff's part, he argues that a class-of-one claim is \nsimply an interchangeable term for rational basis review. \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 13 of 22\nNeither party completely grasps the state of the law.  As the law recited above \nabundantly demonstrates, class-of-one claims are a distinct breed of equal protection claims, \nsubject to their own unique analysis.  Goodall is thus wrong to lump it together with rational \nbasis review, even though rational basis review is part of the class-of-one analysis.  Martine’s \nServ. Ctr., Inc. v. Town of Wallkill, 554 F. App’x 32, 35-36 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order) \n(“To state a class-of-one equal protection claim the plaintiff must allege that he has been \nintentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis \nfor the difference in treatment.” (cleaned up)).  But defendants are not blameless, either.   \nThey rely on Long v. Annucci, 2018 WL 6982086, at *6 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 16, 2018) for the \nproposition that a plaintiff claiming an equal protection violation based on disability must bring \na class-of-one claim.  Long, in turn, relied on Kaiser v. Highland Cent. Sch. Dist., 2008 WL \n5157450, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2008), which cited Price v. City of New York, 264 F. App'x \n66, 68 (2d Cir. 2008), for the same principle.   \nHowever, Price did not consider an equal protection claim rooted in disability writ \nlarge; it dealt with an archetypal class-of-one claim in which the plaintiff alleged that he was \ntreated differently than other similarly situated people who were injured in the course of their \nemployment.   264 F. App'x at 68.  By extension, Price never held or suggested that disabled \npersons must bring class-of-one claims.  Id.  Nor could it, considering that Garrett, the \nSupreme Court case that first held that disabled persons do not occupy a protected or \nquasi-suspect class, used generic rational basis review to analyze the claim presented and \nnever considered the existence of comparators—the hallmark of class of one analysis.  531 \nU.S. at 366-67.  By extension, the simple fact that disabled persons are not a protected class \ndoes not automatically require a disabled plaintiff to plead a class-of-one claim. \n13 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 14 of 22\nThus, each party's contention that there is only one flavor of claim available to Goodall \nis incorrect.  The question now must be whether he has cognizably alleged either claim.  As \nan initial matter, it is clear that plaintiff cannot state a class-of-one claim.  Such a claim would \nrequire that he, specifically, was denied SIP or CASAT for entirely arbitrary and personal \nreasons.  He would need to allege that there were other inmates who were permitted to enter \neither SIP or CASAT despite being so similar to him that no reasonable person would believe \nthat their admission would be owed to legitimate policy.  NRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  He \ncannot. \nAfter all, he can hardly dispute that his denial from participation in SIP and CASAT \nwas attributable to a policy duly enacted by DOCCS.  The two categories of inmates he \nidentifies as having been treated differently—those who are not disabled and those judicially \nordered into SIP—are both sufficiently different from his own circumstances so as to be \nattributable to the DOCCS policy of only admitting inmates into CASAT if they were \ncourt-ordered into SIP—rather than a target on his back.  NRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  If, \nfor example, plaintiff had been ordered into SIP and been denied entry into CASAT, he could \nbring a plausible class-of-one claim, but that is not his case.  Alternatively, if he could identify \ncomparators who were disabled and placed in CASAT despite not being judicially ordered \ninto it, that also would allow for a cognizable class-of-one claim.  But that, too, is not his case, \nand thus to whatever extent plaintiff alleges a class-of-one claim, his claim must be \ndismissed. \nHowever, that does not answer whether Goodall has stated an equal protection claim \nas a member of the class of disabled people.  Construing the complaint liberally, plaintiff has \npled that disabled people are denied the opportunity to volunteer for early release through an \nintensive rehabilitative program aimed at alcohol treatment and therapy.  AC ¶ 82.  Plaintiff \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 15 of 22\nalso alleges that there is no rational basis for having a readily available alternative to SIP but \nwalling that alternative off unless an inmate is ordered into it.  Id.   \nMoreover, looking at the complaint as alleged, Goodall has taken sufficient steps to \nnegative any potential rational basis for limiting CASAT to those inmates who are ordered \ninto SIP when the physically able have the ability to simply volunteer for the latter program.  \nAlthough it is plaintiff's burden to do so, the Court can bring no rational basis to mind, and \ndefendants' arguments in their motion to dismiss are less than persuasive.  It is doubtful that \nDOCCS saves much in the way of funding or public resources by keeping disabled inmates \nincarcerated for longer periods when CASAT already exists to offer them rehabilitative \nmeasures that result in less time and money spent feeding and housing them.   \nNor is it clear what defendants mean when they offer \"trying to preserve the uniformity \nand serve the underlying purpose of the normal shock regimen\" as a governmental interest.  \nCASAT already deviates from the normal SIP program in terms of its physical rigor, and \nlimiting CASAT participants to inmates who otherwise qualify for SIP but are physically \nincapable of participating in the exercise regimen would not appreciably change the status \nquo.   \nOf course, Goodall's burden of proving that there is no conceivable rational basis for \nthe individual defendants' alleged policy of not admitting disabled persons into CASAT if they \nare not ordered into SIP will be enormously difficult to carry forward.  Nevertheless, at this \nearly stage, plaintiff's claim cannot be so lightly dismissed.  Accordingly, defendants' motion \nto dismiss plaintiff's § 1983 claims against the individual defendants must be denied.5 \nB. Plaintiff's ADA Claims. \n                                            \n5 The Court need not reach the question of whether plaintiff has adequately alleged personal involvement by \neach defendant at this juncture, because defendants did not move to dismiss plaintiff's complaint on that ground. \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 16 of 22\nDefendants offer two familiar arguments in favor of dismissing Goodall's ADA claims:  \n(1) Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity; and (2) failure to state a claim for which relief \ncan be granted. \n1.  Sovereign Immunity. \nIn enacting the ADA, Congress unequivocally abrogated the States' Eleventh \nAmendment immunity.  42 U.S.C. § 12202.  However, as discussed above, Congress's \nauthority to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity is necessarily cabined to deprivations \nand violations of the Fourteenth Amendment where the abrogation is congruent and \nproportional to the violation.  Garcia, 280 F.3d at 108; see United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. \n151, 158-59 (2006) (discussing whether and to what extent the ADA abrogates Eleventh \nAmendment immunity). \nIn Georgia, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the ADA's \nabrogation of sovereign immunity.  546 U.S. at 158-59.  Ultimately, the Georgia court found \nthat the abrogation was constitutional as long as the particular claim that a plaintiff brings \nseeks damages for a State's conduct that \"actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Id. \nat 159.  Thus, courts must analyze on a claim-by-claim basis:  \"(1) which aspects of the \nState's alleged conduct violated Title II [of the ADA]; (2) to what extent such misconduct also \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but \ndid not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,\" whether the purported abrogation of sovereign \nimmunity is nevertheless valid.  Id. \nThe Georgia question in this case could not be much more straightforward.  Goodall's \namended complaint alleges that the same policy of limiting CASAT to disabled persons who \nwere ordered into it \"simultaneously\" denied plaintiff equal protection under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and violated Title II of the ADA.  AC ¶ 84.  Moreover, as discussed above, \n16 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 17 of 22\nplaintiff has plausibly alleged that that policy did, in fact, violate his Fourteenth Amendment \nright to equal protection under the law.  There is thus perfect overlap between defendants' \nconduct for plaintiff's § 1983 and ADA claims, and that conduct plausibly violated the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Therefore, New York's Eleventh Amendment immunity has been \nconstitutionally abrogated for the purposes of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, and defendants' motion \nto dismiss plaintiff's ADA claim on the basis of sovereign immunity must be denied. \n2.  Adequacy of Plaintiff's Pleadings. \nTo state a claim for denial of access to public services under Title II of the ADA, a \nplaintiff must show that:  (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) defendants are an \nentity subject to the ADA; and (3) plaintiff was denied the opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by \nreason of disability.  Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003).  \nAdditionally, a plaintiff must have actually requested an accommodation, although that \nrequirement is unnecessary if the disability is obvious or known to the defendant.  Brady v. \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008).  \nA qualified person with a disability is a disabled person who, \"with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions\" of the program in which \nthey hope to participate.  42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).  Additionally, to be a qualified individual, the \nplaintiff must meet every essential eligibility requirement of the program he seeks to enter.  \nMary Jo C. v. N.Y. State and Local Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2013).  A plaintiff \nis disabled within the meaning of the ADA if he:  (1) suffers from a physical or mental \nimpairment; and (2) that impairment substantially limits a major life activity upon which the \nplaintiff relies.  See Potter v. Xerox Corp., 1 F. App'x 34, 37 (2d Cir. 2001) (summary order).   \n17 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 18 of 22\nBy the language of the ADA itself, discrimination includes \"not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability who is an applicant . . . .\"  42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).  A failure to \naccommodate can only be excused if a defendant \"can demonstrate that the accommodation \nwould impose an undue hardship\" on its operations.  Id. \nTo the extent that defendants argue that Goodall's ADA claims against the individual \ndefendants in their personal capacities must be dismissed, they are correct.  Although the \nSecond Circuit has not expressly ruled that there is no available remedy under the ADA \nagainst individual defendants, the district courts of this circuit—including this one—have \noverwhelmingly done so.  See, e.g., Frantti v. N.Y., 2017 WL 922062, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, \n2017); Dominelli v. N. Country Acad., 2016 WL 616375, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2016); \nSherman v. Cty. of Suffolk, 71 F. Supp. 3d 332, 343 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).  There is no apparent \nreason to deviate from that precedent, and Goodall supplies none.  Thus, plaintiff's ADA \nclaims against the individual defendants must be dismissed. \nAs for Goodall's ADA claim against DOCCS, it is beyond dispute that DOCCS is an \nentity subject to the ADA.  Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016).  \nNeither do defendants dispute that plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, given \nhis several allegations of medical conditions that substantially limit major life activities.  AC \n¶ 30; Potter, 1 F. App'x at 37.  Additionally, plaintiff has demonstrated several times over that \nhe requested accommodation.  See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 43, 52.  Accordingly, the only questions left \nare whether Goodall:  (1) was qualified for SIP and/or CASAT; and (2) was denied access to \na program or was otherwise discriminated against on the basis of his disability. \nAs to the first question, defendants cite Doe v. Goord and Dimperio v. N.Y. Dep't of \nCorr. & Cmty. Supervision, two cases that allegedly support the proposition that Goodall is \n18 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 19 of 22\nnot qualified for SIP or CASAT.  Defendants' citation to Doe, 2005 WL 3116413, at *1-5, \n18-19 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2005) is inapposite for two reasons.  First, the Doe court found its \nplaintiff unqualified for CASAT on summary judgment, not on a motion to dismiss, and the \ndifference in standards gives pause.  Id.  Second, the Doe plaintiff was a violent felon and, as \na result, unqualified for SIP or CASAT regardless of disability, unlike plaintiff.  Id.   \nThough much more persuasive, defendants' citation to Dimperio, 2015 WL 1383831, \nat *6-7 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2015) is also inapt.  In Dimperio, this Court adopted a report and \nrecommendation to the effect that, because plaintiff was not ordered into SIP, he was not \nqualified for CASAT as a matter of law.  Id.  The Second Circuit affirmed, but did so on the \nbasis that DOCCS could not be obligated to create an alternative to SIP where none existed.6  \nDimperio v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 653 F. App'x 52, 54 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(summary order). \nHowever, the plaintiff in Dimperio was exclusively seeking entry into CASAT, or else \nthe creation of an alternative program.  2015 WL 1383831, at *6-7; 653 F. App'x at 54.  As \nGoodall correctly notes, he is not challenging that he was denied entry into CASAT or SIP.  \nNor is he calling for a new alternative to be created.  Instead, he is challenging DOCCS' \npolicy of only permitting inmates into CASAT by court order.  In other words, plaintiff is \nalleging that the court order requirement that defendants now rely on to dismiss his claim is \nitself a discriminatory act under the ADA.  \nSome explanation may be necessary.  A judicial order is not required to enter SIP. But \nSIP is not available for the physically disabled.  CASAT exists as an alternative to SIP.  But \ndisabled people can only reach CASAT by judicial order.  These four truths are undisputed.  \nTogether, however, they mean that disabled inmates face a barrier to a rehabilitative \n                                            \n6 Curiously, the Second Circuit's opinion made no mention whatsoever of CASAT.  See generally Dimperio, 653 \nF. App'x at 54. \n19 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 20 of 22\nearly-release program that physically able inmates do not.  Disabled inmates—and only \ndisabled inmates—cannot volunteer for an existing rehabilitative program, even though able \ninmates may volunteer for their corresponding program.   \nDimperio is thus a poor fit because the Second Circuit's concern with ordering the \nstate to create a new program is not the solution to Goodall's concern, all that is required is \nthat disabled inmates be given the same opportunity to volunteer for their existing program.  \n653 F. App'x at 54.  Similarly, the Dimperio District Court's ruling that its plaintiff could not \nrecover because he was not qualified for CASAT is inapplicable here because plaintiff alleges \nthat exact qualification is itself discriminatory, which that plaintiff did not.  2015 WL 1383831, \nat *6-7.   \nAssuming Goodall is correct, which this Court must on a motion to dismiss, invalidating \nhis claim based on a discriminatory qualification would destroy the purpose of an ADA claim, \nbecause ADA defendants could simply create qualifications that apply only to disabled \npeople.  A discriminatory qualification broad enough to cover the entire swath of the disabled \nwould mean that no disabled person would be qualified for the program, and thus there could \nbe no qualified disabled person capable of bringing an ADA claim.  Thus, DOCCS' policy of \nrequiring disabled inmates to be ordered into CASAT cannot render plaintiff unqualified. \nAll told, were Goodall not disabled he would be qualified for SIP, and the additional \nqualification requiring a court order for CASAT applies to him only because of his disabilities.  \nMoreover, plaintiff has adequately alleged that he meets every criteria for entry into CASAT \nand SIP other than those that he specifically objects to as discriminatory.  Therefore, plaintiff \nhas adequately alleged that he is a qualified, eligible person with a disability. \nFinally, precisely because Goodall only faces impediments to participating in the two \nexisting early release programs because of his physical and mental disabilities, it cannot be \n20 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 21 of 22\ndoubted that he was denied access to those programs because he was disabled.  As a result, \nplaintiff has adequately pled every element of a Title II ADA claim.  Defendants' motion to \ndismiss his ADA claim against DOCCS must therefore be denied. \n  CONCLUSION \nUltimately, the question at stake in this case is whether depriving disabled inmates, \nincluding Goodall, of the ability to volunteer for CASAT in the same manner that physically \nable inmates can volunteer for SIP, violated plaintiff's rights under § 1983 and the ADA.  The \nquestion poses a bit of a thicket, because it involves not one program, or even two, but rather \nthe intersectionality of SIP and CASAT.  At this juncture, plaintiff has plausibly alleged that \nDOCCS and the individual defendants run those two programs together in a manner that \nviolates his rights to equal protection and under the ADA.  His complaint must therefore \nsurvive defendants' motion to dismiss. \nTherefore, it is \nORDERED THAT \n1.  Defendants' Dkt. 87 motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN \nPART; \n2.  Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against DOCCS and the individual defendants in their \nofficial capacities are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE; \n3.  Plaintiff's ADA claims against the individual defendants are DISMISSED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE; \n4.  Plaintiff's Count I § 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their individual \ncapacities and Count II ADA claim against DOCCS may proceed; and \n5.  Defendants are directed to answer plaintiff's amended complaint no later than \nTuesday, April 14, 2020. \n21 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 22 of 22\n \n \n \n             \nDated:  March 31, 2020 \n    Utica, New York.  \n \n22 \n ",

PREVIOUS LAWSUITS BY PLAINTIFF\n26.  Plaintiff has filed no other lawsuit in State or Federal\ncourt dealing with the same or similar facts involved in this\naction.\nV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n-6-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 7 of 27\n27.  Plaintiff commences this Civil Rights Action against\nthe Defendants mentioned in paragraphs (4) to (25), whereby\nPlaintiff's Federal and State Rights were repeatedly violated;\nnamely by aggravated acts of disability discrimination in relation\nto the Defendants' adherence to unlawful policy and custom in\ndenying qualified inmates with disabilities the benefits of\nprogram participation/ completion without reasonable\naccomodations, resulting in excessive confinement while simultan\neously permitting healthy inmates to benefit and be released early\nfrom, incarceration after successful completion.  This manner of\noperation demonstrates a deficient management of subordinates and\nsupervisor liability.\n28.  NYSDOCCS administers a SHOCK Incarceration Program\n(henceforth, SHOCK).  This program provides selected inmates a\nspecial six month program of SHOCK incarceration, stressing highly\nstructured routine of discipline, intensive regimentation,\nexercise, and work therapy, together with substance abuse\ntreatment;education, pre-release counseling, and life skills\ncounseling.The incentive for a successful completion of the six\nmonth long SHOCK program is an early release from incarceration to\nparole.\n29.  Even when an inmate satisfies all of the eligibility\ncriteria for SHOCK candidacy, they must still undergo selection\ninto the program and may be deemed unsuitable if there exists a\nserious medical or mental health problem.  However, court-ordered\nSHOCK inmates whom have a serious.medical or mental health prob\nlem are afforded an alternative placement so they may still bene\nfit as if they completed the SHOCK program.  This alternative\n-7-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 8 of 27\nprogram focuses more on education and drug abuse prevention than\nexercise and is named, C.A.S.A.T. (Comprehensive Alcohol & Sub\nstance Abuse Treatment), which is located at Hale Creek Correct\nional Facility.\n30.  NYSDOCCS Directive #2614, entitled \"Reasonable Accomr\nodations For.Inmates With Disibilities\", explains clearly in its\nPOLICY how a qualified inmate can still take advantage of a pro\ngrams with a serious medical or mental health problem by stating\nthe following;  \"Title II (Subtitle A) of the Americans With Dis\nibilities Act (ADA) prohibits State and local entities from dis\ncriminating against any qualified individual with a disibility in\ntheir programs. services, and activities.  Therefore, the pro\ngrams and services provided to inmates by this agency, or those\nthat may be contracted to other entities, must ensure accessib\nility and usability by qualified inmates in the most integrated\nsettings.  The Department is required to make \"reasonable accomm\nodations\" or modifications to existing policies and procedures to\nallow qualified inmates with disibilities the same opportunities,\nas non-disabled inmates, unless to do so would be an undue burden\n.to the Department, cause a fundamental alteration to a program.\nor compromise the safety of the facility\".  Therefore, there is a\ndirect contradiction between these two Directives and thus, the\ncurrent policy and procedure is unlawful.\n31.  According to Directive #2614 (2)(B), reasonable\naccommodations for inmates with disabilities may in\nclude, \"any change in the environment, policies. procedures, or\nthe manner in which tasks are completed enables a qualified\nindividual with a disabiiity to participate in a program or\nservice\".  Thus, only a change in policy is required so that\n-^olunfe  -8-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 9 of 27\nteer disabled inmates can participate and benefit from SHOCK'S\nalternative  program  in  the  same  manner  that  court-ordered  dis\nabled inmates currently do.\n32.  This change in policy to allow volunteer, non court-\nordered inmates to participate in SHOCK or its alternative pro\ngram does not pose any \"fundamental alteration\" in that this al\nternative program (C.A.S.A.T.) is already in procedural operation\nfor court-ordered inmates.at Hale Creek Correctional Facility.\nSimilarly, Directive #2614, entitled \"Reasonable Accomodations\nFor Inmates With Disibilities\" states at II (D) : Undue Burden;\n\"Reasonable Accomodations or modifications which would result in\na fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity\nor in undue financial and administrative hardship.  This is a\nlimited exception under the ADA and generally cannot be used for\ndenying an accomodation or a modification requested for program\naccessibility.\"\n33.  July 14^ 2015; Plaintiff is sentenced to an indeterm-\ninite prison term of (3) to (6) years for the crime of nbn-vio-\nlent 3rd Degree Robbery.  The sentencing judge \"recommends\" the\nSHOCK program but does not order or mandate it.\n34.  July 24j 2015: Plaintiff departs from county jail and\nenters State custody at Ulster Correctional Facility (Reception\nCenter).  The Medical Department determine Plaintiff is unsuit\nable for the SHOCK program ahd stamp the word \"SHOCK\" on his med\nical chart and scrawl an \"X\" through it.\n35.  July 27j 2015; The Medical staff at Ulster Correction\nal Facility note in Plaintiff's medical records, \"Not a SHOCK\ncandidate\", after screening and discovering numerous disibilit-\n-9-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 10 of 27\nies.  Inmates are given preliminary screenings at reception cen\nters to determine if they meet statutory eligibility criteria\nfor participation in the SHOCK Incarceration Program.  From this\nmoment onward, Plaintiff is advised by the Medical Department of\nNYSDOCCS that he will not be permitted entry into the SHOCK pro\ngram and benefit from the early release that a completion affords\nIt is further explained to Plaintiff that even if he was granted\nparticipation into the program, his health would be at risk of\nan injury. (\n36.  July 27j 2015: The Office of Mental Health staff at\nUlster Correctional Facility assign a \"Mental Health Services\"\nlevel of (3) to Plaintiff.  This classification level\nautomatic-ally excludes Plaintiff from the SHOCK program.\n37.  September 10, 2015; Plaintiff obtained a \"Medical Prob\nlem List\" printed from' the Health Services System of HYSDOCCS.\nHis \"current classifications\" of (1) for Medical and (3) for\nO.M.H* (Office of Mental Health) both exclude him from SHOCK.  A\nfew of Plaintiff's disabilities include, \"multiple cardiac risk\nfactors\", \"serious mental disorder\", \"epilepsy\", and \"heart dis\nease\". \n38.  October 23, 2015; Despite being informed repeatedly by\nthe Medical Department that he is, \"Hot a SHOCK candidate\".\nPlaintiff is \"offered\" the SHOCK program.  Aware that.participat\nion would likely result in an injury, and careful to heed the\nmedical advice previously spoken. Plaintiff signed a \"Voluntary\nDeclination\" form.  There was no alternative program offered to\nPlaintiff to accommodate his disabilities.\n-10-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 11 of 27\n39.  February 19,2017 ;Plaintif f submits a \"Request For Reasonable\nAccomodations\" to participate in the SHOCK program since he is a\nqualified individual with a disibility; an individual with a\ndisibility who, with or without reasonable mod-ifications to rules,\npolicies. or practices, meets the essential eligibility for\nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\nPlaintiff requested as an accomodation to the vigorous SHOCK\nprogram, the alternative placement that court-ordered inmates are\nafforded, due to his numerous serious medical problems.  The\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent of Programs, Laurie Fisher, denied\nPlaintiff's application by stating: \"Admission to SHOCK Alternative\nProgram is not a Reasonable Accomodation. SHOCK admission is based\non screening performed by Guidance Unit and eligibility\nrequirements.\" While it is true that reasonable acc-omodations are\nonly extended to court-ordered disabled inmates and inotdvoluhtee^rs,\nit is also a fact that an inmate with a dis-ibility may request a\nreasonable accomodation to any program at any\n-11-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 12 of 27\ntime during incarceration without having to be screened by Guid\nance Unit, according to NYSDOCCS Directive #2614, page (2) of\n(5), Section IV.  In fact, this is the very nature of the\nReason-able Accomodation Request process.\n40.  March 21j 2017;  Plaintiff submits an \"Inmate Grievance\nComplaint\" (GNE- 9243-17) citing: \"The decision to deny me\nadmission violates my right to be free from discrimination on the\nbasis of disibility and violates my rights under the Americans\nWith Disibilities Act\"\n41.  March 21^ 2017: Plaintiff forwards a correspondence to\nO.R.C. Welytok of the Guidance Unit, asking to be reconsidered for\nthe SHOCK program since the \"Voluntary Declination\" form that\nhe originally signed offers this opportunity.\n42.  April 10^ 2017: Plaintiff submitted a grievance to be\namended to the original (GNE-9243-17) because his O.R.C. Welytok\nrefused to respond to his request for reconsideration into the\nSHOCK program.  The \"Voluntary Declination\" form offers Plaintiff\nthis provision.\n43.  April 24j 2017: Plaintiff receives his grievance decis\nion from Superintendent Smith (GNE-9243-17), entitled \"Denied\nSHOCK\", which says in part: \"SHOCK is not a reasonable accomodatr\nion\".  This is only accurate because NYSDOCCS denies inmates with\ndisibilities from SHOCK program participation when they are not\ncourt-ordered.  NYSDOCCS.policy, as explained in the Pro Se\njournal is being challenged by DRNY.  Interestingly, the\nSuperintendent now alleges Plaintiff is \"ineligible\" for SHOCK\n-12-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 13 of 27\nprogram participation even though he meets all eligibility\ncrit-eria except for being disabled.\n44.  Plaintiff is and was a qualified individual with a\ndasibility and eligible for participation in the SHOCK program\notherwise, as defined by New York Correction Law § 865 and\nNYSDOCCS Directive #0086 entitled, \"SHOCK Incarceration\nFacilit-ies\".\n45.  May 23; 2017: Plaintiff receives an \"Interdepartmental\nCommunication\" from Assistant Deputy Superintendent of Programs,\nLaurie Fisher, stating: \"You are not eligible (for SHOCK) as\nfollows:  1)  You refused SHOCK in 2015  2)  You can only be\nplaced in the SHOCK alternative program if you are court-ordered\ninto SHOCK (and disabled).  You were not court-ordered\".  Plain\ntiff did, indeed, initially \"refuse\" to participate in SHOCK af\nter he was advised by the Medical Department that he was, \"Not a\nSHOCK candidate\" and that enrollment without a reasonable accom-\nodation would be injurious.  Furthermore, the \"Voluntary Declin\nation\" form that Plaintiff signed does allow him to be reconsid\nered after notifying his O.R.C., which he did.  Secondly, it is\nan accurate assessment that Plaintiff was not court-ordered to\nSHOCK and that the SHOCK alternative program is not designed for\nvolunteer disabled inmates.  Non disabled volunteers are sent to\nSHOCK and court-ordered disabled inmates are granted the altern\native program.  Hence, the unlawful policy in denying disabled\nvolunteers from benefiting from either program and the evident\ndiscrimination by its enforcers.  (se\n46.  May 30^ 2017: Plaintiff submitted a second grievance\n(GNE-9366-17); this one unrelated to the first and the one that\n-13-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 14 of 27\nwas amended to the first.  This new grievance ctjiallenges the\nSuperintendent's recent decision that Plaintiff was \"ineligible\",\nrequests the alleged reasons, and asks to be reconsidered for the\nSHOCK program or its alternative.\n47.  May 30j 2017; After seeking clarification from his\nO.R.C. M. Noriega, Plaintiff receives a confusing \"Interdepart\nmental Communication\" that leaves him with even more questions\nthan answers.  Her correspondence states: \"VFO (Violent Felony\nOverride) done when you qualify for Temporary Release/ CASAT.\nSHOCK - most of the time is court order.  Programs we have sent a\ncopy!\"  Plaintiff does not have a violent felony conviction and\nnobody has been capable  of deciphering what Ms. Noriega was\nre-ferring to with her comment.  j\n, i \n48.  June 5^ 2017: Plaintiff submitted an amended grievance  i\nto ba combined with the second on.file (GNE-9366-17).  This\ngrievance disputes the reasons why O.R.C. M. Noriega alleged\nPlaintiff was ineligible for SHOCK.\n49. UNDATED DOCUMENT: 83 N.Y. Jur. 2d Penal & Correctional  |\ninstitution § 17, 18 outlines what SHOCK Incarceration consists\nof and indicates eligibility requirements.  This material further\nproves that Plaintiff is and was an eligible inmate for the SHOCK\n(\nprogram, although disqualified for disibility only.\nI\n50.  July 24j 2017: Plaintiff signs a \"SHOCK Incarceration\nProgram Memo Of Agreement\" form for participation into the pro\ngram, although it was falsely alleged previously by numerous\nNYSDOCCS employees that he was ineligible for the program.\nNYSDOCCS Directive #2614, page (2) of (5), Section IV allows in\nmates to request a Reasonable Accomodation to any program or\n-14-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 15 of 27\nservice at any time during incarceration.  Therefore, Plaintiff\nattached a Reasonable Accomodation Request form with the SHOCK Memo\nOf Agreement.\n51.  July 24j 2017; Plaintiff attaches a Reasonable Accomod\nation Request form with the SHOCK Memo of Agreement.  In respond\ning, Dr. Smith states: \"Please note current medical regimen pre\ncludes SHOCK\".  Dr. Smith also documents \"myoclonus/ seizure dis\norder\" on the form.  The Assistant \"Deputy Superintendent of Pro\ngram, Laurie Fisher's comment at the bottom does not make any\nsense and Plaintiff explains why in the grievance that he files\nafterwards.\n: 5 2.  The impairment of myoclonus/ seizure disorder\nsubstant-ially limits one or more of Plaintiff's majot life\nactivities,including lifting and strenuous exercise; a record of\nsuch im-pai7:ment is well documented.  Plaintiff was/ is a\nqualified in-dividual who meets the essential requirements for\nparticipation\nin the SHOCK program, but has been prohibited entry,\n53.  July 24j 2017: The SHOCK Screening Committee fill out a\nSHOCK Incarceration Suitability Screening Form and carefully de-ny\nPlaintiff the program for reasons of \"UNSUITABLE-OTHER\".  This form\nis conveniently left blank in many areas that would've ass-isted in\nproving Plaintiff was medically/ mentally unsuitable\ndue to disibility.  Plaintiff would grieve this denial.\n54.  July 31j 2017: Superintendent Smith responds to griev\nance GNE-9366-17 by stating: \"...it was already explained to\nGrievant previously that Alternative SHOCK is only mandated for\ncourt ordered SHOCK inmates when they are medically unable to\n-15-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 16 of 27\nparticipate in the SHOCK program...\".  Thus, non court-ordered\ninmates whom are eligible but have a disibility cannot particip\nate.  And, non court-ordered healthy inmates can volunteer and\nattend SHOCK with no restrictions.  Disabled inmates, however,\ncannot benefit from the program without a court-order.  Plaintiff\nappealed this decision to the Central Office Review Committee\n(henceforth, C.O.R.C.) for final disposition and to fully exhaust\nhis administrative remedies.\n55.  August  2017: A Memorandum from O.R.C. A. Rouse is sent\nto Plaintiff explaining the three reasons for which it app-ears\nPlaintiff was denied the SHOCK program.  These reasons in-clude\nInstant Offense, Criminal History, and\" Psychiatric History.\nPlaintiff's non violent instant offense cannot preclude him and\nneither can his criminal history which does not contain a crime on\nthe list of exclusion.\n56.  August 9j 2017; A \"Program Eligibility Screening &\nMon-itoring Inmate Program Overview\" is printed and mentions\nPlain-tiff's reason for unsuitability as \"OTHER\".\n57.  August 14j 2017: Plaintiff files his third grievance\n(GNE-9484-17) because his O.R.C. refused to provide him with the\nreason(s) for which he was assumed to be ineligible for SHOCK.\n58.  August 23j 2017; Plaintiff submits grievance number\nfour (GNE-9507-17) which addresses another SHOCK/ Reasonable\nAccomodation denial (of July 24, 2017), thereby demonstrating\naggravated acts of discrimination.  Plaintiff wil-1 again agree\nto attend SHOCK when it is \"offered\" in the future, only to be\n-16-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 17 of 27\ntreated similarly.\n59.  August 28j 2017; Elena Landriscina of Disibility Rights\ncontacts a Commissioner of Corrections and two Superintendents\nof Greene C.F. to demand cooperation and compliance and informs\nPlaintiff of her investigation.\n60.  September 13^ 2017; In an inmate Grievance Resolution\nCommittee hearing, concerning Grievance GNE-9507-17, the Comm\nittee remarkable states; \"Committee agrees that DOCCS should have\na medical alternative to SHOCK even if this requires changes to\nState statute\".  In order to exhaust his administrative remedies\nand preserve his right to file a claim, Plaintiff appeals this\ndecision, to the Superintendent and eventually the C.O.R.C. in\nAlbany.\n61.  September 26, 2017: Superintendent Smith responds to\nGrievance GNE-9484-17 in reference to being denied the specific\nreasons for which Plaintiff was denied the SHOCK program.\n\"UN-SUITABLE-OTHER\" did not clarify the reason(s).  It is\naccurate that, \"...(Plaintiff) did not agree to participate in\nthe pro-gram as presented\", but father exercised his right to\nsubmit a Reasonable Accomodation Request form, pursuant to\nNYSDOCCS Di-rective #2614, Section IV.  \"As presented\" would've\ninvolved rigorous physical exertion that would've placed\nPlaintiff's heal-th/ safety at risk of injury.  Plaintiff sought\nthe alternative placement in the C.A.S.A.T. program that court-\nordered inmates with disabilities attend, or another arrangement.\n62.  September 29^ 2017: Plaintiff is \"offered\" the SHOCK\nprogram again and he signs another Memo Of Agreement but this\ntime he made it understood that he was not medically fit by\n-17-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 18 of 27\nattaching a Reasonable Accomodation Request Form and medical\nrecords.\n63.  September 29^ 2017; Plaintiff attaches a Reasonable\nAccomodation Request, Form to the SHOCK Incarceration Memo Of\nAgreement since he is a qualified individual with a disibility;\nan Individual who with or without reasonable accomodations to\nrules, policies,or practices, meets the essential eligibility re\nquirements for participation in a program or activity provided by\na public entity.  Dr. Smith inscribes on the form: \"Please note\ncurrent medical condition precludes strenuous program activities.\nDisibility well documented\".  As. a result of there being no stat\nute. that allows for a disabled volunteer to enter SHOCK, the Dep\nuty Superintendent of Programs, Marie Hammond responds: \"SHOCK :.\nrequires participants to engage in physical exercise and drills.\nInmate does not qualify for exemption from this requirement\".\n64.  October 13j 2017: The SHOCK Screening Committee fill out\nanother SHOCK Incarceration Suitability Screening Form for the\nsecond time and deny Plaintiff admission again; this time for\n\"UNSUITABLE-MEDICAL\".\n65.  October 20^ 2017: Superintendent Smith responds to\nGrievance. GNE-9507-17, pertaining to the July 24, 2017 SHOCK/\nReasonable Accomodation denials. However, due to the numerous and\nfrequent acts of disibility discrimination and subsequent\ngrievances, the Superintendent begins to combine the incidences\ninto one matter because they are of the same nature.  Yet,, each\ndenial is a separate and distinct act.\n-18-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 19 of 27\n• I  u-ii n  j  II  TTj nn i  i.j rr '\"nn\"^  fvi'ii  i'hi n  nn hn  11  >-0\"\niGQacd from iitCQrceration in Decembei.' of 2018 , and that Plaintiff\n15 solely GoncGrned with being financiQlly eompcnaQtod for the\n-three yGaro in exQcco—that ho oorved in priooni—ThoroforO} she—\nCiUbBS rldill Lirr' .L i  cujgi  (coo Ex\n66.  October 23, 2017; Elena Landriscina of DRNY provides\nPlaintiff with a copy of NYSDOCCS's Counsel's response to her re\nquest for answers about Plaintiff's SHOCK denials. Associate Coun*^\nsel states Plaintiff wasn't medically cleared.  He adds: \"Mr.\nGoodall's conditions do not constitute a disibility as defined in\nthe Americans With Disibilities Act\", but later admits Plaintiff's\nmedical condition would excuse him from '/'virtualjy the entire pro\ngram\" because of the activities involved.  Dr. Smith already doc\numented \"disibility well documented\" but this fact aside, the ADA\nAmendment Act of 2008 focuses more on whether or not an entity\nmeets obligations to disabled prisoners, rather than solely foc\nusing on whether the impairment is a disibility/  Counsel men\ntions that a fundamental alteration of the program would be need^\ned to accomodate Plaintiff but fails to relate that there is al\nready an alternative to SHOCK called C.A.S.A.T. and only a change\nin policy is needed for Plaintiff to engage in the program.  This\nwould also eliminate any potential financial burden on the ad\nministration.  Lastly, even if the Defendants could show that\n: - 19-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 20 of 27\nchanges would fundamentally alter the program, or cause a fin\nancial burden, the law mandates prisons to still \"take another\naction\" that would \"ensure that individuals with disibilities re\nceive the benefits or services provided\" by the prisons.  NYSDOCCS\nand by extension, its employees, failed to abide by the law.\nThese examples alone testify to the truth that only a change in\npolicy is required to reverse the trend of discrimination.\n67.  October 27. 2017: After waiting for the completed\nReasonable Accomodation Request form from the Deputy\nSuperintendent-of Programs and the decision from the SHOCK\nScreening Committee,Plaintiff files his final grievance\n(GNE-9608-17) about being de-nied SHOCK again.\n68.  December 20, 2017; Superintendent Smith responds to\nPlaintiff's final grievance (GNE-9608-17) and it is appealed to\nthe C.O.R.C. in Albany to fully exhaust administrative remedies.\n69.  December 23. 201.7; Plaintiff mailed a Notice Of Intent\nion To File A Claim on the Attorney General within (90) days of\nthe accrual of the last incident of discrimination in the event\nthis venue is chosen.\n70.  July  2017: The C.O.R.C. responds to the first of num\nerous grievances (GNE-9243-17) at the final stage of the appeal\nprocess.  Naturally, all of Plaintiff's allegations are refuted.\n71.  The C.O.R.C. is^currently in possession of the four un\nanswered grievances that are scheduled for a hearing, although\n-20-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 21 of 27\nthe maximum allotted timeframe of (30) days to render a\nfinal decision has grossly exceeded this timeframe.\nVI. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES\n72.  Plaintiff used the Inmate Grievance Program (henceforth,  '\n;  n  •  .  1\nI.e.P.) procedure available at Greene C.F. to attempt to resolve\nthe discrimination on (5) separate occasions as there were (5)  '\nindividual commissions against Plaintiff.  Plaintiff filed.his\nfirst grievance (GNEi-9243-17) on March 21, 2017, and presented\nthe facts related to the claim.  On April 10, 2017, Plaintiff am-  ]\nended this grievance and it was consolidated.  On April 24, 2017,\nPlaintiff was sent a response from the Superintendent, explaining  li\nhis grievance was denied.  On April 27, 2017, Plaintiff appealed  ^\n1\nthe denial to the C.O.R.C. in Albany for final disposition and to  ;\nexhaust administrative remedies.  On July 5, 2018, the C.O.R.C.  i\nunanimously denied Plaintiff's first of five grievances.  ^\n1\n73.  Plaintiff again used the I.G.P. procedure available at  |\nGreene C.F. to attempt to resolve the on-going discrimination by  |\nfiling his second of five grievances (GNE-9366-17) on May 30,  i\n2017, which presented the facts related to his claim.  On JuneS,  j\n2017, Plaintiff amended this grievances and it was consolidat-ed.  i\nOn July 31, 2017, Plaintiff was sent a response from the  i\nSuperintendent explaining his grievance was deftied.  On August\n1, 2017, Plaintiff appealed the denial to the C.O.R.C. for final\n-21-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 22 of 27\ndisposition and to exhaust his administrative remedies.  NYSDOCCS\nDirective #4040 reveals the policy which allows the C.O.R.C. (30)\ndays to render a final decision.  This grievance was received by\nthe C.O.R.G. on August 10, 2017, but a timely decision has been\ndelayed due to an alleged influx of grievances by inmates.\n74.  Plaintiff again used the I.G.P. procedure available at\nGreene C.F. to attempt to resolve the on-going discrimination by\nfiling his third of five grievances (GNE-9484-17) on August 14,\n2017, which presented the facts related to his claim.  On Sep\ntember 26, 2017, Plaintiff received a response from the Superin\ntendent, explaining his grievance was affirmed to an extent.

STATEMENT OF LEGAL CLAIMS\n77.  Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference, para\ngraphs (l) to(78).\n78.  All of the Defendants have committed, contributed to,\nand willfully demonstrated aggravated disibility discrimination\nagainst Plaintiff by denying him participation in a (early re\nlease from incarceration) program without reasonable accomodati-\nions, while he was a qualified individual with a disibility,\nthereby prohibiting Plaintiff from benefiting; and in doing so,\n-23-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 25 of 27\nrrc-i-'-ic-Kc-*  •*  *\nviolated his rights the Americans With Disabilities Act,\nTitle'II, and New York State Human Rights Law,\" resulting in loss of\nliberty interests/ freedom, pain and suffering,a nd emotional\ndistress.\n79.  The Defendants * actions interfered with and violated\nPlaintiff's statutorily protected Federal rights and State rights,\nresulting in conditions of confinement that were worse than what\nwas normal for other prisoners.  This punishment^ received by\nPlaintiff, was an atypical and significant hardship on Plaintiff\nin relation to the ordinary incidences of prison life, whereby\nPlaintiff was deprived of the basic human need of liberty and\njustice.\n80.  Any defense that supports the notion that prisons do\nnot have to make modifications to a service, program, or activity\nif doing so would \"fundamentally alter the nature of the service^\nprogram3 or activity';' This allows prisons to balance the rights of\ndisabled prisoners against the integrity of its service, pro-gram,\no^ activity.  Again, NYSDOCCS has shown with their pro-vision to\nallow disabled court-ordered SHOCK prisoners into its SHOCK\nalternative C.A.S.A.T. program that there is no fundamental\nalteration needed; just a change in policy to permit non court-\nordered volunteer-iprisoners whom are disabled and meet eligibil\nity requirements.\n81.  Any defense that supports the notion that prisons do not\nhave to make modifications to a service, program, or activity if\n-24-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 1   Filed 01/23/19   Page 26 of 27\ndoing so would \"cause undue financial or administrative burden\":\nThe Department of Justice has determined that the undue burden\ntest would be difficult for a prison to pass - that it would app\nly only in \"the most unusual cases\",  \"Congress intended the 'un\ndue burden' standard in Titl IT to be significantly higher th^n\nthe 'readily available' standard in Title III, and that ''the pro\ngram assessibility requirement of Title II should enable individ\nuals with disibilities to participate in and benefit from the\nservice, program, or activity of public entities in all but the\nmost unusual cases\".  But the most plain evidence that no finan\ncial burden would exist lays in the fact that several SHOCK al\nternative programs are already in procedural operation - females\nbenefit from the C.A.S.A.T. program at Bedford Hills as due court\"\nordered male prisoners.  A change in policy to allow volunteer\ndisabled prisoners is the only hinderance in preventing particip\nation.\nVIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n82.

Plaintiff has filed no other lawsuit in State or Federal court dealing with the same\nor similar facts involved in this action. \n29. Plaintiff commences this action against the Defendants mentioned in paragraphs\n(5)to (27) pursuant to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. § 12131\net seq.), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, whereby Plaintiff's Federal Rights were repeatedly violated by acts \nof disability discrimination pursuant to an unlawful policy and custom maintained by Defendants, \na policy and series of acts which simultaneously violated Plaintiff’s right to equal protection of the \nlaws pursuant to Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n30. The impairments of myoclonus/seizure disorder, multiple cardiac risk factors,\nserious mental disorder, epilepsy, and heart disease substantially limit one or more of Plaintiff's \nmajor life activities, including lifting and strenuous exercise. A record of such impairment is well \ndocumented. \n31. NYSDOCCS administers a Shock Incarceration Program (hereinafter “SIP”). This\nprogram places eligible inmates in a six-month highly structured routine of discipline, intensive \nregimentation, exercise, and work therapy, together with substance abuse treatment, education, \npre-release counseling, and life skills counseling. Inmates who successfully complete the SIP are \ngranted an early release from incarceration and/or parole.  \n32. During all relevant time periods, NYSDOCCS Directive # 0086, entitled “Shock\nIncarceration Facilities,” annexed hereto as Exhibit 1, set forth the criteria for eligibility for the \nSIP in Section IV. Plaintiff met and continues to meet all of the eligibility requirements set forth \n-6-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 7 of 20\nin Section IV of this Directive. In particular, Plaintiff notes that his instant offense of third-degree \nrobbery per Section 160.05 of the New York Penal Law does not preclude him from eligibility for \nSIP because it is not a “violent felony offense” as defined in Section 70 of the New York Penal \nLaw and is not one of the other enumerated disqualifying offenses listed in Section IV of Directive \n# 0086. Furthermore, Plaintiff does not have any prior convictions in his record that would \ndisqualify him for SIP eligibility per Section IV of Directive # 0086. \n33. There are two ways in which eligible inmates may be placed in the SIP. Some\ninmates voluntarily apply for the SIP, are accepted, and then are placed in the SIP. Other inmates \nare placed in the SIP pursuant to a court order. Inmates are given preliminary screenings at \nreception centers to determine if they meet statutory eligibility criteria for participation in the \nSHOCK Incarceration Program. Even when an inmate satisfies all of the eligibility criteria for the \nSIP candidacy, he or she may be deemed unsuitable if there exists a serious medical or mental \nhealth problem that makes them unsuitable to participate in the SIP. Court-ordered SIP inmates \nwho have such serious medical or mental health problems are placed in an alternative program, \nthe Comprehensive Alcohol & Substance Abuse Treatment (“CASAT”), which focuses more on \neducation  and  drug  abuse  prevention  than  physical  exercise  and  is  located  at  Hale  Creek \nCorrectional  Facility.  Inmates  who  complete  the  CASAT  are  granted  early  release  from \nincarceration and/or parole just as if they completed the SIP. However, inmates with serious \nmedical or mental health problems who were not ordered by a court to participate in SIP and who \nare otherwise eligible for the SIP and apply for placement in the SIP are not placed in the CASAT \nbut are simply denied any type of early release or parole program and must serve out the remainder \nof their terms, notwithstanding their eligibility for the SIP or CASAT. \n-7-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 8 of 20\n34. During  all  relevant  time  periods,  NYSDOCCS  Directive  #2614,  entitled\n“Reasonable Accommodations For Inmates With Disabilities,” annexed hereto as Exhibit 2, stated \nthe following: \nTitle II (Subtitle A) of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits \nState and local entities from discriminating against any qualified individual \nwith a disability in their programs, services, and activities. Therefore, the \nprograms and services provided to inmates by this agency, or those that \nmay be contracted to other entities, must ensure accessibility and usability \nby qualified inmates in the most integrated settings. The Department is \nrequired to make “reasonable accommodations” or modifications to existing \npolicies and procedures to allow qualified inmates with disabilities the same \nopportunities, as non-disabled inmates, unless to do so would be an undue \nburden to the Department, cause a fundamental alteration to a program or \ncompromise the safety of the facility. \n35. According to Section II.B of Directive #2614, reasonable accommodations for\ninmates with disabilities may include, “any change in the environment, policies, procedures, or the \nmanner in which tasks are completed enables a qualified individual with a disability to participate \nin a program or service.” Thus, only a change in policy is required so that disabled inmates who \nvoluntarily apply for and are otherwise eligible for SIP can participate and benefit from CASAT \nin the same manner that disabled inmates who are placed in SIP by court order currently do. \nNevertheless, while it is true that reasonable accommodations are only extended to court-ordered \ndisabled inmates and not volunteers, it is also a fact that an inmate with a disability may request a \nreasonable accommodation to any program at any time during incarceration without having to be \nscreened by Guidance Unit, according to NYSDOCCS Directive #2614, page (2) of (5), Section \nIV. \n36. A change in NYSDOCCS policy to allow disabled inmates who voluntarily apply\nfor and are otherwise eligible for SIP to participate in CASAT the way disabled inmates who are \nplaced in SIP by court order do does not pose any “fundamental alteration” because CASAT is \n-8-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 9 of 20\nalready in procedural operation for court-ordered inmates. Moreover, Directive #2614, entitled \n“Reasonable Accommodations For Inmates With Disabilities” states at Section II.D: Undue \nBurden; “Reasonable Accommodations or modifications which would result in a fundamental \nalteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative hardship. \nThis  is  a  limited  exception  under  the  ADA  and  generally  cannot  be  used  for  denying  an \naccommodation or a modification requested for program accessibility.” \n37. On July 14, 2015, Plaintiff was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of three\nto six years for the crime of 3rd Degree Robbery pursuant to Section 160.05 of the New York \nPenal Law. See Exhibit 3, annexed hereto. The sentencing judge recommended that Plaintiff \nparticipate in the SIP but did not order that he be placed in it.  \n38. On July 24, 2015, Plaintiff departed from county jail and entered State custody at\nUlster Correctional Facility (Reception Center). The Medical Department determined that Plaintiff \nwas unsuitable for the SIP, stamped the word “SHOCK” on his medical chart, and scrawled an \n“X” through it. See Exhibit 4, annexed hereto. \n39. On  July  27,  2015,  the  medical  staff  at  Ulster  Correctional  Facility  noted  in\nPlaintiff’s medical records, “Not a SHOCK candidate,” after screening and discovering numerous \ndisabilities. See Exhibit 5, annexed hereto. Plaintiff was then advised by the Medical Department \nthat he would not be permitted entry into the SIP because if he participated in the program, his \nhealth would be at risk of an injury.  \n40. On July 27, 2015, the Office of Mental Health staff at Ulster Correctional Facility\nassigned  a  “Mental  Health  Services”  level  of  “3”  to  Plaintiff.  This  classification  level \nautomatically excluded Plaintiff from the SIP. See Exhibit 6, annexed hereto. \n-9-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 10 of 20\n41. On September 10, 2015, Plaintiff obtained a “Medical Problem List” printed from\nthe Health Services System of NYSDOCCS, which is annexed hereto as Exhibit 7. His “current \nclassifications” of “1” for “Medical” and “3” for “O.M.H.” both exclude him from participation in \nthe SIP. A few of Plaintiff’s disabilities include, “multiple cardiac risk factors,” “serious mental \ndisorder,” “epilepsy,” and “heart disease.” \n42. On October 23, 2015, despite having been informed repeatedly by the Medical\nDepartment that he was, “Not a SHOCK candidate,” Plaintiff was offered an opportunity to \nparticipate in the SIP. Aware that participation would likely result in an injury, and careful to heed \nthe medical advice he had received, Plaintiff signed a “Voluntary Declination” form, which is \nannexed hereto as Exhibit 8. No alternative program such as CASAT was offered to Plaintiff to \naccommodate his disabilities. The Voluntary Declination form that Plaintiff signed specified that \nPlaintiff would not be reconsidered for the SIP unless he notified his O.R.C. directly. \n43. On  February  19,  2017,  Plaintiff  submitted  a  “Request  For  Reasonable\nAccommodations” to participate in an alternative program the SIP such as CASAT because of his \ndisabilities.  See  Exhibit  9,  annexed  hereto.  However,  Assistant  Deputy  Superintendent  of \nPrograms Laurie Fisher denied Plaintiff's application, stating: “Admission to SHOCK Alternative \nProgram is not a Reasonable Accommodation. SHOCK admission is based on screening performed \nby Guidance Unit and eligibility requirements.”  \n44. On March 20, 2017, Plaintiff submitted Inmate Grievance Complaint No. GNE-\n9243-17, in which he wrote that “[t]he decision to deny me admission [to the SIP or to an \nalternative equivalent such as CASAT] violates my right to be free from discrimination on the \nbasis of disability and violates my rights under the Americans With Disabilities Act.” See Exhibit \n10, annexed hereto. \n-10-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 11 of 20\n45. On March 21, 2017, Plaintiff forwarded a correspondence to O.R.C. Welytok of the\nGuidance Unit asking to be reconsidered for the SIP, as instructed in the “Voluntary Declination” \nform he had signed. See Exhibit 11, annexed hereto. \n46. On  April  10,  2017,  Plaintiff  submitted  an  amendment  to  Inmate  Grievance\nComplaint GNE-9243-17 after O.R.C. Welytok refused to respond to his request for to be \nreconsidered for the SIP. See Exhibit 12, annexed hereto. \n47. On  April  24,  2017,  Plaintiff  received  a  decision  regarding  Inmate  Grievance\nComplaint GNE-9243-17, which is annexed hereto as Exhibit 13. The decision denied the \ngrievance, noting that “SHOCK is not a reasonable accommodation.” The decision made no \nmention of CASAT or any other equivalent alternative to SIP that would accommodate inmates \nwhose disabilities precluded participation in the SIP itself. \n48. On May 23, 2017, Plaintiff received an “Interdepartmental Communication” from\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent of Programs Laurie Fisher stating: “You are not eligible (for \nSHOCK) as follows: 1) You refused SHOCK in 2015 2) You can only be placed in the SHOCK \nalternative program if you are court-ordered into SHOCK (and disabled). You were not court-\nordered.” See Exhibit 14, annexed hereto. Plaintiff did, indeed, initially “refuse” to participate in \nthe SIP after he was advised by the Medical Department that he was “Not a SHOCK candidate” \nand that enrollment without a reasonable accommodation would be injurious. However, the \n“Voluntary Declination” form that Plaintiff signed allowed him to be reconsidered for SIP \nparticipation after notifying his O.R.C., which he did.  \n49. On May 25, 2017, Plaintiff submitted Inmate Grievance Complaint GNE-9366-17.\nSee Exhibit 15, annexed hereto. This new grievance challenged the Superintendent’s recent \n-11-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 12 of 20\ndecision in the May 23, 2017 Interdepartmental Communication that Plaintiff was ineligible for \nparticipation in the SIP or CASAT and asked for reconsideration of that determination. \n50. On May 30, 2017, after seeking clarification from O.R.C. M. Noriega, Plaintiff\nreceived  another  Interdepartmental  Communication  that  stated,  confusingly:  “VFO  [Violent \nFelony Override] done when you qualify for Temporary Release/CASAT SHOCK - most of the \ntime is court order. Programs we have sent a copy!” See Exhibit 16, annexed hereto. To the extent \nthat this statement can be construed to mean that Plaintiff was denied participation in the SIP or \nCASAT because of an exclusion from these programs of inmates convicted of violent felonies, \nPlaintiff notes that he was never convicted of a violent felony and reiterates that the sentencing \njudge recommended (though did not order) that Plaintiff participate in the SIP. \n51. On June 5, 2017, Plaintiff submitted an amendment to Inmate Grievance Complaint\nGNE-9366-17 in which he disputed the reasons why O.R.C. M. Noriega alleged Plaintiff was \nineligible for the SIP. See Exhibit 17, annexed hereto. \n52. On July 24, 2017, Plaintiff and an O.R.C. signed a “SHOCK Incarceration Program\nMemo Of Agreement” wherein Plaintiff agreed to participate in the SIP and agreed to abide by the \nrules of the program. See Exhibit 18, annexed hereto. Plaintiff wrote on top of the form that he \nagreed  to  participate  only  with  a  reasonable  accommodation  and  attached  a  Reasonable \nAccommodation Request to the form. See Exhibit 19, annexed hereto.  \n53. In responding to the Reasonable Accommodation Request, a Dr. Smith stated\n“Please note current medical regimen precludes SHOCK” and referenced “myoclonus/seizure \ndisorder” on the form. The Assistant Deputy Superintendent of Program Laurie Fisher commented \nat the bottom that “Shock eligibility cannot be determined or granted through a reasonable \naccommodation.” \n-12-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 13 of 20\n54. On  July  24,  2017,  the  SHOCK  Screening  Committee  filled  out  a  SHOCK\nIncarceration Suitability Screening Form and denied Plaintiff eligibility for the program due to \n“reason Code” “99,” which, upon information and belief, is the code  for “UNSUITABLE-\nOTHER.” See Exhibit 20, annexed hereto. \n55. On July 31, 2017, Superintendent Smith responded to Inmate Grievance Complaint\nGNE-9366-17 by stating “it was already explained to Grievant previously that Alternative SHOCK \nis only mandated for court ordered SHOCK inmates when they are medically unable to participate \nin the SHOCK program.” See Exhibit 21, annexed hereto. Plaintiff appealed this decision to the \nCentral Office Review Committee (hereinafter “C.O.R.C.”) for final disposition and to fully \nexhaust his administrative remedies. \n56. On August 7, 2017, A Memorandum from O.R.C. A. Rouse was sent to Plaintiff\nexplaining three reasons for denying Plaintiff participation in the SIP. These reasons include \nInstant Offense, Criminal History, and Psychiatric History. See Exhibit 22, annexed hereto.   \n57. On  August  9,  2017,  a  “Program  Eligibility  Screening  &  Monitoring  Inmate\nProgram Overview” was printed and mentions Plaintiff's reason for unsuitability as “OTHER.” \nSee Exhibit 23, annexed hereto.   \n58. On August 14, 2017, Plaintiff submitted Inmate Grievance Complaint GNE-9484-\n17 because his O.R.C. refused to provide him with the reason(s) for which he was assumed to be \nineligible for the SIP.  \n59. On August 23, 2017, Plaintiff submitted Inmate Grievance Complaint GNE-9507-\n17, which addressed the reasonable accommodation denial of July 24, 2017. See Exhibit 24, \nannexed hereto.  Plaintiff would again agree to attend the SIP when it was “offered” in the future, \nonly to be treated similarly. \n-13-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 14 of 20\n60. On August 28, 2017, Elena Landriscina of Disability Rights New York (“DRNY”),\nacting on Plaintiff’s behalf, contacted a Commissioner of Corrections and two Superintendents of \nGreene C.F. to demand cooperation and compliance and informed Plaintiff of her investigation. \nSee Exhibit 25, annexed hereto. \n61. On September 13, 2017,  in an inmate Grievance Resolution Committee hearing\nconcerning Inmate Grievance Complaint GNE-9507-17, the Committee stated: “Committee agrees \nthat DOCCS should have a medical alternative to SHOCK even if this requires changes to State \nstatute.” See Exhibit 26, annexed hereto. In order to exhaust his administrative remedies and \npreserve his right to file a claim, Plaintiff appealed this decision to the Superintendent and \neventually the C.O.R.C. in Albany. \n62. On September 26, 2017, Superintendent Smith responded to Inmate Grievance\nComplaint  GNE-9484-17.  See  Exhibit  27  The  reason  for  denial  set  forth  therein,    “UN-\nSUITABLE-OTHER” did not clarify the reasons for Plaintiff’s denial. It is accurate that Plaintiff \ndid not agree to participate in the program “as presented” at first, but Plaintiff subsequently \nexercised  his  right  to  submit  a  Reasonable  Accommodation  Request  form  pursuant  to \nNYSDOCCS Directive #2614, Section IV. “As presented” would have involved rigorous physical \nexertion that would have placed Plaintiff's health and safety at risk. Plaintiff sought the alternative \nplacement in the CASAT program that court-ordered inmates with disabilities attend, or another \narrangement. \n63. On September 29, 2017, Plaintiff was “offered” participation in the SIP again, and\nhe signed another “Memo Of Agreement,” annexed hereto as Exhibit 28, but this time he made it \nunderstood that he was not medically fit by attaching a Reasonable Accommodation Request Form \nand medical records. See Exhibit 29, annexed hereto. \n-14-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 15 of 20\n64. Dr. Smith inscribed on the Reasonable Accommodation Request Form: “Please\nnote  current  medical  condition  precludes  strenuous  program  activities.  Disability  well \ndocumented.” Deputy Superintendent of Programs Marie Hammond wrote on the form: “SHOCK \nrequires  participants  to  engage  in  physical  exercise  and  drills.  Inmate  does  not  qualify  for \nexemption from this requirement.” \n65. On October 13, 2017, the SHOCK Screening Committee completed a second\nSHOCK Incarceration Suitability Screening Form and denied Plaintiff admission again, this time \nfor “Reason Code” “08,” which, upon information and belief, is code for “UNSUITABLE-\nMEDICAL.” See Exhibit 30, annexed hereto. \n66. On  October  20,  2017,  Superintendent  Smith  responded  to  Inmate  Grievance\nComplaint GNE-9507-17 pertaining to the reasonable accommodation denial of July 24, 2017. \nExhibit 31, annexed hereto. However, due to the number of Plaintiff’s grievances by this time, the \nSuperintendent began to combine the incidences into one matter because they are of the same \nnature. Yet, each denial is a separate and distinct act. \n67. On October 23, 2017, Elena Landriscina of DRNY provided Plaintiff with a copy\nof NYSDOCCS’s Associate Counsel’s response to her request for answers about Plaintiff’s SIP \ndenials. See Exhibit 32, annexed hereto. The Associate Counsel stated Plaintiff was not medically \ncleared for the SIP and added: “Mr. Goodall’s conditions do not constitute a disability as defined \nin the Americans With Disabilities Act,” but later admitted that Plaintiff's medical condition would \nexcuse him from “virtually the entire program” because of the activities involved in the SIP. The \nAssociate Counsel mentioned that a fundamental alteration of the program would be needed to \naccommodate Plaintiff but failed to mention that there is already an alternative to the SIP, CASAT, \nand that only a change in policy would be needed for Plaintiff to participate in CASAT.  \n-15-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 16 of 20\n68. After waiting for the completed Reasonable Accommodation Request form from\nthe  Deputy  Superintendent  of  Programs  and  for  the  decision  from  the  SHOCK  Screening \nCommittee, Plaintiff submitted his final grievance, Inmate Grievance Complaint GNE-9608-17 \ncomplaining about being denied SHOCK again. See Exhibit 33, annexed hereto. \n69. On December 20, 2017, Superintendent Smith responded to Inmate Grievance\nComplaint GNE-9608-17 unfavorably to Plaintiff, and Plaintiff appealed that determination to the \nC.O.R.C. in Albany to fully exhaust administrative remedies.\n70. On December 23, 2017, Plaintiff served a Notice Of Intention To File A Claim on\nthe Attorney General setting forth in sum and substance the allegations made herein. See Exhibit \n34, annexed hereto.   \nEXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n71. Plaintiff  used  the  Inmate  Grievance  Program  (hereinafter  “I.G.P.”)  procedure\navailable at Greene C.F. to attempt to resolve the discrimination on five separate occasions as there \nwere five individual commissions against Plaintiff.  \n72. Plaintiff filed his first grievance (GNE-9243-17) on March 21, 2017, and presented\nthe facts related to the claim. On April 10, 2017, Plaintiff amended this grievance and it was \nconsolidated. On April 24, 2017. Plaintiff was sent a response from the Superintendent, explaining \nhis grievance was denied. On April 27, 2017, Plaintiff appealed the denial to the C.O.R.C. in \nAlbany for final disposition and to exhaust administrative remedies. On July 5, 2018, the C.O.R.C. \nunanimously denied Plaintiff's first of five grievances. Exhibit 35, annexed hereto. \n73. Plaintiff again used the I.G.P. procedure available at Greene C.F. to attempt to\nresolve the ongoing discrimination by filing his second of five grievances (GNE-9366-17) on May \n30, 2017, and presented the facts related to the claim. On June 5, 2017, Plaintiff amended this \n-16-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 17 of 20\ngrievances and it was consolidated. On July 31, 2017, Plaintiff was sent a response from the \nSuperintendent explaining that his grievance was denied. On August 1, 2017, Plaintiff appealed \nthe denial to the C.O.R.C. for final disposition and to exhaust his administrative remedies. On \nDecember  19,  2018,  the  C.O.R.C.  unanimously  accepted  in  part  Plaintiff's  second  of  five \ngrievances “only to the extent that CORC upholds the determination of the Superintendent[.]” \nExhibit 36, annexed hereto. \n74. Plaintiff again used the I.G.P. procedure available at Greene C.F. to attempt to\nresolve the ongoing discrimination by filing his third of five grievances (GNE-9484-17) on August \n14, 2017, and presented the facts related to the claim. On September 26, 2017, Plaintiff received a \nresponse  from  the  Superintendent,  explaining  that  his  grievance  was  affirmed  in  part.  On \nSeptember 28, 2017, Plaintiff appealed this decision to the C.O.R.C. for a final disposition and to \nexhaust  administrative  remedies.  On  February  6,  2019,  the  C.O.R.C.  unanimously  denied \nPlaintiff's third of five grievances. Exhibit 37, annexed hereto. \n75. Plaintiff again used the I.G.P. procedure available at Greene G.F. to attempt to\nresolve the ongoing discrimination by filing his fourth of five grievances (GNE-9507-17) on \nAugust 23, 2017, and presented the facts related to his claim. On September 13, 2017, Plaintiff \nreceived a hearing on his grievance, which was partly accepted. On September 14, 2017, Plaintiff \nappealed this decision to the Superintendent. On October 20, 2017, Plaintiff was sent a response \nfrom the Superintendent, explaining that his grievance was denied. On October 24, 2017, Plaintiff \nappealed the denial to the C.O.R.C. in Albany for a final disposition and to exhaust administrative \nremedies. On February  6, 2019, the C.O.R.C. unanimously denied Plaintiff's fourth of five \ngrievances. Exhibit 38, annexed hereto. \n-17-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 18 of 20\n76. Plaintiff again used the I.G.P. procedure available at Greene C.F. to attempt to\nresolve the ongoing discrimination by submitting his fifth of five grievances (GNE-9608-17) on \nOctober 27, 2017, and presented the facts related to his claim. On December 20, 2017, Plaintiff \nwas sent a response from the Superintendent, explaining that his grievance was affirmed to an \nextent. On December 23, 2017, Plaintiff appealed this decision to the C.O.R.C. in Albany for final \ndisposition and to exhaust his administrative remedies. This grievance was received by the \nC.O.R.C. on February 2, 2018, but a timely decision has been delayed due to an alleged influx of\ngrievances by inmates. See Exhibit 39, annexed hereto. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nI. TITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990\n(DENIAL OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION)\n77. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference, paragraphs 1 to 76.\n78. Plaintiff is and was a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of\nTitle  II  of  the  ADA  and  the  New  York  Human  Rights  Law  and  is  otherwise  eligible  for \nparticipation in the SIP, as defined by New York Correction Law § 865 and NYSDOCCS Directive \n#0086 entitled, “SHOCK Incarceration Facilities.” \n79. The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision is a\npublic agency of the State of New York, and Greene Correctional Facility is a public entity within \nthe meaning of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \n80. Plaintiff was at all relevant times totally and completely eligible for participation\nin the SIP but for his disabling medical conditions, which, as alleged above, limit one or more of \nhis major life activities. \n81. Plaintiff, as alleged above, was discriminated against by being excluded from or\ndenied the benefits of Greene Correctional Facility’s services, namely participation in SIP with a \n-18-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 19 of 20\nreasonable accommodation or participation in the equivalent of SIP in a modified setting, such as \nthe CASAT program. \n82. The CASAT program was at all relevant times a ready-made alternative to the SIP\nwhich amounted to a reasonable accommodation within the meaning of Title II of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. Notwithstanding Defendants’ allegations to the contrary in their responses \nto and rulings on Plaintiff’s Inmate Grievances, the only reason why Defendants denied Plaintiff \nparticipation in the CASAT program is because the sentencing court  did not order him to \nparticipate in the SIP, and he volunteered for SIP participation instead, and Defendants’ policies \nprovide that only inmates whom a court ordered to participate in the SIP but whose disabilities \npreclude such participation may participate in the CASAT program instead. This policy has no \nrational basis and therefore in practice amounts to discrimination by Defendants against Plaintiff \nbecause of Plaintiff’s disability, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nII. 42 U.S.C. § (U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, § 1)\n83. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference, paragraphs 1 to 82.\n84. The aforementioned policy of and conduct by Defendants that violated Title II of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, as alleged above, simultaneously denied Plaintiff, who at all \nrelevant times was a person within the jurisdiction of the State of New York, the equal protection \nof  the  laws,  in  violation  of  Section  1  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. There is no legitimate government interest to which such policy and conduct is \nrationally related. \n85. Defendants’  repeated  denials  of  Plaintiff’s  multiple  requests  for  a  reasonable\naccommodation in the form of admission to the CASAT program, and their obfuscations in \n-19-\n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 9   Filed 04/17/19   Page 20 of 20\njustifying such denials, as alleged above, cumulatively evidence malice toward Plaintiff or at best \na reckless indifference to Plaintiffs rights. \nJURY TRIAL DEMANDED \n86. A jury trial is demanded on all issues triable by jury.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Court enter judgment granting Plaintiff: \n1. A declaration that the acts and omissions described herein violated Plaintiffs rights\nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution; \n2. Compensatory damages in the amount of $3,000,000.00  against each Defendant\njointly and severally; \n3. Punitive  damages  in  the  amount  of  $2,000,000.00  against  each  individual\nDefendant, in his or her individual capacity, jointly and severally; \n4.  Plaintiffs costs in this suit; \n5.  Attorneys' fees to the extent applicable; and \n6.  Any additional relief as this Court deems just, proper, and equitable. \nDated:  April 17, 2019 \nBrooklyn, New York \nRespectfully submitted, \nGEOFFREY SCHOTTER, ESQ. \nAttorney for Plaintiff \n65 Lenox Road #lE \nBrooklyn, New York 11226 \n(347) 413-9014\ngeoffrey.schotter@gmail.com\n-20-",

Defendants submit this memorandum of law in support of \ntheir motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56. \nARGUMENT \nTitle II of the ADA “proscribes discrimination against the disabled in access to public \nservices.”  Harper v. Cuomo, 2021 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 39173, *40 (N.D.N.Y. March 1, 2021) \n(quoting Harris v. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2009)).  The statute provides that “no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or \nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity or be subjected to \ndiscrimination by any such entity.  Id.  (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12132).  Similarly, § 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act requires that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability. . . shall, \nsolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance. . . .” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  The second circuit has noted that “the standards \nunder both statutes are generally the same[.]” Harper, supra, (quoting Wright v. New York State \nDep’t of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016)).  Where, as here, the subtle distinctions between \nthe two statutes ae not implicated, courts “treat claims under the two statutes identically.”  Id. \n(quoting Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003)). \n  Pursuant to Title II of the ADA, a disability is defined as (i) a physical or mental \nimpairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual, (ii) \n1 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 8 of 35\n \na record of such an impairment, (iii) being regarded as having such an impairment.  28 C.F.R. § \n35.108(a)(1)(i-iii).  The second circuit has held that district courts should apply the three-step \napproach taken by the United States Supreme Court in Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624 (1998) to \ndetermine whether a plaintiff is disabled.  Shine v. N.Y. City Hous. Auth., 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n171403 *10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 18, 2020) (citing Hernandez v. Int’l Shoppes, Inc., 100 F.Supp. 3d \n232, 257 (E.D.N.Y. 2015).  Under that approach the plaintiff must first show that he suffers from \na physical or mental impairment.  Second, he must identify the activity claimed to be impaired and \nestablish that it constitutes a major life activity.  Third, the plaintiff must show that her impairment \nsubstantially limits the major life activity previously identified.  Id. (quoting Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. \nof N.Y., 287 F.3d 138, *147) (2nd Cir. Ct. of Appeals, March 29, 2002) “A plaintiff must \nspecifically allege which major life activities are substantially limited by the claimed disability to \nestablish a prima facie case.”  Id.; see also, Amador v. Macy’s E.-Herald Square, 2014 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 145852 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 3, 2014) (granting motion to dismiss because “in none of plaintiff’s \nsubmissions . . . does she list or otherwise specifically identify which major life activities she is \nclaiming were impacted by her injuries”).  Not every impairment will constitute a disability.  28 \nC.F.R. § 35.108(d)(Pet1) \n  For an impairment to substantially limit a major life activity, it must “prevent or severely \nrestrict the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people’s daily \nlives.”  Morea v. Fanning, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123467, *18 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2017) (citing \nToyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002)).  “District courts in the \nSecond Circuit have repeatedly held that a plaintiff’s personal testimony which describes the \nalleged limits that affect a major life activity, without supporting medical testimony, simply is not \nsufficient to establish a prima facie case under the ADA.”  Id. (citing Sussle v. Sirina Prot. Sys. \n2 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 9 of 35\n \nCorp., 269 F.Supp.2d 285 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)).  A plaintiff’s self-serving, conclusory claims as to \nlimitations on major life activities or bodily functions, “without more, are not proof of a substantial \nlimitation on a person’s major life activities.”  Id.; see also Nadel v. Shinseki, 57 F.Supp.3d 288, \n296 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citation omitted).  The Second Circuit has held that where the traits upon \nwhich the alleged discriminatory treatment is based are “commonplace, they do not rise to the level \nof an impairment.”  Joyce v. Suffolk County, 911 F.Supp. 92, 96 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (quoting Daley \nv. Koch, 892 F.2d 212, 215 (U.S. Ct. of Appeals 1989)). \nPOINT I \nPLAINTIFF IS NOT A QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL WITH A DISABILITY \n  Paragraph  30  of  Plaintiff’s  2nd  Amended  Complaint  states,  “The  impairments  of \nmyoclonus/seizure disorder, multiple cardiac risk factors, serious mental disorder, epilepsy, and \nheart disease substantially limit one or more of Plaintiff’s major life activities, including lifting \nand strenuous exercise.”  Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 30.  Paragraphs 81 and 90 of Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended \nComplaint state, “Plaintiff was at all relevant times totally and completely eligible for participation \nin the SIP but for his disabling medical conditions, which, as alleged above, limit one or more of \nhis major life activities.”  Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 81, 90.  Plaintiff’s pleading is otherwise silent as to how \nand/or in what manner he suffers from a physical or mental impairment; the activity claimed to be \nimpaired and how it is impaired; and how any alleged impairments substantially limit any alleged \nmajor life activity identified.  Dkt. No. 107. \n  Defendants served Interrogatories on Plaintiff on or about May 2020.  Interrogatory \nnumbered twelve stated:  Describe in detail each and every alleged disability claimed by the \nPlaintiff at any time, including but not limited to any alleged disability or disabilities suffered by \nthe Plaintiff during all times relevant to his action against the Defendants.  For each such disability \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 10 of 35\n \ndescribe in detail the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment or impairments giving rise \nto that disability; as well as the activity or activities that the Plaintiff alleges are limited by that \ndisability, and the extent to which the Plaintiff is limited in that activity or activities.  Exhibit 1.  \nOn or about August 2020, Plaintiff responded by stating, “Plaintiff sets forth the following \nconditions: \na.  Epilepsy/Myoclonic Seizure Disorder effecting the neurological \nsystem, causing involuntary muscle contractions. \nb.  Heart disease and hypertension effecting the cardiovascular system. \nc.  Radiculopathy, back pain effecting the musculoskeletal system. \nd.  Adjustment disorders, with mixed anxiety and depressed mood \neffecting the brain function. \ne.  Depressive disorder, effecting the brain function. \nf.  Antisocial personality disorder, effecting the brain function. \ng.  Hiatal hernia and GERD effecting the digestive system. \nh.  Flat feet effecting the musculoskeletal system. \n    \n  Plaintiff has not supplemented his responses to these Interrogatories and discovery in this \nmatter is closed.  Plaintiff has not retained a medical expert in this matter and his time to do so has \nexpired. \n  Defendants submit a declaration from Dr. Smith, Greene C.F. Facility Health Services \nDirector, and the Plaintiff’s primary medical care provider for his entire period of incarceration at \nGreene C.F. in support of their summary judgment motion.  Dr. Smith states that the Plaintiff never \nrequired more than routine medical care during his incarceration at Greene C.F. and further states \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 11 of 35\n \nthat, based upon her review of the Plaintiff’s medical records, there is no indication that the \nPlaintiff suffered from a disability as defined in Title II of the ADA.   \n  Prior to his incarceration on or about July 2015, Plaintiff was employed as a sheet metal \nworker for Local 28.  Exhibit 2, pg. 19.  His duties involved cutting and hanging sheet metal.  Ex. \n2, pg. 40.  During Plaintiff’s incarceration, he completed a training course for “inmate program \nassociates” and was employed as a B2 clerk.  Exhibit 3, pg. 132.  The duties of the position \nconsisted of assisting other inmates and staff with clerical duties.  Ex. 3, pg. 34.  The Plaintiff \nreceived positive  evaluations related to his employment while incarcerated.   Id.  The only \nreasonable  accommodation  requests  Plaintiff  submitted  while  in  prison  from  July  2015  – \nDecember 2018 were those related to seeking to participate in the SIP and/or alternative Shock.  \nPlaintiff did not require any accommodations to participate in any of the programming he engaged \nin while incarcerated, nor for any other aspect of his period of incarceration. \n  Upon Plaintiff’s release from DOCCS, he was employed by a roofing company wherein \nhis duties included going up on roofs and applying insulation, rolling polyurethane on to roofs \nwith a roller, and/or using a blower to clean the roofs off.  Ex. 2, pg. 36.  Plaintiff also worked at \n7-11 as a cashier post incarceration (Ex. 2, pg. 37); he worked for a pool company wherein he rode \nhis bike to work and his duties were to rake leaves out of pools (Ex. 2, pg. 34, 35); he worked for \na flooring company wherein his duties were to mix liquids in a bucket, pour them on the floor with \na paintbrush and/or pole and roll the material onto the floor; he worked for a moving company \n(Ex. 2, pg. 39); he worked cleaning out an 85 year old widow’s home (Ex. 2, pg. 26); and he \nworked for a construction company (Ex. 2, pg. 49).  Plaintiff testified during his deposition that he \nleft 7-11 to work for the roofing company because he felt he could learn something “and pursue \nsome sort of career as opposed to being a cashier.”  Ex. 2, pg. 38. Plaintiff also testified that he \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 12 of 35\n \nintended to return to his union job as a sheet metal worker post incarceration.  Ex. 2, pg. 184.  In \nfact, Plaintiff claims that he lost a lucrative career because his period of incarceration caused him \nto lose his employment as a sheet metal worker.  Id. \n  The Plaintiff submitted three reasonable accommodation requests to DOCCS requesting \nan accommodation to participate in the SIP, and/or the alternative to the SIP.  Dkt. No. 107, \nExhibits 9, 19, 29.  In each of them, as to the alleged impairment, Plaintiff lists various medical \nconditions he extracted from his medical records, and claims that the activity impaired is intense \nand/or vigorous physical activity.  (Ex. 9 – “can’t perform intense physical activity;” Ex. 19 – \n“rigorous activity;” Ex. 29 – “perform intensive and vigorous physical activity.”)  The Plaintiff \nhas never alleged in his pleadings, or his discovery responses, or his deposition testimony that the \nalleged  impairment  of  being  unable  to  perform  intense  and/or  vigorous  physical  activity \nconstituted a major life activity; nor does he demonstrate how the alleged impairment of being \nunable to engage in intense and/or rigorous physical activity substantially limited any major life \nactivity. \n  The  Plaintiff  submitted  six  grievances  related  to  DOCCS  denying  his  reasonable \naccommodation  requests  to  be  granted  an  accommodation  to  participate  in  SIP  and/or  the \nalternative to SIP.  Dkt. No. 107, Exhibits 10, 12, 15, 17, 24, 33.  The grievances do not contain \nany information as to how any of the medical conditions listed on his reasonable accommodation \nrequests are impairments; nor how allegedly being unable to perform intense and/or vigorous \nphysical activity constituted a major life activity; nor how this alleged major life activity is \nsubstantially impaired in any of the grievances he submitted. \n  Based on the foregoing, there is no triable issue of fact that the Plaintiff is not a qualified \nperson with a disability.  Throughout Plaintiff’s pleadings, and responses to discovery demands, \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 13 of 35\n \nPlaintiff offers nothing more than a list of medical conditions extracted from his medical records \nin support of his assertion that he suffers from an impairment.   As far as the activity claimed to be \nimpaired,  Plaintiff  has  never  offered  anything  more  than  “intense  and/or  rigorous  physical \nactivity,” and he has never offered anything to support that said activity constitutes a major life \nactivity.  Given the fact that the Plaintiff failed to specify the impairment he allegedly suffered \nfrom, or how any activity claimed to be impaired was a major life activity, he failed to demonstrate \nthat any alleged impairment substantially limits any major life activity.  The Plaintiff has not \noffered any medical testimony, or an opinion from any medical professional, to support that he \nwas a qualified person with a disability pursuant to the ADA at any point during his incarceration \nfrom July 2015 thru December 2018.  Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s \nfirst and second causes of action alleging violations of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \nagainst DOCCS. \nPOINT II \nPLAINTIFF CANNOT RAISE A TRIABLE ISSUE OF FACT TO SUPPORT A CLAIM \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nA.  Plaintiff was not deprived of a constitutional right \n  Liberty interests protected by the 14th Amendment may arise directly from the Due Process \nClause itself or from the laws of the states.  Klos v. Haskell, 48 F.3d 81, *86 (U.S. Ct. Appeals \n1995).  However, “lawfully incarcerated persons retain only a narrow range of protected liberty \ninterests.”  Id. (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 466 (1983)).  Thus, Courts haveheld that \nan inmate has no inherent liberty interest in commutation of his sentence (Connecticut Bd. of \nPardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 464 (1981)), in being paroled (Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. \nPenal  &  Correctional  Complex,  442  U.S.  1  (1979)),  or  in  receiving  good  time  credit  for \nsatisfactory behavior while in prison (Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557 (1974)).  Id.  There \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 14 of 35\n \nis no enforceable liberty interest in participating in the SIP.  Enosken v. Squires, 532 F. Supp. 3d \n75, 93 (E.D.N.Y. 2021).  There is no constitutional right to placement in a program which may \nexpedite one’s release from prison.  Matthews v. Thomas, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184550, *7 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2017); see also McMillan v. Perez, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125812, *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). \n  A state may confer enforceable liberty interests on prisoners through its enactment of \nstatutory or regulatory measures which place substantive limitations on prison officials’ discretion.  \nKlos v. Haskell, 48 F. 3d 81, *86 (2nd Cir. 1995).  For a liberty interest to be conferred by the state, \ntwo  requirements  must  be  met;  (1)  the  state  must  have  articulated  specified  “substantive \npredicates” which limit the discretion of state officials; and (2) it must have employed “explicitly \nmandatory language,” requiring state officials to follow those substantive predicates.  Id. See also \nKentucky Dept’s of Corrections v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 462 -63 (1989), Wright v. Smith, 21 \nF.3d 496, 498 (2nd Cir. 1994).   \n  The statute and regulations pertaining to SIP place no limit on the Commissioner’s decision \nto approve or disapprove an inmate’s application for enrollment in the Shock program.  Klos, 48 \nF.3d 81, *87.  While a screening committee must review the inmate’s application to determine \nwhether the “inmate’s participation in the shock incarceration program is consistent with the safety \nof the community, the welfare of the applicant and the rules and regulations of the department,” \n(N.Y. Correct. Law § 867.2) and while the committee, if it finds the application in compliance \nwith these requirements, “shall forward the application to the commissioner or his designee for \napproval or disapproval,” (Id.) the statute is entirely silent on how the Commissioner is to exercise \nhis discretion in approving or disapproving the forwarded application. Klos, supra.  “Participation \nin the shock incarceration program shall be a privilege.  Nothing contained in this article may be \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 15 of 35\n \nconstrued to confer upon any incarcerated individual the right to participate or continue to \nparticipate therein.”   (N.Y. Correct. Law § 867.5)   \n  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff was not deprived of any constitutional right, therefore, \nhis 14th Amendment equal protection claim against all of the individual defendants in their \nindividual capacity must be dismissed. \nB.  At all times referenced in Plaintiff’s Complaint, the Defendants were acting in \ntheir official capacity and did not have the requisite “personal involvement”. \n \n  To state a claim for individual liability under Section 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate \nthat the defendant had personal involvement in the alleged constitutional violation in order to \nestablish a claim against such defendant in their individual capacity.  Kantrowitz v. Uniondale \nUnion Free Sch. Dist., 822 F.Supp.2d 196, 218 (E.D.N.Y. 2011); Gill v. Mooney, 824 F.2d 192, \n196 (2d Cir. 1987) (“[a]bsent some personal involvement by [a defendant] in the allegedly \nunlawful conduct of his subordinates, he cannot be held liable under section 1983”) (citations \nomitted).  “[M]ere bald assertions and conclusions of law do not suffice.”  Davis v. County of \nNassau, 355 F.Supp.2d 668, 677 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n  “[I]n order to state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege (1) that the challenged \nconduct was attributable at least in part to a person acting under color of state law, and (2) that \nsuch conduct deprived the plaintiff of a right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution \nor laws of the United States.”  Engleston v. Guido, 41 F.3d 865, 876 (2d Cir. 1994) (internal \nquotations omitted), cert denied, 516 U.S. 808 (1995).  “The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th \nAmendment to the United States Constitution is essentially a direction that all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.”  Zahra v. Town of Southold, 48 F.3d 674, 683 (2d Cir. 1995) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  An equal protection claim under the 14th Amendment is proper \nwhere it is established that the person, compared with others similarly situated, was selectively \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 16 of 35\n \ntreated, and that the selective treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis \nof impermissible considerations, such as race or religion, to punish or inhibit the exercise of \nconstitutional rights, or by a malicious or bad faith intent to injure the person.  Id.  Plaintiff’s 2nd \nAmended Complaint fails to allege a triable issue of fact that the individually named Defendants \nwere “personally involved” in any violation of his 14th Amendment right to equal protection. \nDefendant Cluever \n  Counsel for Plaintiff deposed Defendant Cluever on March 23, 2022.  Defendant Cluever \nis employed by DOCCS as a Offender Rehabilitation Aide (“ORA”) assigned to the Greene \nCorrectional Facility (“Greene C.F.”) and has been so employed for approximately seven years.  \nExhibit 4, pgs. 8 – 9.  Her duties consist of providing assistance to the Offender Rehabilitation \nCoordinators, submitting phone number requests, completing outside clearance forms, enrolling \nincarcerated individuals (“i/i”) in the Shock Incarceration Program, completing Shock screening \nforms, and covering for the ORCs when they are unable to fulfill their duties as necessary.  Id. \nPlaintiff sues Defendant Cluever in her individual capacity.  Dkt. No. 107, ¶¶ 12 - 13, 95 – 97. \n  On or about July 24, 2007, Plaintiff executed a Shock Incarceration Program Memo of \nAgreement.  Dkt. No. 107, Ex. 18.  Defendant Cleuver also signed the Memo of Agreement and \nsubmitted it to her supervisor pursuant to her duties as an ORA.  She did not discuss the \nmemorandum, nor plaintiff’s handwritten note therein, with the plaintiff, her supervisor, or any \nother DOCCS personnel.  Exhibit 4, pgs. 48 – 49. \n  On or about July 24, 2017, as part of her duties as an ORA, Defendant Cleuver completed \na Shock Incarceration Suitability Screening Form related to the Plaintiff.  Dkt. No. 107, Ex. 20.  \nShe completed the form by accessing requisite information about the plaintiff utilizing various \nDOCCS computer screens, as well as his Presentence Investigation Report, his guidance folder \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 17 of 35\n \nand his parole folder located within his DOCCS file.  Exhibit 4, pg. 53.  Defendant Cleuver \ncompleted, or left blank, all numbered sections of the form except section number 13, “medical \nstatus.”  Exhibit 4, pgs. 55 – 65.  It was not part of her duties, as an ORA, to complete section 13.  \nId. \n  On or about September 29, 2017, Plaintiff executed a Shock Incarceration Program \nMemo of Agreement.  Dkt. No. 107, Ex. 28.  Defendant Cleuver also signed the Memo of \nAgreement and submitted it to her supervisor pursuant to her duties as an ORA.  Exhibit 4, pgs. \n72 – 73.  She did not discuss the memorandum, nor plaintiff’s handwritten note therein, with the \nplaintiff, her supervisor, or any other DOCCS personnel. Exhibit 4, pgs. 74 – 76. \n  On or about October 2, 2017, as part of her duties as an ORA, Defendant Cleuver \ncompleted a Shock Incarceration Suitability Screening Form related to the Plaintiff.  Dkt. No. \n107, Ex. 30.  She completed the form by accessing requisite information about the plaintiff \nutilizing various DOCCS computer screens, as well as his Presentence Investigation Report, his \nguidance folder, and his parole folder located within his DOCCS file.  Exhibit 4, pgs. 77 – 86.  \nDefendant Cleuver completed, or left blank, all numbered sections of the form except section \nnumber 13, “medical status.”  Id.  It is not part of her duties, as an ORA, to complete section 13.  \nId. \n  In completing the Shock Suitability Screening Form, Defendant Cleuver does not have  \ndiscretion as to what she puts on the form. She simply relays information found on DOCCS \ncomputer screens, and/or in the plaintiff’s DOCCS file, on to the form.  Exhibit 4, pgs. 35, 55 – \n65, 77 – 86. As an ORA at Greene Correctional Facility, she has nothing to do with incarcerated \nindividuals’ requests for Reasonable Accommodations, nor the approval or denial thereof.  \nExhibit 4, pgs. 21 – 22.  Any such requests received by Defendant Cleuver would be submitted \n11 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 18 of 35\n \nto her supervisor for handling.  Exhibit 4, pg. 49.  She would have completed the screening \nforms in the same manner whether the Plaintiff requested an accommodation or not.  Id.  \nDefendant Cleuver never discussed the Plaintiff’s request for reasonable accommodation with \nanyone.  Exhibit 4, pgs. 44 – 45, 49 – 50, 87. \n  As an ORA at Greene Correctional Facility, Defendant Cleuver has no role in \ndetermining whether an incarcerated individual is suitable for the Shock Incarceration Program.  \nExhibit 4, pgs. 8 – 9.  She is not informed as to whether an incarcerated individual is qualified, or \ndisqualified, for the program nor the reason therefore.  Ex. 4, pgs. 44 – 45, 67 – 68. She does not \nknow why Plaintiff was disqualified for Shock with reason code 99 on July 24, 2017, nor why \nPlaintiff was disqualified for Shock with reason code 08 on October 13, 2017.  Id.  She had \nnothing to do with those decisions.  Id.  In other words, she had no personal involvement in the \ncomplained-of decisions. \n  Based on the foregoing, Defendant Cleuver is entitled to summary judgment dismissing \nthe equal protection claims against her.  At all times referenced herein Defendant Cleuver was \nacting in her official capacity as an ORA employed by DOCCS.  Plaintiff fails to raise a triable \nissue of fact that Defendant Cleuver treated the Plaintiff any differently than she treated any \nother i/i who was not court ordered to SIP and unable to participate in traditional SIP, or that she \ndiscriminated against him in any way.  There is no genuine dispute that any conduct on the part \nof Defendant Cleuver was motivated by discriminatory animus or ill will based on any alleged \ndisability of the Plaintiff.  Most significantly, the record establishes that Defendant Cleuver had \nno personal role in making any decisions related to the Plaintiff at any point during his \nincarceration at Greene C.F., and in particular his inclusion, or non-inclusion, in the Shock \nprogram.  Exhibit 4.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 19 of 35\n \nDefendant O’Hara \n  Plaintiff’s counsel deposed Defendant O’Hara on February 22, 2022.  Defendant O’Hara \nis employed by DOCCS as a Supervising Offender Rehabilitation Coordinator (“SORC”) \nassigned to the Mohawk Correctional Facility since April 2018.  Exhibit 5, pg 14.  Prior to being \nassigned to Mohawk Correctional Facility she was assigned to Greene C.F beginning July 2016.  \nExhibit 5, pg. 17.  O’Hara’s duties as a SORC are to supervise the guidance unit and community \nsupervision.  Exhibit 5, pg. 14.  She is responsible for reviewing parole files prior to them going \nto the parole board and reviewing release paperwork upon an i/i’s release.  Exhibit 5, pg. 61.  \nWhile a SORC at Greene C.F. Defendant O’Hara had nothing to do with determining reasonable \naccommodation requests.  Exhibit 5, pg. 25. Plaintiff sues Defendant O’Hara in her individual \ncapacity.  Dkt. No. 107, ¶¶ 20 - 21, 95 – 97. \n  As a SORC at Greene C.F., Defendant O’Hara received a list of i/i to screen for the SIP.  \nEx. 5, pg. 23.  The individuals go through the screening process and then watch a video. Id. They \nthen accept or deny participation in SIP.  Id.  If they accept, a form is filled out and sent to \nmedical to see if the i/ i is medically suitable for SIP.  Id.  Defendant O’Hara denied the Plaintiff \nparticipation in SIP because medical personnel at Greene C.F. said he was not suitable for SIP.  \nExhibit 5, pgs. 23 – 24.   \n  On or about August 31, 2017, Defendant O’Hara wrote a memo to the Assistant Deputy \nSuperintendent of Programs regarding one of Plaintiff’s grievances as directed by her supervisor.  \nExhibit 6, pg. 25.  (Attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit G is the memo.)  \nParticipants in SIP had to agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the program.  Exhibit \nF, pg. 29, Ex. 6. In the memo, Defendant O’Hara stated that the Plaintiff’s grievance should be \ndenied because the Plaintiff did not agree to participate in the SIP unless he was granted a \n13 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 20 of 35\n \nreasonable accommodation.  Exhibit 6.  She also stated the Plaintiff’s grievance should be denied \nbecause he did not meet the qualifications to participate in SIP pursuant to Corrections Law §§ \n865 and 867, including that all participants are bound by the terms and conditions and are \nrequired to participate in daily p.t. and rigorous physical activity.  Id.  Pursuant to DOCCS \npolicy, only i/i who were court ordered to participate in the SIP could participate in an alternative \nto the SIP if they were unable to participate in traditional SIP.  Exhibit 5, pg. 43.   \n   Defendant O’Hara had no role in policy making at Greene C.F.  Exhibit 5., pg. 43.  \nDefendant O’Hara did not have anything to do with the SIP at Greene C.F. other than conducting \nscreenings of i/i.  Ex. 5.  She did not determine that Plaintiff was not suitable for the SIP, \nmedical personnel at Greene C.F. did.  Exhibit 5, pg. 31.  Defendant O’Hara did not have access \nto Plaintiff’s medical records while at Greene C.F., she had to rely on medical personnel’s \ndeterminations regarding SIP suitability.  Id.   \n  While at Greene C.F., Defendant O’Hara did not have any role in making \nrecommendations regarding release of i/i to community supervision.  Ex. 5, pg. 61.  Plaintiff’s \nparole file indicates that the Plaintiff received merit time which earned him six months off of his \nsentence.  Exhibit 5, pg. 63.  Plaintiff’s parole file further indicates that he was issued an earned \neligibility certificate.  Exhibit 5, pg. 72.  Plaintiff completed Alcohol and Substance Abuse \nTreatment (“ASAT”) as well as Aggression Replacement Training, phase one, while incarcerated \nat Greene C.F.  Exhibit 5, pg. 74.  The parole board commissioners make the determination as to \nwhether an i/i will be granted parole.  Exhibit 5, pg. 76. \n  Based on the foregoing, Defendant O’Hara is entitled to summary judgment dismissing \nthe equal protection claims against her.  At all times referenced herein Defendant O’Hara was \nacting in her official capacity as an SORC employed by DOCCS.  Plaintiff fails to raise a triable \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 21 of 35\n \nissue of fact that Defendant O’Hara treated the Plaintiff any differently than she treated any other \ni/i who was not court ordered to SIP and unable to participate in traditional SIP, or that she \ndiscriminated against him in any way.  There is no genuine dispute that any conduct on the part \nof Defendant O’Hara was not motivated by discriminatory animus or ill will based on any \nalleged disability of the Plaintiff, and there is no proof or evidence in the record to support such \nan assertion.   \n  Finally, Defendant O’Hara cannot be held liable by virtue of her status as a supervisory \nofficial.  A supervisory official \"may not be held liable for damages merely because he [or she] \nheld a high position of authority.\" Black v. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 72, 74 (2d Cir. 1996). In Tangreti \nv. Bachmann, the Second Circuit concluded that \"after Iqbal, there is no special rule for \nsupervisory liability. Instead, a plaintiff must plead and prove 'that each Government-official \ndefendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution.'\" 983 F.3d \n609, 618 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 676 (2009)). \n  Tangreti requires that Plaintiff allege and establish that a Defendant violated his rights \n\"by [her] own conduct, not by reason of [her] supervision of others who committed the \nviolation.\" 983 F.3d at 619. For supervisory Defendants, \"a mere 'linkage' to the unlawful \nconduct through 'the prison chain of command' . . . is insufficient to show his or her personal \ninvolvement in that unlawful conduct.\" Fabrizio v. Smith, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45856, 2021 \nWL 2211206, at *9 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2021), report and recommendation adopted, 2021 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 102365, 2021 WL 2211023 (N.D.N.Y. June 1, 2021). O’Hara’s mere role in \nresponding to a grievance does not lead to liability under Tangreti.  The alleged failure to \nremedy a wrong committed, as Plaintiff alleges as to these Defendants, is insufficient after \nTangreti, to establish their personal involvement.  Neb Morrow v. Vanderwerff, 2022 U.S. Dist. \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 22 of 35\n \nLEXIS 2838, *8 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2022); Logan v. Graham, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185140, \n2021 WL 4440344, at *4-5 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2021). \nDefendant Fisher \n  Plaintiff’ counsel deposed Defendant Fisher on March 21, 2022.  From approximately \nMay 2015 until 2017 Defendant Fisher was the Assistant Deputy Superintendent of Programs \n(“ADSP”) at Greene C.F.  Exhibit 3, pg. 10.  In this role, her duties were to do anything that the \nDeputy Superintendent of Programs directed her to do.  Exhibit 3, pg. 34.  She was in charge of \nthe guidance unit, she was required to do rounds of the facility, she oversaw programs in the \nfacility, she answered emails on behalf of the Deputy Superintendent of Programs, she signed off \non transfer requests that the guidance unit sent, she assisted in reviewing parole board reports, \nshe participated in temporary release committees and program committees, she attended \ndisciplinary hearings, and dealt with personnel matters.  Exhibit 3, pg. 36.  Plaintiff sues \nDefendant Fisher in her individual capacity.  Dkt. No. 107, ¶¶ 14 - 15, 95 – 97. \n  Defendant Fisher was responsible for reviewing and signing off on completed SIP \nscreenings.  Exhibit 3, pg. 38.  She reviewed them for accuracy, completeness and content.  \nExhibit 3, pg. 39.  Defendant Fisher was also responsible for reviewing reasonable \naccommodation requests, sending them to medical, reviewing them when they were returned \nfrom medical, and making the determination as to grant or deny the request in conjunction with \nthe Deputy Superintendent.  Exhibit 3, pg. 39 - 41.   \n  The SIP is a privilege given to i/i who qualify and meet specific criteria.  Exhibit 3, pg. \n46.  If they complete the six-month program the board of parole may release them at the end of \nthe six months but they do not have to.  Id.  A Shock alternative program was designed for those \nindividuals who were ordered by the court to attend Shock who for some reason had a physical \n16 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 23 of 35\n \nor mental disability, or for any other reason, could not attend the actual Shock program.  Exhibit \n3, pg. 58. \n  On or about February 22, 2017, Defendant Fisher received a request for reasonable \naccommodation to participate in the Shock program submitted by the Plaintiff.  Dkt. No. 107, \nEx. 9.  Defendant Fisher sent the request to medical personnel at DOCCS for their review.  \nExhibit 3, pg. 59.  Medical personnel at Greene C.F. indicated that the Plaintiff was not capable \nof participating in the SIP.  Exhibit 3, pg. 60.  Defendant Fisher relied on medical personnel’s \nopinion that the Plaintiff was not capable of participating in SIP when she denied the Plaintiff’s \nrequest.  Exhibit 3, pg. 61.  Defendant Fisher also denied the Plaintiff’s reasonable \naccommodation request because the Plaintiff was not court ordered to Shock therefore, according \nto DOCCS policy, he was not eligible for the Shock alternative program.  Exhibit 3, pg. 63, 68. \n  On or about July 24, 2017, Defendant Fisher received a request for reasonable \naccommodation to participate in the Shock program submitted by the Plaintiff. Dkt. No. 107, Ex. \n19. Defendant Fisher sent the request to medical personnel at DOCCS for their review.  Exhibit \n3, pg. 73.  Medical personnel at Greene C.F. indicated that the Plaintiff’s current medical \nregimen precludes Shock.  Dkt. No. 107, Ex. 19.  Defendant Fisher relied on medical personnel’s \nopinion that the Plaintiff’s current medical regimen precludes Shock.  Exhibit 3, pg. 74.  In \ndenying Plaintiff’s reasonable accommodation request, Defendant Fisher followed DOCCS \npolicy that i/i who could not participate in Shock could participate in an alternative to Shock only \nif they were court ordered.  Exhibit 3, pp. 79, 91, 128.  Defendant Fisher denied the Plaintiff’s \nrequests for reasonable accommodation to participate in SIP because medical personnel at \nGreene C.F. said he was unsuitable for participation and because DOCCS policy did not allow \nhim to participate in an alternative to SIP.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 24 of 35\n \n  Based on the foregoing, Defendant Fisher is entitled to summary judgment dismissing the \nequal protection claims against her.  At all times referenced herein Defendant Fisher was acting \nin her official capacity as an ADSP employed by DOCCS.  Plaintiff fails to raise a triable issue \nof fact that Defendant Fisher treated the Plaintiff any differently than she treated any other i/i \nwho was not court ordered to SIP and unable to participate in traditional SIP, or that she \ndiscriminated against him in any way.  There is no genuine dispute that any conduct on the part \nof Defendant Fisher was not motivated by discriminatory animus or ill will based on any alleged \ndisability of the Plaintiff, and there is no proof or evidence in the record to support such an \nassertion.   \nDefendant Hammond \n  Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations against Defendant \nHammond.  Dkt. No. 107.  In fact, Defendant Hammond is only referenced in ¶¶ 12 – 13 of the \nComplaint wherein it is alleged that she “functions as the Deputy Superintendent of Programs at \nGreene C.F.” (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 12); and that “Ms. Hammond, in her individual capacity……is \nlegally responsible for ensuring proper placement in programs or services for eligible and \nqualified inmates so that they may benefit from its rehabilitative components.”  (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ \n13.)  In response to Defendants’ Interrogatory request to describe each and every occasion on \nwhich the Plaintiff alleges his constitutional rights were violated by Defendant Hammond, the \nPlaintiff simply referred to his response to Interrogatory number one which pertained to \nDefendant Anthony Annucci.  Plaintiff’s responses to Defendants’ first set of Interrogatories is \nattached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit “1”.  Defendant Hammond was not deposed by \nPlaintiff’s counsel, and discovery in this matter is closed. \n18 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 25 of 35\n \n  Plaintiff’s Complaint, and Plaintiff’s discovery responses, fail to allege that Defendant \nHammond had any personal involvement in determining what programming the Plaintiff \nengaged in while incarcerated at Greene C.F., or granting or denying any reasonable \naccommodation requests Plaintiff submitted, nor do they allege that Defendant Hammond \nsubjected the Plaintiff to unequal treatment, or that any conduct on the part of Hammond was \nmotivated by discriminatory animus or ill will based on the Plaintiff’s alleged disability.  Dkt. \nNo. 107.  Thus, Defendant Hammond lacks the requisite personal involvement, and claims \nagainst this Defendant should be dismissed pursuant to Tangreti v. Bachmann, supra. \n  Plaintiff’s  2nd  Amended  Complaint,  and  responses  to  discovery  demands,  fail  to \ndemonstrate that Defendant Hammond had the requisite personal involvement in order to establish \na claim against her in her individual capacity. “[M]ere bald assertions and conclusions of law do \nnot suffice.”  Davis v. County of Nassau, 355 F.Supp.2d 668, 677 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact \nregarding the personal liability of Defendant Hammond; and Defendant Hammond is entitled to \nsummary judgment dismissing Plaintiff’s 14th Amendment equal protection claim against her. \nDefendant L. Mardon \n   Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations against Defendant L. \nMardon.  Dkt. No. 107.  In fact, Defendant Mardon is only referenced in ¶¶ 18 – 19 of the \nComplaint wherein it is alleged that she “functions as a Senior/Supervising Offender \nRehabilitator Coordinator at Greene C.F.” (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 18); and that “L. Mardon, in her \nindividual capacity……duties consist of but are not limited to coordinating rehabilitative efforts \nto ensure eligible and qualified inmates benefit from programs or services through screening and \nsuitability and overseeing the conduct and behavior of subordinate Offender Rehabilitation \n19 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 26 of 35\n \nCoordinators.”  (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 19.)  In response to Defendants’ Interrogatory request to \ndescribe each and every occasion on which the Plaintiff alleges his constitutional rights were \nviolated by Defendant Mardon, the Plaintiff simply referred to his response to Interrogatory \nnumber one which pertained to Defendant Anthony Annucci.  Plaintiff’s responses to \nDefendants’ first set of Interrogatories is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit “1”.  \nDefendant Mardon was not deposed by Plaintiff’s counsel, and discovery in this matter is closed. \n  Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint, and Plaintiff’s discovery responses, fail to allege that \nDefendant Mardon had any personal involvement in determining what programming the Plaintiff \nengaged in while incarcerated at Greene C.F., or granting or denying any reasonable \naccommodation requests Plaintiff submitted, nor do they allege that Defendant Mardon subjected \nthe Plaintiff to unequal treatment, or that any conduct on the part of Hammond was motivated by \ndiscriminatory animus or ill will based on the Plaintiff’s alleged disability.  Dkt. No. 107. \n  Plaintiff’s  2nd  Amended  Complaint,  and  responses  to  discovery  demands,  fail  to \ndemonstrate that Defendant Mardon had the requisite personal involvement in order to establish a \nclaim against her in her individual capacity. Tangreti v. Bachmann,  supra.  “[M]ere bald assertions \nand conclusions of law do not suffice.”  Davis v. County of Nassau,supra.  Therefore, Defendant \nMardon is entitled to summary judgment dismissing Plaintiff’s 14th Amendment equal protection \nclaim against her. \nDefendant Commissioner Anthony Annucci \n  Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations against Defendant \nAnthony Annucci.  Dkt. No. 107.  In fact, Defendant Annucci is only referenced in ¶¶ 6 – 7 of \nthe Complaint wherein it is alleged that he functions as the Commissioner of DOCCS (Dkt. No. \n107, ¶ 6) and, in his individual capacity, he is legally responsible for the overall operations and \n20 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 27 of 35\n \npolicies of the department including Greene C.F. (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 8).  In response to Defendants’ \nInterrogatory request to describe each and every occasion on which the Plaintiff alleges his \nconstitutional rights were violated by Defendant Annucci, the Plaintiff replied, “Plaintiff lists the \nfollowing dates and violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,” and went \non to repeat the allegations contained in Plaintiff’s Complaint, none of which assert any personal \ninvolvement of Defendant Annucci.  Plaintiff’s responses to Defendants’ first set of \nInterrogatories is attached hereto and made a part hereof as Exhibit “1”.  Defendant Annucci was \nnot deposed by Plaintiff’s counsel, and discovery in this matter is closed. \n  As  set  forth  above,  Plaintiff’s  2nd  Amended  Complaint,  and  responses  to  discovery \ndemands, fail to demonstrate that Defendant Annucci had the requisite personal involvement in \norder to establish a claim against him in his individual capacity. Tangreti v. Bachmann,  supra. All \nclaims against Annucci should be dismissed.  \nDefendant M. Noriega \n  Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations against Defendant M. \nNoriega.  Dkt. No. 107.  In fact, Defendant Noriega is only referenced in ¶¶ 24, 25, 49 of the \nComplaint and none of those paragraphs allege that Defendant Noriega had any personal \ninvolvement in determining what programming the Plaintiff engaged in while incarcerated at \nGreene C.F.; or granting or denying any reasonable accommodation requests Plaintiff submitted. \n(Dkt. No. 107, ¶¶ 24, 25, 49.)  Neither Plaintiff’s Complaint nor interrogatory responses allege \nthat Defendant Noriega was in a position to make any decisions regarding any matter affecting or \nrelating to the Plaintiff, nor does it allege that Defendant Noriega subjected the Plaintiff to \nunequal treatment, or that any of Noriega’s conduct was motivated by discriminatory animus or \nill will based on the Plaintiff’s alleged disability.  Dkt.

All claims against \nNoriega should be dismissed. \nDefendant Rehabilitation Coordinator Welytok \n  Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations against Defendant \nWelytok.  Dkt. No. 107.  In fact, Defendant Welytok is only referenced in ¶¶ 26, 27, 45, 46 of \nthe Complaint and none of those paragraphs allege that Defendant Welytok had any personal \ninvolvement in determining what programming the Plaintiff engaged in while incarcerated at \nGreene C.F.; or granting or denying any reasonable accommodation requests Plaintiff submitted. \n(Dkt.

All claims against \nWelytok should be dismissed.  \nDefendant Assistant Commissioner Bryan Hilton \n  Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations against Defendant \nHilton.  Dkt. No. 107.  In fact, Defendant Hilton is only referenced in ¶¶ 8, 9 of the Complaint \n22 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 29 of 35\n \nwherein it is alleged that he functions as the Assistant Commissioner of DOCCS (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ \n8) and, in his individual capacity, he is legally responsible for the operations and policies of the \ndepartment including Greene C.F. (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 9).  Neither Plaintiff’s Complaint, nor \nInterrogatory responses,  allege any conduct on the part of Defendant Hilton that subjected the \nPlaintiff to unequal treatment, n or that any of Hilton’s conduct was motivated by discriminatory \nanimus or ill will based on the Plaintiff’s alleged disability.  Dkt. No. 107; Ex. “1”. \n  Plaintiff’s  2nd  Amended  Complaint,  and  responses  to  discovery  demands,  fail  to \ndemonstrate that Defendant Hilton had the requisite personal involvement in order to establish a \nclaim against her in hid individual capacity. Tangreti v. Bachmann,  supra. All claims against \nHilton should be dismissed.  \nDeputy Superintendent Brandon Smith \n  Plaintiff’s 2nd Amended Complaint does not contain any allegations against Defendant \nBrandon Smith.  Dkt. No. 107.  In fact, Defendant Smith is only referenced in ¶¶ 10, 11 of the \nComplaint wherein it is alleged that he functions as the Superintendent of Greene C.F. (Dkt. No. \n107, ¶ 10) and, in his individual capacity, he is legally responsible for the management of \nsubordinates, for the decisions, conduct, and behavior of all employees under his command; and \nthat he is responsible for rendering decisions on grievance complaints submitted by the inmate \npopulation. (Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 11).  Neither Plaintiff’s Complaint, nor his interrogatory responses, \nallege any conduct on the part of Defendant Smith that subjected the Plaintiff to unequal \ntreatment or that any of Smith’s conduct was motivated by discriminatory animus or ill will \nbased on the Plaintiff’s alleged disability.  Dkt. No. 107; Ex. “1”.   \n  Plaintiff’s  2nd  Amended  Complaint,  and  responses  to  discovery  demands,  fail  to \ndemonstrate that Defendant Smith had the requisite personal involvement in order to establish a \n23 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 30 of 35\n \nclaim against her in hid individual capacity. Tangreti v. Bachmann,  supra. All claims against \nSmith should be dismissed.  \nC. The Plaintiff was not subject to unequal treatment \n  As Plaintiff has repeatedly acknowledged since the commencement of this lawsuit, during \nthe time period that Plaintiff was incarcerated individuals who were not court ordered to participate \nin the SIP, and who were unable to participate in SIP for a mental, or physical reason, were not \nable to participate in alternative SIP.  Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 33.  Pursuant to statute, the only time that \nthe Commissioner could not exercise his discretion in approving or disapproving a SIP application \nwas for those inmates who were court ordered to the SIP. (N.Y. Correct. Law 867.2-a) The plaintiff \nwas not court ordered.  Dkt. No. 107, ¶ 37.  DOCCS treated the Plaintiff the same as they treated \nall other incarcerated individuals who were not court ordered to participate in SIP, and who were \nunable to participate in SIP.  See Exhibits 3, 4, 5, Smith Declaration. \nPOINT III \nPLAINTIFF’S CLAIM IS BARRED BY THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT DOCRTINE \nOF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY \n \n  The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not \nbe construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the \nUnited States by Citizens of another State or by Citizens or Subject of any Foreign State.”  U.S. \nConst. amend. XI.  The doctrine of sovereign immunity bars federal courts from hearing any suit \nbrought against a State or State agency absent the State’s consent or a valid abrogation of the \nState’s sovereign immunity by Congress.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. \n89, 100, (1984); Bd. of Tr. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 363 (2001) (“The ultimate \nguarantee of the Eleventh Amendment is that nonconsenting States may not be sued by private \n24 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 31 of 35\n \nindividuals in federal court.”)  The State of New York has not waived its sovereign immunity from \nsuits for damages under the ADA.  See Jones v. N.Y.State Metro Developmental Disabilities Servs., \n543 Fed. Appx. 20, 22 (2d Cir. 2013). \n  To determine that a federal statute validly abrogates a state’s sovereign immunity, the \nCourt must find both that Congress unequivocally intended to abrogate sovereign immunity, and \nthat Congress acted pursuant to constitutional authority in doing so.  See Bd. of Trs. v. Garrett, \n531 U.S. 356, 363 – 364 (Sup. Ct. 2001).  Regardless of its intent, Congress must act pursuant to \na “valid grant of constitutional authority” in abrogating a state’s sovereign immunity.  See \nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 517 -518 (2004) (“Congress can abrogate a State’s sovereign \nimmunity when it does so pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to enforce the substantive guarantees of that Amendment.”).  In the context of the \nADA,  the  authority  to  abrogate  a  state’s  sovereign  immunity  arises  out  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment, which permits Congress to “enforce, by ‘appropriate legislation’ the constitutional \nguarantee that no State shall deprive any person of ‘life, liberty or property, without due process \nof law,’ nor deny any person ‘equal protection of the laws.’”  See Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Scis. \nCtr. Of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 108 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, \n517 (1997)).   \n  The issue of whether the ADA validly abrogates a state’s sovereign immunity, such that a \nplaintiff may recover money damages against a state defendant in his official capacity, has been \naddressed several times by the Supreme Court and Second Circuit.  In Garcia, the Second Circuit \nheld that a plaintiff may maintain a claim for money damages under Title II of the ADA against a \nstate official, acting in his official capacity, only where the plaintiff has established that “the Title \n25 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 32 of 35\n \nII violation was motivated by either discriminatory animus or ill will due to [his] disability.”  See \nGarcia, 280 F.3d at 111. \n  Following Garcia, the Supreme Court in United States v. Georgia, further defined the \ncontours of ADA abrogation, holding that “insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for \ndamages against the States for conduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II \nvalidly abrogates state sovereign immunity.”  United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151 (2006) \n(emphasis in original).  Under Georgia, courts must determine “on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) \nwhich aspects of the State’s alleged conduct violated Title II; (2) to what extent such misconduct \nalso violated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but \ndid not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether Congress’ purported abrogation of sovereign \nimmunity as to that class of conduct is nevertheless valid.”  Georgia, 546 U.S. at 159.  Thus, the \nGeorgia court “explicitly left open the question of whether Congress may validly abrogate \nsovereign immunity with respect to a particular class of misconduct that violates Title II but does \nnot violate the Fourteenth Amendment.”  See Dean v. University of Buffalo School of Medicine \nand Biomedical Sciences, 804 F.3d 178, 194-195 (2d Cir. 2015). \n  In Bolmer v. Oliveira, the Second Circuit revisited the issue of ADA abrogation, and held \nthat Garcia’s “discriminatory animus” requirement applies only where abrogation is used to \nenforce the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Bolmer v. Oliveira, 594 \nF.3d 134, 148 (2d Cir. 2010).  Relying on the Supreme Court’s holding in Georgia, the Second \nCircuit held that a plaintiff need not prove “discriminatory animus” where he seeks to enforce \nother aspects of his substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id.  Although \nthis line of cases leaves the ADA abrogation standard somewhat unsettled, “[w]hat is clear, is that \nafter  Georgia,  sovereign  immunity  will  be  abrogated  under  Title  II  when  a  plaintiff  can \n26 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 33 of 35\n \ndemonstrate an actual Fourteenth Amendment violation.”  See Hilton v. Wright, 928 F.Supp. 2d \n530, 556 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 11, 2013) (finding that the state’s sovereign immunity was abrogated \nwhere “the same conduct which violates Title II also violates the Eighth Amendment.”). \n  Here, Plaintiff seeks money damages under the ADA against DOCCS and the individual \nDefendants in their individual capacities.  Dkt. No. 107, pgs. 18 – 21.  On its face, this claim is \nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment doctrine of sovereign immunity.  Furthermore, this case does \nnot present a circumstance in which the State’s sovereign immunity should be abrogated. \n  Plaintiff’s ADA claim arises out of the Equal Protection clause because he complains that \nhe was not afforded reasonable accommodations for a disability to enable him equal access to the \nprograms or services at his correctional facility.  Therefore, the State’s sovereign immunity may \nonly be abrogated where plaintiff can establish that the defendants acted with “discriminatory \nanimus or ill will” toward his disability.  See Kearney v. N.Y.S.D.O.C.S, 2013 U.S.Dist. LEXIS \n140932, at*26 (N.D.N.Y. July 31, 2013) (an inmate’s claim that he was denied a reasonable \naccommodation under the ADA is “grounded in the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment” and therefore he is required to demonstrate “discriminatory animus or ill will” \ntoward his disability to overcome the State’s sovereign immunity).  The evidence belies any \nassertion that the defendants, or any other DOCCS personnel, acted with “discriminatory animus \nor will will” toward plaintiff’s alleged disability.  See Ramrattan v. Fischer, 2015 U.S.Dist. LEXIS \n74510, at *13 (N.D.N.Y. June 9, 2015) (granting defendant’s motion to dismiss where plaintiff \nfailed to allege “any discriminatory animus, or that he was excluded from any public service \nbecause of ill will against his disability.”) \n  Furthermore, even if the Court applies the Georgia analysis, the circumstances of this case \nstill do not present any basis for abrogation.  The record shows that defendants fully complied with \n27 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 34 of 35\n \nthe dictates of Title II of the ADA and the Fourteenth Amendment.  As discussed above, plaintiff \nfails to state a viable claim under Title II because he is not a “qualified individual with a disability” \nunder the strict requirements of the ADA.  Therefore, Plaintiff cannot satisfy the first prong of the \nGeorgia court’s abrogation analysis by identifying some aspect of the State’s conduct that violated \nTitle II, since he does not qualify for Title II protection in the first place.  “[I]f a plaintiff cannot \nstate a Title II claim, the court’s sovereign immunity inquiry is at an end.”  Mary Jo C. v. N.Y.State \n& Local Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 152 (2d Cir. 2013). \n  However, even if Plaintiff could be regarded as a “qualifying individual with a disability,” \nhe still fails to satisfy the second and third prongs of the Georgia analysis, which require plaintiff \nto prove either a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights or an independent Title II violation \nsufficient to abrogate immunity.  First, the Plaintiff was not deprived of a constitutional right.  \nSecond, the Plaintiff was treated the same as all other incarcerated individuals who were not court \nordered to the SIP.  However, even if the Plaintiff were able to prove that he was selectively treated, \nhe is unable to prove any discriminatory animus or ill will on behalf of any Defendant.  The record \nwholly dispels any claim that defendants violated Plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment rights or \ndiscriminated against him in violation of Title II.   \n  In sum, there is no basis to conclude that the State’s sovereign immunity should be \nabrogated.  Accordingly, this action is barred by sovereign immunity and should be dismissed in \nits entirety. \nCONCLUSION \n  Pursuant to the foregoing, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment dismissing the \n2nd Amended Complaint in its entirety with prejudice. \n28 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 161-12   Filed 05/01/23   Page 35 of 35\n \n \nDated: Albany, New York \nMay 1, 2023 \nLETITIA JAMES \nAttorney General of the State of New York \nAttorney for Defendants  \nThe Capitol \nAlbany, New York 12224 \n \n \nBy: s/ Stacey Hamilton \nStacey Hamilton \nAssistant Attorney General, of Counsel \nBar Roll No. 510484 \nTelephone: (518) 776-2288 \nEmail: Stacey.Hamilton@ag.ny.gov \n \n \ncc: Teresa Caturano via ECF \n      Geoffrey Schotter via ECF \n \n29 \n ",

Cluever, Laurie Fisher, Marie Hammond, Bryan \nHilton, L. Mardon, New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision \n(\"DOCCS\"), M. Noriega, L. O'Hara, and Brandon Smith (together \"defendants\").  Plaintiff, a \nphysically and psychologically disabled person, objects to DOCCS’s allegedly discriminatory \nhandling of its Shock Incarceration Program (\"SIP\") and its alternatives  \nGoodall’s claims rely on 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"§ 1983\") and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-213 (the \"ADA\").  Defendants, for their part, have moved \nto dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  \nThe motion having been fully briefed, it will now be considered on the basis of the parties' \nsubmissions without oral argument. \n  BACKGROUND \nA. Plaintiff's Sentencing and Early Encounters with SIP. \nOn July 14, 2015, Goodall was sentenced to three to six years’ imprisonment for \nthird-degree robbery in violation of N.Y. PENAL LAW § 160.05.  Dkt. 9 (the amended complaint, \nor \"AC\"), ¶ 37.1  His sentencing judge recommended—but did not order—that plaintiff \nparticipate in SIP.  Id.  SIP is a six-month program combining intense regimentation, exercise, \nand work therapy on the one hand with \"substance abuse treatment, education, pre-release \ncounseling, and life skills counseling\" on the other.  AC ¶ 31.   \n                                            \n1 The facts are taken entirely from plaintiff's complaint and any and all documents attached to it, because for the \npurposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, this Court must \"accept as true the factual allegations of the complaint, and \nconstrue all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the complaint in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff[.]\"  Anderson News, L.L.C. v. Am. Media, Inc., 680 F.3d 162, 185 (2d Cir. 2012). \n2 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 3 of 22\nTo be eligible for SIP, an inmate must be:  (1) between sixteen and forty-nine years of \nage both currently and at the time he committed his crime; (2) serving a sentence for which \nhe will be eligible for release, on parole or otherwise, within three years; (3) free of any prior \nconviction for a violent felony offense; (4) serving a sentence for a crime that is not among \nthose that automatically render an inmate ineligible for SIP; (5) free of any outstanding \nwarrants, commitments, charges, or immigration flags; and (6) medically and psychologically \nfit for the program as determined by DOCCS or New York's Office of Mental Health \nprofessionals.  Dkt. 9-1, p. 2.2  Plaintiff alleges that he meets each of these requirements \nsave the fitness requirement.  See id.; see also AC ¶ 32.  Inmates can be placed in SIP via \nvolunteer or court order.  AC ¶ 33. \nAlternatively, DOCCS has created the Comprehensive Alcohol & Substance Abuse \nTreatment (\"CASAT\") program.  AC ¶ 33.  CASAT has similar goals to SIP, but focuses \nprimarily on education and drug abuse prevention as opposed to SIP's heavy dose of \nphysical exercise.  Id.  According to Goodall, CASAT is exclusively available to the narrow \ncategory of inmates who were explicitly ordered into SIP but who could not meet the latter \nprogram’s physical and mental fitness requirements.  Id.  Completing either program without \nincident rewards an inmate with early release from incarceration or parole.  AC ¶¶ 31, 33. \nOn July 24, 2015, Goodall was transferred from county jail to Ulster Correctional \nFacility, run by DOCCS.  AC ¶ 38.  When Goodall arrived at Ulster, he alleges that the \nfacility's medical department stamped the word \"Shock\" on his chart, but drew an X through it \nto note that they did not find him qualified for SIP.  AC ¶ 38.   \nOn July 27, 2015, Ulster's medical staff notified more explicitly in his records that he \nwas '[n]ot a [SIP] candidate.\"  AC ¶ 39.  In particular, plaintiff's classification as in need of \n                                            \n2 Pagination corresponds with CM/ECF. \n3 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 4 of 22\n\"level three mental health services\" automatically excluded him from SIP.  AC ¶ 40.  \nAdditionally, DOCCS noted plaintiff’s heart disease, cardiac risk factors, and epilepsy as \ndisabilities that impeded his participation in SIP.  AC ¶ 41.  Plaintiff does not dispute that \nthose disabilities exist, and in fact alleges that they substantially limit \"one or more\" of his \n\"major life activities, including lifting and strenuous exercise.\"  AC ¶ 30. \nNevertheless, Goodall alleges that on October 23, 2015, he was offered a chance to \nparticipate in SIP.  AC ¶ 42.  However, his concern for his health and his fear that he would \nsuffer injury as a result of the program won out, and he declined the opportunity.  Id.  \nApparently, it struck Goodall as unfair that his only opportunity for early release \nthrough intensive therapy and treatment involved risking physical injury.  On February 19, \n2017, he submitted a Request for Reasonable Accommodations to participate in a SIP \nalternative including, potentially, CASAT.  AC ¶ 43.  Defendant Laurie Fisher (\"Fisher\"), the \nAssistant Deputy Superintendent of Programs at Greene Correctional Facility3 (\"Greene\"), \nallegedly denied plaintiff's request because SIP eligibility is determined by set requirements \nthat could not be circumvented.  Id. \nUndeterred, Goodall filed an Inmate Grievance Complaint on March 20, 2017.  \nAC ¶ 44.  That grievance argued that denying SIP violated his right to be “free from \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability\" including his rights under the ADA.  Id.  While the \ndecision on his grievance was pending, plaintiff requested to be reconsidered for SIP, but \ndefendant Offender Rehabilitation Coordinator (\"ORC\") Welytok refused to answer him.  \nAC ¶¶ 45-46.   \n                                            \n3 Apparently, at some point plaintiff was transferred to Greene from Ulster Correctional Facility, although the \ncomplaint is silent as to when—and even whether—this happened. \n4 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 5 of 22\nOn April 24, 2017, DOCCS denied plaintiff's grievance, allegedly stating again that SIP \nis not a reasonable accommodation, but a special program targeting specific inmates.  \nAC ¶ 47.  Apparently, the denial made no mention of CASAT or any available alternative.  Id. \nB. Plaintiff's May 25, 2017 Grievance. \nOn May 23, 2017, Fisher allegedly sent Goodall an Interdepartmental Communication \ninforming him that he was not eligible for SIP because he had already refused its generic \nform and because alternatives were only available by court order.  AC ¶ 48.  Plaintiff objected \nto the communication, because the declination form he had signed back in 2015 had explicitly \nallowed him to be reconsidered for SIP if he notified an ORC that he wanted to be considered \nagain.  Id.  According to plaintiff, he had done exactly what the form instructed him to do if he \nwished to be reconsidered for SIP.  Id. ¶¶ 45-46, 48.   \nGoodall voiced his displeasure at the Interdepartmental Communication with another \ngrievance, this one dated May 25, 2017.  AC ¶ 49.  On May 30, plaintiff asked defendant M. \nNoriega (\"Noriega\"), another Greene ORC, to clarify what, precisely, the communication \nmeant.  AC ¶ 50.  In response, he alleges that he only received another Interdepartmental \nCommunication stating that his SIP application was denied because he was a violent felon, \nwhich plaintiff asserts is untrue.  Id.  \nEvidently, Goodall’s May 25 grievance was denied, because he appealed the \ngrievance to Greene's superintendent, defendant Brandon Smith (\"Smith\").  AC ¶ 55; see \nDkt. 9-21.  When Smith denied his appeal on July 31, 2017, plaintiff appealed his grievance \nfurther to DOCCS's Central Office Review Committee (\"CORC\").  AC ¶ 55.  By extension, \nplaintiff alleges that he completely exhausted his administrative remedies for this grievance.  \nId. \nC. Plaintiff's August 23, 2017 Grievance. \n5 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 6 of 22\nSeeing one grievance through to completion did not satisfy Goodall, however.  \nEventually, on July 24, 2017, he and an unnamed ORC signed a \"Memo of Agreement\" for \nplaintiff to participate in SIP.  AC ¶ 52.  Plaintiff attached a reasonable accommodation form \nto the agreement to clarify that he still could not participate in the full program and was \nhoping for a viable alternative.  Id.  However, defendant Dr. Doreen Smith (\"Dr. Smith\"), \nGreene's Health Services Director, noted that plaintiff's seizure disorder precluded SIP \nparticipation, and Fisher further noted that SIP had specific required qualifications that could \nnot be accommodated.  AC ¶ 53.  As a result, plaintiff was denied participation in the program \nthat same day.  AC ¶ 54.  Plaintiff would grieve Dr. Smith's and Fisher's decision on August \n23, 2017.  AC ¶ 59. \n  The same pattern repeated itself several more times in the following months; Goodall \nwould request to be placed on SIP, get denied, and file a grievance, only to see the grievance \ndenied as well.  AC ¶¶ 55-65.  Meanwhile, a DOCCS Grievance Resolution Committee \nreviewed the August 23, 2017 grievance.  AC ¶ 61.  The committee stated that \"DOCCS \nshould have a medical alternative\" to SIP even if it would require a change to state law.  Id.; \nsee Dkt. 9-26.  However, the committee also noted that no further action was necessary \nbecause plaintiff had already submitted identical grievances in the past which were denied.  \nDkt. 9-26.  Plaintiff contended that the committee was wrong to find no further action possible \nbecause his grievance was based on a novel denial of SIP participation.  Id.  To express his \ndisagreement, and to exhaust his administrative remedies, plaintiff appealed the committee’s \ndetermination to Smith.  Id.; see AC ¶ 61. \n  On October 20, 2017, Smith combined Goodall's August 23, 2017 grievance with his \nseveral others, and presumably denied them all.4  AC ¶ 66.  Dissatisfied, plaintiff filed one \n                                            \n4 The complaint and its attached papers do not definitively say one way or the other whether Smith approved or \ndenied the appeal.   \n6 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 7 of 22\nfinal grievance on October 27, 2017.  Dkt. 9-33, p. 1.  On December 20, 2017, Smith again \ndenied plaintiff's grievance.  AC ¶ 69.  Plaintiff alleges that he appealed this last denial to \nCORC to completely exhaust his administrative remedies.  Id.   \nApparently deciding that grievances were not going to provide him with the remedy he \nsought, plaintiff served on the Attorney General a Notice of Intention to File a Claim on \nDecember 23, 2017.  AC ¶ 70.  A year later, on December 26, 2018, Goodall was released \nfrom prison.  AC ¶ 4.  On January 23, 2019, he followed through on his intention to file a \nclaim and brought the present complaint.  Dkt. 1.  In addition to the defendants named in the \nfactual recitation above, plaintiff brought § 1983 and ADA claims against defendants Anthony \nAnnucci and Bryan Hilton as Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of DOCCS, arguing \nthat they are responsible for the conduct of their subordinates.  AC ¶¶ 6-9.   \nAdditionally, Goodall alleges that defendant Marie Hammond, as Deputy \nSuperintendent of Programs at Greene, is responsible for ensuring proper placement of \ninmates in programs.  AC ¶¶ 12-13.  Defendants L. Mardon and L. O'Hara are the \nSenior/Supervising ORCs at Greene, and thus, plaintiff alleges, were responsible for every \nclaimed deprivation their subordinates caused.  AC ¶¶ 18-21.  Finally, defendant alleges that \ndefendant A. Cluever is a Greene ORC who is similarly responsible for coordinating \nrehabilitative efforts, including ensuring that plaintiff be able to take advantage of SIP.  \nAC ¶¶ 22-23. \nOn December 6, 2019, defendants, consisting of DOCCS and several of its employees \nwho were responsible for denying plaintiff's accommodation requests, filed the present \nmotion to dismiss the complaint.  Dkt. 87. \n  LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. \n7 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 8 of 22\n\"A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) \nwhen the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"  Makarova \nv. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000).  \"The plaintiff bears the burden of proving \nsubject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\"  Aurecchione v. Schoolman \nTransp. Sys., Inc., 426 F.3d 635, 638 (2d Cir. 2005).  \"In determining the existence of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, a district court may consider evidence outside the pleadings.\"  Saleh v. \nHolder, 84 F. Supp. 3d 135, 137-38 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Makarova, 201 F.3d at 113).  \n\"Subject matter jurisdiction is a threshold issue and, thus, when a party moves to dismiss \nunder both Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), the motion court must address the 12(b)(1) motion \nfirst.\"  Id. at 138 (citations omitted). \nThe Eleventh Amendment provides a limitation to district courts’ subject-matter \njurisdiction such that \"[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to \nextend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United \nStates by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"  U.S. \nCONST. amend. XI.  In other words, that Amendment \"generally bars suits in federal court by \nprivate individuals against non-consenting states.\"  Leitner v. Westchester Cmty. Coll., 779 \nF.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2015).  The Eleventh Amendment’s sovereign immunity extends not \nonly to cases where the state itself is a named party, but also to cases where an action is \nagainst certain state agents or instrumentalities.  Leitner, 779 F.3d at 134.   \nCongress may nevertheless abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity \nunder § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Garcia v. SUNY Health Scis. Ctr., 280 F.3d 98, 108 \n(2d Cir. 2001).  It may only do so, however, if the statute abrogating immunity seeks to:  \n(1) prevent a State from depriving \"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law\"; (2) prevent a State from denying any person \"equal protection of the laws\"; or (3) to \n8 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 9 of 22\nremedy or deter a State's conduct that violates those substantive guarantees, so long as \nthere is \"congruence and proportionality between the violation to be prevented or remedied \nand the means adopted to that end.\"  Id. (cleaned up). \nAlternatively, a state may waive its right to Eleventh Amendment immunity.  In re \nCharter Oak Assocs., 361 F.3d 760, 765 (2d Cir. 2004).  A State's decision to waive its \nimmunity is \"altogether voluntary” on the part of the state.  Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 675 (1999).  Therefore, under the \n\"stringent\" test for finding waiver, a State must either voluntarily invoke the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts or else make a \"clear declaration\" that it intends to submit itself to that \njurisdiction.  Id. at 675-76. \nB. Failure to State a Claim. \n\"To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the '[f]actual allegations must be enough \nto raise a right to relief above the speculative level.'\"  Ginsburg v. City of Ithaca, 839 F. Supp. \n2d 537, 540 (N.D.N.Y. 2012) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  \nInstead, the complaint must contain sufficient factual matter that it presents a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).   \nIn assessing the plausibility of the plaintiff's complaint, \"the complaint is to be \nconstrued liberally, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\"  \nGinsburg, 839 F. Supp. 2d at 540.  The complaint may be supported by \"any written \ninstrument attached to it as an exhibit, materials incorporated in it by reference, and \ndocuments that, although not incorporated by reference, are 'integral' to the complaint.\"  L-7 \nDesigns, Inc. v. Old Navy, LLC, 647 F.3d 419, 422 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing Sira v. Morton, 380 \nF.3d 57, 67 (2d Cir. 2004)). \n  DISCUSSION \n9 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 10 of 22\nGoodall asserts two claims:  (1) a claim under § 1983 for denial of his rights to equal \nprotection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United \nStates; and (2) a claim under Title II of the ADA for denial of access to public services. \nA. Plaintiff's § 1983 Claims. \nDefendants argue for the dismissal of Goodall's § 1983 claims on two grounds:  (1) the \nEleventh Amendment provides DOCCS, as an arm of the State of New York, with sovereign \nimmunity; and (2) plaintiff failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted. \n1.  Sovereign Immunity. \nIt is undisputed that \"Congress, in passing § 1983, had no intention to disturb the \nStates' Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"  Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 \n(1989).  Moreover, New York has not waived its sovereign immunity for § 1983 claims.  See \nJones v. N.Y. Div. of Military & Naval Affairs, 166 F.3d 45, 49 (2d Cir. 1999).  Of course, \n\"[t]here can be no dispute that DOCCS is an agency and arm of the State of New York and, \ntherefore, entitled to New York's Eleventh Amendment immunity.\"  Czerwinski v. N.Y. State \nDep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 394 F. Supp. 3d 210, 227 (N.D.N.Y. 2019).  Claims for \nmoney damages against state officials in their official capacity are similarly barred by the \nEleventh Amendment.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 167-68 (1985). \nBy extension, Goodall's § 1983 claims must be dismissed to the extent that he asserts \nthem against DOCCS or any defendant in his or her official capacity.  However, the Eleventh \nAmendment has no bearing on his § 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their \nindividual capacities.  See, e.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 31 (1991) (holding that state \nofficials may be sued in their individual capacities under § 1983). \n2.  Adequacy of Plaintiff's Pleadings. \n10 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 11 of 22\nA plaintiff lodging an equal protection claim must demonstrate both:  (1) adverse \ntreatment as compared to similarly situated individuals; and (2) \"that such selective treatment \nwas based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish \nthe exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\"  Miner \nv. Clinton Cty., 541 F.3d 464, 474 (2d Cir. 2008) (cleaned up).  Even if a plaintiff establishes \nselective treatment, however, he must also show that that treatment cannot survive the \napplicable level of scrutiny.  Phillips v. Girdich, 408 F.3d 124, 129 (2d Cir. 2005).   \nIn turn, the appropriate level of scrutiny hinges on whether a plaintiff can establish he \nwas a member of a suspect class, a quasi-suspect class, or no class at all.  See Mass. Bd. of \nRetirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 312 (1976) (noting that if action \"interferes with the \nexercise of a fundamental right\" or disadvantages a \"suspect class\" strict scrutiny applies); \nAdkins v. City of New York, 143 F. Supp. 3d 134, 138-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (applying \nintermediate scrutiny to a \"quasi-suspect class\"); see also Spavone v. N.Y. State Dep't of \nCorr. Servs., 719 F.3d 127, 136 (2d Cir. 2013) (applying rational basis review where plaintiff \nis not member of protected class).  Being disabled or perceived as disabled does not place a \nperson in either a suspect or a quasi-suspect class.  Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 \nU.S. 356, 366-68 (2001).  As such, Goodall's claim must survive rational basis review to grant \nhim relief.  See id. \nRational basis review protects from constitutional censure any decision by a State \nwhich acts on the basis of a group's \"distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the \nState has the authority to implement[.]\"  Garrett, 531 U.S. at 366-67 (internal citations \nomitted).  In other words, a State's classification of a group of people \"cannot run afoul of the \n[e]qual [p]rotection [c]lause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of \ntreatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\"  Id. (citing Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. \n11 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 12 of 22\n312, 320 (1993)).  The plaintiff bears the pronounced burden to negative \"any reasonably \nconceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\"  Heller, \n509 U.S. at 320 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \nAlternatively, a plaintiff can also bring an equal protection claim on the basis that a \ngovernment action is treating him, as an individual, unfairly.  Fortress Bible Church v. Feiner, \n694 F.3d 208, 221 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis added) (citing Vill. of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 \nU.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam)).  These claims are commonly referred to as \"class-of-one\" \nclaims.  Feiner, 694 F.3d at 221.  If a plaintiff can establish himself as a class of one, he can \nclaim a violation of his equal protection rights based on arbitrary, disparate treatment to him \nspecifically.  NRP Holdings LLC v. City of Buffalo, 916 F.3d 177, 198 (2d Cir. 2019). \nBut to put that cart behind a proper horse, a plaintiff must first prove that:  (1) no \nrational person would view his circumstances as different from a comparator's to a degree \nthat his differential treatment would be justified based on a legitimate government policy; and \n(2) the circumstances between the plaintiff and this comparator are so similar, and the \ntreatment so different, that there is no possibility that the disparate treatment was a mistake.  \nNRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  \"[T]he standard for determining whether another person's \ncircumstances are similar to the plaintiff's [is] whether they are prima facie identical.\"  Terrill v. \nWindham-Ashland-Jewett Cent. Sch. Dist., 176 F. Supp. 3d 101, 110 (N.D.N.Y. 2016). \nAs an initial matter, some misconceptions must be cleared up as to how both parties \nhave postured their arguments on defendants' motion.  Defendants argue that because \nGoodall does not allege that he is a member of a class subject to heightened scrutiny, he \nmust bring a class-of-one claim.  For plaintiff's part, he argues that a class-of-one claim is \nsimply an interchangeable term for rational basis review. \n12 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 13 of 22\nNeither party completely grasps the state of the law.  As the law recited above \nabundantly demonstrates, class-of-one claims are a distinct breed of equal protection claims, \nsubject to their own unique analysis.  Goodall is thus wrong to lump it together with rational \nbasis review, even though rational basis review is part of the class-of-one analysis.  Martine’s \nServ. Ctr., Inc. v. Town of Wallkill, 554 F. App’x 32, 35-36 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order) \n(“To state a class-of-one equal protection claim the plaintiff must allege that he has been \nintentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis \nfor the difference in treatment.” (cleaned up)).  But defendants are not blameless, either.   \nThey rely on Long v. Annucci, 2018 WL 6982086, at *6 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 16, 2018) for the \nproposition that a plaintiff claiming an equal protection violation based on disability must bring \na class-of-one claim.  Long, in turn, relied on Kaiser v. Highland Cent. Sch. Dist., 2008 WL \n5157450, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2008), which cited Price v. City of New York, 264 F. App'x \n66, 68 (2d Cir. 2008), for the same principle.   \nHowever, Price did not consider an equal protection claim rooted in disability writ \nlarge; it dealt with an archetypal class-of-one claim in which the plaintiff alleged that he was \ntreated differently than other similarly situated people who were injured in the course of their \nemployment.   264 F. App'x at 68.  By extension, Price never held or suggested that disabled \npersons must bring class-of-one claims.  Id.  Nor could it, considering that Garrett, the \nSupreme Court case that first held that disabled persons do not occupy a protected or \nquasi-suspect class, used generic rational basis review to analyze the claim presented and \nnever considered the existence of comparators—the hallmark of class of one analysis.  531 \nU.S. at 366-67.  By extension, the simple fact that disabled persons are not a protected class \ndoes not automatically require a disabled plaintiff to plead a class-of-one claim. \n13 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 14 of 22\nThus, each party's contention that there is only one flavor of claim available to Goodall \nis incorrect.  The question now must be whether he has cognizably alleged either claim.  As \nan initial matter, it is clear that plaintiff cannot state a class-of-one claim.  Such a claim would \nrequire that he, specifically, was denied SIP or CASAT for entirely arbitrary and personal \nreasons.  He would need to allege that there were other inmates who were permitted to enter \neither SIP or CASAT despite being so similar to him that no reasonable person would believe \nthat their admission would be owed to legitimate policy.  NRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  He \ncannot. \nAfter all, he can hardly dispute that his denial from participation in SIP and CASAT \nwas attributable to a policy duly enacted by DOCCS.  The two categories of inmates he \nidentifies as having been treated differently—those who are not disabled and those judicially \nordered into SIP—are both sufficiently different from his own circumstances so as to be \nattributable to the DOCCS policy of only admitting inmates into CASAT if they were \ncourt-ordered into SIP—rather than a target on his back.  NRP Holdings, 916 F.3d at 198.  If, \nfor example, plaintiff had been ordered into SIP and been denied entry into CASAT, he could \nbring a plausible class-of-one claim, but that is not his case.  Alternatively, if he could identify \ncomparators who were disabled and placed in CASAT despite not being judicially ordered \ninto it, that also would allow for a cognizable class-of-one claim.  But that, too, is not his case, \nand thus to whatever extent plaintiff alleges a class-of-one claim, his claim must be \ndismissed. \nHowever, that does not answer whether Goodall has stated an equal protection claim \nas a member of the class of disabled people.  Construing the complaint liberally, plaintiff has \npled that disabled people are denied the opportunity to volunteer for early release through an \nintensive rehabilitative program aimed at alcohol treatment and therapy.  AC ¶ 82.  Plaintiff \n14 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 15 of 22\nalso alleges that there is no rational basis for having a readily available alternative to SIP but \nwalling that alternative off unless an inmate is ordered into it.  Id.   \nMoreover, looking at the complaint as alleged, Goodall has taken sufficient steps to \nnegative any potential rational basis for limiting CASAT to those inmates who are ordered \ninto SIP when the physically able have the ability to simply volunteer for the latter program.  \nAlthough it is plaintiff's burden to do so, the Court can bring no rational basis to mind, and \ndefendants' arguments in their motion to dismiss are less than persuasive.  It is doubtful that \nDOCCS saves much in the way of funding or public resources by keeping disabled inmates \nincarcerated for longer periods when CASAT already exists to offer them rehabilitative \nmeasures that result in less time and money spent feeding and housing them.   \nNor is it clear what defendants mean when they offer \"trying to preserve the uniformity \nand serve the underlying purpose of the normal shock regimen\" as a governmental interest.  \nCASAT already deviates from the normal SIP program in terms of its physical rigor, and \nlimiting CASAT participants to inmates who otherwise qualify for SIP but are physically \nincapable of participating in the exercise regimen would not appreciably change the status \nquo.   \nOf course, Goodall's burden of proving that there is no conceivable rational basis for \nthe individual defendants' alleged policy of not admitting disabled persons into CASAT if they \nare not ordered into SIP will be enormously difficult to carry forward.  Nevertheless, at this \nearly stage, plaintiff's claim cannot be so lightly dismissed.  Accordingly, defendants' motion \nto dismiss plaintiff's § 1983 claims against the individual defendants must be denied.5 \nB. Plaintiff's ADA Claims. \n                                            \n5 The Court need not reach the question of whether plaintiff has adequately alleged personal involvement by \neach defendant at this juncture, because defendants did not move to dismiss plaintiff's complaint on that ground. \n15 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 16 of 22\nDefendants offer two familiar arguments in favor of dismissing Goodall's ADA claims:  \n(1) Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity; and (2) failure to state a claim for which relief \ncan be granted. \n1.  Sovereign Immunity. \nIn enacting the ADA, Congress unequivocally abrogated the States' Eleventh \nAmendment immunity.  42 U.S.C. § 12202.  However, as discussed above, Congress's \nauthority to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity is necessarily cabined to deprivations \nand violations of the Fourteenth Amendment where the abrogation is congruent and \nproportional to the violation.  Garcia, 280 F.3d at 108; see United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. \n151, 158-59 (2006) (discussing whether and to what extent the ADA abrogates Eleventh \nAmendment immunity). \nIn Georgia, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of the ADA's \nabrogation of sovereign immunity.  546 U.S. at 158-59.  Ultimately, the Georgia court found \nthat the abrogation was constitutional as long as the particular claim that a plaintiff brings \nseeks damages for a State's conduct that \"actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Id. \nat 159.  Thus, courts must analyze on a claim-by-claim basis:  \"(1) which aspects of the \nState's alleged conduct violated Title II [of the ADA]; (2) to what extent such misconduct also \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct violated Title II but \ndid not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,\" whether the purported abrogation of sovereign \nimmunity is nevertheless valid.  Id. \nThe Georgia question in this case could not be much more straightforward.  Goodall's \namended complaint alleges that the same policy of limiting CASAT to disabled persons who \nwere ordered into it \"simultaneously\" denied plaintiff equal protection under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and violated Title II of the ADA.  AC ¶ 84.  Moreover, as discussed above, \n16 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 17 of 22\nplaintiff has plausibly alleged that that policy did, in fact, violate his Fourteenth Amendment \nright to equal protection under the law.  There is thus perfect overlap between defendants' \nconduct for plaintiff's § 1983 and ADA claims, and that conduct plausibly violated the \nFourteenth Amendment.  Therefore, New York's Eleventh Amendment immunity has been \nconstitutionally abrogated for the purposes of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, and defendants' motion \nto dismiss plaintiff's ADA claim on the basis of sovereign immunity must be denied. \n2.  Adequacy of Plaintiff's Pleadings. \nTo state a claim for denial of access to public services under Title II of the ADA, a \nplaintiff must show that:  (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) defendants are an \nentity subject to the ADA; and (3) plaintiff was denied the opportunity to participate in or \nbenefit from services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by \nreason of disability.  Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003).  \nAdditionally, a plaintiff must have actually requested an accommodation, although that \nrequirement is unnecessary if the disability is obvious or known to the defendant.  Brady v. \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 531 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir. 2008).  \nA qualified person with a disability is a disabled person who, \"with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions\" of the program in which \nthey hope to participate.  42 U.S.C. § 12111(8).  Additionally, to be a qualified individual, the \nplaintiff must meet every essential eligibility requirement of the program he seeks to enter.  \nMary Jo C. v. N.Y. State and Local Ret. Sys., 707 F.3d 144, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2013).  A plaintiff \nis disabled within the meaning of the ADA if he:  (1) suffers from a physical or mental \nimpairment; and (2) that impairment substantially limits a major life activity upon which the \nplaintiff relies.  See Potter v. Xerox Corp., 1 F. App'x 34, 37 (2d Cir. 2001) (summary order).   \n17 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 18 of 22\nBy the language of the ADA itself, discrimination includes \"not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability who is an applicant . . . .\"  42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A).  A failure to \naccommodate can only be excused if a defendant \"can demonstrate that the accommodation \nwould impose an undue hardship\" on its operations.  Id. \nTo the extent that defendants argue that Goodall's ADA claims against the individual \ndefendants in their personal capacities must be dismissed, they are correct.  Although the \nSecond Circuit has not expressly ruled that there is no available remedy under the ADA \nagainst individual defendants, the district courts of this circuit—including this one—have \noverwhelmingly done so.  See, e.g., Frantti v. N.Y., 2017 WL 922062, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, \n2017); Dominelli v. N. Country Acad., 2016 WL 616375, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 16, 2016); \nSherman v. Cty. of Suffolk, 71 F. Supp. 3d 332, 343 (E.D.N.Y. 2014).  There is no apparent \nreason to deviate from that precedent, and Goodall supplies none.  Thus, plaintiff's ADA \nclaims against the individual defendants must be dismissed. \nAs for Goodall's ADA claim against DOCCS, it is beyond dispute that DOCCS is an \nentity subject to the ADA.  Wright v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016).  \nNeither do defendants dispute that plaintiff is disabled within the meaning of the ADA, given \nhis several allegations of medical conditions that substantially limit major life activities.  AC \n¶ 30; Potter, 1 F. App'x at 37.  Additionally, plaintiff has demonstrated several times over that \nhe requested accommodation.  See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 43, 52.  Accordingly, the only questions left \nare whether Goodall:  (1) was qualified for SIP and/or CASAT; and (2) was denied access to \na program or was otherwise discriminated against on the basis of his disability. \nAs to the first question, defendants cite Doe v. Goord and Dimperio v. N.Y. Dep't of \nCorr. & Cmty. Supervision, two cases that allegedly support the proposition that Goodall is \n18 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 19 of 22\nnot qualified for SIP or CASAT.  Defendants' citation to Doe, 2005 WL 3116413, at *1-5, \n18-19 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2005) is inapposite for two reasons.  First, the Doe court found its \nplaintiff unqualified for CASAT on summary judgment, not on a motion to dismiss, and the \ndifference in standards gives pause.  Id.  Second, the Doe plaintiff was a violent felon and, as \na result, unqualified for SIP or CASAT regardless of disability, unlike plaintiff.  Id.   \nThough much more persuasive, defendants' citation to Dimperio, 2015 WL 1383831, \nat *6-7 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2015) is also inapt.  In Dimperio, this Court adopted a report and \nrecommendation to the effect that, because plaintiff was not ordered into SIP, he was not \nqualified for CASAT as a matter of law.  Id.  The Second Circuit affirmed, but did so on the \nbasis that DOCCS could not be obligated to create an alternative to SIP where none existed.6  \nDimperio v. N.Y. State Dep't of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, 653 F. App'x 52, 54 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(summary order). \nHowever, the plaintiff in Dimperio was exclusively seeking entry into CASAT, or else \nthe creation of an alternative program.  2015 WL 1383831, at *6-7; 653 F. App'x at 54.  As \nGoodall correctly notes, he is not challenging that he was denied entry into CASAT or SIP.  \nNor is he calling for a new alternative to be created.  Instead, he is challenging DOCCS' \npolicy of only permitting inmates into CASAT by court order.  In other words, plaintiff is \nalleging that the court order requirement that defendants now rely on to dismiss his claim is \nitself a discriminatory act under the ADA.  \nSome explanation may be necessary.  A judicial order is not required to enter SIP. But \nSIP is not available for the physically disabled.  CASAT exists as an alternative to SIP.  But \ndisabled people can only reach CASAT by judicial order.  These four truths are undisputed.  \nTogether, however, they mean that disabled inmates face a barrier to a rehabilitative \n                                            \n6 Curiously, the Second Circuit's opinion made no mention whatsoever of CASAT.  See generally Dimperio, 653 \nF. App'x at 54. \n19 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 20 of 22\nearly-release program that physically able inmates do not.  Disabled inmates—and only \ndisabled inmates—cannot volunteer for an existing rehabilitative program, even though able \ninmates may volunteer for their corresponding program.   \nDimperio is thus a poor fit because the Second Circuit's concern with ordering the \nstate to create a new program is not the solution to Goodall's concern, all that is required is \nthat disabled inmates be given the same opportunity to volunteer for their existing program.  \n653 F. App'x at 54.  Similarly, the Dimperio District Court's ruling that its plaintiff could not \nrecover because he was not qualified for CASAT is inapplicable here because plaintiff alleges \nthat exact qualification is itself discriminatory, which that plaintiff did not.  2015 WL 1383831, \nat *6-7.   \nAssuming Goodall is correct, which this Court must on a motion to dismiss, invalidating \nhis claim based on a discriminatory qualification would destroy the purpose of an ADA claim, \nbecause ADA defendants could simply create qualifications that apply only to disabled \npeople.  A discriminatory qualification broad enough to cover the entire swath of the disabled \nwould mean that no disabled person would be qualified for the program, and thus there could \nbe no qualified disabled person capable of bringing an ADA claim.  Thus, DOCCS' policy of \nrequiring disabled inmates to be ordered into CASAT cannot render plaintiff unqualified. \nAll told, were Goodall not disabled he would be qualified for SIP, and the additional \nqualification requiring a court order for CASAT applies to him only because of his disabilities.  \nMoreover, plaintiff has adequately alleged that he meets every criteria for entry into CASAT \nand SIP other than those that he specifically objects to as discriminatory.  Therefore, plaintiff \nhas adequately alleged that he is a qualified, eligible person with a disability. \nFinally, precisely because Goodall only faces impediments to participating in the two \nexisting early release programs because of his physical and mental disabilities, it cannot be \n20 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 21 of 22\ndoubted that he was denied access to those programs because he was disabled.  As a result, \nplaintiff has adequately pled every element of a Title II ADA claim.  Defendants' motion to \ndismiss his ADA claim against DOCCS must therefore be denied. \n  CONCLUSION \nUltimately, the question at stake in this case is whether depriving disabled inmates, \nincluding Goodall, of the ability to volunteer for CASAT in the same manner that physically \nable inmates can volunteer for SIP, violated plaintiff's rights under § 1983 and the ADA.  The \nquestion poses a bit of a thicket, because it involves not one program, or even two, but rather \nthe intersectionality of SIP and CASAT.  At this juncture, plaintiff has plausibly alleged that \nDOCCS and the individual defendants run those two programs together in a manner that \nviolates his rights to equal protection and under the ADA.  His complaint must therefore \nsurvive defendants' motion to dismiss. \nTherefore, it is \nORDERED THAT \n1.  Defendants' Dkt. 87 motion to dismiss is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN \nPART; \n2.  Plaintiff's § 1983 claims against DOCCS and the individual defendants in their \nofficial capacities are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE; \n3.  Plaintiff's ADA claims against the individual defendants are DISMISSED WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE; \n4.  Plaintiff's Count I § 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their individual \ncapacities and Count II ADA claim against DOCCS may proceed; and \n5.  Defendants are directed to answer plaintiff's amended complaint no later than \nTuesday, April 14, 2020. \n21 \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 91   Filed 03/31/20   Page 22 of 22\n \n \n \n             \nDated:  March 31, 2020 \n    Utica, New York.  \n \n22 \n ",

INTRODUCTION  \nOn January 23, 2019, Shaun Goodall (“Goodall” or “plaintiff”), proceeding \npro se, filed this civil rights action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York.  Dkt. No. 1.  Broadly speaking, plaintiff’s complaint \nalleged that defendants New York State Department of Corrections and \nCommunity Supervision (“DOCCS”) and eleven DOCCS officials1 (collectively \n“defendants”) discriminated against him on the basis of his disability when \nthey denied his access to a “shock” treatment program at Greene Correctional \nFacility.  Id.  Along with his complaint, plaintiff also sought leave to proceed \nin forma pauperis (“IFP Application”).  Dkt. No. 2.   \nOn April 11, 2019, U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto granted Goodall’s \nIFP Application and directed him to show cause why this action should not be \n \n1  Individual defendants include Acting Commissioner Anthony Annucci, Assistant \nCommissioner Bryan Hilton, Superintendent Brandon Smith, Deputy Superintendent Marie \nHammond, Assistant Deputy Superintendent Laurie Fisher, Facility Health Services Director \nDoreen Smith, and Rehabilitation Coordinators L. Mardon, L. O’Hara, A. Cluever, M. Noriega, and \nWelytok.   \n \n- 2 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 3 of 49\ntransferred to the Northern District of New York.  Text Minute Entry for \n4/11/19.  Thereafter, plaintiff retained counsel, Dkt. No. 8, filed an amended \ncomplaint, Dkt. No. 9, perfected service, Dkt. No. 63, and then briefed the \nissue of transfer, Dkt. Nos. 70, 73.  Ultimately, Judge Matsumoto transferred \nthe action to this Court on November 5, 2019.  Dkt. No. 77.  \nOn December 6, 2019, defendants moved under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure (“Rule”) 12(b)(1) and (6) to dismiss Goodall’s amended complaint in \nits entirety.  Dkt. No. 87.  According to defendants, they were immune from \nmost of plaintiff’s claims.  Id.  To the extent they were not, they argued that \nplaintiff’s claims failed on the merits because he was ineligible for the “shock” \nprogram at issue.  Id.  That motion was fully briefed, Dkt. Nos. 89, 90, and \nthen granted in part and denied in part on March 21, 2020, Dkt. No. 91, and \ndefendants answered the remaining claims, Dkt. No. 92.  \nHowever, on September 30, 2020, Goodall moved under Rules 15(a) and \n16(b) to file a second amended complaint.  Dkt. No. 101.  Defendants did not \noppose.  Dkt. No. 102.  Accordingly, U.S. Magistrate Judge Christian F. \nHummel granted plaintiff’s motion to amend on June 21, 2021.  Dkt. No. 106.  \nGoodall’s three-count second amended complaint alleges that defendants \ndiscriminated against him by denying him participation in DOCCS’s Shock \nIncarceration Program (the “SIP”), or an equivalent program, in violation of: \n \n- 3 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 4 of 49\n(1) Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”); (2) Section 504 \nof the Rehabilitation Act (the “Rehabilitation Act”); and (3) his Fourteenth \nAmendment equal protection rights.  Dkt. No. 107.  Defendants answered, \nDkt. No. 109, and the parties completed two more years of discovery. \nOn April 30 and May 1, 2023, following the close of discovery, the parties \ncross-moved for summary judgment.  Dkt. Nos. 159, 161.  Goodall, for his \npart, moved for partial summary judgment on his ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims.  Dkt. No. 159.  Defendants, for their part, moved to dismiss the \nsecond amended complaint in its entirety.  Dkt. No. 161.   \nBoth motions have been fully briefed and will be considered on the basis of \nthe submissions without oral argument.2  \nII.  BACKGROUND \n  This factual narrative has been developed from the parties’ respective \nstatements of material facts.  Importantly, it is limited to those facts that are \nwell-supported by accurate citations to the record, and any attached \nexhibits.  Disputed facts have been flagged.  Because the parties have cross-\n \n  2  As part of his response in opposition, Goodall sought to strike certain portions of a declaration \nsubmitted by defendants.  Dkt. No. 175.  Thereafter, defendants sought to strike plaintiff’s reply \npapers.  Dkt. Nos. 183, 184, 185.   \n \n- 4 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 5 of 49\nmoved for summary judgment, these disputes are described from each party’s \npoint of view.   \nA.  Goodall’s Impairments  \nGoodall contends that he suffers from several physical and mental \nimpairments.  See Plaintiff’s Statement of Additional Material Facts (“Pl.’s \nAdd’l Facts”), Dkt. No. 175-2 ¶¶ 1–12; see also Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl., Dkt. \nNo. 161-4 at 120.3  First, plaintiff asserts that he suffers from a myoclonic \nseizure disorder that subjects him to involuntary muscle twitches, making \nhim unsteady in his movements and prone to falls during active episodes.  \nPl.’s Add’l Facts ¶¶ 1–2.  Second, plaintiff contends that he suffers from back \npain that makes it difficult for him to sleep, stand, lift, and sit for sustained \nperiods of time.  Id. ¶ 4.   \nThird, Goodall asserts that he was diagnosed with heart impairments, \nincluding tachycardia, hypertension, and heart disease.  Pl.’s Add’l Facts ¶ \n12; Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl. at 98–104, 126–28.  Plaintiff maintains that these \nconditions cause him to experience sharp chest pains or the feeling that he is \ngoing to faint when engaging in strenuous physical activity.  Pl.’s Add’l Facts \n¶ 5; Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl. 104–07, 126–28.  Fourth, plaintiff contends that \nhe has flat feet.  Pl.’s Add’l Facts ¶ 6.  Plaintiff asserts that his flat feet \n \n3  Pagination corresponds to CM/ECF header.   \n \n- 5 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 6 of 49\nimpact his balance and cause him excruciating pain, making it difficult for \nhim to run as fast and far as others.  Id.; Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl. at 124–26.   \nFifth, Goodall maintains that he suffers from a hiatal hernia and \ngastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD”).  See Plaintiff’s Statement of \nMaterial Facts (“Pl.’s Facts”), Dkt. No. 159-105 ¶¶ 7–8, 12, 14, 23–25; Ex. 2 to \nHamilton Decl. at 118.  Plaintiff asserts that his hiatal hernia and GERD \ncause him to experience extreme nausea.  Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl. at 118–123.  \nAnd sixth, Goodall contends that suffers from mental illness.  See Pl.’s Add’l \nFacts ¶¶ 7–11.  In particular, plaintiff asserts that he has an adjustment \ndisorder, a depressive disorder, and an antisocial personality disorder.  See \nid.; Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl. at 110–18.  According to plaintiff, these disorders \ncause him to experience depression and anxiety and engage in self-injurious \nbehaviors.  See Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl. at 112–18.   \nB.  Goodall’s Incarceration  \nOn July 24, 2015, Goodall was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term \nof three to six years after pleading guilty to the felony of robbery in the third \ndegree.  Pl.’s Facts ¶¶ 1–2; Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts (“Defs.’ \nFacts”), Dkt. No. 173-1 ¶ 1.  Plaintiff was initially received into DOCCS \ncustody at Ulster Correctional Facility (“Ulster”).  Pl.’s Facts ¶ 3.  But the \n \n- 6 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 7 of 49\nfollowing month, plaintiff was transferred to Greene Correctional Facility in \nCoxsackie, New York (“Greene”).  Id. ¶ 4.   \nOn October 23, 2015, Goodall signed a form declining to participate in the \nSIP; i.e., the shock incarceration program.4  Defs.’ Facts ¶ 6.  The SIP is a six-\nmonth, early release, discipline and treatment-oriented program provided to \nincarcerated individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements.  Pl.’s \nFacts ¶¶ 31–32, 39, 48–50; Ex. 56 to Schotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-57 at 5, 7, \n11.  According to plaintiff, he signed the declination form because he was \nineligible to participate in the program as a result of: (1) Ulster medical staff \nindicating in his medical records that he is “not a Shock candidate;” and (2) \nbeing classified as a medical service level of “two” and a mental health service \nlevel of “three.”5  See Defs.’ Facts ¶ 11; Pl.’s Resp. ¶ 11.  The form plaintiff \nsigned stated that he would not be reconsidered for the program unless he \n \n4  Goodall contends that he was not offered an opportunity to participate in the SIP, but “was \noffered an opportunity to be screened for consideration for SIP enrollment.”  Pl.’s Response to Defs.’ \nFacts (Pl.’s Resp.”), Dkt. No. 175-2 ¶ 6.  Nevertheless, plaintiff concedes that he declined the \nopportunity to be screened.  See id.  \n \n5  A medical service level of two indicates that an individual has “stable, non-life threatening \nconditions” and can be housed in a facility with physicians on site or on call twenty-four hours a day, \nand nursing staff during the day shift.  Pl.’s Facts ¶ 10.  A mental health service level of three \nindicates that an individual “[m]ay benefit from brief psychotherapy and psychiatric medication.”  Id. \n¶ 11.   \n \n- 7 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 8 of 49\ncontacted his Offender Rehabilitation Coordinator (“ORC”) directly.  Defs.’ \nFacts ¶ 7.   \nThroughout 2017, while incarcerated at Greene, Goodall submitted three \nseparate requests for a reasonable accommodation to participate in the SIP.  \nPl.’s Facts ¶ 99.  Plaintiff’s requests, the ultimate denials of his requests, and \nthe grievances he filed in response to the denials, are discussed infra.   \n1.  Goodall’s First Reasonable Accommodation Request \nOn February 19, 2017, Goodall submitted his first request for a reasonable \naccommodation to participate in the SIP.  Pl.’s Facts ¶¶ 101–02; Defs.’ Facts \n¶ 8.  On the request form, plaintiff asserted that he cannot perform intense \nphysical activity due to suffering from: a myocardial infarction; a serious \nmental disorder; multiple cardiac risk factors; hernias; GERD; heart disease; \nand flat feet.  Pl.’s Facts ¶ 103; Defs.’ Facts ¶ 8.   \nDefendant Laurie Fisher (“Fisher”), the Assistant Deputy Superintendent \nof Programs (“ADSP”) at Greene, received Goodall’s request form.  Pl.’s Facts \n¶ 104.  Fisher sent plaintiff’s request form to defendant Dr. Doreen Smith \n(“Dr. Smith”), the Facility Health Services Director of Greene, to conduct a \nmedical review of plaintiff’s request.  Id. ¶ 106.  Dr. Smith filled out the \nmedical verification section of the form and indicated that plaintiff has a \nseizure disorder and cannot engage in heavy lifting.  Id. ¶ 107.  Dr. Smith \n \n- 8 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 9 of 49\nreturned the form to the office of the Deputy Superintendent of Programs \n(“DSP”).  Id. ¶ 111.   \nOn March 17, 2017, Fisher denied Goodall’s first request.  Pl.’s Facts ¶ \n112; Defs.’ Facts ¶ 9.  In this denial, Fisher noted that admission to the SIP \n“is not a reasonable accommodation,” and admission to the program is “based \non screening performed by guidance unit and eligibility requirements.”  Pl.’s \nFacts ¶ 115; Defs.’ Facts ¶ 9.  As the basis for this finding, Fisher relied on \nDr. Smith’s opinion that plaintiff’s medical conditions rendered him incapable \nof successfully participating in the program.  Pl.’s Facts ¶¶ 113, 119.  \nOn March 20, 2017, Goodall grieved the denial of his first request to \nparticipate in the SIP by submitting an Inmate Grievance Complaint (“IGC”), \nassigned #GNE 9243-17.  Pl.’s Facts ¶ 162; Defs.’ Facts ¶ 10.  In this first \nIGC, plaintiff asserted that the denial of his request was improper and in \nviolation of the ADA.  Pl.’s Facts ¶ 162; Defs.’ Facts ¶ 10.  Plaintiff also \nrequested to be permitted entry into the SIP “or its alternative.”  Ex. 64 to \nSchotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-65 at 2. \nOn March 21, 2017, Goodall wrote a letter to his assigned ORC; his \nassigned rehabilitation coordinator, defendant Welytok.  Defs.’ Facts ¶ 11.  In \nthis letter, plaintiff stated that his request to participate in the SIP was \ndenied because there are no accommodations for prisoners who are not court-\n \n- 9 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 10 of 49\nordered into the program.  Ex. 11 to Compl., Dkt. No. 107 at 48.  Plaintiff also \nasserted that he initially signed the form declining to participate in the SIP \nscreening process because he was ineligible to participate.  See Defs.’ Facts ¶ \n11; Pl.’s Resp. ¶ 11.  Plaintiff noted that the form notified him that he would \nnot be considered for the program unless he informed his ORC directly.  Ex. \n11 to Compl., Dkt. No. 107 at 48.  Finally, plaintiff’s letter to Welytok \nasserted that he was asking to be considered for participation in the SIP or \n“the alternative program.”  Id. \nOn March 28, 2017, Acting Supervising Rehabilitation Coordinator \n(“SORC”) Dugon (“Dugon”) sent a memorandum to Fisher regarding Goodall’s \ngrievance #GNE 9243-17.  Pl.’s Facts ¶ 163; Ex. 66 to Schotter Decl., Dkt. No. \n159-67 at 2.  In this memorandum, Dugon asserted that: \n[P]er Directive #0086, inmates are only eligible for the \nShock program if they meet eligibility requirements \ndue to the physical intensity of Shock.  Alternative \nShock  is  only  available  to  inmates  who  are  court-\nordered  Shock  and  do  not  meet  the  eligibility \nrequirements.    Since  Inmate  Goodall  is  not  court-\nordered Shock, Grievance is denied.  \n \nEx. 66 to Schotter Decl. at 2.  Fisher reviewed and approved this memo on \nMarch 30, 2017.  Id.  \nOn April 13, 2017, Dugon sent a memorandum to defendant Hammond, \nthe Deputy Superintendent, about Goodall’s grievance #GNE 9243-17.  Pl.’s \n \n- 10 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 11 of 49\nAdd’l Facts ¶¶ 27–28; Ex. 17 to Caturano Decl, Dkt. No. 175-20 at 2.  Dugon \nstated in this memorandum that:  \nInmate Goodall met with SORC Mardon to review his \ndenial  for  a  Reasonable  Accommodation  in  March.  \nWhen he wrote to ORC Welytok, who was no longer his \ncounselor, the letter was forwarded to his new ORC, \nMs. Noriega.  When Ms. Noriega received the letter, \nshe brought it to SORC Mardon.  As Ms. Mardon was \naware of the situation (i.e. she reviewed the denial \nwith him and knew the situation was in the grievance \nstage), she knew the question was asked and answered \nby Program Services and no further action was needed \nas it was being handled by the Grievance Department.  \nAs stated to Inmate Goodall during his Reasonable \nAccommodation  denial  review  as  well  as  the  other \nresponse  to  this  grievance,  Inmate  Goodall  is  not \neligible to participate in Alternative Shock.   \n \nEx. 17 to Caturano Decl. at 2.  Fisher reviewed and approved this memo on \nApril 14, 2017.  Id.  \nOn April 24, 2017, Greene Superintendent, defendant Brandon Smith \n(“Superintendent Smith”), denied Goodall’s grievance #GNE 9243-17.  Pl.’s \nFacts ¶ 164; Ex. 67 to Schotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-68 at 2.  In this denial, \nSuperintendent Smith stated that: \nThe  investigation  provided  indicates  the  grievant       \ndeclined participation in SHOCK on 10/23/15.  [Fisher] \nnoted on the RA request that a request for SHOCK is \nnot a reasonable accommodation.  Shock admission is \nbased on screening performed by Grievance Unit and \neligibility  requirements.

Ex. 67 \nto Schotter Decl. at 2.  In this appeal, plaintiff stated that when he initially \ndeclined participation in the SIP: he did so in order to avoid injury per advice \nfrom the medical department; DOCCS medical staff had previously stated \nthat he was not a Shock candidate; he was not eligible to participate in the \nSIP due to his medical and mental health service level classifications; and no \nreasonable accommodation to the SIP was offered as an alternative.  Id.; see \nalso Pl.’s Facts ¶¶ 9–11; Defs.’ Facts ¶ 13.   \nOn May 23, 2017, Fisher sent Goodall a letter notifying him that he was \nineligible for participation in the SIP Alternative Program.  Defs.’ Facts ¶ 14.  \nFisher asserted in the letter that plaintiff was ineligible because he refused \nparticipation in the SIP in 2015 and the alternative program is only available \nto inmates who are court-ordered to participate in the SIP.  Ex. 14 to Compl., \nDkt.

Pl.’s Facts ¶ 165.  In confirming the denial of Goodall’s grievance, the \nCORC asserted that: \n[T]he Shock Incarceration Program is a privilege, not \na  right,  and  that  an  inmate  must  meet  all  of  the \nrequirements in order to be considered eligible for the \nprogram.  It is  noted that the grievant voluntarily \nrefused participation in Shock on 10/23/15, and that he \nwas subsequently screened and found to be ineligible \nfor  participation  for  medical  reasons  on  10/13/17.  \nCORC further notes that there is no court order for \nhim  to  be  enrolled  in  Shock,  and  that  there  is  no \nrequirement  in  Directive  #0086  to  afford  him \nalternative placement. \n \nId.   \n2.  Goodall’s Second Reasonable Accommodation Request \nOn July 20, 2017, Goodall submitted his second request for a reasonable \naccommodation to participate in the SIP.  Pl.’s Facts ¶¶ 120–21; Defs.’ Facts \n¶ 18.  In his request, plaintiff asserted that he was limited in his ability to \nengage in rigorous activity due to suffering from: epilepsy; heart disease; \nGERD; flat feet; hernias; and hypertension.  Pl.’s Facts ¶ 122; Defs.’ Facts ¶ \n18.

Pl.’s Facts ¶ 166; Ex. 69 to Schotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-70 at 2–3.  \nIn this second IGC, plaintiff asserted that the decision to deny him admission \nto the SIP violated the ADA and his right to be free from discrimination on \nthe basis of a disability.  Ex. 69 to Schotter Decl. at 3.  Plaintiff’s second \ngrievance also requested to be enrolled into the SIP “with a change in \nenvironment, policies or procedures, or the manner in which tasks are \ncompleted that enables me, with my disability, to participate in SHOCK or be \nprovided the alternative program.”  Id.      \nOn August 31, 2017, defendant L.

Pl.’s Facts ¶ 168; Ex. 71 to \nSchotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-72 at 2.  In their response, the IGRC stated that:  \nCommittee  notes  that  grievant  has  filed  previous \ncomplaints in this matter which are already pending \nCORC.  It was determined grievant was unsuitable for \nSHOCK  participation.    It  is  not  expected  that  any \nfurther action will be taken based on the submission \nof  additional  complaints  regarding  the  same  issue.  \nCommittee agrees that DOCCS should have a medical \nalternative to SHOCK even if this requires changes to \nstate statutes.  \n \nEx. 71 to Schotter Decl. at 2.   \nOn October 13, 2017, a screening form, reflecting Goodall’s suitability for \nparticipation in the SIP, was completed.

In his \ndenial, Superintendent Smith asserted that: \nGrievant’s  request  for  reasonable  accommodations \nwas denied on 8/14/17 by [Fisher].  SHOCK eligibility \ncannot be determined or granted through a reasonable \naccommodation.  Per Central Office direction grievant \nwas  subsequently  rescreened  for  SHOCK.    It  was \ndetermined on 10/13/17 that grievant was medically \nunsuitable  for  SHOCK.    Although  grievant  was \nscreened  for  participation  in  SHOCK  this  was  not \ncourt ordered at sentencing.  It was recommended.  \nParticipation in SHOCK alternative is only possible \nwhen SHOCK is court ordered.  \n \nEx. 76 to Schotter Decl. at 2.  \n  On February 6, 2019, the CORC upheld the denial of #GNE 9507-17.

In asserting that \nthe matter of #GNE 9507-17 is closed, the CORC asserted that: \nUpon full hearing of the facts and circumstances in the \ninstant case, the grievant’s action requested in hereby \ndenied, as CORC considers the issue moot.   \n \nCORC notes that Directive #4040, § 701.3 requires \nthat “An inmate must be personally affected by the \npolicy or issue he or she is grieving, or must show that \nhe or she will be personally affected by that policy or \nissue unless some relief is granted or changes made.” \n \n- 17 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 18 of 49\n \nCORC  notes  that  the  grievant  was  Conditionally \nReleased to Community Supervision on 12/26/18.

Plaintiff altered the memorandum by handwriting that \nhe was ineligible to participate in the SIP without an accommodation because \nthe medical department determined that he is “not a SHOCK candidate,” and \nDr. Smith “stated in a 7/24/17 Reasonable Accommodation application that \n‘medical regimen precludes shock.’”  Defs.’ Facts ¶ 26; Ex. 63 to Schotter Decl. \nat 2.   \nOn October 19, 2017, Hammond marked Goodall’s third request as being \nreceived.

In this third IGC, \nplaintiff asserted that:   \nOn  10/27/17  I  received  a  response  from  the  FOIL \nOfficer at Greene Correctional Facility, indicating: “In \nresponse  to  your  letter,  the  Reasonable \nAccommodation  form  from  9/29/17  has  not  been \nreceived completed yet.”  On 10/24/17 I again received \ncorrespondence  from  the  FOIL  Officer  stating:  “In \nregards to the completed Reasonable Accommodation, \nthere has been no indication by staff as to when this \nwill  be  complete.”    Due  to  the  undue  delay  and/or \nrefusal to render a decision and no indication as to \nwhen this will be complete, I’m hereby treating these \nactions as a denial . . . . \n \nPresently, DOCCS offers no possibility of a Reasonable \nAccommodation  for  prisoners  who  are  not  court-\nordered to SHOCK – such as mental health treatment \nor a physical disability – to allow participation into the \nprogram.  This decision to deny me admission and a \nReasonable Accommodation twice previously and now \nviolates my rights to be free from discrimination on the \nbasis of a disability and violates my rights under the \nAmericans with Disability Act, Title II.   \n \nEx. 78 to Schotter Decl. at 2–3.  The action plaintiff requested was “to be \npermitted entry into the SHOCK program or its alternative so that I may \nbenefit the same as an individual without a disability, complete the SHOCK \n \n8  #GNE 9608-17 also concerned Goodall being disqualified from participation in the SIP due to \nbeing deemed “medically unsuitable” on October 13, 2017.

Pl.’s Facts ¶ 174.  In this memorandum, Fisher wrote:  \nThis grievance should be denied as Inmate Goodall did \nnot agree to participate in the program as presented.  \nHe  would  ONLY  participate  if  he  was  given  a \nReasonable Accommodation.  This grievance should \nalso  be  denied  based  on  inmate  not  meeting  the \nqualifications described in the SHOCK manual under \nCorrections  Law  §  865  and  867  including  that  all \nparticipates are bound by the terms and conditions \nand  are  required  to  participate  in  daily  P.T.  and \nrigorous physical activity.   \n \nEx. 79 to Schotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-80 at 2.  Fisher reviewed and approved \nthis memo on November 8, 2017.  Id.  \nOn December 19, 2017, Hammond denied Goodall’s third request.  Defs.’ \nFacts ¶ 27.  As explanation for the denial, Hammond asserted that “Shock \nrequires the participant to engage in physical exercise and drills.  Inmate \ndoes not qualify for exemption from this requirement.”  Id.  \nOn December 20, 2017, Superintendent Smith responded to grievance \n#GNE 9608-17.  See Ex. 80 to Schotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-81 at 2.  \nSuperintendent Smith asserted that: \nAlthough grievant was screened for participation in \nSHOCK this was not court ordered at sentencing.  It \n \n- 21 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 22 of 49\nwas  recommended.    Participation  in  SHOCK \nalternative  is  only  possible  when  SHOCK  is  court \nordered. \n \nAlthough this would not have changed the outcome it \nis  acknowledged  that  the  grievant’s  request  for \nreasonable  accommodations  was  not  handled  in  a \ntimely fashion.  The timely handling of these is being \naddressed by facility administration.  \n \nId.  However, Superintendent Smith affirmed grievance #GNE 9608-17 “only \nto the extent that the [Reasonable Accommodation] request was not handled \nin a timely fashion.”  Id.   \n  On December 23, 2017, Goodall appealed Superintendent Smith’s \nresponse to grievance #GNE 9608-17.  See Ex. 80 to Schotter Decl. at 2.  As \njustification for his appeal, plaintiff asserted that “disability discrimination is \nevident in that prisoners who volunteer for the SHOCK program while \neligible are permitted to participate.  Meanwhile, prisoners who volunteer \nbut have a disability are excluded participation/benefits.  A clear violation of \nthe ADA, Title II.”  Id.   \nOn April 10, 2019, the CORC denied grievance #GNE 9608-17.  See Ex. 81 \nto Schotter Decl., Dkt. No. 159-82 at 2.  In the denial, the CORC stated that:  \n[T]he  grievant’s  concerns  regarding  the  Shock \nIncarceration  Program  were  addressed  in  its  prior \ndecisions  GNE-9243-17  and  GNE-9507-17,  dated \n7/5/18 and 2/6/19, respectively.  CORC again asserts \nthat the Shock Incarceration Program is a privilege, \n \n- 22 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 23 of 49\nnot a right, and that an inmate must meet all of the \nrequirements in order to be considered eligible for the \nprogram.  It is  noted that the grievant voluntarily \nrefused participation in Shock on 10/23/15, and that he \nwas subsequently screened and found to be ineligible \nfor  participation  for  medical  reasons  on  10/13/17.  \nCORC further notes that there is no court order for \nhim  to  be  enrolled  in  Shock,  and  that  there  is  no \nrequirement  in  Directive  #0086  to  afford  him \nalternative placement.  \n \nWith  respect  to  the  grievant’s  appeal,  CORC  notes \nthat  DOCCS  has  compiled  with  all  rules  and \nregulations with regard to the administration of the \nShock  Incarceration  Program,  and  finds  no \ndiscrimination or malfeasance by staff.  In addition, \nCORC notes that he was Conditionally Released to \nCommunity Supervision on 12/26/18.   \n \nId.  Plaintiff was released from DOCCS custody at Greene on December 26, \n2018.  Id.  He filed this civil rights action about a month later.  Dkt. No. 1.  \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n Under Rule 56, summary judgment is warranted “if the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a).  An issue of \nfact is material for purposes of this inquiry if it “might affect the outcome of \nthe suit under the governing law.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. \n242, 248 (1986).  A dispute of material fact is genuine “if the evidence is such \nthat a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”  Id. \n \n- 23 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 24 of 49\nIn assessing whether there are any genuine disputes of material fact, “a \ncourt must resolve any ambiguities and draw all inferences from the facts in \na light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Ward v. Stewart, 286 F. \nSupp. 3d 321, 327 (N.D.N.Y. 2017) (citation omitted).  Summary judgment is \ninappropriate where a “review of the record reveals sufficient evidence for a \nrational trier of fact to find in the [non-movant’s] favor.”  Treglia v. Town of \nManlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). \n“Where, as here, the parties have cross-moved for summary judgment, a \nreviewing court must evaluate each party’s motion on its own merits, taking \ncare in each instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party \nwhose motion is under consideration.”  United States v. Bedi, 453 F. Supp. 3d \n563, 570 (N.D.N.Y. 2020) (cleaned up).  “In undertaking this analysis, it bears \nnoting that a district court is not required to grant judgment as a matter of \nlaw for one side or the other.”  Id. \nIV.  DISCUSSION \nThere are two motions for summary judgment pending: Goodall’s motion \nfor partial summary judgment on his ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims; and \ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of plaintiff’s \ncomplaint in its entirety.  See Dkt. Nos. 159, 161.  \n  \n \n- 24 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 25 of 49\nA.  Threshold Matters  \nBefore turning to the merits of Goodall’s claims, there are a few threshold \nissues that require attention. \n1.  Goodall’s Statement of Material Facts \nFirst, defendants argue that Goodall’s Statement of Material Facts does \nnot comply with Local Rule 56.1 because several of its facts rely on exhibits \nthat are outside of the record.  Defs.’ Opp’n, Dkt. No. 174 at 6–7.  In support \nof this argument, defendants assert that the declaration of plaintiff’s counsel \nimproperly describes the exhibits by using only their so-called “Bates” page \nnumber.9  See id.  Accordingly, defendants contends that plaintiff’s motion for \nsummary judgment must be denied.  Id. at 7.  \nUpon review, this request must be denied.  Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1, \n“[a]ny motion for summary judgment shall contain a separate Statement of \nMaterial Facts.”  N.D.N.Y. L.R. 56.1(a).  The Statement of Material Facts \n“shall set forth . . . a short and concise statement of each material facts about \nwhich the moving party contends there exists no genuine issue,” and “[e]ach \nlisted fact shall set forth a specific citation to the record where the fact is \nestablished.”  Id.   \n \n  9  A Bates number is just a shorthand way of describing a system of sequentially numbering a \ncollection of pages from different documents.  It can be particularly helpful when the underlying \ndocuments being referenced already have their own conflicting pagination.   \n \n- 25 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 26 of 49\nImportantly, “[t]he record for purposes of the Statement of Material Facts \nincludes the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions \nand affidavits.”  N.D.N.Y. L.R. 56.1(a).  Defendants have failed to set forth \nany basis on which to conclude that the exhibits cited by Goodall’s counsel \nare in fact “outside” of the record.  To the contrary, the exhibits at issue \nappear to be part of the record.  Plaintiff points out that one of the exhibits \nwas obtained from DOCCS prior to the litigation and was attached to his \ncomplaint, and the remaining exhibits were produced by defendants in \ndiscovery.  See Pl.’s Reply, Dkt. No. 182 at 10–11.  As a result, defendants \nhave failed to establish that plaintiff has relied on exhibits not properly \nwithin the record.  Accordingly, defendants’ argument must be rejected.10   \n2.  Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts \nGoodall also argues that defendants’ motion for summary judgment does \nnot comply with this District’s Local Rules.  Pl.’s Opp’n, Dkt. No. 175-1 at 9–\n12.  In particular, plaintiff maintains that several paragraphs of defendants’ \nStatement of Material Facts “do not meet the substantive requirements of \nRule 56 because they fail to provide citations to the admissible evidence of \n \n10  Defendants also argue that several paragraphs of Goodall’s Statement of Material Facts rely \non exhibits that do not clearly establish the alleged facts asserted, fail to abide by the requirement \nthat each numbered paragraph contains a short and concise statement of each material fact, and set \nforth facts wholly irrelevant to the matter.  These objections have already been considered in setting \nforth the factual narrative of this case.  To the extent that this request conflicts with those facts, it is \ndenied.   \n \n- 26 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 27 of 49\nrecord to support each fact.”  Id. at 9.  Accordingly, plaintiff requests that the \nparagraphs be stricken and defendants’ motion be denied in full.  Id. at 9–12.  \nFirst, Goodall argues that paragraphs ninety through ninety-six contain \ncitations to exhibits outside of the record.  See Pl.’s Opp’n at 10.  A review of \nthese paragraphs indicates that plaintiff may be correct.  These exhibits are \nreferenced by only their Bates page number and do not appear to be attached \nto defendants’ motion.  See Defs.’ Facts ¶¶ 90–96.   \nConsequently, it cannot be determined which exhibits defendants are \nreferring to or, ultimately, whether those exhibits actually support the facts \nbeing asserted.  Notably, however, these challenged paragraphs also contain \ncitations to two other exhibits that defendants have attached to their motion \npapers.  Therefore, these paragraphs will not be stricken.  Instead, the facts \nasserted in these paragraphs will be disregarded unless they are supported \nby the other exhibits on which defendants have appropriately relied.   \nSecond, Goodall argues that paragraphs thirty-seven through forty-three \nand eighty-five through eighty-eight contain citations that improperly lack \nspecificity.  See Pl.’s Opp’n at 10–11.  Upon review, plaintiff’s argument must \nbe accepted.  These paragraphs are citations to plaintiff’s deposition.  This \nproceeding occurred over two days.  A separate transcript was generated for \neach day.  See Ex. 2 to Hamilton Decl., Dkt. Nos. 161-4, 161-5.   \n \n- 27 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 28 of 49\nDespite this complexity, the paragraphs challenged by Goodall do not \nspecify the date on which they rely.  See Defs.’ Facts ¶¶ 37–43, 85–88.  This \nfailure by defendants to provide specific citations makes it difficult to \ndetermine whether the facts asserted in these paragraphs are actually \nsupported by plaintiff’s testimony.  Even so, these paragraphs will not be \nstricken.  Instead, the facts asserted in these challenged paragraphs will not \nbe considered unless the Court is readily able to locate the support for them \nin the available deposition testimony.11 \n3.  Goodall’s Motion to Strike \n  Finally, Goodall has moved to strike statements made by Dr. Smith in a \ndeclaration filed in support of defendants’ motion.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 12–19.  In \nparticular, plaintiff asserts that Dr. Smith’s statements should be stricken \nbecause they: (1) are conclusory or misleading; (2) lack a basis of knowledge; \n(3) contain inadmissible speculation; (4) contain improper legal conclusions; \n(5) are in conflict with prior deposition testimony; (6) contain incomplete \nprejudicial characterizations; and (7) are in direct contradiction with other \nevidence in the record.  See id.   \n \n11  Third, Goodall asserts that defendants have not cited to their Statement of Material facts in \ntheir memorandum of law.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 11.  While defendants’ failure to do so complicates the \nsummary judgment process, defendants’ motion will not be denied on this basis.  \n \n- 28 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 29 of 49\n  Under Rule 56(c)(4), “[w]hen it comes to a non-expert fact witness, ‘[a]n \naffidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on \npersonal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and \nshow that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters \nstated.’”  Krul v. DeJoy, --F. Supp. 3d--, 2023 WL 8449589, at *17 (N.D.N.Y. \nDec. 6, 2023) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(4)).   \n  “[A] court may strike those portions of a declaration that are not made \nupon the declarant’s personal knowledge, contain inadmissible hearsay or \nmake generalized and conclusory statements.”  Fed. Trade Comm’n v. \nVantage Point Servs., LLC, 266 F. Supp. 3d 648, 654 (W.D.N.Y. 2017) (citing \nUnited States v. Priv. Sanitation Indus. Ass’n of Nassau/Suffolk, Inc., 44 \nF.3d 1082, 1084 (2d Cir. 1995)).  Alternatively, a court may “simply disregard \nportions of an affidavit or affirmation that are not based on personal \nknowledge or that are otherwise inadmissible.”  Krul, 2023 WL 8449589, at \n*18 (collecting cases).  \n  Upon review, the latter approach is the better course of action under the \ncircumstances.  Accordingly, any of the statements made by Dr. Smith in her \ndeclaration that are improper will be disregarded and not be relied upon in \nconstruing the factual narrative of this case.  Accordingly, Goodall’s motion to \nstrike must be denied.   \n \n- 29 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 30 of 49\nB.  Summary Judgment  \nGoodall’s second amended complaint sets forth three causes of action: (1) a \nviolation of the ADA against DOCCS; (2) a violation of the Rehabilitation Act \nagainst DOCCS; and (3) a violation of his equal protection rights against the \nindividual defendants, in their individual capacities, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1983.  See Compl. ¶¶ 77–97. \n1.  ADA & Rehabilitation Act (Counts One & Two) \n  In his first and second causes of action, Goodall maintains that DOCCS \ndiscriminated against him in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \nby refusing him participation in the SIP, or an equivalent program, because \nof his disabilities.  Compl. ¶¶ 77–93.  Plaintiff asserts that his reasonable \naccommodation requests were denied due to DOCCS’s policy of permitting \nonly court-ordered inmates, who do not meet the eligibility requirements of \nthe SIP, to participate in an alternative program.12  See id.  Plaintiff argues \nthat the denial of his requests deprived him of “rehabilitative programming \nand wrongfully subjected him to prolonged incarceration.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 8.  \n \n12  The Court notes that this policy is no longer in effect.  Goodall asserts that DOCCS has since \nexpanded the “SIP alternative placement to non-court-ordered inmates and the applicable medical \nand mental health suitability screens.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 32.  Thus, plaintiff’s claims allege completed \nharms, not ongoing ones.  \n \n- 30 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 31 of 49\nBoth plaintiff and defendants seek summary judgment on these claims.  See \nid. at 9–37; Defs.’ Mem. at 7–13.   \n“Title II of the ADA ‘proscribes discrimination against the disabled in \naccess to public services.’”  Cox v. (DOCCS) NYS Dep’t of Corr., --F. Supp. 3d--\n, 2023 WL 3300496, at *8 (N.D.N.Y. May 8, 2023) (quoting Harris v. Mills, \n572 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2009)).  “The statute provides that ‘no qualified \nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded \nfrom participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such \nentity.’”  Id. (citing Harris, 572 F.3d at 73).  Likewise, Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act provides “that no otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  \nWright v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Corr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting 29 \nU.S.C. § 794(a)).  “Because the standards under both statutes are generally \nthe same and the subtle distinctions between the statutes are not implicated \nin this case, ‘we treat claims under the two statutes identically.’”  Id. (quoting \nHenrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003)).  \n \n- 31 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 32 of 49\nTo establish a violation under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, a New \nYork State prisoner must demonstrate “that 1) he is a qualified individual \nwith a disability; 2) DOCCS is an entity subject to the acts; and 3) he was \ndenied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from DOCCS’s services, \nprograms, or activities or DOCCS otherwise discriminated against him by \nreason of his disability.”  Wright, 831 F.3d at 72 (citing Henrietta D., 331 F.3d \nat 272).    \nDefendants do not challenge the second and third elements required to \nshow a violation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, that DOCCS is a public \nentity subject to both acts and that Goodall was excluded from participating \nin the SIP due to a disability.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 9–13.  Instead, defendants \nassert that plaintiff has failed to demonstrate the first element, that he is a \nqualified individual with a disability under the acts.  See id.  \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both define the term “disability” with \nrespect to an individual as: “(A) a physical or mental impairment that \nsubstantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (B) a \nrecord of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an \nimpairment.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1) (ADA); 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B) \n(Rehabilitation Act).   \n \n- 32 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 33 of 49\nTo establish a disability under prong (A), “a plaintiff must: (1) ‘show that \n[ ]he suffers from a physical or mental impairment’; (2) ‘identify the activity \nclaimed to be impaired and establish that it constitutes a major life activity’; \nand (3) ‘show that h[is] impairment substantially limits the major life activity \npreviously identified.’”  Norman v. NYU Langone Health Sys., 492 F. Supp. \n3d 154, 163 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), aff’d, 2021 WL 5986999 (2d Cir. Dec. 17, 2021) \n(quoting Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N.Y., 287 F.3d 138, 147 (2d Cir. \n2002)).  \nMajor life activities include, inter alia, “caring for oneself, performing \nmanual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, \nbending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, \ncommunicating, and working,” as well as “the operation of a major bodily \nfunction.”  42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).   \nIn determining whether a major life activity is substantially limited by an \nimpairment, “courts consider ‘the nature and severity of the impairment; its \nduration or expected duration; and the existence of any actual or expected \npermanent or long[-]term impact.’”  Mazzeo v. Mnuchin, 751 F. App’x 13, 15 \n(2d Cir. 2018) (summary order) (quoting Capobianco v. City of N.Y., 422 F.3d \n47, 57 (2d Cir. 2005)).  \n \n- 33 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 34 of 49\nIn support of their motion, defendants argue that there is no triable issue \nof fact as to whether Goodall is a qualified individual with a disability.  Defs.’ \nMem. at 9–13.  In defendants’ view, plaintiff has failed to establish that he \nsuffers from a “physical or mental impairment” because he has only offered “a \nlist of medical conditions extracted from his medical records in support of his \nassertion that he suffers from an impairment.”  Id. at 13.  Defendants also \nargue that the record lacks evidence tending to show that plaintiff’s alleged \nimpairments substantially limit a major life activity.  Id.  According to \ndefendants, plaintiff “has never offered anything more” than his assertion \nthat “intense and/or rigorous physical activity” qualifies as a major life \nactivity, but he “has never offered anything to support that [this] activity \nconstitutes a major life activity.”  Id.   \nGoodall argues that evidence in the record conclusively establishes that he \nis a qualified individual with a disability.  Pl.’s Mem. at 11–15; Pl.’s Opp’n at \n21–26.  In support of this argument, plaintiff relies on testimony from his \ndeposition detailing the impairments he suffers from and the limitations they \npose.13  Pl.’s Opp’n at 21–22.  Specifically, plaintiff testified that he suffers \n \n13  Goodall also relies on medical records in which medical staff indicated that he suffers from \nmultiple conditions; his medical and mental health service level classifications; the denials of his \nreasonable accommodation requests; the fact that he was prescribed medications to treat his \nimpairments; and that he was not assigned to work in the mess hall and was assigned to sleep in a \nbottom bunk in order to mitigate the risk of harm from seizures and falls.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 11–15; \nPl.’s Opp’n at 23–24.  \n \n- 34 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 35 of 49\nfrom: (1) a seizure disorder that subjects him to involuntary muscle twitches \nthat make him unsteady in his movements and prone to falls during active \nepisodes; (2) chronic back pain that causes him difficulty sleeping, standing, \nlifting, and sitting for sustained periods of time; (3) heart conditions that \ncause him to experience sharp chest pains or the feeling that he is going to \nfaint when engaging in strenuous physical activity; (4) flat feet that \nnegatively impact his balance and cause him excruciating pain, making it \ndifficult for him to run as fast and far as others; (5) mental impairments that \ncause him to experience depression and anxiety, and engage in self-injurious \nbehaviors.  See id.; see also Pl.’s Add’l Facts ¶¶ 1–12.  In plaintiff’s view, the \nevidence, at the very least, creates a triable issue of fact as to whether he is a \nqualified individual with a disability.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 26. \nUpon review, the parties’ motions for summary judgment on Goodall’s \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims must be denied.  Viewing the facts in the \nlight most favorable to plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that he suffers \nfrom an impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.  However, \nplaintiff’s factual showing is far from sufficient to establish this element as a \nmatter of law.  Therefore, this amounts to a genuine dispute of material fact \nthat precludes the grant of either party’s motion.  And because there is a \ntriable issue of fact as to the threshold question of whether Goodall suffers \n \n- 35 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 36 of 49\nfrom a qualifying disability, the Court need not address plaintiff’s remaining \narguments in support of summary judgment.  Accordingly, plaintiff’s ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act claims will remain for trial. \n  As a final matter, defendants argue that Goodall’s ADA claim is barred by \nsovereign immunity.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 30–34.  This is a difficult question, \nbut the Court previously addressed it at the motion-to-dismiss stage.  Briefly \nstated, in United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151 (2006), the Supreme Court \nheld that the ADA’s abrogation of state sovereign immunity is valid as long \nas the particular claim that a plaintiff brings seeks damages for conduct that \n“actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment.”  Id. at 159.  For the reasons \nexplained below, plaintiff’s § 1983 equal protection claim remains for trial \nand therefore plaintiff’s ADA claim will not be dismissed on the basis of \nsovereign immunity. \n2.  Equal Protection (Count Three) \n  In his third claim, Goodall argues that the individual defendants, in their \nindividual capacities, violated his equal protection rights “by failing to place \nhim in the same SIP alternative program in which it placed court-ordered \nindividuals who were otherwise similarly situated to [him].”  Pl.’s Opp’n at \n27; see also Compl. ¶¶ 94–97.  Plaintiff asserts that the individual defendants \nwere acting pursuant to DOCCS’s “facially discriminatory” policy of excluding \n \n- 36 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 37 of 49\nnon-court-ordered inmates, who are medically unsuitable for the SIP, from \nparticipating in the alternative program.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 27–28.  Defendants \nseek summary judgment on this claim.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 13–30.   \n  “The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that \nno State shall ‘deny to any persons within its jurisdiction the equal protection \nof the laws.’”  Kuiken v. Cnty. of Hamilton, 669 F. Supp. 3d 119, 125 \n(N.D.N.Y. 2023) (quoting U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 1).   \n  To prove a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff must \nshow: (1) adverse treatment of individuals compared with other similarly \nsituated individuals; and (2) that such selective treatment was based on \nimpermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or \npunish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to \ninjure a person.  Miner v. Clinton Cnty., N.Y., 541 F.3d 464, 474 (2d Cir. \n2008) (citing Bizzarro v. Miranda, 394 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 2005)).   \n  In addition, a plaintiff must show that the disparity in treatment cannot \nwithstand the appropriate level of scrutiny.  Phillips v. Girdich, 408 F.3d 124, \n129 (2d Cir. 2005).  As relevant here, “[i]t is well-settled that laws that \ndiscriminate on the basis of disability are subject to rational-basis review and \nupheld so long as there is a rational relationship between the disparity of \ntreatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.”  Doe v. Zucker, 520 F. \n \n- 37 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 38 of 49\nSupp. 3d 217, 267 (N.D.N.Y. 2021), aff’d sub nom., Goe v. Zucker, 43 F.4th 19 \n(2d Cir. 2022) (cleaned up).  \n  Goodall’s equal protection claim is brought under § 1983.  “It is well \nsettled in this Circuit that ‘personal involvement of defendants in alleged \nconstitutional deprivations is a prerequisite to an award of damages under \n§ 1983.’”  Wright v. Smith, 21 F.3d 496, 501 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting Moffitt v. \nTown of Brookfield, 950 F.2d 880, 885 (2d Cir. 1991)).   \n  “The Second Circuit has held that ‘personal involvement’ under § 1983 \nmeans ‘direct participation, or failure to remedy the alleged wrong after \nlearning of it, or creation of a policy or custom under which unconstitutional \npractices occurred, or gross negligence in managing subordinates.’”  Busch v. \nCnty. of Erie, 2022 WL 1460022, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. May 9, 2022) (quoting Black \nv. Coughlin, 76 F.3d 72, 74 (2d Cir. 1996)).   \nHowever, in Tangreti v. Bachmann, the Second Circuit clarified that there \nis no special test for supervisor liability under § 1983.  See 983 F.3d 609, 618–\n19 (2d Cir. 2020).  Instead, a plaintiff must show that the supervisor, through \nthe supervisor’s own individual actions, violated the Constitution.  Id. at 616 \n(citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 675–76 868 (2009)).  A supervisor can \nonly be held liable “if that supervisor participates directly in the alleged \n \n- 38 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 39 of 49\nconstitutional violation or if that supervisor creates a policy or custom under \nwhich unconstitutional practices occurred.”  Id. at 617 n.4.  \n  Defendants argue that Goodall’s equal protection claim must be dismissed \nbecause none of the individual defendants were personally involved in the \nalleged violation of plaintiff’s equal protection rights.14  Defs.’ Mem. at 15–30.  \nIn opposition, plaintiff maintains that there is a genuine issue of material \nfact as to each individual defendants’ personal involvement.15  See Pl.’s Opp’n \nat 30–40.    \na.  Acting Commissioner Annucci \n  Goodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Annucci \nwas personally involved in the alleged violation because, as the Acting \nDOCCS Commissioner, Annucci “maintained the agency-wide policy whereby \n \n14  In addition to their arguments as to each individual, defendants make two fairly conclusory \narguments.  First, they argue that dismissal is warranted because “[t]here is no enforceable liberty \ninterest in participating in the SIP.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 13–14.  In making this argument, defendants \nrely on cases discussing due process violations.  See id.  But Goodall claims his equal protection \nrights were violated.  Accordingly, this argument must be rejected.  Second, they argue that these \nequal protection claims must be dismissed because plaintiff was not subjected to any unequal \ntreatment.  Id. at 30.  But viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, a reasonable jury could \nconclude that plaintiff was treated differently than similarly situated individuals.  Thus, this \nargument must also be rejected. \n   \n15  Defendants argue, without filing a separate motion, that pursuant to Rule 37, Goodall should \nbe precluded from relying on certain evidence pertaining to the personal involvement of the \nindividual defendants.  Defs Reply, Dkt. No. 181 at 5–8.  Defendants assert that this evidence must \nbe disregarded because plaintiff failed to properly supplement his responses to interrogatory \nrequests asking for evidence of the individual defendants’ personal involvement.  Id.  However, \ndefendants have not shown that the evidence they seek to exclude was not made known to them \nduring the discovery process.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e) (requiring supplement of a disclosure where \nthe additional information “has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the \ndiscovery process or in writing”).  Thus, defendants’ argument must be denied.   \n \n- 39 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 40 of 49\nonly court-ordered inmates who were deemed medically unsuitable for SIP \nwere placed in the SIP alternative program.”  Pl’s Opp’n at 31.   \n  In support of this argument, Goodall contends that Annucci: (1) approved \nand signed DOCCS Directive 0086 that was in effect during his incarceration; \n(2) promulgated the rules and regulations for the SIP; and (3) had authority \nto designate DOCCS facilities where the SIP would be administered.  Pl’s \nOpp’n at 31–32.   \n  Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Goodall, there is a genuine \nissue of material fact as to Annucci’s personal involvement.  As noted supra, \npersonal involvement can be established by evidence of an official’s creation \nof a policy or custom under which unconstitutional practices occurred.  See \nRobinson v. Phillips, 2023 WL 3170389, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. May 1, 2023) (citing \nLalonde v. City of Ogdensburg, 662 F. Supp. 3d 289, 322–23 (N.D.N.Y. 2023)).   \n  As applied here, a reasonable jury could find that Annucci was responsible \nfor implementing the policy at issue here; i.e., that the alternative to the SIP \nis only made available to inmates who are court-ordered to participate in the \n \n- 40 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 41 of 49\nprogram and do not meet the SIP eligibility requirements.  Thus, Goodall’s § \n1983 claim against Annucci remains for trial.  \nb.  Associate Commissioner Hilton \n  Goodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Hilton \nwas personally involved in the alleged violation because, as the Associate \nCommissioner of DOCCS, Hilton “maintained the agency-wide policy \nwhereby only court-ordered inmates who were deemed medically unsuitable \nfor SIP were placed in the SIP alternative program.”  Pl’s Opp’n at 31.   \n  In support of this argument, Goodall asserts that Hilton produced and \nissued a memorandum “that set forth DOCCS’ sudden expansion of SIP \nalternative placement to non-court-ordered inmates and the applicable \nmedical and mental health suitability screens.”  Pl’s Opp’n at 32.  In plaintiffs \nview, this shows that Hilton “could have implemented this expansion as early \nas 2015, when [his] incarceration began, but did not do so at the time.”  Id.  \n  Upon review, Goodall has not shown that Hilton was personally involved \nin the alleged violation of his equal protection rights.  The evidence plaintiff \nrelies on does not constitute sufficient evidence that Hilton played any role in \nimplementing the policy at issue in this case.  Accordingly, defendants are \nentitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s § 1983 claim against Hilton.  \n \n- 41 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 42 of 49\nc.  Rehabilitation Aide Cluever \n  Goodall asserts that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Cluever \nwas personally involved in the alleged violation because, as an Offender \nRehabilitation Aide at Greene, she was instrumental in the SIP screening \nprocess.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 32–33.  In making this argument, plaintiff relies on \nthe undisputed facts that Cluever: (1) signed and submitted to her supervisor \ntwo memos of agreement plaintiff filled out in an attempt to participate in \nthe SIP; and (2) completed two SIP suitability screening forms in relation to \nplaintiff by relying on information found in plaintiff’s DOCCS file.  Id. at 32.   \nUpon review, the evidence Goodall on which relies does not demonstrate \nthat Cluever had the requisite personal involvement.  Cluever’s act of signing \nand submitting agreements merely reflects that received and transferred \nplaintiff’s requests, which is insufficient to show personal involvement.  See \nCummings v. Paterson, 2021 WL 2550821, at *11 (W.D.N.Y. June 22, 2021) \n(finding no personal involvement where, inter alia, DOCCS employees’ \nparticipation was limited to the “receipt and transmission” of reasonable \naccommodation requests).  Moreover, Cluever’s completion of the suitability \nscreening forms does not, in any way, suggest that she directly participated \nin the ultimate denial of plaintiff’s requests.  Accordingly, defendants are \nentitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s § 1983 claim against Cluever. \n \n- 42 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 43 of 49\nd.  Rehabilitation Coordinator O’Hara \n  Goodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that O’Hara \nwas personally involved in the alleged violation because, as a Senior ORC at \nGreene, she directly participated in the denial of his requests.  Pl.’s Opp’n at \n33–35.  As proof of this, plaintiff asserts that O’Hara: (1) found him medically \nunsuitable for participation in the SIP; (2) recommended the denial of two of \nhis grievances; and (3) complained in an email about his act of filing several \ngrievances.  Id.  \n  Upon review, this evidence does not demonstrate that O’Hara was \npersonally involved in the alleged violation of Goodall’s equal protection \nrights.  O’Hara’s administrative finding that plaintiff was unsuitable for \nparticipation in the SIP does not signify that she took part in the denial of \nany of his requests.   \n  Moreover, O’Hara’s recommendation that Goodall’s grievances be denied is \ninadequate to show personal involvement.  See Weston v. Bayne, 2023 WL \n8435998, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. June 28, 2023), report and recommendation \nadopted, 2023 WL 8183219 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 27, 2023) (noting that “playing a \nrole in the administrative denial of a prison inmate’s grievance” is \ninsufficient to establish personal involvement).   \n \n- 43 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 44 of 49\n  Lastly, the email Goodall relies on does not even remotely suggest that \nO’Hara was personally involved in the denial of his requests.  At most, the \nemail indicates that O’Hara was aware of plaintiff’s various requests and \ngrievances.  Accordingly, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on \nplaintiff’s § 1983 claim against O’Hara. \ne.  Deputy Superintendent Fisher \n  Goodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Fisher \nwas personally involved in the alleged violation because she reviewed and \ndenied his first and second requests.   Pl.’s Opp’n at 35–37.    \nViewing the facts in the light most favorable to Goodall, a reasonable jury \ncould conclude that Fisher directly participated in the alleged violation of his \nequal protection rights.  See Cummings, 2021 WL 2550821, at *12 (finding \nsufficient evidence of personal involvement for purposes of a deliberate \nindifference claim where the defendant denied the plaintiff’s reasonable \naccommodation request).  Therefore, plaintiff’s § 1983 claim against Fisher \nremains for trial.  \nf.  Deputy Superintendent Hammond \n  Goodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that \nHammond was personally involved in the alleged violation because he denied \nhis third request.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 37.   \n \n- 44 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 45 of 49\n  Upon review, there is sufficient evidence of Hammond’s personal \ninvolvement to warrant the denial of summary judgment.  As determined \nsupra with respect to Fisher, the denial of Goodall’s third request is sufficient \nto establish a fact question on Hammond’s personal involvement in the \nalleged violation of plaintiff’s equal protection rights.  See Cummings, 2021 \nWL 2550821, at *12.  Accordingly, plaintiff’s § 1983 claim against Hammond \nremains for trial.   \ng.  Rehabilitation Coordinator Mardon  \nGoodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Mardon \nwas personally involved in the alleged violation because: (1) Dugon asserted \nin a memorandum to Hammond that Mardon met with plaintiff to review the \ndenial of his first request; and (2) Mardon’s signature is on a screening form \nthat determined that plaintiff was medically unsuitable for participation in \nthe SIP.  Pl.’s Opp’n at 37.   \n  Upon review, the evidence Goodall focuses on does not demonstrate the \nrequisite personal involvement of Mardon.  Mardon’s meeting with plaintiff \nto discuss the denial of his first request and the presence of her signature on \nthe suitability form do not indicate that Mardon directly participated in the \ndenial of plaintiff’s requests.  Thus, defendants are entitled to summary \njudgment on plaintiff’s § 1983 claim against Mardon.   \n \n- 45 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 46 of 49\nh.  Rehabilitation Coordinator Welytok \n  Goodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Welytok \nwas personally involved in the violation because he wrote a letter to him after \nthe denial of his request asking to be reconsidered for participation in the SIP \nor an alternative program.  Pl’s Opp’n at 38.  This letter was forwarded to \nNoriega because Welytok was no longer plaintiff’s assigned ORC at the time.  \nSee Ex. 17 to Caturano Decl. at 2.   \n  Upon review, this evidence is categorically insufficient to demonstrate the \npersonal involvement of Welytok.  It does not indicate that Welytok directly \nparticipated in the denial of his requests.  See Douglas v. Annucci, 2022 WL \n2306934, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. June 27, 2022) (explaining that “[r]eceiving and \nforwarding an inmate’s correspondence is insufficient to establish personal \ninvolvement by a prison official.”); Lusmat v. Papoosha, 2023 WL 4236012, at \n*13 (D. Conn. June 28, 2023) (noting that the receipt of “a denial decision, is \nnot sufficient to establish personal involvement in the actual denial decision \nitself”).  Therefore, defendants are entitled to summary judgment on \nplaintiff’s § 1983 claim against Welytok.  \ni.  Rehabilitation Coordinator Noriega  \n  Goodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Noriega \nwas personally involved in the violation because she brought to Mardon’s \n \n- 46 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 47 of 49\nattention the letter he sent to Welytok in relation to the denial of his first \nrequest.16  Pl.’s Opp’n at 37–38.   \n  Upon review, Goodall has failed to show that Noriega had the requisite \npersonal involvement.  The fact that Noriega received plaintiff’s letter from \nWelytok, and informed Mardon of the letter, does not suggest that Noriega \nparticipated in the denial of plaintiff’s requests.  See Adams v. Annucci, 2023 \nWL 2664301, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2023) (noting receipt of an inmate’s \nletter, by itself, is not personal involvement).  Accordingly, defendants are \nentitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s § 1983 claim against Noriega. \nj.  Superintendent Smith \nGoodall argues that a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that \nSuperintendent Smith was personally involved in the violation because he: \n(1) denied three of his grievances; and (2) told Fisher that it was not a good \nidea for her to speak with him regarding his second request.  Pl.’s Opp’n at \n38–39.   \nUpon review, Goodall has not demonstrated that Superintendent Smith \nwas personally involved.  Neither the conversation with Fisher nor the denial \n \n16  Goodall also relies on an email from Chris VanBergen, the Inmate Grievance Program \nDirector, to another DOCCS employee requesting input from Noriega regarding his grievances.  See \nPl.’s Opp’n at 38.  Plaintiff has failed to offer any explanation as to how this email demonstrates \nNoriega’s personal involvement in the denial of his requests.  \n \n- 47 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 48 of 49\nof plaintiff’s grievances suggest that Superintendent Smith participated in \nthe denial of plaintiff’s requests to participate in the SIP.  These are separate \nadministrative determinations.  Shomo v. Dep’t of Corr. & Cmty. Supervision, \n2022 WL 1406726, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2022) (noting that the “[p]laintiff’s \nallegations that the Individual Defendants held certain positions within \nDOCCS and denied his grievances are simply insufficient.”).  Accordingly, \ndefendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s § 1983 claim \nagainst Superintendent Smith.  \nk.  Dr. Smith \nFinally, although defendants assert that they seek dismissal of all of the \nindividual defendants, they have failed to set forth any argument as to why \nDr. Smith should be dismissed.  See Defs.’ Mem. at 15–30.  Accordingly, \nGoodall’s § 1983 claim against Dr. Smith remains for trial.     \nV.  CONCLUSION  \nIn sum, all three of Goodall’s claims—under the ADA, the Rehabilitation \nAct, and § 1983—remain for trial.  Nonetheless, several of the individual \ndefendants must be dismissed because plaintiff has failed to show that they \nhad the requisite personal involvement in the alleged violation of his equal \nprotection rights.   \nTherefore, it is \n \n- 48 - \n \n \n\nCase 9:19-cv-01359-DNH-CFH   Document 186   Filed 03/26/24   Page 49 of 49\nORDERED that \n  1.  Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment (Dkt. No. 159) is \nDENIED;  \n  2.  Defendants’ motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 161) is \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part;  \n  3.  Plaintiff’s ADA (Count One) and Rehabilitation Act (Count Two) claims \nagainst DOCCS remain for trial; \n  4.  Plaintiff’s § 1983 equal protection claims (Count Three) remain for trial \nagainst defendants Annucci, Fisher, Hammond, and Doreen Smith;  \n  5.  Plaintiff’s § 1983 equal protection claims against defendants Hilton, \nBrandon Smith, Mardon, O’Hara, Cluever, Noriega, and Welytok are \nDISMISSED; and \n  6.
