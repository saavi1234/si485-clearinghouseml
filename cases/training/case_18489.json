Consequently, the untimely motion for the extension of a pretrial order deadline is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. The untimely motion to reopen summary judgment motion practice is also DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. The parties are DIRECTED to meet and confer and submit a joint letter by 3/12/2023 by 12:00 PM. The parties are directed to Individual Rule I.B. of Magistrate Judge Lee G. Dunst regarding expectations of professional conduct. See Individual Rule I.B.2 (\"[A]ttorneys of record are expected to act professionally and cooperate with each other in all phases of discovery and be courteous in their dealings with each of other.\").

This is inconsistent with the undersigned's Individual Practice Rule V.B., recognizing that \"[a] settlement conference is more likely to be productive if, before the conference with the Court, the parties exchange formal settlement proposals.\" Based on these submissions, the Court is uncertain that the parties are fully \"prepared to participate in a productive settlement conference.\" DE 106 . The Court ORDERS that the parties communicate by telephone, video conference or in person (not by email) an updated offer and demand as soon as possible and advise the Court by 4:00PM on 5/1/2023 in ex parte submissions (two pages maximum and no further exhibits) with details about their recent discussions. Finally, the parties shall be prepared to discuss the following topics at the 5/3/2023 settlement conference: (1) the specific details about the status and timing of implementation of the text to 911 system, and (2) the specific details, if any, regarding the status and timing of any public service announcements about the text to 911 system. See DE 89, 90, 91 . Ordered by Magistrate Judge Lee G. Dunst on 4/26/2023. (CT)"

This Court defers ruling on Plaintiff's two motions for a pre-motion conference to Compel Compliance with the Stipulation of Settlement and for Contempt. As discussed at the Pre-Motion Conference held before the undersigned on March 6, 2024, Defendants have still not complied with the following terms of the Stipulation: (1) Publishing public service announcements on Nassau County's official social media platforms two times a week for 12 weeks (Stipulation 5(b)(i)); (2) Post flyers regarding text-to-911 in a conspicuous location in five specified county buildings (Stipulation 5(b)(ii)); and (3) Provide Plaintiff's counsel with statistics and information regarding the usage of text-to-911 (Stipulation 5(c)).At the same March 6th conference, the undersigned Ordered, and counsel for Defendants Ralph Reissman agreed, that Mr. Reissman would personally hang the flyers in the five county buildings and submit photo proof to the Court of him doing so. Additionally, Mr. Reissman was ordered to provide Plaintiff's counsel a written copy of the text-to-911 usage statistics read into the record during the conference, and to instruct his clients to post the required public service announcements on their social media platforms. The undersigned EXPLICITLY, and in no uncertain terms, afforded Mr. Reissman and Defendants ONE WEEK to comply with the outstanding terms of the Stipulation.On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff's counsel contacted Mr. Reissman via email to inquire about the status of the above items given the impending deadline provided by the Court. Mr. Reissman responded that scheduling conflicts had prevented him from hanging the flyers, that he planned to file a letter via ECF with the usage statistics, and that he would follow-up regarding the social media posts. The Court is aware of Plaintiff's patient efforts to resolve Defendants' non-compliance. It is CLEAR that without sanctions or other intervention from the Court, Defendants will continue to ignore the Stipulation as well as the undersigned's Orders. Accordingly, Defendants are DIRECTED, ONE FINAL TIME to comply with the Court's January 16th and March 6th Orders no later than Wednesday, April 17, 2024. Failure to comply with these Orders will result in civil contempt proceedings, where the Court will (among other things) consider a daily monetary sanction. Ordered by Judge Joan M. Azrack on 4/10/2024. (JSB)"

    "summary": "<p>This is a case about access to 911 services for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. On Jan. 3, 2017, Dupree and LoGerfo, two individuals with disabilities, filed suit in United States District Court, Eastern District of New York. They filed pursuant to Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12131 et seq., and Section 504, 29 U.S.C. &sect; 794 et seq., seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. They sought relief that would facilitate the ability for deaf and hard of hearing individuals to communicate with 911 emergency services, specifically the provision of a &ldquo;text-to -911&rdquo; option. The case was assigned to Hon. Judge Joan M. Azrack. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sued the City of New York, City Of New York Police Department, Nassau County (NY), Nassau County Office Of Emergency Management, Suffolk County (NY) and the Suffolk County Office Of Emergency Management. The plaintiffs were represented by Disability Rights New York. &nbsp;The New York City defendants were represented by private counsel, and the Nassau and Suffolk County defendants by their respective county attorney offices.</p>\r\n<p>On or around March 21, 2017, Plaintiff Dupree passed away. After Motions to Dismiss were filed by all defendants and addressed by the court, the court dismissed the New York City and Suffolk County defendants from the case. &nbsp;Nassau County and plaintiff LoGerfo remained in the case and discovery proceeded. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In March of 2021, the court ordered the Nassau County defendants to file a status report on the implementation of text-to-911 in Nassau County. On April 7, 2021, Nassau County reported that it was currently working on contracting with a Text-to-911 provider through a competitive bid contract.</p>\r\n<p>In November 10, 2022, Nassau County provided the court with this status report: &ldquo;In September 2022, the parties reached a verbal settlement agreement, with specific details of the agreed to terms to be worked out. The terms to be finalized include plaintiff&rsquo;s demands that Nassau County create public service announcements to inform the public of the County&rsquo;s Text-to-911 system, which is not yet complete&hellip;&rdquo; The settlement process continued with status reports to the court until May 3, 2023 when a settlement was finalized and the case was conditionally dismissed. The parties agreed that the court would&nbsp;retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement, and to resolve any disputes arising under it for three years. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Implementation of the settlement took additional time. On January 6, 2024, the court ordered Nassau County to provide an update on the provision of public service announcements advertising the availability of text-to-911 services; including notices on social media, in public buildings, and schools. On April 10, 2024, the court met with the parties on a pre-motion for a Motion for Compliance, as Nassau County had not yet completed tasks related to public notice of the Text-to-911 system. After a rebuke by the Court, Nassau County complied with these requirements. On June 20, 2024, the court ordered attorney fees for Plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel for the post settlement period.</p>\r\n<p>The three years in the settlement runs until May 2026, so this case remains open.&nbsp;</p>",

      "text": " \nJanuary 8, 2024 \n \nThe Honorable Joan M. Azrack \nU.S. District Court \nEastern District of New York \n100 Federal Plaza \nCentral Islip, NY 11722 \n \n  Re: LoGerfo v. County of New York, et al., 2:17-CV-0010  \n \nDear Judge Azrack: \n \nDisability Rights New York (DRNY) is counsel for Plaintiff in the above-captioned \nmatter. Please accept this letter as the Status Report ordered by Your Honor regarding Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Pre-Motion Conference for Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance with the \nStipulation of Settlement.  \n \nIn Plaintiff’s December 18, 2023, letter to the Court (Dkt. 112) I notified the Court of \nDefendants’ failure to comply with the Stipulation of Settlement’s requirements that public \nservice announcements about Nassau County’s text-to-911 services be published and distributed. \nOn December 27, 2023, counsel for Defendants, Ralph Reissman, filed a letter with the Court \n(Dkt. 113) which outlined the Defendants’ intention to comply with the Stipulation of Settlement \nat an undisclosed time in the future.  \n \nOn January 3, 2024, I emailed Mr. Reissman to request an update on the status of the \nrequired distribution of the public service announcements. I asked Mr. Reissman to confirm \nwhether the flyer was sent out to school districts, and to confirm whether the flyer had been \nposted in the required County buildings and on social media. I followed-up via email earlier \ntoday. As of the date and time of the filing of this letter Mr. Reissman responded only that he had \nforwarded my inquiries to the responsible parties, and was waiting for feedback.1    \n \nDefendants have provided no date certain for their compliance, and even if they had they \nhave a demonstrated record of failing to take promised steps regarding text-to-911 absent a Court \nOrder. The steps Defendants have failed to take are as simple as posting a flyer and publishing a \nsocial media announcement, yet they remain unable to complete them. Unfortunately, a pre-\n \n1 As of the date and time of this letter, the public service announcements have not been published on Defendants’ \nsocial media pages (https://www.facebook.com/NassauOEM, https://twitter.com/NassauCountyOEM, \nhttps://twitter.com/NassauCountyNY).  \n \n\nmotion conference on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance with the Stipulation of \nSettlement is necessary given Defendants inaction thus far. The practical reality is that Nassau \nCounty’s continued delay necessitates a Motion to Compel Compliance to ensure that the terms \nof the Stipulation of Settlement are complied with.  \n \nBased on the above, Plaintiff reiterates her request for a Pre-Motion Conference by \ntelephone or video on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Compliance with the Stipulation of \nSettlement.  \n \nI would be glad to provide any additional information at the Court’s request. Thank you \nfor your continued attention to this matter. \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \nJessica Richwalder \nCounsel for Plaintiff \n \nCC: All counsel via ECF \n ",

In the following counties and municipalities, a person who has deafness or have hearing \nloss, or has speech or communication disabilities, cannot contact 911 via text message \nand is therefore in many circumstances unable to access critical 911 services, which are \navailable  to  individuals  without  disabilities:    Bronx  County,  Kings  County,  Nassau \nCounty, New York County, Queens County, Richmond County, and Suffolk County. \n2.  Individuals who have deafness or have hearing loss, or have disabilities that impair their \nspeech  and  communication,  cannot  report  crimes,  fires,  motor  vehicle  accidents,  or \nmedical emergencies via text, placing these individuals and others at risk by delaying \ntheir access to emergency services. \n3.

Several years ago, Plaintiff LoGerfo encountered a car on fire while traveling on Route \n135 North in Plainview, New York. Plainview is located in Nassau County. \n28. Plaintiff LoGerfo called 911 to report the car fire.  \n29. The 911 operator asked Plaintiff LoGerfo multiple questions.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-LGD   Document 19   Filed 05/26/17   Page 5 of 9 PageID #: 113\n \n30. Plaintiff LoGerfo told the operator that she was unable to understand the questions. \n31. Plaintiff LoGerfo and the operator repeated this exchange several times. \n32. Plaintiff LoGerfo could not communicate crucial information to the 911 operator because \nof her disability. \n33. Plaintiff LoGerfo was denied and continues to be denied meaningful access to 911 \nservices in Suffolk County, Nassau County, and New York City. \n34. In the areas in which Defendants provide emergency services, individuals without \ndisabilities can use telephones, mobile phones, and voice over internet protocol to dial \n911 and receive immediate access to emergency police, fire, and medical services \nprovided by Defendants. \n35. Individuals with disabilities that impair their ability to speak or to hear conversations on a \ntelephone cannot contact 911 by voice.   \n36. Individuals with disabilities that impair their hearing or communication cannot \nindependently access 911 services.  \n37. Because Defendants do not accept 911 text messages, Plaintiff LoGerfo cannot \nindependently access 911 services. \n38. Plaintiff LoGerfo possesses a cell phone which she wishes to use to contact 911 via text \nas needed. \n39. People without disabilities can contact 911 by telephone or cell phone if they have a \nmedical emergency while away from home. \n40. Individuals who have hearing, speech, or communication disabilities cannot contact 911 \nbecause of the absence of a text-to-911 service. \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-LGD   Document 19   Filed 05/26/17   Page 6 of 9 PageID #: 114\n \n41. People without disabilities can contact 911 by telephone or cell phone if they are the \nwitness to or the victim of a crime. \n42. Individuals who have hearing, speech, or communication disabilities cannot contact 911 \nbecause of the absence of a text-to-911 service. \n43. People without disabilities can contact 911 by telephone or cell phone if there is a fire or \ngas leak. \n44. Individuals who have hearing, speech, or communication disabilities cannot contact 911 \nbecause of the absence of a text-to-911 service. \n45. As a result of Defendants’ failure to implement text-to-911 services, individuals with \ndisabilities do not have the direct, meaningful, reliable, and immediate access to \nemergency 911 services including medical, fire, and police services which is enjoyed by \npersons without disabilities.  \n46.  As a result, individuals with disabilities who cannot contact 911 may suffer property \nloss, severe injury, or death. \n \n \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nTITLE II OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT \n \n47. Plaintiff  re-alleges  and  incorporates  herein  all  previously  alleged  paragraphs  of  the \nComplaint. \n48. Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by \nreason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of \nthe services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12132. \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-LGD   Document 19   Filed 05/26/17   Page 7 of 9 PageID #: 115\n \n49. A “public entity” includes state and local governments, their agencies, and their \ninstrumentalities.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1).  \n50. Defendants are therefore public entities under the ADA.  \n51. Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations require that public entities \n“take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with applicants, \nparticipants, members of the public, and companions with disabilities are as \neffective as communications with others.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(a)(1).  \n52. Defendants have discriminated and continue to discriminate against Plaintiff \nLoGerfo by denying her access to Defendants’ 911 emergency services, in \nviolation of Title II of the ADA.  \n53. Defendants have discriminated and continue to discriminate against Plaintiff \nLoGerfo by failing to provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services enabling her \nto access Defendants’ 911 emergency services, in violation of Title II of the \nADA. \n54. Defendant’s conduct is a present and ongoing violation of Title II of the ADA.  \n \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nSECTION 504 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 \n \n55. Plaintiff  re-alleges  and  incorporates  herein  all  previously  alleged  paragraphs  of  the \nComplaint. \n56. Section 504 provides that “no otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the \nUnited States . . . shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-LGD   Document 19   Filed 05/26/17   Page 8 of 9 PageID #: 116\n \n57. Defendants have received federal financial assistance at all relevant times. \n58. Defendants have discriminated and continue to discriminate against individuals \nwith disabilities on the basis of their disabilities by denying them access to \nDefendants’ 911 emergency services, and appropriate auxiliary aids and services \nenabling them to access Defendants’ 911 emergency services, in violation of \nSection 504. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests relief as set forth below: \n1.  Issue a declaratory judgment that Defendants’ policies, procedures, and \npractices have subjected and continue to subject Plaintiff LoGerfo to \ndiscrimination in violation of Title II of the ADA and Section 504; \n2.  Order Defendants to promptly implement text-to-911 services to \ncommunicate with Defendants’ emergency services; \n3.  Order Defendants to develop and comply with policies, procedures, and \npractices to ensure that individuals with disabilities may communicate \nwith 911 services via text message; \n4.  Order Defendants to train all their representatives and employees on the \nrights of individuals with disabilities under the ADA and Section 504, as \nwell as provide training on Defendants’ policies and procedures for \naccepting text messages to 911; \n5.  An award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; and \n6.  Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-LGD   Document 19   Filed 05/26/17   Page 9 of 9 PageID #: 117\n \nDated: May 26, 2017  \nBrooklyn, New York \n \nBy: /S/ Elizabeth Grossman \nELIZABETH GROSSMAN EG2478 \n \nSARA LISS SL4649 \n \nDISABILITY RIGHTS NEW YORK \nAttorneys for Plaintiff \n \n25 Chapel Street, Suite 1005 \nBrooklyn, NY 11201 \n(518) 432-7861 x 4959 (voice) \n(518) 512-3448 (TDD) \n(518) 427-6561 (Fax) (not for service). \n \n9 \n ",

R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  (ECF Nos. 51, 53, 57.)  For the reasons that follow, the Nassau Defendants’ \nmotion is denied in part and granted in part; the Suffolk Defendants’ motion is denied without \nprejudice to allow the parties to address whether Plaintiff’s claims against the Suffolk Defendants \nare moot; and the City Defendants’ motion is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to show cause, in writing \nby June 8, 2020 why her claims against the Suffolk Defendants should not be dismissed as moot.  \nThe Suffolk Defendants shall file opposition papers by July 8, 2020 and Plaintiff can file a reply \nby July 22, 2020. \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiff brought this action together with a second plaintiff, Nicholas Dupree, who passed away in February 2017 \nand was removed as a party when the Second Amended Complaint was filed.

BACKGROUND \nA.    Factual Background \nPlaintiff is a resident of Suffolk County who has hearing loss and communicates primarily \nwith written notes, emails, text messages, closed captioning, and lipreading.  (SAC ¶¶ 8–9.)  She \nis unable to communicate via telephone.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  Plaintiff alleges that several years ago she \nencountered a car on fire while traveling in Nassau County on Route 135 North in Plainview, New \nYork.  (Id. ¶ 27.)  She called 911 but was unable to understand the questions the operator asked \nand asserts she could not communicate crucial information to the 911 operator because of her \ndisability.  (Id. ¶¶ 27–32.)  Plaintiff contends that she travels throughout New York City and Long \nIsland and claims she was denied and continues to be denied meaningful access to 911 services in \nSuffolk County, Nassau County, and New York City because she cannot independently access 911 \nservices in these municipalities.  (Id. ¶¶ 10, 33, 37.) \nB.    Procedural Background \nIn June 2017, Defendants filed pre-motion conference letters seeking leave to move to \ndismiss the SAC.  (ECF Nos. 24, 25, 26.)  The Court held a pre-motion conference in September \n2017, but suspended motion practice pending settlement discussions because New York City and \nNassau and Suffolk Counties had begun the process of implementing text-to-911 systems that the \nparties believed would result in the resolution of this case.3  (See Minute Entry, Sept. 6, 2017, ECF \nNo.  34.)    Over  the  next  several  months,  the  Court  held  telephone  conferences  to  discuss \nDefendants’ progress, but when settlement discussions had not proved fruitful by March 2018, the \nCourt approved a briefing schedule for the motions to dismiss.  (Electronic Scheduling Order, Mar. \n                                                           \n3  At this September 2017 conference, the attorney for the City Defendants claimed that text-to-911 services in New \nYork City would be rolled out by January 2018.  That estimate proved to be overly optimistic as more than two years \nhave passed since that initially estimated date and New York City has not yet implemented any text-to-911 services.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 4 of 15 PageID #: 477\n28, 2018.)  The three motions to dismiss were fully briefed in September 2018 and remain pending \nbefore the Court.4  (ECF Nos. 51, 53, 57.)   \nIn their reply papers, dated September 4, 2018, the Suffolk County Defendants contended \nthat text-to-911 had already become fully operational in Suffolk County.5  (See Suffolk Cnty. \nDefs.’ Reply Mem. at 5–9, ECF No. 51-10; Matthew Jones Aff. ¶¶ 5–7, 9, Aug. 23, 2018, ECF \nNo. 51-9.)  The Court subsequently became aware that Suffolk County issued a press release \nannouncing the availability of text-to-911 services in November 2018.  Considering this update, \nthe Court held a further status conference in June 2019.  (Status Conf. Tr., June 19, 2019, ECF No. \n62.)  There was confirmation at the conference that Suffolk County had implemented text-to-911 \nservices.  Plaintiff, however, refused to dismiss the case against Suffolk County because Plaintiff’s \nattorney claimed those who would use the text-to-911 services (i.e., those in independent living \ncenters) were unaware of its existence.  (Id. 7:10–8:23.)  In addition, the City Defendants and \nNassau Defendants indicated that their timelines for implementation of text-to-911 services had \nshifted—New York City now claimed a mid-2020 implementation date and Nassau expressed that \ntext-to-911 would be running by December 2019 or January 2020.  (See id. 4:18–6:21, 6:23–7:5.)  \nAccordingly, the Court requested that Plaintiff and the Suffolk Defendants attempt to reach a \nresolution regarding how to educate the public about the availability of text-to-911 in Suffolk \nCounty, and directed the parties to provide substantive status reports by October 2019.  (Id. 11:17–\n22, 13:16–14:11.) \nIn their status report, the City Defendants maintained that an interim text-to-911 system is \n                                                           \n4  The Nassau Defendants, in support of their motion to dismiss, projected a “beneficial use target date” for text-to-\n911 services in Nassau County as the fourth quarter of 2018.  (Aff. in Supp. of Nassau Cnty. Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 6, ECF No. \n57.)  Like the initial estimates provided by New York City, this has also proved to be unrealistic.  \n5  The Suffolk Defendants’ opening papers included an affidavit from the same person, outlining, in detail, the status \nof text-to-911 services in Suffolk County, which indicated that the implementation of these services was close to \ncompletion.  (See Matthew Jones Aff., May 11, 2018, ECF No. 52-1.)   \n4 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 478\nstill on schedule to launch in New York City by Summer 2020.  (ECF No. 63).  The Nassau \nDefendants, however, again changed the targeted completion date for services in Nassau County, \nthis time to late 2020, without including any detail on the steps they are taking to complete the \nproject.  (ECF No. 66.)  Furthermore, Plaintiff and the Suffolk Defendants could not come to a \nresolution, and Plaintiff now requests that the Court rule on the three pending motions to dismiss.  \n(See ECF Nos. 64, 65.)  Accordingly, the Court rules as follows.  \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Standing in ADA and RA Suits  \nArticle III of the United States Constitution limits federal jurisdiction to actual cases and \ncontroversies.  As a result, the question of whether a plaintiff has standing to sue “is the threshold \nquestion in every federal case, determining the power of the court to entertain the suit.”  Warth v. \nSeldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).  “A district court properly dismisses an action under Fed. R. \nCiv.  P.  12(b)(1)  for  lack  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction  if  the  court  ‘lacks  the  statutory  or \nconstitutional power to adjudicate it,’ such as when . . . the plaintiff lacks constitutional standing \nto bring the action.”   Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp. v. Hellas Telecommunications, S.À.R.L., 790 \nF.3d 411, 416–17 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. \n2000)). \nA motion to dismiss for lack of standing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) may be either facial or \nfact-based.  Carter v. HealthPort Technologies, LLC, 822 F.3d 47, 56 (2d Cir. 2016).  “When \nconfronted with a defendant’s facial challenge to standing, i.e., one ‘based solely on the allegations \nof the complaint or the complaint and exhibits attached to it,’ plaintiffs have no evidentiary burden, \nfor both parties can be said to rely solely on the facts as alleged in the plaintiffs’ pleading.”  Katz \nv. Donna Karan Co., L.L.C., 872 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Carter, 822 F.3d at 56.)  \n5 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 479\nHowever, if defendants proffer evidence beyond the plaintiffs’ pleading (i.e., through affidavits or \nexhibits), “[i]n opposition to such a motion, plaintiffs must ‘come forward with evidence of their \nown to controvert that presented by the defendant,’ or may instead ‘rely on the allegations in the[ir \np]leading if the evidence proffered by the defendant is immaterial because it does not contradict \nplausible allegations that are themselves sufficient to show standing.’”  Id. (alteration in original) \n(quoting Carter, 822 F.3d at 57).    \nA plaintiff ultimately bears the burden of demonstrating she has constitutional standing by \nproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, (1) that she suffered an “injury in fact” that is both \n(a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent; (2) a causal relationship between the \ninjury and the challenged conduct; and (3) that the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992); see also Spokeo, Inc. v. \n---------------\nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016).   \nIn ADA and RA cases, “[p]laintiffs seeking injunctive relief must also prove that the \nidentified injury in fact presents a ‘real and immediate threat of future injury,’ often termed ‘a \nlikelihood of future harm.’”6  Bernstein v. City of New York, 621 F. App’x 56, 57 (2d Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 215–16 (2d Cir. 2004)).  As the Second Circuit has found \nin related ADA and RA access cases, a plaintiff has standing to seek “injunctive relief, ‘where \n(1) the plaintiff alleged past injury under the ADA; (2) it was reasonable to infer that the \ndiscriminatory treatment would continue; and (3) it was reasonable to infer, based on the past \nfrequency of plaintiff’s visits and the proximity of defendants’ [services] to plaintiff’s home, that \nplaintiff intended to return to the subject location.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (applying the \n                                                           \n6  As the standards under the RA and ADA “are generally the same and the subtle distinctions between the statutes are \nnot implicated in this case, ‘we treat claims under the two statutes identically.’”  Wright v. New York State Dep’t of \nCorr., 831 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Henrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003)).   \n6 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 480\nstandard where a blind individual alleged that he was prevented from gaining equal or reasonable \naccess to Central Park in violation of the RA and Title II of the ADA) (quoting Kreisler v. Second \nAve. Diner Corp., 731 F.3d 184, 187–88 (2d Cir.2013) (applying the standard in a Title III case to \nfind that an individual who traveled by wheelchair had standing to challenge both the wheelchair-\ninaccessible entrance and the ADA violations inside the diner that related to his disability)).   \nNotably, “[i]n ADA cases, a broad view of constitutional standing is appropriate because \nprivate enforcement suits are the primary method of obtaining compliance with the Act.”  Harty v. \nSpring Valley Marketplace LLC, No. 15-CV-8190, 2017 WL 108062, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, \n2017) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \nB.    Plaintiff Has Standing to Maintain Claims Against the Nassau Defendants \n  The Nassau Defendants contend that Plaintiff cannot show that she has Article III standing \nbecause she did not suffer an “injury in fact,” and has not alleged that she is in danger of a real and \nimmediate threat of future injury in Nassau County.  As outlined below, the Court finds that \nPlaintiff has standing to bring ADA and RA claims against the Nassau Defendants for denying her \nmeaningful access to its 911 services.  \n  In support of their motion, the Nassau Defendants focus on the case Enos v. Arizona, No. \n16-CV-00384, 2017 WL 553039 (D. Ariz. Feb. 10, 2017).  Like Logerfo, the individual plaintiffs \nin Enos were deaf or hard of hearing and alleged that the failure of the State of Arizona and various \nmunicipalities in Arizona to provide text-to-911 services violated the ADA and RA by denying \nthe plaintiffs meaningful access to the defendants’ emergency services.  2017 WL 553039 at *1.  \nThe defendants in Enos argued, in a motion to dismiss, that these individual plaintiffs did not have \nstanding because they suffered no injury in fact and there was no real and immediate threat of \nfuture injury.   Id. at *2.  In denying the motion, the district court in Enos highlighted that the \namended complaint alleged that the plaintiffs (1) lived in fear of being away from their homes and \n7 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 481\nnot being able to access 911 services; (2) are either elderly, care for elderly individuals, and/or \nhave medical conditions making it more likely that they would experience medical emergencies \nand need to contact 911; and (3) included some allegations of past inabilities to communicate with \n911 operators.  Id. at *4–5.  The court held that the allegations of past injuries (being unable to \ncommunicate with 911 operators), when coupled with the allegations supporting an inference of a \nlikelihood of threat of repetition (plaintiffs’ ages and/or medical conditions), supported a finding \nthat the plaintiffs’ injuries were sufficiently imminent to confer Article III standing.  Id. at *5.   \nThe Nassau Defendants argue that following this line of reasoning leads to a finding that \nPlaintiff does not have standing because she has not alleged that she was denied access to 911 \nservices after calling Nassau County 911, nor does the SAC allege that Plaintiff is in danger of \nactual or imminent repeated injury.  (Nassau Cnty. Defs.’s Mem. at 9–11, ECF No. 57-1.)   \nPlaintiff, in her opposition, relies on Enos as well as Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of the \nDisabled v. Bloomberg, in which individuals with disabilities sued New York City and its mayor \nin the aftermath of Hurricane Irene on the basis that the city’s emergency and disaster preparedness \nplans violated the ADA and RA by failing to address the needs of persons with disabilities.  290 \nF.R.D. 409 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).  The defendants in Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of the Disabled argued \nthat the individual plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they were injured during Hurricane Irene in \na way that was traceable to the City’s emergency planning or procedures, so they had not alleged \nan “injury in fact.”  Id. at 413.  The district court rejected this argument, instead stressing that the \nindividual plaintiffs’ ongoing injury was that “they have been, and continue to be, deprived of \nbenefits afforded to other citizens—namely, the benefits of an adequate emergency preparedness \nprogram.”  Id. at 414.  The court highlighted the severity of the threat of the future harm—that \nanother disaster will inevitably occur and seriously affect the plaintiffs—and that a court would be \n8 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 482\nin no better position later to resolve the claims, in finding that the plaintiffs had standing to bring \nthe suit.  Id. at 415.   \nBoth Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of the Disabled and Enos are instructive here. Plaintiff \nalleges that she suffered a prior injury in Nassau County as a result of the lack of text-to-911 \nservices because she could not communicate with the 911 operator.7  (SAC ¶¶ 27–32.)  She also \nexplains that her “injury in fact” is the continuing deprivation of the benefits of 911 services in \nNassau County that are available to other citizens.  (SAC ¶¶ 52, 53, 58; Pl.’s Mem., at 4–7, ECF \nNo. 55.)  Clearly, the lack of access to 911 services, like the lack of access to an emergency \npreparedness program, threatens a particularly severe harm because 911 is meant to be used in \nemergency circumstances, so being prevented from accessing it can have similar catastrophic \nconsequences.  While Plaintiff is not a resident of Nassau County, her proximity to Nassau County \nas a resident of a bordering county, coupled with her specific prior injury in Nassau County and \nthe magnitude of the potential future injury, supports a finding that future injury is sufficiently \nimminent to bring a claim for injunctive relief under the ADA and RA.8  Indeed, the Court “would \nbe in no better position later than now to resolve the claims presented” because “to conclude \notherwise would be perverse, as it would mean that [Plaintiff] could bring [her] claim only after” \n                                                           \n7  The Nassau Defendants argue that Plaintiff was not actually injured because she was reporting a car fire in which \nshe was not physically harmed, nor does she contend that emergency services were not dispatched to address the issue.  \n(Nassau Cnty. Defs.’ Mem. at 8.)  However, Plaintiff’s representation that she was unable to communicate with the \n911 operator sufficiently alleges a concrete injury suffered by Plaintiff in Nassau County because she was denied the \nfull benefits of its 911 services.   \n8  In their motion papers, the Nassau Defendants include an affidavit from Nassau County Police Lieutenant Israel \nSantiago which states that Nassau County is in the process of implementing text-to-911 capability with a “projected \n‘beneficial use’ target date [of[ the fourth quarter of 2018.”  (Aff. in Supp. of Nassau Cnty. Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 6.)  This \naffidavit, while appropriately considered in a fact-based Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenging standing, does not \ncontradict Plaintiff’s allegations of ongoing harm (or threat of future harm) because the statements by Lieutenant \nSantiago are too vague and conclusory to concretely demonstrate that Nassau County’s text-to-911 services will be \nimminently available such that a ruling by this Court will not redress Plaintiff’s injury.  Indeed, Nassau County still \nhas not implemented text-to-911 services.  For similar reasons, the Nassau Defendants cannot demonstrate that the \nclaims against them are moot.    \n9 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 483\nsuffering  an  extreme  emergency  in  which  she  was  unable  access  911  emergency  services.  \nBrooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of the Disabled, 290 F.R.D. at 415. \nFurthermore, there is a causal relationship between Plaintiff’s alleged injury and Nassau \nCounty’s lack of text-to-911 services because (1) she claims she was unable to communicate \ncrucial information to the 911 operator to report the car on fire because she could not understand \nthe questions posed; and (2) she alleges that she cannot communicate via telephone with a 911 \noperator and primarily communicates through, inter alia, text messages.  Thus, if Plaintiff obtains \na favorable decision and the Court directs Nassau County to provide text-to-911 services, Plaintiff \nwill be able to access emergency services in Nassau County via text message, remedying her \nalleged  injury.    Accordingly,  Plaintiff  has  sufficiently  alleged  standing  to  sue  the  Nassau \nDefendants for violations of the ADA and RA \nC.    The Suffolk Defendants’ Motion is Denied Without Prejudice \nPlaintiff concedes that text-to-911 services now exist in Suffolk County.  The Suffolk \nDefendants contend this admission moots Plaintiff’s claims against them, but Plaintiff is not \nwilling to dismiss the Suffolk Defendants because Plaintiff’s counsel, Disability Rights New York, \nclaims that its constituents and contacts at local independent living centers are unaware of the \nservice’s availability.9  (See Status Conf. Tr., 7:10–8:23; ECF Nos. 64, 65.)  The question of \nwhether Plaintiff had standing to sue the Suffolk Defendants when she commenced her case is a \nclose one.  However, “[a] core element of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement is that the \ncase remains ‘alive at all stages of judicial proceedings’ because ‘[i]f events subsequent to the \n                                                           \n9  It is not clear to the Court how this concern has any bearing on Plaintiff’s claims against the Suffolk Defendants. \nDisability Rights New York is not a plaintiff in this action, nor was this case filed as a putative class action.  Nothing \nin the SAC mentions outreach, nor does Plaintiff explain how the press release, which was reported on by various \nnews outlets, such as Newsday and the NY Post, did not sufficiently inform Suffolk County residents of the availability \nof text-to-911 services.  Plainly, Plaintiff is aware of its availability, as her attorneys acknowledged its existence at \nthe status conference.   \n10 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 484\nfiling of a lawsuit resolve the controversy, the case should be dismissed as moot.’”  Delaware \nRiverkeeper Network v. New York State Dep’t of Envtl. Conservation, 788 F. App’x 65, 66 (2d \nCir. 2019) (alteration in original) (quoting Deeper Life Christian Fellowship, Inc. v. Sobol, 948 \nF.2d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 1991)).  Thus, mootness is a further threshold jurisdictional question that this \nCourt must address before Plaintiff can continue this suit.  The Court will only address standing if \nthe Court is first satisfied that Plaintiff’s claims against the Suffolk Defendants are not moot. \nWhile Plaintiff’s claims against the Suffolk Defendants appear to be moot, the parties have \nnot fully addressed the mootness issue.  The Suffolk Defendants only reported that text-to-911 was \nfully operational in Suffolk County in its reply papers and Plaintiff has not filed any formal \nresponse addressing mootness.  Accordingly, the Court denies the Suffolk Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss for lack of standing without prejudice.  Plaintiff is ordered to show cause, in writing by \nJune 8, 2020 why her claims against the Suffolk Defendants should not be dismissed as moot.  The \nSuffolk Defendants shall file opposition papers by July 8, 2020 and Plaintiff can file a reply by \nJuly 22, 2020. \nD.  Plaintiff’s Claims Against the City Defendants are Dismissed \nAlthough it is undoubtedly important that New York City provide text-to-911 access to its \nemergency services, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that she has standing to maintain her ADA \nand RA claims against the City Defendants.10  Plaintiff again contends that it is “the ongoing \ndeprivation of her rights to equal access to the benefit of 911 services” in New York City that \ndemonstrates she has a concrete and particularized injury in fact and likelihood of an imminent \n                                                           \n10  The Court notes that text-to-911 services would not only benefit those with hearing impairments.  There are \nundoubtedly scenarios in which someone who can ordinarily communicate via telephone may need to access 911 \nservices but be unable to safely make a phone call.  For example, text-to-911 could potentially be lifesaving in certain \ndomestic violence or home robbery situations.  While Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue a suit against the City \nDefendants, the Court urges New York City to prioritize access to text-to-911 for all New York City residents and \nvisitors.  However, the Court also recognizes the extreme challenges faced by the City Defendants in the current \nCOVID-19 pandemic, which might further delay the planned rollout of its text-to-911 services.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 485\nfuture injury.11  (Pl.’s Mem. at 4–5.)  However, Plaintiff does not allege any pertinent connection \nto New York City to support her argument—the only link to New York City in the SAC is a single, \nconclusory, allegation that Plaintiff “travels throughout New York City and Long Island.”  (SAC \n¶ 11.)  Plaintiff does not contend that she ever called, attempted to call, or desired to call 911 while \nin New York City.  \nThus, Plaintiff cannot rely on Enos or Brooklyn Ctr. for Indep. of the Disabled to establish \nstanding to sue the City Defendants for multiple reasons.  First, Plaintiff’s past injury in Nassau \nCounty does not lend any support to a finding that Plaintiff will face a likelihood of future injury \nin New York City without text-to-911 services.  See Enos, 2017 WL 553039 at *5.  Critically, \nPlaintiff  does  not  reside  in  New  York  City  and  her  residence  in  Suffolk  County  is  not \ngeographically close enough to establish that she suffers an ongoing injury that is “certainly \nimpending” and “particularly severe” because she is allegedly unable to access New York City’s \n911 services. 12  Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled, 290 F.R.D. at 415.  Moreover, \nPlaintiff’s failure to allege any connection to New York City’s emergency services greatly \nundercuts her claim that “there is no better time” to address her access to 911 services in New \nYork City.  Id.   \nIn sum, the SAC fails to demonstrate that Plaintiff suffered an injury in fact in New York \n                                                           \n11  In addition to arguing that Plaintiff lacks standing for failing to allege an injury in fact, the City Defendants contend \nthat Plaintiff is provided meaningful access to its 911 services through the street emergency alarm boxes maintained \nby New York City.  (See Mem. in Supp. of City Defs.’ Mot., at 9–12, ECF No. 54.)  As the City points out, a permanent \ninjunction in the Southern District of New York enjoins the City from removing the alarm boxes so that those who \nare deaf or hard of hearing can access its 911 system.  Because the Court finds that Plaintiff does not have standing \neven without considering the import of the alarm boxes, the Court need not address the City Defendants’ argument \nthat the presence of the 911 alarm boxes is fatal to Plaintiff’s claims.  Nor is it necessary to address the City \nDefendants’ related argument that collateral estoppel and res judicata preclude Plaintiff’s claims because Plaintiff was \na presumptive class member in the class action for injunctive relief.  (See id. at 12–14.) \n12  Notably, the district court in Brooklyn Center for Independence of the Disabled applied a particularly expansive \nview of standing in finding that the individual plaintiffs could maintain their ADA and RA claims.  Even under this \nmore expansive analysis, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that she has standing to maintain ADA and RA claims against \nthe City Defendants.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 486\nCity, that she faces real and immediate threat of future injury, or that there is any causal \nrelationship between the lack of text-to-911 services in New York City and any injury to Plaintiff.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff has  not established that  she has Article  III  standing to sue the City \nDefendants under the ADA or RA and the claims against the City Defendants are dismissed.13    \nE.    The Claims Against the Nassau County Individual Defendants are Dismissed \nFinally, the Court will address the Nassau Defendants’ argument that the claims against \nthe individual defendants should be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).14   \nPlaintiff asserts that her official capacity claims against the individual defendants named \nin the SAC should stand.  (Pl.’s Mem. at 12–13.)  The Nassau Defendants respond that any claims \nagainst the individual defendants in their official capacity are duplicative of claims against the \ncounties themselves, and thus must be dismissed.15  (Nassau Cnty. Defs.’ Mem. at 12–13.)  \nPlaintiff does not respond to the redundancy argument or the cases Defendants cite that dismiss \nindividual defendants on that basis.  Instead, Plaintiff merely claims that because the individual \ndefendants are sued in their official capacities and serve as agents of the entities they represent, \nthey may be sued under the ADA.  (Pl.’s Mem. at 12–13.)  The Court finds that Plaintiff’s claims \nagainst the individual defendants in their official capacities are clearly duplicative of the claims \nagainst the defendants the County of Nassau, New York and the Nassau County Office of \n                                                           \n13  For the avoidance of doubt, all of Plaintiff’s claims against the City of New York and Bill de Blasio in his official \ncapacity as Mayor, City of New York and City of New York Police Department and James P. O Neill in his official \ncapacity as Commissioner, City of New York Police Department are dismissed for lack of standing.   \n14  The Court does not address the Suffolk Defendants’ claims that the Suffolk County entities and individual \ndefendants should be dismissed because, as outlined above, the Court will first determine whether the claims against \nthe Suffolk Defendants are moot.  Accordingly, the entire motion by the Suffolk Defendants is denied without \nprejudice.  Nonetheless, the same analysis as to the Nassau County individual defendants would apply to the Suffolk \nCounty individual defendants.  \n15  Plaintiff only sues the individual defendants in their official capacities and does not argue these defendants are \nsubject to individual liability.  In any event, any individual capacity suit would be fruitless because “it is well-\nestablished that there is no individual liability under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, whether the individual is sued \nin their official or individual capacity.”  Perros v.

Sept. 17, 2012).  Accordingly, the claims against Edward P. \nMangano in his official capacity as County Executive, County of Nassau, New York and Craig J. \nCraft, in his official capacity as Commissioner, Nassau County Office of Emergency Management, \nare dismissed as redundant.16 \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Nassau  Defendants’  motion  is  DENIED  in  part  and \nGRANTED in part.  The Clerk of the Court shall dismiss Edward P. Mangano in his official \ncapacity as County Executive, County of Nassau, New York and Craig J. Craft, in his official \ncapacity as Commissioner, Nassau County Office of Emergency Management from the suit.   \nFurthermore, the Suffolk Defendants’ motion is DENIED without prejudice to allow the \nparties to address whether Plaintiff’s claims are moot.  Plaintiff is ordered to show cause, in writing \nby June 8, 2020 why her claims against the Suffolk Defendants should not be dismissed as moot.  \nThe Suffolk Defendants shall file opposition papers by July 8, 2020 and Plaintiff can file a reply \nby July 22, 2020.  \n                                                           \n16  In their Preliminary Statements, the Nassau Defendants assert that “any claims against the Nassau County Office \nof Emergency Management must be dismissed since [it] is an administrative arm of the County of Nassau with no \nlegal identity separate and apart from Nassau County.”  (Nassau Cnty. Defs.’ Mem. at 2; Nassau Cnty. Defs.’ Reply \nMem. at 1, ECF No. 57-3.)  However, the Nassau Defendants failed to address this point in the Argument sections of \ntheir briefs.  Accordingly, while Plaintiff conceded that the Suffolk County Office of Emergency Management was a \nnon-suable entity, she did not make the same concession with respect to the Nassau County Office of Emergency \nManagement.  Considering the Nassau Defendants’ failure to fully articulate their argument for dismissal to allow \nPlaintiff to respond to that claim, the Court will not dismiss the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management at \nthis time.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 2:17-cv-00010-JMA-AYS   Document 67   Filed 05/08/20   Page 15 of 15 PageID #: 488\nFinally, the City Defendants’ motion is GRANTED in full and the City Defendants are \ndismissed from this suit.   \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  May 8, 2020       \nCentral Islip, New York                                    \n                 /s/ (JMA)                          \n  JOAN M.
