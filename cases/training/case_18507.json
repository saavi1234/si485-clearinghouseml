On March 5, 2012, Ohio Legal Rights Service (OLRS), Ohio&rsquo;s P&amp;A, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. OLRS alleged that Columbus City Schools (Columbus) violated the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act) when they refused to provide OLRS with records related to the seclusion of a high school student. Judge Gregory L. Frost presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>This case arose after a parent informed OLRS that a Columbus school placed their child in a seclusion room and that the child was afraid to return to school. The parent alleged that other students were secluded as well. OLRS requested records related to the seclusion and a copy of the school&rsquo;s seclusion log to identify other impact students. Columbus said there were no seclusion log records, and refused to give OLRS parent directory information for students with disabilities who were secluded. OLRS sought declaratory relief that Columbus violated the DD Act, and injunctive relief to receive the records in question. On June 26, 2012, OLRS filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the action, which the court granted on June 27, 2012.&nbsp; The case was closed on June 29, 2012.</p>",
