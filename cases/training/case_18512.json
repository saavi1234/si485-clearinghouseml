The plaintiff, a high school student with an intellectual disability, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on February 3, 2014, against Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities and several of its officers. Represented by counsel from Disability Rights Ohio, the plaintiff sought a reversal of the fair hearing decision that denied him participation in a comprehensive transition program. He alleged that the fair hearing decision violated the procedural requirements of the Rehabilitation Act and associated regulations. He also claimed that the decision itself denied him access to vocational rehabilitation services because of his disability in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiff sought a reversal of the fair hearing decision that denied his participation in the Comprehensive Transition Program, an invalidation of the VR policy denying participation in such programs, a change in the plaintiff&rsquo;s employment goal so that it more effectively aligns with his interests, skills and abilities as well as attorney fees based upon the denial of his rights under the Rehabilitation Act.

Miller, in his official capacity,  :   \n  :   \n  Defendants.  :   \n     \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  Each paragraph in this Complaint incorporates all others. \n2.  This case involves the efforts of Peter Merz, a recent high school graduate with an \nintellectual disability, to receive support for post-secondary educational training from Ohioโs \nstate vocational rehabilitation agency, Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities (โOODโ), \nBureau of Vocational Rehabilitation (โBVRโ), in order to prepare for competitive and gainful \nemployment. \n3.  As the designated vocational rehabilitation agency for Ohio, OOD is charged with \ndetermining on an individual basis, together with the eligible individual, what vocational \nrehabilitation services would enable the individual to become competitively employed. \n4.  In light of data showing that students with intellectual disabilities achieve far \nbetter competitive employment outcomes with post-secondary training, Congress and the U.S. \nDepartment of Education recently established comprehensive post-secondary transition programs \nfor students with intellectual disabilities (โComprehensive Transition Programsโ), which provide \n{00068666-5}   \n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:144-c-cvv-0-000110033-W-KOLLB  DDoocc  ##::  31 -F2i lFedile: d0:2 0/013/3/114/1 P4a Pgaeg: e2:  o2f  o2f5 2  5P A PGAEGIDE I#D:  #3:8 6\nacademic, vocational, and independent living training to prepare students with intellectual \ndisabilities for competitive employment. \n5.  While post-secondary training is a vocational rehabilitation service available for \nother consumers, OOD has effectively barred students with intellectual disabilities from post-\nsecondary training through a statewide policy refusing to provide support for Comprehensive \nTransition Programs, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. \n6.  Recognizing that he needed additional training to make the transition from school \nto work, Peter applied to OOD for vocational rehabilitation services as a high school senior and \nsubsequently enrolled in the University of Cincinnatiโs Transition and Access Program (TAP), a \nfour year Comprehensive Transition Program providing academic, vocational, and independent \nliving training for transition students with intellectual disabilities. \n7.  Soon after he was found eligible for services, Peter expressed interest in a career \nrelated to sports and identified the transition services provided by the TAP program as vocational \nrehabilitation services necessary for him to reach his employment goal. \n8.  More than thirteen months after he first applied for services, OOD informed Peter \nthat it would not support his participation in the TAP program, and Peter was given the choice of \neither dropping out of the TAP program and seeking immediate job placement or having his case \nwith the agency closed. \n9.  Peter appealed Defendantsโ decision to deny support for the TAP program and \nclose his case, and pursuant to 29 U.S.C. ยง 722(c)(5) a Fair Hearing was held on December 2 and \n17, 2013.  A decision was rendered on January 16, 2014, denying Peterโs appeal. \n10.  Peter files this civil action for de novo review of that decision pursuant to \n29 U.S.C. ยง 722(c)(5)(J) and relief under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 794. \n{00068666-5}  2 \n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:144-c-cvv-0-000110033-W-KOLLB  DDoocc  ##::  31 -F2i lFedile: d0:2 0/013/3/114/1 P4a Pgaeg: e3:  o3f  o2f5 2  5P A PGAEGIDE I#D:  #3:9 7\nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This cause of action is found at 29 U.S.C. ยง 722(c)(5)(J), which allows for a civil \naction to be filed without regard to the amount in controversy. \n12.  This Court also has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331, \ngeneral federal question jurisdiction, because the Plaintiffโs claims arise under federal statute:  \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n13.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b)(1) venue lies in the Southern District of Ohio \nbecause a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in \nHamilton County. \nIII.  PARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff, Peter Merz, is a disabled individual residing in Cincinnati, Ohio. \n15.  OOD is the designated state unit in Ohio that provides vocational rehabilitation \nservices to persons with disabilities pursuant to Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as \namended.  29 U.S.C. ยง 701, et seq. \n16.  Defendant, Kevin L. Miller, was appointed by the Governor to be the executive \nand administrative officer of OOD, and is charged with devoting his full time to running that \noffice pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code ยง 3304.15. \nIV.  FACTS \n17.  The administrative record, which Defendants must file with this Court pursuant to \n29 U.S.C. ยง 722(c)(5)(J), is hereby incorporated by reference. \nBackground \n18.  Peter was born with Down Syndrome, and due to his disability, he has cognitive \nimpairments and communication limitations. \n19.  Peter attended Oak Hills High School, a large public high school near Cincinnati, \n{00068666-5}  3 \n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:144-c-cvv-0-000110033-W-KOLLB  DDoocc  ##::  31 -F2i lFedile: d0:2 0/013/3/114/1 P4a Pgaeg: e4:  o4f  o2f5 2  5P A PGAEGIDE I#D:  #4:0 8\nwhere he was educated pursuant to an individualized education plan (IEP) under the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). \n20.  Peter excelled in high school, attending integrated classes, and participating in \nextracurricular activities with non-disabled peers. \n21.  As required by the IDEA, during his senior year in high school Peter, his parents, \nand school district officials including both general and special education teachers, began \nplanning to prepare a transition IEP detailing Peterโs goals following high school and the \nservices he would need to achieve them.  (Appellant Ex. B.)1 \n22.  Peterโs goal following high school was to obtain competitive employment in order \nto support himself and live independently, and as part of the transition process, Peter began to \nexplore his career options. \n23.  After serving as the equipment manager for his high school basketball team, Peter \nbecame interested in pursuing a career related to sports. \n24.  However, due to his cognitive disability, Peter had difficulty with independent \nproblem solving, and also required additional training in life skills, independent living, and \norganization in order to prepare for competitive employment that suited his interests. \n25.  Peter considered local job training programs for students with intellectual \ndisabilities, but found that they did not meet his needs because they were focused on low-wage \nand low skilled janitorial positions, were segregated, had poor employment outcomes, and did \nnot provide the independent living skills he needed. \n26.  Ultimately Peter, his parents, and school district officials all agreed that Peter \nneeded post-secondary training following high school graduation to reach his goal of obtaining \n                                                 \n1  References to Appellant Ex. ___ are to the Plaintiffโs exhibits from the formal hearing, which are included in the \nadministrative record which Defendants must file with this Court pursuant to 29 U.S.C. ยง 722(c)(5)(J). \n{00068666-5}  4 \n\nCCaassee: :1 1:1:144-c-cvv-0-000110033-W-KOLLB  DDoocc  ##::  31 -F2i lFedile: d0:2 0/013/3/114/1 P4a Pgaeg: e5:  o5f  o2f5 2  5P A PGAEGIDE I#D:  #4:1 9\ncompetitive employment, and college training in a supported environment was included on \nPeterโs transition IEP. \n27.  Because Peter intended to pursue competitive employment, his high school \nreferred him to OOD for vocational rehabilitation services pursuant to an interagency agreement \nfor transition planning between the Ohio Department of Education and Opportunities for \nOhioans with Disabilities. \nVocational Rehabilitation \n28.  The purpose of the Rehabilitation Act, as set forth in 29 U.S.C. ยง 701, et seq. is to \nempower individuals with disabilities to maximize employment, economic self-sufficiency, \nindependence, inclusion, and integration into society. \n29.  In order to prepare individuals with disabilities for gainful employment, the \nRehabilitation Act created a comprehensive program for vocational rehabilitation, providing \nfederal funding to states to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services \nfor individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, \nabilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice. \n30.  State participation in the federal vocational rehabilitation program is voluntary, \nbut states choosing to participate must comply with federal law and regulations under Section \n720 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n31.  OOD is the designated state unit in Ohio that provides vocational rehabilitation \nservices to persons with disabilities pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act 29 U.S.C. ยง 701, et seq., \nand BVR is the division of OOD that provides rehabilitation services to individuals, like the \nPlaintiff, whose disabilities are not blindness or other visual impairment. \n32.  Once an individual has been found eligible for services, an individualized plan for \nemployment (IPE) must be developed and implemented in a timely manner.  34 C.F.R. ยง \n{00068666-5}  5 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 6:  6o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 210\n361.45(a)(1). \n33.  The IPE must contain โ. . . a description of the specific employment outcome that \nis chosen by the eligible individual,โ and โa description of the specific vocational rehabilitation \nservices that are . . . needed to achieve the employment outcome.โ  29 U.S.C. ยง 722(b)(3)(A)-\n(B). \n34.  Vocational rehabilitation services provided under 29 U.S.C. ยง 720, et seq. โare \nany services described in an individualized plan for employment necessary to assist an individual \nwith a disability in preparing for, securing, retaining, or regaining an employment outcome . . . \nincluding . . . an assessment for determining . . . [the] vocational rehabilitation needsโ of the \nindividual.  29 U.S.C. ยง 723(a)(1). \n35.  Additionally, an IPE โshall be developed and implemented in a manner that \naffords eligible individuals the opportunity to exercise informed choice in selecting an \nemployment outcome, the specific vocational rehabilitation services to be provided under the \nplan, the entity that will provide the vocational rehabilitation services, and the methods used to \nprocure the services . . . .โ  29 U.S.C. ยง 722(b)(2)(B). \n36.  Federal regulations require each state unit to enter into an interagency agreement \nwith public education officials โ. . . designed to facilitate the transition of students with \ndisabilities from the receipt of educational services in school to the receipt of vocational \nrehabilitation services under the responsibility of the designated State agency.โ  34 C.F.R. ยง \n361.22(a). \n37.  The interagency agreement must โ. . . provide for the development and approval \nof an individualized plan for employment in accordance with ยง 361.45 as early as possible during \nthe transition planning process but, at the latest, by the time each student determined to be \n{00068666-5}  6 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 7:  7o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 311\neligible for vocational rehabilitation services leaves the school setting . . . .โ  34 C.F.R. ยง \n361.22(a). \n38.  An IPE for a student receiving special education services must be developed in \nconsideration of the studentโs individualized education plan.  34 C.F.R. ยง 361.45(d)(8)(i). \n39.  Federal regulations require that: \n[a]s  appropriate  to  the  vocational  rehabilitation  needs  of  each \nindividual and consistent with each individualโs informed choice, \nthe designated State unit must ensure that the following vocational \nrehabilitation services are available to assist the individual with a \ndisability  in  preparing  for,  securing,  retaining,  or  regaining  an \nemployment  outcome  that  is  consistent  with  the  individualโs \nstrengths,  resources,  priorities,  concerns,  abilities,  capabilities, \ninterests, and informed choice:  \n. . . \n(c) Vocational rehabilitation counseling and guidance, including \ninformation  and  support  services  to  assist  an  individual  in \nexercising informed choice in accordance with ยง 361.52. \n. . . \n(f) Vocational and other training services, including personal and \nvocational  adjustment  training,  books,  tools,  and  other  training \nmaterials . . . \n. . . \n(r) Transition services in accordance with the definition of that \nterm in ยง 361.5(b)(55). \n \n34 C.F.R. ยง 361.48. \n \n40.  Transition services are defined in the Rehabilitation Act as  \n[a] coordinated set of activities for a student, designed within an \noutcome-oriented process that promotes movement from school to \npost school activities including postsecondary education, \nvocational training, integrated employment (including supported \nemployment), continuing and adult education, adult services, \nindependent living, or community participation. The coordinated \nset of activities shall be based upon the individual studentโs needs, \ntaking into account the studentโs preferences and interests, and \nshall include instruction, community experiences, the development \nof employment and other post school adult living objectives, and \nwhen appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional \nvocational evaluation. \n{00068666-5}  7 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 8:  8o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 412\n \n29 U.S.C. ยง 705(37) (emphasis added); see also 29 U.S.C. ยง 723(a)(13); 34 C.F.R. ยง \n361.5(b)(55); Ohio Admin. Code ยง 3304-2-59(14); compare with 20 U.S.C. ยง 1401(34) (defining \ntransition services under the IDEA). \n \nTransition Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities \n41.  Individuals with intellectual disabilities have historically had a disproportionately \nlow rate of employment, and those who are employed are far more likely to work in sheltered \nworkshops paying subminimum wages than in competitive employment in an integrated setting. \n42.  In light of evidence that competitive employment outcomes are significantly \nhigher for individuals with intellectual disabilities who receive some post-secondary training, in \n2008, Congress passed the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA), which charged \nthe U.S. Department of Education with creating Comprehensive Transition Programs to provide \npost-secondary training for transition students with intellectual disabilities to prepare for gainful \nemployment. \n43.  Pursuant to the HEOA, the Department of Education designated a coordinating \ncenter, Think College, to promulgate standards and best practices for Comprehensive Transition \nPrograms, awarded grants for the creation of model programs across the country, and announced \nrules for these programs to qualify for federal financial student aid.   \n44.  U.S. Department of Education issued regulations, codified at 34 C.F.R. ยง 668.231, \ndefining โcomprehensive transition programโ as follows: \n(a) Comprehensive transition and postsecondary program means a \ndegree, certificate, nondegree, or noncertificate program thatโ \n(1) Is offered by a participating institution; \n(2)  Is  delivered  to  students  physically  attending  the \ninstitution; \n(3)  Is  designed  to  support  students  with  intellectual \ndisabilities  who  are  seeking  to  continue  academic,  career  and \ntechnical, and independent living instruction at an institution of \nhigher education in order to prepare for gainful employment; \n(4) Includes an advising and curriculum structure; \n{00068666-5}  8 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 9:  9o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 513\n(5) Requires students with intellectual disabilities to have at \nleast one-half of their participation in the program, as determined \nby the institution, focus on academic components through one or \nmore of the following activities: \n(i)  Taking  credit-bearing  courses  with  students  without \ndisabilities. \n(ii)  Auditing  or  otherwise  participating  in  courses  with \nstudents without disabilities for which the student does not receive \nregular academic credit. \n(iii)  Taking  non-credit-bearing,  nondegree  courses  with \nstudents without disabilities. \n(iv) Participating in internships or work-based training in \nsettings with individuals without disabilities; and \n(6)  Provides  students  with  intellectual  disabilities \nopportunities to participate in coursework and other activities with \nstudents without disabilities. \n \n34 C.F.R. ยง 668.231. \n \n45.  The HEOA further requires that Comprehensive Transition Programs must offer a \nmeaningful credential to students completing the program.  20 U.S.C. ยง 1140g(d)(8). \n46.  The HEOA contemplates coordination with state vocational rehabilitation \nagencies by giving preference for grants to model Comprehensive Transition Programs which \nhave developed partnerships with state vocational rehabilitation agencies.  20 U.S.C. ยง \n1140g(c)(3)(A). \nUniversity of Cincinnatiโs TAP Program \n47.  In 2012, the University of Cincinnati launched the Transition and Access Program \n(TAP), a Comprehensive Transition Program for students with intellectual disabilities, funded in \npart by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education pursuant to the HEOA. \n48.  The University of Cincinnati is a state-chartered university accredited by the \nHigher Learning Commission (HLC). \n49.  Now in its second year, the TAP program trains students with intellectual \ndisabilities for gainful employment by providing college classes, including classes in an \n{00068666-5}  9 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 01 0o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 614\nintegrated setting with nondisabled students; training in independent living skills through a \nresidential program; and four required paid internships with support provided by program staff. \n50.  The TAP program is housed within the University of Cincinnatiโs School of \nEducation, and it is staffed by faculty of the school, licensed special education teachers, and \ngraduate instructors. \n51.  The TAP program provides academic advising to each student to identify career \ngoals and interests, and tailors the studentโs academic coursework and internship placements to \nprepare the student to meet his or her career goals. \n52.  TAP students are required to complete a series of four paid internships in an \nintegrated setting, so that students gain exposure to a variety of employers and office settings and \ndevelop additional workplace skills and experience. \n53.  At the conclusion of the four year course, students receive a certificate of \ncompletion, and they have references and a digital portfolio documenting their work history and \nemployment skills. \n54.  The TAP program adheres to the standards and best practices promulgated by the \nDepartment of Educationโs designated coordinating center, and the TAP program also complies \nwith Department of Education regulations for comprehensive transition programs, and the \nprogram is now preparing to submit its application for certification to the Department of \nEducation to qualify for federal student aid. \nPeterโs Participation in the TAP Program \n55.  During the spring of 2012, before high school graduation, Peter applied and was \nadmitted to the TAP program at the University of Cincinnati. \n56.  Soon after he enrolled, Peter met with counselors from the TAP program to \nidentify his career interests and to tailor a course of study and work experiences to prepare for \n{00068666-5}  10 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 11 1o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 715\ngainful employment. \n57.  Because Peter expressed an interest in a career related to sports, counselors with \nthe TAP program helped him design a specific program of academic, vocational, and \nindependent living skills necessary for him to achieve his career goal. \n58.  In his first year and a half of the TAP program, Peter has completed courses \nfocusing on job skills such as preparing a resume, interviewing, and workplace expectations, and \nindependent living skills such as managing money. \n59.  Peter has also enrolled in academic courses related to sports with non-disabled \nUniversity of Cincinnati students, in order to develop his knowledge about a variety of sports. \n60.  In order to become qualified for a wider range of jobs related to sports by \ndeveloping skills and experience in office work, Peter completed a paid internship with the \nUniversity of Cincinnati Psychology Department with the assistance of job coaches from the \nTAP program during the spring semester of his first year. \n61.  Beginning in his second year, Peter moved on campus to an integrated dorm with \nnondisabled students, and he has continued his academic, vocational, and independent living \ntraining through the TAP program. \n62.  Following his internship with the Psychology Department his first year, Peter was \nable to land a paid internship in an athletic department for the second semester of his sophomore \nyear. \n63.  Peterโs income is limited to SSI and his wages from his paid internships through \nthe TAP program, and his assets are extremely limited. \n64.  Without support from the vocational rehabilitation agencies, Peter has been forced \nto rely on financial contributions from family members to attend the TAP program. \n{00068666-5}  11 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 21 2o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 816\nApplication for Vocational Rehabilitation Services \n65.  In his final semester of high school, Peter applied for vocational rehabilitation \nservices on April 24, 2012, and was found eligible for services soon after graduation, on July 2, \n2012.  (Appellant Ex. A.) \n66.  After Peter was found eligible for services, OOD assigned him to a vocational \nrehabilitation counselor, Chrystal Hutzel, who began a comprehensive assessment to determine \nPeterโs vocational rehabilitation needs by gathering information from Peter and his mother, \nincluding Peterโs IEP from high school, and information about the TAP program. \n67.  On August 8, 2012, Ms. Hutzel made a referral to Goodwill Industries for Peter to \nparticipate in a vocational community based assessment. \n68.  In her referral, Ms. Hutzel documented Peterโs participation in the TAP program \nin order to obtain competitive employment with the following notes:  โGraduating this year . . . \nplans to go to UC.  Goals of school are photography and Math . . . wants to get a jobโ and โ4 \nyear program but it will be a certificate.  You take classes for audit.  It will be life skills (2) \ncourses and 2 regular courses.  It will involve an internship component that begins in the 2nd \nsemester.โ  (Appellant Ex. D.) \n69.  Noting that โPeter would like to find a part time job working in a sports related \nenvironment,โ the Goodwill decided to place Peter in a janitorial position at a local YMCA \nfocused exclusively on picking up trash and cleaning.  Id. \n70.  After Peter completed the assessment, the Goodwill concluded in its report that \nPeter was not interested in janitorial work, and recommended that Peter participate in other work \nexperiences and continue his enrollment in the TAP program, finding โit was evident that his \ncollege program is of great importance to him.  Also a post high school education will open the \ndoors for Peter when looking for employment.โ  Id. \n{00068666-5}  12 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 31 3o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 4: 917\n71.  Following the community based assessment, OOD provided Peter with no further \ncounseling or guidance to exercise informed choice in selecting an employment outcome, and the \nagency failed to timely develop and implement an IPE for Peter. \n72.  At a meeting with his counselor following the community based assessment, Peter \ninformed Ms. Hutzel that he was not interested in janitorial work and when other job tryouts \nwere discussed, Peter noted that he was in the process of interviewing for a paid internship for \nthe spring semester through the TAP program. \n73.  During this meeting, Ms. Hutzel informed Peter that she was considering closing \nhis case with the agency until after he completed school, but at Peterโs request, she agreed to \nlook into whether OOD could support Peterโs participation in the TAP program, but no \nconclusion was reached.   \n74.  Despite Peterโs expression of interest in an employment goal of a career related to \nsports, neither Ms. Hutzel nor anyone else at OOD engaged in further discussion with Peter or \nindicated disagreement with this employment goal. \n75.  Six months later, Peter and his mother met again with his counselor and provided \nan update on Peterโs progress in the TAP program. \n76.  Peter reported that he had successfully completed a paid internship as an office \nworker with the Psychology Department, and that he was able to learn the job and succeed with \nthe supports provided by the program. \n77.  Peter advised that he was planning to continue in the TAP program and move on \ncampus for the second year, and his mother reported that Peter had made great progress in \ndeveloping employment and independent living skills through the program. \n78.  At the meeting, Peter and his mother again requested that OOD support Peterโs \n{00068666-5}  13 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 41 4o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 5: 018\nparticipation in the TAP program.   \n79.  Again during this meeting, Peterโs counselor did not engage in any discussion \nabout Peterโs job goal. \n80.  Following the meeting, Ms. Hutzel met with her supervisor and โexplained that \nwe need to determine next steps for developing [an individualized plan for employment] or case \nclosure.  Since we have not identified a goal a plan cannot be written at this time.โ  (Appellant \nEx. E.) \n81.  On June 11, 2013, another meeting was held with Peter, his mother, the director \nof the TAP program, Ms. Hutzel, and supervisor Jennifer Roeder. \n82.  At the meeting, Peter was advised that OOD โwould not be able to support the \n[TAP] program in any wayโ and that โthis information was passed down from Central Office and \nwas a decision made Statewide.โ  (Appellant Ex. F.) \n83.  At the meeting Ms. Roeder made clear that the agencyโs decision to deny support \nfor Peter to attend the TAP program was not based on an individual assessment of Peterโs needs, \nbut rather was due to OODโs statewide policy refusing to support Comprehensive Transition \nPrograms. \n84.  During the meeting, neither Ms. Roeder nor Ms. Hutzel indicated to Peter that the \nreason for the denial was the lack of an agreed upon employment goal. \n85.  During the meeting, neither Ms. Roeder nor Ms. Hutzel engaged in any further \ncounseling or discussion with Peter about his employment goal. \n86.  Nevertheless, at the meeting Peter was informed that his options were either to \nquit the TAP program and seek immediate job placement, or to close his case and appeal OODโs \ndecision not to support the TAP program. \n{00068666-5}  14 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 51 5o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 5: 119\n87.  Following the meeting, Peterโs counselor prepared a memo noting that she \ndisagreed with the agencyโs decision not to support the TAP program:  โCurrently VRC has been \nprovided no information as to the reasons behind this decision.  VRC would like to better \nunderstand the rationale behind this decision being made across the board.  VRC does see this \nprogram as an appropriate fit for this particular consumer, however, recognizing it is not a good \nfit for many of our consumers.  VRC believes that the vocational component of this program \nappears relevant, but in addition sees the overall program as a step up from many of our services \nas it has been evidenced to show better long term success in employment when other areas have \nbeen addressed . . . .โ  (Appellant Ex. G.) \n88.  Prior to closure, Peterโs case file with the agency contained no documentation of \nany individualized determination by an OOD counselor or supervisor that the TAP program was \nnot a necessary vocational rehabilitation service for Peter. \n89.  On the mistaken belief that it was necessary to request case closure in order to \nappeal the agencyโs decision, based on information provided by the agency, Peterโs mother made \na request on Peterโs behalf that his case be closed in order to file an appeal. \nCase Closure and Appeal \n90.  On June 21, 2013, OOD closed Peterโs case, and on July 19, 2013, Peter filed an \nappeal. \n91.  A meeting was held on August 20, 2013 to attempt to resolve the appeal \ninformally. \n92.  OOD supervisor Kimberly Colyer noted that at the meeting โwe discussed the UC \nTAP program where Peter is enrolled for his second year.  This program is a good fit for Peter, \nhe did a great job last year and really enjoyed an internship doing office work.  I explained that \nRSC [OOD] could not pay for the program fee but we could pay for vocational services such as \n{00068666-5}  15 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 61 6o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 5: 220\njob coaching.  Mrs. Merz was okay with this resolution.โ  (Appellant Ex. I.) \n93.   Nevertheless, Ms. Colyer later concluded that the agency could not support even \nthe vocational components of the TAP program because the program was not accredited by the \nCommission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). \n94.  Prior to this meeting, no one from OOD raised any issues with the accreditation of \nthe University of Cincinnati or the TAP program. \n95.  OODโs administrative regulations require that service providers must either be \nlicensed by the state, or in the case of community rehabilitation programs, providing vocational \nevaluation, work adjustment, personal adjustment, job placement, job coaching, and community-\nbased assessment service programs, accredited by CARF.  Ohio Admin. Code ยง 3304-2-53(A); \nOhio Admin. Code ยง 3304-1-12(A). \n96.  OOD does not require CARF accreditation from other college programs, and \ncurrently funds students attending other programs at the University of Cincinnati which are not \nCARF-accredited. \nFormal Hearing \n97.  On December 2 and 17, 2013, a Fair Hearing was held before Hearing Officer, \nDavid G. Hasselback. \n98.  Evidence presented at the hearing established that Peter had expressed interest in \na career related to sports during the comprehensive assessment process, and that OOD did not \nengage in further counseling or discussion with Peter about his employment goal following his \nidentification of an employment goal. \n99.  Evidence presented at the hearing established that Peter, his parents, his high \nschool teachers, University of Cincinnati faculty, and Peterโs OOD counselor Chrystal Hutzel all \ndetermined that the academic, vocational, and independent living training provided by the TAP \n{00068666-5}  16 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 71 7o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 5: 321\nprogram was necessary for Peter to prepare for competitive employment. \n100.  Evidence presented at the hearing established that Peter was found eligible for \nservices in July 2012, and that OOD failed to develop an IPE for Peter before his case was closed \non June 21, 2013. \n101.  At the hearing, the agency advanced a number of new arguments to justify its \ndecision not to support Peterโs participation in the TAP program, and testimony was presented \nabout the agencyโs process for developing its policy of refusing to support Comprehensive \nTransition Programs. \n102.  Deputy Director Susan Pugh testified that she is responsible for policy making for \nthe Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation at OOD. \n103.  Ms. Pugh testified that based on information provided by BVRโs area managers, \nshe personally made the substantive policy decision that OOD could not support individuals \nattending Comprehensive Transition Programs in Ohio, including the TAP program. \n104.  Ms. Pugh testified that she had no particular concerns about the quality of Ohioโs \nComprehensive Transition Programs generally, but rather she believed that they were not \nsufficiently focused on employment, and that the academic and independent living components \nof the programs could not qualify as vocational rehabilitation services. \n105.  Prior to the formation of this policy, no public hearings were held throughout the \nstate to provide the public, including individuals with disabilities, the opportunity to comment on \nthe policy. \n106.  After making her decision, Ms. Pugh communicated this substantive policy orally \nto area managers for distribution throughout the agency, but a written policy was never prepared. \n107.  Ms. Pugh testified that she did not review Peterโs case, or make an individualized \n{00068666-5}  17 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 81 8o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 5: 422\ndetermination that the TAP program was not a necessary vocational rehabilitation service for \nhim. \n108.  OOD Area Manager Mark Fay testified that he believed the TAP program did not \nhave a sufficient focus on employment and did not offer a meaningful credential recognized by \nemployers. \n109.  However, Mr. Fay admitted that in forming his conclusions, he did not review the \nTAP programโs curriculum, and he was unaware that the program had a required internship \ncomponent and that students developed a digital portfolio documenting work experience and \nskills and received a certificate of completion. \n110.  Following Ms. Pughโs decision not to support Comprehensive Transition \nPrograms, Mr. Fay sent an email to OOD supervisor Jennifer Roeder on June 4, 2013 advising \nthat โProgram is TAPS at UC (sic) and TOPS at OSU and RSC wonโt be paying for consumers \nto do it.  Susan herself made this call based on input from AMs.โ  (Appellant Ex. V.) \n111.  Ms. Roeder forwarded Mr. Fayโs email to Peterโs counselor Chrystal Hutzel, who \nresponded:  โjust make sure he knows the situation of how we agreed to support this coming \nyear, and how the mom will be reacting to this news . . . and how we handle that.โ  Id. \n112.  After confirming that Ms. Hutzel had not yet prepared a written plan to fund the \nprogram for Peter, Ms. Roeder sent a follow up email to Ms. Hutzel: โ[s]ince you and I reviewed \nthis case new information has emerged.  RSC cannot support this program.  You can forewarn \nthe mom so she isnโt surprised.  But, the message is clear, RSC cannot support this program.  \nSorry ๏.โ  Id. \n113.  At the hearing, Ms. Roeder testified that contrary to the determination of Peter, \nhis parents, his high school teachers, the faculty at the University of Cincinnati, and Peterโs \n{00068666-5}  18 \n\nCaCsaes:e 1: :11:41-4c-vc-v0-00100130-3W-KOLBL  DDoocc  ##::  13- 2F iFleilde:d 0: 20/10/33/11/41 4P aPgaeg:e 1: 91 9o fo 2f 52 5 P  APGAGEIEDI D# :# 5: 523\ncounselor Chrystal Hutzel, she believed that due to Peterโs cognitive disabilities, the coursework, \ninternships, and independent living skills offered by the TAP program would not benefit Peter in \nsecuring competitive employment and he should be immediately placed in a low-skilled job. \n114.  Ms. Roeder further testified that she believed Peterโs participation in the TAP \nprogram impeded the agencyโs assessment of Peter by causing him to lose interest in low skilled \njobs such as the janitorial position with the YMCA, to which she believed he was better suited. \n115.  Ms. Roeder admitted that in reaching her conclusion that Peter would not benefit \nfrom the TAP program, she relied primarily on Peterโs IQ, and she did not request or review any \ndocumentation of Peterโs progress in the TAP program. \n116.  Ms. Roeder further testified that she believed the TAP program was unacceptably \nโsegregatedโ based on personal research at a website she could no longer recall, though she \nadmitted she made no investigation to validate this conclusion. \n117.  Prior to her testimony at the hearing, Ms. Roeder made no written record \ndocumenting her determination that the TAP program would not benefit Peter, or her belief that \nthe program interfered with the agencyโs assessment of Peterโs vocational rehabilitation needs. \n118.  On January 16, 2014, the Hearing Officer issued a decision upholding the \nagencyโs decision not to support the TAP program, finding both that the agencyโs decision was \njustified because he believed that no job goal had been identified for Peter and therefore the TAP \nprogram would not lead to an employment goal. \nV.

OODโs determination not to support Peterโs participation in the TAP program, \nand the hearing officerโs decision upholding that determination were contrary to the requirements \nof the Rehabilitation Act and must be overturned. \n120.

Accordingly, Defendants did not follow the procedures of the Rehabilitation Act, \n29 U.S.C. ยง 701, et seq. or its implementing regulations, in providing vocational rehabilitation \nservices to Peter and this has caused Peter harm because he will not receive support for necessary \nvocational rehabilitation services as a result. \nVI.
