    "summary": "<p>This action was originally brought by four individuals against Franklin County, Ohio, the Sheriff of Franklin County and numerous employees of that Office on July 16, 2010. Plaintiffs brought claims under the 4th, 8th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution as enforced by 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983. &nbsp;The case was assigned to Judge Edmund A Sargus in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Plaintiffs brought a preliminary injunction and class certification motion on July 23, 2010. The United States Department of Justice sought intervention on November 3, 2010. &nbsp;The court allowed DOJ to intervene. The Court certified the class on December 14, 2010. &nbsp;DOJ and the defendants settled on February 4, 2011. The court preliminarily approved a class action settlement for declaratory and injunctive relief on the same date and gave final settlement approval on March 10, 2011. The settlement required revisions to the County's taser policy, including limitations on circumstances under which a taser could be used, alternative forms of force or control techniques, reporting requirements, and training.&nbsp; The agreement would remain in effect until the county achieved two years of substantial compliance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 7, 2011, the Court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion to consolidate with two other cases: Nicole Bradley et al. v. Franklin County, Ohio, et.al., Case Number 11-cv-261 and Michael Worley et al. v Franklin County, Ohio et al., Case Number 11-cv-415.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, all plaintiffs were dismissed but one. That plaintiff had a traumatic brain injury and subsequent seizure disorder. On August 10, 2008, he had a seizure while walking in public. Emergency medical technicians attended him, but he reportedly became aggressive and assaulted one of them, so he was arrested, charged with assaulting a peace officer, and taken to Franklin County Corrections Center instead. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI), and was ordered to be committed to a Behavioral Healthcare Forensic Unit. However, the unit lacked capacity, so he stayed in jail. He subsequently had a seizure. Prison officers attempted to handcuff him to take him to medical care. When he did not comply, officers tased him repeatedly. They tased him again at the hospital.</p>\r\n<p>He brought &sect;1983 claims of excessive force and failure to train in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the 8th Amendment of the Constitution against the deputies in their individual and official capacities, as well as against Franklin County, the Franklin County Sheriff, the commanders of the facilities, and members of the Internal Affairs Bureau.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in September 2012, claiming qualified immunity and no constitutional violation. On January 2, 2013, the court granted the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss on the basis that defendants had not acted &ldquo;maliciously and sadistically with intent to harm&rdquo; and so lacked the requisite intent necessary to find a constitutional violation.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff appealed to the 6th Circuit. On February 6, 2014, the 6th Circuit upheld the District Court&rsquo;s grant of the motion to dismiss the complaint on the same grounds as the District Court. Circuit Judge Clay filed a dissent, noting that the plaintiff&rsquo;s disability precluded him from understanding the officers&rsquo; commands following a seizure, and that the behavior that the Court found to demonstrate noncompliance or resistance actually indicated surrender. Furthermore, he noted, the Court applied the wrong standard. The plaintiff needed only to prove malicious intent &ldquo;in a rapidly evolving, fluid, and dangerous predicament.&rdquo; In this case, the dissent notes, he need only cite evidence to support his allegation that the officers were deliberately indifferent to his right to be free from excessive force. &nbsp;</p>",

INTRODUCTION\n1. Each paragraph in this First Amended Complaint incorporates all others.\n2. This case challenges a pervasive practice of subjecting arrestees and inmates at the \nFranklin County Corrections Centers to the excessive and disproportionate use of force by \ncorrections deputies of the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n3. The challenged practice is carried out through the frequent and gratuitous use of \ntasers to inflict pain, fear, corporal punishment and humiliation.\n4. Tasers deliver a minimum 5-second 50,000 volt electrical shock that causes \nexcruciating pain. Landis v. Baker, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 21946, at *6 n.4 (6thCir. 2008).\nDeputies are able to deliver more than 5 seconds of electricity simply by continuing to press the \ntaserโs trigger.  As long as the trigger is depressed, the electrical shock continues.\n5. Tasers operate in two different modes.  The primary use is to subdue a person at a \nsafe distance by firing two darts or probes that strike and attach to the person. Thereafter, an \nelectrical discharge produces temporary neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI) which \ninstantaneously and completely immobilizes the person. โA stun gun inflicts a painful and \nfrightening blow, which temporarily paralyzes the large muscles of the body, rendering the \nvictim helpless.โ  Kijowski v. City of Niles, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 7222, at *16 (6th Cir. 2010).\n6. Tasers can also be used in โdrive stunโ mode.  According to the Taser International \n3\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 4 of 49  PAGEID #: 304\nWebsite Manual, drive stun mode is the โpain compliance option.โ  As the Taser Manual \ndescribes it: โDrive-stun Taser use produces a continuous extremely painful electrical shock \nuseful for an officer engaged in close hand to hand contact with a resisting subject; pain forces \nthe resisting subject to stop violently resisting and submit to handcuffingโฆ.โ\n7. Franklin County Sheriffโs deputies are aware of how painful it is to be tased.  Near \nthe end of a video tape of the tasing of a female arrestee during booking at Franklin County \nCorrections Center I, a Franklin County deputy asks a police officer from The Ohio State \nUniversity (OSU) campus if he has ever been tased.  When the officer responded no, the sheriffโs \ndeputy replied, โThey hurt like hell.โ  Internal Affairs Report #08-116.\n8. It is the custom, policy and standard operating practice of Franklin County Sheriffโs \ncorrections deputies to repeatedly use their tasers in a callous and sadistic manner that violates \nthe Franklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs from well-\nestablished standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses substantial and \nunjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of arrestees and inmates; has caused \nneedless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional rights of arrestees and \ninmates at the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n9. This court has subject matter jurisdiction over PlaintiffsโFirst Amended Complaint \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง1331, 1343(3) and 1343(4).

Defendants Dean, Beaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst and Vandette were active \nparticipants in the tasing of Plaintiff Dawn Fiore-Bruno.  These Defendants are sued in their \nindividual capacities.\nIV. POLICY AND PRACTICE OF EXCESSIVE USE OF TASERS BY DEFENDANTS\n38. Under Ohio law, Sheriff Karnes makes the policy for the county with regard to the \noperation of his office and discharge of his duties.\n39. According to the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office policy, the Chief Deputy of \nCorrections, Defendant Barrett, assigns X26 Tasers to corrections officers at his discretion.  \nAR800:2, Section 2.1.\n40. According to this same policy, tasers are to be deployed โto gain control of a violent \nor dangerous inmateโฆwhen attempts to subdue the inmate by conventional tactics have been or \nare likely to be ineffective or there is reasonable expectation that it will be unsafe for deputies to \napproach within contact range of the inmate.โ  AR800:2, Section 1.3.\n41. This policy permits taser deployment in the following circumstances:  self-defense;\nprotection of another inmate or staff; disarming an inmate under non-lethal conditions; \npreventing self-harm to an inmate; or controlling a combative inmate.  AR800:2, Sections 1.3.1 -\n1.3.5.\n42. According to policy, tasers should not be deployed upon persons who are restrained \nby a mechanical device such as handcuffs, leg irons or a restraint chair.  AR800:2, Section 3.1.14\n43. Further, the policy provides that the taser is not recommended for use on women \nknown to be pregnant.  AR800:2, Section 5.5 states that corrections officers should not use tasers \nto โharass, taunt, interrogate, interview, threaten, or belittle any persons,โ  AR800:2, Section 5.3.\n44. Under the policy, every time a deputy uses a taser he or she must generate a Use of \nForce Report which is forwarded through the chain of command.  AR800:2, Section 4.5.\n8\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 9 of 49  PAGEID #: 309\n45. The Franklin County Sheriffโs Office Use of Force policy states that each shift \nsupervisor must compile a summary of each use of force report and forward this to Internal\nAffairs.  AR801, Section 2.3.\n46. Internal Affairs must then review all use of force reports, interview all persons with \nknowledge of the event, and make a determination of whether or not the use of force was in \ncompliance with department policy, that is, whether the use of force was โjustified.โ  AR801, \nSections 2.5 - 2.6.  On information and belief, the Internal Affairs review also includes video \ntapes of each use of force incident, including tapes made by hand-held cameras operated by \ndeputies.\n47. Internal Affairs then forwards this record and its use of force determination to the \nFranklin County Sheriffor his designee for review of the entire record.  The Sheriff or his \ndesignee may either accept or reject the finding of Internal Affairs.  AR801, Sections 2.7 - 2.8.  \nIf the use of force is ultimately determined to be โjustified,โ no discipline is imposed on the \ndeputy or deputies involved.\n48. Thus, the chain of command for reviewing all reports involving use of tasers by \nFranklin County Sheriffโs deputies includes shift supervisors, the Internal Affairs Bureau and the \nSheriff or his designee.  The Franklin County Sheriff or his designee makes the final \ndetermination of whether the use of tasers, or any other use of force, was justified.\n49. Franklin County corrections deputies routinely violate the Sheriffโs Office policy on \ndeployment of tasers.  These practices are captured in the written use of force reports and on \nvideotapes recorded by the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office in scores of cases since at least \nJanuary 1, 2008.\n50. Franklin County corrections deputies regularly use tasers in situations where the \n9\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 10 of 49  PAGEID #: 310\nperson does not remotely present a threat of violent behavior or harm to self or others, and \nroutinely and deliberately use tasers as first strike weapons without employing or even \nconsidering less painful or harmful control tactics.\n51. In case after case, deputies tase people, often in the drive stun mode to cause pain, \nwhen the person was greatly outnumbered by a team of deputies who were easily able to \nphysically overpower and control the individual, or accomplish the task at hand, thereby \neliminating any objective threat to the personโs own safety or that of the deputies.\n52. In a number of instances, corrections deputies tased arrestees or inmates while they \nwere in mechanical restraints. In one case, an inmate was even tased in drive stun mode while \nfully immobilized in a four point restraint chair.  The use of force in this instance was found \nโjustified.โ Internal Affairs Report #09-360.\n53. It is common for deputies to tase a person whose only offense was failure to obey \ndeputiesโ verbal commands, which is classified as a โminor rule violationโ that does not pose a \nthreat to staff or inmates under the Sheriffโs own administrative regulation.1  Thus, the threshold \nfor use of the taser is often only a minor breach of jail discipline.\n54. Deputies also use the taser as a retaliatory weapon when detainees show verbal \nresistance or question authority by using profanity or making derogatory remarks to staff, despite \nthat fact that this too is considered only a โminor rule violationโ under Sheriffโs Office policy.2\n55. Comparisons of the videotapes to the deputiesโ written use of force reports also show\nthat deputies often embellish or misrepresent the circumstances under which people were tased.  \nThe written reports describe the persons they tased as โcombative,โ โunrulyโ or โresistingโ when \n                                               \n1 Under AR 804 5.1.  โMinor rule violations shall includeโฆ.failure to comply with an order by \nstaff.โ\n2 Under AR 804 5.2 minor rule violations include โprofanity, derogatory remarks or gestures to \nany member of the staffโฆ.โ\n10\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 11 of 49  PAGEID #: 311\nthe actual video showed that the person was yelling and/or cursing at deputies in a manner that \nwas irritating, but not a physical threat.\n56. In other instances, the โresistanceโ was passive, not combative or active, in nature,\nsuch as a person refusing to place hands behind the back, failing or refusing to remove a piece of \njewelry or clothing, or a person who crossed his or her arms across the chest in self-protection \nagainst a forced cuffing or stripping.\n57. For example, deputies tased a woman, who previously told them she was pregnant,\nfor being unable to remove her tongue ring because her hands were too slippery.  Deputies tased \nher after they refused her repeated requests to use a paper towel to remove the tongue ring.  After\ntasing her the deputies finally gave her a paper towel which enabled her to remove the tongue \nring without difficulty. The tasing of this woman was found to be a โjustifiedโ use of force.  \nInternal Affairs Report #09-399.\n58. In many other instances, deputies tased persons for being โuncooperative.โ  These \nindividuals were not violent or threatening violence.  They were simply so impaired by alcohol\nor drugs that they were incapable of comprehending or complying with the deputiesโ commands, \nas shown in a video that depicts a young male arrested on a misdemeanor charge who is clearly \ncognitively impaired by drugs or alcohol.  In the video of this case, the corporal in charge told \nthe man โI donโt know what youโre on.โ\n59. Several deputies had taken this man to a cell in order to change him from his street \nclothes into jail clothes.  The corporal, who had a taser, informed the other deputies that โhe \nhasnโt been a threat to us but if I say โtaserโ move out of the way.โ\n60. The video shows that the young man complied with the corporalโs commands to \nremove his ring, shirt, shoes and pants but did so slowly, with deputies needing to assist at times.  \n11\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 12 of 49  PAGEID #: 312\nThe man had removed all clothing but his underwear when the corporal ordered him to sit down \non a bench.  The man remained standing after several commands to sit down.  The corporalthen \ntased himmultiple times, including drive stuns, and pistol whipped him with the taser. The \ndeputyโs use of the taser in this case was found โjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #09-258.\n61. Corrections deputies routinely and deliberately use tasers in drive stun mode as a \nform of corporal punishment for behavior that does not remotely involve violent resistance by a \nsubject, or constitute a physical or security threat.\n62. One example of this is captured in the video of a man arrested for a misdemeanor.  \nHe was handcuffed behind his back and was not acting out in a threatening manner.  Sgt. Mychal \nTurner tased this man twice with probes because he got up from a bench and began to walk \naround in the booking area while another deputy watched over him.  The man was kneeling on \nthe floor, incapacitated by the earlier tasings, when the Sergeant then drive stunned him twice \nbecause the mandid not immediately obey further commands to get up from the floor and sit \ndown on the bench.  The tasing of this man was reviewed and found to be โjustified.โ  Internal \nAffairs Report #10-009.\n63. Corrections deputies also routinely and deliberately tase people who are particularly \nvulnerable because of physical and mental disabilities. Deputies often respond inappropriately to \nsuch persons in a manner that escalates conflict and actually increases the likelihood that \nexcessive force will be used.\n64. One video depicts deputies who came to the cell of an inmate with mental illness to \nmove him to another location.  When deputies opened the cell door the inmate was holding a mat \nin front of him and speaking unintelligibly.  The inmateโs actions and demeanor show that he \nwas disoriented.  Sgt. Turner tased this inmate for not standing up and tased him again for \n12\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 13 of 49  PAGEID #: 313\nmoving his arms and legs, stating โIโm tired of playing with you.โ  Turner continued to tase this \nmentally impaired inmate when he tried to crawl under the bed.  The inmate was finally pulled \nout of the cell, still clutching the mat. He was put in leg irons and tased again when he would not \nlet go of the mat. The use of force in this instance was found โjustified.โ Internal Affairs Report \n#09-018.\n65. In another video, deputies came to a cell ostensibly to assist a mentally ill inmate \nwho was banging his head against his bed.  Instead of entering the cell to remove the inmate, a \nteam of deputies stood around outside the cell while a sergeant repeatedly tased this inmate a \ntotal of fourteen times because he would not slide out of the cell by himself.  This use of force \nwas found to be โjustified.โ Internal Affairs Report #09-390.\n66. Corrections deputies also routinely and deliberately deploy tasers for pain and \nsubjugation during the forced stripping of arrestees who should not be subjected to such a \nhumiliating practice.\n67. Often, when an arrestee voices a verbal objection to having to remove his or her \nclothes, or otherwise shows any lack of cooperation during the booking process, such as failing \nto answer routine medical questions from a nurse, a team of deputies takes the person into a side \ntank, forcibly strips the individual without telling the person why they are being โdressed out,โ\nand tases the person if there is any degree of resistance, including passive or verbal resistance, to \nbeing stripped.\n68. For example, one video shows a twenty one year old woman, brought in for driving \nwithout an operatorโs license, a misdemeanor, who was stripped and tased four times.  During \nbooking, she verbally expressed her displeasure at being arrested but was not aggressive or \nthreatening.  The deputies grabbed her already injured arm and she complained they were hurting \n13\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 14 of 49  PAGEID #: 314\nher.  When she voiced these complaints, deputies whisked her into a โside tankโ where deputies \npushed her face first into a wall and then forced her to the floor, face down.\n69. Although deputies described this young woman as โviolentlyโ resisting, at least four\ndeputies controlled her arms, trunk and legs and she could only squirm.  With two male deputies \npresent, and another male deputy filming with a hand-held camera, the team of deputies forcibly \nstripped her while she constantly asked โwhat are you doing to me?โ She was left lying naked, \nface down on the floor of her cell.  Deputies left only a safety gown for her to wear, despite the \nfact that she presented no objective risk of self harm.3  This use of force was also found \nโjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #09-147.\n70. In another case, the Ohio State Patrol brought a Hispanic man to the jail on traffic \ncharges.  He was also suspected of possibly being a deportable felon wanted by the United States \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS), whichturned out to be a case of mistaken \nidentity.  The video shows that deputies booked this man and then took him into a side tank \nwhere he was ordered to strip.\n71. Deputies ordered the man to pull his underwear down, turn around, bend over and \nโspread your ass cheeks.โ  The man refused to comply with this humiliating request. Sgt.Turner \nagain ordered the man to bend over and spread his cheeks so that he could be checked for \nโcontrabandโ even though these deputies had no reason to suspect that the man possessed drugs \nand he had already had a pat-down search and clothing search.  He again refused and Turner then\ntased him.  The intense pain led the man to obey Turnerโs command.  Afterwards, he asked \nTurner โwhy you mess with me like that?โ  In response to the manโs question, Turner replied in a \n                                               \n3 The safety or suicide gown is a shapeless green gown that is supposed to be used for \narrestees or inmates who are threatening self-harm.  When a person is placed in a safety gown he \nor she is not even allowed to wear underwear.\n14\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 15 of 49  PAGEID #: 315\nloud voice, โThis is jail.โ  Turnerโs use of the taser in this case was reviewed and found to be \nโjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #08-272.\n72. Sheriff Karnes, as the policy maker for the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office, as well \nas Deputy Chiefs Barrett and Martin, members of the Internal Affairs Bureau and the facility \ncommanders of the Franklin County Corrections Centers are responsible for the policy and \npractice of excessive and abusive use of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections officers.  \nThis is because, as set out in this Complaint:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified.โ\nb) They fail to discipline deputies whose use of tasers violates the Franklin County \nSheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs from well-established \nstandards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses substantial and \nunjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the persons tased; causes\nneedless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional rights of \npersons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \nComplaint, they have failed to properly train corrections deputies to use tasers in \naccordance with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office written policy; to use tasers in \naccordance with manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use tasers in \naccordance with accepted law enforcement principles for use of force; and to use tasers in \naccordance with the federal Constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free from\nexcessive force.\n73. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and\n15\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 16 of 49  PAGEID #: 316\nMartin, John/Jane Does, John/Jane Roes, Herrell and Edgington in their official and individual \ncapacities constitute deliberate indifference that in turn makes Defendant Franklin County \naccountable for injuries to the Plaintiffs in this action.\n74. Along with those cases discussed above, the facts in the cases of named Plaintiffs \nRobert Shreve, Michael Worley, Michael Reed, and Dawn Fiore-Bruno exemplify the policy and \npractice of abusive and excessive use of tasers by Franklin County Corrections deputies.\nV. PLAINTIFF ROBERT SHREVE - STATEMENT OF FACTS\n75. Plaintiff Shreve is deaf.  He was brought to FCCC I on a misdemeanor charge, \ndomestic violence, at a few minutes after midnight on July 19, 2009.\n76. The video of his case shows that he arrived in the back of a Columbus Police \nDepartment wagon.  He was handcuffed behind his back and his legs were restrained by a hobble \nstrap because, according to Columbus police, he was a โfighter.โ\n77. A team of at least six sheriffโs deputies and Cpl. Debra Cantrell assembled at the \npolice wagon to take Mr. Shreve from police custody and into the jail booking area.\n78. Cpl. Cantrell had her taser out before Mr. Shreve was even lifted from the police \nwagon.\n79. A Columbus police officer told Cpl. Cantrell and the other deputies that Mr. Shreve \nwas deaf and could not speak English.\n80. Mr. Shreve was removed from the police wagon without incident and was held by \ndeputies.  He went limp and was carried into the jail booking area by three deputies.\n81. Once inside the booking area, Mr. Shreve was placed face down on the floor and \nheld there by a team of deputies.\n82. Deputy Jonathan Roush had Mr. Shreveโs left arm; Deputy Douglas Robinson had \nhis right arm; and Deputy Christopher Lee had his legs.  Cpl. Cantrell stood by with her taser \n16\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 17 of 49  PAGEID #: 317\nout.\n83. Mr. Shreve is not a big man.  He is 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs 165 pounds.\n84. The Deputiesโ reports state that Mr. Shreve was โattempting to kick and move about \non the floor struggling with staff.โ  In her report, Cpl. Cantrell stated that Mr. Shreve โcontinued \nto struggle and thrash aboutโ and was โcombative.โ  She also stated that Mr. Shreve was trying \nto bite one of the deputies.\n85. These descriptions do not accurately reflect the actual video tape of Mr. Shreveโs \nbooking.\n86. The video shows that it would have been physically impossible for him to bite \nanyone because he was handcuffed behind his back and pinned, face down on the floor, by three\ndeputies. Deputies Roush and Robinson were on his right and left upper body and Deputy Lee\nheld Mr. Shreveโs legs down.\n87. Although he did move his legs to one side he was not kicking.  His legs were \nhobbled and restrained by the deputies. It was not physically possible for him to โthrash aboutโ\nor be โcombativeโ with three deputies on top of him.\n88. A fourth deputy, Nicholas Williams, also stepped in and, with both hands, pressed \nMr. Shreveโs face into the floor in a head lock.  In total, he was handcuffed behind the back, in \nleg irons and held down by four deputies.  Their intended task was to exchange handcuffs and \nreturn the original set of cuffs to the Columbus police officers.\n89. While all four deputies immobilized Mr. Shreve face down, Cpl. Cantrell stepped in \nand tased Mr. Shreveโs leg in drive stun mode.  He gave a guttural cry of pain.  Cpl. Cantrell then \nasked the deputies, โDid that soften him up?โ\n90. After the deputies exchanged the handcuffs, Cpl. Cantrell then leaned over \n17\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 18 of 49  PAGEID #: 318\nMr. Shreve and told him to โrelax, relax,โ as if he could hear her instructions.  She later \nremarked, โHeโs freakinโ because he canโt hear.โ\n91. Mr. Shreve was then taken to a side tank where his clothes were removed and he was \nplaced in jail clothing without further incident.\n92. Cpl. Cantrellโs use of the taser in drive stun mode to โsoften upโ Mr. Shreve was \ndeemed to be a โjustifiedโ use of force.\nVI. ROBERT SHREVE INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO \nDEFENDANTS CANTRELL, ROUSH, WILLIAMS, COLEMAN, GILES, EAGAN, \nMORGAN, ROBINSON AND LEE\n93. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Cantrell, Roush, Williams, \nColeman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee were state actors by virtue of their \nemployment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n94. 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n95. As an arrestee, Plaintiff Shreve was protected by the Fourth Amendmentโs protection \nagainst use of excessive force by law enforcement.\n96. Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officers may only use reasonable \nforce, that is, the amount of force that is reasonable to protect officers from a perceived threat.\n97. The use of the taser in drive stun mode against Plaintiff Shreve by Defendants \nCantrell, Roush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee was a willful, \ncallous and gratuitous act that violated Plaintiff Shreveโs Fourth Amendment right to be free \nfrom the use of excessive force. \n98. The fact that Defendants Roush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, \nRobinson and Lee were not the officers who tased Mr. Shreve does not diminish their \nculpability.  These deputies were present, were active participants who subdued Mr. Shreve, \n18\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 19 of 49  PAGEID #: 319\nwere aware that Deputy Cantrell was going to tase Mr. Shreve as he lay in their grasp, and had \nthe opportunity to stop it from occurring.\n99. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive use of force by Defendants Cantrell, \nRoush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee, Plaintiff Shreve suffered \ncompensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n100. Plaintiff Shreve is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants Cantrell, \nRoush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee acted with reckless or \ncallous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to protection against the use of \nexcessive force.\nVII.

Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and Martin, Deputies Jane/John \nDoes, Deputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington are all state actors by virtue \nof their employment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n102. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, Jane/John Does, \nJane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington have created a policy and practice of excessive and \nabusive use of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified, as they did in \nPlaintiff Shreveโs case.\nb) As in Plaintiff Shreveโs case, they fail to discipline deputies whose use of tasers \nviolates the Franklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs \nfrom well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses \n19\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 20 of 49  PAGEID #: 320\nsubstantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the persons \ntased; causes needless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional \nrights of persons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \nComplaint, Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, Jane/John Does, \nJane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington have failed to properly train corrections deputies to \nuse tasers in accordance with Sheriffโs Office written policy; to use tasers in accordance \nwith manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use tasers in accordance with \naccepted law enforcement principles for use of force; and to use tasers in accordance with \nthe federal constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free of excessive force.\n103. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, \nMartin, Jane/John Does, Jane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington in their official and individual \ncapacities constitutes deliberate indifference that in turn makes Defendant Franklin County \naccountable for injuries to Plaintiff Shreve. Leach v. Shelby County Sheriff, 891 F. 2d 1241, 1245 \n1246, 1248 (6th Cir. 1989).\n104. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, \nJane/John Does, Jane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington acted with deliberate indifference by \ntheir failure to train deputies in the proper use of reasonable force and by ratifying the use of \nexcessive and gratuitous force against Plaintiff Shreve while acting under color of state law.\n105. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Shreve to be\nsubjected to excessive and unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, from \nwhich he suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n106. Plaintiff Shreve is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants \n20\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 21 of 49  PAGEID #: 321\nbecause they acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to \nprotection against the use of excessive force.\nVIII. PLAINTIFF MICHAEL WORLEY - STATEMENT OF FACTS\n107. Plaintiff Worley had open heart surgery to replace his mitral valve in December, \n2008. He is also recovering from addiction to heroin.  He has not used heroin for at least seven \nmonths.\n108. Plaintiff Worley was arrested by Franklin County Sheriffโs deputies on April 16, \n2010 in Grove City.  He was a passenger in a car pulled over for a traffic stop.\n109. Deputies found that he had an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for petty theft. \nThey also found marijuana and some Xanax and Suboxone pills that were not prescribed for \nMr. Worley.\n110. Suboxone is approved for the treatment of opioid dependence and Xanax is an anti-\nanxiety drug.  Mr. Worley told deputies he was a recovering heroin addict and took both pills to \nkeep him from relapsing.\n111. Deputies arrested him on the misdemeanor warrant and possession of drugs and took \nhim to FCCC I for booking.  Once booked, Mr. Worley was placed in a side cell.\n112. According to Sgt. Christopher Leonardโs use of force report, a deputy heard Mr. \nWorley yell that he wanted to kill himself.\n113. A โresponse teamโ was assembled to go to Mr. Worleyโs cell, place him on a safety \nwatch, and place Mr. Worley in a safety gown.\n114. Five deputies - Sgt. Leonard, Joshua Crosby, Daniel Waldren, Ben Damschroder and \nNicholas Lapetina - entered Mr. Worleyโs cell.  Deputy Curtis Winn recorded this incident on a \nhand-held camera.\n115. The video tape of this incident shows that Sgt. Leonard drew his taser as he entered \n21\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 22 of 49  PAGEID #: 322\nMr. Worleyโs cell with the other four deputies.\n116. Sgt. Leonard ordered Mr. Worley to stand up and turn around so that Mr. Worley \nhad his back to the deputies and was facing the back wall of his cell.\n117. Sgt. Leonard then ordered Mr. Worley to take off his shirt, sandals and socks. \n118. Mr. Worley complied with these orders but asked โwhy do I gotta get naked?โ\n119. Sgt. Leonard replied, โcause you said you wanted to kill yourself.โ\n120. Mr. Worley denied this, saying โno, I said I feel like Iโm going crazy if I donโt get \nmy anxiety medicine.โ\n121. Sgt. Leonard then ordered Mr. Worley to take off his pants and his underwear.  Sgt. \nLeonard then told Mr. Worley โone more order and Iโm going to tase you.โ\n122. Taser International warns that subjects with certain pre-existing conditions such as \ncardiac disease may be at risk of death or serious injury from โarrest-related deathโ if tased.\n123. Mr. Worley turned toward the sergeant and deputies and told them โI got open heart \nsurgery, youโll kill me, my mom will be rich.โ\n124. Sgt. Leonardโs response was โI donโt care.โ\n125. Mr. Worley took off his pants but refused to take off his underwear saying โIโm not \nsitting in here naked.โ\n126. Sgt. Leonard gave Mr. Worley three rapid commands to take off his shorts, then said \nโIโm not gonna tell you again, take off your shorts.โ\n127. The sergeant then immediately tased Mr. Worley in the back. Mr. Worley cried out \nin pain.\n128. Sgt. Leonard ordered Mr. Worley to lay on his belly and put his hands at his sides or \nโIโll pull the trigger again.โ  Sgt. Leonard ordered the other deputies to remove Mr. Worleyโs \n22\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 23 of 49  PAGEID #: 323\nunderwear as he lay face down on the cell floor.\n129. Mr. Worley made choking and coughing noises after being tased and his entire body \nbegan shaking uncontrollably.\n130. Sgt. Leonard remarked, โHeโs faking,โ but called for a nurse.  She asked Mr. Worley \nif he could hear her, told him to open his eyes, told him to calm his breathing and told him to \nwake up.  Mr. Worley continued shaking for several minutes after the nurse arrived.\n131. Once Mr. Worley stopped shaking Sgt. Leonard told him to โstay down on the \nground or Iโll shoot you again.โ The deputies then placed Mr. Worley in a suicide gown.\n132. There were five deputies in Mr. Worleyโs cell who could have managed any \nresistance or threat presented by Mr. Worley.  Mr. Worley himself did not physically or verbally \nthreaten these deputies.  He was tased simply because he did not want to remove his underwear.\n133. Knowing that Mr. Worley had a heart condition, Sgt. Leonard deployed his taser \nwithout considering measures of lesser force because this was the quickest and most convenient \nway to get compliance.\n134. Sgt. Leonardโs use of the taser as a form of pain compliance in this instance was \nreviewed and found to be โjustified.โ\nIX. MICHAEL WORLEY INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS \nTO DEFENDANTS LEONARD, WINN, CROSBY, DAMSCHRODER, WALDREN AND \nLAPETINA\n135.

PLAINTIFF MICHAEL REED - STATEMENT OF FACTS\n149. In the early 1990โs, Plaintiff Reed had a motorcycle accident that left him in a coma \nand caused a traumatic brain injury.  Since this accident he has experienced seizure episodes.\n150. Mr. Reed has been diagnosed with both tonic clonic seizures (stiffening and rigidity \nof muscles followed by rhythmic jerking motions) and complex partial seizures (the person \nappears to be staring blankly and loses contact with his surroundings, often followed by chewing \nmovements, mumbling and unorganized movements).\n151. Like many persons who have seizures, he usually does not remember having the \nseizure and becomes confused, disoriented, fatigued and sometimes combative after a seizure.\n152. On August 10, 2008 Mr. Reed was walking near the corner of Hamilton Road and \nBroad Street in Columbus, Ohio when he had a seizure.\n153. Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) from the Columbus Fire Department \nresponded.  According to their reports, Mr. Reed was lying on his stomach when they arrived, \nrambling and not making sense.  When they tried to take him to the hospital, they said he became \n26\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 27 of 49  PAGEID #: 327\nโaggressive and assaultive.โ\n154. Instead of the hospital, Mr. Reed ended up in jail on a charge of assaulting a peace \nofficer, one of the EMTs.\n155. Mr. Reed had no memory of the incident.  He woke up in jail, wearing a suicide \ngown.  When told he was in jail for assault, he asked who he assaulted.\n156. Mr. Reed was incarcerated in the Franklin County Corrections Center II awaiting \ntrial on the assault charge.\n157. On December 23, 2008, Judge Michael Holbrook of the Franklin County Common \nPleas Court found Mr. Reed not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) on the assault charge.\n158. The NGRI finding was based on an evaluation by forensic psychologist Pamela \nChapman which concluded that, because of his brain injury and seizure disorder, he was neither \nable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct at the time of the offense nor able to control \nhis disorganized thinking and behavior.\n159. Judge Holbrook ordered Mr. Reed to be committed to the Twin Valley Behavioral \nHealthcare Forensic Unit.\n160. However, Twin Valley did not have an open bed.  Thus, Mr. Reed had to stay in the \nFranklin County Corrections Center II until a bed became available at Twin Valley.\n161. On January 29, 2009 Mr. Reed had a seizure in his cell at FCCC II.\n162. A team of deputies - Cpl. Sam Byrd, Deputy Sam Montrose, Deputy James Jodrey, \nDeputy Clayton Kern and Deputy Chris Starner - entered his cell at about 4:00 pm to โtake him \nto medicalโ to receive medical attention.\n163. These deputies were aware that Mr. Reed had just had a seizure.\n164. Mr. Reed was on the floor of his cell when the deputies entered.  Upon entering, they\n27\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 28 of 49  PAGEID #: 328\ngave rapid commands to Mr. Reed to put his hands behind his back so they could put handcuffs \non him and take him to medical.\n165. The deputiesโ use of force reports indicate that Mr. Reed became โcombativeโ when \nthey tried to handcuff him.  The video of this incident, however, does not support their \ndescription of Mr. Reed.\n166. The video shows Mr. Reed as being dazed, confused and unable to process the \ndeputiesโ commands in the aftermath of his seizure.\n167. Mr. Reed did not put his hands behind his back as commanded, but he did not \nactively resist the deputies.  He put his hands up in a defensive posture.  His hands were shaking.\n168. When two deputies grabbed Mr. Reedโs left arm to put it behind his back for cuffing, \nMr. Reed rolled over on his stomach and said, โoh, oh.โ\n169. Cpl. Byrd pointed the taser at Mr. Reedโs chest.  Byrd told Mr. Reed he would be \ntased if he didnโt put his left hand behind his back and warned โItโs gonna hurt a lot.โ โItโs \ngonna fucking hurt bad.โ\n170. The video shows that Mr. Reed was still confused and not comprehending what the \ndeputies wanted him to do.\n171. The deputies again grabbed Mr. Reed to place his hands behind his back.  When he \nattempted to roll away from them, Cpl. Byrd tased him.  Mr. Reed cried out in pain and put his \nhands up in a defensive posture saying, โPlease, please, please.โ\n172. Cpl. Byrd again tased Mr. Reed, this time in drive stun mode, because he was not \nputting his hands behind his back.  At one point, a deputy said โReed, hey, wake up,โ indicating \nthat Mr. Reed still was not fully aware.\n173. After being tased a second time, Mr. Reed submitted.  He was cuffed behind the \n28\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 29 of 49  PAGEID #: 329\nback, leg ironed and pulled to his feet.  The video shows that as the deputies took him out of his \ncell, Mr. Reed asked several times โWhat did I do?โ\n174. Mr. Reed suffered a cut on his head from this incident.  It is unclear from the \ndeputiesโ reports whether the cut was the result of falling during the seizure or the deputiesโ\nefforts to cuff him.\n175. After a seizure, a person is often fatigued, dazed and not fully aware of his \nsurroundings and can become belligerent, frightened and unable to communicate.\n176. Mr. Reed appeared dazed, tired and not fully aware of his surroundings on the video \nof his post-seizure period when deputies Byrd, Montrose, Jodrey, Kern and Starner entered his \ncell.\n177. These deputies were supposed to be there to help him get appropriate medical care. \nInstead, they grabbed him, restrained him, frightened him and tased him twice for failing to obey \ntheir misguided commands.  Yet this use of force was reviewed and determined to be โjustified.โ\n178. That same evening, after Mr. Reed was removed from his cell and taken to medical, \nDeputies Christopher Dishong and Matthew Carter took him to the Mount Carmel Hospital West \nEmergency Room for further examination and to fix the cut on his head.\n179. Deputy Dishong tased Mr. Reed again in the ER, while he was โleg ironedโ to a \nhospital stretcher.4  According to Deputy Carterโs report, he was using the bathroom at this time \nand was not present when Deputy Dishong tased Mr. Reed.\n180. The โAttending Noteโ from the hospital records states that Mr. Reed began standing \nup on the stretcher โtalking loudly and not making senseโ and that he was โshackled to the bed \nby the ankle at the timeโ the deputy tased him.  When tased, Mr. Reed fell off the bed, striking \n                                               \n4 There is no video of the events at the hospital.\n29\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 30 of 49  PAGEID #: 330\nhis head. \n181. Mr. Reed suffered another head laceration from the fall, requiring stitches.\n182. According to Deputy Dishongโs report, Mr. Reed stood up on the hospital bed and \nโbegan to mutter to himself.โ  When Mr. Reed did not lie down on the bed, the deputy tased him, \ncausing Mr. Reed to โstiffenโ and fall off the bed, striking his head on the wall and floor and \nsustaining the second head laceration.  \n183. According to Taser Internationalโs warnings for the X26 taser,the probes cause \nโneuromuscular interruptionโ which renders the subject unable to move and may cause him to \nfall.\n184. Taser International therefore warns that subjects are especially at risk of further \ninjury if they could fall and suffer an impact injury to the head when tased; are on an elevated or \nunstable surface when tased; or are in restraints that incapacitate or immobilize them when tased.  \nAll of these risk factors were present at the time Deputy Dishong tased Mr. Reed in the hospital \nER.\n185. The Franklin County Sheriffโs Office policy for the X 26 taser also states that tasers \nshould not be deployed upon persons who are restrained by a mechanical device such as \nhandcuffs, leg irons or a restraint chair.\n186. Tasing Mr. Reed again at the ER, in a situation where he was leg ironed to a hospital \nbed and thus had very little ability to move about, was unnecessary, gratuitous, a violation of \nSheriffโs Office policy, and subjected him to exactly the kind of further injury that Taser \nInternational warned of.  Despite this, the Deputyโs use of the taser was reviewed and deemed a \nโjustifiedโ use of force.\n30\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 31 of 49  PAGEID #: 331\nXII. MICHAEL REED INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO \nDEFENDANTS BYRD, MONTROSE, JODREY, KERN, STARNER,  AND DISHONG \n187. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Byrd, Montrose, Jodrey, Kern, \nStarner, and Dishong were state actors by virtue of their employment with the Franklin County \nSheriffโs Office.\n188. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n189. At the time of this incident Mr. Reed had already been committed to a psychiatric \nhospital pursuant to the NGRI adjudication.  He should not even have been in the jail at the time \nhe was tased.\n190. Therefore, Mr. Reed was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n191. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiff Reed had the substantive due process \nright to be free from undue bodily harm at the hands of state actors.\n192. Although Mr. Reed was not convicted of a crime and thus not subject to punishment,\nbut rather was adjudicated NGRI, that is, determined to have been not criminally responsible for \nthe crime charged, Plaintiff Reed pleads in the alternative a violation of his rights under the \nEighth Amendment.\n193. The Eighth Amendment sets parameters on punishment of prisoners who are serving\na sentence pursuant to conviction of a crime.  It prevents state actors from unnecessarily and \nwantonly inflicting pain upon prisoners.\n194. Whether analyzed under Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment standards, however, the \nuse of the taser against Plaintiff Reed multiple times in his cell by Defendants Byrd, Montrose, \nJodrey, Kern, Starner, and by Deputy Dishong at the hospital emergency room was unduly and \nunnecessarily harmful, as well as a wanton infliction of pain that violated his Constitutional right \n31\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 32 of 49  PAGEID #: 332\nto be free from the use of excessive force.\n195. The fact that Defendants Montrose, Jodrey, Kern, and Starner were not the officers \nwho tased Mr. Reed during the incident in his cell does not diminish their culpability.  These \ndeputies were present, were active participants in this incident, heard Deputy Byrd threaten to \ntase Mr. Reed if he did not cooperate and therefore, had the opportunity to stop this use of \nexcessive force from occurring.\n196. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive use of force by Defendants Byrd, \nMontrose, Jodrey, Kern, Starner, and Dishong, PlaintiffReed suffered compensable physical \npain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n197. Plaintiff Reed is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants Byrd, \nMontrose, Jodrey, Kern, Starner, and Dishong acted with reckless and wanton indifference to \nPlaintiffโs Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free of excessive force.\nXIII. MICHAEL REED INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO \nDEFENDANTS FRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF JIM KARNES, CHIEF DEPUTY\nMARK BARRETT, CHIEF DEPUTY STEVE MARTIN, JANE/JOHN DOES, \nJANE/JOHN ROES, MAJOR MICHAEL HERRELL AND MAJOR DOUG \nEDGINGTON\n198. Defendants Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and Martin, Deputies Jane/John Does, \nDeputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington are all state actors by virtue of their \nemployment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n199. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, Jane/John Does, \nJane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington have created a policy and practice of excessive and \nabusive use of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified,โ as they did in \nPlaintiff Reedโs case.\n32\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 33 of 49  PAGEID #: 333\nb)  As in Plaintiff Reedโs case, they fail to discipline deputies whose use of tasers \nviolates the Franklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs \nfrom well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses \nsubstantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the persons \ntased; causes needless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional \nrights of persons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \nComplaint, Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, Jane/John Does, \nJane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington have failed to properly train corrections deputies to \nuse tasers in accordance with Sheriffโs Office written policy; to use tasers in accordance \nwith manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use tasers in accordance with \naccepted law enforcement principles for use of force; and to use tasers in accordance with \nthe federal constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free of excessive force.\n200. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and \nMartin, Deputies Jane/John Does, Deputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington \nin their official and individual capacities constitutes deliberate indifference that in turn makes \nDefendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to Plaintiff Reed. Leach v. Shelby County \nSheriff, 891 F. 2d 1241, 1245 - 1246, 1248 (6th Cir. 1989).\n201. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and Martin, \nDeputies Jane/John Does, Deputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington acted \nwith deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies in the proper use of reasonable force \nand by ratifying the use of excessive and gratuitous force against Plaintiff Reed while acting \nunder color of state law.\n33\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 34 of 49  PAGEID #: 334\n202. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Reed to be \nsubjected to excessive and unreasonable force in violation of either the Eighth or Fourteenth \nAmendments, from which he suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as \nemotional distress.\n203. Plaintiff Reed is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants because \nthey acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourteenth Amendment, or in the \nalternative, Eighth Amendment, right to protection against the use of excessive force.\nXIV. PLAINTIFF DAWN FIORE-BRUNO -STATEMENT OF FACTS\n204. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno has a history of treatment for mental illness as well as a \nreported history of both physical and sexual abuse.\n205. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno was arrested for disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor,on \nDecember 10, 2009.  She was brought to FCCC II for booking very early in the morning on that \ndate, around 1:30 am.\n206. The video of the booking area shows that before Ms. Fiore-Bruno was brought in,\ntwo male deputies can be overheard saying โI love belly shirtsโ and โtheyโre hot.โ\n207. When Ms. Fiore-Bruno arrived she was talking in a loud voice and cursing, but not \nphysically threatening or violent in any way.\n208. Two female deputies, Shannon Beaudry and Elizabeth Klein, sat Ms. Fiore-Bruno \ndown on a bench and removed her shoes and socks.  Ms. Fiore-Bruno did not resist.\n209. Deputies Beaudry and Klein then took Ms. Fiore-Bruno to a line drawn on the floor \nin front of the booking counter, where she stood without resisting.\n210. As she was being escorted to the booking counter Ms. Fiore-Bruno asked if she was \nbeing taped and said โI want to be on fucking tape.โ\n211. Deputies Beaudry and Klein removed Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs belt and searched her \n34\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 35 of 49  PAGEID #: 335\npockets.  Again, she did not resist.\n212. A nurse behind the booking counter asked her if she had any medical problems.  Ms. \nFiore-Bruno replied โyes.โ\n213. The nurse asked Ms. Fiore-Bruno, โWhat are they?โ Ms. Fiore-Bruno responded \nโBPD.โ5  The nurse asked Ms. Fiore-Bruno if she was going to answer and Ms. Fiore-Bruno \nresponded in a loud voice โwhatโd you say to me?โ  The nurse replied, โIโm not gonna keep \nrepeating myself.โ Ms. Fiore-Bruno then yelled โI said BPD.โ  She also called the nurse a \nโbitch.โ The nurseโs response was, โOk, Iโm done. Iโm not gonna be talked to like that.โ\n214. Female deputies Beaudry and Klein, accompanied by male deputies Derek Shively, \nJason Brobst, Steven Dean and Keith Miller, took Ms. Fiore-Bruno to a holding cell, placed her \nface down on the floor and began forcibly stripping off her clothes.  Cpl. Lee Vandette was also \npresent in the cell and observing the take-down and stripping of Ms. Fiore-Bruno.\n215. As she was being stripped, Ms. Fiore-Bruno constantly yelled for a camera to record \nthe event and accused the deputies of being abusive.  Deputy Jason Brobst, who was at \nMs. Fiore-Brunoโs right arm, began yelling at her to stop pulling her arm away โand do what \nyouโre told.โ\n216. Deputy Steven Dean drew his taser and pointed the laser light at Ms. Fiore-Bruno.  \nThe two female deputies continued to pull off Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs clothes with male deputies \npresent in the cell as she was being stripped.\n217. Ms. Fiore Bruno said, โThereโs no reason to make me naked.โ At that point, \ndeputies began to roll her over face up while she was topless and Ms. Fiore-Bruno continued \nyelling, โI want a camera.โ  Deputy Brobst told her to โRoll over and do what youโre toldโ and \n                                               \n5 Ms. Fiore-Bruno has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and a mood \ndisorder.\n35\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 36 of 49  PAGEID #: 336\nโYouโre gonna start doing what youโre told.โ\n218. As the female deputies began to remove Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs jeans and underwear, she \ntried to roll over on her stomach.  Deputy Dean then placed his taser on her left buttock and drive \nstunned her. \n219. Four male deputies and two female deputies were present as her jeans and underwear \nwere being removed.  Ms. Fiore-Bruno said, crying, โThere should not be a male in here.โ\n220. Deputy Brobst told her โthis was all because you refused to do what you were told to \ndo.โ  Ms. Fiore-Bruno asked โwhat if I was your sister?โ\n221. After being stripped completely naked, Ms. Fiore-Bruno was left lying, face down, \non the cell floor.  A male deputy warned her she would be tased again if she moved before \ndeputies exited the cell.  The only clothing they left for her was a safety gown, despite the fact \nthat there was no objective indication that Ms. Fiore-Bruno intended to harm herself in any way.  \n222. It was unnecessary to escalate Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs booking by subjecting her to this\ndegrading process, during which she was tased for her ineffectual resistance to being forcibly \nstripped by multiple deputies.\n223. Ms. Bruno has a history of physical and sexual abuse and mental illness.6  The \nprocess of being forcibly stripped and tased in the presence of male deputies during booking for \na misdemeanor arrest was particularly traumatizing and humiliating for Ms. Fiore-Bruno given \nher history.\n224. Tasing Ms. Fiore-Bruno was determined to be a โjustifiedโ use of force.\n                                               \n6 This is not uncommon, as studies show that eighty percent of women in prisons and \njails have been victims of sexual and physical abuse.

DAWN FIORE-BRUNO INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS \nTO DEFENDANTS BEAUDRY, KLEIN, SHIVELY, BROBST, DEAN, MILLER AND \nVANDETTE\n225. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, \nDean, Miller and Vandette were state actors by virtue of their employment with the Franklin \nCounty Sheriffโs Office.\n226. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n227. As an arrestee, Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno was protected by the Fourth Amendmentโs \nprotection against use of excessive force by law enforcement.\n228. Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officers may only use reasonable \nforce, that is, the amount of force that is reasonable to protect officers from a perceived threat.\n229. The use of the taser against Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno by Defendants Beaudry, Klein, \nShively, Brobst, Dean, Miller and Vandette was a willful, callous and gratuitous act that violated \nPlaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs Fourth Amendment right to be free from the use of excessive force.\n230. The fact that Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Miller and Vandette were \nnot the officers who tased Ms. Fiore-Bruno does not diminish their culpability.  These deputies \nwere present, were participants in the forced removal of Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs clothing, were aware \nthat Deputy Dean was going to tase Ms. Fiore-Bruno as they were holding her, and had the \nopportunity to stop it from occurring. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive use of \nforce by Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller and Vandette, Plaintiff Fiore-\nBruno suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n231. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants \nBeaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller and Vandette acted with reckless indifference to \nPlaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to protection against the use of excessive force.\n37\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 38 of 49  PAGEID #: 338\nXVI. DAWN FIORE-BRUNO INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS \nTO DEFENDANTS FRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF JIM KARNES, CHIEF DEPUTY \nMARK BARRETT, CHIEF DEPUTY STEVE MARTIN, JANE/JOHN DOES, \nJANE/JOHN ROES, MAJOR MICHAEL HERRELL AND MAJOR DOUG \nEDGINGTON\n232. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and Martin, Deputies Jane/John \nDoes, Deputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington are all state actors by virtue \nof their employment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n233. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, Jane/John Does, \nJane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington have created a policy and practice of excessive and \nabusive use of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified,โ as they did in \nPlaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs case.\nb)  As in Plaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs case, they fail to discipline deputies whose use of \ntasers violates the Franklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; \ndeparts from well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; \nposes substantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the \npersons tased; causes needless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the \nConstitutional rights of persons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \nComplaint, Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, Jane/John Does, \nJane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington have failed to properly train corrections deputies to \nuse tasers in accordance with Sheriffโs Office written policy; to use tasers in accordance \nwith manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use tasers in accordance with \naccepted law enforcement principles for use of force; and to use tasers in accordance with \n38\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 39 of 49  PAGEID #: 339\nthe federal constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free of excessive force.\n234. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and \nMartin, Deputies Jane/John Does, Deputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington \nin their official and individual capacities constitutes deliberate indifference that in turn makes \nDefendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno. Leach v. Shelby \nCounty Sheriff, 891 F. 2d 1241, 1245 - 1246, 1248 (6th Cir. 1989)\n235. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and Martin, \nDeputies Jane/John Does, Deputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington acted \nwith deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies in the proper use of reasonable force \nand by ratifying the use of excessive and gratuitous force against Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno while \nacting under color of state law.\n236. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno to \nbe subjected to excessive and unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, from \nwhich she suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n237. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants \nbecause they acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to \nprotection against the use of excessive force.\nXVII. JURY DEMAND\n238. Plaintiffs Shreve, Worley, Reed and Fiore-Bruno demand a trial by jury of all issues \ntriable by a jury.\nXVIII.CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS AS AGAINST FRANKLIN COUNTY, \nSHERIFF KARNES, DEPUTY CHIEFS BARRETT AND MARTIN, JANE/JOHN DOES, \nJANE/JOHN ROES, AND MAJORS HERRELL AND EDGINGTON\n239. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley bring this action on behalf of themselves and on behalf \nof all others similarly situated solely for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \n39\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 40 of 49  PAGEID #: 340\nP. 23(b)(2).\n240. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley represent a class of person defined as follows:\na) All persons who, now or at any future time during the pendency of this \nlitigation, are or will be placed in the custody of the Franklin County Sheriffโs Department \nat the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\n241. The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \na) Joinder is impracticable here because the class consists of thousands of current \nand future inmates.  Defendant Sheriff Karnes controls the information about the exact \nnumber of inmates at the FCCCs, so Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley cannot establish the \nprecise number of class members.  However, the 2007 Annual Report of the Franklin \nCounty Sheriffโs Office states that the average daily population of the FCCCs is over 1,850 \ninmates.  \nb) Because this class action is seeking prospective injunctive relief, the presence of \nfuture or unknown members of a proposed class also makes joinder impracticable. \n242. There are also questions of law and fact presented in this Complaint that are common \nto the members of the proposed class. These questions include:\na) Do FCCC deputies routinely use tasers on in violation of the constitutional\nrights of individuals in their custody?\nb) Have the Defendants failed to adequately train and supervise their deputies on \nthe proper use of tasers?\nc) Do the Defendants routinely ratify the unconstitutional use of tasers by failing to \ndiscipline deputies for improper taser use?\nd) Do the Defendantsroutinely fail to follow their written policy on the use of \n40\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 41 of 49  PAGEID #: 341\ntasers?\n243. The claims of Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley are typical of the claims of the members \nof the proposed class.\na) Plaintiffs Shreve and Worleyโs claims are typical of the claims of the putative \nclass because they, along with all proposed class members, are at risk of having their \nconstitutional rights violated through FCCC deputiesโ use of tasers.  \nb) Due to FCCC deputiesโwidespread, arbitrary, and excessive use of tasers \nagainst persons in custody at the Franklin County Corrections Centers, all of the putative \nclass members are similarly at risk of the violation of their constitutional rights and seek \nthe same relief to require the Defendants to discontinue their unconstitutional use of tasers.  \nc) Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the proposed class members would all be \nproceeding under the same legal theory - that the FCCC deputiesโ use of tasers violates the \nPlaintiffsโ constitutional rights.  \n244. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nproposed class, thereby making injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a \nwhole.\na) Class certification is appropriate here, where all class members are at risk of the \nviolation of their constitutional rights, but their temporary status as arrestees and inmates\nwill frustrate any attempt to achieve systemic declaratory or injunctive relief.\nb) Rule 23(b)(2) was formulated to allow for class actions where parties, as here, \nseek broad injunctive relief to vindicate the civil rights of a large class of individuals.\n245. The named Plaintiffs, Shreve and Worley, will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley have no interest that is now or may be \n41\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 42 of 49  PAGEID #: 342\npotentially antagonistic to the interests of the proposed class.  \n246. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley are represented by experienced attorneys employed by \nOhio Legal Rights Service (OLRS).  OLRS lawyers have extensive experience in litigating \nfederal court class action cases involving federal rights and federal civil rights claims. \na) OLRS lawyers have represented clients in many complex litigation matters over \nseveral decades, including serving as class counsel.  For example, OLRS lawyers have\nserved as class counsel for approximately 20 years in Doe v. State of Ohio, Docket No. \n2:91-cv-464 (S.D. Ohio), concerning the stateโs implementation of its duties under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act and its funding for special education services.  \nIn Rone v. Fireman, Docket No. C75-355A (N.D. Ohio), OLRS successfully represented a \nclass of patients at a state psychiatric hospital against various state agency Defendants to \nimprove conditions at Western Reserve Psychiatric Habilitation Center.  Similarly, in Coe \nv. Hyde, Docket No. C2-87-719 (S.D. Ohio), OLRS lawyers represented a class of patients \nat Central Ohio Psychiatric Hospital and succeeded in its challenges to the conditions at \nthat facility.  In Cleveland v. Ohio Department of Mental Health, Docket No. 89-cv-3658 \n(Franklin Cty. Common Pleas), OLRS lawyers served as class counsel to challenge the \nstateโs procedures for involuntary medicating individuals with mental illness, and \nsucceeding in obtaining a permanent injunction for the Plaintiff class.  Many of these cases \ninvolved the vindication of individualsโ constitutional rights through ยง 1983 litigation, and \nOLRSโ lawyers extensive involvement in these and other similar cases demonstrates that \nOLRS lawyers are qualified to represent the Plaintiff class.\nb) OLRS has sufficient resources to adequately represent the class.  OLRS is an \nindependent state agency created in 1975 by state law to protect and advocate the rights of \n42\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 43 of 49  PAGEID #: 343\npeople with disabilities, and is Ohioโs federally designated Protection and Advocacy \nsystem. OLRS Program staff includes ombudspersons, disability rights advocates, and \nattorneys who advocate for individual and systemic change through individual, group and \nclass action cases, monitoring policies and legislative activity, and providing education and \ntraining.  OLRS is committed both in time and resources to this litigation to ensure that the \ncurrent abuses of people with disabilities and other people at the Franklin County \nCorrections Centers are brought to an end.\nXIX. CLASS ACTION CLAIM OF ROBERT SHREVE AND MICHAEL WORLEY ON \nBEHALF OF A PROPOSED CLASS UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO DEFENDANTS \nFRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF KARNES, DEPUTY CHIEFS BARRETT AND \nMARTIN, JANE/JOHN DOES, JANE/JOHN ROES, AND MAJORS HERRELL AND \nEDGINGTON IN THEIR OFFICIAL CAPACITIES\n247. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and Martin, Deputies Jane/John \nDoes, Deputies Jane/John Roes, and Majors Herrell and Edgington are all state actors by virtue \nof their employment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n248. Corrections deputies at the Franklin County Corrections Centers have subjected \nPlaintiffs Shreve and Worley, and will continue to subject members of the proposed class, to the \nabusive and excessive use of tasers in a manner that constitutes excessive, unreasonable and \ndisproportionate force; recklessly and wantonly inflicts mental pain, emotional distress and \ntrauma; is malicious and sadistic; inflicts corporal punishment for minor violations; violates the \nFranklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs from well-\nestablished standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses substantial and \nunjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of arrestees and inmates; and \nviolates the Constitutional rights of those persons in the custody of the Franklin County \nCorrections Centers, in violation of their rights under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments as enforced through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n43\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 44 of 49  PAGEID #: 344\n249. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, Jane/John Does, \nJane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington have created a policy and practice of excessive and \nabusive use of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified.โ\nb) They fail to discipline deputies whose use of tasers violates the Franklin County \nSheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs from well-established \nstandards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses substantial and \nunjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the persons tased; causes \nneedless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional rights of \npersons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) They have failed to properly train corrections deputies to use tasers in \naccordance with Sheriffโs Office written policy; to use tasers in accordance with \nmanufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use tasers in accordance with accepted \nlaw enforcement principles for use of force; and to use tasers in accordance with the \nfederal constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free of excessive force.\n250. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, \nMartin, Jane/John Does, Jane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington in their official capacities in turn \nmake Defendant Franklin County accountable for the harm to Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and \nmembers of the proposed class.\n251. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett, Martin, \nJane/John Does, Jane/John Roes, Herrell and Edgington, under color of state law, have acted and \ncontinue to act with deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies in the proper use of \n44\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 45 of 49  PAGEID #: 345\nreasonable force and by ratifying the use of excessive and gratuitous force against Plaintiffs\nShreve and Worley and members of the proposed class.  \n252. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants have caused Plaintiffs Shreve\nand Worley and will continue to cause members of the proposed class to be subjected to \nexcessive and unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.\nXX. NEED FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n253. The practices involving misuse of tasers discussed in this Complaint are ongoing \nbecause the culture at the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office fosters them.  \n254. There is no accountability for the misuse of tasers by Franklin County corrections \ndeputies. These practices have repeatedly been found to be โjustifiedโ by the chain of command \nat the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office, including facility commanders, the Internal Affairs \nBureau and the Chief Deputy of Corrections.  Out of a sample of 180 use of force reports \ninvolving tasers since January 1, 2008, the use of force was found โnot justifiedโ in fewer than a \nhandful of cases.\n255. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, John/Jane Does, John/Jane Roes, Herrell \nand Edgington have repeatedly authorized and ratified the custom, policy and practice of misuse \nof tasers by the corrections deputies whom they supervise and for whom they set policy.\n256. These Defendants also have failed to adequately train and supervise corrections \ndeputies to use tasers in a manner that is safe, appropriate, conforms to policy and adheres to \nConstitutional standards for use of force. By their actions, and their failures to act, these \nDefendants have been and remain deliberately indifferent to the risk of violating the \nConstitutional rights of Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the proposed Plaintiff \nclass.\n45\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 46 of 49  PAGEID #: 346\n257. The deliberate indifference of Defendants Sheriff  Karnes, Barrett, Martin, John/Jane \nDoes, John/Jane Roes, Herrell and Edgingtonresults in the failure to adequately train, supervise \nand discipline corrections deputies in their use of tasers has caused and will continue to cause \nviolations of the Constitutional rights of Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the \nproposed Plaintiff class.\n258. These ongoing practices present the real threat of physical injury and psychological \ntrauma to individuals who currently are in custody at the Franklin County Corrections Centers or \nwill be in custody of the Franklin County Correction Centers during the pendency of this \nlitigation.\n259. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley, as well as the members of the proposed class, are \nentitled to declaratory and injunctive relief.  Defendants have engaged and are continuing to \nengage in the challenged policies and practices that were used against Plaintiffs Shreve and \nWorley.\n260. Defendants have acted and, without immediate injunctive relief, will continue to act \nunder color of state law to deprive Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the \nproposed class of their Constitutional rights to be free of excessive force.\n261. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the proposed class have no \nadequate remedy at law.  In the absence of injunctive relief they will continue to suffer the real \nthreat of irreparable harm as a result of the existence of a policy and practice that encourages and \napproves the misuse of tasers by Franklin County Corrections deputies.\nXXI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF\nTherefore, Plaintiffs request that this Court:\nA. Assume jurisdiction over this matter;\nB. Certify the proposed class as:  All persons who, now or at any future time during the \n46\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 15 Filed: 08/27/10 Page: 47 of 49  PAGEID #: 347\npendency of this litigation, are or will be placed in the custody of the Franklin County Sheriffโs \nDepartment at the Franklin County Corrections Centers;\nC.

Enjoin the Defendants from continuing to violate the Constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the proposed class as set forth in this \nComplaint;\nF. Enjoin the Defendants from continuing to violate their own policy on use of the X26 \ntaser;\nG. Appoint an expert with extensive experience in corrections who is not associated \nwith any party to this action to monitor, review, and oversee all use of force reports involving \ndeployment of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections deputies and to recommend \nappropriate discipline and conduct training of deputies where warranted;\nH. Grant judgment in favor of Plaintiffs Shreve, Worley, Reed and Fiore-Bruno, and \nagainst the Defendants, individually and collectively, for compensatory damages for Plaintiffsโ\ninjuries, pain and suffering and emotional distress in an amount to be proven at trial;\nI.

These \"hard impact weapons\" inflict serious physical pain upon the individuals \nagainst whom they are used.  The Sixth Circuit has remarked that \"a stun gun inflicts a painful and \nfrightening blow, which temporarily paralyzes the large muscles of the body, rendering the victim \nhelpless.\"  Kijowski v. City of Niles, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 7222 at *16 (6th Cir. 2010). (citation \nomitted)  Each taser usage sends 50,000 volts of electricity into the subject.  In the prong mode, the \ntaser causes electro-muscular disruption, which affects the body's central nervous system.  In the \ndrive stun mode, the taser relies solely on inflicting serious physical pain to induce compliance. \n  2\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 3 of 20  PAGEID #: 90\n  Plaintiffs' expert Steve J. Martin, who has 38 years of experience as a corrections officer, \nlegal counsel, investigator for the U.S. Department of Justice, and as a court-appointed expert, has \nconcluded after reviewing extensive records from the Franklin County Sheriff's Office that he has \n\"never witnessed such a pervasive and pronounced pattern and practice of the wanton, gratuitous, \nand unnecessary infliction of pain on confined persons, some of whom are physically or mentally \nimpaired, some of whom are tasered while fully restrained and passive, and most of whom are \nsubjected to extreme indignities prior to, during, and after force is applied.\"  Exhibit 2 at 26 - 27 \n( hereinafter Rep. __ ). \n  Plaintiff Shreve seeks a preliminary injunction to stop this ongoing practice because the \nDefendants have exhibited a pattern and practice of violating the constitutional rights of individuals \nin their custody by inflicting serious physical pain through the use of tasers despite the lack of any \nvalid penological purpose. \nI.  BACKGROUND AND FACTS \n  As Plaintiffs' complaint alleges, the Defendants use tasers against arrestees and inmates in \nviolation of the individuals' constitutional rights.  Plaintiff Shreve, who seeks this injunction on \nbehalf of himself and the putative class, was tased while he was handcuffed and held down by at \nleast four deputies.  Plaintiff Shreve is deaf, and the corporal who tased him stated that she did so to \n\"soften him up.\"  The Defendants' records show that many other individuals are tased not for \nimmobilization purposes, but as corporal punishment even when they do not pose an immediate \nthreat to themselves or others. \n  In support of his motion, Plaintiff Shreve submits the report of expert Steve J. Martin.  Mr. \nMartin has 38 years of experience in the field, including work as a corrections officer and later as \nGeneral Counsel for the Texas Department of Corrections, as well as fifteen years as an investigator \nfor the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division.  Rep. 1 - 3.  He has served as a court-\n  3\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 4 of 20  PAGEID #: 91\nappointed monitor and as an expert in numerous cases regarding conditions in correctional facilities, \nincluding facilities in Ohio, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, Houston, \nPittsburgh, New Orleans, Seattle, Oklahoma City, and Las Vegas.  Rep. 3 - 4. \n  As Mr. Martin explains in his report, the taser has two modes: the prong mode, which \nimmobilizes the subject by causing electro-muscular disruption, and the drive stun mode, which does \nnot immobilize the subject's central nervous system.  Rep. 8 - 9.  Taser use \"by definition, always \ninflicts serious pain on the subject.\"  Rep. 11.  However, while the use of the taser in prong mode \nprovides deputies with an opportunity to gain control of a volatile situation when the subject is \nimmobilized by the electro-muscular disruption, use of the taser in drive stun mode relies solely \nupon inflicting pain upon the subject to induce compliance.  Rep. 9. \n  Mr. Martin reviewed over one hundred use of force reports from the Franklin County \nSheriff's Office and dozens of accompanying videos, and concluded that Franklin County Correction \nCenter (FCCC) deputies improperly use tasers in the following ways: \n๏ท  To indiscriminately, wantonly, and gratuitously inflict pain and corporal punishment, as in \nIncident #09-258, in which a young man arrested for disorderly conduct was repeatedly tased \nand pistol-whipped when he had difficulty complying with the deputies' orders to disrobe \ndue to his intoxication. \n๏ท  To summarily and corporally punish detainees for behaviors that do not constitute en \nimmediate threat or where security imperatives are not immediately implicated, including \nIncident #10-009, where a man arrested for criminal trespass because he refused to leave a \nnightclub was tased six times, including four drive stuns, when he wandered from a bench in \nthe booking area but remained under the watch of a deputy, and then was unable to comply \n  4\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 5 of 20  PAGEID #: 92\n๏ท  As a \"first-strike\" weapon without consideration, or use, less painful, harmful, and injurious \ncontrol tactics, such as Incident #09-399, when a deputy tased a woman who had difficulty \nremoving her tongue ring and had asked for a paper towel to aide her. \n๏ท  To inflict pain and corporal punishment on detainees with conditions that render them more \nsusceptible to needless risks of harm associated with the taser, as in Incident #09-390, in \nwhich the deputies tased a detainee with mental illness fourteen times as they ordered him to \nslide out of his cell because he was injuring himself. \n๏ท  As a retaliatory tactic on detainees who verbally question or resist officer commands, often \naccompanied by officers' use of words of malice, taunts, profanity, and threats, including \nIncident #09-114, where deputies tased an individual with mental illness in drive stun mode \nwhen he was slow to respond to commands after being awakened to move into a different \ncell. \n๏ท  During the course of disrobing detainees for strip/body cavity searches in the presence of \nopposite gender personnel, as in Incident #09-147, where a young woman was tased four \ntimes, including three drive stuns, while male and female deputies forcibly stripped her with \nno explanation. \nRep. 6 - 7.  Additionally, Mr. Martin concludes that \"FCCC supervisors fail to properly review \nand investigate incidents that contain clear and objective evidence of improper deployment of the \nX26 Taser, thus allowing FCCC officers to engage in such wrongdoing with impunity.\"  Each of \nthe above incidentsโand all but two of the over one hundred incidents reviewed by Mr. \n  5\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 6 of 20  PAGEID #: 93\nMartinโwas found to be \"justified\" after a review pursuant to the Sheriff's Office policy. Rep. \n26. \n  These  incidents  and  the  other  records  that  form  the  basis  of  Mr.  Martin's  opinions \ndemonstrate that the Defendants are engaging in a pattern and practice of violating the constitutional \nrights of individuals in their custody, such that preliminary injunctive relief is necessary and \nappropriate. \nII. LAW AND ARGUMENT \n  To prevail on a motion for preliminary injunction, the movant \"must establish that he is likely \nto succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tip in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"  \nWinter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 365, 374 (2008), citing \nMunaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 128 S.Ct. 2207 (2008) (slip op., at 12); Amoco Production Co. v. \nGambell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987); Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 311โ312 (1982). \n  Plaintiff Shreve can demonstrate that the Defendants have an ongoing policy and practice of \nusing tasers to violate the constitutional rights of individuals in their custody.  These ongoing \nconstitutional violations and the infliction of serious physical pain upon arrestees and detainees \nsupport a finding that the Plaintiff class will continue to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an \ninjunction.  The requested relief is narrowly tailored to ensure that the Defendants will not be \nharmed by the injunction, so the balance of equities tips in favor of the Plaintiff class.  Finally, the \ninjunction will serve the public interest by remedying constitutional violations.  Therefore, Plaintiff \nShreve respectfully requests that this Court enter a preliminary injunction as stated in his motion. \n  6\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 7 of 20  PAGEID #: 94\nA.  Plaintiff Shreve is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim on behalf of the class. \n  Plaintiff Shreve is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim because, as Mr. Martin \nconcludes, there is a \"very evident pattern and practice by FCCC officers of resorting prematurely \nand precipitously to deployment of the taser regardless of need.\" Rep. 19. \n  Plaintiff Shreve brings this claim on behalf of the proposed class under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, \nwhich provides a federal cause of action against any person who, under color of state law, violates an \nindividual's constitutional rights.  The particular constitutional rights at issue here are the Fourth \nAmendment's protection from excessive force, the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against \npunishment without due process, and the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual \npunishment.  Although the standards are different for each protected right, the Defendants' conduct \nviolates each standard. \n1.  Plaintiff Shreve is likely to succeed on his claim that the Defendants are violating the \nFourth Amendment rights of arrestees. \n  The Defendants frequently use tasers on individuals during the booking process, shortly after \nthey are arrested.  These individuals are protected by the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits the use \nof tasers when such force is objectively unreasonable.  \"The Fourth Amendment protects pre-trial \ndetainees arrested without a warrant through the completion of their probable-cause hearings.\"  \nAldini v. Bodine, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 13207 at *2-*3 (6th Cir. 2010).  In analyzing a claim of \nexcessive force under the Fourth Amendment, \"the question is whether the officers' actions are \n\"objectively reasonable\" in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard for \ntheir underlying intent or motivation.\"  Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989).  \"Determining \nwhether the force used to effect a particular seizure is \"reasonable\" under the Fourth Amendment \nrequires a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth \n  7\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 8 of 20  PAGEID #: 95\nAmendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.\"  Id. at 396 (internal \nquotes omitted).  In making this determination, the court must pay \"careful attention to the facts and \ncircumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the \nsuspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively \nresisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\"  Id. \n  The Sixth Circuit has recognized that there are constitutional limitations on the use of tasers \nunder the Fourth Amendment.  The court has remarked that \"a stun gun inflicts a painful and \nfrightening blow, which temporarily paralyzes the large muscles of the body, rendering the victim \nhelpless.  Absent some compelling justification โ such as the potential escape of a dangerous \ncriminal or the threat of immediate harm โ the use of such a weapon on a non-resistant person is \nunreasonable.\"  Kijowski v. City of Niles, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 7222 at *16 (6th Cir. 2010) \n(internal quotes and citations omitted).  The Sixth Circuit also cited with approval in Landis v. \nBaker, 297 Fed. Appx. 453, 465 (6th Cir. 2008), other courts' holdings that \"different tactics should \nbe employed against an unarmed, emotionally distraught individual who is resisting or creating \ndisturbance than would be used against an armed and dangerous criminal who has recently \ncommitted an offense\"  and \"when police are confronted by an unarmed, emotionally distraught \nindividual who has committed no serious crime, as opposed to an armed and dangerous criminal, the \ngovernmental interest in using force is diminished, not strengthened, even when the suspect is \nirrational and inviting the use of force.\"  Id., citing Deorle v. Rutherford, 272 F. 3d 1272, 1282-83 \n(9th Cir. 2001) and Marshall v. City of Portland, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8764 at *33 (D. Or., May 7, \n2004). \n  Other courts have also found that the use of tasers can violate an individual's Fourth \nAmendment rights in situations that are similar to those in this case.  In Bryan v. McPherson, 590 \n  8\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 9 of 20  PAGEID #: 96\nF.3d 767 (9th Cir. 2009), the court held that the use of a taser against a non-violent misdemeanant \narrestee standing twenty feet away from the arresting officers was unreasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment.  Similarly, in Richards v. Janis, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77929 (E.D. Wash., Oct. 17, \n2007), the court held that the use of a taser against an individual who was handcuffed, lying on the \nground, and restrained by three police officers created an issue of fact as to whether the force was \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n  In this case, the Defendants' actions meet or exceed the standard for liability set forth in the \nabove cases.  As Mr. Martin states, the Defendants use \"a weapon intended to be deployed in a \ndefensive  fashion\"  \"as  an  offensive  weapon  for  the  singular  purpose  of  inflicting  corporal \npunishment.\"  Rep. 16.  The Defendants often exhibit this practice during the booking process, tasing \nindividuals who are arrested for minor crimes, do not pose an immediate risk of harm, and are well \nwithin the physical control of the deputies.  For example, Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno was arrested for \ndisorderly conduct and was tased in drive stun mode while she was forcibly stripped in the presence \nof at least seven male and female deputies.  In Incident #08-116, the sergeant drive stunned an \narrestee who did not comply with an order to sit on a bench while she was surrounded by at least five \ndeputies, after which a deputy can be heard remarking to the arresting officer that being tased \"hurts \nlike hell.\" \n  These incidents are a few of the dozens of incidents in which the Defendants exhibited their \npattern and practice of using a taser to inflict pain without any justification on an individual arrested \nfor a minor offense.  Rep. 18 - 20.  The Defendants routinely use tasers on individuals who are not \nviolent, nor attempting to escape, and who are surrounded by numerous deputies who are exerting or \ncould easily exert hands-on control of the individual in lieu of utilizing the taser to inflict pain.  \nInstead, the Defendants \"routinely deploy the taser on detainees as a retaliatory measure for passive \n  9\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 10 of 20  PAGEID #: 97\nnon-compliance with their commands.\"  Rep. 22.  Based on the standard set by the Supreme Court \nand the Sixth Circuit, the Defendants are violating the Fourth Amendment rights of individuals in \ntheir custody. \n2.  Plaintiff Shreve is likely to succeed on his claim that the Defendants are violating the \nFourteenth Amendment rights of detainees. \n  The Defendants also have a pattern and practice of inappropriately using tasers against \npretrial detainees who have not been convicted of any crime and who are, therefore, not subject to \npunishment.  In situations that are covered by neither the Fourth nor the Eighth Amendments, the \nFourteenth Amendment protects pretrial detainees from force that amounts to punishment because \nthe Due Process Clause prohibits punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \nU.S. 520, 535 (1979); Phelps v. Coy, 286 F.3d 295, 300 (6th Cir. 2002).  The protections of the \nFourteenth Amendment for pretrial detainees \"are at least as great as the Eighth Amendment \nprotections available to a convicted prisoner.\"  County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 849, \nciting City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 244 (1983) and Bell, 441 U.S. at \n535. \n  Use of force against a pretrial detainee violates the Fourteenth Amendment if it \"shocks the \nconscience.\"  See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846-47 (1998).  \"Conduct intended \nto injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest is the sort of official action most \nlikely to rise to the conscience-shocking level\"  Id. at 849.  The Sixth Circuit interpreted the \nSupreme Court's conclusion in Lewis to mean that determining whether a particular act \"shocks the \nconscience\" depends on whether the actor had an opportunity to \"deliberate various alternatives\"โin \nwhich case the actor will be held liable if he was deliberately indifferent to an individual's \nconstitutional rightsโor whether exigent circumstances required a reflexive response, wherein the \n  10\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 11 of 20  PAGEID #: 98\nactor will only be liable if he acts \"maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing \nharm.\"  Claybrook v. Birchwell, 199 F.3d 350, 359 (6th Cir. 2000), citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 850-51.  \nThe Supreme Court further stated in Lewis that \"in the custodial situation of a prison, forethought \nabout an inmate's welfare is not only feasible but obligatory under a regime that incapacitates a \nprisoner to exercise ordinary responsibility for his own welfare.\"  Id. at 851. \n  Cases presenting similar circumstances to those alleged here have been found to support a \nclaim under the Fourteenth Amendment, even under the more deferential \"malicious and sadistic\" \nstandard.  In Lewis v. Downey, 581 F.3d 467, 477-78 (7th Cir. 2009), the court vacated the district \ncourt's grant of summary judgment, based on the detainee's allegations that he was tased before he \nhad an opportunity to comply with the officer's order.  In Orem v. Rephann, 523 F.3d 442, (4th Cir. \n2008), the court upheld the denial of summary judgment for a deputy who tased a detainee who was \nhandcuffed and restrained with a hobbling device in the back of a police cruiser.  In Council v. \nSutton, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 2886 at *14-*15 (11th Cir. 2010), the court denied qualified \nimmunity to officers accused of tasing a subdued detainee multiple times even though the detainee \ntried to crawl under his bed during the tasing.  In Smith v. Nesby, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83520 at \n*108, *116, *128-29 (N.D. Fla., Sept. 28, 2007), the court held that there was a question of fact as to \nwhether the use of tasers against a non-resistant, mentally impaired detainee shocked the conscience. \n  The Defendants' use of tasers shocks the conscience under both the \"deliberate indifference\" \nand \"malicious and sadistic\" standards.  The Defendants' routine use of tasers does not occur during \ndisturbances at the correction centers, but rather in response to typical behavior exhibited by \ndetainees, such as verbal refusal to comply with a deputy's order by an incapacitated detainee or a \nneed for assistance in one's cell.  Mr. Martin states that the use of force records are \"replete with \nexamples of deployment of the taser on passive, non-threatening detainees in the FCCC.\"  Rep. 16.  \n  11\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 12 of 20  PAGEID #: 99\nThe Defendants have an opportunity to deliberate as to how these typical and routine situations \nshould be handled, and their conduct should be analyzed under the \"deliberate indifference\" \nstandard. \n  The Defendants show deliberate indifference to the detainees' rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment, as they \"routinely deploy and use tasers as a 'first-strike' weapon without consideration, \nor use of, less painful, harmful, and injurious control tactics.\"  Rep. 6.  In fact, in many instances, the \ndeputies could simply exert hands-on control of the detainee to prevent the need for any use of force, \nlet alone a use of force that is purely intended to inflict pain to induce compliance.  For example, in \nIncident #09-114, the detainee was drive stunned when he was slow to comply with orders after \nbeing awakened in his cell, despite the fact that four deputies were standing by and could have \nintervened in lieu of the use of force.  Rep. 23.  The repeated use of tasers as first-strike weapons \nwhen deputies have time to deliberate and have ready alternatives such as hands-on control shocks \nthe conscience and demonstrates deliberate indifference to detainees' Fourteenth Amendment rights. \n  Furthermore,  the  Defendants'  practice  of  using  tasers  against  individuals  who  are \nmechanically restrained shows deliberate indifference to the detainees' Fourteenth Amendment \nrights.  In Incident 09-360, the deputy drive stunned a detainee with mental illness who was \nimmobilized in a four-point restraint chair and surrounded by numerous deputies.  A Franklin \nCounty Sheriff's deputy also tased Plaintiff Reed while he was leg-ironed to a bed in the emergency \nroom of Mt. Carmel hospital.  As Mr. Martin states in his report, such use \"on a subject that is \ncognitively impaired and rendered partially defenseless due to restraints . . . constitutes an egregious \nviolation of every standard, guideline, regulation, and relevant law\" with which he is familiar.  Rep. \n16. \n  12\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 13 of 20  PAGEID #: 100\n  Even in instances that could arguably be covered by the more deferential \"malicious and \nsadistic standard\" because they might involve exigent circumstances, the Defendants are violating \nindividuals' Fourteenth Amendment rights by acting maliciously and sadistically for the very \npurpose of causing harm.  In Incident #09-390, at least ten deputies assembled to remove a detainee \nwho was injuring himself from his cell.  Rep. 21 - 22.  The deputies largely stood around outside the \ncell while the sergeant tased the detainee fourteen times while ordering him to slide out of the cell.  \nInstead of executing a tactical plan to effectively accomplish the deputies' objective, they employed \nthe pain of the taser as corporal punishment on the detainee.  When the Defendants' first tased \nPlaintiff Reed in his cell, they demonstrated malice and sadism, as they repeatedly told him that \nwhen they tased him \"It's gonna hurt a lot\" and \"It's gonna fucking hurt bad.\"  Yet with the \nknowledge of the pain inflicted by the taser, they tased him several times, including a drive stun, \nwhen their stated purpose was to help him out of his cell to get medical attention after a seizure. \n  As Mr. Martin concludes in his report, the Defendants have \"totally abandoned\" their own \nregulations, as well as professional and legal standards, that are designed to control and limit the use \nof tasers, \"resulting in high levels of unnecessary pain and harm to the subject detainees.\"  Rep. 11.  \nBecause the Defendants are exhibiting a pattern and practice of acting with deliberate indifference to \nthe constitutional rights of detainees and in many instances acting maliciously and sadistically for \nthe very purpose of causing harm, they are violating these individuals' Fourteenth Amendment \nrights. \n3.  Plaintiff Shreve is likely to succeed on his claim that the Defendants are violating the \nEighth Amendment rights of inmates. \n  The Defendants use similar practices against individuals who are sentenced to a term of \nconfinement at the Franklin County Correction Centers.  The Eight Amendment protects convicted \n  13\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 14 of 20  PAGEID #: 101\nprisoners from cruel and unusual punishment.  Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S. 312, 318-19 (1986).  \n\"Whenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force in violation of the Cruel \nand Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out in Whitley: whether force \nwas applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to \ncause harm.\"  Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1992).  The factors to consider in determining \nwhether the use of force violates the Eighth Amendment include the \"need for application of force, \nthe relationship between that need and the amount of force used, the threat reasonably perceived by \nthe responsible officials, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\"  Id. at 8 \n(internal quotes omitted), citing Whitley, 475 U.S. at 321.  The Sixth Circuit has also described the \nstandard as whether \"the offending conduct reflects an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\"  \nCombs v. Wilkinson, 315 F.3d 548, 556 (6th Cir. 2002), citing Pelfrey v. Chambers, 43 F.3d 1034, \n1037 (6th Cir. 1995). \n  Courts have allowed allegations of Eighth Amendment violations to proceed to trial based on \nincidents similar to those cited by Plaintiff Shreve on behalf of the class.  In Parker v. Asher, 701 F. \nSupp. 192, 194-95 (D. Nev. 1998), the court held that an inmate's claim that a corrections officer \nmerely threatened the use of a taser while pointing the loaded taser at the inmate was sufficient to \nstate a claim under the Eighth Amendment.  In Shelton v. Angelone, 183 F. Supp. 830, 835-36 (W.D. \nVa. 2002), the court denied summary judgment to the prison official based on the inmate's claim that \nhe was repeatedly tased while restrained in leg irons and handcuffs. \n  The Eighth Amendment standard is the most difficult to meet, and yet the incidents cited \nthroughout the complaint, this motion, and Mr. Martin's report show that the Defendants continually \nviolate even this deferential standard.  The routine use of tasers, particularly in drive stun mode, \nrepresents an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain because the Defendants rely on tasers as \n  14\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 15 of 20  PAGEID #: 102\npain compliance tools instead of as defensive mechanisms.  Rep. 16.  The Defendants' malice and \nsadism is reflected in their repeated statements to individuals that being tased will be extremely \npainful; often these statements are laced with profanity or used as taunts.  Rep. 23.  In these \nincidents, the Defendants' use of tasers far exceeds the amount of force needed to accomplish their \nobjective.  Numerous deputies are routinely present and able to exert hands-on control of an inmate, \nand there is no indication that the deputies would face any particular risk of harm to themselves in \ndoing so.  By relying on the taser instead of considering alternative uses of force, the Defendants fail \nto temper the severity of their forceful response.  Therefore, they are violating these inmates' Eighth \nAmendment rights. \n4.  Plaintiff Shreve is likely to succeed on the merits based on the Defendants' pattern \nand practice of constitutional violations, which continues unabated because the \nSheriff and other supervisors ratify the deputies' abusive use of tasers. \n  The Sheriff and other supervisors are liable for the constitutional violations by the deputies \nbecause there is a pattern and practice of failing to train deputies on the appropriate use of tasers, \nratifying the unconstitutional use of tasers by finding the uses to be \"justified,\" and not imposing \ndiscipline on deputies who misuse tasers.  These supervisors are accountable under Section 1983 for \nactions taken pursuant to their policy, practice, or custom.  Monell v. Dept. of Social Svcs., 436 U.S. \n658, 690-91 (1978).  Supervisory liability can be based on a failure to provide officers with adequate \ntraining.  City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 (1989).  Liability can also be based on a \nsupervisor's ratification of unconstitutional conduct by failing to investigate or approving of the \nconduct.  Marchese v. Lucas, 758 F.2d 181 (6th Cir. 1985); Leach v. Shelby County Sheriff, 891 F.2d \n1241, 1248 (6th Cir. 1989).  All three bases for supervisory liability are present in this case. \n  15\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 16 of 20  PAGEID #: 103\n  According to their own policies, supervisors at the FCCCs, the Internal Affairs Bureau, and \nthe Sheriff or his designee must review each use of force report and determine whether the use of \nforce was justified.  As Mr. Martin concludes in his report, \"FCCC supervisors fail to properly \nreview and investigate incidents that contain clear and objective evidence of improper deployment of \nthe X26 taser, thus allowing FCCC officers to engage in such wrongdoing with impunity.\"  Rep. 7.  \nHe states that \"Of the many incidents reviewed in which evidence was present of violations of FCCC \nand state regulations, I identified no more than two incidents in which any adverse finding was \nentered.  This near-total failure to exercise proper oversight of officers' use and deployment of the \ntaser allows these practices to continue in wholly unabated fashion, causing needless harm, pain, and \ninjury to detainees held in the custody of the FCCC.\"  Rep. 26.  In case after case, the deputies' \nroutine use of tasers in violation of the Sheriff's Office policy also indicates that the Defendants have \nfailed to train the deputies on the appropriate use of tasers.  This lack of accountability throughout \nthe chain of command shows that the Sheriff and other supervisors are responsible for the pattern \nand practice of abusive taser use among the deputies at the FCCCs. \n  For these reasons, Plaintiff Shreve, on behalf of the proposed class, meets the first prong for \nthe granting of a preliminary injunction because he is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim \nthat the Defendants have a pattern and practice of violating the constitutional rights of individuals in \ntheir custody. \nB.  Arrestees and detainees will continue to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an \ninjunction. \n  Due  to  the  Defendants'  ongoing  pattern  and  practice  of  using  tasers  to  violate  the \nconstitutional rights of individuals in their custody, arrestees and detainees will continue to suffer the \nviolation of their constitutional rights and the infliction of unwarranted serious physical pain in the \n  16\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 17 of 20  PAGEID #: 104\nabsence of an injunction.  \"The existence of a continuing constitutional violation constitutes proof of \nan irreparable harm, and its remedy certainly would serve the public interest.\"  Preston v. Thompson, \n589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 (7th Cir. 1978) (prison conditions including showers and recreation), citing \nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (First Amendment).  In fact, one district court has stated \nthat  \"when reviewing a motion for a preliminary injunction, if it is found that a constitutional right \nis being threatened or impaired, a finding of irreparable injury is mandated.\"  Mich. Rehab. Clinic \nInc., P.C. v. City of Detroit, 310 F. Supp. 2d 867, 871 (E.D. Mich. 2004) (citing Elrod).  As detailed \nabove, the Defendants are continuing to violate the Fourth, Fourteenth, and Eighth Amendment \nrights of individuals in their custody through their use of tasers, which establishes that these \nindividuals will continue to suffer irreparable harm. \n  In addition to the ongoing constitutional violations, Plaintiff Shreve and the proposed class \nwill continue to suffer irreparable harm in the form of serious physical pain.  Mr. Martin emphasizes \nthat \"the taser can inflict intense pain and carries a high risk of injury if used unnecessarily or \nexcessively.\"  Rep. 11.  Exacerbating the risk of physical harm is the fact that \"FCCC officers \nroutinely deploy the X26 taser in disregard of safety precautions associated with its deployment.\"  \nRep. 20.  \"Unnecessary pain and aggravation of injury\" are a form of irreparable harm that can \nsupport a preliminary injunction.  Hadix v. Caruso, 461 F. Supp. 2d 574 (E.D. Mich. 2006), \nremanded on other grounds in Hadix v. Caruso, 248 Fed. Appx. 678 (6th Cir. 2007).  Therefore, \nbecause these individuals will continue to suffer irreparable harm in the form of the violation of their \nconstitutional rights and the infliction of serious physical pain, they have met the requirements of the \nsecond prong for the granting of a preliminary injunction. \n  17\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 18 of 20  PAGEID #: 105\nC.  The balance of equities tip in favor of the Plaintiffs because the Defendants will not suffer \nsubstantial harm if this Court issues a preliminary injunction. \n  The Sixth Circuit has described this third prong as \"whether issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction would cause substantial harm to others.\"  Leary v. Daeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 736 (6th Cir. \n2000), citing McPherson v. Michigan High Sch. Athletic Ass'n, 119 F.3d 453, 459 (6th Cir. 1997) (en \nbanc).  In this motion, Plaintiff Shreve is primarily requesting that the Defendants be ordered to \nfollow their own policies for the use of tasers, which they are routinely disregarding.  As Mr. Martin \nstates, \"it is these regulations and standards that FCCC officers and their supervisors have routinely \nand egregiously abandoned.\"  Rep. 11.  The Defendants will not be harmed by a requirement that \nthey follow their own policies because tasers are not the only means available to the Defendants for \ncontrolling individuals in their custody, and they will continue to be able to use tasers โ when they \nare a necessary and appropriate use of force. \n  In addition, Plaintiff Shreve requests that the Defendants be prohibited from using the tasers \nin drive stun mode unless there is an immediate need to prevent loss of life or serious bodily harm.  \nThe Defendants' abusive use of tasers in drive stun mode is particularly egregious due to its limited \nutility and sole reliance on the infliction of serious physical pain to induce compliance.  In fact, the \nAmerican Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice Treatment of Prisoners, Third Edition, \nstates that correctional policies governing the use of electronic weaponry such as tasers should \n\"forbid the use of electronic weaponry in drive-stun or direct contact mode.\"  Standard 23-5.8(a)(v).  \nWhen this reasonable limitation on the Defendants' use of force tactics is balanced against \npreventing the violation of the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights and the infliction of serious physical \npain, the equities tip in favor of the Plaintiffs. \n  18\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 6 Filed: 07/23/10 Page: 19 of 20  PAGEID #: 106\nD.  The public interest will be served by this Court granting the preliminary injunction. \n  As the Seventh Circuit stated in Preston, the remedy of constitutional violations always \nserves the public interest.  Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300, 303 n.3 (7th Cir. 1978).  The relief \nrequested by the Plaintiffs here serves the public interest by preventing the continued violation of \nindividuals' constitutional rights, while also retaining the Defendants' ability to maintain safety and \nsecurity at the Franklin County Correction Centers.  Therefore, the public interest will be served by \nthe preliminary injunction. \nIII. CONCLUSION \n  Plaintiff Shreve has demonstrated on behalf of the proposed class that the Defendants have a \npattern and practice of violating the constitutional rights of individuals in their custody by inflicting \nunwarranted physical pain through the use of tasers.  In order to prevent the continuing violations of \nthese individuals' rights and to protect their bodily integrity, it is necessary that this Court grant a \npreliminary injunction that requires the Defendants to follow their own policy for taser use, prohibits \nthe use of tasers in drive stun mode unless there is an immediate need to prevent loss of life or \nserious bodily harm, and permits Plaintiff's counsel to monitor the Defendants' compliance with the \ninjunction by requiring the Defendants to provide biweekly reports of taser use. \nTherefore, Plaintiff Shreve respectfully requests that his motion be granted. \n                Respectfully Submitted, \n               s/ Jane P.

INTRODUCTION\n1. Each paragraph in this Complaint incorporates all others.\n2. This Third Amended Complaint challenges two practices at the Franklin County \nCorrections Centers. \n3. The first practice challenged in this Complaint involves subjecting detainees at \nthe Franklin County Corrections Centers to the excessive and disproportionate use of force by \ncorrections deputies of the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n4. This challenged practice is carried out through the frequent and gratuitous use of \ntasers to inflict pain, fear, corporal punishment and humiliation.\n5. Tasers deliver a minimum 5-second 50,000 volt electrical shock that causes \nexcruciating pain. Landis v. Baker, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 21946, at *6 n.4 (6th Cir. 2008). \nDeputies are able to deliver more than 5 seconds of electricity simply by continuing to press the \ntaserโs trigger.  As long as the trigger is depressed, the electrical shock continues.\n6. Tasers operate in two different modes.  The primary use is to subdue a person at a \nsafe distance by firing two darts or probes that strike and attach to the person.  Thereafter, an \nelectrical discharge produces temporary neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI) which \ninstantaneously and completely immobilizes the person.  โA stun gun inflicts a painful and \nfrightening blow, which temporarily paralyzes the large muscles of the body, rendering the \nvictim helpless.โ  Kijowski v. City of Niles, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 7222, at *16 (6th Cir. 2010).\n3\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 4 of 54  PAGEID #: 2024\n7. Tasers can also be used in โdrive stunโ mode.  According to the Taser \nInternational Website Manual, drive stun mode is the โpain compliance option.โ  As the Taser \nManual describes it: โDrive-stun Taser use produces a continuous extremely painful electrical \nshock useful for an officer engaged in close hand to hand contact with a resisting subject; pain \nforces the resisting subject to stop violently resisting and submit to handcuffingโฆ.โ\n8. Franklin County Sheriffโs deputies are aware of how painful it is to be tased.  \nNear the end of a video tape of the tasing of a female detainee during booking at Franklin County \nCorrections Center I, a Franklin County deputy asks a police officer from The Ohio State \nUniversity (OSU) campus if he has ever been tased.  When the officer responded no, the sheriffโs \ndeputy replied, โThey hurt like hell.โ  Internal Affairs Report #08-116.\n9. At all times relevant to this Complaint, it was the custom, policy and practice of \nFranklin County Sheriffโs corrections deputies to repeatedly use their tasers in a callous and \nsadistic manner that violates the Franklin County Sheriffโs own regulations for deployment of \ntasers; departs from well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; \nposes substantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of detainees; \nhas caused needless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional rights of \ndetainees at the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\n10. The second practice challenged in this Complaint involves the practice by \nFranklin County Sheriffโs Office corrections employees of violating the Fourth Amendment right \nto privacy of detainees at the Franklin County Corrections Centers. \n11. At all times relevant to this Complaint, it was the custom, policy and practice of Franklin \nCounty Sheriffโs corrections employees to carry out the forcible stripping of detainees arrested on \nmisdemeanor charges without adequate justification for this humiliating use of force; without affording \n4\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 5 of 54  PAGEID #: 2025\nthe affected detainees the opportunity to change their clothing in private; and by stripping detainees in \nthe presence of and with the assistance of opposite sex deputies\nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n12. This court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffsโ Third Amended \nComplaint pursuant to 28U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343(3) and 1343(4).  Venue is proper in this district \nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391 because all parties reside in this district and the events or omissions \ngiving rise to Plaintiffsโ Complaint occurred in this district.\nIII. PARTIES\n13. Plaintiff Robert Shreve was at all times relevant to this action a resident of \nFranklin County, Ohio.\n14. Plaintiff Shreve was incarcerated at the Franklin County Corrections Center II \n(FCCC II) at the time of filing the original Complaint on July 16, 2010.\n15. Plaintiff Michael Worley was at all times relevant to this action a resident of \nFranklin County, Ohio.\n16. Plaintiff Worley was incarcerated at FCCC II at the time of filing the First \nAmended Complaint on August 27, 2010.\n17. Plaintiff Michael Reed was at all times relevant to this action a resident of \nFranklin County, Ohio.\n18. Plaintiff Reed was not incarcerated at the time of filing the original Complaint on \nJuly 16, 2010.\n19. Plaintiff Dawn Fiore-Bruno was at all times relevant to this action a resident of \nFranklin County, Ohio.\n20. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno was not incarcerated at the time of filing the original \nComplaint on July 16, 2010.\n5\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 6 of 54  PAGEID #: 2026\n21. Defendant Franklin County is a unit of local government organized under the laws \nof the State of Ohio.\n22. Defendant Jim Karnes was at all times relevant to this action the Sheriff of \nFranklin County, Ohio.  He is sued in his official capacity.\n23. Defendant Mark Barrett was at all times relevant to this action the Chief Deputy, \nCorrections for the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n24. Defendant Barrett is the deputy in charge of the operations of Franklin Countyโs \ntwo correctional facilities, Franklin County Corrections Center I at 370 S. Front Street in \nColumbus, Ohio and Franklin County Corrections Center II at 2460 Jackson Pike in Columbus, \nOhio.\n25. Defendant Barrett reviews and approves all use of force reports from all Franklin \nCounty corrections deputies, including use of force reports involving deployment of tasers.  He is \nsued in his individual and official capacities.\n26. Defendant Stephan L. Martin was at all times relevant to this action the Chief \nDeputy, Investigations for the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n27.

Defendants Michael Herrell, Geoffrey Stobart and Doug Edgington were the \nfacility commanders for FCCC I and FCCC II during almost all times relevant to this action.\n32. From January 1, 2009, to August 3, 2009, there was no facility commander for \nFCCC I.  During that time period, Defendant Barrett was the de facto facility commander in his \nrole as Chief Deputy of Corrections.\n33. As FCCC I and II facility commanders, Defendants Herrell, Stobart, Edgington \nand Barrett reviewed all use of force reports from Franklin County corrections deputies who \nworked at the correctional facilities, including use of force reports involving deployment of \ntasers.

Nurse Mehl either ordered or acquiesced in Fiore-\nBrunoโs placement in a safety gown, during which Ms. Fiore-Bruno was forcibly stripped. \nDefendant Mehl is sued in her individual capacity.\nIV. POLICY AND PRACTICE OF EXCESSIVE USE OF TASERS BY DEFENDANTS\n39. Under Ohio law, Sheriff Karnes makes the policy for the county with regard to \nthe operation of his office and discharge of his duties.\n40. According to the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office policy, the Chief Deputy of \nCorrections, Defendant Barrett, assigns X26 Tasers to corrections officers at his discretion.  \nAR800:2, Section 2.1.\n41. According to this same policy, tasers are to be deployed โto gain control of a \nviolent or dangerous inmateโฆwhen attempts to subdue the inmate by conventional tactics have \nbeen or are likely to be ineffective or there is reasonable expectation that it will be unsafe for \ndeputies to approach within contact range of the inmate.โ  AR800:2, Section 1.3.\n42. This policy permits taser deployment in the following circumstances:  self-\ndefense; protection of another inmate or staff; disarming an inmate under non-lethal conditions; \npreventing self-harm to an inmate; or controlling a combative inmate.  AR800:2, Sections 1.3.1 -\n1.3.5.\n43. According to policy, tasers should not be deployed upon persons who are \n8\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 9 of 54  PAGEID #: 2029\nrestrained by a mechanical device such as handcuffs, leg irons or a restraint chair.  AR800:2, \nSection 3.1.14\n44. Further, the policy provides that the taser is not recommended for use on women \nknown to be pregnant.  AR800:2, Section 5.5 states that corrections officers should not use tasers \nto โharass, taunt, interrogate, interview, threaten, or belittle any persons,โ  AR800:2, Section 5.3.\n45. Under the policy, every time a deputy uses a taser he or she must generate a Use \nof Force Report which is forwarded through the chain of command.  AR800:2, Section 4.5.\n46. The Franklin County Sheriffโs Office Use of Force policy states that each shift \nsupervisor must compile a summary of each use of force report and forward this to Internal \nAffairs.  AR801, Section 2.3.\n47. Internal Affairs must then review all use of force reports, interview all persons \nwith knowledge of the event, and make a determination of whether or not the use of force was in \ncompliance with department policy, that is, whether the use of force was โjustified.โ  AR801, \nSections 2.5 - 2.6.  On information and belief, the Internal Affairs review also includes video \ntapes of each use of force incident, including tapes made by hand-held cameras operated by \ndeputies.\n48. Internal Affairs then forwards this record and its use of force determination to the \nFranklin County Sheriff or his designee for review of the entire record.  The Sheriff or his \ndesignee may either accept or reject the finding of Internal Affairs.  AR801, Sections 2.7 - 2.8.  \nIf the use of force is ultimately determined to be โjustified,โ no discipline is imposed on the \ndeputy or deputies involved.\n49. Thus, the chain of command for reviewing all reports involving use of tasers by \nFranklin County Sheriffโs deputies includes shift supervisors, the Internal Affairs Bureau and the \n9\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 10 of 54  PAGEID #: 2030\nSheriff or his designee.  The Franklin County Sheriff or his designee makes the final \ndetermination of whether the use of tasers, or any other use of force, was justified.\n50. Franklin County corrections deputies routinely violate the Sheriffโs Office policy \non deployment of tasers.  These practices are captured in the written use of force reports and on \nvideotapes recorded by the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office in scores of cases since at least \nJanuary 1, 2008.\n51. Franklin County corrections deputies regularly use tasers in situations where the \nperson does not remotely present a threat of violent behavior or harm to self or others, and \nroutinely and deliberately use tasers as first strike weapons without employing or even \nconsidering less painful or harmful control tactics.\n52. In case after case, deputies tase people, often in the drive stun mode to cause pain, \nwhen the person was greatly outnumbered by a team of deputies who were easily able to \nphysically overpower and control the individual, or accomplish the task at hand, thereby \neliminating any objective threat to the personโs own safety or that of the deputies.\n53. In a number of instances, corrections deputies tased arrestees or inmates while \nthey were in mechanical restraints.  In one case, an inmate was even tased in drive stun mode \nwhile fully immobilized in a four point restraint chair.  The use of force in this instance was \nfound โjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #09-360.\n54. It is common for deputies to tase a person whose only offense was failure to obey \ndeputiesโ verbal commands, which is classified as a โminor rule violationโ that does not pose a \nthreat to staff or inmates under the Sheriffโs own administrative regulation.1  Thus, the threshold \nfor use of the taser is often only a minor breach of jail discipline.\n                                               \n1 Under AR 804 5.1.  โMinor rule violations shall includeโฆ.failure to comply with an order by \nstaff.โ\n10\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 11 of 54  PAGEID #: 2031\n55. Deputies also use the taser as a retaliatory weapon when detainees show verbal \nresistance or question authority by using profanity or making derogatory remarks to staff, despite \nthat fact that this too is considered only a โminor rule violationโ under Sheriffโs Office policy.2\n56. Comparisons of the videotapes to the deputiesโ written use of force reports also \nshow that deputies often embellish or misrepresent the circumstances under which people were \ntased.  The written reports describe the persons they tased as โcombative,โ โunrulyโ or \nโresistingโ when the actual video showed that the person was yelling and/or cursing at deputies \nin a manner that was irritating, but not a physical threat.\n57. In other instances, the โresistanceโ was passive, not combative or active, in \nnature, such as a person refusing to place hands behind the back, failing or refusing to remove a \npiece of jewelry or clothing, or a person who crossed his or her arms across the chest in self-\nprotection against a forced cuffing or stripping.\n58. For example, deputies tased a woman, who previously told them she was \npregnant, for being unable to remove her tongue ring because her hands were too slippery.  \nDeputies tased her after they refused her repeated requests to use a paper towel to remove the \ntongue ring.  After tasing her the deputies finally gave her a paper towel which enabled her to \nremove the tongue ring without difficulty.  The tasing of this woman was found to be a \nโjustifiedโ use of force.  Internal Affairs Report #09-399.\n59. In many other instances, deputies tased persons for being โuncooperative.โ  These \nindividuals were not violent or threatening violence.  They were simply so impaired by alcohol \nor drugs that they were incapable of comprehending or complying with the deputiesโ commands, \nas shown in a video that depicts a young male arrested on a misdemeanor charge who is clearly \n                                               \n2 Under AR 804 5.2 minor rule violations include โprofanity, derogatory remarks or gestures to \nany member of the staffโฆ.โ\n11\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 12 of 54  PAGEID #: 2032\ncognitively impaired by drugs or alcohol.  In the video of this case, the corporal in charge told \nthe man โI donโt know what youโre on.โ\n60. Several deputies had taken this man to a cell in order to change him from his \nstreet clothes into jail clothes.  The corporal, who had a taser, informed the other deputies that \nโhe hasnโt been a threat to us but if I say โtaserโ move out of the way.โ\n61. The video shows that the young man complied with the corporalโs commands to \nremove his ring, shirt, shoes and pants but did so slowly, with deputies needing to assist at times.  \nThe man had removed all clothing but his underwear when the corporal ordered him to sit down \non a bench.  The man remained standing after several commands to sit down.  The corporal then \ntased him multiple times, including drive stuns, and pistol whipped him with the taser.  The \ndeputyโs use of the taser in this case was found โjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #09-258.\n62. Corrections deputies routinely and deliberately use tasers in drive stun mode as a \nform of corporal punishment for behavior that does not remotely involve violent resistance by a \nsubject, or constitute a physical or security threat.\n63. One example of this is captured in the video of a man arrested for a misdemeanor.  \nHe was handcuffed behind his back and was not acting out in a threatening manner.  Sgt. Mychal \nTurner tased this man twice with probes because he got up from a bench and began to walk \naround in the booking area while another deputy watched over him.  The man was kneeling on \nthe floor, incapacitated by the earlier tasings, when the Sergeant then drive stunned him twice \nbecause the man did not immediately obey further commands to get up from the floor and sit \ndown on the bench.  The tasing of this man was reviewed and found to be โjustified.โ  Internal \nAffairs Report #10-009.\n64. Corrections deputies also routinely and deliberately tase people who are \n12\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 13 of 54  PAGEID #: 2033\nparticularly vulnerable because of physical and mental disabilities. Deputies often respond \ninappropriately to such persons in a manner that escalates conflict and actually increases the \nlikelihood that excessive force will be used.\n65. One video depicts deputies who came to the cell of an inmate with mental illness \nto move him to another location.  When deputies opened the cell door the inmate was holding a \nmat in front of him and speaking unintelligibly.  The inmateโs actions and demeanor show that \nhe was disoriented.  Sgt. Turner tased this inmate for not standing up and tased him again for \nmoving his arms and legs, stating โIโm tired of playing with you.โ  Turner continued to tase this \nmentally impaired inmate when he tried to crawl under the bed.  The inmate was finally pulled \nout of the cell, still clutching the mat. He was put in leg irons and tased again when he would not \nlet go of the mat. The use of force in this instance was found โjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report \n#09-018.\n66. In another video, deputies came to a cell ostensibly to assist a mentally ill inmate \nwho was banging his head against his bed.  Instead of entering the cell to remove the inmate, a \nteam of deputies stood around outside the cell while a sergeant repeatedly tased this inmate a \ntotal of fourteen times because he would not slide out of the cell by himself.  This use of force \nwas found to be โjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #09-390.\n67. Corrections deputies also routinely and deliberately deploy tasers for pain and \nsubjugation during the forced stripping of arrestees who should not be subjected to such a \nhumiliating practice.\n68. Often, when an arrestee voices a verbal objection to having to remove his or her \nclothes, or otherwise shows any lack of cooperation during the booking process, such as failing \nto answer routine medical questions from a nurse, a team of deputies takes the person into a side \n13\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 14 of 54  PAGEID #: 2034\ntank, forcibly strips the individual without telling the person why they are being โdressed out,โ \nand tases the person if there is any degree of resistance, including passive or verbal resistance, to \nbeing stripped.\n69. For example, one video shows a twenty one year old woman, brought in for \ndriving without an operatorโs license, a misdemeanor, who was stripped and tased four times.  \nDuring booking, she verbally expressed her displeasure at being arrested but was not aggressive\nor threatening.  The deputies grabbed her already injured arm and she complained they were \nhurting her.  When she voiced these complaints, deputies whisked her into a โside tankโ where \ndeputies pushed her face first into a wall and then forced her to the floor, face down.\n70. Although deputies described this young woman as โviolentlyโ resisting, at least \nfour deputies controlled her arms, trunk and legs and she could only squirm.  With two male \ndeputies present, and another male deputy filming with a hand-held camera, the team of deputies \nforcibly stripped her while she constantly asked โwhat are you doing to me?โ  She was left lying \nnaked, face down on the floor of her cell.  Deputies left only a safety gown for her to wear, \ndespite the fact that she presented no objective risk of self harm.3  This use of force was also \nfound โjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #09-147.\n71. In another case, the Ohio State Patrol brought a Hispanic man to the jail on traffic \ncharges.  He was also suspected of possibly being a deportable felon wanted by the United States \nImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which turned out to be a case of mistaken \nidentity.  The video shows that deputies booked this man and then took him into a side tank \nwhere he was ordered to strip.\n                                               \n3 The safety or suicide gown is a shapeless green gown that is supposed to be used for \narrestees or inmates who are threatening self-harm.  When a person is placed in a safety gown he \nor she is not even allowed to wear underwear.\n14\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 15 of 54  PAGEID #: 2035\n72. Deputies ordered the man to pull his underwear down, turn around, bend over and \nโspread your ass cheeks.โ  The man refused to comply with this humiliating request.  Sgt. Turner \nagain ordered the man to bend over and spread his cheeks so that he could be checked for \nโcontrabandโ even though these deputies had no reason to suspect that the man possessed drugs \nand he had already had a pat-down search and clothing search.  He again refused and Turner then \ntased him.  The intense pain led the man to obey Turnerโs command.  Afterwards, he asked \nTurner โwhy you mess with me like that?โ  In response to the manโs question, Turner replied in a \nloud voice, โThis is jail.โ  Turnerโs use of the taser in this case was reviewed and found to be \nโjustified.โ  Internal Affairs Report #08-272.\n73. Sheriff Karnes, as the policy maker for the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office, as \nwell as Deputy Chiefs Barrett and Martin, members of the Internal Affairs Bureau and the \nfacility commanders of the Franklin County Corrections Centers are responsible for the policy \nand practice of excessive and abusive use of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections \nofficers.  This is because, as set out in this Complaint:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified.โ\nb)  They fail to discipline deputies whose use of tasers violates the Franklin County \nSheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs from well-established \nstandards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses substantial and \nunjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the persons tased; causes \nneedless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional rights of \npersons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \n15\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 16 of 54  PAGEID #: 2036\nComplaint, they have failed to properly train corrections deputies to use tasers in \naccordance with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office written policy; to use tasers in \naccordance with manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use tasers in \naccordance with accepted law enforcement principles for use of force; and to use tasers in \naccordance with the federal Constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free from \nexcessive force.\n74. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett \nand Martin, and Defendants Klumpp, Forino, Stobart, Williamson, Herrell, and Edgington in \ntheir official and individual capacities constitute deliberate indifference that in turn makes \nDefendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to the Plaintiffs in this action.\nV. POLICY AND PRACTICE OF VIOLATION OF RIGHT TO PRIVACY\n75. Under Ohio law, Sheriff Karnes makes the policy for the county with regard to \nthe operation of his office and discharge of his duties.\n76. Franklin County Sheriffโs Office policy addresses suicidal detainees, including \nthe placement of detainees into safety gowns.  Placement in a safety gown involves removal of \nall of the personโs clothing, including underwear. \n77. According to the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office policy in effect at all times \nrelevant to this Complaint, detainees were not to be placed in a safety gown unless they \ndisplayed suicidal ideation or suicidal acts or gestures.  \n78. Franklin County corrections deputies and intake nurses routinely violated this \npolicy by forcibly stripping detainees arrested on misdemeanor charges and placing them in \nsafety gowns, not because they displayed suicidal ideation, acts or gestures but rather to \nhumiliate and/or punish the individual. \n79. Detainees were stripped and placed in safety gowns because they did not answer \n16\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 17 of 54  PAGEID #: 2037\nnurseโs questions at intake or showed some other lack of cooperation in the booking process.  \nDeputiesโ reports often referred to these individuals as โuncooperativeโ or โunrulyโ at intake.\n80. These detainees were forcibly stripped without being told why their clothing was \nbeing removed and were not given an opportunity to remove their own clothing with only same \nsex deputies present.\n81. Male deputies were present throughout the forced stripping of female detainees.  \nMale deputies participated in the restraint of female detainees, in the removal of their clothing, \nand in some cases filmed the process with a hand-held camera.  \n82. The hand-held videos of these stripped detainees, which show them completely \nnaked, are public records subject to dissemination upon request.  \n83. Sheriff Karnes, as the policy maker for the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office, as \nwell as Deputy Chiefs Barrett and Martin, members of the Internal Affairs Bureau and the \nfacility commanders of the Franklin County Corrections Centers are responsible for the policy \nand practice of violating the Fourth Amendment right to privacy of detainees who are forcibly \nstripped in the presence of opposite sex deputies absent justifiable safety concerns.  This is \nbecause, as set out in this Complaint:\na) They routinely ratify the conduct of corrections employees who participate in \nthis practice by reviewing the use of force reports and videotapes of forced strippings and \nfinding this to be a โjustifiedโ use of force.\nb) They fail to discipline corrections employees who engage in the forcible \nstripping of detainees when that conduct violates Franklin County Sheriffโs own written \npolicy; departs from well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections \nprofessionals; poses substantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical \n17\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 18 of 54  PAGEID #: 2038\nintegrity of the persons stripped; causes needless physical harm and mental distress; and \nviolates the Constitutional right to privacy of the detainees who are subjected to this \nhumiliating practice. \nc) They failed to properly train corrections deputies on compliance with the \nFranklin County Sheriffโs Office written policy on placement of persons in safety gowns; \nand on the need to comply with the federal Constitutional rights of persons in custody to be \nfree from violations of their right to privacy.\n84. The policies and practices of Defendants Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Forino, \nKlumpp,  Stobart, Williamson, Herrell and Edgington in their official and individual capacities \nconstitute deliberate indifference to the violations of the constitutional right to privacy that in \nturn makes Defendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to the Plaintiffs in this action.\n85. Along with those cases discussed above, the facts in the cases of named Plaintiffs \nRobert Shreve, Michael Worley, Michael Reed, and Dawn Fiore-Bruno exemplify the policy and \npractice of abusive and excessive use of tasers by Franklin County Corrections deputies as well \nas the practice of violating the right of privacy of detainees by Franklin County Corrections \nemployees.\nVI. PLAINTIFF ROBERT SHREVE - STATEMENT OF FACTS\n86. Plaintiff Shreve is deaf.  He was brought to FCCC I on a misdemeanor charge, \ndomestic violence, at a few minutes after midnight on July 19, 2009.\n87. The video of his case shows that he arrived in the back of a Columbus Police \nDepartment wagon.  He was handcuffed behind his back and his legs were restrained by a hobble \nstrap because, according to Columbus police, he was a โfighter.โ\n88. A team of at least six sheriffโs deputies and Cpl. Debra Cantrell assembled at the \npolice wagon to take Mr. Shreve from police custody and into the jail booking area.\n18\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 19 of 54  PAGEID #: 2039\n89. Cpl. Cantrell had her taser out before Mr. Shreve was even lifted from the police \nwagon.\n90. A Columbus police officer told Cpl. Cantrell and the other deputies that Mr. \nShreve was deaf and could not speak English.\n91. Mr. Shreve was removed from the police wagon without incident and was held by \ndeputies.  He went limp and was carried into the jail booking area by three deputies.\n92. Once inside the booking area, Mr. Shreve was placed face down on the floor and \nheld there by a team of deputies.\n93. Deputy Jonathan Roush had Mr. Shreveโs left arm; Deputy Douglas Robinson had \nhis right arm; and Deputy Christopher Lee had his legs.  Cpl. Cantrell stood by with her taser \nout.\n94. Mr. Shreve is not a big man.  He is 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs 165 pounds.\n95. The Deputiesโ reports state that Mr. Shreve was โattempting to kick and move \nabout on the floor struggling with staff.โ  In her report, Cpl. Cantrell stated that Mr. Shreve \nโcontinued to struggle and thrash aboutโ and was โcombative.โ  She also stated that Mr. Shreve \nwas trying to bite one of the deputies.\n96. These descriptions do not accurately reflect the actual video tape of Mr. Shreveโs \nbooking.\n97. The video shows that it would have been physically impossible for him to bite \nanyone because he was handcuffed behind his back and pinned, face down on the floor, by three \ndeputies.  Deputies Roush and Robinson were on his right and left upper body and Deputy Lee \nheld Mr. Shreveโs legs down.\n98. Although he did move his legs to one side he was not kicking.  His legs were \n19\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 20 of 54  PAGEID #: 2040\nhobbled and restrained by the deputies.  It was not physically possible for him to โthrash aboutโ \nor be โcombativeโ with three deputies on top of him.\n99. A fourth deputy, Nicholas Williams, also stepped in and, with both hands, pressed \nMr. Shreveโs face into the floor in a head lock.  In total, he was handcuffed behind the back, in \nleg irons and held down by four deputies.  Their intended task was to exchange handcuffs and \nreturn the original set of cuffs to the Columbus police officers.\n100. While all four deputies immobilized Mr. Shreve face down, Cpl. Cantrell stepped \nin and tased Mr. Shreveโs leg in drive stun mode.  He gave a guttural cry of pain.  Cpl. Cantrell \nthen asked the deputies, โDid that soften him up?โ\n101. After the deputies exchanged the handcuffs, Cpl. Cantrell then leaned over \nMr. Shreve and told him to โrelax, relax,โ as if he could hear her instructions.  She later \nremarked, โHeโs freakinโ because he canโt hear.โ\n102. Mr. Shreve was then taken to a side tank where his clothes were removed and he \nwas placed in jail clothing without further incident.\n103. Cpl. Cantrellโs use of the taser in drive stun mode to โsoften upโ Mr. Shreve was \ndeemed to be a โjustifiedโ use of force.\nVII. ROBERT SHREVE INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO \nDEFENDANTS CANTRELL, ROUSH, WILLIAMS, COLEMAN, GILES, EAGAN, \nMORGAN, ROBINSON AND LEE\n104. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Cantrell, Roush, Williams, \nColeman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee were state actors by virtue of their \nemployment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n105. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n106. As an arrestee, Plaintiff Shreve was protected by the Fourth Amendmentโs \n20\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 21 of 54  PAGEID #: 2041\nprotection against use of excessive force by law enforcement.\n107. Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officers may only use reasonable \nforce, that is, the amount of force that is reasonable to protect officers from a perceived threat.\n108. The use of the taser in drive stun mode against Plaintiff Shreve by Defendants \nCantrell, Roush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee was a willful, \ncallous and gratuitous act that violated Plaintiff Shreveโs Fourth Amendment right to be free \nfrom the use of excessive force. \n109. The fact that Defendants Roush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, \nRobinson and Lee were not the officers who tased Mr. Shreve does not diminish their \nculpability.  These deputies were present, were active participants who subdued Mr. Shreve, \nwere aware that Deputy Cantrell was going to tase Mr. Shreve as he lay in their grasp, and had \nthe opportunity to stop it from occurring.\n110. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive use of force by Defendants \nCantrell, Roush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee, Plaintiff Shreve \nsuffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n111. Plaintiff Shreve is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants Cantrell, \nRoush, Williams, Coleman, Giles, Eagan, Morgan, Robinson and Lee acted with reckless or \ncallous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to protection against the use of \nexcessive force.\nVIII. ROBERT SHREVE INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO \nDEFENDANTS FRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF JIM KARNES, CHIEF DEPUTY \nMARK BARRETT, CHIEF DEPUTY STEVE MARTIN, INTERNAL AFFAIRS \nDEPUTIES FORINO, KLUMPP, WILLIAMSON AND STOBART, MAJOR MICHAEL \nHERRELL AND MAJOR DOUG EDGINGTON\n112. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, Stobart, \nHerrell and Edgington are all state actors by virtue of their employment with the Franklin County \n21\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 22 of 54  PAGEID #: 2042\nSheriffโs Office.\n113. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, Stobart, \nHerrell and Edgington have created a policy and practice of excessive and abusive use of tasers \nby Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified, as they did in \nPlaintiff Shreveโs case.\nb) As in Plaintiff Shreveโs case, they fail to discipline deputies whose use of tasers \nviolates the Franklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs \nfrom well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses \nsubstantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the persons \ntased; causes needless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional \nrights of persons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \nComplaint, Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Herrell and Edgington have failed \nto properly train corrections deputies to use tasers in accordance with Sheriffโs Office \nwritten policy; to use tasers in accordance with manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on \nsubjects; to use tasers in accordance with accepted law enforcement principles for use of \nforce; and to use tasers in accordance with the federal constitutional rights of persons in \ncustody to be free of excessive force.\n114. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, \nForino, Williamson, Stobart, Herrell and Edgington in their official and individual capacities \nconstitutes deliberate indifference that in turn makes Defendant Franklin County accountable for \n22\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 23 of 54  PAGEID #: 2043\ninjuries to Plaintiff Shreve. Leach v. Shelby County Sheriff, 891 F. 2d 1241, 1245 1246, 1248 \n(6th Cir. 1989).\n115. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, \nWilliamson, Stobart, Herrell and Edgington acted with deliberate indifference by their failure to \ntrain deputies in the proper use of reasonable force and by ratifying the use of excessive and \ngratuitous force against Plaintiff Shreve while acting under color of state law.\n116. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Shreve to be \nsubjected to excessive and unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, from \nwhich he suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n117. Plaintiff Shreve is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants \nbecause they acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to \nprotection against the use of excessive force.\nIX. PLAINTIFF MICHAEL WORLEY - STATEMENT OF FACTS\n118. Plaintiff Worley had open heart surgery to replace his mitral valve in December, \n2008.  He is also recovering from addiction to heroin.  He has not used heroin for at least seven \nmonths.\n119. Plaintiff Worley was arrested by Franklin County Sheriffโs deputies on April 16, \n2010 in Grove City.  He was a passenger in a car pulled over for a traffic stop.\n120. Deputies found that he had an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for petty theft.  \nThey also found marijuana and some Xanax and Suboxone pills that were not prescribed for \nMr. Worley.\n121. Suboxone is approved for the treatment of opioid dependence and Xanax is an \nanti-anxiety drug.  Mr. Worley told deputies he was a recovering heroin addict and took both \npills to keep him from relapsing.\n23\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 24 of 54  PAGEID #: 2044\n122. Deputies arrested him on the misdemeanor warrant and possession of drugs and \ntook him to FCCC I for booking.  Once booked, Mr. Worley was placed in a side cell.\n123. According to Sgt. Christopher Leonardโs use of force report, a deputy heard Mr. \nWorley yell that he wanted to kill himself.\n124. A โresponse teamโ was assembled to go to Mr. Worleyโs cell, place him on a \nsafety watch, and place Mr. Worley in a safety gown.\n125. Five deputies - Sgt. Leonard, Joshua Crosby, Daniel Waldren, Ben Damschroder \nand Nicholas Lapetina - entered Mr. Worleyโs cell.  Deputy Curtis Winn recorded this incident \non a hand-held camera.\n126. The video tape of this incident shows that Sgt. Leonard drew his taser as he \nentered Mr. Worleyโs cell with the other four deputies.\n127. Sgt. Leonard ordered Mr. Worley to stand up and turn around so that Mr. Worley \nhad his back to the deputies and was facing the back wall of his cell.\n128. Sgt. Leonard then ordered Mr. Worley to take off his shirt, sandals and socks. \n129. Mr. Worley complied with these orders but asked โwhy do I gotta get naked?โ\n130. Sgt. Leonard replied, โcause you said you wanted to kill yourself.โ\n131. Mr. Worley denied this, saying โno, I said I feel like Iโm going crazy if I donโt get \nmy anxiety medicine.โ\n132. Sgt. Leonard then ordered Mr. Worley to take off his pants and his underwear.  \nSgt. Leonard then told Mr. Worley โone more order and Iโm going to tase you.โ\n133. Taser International warns that subjects with certain pre-existing conditions such \nas cardiac disease may be at risk of death or serious injury from โarrest-related deathโ if tased.\n134. Mr. Worley turned toward the sergeant and deputies and told them โI got open \n24\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 25 of 54  PAGEID #: 2045\nheart surgery, youโll kill me, my mom will be rich.โ\n135. Sgt. Leonardโs response was โI donโt care.โ\n136. Mr. Worley took off his pants but refused to take off his underwear saying โIโm \nnot sitting in here naked.โ\n137. Sgt. Leonard gave Mr. Worley three rapid commands to take off his shorts, then \nsaid โIโm not gonna tell you again, take off your shorts.โ\n138. The sergeant then immediately tased Mr. Worley in the back. Mr. Worley cried \nout in pain.\n139. Sgt. Leonard ordered Mr. Worley to lay on his belly and put his hands at his sides \nor โIโll pull the trigger again.โ  Sgt. Leonard ordered the other deputies to remove Mr. Worleyโs \nunderwear as he lay face down on the cell floor.\n140. Mr. Worley made choking and coughing noises after being tased and his entire \nbody began shaking uncontrollably.\n141. Sgt. Leonard remarked, โHeโs faking,โ but called for a nurse.  She asked Mr. \nWorley if he could hear her, told him to open his eyes, told him to calm his breathing and told \nhim to wake up.  Mr. Worley continued shaking for several minutes after the nurse arrived.\n142. Once Mr. Worley stopped shaking Sgt. Leonard told him to โstay down on the \nground or Iโll shoot you again.โ  The deputies then placed Mr. Worley in a suicide gown.\n143. There were five deputies in Mr. Worleyโs cell who could have managed any \nresistance or threat presented by Mr. Worley.  Mr. Worley himself did not physically or verbally \nthreaten these deputies.  He was tased simply because he did not want to remove his underwear.\n144. Knowing that Mr. Worley had a heart condition, Sgt. Leonard deployed his taser \nwithout considering measures of lesser force because this was the quickest and most convenient \n25\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 26 of 54  PAGEID #: 2046\nway to get compliance.\n145. Sgt. Leonardโs use of the taser as a form of pain compliance in this instance was \nreviewed and found to be โjustified.โ\nX. MICHAEL WORLEY INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS\nTO DEFENDANTS LEONARD, WINN, CROSBY, DAMSCHRODER, WALDREN AND \nLAPETINA\n146. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Leonard, Winn, Crosby, \nDamschroder, Waldren and Lapetina were state actors by virtue of their employment with the \nFranklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n147. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n148. As an arrestee, Plaintiff Worley was protected by the Fourth Amendmentโs \nprotection against use of excessive force by law enforcement.\n149. Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officers may only use reasonable \nforce, that is, the amount of force that is reasonable to protect officers from a perceived threat.\n150. The use of the taser against Plaintiff Worley by Defendants Leonard, Winn, \nCrosby, Damschroder, Waldren and Lapetina was a willful, callous and gratuitous act that \nviolated Plaintiff Worleyโs Fourth Amendment right to be free from the use of excessive force.\n151. The fact that Defendants Winn, Crosby, Damschroder, Waldren and Lapetina \nwere not the officers who tased Mr. Worley does not diminish their culpability.  These deputies \nwere present, were active participants in this incident, were aware that Sgt. Leonard was \nthreatening to tase Mr. Worley, and had the opportunity to stop it from occurring.\n152. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive use of force by Defendants \nLeonard, Winn, Crosby, Damschroder, Waldren and Lapetina, Plaintiff Worley suffered \ncompensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n26\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 27 of 54  PAGEID #: 2047\n153. Plaintiff Worley is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants Leonard, \nWinn, Crosby, Damschroder, Waldren and Lapetina acted with reckless or callous indifference \nto Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to protection against the use of excessive force.\nXI. MICHAEL WORLEY INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS\nTO DEFENDANTS FRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF JIM KARNES, CHIEF DEPUTY \nMARK BARRETT, CHIEF DEPUTY STEVE MARTIN, INTERNAL AFFAIRS \nDEPUTIES FORINO, KLUMPP, STOBART AND WILLIAMSON, MAJOR MICHAEL \nHERRELL AND MAJOR DOUG EDGINGTON\n154. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, and \nHerrell are all state actors by virtue of their employment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs \nOffice.\n155. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, and \nHerrell have created a policy and practice of excessive and abusive use of tasers by Franklin \nCounty Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified,โ as they did in \nPlaintiff Worleyโs case.\nb)  As in Plaintiff Worleyโs case, they fail to discipline deputies whose use of \ntasers violates the Franklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; \ndeparts from well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; \nposes substantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the \npersons tased; causes needless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the \nConstitutional rights of persons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \nComplaint, Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, and Herrell have failed to properly \ntrain corrections deputies to use tasers in accordance with Sheriffโs Office written policy; \n27\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 28 of 54  PAGEID #: 2048\nto use tasers in accordance with manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use \ntasers in accordance with accepted law enforcement principles for use of force; and to use \ntasers in accordance with the federal constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free \nof excessive force.\n156. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, \nForino, Williamson, and Herrell in their official and individual capacities constitutes deliberate \nindifference that in turn makes Defendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to Plaintiff \nWorley. Leach v. Shelby County Sheriff, 891 F. 2d 1241, 1245 - 1246, 1248 (6th Cir. 1989)\n157. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, \nWilliamson, and Herrell acted with deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies in the \nproper use of reasonable force and by ratifying the use of excessive and gratuitous force against \nPlaintiff Worley while acting under color of state law.\n158. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Worley to \nbe subjected to excessive and unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, from \nwhich he suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n159. Plaintiff Worley is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants \nbecause they acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to \nprotection against the use of excessive force.\nXII. PLAINTIFF MICHAEL REED - STATEMENT OF FACTS\n160. In the early 1990โs, Plaintiff Reed had a motorcycle accident that left him in a \ncoma and caused a traumatic brain injury.  Since this accident he has experienced seizure \nepisodes.\n161. Mr. Reed has been diagnosed with both tonic clonic seizures (stiffening and \nrigidity of muscles followed by rhythmic jerking motions) and complex partial seizures (the \n28\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 29 of 54  PAGEID #: 2049\nperson appears to be staring blankly and loses contact with his surroundings, often followed by \nchewing movements, mumbling and unorganized movements).\n162. Like many persons who have seizures, he usually does not remember having the \nseizure and becomes confused, disoriented, fatigued and sometimes combative after a seizure.\n163. On August 10, 2008 Mr. Reed was walking near the corner of Hamilton Road and \nBroad Street in Columbus, Ohio when he had a seizure.\n164. Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) from the Columbus Fire Department \nresponded.  According to their reports, Mr. Reed was lying on his stomach when they arrived, \nrambling and not making sense.  When they tried to take him to the hospital, they said he became \nโaggressive and assaultive.โ\n165. Instead of the hospital, Mr. Reed ended up in jail on a charge of assaulting a peace \nofficer, one of the EMTs.\n166. Mr. Reed had no memory of the incident.  He woke up in jail, wearing a suicide \ngown.  When told he was in jail for assault, he asked who he assaulted.\n167. Mr. Reed was incarcerated in the Franklin County Corrections Center II awaiting \ntrial on the assault charge.\n168. On December 23, 2008, Judge Michael Holbrook of the Franklin County \nCommon Pleas Court found Mr. Reed not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) on the assault \ncharge.\n169. The NGRI finding was based on an evaluation by forensic psychologist Pamela \nChapman which concluded that, because of his brain injury and seizure disorder, he was neither \nable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct at the time of the offense nor able to control \nhis disorganized thinking and behavior.\n29\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 30 of 54  PAGEID #: 2050\n170. Judge Holbrook ordered Mr. Reed to be committed to the Twin Valley Behavioral \nHealthcare Forensic Unit.\n171. However, Twin Valley did not have an open bed.  Thus, Mr. Reed had to stay in \nthe Franklin County Corrections Center II until a bed became available at Twin Valley.\n172. On January 29, 2009 Mr. Reed had a seizure in his cell at FCCC II.\n173. A team of deputies - Cpl. Sam Byrd, Deputy Sam Montrose, Deputy James \nJodrey, Deputy Clayton Kern and Deputy Chris Starner -  entered his cell at about 4:00 pm to\nโtake him to medicalโ to receive medical attention.\n174. These deputies were aware that Mr. Reed had just had a seizure.\n175. Mr. Reed was on the floor of his cell when the deputies entered.  Upon entering, \nthey gave rapid commands to Mr. Reed to put his hands behind his back so they could put \nhandcuffs on him and take him to medical.\n176. The deputiesโ use of force reports indicate that Mr. Reed became โcombativeโ \nwhen they tried to handcuff him.  The video of this incident, however, does not support their \ndescription of Mr. Reed.\n177. The video shows Mr. Reed as being dazed, confused and unable to process the \ndeputiesโ commands in the aftermath of his seizure.\n178. Mr. Reed did not put his hands behind his back as commanded, but he did not \nactively resist the deputies.  He put his hands up in a defensive posture.  His hands were shaking.\n179. When two deputies grabbed Mr. Reedโs left arm to put it behind his back for \ncuffing, Mr. Reed rolled over on his stomach and said, โoh, oh.โ\n180. Cpl. Byrd pointed the taser at Mr. Reedโs chest.  Byrd told Mr. Reed he would be \ntased if he didnโt put his left hand behind his back and warned โItโs gonna hurt a lot.โ  โItโs \n30\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 31 of 54  PAGEID #: 2051\ngonna fucking hurt bad.โ\n181. The video shows that Mr. Reed was still confused and not comprehending what \nthe deputies wanted him to do.\n182. The deputies again grabbed Mr. Reed to place his hands behind his back.  When \nhe attempted to roll away from them, Cpl. Byrd tased him.  Mr. Reed cried out in pain and put \nhis hands up in a defensive posture saying, โPlease, please, please.โ\n183. Cpl. Byrd again tased Mr. Reed, this time in drive stun mode, because he was not \nputting his hands behind his back.  At one point, a deputy said โReed, hey, wake up,โ indicating \nthat Mr. Reed still was not fully aware.\n184. After being tased a second time, Mr. Reed submitted.  He was cuffed behind the \nback, leg ironed and pulled to his feet.  The video shows that as the deputies took him out of his \ncell, Mr. Reed asked several times โWhat did I do?โ\n185. Mr. Reed suffered a cut on his head from this incident.  It is unclear from the\ndeputiesโ reports whether the cut was the result of falling during the seizure or the deputiesโ \nefforts to cuff him.\n186. After a seizure, a person is often fatigued, dazed and not fully aware of his \nsurroundings and can become belligerent, frightened and unable to communicate.\n187. Mr. Reed appeared dazed, tired and not fully aware of his surroundings on the \nvideo of his post-seizure period when deputies Byrd, Montrose, Jodrey, Kern and Starner entered \nhis cell.\n188. These deputies were supposed to be there to help him get appropriate medical \ncare.  Instead, they grabbed him, restrained him, frightened him and tased him twice for failing to \nobey their misguided commands.  Yet this use of force was reviewed and determined to be \n31\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 32 of 54  PAGEID #: 2052\nโjustified.โ\n189. That same evening, after Mr. Reed was removed from his cell and taken to \nmedical, Deputies Christopher Dishong and Matthew Carter took him to the Mount Carmel \nHospital West Emergency Room for further examination and to fix the cut on his head.\n190. Deputy Dishong tased Mr. Reed again in the ER, while he was โleg ironedโ to a \nhospital stretcher.4  According to Deputy Carterโs report, he was using the bathroom at this time \nand was not present when Deputy Dishong tased Mr. Reed.\n191. The โAttending Noteโ from the hospital records states that Mr. Reed began \nstanding up on the stretcher โtalking loudly and not making senseโ and that he was โshackled to \nthe bed by the ankle at the timeโ the deputy tased him.  When tased, Mr. Reed fell off the bed, \nstriking his head. \n192. Mr. Reed suffered another head laceration from the fall, requiring stitches.\n193. According to Deputy Dishongโs report, Mr. Reed stood up on the hospital bed and \nโbegan to mutter to himself.โ  When Mr. Reed did not lie down on the bed, the deputy tased him, \ncausing Mr. Reed to โstiffenโ and fall off the bed, striking his head on the wall and floor and \nsustaining the second head laceration.  \n194. According to Taser Internationalโs warnings for the X26 taser, the probes cause \nโneuromuscular interruptionโ which renders the subject unable to move and may cause him to \nfall.\n195. Taser International therefore warns that subjects are especially at risk of further \ninjury if they could fall and suffer an impact injury to the head when tased; are on an elevated or \nunstable surface when tased; or are in restraints that incapacitate or immobilize them when tased.  \n                                               \n4 There is no video of the events at the hospital.\n32\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 33 of 54  PAGEID #: 2053\nAll of these risk factors were present at the time Deputy Dishong tased Mr. Reed in the hospital \nER.\n196. The Franklin County Sheriffโs Office policy for the X 26 taser also states that \ntasers should not be deployed upon persons who are restrained by a mechanical device such as \nhandcuffs, leg irons or a restraint chair.\n197. Tasing Mr. Reed again at the ER, in a situation where he was leg ironed to a \nhospital bed and thus had very little ability to move about, was unnecessary, gratuitous, a \nviolation of Sheriffโs Office policy, and subjected him to exactly the kind of further injury that \nTaser International warned of.  Despite this, the Deputyโs use of the taser was reviewed and \ndeemed a โjustifiedโ use of force.\nXIII. MICHAEL REED INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO \nDEFENDANTS BYRD, MONTROSE, JODREY, KERN, STARNER,  AND DISHONG \n198. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Byrd, Montrose, Jodrey, Kern, \nStarner, and Dishong were state actors by virtue of their employment with the Franklin County \nSheriffโs Office.\n199. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n200. At the time of this incident Mr. Reed had already been committed to a psychiatric \nhospital pursuant to the NGRI adjudication.  He should not even have been in the jail at the time \nhe was tased.\n201. Therefore, Mr. Reed was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n202. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiff Reed had the substantive due process \nright to be free from undue bodily harm at the hands of state actors.\n203. Although Mr. Reed was not convicted of a crime and thus not subject to \n33\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 34 of 54  PAGEID #: 2054\npunishment, but rather was adjudicated NGRI, that is, determined to have been not criminally \nresponsible for the crime charged, Plaintiff Reed pleads in the alternative a violation of his rights \nunder the Eighth Amendment.\n204. The Eighth Amendment sets parameters on punishment of prisoners who are \nserving a sentence pursuant to conviction of a crime.  It prevents state actors from unnecessarily \nand wantonly inflicting pain upon prisoners.\n205. Whether analyzed under Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment standards, however, \nthe use of the taser against Plaintiff Reed multiple times in his cell by Defendants Byrd, \nMontrose, Jodrey, Kern, Starner, and by Deputy Dishong at the hospital emergency room was \nunduly and unnecessarily harmful, as well as a wanton infliction of pain that violated his \nConstitutional right to be free from the use of excessive force.\n206. The fact that Defendants Montrose, Jodrey, Kern, and Starner were not the \nofficers who tased Mr. Reed during the incident in his cell does not diminish their culpability.  \nThese deputies were present, were active participants in this incident, heard Deputy Byrd \nthreaten to tase Mr. Reed if he did not cooperate and therefore, had the opportunity to stop this \nuse of excessive force from occurring.\n207. As a direct and proximate result of the excessive use of force by Defendants Byrd, \nMontrose, Jodrey, Kern, Starner, and Dishong, Plaintiff Reed suffered compensable physical \npain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n208. Plaintiff Reed is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants Byrd, \nMontrose, Jodrey, Kern, Starner, and Dishong acted with reckless and wanton indifference to \nPlaintiffโs Eighth or Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free of excessive force.\n34\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 35 of 54  PAGEID #: 2055\nXIV.

Leach v. Shelby County Sheriff, 891 F. 2d 1241, 1245 - 1246, 1248 \n(6th Cir. 1989).\n212. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, \nStobart, and Herrell acted with deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies in the \nproper use of reasonable force and by ratifying the use of excessive and gratuitous force against \nPlaintiff Reed while acting under color of state law.\n213. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Reed to be \nsubjected to excessive and unreasonable force in violation of either the Eighth or Fourteenth \nAmendments, from which he suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as \nemotional distress.\n214. Plaintiff Reed is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants \nbecause they acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourteenth Amendment, or \nin the alternative, Eighth Amendment, right to protection against the use of excessive force.\nXV. PLAINTIFF DAWN FIORE-BRUNO -STATEMENT OF FACTS\n215. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno has a history of treatment for mental illness as well as a \nreported history of both physical and sexual abuse.\n216. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno was arrested for disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, on \nDecember 10, 2009.  She was brought to FCCC II for booking very early in the morning on that \ndate, around 1:30 am.\n217. The video of the booking area shows that before Ms. Fiore-Bruno was brought in, \ntwo male deputies can be overheard saying โI love belly shirtsโ and โtheyโre hot.โ\n36\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 37 of 54  PAGEID #: 2057\n218. When Ms. Fiore-Bruno arrived she was talking in a loud voice and cursing, but \nnot physically threatening or violent in any way.\n219. Two female deputies, Shannon Beaudry and Elizabeth Klein, sat Ms. Fiore-Bruno \ndown on a bench and removed her shoes and socks.  Ms. Fiore-Bruno did not resist.\n220. Deputies Beaudry and Klein then took Ms. Fiore-Bruno to a line drawn on the \nfloor in front of the booking counter, where she stood without resisting.\n221. As she was being escorted to the booking counter Ms. Fiore-Bruno asked if she \nwas being taped and said โI want to be on fucking tape.โ\n222. Deputies Beaudry and Klein removed Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs belt and searched her \npockets.  Again, she did not resist.\n223. Defendant Liz Mehl, the nurse behind the booking counter, asked Ms. Fiore-\nBruno if she had any medical problems.  Ms. Fiore-Bruno replied โyes.โ\n224. Nurse Mehl asked Ms. Fiore-Bruno, โWhat are they?โ Ms. Fiore-Bruno \nresponded โBPD.โ5  Nurse Mehl asked Ms. Fiore-Bruno if she was going to answer and Ms. \nFiore-Bruno responded in a loud voice โwhatโd you say to me?โ  Nurse Mehl replied, โIโm not \ngonna keep repeating myself.โ Ms. Fiore-Bruno then yelled โI said BPD.โ  She also called the \nnurse a โbitch.โ  Nurse Mehlโs response was, โOk, Iโm done. Iโm not gonna be talked to like \nthat.โ\n225. Female deputies Beaudry and Klein, accompanied by male deputies Derek \nShively, Jason Brobst, Steven Dean and Keith Miller, took Ms. Fiore-Bruno to a holding cell. \nThe deputies did not inform Ms. Fiore-Bruno that she was expected to change out of her clothes. \nThe deputies did not afford Ms. Fiore-Bruno the opportunity to voluntarily change in private.  \n                                               \n5 Ms. Fiore-Bruno has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and a mood \ndisorder.\n37\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 38 of 54  PAGEID #: 2058\nThe deputies also did not tell Ms. Fiore-Bruno that what they intended to do was to forcibly strip \nher naked.\n226. The deputies placed Ms. Fiore-Bruno face down on the cell floor and began \nforcibly stripping off her clothes.  Cpl. Lee Vandette was also present in the cell and observing \nthe take-down and stripping of Ms. Fiore-Bruno.\n227. As she was being stripped, Ms. Fiore-Bruno constantly yelled for a camera to \nrecord the event and accused the deputies of being abusive.  Deputy Jason Brobst, who was at \nMs. Fiore-Brunoโs right arm, began yelling at her to stop pulling her arm away โand do what \nyouโre told.โ\n228. Deputy Steven Dean drew his taser and pointed the laser light at Ms. Fiore-Bruno.  \nThe two female deputies continued to pull off Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs clothes with male deputies \npresent in the cell as she was being stripped.\n229. Ms. Fiore Bruno said, โThereโs no reason to make me naked.โ  At that point, \ndeputies began to roll her over face up while she was topless and Ms. Fiore-Bruno continued \nyelling, โI want a camera.โ  Deputy Brobst told her to โRoll over and do what youโre toldโ and \nโYouโre gonna start doing what youโre told.โ\n230. As the female deputies began to remove Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs jeans and underwear, \nshe tried to roll over on her stomach.  Deputy Dean then placed his taser on her left buttock and \ndrive stunned her. \n231. Four male deputies and two female deputies were present as her jeans and \nunderwear were being removed.  Ms. Fiore-Bruno said, crying, โThere should not be a male in \nhere.โ \n232. Deputy Brobst told her โthis was all because you refused to do what you were told \n38\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 39 of 54  PAGEID #: 2059\nto do.โ  Ms. Fiore-Bruno asked โwhat if I was your sister?โ\n233. After being stripped completely naked, Ms. Fiore-Bruno was left lying, face \ndown, on the cell floor.  A male deputy warned her she would be tased again if she moved before \ndeputies exited the cell.  The only clothing they left for her was a safety gown, despite the fact \nthat there was no objective indication that Ms. Fiore-Bruno intended to harm herself in any way.  \n234. It was unnecessary to escalate Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs booking by subjecting her to \nthis degrading process, during which she was tased for her ineffectual resistance to being \nforcibly stripped by multiple deputies. \n235. Ms. Bruno has a history of physical and sexual abuse and mental illness.6  The \nprocess of being forcibly stripped and tased in the presence of male deputies during booking for \na misdemeanor arrest was particularly traumatizing and humiliating for Ms. Fiore-Bruno given \nher history.\n236. Tasing Ms. Fiore-Bruno was determined to be a โjustifiedโ use of force.\nXVI. DAWN FIORE-BRUNO INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION FOR EXCESSIVE \nFORCE - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO DEFENDANTS BEAUDRY, KLEIN, SHIVELY, \nBROBST, DEAN, MILLER AND VANDETTE\n237. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, \nBrobst, Dean, Miller and Vandette were state actors by virtue of their employment with the \nFranklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n238. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n239. As an arrestee, Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno was protected by the Fourth Amendmentโs \n                                               \n6 This is not uncommon, as studies show that eighty percent of women in prisons and \njails have been victims of sexual and physical abuse.  Smith, B., โAn end to silence: Woman \nprisonersโ handbook on identifying and addressing sexual misconduct,โ National Womenโs Law \nCenter (April 1998).\n39\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 40 of 54  PAGEID #: 2060\nprotection against use of excessive force by law enforcement.\n240. Under the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement officers may only use reasonable \nforce, that is, the amount of force that is reasonable to protect officers from a perceived threat.\n241. The use of the taser against Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno by Defendants Beaudry, Klein, \nShively, Brobst, Dean, Miller and Vandette was a willful, callous and gratuitous act that violated \nPlaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs Fourth Amendment right to be free from the use of excessive force.\n242. The fact that Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Miller and Vandette \nwere not the officers who tased Ms. Fiore-Bruno does not diminish their culpability.  These \ndeputies were present, were participants in the forced removal of Ms. Fiore-Brunoโs clothing, \nwere aware that Deputy Dean was going to tase Ms. Fiore-Bruno as they were holding her, and \nhad the opportunity to stop it from occurring.  As a direct and proximate result of the excessive \nuse of force by Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller and Vandette, Plaintiff \nFiore-Bruno suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n243. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants \nBeaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller and Vandette acted with reckless indifference to \nPlaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to protection against the use of excessive force.\nXVII.

At all times relevant to this Complaint, Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, \nBrobst, Dean, Miller, Vandette and Mehl were state actors by virtue of their employment with \nthe Franklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n245. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 provides that no person, acting under color of state law, shall \ndeprive a citizen of his rights arising under the Constitution or federal laws.\n40\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 41 of 54  PAGEID #: 2061\n246. As an arrestee, Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno had a right to privacy protected by the \nFourth Amendment.\n247. Defendants Beaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller, Vandette and Mehl \nviolated Plaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs Fourth Amendment right to privacy because they lacked \njustification to forcibly strip a woman charged only with a misdemeanor offense; failed to afford \nPlaintiff Fiore-Bruno any opportunity to change in private; forcibly stripped her with the \npresence and participation of at least five male deputies, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller and \nVandette; and lacked justification to place her in a safety gown. \n248. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as \nemotional distress as the direct and proximate result of these actions by Defendants Beaudry, \nKlein, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller, Vandette and Mehl.\n249. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno is also entitled to punitive damages because Defendants \nBeaudry, Klein, Shively, Brobst, Dean, Miller, Vandette and Mehl acted with reckless or callous \nindifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to privacy.\nXVIII.DAWN FIORE-BRUNO INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION FOR EXCESSIVE \nFORCE - 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO DEFENDANTS FRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF JIM \nKARNES, CHIEF DEPUTY MARK BARRETT, CHIEF DEPUTY STEVE MARTIN, \nINTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPUTIES FORINO, KLUMPP, STOBART AND \nWILLIAMSON, MAJOR MICHAEL HERRELL AND MAJOR DOUG EDGINGTON\n250. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, and  \nStobart are all state actors by virtue of their employment with the Franklin County Sheriffโs \nOffice.\n251. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, and \nStobart have created a policy and practice of excessive and abusive use of tasers by Franklin \nCounty Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \n41\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 42 of 54  PAGEID #: 2062\nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified,โ as they did in \nPlaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs case.\nb)  As in Plaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs case, they fail to discipline deputies whose use of \ntasers violates the Franklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; \ndeparts from well-established standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; \nposes substantial and unjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the \npersons tased; causes needless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the \nConstitutional rights of persons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\nc) As evidenced by the deputiesโ repeated misuse of tasers as set forth in this \nComplaint, Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, and Stobart have failed to properly \ntrain corrections deputies to use tasers in accordance with Sheriffโs Office written policy; \nto use tasers in accordance with manufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use \ntasers in accordance with accepted law enforcement principles for use of force; and to use \ntasers in accordance with the federal constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free \nof excessive force.\n252. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, \nForino, Williamson, and Stobart in their official and individual capacities constitutes deliberate \nindifference that in turn makes Defendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to Plaintiff \nFiore-Bruno. Leach v. Shelby County Sheriff, 891 F. 2d 1241, 1245 - 1246, 1248 (6th Cir. 1989)\n253. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, \nWilliamson, and Stobart acted with deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies in the \nproper use of reasonable force and by ratifying the use of excessive and gratuitous force against \nPlaintiff Fiore-Bruno while acting under color of state law.\n42\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 43 of 54  PAGEID #: 2063\n254. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno \nto be subjected to excessive and unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, from \nwhich she suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n255. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants \nbecause they acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to \nprotection against the use of excessive force.\nXIX. DAWN FIORE-BRUNO INDIVIDUAL CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION \nOF RIGHT TO PRIVACY, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO DEFENDANTS FRANKLIN \nCOUNTY, SHERIFF KARNES, CHIEF DEPUTIES BARRETT AND MARTIN, \nINTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPUTY WILLIAMSON AND MAJOR HERRELL\n256. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies Barrett and Martin, Deputy \nWilliamson, and Major Herrell are all state actors by virtue of their employment with the \nFranklin County Sheriffโs Office.\n257. Chief Deputy Barrett, and then facility commander of FCCC II, Major Herrell, \nwere the line commanders who reviewed the deputies use of force reports detailing the forced \nstripping of Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno on December 10, 2009.  \n258. Forcible stripping of detainees is a use of force that requires a use of force report \nand review by the Internal Affairs Bureau. Internal affairs deputy Charles Williamson reviewed \nthe deputiesโ use of force in Plaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs case and found it to be โjustified.โ  \n259. Chief Deputy Martin is the head of the Internal Affairs Bureau and is the \nindividual designated by Sheriff Karnes to review all use of force reports and recommendations \nfrom deputies of the Internal Affairs Bureau.  Like deputy Williamson, Chief Martin found the \ndeputiesโ use of force in Plaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs case to be โjustified.โ  \n260. Defendants Barrett, Herrell, Williamson, Martin and Karnes ratified the violation \nof Plaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs Constitutional right to privacy by finding that the deputiesโ forcible \n43\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 44 of 54  PAGEID #: 2064\nstripping of Ms. Fiore-Bruno was a justified use of force and by failing to discipline the deputies \nfor actions that violated her Constitutional right to privacy.  \n261. The ratification of the deputiesโ unconstitutional violation of Plaintiffโs right to \nprivacy and failure to discipline the deputies by Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Chief Deputies \nBarrett and Martin, Deputy Williamson, and Major Herrell in their official and individual \ncapacities in turn makes Defendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to Plaintiff Fiore-\nBruno. \n262. Defendants Barrett, Herrell, and Karnes also were responsible for the training and \nimplementation of the policy on placement of detainees in safety gowns at the Franklin County \nCorrections Center and in this instance, FCCC II.  \n263. Defendants Barrett, Herrell, and Karnes failed to adequately train corrections \nemployees on the policy for placement of detainees in safety gowns and the constitutional \nstandards respecting detaineesโ right of privacy. \n264. The failure of training by Defendants Barrett, Herrell, and Karnes in their \nindividual and official capacities constitutes deliberate indifference to the constitutional privacy \nrights of detainees which in turn makes Defendant Franklin County accountable for injuries to \nPlaintiff Fiore-Bruno. \n265. Defendants Franklin County, Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Williamson, and Herrell \nacted with deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies on the constitutional standards \nrespecting detainees right of privacy and by ratifying the violation of Plaintiff Fiore-Brunoโs \nconstitutional right of privacy while acting under color of state law.\n44\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 45 of 54  PAGEID #: 2065\n266. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants caused Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno \nto be subjected to the deprivation of her right to privacy in violation of the Fourth Amendment, \nfrom which she suffered compensable physical pain and injuries as well as emotional distress.\n267. Plaintiff Fiore-Bruno is also entitled to punitive damages against these Defendants \nbecause they acted with reckless or callous indifference to Plaintiffโs Fourth Amendment right to \nprivacy.\nXX. JURY DEMAND\n268. Plaintiffs Shreve, Worley, Reed and Fiore-Bruno demand a trial by jury of all \nissues triable by a jury.\nXXI. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS AS AGAINST FRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF\nKARNES, DEPUTY CHIEFS BARRETT AND MARTIN, JANE/JOHN DOES, \nJANE/JOHN ROES, AND MAJORS HERRELL AND EDGINGTON\n269. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley bring this action on behalf of themselves and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated solely for declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n270. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley represent a class of person defined as follows:\na) All persons who, now or at any future time during the pendency of this \nlitigation, are or will be placed in the custody of the Franklin County Sheriffโs Department \nat the Franklin County Corrections Centers. \n271. The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  \na) Joinder is impracticable here because the class consists of thousands of current \nand future inmates.  Defendant Sheriff Karnes controls the information about the exact \nnumber of inmates at the FCCCs, so Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley cannot establish the \nprecise number of class members.  However, the 2007 Annual Report of the Franklin \nCounty Sheriffโs Office states that the average daily population of the FCCCs is over 1,850 \n45\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 46 of 54  PAGEID #: 2066\ninmates.  \nb) Because this class action is seeking prospective injunctive relief, the presence of \nfuture or unknown members of a proposed class also makes joinder impracticable. \n272. There are also questions of law and fact presented in this Complaint that are \ncommon to the members of the proposed class. These questions include:\na) Do FCCC deputies routinely use tasers on in violation of the constitutional \nrights of individuals in their custody?\nb) Have the Defendants failed to adequately train and supervise their deputies on \nthe proper use of tasers?\nc) Do the Defendants routinely ratify the unconstitutional use of tasers by failing to \ndiscipline deputies for improper taser use?\nd) Do the Defendants routinely fail to follow their written policy on the use of \ntasers?\n273. The claims of Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley are typical of the claims of the \nmembers of the proposed class.\na) Plaintiffs Shreve and Worleyโs claims are typical of the claims of the putative \nclass because they, along with all proposed class members, are at risk of having their \nconstitutional rights violated through FCCC deputiesโ use of tasers.  \nb) Due to FCCC deputiesโ widespread, arbitrary, and excessive use of tasers \nagainst persons in custody at the Franklin County Corrections Centers, all of the putative \nclass members are similarly at risk of the violation of their constitutional rights and seek \nthe same relief to require the Defendants to discontinue their unconstitutional use of tasers.  \nc) Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the proposed class members would all be \n46\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 47 of 54  PAGEID #: 2067\nproceeding under the same legal theory - that the FCCC deputiesโ use of tasers violates the \nPlaintiffsโ constitutional rights.  \n274. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the \nproposed class, thereby making injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate to the class as a \nwhole.\na) Class certification is appropriate here, where all class members are at risk of the \nviolation of their constitutional rights, but their temporary status as arrestees and inmates \nwill frustrate any attempt to achieve systemic declaratory or injunctive relief.\nb) Rule 23(b)(2) was formulated to allow for class actions where parties, as here, \nseek broad injunctive relief to vindicate the civil rights of a large class of individuals.\n275. The named Plaintiffs, Shreve and Worley, will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley have no interest that is now or may be \npotentially antagonistic to the interests of the proposed class.  \n276. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley are represented by experienced attorneys employed \nby Ohio Legal Rights Service (OLRS).   OLRS lawyers have extensive experience in litigating \nfederal court class action cases involving federal rights and federal civil rights claims. \na) OLRS lawyers have represented clients in many complex litigation matters over \nseveral decades, including serving as class counsel.  For example, OLRS lawyers have \nserved as class counsel for approximately 20 years in Doe v. State of Ohio, Docket No. \n2:91-cv-464 (S.D. Ohio), concerning the stateโs implementation of its duties under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act and its funding for special education services.  \nIn Rone v. Fireman, Docket No. C75-355A (N.D. Ohio), OLRS successfully represented a \nclass of patients at a state psychiatric hospital against various state agency Defendants to \n47\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 48 of 54  PAGEID #: 2068\nimprove conditions at Western Reserve Psychiatric Habilitation Center.  Similarly, in \nCoe v. Hyde, Docket No. C2-87-719 (S.D. Ohio), OLRS lawyers represented a class of \npatients at Central Ohio Psychiatric Hospital and succeeded in its challenges to the \nconditions at that facility.  In Cleveland v. Ohio Department of Mental Health, Docket No. \n89-cv-3658 (Franklin Cty. Common Pleas), OLRS lawyers served as class counsel to \nchallenge the stateโs procedures for involuntary medicating individuals with mental illness, \nand succeeding in obtaining a permanent injunction for the Plaintiff class.  Many of these \ncases involved the vindication of individualsโ constitutional rights through ยง 1983 \nlitigation, and OLRSโ lawyers extensive involvement in these and other similar cases \ndemonstrates that OLRS lawyers are qualified to represent the Plaintiff class.\nb) OLRS has sufficient resources to adequately represent the class.  OLRS is an \nindependent state agency created in 1975 by state law to protect and advocate the rights of \npeople with disabilities, and is Ohioโs federally designated Protection and Advocacy \nsystem. OLRS Program staff includes ombudspersons, disability rights advocates, and \nattorneys who advocate for individual and systemic change through individual, group and \nclass action cases, monitoring policies and legislative activity, and providing education and \ntraining.  OLRS is committed both in time and resources to this litigation to ensure that the \ncurrent abuses of people with disabilities and other people at the Franklin County \nCorrections Centers are brought to an end.\nXXII. CLASS ACTION CLAIM OF ROBERT SHREVE AND MICHAEL WORLEY ON \nBEHALF OF A PROPOSED CLASS UNDER 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 AS TO DEFENDANTS \nFRANKLIN COUNTY, SHERIFF KARNES, BARRETT, MARTIN, KLUMPP, FORINO, \nSTOBART, WILLIAMSON, HERRELL AND EDGINGTON IN THEIR OFFICIAL\nCAPACITIES\n277. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, Stobart, \nHerrell, and Edgington are all state actors by virtue of their employment with the Franklin \n48\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 49 of 54  PAGEID #: 2069\nCounty Sheriffโs Office.\n278. Corrections deputies at the Franklin County Corrections Centers have subjected \nPlaintiffs Shreve and Worley, and will continue to subject members of the proposed class, to the \nabusive and excessive use of tasers in a manner that constitutes excessive, unreasonable and \ndisproportionate force; recklessly and wantonly inflicts mental pain, emotional distress and \ntrauma; is malicious and sadistic; inflicts corporal punishment for minor violations; violates the \nFranklin County Sheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs from well-\nestablished standards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses substantial and \nunjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of arrestees and inmates; and \nviolates the Constitutional rights of those persons in the custody of the Franklin County \nCorrections Centers, in violation of their rights under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth \nAmendments as enforced through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.\n279. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Williamson, Stobart, \nHerrell and Edgington have created a policy and practice of excessive and abusive use of tasers \nby Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections officers because:\na) They routinely ratify corrections deputiesโ misuse of tasers by reviewing the use \nof force reports and videotapes and finding the use of tasers to be โjustified.โ\nb)  They fail to discipline deputies whose use of tasers violates the Franklin County \nSheriffโs own written policy for deployment of tasers; departs from well-established \nstandards of law enforcement and corrections professionals; poses substantial and \nunjustifiable risks to the health, safety and physical integrity of the persons tased; causes \nneedless physical harm and mental distress; and violates the Constitutional rights of \npersons in the custody of the Franklin County Corrections Centers.\n49\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 50 of 54  PAGEID #: 2070\nc) They have failed to properly train corrections deputies to use tasers in \naccordance with Sheriffโs Office written policy; to use tasers in accordance with \nmanufacturerโs warnings for safe use on subjects; to use tasers in accordance with accepted \nlaw enforcement principles for use of force; and to use tasers in accordance with the \nfederal constitutional rights of persons in custody to be free of excessive force.\n280. The policies and practices of Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, \nForino, Williamson, Stobart, Herrell and Edgington in their official capacities in turn make \nDefendant Franklin County accountable for the harm to Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and \nmembers of the proposed class.\n281. Defendants Franklin County, Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, \nWilliamson, Stobart, Herrell and Edgington, under color of state law, have acted and continue to \nact with deliberate indifference by their failure to train deputies in the proper use of reasonable \nforce and by ratifying the use of excessive and gratuitous force against Plaintiffs Shreve and \nWorley and members of the proposed class.  \n282. These actions and failures to act by these Defendants have caused Plaintiffs \nShreve and Worley and will continue to cause members of the proposed class to be subjected to \nexcessive and unreasonable force in violation of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth  \nAmendments.\nXXIII.NEED FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n283. The practices involving misuse of tasers discussed in this Complaint are ongoing \nbecause the culture at the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office fosters them.  \n284. There is no accountability for the misuse of tasers by Franklin County corrections \ndeputies. These practices have repeatedly been found to be โjustifiedโ by the chain of command \nat the Franklin County Sheriffโs Office, including facility commanders, the Internal Affairs \n50\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 51 of 54  PAGEID #: 2071\nBureau and the Chief Deputy of Corrections.  Out of a sample of 180 use of force reports \ninvolving tasers since January 1, 2008, the use of force was found โnot justifiedโ in fewer than a \nhandful of cases.\n285. Defendants Sheriff Karnes, Barrett, Martin, Klumpp, Forino, Stobart, Williamson, \nMajors Herrell and Edgington have repeatedly authorized and ratified the custom, policy and \npractice of misuse of tasers by the corrections deputies whom they supervise and for whom they \nset policy.\n286. These Defendants also have failed to adequately train and supervise corrections \ndeputies to use tasers in a manner that is safe, appropriate, conforms to policy and adheres to \nConstitutional standards for use of force. By their actions, and their failures to act, these \nDefendants have been and remain deliberately indifferent to the risk of violating the \nConstitutional rights of Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the proposed Plaintiff \nclass.\n287. The deliberate indifference of Defendants Sheriff  Karnes, Barrett, Martin, \nKlumpp, Forino, Williamson, Stobart, Herrell and Edgington results in the failure to adequately \ntrain, supervise and discipline corrections deputies in their use of tasers has caused and will \ncontinue to cause violations of the Constitutional rights of Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the \nmembers of the proposed Plaintiff class.\n288. These ongoing practices present the real threat of physical injury and \npsychological trauma to individuals who currently are in custody at the Franklin County \nCorrections Centers or will be in custody of the Franklin County Correction Centers during the \npendency of this litigation.\n289. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley, as well as the members of the proposed class, are \n51\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 52 of 54  PAGEID #: 2072\nentitled to declaratory and injunctive relief.  Defendants have engaged and are continuing to \nengage in the challenged policies and practices that were used against Plaintiffs Shreve and \nWorley.\n290. Defendants have acted and, without immediate injunctive relief, will continue to \nact under color of state law to deprive Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the \nproposed class of their Constitutional rights to be free of excessive force.\n291. Plaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the proposed class have no \nadequate remedy at law.  In the absence of injunctive relief they will continue to suffer the real \nthreat of irreparable harm as a result of the existence of a policy and practice that encourages and \napproves the misuse of tasers by Franklin County Corrections deputies.\nXXIV.PRAYER FOR RELIEF\nTherefore, Plaintiffs request that this Court:\nA. Assume jurisdiction over this matter;\nB. Certify the proposed class as:  All persons who, now or at any future time during the \npendency of this litigation, are or will be placed in the custody of the Franklin County Sheriffโs \nDepartment at the Franklin County Corrections Centers;\nC. Issue a declaratory judgment holding that the Defendants have violated the rights of \nPlaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the proposed class under the United States Constitution as \nenforced through 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983;\nD. Issue such temporary or preliminary relief as requested by Plaintiffs Shreve and \nWorley in the course of these proceedings to prevent irreparable harm from occurring to them \nand the proposed class;\nE. Enjoin the Defendants from continuing to violate the Constitutional rights of \nPlaintiffs Shreve and Worley and the members of the proposed class as set forth in this \n52\n\nCase: 2:10-cv-00644-EAS-MRA Doc #: 104 Filed: 04/29/11 Page: 53 of 54  PAGEID #: 2073\nComplaint;\nF. Enjoin the Defendants from continuing to violate their own policy on use of the X26 \ntaser;\nG. Appoint an expert with extensive experience in corrections who is not associated \nwith any party to this action to monitor, review, and oversee all use of force reports involving \ndeployment of tasers by Franklin County Sheriffโs corrections deputies and to recommend \nappropriate discipline and conduct training of deputies where warranted;\nH. Grant judgment in favor of Plaintiffs Shreve, Worley, Reed and Fiore-Bruno, and \nagainst the Defendants, individually and collectively, for compensatory damages for Plaintiffsโ \ninjuries, pain and suffering and emotional distress in an amount to be proven at trial;\nI.
