    "summary": "<p>On February 21, 2007, Disability Rights Pennsylvania (the Pennsylvania protection and advocacy agency) and private co-counsel filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of registered voters with mobility disabilities to challenge inaccessibility of polling locations throughout the City of Philadelphia. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and assigned to Judge John R. Pavoda. Defendants included officials and entities responsible for elections in the City of Philadelphia and the Secretary of State. The suit alleged claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act. Plaintiffs were particularly focused on accessibility for the 2008 election.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the suit, the Philadelphia Board of Elections filed a motion to dismiss on April 12, 2007, which plaintiffs formally opposed on April 25, 2007. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification on April 30, 2007, seeking certification of a class of all eligible Philadelphia County voters with mobility disabilities.&nbsp;Plaintiffs' sought class was eventually certified on March 14, 2008.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 4, 2007, the case was referred to Magistrate Judge Timothy R. Rice for a settlement conference. Settlement discussions continued unsuccessfully over the next six months, prompting plaintiffs to file a motion for a preliminary injunction on January 11, 2008. Plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring: (1) the Philadelphia Board of Elections to make sure all polling places meet the accessibility requirements set forth in the U.S. Department of Justice <em>ADA Checklist for Polling Places </em>(including provision of ramps); (2) a court-appointed expert to inspect all polling places ahead of the 2008 primary election and make accessibility recommendations; (3) implementation of the recommendations of the court-appointed expert; and (4) further expert reviews after the 2008 election, if necessary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court denied the Board of Elections' motion to dismiss on January 29, 2008 and preparations for trial continued. The Board of Elections then filed a motion for summary judgment on April 18, 2008. On August 14, 2008, the court granted the Board of Elections' motion to dismiss in part. The court found that the Board of Elections was an improper defendants and gave plaintiffs 10 days to file an amended complaint naming the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia as defendants. Plaintiffs promptly filed an amended complaint with the proper defendants on August 19, 2008. Settlement discussions resumed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a settlement agreement on April 20, 2009; the motion was granted three days later. Final approval of the settlement agreement was granted on July 14, 2009. Per the terms of the agreement, the City agreed to work with the Department of Justice and an independent third party to survey all polling locations to assess accessibility, to consult with Disability Rights Pennsylvania when deciding whether to implement recommendations made by the surveyors, to ensure all polling places selected through the November 2012 election will be accessible, and more. Plaintiffs moved for and were awarded attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in the amount of $360,000 on July 20, 2009.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequent litigation due to defendants&rsquo; noncompliance ensued, including a motion for contempt, which was ultimately resolved and dismissed as moot. On December 17, 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt, alleging that the City violated the settlement agreement by failing to make many polling places accessible during the 2010 midterm elections. The motion was eventually dismissed as moot on September 20, 2009, and an addendum to the settlement agreement was added on September 29, 2011. Between 2009 and 2015, the settlement was amended several times as the parties resolved outstanding issues in compliance with the agreement. The case was officially marked closed on October 2, 2015.</p>",

Introduction\n1. Individual Plaintiffs are residents of Philadelphia who have mobility disabilities, who are\nregistered to vote,  and who wish to vote at neighborhood polling places that are accessible\nfor persons with mobility disabilities.\n2. Plaintiffs seek to exercise their right to vote in Philadelphia in the same manner as non-\ndisabled persons and with access to polling places the same as non-disabled persons.  They\nseek to vote at their neighborhood polling places and to exercise their fundamental right to\ncast a secret ballot for the  candidates of their choice -- in the same manner as non-disabled\npersons.\n3. Philadelphia has more than 1,600 polling locations, and more than 400 are not accessible to\npersons with a mobility impairment who cannot readily walk up or down steps.   Due to\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 2 of 10\nphysically inaccessible polling places, Plaintiffs and class members  cannot vote in their\nneighborhood polling places, do not vote, or are humiliated and embarrassed because they\ncannot independently and readily access the polling places, and are denied access to\nneighborhood polling places.\n4. Defendants have failed to select and provide accessible polling places, thus violating\nPlaintiffs’ and class members’ civil rights under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12131-12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (“RA\"), by denying equal and integrated access to the polling\nplaces in Philadelphia.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to require Defendants\nto make all polling place locations accessible to Plaintiffs and other voters with mobility\ndisabilities.\nII.     Jurisdiction\n5. This court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. §\n1343(3).   Plaintiffs' claims are authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 1983,  28 U.S.C. §§  2201 and\n2202,  29 U.S.C. § 794 and 42 U.S.C. § 12132.\n6. Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(1) and (2) since\nDefendants reside in the District and all of the events that give rise to this Complaint\noccurred in this District.\nIII.     The Parties\nA.  Individual Plaintiffs\n7. Plaintiff Kathleen Kerrigan is a Philadelphia resident who is registered to vote.  She has a\nmobility disability and has  used a wheelchair to ambulate since 2003.  She has been on\n-2-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 3 of 10\ndialysis for fifteen years. Defendants have assigned her to a polling place that is inaccessible\nbecause it has steps.  As a result of its inaccessibility,  Plaintiff Kerrigan cannot gain access\nto the polling place or to use the voting machines. \n8. Plaintiff Anthony Holiday is a twenty year old Philadelphia resident who became eligible to\nvote in 2004 and is registered to vote.  He has a mobility disability and uses a wheelchair to\nambulate.  Defendants have assigned him to a polling place that is inaccessible because it has\nsteps.  As a result of its inaccessibility,  Plaintiff Holiday cannot gain access to the polling\nplace or to use the voting machines.\n9. Plaintiff Michael J. McShea is a Philadelphia resident who is registered to vote.  He has a\nmobility disability as a result of having his left leg amputated two years ago and his right leg\namputated one and a half years ago.  Since 2004, he has used a wheelchair. There are two\nother persons in his polling precinct who also use a wheelchair to ambulate.  Defendants\nassigned him to a polling place that it listed as an accessible  garage, but the garage is in fact\nnot used for voting.  Instead voting occurs in a basement which has three steps.  In order to\ngain access, the poll workers have carried Plaintiff McShea down the three steps, which is\ndangerous both to him and the poll workers. As a result of its inaccessibility,  Plaintiff\nMcShea  cannot gain independent access to the polling place or to use the voting machines.\n10.  Plaintiff Tariq Mangum is an eighteen year old Philadelphia resident who became eligible\nto vote in May, 2006 and who is registered to vote.  He became disabled earlier in 2006 as\na result of a car accident.  He has a mobility disability and uses a wheelchair to ambulate.\nDefendants assigned him to polling place that is inaccessible because it has steps. As a result\nof its inaccessibility,  Plaintiff Mangum cannot gain access to the polling place or to use the\n-3-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 4 of 10\nvoting machines.\n11. Plaintiff Renee Crosby is a Philadelphia resident who is registered to vote.  She has a\nmobility disability and started using a wheelchair in 2006.  Before  using a wheelchair to\nambulate, she used crutches, which are much harder and more painful than using the\nwheelchair.  Her assigned polling place is inaccessible because it has steps.  As a result of\nits inaccessibility, in order for her to vote in November, 2006, Plaintiff Crosby had to use her\ncrutches.  Plaintiff Crosby  cannot gain access to the polling place with her wheelchair or to\nuse the voting machines. \n12. Plaintiff Carolyn Davenport is a Philadelphia resident who is registered to vote.  She has a\nmobility disability and recently started using a motorized wheelchair.  Before that, she used\na manual wheelchair and a walker to ambulate.  Her assigned polling place has several steps\nat its main entrance. In the past, she has had to pull herself up the front steps where she then\nused her walker.  The front entrance does not have signage for an alternative entrance.  There\nis a side entrance to the polling place which is accessible but it was locked for the November,\n2006 election.  As a result of its inaccessibility,  Plaintiff Davenport cannot gain equal access\nto the polling place or to use the voting machines.\nB.  Defendants\n13. Defendant Philadelphia Board of Election is the public entity responsible for selecting\npolling places in the City of Philadelphia.\n14. Defendants Margaret M. Tartaglione, Edgar Howard and Joseph Duda, Philadelphia City\nCommissioners, are sued in their official capacities and are responsible for supervising all\nelections in Philadelphia.  These responsibilities include choosing polling places.\n-4-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 5 of 10\nIV.   Class Action Allegations\n15. Individual Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all other persons\nsimilarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nThe class consists of all persons who are residents of Philadelphia County eligible to vote\nwho have mobility impairments that prevent them from gaining independent access to vote\nin inaccessible neighborhood polling places and who after October 22, 2001 either became\neligible to vote or developed a mobility disability.    \n16. The exact size of the class is unknown to the Plaintiffs, but it is believed to be sufficiently\nlarge to make joinder impracticable.  \n17. The questions of  law or fact common to the class include whether Defendants violate the\nADA and RA by requiring class members to be denied access to vote independently in their\nneighborhood polling places that are inaccessible.      \n18. The claims of the named Plaintiffs -- that Defendants violate their rights under the ADA and\nRA by failing to select and use the polling places accessible to persons with mobility\nimpairments-- are typical of all putative class members’ claims. \n19. The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  They have\nno interests which conflict with other class members.  Plaintiffs' counsel are experienced in\nlitigating class actions,  including enforcement of the civil rights of people with disabilities.\n20. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby\nmaking appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nV.    The Facts\n21. Individual Plaintiffs and class members are all individuals with mobility disabilities who\n-5-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 6 of 10\ndesire to vote in person on election day at accessible polling places that permit them to cast\ntheir ballots in the same manner as non-disabled persons.\n22. Defendants Philadelphia Board of Election and Commissioners  have not ensured that voters\nwho have mobility disabilities can vote in accessible polling places to cast their ballots\nsecretly, independently, and in the most integrated setting.\n23. Philadelphia county is 129.7 square miles.  The City is divided into 66 wards, each of which\nare divided into multiple divisions.  Each division is assigned a unique polling place.  There\nare more than 1,600 polling places in the City.  Defendants assign each registered voter in\nthe City to a ward and a division based on where a person lives.  Registered voters are\nrequired to vote in the polling place to which they have been assigned by the Defendants.\nDefendants do not allow voters with mobility disabilities whose assigned polling place is\ninaccessible to vote in an accessible polling place.\n24. As a result of a previous lawsuit, hundreds of neighborhood polling places that had been\ninaccessible to persons with mobility impairments, including those who use wheelchairs,\nwere relocated to accessible locations at no cost to the City, or they were ramped with either\npermanent or temporary ramps with federal funds.  Nevertheless, there are more than 400\npolling locations that remain inaccessible.\n25. Many polling places that have not been relocated could be moved to accessible locations.\n26. A number of polling places - including some identified as accessible– are inaccessible but\ncould with simple modifications be made accessible or moved to an accessible location.\n27. Named Plaintiffs and class members have mobility impairments and many use wheelchairs\nto ambulate due to their disabilities.  In order for Plaintiffs and class members to cast their\n-6-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 7 of 10\nballots in person, their neighborhood polling place must have an accessible path of travel to\nan accessible voting machine.  Their present polling places are inaccessible, and they cannot\nvote where their non-disabled neighbors vote.\n28. Despite knowledge of continued violations of and denial of equal access of the voting rights\nof Plaintiffs and other voters with disabilities since the passage of the ADA and RA, City\nDefendants select and use of polling locations that are inaccessible to persons with\ndisabilities rather than select and use only accessible polling locations.\n29. City Defendants have discriminated, and continue to discriminate, against Plaintiffs and class\nmembers on the basis of their disabilities with respect to voting in Philadelphia County.\n30. Plaintiffs and class members have no remedy at law and require injunctive relief to enjoin\nthe Defendants from violating their civil rights.\nVI.     Claims    \n31. Plaintiffs and class members are substantially impaired in the major life activity of walking,\nand they are qualified individuals with a disability as defined in the ADA and the RA.  42\nU.S.C. §§ 12102(2)(A), 12131 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104 (ADA); 29 U.S.C.§ 705(20)(B) and\n28 C.F.R. § 41.31, 41.32 (RA).\n32. Defendants Margaret M. Tartaglione, Edgar Howard and Joseph Duda are Philadelphia City\nCommissioners. They are sued in their official capacities as officials of a public entity\nsubject to the ADA and as a recipient of federal financial assistance subject to the RA. 42\nU.S.C. § 12131(1) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104 (ADA); 29 U.S.C. § 794(b) (RA).\n33. Defendant Philadelphia Board of Elections is a public entity as defined in 42 U.S.C. §\n12131(1) and 28 CFR § 35.104 and a recipient of federal financial assistance under 29 U.S.C.\n-7-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 8 of 10\n§ 794.\n34. Defendants have subjected Plaintiffs and class members to discrimination based on their\nmobility disabilities by excluding them from participation in and denying them the benefits\nof their services, programs, and activities, i.e.,  access to polling places and the voting\nprocess in a manner that is available to non-disabled people, in violation of the ADA, 42\nU.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n35.  Defendants have denied or failed to afford Plaintiffs and class members on the basis of their\nmobility disabilities the opportunity to participate in and benefit from their services,\nprograms, and activities, i.e., voting in polling places in a manner that is available and\nafforded to non-disabled people, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(b)(1), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n36.  Defendants  have  used  methods  of  administration  that  have  the  effect  of subjecting\nindividuals with mobility disabilities, such as Plaintiffs and class members, to discrimination\non the basis of their disabilities (e.g., allowing certain individuals to effectively veto\ndecisions to move inaccessible polling places to accessible locations) and defeating or\nsubstantially impairing the accomplishment of the program’s objectives to facilitate voting\nin violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3), and RA, 29\nU.S.C. § 794.\n37. Defendants have determined the locations of polling places in a manner that has the effect\nof excluding individuals with mobility disabilities, such as Plaintiffs and class members,\nfrom or denying them the benefits of Defendants’ programs, services or activities, i.e.,\nproviding access to polling places and the voting process, and that have the purpose or effect\n-8-\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 1   Filed 02/21/07   Page 9 of 10\nof defeating or substantially impairing the objectives of those programs, services, or activities\nin violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(4), and the RA, 29\nU.S.C. § 794.\n38. Defendants have failed to make reasonable modifications in their policies, practices, and\nprocedures concerning inaccessible polling places that are necessary to avoid discrimination\nagainst individuals with mobility disabilities, such as Plaintiffs and class members, in\nviolation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), and the RA, 29\nU.S.C. § 794.\n39.  Defendants have failed to administer their services, programs, and activities (i.e., providing\naccess to polling places and the voting process) in the most integrated setting appropriate to\nthe needs of individuals with mobility disabilities, such as Plaintiffs and class members, in\nviolation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), and the RA, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794.\n40.  Defendants have failed to assure that each polling place -- which constitutes a unique service,\nprogram, or activity because voters can only vote in their assigned polling place -- is readily\naccessible to and usable by individuals with mobility disabilities, including Plaintiffs and\nclass members, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.150, and the\nRA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\nVII.

Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court to certify the case to\nproceed on behalf of the following class:\nAll eligible Philadelphia County voters with mobility disabilities\nwho  either  became  eligible  to  vote  or  developed  a  mobility\ndisability after October 22, 2001.\nThe criteria of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) are satisfied in this case,\nmaking class certification appropriate.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 4 of 20\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiffs Kathleen Kerrigan, Anthony Holiday, Michael J. McShea, Tariq Mangum,\nRenee Crosby, and Carolyn Davenport are registered Philadelphia voters who have mobility\ndisabilities that require them to use wheelchairs to ambulate.  Compl. ¶¶ 7-12.1  The Plaintiffs\neither developed their mobility disabilities or became registered to vote after October 22, 2001.\nId.  The Plaintiffs want to vote in their local polling places in the same manner as their non-\ndisabled neighbors.  Id. ¶ 21.  The Plaintiffs, however, all are assigned to polling places that are\nnot accessible to individuals with mobility disabilities who use wheelchairs because there are\nsteps to reach the polling machines.  Id. ¶¶ 7-12.2  As a result, Plaintiffs Kerrigan, Holiday,\nMcShea, and Mangum, and Davenport have been unable to vote in their local polling places with\ntheir neighbors.  Id. ¶¶ 7-10, 12.  Plaintiff Crosby was able to reach the polling machines in her\npolling place only by using her crutches, a much more arduous and painful means of ambulation\nfor her than using her wheelchair.  Id. ¶ 11.\n1  For purposes of class certification, the Court must accept as true the allegations in the\nComplaint.  Danvers Motor Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., Civil Action No. 02-2197 (DMC), 2007\nWL 419285 at *7 (D.N.J. Jan. 31, 2007); Thomas v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 201 F.R.D. 386,\n393 (E.D. Pa. 2001).\n2  Defendants have identified Plaintiff McShea’s polling place as “accessible,” but the polling\nmachines are located in a basement accessed by three steps and not in the accessible garage.  Compl.\n¶ 9.  Poll workers have carried Mr. McShea down the steps, placing both him and them at risk.  Id.\nPlaintiff Davenport’s polling place has a side entrance that is accessible, but it was locked in the\nNovember 2006 election and there was no signage at the front entrance indicating that an accessible\nalternative existed.  Id. ¶ 12.\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 5 of 20\nDefendants,  the  Philadelphia  Board  of  Election  and  the  City  Commissioners,  are\nresponsible for selecting polling places in the City of Philadelphia.  Compl. ¶¶ 13, 14.  Philadel-\nphia has more than 1,600 polling places.  Id. ¶ 23.  This large number of polling places enables\nPhiladelphians to vote at convenient locations near their homes in the company of their friends\nand neighbors.  Neighborhood voting provides individuals with more than an opportunity to cast\ntheir ballots.  It also provides them with the opportunity to meet and speak with election and\nparty officials who serve their neighborhoods, as well as to discuss the elections with neighbors\nat their polling places and receive information from the candidates.\nAlthough a Settlement Agreement in a prior, related lawsuit, National Organization on\nDisability v. Tartaglione, Civil Action No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa.), resulted in significant progress\ntoward the reduction of inaccessible polling places, more than 400 Philadelphia polling places\nremain inaccessible. See Compl. ¶ 24.  Plaintiffs and other voters do not have the option to\nunilaterally select an alternative accessible polling places of their choice.  Id. ¶ 23.  Defendants\nassign each registered voter in the City to a ward and a division based on where she lives.  Id.\nThe voter is required to vote in the polling place to which the Defendants have assigned her,\nregardless of whether it is accessible or inaccessible.  Id.\nFor Philadelphia voters with mobility disabilities who are assigned to an inaccessible\npolling place, the primary means by which they can vote is the alternative ballot process.  See\nCity of Philadelphia, Absentee Ballots at 2, available at http:// www.philllyelection.com/\nabeng.htm. (Exh. A).  The alternative ballot process places burdens and intrusions upon indivi-\nduals with mobility disabilities that are not imposed on non-disabled persons and that individuals\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 6 of 20\nwith mobility disabilities would not have to endure if their assigned neighborhood polling places\nwere physically accessible.\n# Individuals with disabilities must submit an application for an alternative ballot\nno later than 7 days prior to the election.  Absentee Ballots at 2.  Individuals with\nmobility disabilities assigned by Defendants to inaccessible polling places must\ndecide a week before the election whether they want to vote and lose the option\nto decide to vote based on events that occur in the week preceding the election.\n# Alternative ballots must be returned to the County Board of Elections no later\nthan the close of polls at 8:00 p.m. on Election Day.  Id.  Ballots postmarked on\nElection Day will not be honored.  Id.  This means that the voter either (1) must\nvote in advance of Election Day to mail the alternative ballot so that it is received\nno later than Election Day, or (2) must arrange for transportation on Election Day\nto the Board of Elections at City Hall -- a far greater distance for most voters than\ntheir assigned neighborhood polling place.\n# To apply for an alternative ballot, a voter uses the Pennsylvania Absentee Ballot\nApplication and checks “Illness or Physical Disability.”  See City of Philadelphia,\nInformation Statement on Access to the Election Process for People with Disabili-\nties in the City of Philadelphia (hereafter “Information Statement”) at 1, available\nat http://www.phillyelection.com/aceng.htm (Exh. B).  An individual who checks\nthat box must divulge the nature of his physical illness or disability as well as the\nname, address, and phone number of his physician.

It is, therefore, not\neven clear that Plaintiff McShea, whose polling place is incorrectly designated as\n“accessible,” would be permitted to vote by alternative ballot.\nWith some changes by Defendants, many Philadelphians with mobility disabilities who\ncurrently cannot vote in their neighborhoods could have equal opportunity to vote in the same\nway as non-disabled persons, eliminating the burdens and intrusions imposed by the alternative\nvoting process.  Many of the remaining inaccessible polling places -- with simple modifications\n-- could be made accessible.  Compl. ¶ 26.  For example, Plaintiff Davenport’s polling place has\nan accessible side entrance, but that entrance was locked on Election Day.  Id. ¶ 12.  If\n3 Although Defendants permit use of Pennsylvania’s Absentee Ballot Application to apply\nfor an alternative ballot, they have also created their own application form that can be used to seek\nan alternative ballot.  See Information Statement at 1.  Defendants’ application is virtually identical\nin all significant respects to Pennsylvania’s application except that the applicant checks “C” instead\nof “B” if she has an illness or physical disability.  Philadelphia County Bd. of Elections, Absentee/\nAlternative Ballot Application (Exh. D).  Defendants’ application, like Pennsylvania’s, requires the\nvoter to reveal the nature of her disability and the identity of her doctor and, if unable to sign, to have\nwitnesses attest to her mark.  Id. \n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 8 of 20\nDefendants merely unlocked that side door and placed signage at the front door to inform voters\nthat the side entrance could be used by people with mobility disabilities, the polling place would\nbe accessible.  Many inaccessible polling places that cannot be made even temporarily accessible\nwith modifications (such as temporary ramps) could be moved to accessible locations.  Id. ¶ 25.\nDefendants have failed to ensure that voters with mobility disabilities, such as the named\nPlaintiffs, are able to vote independently in accessible, integrated polling places in the same\nmanner as their non-disabled neighbors.  Compl. ¶¶ 21, 22, 27.  Defendants continue to select\nand use polling places that are inaccessible to voters with mobility disabilities.  Id. ¶ 28.\nDefendants  even  have  permitted  individuals  to  effectively  veto  their  decisions  to  move\ninaccessible polling places to accessible locations.  Id. ¶ 36.\nPlaintiffs contend that Defendants’ failure to take reasonable steps to make their polling\nplaces accessible violates Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §\n12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29 U.S.C. § 794.  Compl. ¶¶ 31-40.\nPlaintiffs seek appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief.  Id. ¶ 41.\nARGUMENT\nI.  PLAINTIFFS SATISFY THE PREREQUISITES\nOF FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 23(a).\n“In determining whether the class should be certified, the Court examines only the\nrequirements of Rule 23 and does not look at whether the Plaintiffs will prevail on the\nmerits.”  National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, Civil Action No. 01-1923, 2001\nWL 1258089 at *2 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 2001).  Even “[w]hen doubt exists concerning certifica-\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 9 of 20\ntion of the class, the court should err in favor of allowing the case to proceed as a class\naction.”  Id.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) establishes four requirements, each of which\nmust be satisfied for the maintenance of a class action:\n(1) the  class  must  be  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is\nimpracticable;\n(2) there must be a question of law or fact common to the class;\n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties must be typical of\nthe claims or defenses of the class; and,\n(4) the  representative  parties  must  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the\ninterests of the class.\nThis case satisfies each of these requirements.\nA.  The Proposed Class Is So Numerous\nthat Joinder of All Members Is Impracticable.\nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class must be so numerous that joinder of all class\nmembers would be impracticable.  “Impracticability does not mean impossibility, but rather\nthat the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the putative class calls for class\ncertification.”  Cureton v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, Civil Action No. 97-131, 1999\nWL 447313 at *5 (E.D. Pa. July 1, 1999); accord In re DaimlerChrysler AG Sec. Litig., 216\nF.R.D. 291, 295 (D. Del. 2003).  As the Third Circuit has written:  “No minimum number\nof plaintiffs is required to maintain a suit as a class action, but generally if the named plaintiff\ndemonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a)\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 10 of 20\nhas been met.”  Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d 220, 226-27 (3d Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536\nU.S. 958 (2002); see also Serventi v. Bucks Technical High School, 225 F.R.D. 159, 165\n(E.D. Pa. 2004) (evidence of at least 47 class members satisfied numerosity requirement).\nRule 23 “does not require ‘any particular number or require that joinder of all members be\nimpossible, so long as a good faith estimate of the number of class members is provided.’”\nNational Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1258089 at *2.\nThe proposed class in this case is comprised of eligible Philadelphia voters with mobility\ndisabilities who either developed a mobility disability or became eligible to vote after October\n22, 2001.4  While it is impossible to state with precision the exact number of class members, a\ngood faith estimate can be made. \n# There are approximately 22,000 live births in Philadelphia each year.  See\nPennsylvania Bureau of Health Statistics, Philadelphia County Health Profile\n2000, available at http://www.health.state.pa.us/stats (Exh. F).  This would mean\nthat roughly 22,000 Philadelphians turn 18 (and thus become eligible to vote)\n4  On October 22, 2001, this Court certified a class in National Organization on Disability\nv. Tartaglione, including a mobility disability subclass defined as “all mobility impaired individuals,\nincluding those that use a wheelchair to ambulate, and who are registered to vote in the City of\nPhiladelphia.”  National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1258089 at *5.  As\ndefined, therefore, the mobility disability subclass consisted only of those individuals who -- as of\nthe date of certification -- were registered to vote and had mobility disabilities.  This Court\nsubsequently denied a motion to certify a settlement class that would have substantially expanded\nthe mobility disability subclass to include all future eligible voters with mobility disabilities.  See\nNational Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, Order ¶ 4 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 19, 2004) (Exh. E).\nThe named Plaintiffs and putative class members either did not have mobility disabilities or were\nnot eligible to vote until after October 22, 2001.  Compl. ¶¶ 7-12, 15. As such, they are not members\nof the National Organization on Disability mobility disability subclass and are not bound by any\nprior agreements in that case.\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 11 of 20\neach  year.    Thus,  in  the  four  and  one-half  years  since  October  22,  2001,\napproximately 99,000 Philadelphians became eligible to vote.\n# Approximately 3 percent of the population are individuals who have “major”\nmobility problems, defined as an inability to walk or climb stairs or stand or the\nuse of wheelchair or scooter.  See Lisa I. Iezzoni, et al., Mobility Impairments and\nthe Use of Screening and Preventative Services, 90 Am. J. Pub. Health 955, 956\n(June 2000) (Exh. G). \n# Accordingly, approximately 2,970 Philadelphians who became eligible to vote\nsince October 22, 2001 (3 percent of the 99,000 newer voters) would likely have\na major mobility disability.\n# In addition to the approximately 2,970 newly eligible voters who have mobility\ndisabilities, the class also includes individuals who were eligible to vote prior to\nOctober 22, 2001, but who did not develop mobility disabilities until after that\ndate.  Although this number is unknown, it would certainly increase the number\nof class members.\nFactors in addition to the size of the class -- including the ability of class members to\npursue individual cases, the expediency of joinder, and the practicality of multiple lawsuits -- can\nalso militate in favor of certification.  See Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936 (2d Cir. 1993);\nIn re DaimlerChrysler AG Securities Litig., 216 F.R.D. at 295; Colorado Cross-Disability\nCoalition v. Taco Bell Corp., 184 F.R.D. 354, 358-59 (D. Colo. 1999); Cureton, 1999 WL\n447313 at *6; Metts v. Houstoun, Civil Action No. 97-4123, 1997 WL 688804 at *2 (E.D. Pa.\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 12 of 20\nOct. 22, 1997).  Here, potential class members are unlikely to have either the financial or time\nresources necessary to pursue individual actions.  In addition, identifying the potential class\nmembers, filing multiple lawsuits, and joining them would not be practical.  These factors,\ncombined with the large size of the class, make joinder impracticable and are more than\nsufficient to satisfy Rule 23(a)(1).\nB.  There Are Questions of Law and Fact Common to Plaintiffs and the Class.\nRule 23(a) also requires questions of law and fact common to the class.  The commonality\nrequirement does not mandate that all class members have identical claims, but merely that they\nhave common claims.  See Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169, 176-77 n.4 (3d Cir. 1988).  The Third\nCircuit has recognized that “the commonality standard of Rule 23(a)(2) is not a high bar:  it does\nnot require identical claims or facts among class members, as the ‘commonality requirement will\nbe satisfied if the named plaintiffs share at least one question of law or fact with the grievances\nof the prospective class.’”  Chiang v. Veneman, 385 F.3d 256, 265 (3d Cir. 2004) (citation\nomitted); accord Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d at 227; Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 56 (3d\nCir. 1994); National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1258089 at *3.\n“Courts appear to consider ‘common’ such challenges based on alleged violations of\nstatutory standards.”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56-57.  Further, “because they do not also involve\nan individualized inquiry for the determination of damage awards, injunctive actions ‘by their\nvery nature often present common questions satisfying Rule 23(a)(2).’”  Id. at 57 (citations\nomitted); accord National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1258089 at *3.\n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 13 of 20\nHere, there are a number of factual and legal issues common to Plaintiffs and all class\nmembers, including:\n# Can the remaining inaccessible Philadelphia polling places be made accessible\n(e.g., by using temporary ramps)?\n# Can  the  remaining  inaccessible  Philadelphia  polling  places  be  moved  to\naccessible locations?\n# Have Defendants allowed local party or election officials or others to veto\nDefendants’  decisions  to  relocate  inaccessible  polling  places  to  accessible\nlocations?\n# Do Defendants violate the ADA and RA by excluding Plaintiffs and class\nmembers from the voting process?\n# Do Defendants violate the ADA and RA by failing to afford Plaintiffs and class\nmembers equal opportunity to participate in the voting process?\n# Do Defendants violate the ADA and RA by using methods of administration that\nhave the effect of discriminating against Plaintiffs and class members and/or that\nsubstantially impair the objectives of Defendants’ program with respect to\nindividuals with mobility disabilities?\n# Do Defendants violate the ADA and RA by selecting sites for polling places that\nexclude  Plaintiffs  and  class  members  from  the  voting  process  and/or  that\nsubstantially impair the accomplishment of Defendants’ objectives with respect\nto individuals with mobility disabilities?\n# Do  Defendants  violate  the  ADA  and  RA  by  failing  to  make  reasonable\nmodifications to their policies, practices, and procedures necessary to avoid\ndiscriminating against Plaintiffs and class members?\n# Do Defendants violate the ADA and RA by failing to make their services\navailable to Plaintiffs and class members in the most integrated setting appropriate\nto their needs?\n# Do Defendants violate the ADA’s and RA’s program accessibility mandates?\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 14 of 20\nThis Court determined that virtually identical factual and legal issues were sufficient\nto satisfy the commonality requirement for certification of the mobility disability subclass in\nNational Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1258089 at *3; cf. Chiang v.\nVeneman, 385 F.3d at 265-66 (finding commonality in case involving various discrimination\nclaims); Serventi v. Bucks Technical High School, 225 F.R.D. at 165 (issues as to whether\ndefendants’ policies and practices violated ADA and RA satisfied commonality standard);\nT.B. v. School Dist., Civil Action No. 97-5453, 1997 WL 786448 at *3-*4 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 1,\n1997) (finding commonality, despite differences among class members, where there were\ncommon legal issues); Maldonado v. Houstoun, 177 F.R.D. 311, 320-21 (E.D. Pa. 1997)\n(finding commonality satisfied where there were common legal questions), aff'd on other\ngrounds, 157 F.3d 179 (3d Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1130 (1999).  Accordingly,\nRule 23(a)(2) is satisfied in this case.  \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Typical of Those of Class Members.\nPlaintiffs have also satisfied Rule 23(a)(3)’s typicality requirement.  “Typicality\nentails an inquiry [into] whether ‘the named Plaintiff's individual circumstances are markedly\ndifferent or ... the legal theory upon which the claims are based differs from that upon which\nthe claims of the other class members will perforce be based.’”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57-58\n(citation omitted); accord National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL\n1258089 at *3.  “Typicality, as with commonality, does not require ‘that all putative class\nmembers share identical claims.’”  In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 531-\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 15 of 20\n32 (3d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  Claims which challenge conduct that affects the named\nPlaintiffs as well as the class members, such as the claims in the instant case, “usually satisfy\nthe typicality requirement irrespective of the varying fact patterns underlying the individual\nclaims....  Actions requesting declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy conduct directed at\nthe class clearly fit this mold.”  Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58; accord Stewart v. Abraham, 275\nF.3d at 227.\nPlaintiffs’ and class members’ claims in this case arise from the same policies and\npractices and are based on the same legal theory, which this Court has previously determined to\nbe sufficient to satisfy the typicality requirement, i.e., “the failure of Defendants to select\nneighborhood polling places which are accessible to voters who use wheelchairs” in violation\nof the ADA and RA.  National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL  1258089\nat *3; cf. Serventi v. Bucks Technical High School, 225 F.R.D. at 165 (plaintiffs’ claims that they\nwere denied access to vocational education programs available to non-disabled plaintiffs in\nviolation of ADA and RA met typicality requirement).  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and\ninjunctive relief to remedy Defendants’ violations of the RA and ADA is typical of the putative\nclass members’ claims since they are “‘based on patterns and practices not special or unique to\n[Plaintiffs,] [and] a significant number of other members of the class have been similarly\nvictimized by the same patterns or practices.’”  Cureton, 1999 WL 447313 at *8 (quoting Weiss\nv. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 809 n.36 (3d Cir. 1984)).  Plaintiffs and class members are all\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 16 of 20\n“victims of the same systemic failures.”  T.B., 1997 WL 786448 at *5.  Rule 23(a)(3) is therefore\nsatisfied.5\nD.  The Named Plaintiffs Will Fairly and Adequately\nRepresent the Interests of the Class.\nRule 23(a)(4) requires that the named representatives fairly and adequately protect the\ninterests of the class.  This requirement has two components to assure that the absent class\nmembers’ interests are fully pursued:  (1) the interests of the named representatives are not in\nconflict with other class members, and (2) plaintiffs’ attorneys are qualified, experienced, and\ngenerally able to conduct the litigation.  See In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d at\n532; Hassine, 846 F.2d at 179; National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL\n1258089 at *4.\nHere, Plaintiffs and members of the class share the same injuries and seek the same relief\n-- declaratory and injunctive relief to end Defendant’s violations of the ADA and RA.  See\nServenti v. Bucks Technical High School, 225 F.R.D. at 165.  “Because the plaintiffs seek the\nsame injunctive relief as all members of the class, the court ‘can find no potential for conflict\nbetween the claims of the complainants and those of the class as a whole.’”  Metts, 1997 WL\n688804 at *4 (quoting Hassine, 846 F.2d at 179).  In addition, Plaintiffs’ counsel are qualified\nand experienced in federal class action litigation, the rights of individuals with disabilities, the\n5  This Court rejected arguments in National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione that\ntypicality was defeated because (1) not all class members of the mobility disability subclass were\nassigned to inaccessible voting place; and (2) some of the named plaintiffs had voted.  2001 WL\n1258089 at *3-*4.  “The potential factual differences mentioned by Defendants are too slight to\nwarrant a finding that the proposed subclasses of visually and mobility impaired voters do not satisfy\nthe typicality requirement ....”  Id. at *4.\n14\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 17 of 20\nADA, and the RA.  Stephen F. Gold and Robert W. Meek, respectively, have approximately 35\nyears and 30 experience as civil rights attorneys with expertise in disabilities law and class\nlitigation and have litigated numerous cases to enforce the ADA and RA.  See National\nOrganization on Disability v. Tartaglione, Civil Action No. 01-1923, 2001 WL 1258089 at *3\n(E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 2001) (Stephen F.

Accordingly, the requirements\nof Rule 23(a)(4) are satisfied.\nII.  THIS ACTION IS MAINTAINABLE AS A CLASS ACTION\nUNDER RULE 23(b)(2) SINCE DEFENDANT HAS ACTED OR REFUSED TO\nACT ON GROUNDS GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO THE CLASS.\nIn addition to meeting the requirements of Rule 23(a), a party seeking class certification\nalso must establish that the case falls into at least one of the three Rule 23(b) categories.\nAmchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997).  Rule 23(b)(2) allows a class\naction to be maintained if:  “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds\ngenerally  applicable  to  the  class,  thereby  making  appropriate  final  injunctive  relief  or\n6  The Disability Rights Network of Pennsylvania (DRN) is the successor organization to the\nDisabilities Law Project, which merged in February 2007 with Pennsylvania Protection and\nAdvocacy.\n15\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 8   Filed 04/30/07   Page 18 of 20\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole[.]”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\n“[I]t is generally recognized that civil rights actions seeking relief on behalf of classes ...\nnormally meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).”  Stewart v.

Tartaglione, 2001 WL\n1258089 at *5; Maldonado, 177 F.R.D. at 322.\nThis action readily meets the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2).  Plaintiffs, through this case,\nseek to define the Defendants’ obligations under the ADA and RA to assure that people with\nmobility disabilities are no longer subject to discrimination because they do not have equal\naccess to use the same voting process as non-disabled persons.  Plaintiffs seek solely declaratory\nand injunctive relief to assure that Defendants select and use accessible polling places.  This\nCourt found that virtually identical ADA and RA claims satisfied Rule 23(b)(2).  National\nOrganization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1258089 at *5; cf. Lightbourn v.

Plaintiffs, individuals with mobility disabilities, filed this lawsuit in February 2007\nagainst the Philadelphia Board of Elections and the City Commissioners (collectively, the City\nDefendants) to challenge the inaccessibility of polling places in Philadelphia.  Plaintiffs alleged\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 2 of 16\nthat the City Defendants violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42\nU.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29 U.S.C. § 794, by,\ninter alia, failing to maximize the number of accessible polling places and, thus, denying voters\nwith mobility disabilities equal access to Philadelphia’s voting program.  Plaintiffs sought\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  The City Defendants denied all allegations after the Court\nrejected their Motion to Dismiss in January 2008.\n2. At the urging of the Court in the spring of 2007, Plaintiffs and the City Defendants\nworked with Magistrate Judge Timothy R. Rice in an effort to negotiate a settlement, but the\nparties did not reach a settlement at that time.\n3. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Permanent Injunction in January 2008.  The Court\nsubsequently authorized the parties to engage in discovery.  Plaintiffs reviewed nearly 30,000\npages of documents produced by the City Defendants.  Both the Plaintiffs and the City\nDefendants propounded and responded to written discovery requests.  The City Defendants took\nover 25 depositions and Plaintiffs deposed a Rule 30(b)(6) witness designated by the City\nDefendants.  Plaintiffs also hired an expert witness who prepared a report in support of their\nMotion for Permanent Injunction and who the City Defendants deposed.  In addition, the\nPlaintiffs in the November 2007 and April 2008 elections surveyed over 250 polling places that\nthe City Defendants had designated as accessible.\n4. Over objections by the City Defendants, the Court on March 13, 2008 certified\nthis case to proceed as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) on\nbehalf of “all eligible Philadelphia County voters with mobility disabilities who either became\neligible to vote or developed a mobility disability after October 22, 2001.”\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 3 of 16\n5. Prior to the scheduled June 2008 hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Permanent\nInjunction, the City Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.\n6. By Order dated August 14, 2008, the Court denied in part and granted in part the\nCity Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.  The Court rejected all of the Defendants’\nsubstantive challenges to the Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims against the City Defendants.  The\nCourt, however, agreed with the City Defendants that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is an\nindispensable party and ordered the Plaintiffs to join the Pennsylvania Department of State as\na defendant in the litigation.1  The Court subsequently denied the City Defendants’ Motion for\nClarification, Reconsideration, or, in the Alternative, Certification for Interlocutory Appeal.\n7. On August 18, 2008, the Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint in accordance\nwith the Court’s summary judgment ruling.  In addition to stating ADA and RA claims against\nthe City Defendants, the Amended Complaint asserts claims under the Voting Accessibility for\nthe Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEH), the ADA, and the RA against the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of State and the Secretary of the Commonwealth (collectively, the Commonwealth\nDefendants).  The Commonwealth Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss in September 2008,\nwhich is pending.\n8. After the Court issued its summary judgment decision, the parties restarted\nsettlement negotiations under the guidance of Magistrate Judge Rice.  The United States\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ), which had been investigating issues relating to the accessibility\nof Philadelphia’s polling places, also participated in the negotiations.\n1  The Court also required the Plaintiffs to substitute the City of Philadelphia for the\nPhiladelphia Board of Elections.\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 4 of 16\n9. These negotiations ultimately resulted in a Settlement Agreement (Agreement),\na copy of which is submitted as Attachment 2.  The key provisions are summarized below.\na. Surveys of Polling Places -- Using a comprehensive survey instrument\ndeveloped by DOJ, all Philadelphia polling places will be surveyed by independent entities to\nassess their accessibility to voters with mobility disabilities.  Agreement ¶¶ II.A-II.E.\n(1) The surveys will begin immediately after DOJ enters into its\nseparate settlement agreement with the City Defendants.  Agreement ¶ II.D.2\n(2) DOJ  and  an  independent,  qualified  professional  selected  by\nMagistrate Judge Rice (the Private Third Party), using an agreed-upon Survey Instrument, each\nwill survey fifty percent of polling places designated by the City Defendants as accessible (i.e.,\nall polling places other than those designated by the City Defendants as “NN” or “NL”).  Id. ¶¶\nI.A, II.B & Exh. A.  DOJ also will survey the polling places designated by the City Defendants\nas inaccessible (“NN” or “NL”).  Id. ¶ II.B.\n(3) The Private Third Party will review no fewer than 120 polling\nplaces every two months (Survey Period), excluding the period for three weeks before and three\nweeks after the election when no surveys will be conducted (Survey Blackout Period).  Id. ¶¶\nII.D.1-2.  DOJ will conduct as many surveys as practicable with the goal of conducting no fewer\nthan 120 polling places surveys in each Survey Period (excluding the Survey Blackout Period).\nId. ¶¶ II.D.1, II.D.3.\n2  Under the Agreement between Plaintiffs and Defendants, DOJ must enter into a separate\nsettlement with the City Defendants (a copy of which is attached as Exhibit F to the Agreement) 90\ndays from the parties’ execution of the Agreement.  Agreement at 1 and ¶ VII.D.  If DOJ’s agreement\nwith the City Defendants is not finalized by that date, the Plaintiffs’ Agreement with Defendants will\nbe null and void and this litigation will be reinstated.  Id.\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 5 of 16\n(4) On the dates of the primary and general elections in 2009, DOJ and\nthe Private Third Party will evaluate further those polling places that they had found to be\ninaccessible in their prior surveys, but that the City Defendants have designated as accessible on\nelection day.  Id. ¶ II.E.3\n(5) Within 30 days of the end of each Survey Period, the Private Third\nParty and DOJ will issue a written report that contains the results of each survey, including for\neach polling place surveyed and determined to be inaccessible:\n(i) whether temporary modifications (e.g., portable ramps,\nthreshold ramps, or re-designation of “alternate” entrances as the exclusive entrances) can be\nused to make the polling places accessible;\n(ii) for  publicly-owned  polling  places,  whether  permanent\nmodifications can be made to make the buildings accessible;\n(iii)  for inaccessible polling places that cannot be modified\ntemporarily, whether the polling places can reasonably be relocated to sites that are accessible\n(or could be made accessible with temporary modifications) applying certain agreed-upon\ncriteria to determine the reasonableness of the relocation;4\n3  For example, the City Defendants designate one-step buildings as accessible since the City\nDefendants are to provide them with portable ramps for use on election day.  A survey prior to\nelection day can evaluate the accessibility of the interior of the space, but the accessibility of the\nexterior can be evaluated only on election day when the surveyor can see whether the portable ramp\nhas been delivered and is in place for use by voters.\n4  The criteria used to assess reasonableness of potential relocation sites include:  (1) that the\nproposed site is within the polling division or an adjacent division; (2) that the proposed site is no\nmore than 5 City blocks from the furthest edge of the division; (3) that there are no significant\ndangers that would preclude safe travel by pedestrians; (4) that the proposed site is large enough to\naccommodate the polling place; and (5) that the proposed site has the physical and mechanical means\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 6 of 16\n(iv) whether a temporary sign should be posted on election day\nto an alternate accessible entrance.  Id. ¶ II.G.\n(6) The Commonwealth Defendants will contribute up to 50 percent\nof the costs for the Private Third Party not to exceed $100,000 and the City Defendants will pay\nthe remaining costs up to $400,000.  Id. ¶¶ I.A.5, II.I.\nb. Decisions by the City Defendants on Independent Surveyors’ Recommen-\ndations – The Agreement reflects the Plaintiffs’ request that the City Defendants implement all\nrecommendations made by the surveyors.  Agreement ¶ III.A.  Based on this request, the City\nDefendants will notify Plaintiffs’ counsel, generally within 45 days of receipt of a recommen-\ndation  from  DOJ  or  the  Private  Third  Party,  as  to  whether  they  will  implement  the\nrecommendation or schedule a hearing before the Philadelphia County Board of Elections (the\nBoard).  Id.\n(1) If the Plaintiffs disagree with the City Defendants’ decision to\nschedule a hearing concerning a recommendation, then the parties will meet and confer within\n30 days of the City Defendants’ notification to the Plaintiffs.  Id. ¶ III.B.5\nto accommodate a polling place.  Agreement ¶ III.G.3(a).\n5  There are three situations in which the City Defendants need not either implement a\nrecommendation or schedule a hearing and, thus, there can be no appeal to the Magistrate Judge:\n(1) if the recommendation involves permanent modifications to a publicly owned building; (2) if the\nrecommendation is to relocate the polling place to a site when the owner refuses to allow the City\nDefendants to use the facility as a polling place; and (3) if the owner of a non-City owned polling\nplace refuses to allow implementation of recommendations for temporary modifications as to which\nconsent is necessary after the City Defendants offer to pay the reasonable costs for the modifications.\nAgreement ¶¶ III.C, III.D, III.H.  In addition, no hearings by the Board or the Magistrate Judge will\nbe held on recommendations concerning temporary signage, but, rather, the City Defendants’\ncompliance with such recommendations will be assessed by whether:  they post the temporary signs\nat the election place prior to election day; they instruct poll workers to assure that the signs are\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 7 of 16\n(2) If the parties are unable to reach consensus to resolve the dispute,\nthe City Defendants will schedule a hearing before the Board, generally within 60 days after the\ndate of the parties’ conference.  Id. ¶ III.E.  Plaintiffs, DOJ, the Commonwealth Defendants and\nothers may present evidence at these hearings, but their failure to do so or to participate will not\nlimit or restrict their rights to seek review by the Magistrate Judge, as described below.  Id. ¶\nIII.F.6\n(3) The Board will issue a decision on whether to accept or reject the\nrecommendation no later than 15 days after the hearing and the City Defendants will notify\nPlaintiffs’ counsel within seven days after the Board issues its decision.  Id. ¶ III.G.\nc. Judicial Review of Decisions by the City Defendants to Reject Recom-\nmendations of the Independent Surveyors -- If the Board, after a hearing, decides to not\nimplement a recommendation of the independent surveyor, the Plaintiffs can request a de novo\nhearing before the Magistrate Judge on whether the recommendation should be implemented.\nAgreement ¶¶ IV.A, IV.B.  The Magistrate Judge, following the evidentiary hearing, will issue\na decision on whether the City Defendants must adopt the disputed recommendation based on\nwhether the challenged polling places can reasonably be made temporarily accessible on election\nday or can reasonably be relocated to an accessible location within the division or an adjacent\nposted and provide them with additional signs to post in the event that the previously-posted signs\nwere removed; and instruct election day inspectors to check that the signs are posted and replace any\nmissing signs.  Id. ¶ V.E.\n6    The  City  Defendants  are  not  required  to  make  decisions  on  implementing\nrecommendations, meet with Plaintiffs’ counsel to discuss disputes, hold hearings, or issue decisions\nduring the period from 45 days prior to any election until 30 days after an election.  Agreement ¶\nIII.I.\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 8 of 16\ndivision, and, if raised by the City Defendants, whether the disputed recommendation would\nfundamentally alter the City’s voting program or constitute an undue financial or administrative\nburden on the City pursuant to the ADA and applicable case law.  Id. ¶ IV.B.  The parties can\nappeal any decision of the Magistrate Judge to the District Court pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 72(a).  Id. ¶ IV.C.\nd. Implementation of Recommendations and Decisions -- The City Defen-\ndants will implement all recommendations of the independent surveyors to which they agreed\nand all orders of the Magistrate Judge and District Court, generally in the election that follows\nthe agreement or order.  Agreement ¶¶ V.A, V.B.  The City Defendants can seek relief from their\nagreement to implement a recommendation by meeting and conferring with Plaintiffs’ counsel\nand, if unable to reach consensus, by petitioning the Magistrate Judge for relief pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60.  Id. ¶ V.D.\ne. Selection of Future Polling Places -- The City Defendants will take steps\nto assure that polling places selected through the November 2012 election will be accessible.\nAgreement ¶ VI.A.  To that end, the City Defendants will survey all new proposed polling\nlocations (using the survey instrument); provide Plaintiffs’ counsel with notification of the new\npolling location, the reason a new location was necessary, and a copy of the completed survey.\nIf the Plaintiffs object to the proposed new polling place, the process for Board hearings and\njudicial review will be utilized.  Id. \nf. Changes to Alternative Ballot Application -- The City Defendants will\nassure that, when it orders new absentee/alternative ballot applications, they will make clear that\nvoters with disabilities who check the “absentee” box will be required to cast their ballots by the\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 9 of 16\nFriday prior to the election and those who check the “alternative” box will be allowed to cast\ntheir ballots until the close of polls on election day.  Agreement ¶ VI.B.1.  Until new forms are\nordered, the City Defendants will include a notice that explains that difference to voters who\nrequest an absentee/alternative ballot.  Id. ¶ VI.B.2.\ng. Attorneys’ Fees, Litigation Expenses, and Costs -- The Defendants will\npay to Plaintiffs’ counsel $360,000 for attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs through the\ndate of final approval of the proposed Agreement, subject to the Court’s approval pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h).  Agreement ¶ IX.A.\nh. Retention of Jurisdiction -- Upon final approval of the Agreement by the\nCourt, the case will be dismissed with prejudice. Agreement ¶ IX.G.  However, the Court will\nretain jurisdiction over the litigation for the purposes of interpretation and enforcement of\ncompliance with the Agreement.  Id. ¶ IX.D.\ni. Termination of the Agreement -- The Agreement (including the Plaintiffs’\nand class members’ release of claims) will be terminated on March 31, 2013.  Id. ¶ IX.E.\n10. Plaintiffs request that the Court preliminarily approve the proposed Settlement\nAgreement.  “(cid:35)[I]f the proposed settlement appears to be the product of serious, informed, non-\ncollusive negotiations, has no obvious deficiencies, does not improperly grant preferential\ntreatment to class representatives or segments of the class, and falls within the range of possible\napproval, then the [C]ourt [will] direct that ... notice be given to the class members of a formal\nfairness hearing.(cid:38)”  Kaplan v. Chertoff, Civil Action No. 06-5304, 2008 WL 200108 at * 11\n(E.D. Pa. Jan. 24, 2008) (citation omitted).  Each of these criteria for preliminary approval of the\nSettlement Agreement is satisfied.\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 10 of 16\na. First, there can be little doubt that the Agreement is the result of “serious,\ninformed, non-collusive negotiations.”  The Agreement was reached only after the parties\ncompleted extensive discovery and the Court issued a comprehensive summary judgment\nopinion that set forth the law of the case on a number of disputed legal issues.  The negotiations\nwere conducted by experienced counsel at arms-length and supervised by the Court.\nb. Second, the Agreement does not give preferential treatment to the class\nrepresentatives or any particular segments of the class.  All class members are treated equally.\nSee Kaplan, 2008 WL 200108 at *11 (in granting preliminary approval to settlement of Rule\n23(b)(2) class action, the court noted that the agreement “provides injunctive relief in the form\nof a process,” thus assuring equal benefits to all class members).\nc Finally, the Agreement falls within the range of possible approval analyzed\nin accordance with the criteria set forth by the Third Circuit’s decision in Girsh v. Jepson, 521\nF.3d 153, 157 (3d Cir. 1975), and its progeny.  See In re AT & T Corp., 455 F.3d 160, 164-65\n(3d Cir. 2006); Kaplan, 2008 WL 200108 at *11; Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc. v. 3M\n(Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co.), 513 F. Supp. 2d 322, 330 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (Padova, J.).7\n(1) The complexity, expense, and likely duration of the litigation weigh\nin favor of approval.  This case was filed nearly two years ago.  Discovery has been completed.\nThere has been extensive motion practice.  Absent settlement, the Court must still rule on the\nCommonwealth Defendants’ pending motion to dismiss and, if it denies that motion, the\n7  Plaintiffs will submit a Memorandum of Law in support of final approval of the Settlement\nAgreement prior to the hearing that will detail the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the\nAgreement in accordance with Rule 23(e)(2).  Plaintiffs also will submit a separate Motion for\nAttorneys’ Fees, Litigation Expenses, and Costs in accordance with Rule 23(h).\n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 11 of 16\nCommonwealth Defendants could seek an opportunity for discovery.  A hearing on the pending\npermanent injunction motion would take several days and lengthy appeals would likely ensue\nregardless of which side prevailed at the hearing.  See Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513\nF. Supp. 2d  330-31.\n(2) The stage of proceedings weighs in favor of the Agreement.  The\nparties have completed discovery, which provided the Plaintiffs and their counsel with the\nknowledge they needed to make an informed decision about the merits of the Agreement.  See\nKaplan, 2008 WL 200108 at *11; Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 331-\n32.\n(3) The risks of establishing liability weigh in favor of the Agreement.\nAlthough Plaintiffs are confident that they could establish liability, the case raises legal questions\nof first impression in this Circuit (indeed, anywhere in the country) that an appellate court might\nview differently than did the District Court in its summary judgment ruling.  Plaintiffs cannot\ndisregard that potential risk.\n(4) Even greater than the risk of establishing liability, Plaintiffs had to\nconsider the risk that they would not be able to secure greater relief than that which is afforded\nby the Agreement.  The Agreement provides Plaintiffs with much of the relief they sought -- (a)\nindependent  surveys  of  all  Philadelphia  polling  places  that  comprehensively  assess  the\naccessibility of polling sites; (b) a neutral process for the Plaintiffs to challenge most decisions\nby the City Defendants to not implement the independent surveyors’ recommendations; and (c)\nan agreement by the City Defendants to make modifications recommended made by the\nsurveyors or, if challenged by the City Defendants, to make any modifications required by the\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 12 of 16\nMagistrate and Court.  Moreover, the City Defendants will begin to implement the Agreement\nquickly, thus affording Plaintiffs and class members relief far sooner than any relief they might\nsecure following further litigation in this Court and subsequent appeals that could take several\nyears.  Accordingly, the benefits afforded by the Agreement far outweigh the potential risks of\nseeking further relief through continued litigation.\n(5) Consideration of the range of reasonableness of the settlement in\nlight of the best possible recovery and the risks of litigation also weighs in favor of approval of\nthe Agreement.  The benefits conferred by the Agreement compare favorably to the best possible\nrecovery that Plaintiffs could have secured and fall well within the range of  reasonableness.\nAgain, the Agreement provides the Plaintiffs with almost all of the relief that they ultimately\ncould have secured if they prevailed at the hearing and following appeals and if the Court, using\nits discretion to shape injunctive relief, afforded the Plaintiffs all of the relief they had sought.\nGiven the attendant risks of litigation (including, but not limited to, the delays that would\naccompany further litigation and appeals), the Agreement’s benefits to class members are\nsignificant.\n11. Rule 23(e)(1) requires that “[t]he court must direct notice in a reasonable manner\nto all class members who would be bound by the proposal.”  The Court “(cid:35)should consider both\nthe mode of dissemination and its content to assess whether the notice is sufficient.(cid:38)”  Kaplan,\n2008 WL 200108 at *11 (citation omitted).\na. The parties propose to notify the Class through publication notice in the\nform submitted as Attachment 3.  The notice summarizes the litigation and the terms of the\nAgreement (including the provision relating to attorneys’ fees and the release of claims); informs\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 13 of 16\nclass members about the fairness hearing and their right to participate in that hearing; informs\nclass members about their right to object to the Agreement; affords them information about how\nto receive a copy of the Agreement; and provides contact information for class counsel.  The\ncontent of the notice is thus sufficient.  Cf. Kaplan, 2008 WL 200108 at *12 (notice in Rule\n23(b)(2) class settlement was sufficient where it described the litigation, defined the class,\nexplained the settlement, release, and fairness hearing, described how to file objections, and\nprovided contact information for class counsel); Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F.\nSupp. 2d at 329 (similar).\nb.   In cases certified under Rule 23(b)(2), “(cid:35)the stringent requirement ... that\nmembers of the class received the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including\nindividual  notice  to  all  members  who  can  be  identified  through  reasonable  efforts,  is\ninapplicable.(cid:36)”  Kaplan, 2008 WL 200108 at *12 (quoting Walsh v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.,\n726 F.2d 956, 962 (3d Cir. 1983)).  Given that class members are not required to take any actions\nto reap the benefits of the Agreement and that it would be virtually impossible to identify voters\nwith disabilities, the publication notice satisfies Rule 23(e).  See id. at *12-*13.  Specifically, the\nparties propose to publish the notice as follows:\n(1) The  City  Defendants  will  cause  the  publication  notice  to  be\npublished in the Philadelphia Daily News and the Philadelphia Tribune.  The notice will be\npublished twice in each paper on two different dates with the second publication within ten (10)\ndays of the initial publication.  All publication notices will be completed within thirty (30) days\nof the Court’s preliminary approval of the proposed Settlement Agreement and no later than four\n(4) weeks prior to the hearing on final approval of the proposed Settlement Agreement.  The City\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 118   Filed 04/20/09   Page 14 of 16\nwill also post the notice on its website within thirty (30) days after preliminary approval of the\nAgreement.\n(2) Within fourteen (14) days of the preliminary approval of the\nSettlement Agreement, the Disability Rights Network of Pennsylvania and Liberty Resources,\nInc. will post the notice on their websites.\nc. Counsel for Plaintiffs and the City Defendants will file a certification of\nnotice with the Court no later than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing on final approval\nof the proposed Settlement Agreement to certify their compliance with their respective notice\nobligations.\n12. Plaintiffs also request that:  (a) the Court establish a date for the hearing on final\napproval of the proposed Settlement Agreement; (b) that any objections to the proposed\nSettlement Agreement and notices of intention to appear be submitted no later than fourteen (14)\ndays prior to the hearing date; and (c) that Plaintiffs’ memorandum of law in support of the final\napproval of the proposed Settlement Agreement be submitted no later than ten (10) days prior\nto the hearing date.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant this Motion.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDated:  April 20, 2009 By: /s/ Robert W.

McSHEA, :\nTARIQ MANGUM, RENEE CROSBY, and :\nCAROLYN DAVENPORT, on behalf of :\nthemselves and all others similar ly situated, :\n:\nPlaintiffs, :\n: Civil Action No. 07-CV-687\nv. :\n: Class Action\nTHE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA; MARGARET :\nTARTAGLIONE, ANTHONY CLARK and :\nJOSEPH J. DUDA, in their official capacities as :\nPhiladelphia City Commissioners; :\nPENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF STATE  :\nand PEDRO A. CORTÉS, in his official capacity :\nas Secretary of the Commonwealth, :\n:\nDefendants. :\n________________________________________:\nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR AN AWARD OF\nATTORNEYS’ FEES, LITIGATION EXPENSES, AND COSTS\nPursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(h) and 54(d)(2), 42 U.S.C. § 12205, and\n29 U.S.C. § 794a(b), Plaintiffs and the Class, through their counsel, submit this Motion for an\nAward of Attorneys’ Fees, Litigation Expenses, and Costs in the amount of $360,000.  In support\nof this Motion, Plaintiffs and the Class state as follows:\n1. Plaintiffs and the Class have entered into a comprehensive Settlement Agreement\n(Agreement) with the City Defendants and the Commonwealth Defendants.1  By Order dated\n1  A copy of the Agreement was submitted as Attachment 2 to Plaintiffs’ Unopposed Motion\nfor Preliminary Approval of the Class Action Settlement Agreement and for Approval of Class\nNotice.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 130   Filed 07/02/09   Page 2 of 10\nApril 23, 2009, the Court preliminarily approved the Agreement and approved the distribution\nof publication notice to the Class.  Plaintiffs and the Class today submitted a Motion for Final\nApproval of the Class Action Settlement.  The Court has scheduled a fairness hearing for July\n14, 2009.\n2. The Agreement provides that the Defendants will pay a total of $360,000 for\nPlaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs through the date of final approval of the\nAgreement.  Agreement ¶ IX.A.  The City Defendants and Commonwealth Defendants will each\nbe responsible to pay $180,000 toward the total.  Id.  As set forth below, the $360,000 award that\nPlaintiffs’ counsel seek is 13 percent less than their actual attorneys’ fees, litigation expenses,\nand costs.\n3. The publication notice disseminated to the Class apprised class members that the\nAgreement provides for the payment of $360,000 by Defendants to Plaintiffs’ counsel, subject\nto approval of the Court.\n4. Both the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA)\nauthorize the payment of attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party who files a case to enforce those\nstatutes.  29 U.S.C. § 794a(b) (RA); 42 U.S.C. § 12205 (ADA).   Although these fee-shifting\nstatutes refer to the court’s discretion to award fees to a prevailing party, “‘it is well-established\nthat a prevailing party should recover an award of attorney’s fees absent special circumstances.’”\nTruesdell v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, 290 F.3d 159, 163 (3d Cir. 2002) (citation\nomitted).\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 130   Filed 07/02/09   Page 3 of 10\n5. A plaintiff is the “prevailing party” when the resolution of the dispute “‘changes\nthe legal relationship between itself and the defendant.’  ...  ‘The touchstone of the prevailing\nparty inquiry must be the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.’”  Truesdell,\n290 F.3d at 163 (quoting Texas State Teachers Ass’n v. Garland Independent School Dist., 489\nU.S. 782, 792-93 (1989)) (emphases in original).  When a court approves a settlement agreement\nand retains jurisdiction, there is a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties\nsufficient to confer prevailing party status on the plaintiff under fee-shifting statutes, such as the\nADA and RA.  Id. at 164, 165; accord The Arc of Delaware v. Meconi, Civil Action No. 02-255-\nKAJ, 2005 WL 3657319 at *2 (D. Del. June 13, 2005); Witcher v. Philadelphia Housing\nAuthority, Civil Action No. 01-CV-585, 2002 WL 32351170 at *1-*2 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 19, 2002).\n6. The Agreement that resolved this case effected a material alteration in the legal\nrelationship between the Plaintiffs and Defendants.  The Agreement obligates the Defendants\nto take concrete steps within identified time frames that will work to maximize the accessibility\nof Philadelphia polling places.  Defendants were under no obligation to take these actions -- and\nwould not have taken these actions -- without the litigation that yielded the Agreement.\nMoreover, the Agreement bears the type of judicial involvement and imprimatur that is needed\nto confer prevailing party status on the Plaintiffs.  First, the Agreement must be approved by the\nCourt and, upon approval, it will be incorporated in a Court Order.  Agreement ¶ VII.E; Pro-\nposed Order ¶ 4.  Second, the Court will continue its involvement in this action through the\nprovisions for dispute resolution that allow Plaintiffs to have the Magistrate Judge decide\nwhether accessibility or relocation recommendations that are rejected by the City Defendants\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 130   Filed 07/02/09   Page 4 of 10\nmust be implemented and the parties can appeal the Magistrate Judge’s rulings on those issues\nto the Court.  Agreement ¶¶ IV.A-D.  Finally, the Agreement (and the Order) provide that the\nCourt will retain jurisdiction for purposes of interpretation and enforcement of the Agreement.\nAgreement ¶ IX.D; Proposed Order ¶ 4.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are prevailing parties in this\ncase and, as such, they are entitled under the ADA and RA to an award of reasonable attorneys’\nfees, litigation expenses, and costs.\n7. “Reasonable attorneys’ fees are the product of the hours reasonably expended and\nthe applicable hourly rate for the legal services,” which is known as the “lodestar.”  Public\nInterest Research Group of New Jersey, Inc. v. Windall, 51 F.3d 1179, 1185 (3d Cir. 1995)\n(citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)); accord Maldonado v. Houstoun, 256\nF.3d 181, 184 (3d Cir. 2001).  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s aggregate lodestar is $389,554.40 broken\ndown follows:\nAttorney Hours Rate Lodestar\nStephen F. Gold 276.48 $425 $117,504.00\nRobert W. Meek 299.27 $400 $119,708.00\nRobin Resnick 476.07 $320 $152,342.40\nMeek Decl. ¶ 2 (Exh. A).   Detailed breakdowns of the time spent by counsel in the litigation of\nthis matter, which were maintained contemporaneously, id. ¶ 3, are submitted as Exhibits B, C,\nand D.\n8. Counsel spent a total of 1,051.82 hours on this matter.  These hours are reasonable\nin light of the vigorously contested nature of this litigation.\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 130   Filed 07/02/09   Page 5 of 10\na. Counsel’s time includes:  (1) investigating, researching, and drafting the\nComplaint and Amended Complaint; (2) researching and briefing related to the contested class\ncertification motion, the City Defendants’ and Commonwealth Defendants’ respective motions\nto dismiss, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Permanent Injunction, the City Defendants’ summary judgment\nmotion and motion for reconsideration or interlocutory appeal of the Court’s summary judgment\nruling; (3) extensive formal and informal discovery -- including review of nearly 30,000 pages\nof documents, extensive written discovery, defending the depositions of approximately 25\nwitnesses, and deposing the City Defendants’ Rule 30(b)(6) designee, and organizing and\nevaluating the data from surveys of approximately 250 polling places on election days in\nNovember 2007 and April 2008; and (4) months of settlement negotiations.  Meek Decl. ¶ 4.\nb. Plaintiffs’ counsel strived to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts.\nMeek Decl. ¶ 5.  Plaintiffs’ counsel have exercised billing judgment, including the exclusion of\ntime spent by co-counsel Seth Kreimer and by other attorneys at the Disability Rights Network\nof Pennsylvania.  Id.  Plaintiffs’ time also excludes time they will spend in preparation for and\nat the fairness hearing, although that time is included in the negotiated fee award under the\nAgreement.  Id.\n9. Plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable.2  “The court ‘should assess the\nexperience and skill of the prevailing party's attorneys and compare their rates to the rates\n2  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s rates reflect their current hourly rates, Meek Decl. ¶ 2, in accordance\nwith Third Circuit authority.  Lanni v. State of New Jersey, 259 F.3d 146, 149-50 (3d Cir. 2001);\naccord Bjorklund v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, Civil Action No. 98-CV-2838, 2003 WL\n22988885 at *2 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 20, 2003), aff’d, 118 Fed.

Houstoun, 256 F.3d at 184.  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s\nrates are an accurate reflection of their skill and experience as well as prevailing rates in this\ncommunity.\na. Mr. Gold, Mr. Meek, and, Ms. Resnick have practiced law for approxi-\nmately 38, 31, and 23 years, respectively.  As reflected in their resumes, all have extensive\nexperience in federal litigation and disabilities law, including key cases under the ADA.  Meek\nDecl. ¶ 6 & Exh. E, F, and G.\nb. The rates of Plaintiffs’ counsel are generally in accord with the most recent\nFee Schedule adopted by Community Legal Services (CLS) in Philadelphia dated April 1, 2006,\navailable at, http://www.clsphila.org (Exh. H).3  The Third Circuit has found the CLS Fee\nSchedule “‘to be a fair reflection of the prevailing market rates in Philadelphia.’”  Maldonado\nv. Houstoun, 256 F.3d at 187 (citation omitted); accord Bjorklund v. Philadelphia Housing\nAuthority, 2003 WL 22988885 at *2. \nc. The rates of counsel in this case also are consistent -- indeed, less than --\nthose charged by area firms in Philadelphia, the forum in which the case was litigated.  See A\n3  Mr. Gold’s rate is approximately 3.7 percent higher than the $410 rate for attorneys with\n“more than 25 years” of experience in the CLS Fee Schedule.  However, the CLS Fee Schedule has\nnot been adjusted for inflation in over three years.  If inflation were taken into account, the CLS Fee\nSchedule would set the maximum rate for an attorney with Mr. Gold’s experience at nearly $433.\nSee Inflation Calculator, available at http://data.bls.gov.  Thus, Mr. Gold’s $425 hourly rate is\nconsistent with CLS’s Fee Schedule as adjusted for inflation.\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 130   Filed 07/02/09   Page 7 of 10\nNationwide Sampling of Law Firm Billing Rates, 31 Nat'l L.J.

USF-Red Star Express, Inc., Civil Action No. 03-2216, 2005\nWL 555371 at *6 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2005) (hourly rates of $310 and $265, respectively, for Mr.\nMeek and Ms. Resnick), aff’d, 212 Fed.

Pa. 1992) (hourly rate of $270 for Mr.\nGold).\n10. Plaintiffs and the Class also incurred litigation expenses and costs4 totaling\n$17,281.42, comprised of the following expenditures:\n4  The ADA allows prevailing parties to recover “litigation expenses.”  42 U.S.C. § 12205.\nThe term “litigation expenses” is much broader than the limited “costs” taxable under 28 U.S.C. §\n1920.  Litigation expenses encompass, inter alia, expert fees, telephone, postage, messenger services\nand travel costs.  Lovell v.

Plaintiffs previously\nsubmitted a copy of the Settlement Agreement as Attachment 2 to their Unopposed Motion for\nPreliminary Approval of the Proposed Class Action Settlement Agreement and for Approval of\nClass Notice.  Based upon the arguments and authorities set forth below and the information to\nbe presented at the fairness hearing scheduled for July 14, 2009, Plaintiffs and the Class\nrespectfully submit that the Motion should be granted.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 4 of 28\nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THE LITIGATION\nPlaintiffs, individuals with mobility disabilities, filed this lawsuit in February 2007\nagainst the Philadelphia Board of Elections and the City Commissioners (collectively, the City\nDefendants) to challenge the inaccessibility of polling places in Philadelphia.  Plaintiffs alleged\nthat the City Defendants violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42\nU.S.C. §§ 12131-12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29 U.S.C. § 794, by,\ninter alia, failing to maximize the number of accessible polling places, thus, denying voters with\nmobility disabilities equal access to Philadelphia’s voting program.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory\nand injunctive relief.  After the Court denied their Motion to Dismiss in January 2008,  Kerrigan\nv. Phila. Bd. of Elec., Civil Action No. 07-687, 2008 WL 250522 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 29, 2008), the\nCity Defendants filed an Answer that denied all allegations.\nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for Permanent Injunction in January 2008.  The Motion\nidentified polling places that, based on surveys during the November 2007 election, were not\naccessible even though the City Defendants had identified them as accessible.  The Motion also\nidentified several inaccessible polling places that could be relocated to accessible sites.  The\nCourt initially scheduled a hearing on the Permanent Injunction Motion for March 2008, but, at\nthe request of the Defendants, subsequently postponed the hearing until June 2008.\nOver objections by the City Defendants, the Court on March 13, 2008 certified this case\nto proceed as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).  The Class is\ndefined as “all eligible Philadelphia County voters with mobility disabilities who either became\neligible to vote or developed a mobility disability after October 22, 2001.”  Kerrigan v. Phila.\nBd. of Elec., 248 F.R.D. 470 (E.D. Pa. 2008).\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 5 of 28\nThe parties conducted extensive discovery.  Plaintiffs reviewed nearly 30,000 pages of\ndocuments produced by the City Defendants.  Meek Decl. ¶ 2(a) (Exh.A).  Both the Plaintiffs\nand the City Defendants propounded and responded to written discovery requests.  Id. ¶ 2(b).\nThe City Defendants took 25 depositions and Plaintiffs deposed Robert Lee, Voting Registration\nCommissioner for the City Commissioners Office, who the City Defendants designated as a Rule\n30(b)(6) witness on issues relating to polling place selection and accessibility and the alternative\nballot process in Philadelphia.  Id. ¶¶ 2(c)-2(d).  Plaintiffs also hired an expert witness who\nprepared a report in support of their Motion for Permanent Injunction and who the City\nDefendants deposed.  Id. ¶ 2(f).  In addition, the Plaintiffs in the November 2007 and April 2008\nelections surveyed over 250 polling places that the City Defendants had designated as accessible\nand found that many were not, in fact, accessible.  Id. ¶ 2(e).\nPrior to the scheduled June 2008 hearing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Permanent Injunction,\nthe City Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.  As a result of that Motion, the Court\npostponed the permanent injunction hearing.  The City Defendants raised numerous challenges\nto Plaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims.  They also asserted that the Commonwealth was an indispen-\nsable party to the litigation.\nIn August 2008, the Court denied in part and granted in part the City Defendants’ Motion\nfor Summary Judgment.  Kerrigan v. Phila. Bd. of Elec., Civil Action No. 07-687, 2008 WL\n3562521 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 14, 2008).  The Court rejected the City Defendants’ challenges to the\nPlaintiffs’ ADA and RA claims.  Significantly, the Court ruled:  (1) that plaintiffs had presented\nsufficient evidence that the City’s voting program was not accessible because a “significant\npercentage” of the polling places were inaccessible; (2) that the City cannot rely solely on the\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 6 of 28\nalternative ballot process to make its voting program accessible, but, rather, has an obligation\nunder the ADA and RA to assure that voters with mobility disabilities “are able to vote in their\nneighborhood polling places” to the extent that it is reasonable for Defendants to provide\naccessible polling places; and (3) that the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped\nAct (VAEH) does not conflict with and supersede the ADA and RA, but, rather, that all of those\nstatutes require the City to maximize the number of accessible polling places and to rely on the\nalternative ballot process only as a last resort.  The Court, however, agreed with the City Defen-\ndants that the Commonwealth is an indispensable party and ordered the Plaintiffs to join the\nPennsylvania Department of State as a defendant in the litigation.1  The Court subsequently\ndenied the City Defendants’ Motion for Clarification, Reconsideration, or, in the Alternative,\nCertification for Interlocutory Appeal of its summary judgment ruling.\nOn August 18, 2008, the Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint in accordance with the\nCourt’s summary judgment ruling.  In addition to stating ADA and RA claims against the City\nDefendants, the Amended Complaint asserts claims under the VAEH, the ADA, and the RA\nagainst  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Commonwealth\n(collectively, the Commonwealth Defendants).  The Commonwealth Defendants filed a Motion\nto Dismiss in September 2008, which is pending.\n1  The Court also required the Plaintiffs to substitute the City of Philadelphia for the\nPhiladelphia Board of Elections.\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 7 of 28\nBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE\n  PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\nA.  Settlement Negotiations\nAt the urging of the Court in the spring of 2007, shortly after this lawsuit was filed,\nPlaintiffs and the City Defendants worked with the Honorable Timothy R. Rice, United States\nMagistrate Judge, in an effort to negotiate a settlement.  Meek Decl. ¶ 5.  Despite numerous\nmeetings and discussions through at least November 2007, the parties were unable to reach\nagreement at that time.  Id.\nAfter the Court issued its summary judgment decision in August 2008, the parties\nrestarted settlement negotiations under the guidance of Magistrate Judge Rice.  Meek Decl. ¶ 6.\nThe United States Department of Justice (DOJ), which had been investigating issues relating to\nthe accessibility of Philadelphia’s polling places but which had not instituted any litigation\nagainst the City or participated in the Kerrigan lawsuit as a party or amicus, also participated in\nthe negotiations.  Id.  The parties and DOJ met frequently, by phone and in person, with\nMagistrate Judge Rice and had frequent discussions on their own.  Id.  The negotiations were\narms-length, non-collusive, wide-ranging and, not infrequently, contentious.  Id.  After nearly\nseven months of negotiations, the parties finalized a Settlement Agreement (Agreement) in April\n2009.  Id. ¶ 7.\nB.  Preliminary Approval and Class Notice\nThe Agreement was presented to the Court on April 20, 2009 for preliminary approval.\nThe Court, by Order dated April 23, 2009, granted preliminary approval to the Agreement.\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 8 of 28\nIn its April 23, 2009 Order, the Court also approved the publication notice scheme and\nthe content of the notice.  The Notice as well as the entire Agreement has been posted on the\nwebsite of the Disability Rights Network of Pennsylvania since April 29, 2009.  See Certification\nof Notice of Robert W. Meek ¶ 3.  The Notice also has been posted on the website of Liberty\nResources, Inc., the Center for Independent Living that provides services to Philadelphians with\nphysical disabilities, since April 24, 2009.  See id.  The City Defendants caused the notice to be\npublished twice in both the Philadelphia Daily News and the Philadelphia Tribune and to be\nposted on the City’s website prior to May 26, 2009.  Accordingly, class members have had more\nthan 30 days to submit any comments or objections to the Agreement.\nC.  Terms of the Settlement Agreement\nThe Settlement Agreement confers significant benefits on members of the Class by\nproviding a comprehensive process to maximize the number of accessible polling places in the\nCity.  This process includes the following steps.\n1. Surveys of Polling Places -- Using a comprehensive survey instrument developed\nby the parties and DOJ, all Philadelphia polling places will be surveyed by independent entities\nto assess their accessibility to voters with mobility disabilities.  Agreement ¶¶ II.A-II.E & Att.\nA.  The surveys will begin immediately after DOJ enters into its separate settlement agreement\nwith the City Defendants.  Agreement ¶ II.D.2  DOJ and an independent, qualified professional\nselected by Magistrate Judge Rice (the Private Third Party), using an agreed-upon Survey\nInstrument, each will survey fifty percent of polling places designated by the City Defendants\n2  DOJ entered into a separate settlement with the City Defendants, a copy of which is\nattached as Exhibit F to the Agreement.\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 9 of 28\nas accessible (i.e., all polling places other than those designated as “NN” or “NL”).  Id. ¶¶ I.A,\nII.B & Exh. A.3  DOJ also will survey the polling places designated by the City Defendants as\ninaccessible (i.e., “NN” or “NL”).  Id. ¶ II.B.\nThe Private Third Party will review no fewer than 120 polling places every two months\n(Survey Period), excluding the period for three weeks before and three weeks after the election\nwhen no surveys will be conducted (Survey Blackout Period).  Agreement ¶¶ II.D.1-2.  DOJ will\nconduct as many surveys as practicable with the goal of conducting no fewer than 120 polling\nplaces surveys in each Survey Period (excluding the Survey Blackout Period).  Id. ¶¶ II.D.1,\nII.D.3.  On the dates of the primary and general elections, DOJ and the Private Third Party will\nevaluate further those polling places that they had found to be inaccessible in their prior surveys,\nbut that the City Defendants have designated as accessible on election day.  Id. ¶ II.E.4\nWithin 30 days of the end of each Survey Period, the Private Third Party and DOJ will\nissue written reports that contain the results of each survey, including for each polling place\nsurveyed and determined to be inaccessible:\n(1) whether temporary modifications (e.g., portable ramps, threshold ramps,\nor re-designation of “alternate” entrances as the exclusive entrances) can\nbe used to make the polling places accessible;\n3  By Order dated April 27, 2009, Magistrate Judge Rice appointed Campbell Thomas & Co.,\na private architectural firm in Philadelphia, as the Private Third Party under the Agreement.\n4  For example, the City Defendants designate one-step buildings as accessible since the City\nDefendants are supposed to provide the building owners with portable ramps for use on election day.\nA survey prior to election day can evaluate the accessibility of the interior of the space, but the\naccessibility of the exterior can be evaluated only on election day when the surveyor can see whether\nthe portable ramp has been delivered and is in place for use by voters.\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 10 of 28\n(2) for publicly-owned polling places, whether permanent modifications can\nbe made to make the buildings accessible;\n(3) for  inaccessible polling  places  that  cannot  be  modified  temporarily,\nwhether the polling places can reasonably be relocated to sites that are\naccessible (or could be made accessible with temporary modifications)\napplying certain agreed-upon criteria to determine the reasonableness of\nthe relocation;5\n(4) whether a temporary sign should be posted on election day to an alternate\naccessible entrance.\nAgreement ¶ II.G.\nThe Commonwealth Defendants will contribute up to 50 percent of the costs for the\nPrivate Third Party not to exceed $100,000.  Agreement ¶ II.I.  The City Defendants will pay the\nremaining costs up to $400,000.  Id. ¶¶ I.A.5, II.I.\n2. Decisions by the City Defendants on Independent Surveyors’ Recommendations\n– After the surveyors make their recommendations, the City Defendants will notify Plaintiffs’\ncounsel (generally within 45 days of receipt of a recommendation from DOJ or the Private Third\nParty) as to whether they will implement the recommendation or schedule a hearing before the\nPhiladelphia County Board of Elections (the Board).  Agreement ¶ III.A.   If the Plaintiffs dis-\n5  The criteria used to assess reasonableness of potential relocation sites include:  (1) whether\nthe proposed site is within the polling division or an adjacent division; (2) whether the proposed site\nis no more than five City blocks from the furthest edge of the division; (3) whether there are any\nsignificant dangers or obstacles that would preclude safe travel by pedestrians; (4) whether the\nproposed site is large enough to accommodate the polling place; and (5) whether the proposed site\nhas the physical and mechanical means necessary to accommodate a polling place.  Agreement ¶\nII.G.3(a).\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 11 of 28\nagree with the City Defendants’ decision to schedule a hearing concerning a recommendation,\nthen the parties will meet and confer within 30 days of the City Defendants’ notification to the\nPlaintiffs.  Id. ¶ III.B.6\nIf the parties are unable to reach consensus to resolve the dispute, the City Defendants\nwill schedule a hearing before the Board, generally within 60 days after the date of the parties’\nconference.  Id. ¶ III.E.  Plaintiffs, DOJ, the Commonwealth Defendants and others may present\nevidence at these hearings, but their failure to do so or to participate will not limit or restrict their\nrights to seek review by the Magistrate Judge, as described below.  Id. ¶ III.F.7  The Board will\nissue a decision on whether to accept or reject the recommendation no later than 15 days after\nthe hearing and the City Defendants will notify Plaintiffs’ counsel of the Board’s decision within\nseven days.  Id. ¶ III.G.\n6  There are three situations in which the City Defendants need not either implement a\nrecommendation or schedule a hearing and, thus, there can be no appeal by Plaintiffs to the Magis-\ntrate Judge:  (1) if the recommendation involves permanent modifications to a publicly owned\nbuilding; (2) if the recommendation is to relocate the polling place to a site when the owner of the\nproposed site refuses to allow the City Defendants to use the facility as a polling place; and (3) if the\nowner of a non-City owned polling place refuses to allow implementation of recommendations for\ntemporary modifications as to which consent is necessary after the City Defendants offer to pay the\nreasonable costs for the modifications.  Agreement ¶¶ III.C, III.D, III.H.  In addition, no hearings by\nthe Board or the Magistrate Judge will be held on recommendations concerning temporary signage,\nbut, rather, the City Defendants’ compliance with such recommendations will be assessed by\nwhether:  they post the temporary signs at the election place prior to election day; they instruct poll\nworkers to assure that the signs are posted and provide them with additional signs to post in the event\nthat the previously-posted signs were removed; and instruct election day inspectors to check that the\nsigns are posted and replace any missing signs.  Id. ¶ V.E.\n7  The City Defendants are not required to make decisions on implementing recommen-\ndations, meet with Plaintiffs’ counsel to discuss disputes, hold hearings, or issue decisions  during\nthe period from 45 days prior to any election until 30 days after an election.  Agreement ¶ III.I.\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 12 of 28\n3. Judicial Review of Decisions by the City Defendants to Reject Recommendations\nof the Independent Surveyors -- If the Board, after a hearing, decides not to implement a\nrecommendation of the independent surveyor, the Plaintiffs can request a de novo hearing before\nthe Magistrate Judge on whether the recommendation should be implemented.  Agreement ¶¶\nIV.A, IV.B.  The Magistrate Judge, following the evidentiary hearing, will issue a decision on\nwhether the City Defendants must adopt the disputed recommendation based on whether the\nchallenged polling place can reasonably be made temporarily accessible on election day or can\nreasonably be relocated to an accessible location within the division or an adjacent division, and,\nif raised by the City Defendants, whether the disputed recommendation would fundamentally\nalter the City’s voting program or constitute an undue financial or administrative burden on the\nCity pursuant to the ADA and applicable case law.  Id. ¶ IV.B.  The parties can appeal any\ndecision of the Magistrate Judge to the District Court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 72(a).  Id. ¶ IV.C.\n4. Implementation of Recommendations and Decisions -- The City Defendants will\nimplement all recommendations of the independent surveyors to which they agreed and all orders\nof the Magistrate Judge and District Court, generally in the election that follows the agreement\nor order.  Agreement ¶¶ V.A, V.B.  The City Defendants can seek relief from their agreement\nto implement a recommendation by meeting and conferring with Plaintiffs’ counsel and, if\nunable to reach consensus, by petitioning the Magistrate Judge for relief pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 60.  Id. ¶ V.D.\n5. Selection of Future Polling Places -- The City Defendants will take steps to\nassure that polling places selected through the November 2012 election will be accessible.\n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 13 of 28\nAgreement ¶ VI.A.  To that end, the City Defendants will survey all new proposed polling\nlocations (using the Survey Instrument); provide Plaintiffs’ counsel with notification of the new\npolling location, the reason a new location was necessary, and a copy of the completed survey.\nIf the Plaintiffs object to the proposed new polling place, the process for Board hearings and\njudicial review will be utilized.  Id. \nIn addition to the process adopted to maximize the number of accessible polling places\noutlined above, the Agreement also requires the City Defendants to assure that, when it orders\nnew absentee/alternative ballot applications, they will make clear that voters with disabilities\nwho check the “absentee” box will be required to cast their ballots by the Friday prior to the\nelection and those who check the “alternative” box will be allowed to cast their ballots until the\nclose of polls on election day.  Agreement ¶ VI.B.1.  Until new forms are ordered, the City\nDefendants  will  include  a  notice  that  explains  that  difference  to voters  who  request  an\nabsentee/alternative ballot.  Id. ¶ VI.B.2.\nIf the Agreement is approved, the Defendants will pay to Plaintiffs’ counsel $360,000 for\nattorneys’ fees, litigation expenses, and costs through the date of final approval of the proposed\nAgreement, subject to the Court’s approval pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h).\nAgreement ¶ IX.A.8\nUpon final approval of the Agreement by the Court, the case will be dismissed with\nprejudice. Agreement ¶ IX.G.  However, the Court will retain jurisdiction over the litigation for\nthe purposes of interpretation and enforcement of compliance with the Agreement.  Id. ¶ IX.D.\n8  Plaintiffs have today submitted a Motion for an Award of Attorneys Fees, Litigation\nExpenses, and Costs in accordance with Rule 23(h).\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 14 of 28\nThe Agreement (including the Plaintiffs’ and class members’ release of claims) will be\nterminated on March 31, 2013.  Id. ¶ IX.E.\nARGUMENT\nTHE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS FAIR, ADEQUATE,\nAND REASONABLE AND SHOULD BE APPROVED BY THE COURT.\nA.  Class Notice was Adequate.\nThe Constitution and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure both require adequate notice\nof a proposed settlement.  See Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc. v. 3M (Minnesota Mining\n& Mfg. Co.), 513 F. Supp. 2d 322, 327 (E.D. Pa. 2007) (Padova, J.); Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1).\nThe notice must be reasonably calculated to “‘apprise interested parties of the pendency of the\naction and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’”  Bradburn Parent Teacher\nStore, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 328 (citation omitted).\nAs this Court ruled in its April 23, 2009 Order, the publication notice “adequately\napprise[d] class members of the litigation; the terms of the Agreement and the class members’\nright to object; the fairness hearing and the class members’ right to participate; and information\non how they can receive a copy of the Agreement.”  The content of the notice, therefore, was\nadequate to protect the class members’ due process rights.  Cf. Bradburn Parent Teacher Store,\nInc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 328. \nGiven that the identities of specific voters with mobility disabilities who would be class\nmembers is unknown and unknowable, individual notice simply was not possible in this case.\nThe parties instead provided only publication notice.  The City Defendants had notices published\ntwice in two of Philadelphia’s leading newspapers, The Philadelphia Daily News, and The\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 15 of 28\nPhiladelphia Tribune, as well as on its website.  In addition, publication notice was targeted\nparticularly to potential class members through the posting of the notice on the websites of the\nDisability Rights Network of Pennsylvania and Liberty Resources, Inc., two of the key disability\nrights organizations in the region.  All of the notices were published prior to May 26, 2009\ngiving class members more than a month to submit any comments or objections.  Given the\ncircumstances of this case, the publication notice scheme comported with the requirements of\ndue process and the Federal Rules.  Cf. Hawker v. Consovoy, 198 F.R.D. 619, 621 & n.5 (D.N.J.\n2001) (in Rule 23(b)(2) class action on behalf of inmates, posting of settlement notice in prisons\nand newspapers advising them of settlement and opportunity to comment was adequate).\nB.  The Standards Used To Assess The Adequacy\nOf A Proposed Class Action Settlement.\nThe standards to be applied in determining whether to approve a class action settlement\nare well-established.  “Compromises of disputed claims are favored by the courts.”  Williams v.\nFirst National Bank, 216 U.S. 582, 595 (1910); accord In re General Motors Pick-Up Fuel Tank\nProducts Liability Litig. (GMC), 55 F.3d 768, 784 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 824 (1995).\nSettlements are particularly favored “in class actions and other complex cases where substantial\njudicial resources can be conserved by avoiding formal litigation.”  GMC, 55 F.3d at 784; accord\nMcCoy v. Health Net, Inc., 569 F. Supp. 2d 448, 458 (D.N.J. 2008); Parks v. Portnoff Law\nAssoc., 243 F. Supp.2d 244, 249 (E.D. Pa. 2003).\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court should approve a class action\nsettlement if it is “fair, adequate and reasonable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e); accord GMC, 55 F.3d\nat 785; Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d 115, 118 (3d Cir. 1990); Girsh v. Jepson, 521 F.2d\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 16 of 28\n153, 157 (3d Cir. 1975); Bryan v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 494 F.2d 799, 801 (3d Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 419 U.S. 900 (1974).  “‘The decision of whether to approve a proposed settlement of a\nclass action is left to the sound discretion of the district court.’”  Bradburn Parent Teacher Store,\nInc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 327 (citation omitted).\nAn initial “‘presumption of fairness’” attaches to a class action settlement when the court\nfinds that:  “‘(1) the negotiations occurred at arm's length; (2) there was sufficient discovery; (3)\nthe proponents of the settlement are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small\nfraction of the class objected.’”  In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 391 F.3d 516, 535 (3d\nCir. 2004) (citation omitted); accord Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at\n329-30.  A presumption of fairness is warranted in this case.  The Agreement was the result of\nnon-collusive, intensive, often contentious, arms-length negotiations that lasted for nearly seven\nmonths, including multiple meetings in-person and by telephone with Magistrate Judge Rice to\nfacilitate the process.  Meek Decl. ¶¶ 6-7.  Plaintiffs’ counsel, who are seasoned litigators with\nmany years of experience in disabilities rights litigation, agreed to the settlement only after they\nhad the opportunity -- through discovery, motions practice, and negotiations -- to fully assess and\nconsider all legal and factual issues.  See id. ¶¶ 2-8, 11.  Finally, to date, there have been no\nobjections to the settlement.\nThe Third Circuit has enumerated a number of elements which a district court may\nconsider in evaluating the fairness of a class settlement:\n(1) the complexity and likely duration of the litigation;\n(2) the reaction of the class to the settlement;\n(3) the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery completed;\n14\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 17 of 28\n(4) the risks of establishing liability;\n(5) the risks of establishing damages;\n(6) the risks of maintaining a class action;\n(7) the ability of defendant to withstand a greater judgment;\n(8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the best recovery;\nand,\n(9) the range of reasonableness of the settlement in light of the attendant risks\nof litigation.\nGMC, 55 F.3d at 785; accord Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 330.\nIn assessing a proposed settlement, “[c]ourts judge the fairness of a proposed compromise\nby weighing the plaintiff's likelihood of success on the merits against the amount and form of\nthe relief offered in the settlement.”  Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 88 n.14\n(1981); accord Bryan v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 494 F.2d at 801.  Courts should “not decide\nthe merits of the case or resolve unsettled legal questions.” Carson, 450 U.S. at 88 n.14.  “While\nthe court is obligated to ensure that the proposed settlement is in the best interest of the class\nmembers by reference to the best possible outcome, it must also recognize that settlement\ntypically represents a compromise and not hold counsel to an impossible standard.”  In re Aetna\nInc. Securities Litig., MDL No. 1219, 2001 WL 20928 at *6 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 4, 2001) (Padova, J.).\nC.  The Proposed Settlement Agreement\nIs Fair, Adequate, And Reasonable.\nExamining the Agreement in light of the criteria outlined above, it must be concluded that\nit is fair, adequate, and reasonable and in the best interests of the class members.\n15\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 18 of 28\n1.  Complexity And Likely Duration of the Litigation\n“This factor is intended to capture ‘the probable costs, in both time and money, of\ncontinued litigation.'\"  GMC, 55 F.3d at 812 (citation omitted); Bradburn Parent Teacher Store,\nInc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 330.  This case has already been pending over two years, and further\nlitigation likely would prove complicated and costly.  Although the Plaintiffs and the City\nDefendants had completed discovery at the time of settlement, the Court had not yet ruled on the\nCommonwealth Defendants’ pending Motion to Dismiss.  If the Court denied that Motion, the\nCommonwealth presumably would be provided with an opportunity for discovery and to file\npotentially dispositive motions.  The subsequent trial of this action (including trial preparation)\nwould be time-consuming.9 \nThis  case  would  require  resolution  of  complex  factual  issues  at  trial,  including\npotentially:\n» identification of numerous inaccessible polling places in Philadelphia and whether\nthey could be made accessible or relocated to other potential sites;\n» how the alternative and emergency alternative ballot process works on paper and\nin practice;\n» whether the City Defendants rejected relocations of inaccessible polling places to\nfeasible, accessible locations;\n9  Further litigation also would entail further costs, including expert witness costs at trial.\nThough now financed by Plaintiffs' counsel, these costs ultimately would be borne by the public if\nthe Plaintiffs prevail, which supports approval of the Agreement.  Hawker v. Consovoy, 198 F.R.D.\nat 628.\n16\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 19 of 28\n» whether  the  Commonwealth  Defendants  erroneously  determined  that  all\nPhiladelphia polling places are accessible or could not be made accessible or\nrelocated to accessible sites.\nMeek Decl. ¶ 9(a).  The complexity of the factual issues would likely be further complicated by\ndisputes concerning the relevance of some of these issues (e.g., impact of a potential polling\nplace relocation on persons who are older, but not necessarily disabled).  Id.  Evidentiary motion\npractice would be likely.\nEven more than the complicated factual issues, this case raised numerous legal issues,\nmost of which involve matters of first impression.  Although the Court resolved many of these\nhotly disputed legal issues in its ruling on the City Defendants’ summary judgment motion\n(which would be the law of the case), the Commonwealth Defendants raised equally challenging\nlegal issues in their Motion to Dismiss, including, for example: the scope of their obligations\nunder the VAEH regarding local polling place accessibility; whether the Commonwealth\nDefendants were entitled under the VAEH to rely on the City Defendants’ assessments of polling\nplaces; whether Plaintiffs are judicially estopped from asserted claims against the Common-\nwealth Defendants; and whether the Plaintiffs stated actionable claims against the Common-\nwealth Defendants under the ADA and RA.  Meek Decl. ¶ 9(b).   Both the City and the\nCommonwealth Defendants would almost certainly appeal adverse legal determinations and how\nthe appellate courts would resolve these issues is unknown.  These novel legal issues and the\nuncertainty of their outcome weigh in favor of the proposed Agreement.  See Parks v. Portnoff\nLaw Assoc., 243 F. Supp.2d 244, 251 (E.D. Pa. 2003).\n17\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 20 of 28\nGiven the novelty and complexity of the factual and legal issues raised in this case, post-\ntrial motions and appeals following judgment would be inevitable. This would result in ever\nincreasing costs and delay.\nAlthough Plaintiffs are convinced that they would ultimately prevail if this case were\nlitigated through trial and appeals, the delays caused by further litigation of this case if it were\nnot settled “would only be inimical to the interests of the plaintiff class.”  Foe v. Cuomo, 700 F.\nSupp. 107, 112 (E.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd, 892 F.2d 196 (2d Cir. 1989) (per curiam), cert. denied,\n498 U.S. 972 (1990).  The value of having the benefits from this litigation at this time also must\nbe considered favorably in assessing the adequacy of the Settlement Agreement.  See GMC, 55\nF.3d at 812; In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 212 F.R.D. at 254.\n2.  Reaction of the Class\n“‘This factor attempts to gauge whether members of the class support the settlement.’”\nParks v. Portnoff Law Assoc., 243 F. Supp.2d at 251 (citation omitted).  To date, there have been\nno objections to the settlement.  The “total absence of objections argues in favor of the proposed\nSettlement.”  Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc. , 513 F. Supp. 2d at 331.10\n3.  Stage of the Proceedings\nThe purpose of considering the stage of the proceedings and the amount of discovery\ntaken is to assure that Plaintiffs had access to sufficient material to evaluate the case and to\n10   Indeed, even a small number of objections, if they were not relevant, would still weigh\nin favor of approval of the Settlement Agreement.  See Stoetzner v. U.S. Steel Corp., 897 F.2d at\n118-19 (approving post-verdict settlement of class action, noting that only 29 of the 281 class\nmembers objected); Bryan v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 494 F.2d at 803 (rejecting contention that\ndistrict court abused its discretion in approving class action settlement over objections of more than\n20% of class members).\n18\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 21 of 28\nassess the adequacy of the settlement proposal with an informed judgment of the strengths and\nweaknesses of the merits of their case.  See GMC, 55 F.3d at 813; Bradburn Parent Teacher\nStore, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 331.  Since Plaintiffs had a full opportunity to develop an adequate\nappreciation of the merits of the case and make an informed judgment regarding settlement, id.,\nthis factor, too, weighs in favor of approval.  See Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F.\nSupp. 2d at 331-32; Parks v. Portnoff Law Assoc., 243 F. Supp.2d at 251.\nPlaintiffs did not enter into this Agreement until the completion of extensive formal and\ninformal  discovery  with  the  City  Defendants.  Plaintiffs  reviewed  over  30,000  pages  of\ndocuments produced by the City Defendants.  Plaintiffs also reviewed the City Defendants’\nresponses to written interrogatories.  Plaintiffs deposed Robert Lee, the key official responsible\nfor the accessibility of the City’s polling places and the alternative ballot process.  Plaintiffs\nreceived  an  expert  report.    Plaintiffs  also  responded  to  numerous  document  requests,\ninterrogatories, and requests for admission.  In addition, Plaintiffs and their witnesses, including\ntheir expert witness, were subject to 25 deposition by Defendants.  Perhaps most importantly,\nPlaintiffs conducted on-site surveys of the accessibility of approximately 250 polling places in\nthe November 2007 and April 2008 elections.  Meek Decl. ¶ 2.\nAlthough the Plaintiffs had not yet undertaken discovery from the Commonwealth Defen-\ndants, there would be little, if any, discovery needed by the Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs had access to\nthe Commonwealth Defendants’ policies and practices relating to polling place accessibility.  In\naddition, Mr. Lee testified as to the Commonwealth’s oversight of and interactions with the\nPhiladelphia Board of Elections concerning accessibility of the City’s polling places.  This\n19\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 22 of 28\ninformation provided Plaintiffs with sufficient knowledge of the Commonwealth Defendants’\nactions and inactions to form a basis to judge their probable liability.  Meek Decl. ¶ 3.\nIn addition to the formal and informal discovery, the breadth and complexity of many of\nthe factual and legal issues in this case had already been explored by the time the parties\nfinalized the Agreement through the City Defendants’ and Commonwealth Defendants’ motions\nto dismiss, the City Defendants’ summary judgment motion, and extensive settlement discussions\nwith opposing counsel and Magistrate Judge Rice.  This further afforded the Plaintiffs an\nopportunity to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of their case.  Meek  Decl. ¶¶ 4, 8;\nsee also Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 332-33.\n4.  Risks of Establishing Liability\n“By evaluating the risks of establishing liability, the district court can examine what the\npotential rewards (or downside) of litigation might have been had class counsel elected to litigate\nthe claims rather than settle them.”  GMC, 55 F.3d at 814; accord Bradburn Parent Teacher\nStore, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 332.  In considering this factor, “the court should avoid con-\nducting a mini-trial.  Rather, the court should give credence to the estimation of the probability\nof success proffered by class counsel, who are experienced with the underlying case, and the\npossible defenses which may be raised to their causes of action.”  Id.; accord Parks v. Portnoff\nLaw Assoc., 243 F. Supp.2d at 251.\nAlthough Plaintiffs were confident that they would prevail at trial, this case was not\nwholly devoid of risk.  As noted above and as reflected in the extensive motions practice, this\ncase presents vigorously contested factual and legal issues.  Plaintiffs succeeded in persuading\nthe Court that most of the City Defendants’ substantive legal arguments lacked merit.  However,\n20\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 23 of 28\nthe novelty of the issues certainly raised the specter that those same legal challenges, which\ninvolved matters of first impression in this Circuit, could conceivably succeed on appeal.  In\naddition, the court had not yet ruled on the merits of the Commonwealth Defendants’ legal\nchallenges, which also involved questions of first impression.  Accordingly, these risks of\nestablishing liability weigh in favor of approval of the Agreement.  Cf. Lan v. Ludrof, Civil\nAction No. 1:006-cv-114-SJM, 2008 WL 763763 at *14 (W.D. Pa. Mar. 21, 2008) (“unsettled\nstate of the law makes this case one where there could be no reasonable certainty, from\nPlaintiffs’ viewpoint, that establishing liability is more likely than not”); Parks v. Portnoff Law\nAssoc., 243 F. Supp.2d at 251-52 (existence of difficult legal issues weighs in favor of\nsettlement).\n5.  Risks of Establishing Damages/Securing Relief\nLike the inquiry into the risks of establishing liability, the inquiry into the risks of\nestablishing damages “‘attempts to measure the expected value of litigating the action rather than\nsettling it at the current time.’”  Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 332.\nAlthough Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief (not damages) and are confident that the Court would\nhave enjoined the Defendants from violating the ADA, RA, and VAEH, the specific contours\nof the injunctive relief that the Court might have granted are far less clear.  The court could\nconceivably have declined to craft a detailed order that required the Defendants to take specific\nsteps necessary to achieve compliance with the ADA, RA, and VAEH.  Instead, the court could\nhave given the Defendants leeway as to how they would come into compliance.  Thus, Plaintiffs\nin this case had to consider the risk that they would not be able to secure greater relief than that\nwhich is afforded by the Agreement.\n21\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 24 of 28\nThe Agreement provides Plaintiffs with much of the relief they sought -- (a) independent\nsurveys of all Philadelphia polling places that comprehensively assess the accessibility of polling\nsites; (b) a neutral process for the Plaintiffs to challenge most decisions by the City Defendants\nnot to implement the independent surveyors’ recommendations; and (c) an agreement by the City\nDefendants to make modifications recommended made by the surveyors or, if challenged by the\nCity Defendants, to make any modifications required by the Magistrate and Court.  Moreover,\nthe City Defendants will begin to implement the Agreement quickly, thus affording Plaintiffs and\nclass members relief far sooner than any relief they might secure following further litigation in\nthis Court and subsequent appeals that could take several more years.  Accordingly, the benefits\nafforded by the Agreement far outweigh the potential risks of seeking further relief through\ncontinued litigation.\n6.  Risks of Maintaining Class Action Status\n“This factor allows the Court to weigh the possibility that, if a class were certified for trial\nin this case, it would be decertified prior to trial.”  Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F.\nSupp. 2d at 333.  In this case, the City Defendants raised a number of challenges to class\ncertification.  Although it is unlikely that the Court would reconsider the matter and decertify\nthe case prior to trial, it is conceivable that the City Defendants might pursue their certification\nchallenges on appeal.  Since the risk of decertification, however small, was eliminated through\nthe Agreement, this factor also favors the approval.  See In re Aetna Inc. Securities Litig., 2001\nWL 20928 at *8; see also Bradburn Parent Teacher Store, Inc., 513 F. Supp. 2d at 333.\n22\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 25 of 28\n7.  Defendants’ Ability to Withstand A Greater Judgment\nThe Agreement does not involve payment of monetary damages and, indeed, Plaintiffs\nnever sought damages.  However, the Agreement does require both the City Defendants and\nCommonwealth Defendants to fund certain aspects of relief.  The Commonwealth Defendants\nwill pay up to $350,000 and the City Defendants will pay up to $400,000.  The Agreement\nconfers cost savings on the Defendants by having DOJ conduct many of the polling place\nsurveys.  Given that both the City and the Commonwealth are currently subject to budgetary\nconstraints, this factor, too, weighs in favor of the Agreement.\n8.  Range of Reasonableness In Light of the\nBest Possible Recovery and the Risks of Litigation\nThe determination of a “reasonable” settlement is not susceptible to a mathematical\nequation yielding a particularized sum.  As Chief Judge Friendly explained:  “[T]here is a range\nof reasonableness with respect to a settlement ....”  Newman v. Stein, 464 F.2d 689, 693 (2d Cir.),\ncert. denied, 409 U.S. 1039 (1972).  Assessing the value of a settlement and the “best possible\nrecovery” is particularly difficult in a case seeking injunctive, rather than monetary relief.  Here,\nhowever, there can be little doubt that the Agreement provides significant, tangible benefits to\nclass members.\nThe benefits conferred by the Agreement compare quite favorably to the best possible\nrecovery that Plaintiffs could have secured and fall well within the range of  reasonableness.  The\nAgreement provides the Plaintiffs with almost all of the relief that they ultimately could have\nsecured if they prevailed at the hearing and following appeals and if the Court, using its discre-\ntion to shape injunctive relief, afforded the Plaintiffs all of the relief they had sought.  All of the\n23\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 26 of 28\napproximately 1,100 Philadelphia polling places will be subject to extensive accessibility\nevaluations by qualified, independent surveyors.  For polling places found to be inaccessible, the\nsurveyors will, if possible, provide specific recommendations to either make the facilities\naccessible or to identify specific accessible sites to which they can feasibly be relocated.  If the\nCity Defendants (through the Board of Elections) refuse to implement the recommendations\n(subject to certain exceptions), the Plaintiffs can request that the Magistrate Judge decide\nwhether implementation of the recommendation would be reasonable or a fundamental alteration\nand either party can appeal an adverse decision by the Magistrate Judge to this Court.  The\nAgreement also includes provisions to assure that new polling places selected by the City\nDefendants generally will be accessible and, if not, includes procedures that allow Plaintiffs to\nchallenge their selection.  As a whole, these provisions will assure that the City Defendants use\npolling places that are accessible except in those instances when doing so would result in a\nfundamental alteration.\nThe benefits of the Agreement are particularly favorable in light of the attendant risks of\nlitigation.  Plaintiffs recognize that this case presents novel and complex questions of law.  While\nthis Court’s summary judgment ruling interpreted the law in a manner that was favorable to the\nPlaintiffs, it is not inconceivable that appellate courts might have reached contrary conclusions.\nAside from the risks on the merits, perhaps the key risk of litigation in this case simply was the\ndelay that would inevitably result from further litigation in this court and the appellate courts.\nSince this lawsuit was filed, more than four elections have been conducted with no relief.  The\nsooner that the process created by the Agreement is implemented, the sooner that more\nPhiladelphians with mobility impairments will have the opportunity to vote in accessible polling\n24\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 129   Filed 07/02/09   Page 27 of 28\nplaces like their non-disabled friends and neighbors.  The risks of continued litigation --\nincluding the possibility of adverse legal rulings and years of delay -- add to the reasonableness\nof the Agreement and weigh in favor of its approval.  See Parks v. Portnoff Law Assoc., 243 F.\nSupp.2d at 253.\nCONCLUSION\nSince all of the relevant factors weigh in favor of the Agreement as set forth above,\nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court approve the Settlement Agreement, dismiss the\nAmended Complaint with prejudice, and retain jurisdiction over the Agreement for purposes of\ninterpretation and enforcement.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDated:  July 2, 2009 By: /s/ Robert W.

August 14, 2008\nPlaintiffs, individuals with mobility disabilities who are registered to vote in the City of\nPhiladelphia, have brought this action against the Philadelphia Board of Elections1 and the\nCommissioners of the City of Philadelphia in charge of elections, alleging that Defendants have\nviolated their civil rights under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. § 12132, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the “RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), by\ndenying them equal and integrated access to neighborhood polling places in Philadelphia.  Before\nthe Court is Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment. For the reasons that follow, the Motion\nis granted in part and denied in part.\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nPhiladelphia is divided into 66 wards with a total of 1,681 polling divisions.  (Def. Statement\nof Undisputed Facts ¶¶ 1, 2; Pl. Resp. ¶¶ 1, 2; Pl. Ex. 3.)   The divisions are selected by the\nPhiladelphia Board of Elections (the “Board”) and the individual City Commissioners.  25 Pa. Stat.\nAnn. § 2726(a).  The polling place for a division must be located in the division or in an adjacent\ndivision.  25 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 2727(a).  \n1The Philadelphia Board of Elections was incorrectly designated as the “Philadelphia Board\nof Election” in the Complaint.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 2 of 55\nRobert Lee, Voter Registration Administrator for the Board, estimates that there are between\n1,000 and 1,200 polling places in Philadelphia.  (Lee Decl. ¶ 1; Lee Dep. at 38-39.)  There are fewer\npolling places than polling divisions because two or more polling divisions may be assigned to the\nsame polling place.  (Lee Dep. at 38.)  Defendants assign each registered voter to a specific division\nnear his or her home.  (Compl. ¶ 23; Defs. Ans. ¶ 23.)  Registered voters are required to vote in the\npolling places to which they are assigned, unless they vote by alternative or absentee ballot or at City\nHall on election day.  Dept. of State, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Procedures to Assure\nCompliance with the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act and Other Laws\nAssuring the Voting Rights of Individuals with Disabilities and Language Needs (“Pa. Voting\nAccessibility Procedures”) §§ 4(b), 6, 8 and 9, available at http://www.hava.state.pa.us/hava/lib/hava\n/095policiesandprocedures/vaa_policy.pdf (last visited 6/6/08).  Many of the polling places are\nlocated in facilities owned by private parties or by public entities other than the City of Philadelphia.\n(Pl. Ex. 3.) \nThe Board has received, through the state, approximately $11 million in federal money\npursuant to the Help America Vote Act (“HAVA”), 42 U.S.C. § 15301, et seq., to address voting\naccessibility issues.  (Lee Dep. at 83-86.)  The bulk of that money has been allocated for voting\nsystems.  (Id. at 85.)  Approximately $1.4 million has been designated for polling place accessibility.\n(Id. at 86.)  Philadelphia has used about $60,800 of that money so far.  (Id. at 85-86.)  The Board\nintends to use some of the remaining money to reimburse the Philadelphia school system for making\naccessibility modifications to schools used as polling places and has considered using some of the\nmoney to make private properties used as polling places accessible.  (Id. at 87-88.)  The Board has\nalso committed to use $580,000 to modify city owned facilities, mostly recreation centers and a few\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 3 of 55\nlibraries, to make them accessible.  (Id. at 88-89.)\nA. Pennsylvania’s Voting Accessibility Procedures\nUnder the Voter Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (“VAEH”), 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1973ee-1, et seq., the Secretary of the Commonwealth is required to establish guidelines for the\naccessibility of polling locations, defining what is accessible, determining what alternative voting\nmethods are allowable, and assuring that those methods are in place.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1973ee-1,\n1973ee-6(1).  According to the VAEH and the Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures, county boards\nof elections “are required to ‘assure that all polling places for Federal elections are accessible to\nhandicapped and elderly voters.’”  Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 1(c)(1) (quoting 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1973ee-1(a)).  There are limited exceptions to this requirement: (1) when the “Secretary of the\nCommonwealth has determined that an emergency exists such that the county board of elections\ncannot reasonably provide an accessible polling place for one or more election districts” and (2)\nwhere the Secretary of the Commonwealth has determined that no accessible polling place is\navailable and has assured that any handicapped or elderly voter assigned to an inaccessible polling\nplace will be assigned to an accessible polling place or provided with an alternative means for\ncasting a ballot on the day of the election.  Id. § 1(c)(2).   \nThe Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures state that the Secretary of the Commonwealth:\nperiodically directs the county boards of elections to conduct a survey\nof their polling places to determine the accessibility of the polling\nplaces  under  guidelines  issued  by  the  Secretary  of  the\nCommonwealth, and to make good faith efforts on an ongoing basis\nto identify accessible polling places (or polling places that can be\nmade accessible for voting on Election Day) for each election district\nin the county.\nId. § 3(a).  The Board conducted an accessibility assessment of all polling locations in the spring of\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 4 of 55\n2002 and, in the summer of 2006, evaluated 596 divisions with inaccessible polling locations to\ndetermine if those polling places could be modified to be accessible or relocated to an accessible\nfacility.  (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 22-23.)  In the summer of 2007, the Board evaluated an additional 225\ndivisions with inaccessible polling locations to determine if those polling locations could be\nmodified to be accessible or relocated to an accessible facility.  (Id. ¶ 25.)  The Board also conducts\na thorough search for an accessible location each time a new polling place location must be selected.\n(Lee Decl. ¶¶ 9-15.)  During the summer of 2004, the Board submitted a state accessibility survey\nform for each polling location to the Secretary of the Commonwealth using the information gathered\nin the spring of 2002.  (Id. ¶ 5.)  Every June, the Board sends the Secretary of the Commonwealth\ncopies of the state accessibility survey forms for each new or relocated polling place.  (Id. ¶ 6.) \nB. The Alternative Ballot\nThe Secretary of the Commonwealth has implemented an alternative balloting procedure to\nensure “that any handicapped or elderly voter assigned to a polling place deemed inaccessible by the\ncounty board of elections would have another means to cast a ballot on or before Election Day.”  Pa.\nVoting Accessibility Procedures § 4(a).  These procedures apply to state as well as federal elections.\nId. § 2.  These procedures are the sole means for casting a ballot through alternative methods in\nPennsylvania.  Id. § 4(c).  \nA polling place is deemed inaccessible for the purpose of voting by alternative ballot if it\ndoes not meet all federal and state criteria for a fully accessible building and handicapped parking.\n(Pl. Ex. 29.)  Registered voters may not vote by alternative ballot if they are assigned to accessible\npolling places. Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 4(d).  Philadelphia voters may request\nalternative ballot applications in person at City Hall or over the phone.  (Pl. Ex. 29.)  \n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 5 of 55\nQualified voters who are unable, because of a permanent or temporary disability, to vote in\ntheir assigned polling place may vote by absentee ballot even if they have been assigned to an\naccessible polling place.  Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 5(a).  Applications for absentee or\nalternative ballots, except for emergency applications, must be submitted at least 7 days before the\nelection day.  Id. § 8(d)(1).  Applicants must complete an Absentee/Alternative Ballot application\nform in order to vote by alternative or absentee ballot.  (Lee Decl. ¶ 40, Ex. 3; Lee Dep. at 282-84.)\nA voter who requests an absentee ballot because of illness or disability, or who requests an\nalternative ballot because he or she is handicapped or age 65 or older and has been assigned to an\ninaccessible polling place, is required to fill out section C of the application, which requires that\nindividual to describe the nature of his or her disability.  (Lee Decl., Ex. 3 at 2.)  Section C also\nrequires disclosure of the name of the voter’s physician and the physician’s address and phone\nnumber.2   (Id.)  \nIn Philadelphia, alternative ballots must be returned to City Hall by 8:00 p.m. on election day.\n(Lee Dep. at 303, Lee Decl. Ex. 3 at 2.)  The voter can mail the ballot in advance, or deliver it in\nperson on election day.  (Id.)  Approximately 2,000 alternative ballots were cast in the April 22, 2008\nprimary election.  (Id. at 286.)  It is not known how may of these alternative ballots were cast by\ndisabled voters.  (Id.)\nIn an emergency, such as when a disabled voter learns after the application deadline that he\nor she has been assigned to an inaccessible polling place, the disabled voter may make an Emergency\n2 The check-off box for handicapped or age 65 or older contains the additional instruction\nthat voters should sign Section C, and that no other information is required of that voter in Section\nC.  (Lee Decl., Ex. 3 at 2.)  This instruction directly contradicts the general instructions for filling\nout the application.  (Id.)\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 6 of 55\nApplication for Alternative Ballot at any time until the polls close on election day.  Pa. Voting\nAccessibility Procedures § 8(d)(2).  An applicant for an emergency alternative ballot must satisfy\nall of the requirements for eligibility to vote by alternative ballot, including the requirement that the\nvoter be assigned to a polling place which has been designated by Defendants as inaccessible.  Id.\n§ 8(d)(2).3   The emergency alternative ballot application may only be obtained at City Hall and\nrequires applicants to describe the nature of their disability.  (Lee Dep. at 316-17, Pl. Ex. 27.)  The\nvoter may use a designated agent to pick up and return the emergency application for alternative\nballot.  (Lee Dep. at 319.)  A voter using a designated agent must also complete and submit an agent\ndelivery form.  (Id.)  \nDefendants have created a poster which contains information regarding emergency alternative\nballots that is supposed to be posted inside and outside of polling places on election day.  (Lee Dep.\nat 318; Pl. Ex. 29.)  Consequently, if a mobility disabled voter arrives at his or her polling location\nand discovers that it is not accessible, the poster should inform that voter about the emergency\nalternative ballot.  (Lee Dep. at 315-17.)  This information is also available on the Board’s website.\n(Id.)  The poster was not posted outside of all polling places on April 22, 2008.  (Supp. Resnick\nDecl. ¶ 35, Turner Decl. ¶ 26, Suppl. Salandra Decl. ¶ 25, Suppl. Kane Decl. ¶ 17.)\nC. Polling place accessibility designations\nPrior to each scheduled election day, Defendants publish a notice in local newspapers that\n3In contrast, a person with disabilities may also vote by absentee ballot “[i]rrespective of the\naccessibility of a qualified elector’s polling place . . . .”  Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 5(a).\nHowever, the last time such a voter may make an emergency application for  absentee ballot is 5 p.m.\nthe Friday before Election Day.  Id. § 5(d)(1).  An eligible voter who is unable to do so, “may apply\nto the Court of Common Pleas for an order directing the county board of elections to issue an\nabsentee ballot to the elector . . . .”  Id. § 5(d)(2).  \n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 7 of 55\nlists the polling place location for each division (the “Notice”).4  See 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 2726(c).\nThe Board uses the following designations to describe the accessibility of a polling place: \nFH = Fully Accessible for disabled; designated parking for disabled\nBL/RL = Building substantially Accessible for Disabled with minor\nassistance, Passenger Loading Zone\nBN/RN = Building substantially Accessible for disabled with minor\nassistance, No Parking\nAL  =  Building  Accessible  by  Alternative  entrance,  Passenger\nLoading Zone, Call 215-686-1523\nAN = Building Accessible by Alternative entrance, No Parking, Call\n215-686-1523\nNL = Building Inaccessible, Passenger Loading Zone\nNN = Building Inaccessible for disabled, No Parking\n(Pl. Ex. 3; Lee Dep. at 224-27.)   The first letter of the designation refers to the accessibility of the\nbuilding, the second letter to the accessibility of the parking.  (Lee Dep. at 230.)  The Board’s\naccessibility designations are based on information derived from the Board’s accessibility surveys\nof polling places, using standards established by the Pennsylvania Department of State.  (Lee Dep.\nat 227-28, 229.)  Pennsylvania’s accessibility standards include the following criteria: the pathway\nmust be free of steps from the parking space for the disabled voter to the accessible entrance to the\npolling place; all ramps, with the exception of curb ramps, must have handrails; it must be possible\nto approach and enter the building, reach the voting room, vote and leave the building without\nclimbing one or more stairs; thresholds or doorsills must be ½ inch or less in height; and clearances\nthrough doorways used by the disabled voter must be at least 32 inches wide.5  (Lee Dep. at 48, Pl.\n4Pl. Ex. 3 is the Notice for the April 22, 2008 primary election.  The Notice for the November\n6, 2007 general election is Ex. A to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Permanent Injunction.\n5These standards are less specific than standards developed by the Department of Justice\n(“DOJ”) for ADA compliance, but contain many of the same elements.  Compare Guidelines and\nDefinitions Issued by the Secretary of the Commonwealth For the Implementation of the Federal\nVoting  Accessibility  for  the  Elderly  and  Handicapped  Act  (P.L.  98-435),  available  at\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 8 of 55\nEx. 5.)  \nFor the April 22, 2008 primary election, Philadelphia had 110 polling divisions that were\nlocated in facilities that were fully accessible under Pennsylvania’s accessibility standards, these\ndivisions were designated by Defendants as “FH.”  (Lee Dep. at 47-48; Pl. Ex. 4.)  Defendants use\nthe designations NN or NL to denote polling divisions located in buildings that are inaccessible.\n(Lee Dep. at 226-27.)  According to Robert Lee, the City presently has 224 inaccessible polling\ndivisions.  (Suppl. Lee Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. 1.)  \nIf a polling place does not fully meet federal and state criteria for accessibility, but provides\nrelative accessibility with minor assistance in entry, the Board designates it with a “B.”  (Pl. Ex. 29,\nLee Dep. at 225.)  Defendants use the designations BN and BL to denote polling divisions which are\nlocated in facilities that are substantially accessible and do not have steps, but which do not comply\nwith Pennsylvania’s accessibility standards for the following reasons:  the doors are too heavy; the\ndoor hardware is not accessible; there is a threshold or doorsill in excess of ½ inch but no greater\nthan one inch high; individuals might need assistance to traverse the ramp; the door is less than 32\ninches wide; or the parking does not meet Pennsylvania’s accessibility standards.  (Lee Dep. at 80-\n81, 236, 241, 271, 277-78.)  The Board has designated 1130 polling divisions as BN or BL.  (Pl. Ex.\n4.)  Defendants use the designations RN and RL to denote polling divisions that are located in\nfacilities that are substantially accessible and for which Defendants provide portable ramps.  (Lee\nDep. at 81-82, 233-35.)   Polling place officials are instructed to install the ramps when they open\nthe polls.  (Id.  at 242.) The Board has designated 80 polling divisions as RN or RL.  (Pl. Ex. 4.)  \nhttp://www.hava.state.pa.us/hava/cwp/view.asp?a=1227&Q=444671&havaNav=|  (last  visited\n7/22/08)  with  DOJ  Checklist  for  Polling  Places  (Feb.  2004),  available  at\nhttp://www.ada.gov/votingchecklist.htm.\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 9 of 55\nThe designations AL and AN are used to denote polling divisions that are located in facilities\nwith inaccessible primary entrances (two or more steps), but other entrances that are accessible.  (Lee\nDep. at 244.)  The Board has designated 145 polling divisions as AL or AN.  (Pl. Ex. 4.)  Defendants\npost signs indicating the availability of an alternative accessible entrance outside polling places that\nhave been designated as AL or AN.  (Lee Dep. at 246-47.)  Board employees write specific\ndirections to the alternative entrance on the bottom of each sign.  (Lee Dep. at 247.)   The signs are\nplaced near the inaccessible main entrance to the polling location on the Saturday and Sunday\npreceding the election.  (Lee Dep. at 247, Pl. Ex. 6.)  The Board does not require that the alternative\nentrance be unlocked on election day.  (Lee Dep. at 248-49.)  The Department of Justice (“DOJ”)\nmandates, however, that alternative accessible entrances to polling places “must remain open when\nthe polling place is open.”  DOJ Checklist for Polling Places (Feb. 2004) at 19, available at\nhttp://www.ada.gov/votingchecklist.htm.  \nBetween November 2007 and April 2008, Defendants reviewed every polling place for\naccessibility designation.  (Lee Dep. at 28-29.)  Despite this effort, Plaintiffs have found that those\ndesignations were incorrect in connection with 32 polling places.  After Plaintiffs filed their Motion\nfor a Permanent Injunction in January 2008, Defendants changed the accessibility designations for\n22 polling places that Plaintiffs identified in their Motion as being improperly designated.  (Pl. Mot.\nfor Perm. Inj. at 4-10; Pl. Ex. 3.).  Plaintiffs have submitted evidence that the following ten polling\ndivisions are still incorrectly designated:  Ward 5/Div. 19;  Ward 21/Div. 1;  Ward 24/Div. 4; Ward\n24/Div. 15; Ward 31/Div. 15; Ward 32/Div. 1; Ward 32/Div. 9; Ward 34/Div. 5; Ward 50/Div. 9;\nWard 65/Div. 21.

(Meek Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  Two hundred and ten of those polling places had been\ndesignated in the Notice for the April 22, 2008 primary election as accessible (FH, BL, BN, RN, RL,\nAL or AN).  (Pl.

Polling place relocation\nVoters may request that a polling place be moved by submitting a petition from 10 qualified\nvoters to the Board.  25 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 2726(a).  Even without requests, the Board’s staff\nperiodically recommends that polling places should be relocated from inaccessible to accessible\nlocations.  (Lee Dep. at 110-11.)    Recommendations for changes in polling place locations must\nbe submitted to the City Commissioners for approval.  (Id. at 111.)  \ndivisions were also found to be inaccessible by Plaintiffs on November 6, 2007: Ward 2/Div. 25;\nWard 3/Div. 7; Ward 22/Divs. 18, 19; Ward 41/Divs., 13, 14; Ward 41/Div. 19; Ward 53/Div. 18;\nand Ward 61/Divs. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8.\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 12 of 55\nThe Board’s staff considers the following criteria in determining whether to recommend a\nchange in a polling location to the City Commissioners:  (1) the proposed location must be\naccessible; (2) the proposed location must be in the same, or an adjacent, division; (3) the distance\nfrom the farthest edge of the division to the proposed new polling location cannot be more than five\nblocks; (4) there must be no physical barriers between the current location and the proposed location\n(such as major highways, rivers, creeks, parks, industrial/commercial areas, or four-lane streets,\nregardless of whether there are traffic lights or whether people routinely cross at those intersections);\nand (5) there must be sufficient room at the proposed location to accommodate the polling division.\n(Lee Dep. at 120-27, 129; Pl. Ex. 18.)  These criteria were developed by Board staff and are not\nrequired by state law.  (Lee Dep. at 124, 126.)  If these criteria are met, Board staff will conclude that\nrelocation of the polling place would be feasible and not unduly burdensome for voters and will\nrecommend that the City Commissioners hold a hearing on the proposed change.  (Id. at 122.)  \nThe City Commissioners hold hearings prior to each election to consider changes to polling\nplace locations.  (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 18-21.)  The City Commissioners consider accessibility and the\nimpact of the proposed location on other (non-disabled) voters, when they decide which location to\nuse.  (Id. ¶ 21.)  Prior to a hearing, the City Commissioners notify the affected Ward leaders and post\nhearing notices in five locations (the current polling location, the proposed polling location, and\nthree other locations within the division) (Lee Dep. at 114.)   The hearings are recorded by a\nstenographer.  (Id. at 152.)  Witnesses do not testify under oath.  (Id.)  Ward leaders and committee\npeople attend the hearings and are asked whether they agree or disagree with the proposed relocation.\n(Id. at 153-54.)

(Pl. Ex. 20;\n9/27/06 Hr., N.T. at 59; Pl. Ex. 24; Pl. Ex. 25.)  Hearings were held with respect to 23 of these\nproposals, and the Commissioners denied all 23 of the proposed relocations.8  Twelve relocation\nproposals were rejected based on representations that the current facilities had, or would obtain\nramps.  Those facilities were, however, still inaccessible during the April 22, 2008 primary election.\nEight relocation proposals were denied based upon representations that elderly voters had, or would,\nobject to the relocation and/or because the new location was too far away.9  One other proposed\nrelocation was denied for safety reasons and another was rejected because the proposed new location\nwas overcrowded. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\n8We have summarized the evidence submitted by the parties with respect to these proposed\npolling place relocations in Appendix C hereto.\n9There was testimony presented at the City Commissioner’s hearings that two of those polling\nplaces, Ward 39/Divs. 3, 20 (one polling place) and Ward 39/Div. 33, were to receive ramps that\nwould make them accessible.  (9/27/06 Hrg., Tr. at 89-93, 10/3/07 Hrg., Tr. at 48-50.) Those polling\nplaces are still inaccessible.  (Pl.

A factual dispute\nis “material” if it might affect the outcome of the case under governing law.  Id.\n“A party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the\ndistrict court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the [record] which it\nbelieves demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\nU.S. 317, 323 (1986).

Plaintiffs’ Claims\nPlaintiffs’ claims arise under Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and §504 of the RA,\n29 U.S.C. § 794.  Title II of the ADA provides that: “no qualified individual with a disability shall,\nby reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the\nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\nentity.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132.  The RA provides, in pertinent part, that:  “[n]o otherwise qualified\nindividual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\nany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).  \nPlaintiffs make seven specific claims of discrimination pursuant to the ADA and RA.  In their\nfirst claim, Plaintiffs contend that, by failing to assure the accessibility of all of their polling places\nthat can be made accessible, Defendants have excluded them from participation in, or denied them\nthe benefits of, their program of voting in the manner that is available to non-disabled people, in\nviolation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794\nand 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(a).10   In their second claim, Plaintiffs assert that, by failing to assure that all\n1028 C.F.R. § 35.130(a) provides that:  “[n]o qualified individual with a disability shall, on\nthe basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.”  28\nC.F. R. § 41.51(a) similarly provides that “[n]o qualified handicapped person, shall, on the basis of\nhandicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity that receives or benefits from federal financial\nassistance.”  These regulations, which were developed by the DOJ to implement the ADA and RA,\n“are given controlling weight, ‘[u]nless the regulations are arbitrary, capricious or manifestly\ncontrary to the statute.’”  Liberty Res., Inc. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 528 F. Supp. 2d 553, 564 n.17\n(E.D. Pa. 2007) (quoting Helen L. v.

Welfare, 1 F. Supp. 2d 456, 463 (E.D. Pa. 1998) (citing 28 C.F.R. §\n35.130(b)(1)(ii) and Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301 (1985)). \n1228 C.F.R. § 130(b)(4) and 28 C.F.R. § 45.51(b)(4) provide that a public entity (or, under\nthe RA, an entity that receives federal financial assistance) may not select a site or location for a\nfacility that (1) effectively excludes persons with disabilities, denies them the benefits of the entity’s\nprogram, or otherwise subjects them to discrimination or (2) has the “purpose or effect of defeating\nor substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the service, program, or activity\nwith respect to” disabled persons.  See 28 C.F.R. § 130(b)(4) and 28 C.F.R. § 45.51(b)(4). \n1328 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3) and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3) provide that a public entity (or, under\nthe RA, an entity that receives federal financial assistance) may not utilize methods of administration\nthat (1) subject disabled individuals “to discrimination on the basis of disability” or (2) have  the\n“purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives” of\n16\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 17 of 55\nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794, by failing to\nmake reasonable modifications in their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination.14\nIn their sixth claim, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants have violated the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132\nand 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d), by failing to\nprovide services in the most integrated setting possible.15  In their seventh claim, Plaintiffs contend\nthat Defendants have violated the ADA’s and RA’s program accessibility mandate, 42 U.S.C. §\n12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.150, and 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.57, by failing to assure that\nthe City’s program of voting is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.16\nthe program or activity with respect to individuals with disabilities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 130(b)(3) and\n28 C.F.R. § 45.51(b)(3).\n1428 C.F.R. § 130(b)(7) provides that “[a] public entity shall make reasonable modifications\nin policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination\non the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications\nwould fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.”  The RA has also been\ninterpreted to require a recipient of federal financial assistance to make reasonable modifications.\nSee Alexander, 469 U.S. at 301 n.21.\n15The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has explained that the integration\nmandate requires a public entity (or recipient of federal financial assistance) to:\n“administer services, programs, and activities in the most integrated\nsetting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of  qualified  individuals  with\ndisabilities.”  28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (implementing the ADA’s\nintegration  requirement);  see  also  28  C.F.R.  §  41.51(d)\n(implementing  the  RA’s  integration  requirement).  “[T]he  most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals\nwith  disabilities”  is  a  setting  that  “enables  individuals  with\ndisabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent\npossible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35 app. A. \nPennsylvania Protection and Advocacy, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Dep’t of Pub. Welfare,  402 F.3d 374,\n379 (3d Cir. 2005).\n16The ADA’s and RA’s program accessibility mandate states, generally, that “[a] public entity\nshall operate each service, program, or activity so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed\nin its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.”  28 C.F.R. §\n17\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 18 of 55\nB. Legal Standard For Proof of a Claim Under Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the RA\nWe apply a burden shifting analysis to claims of discrimination brought pursuant to Title II\nof the ADA and § 504 of the RA.  We first determine whether a plaintiff has satisfied his or her\nburden of making a prima facie showing of discrimination:\nWhen analyzing whether a violation of either Title II or Section 504\nhas  occurred,  the  first  step  a  court  must  take  in  a  disability\ndiscrimination case is to determine if there is a prima facie showing\nof discrimination.  In order to establish a prima facie showing of\ndisability discrimination under the RA, the plaintiff bears the burden\nof proving that 1) he or she is a “handicapped individual,” 2) he or\nshe is “otherwise qualified” for participation in the program, 3) the\nprogram receives “federal financial assistance,” and 4) he or she was\n“denied the benefits of” or “subject to discrimination” under the\nprogram.  Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, 926 F.2d\n1368, 1380 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting Strathie v. Department of Transp.,\n716 F.2d 227, 230 (3d Cir. 1983)). Similarly, under Title II of the\nADA a plaintiff must establish that 1) he or she has a disability; 2) he\nor she is otherwise qualified; and 3) he or she is being excluded from\nparticipation in, being denied the benefits of, or being subjected to\ndiscrimination under the program solely because of her disability.\nJones v. City of Monroe, 341 F.3d 474, 477 (6th Cir. 2003); Henrietta\nD. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 272 (2d Cir. 2003).\nLiberty Res., Inc. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 528 F. Supp. 2d 553, 565 (E.D. Pa. 2007).  If Plaintiffs are\nable to make a prima facie showing of discrimination in violation of the ADA and RA, they have the\nadditional burden “of articulating reasonable accommodations that the defendant can make in order\nto comply with the ADA and the RA.”  Id. (citing Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare of\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, 364 F.3d 487, 492 n.4 (3d Cir. 2004)).  If the plaintiff is able to\narticulate reasonable accommodations, the burden “shifts to the defendant to make any reasonable\naccommodations, unless the defendant can prove that the accommodations would be unduly\n35.150(a); see also 28 C.F.R. § 41.57(a). \n18\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 19 of 55\nburdensome or fundamentally alter the program.”  Id. (citing Frederick L. at 487, 492 n.4 and\nNathanson at 1384). \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to the entry of summary judgment in their favor\nbecause Plaintiffs have failed to come forward with evidence sufficient to set forth a prima facie case\nof discrimination under the ADA or RA and to articulate specific reasonable modifications to the\nCity’s program of voting which will bring it into compliance with the ADA and RA.  They also\nargue that their program of voting satisfies the VAEH, which, they claim, takes precedence over the\nADA.  Defendants further argue that this action should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed\nto join indispensable parties to this action, namely the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the\nowners of the private properties used by the City as polling locations; and that the Board and City\nCommissioners should be dismissed because they are not the proper defendants to this suit.\nC. Prima Facie Case of Discrimination\nDefendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiffs cannot\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and RA.17  Defendants do not challenge\nthe first two elements of a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and RA, that Plaintiffs\nare disabled and otherwise qualified to participate in Defendant’s program of voting.  They also\ndon’t challenge the requirement for a claim under the RA that their program of voting receives\n17Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination in\nconnection with their program access claims, claims 1, 2, 7; discriminatory site selection claim,\nclaim 3; and integration mandate claim, claim 6.  Defendants do not specifically address Plaintiffs’\ndiscriminatory methods of administration claim, claim 4, or Plaintiffs’ reasonable modifications\nclaim, claim 5.  Defendants do, however, argue that, if Plaintiffs are able to establish a prima facie\ncase of discrimination, they have failed to meet their burden of coming forward with reasonable\nmodifications.  Consequently, we address Plaintiffs’ burden with respect to the existence of\nreasonable modifications in connection with that argument, in section D, below, rather than in the\ncontext of Plaintiffs’ prima facie claims of discrimination.\n19\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 20 of 55\nfederal financial assistance.  They challenge only the remaining element, that Plaintiffs are being\nexcluded from participation in, being denied the benefits of, or being subjected to discrimination\nunder, the City’s program of voting solely because of their disabilities.\n1. Defendants’ program of voting\nDefendants argue that Philadelphia’s program of voting (when viewed as a whole) meets the\nrequirements of the  ADA and RA because at least three-quarters of the City’s polling locations are\naccessible and voters with mobility disabilities can vote through alternative and absentee ballots and\nemergency alternative ballots either at home or at City Hall.  Plaintiffs, however, contend that each\nof Defendants’ polling locations constitutes a separate program of voting pursuant to the ADA and\nRA and, accordingly, each must separately satisfy the accessibility requirements of the ADA and the\nRA.  Consequently, before we can determine whether the City’s program of voting violates the ADA\nand RA, we must decide whether the program of voting encompasses voting city-wide, including\nabsentee and alternative ballots, or whether each of the City’s polling locations constitutes a separate\nprogram.\nDefendants maintain that their program of voting, for purposes of the ADA and RA,\nencompasses all of their voting processes and procedures, city-wide, because they are not required\nto make each of their existing facilities accessible.  The ADA’s regulations regarding program\naccessibility do not “[n]ecessarily require a public entity to make each of its existing facilities\naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities . . . .”  28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(1).  In addition,\nthe DOJ’s Americans with Disabilities Act, Title II Technical Assistance Manual, (1993) (“Technical\nAssistance Manual”), available at http://www.ada.gov/taman2.html, similarly states that program\naccessibility does not necessarily require that a public entity make all of its existing facilities\n20\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 21 of 55\naccessible:\nA public entity may not deny the benefits of its programs, activities,\nand services to individuals with disabilities because its facilities are\ninaccessible. A public entity’s services, programs, or activities, when\nviewed in their entirety, must be readily accessible to and usable by\nindividuals with disabilities. This standard, known as “program\naccessibility,” applies to all existing facilities of a public entity.\nPublic entities, however, are not necessarily required to make each of\ntheir existing facilities accessible. \nTechnical Assistance Manual § II-5.1000.  The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\nhas explained that “Title II’s emphasis on ‘program accessibility’ rather than ‘facilities accessibility’\nwas intended to ensure broad access to public services, while, at the same time, providing public\nentities with the flexibility to choose how best to make access available.”  Parker v. Universidad de\nPuerto Rico, 225 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).  Therefore, as the United States Court\nof Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has instructed, “when determining the compliance of existing\nfacilities with the ADA under program accessibility, courts must look at the accessibility of the\nfacilities as a whole, not at individual elements.”  Chaffin v. Kansas State Fair Bd., 348 F.3d 850,\n861 (10th Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).\nPlaintiffs, however, maintain that, since each Philadelphia voter is assigned to a polling\nlocation and cannot be reassigned to an alternative, accessible, location,18 each polling place\nconstitutes a unique program and each must be accessible.  Plaintiffs rely on two illustrations from\nthe Technical Assistance Manual:\nILLUSTRATION 2: D, a defendant in a civil suit, has a respiratory\ncondition that prevents her from climbing steps. Civil suits are\n18The Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures provide that county boards of elections may not\nassign disabled voters “to an accessible polling place other than the polling place to which they have\nbeen assigned based on their residence address . . . .”  Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 4(b).\n21\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 22 of 55\nroutinely heard in a courtroom on the second floor of the courthouse.\nThe courthouse has no elevator or other means of access to the second\nfloor. The public entity must relocate the proceedings to an accessible\nground floor courtroom or take alternative steps, including moving\nthe proceedings to another building, in order to allow D to participate\nin the civil suit.\nILLUSTRATION 3: A State provides ten rest areas approximately 50\nmiles  apart  along  an  interstate  highway.  Program  accessibility\nrequires that an accessible toilet room for each sex with at least one\naccessible stall, or a unisex bathroom, be provided at each rest area.\nTechnical Assistance Manual § II-5.1000.   Plaintiffs maintain that the program in Illustration 2 is\nnot the right to pursue or defend civil actions generally, but the right to fully participate in the\nlitigation process.  Since the litigant could not participate in an inaccessible location, he was\nexcluded from the program “when viewed in its entirety.”  (Pl. Mem. at 21.)  Plaintiffs argue that\nthe program at issue in this case is not the opportunity to vote, but the voting process that takes place\nat each voter’s assigned, neighborhood polling location where voters can vote with friends and\nneighbors, meet and speak with election judges and party officials, and receive information about\nthe candidates.  Consequently, if a voter is unable to vote at his or her assigned neighborhood polling\nlocation, he or she is excluded from the program.  Plaintiffs state that, in Illustration 3, each rest stop\nis a discrete program because of the distance between the stops.  Consequently, if fewer than all of\nthe rest stops are accessible, “drivers will be subject to a de facto denial of access to the program.”\n(Pl. Mem. at 19.)  Plaintiffs argue that, since voters are precluded from traveling to accessible polling\nplaces if their assigned polling places are inaccessible, each polling place must constitute a separate\nprogram of voting.  \nPlaintiffs also argue that Defendants’ provision of the alternate ballot process allowing voting\nin City Hall does not change the fact that each polling place constitutes its own program.  Plaintiffs\n22\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 23 of 55\nnote that almost all Philadelphia voters would have to travel significantly farther to City Hall than\nto their assigned polling places.  (See Defs. Obj. and Ans. to Pls. First Requests for Admissions, No.\n28.)  In addition, disabled voters can vote at City Hall only if they apply for and meet the eligibility\ncriteria for voting by alternative ballot.  Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 9(b).  Plaintiffs also\nargue that voting at City Hall is not the same as voting in one’s own local polling place with friends\nand neighbors and with access to the election information.\nWe find  that  Philadelphia’s program of voting comprises its entire voting program,\nencompassing all of its polling locations throughout the City, as well as its alternative and absentee\nballot programs.  Plaintiffs’ argument that each individual polling location constitutes a separate\nprogram is not supported by the Illustrations.   Illustration 2 is inapposite since, in that illustration,\nthe courthouse could remedy the discrimination by moving proceedings to an accessible building.\nDefendants have exercised that option in this case by allowing voting on election day in City Hall,\nwhich is an accessible building.  Moreover, the hardship placed on voters who travel to City Hall to\nvote is not similar to the hardship in Illustration 3 -- having to drive an additional fifty miles to use\nan accessible bathroom -- as no voter in Philadelphia would have to travel 50 miles to City Hall.  We\nhave not ignored any hardship that traveling to City Hall, or voting by alternative ballot, might place\non a disabled voter who cannot access his or her local polling place, or the fact that voters who take\nadvantage of those options would not have the benefits of voting in their neighborhood polling\nlocations.  However, we find that those factors are best considered in the determination of whether\nPhiladelphia’s entire program of voting violates the ADA and RA.  Consequently, we analyze\nPlaintiffs’ claims of discrimination in the context of Defendants’ entire, city-wide, program of\nvoting. \n23\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 24 of 55\n2. Plaintiffs’ claims 1, 2 and 7 - program accessibility under the ADA and RA\nPlaintiffs claim that the City’s program of voting violates the ADA’s and RA’s program\naccessibility standards by failing to assure that the City’s program of voting is readily accessible to\nand usable by individuals with disabilities.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.150 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.57.  They\nalso claim that, by failing to assure the accessibility of all of the City’s polling places that can be\nmade accessible, Defendants have violated the ADA and RA by excluding them from participation\nin, or denying them the benefits of, their program of voting in the manner that is available to non-\ndisabled people, and by failing to afford them with equal opportunity to participate in the voting\nprocess.  See 28 C.F.R. §§  35.130(a) and 35.130(b)(1); 28 C.F.R. §§  41.51(a) and 41.51(b)(1). \nThe ADA’s and RA’s program accessibility standards do not require public entities, or\nrecipients of federal financial assistance, to remove all structural and architectural barriers to\nindividuals with mobility disabilities: \nRecognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities\nwill often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion,\nCongress required the States to take reasonable measures to remove\narchitectural and other barriers to accessibility.  [42 U.S.C.] § 12132.\nBut Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to\nmake  judicial  services  accessible  or  to  compromise  essential\neligibility criteria for public programs.  It requires only “reasonable\nmodifications” that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the\nservice provided, and only when the individual seeking modification\nis otherwise eligible for the service.  Ibid.  Title II’s implementing\nregulations make clear that the reasonable modification requirement\ncan be satisfied in various ways, including less costly measures than\nstructural changes. \nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 511 (2004).   The ADA’s program accessibility standard with\nrespect to existing facilities is set out in 28 C.F.R. § 35.150:\n  (a) General. A public entity shall operate each service, program, or\n24\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 25 of 55\nactivity so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with\ndisabilities. This paragraph does not--\n(1) Necessarily require a public entity to make each of its existing\nfacilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; . .\n. .\n(3) Require a public entity to take any action that it can demonstrate\nwould result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service,\nprogram, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.\n. . .  If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, a\npublic entity shall take any other action that would not result in such\nan alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that\nindividuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided\nby the public entity.\n(b) Methods--(1) General. A public entity may comply with the\nrequirements of this section through such means as redesign of\nequipment,  reassignment  of  services  to  accessible  buildings,\nassignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services\nat  alternate  accessible  sites,  alteration  of  existing  facilities  and\nconstruction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock or other\nconveyances, or any other methods that result in making its services,\nprograms, or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals\nwith disabilities. A public entity is not required to make structural\nchanges in existing facilities where other methods are effective in\nachieving compliance with this section . . . .  In choosing among\navailable methods for meeting the requirements of this section, a\npublic entity shall give priority to those methods that offer services,\nprograms, and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in\nthe most integrated setting appropriate.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150.  The RA’s program accessibility standard for existing facilities is set forth in 28\nC.F.R. § 41.57:  \nA recipient shall operate each program or activity so that the program\nor activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and\nusable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily\nrequire a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part\nof an existing facility accessible to and usable by handicapped\npersons.\n25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 26 of 55\n28 C.F.R. § 41.57(a).\nThe evidence on the record of this Motion demonstrates that at least 26% of the City’s\npolling divisions are not accessible by voters with mobility disabilities.  On April 22, 2008, Plaintiffs\nfound that 114 polling places serving 179 divisions that were designated by Defendants as accessible\nwere inaccessible.  Adding to that figure the 224 polling divisions that Defendants concede are\nlocated in inaccessible buildings, and the 24 polling places serving 39 polling divisions that Plaintiffs\nfound were inaccessible on November 6, 2007 and were not included in Plaintiffs’ April 22, 2008\nsurvey, 442 of the City’s polling divisions are located in inaccessible facilities.  Consequently,\nPlaintiffs have submitted evidence that 442 polling divisions, comprising approximately 26% of the\nCity’s 1,681 polling divisions, are located in inaccessible facilities.19  \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims of\ndiscrimination under the ADA and RA despite the fact that a significant percentage of their polling\nlocations are not accessible, because the City’s entire program of voting is meaningfully open to\nvoters with disabilities.  They contend that their program of voting enables voters with mobility\n19Defendants maintain, in contrast, that 84% of the City’s polling divisions will be located\nin accessible facilities for the next election and that any accessibility problems found by Plaintiffs\nare, accordingly, isolated errors.  Defendants have calculated the 84% accessibility figure by\npromising to correct the majority of the accessibility problems identified by Plaintiffs in their\nNovember 2007 and April 2008 polling place accessibility surveys.  Defendants have indicated that\nthey will install signs directing voters to accessible alternate entrances; correct designations for\nincorrectly designated polling places; and assure that ramps are installed and alternative accessible\nentrances are unlocked for future elections, thereby remedying the problems identified by Plaintiffs\nat the polling places they surveyed during the last two elections.  (Defs. Reply Br. at 1 n.2; Lee\nSuppl. Decl. ¶ 16.)  Unfortunately, at this stage of the litigation, we cannot rely on Defendants’\nassertions that certain problems will be fixed in the future.  Moreover, it is clear from the record that\nDefendants were aware of some of these accessibility issues prior to the April 22, 2008 election, but\nfailed to make corrections.  We conclude, accordingly, that there is evidence on the record of this\nMotion that at least 26% of Philadelphia’s polling divisions are assigned to facilities that were not\naccessible on election day. \n26\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 27 of 55\ndisabilities to cast their ballots effectively, either at their neighborhood polling location or through\nalternative or absentee ballots.  Defendants maintain that their alternative ballot process allows\nvoters to apply for, and utilize, alternative ballots by mail, apply for alternative ballots by phone or\nin person at City Hall, and cast alternative ballots in person at City Hall or by having a designated\nagent drop the ballot off at City Hall.20  (Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 4.)  Indeed, mobility\ndisabled voters whose polling places are designated as accessible (but not FH), and who discover\non election day that they cannot access their polling place, are notified, through posters at the polling\nplace, that they may apply for emergency ballots at City Hall.  (See  Pl. Ex. 29, Lee Dep. at 290, 292,\n20Defendants further argue that the City’s use of the alternative ballot process fulfills their\naccessibility obligations under the RA and ADA because alternative ballots are similar to absentee\nballots.  Defendants note that the use of absentee ballots is sanctioned by federal law for persons with\ndisabilities, military personnel, Americans living overseas, and voters who are out-of-town on\nelection day.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff-1(a)(1) (allowing states to “permit absent uniformed services\nvoters and overseas voters to use absentee registration procedures and to vote by absentee ballot in\ngeneral, special, primary, and runoff elections for Federal office”) and 42 U.S.C. § 1973aa-1(d)\n(requiring the states to “provide by law for the casting of absentee ballots for the choice of electors\nfor President and Vice President, or for President and Vice President” by all state voters who are\n“absent from their election district or unit in such State on the day such election is held”).\nDefendants argue that disabled voters are not entitled to greater access to neighborhood polling\nplaces than military voters or people who are away from home on election day and stress that, if\nabsentee ballots are sufficient for the military, they should be sufficient for disabled voters.  Of\ncourse, Defendants clearly miss the point that the members of the class in this case, mobility disabled\nvoters who live and vote in Philadelphia and who would like to vote in their assigned neighborhood\npolling places, are not out of town on election day, unlike military personnel or overseas voters.  We\nconsequently find this argument unavailing.\nDefendants further rely on NAACP v. Philadelphia Bd. of Elections, Civ. A. No. 97-7085,\n1998 WL 321253 (E.D. Pa. June 16, 1998), for the proposition that Defendants’ use of alternative\nballot procedures fulfills their obligations under the ADA.  Id. at *3.  We have previously\nconsidered, and rejected, their reliance on this case, concluding that, “the specific issue at the center\nof this case, whether the ADA requires Defendants to take additional steps to avoid discrimination\nand provide equal access to the voting process, was not before the NAACP court.  Consequently,\nNAACP v. Philadelphia Bd. of Elections is not controlling here.” Kerrigan v. Phila. Bd. of Election,\nCiv. A. No. 07-687, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6365, at *12 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 29, 2008).  Defendants have\nnot persuaded us that our previous rejection of NAACP was wrong.\n27\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 28 of 55\n297-98.)   \nPlaintiffs, however, argue that, under the ADA’s program accessibility mandate, Defendants\nmust give priority to making their polling places accessible rather than using alternative methods of\nvoting, in order to ensure that disabled voters vote in the most integrated setting.  Plaintiffs rely on\nthe Technical Assistance Manual:  \nPublic entities may achieve program accessibility by a number of\nmethods. In many situations, providing access to facilities through\nstructural  methods,  such  as  alteration  of  existing  facilities  and\nacquisition or construction of additional facilities, may be the most\nefficient method of providing program accessibility. The public entity\nmay, however, pursue alternatives to structural changes in order to\nachieve  program  accessibility.  Nonstructural  methods  include\nacquisition  or  redesign  of  equipment,  assignment  of  aides  to\nbeneficiaries, and provision of services at alternate accessible sites.\n. . .\nWhen choosing a method of providing program access, a public entity\nmust give priority to the one that results in the most integrated setting\nappropriate  to encourage interaction among all users, including\nindividuals with disabilities.\nTechnical Assistance Manual § II-5.2000.  Plaintiffs also contend that the alternative ballot process\nis not  truly equivalent to physical access to the program facilities because it does not afford voters\nwith mobility disabilities access to the voting process that is as effective as accessible polling places.\nThey maintain that the alternative ballot process results in segregated voting because voters who use\nthe process vote in isolation from their non-disabled neighbors, thus violating the integrated setting\nelement of the program access mandate.  See Id. and 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1).  Plaintiffs also\ncontend that voters with mobility disabilities lack knowledge about the alternative ballot process\n(Mangum Dep. at 34; Davenport Dep. at 48; Kerrigan Dep. at 21-22, 32, 33; Ramnathsingh Dep. at\n17; Ahmad Dep. at 20-22) and that the alternative ballot process is significantly more burdensome\n28\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 29 of 55\nthan voting in one’s assigned neighborhood polling place.  \nPlaintiffs argue that voting by alternative ballot is more burdensome than voting at one’s\nassigned polling place on election day because it:  (1) requires voters with mobility disabilities to\nsubmit applications for alternative ballots at least one week prior to election day except in\nemergencies (Lee Decl. Ex. 3); (2) requires disabled voters to disclose the private nature of their\ndisabilities (Lee Decl. Ex. 3); (3) requires disabled voters to either vote before election day, or make\narrangements to travel to City Hall, or find someone else to travel to City Hall, to deliver their\nalternative ballots on election day, Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 9(c); and, (4) is not\navailable to voters with mobility disabilities who are assigned to polling places that Defendants have\ndetermined are accessible. Id. § 9(b).  \nDefendants maintain that the alternative ballot process is not overly burdensome.  They\ncontend that the requirement that disabled individuals request an alternative ballot seven days prior\nto the election is not onerous, since those individuals may vote by emergency ballot at City Hall on\nelection day if they fail to plan ahead.  Defendants further maintain, despite the contrary directions\non the alternative ballot application, that voters applying for an alternative ballot because of a\nhandicap do not need to provide information regarding their disability or physician.  (Lee Decl. Ex.\n3.)  They also claim that they plan to clear up any confusing instructions to the contrary on the\napplication form before the next election.  (Lee Suppl. Decl. ¶ 7.)  Defendants also deny that voters\nlack knowledge of the alternative and emergency ballot process, since the Board places notices\nincluding this information in local newspapers before every election, provides this information on\nits website, and provides poll workers with signs containing information about the emergency ballot\nprocess.  (Lee Dep. at 290, 292, 295-96; Ex. C to Defs. Reply Brief; Pls. Ex. 29.)  In addition, the\n29\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 30 of 55\nDisabilities Rights Network and the Committee of Seventy provide information on alternative voting\nprocedures to the public.  (Thelen Decl. ¶¶ 2-4, Exs. D2-D5.)  Moreover, despite any contrary\ninstructions on the emergency alternative ballot application,  Defendants contend that it is their\npractice to “accept voters’ self-certification that their polling place is inaccessible, they have a\ndisability,” and that they have a reason for applying for an emergency ballot.  (Lee Dep. at 288-90.)\nWe find, however, that at this stage of the litigation, we cannot rely on Defendants’ representations\nthat they take actions that contradict their own written procedures and the Commonwealth’s\ndirectives with respect to alternative voting.  We also find that Plaintiffs have submitted evidence\ncreating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the alternative/absentee ballot procedure is\nmore burdensome for disabled voters than voting in an accessible neighborhood polling place.\nPlaintiffs also argue that the alternative/absentee ballot process cannot, by itself, satisfy\nDefendants’ obligation to comply with the ADA’s and RA’s program access mandate because the\nprogram of voting in Philadelphia includes the opportunity to vote, as non-disabled voters do, in\nneighborhood polling places, where voters may vote with their neighbors, meet election judges and\nparty officials, and obtain information from representatives of the candidates.  Defendants argue that\nPlaintiffs have failed to establish an entitlement to vote with friends and neighbors, meet local\nelection judges and party officials, or gain access to information from candidate representatives at\ntheir assigned polling place on election day.  Defendants insist that the program of voting consists\nonly of casting a ballot.  \nWhen deciding what elements are encompassed in Philadelphia’s program of voting, we\nexamine whether the challenged program is a normal government activity.  “Attempting to\ndistinguish which public functions are services, programs, or activities, and which are not, would\n30\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 31 of 55\ndisintegrate into needless hair-splitting arguments.  The focus of the inquiry, therefore, is not so\nmuch on whether a particular public function can technically be characterized as a service, program,\nor activity, but whether it is a normal function of a governmental entity.”  Barden v. City of\nSacramento, 292 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal quotations omitted); see also Yeskey v.\nPennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections, 118 F.3d 168, 171 (3d Cir. Pa. 1997) (“The regulations\n[promulgated under Title II of the ADA] state that the statute’s coverage extends to ‘all services,\nprograms, and activities provided or made available by public entities.’ [28 C.F.R.] § 35.102(a). This\nbroad language is intended to ‘apply to anything a public entity does.’ Id. pt. 35, app. A, subpt. A at\n456.”).  There is no question that Philadelphia residents who vote in their local polling places may\nhave the opportunity to talk with their neighbors and local party officials, election officials, and poll\nworkers, and obtain candidate information.  Moreover, class members have expressed the desire to\nvote at their local polling places because they see their neighbors at their assigned polling place; they\ncan obtain information about candidates at the polls; and because they want to vote “like normal\npeople.”  (Davenport Dep. at 48-49; Ahmad Dep. at 21-22; Magnum Dep. at 34-35.)  “The right to\nvote encompasses more than the right to gain physical access to a voting booth, to mark a ballot or\npull a lever. Persons must have the opportunity to comprehend the registration and election forms\nand the ballot itself to cast an informed and effective vote.  The meaningful right to vote extends\nbeyond the four corners of the voting machine.”  United States v. Berks County, 277 F. Supp. 2d\n570, 579 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (citation omitted).   Consequently, we find that, in the City of Philadelphia\nthe program of voting includes the opportunity to vote in one’s local, assigned, polling place, where\nthe voter can take advantage of the opportunities to meet election judges, see their neighbors, and\nobtain information from candidates’ representatives. \n31\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 32 of 55\nWe conclude that failing to ensure that mobility disabled voters are able to vote in their\nneighborhood polling places, to the extent that the Defendants can do so, is a failure to provide\nmobility disabled voters with an equal opportunity to access the program of voting and violates the\nprogram access mandate.  See Westchester Disabled on the Move, Inc. v. County of Westchester,\n346 F. Supp. 2d 473, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“Failing to ensure that disabled individuals are able to\nvote in person and at their assigned polling places--presumably the most commonly used method of\nvoting--could not reasonably be construed as consistent with providing ‘meaningful access’ to the\nvoting process, particularly where the alternatives relied upon by the Defendants impose additional\ncosts, risks and inconveniences on disabled voters not faced by others.”) We find that Plaintiffs have\nsubmitted  sufficient  evidence  to  create  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  regarding  whether\nDefendants’ reliance on the alternative ballot, rather than making necessary modifications to make\npolling places accessible, violates the program accessibility mandate because it does not provide the\nprogram of voting in the most integrated setting.  We further find that Plaintiffs have submitted\nsufficient evidence of City polling locations that could have been made accessible on election day,\nbut were not, to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants have violated the\nADA and the § 504 of the RA by failing to assure that polling places that could have been made\naccessible were accessible on election day. \n3. Plaintiffs’ third and sixth claims - whether Defendants select inaccessible\npolling places and whether they have violated the integration mandate        \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ discriminatory\nsite selection and integration mandate claims because Plaintiffs have no proof that they have not\nprovided access to voting in the most integrated manner possible.  Defendants maintain that they\n32\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 33 of 55\ngive priority to selecting accessible polling places and to providing access to voting in the most\nintegrated settings.  They conducted an accessibility evaluation of all polling places locations in\n2002, and conducted two subsequent comprehensive searches to identify available accessible\nalternative polling locations.  (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 22-23, 25.)  Defendants further claim that they try to\nselect the most accessible, appropriate polling place when they select new sites.  (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 15,\n27.)  The Board selects public sites over private sites and will select an inaccessible site only if there\nare no accessible sites in the division or any adjacent division.  (Lee Suppl. Decl. ¶ 15.)  In addition,\nthe Board works with the City and the School District to use accessible public buildings and schools\nas polling places.  (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 12, 29-32.)  The Board is also working with the City’s Law\nDepartment to allow the City to pay for renovations to private polling places.  (Lee Decl. ¶ 33, Lee\nDep. at 87-88.)  In addition, the Board makes some polling locations temporarily accessible by\ninstalling ramps.  The Board has purchased 50 additional one-step ramps this year and plans to buy\nthreshold ramps for the next election.  (Lee Supp. Decl. ¶ 13.) \nWe find, however, that the evidence on the record of this Motion demonstrates that there are\ngenuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendants select inaccessible polling places and\nwhether they give priority to providing access to voting in the most integrated settings.  The\ntranscripts of the hearings held by the City Commissioners regarding requests that polling places be\nmoved from inaccessible to accessible locations show that the Commissioners have denied\nrelocations to accessible facilities based upon unsworn verbal assurances that:  (1) facilities were\naccessible where those facilities were not accessible for the April 22, 2008 election (Ward 2/Div. 25;\nWard 15/Div.8; and Ward 47Divs. 1, 2); people who were not present at the hearing would install\nramps at those locations, but those ramps were never installed (Ward 4/Divs. 3, 15; Ward 4/Div. 10;\n33\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 34 of 55\nWard 4/Div. 16; Ward 10/Div. 9; Ward 11/Div. 14; Ward 15/Div. 15; Ward 33/Div. 4; Ward\n39/Divs. 3, 20; and Ward 39/Div. 33); andseniors would not be willing to walk to the proposed new\nlocation (Ward 15/Div. 12; Ward 25/Div. 1; Ward 39/Div. 3, 20; Ward 39/Div. 33; Ward 41/Div.\n2; Ward 41/Div. 23; Ward 58/Div. 25).  (See Appendix C.)  There is also evidence that Defendants\ncould make other polling places temporarily accessible by installing temporary ramps on election\nday or by ensuring that alternative accessible entrances are marked with appropriate signs and\nunlocked for use by individuals with mobility disabilities, but they have not done so.  (Resnick Decl.\n¶¶ 3-5, 8-9, 12-14; Shilliday Decl. ¶ 3; Davenport Decl. ¶ 3; Way Decl. ¶ 3; Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 3-4,\n5; Parodi Decl. ¶ 4; Kane Decl. ¶ 3; Salandra Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5, 7-8; Keister Decl. ¶ 3; Goldstein Decl.\n¶ 3; Jones Decl. ¶ 3;  Suppl.

Salandra Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5-10, 12-13, 15-20, 23; Suppl. Johnson Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) We further\nfind, accordingly, that Plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence of Defendants’ selection of\ninaccessible polling locations and failure to give priority to providing the program of voting in the\nmost integrated setting, to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants have\nviolated the ADA and § 504 of the RA.\nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is, accordingly, denied as to their arguments that\nPlaintiffs have not satisfied their obligation to establish, as part of their prima facie case of\ndiscrimination, that they  are being excluded from participation in, being denied the benefits of, or\nbeing subjected to discrimination under the City’s program of voting solely because of their\ndisabilities in violation of Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the RA.\n34\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 35 of 55\nD. Reasonable Modifications\nDefendants argue that they are entitled to the entry of summary judgment in this case, even\nif Plaintiffs are able to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, because Plaintiffs have failed\nto satisfy their burden of articulating reasonable modifications.  The regulations implementing the\nADA provide that:\nA public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies,\npractices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to\navoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity\ncan demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally\nalter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).  Defendants maintain that, in order to satisfy their burden of establishing\nthe existence of reasonable modifications, Plaintiffs must identify all of the inaccessible polling\nlocations that can be made accessible through modification or relocation as well as the type of\nmodifications required or the locations where the polling places can be relocated.

Plaintiffs further maintain that the evidence they have submitted is\nsufficient to establish that the modifications they seek are feasible and to secure the relief they seek -\nthe appointment of an independent expert to review all polling places and make specific accessibility\nrecommendations.  They also assert that the appointment of the requested expert would not prevent\nDefendants from asserting a fundamental alteration or undue burden defense as to specific polling\nplaces and, consequently, that this relief is consistent with the ADA’s and RA’s reasonable\nmodification mandates.\nPlaintiffs rely on Anderson v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 1 F. Supp. 2d 456 (E.D. Pa. 1998).25\n23The record citations relevant to polling place relocations may be found in Appendix C.\n24Defendants’ list and Plaintiffs’ list contain 13 duplicate polling locations serving 22\ndivisions:  Ward 2/Div. 2; Ward 3/Div. 6; Ward 4/Div. 16; Ward 15/Div. 12; Ward 17/Div. 24; Ward\n41/Divs. 13, 14 (one polling place); Ward 41/Div. 18; Ward 51/Divs. 15, 18 (one polling place);\nWard 53/Divs. 17, 18 and Ward 56/Divs. 3 (one polling place); Ward 59/Divs. 21, 22 (one polling\nplace); Ward 61/Divs. 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 (one polling place); Ward 61/Div. 9; Ward 61/Div. 21.\n25 Plaintiffs also rely on Frederick L., stating that the Third Circuit did not require the\nplaintiffs in that case to identify specific modifications for each plaintiff, but placed the burden on\nthe  Commonwealth.    Plaintiffs  in  Frederick  L.  were  “a  class  of  mental  health  patients\ninstitutionalized at [Norristown State Hospital] who are statutorily eligible for deinstitutionalization\nand who therefore seek integration into community-based healthcare programs.”  Frederick L., 422\nF.3d at 154.  The Frederick L. plaintiffs claimed “that because they are qualified and prepared for\ncommunity-based services, their continued institutionalization violates the anti-discrimination and\nintegration mandates of the” ADA and Section 504 of the RA.  Id.  The Third Circuit placed the\nburden on the Commonwealth, rather than on plaintiffs, to come up with an overall integration plan\n38\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 39 of 55\nPlaintiffs in Anderson were mobility and visually impaired individuals who received Medical\nAssistance in Pennsylvania, and an organization serving such individuals.  Id. at 461. They claimed\nthat the defendants violated Title II of the ADA “first, by failing to require that all health care\nproviders in DPW’s mandatory managed care program practice in offices accessible to people with\nmobility impairments; second, by failing to provide all information related to the managed care\nprogram in alternative formats such as Braille, large print, and audiotape; and third, by using\nmethods of administration that have discriminatory effects.”  Id. at 459.  The plaintiffs in Anderson\nclaimed that the Commonwealth’s managed care program could not “be an accessible program\nunless, inter alia, individuals with mobility impairments have physical access to the office of every\nparticipating health care provider.”  Id. at 463.   Plaintiffs claim that the Anderson plaintiffs were\nnot required to identify each and every medical provider whose office was inaccessible or suggest\nreasonable modifications for each such office.  Nonetheless, the Anderson court found that the\ndefendants in that case had violated the ADA and required providers to comply with the accessibility\nrequirements of the ADA with respect to their offices.  Id. at 469.  \nPlaintiffs also rely on Kinney v. Yerusalim, 812 F. Supp. 547 (E.D. Pa.), aff’d 9 F.3d 1067\n(3d Cir. 1993).  The Kinney plaintiffs, disabled individuals who lived in or worked in Philadelphia,\nsued the Pennsylvania Secretary of Transportation and Philadelphia Streets Commissioner to compel\nthat specified the number and time frames for the discharge of class members.  Frederick L., 422\nF.3d at 160.  However, the Commonwealth in that case was relying on the existence of its plan as\na defense to plaintiffs’ integration claim, pursuant to Olmstead, in which the Supreme Court:  “noted\nthat a state may defend against integration claims by providing ‘a comprehensive, effectively\nworking plan for placing qualified persons with mental disabilities in less restrictive settings, and\na waiting list that moved at a reasonable pace not controlled by the State’s endeavors to keep its\ninstitutions fully populated.’” Id. at 157 (quoting Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 605-606).  We find that\nFrederick L. is inapposite and does not support Plaintiffs’ argument.\n39\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 40 of 55\nthe City of Philadelphia to install curb cuts on all streets resurfaced since the ADA became effective.\nId. at 548.  Plaintiffs maintain that the Kinney court did not require the plaintiffs in that case to\nidentify every resurfaced street that did not have curb cuts before imposing systemic relief.  We agree\nthat Plaintiffs need not identify every inaccessible polling place in Philadelphia, or specify the\nmodifications needed to make each accessible, at this stage of this litigation.\nDefendants further argue that the modifications Plaintiffs seek are patently unreasonable in\nlight of their exorbitant cost and the minimal impact the requested review would have on the\naccessibility of the City’s polling locations.  Defendants contend that the limited number of\ninaccessible polling places identified by Plaintiffs cannot justify a full scale review of all 1,681 of\nthe City’s polling divisions.  They also suggest that the proposed review could cost as much as $2\nmillion.26  We find that Plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence of what appear to be simple and\nrelatively inexpensive modifications that would make 159 of the polling places they visited\naccessible to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether they have satisfied their\nburden of proof of coming forward with reasonable modifications.  We further find that Defendants\nhave not come forward with any evidence that Plaintiffs’ request that we appoint an expert to assess\nthe City’s polling locations is unreasonable. Consequently, Defendants’ Motion for Summary\nJudgment is denied as to Plaintiffs’ obligation to identify reasonable modifications.\n26Defendants estimate that it would take an expert three hours to visit, evaluate and analyze\neach polling division at $375/hour for all 1,681 polling locations.  (Defs. Reply Brief at 29 n.23.)\nThe hourly rate Defendants use for the hypothetical expert is the hourly rate charged by Plaintiff’s\nexpert for his deposition testimony.  (Id. and Def. Reply Mem. Ex. P.)\n40\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 41 of 55\nE. The VAEH\nDefendants also argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because their use of the\nalternative ballot process is consistent with the VAEH, which they claim conflicts with and\nsupersedes the ADA and RA with respect to polling place accessibility.  Defendants maintain that,\nsince the VAEH supersedes the ADA and RA, Plaintiffs cannot prevail in this case unless they prove\nthat Defendants have violated the VAEH.  Since Plaintiffs have not asserted a claim pursuant to the\nVAEH, and do not explicitly challenge Defendants’ compliance with the VAEH, Defendants contend\ntheir claims must fail.  \nThe VAEH specifically allows that a disabled voter, who is assigned to a polling place that\nhas  been  designated  as  inaccessible  in  accordance  with  procedures  promulgated  by  the\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, may be provided with an alternative ballot.  The VAEH provides,\nin relevant part, as follows:  \n(a) Within each State, except as provided in subsection (b) of this\nsection,  each  political  subdivision  responsible  for  conducting\nelections shall assure that all polling places for Federal elections are\naccessible to handicapped and elderly voters.\n(b) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a polling place--\n(1) in the case of an emergency, as determined by the chief election\nofficer of the State; or\n(2) if the chief election officer of the State--\n(A) determines that all potential polling places have been surveyed\nand  no  such  accessible  place  is  available,  nor  is  the  political\nsubdivision able to make one temporarily accessible, in the area\ninvolved; and\n(B) assures that any handicapped or elderly voter assigned to an\ninaccessible  polling  place,  upon  advance  request  of  such  voter\n41\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 42 of 55\n(pursuant to procedures established by the chief election officer of the\nState)--\n(i) will be assigned to an accessible polling place, or\n(ii) will be provided with an alternative means for casting a ballot on\nthe day of the election.\n42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1.  \nDefendants contend that the VAEH, ADA and RA are in pari materia.  Two statutes are in\npari materia, when they relate to the same subject matter.  Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt, 546 U.S.\n303, 315-16 (2006).  When statutes are in pari materia, they “generally should be read ‘as if they\nwere one law.’” Id. (quoting Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 243 (1972)).  There are\nspecific rules of construction for statutes which are in pari materia:  \nWhere one statute deals with a subject in general terms, and another\ndeals with a part of the same subject in a more detailed way, the two\nshould be harmonized if possible; but if there is any conflict, the latter\nwill prevail, regardless of whether it was passed prior to the general\nstatute, unless it appears that the legislature intended to make the\ngeneral act controlling. \nIn re Guardianship of Penn, 15 F.3d 292, 294 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting Creque v. Luis, 803 F.2d 92,\n94 (3d Cir. 1986)).  Consequently, if there is a conflict between the ADA, RA and VAEH, “ the more\nspecific statute takes precedence over the more general one.”  Coady v. Vaughn, 251 F.3d 480, 484\n(3d Cir. 2001) (citing Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 657 (1997); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411\nU.S. 475, 488-89 (1973) and West v. Keve, 721 F.2d 91, 96 (3d Cir.1983)); see also Edmond v.\nUnited States, 520 U.S. 651, 657 (1997) (“Ordinarily, where a specific provision conflicts with a\ngeneral one, the specific governs.”  (citing Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 406 (1980))).   \nDefendants state that the ADA, RA and VAEH are in pari materia because they all address\n42\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 43 of 55\naccessibility for voters with mobility disabilities and, consequently, they should be construed to give\nmeaning to each.  Defendants maintain that, since the VAEH is the only one of these statutes to\nspecifically address the accessibility of polling place buildings, it takes precedence over the ADA\nand RA.  Defendants further assert that the only plausible interpretation of the ADA and RA that\ngives meaning to the VAEH is that “when accessible polling places are not provided, alternative\nballots assure that voting is readily accessible to, and usable by, people with disabilities as required\nby the ADA.”  (Def. Mem. at 30.)  Defendants further contend that interpreting the ADA as requiring\nthat every polling place be made accessible would render 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973ee-1(b)(2)(B)(ii)\nmeaningless. \nPlaintiffs maintain that the VAEH is not in pari materia with the ADA and RA because they\ndo not address the same subject matter, as the ADA and RA apply to state and federal elections and\nthe VAEH applies only to federal elections.  We find, however, that the VAEH, ADA and RA are\nin pari materia because they all apply to voting.27\nPlaintiffs further maintain that the VAEH may be harmonized with the ADA and RA to\nrequire that Defendants maximize the number of accessible polling locations because the alternative\nballot process under the VAEH is intended to be an alternative of last resort.  The legislative history\nof the VAEH supports their argument.  The Senate made it clear that one of the main objectives of\nthe VAEH was to “improve the accessibility of polling and registration places . . . .”  S. Rep. No. 98-\n590, at 2 (1984),  reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2801, 2802.  Another stated objective of the law\n27We note that, although it is not required to do so by the VAEH, the Commonwealth of\nPennsylvania requires county boards of elections to follow the Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures\nfor all elections, even if there is no election for a federal office on the ballot.  Pa. Voting\nAccessibility Procedures § 2.  Consequently, the VAEH is treated as though it applies to all elections\nin Pennsylvania.\n43\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 44 of 55\nwas to “insure that those voters who wish to vote at an accessible polling site on the day of the\nelection are given the opportunity to do so . . . .”  Id.  The Senate allowed that, if there “was no\naccessible polling place and one could not be made even temporarily accessible[,]” an exception\ncould be made to the mandate that all polling places be made accessible and a disabled voter could\nbe reassigned to an accessible polling place or, if “provisions of state law . . . prohibit an individual\nfrom voting in a precinct or political subdivision other than the one in which such voter resides . .\n. the chief election officer would have the additional option of providing a voter with some other\nmeans for casting a ballot on the day of the election,” including alternative ballots.  Id., 1984\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 2802-03.  It is, however, clear from the text of the VAEH and the Senate Report\nthat the provision of alternative ballots was not meant to be the exception that swallowed the rule.\nAlternative ballots were to be provided only if there  “was no accessible polling place and one\ncould not be made even temporarily accessible.”  Id., 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2802 (emphasis\nadded).\nWe find, accordingly, that there is no conflict between the VAEH and the RA and ADA in\nthis case, and, consequently, there is no need to determine which statute should take precedence.  We\nare, therefore, required to read the statutes together, “as if they were one law.”  Wachovia Bank, 546\nU.S. at 315 (citation omitted).  Thus, we read the VAEH, together with the ADA and RA, to require\nDefendants to maximize the number of polling places that are accessible to individuals with mobility\nimpairments, and to rely on the alternative voting process only as an alternative of last resort.\nDefendant’s Motion is, therefore, denied as to their argument that the VAEH conflicts with and takes\nprecedence over the ADA and RA.\n44\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 45 of 55\nF. Failure to Join Necessary and Indispensable Parties\nDefendants argue that this case should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed to join as\ndefendants the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the owners of the private properties used as\npolling places in Philadelphia.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a) requires that absent persons\nbe joined as parties, where feasible, if:\n     (A) in that person’s absence, the court cannot accord complete\nrelief among existing parties; or\n     (B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the\naction and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person’s\nabsence may:\n           (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability\nto protect the interest; or\n       (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of\nincurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations\nbecause of the interest.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1).  If a necessary person has not been joined as a party, we “must order the\nperson be made a party.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2).  If a party is necessary, but cannot be joined, we\ndetermine whether that party is indispensable, i.e., “whether, in equity and good conscience,” we\nshould allow the action to “proceed among the existing parties or [whether it] should be dismissed.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).  Defendants contend that the Commonwealth and the private polling place\nproperty owners are necessary and indispensable parties because they have interests that will be\npractically impaired or impeded if they do not participate in this case and because they are necessary\nto accord complete relief to Plaintiffs.\n1. The Commonwealth\nDefendants argue that the Commonwealth’s absence from this litigation will impede its\nability to protect its interests relating to the subject of this action.  The subject of this litigation is the\n45\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 46 of 55\naccessibility of polling locations in Philadelphia.  As a result of the VAEH, the Commonwealth has\na clear and unmistakable interest in the accessibility of polling locations in Philadelphia.  Congress,\nthrough the VAEH, has assigned to the Commonwealth the responsibility for ensuring that all\npotential polling places in a given political subdivision have been surveyed for accessibility and for\ndetermining whether an accessible polling place is available, or may be made temporarily available,\non election day.  42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1(b)(2)(A).  Moreover, a mobility disabled voter may vote by\nalternative ballot in the City of Philadelphia only if the chief election officer of the Commonwealth\nhas determined “that all potential polling places have been surveyed and no such accessible place\nis available” and that the City is not able to make a polling place “temporarily accessible, in the area\ninvolved . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1(b)(2)(B).  The VAEH also requires the chief election officer\nof the Commonwealth to report the number of inaccessible and accessible polling places in the state\nevery two years.  42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1(c)(3).  In addition, the legislative history of the VAEH\nclearly demonstrates that Congress intended to give the ultimate authority and responsibility for\nassuring that polling places are accessible for mobility disabled voters to the Commonwealth.

No. 98-590, at 2, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2801, 2802 (“Specifically, the bill would\ngive the chief election officer of each state the responsibility for promulgating guidelines to assure\naccessibility of polling places.”).\nThe Commonwealth issued the Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures in order to carry out its\nresponsibilities under the VAEH.  Those procedures encompass accessibility surveys; designations\nof inaccessibility; and the information regarding polling place accessibility the Secretary requires the\nBoard to include in its published election notices.  Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures § 3.  The\nCommonwealth also regulates the City’s alternative ballot procedures and the use of absentee ballots\n46\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 47 of 55\nby individuals with disabilities.  Id. §§ 4, 5, 7-10.  The Commonwealth has also developed specific\nguidelines and procedures for determining polling place accessibility pursuant to its responsibilities\nunder the VAEH.  See Guidelines and Definitions Issued by the Secretary of the Commonwealth For\nthe Implementation of the Federal Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act.  In\naddition, the Commonwealth has promulgated laws governing the location and relocation of polling\nplaces.  See 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 2726(a), 2 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 751, 752.\nPlaintiffs argue that the Commonwealth is not an indispensable party in this case because it\nhas effectively ceded its responsibilities under the VAEH to the City of Philadelphia.  Plaintiffs rely\non the fact that, under the Pa. Voting Accessibility Procedures, it is the county boards of elections\nthat survey polling places to determine accessibility, attempt to locate accessible polling places,\nmake polling places temporarily accessible, and make polling place accessibility designations.  Pa.\nVoting Accessibility Procedures § 3.  Nonetheless, it is the responsibility of the Secretary of the\nCommonwealth to determine whether “all potential polling places have been surveyed and no . . .\naccessible place is available” so that the Board may utilize the alternative ballot procedures provided\nby the Commonwealth.  Id. § 1(c)(2)(ii).  \nIn this lawsuit, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants’ designations of polling place accessibility\nand use of the alternative ballot.  Consequently, a finding that Defendants have improperly surveyed\npolling places; improperly designated polling places as accessible; improperly rejected accessible\nalternate polling locations; and/or improperly utilized the alternative ballot, would, at the very least,\nimply malfeasance on the part of the Commonwealth.  In addition, Plaintiffs seek, in relief, the hiring\nof an expert to conduct accessibility surveys of each polling location in Philadelphia and ask that this\nCourt decide whether any such recommendations must be implemented over Defendants’ objection.\n47\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 48 of 55\n(Pls. Proposed Order for Inj. Relief ¶ 3.b., c.).  The relief Plaintiffs seek pursuant to the ADA and\nRA is integrally interwoven with the responsibilities imposed by Congress on the Commonwealth\nthrough the VAEH.  Congress has directed that the Commonwealth play an essential role with\nrespect to the implementation and enforcement of federal rights related to the accessibility of polling\nplaces.  Clearly, principles of comity and federalism require us to recognize that the Commonwealth\nhas an interest in the subject matter of this litigation which may be impaired or impeded in its\nabsence. We find, accordingly, that the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who, as the chief election\nofficer of Pennsylvania is charged with ensuring the Commonwealth’s compliance with the\ndirectives of the VAEH, must be joined as a party to this action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure 19(a)(1) and (2).  Defendants’ Motion is, accordingly, granted with respect to their\nargument that Plaintiffs failed to join the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a party.  As none of the\nexisting parties to this suit contend that the Secretary of the Commonwealth cannot be joined as a\nparty to this action, Plaintiffs are granted leave to file an amended complaint naming the Secretary\nof the Commonwealth as an additional defendant.\n2. Owners of private property used as polling places\nDefendants argue that the owners of the private properties used by Defendants as polling\nplaces are also necessary and indispensable parties to this litigation.  Defendants maintain that we\ncannot grant complete relief to Plaintiffs in the absence of the private polling place property owners\nbecause we cannot order Defendants to modify privately owned property to make it accessible.\nDefendants rely on  Westchester Disabled on the Move, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 479-80.  Plaintiffs in that\ncase sued the County of Westchester under Title II of the ADA and state law, claiming that they had\nbeen discriminated against with respect to their right to vote because Westchester County’s polling\n48\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 49 of 55\nplaces were inaccessible.  Westchester Disabled on the Move, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 475-76.  They\nsought a preliminary injunction ordering the defendant to evaluate the accessibility of its polling\nplaces and to modify its polling places to make them accessible by the next election.  Id. at 475.\nAfter finding that the inability to vote at their assigned polling places caused mobility disabled voters\nirreparable harm, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction on the ground that\nthey were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim because the named defendants were unable\nto afford plaintiffs the complete relief they sought.  Id. at 477-80.  The Westchester Disabled court\nfound that it “would be difficult, if not impossible” to make the necessary changes to the properties\nhousing the county’s polling places without the cooperation of the municipalities that owned most\nof those properties.  Id. at 479-80.  \nDefendants argue that, in this case, it would not be possible for them to make all of the\npolling places in Philadelphia accessible without the approval of the private property owners.  They\nclaim that, “[w]hile third-party owners may be amenable to temporary alterations, it is likely many\nowners will not agree to permanent alterations to accommodate activities that occur in their buildings\nno more than twice a year.”  (Def. Mem. at 36.)  Defendants further argue that it would be impossible\nto add all of the necessary third-party property owners to this suit because Plaintiffs have not\nidentified all of the allegedly inaccessible polling places in the City that they contend should be\nmodified.  \nPlaintiffs disagree, and insist that they have not requested any relief that would require\nDefendants to force private property owners to make their properties temporarily or permanently\naccessible.  Plaintiffs maintain that they seek only an order requiring Defendants to take steps within\ntheir current authority to identify and use accessible polling places.  If an inaccessible polling place\n49\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 50 of 55\nis located on private property, Plaintiffs suggest that Defendants have the following options:  1)\ndetermine whether temporary accessibility modifications are feasible and whether the property owner\nwill agree to them; 2) if temporary modifications are not feasible, Defendants can use financial\nincentives to encourage property owners to make their properties accessible; or, 3) if temporary\nmodifications are not feasible, and private property owners will not make permanent modifications\nto their properties, Defendants can relocate polling places to accessible sites unless it would be an\nundue burden or fundamental alteration to do so.  Plaintiffs maintain that these steps would afford\nthem complete relief without prejudicing the rights of private property owners.  We agree.  We find\nthat the owners of the private properties used as polling places in the City of Philadelphia are not\nnecessary and indispensable parties to this litigation because their property interests would not be\nimpaired  in  their  absence  and  because  Plaintiffs  can  achieve  complete  relief  without  their\nparticipation.  Defendants’ Motion is, accordingly, denied with respect to their argument that\nPlaintiffs have failed to name the private polling place property owners as defendants in this action.\nG. Claims Against the Board of Elections and the Individual City Commissioners\nDefendants argue that the Board of Elections and the individual City Commissioners should\nbe dismissed as Defendants in this case and suggest that the only proper Defendant would be the City\nof Philadelphia.  Defendants maintain that, under state law, City Departments, such as the Board,\ndo not have a separate corporate existence and, therefore, all suits against a department of the city\nshould be brought against the City.  See 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 16257; Philadelphia Entm’t & Dev.\nPartners, L.P. v. City of Philadelphia  939 A.2d 290, 292 (Pa. 2007) (agreeing that city “agencies\nmust be sued only in the name of the City”).  \nThe county boards of elections were established by 25 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 2625, which was\n50\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 51 of 55\nenacted on June 3, 1937.   In 1968, Article IX, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution abolished\nall of the county offices in Philadelphia and assigned the functions of those offices to the City:  “In\nPhiladelphia all county offices are hereby abolished, and the city shall henceforth perform all\nfunctions of county government within its area through officers selected in such manner as may be\nprovided by law.”  Pa. Const. Art. IX, § 13.  A later statute, 25 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1203, which\nbecame effective on March 17, 2002, created commissions to oversee voter registration.  In cities\nof the first class, of which Philadelphia is the only one, the registration commission consists of the\n“three elected commissioners of the city.”  25 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1203(b)(2).  Indeed, it is the\n“mission of the City Commissioners [of Philadelphia] to administer Voter Registration and conduct\nElections in accordance with Federal and State voter registration and election laws.”  Mission\nStatement of the Philadelphia City Commissioners, available at http://www.phillyelection.com/\nmiseng.htm (last visited August 8, 2008).  We find that Defendants have submitted ample authority\nto support their argument that the Board is a department of the Philadelphia city government and not\na separate entity and that the City, through its Commissioners, administer voter registration and\nelections.  Plaintiffs have cited no authority to the contrary.28  Defendants’ Motion is, accordingly,\ngranted to the extent that they seek dismissal of the Board. Plaintiffs are granted leave to file an\namended complaint naming the City of Philadelphia as a defendant in this case, in place of the\nBoard.\n28In opposition to Defendants’ argument, Plaintiffs rely on the fact that the Board of Elections\ndoes not appear as a department of the City in the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter and the fact that\nthe Board has been named as a defendant in two other cases:  NAACP v. Philadelphia Bd. of\nElections, Civ. A. No. 97-7085, 1998 WL 321253 (E.D. Pa. 1998) and Pennsylvania Gaming Control\nBd. v. City Council of Philadelphia, 928 A.2d 1255 (Pa. 2007).  It does not appear, however, that\nthis specific issue was considered in either of those cases.\n51\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 52 of 55\nDefendants also argue that the claims brought against the City Commissioners in their official\ncapacities should be dismissed because they are redundant of the claims brought against the Board\n(which will be replaced as a defendant by the City of Philadelphia).  Where a suit is brought against\na public officer in his official capacity, the suit is treated as if the suit were brought against the\ngovernmental entity of which he is an officer.  Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464, 471-72 (1985); see\nalso Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985) (stating that “[o]fficial capacity suits . . .\ngenerally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is\nan agent”).  Plaintiffs maintain that their claims against City Commissioners may not be redundant\nin this case because Defendants have raised the following affirmative defense: “[t]o the extent that\nthe City acts as the agent of the Commonwealth, plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the Eleventh\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.”  (Defs. Ans. and Affirmative Defenses, Affirmative\nDefense  6.)    Plaintiffs  argue  that,  if  Defendants  are  successful  in  asserting  their  Eleventh\nAmendment defense, the City Commissioners would be the only appropriate defendants remaining\nin this action, since the Eleventh Amendment does not bar state officials from being sued in their\nofficial capacities for injunctive relief.  See Koslow v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 302 F.3d\n161, 179 (3d Cir. 2002) (stating that “federal ADA claims for prospective injunctive relief against\nstate officials are authorized by the Ex parte Young doctrine”).  Moreover, although we may dismiss\nclaims asserted against officials acting in their official capacity in these circumstances, it is not\nmandatory that we do so.  See Delguerico v. Springfield Township, Civ. A. No. 02-3453, 2002 WL\n32341774, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 26,2002) (“While it is true that a claim against an official acting in\nhis official capacity is treated as a claim against the municipality, ‘this proposition does not stand\nfor the legal principle that the claims against an individual defendant in his official capacity must\n52\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 90   Filed 08/14/08   Page 53 of 55\nbe dismissed where the governmental entity or municipality is also named.’” (quoting Dieterly v.\nSorrenti, Civ. A. No. 92-4078, 1992 WL 310302, at *8 n.3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 1992))).  Consequently,\nwe decline to dismiss the claims asserted against the City Commissioners in their official capacities.\nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is, accordingly, denied with respect to their argument\nthat the claims asserted against the City Commissioners should be dismissed as redundant.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Motion is granted as to their claim that Plaintiffs have\nfailed to join a necessary party - the Commonwealth of Pennsyvlania.  Defendants’ Motion is also\ngranted as to their claim that the Board of Elections is not a proper party to this action.  Defendants’\nMotion is denied in all other respects.  Within ten days of the date of this Memorandum, Plaintiffs\nmay file an amended complaint naming the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and\nthe City of Philadelphia as Defendants.

January 29, 2008\nPlaintiffs, individuals with mobility disabilities who are registered to vote in the City of\nPhiladelphia, have brought this action against the Philadelphia Board of Elections1 and the\nCommissioners of the City of Philadelphia in charge of elections, alleging that Defendants have\nviolated their civil rights under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. § 12131-12134, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the “RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a),\nby denying them equal and integrated access to neighborhood polling places in Philadelphia.\nCurrently before us is Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Complaint.  For the reasons that follow,\nthe Motion is denied.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe six named Plaintiffs in this action are Philadelphia residents with mobility disabilities\nwho are registered to vote and would like to vote at their assigned neighborhood polling places.\n(Compl. ¶ 1.)  They claim that they are unable to do so because those polling places are inaccessible\nto individuals with mobility disabilities.  (Id. ¶¶ 7-12.)  The Complaint alleges that more than 400\nof Philadelphia’s 1600 polling locations are not accessible to persons with mobility impairments who\n1The Philadelphia Board of Elections was incorrectly designated as the “Philadelphia Board\nof Election” in the Complaint.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 2 of 18\ncannot readily walk up and down steps and that Defendants have failed to select and provide\naccessible polling places, in violation of Title II of the ADA and § 504 of the RA.  (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.)\nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to require Defendants to make all polling places\naccessible to voters with mobility disabilities.  (Id.)\nThe Complaint alleges that each Plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability as defined\nin the ADA and RA. (Id. ¶ 31.)  In order for a mobility impaired individual to vote in person, his or\nher neighborhood polling place must have an accessible path of travel to an accessible voting\nmachine.  (Id. ¶ 27.)  Plaintiff Kerrigan is registered to vote and has used a wheelchair since 2003.\n(Id. ¶ 7.)  She has been assigned to a polling place that is inaccessible because it has steps.  (Id.)\nPlaintiff Holiday uses a wheelchair and has been registered to vote since 2004.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  He has\nbeen assigned to a polling place that is inaccessible because it has steps.  (Id.)  Plaintiff McShea is\nregistered to vote and has used a wheelchair since 2004.  (Id. ¶ 9.)  He has been assigned to a polling\nplace that is listed as an accessible garage but voting actually takes place in a basement that is\ninaccessible because it has steps.  (Id..)  Plaintiff Mangum became eligible to vote in 2006 and\nbecame disabled in 2006.  (Id. ¶ 10.)  He uses a wheelchair and has been assigned to a polling place\nthat is inaccessible because it has steps.  (Id.)  Plaintiff Crosby is registered to vote and began using\na wheelchair in 2006.  (Id. ¶ 11.)  She has been assigned to a polling place that is inaccessible\nbecause it has steps.  (Id.)  Plaintiff Davenport is registered to vote and recently started using a\nmotorized wheelchair.  (Id. ¶ 12.)  She has been assigned to a polling place that uses an entrance that\nis inaccessible due to steps.  (Id.)  The polling place Davenport has been assigned to has an\naccessible entrance, but that entrance was locked for the November 2006 election.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs\nhave brought this lawsuit as a class action on behalf of all persons who are residents of Philadelphia\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 3 of 18\nCounty who are (1) eligible to vote, (2) have mobility impairments that prevent them from gaining\nindependent access to vote in inaccessible neighborhood polling places, and (3) either became\neligible to vote or developed a mobility disability after October 22, 2001.  (Id. ¶ 15.) \nThe Complaint further alleges that Philadelphia County has 66 wards, each of which are\ndivided into multiple divisions, each of which is assigned a unique polling place.  (Id. ¶ 23.)  There\nare more than 1600 polling places in Philadelphia.  (Id.)  Defendants assign voters to a ward and\ndivision based on their residence.  (Id.)  Registered voters are required to vote in the polling places\nto which they have been assigned by Defendants.  (Id.)  As a result of a previous lawsuit, hundreds\nof inaccessible neighborhood polling places have been relocated to accessible locations or ramped\nwith permanent or temporary ramps using federal funds.  (Id. ¶ 24.)  However, there are still more\nthan 400 inaccessible polling places.  (Id.)  Many of these inaccessible polling places could have\nbeen moved to accessible locations or could be made accessible with simple modifications.  (Id. ¶¶\n25-26.)\nThe Complaint asserts the following seven claims: (1) Defendants have discriminated against\nPlaintiffs, and the members of the class they seek to represent, based on their mobility disabilities\nby excluding them from participation in, and denying them the benefits of, their services, programs,\nand activities, specifically access to polling places and the voting process in a manner that is\navailable to non-disabled people, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. §\n35.130(a), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Id. ¶ 34); (2) Defendants have denied or failed to afford to\nPlaintiffs and class members the opportunity to participate in and benefit from their services,\nprograms, and activities, specifically voting in polling places in the same manner as non-disabled\npeople, on the basis of their mobility disabilities, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 4 of 18\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1), and the RA, 28 C.F.R. § 794 (Id. ¶ 35); (3) Defendants have used methods\nof administration that have the effect of subjecting individuals with mobility disabilities to\ndiscrimination based on those disabilities, specifically allowing certain people to veto decisions to\nmove inaccessible polling locations to accessible polling locations, thereby defeating or substantially\nimpairing the accomplishments of the program’s objectives to facilitate voting in violation of the\nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Id. ¶ 36); (4)\nDefendants have located polling places in a manner that excludes individuals with mobility\ndisabilities from the benefits of Defendants’ programs, services or activities, specifically providing\naccess to polling places and the voting process, and have had the effect of defeating or substantially\nimpairing the objectives of those programs, services or activities in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(4), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Id. ¶ 37); (5) Defendants have\nfailed to make reasonable modifications in their policies, practices and procedures concerning\ninaccessible polling places that are necessary to avoid discrimination against individuals with\nmobility disabilities, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), and\nthe RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Id. ¶ 38); (6) Defendants have failed to administer their services, programs\nand activities, specifically providing access to polling places and the voting process, in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of individuals with mobility disabilities, in violation of\nthe ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Id. ¶ 39); and\n(7) Defendants have failed to assure that each polling place is readily accessible to and usable by\nindividuals with mobility disabilities, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. §\n35.150, and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Id. ¶ 40).  Defendants have moved to dismiss the Complaint\nin its entirety pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 5 of 18\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nWhen deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court may look only to the\nfacts alleged in the complaint and its attachments.  Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O’Brien & Frankel,\n20 F.3d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir. 1994).  The court must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint and view them in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff.  Angelastro v. Prudential-Bache\nSec., Inc., 764 F.2d 939, 944 (3d Cir. 1985).  However, the court “need not credit a complaint’s ‘bald\nassertions’ or ‘legal conclusions.’”  California Pub. Employee Ret. Sys. v. The Chubb Corp., 394\nF.3d 126,143 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing Morse v. Lower Merion School Dist.,132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir.\n1997)).  A Rule 12(b)(6) motion will be granted when a Plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts,\nconsistent with the complaint, which would entitle him or her to relief.  Ransom v. Marrazzo, 848\nF.2d 398, 401 (3d Cir. 1988).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nDefendants assert three grounds for dismissal of the Complaint.  Defendants argue that the\nADA and RA do not require that each of Philadelphia’s 1600 polling places be accessible to voters\nwith mobility disabilities and that the City complies with the ADA and RA by making the program\nof voting accessible.  Defendants further argue that the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and\nHandicapped Act (the “VAEH”), 42 U.S.C.A. § 1973ee, et seq., and the Help America Vote Act\n(“HAVA”), 42 U.S.C. § 15301, et seq., take precedence over the ADA and RA and neither the\nVAEH nor HAVA require that each of Philadelphia’s polling places be accessible.  Defendants also\nargue that this action is barred by the January 9, 2007 settlement agreement entered into by the\nparties to Nat’l Org. on Disability v. Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa.) (“Tartaglione”).\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 6 of 18\nA. Program Accessibility\nAccess to polling places constitutes a service, program, or activity for purposes of Title II of\nthe ADA.  See Meadows v. Hudson County Bd. of Elections, Civ. A. No. 04-3979, 2006 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 64050, at *14 (D.N.J. Aug. 24, 2006) (noting that “access to polling places constitutes a\nservice, program, or activity”) (citing People of New York ex rel. Spitzer v. County of Delaware, 82\nF. Supp. 2d 12, 17-18 (N.D.N.Y. 2000))).  However, Defendants contend that the Complaint should\nbe dismissed because the ADA and RA require “only that Plaintiffs be allowed to participate in the\nactivity of voting, not that each and every polling place be accessible.”  (Defs. Mem. at 7.)\nDefendants rely on Am. Assoc. of People with Disabilities v. Shelley, 324 F. Supp. 2d 1120 (C.D.\nCa. 2004), which examined whether the California Secretary of State’s decertification of certain\nelectronic voting machines (the “DREs”) violated the ADA by preventing some visually and\nmanually disabled voters from voting independently via those voting machines.  Id. at 1123-25.  The\ncourt denied plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction because the evidence did not “support\nthe conclusion that the elimination of the DREs would have a discriminatory effect on the visually\nor manually impaired.”  Id. at 1126.  The court went on to note that “the ADA does not require\naccommodation that would enable disabled persons to vote in a manner that is comparable in every\nway with the voting rights enjoyed by persons without disabilities. Rather, it mandates that voting\nprograms be made accessible, giving a disabled person the opportunity to vote.”  Id.  We find that\nShelley is inapplicable to the instant case, as the Shelley court did not consider whether the failure\nto provide accessible polling places violated the ADA and RA but rather considered, in the context\nof a motion for preliminary injunction, whether the plaintiff had made a sufficient showing that the\nelimination of certain voting machines would discriminate against certain visually and manually\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 7 of 18\nimpaired voters.  See Meadows v. Hudson County Bd. of Elections, Civ. A. No. 04-3979, 2006 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 64050, at *30 n.4 (D.N.J. Aug. 24, 2006) (rejecting Hudson County’s reliance on\nShelley in defense of Meadows’ claim that she had been denied the right to vote in violation of the\nADA because she had been assigned to an inaccessible polling place).  \nDefendants also  rely on N.A.A.C.P. v. Philadelphia Bd. of Elections, Civ. A. No. 97-7085,\n1998 WL 321253 (E.D. Pa. 1998), in which the district court stated that Defendants’ use of\nalternative ballot procedures is a reasonable modification to comply with the ADA and fulfills their\nobligations under the ADA.  Id. at *3.  The issue in N.A.A.C.P. was whether the City of Philadelphia\ncould use its alternative ballot procedures, promulgated to comply with the VAEH, in state and local\nelections.  The N.A.A.C.P. argued that the alternative ballot procedures should not be used in non-\nfederal elections because they create the opportunity for fraud.  Id. at *5.  Defendants countered that\nthey were using the procedures to comply with their obligations under the ADA.  Id. at *3.  The court\nconcluded that:  “Defendants are not required to provide the specific procedure authorized under the\nVAEH, but the decision to do so is a reasonable modification to comply with the ADA and 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(b)(7).”  Id. at *4.   However, the specific issue at the center of this case, whether the ADA\nrequires Defendants to take additional steps to avoid discrimination and provide equal access to the\nvoting process, was not before the N.A.A.C.P. court.  Consequently, N.A.A.C.P. v. Philadelphia Bd.\nof Elections is not controlling here.\nDefendants also contend that the regulations which implement Title II of the ADA do not\nrequire that a public entity make all of its facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities, just that\nall of its programs be made accessible.  Defendants rely on 28 C.F.R. § 35.150 which states, in\nrelevant part:\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 8 of 18\n(a) General. A public entity shall operate each service, program, or\nactivity so that the service, program, or activity, when viewed in its\nentirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with\ndisabilities. This paragraph does not--\n(1) Necessarily require a public entity to make each of its existing\nfacilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities; . .\n. .\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150.  Defendants maintain that they have implemented alternative voting procedures\nwhich ensure that Philadelphia’s program of voting is accessible to individuals with mobility\ndisabilities, thereby satisfying their obligations under the ADA.2   Defendants point to the fact that\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania allows county boards of elections to designate certain polling\nplaces as inaccessible under the following conditions:\nFor those county boards of elections that inform the Secretary of the\nCommonwealth that, despite their good faith efforts to survey all\npotential polling places in each election district, they have been\nunable to locate an accessible polling place for every election district\nin the county or to make the polling places temporarily accessible for\nElection Day, the Secretary of the Commonwealth has directed the\ncounty boards of elections formally to designate as “inaccessible”\nthose polling places that do not satisfy the guidelines issued by the\nSecretary of the Commonwealth for accessibility.\n2Defendants have submitted two documents, one of which was downloaded and printed from\na website maintained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Defs.  Ex. A) and the other from a\nwebsite maintained by the Philadelphia City Commissioners (Defs. Ex. B), that contain those\nalternative voting procedures. Defendants maintain that we may consider these documents in\nconnection with their Motion to Dismiss because they constitute public statements of the activities\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of the Philadelphia Board of Election.  (Defs.’ Mem. at\n5 n.3.)  We find that these documents are public records which we may consider in the context of\nDefendants’ Motion.  See Maule v. Susquehanna Regional Police Comm’n, Civ. A. No. 04-05933,\n2007 WL 2844587, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 27, 2007) (noting that the court may consider public records\nin deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), “including court files, orders,\nrecords and letters of official actions or decisions of government agencies and administrative bodies”\n(citing Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 38 F.3d 1380, 1384 n.2 (3d Cir. 1995))).\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 9 of 18\n(Defs. Ex. A § 3(b).)  Additionally, an individual who has been assigned to vote in a polling location\nthat has been designated as inaccessible by the county board of elections may vote by Absentee or\nAlternative Ballot.  (Id. §§ 5, 7-10; Defs. Ex. B.)  \nPlaintiffs argue that the alternative voting procedures promulgated by the Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Board of Elections do not satisfy all of Defendants’ obligations\nunder the ADA and RA because the procedures are not an effective means to provide equivalent\naccess to the voting process for voters with disabilities.  Plaintiffs argue that these procedures are\nmore burdensome to voters with mobility disabilities because, except in emergency situations, they\nmust apply for absentee or alternative ballots one week prior to the election and must vote prior to\nthe election or travel to Philadelphia City Hall to return their alternative ballots on election day.  (See\nDefs. Exs. A, B.)  Plaintiffs also contend that the alternative ballot process is more burdensome and\nintrusive than the voting process used by non-disabled voters, and cannot satisfy the ADA, because\nthe alternative process requires voters with mobility disabilities to disclose private medical\ninformation not required of non-disabled voters in their applications for absentee or alternative\nballots.  (See Pls. Exs. A, B.)3  Plaintiffs further contend that requiring voting in advance of election\nday, or requiring voters to travel to City Hall to submit their alternative ballots, as described above,\nis not as effective as or equivalent to voting in one’s assigned neighborhood polling place.  We find\nthat we cannot determine, on the limited record before us on this Motion to Dismiss, whether the\nalternative  voting  procedures  promulgated  by  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and  the\nPhiladelphia Board of Elections effectively provide equivalent access to the voting process for voters\n3Plaintiffs’ Exhibits A and B are copies of applications for absentee and alternative ballots.\nWe find that these are public records which we may consider in connection with the instant Motion.\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 10 of 18\nwith disabilities and, thus, satisfy Defendants’ obligations under the ADA and RA.\nConsequently, we find that Plaintiffs’ claims that they have been discriminated against based\non their mobility disabilities by exclusion from participation in and denial of the benefits of access\nto polling places and the voting process in a manner that is available to non-disabled voters state\ncognizable claims for violation of the ADA and the RA.  See Westchester Disabled on the Move v.\nCounty of Westchester, 346 F. Supp. 2d 473, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (“Failing to ensure that disabled\nindividuals are able to vote in person and at their assigned polling places--presumably the most\ncommonly used method of voting--could not reasonably be construed as consistent with providing\n‘meaningful access’ to the voting process, particularly where the alternatives relied upon by the\nDefendants impose additional costs, risks and inconveniences on disabled voters not faced by\nothers.”) Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Complaint is therefore denied as to Defendants’\nargument that the Complaint must be dismissed because the ADA and RA require only that Plaintiffs\nbe allowed to participate in the program of voting, not that each and every polling place be\naccessible.4\n4Defendants also rely on a technical assistance letter written by the Department of Justice\n(“DOJ”) in 1998.  This letter was written to the Arkansas State Board of Election Commissioners\nin response to queries about the accessibility of polling locations in Arkansas.  DOJ, Letter to Judy\nSteelman (Aug. 3, 1998), http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/ltr216.htm.  In response to a query about\nreassigning disabled voters from inaccessible to accessible polling locations, the letter states:  “Your\nreassignment alternative is permissible under the ADA so long as the reassignment alternative is\neffective in providing a person with a disability the equal opportunity to cast a ballot on the day of\nthe election.  For example, in a State-wide election, having equal numbers of accessible and\ninaccessible polling sites that are dispersed appropriately throughout the State would meet the\nrequirements of Title II of the ADA, whereas having only a few accessible polling sites would not.”\nId.  Defendants ask us to find, based upon this letter, that Philadelphia’s program of voting satisfies\nthe ADA because more than half of the City’s polling places are accessible to individuals with\nmobility disabilities.  Although, this letter, by its own terms, provided only “informal guidance to\nassist [the State Board of Election Commissioners] in understanding the ADA’s requirements” and\ndid not “constitute a legal interpretation or legal advice, and [was] not binding on the Department,”\n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 11 of 18\nB. The VAEH and HAVA\nDefendants next claim that the ADA, RA, VAEH and HAVA all address the same subject\nmatter, the rights of the disabled.  They further argue that neither the VAEH nor HAVA require that\nall polling places be accessible.  They contend, accordingly, that the VAEH and HAVA, which are\nmore specific with respect to the voting rights of the disabled, conflict with, and should be given\nprecedence over, the ADA and RA.  Defendants maintain that their implementation and use of\nalternative voting procedures in Philadelphia complies with the VAEH and HAVA and, therefore,\nthis case should be dismissed.  \nThe VAEH specifically allows that a disabled voter, who is assigned to polling place that has\nbeen designated as inaccessible in accordance with procedures promulgated by the Commonwealth\nof Pennsylvania, may be provided with an alternative ballot.  The VAEH provides, in relevant part,\nas follows:  \n(a) Accessibility to all polling places as responsibility of each\npolitical subdivision\nWithin each State, except as provided in subsection (b) of this\nsection,  each  political  subdivision  responsible  for  conducting\nelections shall assure that all polling places for Federal elections are\naccessible to handicapped and elderly voters.\nid., the views of the DOJ explaining the responsibilities of the states in implementing the ADA are\nentitled to deference.  See  Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 646 (1998) (“As the agency directed\nby Congress to issue implementing regulations, see 42 U.S.C. § 12186(b), to render technical\nassistance explaining the responsibilities of covered individuals and institutions, § 12206(c), and to\nenforce Title III in court, § 12188(b), the Department’s views are entitled to deference.” (citing\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984))).  However, we\nfind that the letter’s statement that reassignment would be appropriate if there were an equal number\nof accessible and inaccessible polling places dispersed appropriately across the State is not\ncontrolling in this case, because this case does not involve the reassignment of disabled voters to\naccessible  polling  places.    To  the  contrary,  the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  prohibits\nreassignment of disabled voters to accessible polling places.  (Defs. Ex. A § 4(6).) \n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 12 of 18\n(b) Exception\nSubsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a polling place--\n(1) in the case of an emergency, as determined by the chief election\nofficer of the State; or\n(2) if the chief election officer of the State--\n(A) determines that all potential polling places have been surveyed\nand  no  such  accessible  place  is  available,  nor  is  the  political\nsubdivision able to make one temporarily accessible, in the area\ninvolved; and\n(B) assures that any handicapped or elderly voter assigned to an\ninaccessible  polling  place,  upon  advance  request  of  such  voter\n(pursuant to procedures established by the chief election officer of the\nState)--\n(i) will be assigned to an accessible polling place, or\n(ii) will be provided with an alternative means for casting a ballot on\nthe day of the election.\n42 U.S.C.A. § 1973ee-1.  Defendants contend that Philadelphia’s provision of alternate voting\nprocedures to mobility impaired voters satisfies the VAEH and, to the extent the ADA and RA\nrequire more, they conflict with the VAEH.  “It is a well-established canon of statutory construction\nthat when two statutes cover the same situation [and they conflict], the more specific statute takes\nprecedence over the more general one.”  Coady v. Vaughn, 251 F.3d 480, 484 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing\nEdmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 657 (1997); Preiser v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 475, 488-89\n(1973) and West v. Keve, 721 F.2d 91, 96 (3d Cir.1983)); see also Edmond v. United States, 520\nU.S. 651, 657 (1997) (“Ordinarily, where a specific provision conflicts with a general one, the\nspecific governs.”  (citing Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 406 (1980))).   \nThe Complaint does not allege any facts which would allow us to infer that either of the\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 13 of 18\nexceptions to the requirement of the VAEH that “each political subdivision responsible for\nconducting elections shall assure that all polling places for Federal elections are accessible to\nhandicapped and elderly voters,” 42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1(a) (emphasis added), exists in connection\nwith all of the more than 400 polling places Plaintiffs contend are inaccessible.  (Compl. ¶ 3.)\nConsequently, we cannot find, in the context of this Motion to Dismiss, that there is any conflict in\nthe  instant  case  between  the  accessibility  requirements  of  the  VAEH  and  the  accessibility\nrequirements of the ADA and RA.\nFurthermore, Congress intended the ADA to encompass voting.  Am. Ass’n of People with\nDisabilities v. Hood, 278 F. Supp. 2d 1345, 1356 (M.D. Fla. 2003).  Moreover, the ADA contains\na provision explaining how it is to be construed with respect to other laws:  “[n]othing in this Act\nshall be construed to invalidate or limit the remedies, rights, and procedures of any Federal law or\nlaw of any State or political subdivision of any State or jurisdiction that provides greater or equal\nprotection for the rights of individuals with disabilities than are afforded by this Act.”  42 U.S.C. §\n12201(b).  The application of the ADA to require Defendants to maximize the number of polling\nplaces that are accessible to individuals with mobility impairments would not invalidate or limit the\nremedies provided by the VAEH, instead, “the application of the ADA sought by Plaintiffs would\nprovide broader rights or remedies than provided by . . . the VAEH.”  Hood, 278 F. Supp. 2d at 1356.\nWe find, accordingly, that there is no conflict between the ADA and the VAEH with respect to\npolling place accessibility in the context of this case. \n   Defendants further argue that § 301(a)(3)(A) of HAVA conflicts with, and takes precedence\nover the ADA and RA, because it requires only that voting equipment be accessible and does not\nrequire that polling places be accessible.  Section 301(a)(3)(A) of HAVA requires that voting\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 14 of 18\nsystems used in federal elections “be accessible for individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual\naccessibility for the blind and visually impaired, in a manner that provides the same opportunity for\naccess and participation (including privacy and independence) as for other voters . . . .”  42 U.S.C.\n§ 15481(a)(3)(A).  The DOJ has addressed whether HAVA requires that polling places be accessible\nin a non-binding technical assistance letter.  In March 2005, in response to a letter from the\nMississippi Assistant Secretary of State for Elections, the DOJ considered whether the temporary\nreassignment of disabled voters to accessible polling places in Mississippi, while all of Mississippi’s\npolling places were made accessible, complied with HAVA.  DOJ, Letter to John W. Eads (Mar. 4,\n2005), http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/hava/ms-disability.htm.  In the letter, the DOJ noted that\nHAVA requires that polling places, as well as voting machines, be accessible because:\nlogically, persons with disabilities must be able to gain access to the\npolling place in order to be able to use the accessible voting system.\nHaving an accessible voting system does little good if voters cannot\nenter the polling place to use it. Hence, not only must the voting\nsystem be accessible to persons with disabilities but also the polling\nplace where the voting system is located.\nId.  As we must give deference to the view of the DOJ, Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 646\n(1998), we find that there is no conflict between the accessibility requirements of HAVA and of the\nADA and RA with respect to polling place accessibility in this case.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss\nthe Complaint is therefore denied as to their argument that the Complaint must be dismissed because\nthe VAEH and HAVA conflict with and take precedence over the requirements of the ADA and RA\nas to the accessibility of polling locations.\nC. The Previous Settlement Agreement\nDefendants also argue that this action is barred by the January 9, 2007 Settlement Agreement\n14\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 15 of 18\nin Tartaglione.   “Basic contract principles apply to the review of settlement agreements.”  Flemming\nv. Air Sunshine, 311 F.3d 282, 289 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing In re Cendant Corp. Prides Litig., 233 F.3d\n188, 193 (3d Cir. 2000)).  “Pennsylvania contract law begins with the ‘firmly settled’ point that ‘the\nintent of the parties to a written contract is contained in the writing itself.’”  Bohler-Uddeholm Am.,\nInc. v. Ellwood Group, Inc., 247 F.3d 79, 93 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting Krizovensky v. Krizovensky,\n624 A.2d 638, 642 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993)).  Where the language of the contract is “clear and\nunequivocal,” its meaning “‘must be determined by its contents alone.’”  Id. (quoting Steuart v.\nMcChesney, 444 A.2d 659, 661 (Pa. 1982)).\nPlaintiffs in Tartaglione claimed that the “Commissioners of the City of Philadelphia in\ncharge of elections and the purchase of voting machines” violated their civil rights under the ADA\nand the RA, “by denying them equal and integrated access to polling places and accessible voting\nmachines.”  Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  16731, at *1-*2 (E.D. Pa.\nOct. 11, 2001).  On October 22, 2001, we certified the following subclasses in that case:  “(1) all\nmobility impaired individuals, including those that use a wheelchair to ambulate, and who are\nregistered to vote in the City of Philadelphia; and (2) all blind or visually impaired individuals who\nare registered to vote in the City of Philadelphia.”  Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923, 2001 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 16932, at *15 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 2001).  The parties to that case settled their claims by\nentering into a Settlement Agreement which was approved on November 21, 2003.  Order,\nTartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2003).  Although we approved the parties’\nSettlement Agreement, we denied their request that we certify a settlement class that would have\nexpanded the subclasses to include all mobility and visually impaired individuals “who are registered\nto vote or who are eligible or will become eligible to be registered to vote in the City of Philadelphia\n15\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 16 of 18\n. . . .”  See id. ¶ 4; Plaintiff’s Mem. of Law in Support of Mot. for Certification of the Settlement\nClass at 6, Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 3, 2003).  Consequently, the subclass\nof plaintiffs with mobility disabilities in Tartaglione was limited to individuals with mobility\ndisabilities who had registered to vote in the City of Philadelphia by October 22, 2001.  \nThe January 9, 2007 Settlement Agreement resolved the Tartaglione plaintiffs’ First Motion\nfor Attorneys’ Fees, which was filed on October 19, 2006.  In consideration for the defendants’\nagreement to pay their attorneys’ fees, the plaintiffs in that case agreed as follows:\nthat they will not seek to enforce or otherwise bring any further\nmotions, applications or other action whatsoever relating to the\nNovember 4, 2003, settlement agreement or underlying Litigation;\nprovided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the\nright of plaintiffs to bring a new action relating to any future election.\nSettlement Agreement ¶4, Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 7, 2007).  Defendants\ncontend that this provision of the January 7, 2007 Settlement Agreement thereby barred Plaintiffs\nfrom bringing the instant litigation because no election took place between January 7, 2007 and the\nfiling of the instant lawsuit on February 21, 2007 and because the instant Complaint does not allege\nany other change in conditions since January 7, 2007.\nAlthough  Defendants  are  correct  that  the  January  7,  2007  Settlement  Agreement  in\nTartaglione barred the plaintiffs and members of the two certified subclasses from filing additional\nlawsuits relating to the claims asserted in that case, the named Plaintiffs in the instant lawsuit, and\nthe class they seek to represent, were not plaintiffs or members of either subclass in that case.  None\nof the Plaintiffs in this action were both mobility impaired and registered to vote in the City of\nPhiladelphia on October 22, 2001.  Consequently, they were not members of the mobility impaired\nsubclass in Tartaglione and they are not bound by the January 7, 2007 Settlement Agreement in that\n16\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 17 of 18\ncase.  See Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793,  798 (1996) (“‘[A] judgment or decree among\nparties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them, but it does not conclude the rights of strangers\nto those proceedings.’”  (quoting Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 761-762 (1989))).5  Defendants’\nMotion to Dismiss the Complaint is therefore denied as to their argument that this action is barred\nby the January 9, 2007 Settlement Agreement in  Tartaglione.6\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is denied.  An appropriate\norder follows.\n5There is, of course, an exception to the rule that a judgment in one lawsuit does not bind a\nnonparty to the lawsuit:  “when it can be said that there is ‘privity’ between a party to the second case\nand a party who is bound by an earlier judgment.”  Richards, 517 U.S. at 798.  As the record before\nus on this Motion to Dismiss is limited to the allegations of the Complaint, there is no basis on which\nwe can determine, in the context of this Motion, whether the exception applies.\n6Although we have determined, based upon the record before us on this Motion to Dismiss,\nthat the Plaintiffs in this action are not bound by the January 9, 2007 Settlement Agreement in\nTartaglione, we also recognize that performance by the Defendants of their obligations under the\noriginal Settlement Agreement in that case would render moot the claims alleged in the instant\nComplaint.  We further note that both Plaintiffs and the taxpayers of the City of Philadelphia would\nbenefit from the most cost effective resolution of the issues asserted in this case.\n17\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 39   Filed 01/29/08   Page 18 of 18\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\nKATHLEEN KERRIGAN, ET AL. : CIVIL ACTION\n  :\nv.   :\n  :\nTHE PHILADELPHIA BOARD  :\nOF ELECTION, ET AL.   : NO. 07-687\nO R D E R\nAND NOW, this 29th day of January, 2008, upon consideration of Defendants’ Motion to\nDismiss (Docket No. 6) and all documents filed in connection therewith, IT IS HEREBY\nORDERED that the Motion is DENIED.\nBY THE COURT:\n/s/ John R.

March 13, 2008\nPlaintiffs, individuals with mobility disabilities who are registered to vote in the City of\nPhiladelphia,  have  brought  this  action  against  the  Philadelphia  Board  of  Elections  and  the\nCommissioners of the City of Philadelphia in charge of elections, alleging that Defendants have\nviolated their civil rights under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), 42\nU.S.C. § 12131-12134, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the “RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a),\nby denying them equal and integrated access to neighborhood polling places in Philadelphia.  The\nComplaint alleges that more than 400 of Philadelphia’s 1600 polling locations are not accessible to\npersons with mobility impairments who cannot readily walk up and down steps and that Defendants\nhave failed to select and provide accessible polling places.  (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.)  Plaintiffs seek declaratory\nand injunctive relief requiring Defendants to make all polling places accessible to voters with\nmobility disabilities.  (Id.)  Three of the Plaintiffs, Kathleen Kerrigan, Tariq Mangum, and Michael\nMcShea, seek to represent a class of similarly situated Philadelphia County voters with mobility\ndisabilities who either developed a mobility disability or became eligible to vote after October 22,\n2001.1\n1The Complaint was brought by six Plaintiffs.  One of those Plaintiffs, Renee Crosby, was\nvoluntarily dismissed as a Plaintiff on January 30, 2008.  (1/30/08 Notice of Voluntary Dismissal.)\nPlaintiffs have indicated their agreement with Defendants that Plaintiff Carolyn Davenport is not a\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 2 of 14\nI. LEGAL STANDARD\nTo obtain class certification, Plaintiffs must meet all four requirements of Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23(a) and at least one part of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b).  Baby Neal v.\nCasey, 43 F.3d 48, 55 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing Wetzel v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 508 F.2d 239 (3d Cir.\n1975)).  “[I]n determining whether a class will be certified, the substantive allegations of the\ncomplaint must be taken as true.”   Chiang v. Veneman, 385 F.3d 256, 262 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing\nEisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974)).  We are not, however, limited to the\npleadings.  See Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 168-69 (3d Cir.\n2001) (“In reviewing a motion for class certification, a preliminary inquiry into the merits is\nsometimes necessary to determine whether the alleged claims can be properly resolved as a class\naction.”).  Nonetheless, “it is not necessary for the plaintiffs to establish the merits of their case at\nthe class certification stage.”  Chiang, 385 F.3d at 262.  Moreover, when doubt exists concerning\ncertification of the class, the court should err in favor of allowing the case to proceed as a class\naction.  Behrend v. Comcast Corp., Civ. A. No. 03-6604, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75186, at *6-*7\n(E.D. Pa. Oct. 10, 2007) (citing Eisenberg v. Gagnon, 766 F.2d 770, 785 (3d Cir. 1985)).  \nThe four requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied only if: \n1)  the  class  is  so  numerous  that  joinder  of  all  members  is\nimpracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical  of  the  claims  or  defenses  of  the  class;  and  (4)  the\nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests\nof the class.\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Plaintiffs allege that the proposed class is maintainable pursuant to Federal\nmember of the proposed class and that Plaintiff Anthony Holiday should not serve as a class\nrepresentative in this case.  (Pls. Reply Mem. at 2.) \n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 3 of 14\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) which requires that: “the party opposing the class has acted or\nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole . . . .”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(b)(2).  Defendants argue that class certification should be denied because Plaintiffs do not satisfy\nthe third and fourth requirements of Rule 23(a) relating to the adequacy of the class representatives\nand the typicality of their claims.\nII. DISCUSSION\nA. Rule 23(a)\n1. Numerosity\nPlaintiffs contend that the class they seek to represent comprises approximately 2,970\nPhiladelphia County voters who became eligible to vote, or developed mobility disabilities, since\nOctober 22, 2001.  (Pls. Mem. at 8-9.)2  There is no minimum number necessary to satisfy the\n2The beginning date for the class is important because, on October 22, 2001, we certified the\nfollowing subclasses in Nat’l Org. on Disability v. Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa.)\n(“Tartaglione”):  “(1) all mobility impaired individuals, including those that use a wheelchair to\nambulate, and who are registered to vote in the City of Philadelphia; and (2) all blind or visually\nimpaired individuals who are registered to vote in the City of Philadelphia.”  Tartaglione, Civ. A.\nNo. 01-1923, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16932, at *15 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 2001).  The Tartaglione\nplaintiffs, like the Plaintiffs in this case, claimed that the “Commissioners of the City of Philadelphia\nin charge of elections . . .” violated their civil rights under the ADA and the RA, “by denying them\nequal and integrated access to polling places and accessible voting machines.”  Tartaglione, Civ. A.\nNo. 01-1923, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  16731, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 11, 2001).  The Tartaglione parties\nsettled their claims by entering into a Settlement Agreement which was approved on November 21,\n2003.  Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2003) (Order approving Settlement\nAgreement).  On January 9, 2007, the Tartaglione parties entered into a  Settlement Agreement\nresolving the Tartaglione plaintiffs’ First Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, which was filed on October\n19, 2006.  In consideration for the defendants’ agreement to pay their attorneys’ fees, the plaintiffs\nin that case agreed as follows:\nthat they will not seek to enforce or otherwise bring any further\nmotions, applications or other action whatsoever relating to the\nNovember 4, 2003, settlement agreement or underlying Litigation;\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 4 of 14\nnumerosity requirement.  See Moskokwitz v. Lopp, 128 F.R.D. 624, 628 (E.D. Pa. 1989).  The\nstatute does not require “any particular number or require that joinder of all members be impossible,\nso long as a good faith estimate of the number of class members is provided.”  Stewart v.  Associates\nConsumer Discount Co., 183 F.R.D. 189, 194 (E.D. Pa. 1998).  The Court may use common sense\nassumptions to support a finding of numerosity.  Id.  Common sense dictates that where the class\nnumbers in the thousands that “joinder of all would be impracticable and that the numerosity\nrequirement has been satisfied.”  Id.  We find that Plaintiffs have provided a good faith estimate of\nthe  size  of  the  class,  which  at  nearly  3,000  individuals  makes  joinder  impracticable  and,\nconsequently, that the numerosity requirement is met in this case.\n2. Commonality and typicality\n“Commonality does not require an identity of claims or facts among class members; instead,\n‘the commonality requirement will be satisfied if the named plaintiffs share at least one question of\nfact or law with the grievances of the prospective class.’”  Johnston v. HBO Film Mgmt., 265 F.3d\n178, 184 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting In re the Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., 148 F.3d\n283, 310 (3d Cir. 1998) and Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56).  “Rule 23(b)(2) classes seeking injunctive\nrelief ‘by their very nature often present common questions satisfying Rule 23(a)(2).’”  Duffy v.\nMassinari, 202 F.R.D. 437, 442 (E.D. Pa. June 15, 2001) (quoting Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 56); see\nprovided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the\nright of plaintiffs to bring a new action relating to any future election.\nTartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 7, 2007) (Settlement Agreement ¶4).  Consequently,\nindividuals who were members in the mobility disability subclass in Tartaglione would be unable\nto participate as members of the class in this case.  The class in this case has, accordingly, been\nlimited to individuals who either became eligible to vote in Philadelphia after October 22, 2001 or\ndeveloped mobility disabilities after October 22, 2001 and could not have been members of the\nmobility disability subclass in Tartaglione.\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 5 of 14\nalso Dittimus-Bey v. Taylor, 244 F.R.D. 284, 290 (D.N.J. 2007) (same).  \nTo satisfy the typicality requirement, “the claims of the class representatives must be typical\nof the class as a whole.”  Johnston, 265 F.3d at 184.  Typicality “entails an inquiry [into] whether\n‘the named plaintiff’s individual circumstances are markedly different or . . . the legal theory upon\nwhich the claims are based differs from that upon which the claims of other class members will\nperforce be based.’”  Eisenberg, 766 F.2d at 786 (quoting Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 805\nn.36 (3d Cir. 1984)).  Even if there are pronounced factual differences among the plaintiffs, typicality\nis satisfied as long as there is a strong similarity of legal theories and the named plaintiffs do not\nhave unique circumstances.  See Johnston, 265 F.3d at 184 (“Indeed, so long as the claims of the\nnamed plaintiffs and putative class members involve the same conduct by the defendant, typicality\nis established regardless of factual differences.”) (quotation omitted); Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 58\n(“Where an action challenges a policy or practice, the named plaintiffs suffering one specific injury\nfrom the practice can represent a class suffering other injuries, so long as all the injuries are shown\nto result from the practice.”); Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co. Inc., 980 F.2d 912, 923 (3d Cir.\n1992) (“‘[F]actual differences will not render a claim atypical if the claim arises from the same event\nor practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class members, and if it is based\non the same legal theory.’” (quoting Grasty v. Amalgamated Clothing & Textile Workers Union, 828\nF.2d 123 (3d Cir. 1987))).  Typical does not mean identical, and if necessary a court may sever\nclaims or use subclasses to treat individual issues separately.  Eisenberg, 766 F.2d at 786.  \nPlaintiffs maintain that the commonality requirement is satisfied in this case because they\nhave the following questions of law or fact in common with the members of the proposed class:\nwhether the remaining inaccessible Philadelphia polling places can be made accessible or moved to\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 6 of 14\naccessible locations; whether Defendants allow others to veto decisions to relocate inaccessible\npolling places; whether Defendants violate the ADA and RA by excluding Plaintiffs and class\nmembers from the voting process and failing to afford them equal opportunity to participate in the\npolling process; whether Defendants violate the ADA and RA by using methods of administration\nthat have the effect of discriminating against Plaintiffs and class members; whether Defendants\nviolate the ADA and RA by selecting sites for polling places that exclude Plaintiffs and class\nmembers from the voting process; whether Defendants violate the ADA and RA by failing to make\nreasonable modifications to their polices, practices and procedures to avoid discriminating against\nPlaintiffs and class members; whether Defendants violate the ADA and RA by failing to make their\nservices available to Plaintiffs and class members in the most integrated setting appropriate to their\nneeds; and whether Defendants violate the ADA’s and RA’s program accessibility mandates.  (Pls.\nMem. at 11.)  Additionally, Plaintiffs maintain that the typicality requirement is satisfied in this case\nbecause their claims, and those of the class, arise from the same policies and procedures and are\nbased on the same legal theory.  \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs cannot establish commonality or typicality in this case\nbecause an individualized inquiry would be required to determine whether each member of the class\nis mobility disabled within the meaning of the ADA and RA.  (Def. Mem. at 7-9.)  We do not agree\nthat such individualized determinations would have to be made with respect to each member of the\nproposed class, because Plaintiffs seek only injunctive relief applicable to the class as a whole.  See\nBacal, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6609, at *11 (“Class relief is especially appropriate ‘where plaintiffs\nrequest declaratory and injunctive relief against a defendant engaging in a common course of conduct\ntoward them, and there is therefore no need for individualized determinations of the propriety of\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 7 of 14\ninjunctive relief.’” (quoting Baby Neal, 43 F.3d at 57)).  Moreover, “‘[t]he need for individualized\ndeterminations . . . has not totally precluded courts from certifying class actions based on claims of\ndisability  discrimination.  Where  the  challenged  conduct  is  a  specific  policy  that  allegedly\ndiscriminates  in  a  broad-based  manner  against  class  members,  class  certification  may  be\nappropriate.’”  Hohider v. UPS, 243 F.R.D. 147, 204 (W.D. Pa. 2007) (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n5 Jonathan R. Mook, Labor and Employment Law § 142.02[7](c) (2007)).  We will not deny the\nMotion for Class Certification on this basis.\nDefendants also contend that Plaintiffs cannot establish commonality or typicality in this case\nbecause some class members may be assigned to accessible polling places.  Defendants maintain that\nthese class members, unlike those who are assigned to inaccessible polling places, would have no\ninterest in the injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs.  We previously rejected this argument when it\nwas raised by these same Defendants in Nat’l Org. on Disability v. Tartaglione, Civ. A. No. 01-1923\n(E.D. Pa.) (“Tartaglione”), and found that this potential difference between class members was too\nslight to warrant a finding that the typicality requirement was not met in that case.  Tartaglione, Civ.\nA. No. 01-1923, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  16932, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 2001).  Defendants have\nnot persuaded us otherwise in this case. \nDefendants further argue that the commonality and typicality requirements cannot be satisfied\nin this case because a conflict exists between class members who use wheelchairs to ambulate and\nelderly class members who are able to ambulate without wheelchairs.  Defendants assert that\nwheelchair users would be willing to travel greater distances to vote in accessible polling places than\nelderly class members and that elderly class members will not vote in a polling place that is moved\nsix or seven blocks away or across a busy street.  (Defs. Supplemental Mem. at 6-9, 11.)   Defendants\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 8 of 14\nrest their proposition that wheelchair users are willing to travel to vote in accessible polling places\non the deposition testimony of Plaintiffs Mangum and McShea.  Contrary to Defendants’ argument,\nhowever, Mr. Mangum did not testify to a willingness to travel more than an extra block or two to\nvote in an accessible polling place.  Rather, he testified that his willingness to vote in a polling place\neven two blocks farther from his home than his current polling place “depends on the area and the\ncomfort -- like if I’m comfortable with that block or anything.”  (Mangum Dep. at 47.)  He also\ntestified that he would not support moving his polling place to an accessible location if that meant\nthat other voters could not get to the new location:  “I wouldn’t like that because you need\neverybody’s vote in any situation.”  (Id. at 48.)  He further testified that he would be unhappy with\nthe idea of moving his polling place and would prefer that it be made accessible.  (Id. at 50.)  Mr.\nMcShea testified that he would be willing to travel to a more accessible polling place.  However, he\nwould only be willing to do so “as long as it wasn’t too far.”  (McShea Dep. at 33.)  \nDefendants contend that elderly class members “are reluctant to travel far from their homes\nand often cannot walk long distances.”  (Defs. Supplemental Mem. at 8.)  Defendants maintain that\nthese class members would not be willing to walk a few additional blocks to vote in an accessible\npolling place.  They rely on comments made by ward leaders who appeared at meetings of the City\nCommissioners and spoke in opposition to relocating certain polling places to accessible locations.\nSharon Losier voiced opposition to moving a polling place seven blocks from 500 Whitby Avenue\nto 53rd and Baltimore Avenue because “at least 100 seniors . . . vote at that polling place” and the\nmost disabled voter, a woman who uses two canes, is able to use the current polling place, which has\ntwo steps.  (Defs. Ex. G at 16-17.)  Timothy Martin spoke out in opposition to a proposal to move\na polling place from 1225 South 58th Street to 58th and Willows Avenue, six blocks away, outside\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 9 of 14\nof the division.  (Defs. Ex. I at 29-30.)  Mr. Martin stated that the ward had a number of elderly\nvoters and no handicapped voters who had difficulty voting at the current location.  (Id. at 30.)  Rose\nAmpachello, ward leader of 39A, spoke out against a proposal to move a polling place from 2601\nSouth Eleventh Street to either Ninth and Oregon Avenue or Ninth and Johnson.  (Defs. Ex. J. at 48.)\nMs. Ampachello stated that voters told her that they would not vote in the new polling place “mainly\nbecause for some it’s a four or five block walk plus crossing Oregon Avenue.”  (Id.)  She also stated\nthat the present polling place had one step that had been previously ramped and that it could be\nramped again.  (Id. at 48-49.)  Benjamin Morris opposed moving a polling place from 23rd and\nCambria to 22nd and Huntingdon Street because that ward has many senior citizens and the move\nwould require them to cross a busy street.  (Id. at 27-28.) Bill Greenly also voiced opposition to\nmoving a polling place from 867 North Corinthian Street to either of two proposed locations because\nthe proposed locations, which were outside of the division, would be a longer walk for a number of\nresidents, particularly seniors.  (Id. at 33-35.)\nWe find that older class members may be reluctant to vote in accessible polling places if\nthose polling places are more than a few blocks farther from their homes than their current polling\nplaces.  However, we do not find that the interests of Plaintiffs Mangum and McShea conflict with\nthe interests of older class members with respect to the relocation of polling places, as neither\nPlaintiff Mangum nor Plaintiff McShea favors moving polling places long distances.  We also note\nthat Plaintiffs seek the relocation of inaccessible polling places only if those polling places cannot\nbe made accessible.  “Conflicts of interest are rare in Rule 23(b)(2) class actions seeking only\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.”  New Directions Treatment Servs. v. City of Reading, 490 F.3d\n293, 313 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)) (footnote omitted). We find that Defendants\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 10 of 14\nhave not established that a true conflict exists in this case.  We also find, on the record before us, that\nthe potential conflict raised by Defendants does not warrant a finding that the proposed class does\nnot satisfy the commonality or typicality requirements.  \nWe find that the alleged discriminatory acts of Defendants are the same with respect to the\nnamed Plaintiffs and the class they seek to represent.  As Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against\nDefendants, who are allegedly engaged in a common course of conduct on a class-wide basis, we\nfind that the commonality requirement is met in this case.  See  T.B. v. School Dist. of Philadelphia,\nCiv. A. No. 97-5453, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19300, at *11, (E.D. Pa., Dec. 1, 1997) (“Class relief\nis ‘especially appropriate’ where plaintiffs seek injunctive relief against defendants engaged in a\ncommon course of conduct affecting the entire class.”) (citing Bacal v. SEPTA,, Civ. A. No.\n94-6497, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6609, at *11 (E.D. Pa. May 16, 1995)).  We also find that the\nclaims of Plaintiff Mangum and McShea are typical of the class as a whole and that the typicality\nrequirement is met in this case.  However, we retain the authority to decertify the class or to create\nsubclasses to accommodate conflicting interests if, after the record is fully developed, it appears that\nthere are inherent conflicts within the class. \n3. Adequacy of representation\n“To  establish  adequate  representation,  (a)  the  plaintiff’s  attorney  must  be  qualified,\nexperienced and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation, and (b) the plaintiff must not have\ninterests antagonistic to those of the class.”  Tartaglione, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16932, at *11\n(citing  T.B. v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19300, at *15).  Defendants\nhave the burden of establishing that the representative plaintiffs will not adequately represent the\nclass.  See Harper v. Trans Union, L.L.C., Civ. A. No. 04-3510, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91813, at\n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 11 of 14\n*17 (citing Shamberg v. Ahlstrom, 111 F.R.D. 689, 693 (D.N.J. 1986)).  We must therefore\ndetermine “whether the representatives’ interests conflict with those of the class and whether the\nclass attorney is capable of representing the class.”  Johnston, 265 F.3d at 185 (citations omitted).\nPlaintiffs maintain that they share the same injuries and seek the same declaratory and\ninjunctive relief as the class members they seek to represent and, therefore, their interests do not\nconflict with those of other class members.  They also maintain that their counsel, Robert W. Meek\nand Stephen F. Gold, have thirty years and thirty-five years of experience, respectively, as civil rights\nattorneys with expertise in disabilities law and class litigation and have litigated numerous cases to\nenforce the ADA and RA; and that Seth Kreimer has been a professor at the University of\nPennsylvania School of Law for more than 25 years and has experience as counsel in a variety of\ncomplex civil rights actions.  We find that Plaintiffs’ counsel are qualified, experienced and\ngenerally able to conduct this litigation on behalf of the class. \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff Kerrigan is precluded from participating in this lawsuit and,\naccordingly, cannot adequately represent the interests of the proposed class.  We agree.  Plaintiff\nKerrigan was registered to vote and developed a mobility disability prior to October 22, 2001. She\nregistered to vote on April 11, 1994.  (Def. Ex. A.)  She started using a walker and cane about 10\nyears ago and had to get a handicapped parking spot because she could not walk more than a block.\n(Kerrigan Dep. at 10.)  When she went shopping, she could walk to and from her car, but “once\ninside a store, [she] usually rode those power chair things.  If they didn’t have them, [she] didn’t go.”\n(Id. at 11.)  Plaintiff Kerrigan obtained her wheelchair about eight years ago but did not use it\ncontinually at that time.  (Id.)  Between the time she obtained her wheelchair eight years ago and\napproximately three years ago, she used her wheelchair, walker and cane, depending on the\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 57   Filed 03/14/08   Page 12 of 14\ncircumstances.  (Id. at 11-12.)  The RA and ADA define “disability” as “a physical or mental\nimpairment which substantially limits one or more . . .  major life activities . . . .”  29 U.S.C. §\n705(20)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).  We find that Plaintiff Kerrigan had a mobility disability for\npurposes of the RA and ADA at least eight years ago, prior to October 22, 2001.  Thus she had both\nregistered to vote and developed a mobility disability prior to October 22, 2001.  We find,\naccordingly, that she is not a member of the proposed class and would not be an adequate class\nrepresentative.  \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs Mangum and McShea would not be adequate class\nrepresentatives because, as wheelchair users, their interests conflict with the interests of elderly class\nmembers who do not use wheelchairs because wheelchair users are willing to travel longer distances\nto vote in accessible polling places than class members who do not use wheelchairs.  As discussed\nabove, we do not find that the interests of Plaintiffs Mangum and McShea, who use wheelchairs,\nconflict with the interests of older class members with respect to the relocation of polling places, as\nneither Plaintiff Mangum nor Plaintiff McShea favors moving polling places long distances.  We\nconclude that Plaintiffs Mangum and McShea are adequate class representatives.  We find,\naccordingly, that the adequacy of representation requirement is met in this case.\nB. Rule 23(b)(2)\nAs Plaintiffs have met the requirements for certification of the proposed class pursuant to\nRule 23(a), we must examine whether certification is appropriate under at least one part of Rule\n23(b).  Plaintiffs seek to have this class certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants have\n“acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or\ncorresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole . . . .”  Fed.

Rule 23(b)(2) “was designed specifically for civil rights cases seeking broad declaratory\nor injunctive relief for a numerous and often unascertainable or amorphous class of persons.”  Baby\nNeal, 43 F.3d at 59 (internal quotation omitted); see also Stewart, 275 F.3d at 228 (same).  The\nComplaint seeks class-wide injunctive relief to remedy Defendants’ alleged discrimination against\nmobility disabled voters. We find, therefore, that certification of the proposed class pursuant to Rule\n23(b)(2) is appropriate.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, we conclude that Plaintiffs have met the requirements for\ncertification of the class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  Accordingly, we certify the\nproposed class for the purpose of seeking injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).

CORTÉS, in his  :\nofficial capacity as Secretary of the :\nCommonwealth, :\n:\nDefendants. :\n_______________________________________:\nAMENDED COMPLAINT\nI. Introduction\n1. Individual  Plaintiffs  are  residents  of  Philadelphia  who  have  mobility\ndisabilities, who are registered to vote, and who wish to vote at neighborhood polling places\nthat are accessible for persons with mobility disabilities.\n2. Plaintiffs seek to exercise their right to vote in Philadelphia in the same manner\nas non-disabled persons and with access to polling places the same as non-disabled persons.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 2 of 18\nThey seek to vote at their neighborhood polling places and to exercise their fundamental right\nto cast a secret ballot for the candidates of their choice -- in the same manner as non-disabled\npersons.\n3. Philadelphia has more than 1,600 polling divisions, and more than 400 are not\naccessible to persons with mobility impairments who cannot readily walk up or down steps.\nDue to physically inaccessible polling places, Plaintiffs and class members cannot vote in\ntheir neighborhood polling places, do not vote, or are humiliated and embarrassed because\nthey cannot independently and readily access the polling places and are denied access to\nneighborhood polling places.\n4. Defendants City of Philadelphia and the City Commissioners have failed to\nselect and provide accessible polling places thus violating Plaintiffs’ and class members’\ncivil rights under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 12131-12134, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“RA”), 29 U.S.C. § 794,\nby denying equal and integrated access to the polling places in Philadelphia.\n5. Defendants  Pennsylvania  Department  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of  the\nCommonwealth have violated the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act\n(VAEH), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973ee-1 et seq., Title II of the ADA, and Section 504 of the RA, by\nfailing to assure that all polling places in Philadelphia were surveyed and by allowing the\nCity of Philadelphia and the City Commissioners to improperly designate inaccessible polling\n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 3 of 18\nplaces as accessible, to reject accessible alternative polling locations, and to improperly\nutilize the alternative ballot.\n6.  Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to require Defendants to assure\nthat polling places in Philadelphia are accessible to Plaintiffs and other voters with mobility\ndisabilities.\nII. Jurisdiction\n7. The court has jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n1343(3).  Plaintiffs’ claims are authorized by 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973ee-4, 1983, 12132; 29 U.S.C.\n§ 794; and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.\n8. Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) since\nall of the events that give rise to the Amended Complaint occurred in this district.\nIII. The Parties\nA. Individual Plaintiffs\n9. Plaintiff Michael J. McShea is a Philadelphia resident who is registered to vote.\nHe has a mobility disability as a result of having his left leg amputated more than three years\nago and his right leg amputated approximately two and one-half years ago.  Since 2004, he\nhas used a wheelchair to ambulate.  Defendants assigned him to a polling place that it listed\nas an accessible garage, but the garage is not used for voting.  Instead, voting occurs in a\nbasement which has three steps.  In order to gain access, the poll workers have carried\nPlaintiff McShea down the three steps, which is dangerous to both him and the poll workers.\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 4 of 18\nAs a result of its inaccessibility, Plaintiff McShea cannot gain independent access to his\napartment.\n10. Plaintiff Tariq Mangum is a nineteen-year-old Philadelphia resident who\nbecame eligible to vote in May 2006 and who is registered to vote.  He became disabled\nearlier in 2006 as a result of a car accident.  He has a mobility disability and uses a\nwheelchair to ambulate.  Defendants assigned him to a polling place that is inaccessible\nbecause it has steps.  As a result of its inaccessibility, Plaintiff Mangum cannot gain access\nto his polling place or use the voting machines.\n11. Kathleen Kerrigan, Renee Crosby, Carolyn Davenport, and Anthony Holiday,\nwho were named as Plaintiffs in the initial complaint, are no longer parties in this litigation.\nB. Defendants\n12. Defendant City of Philadelphia is a Pennsylvania city of the first class which,\nthrough the City Commissioners as the Philadelphia Board of Elections, is responsible to\nselect polling places, administer voter registration, and otherwise conduct and supervise\nelections in Philadelphia in accordance with federal and state laws.\n13. Defendants Margaret M. Tartaglione, Anthony Clark, and Joseph J. Duda are\nthe Philadelphia City Commissioners who are responsible to select polling places, administer\nvoter  registration,  and  otherwise  conduct  and  supervise  elections  in  Philadelphia  in\naccordance with federal and state laws.  Defendants Tartaglione, Clark, and Duda are sued\nsolely in their official capacities for actions and omissions as the City Commissioners.\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 5 of 18\n14. Defendant Pennsylvania Department of State, through the Secretary of the\nCommonwealth, is the agency in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that is responsible for\nenforcement in the Commonwealth of the VAEH, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1973ee et seq.; 25 Pa. Cons.\nStat. Ann. §§ 2621(e), 2621(g).\n15. Defendant Pedro A. Cortés is the Secretary of the Commonwealth who, as the\nchief  election  officer  for  the  Commonwealth,  is  responsible  for  enforcement  in  the\nCommonwealth of the federal Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1973ee et seq.; 25 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. §§ 2621(e), 2621(g).\nIV. Class Action Allegations\n16. Plaintiffs McShea and Mangum bring this action on their own behalf and on\nbehalf of all other persons similarly situated pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The class, which the Court certified by Order dated March\n13, 2008, consists of all eligible Philadelphia County voters with mobility disabilities who\neither became eligible to vote or developed a mobility disability after October 22, 2001.\n17. The exact size of the class is unknown to Plaintiffs, but it is believed to be\nsufficiently large to make joinder impracticable.\n18. The questions of law or fact common to the class include whether Defendants\nviolate the ADA, RA, and/or VAEH by failing to assure that Philadelphia polling places are\naccessible.\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 6 of 18\n19. The claims of Plaintiffs McShea and Mangum are typical of all putative class\nmembers’ claims.\n20. Plaintiffs McShea and Mangum will fairly and adequately protect the interests\nof the class.  They have no interests which conflict with other class members.  Plaintiffs’\ncounsel are experienced in litigating class actions, including enforcement of the civil rights\nof people with disabilities.  Messrs. McShea and Mangum have been certified as class\nrepresentatives and their counsel have been appointed to represent the class in the Court’s\nMarch 13, 2008 Order.\n21. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the\nclass, thereby making appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class\nas a whole.\nV. The Facts\n22. Plaintiffs and class members are individuals with mobility disabilities who\ndesire to vote in person on election day at accessible polling places that permit them to cast\ntheir ballots in the same manner as non-disabled persons.\n23. Defendants City of Philadelphia and the City Commissioners (collectively,\n“City Defendants”) have not ensured that voters with mobility disabilities can vote in\naccessible polling places to cast their ballots secretly, independently, and in the most\nintegrated setting.\n6\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 7 of 18\n24. Philadelphia County is 129.7 square miles.  The City is divided into 66 wards,\neach of which is divided into multiple divisions.  Each division is assigned a unique polling\nplace.  There are more than 1,600 polling divisions in the City.  Since two or more polling\ndivisions can be assigned to a single locations, there are approximately 1,000 to 1,200 polling\nplaces in Philadelphia.  City Defendants assign each registered voter in the City to a ward and\ndivision based on where she or he lives.  Registered voters are required to vote in the polling\nplace for the ward and division to which they have been assigned by the City Defendants. \n25. City Defendants, based on the VAEH policies and procedures of Defendants\nPennsylvania Department of State and Pedro A. Cortés (collectively, “Commonwealth\nDefendants”), do not allow voters with mobility disabilities whose assigned polling place is\ninaccessible to vote in an accessible polling place.\n26. As a result of a previous lawsuit, hundreds of neighborhood polling places that\nhad  been  inaccessible  to  persons  with  mobility  disabilities,  including  those  who  use\nwheelchairs, were relocated to accessible locations at no cost to the City Defendants or they\nwere ramped with either permanent or temporary ramps with federal funds.  Nevertheless,\nmore than 400 polling places remain inaccessible.\n27. Many inaccessible polling places that have not been relocated could be moved\nto accessible locations.\n7\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 8 of 18\n28. A number of polling places -- including some identified as accessible -- are\ninaccessible but, with simple modifications, could be made accessible or moved to accessible\nlocations.\n29. Despite knowledge of continued violations of and denial of equal access of the\nvoting rights of Plaintiffs and other voters with mobility disabilities since the passage of the\nADA and RA, City Defendants select and use polling locations that are inaccessible to\npersons with disabilities rather than select and use only accessible polling locations.\n30. The Commonwealth Defendants’ VAEH policies and procedures required the\nCity Defendants to survey all Philadelphia polling places to determine if they meet the\naccessibility requirements established by the Commonwealth Defendants pursuant to the\nVAEH and whether they can be made temporarily accessible or relocated to accessible\nlocations.  The City Defendants did not comply with the Commonwealth Defendants’ VAEH\npolicies and procedures by, inter alia, (1) failing to properly survey Philadelphia polling\nplaces; (2) failing to properly designate polling places as accessible or inaccessible; (3)\nfailing to make polling places accessible through temporary means or to relocate polling\nplaces to accessible sites when it is feasible to do so; and (4) failing to make good faith\nefforts to increase the accessibility of polling places.\n31. The Commonwealth Defendants’ VAEH policies and procedures allow the City\nDefendants to use the alternative ballot process to enable individuals with disabilities to vote\nby alternative ballot only when their polling places are not accessible and cannot be made\n8\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 9 of 18\naccessible through temporary means or relocated to accessible sites.  The City Defendants’\nuse of the alternative ballot process disregards the Commonwealth Defendants’ VAEH\npolicies and procedures by, inter alia, using the alternative ballot process in lieu of making\npolling places accessible or relocating them to accessible sites.  The City Defendants also\ndisregard the Commonwealth’s VAEH policies and procedures by periodically allowing\nvoters  with  mobility  disabilities  who  arrive  at  inaccessible  polling  places  to  vote  by\nprovisional ballot. \n32. The Commonwealth Defendants have made no efforts to assure that the City\nDefendants comply with the Commonwealth’s VAEH policies and procedures, including,\ninter alia, reviewing the City Defendants’ surveys of polling places, independently checking\ntheir conclusions about the accessibility of polling places, and independently determining\nwhether inaccessible polling places could be made accessible or relocated to accessible sites.\n33. The Commonwealth Defendants have failed to assure that all polling places in\nPhiladelphia were properly surveyed to assess their accessibility and, if they do not satisfy\nthe accessibility standards established by the Commonwealth, to determine whether they can\nbe made temporarily accessible or relocated to accessible locations.\n34. The Commonwealth Defendants have failed to assure that the alternative ballot\nprocess is used in Philadelphia only as a last resort in Philadelphia when polling places\ncannot be made accessible or relocated to accessible sites.\n9\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 10 of 18\n35. There is no emergency in Philadelphia that would justify the Commonwealth\nDefendants’ failure to require the City Defendants to make its polling places accessible and,\nindeed, the Commonwealth Defendants have not declared such an emergency in Philadelphia\nor elsewhere in Pennsylvania.\n36. Plaintiffs  and  class  members  have  mobility  impairments  and  many  use\nwheelchairs to ambulate due to their disabilities.  In order for Plaintiffs and class members\nto cast their ballots in person, their neighborhood polling places must have an accessible path\nof travel to an accessible voting machine.  Their present polling places are inaccessible and\nthey cannot vote where their non-disabled neighbors vote.\n37. Defendants have discriminated, and continue to discriminate, against Plaintiffs\nand class members based on their disabilities with respect to voting in Philadelphia.\n38. Plaintiffs and class members have no adequate remedy at law and require\ninjunctive relief to enjoin Defendants from violating their civil rights.\nVI. Claims\nA. ADA and RA Claims Against City Defendants\n39. Plaintiffs and class members are substantially impaired in the major life activity\nof walking and they are qualified individuals with disabilities as defined in the ADA and RA.\n42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(2)(A), 12131 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104 (ADA); 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B)\nand 28 C.F.R. §§ 41.31, 41.32 (RA).\n10\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 11 of 18\n40. City  Defendants  --  Defendants  City  of  Philadelphia  and  Margaret  M.\nTartaglione, Anthony Clark, and Joseph J. Duda, who are sued in their official capacities as\nCity Commissioners -- are public entities subject to the ADA and are recipients of federal\nfinancial assistance subject to the RA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104 (ADA);\n29 U.S.C. § 794(b).\n41. City Defendants have subjected Plaintiffs and class members to discrimination\nbased on their mobility disabilities by excluding them from participation in and denying them\nthe benefits of their services, programs, and activities, i.e., access to polling places and the\nvoting process in a manner that is available to non-disabled people, in violation of the ADA,\n42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n42. City Defendants have denied or failed to afford Plaintiffs and class members\non the basis of their mobility disabilities the opportunity to participate in and benefit from\ntheir services, programs, and activities, i.e., voting in polling places in a manner that is\navailable to and afforded to non-disabled people, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132\nand 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n43. City Defendants have used methods of administration that have the effect of\nsubjecting individuals with mobility disabilities, such as Plaintiffs and class members, to\ndiscrimination on the basis of their disabilities (e.g., refusing to relocate inaccessible polling\nplaces to accessible locations) and defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 12 of 18\nof the program’s objectives to facilitate voting in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132\nand 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3), and RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n44. City Defendants have determined the locations of polling places in a manner\nthat has the effect of excluding individuals with mobility disabilities, such as Plaintiffs and\nclass members, from or denying them the benefits of City Defendants’ programs, services,\nor activities, i.e., providing access to polling places and the voting process, and that have the\npurpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the objectives of those programs,\nservices,  or  activities  in  violation  of  the  ADA,  42  U.S.C.  §  12132  and  28  C.F.R.  §\n35.130(b)(4), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n45. City Defendants have failed to make reasonable modifications in their policies,\npractices, and procedures concerning inaccessible polling places that are necessary to avoid\ndiscrimination against individuals with mobility disabilities, such as Plaintiffs and class\nmembers, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7), and the\nRA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n46. City  Defendants  have  failed  to  administer  their  services,  programs,  and\nactivities (i.e., providing access to polling places and the voting process) in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of individuals with mobility disabilities, such as\nPlaintiffs and class members, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. §\n35.130(d), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 13 of 18\n47. City  Defendants  have  failed  to  assure  that  each  polling  place  --  which\nconstitutes a unique service, program, or activity because voters can vote only in their\nassigned polling place -- is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with mobility\ndisabilities, including Plaintiffs and class members, in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C §\n12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.150, and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794.\nB. VAEH Claim Against Defendant Cortés\n48. Plaintiffs and class members, as individuals with mobility disabilities who are\nunable to vote because their polling places are inaccessible, are aggrieved persons under the\nVAEH, 42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-4(a).\n49. Defendant Cortés, as the Secretary of the Commonwealth, is the chief election\nofficial with responsibilities under the VAEH in Pennsylvania, 42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1.\n50. Defendant Cortés, as the chief election officer of Pennsylvania, has violated\nthe VAEH, 42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1(b)(2)(A), by erroneously determining that all polling places\nin Philadelphia had been properly surveyed and that the City Defendants could not make any\ninaccessible polling places accessible or relocate them to accessible sites.  To the contrary,\nDefendant Cortés knew or should have known that the City Defendants’ surveys of polling\nplaces were flawed; that they had improperly designated polling places as accessible; that\nthey had improperly rejected accessible, alternative polling places; and that they failed to\nmake inaccessible polling places accessible when it was reasonable to do so.\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 14 of 18\n51. Defendant Cortés, as the chief election officer of Pennsylvania, has violated\nthe VAEH, 42 U.S.C. § 1973ee-1(b)(2)(B)(ii), by permitting the City Defendants to rely on\nthe alternative ballot process for voters with mobility disabilities who are assigned to\ninaccessible polling places that could be either made accessible or relocated to accessible\nsites.\nC. ADA Claims Against Defendant Cortés\n52. Plaintiffs and class members are substantially impaired in the major life activity\nof walking and they are qualified individuals with disabilities as defined in the ADA.  42\nU.S.C. §§ 12102(2)(A), 1213 1 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.104.\n53. Defendant Cortés, who is sued in his official capacity as Secretary of the\nCommonwealth, is responsible to administer and oversee the Pennsylvania Department of\nState, which is a public entity subject to the ADA.  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1) and 28 C.F.R. §\n35.104 (ADA).\n54. Defendant Cortés has used methods of administration (e.g., relying on the City\nDefendants to survey polling places with no independent evaluation of their work; failing to\nassure that the City Defendants use the alternative ballot process as a last resort only when\nthey cannot make polling places accessible or relocate them to accessible sites) that:\na.  have the effect of subjecting individuals with mobility disabilities, such\nas Plaintiffs and class members, to discrimination on the basis of their\n14\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 15 of 18\ndisabilities in violation of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R.\n§ 35.130(b)(3)(i));\nb. defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the Common-\nwealth’s objectives to assure compliance with the VAEH in violation\nof the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(ii); and\nc. perpetuate the discrimination of the City Defendants in violation of the\nADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3)(iii).\nD.

Plaintiffs and class members are substantially impaired in the major life activity\nof walking and they are qualified individuals with disabilities as defined in the RA.  29\nU.S.C. § 705(20)(B) and 28 C.F.R. §§ 41.31, 41.32 \n56. Defendant Pennsylvania Department of State is a recipient of federal financial\nassistance subject to the RA.  29 U.S.C. § 794(b).\n57. Defendant Pennsylvania Department of State has used methods of admin-\nistration (e.g., relying on the City Defendants to survey polling places with no independent\nevaluation of their work; failing to assure that the City Defendants use the alternative ballot\nprocess as a last resort only when they cannot make polling places accessible or relocate them\nto accessible sites) that:\na.  have the effect of subjecting individuals with mobility disabilities, such\nas Plaintiffs and class members, to discrimination on the basis of their\n15\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 91   Filed 08/19/08   Page 16 of 18\ndisabilities in violation of the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. §\n41.51(b)(3)(i));\nb. defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the Common-\nwealth’s objectives to assure compliance with the VAEH in violation\nof the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(ii); and\nc. perpetuate the discrimination of the City Defendants in violation of the\nRA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(iii).\nVII.

Defendants have violated the Americans with Disabilities Act\nand the Rehabilitation Act by both (1) failing to assure that polling places they have designated\nas “accessible” are in fact accessible to and independently usable by voters with mobility\ndisabilities on Election Day; and (2) failing to make accessible those polling places that they\nhave designated as “inaccessible,” either by alterations or relocation, when doing so would not\nresult in a fundamental alteration.  Plaintiffs seek permanent injunctive relief to remedy these\nviolations.\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 4 of 43\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nThe  continued  inaccessibility  of  Philadelphia’s  polling  places  --  even  those  that\nDefendants have designated as accessible -- undermines the ability of people with mobility\ndisabilities, particularly those who use wheelchairs, to participate independently in the voting\nprocess like their non-disabled neighbors.  Despite the pendency of this lawsuit and a prior\nlawsuit to increase the accessibility of Philadelphia polling places, the evidence demonstrates\nthat many polling places -- including those that Defendants concede can and should be accessible\n-- were inaccessible on the most recent election day in November 2007.\nPhiladelphia is divided into 66 wards with a total of 1,681 polling divisions.  See Election\nNotice -- Polling Places Municipal and Special Election Tuesday Nov. 6, 2007, Phila. Inquirer,\nNov. 5, 2007, at A12-A13 (“Election Notice”) (Exh. A).  These divisions are selected by\nDefendants, the Philadelphia Board of Elections and the individual City Commissioners.  25 Pa.\nCons. Stat. Ann. § 2762(a).  Defendants assign each registered voter to a specific division near\ntheir homes.  Registered voters cannot choose the division in which they will vote, and,\naccordingly, voters with mobility disabilities cannot request that the Defendants reassign them\nto a division with an accessible polling place.\n Prior to each scheduled election day, Defendants publish a notice in local newspapers\nthat lists the polling place location for each division.  See Election Notice. This most recent\nElection Notice published for the general election held on November 6, 2007 included the\nfollowing “Legend for Polling Place Accessibility for Disabled Voters”: \n2\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 5 of 43\nFH  =  Fully  Accessible  for  disabled;  designated  parking  for\ndisabled\nBL/RL = Building substantially Accessible for disabled with\nminor assistance, Passenger Loading Zone\nBN/RN = Building substantially Accessible for disabled with\nminor assistance, No parking\nAL = Building Accessible by Alternative entrance, Passenger\nLoading Zone, Call 215-686-1523\nAN = Building Accessible by Alternative entrance, No Parking,\nCall 215-686-1523\nNN = Building Inaccessible for Disabled, No Parking.\nId.  Next to each polling division listed in the notice is either one of the designations in the\nlegend or the designation “NL.”  See id.  Although not listed in the Legend, the designation “NL”\nseems to mean that the building where the polling division is located is not accessible, but there\nis a passenger loading zone.  Approximately 194 polling divisions were identified in the\nNovember 6, 2007 Election Notice as “NN” or “NL,” i.e., inaccessible to voters with mobility\ndisabilities.  See Resnick Decl.  ¶ 15 (Exh. B).  Thus, according to the Election Notice,\napproximately 1,487 of the 1,681 polling divisions should have been accessible through the main\nentrance usable by non-disabled voters or an alternative entrance (such as a side door, loading\ndock, or some other location) that a person with a mobility disability could use to gain entrance\nto the voting machines.\n3\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 6 of 43\nOn November 6, 2007, the date of the most recent election, witnesses observed1 that a\nnumber of Philadelphia polling places designated by Defendants in the Election Notice as\naccessible  (either  fully  accessible,  substantially  accessible,  or  accessible  via  alternative\nentrance),  in fact, were not accessible to individuals with mobility disabilities (particularly,\nthose who use wheelchairs), including the following which Plaintiffs offer as a sample:2\n# Ward 2, Division 5 -- Defendants’ accessibility designation for the polling\nplace for this division, located in St. Maron’s Church at 1013 Ellsworth\nStreet, was “RL.”  See Election Notice.  Yet, the two entrances to the\npolling place both had one step and neither had a ramp in place, making\nthe polling place inaccessible.  Resnick Decl. ¶ 3 & Att. 1 (photographs).\n# Ward 2, Division 23 -- Defendants’ accessibility designation for the\npolling place for this division, located at the Palumbo Recreation Center,\nwas “RN.”  See Election Notice.  The entrance to the polling place had\nabout a 2-inch step and but did not have a ramp in place, making it\ninaccessible.    Although  there  possibly  was  an  accessible  alternative\nentrance to the facility, it was locked and there was no signage that\nindicated the availability of an accessible entrance.  Resnick Decl. ¶ 4 &\nAtt. 2 (photograph).\n# Ward 2, Division 25 -- Defendants’ accessibility designation for the\npolling place for this division, located in a wallpaper store at 707 East\nPassyunk Avenue, was “RN.”  See Election Notice.  The entrance to the\npolling place had a large step and there was no ramp in place, making it\ninaccessible.  Resnick Decl. ¶ 5 & Att. 3 (photographs).\n1  These witnesses included counsel for the Plaintiffs as well as volunteers organized and\ntrained by the Committee of Seventy.  See Resnick Decl. ¶ 2; Fulton Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7 (Exh. C).  The\nCommittee of Seventy is a non-profit, non-partisan Philadelphia organization that works on issues\nrelating to voting rights.  See Fulton Decl. ¶ 3.  The Committee of Seventy uses volunteers on\nelection days to survey polling places for a variety of issues.   See id. ¶¶ 4, 5, 7.  In recent elections,\nincluding the November 6, 2007 general election, the survey forms completed by volunteers included\nissues relating to accessibility for voters with mobility disabilities.  Id. ¶¶ 5, 6.\n2  All polling places were not visited during the November 2007 general election.  The\nevidence gathered, however, is sufficient to establish Defendants’ violations of the ADA and to\njustify relief that assures the accessibility of all polling places to the maximum extent feasible.\n4\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 7 of 43\n# Ward 3, Division 1 -- Defendants’ accessibility designation for the polling\nplace for this division, located in a beauty salon at 121 South 60th Street,\nwas “BN.”  See Election Notice.

Resnick Decl. ¶ 8 & Att. 6 (photographs).\n# Ward 4, Division 16 -- Defendants’ accessibility designation for the\npolling place for this division, located at a “church property” at 5546 West\nGirard Avenue, was “BN.”  See Election Notice.

The main entrance was\nnot accessible.  There was an accessible entrance at the rear, but no\nsignage at the front to indicate that an accessible entrance existed.  The\nvoting machines were placed on the stage in the school auditorium that\n5\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 8 of 43\nrequired voters to go up four steps, making it inaccessible.

E).\n# Ward 12, Division 2 -- Defendants’ accessibility designation for the\npolling place for this division, to which Plaintiff Davenport is assigned\nand which is located in the Pastorius School at Chelten & Sprague Street,\nwas “BL.”  See Election Notice.  As in prior elections, the building was\nnot accessible in the general election in November 2007.  Although there\nis an alternative, accessible entrance, there was no signage and it was\nlocked.  As a result Plaintiff Davenport could not access the polling place\nin her wheelchair and was forced to pull herself up the steps by the\nhandrail, which was both difficult and embarrassing, and then use her\nwalker to get to the voting booth.

Smith\nRep. at 17, 19.\nFor Pennsylvania voters with mobility disabilities who are assigned to an inaccessible\npolling place, the primary means by which they can vote is the alternative ballot process.  See\n11\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 14 of 43\nPennsylvania Dep’t of State, The Alternative Ballot: Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and\nHandicapped Act, available at www.dos.state.pa.us (Exh. Q); City of Philadelphia, Absentee\nBallots at 2, available at http://www.philllyelection.com/abeng.htm. (Exh. R).  The alternative\nballot process places burdens and intrusions upon individuals with mobility disabilities that are\nnot imposed on non-disabled persons and that individuals with mobility disabilities would not\nhave to endure if their assigned neighborhood polling places were physically accessible.\n# Individuals with disabilities must submit an application for an alternative ballot\nno later than 7 days prior to the election.  Absentee Ballots at 2 (Exh. R).\nIndividuals with mobility disabilities assigned by Defendants to inaccessible\npolling places must decide a week before the election whether they want to vote\nand lose the option to decide to vote based on events that occur in the week\npreceding the election.\n# Alternative ballots must be returned to the County Board of Elections no later\nthan the close of polls at 8:00 p.m. on Election Day.  Absentee Ballots at 2 (Exh.\nR).  Ballots postmarked on Election Day will not be honored.  Id.  This means that\nthe voter either (1) must vote in advance of Election Day to mail the alternative\nballot so that it is received no later than Election Day, or (2) must arrange for\ntransportation on Election Day to the Board of Elections at City Hall -- a far\ngreater distance for most voters than their assigned neighborhood polling place.\n# Pennsylvania’s Application for an Alternative Ballot requires the voter to check\nwhether he is applying as an elderly or “handicapped” person.

If the voter checks “handicapped,” he must divulge the nature of his\ndisability.  Id.  In Philadelphia, the voter can use the Absentee Ballot Application\nby  checking  “Illness  or  Physical  Disability.”    See  City  of  Philadelphia,\nInformation Statement on Access to the Election Process for People with Disabili-\nties in the City of Philadelphia (hereafter “Information Statement”) at 1, available\nat http://www.phillyelection. com/aceng.htm (Exh.

See Application for Absentee\nBallot (Exh. U); see also 25 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 3146.2(e)(2).  If the voter is\nphysically unable to sign the declaration, then he must mark his form and have a\n12\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 15 of 43\nwitness attest to that mark. Application for Absentee Ballot; see also 25 Pa. Cons.\nStat. Ann. § 3146.2(e)(2).\n# Alternative ballots cannot be used by individuals with mobility disabilities if the\nBoard of Elections has determined that their polling places are accessible even if,\nin fact, they are not accessible.  See Absentee Ballots at 2 (Exh. R); Deposition of\nRobert Lee at 144-145 in Nat’l Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione (Exh.\nV).  Accordingly, voters with mobility disabilities who are assigned to polling\nplaces that are incorrectly designated as accessible might not be able to use the\nalternative ballot process.4\nThere certainly may be some polling places that cannot reasonably be made accessible\n(either through temporary modifications or relocation) so that the burdensome alternative ballot\nwould be the only feasible means for voting.  There is, however, simply no legal justification to\nrequire the use of the alternative ballot process by voters with mobility disabilities who either:\n(1) are assigned to polling places that Defendants themselves have conceded can be and should\nbe accessible on election days, or (2) are assigned to inaccessible polling places that can be made\naccessible through temporary modifications or relocation to accessible sites.  Defendants’ refusal\n4  It is unclear what constitutes an inaccessible polling place for purposes of determining a\nvoter’s eligibility to use an alternative ballot.  Pennsylvania’s Application for Alternative Ballot\nrequires the voter to certify that he has “been assigned to a polling place that the County Board of\nElections has determined to be inaccessible to the elderly and individuals under standards prescribed\nby the Secretary of the Commonwealth.”  Pennsylvania Application for Alternative Ballot (Exh. S).\nIt is unclear how a voter would know whether his inaccessible polling place that was designated in\nthe Election Notice as fully accessible (FH), substantially accessible (BL, RL, BN, RN), or accessible\nby alternative entrance (AL, AN) constitutes an “inaccessible” polling place to qualify for an\nalternative ballot.  Defendants’ materials are equally confusing.  The Election Notice refers to\nindividuals who “are voting by means of an alternative ballot because of inaccessibility of their\npolling  places”  without  denoting  which  of  the  accessibility  designations  would  qualify  as\n“inaccessible” for purposes of voting by alternative ballot.  Election Notice (Exh. A).  Although\nsome information on Defendants’ website suggests that the ineligibility for alternative ballots applies\nonly to voters assigned to polling places designated as “FH” (i.e., fully accessible), see Information\nStatement at 1 (Exh. T), it is not clear how a voter without access to this web-based material would\nknow this.\n13\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 16 of 43\nto maximize the accessibility of their polling places -- especially their inexplicable failure to\nassure that polling places they designate as “accessible” are in fact accessible -- violates the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. \nARGUMENT\nI.  PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS WARRANTED TO REMEDY\nDEFENDANTS’ CONTINUED VIOLATIONS OF THE ADA AND RA.\nA.  Standard for Permanent Injunction\nThe issuance of a permanent injunction is appropriate if: “(1) the exercise of jurisdiction\nis appropriate; (2) the moving party has actually succeeded on the merits of its claim; and (3) the\n‘balance of equities’ favors granting injunctive relief.”  Chao v. Rothermel, 327 F.3d 223, 228\n(3d Cir. 2003); accord Texas Eastern Transmission LP v. Bowers, Civil Action No. 01-4488,\n2002 WL 77409 at *2 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 17, 2002) (Padova, J.), aff’d, 65 Fed. Appx. 794 (3d Cir.\n2003).  Each of these elements is satisfied in this case, justifying permanent injunctive relief.\nB.  The Court’s Exercise of Equity Jurisdiction is Appropriate.\n“Equity jurisdiction is proper if:  (1) the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law; (2) the\nthreatened injury is real, not imagined; and (3) no equitable defenses preclude jurisdiction.”\nTexas Eastern Transmission LP v. Bowers, 2002 WL 77409 at *2, *4.  Plaintiffs here have no\nadequate remedy at law.  Only an injunction that allows voters with mobility disabilities to\nparticipate in the voting process in the same manner as their neighbors will provide them with\nappropriate relief.  Further, the injury is quite real.  As the evidence set forth above shows,\nDefendants have failed to assure that polling places that -- in their own representations -- should\nbe accessible are, in fact, accessible when it matters on election day.  Defendants also have failed\n14\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 17 of 43\nto take reasonable steps to make inaccessible polling places accessible.  As a result, individuals\nwith mobility disabilities (particularly, those who use wheelchairs) are unable to participate in\nthe voting process in the same manner as their friends and neighbors.  Defendants have asserted\nno valid equitable defenses.5\nC.  Plaintiffs Have Succeeded on the Merits of Their Claims.\n1.  Overview of the ADA and RA\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA) is “commonly known as the civil rights bill\nof the disabled,”  Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation (ADAPT) v. Skinner,\n881 F.2d 1184, 1187 (3d Cir. 1989) (en banc), and prohibits disability-based discrimination by\nfederal funding recipients, such as Defendants.  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).6   Recognizing certain\nlimitations of Section 504, Congress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990\nto prohibit discrimination by all public entities, regardless of whether they receive federal\nfunding.  H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 49 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 267, 472.\n5  Defendants contended in their Motion to Dismiss that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the\nsecond Settlement Agreement in National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, Civil Action\nNo. 01-1923 (E.D. Pa.).  See Defs.’ Mem. in Support of its Motion to Dismiss at 15-16.  As detailed\nin Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, this contention\nis doubly flawed.  First, Plaintiffs and class members in this case simply were not parties to that\nlitigation.  They were not and could not be members of the certified class in that case and,\naccordingly, they are not bound by any settlement of that case.  Second, the scope of the release in\nthe second Settlement Agreement would not even bar parties to that Agreement from raising these\nclaims.  See Pls.’ Mem. in Opp. to Defs.’ Motion to Dismiss at 25-28.\n6  Defendants received federal funds in Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006 and were expected to\nreceive federal funding in Fiscal Year 2007.  See City of Philadelphia Fiscal 2007 Operating Budget\nas  Adopted  by  City  Council  (May  25,  2006)  (excerpt  showing  federal  funding  for  City\nCommissioners) (Exh. W); City of Philadelphia Fiscal 2006 Operating Budget as Adopted by City\nCouncil (June 2, 2005) (excerpt showing federal funding for City Commissioners) (Exh. X).\n15\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 18 of 43\nLike Section 504 of the RA, Title II of the ADA broadly prohibits discrimination by public\nentities, such as Defendants.  42 U.S.C. §§ 12131(1), 12132.\nThe RA and ADA reflect Congress’s recognition of the pervasiveness of disability-based\ndiscrimination in society.  Congress specifically found that persons with disabilities “continually\nencounter various forms of discrimination in such critical areas as ... voting ....”  29 U.S.C. §\n701(a)(5) (RA) (emphasis added); 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3) (ADA) (emphasis added).\nGiven the unique and diffuse nature of disability-based discrimination, the Supreme Court\nconcluded that “much of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing the Rehabilitation\nAct ... would be difficult if not impossible to reach were the Act construed to proscribe only\nconduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.”  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 296-97 (1985).\nAccordingly, the concept of “discrimination” under the RA and ADA encompasses more than\ndisparate treatment of people with disabilities vis-à-vis non-disabled individuals.  See Olmstead\nv. L.C., 527 U.S. 581, 598 (1999) (ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 297, 300-01 (RA);\nHelen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 333, 335 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 813 (1995) (ADA);\nNathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, 926 F.2d 1368, 1384 (3d Cir. 1991) (RA).  The\nRA and ADA also prohibit actions by covered entities that have a discriminatory effect on people\nwith disabilities.  See Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 297 (RA); Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Public\nWelfare, 157 F. Supp. 2d 509, 539 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (ADA).  Additionally, these statutes\naffirmatively require that covered entities make reasonable modifications to their policies and\npractices when necessary to accommodate individuals with disabilities, see Olmstead v. L.C., 527\nU.S. at  592 (ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 301 (RA), and assure that people with\n16\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 19 of 43\ndisabilities have “meaningful access” to covered entities’ programs.  Alexander v. Choate, 469\nU.S. at 301 (RA); Chaffin v. Kansas State Fair Bd., 348 F.3d 850, 857 (10th Cir. 2003) (ADA).\nIn addition to the case law, the contours of the broad anti-discrimination mandates of the\nADA and RA have been delineated by regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice\n(DOJ).  The Supreme Court has recognized that DOJ’s “coordination regulations,” 28 C.F.R. Pt.\n41, initially promulgated pursuant to an Executive Order by the Department of Health, Education\nand Welfare, see Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d at 330, properly implement Section 504 of the RA\nand are entitled to deference.  Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 634 (1984).\nThe Third Circuit has held that DOJ’s regulations promulgated under Title II of the ADA, 28\nC.F.R. Pt. 35, pursuant to specific congressional direction, 42 U.S.C. § 12134, have the “force\nof law.”  Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d at 332-33.\n2.  Defendants’ Failure to Assure that Its Polling Places Are\nAccessible on Election Day When It Is Reasonable to Make Them\nAccessible Violates the ADA and the RA.\nDefendants’ actions and inactions in this case violate the ADA and RA in several\noverlapping, yet distinct, respects.  Each constitutes an independent basis to establish liability.\n(a)  Defendants Violate the ADA and RA by Excluding\nIndividuals with Mobility Disabilities from the Voting Process.\nDOJ has issued a detailed checklist that details accessibility standards for polling places.\nDOJ, ADA Checklist for Polling Places (Feb. 2004),  available at http://www.usdoj.gov/\ncrt/ada/votingck.htm.  The evidence establishes that Defendants failed to comply with even the\nmost basic requirements concerning entrances to polling places established by DOJ.  Indeed,\nDefendants failed even to comply with their own accessibility standards.\n17\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 20 of 43\nDefendants designated numerous polling places as accessible (either fully, substantially,\nor through an alternative entrance) that, in fact, were not accessible on Election Day based on\nDefendants’ own criteria as well as the criteria established by DOJ.  Certain polling places that\nDefendants designated as having substantially accessible main entrances (“BL,” “BN,” “RL,”\nor “RN”) in fact neither had accessible main entrances nor accessible alternative entrances.  See,\ndiscussion, supra, at 4-9.  In other words, the polling places were completely inaccessible to\nvoters with mobility impairments contrary to Defendants’ own conclusions that such polling\nplaces can and should be made accessible.  The ADA requires that polling place entrances must\nhave at least one accessible entrance.  ADA Checklist for Polling Places at 19.7  Other polling\nplaces did have accessible alternative entrances, but they were improperly designated by\nDefendants as “FH,” “BL,” or “BN,” rather than “AL” or “AN.”  See discussion, supra, at 9-11.\nMore importantly, many of these polling places with accessible, alternative entrances violated\nDOJ’s accessibility standards because they lacked appropriate signage at the main entrance to\ndirect voters to the accessible entrances and/or because they were locked, see discussion, supra,\nat 9-11, and DOJ mandates that such alternative entrances “must remain open when the polling\nplace is open.”  ADA Checklist for Polling Places at 19, 22.  Aside from the inaccessibility of\npolling places that Defendants themselves had designated as “accessible,” Plaintiffs have\n7  Polling places designated by “BL,” “BN,” “RL,” or “RN” meant, according to Defendants’\nElection Notice, that the polling places were “substantially accessible ... with minor assistance.”\nThis could mean that the entrances could be accessed through temporary ramps, which would be\nconsistent with DOJ’s standards.  See ADA Checklist for Polling Places at 22 (allowing temporary\nramps for one or two steps at the entrance).  If, on the other hand, “minor assistance” means carrying\nvoters, such an alternative would violate the ADA.\n18\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 21 of 43\nestablished that there were polling places designated as inaccessible that could be made\naccessible by relocating them.  See discussion, supra, at 11.\nBy failing to assure the accessibility of their polling places -- including those that they\naffirmatively stated would in fact be accessible to and usable by voters with mobility disabilities\non Election Day -- Defendants discriminated against such individuals in violation of the ADA,\n42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(a), and the RA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. §\n41.51(a).  Specifically, the inaccessibility of these polling places excluded voters with mobility\ndisabilities from participation in and denied them the benefits of Defendants’ services, programs,\nand activities by precluding such individuals from using their local polling places established by\nDefendants where they could vote with their neighbors, meet election judges and party officials,\nand gain information from the candidates’ representatives.  Moreover, the inaccessibility of\npolling places that had been designated by Defendants’ as accessible precluded them from timely\nseeking an alternative ballot since only voters assigned to inaccessible polling places could seek\nsuch a ballot and they were required to do so one week prior to Election Day.  See discussion,\nsupra, at 13.8\n8  A voter with a mobility disability who, upon arriving at his polling place, finds that it is\ninaccessible can file an application for an emergency alternative ballot at the County Board of\nElections by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day.  See The Alternative Ballot:  Voting Accessibility for the\nElderly and Handicapped Act (Exh. Q).  This requires the voter:  (1) to secure and complete an\nEmergency Application after discovering the inaccessibility of the polling place; and (2) deliver it\nto the County Board of Elections in City Hall by the close of polls on Election Day either in person\nor via an agent designated by the voter using Pennsylvania’s forms.  See id.  This is certainly not a\nfeasible solution for most voters with mobility disabilities faced on Election Day with an inaccessible\npolling place.  Such voters are unlikely to be aware of this option.  Even if they are aware of it, they\nwould have to make last minute arrangements to travel to City Hall (and transportation for many\nwith mobility disabilities is difficult) or find someone who could get them an alternative ballot and\nagent designation forms and travel to City Hall on their behalf.\n19\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 22 of 43\n(b)  Defendants Violate the ADA and RA by Failing to Afford Individuals\nwith Mobility Disabilities Equal Opportunity to Participate in the Voting Process.\nDefendants violate the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1), and the\nRA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(1)), by denying or failing to afford individuals\nwith mobility disabilities the opportunity to participate in and benefit from Defendants’ services,\nprograms and activities.  As described above, Defendants’ have failed to assure that all polling\nplaces that could be accessible are, in fact, accessible.  The inaccessibility of neighborhood\npolling places deprives individuals with mobility disabilities of equal opportunity to participate\nin the voting process.  Unlike non-disabled voters, voters with mobility disabilities cannot vote\nat their local polling places with their friends and neighbors on Election Day where they can\nmeet the local election judges and party officials and gain access to information from the\ncandidates’ representatives.  To vote, individuals with mobility disabilities  must  request\nalternative ballots at least one week in advance (and, in doing so, disclose private information\non the nature of their disabilities) and then they must either cast their ballots in advance of\nElection Day or somehow arrange for transportation to City Hall to deliver their ballots on\nElection Day.  Alternative ballots, therefore, do not afford individuals with mobility disabilities\nequal opportunity to participate in Defendants’ voting process.\nIndeed, Defendants’ mistaken designation of many inaccessible sites as accessible\nexacerbates the lack of equal opportunity for two reasons.  First, many individuals with mobility\ndisabilities might not know until they arrive that their polling places are inaccessible, which\ncould be too late to secure an alternative ballot.  Second, only individuals assigned to inacces-\nsible polling places can vote by alternative ballot, so that individuals who are assigned to polling\n20\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 23 of 43\nplaces incorrectly designated as accessible might not be able to use the alternative ballot process\nat all.\n(c)  Defendants Violate the ADA and RA\nthrough Discriminatory Site Selection.\nDefendants violate the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(4), and the\nRA, 29 U.S.C. § 794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(4), by selecting inaccessible polling places, which\nexclude individuals with mobility disabilities from the voting process that is available to and\nused by non-disabled voters and that substantially impair the accomplishment of Defendants’\nobjectives to enable Philadelphia voters to vote in their neighborhoods on Election Day.  In\nNational Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, Civil Action No. 01-1923, 2001 WL\n1231717 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 11, 2001), this Court specifically held that allegations that these Defen-\ndants selected inaccessible polling places -- “depriving mobility impaired voters of the benefit\nof voting in their neighborhood polling places in the same manner as non-disabled voters” --\ngave rise to an actionable claim under the ADA.  Id. at *7.\nDefendants have continued to select inaccessible sites, even though they either could\nmake those sites accessible through temporary alterations or they could choose alternative,\naccessible sites.   See discussion, supra, at 4-9, 11.  Indeed, in one instance in Ward 39, Division\n42, Defendants moved a site from an accessible site to an inaccessible site.  See discussion,\nsupra, at 8.  Defendants’ continued selection of inaccessible sites thus violates the ADA and RA.\n21\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 24 of 43\n(d)  Defendants Violate the ADA and RA by\nUsing Discriminatory Methods of Administration.\nThe ADA and RA prohibit Defendants from using methods of administration that have\nthe effect of subjecting individuals with mobility disabilities to discrimination on the basis of\ntheir disabilities or that defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of Defendants’\nprograms’ objectives. 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(3) (ADA); 29 U.S.C. § 794\nand 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3) (RA).  Defendants have violated the prohibition against discrimi-\nnatory methods of administration in several distinct ways.\nFirst, the Election Notice published by Defendants contains confusing and misleading\ninformation.  The Election Notice is confusing because it uses “BL,” “RL,” “BN,” and “RN” to\ndenote polling places that are “substantially accessible ... with minor assistance” without stating\nwhat, if any, assistance is needed.  The Election Notice is not only confusing, but it actively\nmisleads voters by (1) suggesting that polling places may be accessible in some form even when,\nas detailed above, they are not, and (2) not using the “AL” or “AN” designation for those polling\nplaces accessible by alternative entrances so that, combined with the lack of signage in those\npolling  places,  voters  will  not  know  about  the  availability  of  an  alternative  entrance.\nDefendants’ publication of a misleading and confusing Election Notice substantially impairs the\naccomplishment of their objective to facilitate the ability of Philadelphians to vote in their local\npolling places with respect to voters with mobility disabilities in several ways:  (1) by causing\npeople with mobility disabilities to believe that their local polling places are accessible when,\nin fact, they are not so that they do not timely seek an alternative ballot and they cannot vote in\ntheir local polling places; or, alternatively, (2) by causing voters with mobility disabilities to\n22\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 25 of 43\nconclude that they cannot vote in their local polling places independently (due to the vagueness\nof the “minor assistance” language) when, in fact, those polling places may be accessible and\nindependently usable by such voters.\nSecond, Defendants took no steps to assure that polling places that they claimed should\nand would be made accessible on Election Day in fact were accessible on Election Day.\nTemporary ramps were not provided or, if provided, were not put in place so that they could be\nused.  Other polling places lacked signage to inform voters with mobility disabilities of acces-\nsible entrances and, in some instances, the accessible entrances were locked and doorbells went\nunanswered by election officials.  These methods of administration again substantially impaired\nthe accomplishment of Defendants’ objective to facilitate the ability of Philadelphians to vote\nin their local polling places with respect to voters with mobility disabilities and not to timely\nseek alternative ballots.\nThird, Defendants have refused to relocate inaccessible polling places to accessible\nlocations in the same or adjacent divisions when it is feasible to do so.  Plaintiffs have provided\nexamples of inaccessible polling places that could be relocated, but, they remain in inaccessible\nlocations.  Defendants’ failure to act to relocate these and other inaccessible polling places that\ncould be relocated substantially impairs the accomplishment of Defendants’ objective to\nfacilitate the ability of Philadelphians to vote in their local polling places with respect to voters\nwith mobility disabilities.\n23\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 26 of 43\n(e)  Defendants Violate the ADA and RA by Failing to Make\nReasonable Modifications in their Policies, Practices, and Procedures.\nIt is well established that the ADA and RA require Defendants to make reasonable\nmodifications to their policies, practices, and procedures to avoid discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7) (ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. at 301 (RA).\nDefendants violate the ADA and RA by failing to make reasonable modifications in their\npolicies,  practices,  and  procedures  to  avoid  discrimination  against  voters  with  mobility\ndisabilities.\nDefendants have incorrectly designated a number of polling places as accessible.  Most\nof these polling places can be accessible and should be accessible on Election Day.  It merely\nrequires that Defendants assure, for example, that temporary ramps are in fact both provided to\nthe polling place and set up to be used by voters with mobility disabilities during polling hours;\nthat appropriate signage is actually posted in locations to alert voters with mobility disabilities\nwhere those alternative accessible entrances can be found when the main entrances are inacces-\nsible; and that alternative, accessible entrances are unlocked during voting hours so that persons\nwith mobility disabilities can freely and independently and without assistance access the polling\nplace like non-disabled voters.  Yet, Defendants have failed to take the reasonable steps\nnecessary to assure that these minor modifications -- modifications that they effectively agreed\nto make -- are in place on Election Day to enable individuals with mobility disabilities to vote\n24\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 27 of 43\nin the same way as their friends and neighbors.  By failing to take such reasonable steps,\nDefendants violate the ADA and RA.9\n(f)  Defendants Violate the ADA and RA by Failing\nto Provide Services in the Most Integrated Settings.\nThe Supreme Court and Third Circuit have acknowledged that states have an obligation\nunder the ADA to provide services for persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting\nappropriate to their needs.  See Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. at 600-01; Helen L. v. DiDario, 46\nF.3d 325, 334-35; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d) (ADA); 29 U.S.C. §\n794 and 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) (RA).  Accessible polling places are the most integrated setting in\nwhich individuals with disabilities can vote since it offers them the opportunity to vote with their\nnon-disabled neighbors and have access to election officials and ward leaders in the same way\nas their non-disabled neighbors.  In contrast, voting by alternative ballot is done in isolation in\nadvance of election day.  It is a completely segregated process.\nDefendants force many voters with mobility disabilities to use the segregated alternative\nballot  process (or not to vote) because it has failed to assure that its polling places are accessible\nwhen it is reasonable to do so.  Indeed, as detailed above, Defendants have failed even to assure\nthat polling places that they concede should be accessible are, in fact, accessible on Election\nDay.  Defendants thus violate the ADA’s and RA’s integration mandates by failing to administer\ntheir services, programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of\n9  Another reasonable modification is to assure that the Election Notice published in\nnewspapers prior to Election Day is clear and accurate concerning accessibility of polling places.\nPolling places that are inaccessible should not be designated as accessible.  Polling places that have\nalternative, accessible entrances should be denoted as “AL” or “AN” and not some other accessibility\ndesignation.\n25\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 28 of 43\nthe individual.  Cf. Lovely H. v. Eggleston, 235 F.R.D. 248, 261 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (holding that\nassignment of beneficiaries with disabilities to segregated services “violates the mandate that\npersons with disabilities be given the opportunity to participate in mainstream service delivery\nmechanisms”).\n(g)  Defendants Violate the ADA and RA by Failing to Assure Program Access.\n(1)  Defendants Have Failed to Assure the Accessibility of Each\nPolling Place that Could Reasonably Be Made Accessible, Including\nThose That They Have Designated As Accessible.\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that the removal of architectural barriers is necessary\nto rectify the harms resulting from the effects of discrimination.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S.\nat 297.  The Third Circuit, too,  has acknowledged that one “goal of the ADA” is “the\nelimination of architectural barriers that presently preclude those with disabilities from full and\nequal participation in society.”  Kinney v. Yerusalim, 9 F.3d 1067, 1072 n.5 (3d Cir. 1993)\n(emphasis added),  cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1033 (1994); accord 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(5) (“indivi-\nduals with disabilities continually encounter discrimination, including ... the discriminatory\neffects of architectural ... barriers ....”).  For existing facilities, the ADA and RA require\n“program accessibility.”  42 U.S.C. § 12132 and 28 C.F.R. § 35.150 (ADA); 29 U.S.C. § 794\nand 28 C.F.R. § 41.57 (RA).  Program accessibility mandates that public entities assure that each\nprogram or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals\nwith disabilities.  28 C.F.R. §§ 35.150, 41.57. \nEach polling place is a unique program because registered voters are required to vote only\nin their assigned polling place and cannot select an alternative, accessible polling place.  As such,\n26\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 29 of 43\neach polling place must be accessible unless Defendants can show that doing so would result in\na fundamental alteration or undue burden.   See 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.150(c).\nIn this case, Plaintiffs have presented representative evidence that there are a number of\npolling places that can feasibly be made accessible in accordance with DOJ’s ADA Checklist for\nPolling Places.10   See discussion, supra, at 4-11.  Indeed, many of these are polling places that\nDefendants themselves have determined can and should be accessible.  Others are polling places\nthat Defendants have designated as inaccessible, but that could readily be made accessible by,\nfor example, relocation to other accessible sites within the same division or an adjacent\ndivision.11  Defendants’ failure to assure that each polling place is accessible if it can be made\naccessible (either through modifications or relocation to alternative accessible sites) thus violates\nthe ADA’s and RA’s program access mandates.\n(2)  Defendants Cannot Avoid Liability on Plaintiffs’\nProgram Access Claim Either By Asserting that the “Program” Is\nAll Polling Places or By Relying on the Alternative Ballot Process.\nDefendants have argued that they comply with the program access mandates of the ADA\nand RA because their “program” consists of all Philadelphia polling places and, since some of\ntheir polling places are accessible, their program is accessible “when viewed in its entirety” as\n10  Defendants have the burden to demonstrate that it would be an undue burden or\nfundamental  alteration  to  make  inaccessible  polling  places  accessible  through  temporary\nmodifications or relocation to accessible locations in the same or adjacent divisions.  See US\nAirways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 402 (2002); Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Public Welfare, 364 F.3d\nat 492 n.4; Juvelis ex rel. Juvelis v. Dep’t of Public Welfare, 68 F.3d 648, 653 & n.5 (3d Cir. 1995);\n28 C.F.R. § 35.150(c). \n11  For example, Ward 15, Division 12, which is located in an inaccessible church, is directly\nacross  from  an  accessible  nursing  home  and  near  other  accessible  locations,  including  the\nPhiladelphia Nursing Home and Girard College.  See discussion, supra, at 11.\n27\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 30 of 43\nrequired by the program access mandates.  Defendants’ characterization of the program is simply\nincorrect.12  Each voter in Philadelphia is permitted to vote only in her assigned polling place;\nshe does not have the option of voting in an alternative, accessible location.  Thus, each polling\nplace constitutes a unique program and each must be accessible.\nDOJ’s Technical Assistance Manual offers useful guidance, providing several examples\nof how the ADA’s program accessibility mandate works, including the following:\nILLUSTRATION  2:    D,  a  defendant  in  a  civil  suit,  has  a\nrespiratory condition that prevents her from climbing steps.  Civil\nsuits are routinely heard in a courtroom on the second floor of the\ncourthouse.  The courthouse has no elevator or other means of\naccess to the second floor.  The public entity must relocate the\nproceedings  to  an accessible  ground  floor  courtroom  or  take\nalternative  steps,  including  moving  the  program  to  another\nbuilding, in order to allow D to participate in the civil suit.\nILLUSTRATION 3:  A State provides ten rest areas approximately\n50 miles apart along an interstate highway.  Program accessibility\nrequires that an accessible toilet room for each sex with at least one\naccessible stall, or a unisex bathroom, be provided at each rest\narea.\nDOJ,  ADA  Title  II  Technical  Assistance  Manual  §  II-5.1000  (1993),  available  at\nhttp://www.ada.gov/taman2.html.\nIn Illustration 2, the “program” is not the right to pursue or defend civil actions generally.\nThus, it is not enough that the litigant’s counsel could attend the proceedings or that the court\nwould accept the litigant’s deposition testimony in lieu of in-person attendance.  Rather, the\n12  Moreover, Defendants’ argument that their program is accessible when viewed in its\nentirety applies only to Plaintiffs’ program access claim and does not address Plaintiffs’ other,\nindependent claims under the ADA and RA that are discussed above.\n28\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 31 of 43\n“program” encompasses the right to fully participate in the process.  Since the litigant could not\nparticipate in his case in an inaccessible location, he was excluded from the program “when\nviewed in its entirety.”  Similarly, the “program” in the instant case is not merely the opportunity\nto cast a ballot.  The program is the voting process that takes place at each voter’s assigned,\nneighborhood polling location where she can vote with friends and neighbors on Election Day,\nmeet and speak with neighborhood election judges and party officials, and receive information\nabout the candidates like her non-disabled neighbors.\nIllustration 3 provides an even more apt analogy.  In that case, DOJ opined that all\nhighway rest areas must be made accessible to satisfy the ADA’s program accessibility mandate.\nGiven the distance between rest areas, each rest area must be considered to be a discrete program\nsince many drivers will not be driving through the entire highway system to reach the accessible\nrest area.  If fewer than all the rest stops are accessible, drivers will be subject to a de facto denial\nof access to the program.  This case presents an even more egregious situation.  This is not a\nmatter merely of a voter having to travel to an accessible polling place at some distance since the\nvoter is wholly precluded from choosing an alternative, accessible polling place.\nDefendants also cannot rely on the alternative ballot process to satisfy their program\naccess obligation.  Although “non-structural” options may sometimes be considered in deter-\nmining whether there has been compliance with the program access mandate, 28 C.F.R. §\n35.150(b), DOJ has stressed that such non-structural options may not always be sufficient to\ncomply with the ADA and that, in some cases, only physical access will satisfy the mandate.\n“When choosing a method of providing program access, a public entity must give priority to the\n29\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 32 of 43\none that results in the most integrated setting appropriate to encourage interaction among all\nusers, including individuals with disabilities.”  ADA Title II Technical Assistance Manual § II-\n5.2000.  Thus, if there is only one facility that provides the service and it can be made accessible,\npublic entities should give priority to making the facility accessible rather than using alternative\nmethods.  Id.   More importantly, non-structural access to the program cannot satisfy the program\naccessibility mandate unless the non-structural alternative is truly equivalent to physical access\nto the program facilities.  For example, DOJ notes that a public university can provide program\naccess by retrieving books from upper floors in a building that has no elevators so long as the\nassistance is provided during the operating hours of the library.  Id. (Illustration 2).  In other\nwords, the patrons with mobility disabilities must have access to the same books at the same time\nand at the same facility as non-disabled patrons.\nA technical assistance letter from DOJ provides more specific guidance relating to\nacceptable, non-structural alternatives to requiring that public entities make all polling places\nphysically accessible.   DOJ, Letter to Judy Steelman (Aug. 3, 1993), available at http://\nwww.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/ltr216.htm (Exh. Y).  Arkansas had inquired whether, in lieu of making\nall of its polling places accessible, it could satisfy the ADA by reassigning voters to accessible\npolling places if they requested a reassignment 30 days in advance.  DOJ advised that the ADA’s\nprogram accessibility mandate allows alternatives to accessible polling places only if the\nalternatives are “effective in providing a person with a disability the equal opportunity to cast a\nballot on the day of the election.”  Id. (emphasis in original).  Given that standard, DOJ indicated\nthat “requiring a person with a disability to travel [to a reassigned polling place] approximately\n30\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 33 of 43\nthe same distance as a person who is not disabled in a particular voting area would meet the\nrequirements of title II; however, requiring a person with a disability to travel significantly more\nthan a person who is not disabled would not meet the requirements of title II.”  Id.  While\nreassignment,  as  a  concept,  might  be  feasible,  DOJ  rejected  the  state’s  advance  notice\nrequirement:  “An advance notice requirement cannot be enforced to prevent him or her from\ncasting a ballot.”  Id.\nIn light of DOJ’s guidance in its Technical Assistance Manual and letter, the Court cannot\nconclude that the alternative ballot process is an effective alternative to polling place accessibility\nto assure that voters with mobility disabilities have access to the voting process.  To the contrary,\nthe facts demonstrate that the alternative ballot process does not afford voters with mobility\ndisabilities access to the voting process that is as effective as accessible polling places.\n# The alternative ballot process requires voters with mobility disabilities to submit\napplications for alternative ballots one week in advance of Election Day.  DOJ\nindicated in its technical assistance letter to Arkansas that an advance notice\nrequirement to make use of the alternative voting process would violate the\nADA’s program access mandate.\n# The alternative ballot process requires voters with mobility disabilities to disclose\nthe private nature of their disabilities and to identify their physicians while other\nvoters can vote without disclosure of private health care information.\n# The alternative ballot process requires voters with mobility disabilities either to\nvote in advance of Election Day or to make travel arrangements to City Hall to\nsubmit their ballot on Election Day.  Voting in advance of Election Day is not\nequivalent to polling place accessibility that allows voters to vote on Election\nDay.  Requiring voters to travel to City Hall (when non-disabled voters must only\ntravel a few blocks) is not effective.  As DOJ opined in its technical assistance\nletter to Arkansas, an effective, non-structural program access method would not\nrequire voters with disabilities “to travel significantly more than a person who is\nnot disabled.”\n31\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 34 of 43\n# The alternative ballot process may not even provide an available, much less\neffective, alternative for those voters with mobility disabilities who are assigned\nto inaccessible polling places that the Defendants have designated as accessible.\n# The  alternative  ballot  process  results  in  segregated  voting.    Voters  with\ndisabilities vote in isolation.  DOJ has indicated that a segregated alternative is not\nan appropriate method for providing program access.  ADA Title II Technical\nAssistance Manual § II-5.2000.\nDOJ’s construction accords with this Court’s analysis in National Organization on\nDisability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1231717 at *3-*7.  In denying the motion to dismiss a\nchallenge by voters with mobility disabilities to the City’s failure to provide accessible polling\nplaces, the Court acknowledged the plaintiffs’ allegations that the alternative ballot process “is\nsubstantially different from, more burdensome than, and more intrusive than the voting process\nused by non-disabled voters” and that “Defendants have had the opportunity to alleviate these\nbarriers by ... choosing polling places which would be accessible to persons with mobility\nimpairments.”  Id. at *3.13\n13  NAACP v. Philadelphia Bd. of Elections, Civil Action No. 97-7085, 1998 WL 321253\n(E.D. Pa. June 16, 1998), is not at odds with this Court’s decision in National Organization on\nDisability v. Tartaglione.  Concerned that the alternative ballot process created an opportunity for\nfraud, the plaintiff in NAACP sought to prevent use of alternative ballots in non-federal elections on\nthe basis that the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped (VAEH) Act, 42 U.S.C. §\n1973ee-1 et seq., permitted the use of alternative ballots only in federal elections.  The question,\naccording to the court, was simply whether the use of alternative ballots in non-federal elections is\nprohibited by law.  Id. at *2.  In answering the question in the negative, the court noted that the ADA\nrequired defendants to make accommodations for voters in all elections and concluded:  “The VAEH\nprocedures are a reasonable modification under the ADA ....”  Id. at *5 (emphasis added).  As this\nCourt recognized in National Organization on Disability v. Tartaglione, 2001 WL 1231717 at *3,\nNAACP is not controlling because the court in that case was not asked to -- and did not -- address\nthe question raised in this case, i.e., whether the ADA requires Defendants to take steps other than\nthe alternative ballot process to avoid discrimination  and provide equal access to the voting process.\n32\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 35 of 43\nFurthermore, Defendants cannot assert that the availability of the alternative ballot\nprocess is a defense to Plaintiffs’ program access claim to the extent that Plaintiffs challenge\nDefendants’ failure to assure the accessibility of those polling places that they concede can be\nand should be accessible in fact are accessible on Election Day.   Acting in accordance with\nCongress’s direction in Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12134, DOJ promulgated regulations\ngoverning accessibility of public entities’ facilities and services.   28 C.F.R. §§ 35.149-35.151.\nWhile DOJ required that public entities assure that all new facilities and all existing facilities that\nare altered must be accessible, it only mandated “program access” for existing facilities.  See id.;\n28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. § 35.150; Kinney v. Yerusalim, 812 F. Supp. 547, 548 (E.D. Pa.), aff’d,\n9 F.3d 1067, 1073 & n.6 (3d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1033 (1994).  This scheme serves\n“ultimately to create a society providing physical accessibility to persons with disabilities” by\nassuring that, over time as new facilities are built or existing ones are altered, they are made in\na manner that is accessible to and usable by people with mobility disabilities.  See Kinney, 812\nF. Supp. at 548.\nThe program access standard thus assured that public entities would not have to undertake\ncostly retrofitting of all of their facilities to make them immediately accessible when the ADA\nbecame effective as long as the program as a whole is accessible.  The program access standard,\nhowever, surely cannot excuse public entities who choose to decrease the amount of accessibility\non the basis that the program as a whole is accessible.  For example, if a public school district\nhad four elementary schools when the ADA became effective and two were accessible, it would\nmeet the program access requirements even though children with mobility disabilities who live\n33\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 36 of 43\nin neighborhoods served by the inaccessible schools would have to be transported to the\naccessible schools.  Program access would not require the school district to make the two\ninaccessible facilities accessible unless and until the district decided to alter them.  The school\ndistrict, though, cannot make one of the accessible schools inaccessible (e.g., removing the ramp\nbecause skateboarders are using it) and contend that it satisfies the ADA because all children\nwith mobility disabilities can travel to the one remaining accessible school.  So, too, the school\ndistrict could not make both of the accessible schools inaccessible and defend against an ADA\nchallenge by asserting that it will offer home schooling to the youngsters with disabilities.\nLovely H. v. Eggleston is analogous.  In that case, the court enjoined the defendants’\nreassignment of people with disabilities from neighborhood centers for benefits to centers that\nserve primarily people with disabilities.  The court explained that the defendants’ actions “turn\nback the clock not only for the individual who is denied access to the neighborhood center that\nwelcomes his able-bodied neighbors, but also for a society that  has made tremendous efforts and\nstrides to improve, rather than constrict, accessibility for and integration of the disabled into all\naspects of mainstream life.”  235 F.R.D. at 262.\nDefendants have publicly stated that there are a great many polling places that can be and\nwill  be  made  accessible  so  that  voters  with  mobility  disabilities  can  vote  in  their  own\nneighborhoods on Election Day.  Yet, some of these polling places, in fact, are not accessible on\nElection Day.  In effect, Defendants have decreased access that existed.  It would be wholly at\nodds with the ADA’s goal of expanding access over time to allow Defendants to contend that\n34\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 37 of 43\nit can decrease polling place accessibility because the alternative ballot process is sufficient to\nprovide program access.\nD.  The Balance of Equities Weighs Heavily in Favor of Injunctive Relief.\nDefendants’ continued failure to maximize the accessibility of neighborhood polling\nplaces -- including their failure to assure the accessibility on Election Day of polling places that\nthey concede should be accessible -- significantly harms individuals with mobility disabilities,\nparticularly those who use wheelchairs.14  “The anti-segregation laws upon which Plaintiffs rely\nreflect important public policy commitments to equality and access.”  Lovely H. v. Eggleston,\n235 F.R.D. at 262.  Discrimination stemming from lack of equal access constitutes irreparable\nharm.  See Layton v. Elder, 143 F.3d 469, 472 (8th Cir. 1998) (lack of access to courthouse for\nperson with mobility disability creates irreparable harm).  So, too, “[i]njuries to individual\ndignity and deprivations of civil rights,” such as those endured by many Philadelphia voters with\nmobility disabilities who cannot vote in their neighborhood polling places or must use difficult\nor embarrassing alternative means of access (such as being carried or using crutches or walkers\nin lieu of wheelchairs), also constitutes irreparable harm.  See Cupolo v. Bay Area Rapid Transit,\n5 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1084 (N.D. Cal. 1997); ; see also Burriola v. Greater Toledo YMCA, 133\n14  There is some “tension” within the Third Circuit’s decisions as to whether irreparable\nharm must be proven in order to secure a permanent injunction, as opposed to a preliminary\ninjunction.  See Stolt-Nielsen, S.A. v. United States, 442 F.3d 177, 184 n.5 (3d Cir.) (discussing\ntension), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 127 S. Ct. 494 (2006).  Here, of course, Philadelphia voters with\nmobility disabilities will experience irreparable harm due  to  their inability to vote in their\nneighborhood polling places due to inaccessibility or to vote in their polling places only with\ndifficulty or embarrassment (such as being carried or pulling themselves up the stairs).  Only\ninjunctive relief, not monetary damages, will afford these individuals complete relief.  As such, the\nharm is irreparable.  See Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994).\n35\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 38 of 43\nF. Supp. 2d 1034, 1040 (N.D. Ohio 2001) (“the irreparable harm requirement is met when the\ninjuries plaintiff would incur are ‘the very type of injuries Congress tried to avoid.’”).  More\nspecifically, the inability of an individual with a disability to vote in his assigned polling place\nconstitutes irreparable harm.  Westchester Disabled on the Move, Inc.  v. County of Westchester,\n346 F. Supp. 2d 473, 477-78 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).  The harm inflicted in this case is particularly\noutrageous since Defendants “turn[ed] back the clock” with respect to their failure to make\naccessible those polling places that they had designated as accessible.  Lovely H. v. Eggleston,\n235 F.R.D. at 262.\nThe public interest also weighs in favor of the injunctive relief.  “‘[T]he passage of the\n[ADA] itself is an implied finding by Congress that violations will harm the public.’”  Lonberg\nv. City of Riverside, No. EDCV970237SGLAJWX, 2007 WL 2005177 at *7 (C.D. Cal. May 16,\n2007); see also Burriola v. Greater Toledo YMCA, 133 F. Supp. 2d at 1040 (“There is no doubt\nthat protecting against violations of federal laws serves the public interest.  Additionally, the\npurpose of the ADA is served by injunctive relief aimed to prevent further discrimination against\nan individual with a disability.”); Deck v. Toledo, 29 F. Supp. 2d 431, 434 (N.D. Ohio 1998)\n(“‘there is a significant public interest in eliminating discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities’”).  The “public interest strongly favors mandating accessibility.”  Layton v. Elder,\n143 F.3d at 472.   The public interest also favors enforcement of the ADA’s integration mandate.\nKathleen S. v. Dep’t of Public Welfare, 10 F. Supp. 2d 476, 481 (E.D. Pa. 1998). \nAccordingly, both the interests of individuals with mobility disabilities and the public\ninterest strongly favor the issuance of injunctive relief to assure that Defendants comply with the\n36\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 39 of 43\nADA by maximizing the accessibility of their polling places so as to assure integration of people\nwith disabilities into community life.\nII.  THE COURT’S PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHOULD\nINCLUDE THE APPOINTMENT OF AN EXPERT AND AN\nORDER THAT INCLUDES SANCTIONS FOR CONTINUING VIOLATIONS.\nThe Court’s equitable powers to fashion an appropriate remedy for Defendants’ continued\nfailure to maximize the accessibility of its polling places are expansive:\nOnce a right and a violation have been shown, the scope of a\ndistrict court’s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is broad,\nfor breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable remedies.\n“The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the\npower of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould\neach decree to the necessities of the particular case.\nFlexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.\nThe qualities of mercy and practicality have made\nequity  the  instrument  for  nice  adjustment  and\nreconciliation between public interest and private\nneeds ....”\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 15 (1971) (quoting Hecht Co. v.\nBowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330 (1944)); accord United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 183-84\n(1987) (plurality); Liberty Resources, Inc. v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Auth.,\nCivil Action No. 99-4837, 2001 WL 1047061 at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 30, 2001), vacated as moot,\n54 Fed. Appx. 769 (3d Cir. 2002).\nSeveral elements are necessary in this case to fashion an appropriate, effective remedy\nto assure maximum polling place accessibility for voters with mobility disabilities.  First, it is\nimportant to assure that all polling places designated by Defendants as accessible are, in fact,\naccessible on Election Days, including the forthcoming primary on April 22, 2008 and general\n37\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 40 of 43\nelection on November 4, 2008.  Second, an expert should be appointed to inspect all of\nPhiladelphia’s polling places on actual Election Days both to:  (1) identify any polling places that\nthe City identified as accessible that are not accessible; and (2) evaluate those polling places that\nthe City identified as inaccessible to determine whether they can be made accessible through\nmodifications or relocation.  Third, the expert should make recommendations for polling places\ndesignated as inaccessible with respect to either modifications or relocations to other accessible\nlocations within the same division or an adjacent division.  These determinations should be\nadopted by the Court unless the Defendants can establish it would be a fundamental alteration\nor undue burden to do so.  Fourth, the Court must provide for some form of sanctions to penalize\nDefendants for failure to assure that polling places designated as accessible now or in the future\nare in fact accessible.  Finally, there must be continued vigilance until it becomes clear that\nDefendants have come into compliance with federal accessibility mandates.\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs specifically request that the Court issue an injunction with the\nfollowing requirements:\n1. Defendants must assure that all polling places designated by Defendants as\naccessible (fully, substantially, partially, or through alternative entrances) must\nin  future  elections    meet  the  accessibility  requirements  established  by  the\nDepartment of Justice in ADA Checklist for Polling Places.  This includes, but is\nnot limited to, assuring access, if needed, by having appropriate ramps in place\nduring voting hours, providing appropriate signage for alternative entrances, and\nassuring that entrances are not locked during voting hours.\n38\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 41 of 43\n2. The Court should appoint an expert selected by Plaintiffs and paid for by\nDefendants with the obligation to (1) hire staff; (2) inspect each polling place\ndesignated as accessible (fully, substantially, or through an alternative entrance)\nin the upcoming primary election scheduled for April 22, 2008 and the general\nelection scheduled for November 4, 2008 to determine whether it in fact is\naccessible in accordance with the standards established by the Department of\nJustice in ADA Checklist for Polling Places (including, assuring that ramps are\nin place, appropriate signage is posted, and doors are unlocked); (3) inspect each\npolling place that the Defendants have designated as inaccessible in the primary\nelection scheduled for April 22, 2008 to determine whether it can be made\naccessible in accordance with the ADA Checklist for Polling Places and, if not,\nwhether there are alternative accessible locations available within the division or\nan adjacent division to which it can be relocated; and (4) issue reports to the Court\nand counsel on its findings concerning the primary within sixty (60) days after\neach election (including, in the report issued following the primary election,\nrecommendations for modifications or relocations for polling places identified as\ninaccessible.\n3. Prior to the general election in 2008, the Court should order Defendants to\nimplement any recommendations of the expert to make inaccessible polling places\naccessible (through modifications or relocations) unless Defendants can establish\nthat doing so would constitute a fundamental alteration.\n39\n\nCase 2:07-cv-00687-JP   Document 32   Filed 01/11/08   Page 42 of 43\n4. The Court should impose sanctions against the Defendants if polling places that\nare supposed to be accessible are determined by the expert to be inaccessible in\neither the primary or general election in 2008.\n5. The Court should allow for further expert reviews in subsequent elections if\nnecessary in light of the findings with respect to the 2008 general election.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Permanent Injunction and order the equitable relief described above.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDated: January 11, 2008 By: /s/ Robert W.
