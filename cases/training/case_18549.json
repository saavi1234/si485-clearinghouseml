WORTH DIVISION \n \n \nDISABILITY RIGHTS TEXAS,  § \nPlaintiff,   §    CIVIL ACTION NO.14-cv-715 \n                  v.  § \n  § \nMANSFIELD INDEPENDENT   § \nSCHOOL DISTRICT and   § \nDr. JIM VASZAUSKAS,  § \nin his Official Capacity as  § \nSuperintendent,    § \n  § \nDefendants.  § \n \n \n \n \nPLAINTIFF’S ORIGINAL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY \n AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n \n  COMES NOW, Plaintiff, Disability Rights Texas and files this, it’s Original Complaint \nfor Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against Defendants Mansfield Independent School District, \nand Dr. Jim Vaszauskas Superintendent, in his Official Capacity, and, accordingly, respectfully \nshows the following: \nI.  PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n1.  Plaintiff, Disability Rights Texas (“DRTx”), is the designated protection and advocacy \nsystem for the state of Texas.  Under Federal law, DRTx’s mandate is to protect and advocate on \nbehalf of individuals with mental or physical disabilities and to investigate incidents of abuse or \nneglect. See the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (“PADD Act”), 42 \nU.S.C. § 15041 et seq., the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (“PAIR Act”), 29 \nU.S.C. § 794e et seq., and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 2 of 10   PageID 2\n(“PAIMI Act”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-10827.  (These three laws are hereafter collectively referred to \nas the “P&A Acts.”). \n  2.  In accordance with these federal mandates, DRTx has authority to access records, \nincluding the names and contact information of guardians for the purposes of investigating incidents \nof abuse or neglect.  Consistent with DRTx’s federal mandate, DRTx requested access to the names \nand contact information of the guardians of Mansfield Independent School District (“MISD”) \nstudents in the SUCCESS Program at Annette Perry Elementary School (“APE”) during the 2013-\n2014 school year, as well as those scheduled to be in the SUCCESS classroom for the 2014-2015 \nschool year, in order to investigate serious allegations of abuse and neglect of these students. \nDefendants  have  refused  to  provide  DRTx  access  to  these  documents  alleging  that  they  are \nconfidential. \n  3.  By this action, DRTx seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this Court requiring \nthe Defendants to provide the requested information—the names, addresses, and telephone numbers \nof the guardians of students who were in the SUCCESS classroom at APE for the 2013-2014 school \nyear and of the students assigned to the classroom for the 2014-2015 school year—so that DRTx \nmay fulfill its statutory duties and investigate the alleged incidents of abuse and/or neglect.   \n \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  4.  This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343(a)(3) since Plaintiff \nDRTx, brings this action under 42 U.S.C.  § 1983 for injunctive and declaratory relief to redress \nDefendants’ violation of the PADD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15041, et seq., the PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e, \net seq., and the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 3 of 10   PageID 3\n  5.  This Court has authority to grant Plaintiff’s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n  6.  Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as all of the events \nand omissions included in this complaint occurred on MISD properties serving students from \nTarrant, Ellis and Johnson Counties.  \n   \nIII.  PARTIES \n  7.  Plaintiff, DRTx, is the federally mandated Protection and Advocacy System (“P&A”) \nfor the State of Texas, established pursuant to the PADD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15001 et seq., the PAIR \nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794e, and the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq.  DRTx has been designated by \nthe Governor of Texas as the P&A for the State of Texas. \n  8.  Defendant Mansfield Independent School District is a school district located in Tarrant \nCounty, Texas, and established pursuant to the Constitution of the State of Texas and the Texas \nEducation Code.  MISD is responsible for the operation of all the public schools within its boundaries \nand for implementing the state’s system of public education and ensuring student performance in \naccordance with the Texas Education Code and its implementing regulations.  Defendant MISD can \nbe served with a copy of this complaint by serving the President of the Board of Trustees, Dr. Michael \nEvans, at 605 East Broad Street, Mansfield, Texas 76063. \n  9.  Defendant Dr. Jim Vaszauskas is sued in his official capacity as Superintendent of \nMISD and serves as the educational leader and the chief executive officer of the school district. He \nis  responsible  for  “assuming  administrative  responsibility  and  leadership  for  the  planning, \norganization,  operation,  supervision,  and  evaluation  of  the  education  programs,  services,  and \nfacilities of the district” and is responsible for ensuring the implementation of district policies.  Tex. \n3 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 4 of 10   PageID 4\nEd. Code § 11.201(d)(1); Tex. Ed. Code § 11.1512 (a).  Defendant Vaszauskas can be served with a \ncopy of this complaint at his place of business located at 605 East Broad Street, Mansfield, Texas \n76063. \n  10.   “Defendants”,  as  used  herein,  refers  to  all  Defendants,  its  agents,  employees, \nsuccessors and all persons acting in concert with them or at their direction. \n \nIV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n  11.  Congress enacted the P&A Acts after extensive congressional investigations found \nthat existing state systems for monitoring compliance with respect to the abuse and neglect of persons \nwith disabilities residing in institutions vary widely and are frequently inadequate to protect these \nindividuals.  In order to ensure that the fox was no longer guarding the hen house, Congress mandated \nthat each state have a ‘protection and advocacy system’ designed to have independent access to \ninstitutions and records in order to detect and prevent abuse and neglect.  Because the State of Texas \nreceives federal funds under the P&A Acts, it is required to designate a system that is designed to \nboth protect and advocate the rights of individuals with disabilities, and that also investigates \nincidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 10801, et seq.; \n42 U.S.C. § 15001, et seq.   \n  12.  Annette Perry Elementary is a school within the MISD and is located at 1261 South \nMain Street in Mansfield, Texas.   \n  13.  APE operates a program for students who require specialized social and behavioral \ninstruction, which they call the SUCCESS class.  The SUCCESS Program Guidelines and Overview \nindicate that most students in the SUCCESS program will have a disability of an Emotional \nDisturbance. \n4 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 5 of 10   PageID 5\n  14.  The SUCCESS program utilizes what they call calm rooms or blue rooms (“calm/blue \nrooms”) district wide.  The APE campus SUCCESS program has two of these rooms.  One measures \n80 square feet and the other is 58.5 square feet.   \n  15.  The calm/blue rooms are used when APE staff determine that a student’s behavior \nwarrants removing them from the SUCCESS classroom.  There is no limit to the amount of time a \nstudent is to be placed in the calm/blue room, and after placing a student in the room, APE teachers \nhold the door shut so the students cannot get out, thus turning the calm/blue room into seclusion. \n  16.  SUCCESS guidelines for classroom rules and consequences state that if a student is \nremoved to the calm/blue room two or more times, the student must remain in “isolation for the \nremainder of the day.”  Moreover, “[s]tudents’ [sic] who engage in physical aggression will move to \nthe isolation center for the remainder of the day or the following day depending on when the \naggression occurs.”    \n  17.  On or about April 17, 2014 DRTx obtained information from multiple news sources \nand social media outlets alleging the overuse of these seclusion rooms at Annette Perry Elementary, \nparticularly with students with disabilities.  The media sources raised concerns about the length of \ntime students were being placed in seclusion, whether students were being “transported” to the \ncalm/blue rooms safely and appropriately, and whether guardians of students in the SUCCESS class \nwere appropriately notified about restraints used to transport students to the calm/blue rooms as \nrequired by the Texas Education Code.   \n  18.  The media complaints, along with information obtained through public sources, and \nDRTx’s work on restraint and seclusion issues provided DRTx with reasonable grounds to believe \nthat students with disabilities in APE’s SUCCESS program may be subject to abuse or neglect. Based \non the complaint and DRTx’s determination of probable cause to believe APE SUCCESS students \n5 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 6 of 10   PageID 6\nmaybe being abused and/or neglected, DRTx began a full investigation into the use of the calm/blue \nrooms, as required of the organization under its federal P&A authority. \n  19.  In a letter dated June 5, 2014, DRTx wrote to Dr. Vaszauskas, as Superintendent of \nMISD, informing him that in light of the allegations of abuse and neglect of students in the SUCCESS \nclass, DRTx would be conducting an investigation into the use of calm/blue rooms at APE.  In this \nletter, DRTx requested the names of all students assigned to the SUCCESS classroom for the 2013-\n2014 and upcoming 2014-2015 school years, as well as the names, addresses, and telephone numbers \nof the students’ parents or guardians. DRTx outlined its P&A authority and why the information was \nnecessary to conduct a full investigation.  DRTx noted in the letter that privacy protections in the \nFamily Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) do not prevent MISD from being able to \nprovide the requested information. \n  20.  In a letter dated June 10, 2014, Defendant MISD, responded to DRTx’s request stating \nthat  MISD  would  not  be  releasing  the  requested  information,  because    MISD  “believes  the \ninformation requested is confidential and not subject to release” under FERPA and the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”).   \n  21.  On June 16, 2014, DRTx responded to MISD’s concerns and provided additional \nstatutory authority and case law demonstrating that MISD’s concerns under FERPA and IDEA raised \nwere unfounded.  \n  22.  On June 25, 2014, DRTx received a second letter from MISD stating that MISD would \nnot release the requested information “absent parent consent, subpoena, or a court order.”  \n  23.  Defendants, in refusing to provide DRTx with the information necessary to conduct \nan investigation and authorized to be released to DRTx under its P&A authority, substantially impair, \nlimit, and impede DRTx’s ability to investigate serious allegations of abuse and neglect. As a result \n6 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 7 of 10   PageID 7\nof  Defendants’  refusal,  DRTx  has  been  prevented  from  carrying  out  an  essential  statutory \nresponsibility, investigating incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities, and \ntherefore has suffered harm for which there is no remedy at law.  \n \nV.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: \nVIOLATION OF THE PADD, PAIR, AND PAIMI ACTS \n \n  24.  DRTx restates and incorporates each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 \nthrough 24 as though fully set forth herein. \n  25.  42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides relief for persons who, under color of state law, have been \ndeprived of any rights, privileges or immunities secured under the U.S. Constitution or Federal law. \n  26.  DRTx, as the P&A system for the state of Texas, has the authority to investigate \nincidences of abuse and neglect of individuals with developmental disabilities if DRTx receives a \ncomplaint or has probable cause to believe that such incidences may have occurred. 42 U.S.C. \n§15043(a)(2)(B); 42 U.S.C. §§ 10805(a)(4)(B)(iii).   \n  27.  In order to carry out investigations into allegations of abuse and neglect, DRTx is \ngranted broad authority to access all records of any individual with a disability as well as other \nrecords relevant to conducting an investigation within three (3) calendar days of a request.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I), (J); 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1).  \n  28.  Based on the media complaints and DRTx’s determination of probable cause to believe \nAPE SUCCESS students may be subject to abuse and/or neglect, DRTx began a full investigation \ninto the use of the calm/blue rooms, by requesting the names and contact information of the parents \nor guardians of students in that particular SUCCESS classroom.  \n  29.  Without  the  requested  records,  DRTx  will  be  unable  to  complete  a  thorough \ninvestigation into the excessive seclusion of the students in APE’s SUCCESS program. \n7 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 8 of 10   PageID 8\n  30.  Defendants failed to make the information available to DRTx.  Defendants’ action \nunder color of law, and refusal to give DRTx access to the requested records, violates the right of \nPlaintiff to meaningful and timely access to records, in violation of the PADD, PAIR and PAIMI \nActs, unless enjoined. \nVI.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  31.  Plaintiff DRTx requests that after notice and hearing, the Court enjoin Defendant from \ndenying DRTx immediate access to the names and contact information of the parents or guardians \nof students in the APE SUCCESS classroom. \n \nVII.  DECLARATORY RELIEF \n  32.  Plaintiff DRTx requests that after notice and hearing, this Court enter a declaratory \njudgment that the Defendant’s policies, regulations, and practices of denying DRTx access to the \nnames and contact information of the parents or guardians of students in the APE SUCCESS \nclassroom, violate the PADD, PAIR, and PAIMI Acts.  42 U.S.C. § 105043 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 10801 et seq. \nVIII.  REQUESTS FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Disability Rights Texas, respectfully requests this Court grant the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  Enter a declaratory judgment that by denying DRTx access to the requested contact \ninformation  of  parents  of  the  students  in  the  SUCCESS  program  and  therefore \npreventing DRTx from fully performing its statutory duty to investigate suspected \nincidents of abuse and neglect, the Defendants’ actions violated the PADD Act, the \nPAIR Act, and the PAIMI Act; \n \nB.  Enter preliminary and thereafter permanent injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C.  § 2202, \nrequiring Defendants to provide DRTx with the requested information—the names of \nstudents in the SUCCESS class at Annette Perry Elementary School for the 2013-2014 \nschool year, as well as those students assigned to that classroom for the 2014-2015 \n8 \n \n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 1   Filed 08/28/14    Page 9 of 10   PageID 9\nschool year, and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of their parents or \nguardians; \n \nC.  Retain  jurisdiction  over  this  action  to  ensure  Defendants’  compliance  with  the \nmandates of the DD Act, PAIR, and PAIMI; \n \nD.  Award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(B); \n \nE.  Order such other and further relief as the Court may deem equitable and just. \n \nDATED: August 28, 2014 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n        s/  Colleen Elbe     \nCOLLEEN ELBE \nState Bar No. 24050154 \nDISABILITY RIGHTS TEXAS \n4747 S.

If all parties involved in your case consent, the presiding district judge may\nenter an order of transfer, and reassign your case to a magistrate judge.\nYour decision to consent, or not to consent, to the reassignment of your case to a magistrate judge\nis entirely voluntary and without any adverse consequences if you choose not to consent. Your\ndecision should be communicated to the clerk of the district court using the form entitled: Consent\nto Proceed Before a United States Magistrate Judge (\"consent form\"). It is preferred that all\nparties submit the consent form jointly, but it may be submitted individually if necessary. A\ndistrict judge or magistrate judge will not be informed of any party's response to this notice unless\nall parties have consented to the referral of the matter to a magistrate judge.\nEven if all parties consent to the exercise of civil jurisdiction by a magistrate judge, the district\njudge may choose not to enter an order reassigning the case to a magistrate judge. However, if the\ndistrict judge does enter an order of transfer, and reassigns your case to the magistrate judge, the\nmagistrate judge is then authorized to conduct any or all proceedings in the case, including a jury\nor non−jury trial, and order the entry of a final judgment. Upon entry of judgment by the\nmagistrate judge in any case referred under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(1), 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(3) provides\nthat \"an aggrieved party may appeal directly to the appropriate United States court of appeals\nfrom the judgment of the magistrate judge in the same manner as an appeal from any other\njudgment of a district court.\"\nIf you wish to consent to proceed before a United States magistrate judge and are a registered\nelectronic filer in the Northern District of Texas, you complete the online form available in the\ncourt's ECF system under Civil Events, Other Filings.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n \n1.  Plaintiff, Disability Rights Texas (“DRTx”), is the designated protection and advocacy \nsystem for the state of Texas.  Under Federal law, DRTx’s mandate is to protect and advocate on \nbehalf of individuals with mental or physical disabilities and to investigate incidents of abuse or \nneglect. See the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (“PADD Act”), 42 \nU.S.C. § 15041 et seq., the Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (“PAIR Act”), 29 \nU.S.C. § 794e et seq., and the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act \n2\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 4 of 56   PageID 35\n(“PAIMI Act”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801-10827.  (These three laws are hereafter collectively referred to \nas the “P&A Acts.”). \n  2.  In accordance with these federal mandates, DRTx has authority to access records, \nincluding the names and contact information of guardians for the purposes of investigating incidents \nof abuse or neglect.  Consistent with DRTx’s federal mandate, DRTx requested access to the names \nand contact information of the guardians of Mansfield Independent School District (“MISD”) \nstudents in the SUCCESS Program at Annette Perry Elementary School (“APE”) during the 2013-\n2014 school year, as well as those scheduled to be in the SUCCESS classroom for the 2014-2015 \nschool year, in order to investigate serious allegations of abuse and neglect of these students. \nDefendants  have  refused  to  provide  DRTx  access  to  these  documents  alleging  that  they  are \nconfidential. \n  3.  By this action, DRTx seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this Court requiring \nthe Defendants to provide the requested information—the names, addresses, and telephone numbers \nof the guardians of students who were in the SUCCESS classroom at APE for the 2013-2014 school \nyear and of the students assigned to the classroom for the 2014-2015 school year—so that DRTx \nmay fulfill its statutory duties and investigate the alleged incidents of abuse and/or neglect.   \n \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n  4.  This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and § 1343(a)(3) since Plaintiff \nDRTx, brings this action under 42 U.S.C.  § 1983 for injunctive and declaratory relief to redress \nDefendants’ violation of the PADD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15041, et seq., the PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e, \net seq., and the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq.   \n3\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 5 of 56   PageID 36\n  5.  This Court has authority to grant Plaintiff’s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n  6.  Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as all of the events \nand omissions included in this complaint occurred on MISD properties serving students from \nTarrant, Ellis and Johnson Counties.  \n   \nIII.  PARTIES \n  7.  Plaintiff, DRTx, is the federally mandated Protection and Advocacy System (“P&A”) \nfor the State of Texas, established pursuant to the PADD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15001 et seq., the PAIR \nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794e, and the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq.  DRTx has been designated by \nthe Governor of Texas as the P&A for the State of Texas. \n  8.  Defendant Mansfield Independent School District is a school district located in Tarrant \nCounty, Texas, and established pursuant to the Constitution of the State of Texas and the Texas \nEducation Code.  MISD is responsible for the operation of all the public schools within its boundaries \nand for implementing the state’s system of public education and ensuring student performance in \naccordance with the Texas Education Code and its implementing regulations.  Defendant MISD can \nbe served with a copy of this complaint by serving the President of the Board of Trustees, Dr. Michael \nEvans, at 605 East Broad Street, Mansfield, Texas 76063. \n  9.  Defendant Dr. Jim Vaszauskas is sued in his official capacity as Superintendent of \nMISD and serves as the educational leader and the chief executive officer of the school district. He \nis  responsible  for  “assuming  administrative  responsibility  and  leadership  for  the  planning, \norganization,  operation,  supervision,  and  evaluation  of  the  education  programs,  services,  and \nfacilities of the district” and is responsible for ensuring the implementation of district policies.  Tex. \n4\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 6 of 56   PageID 37\nEd. Code § 11.201(d)(1); Tex. Ed. Code § 11.1512 (a).  Defendant Vaszauskas can be served with a \ncopy of this complaint at his place of business located at 605 East Broad Street, Mansfield, Texas \n76063. \n  10.   “Defendants”,  as  used  herein,  refers  to  all  Defendants,  its  agents,  employees, \nsuccessors and all persons acting in concert with them or at their direction. \n \nIV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n  11.  Congress enacted the P&A Acts after extensive congressional investigations found \nthat existing state systems for monitoring compliance with respect to the abuse and neglect of persons \nwith disabilities residing in institutions vary widely and are frequently inadequate to protect these \nindividuals.  In order to ensure that the fox was no longer guarding the hen house, Congress mandated \nthat each state have a ‘protection and advocacy system’ designed to have independent access to \ninstitutions and records in order to detect and prevent abuse and neglect.  Because the State of Texas \nreceives federal funds under the P&A Acts, it is required to designate a system that is designed to \nboth protect and advocate the rights of individuals with disabilities, and that also investigates \nincidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 10801, et seq.; \n42 U.S.C. § 15001, et seq.   \n  12.  Annette Perry Elementary is a school within the MISD and is located at 1261 South \nMain Street in Mansfield, Texas.   \n  13.  APE operates a program for students who require specialized social and behavioral \ninstruction, which they call the SUCCESS class.  The SUCCESS Program Guidelines and Overview \nindicate that most students in the SUCCESS program will have a disability of an Emotional \nDisturbance. \n5\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 7 of 56   PageID 38\n  14.  The SUCCESS program utilizes what they call calm rooms or blue rooms (“calm/blue \nrooms”) district wide.  The APE campus SUCCESS program has two of these rooms.  One measures \n80 square feet and the other is 58.5 square feet.   \n  15.  The calm/blue rooms are used when APE staff determine that a student’s behavior \nwarrants removing them from the SUCCESS classroom.  There is no limit to the amount of time a \nstudent is to be placed in the calm/blue room, and after placing a student in the room, APE teachers \nhold the door shut so the students cannot get out, thus turning the calm/blue room into seclusion. \n  16.  SUCCESS guidelines for classroom rules and consequences state that if a student is \nremoved to the calm/blue room two or more times, the student must remain in “isolation for the \nremainder of the day.”  Moreover, “[s]tudents’ [sic] who engage in physical aggression will move to \nthe isolation center for the remainder of the day or the following day depending on when the \naggression occurs.”    \n  17.  On or about April 17, 2014 DRTx obtained information from multiple news sources \nand social media outlets alleging the overuse of these seclusion rooms at Annette Perry Elementary, \nparticularly with students with disabilities.  The media sources raised concerns about the length of \ntime students were being placed in seclusion, whether students were being “transported” to the \ncalm/blue rooms safely and appropriately, and whether guardians of students in the SUCCESS class \nwere appropriately notified about restraints used to transport students to the calm/blue rooms as \nrequired by the Texas Education Code.   \n  18.  The media complaints, along with information obtained through public sources, and \nDRTx’s work on restraint and seclusion issues provided DRTx with reasonable grounds to believe \nthat students with disabilities in APE’s SUCCESS program may be subject to abuse or neglect. Based \non the complaint and DRTx’s determination of probable cause to believe APE SUCCESS students \n6\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 8 of 56   PageID 39\nmaybe being abused and/or neglected, DRTx began a full investigation into the use of the calm/blue \nrooms, as required of the organization under its federal P&A authority. \n  19.  In a letter dated June 5, 2014, DRTx wrote to Dr. Vaszauskas, as Superintendent of \nMISD, informing him that in light of the allegations of abuse and neglect of students in the SUCCESS \nclass, DRTx would be conducting an investigation into the use of calm/blue rooms at APE.  In this \nletter, DRTx requested the names of all students assigned to the SUCCESS classroom for the 2013-\n2014 and upcoming 2014-2015 school years, as well as the names, addresses, and telephone numbers \nof the students’ parents or guardians. DRTx outlined its P&A authority and why the information was \nnecessary to conduct a full investigation.  DRTx noted in the letter that privacy protections in the \nFamily Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) do not prevent MISD from being able to \nprovide the requested information. \n  20.  In a letter dated June 10, 2014, Defendant MISD, responded to DRTx’s request stating \nthat  MISD  would  not  be  releasing  the  requested  information,  because    MISD  “believes  the \ninformation requested is confidential and not subject to release” under FERPA and the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”).   \n  21.  On June 16, 2014, DRTx responded to MISD’s concerns and provided additional \nstatutory authority and case law demonstrating that MISD’s concerns under FERPA and IDEA raised \nwere unfounded.  \n  22.  On June 25, 2014, DRTx received a second letter from MISD stating that MISD would \nnot release the requested information “absent parent consent, subpoena, or a court order.”  \n  23.  Defendants, in refusing to provide DRTx with the information necessary to conduct \nan investigation and authorized to be released to DRTx under its P&A authority, substantially impair, \nlimit, and impede DRTx’s ability to investigate serious allegations of abuse and neglect. As a result \n7\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 9 of 56   PageID 40\nof  Defendants’  refusal,  DRTx  has  been  prevented  from  carrying  out  an  essential  statutory \nresponsibility, investigating incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities, and \ntherefore has suffered harm for which there is no remedy at law.  \n \nV.  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: \nVIOLATION OF THE PADD, PAIR, AND PAIMI ACTS \n \n  24.  DRTx restates and incorporates each and every allegation contained in Paragraphs 1 \nthrough 24 as though fully set forth herein. \n  25.  42 U.S.C. § 1983, provides relief for persons who, under color of state law, have been \ndeprived of any rights, privileges or immunities secured under the U.S. Constitution or Federal law. \n  26.  DRTx, as the P&A system for the state of Texas, has the authority to investigate \nincidences of abuse and neglect of individuals with developmental disabilities if DRTx receives a \ncomplaint or has probable cause to believe that such incidences may have occurred. 42 U.S.C. \n§15043(a)(2)(B); 42 U.S.C. §§ 10805(a)(4)(B)(iii).   \n  27.  In order to carry out investigations into allegations of abuse and neglect, DRTx is \ngranted broad authority to access all records of any individual with a disability as well as other \nrecords relevant to conducting an investigation within three (3) calendar days of a request.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(I), (J); 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1).  \n  28.  Based on the media complaints and DRTx’s determination of probable cause to believe \nAPE SUCCESS students may be subject to abuse and/or neglect, DRTx began a full investigation \ninto the use of the calm/blue rooms, by requesting the names and contact information of the parents \nor guardians of students in that particular SUCCESS classroom.  \n  29.  Without  the  requested  records,  DRTx  will  be  unable  to  complete  a  thorough \ninvestigation into the excessive seclusion of the students in APE’s SUCCESS program. \n8\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 10 of 56   PageID 41\n  30.  Defendants failed to make the information available to DRTx.  Defendants’ action \nunder color of law, and refusal to give DRTx access to the requested records, violates the right of \nPlaintiff to meaningful and timely access to records, in violation of the PADD, PAIR and PAIMI \nActs, unless enjoined. \nVI.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n  31.  Plaintiff DRTx requests that after notice and hearing, the Court enjoin Defendant from \ndenying DRTx immediate access to the names and contact information of the parents or guardians \nof students in the APE SUCCESS classroom. \n \nVII.  DECLARATORY RELIEF \n  32.  Plaintiff DRTx requests that after notice and hearing, this Court enter a declaratory \njudgment that the Defendant’s policies, regulations, and practices of denying DRTx access to the \nnames and contact information of the parents or guardians of students in the APE SUCCESS \nclassroom, violate the PADD, PAIR, and PAIMI Acts.  42 U.S.C. § 105043 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 10801 et seq. \nVIII.  REQUESTS FOR RELIEF \n  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Disability Rights Texas, respectfully requests this Court grant the \nfollowing relief: \nA.  Enter a declaratory judgment that by denying DRTx access to the requested contact \ninformation  of  parents  of  the  students  in  the  SUCCESS  program  and  therefore \npreventing DRTx from fully performing its statutory duty to investigate suspected \nincidents of abuse and neglect, the Defendants’ actions violated the PADD Act, the \nPAIR Act, and the PAIMI Act; \n \nB.  Enter preliminary and thereafter permanent injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C.  § 2202, \nrequiring Defendants to provide DRTx with the requested information—the names of \nstudents in the SUCCESS class at Annette Perry Elementary School for the 2013-2014 \nschool year, as well as those students assigned to that classroom for the 2014-2015 \n9\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 11 of 56   PageID 42\nschool year, and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of their parents or \nguardians; \n \nC.  Retain  jurisdiction  over  this  action  to  ensure  Defendants’  compliance  with  the \nmandates of the DD Act, PAIR, and PAIMI; \n \nD.  Award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(B); \n \nE.

A P&A is an agency established pursuant to the Developmental \nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act.  42 U.S.C. § 15001 et seq. (PADD Act), the Protection \nand Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., and the \nProtection and Advocacy of Individual Rights (PAIR) Program of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § \n794e. (Collectively referred to as the Acts).  Congress, in enacting these Acts, mandated that each state \nreceiving funds under these Acts establish a protection and advocacy (P&A) system to protect the \nrights and interests of persons with disabilities.  DRTx (formerly Advocacy, Inc.) has been designated \nby the Governor of Texas as the P&A system for the State of Texas. \n \nThe Acts provide detailed express authority for P&A systems to gain broad access to records, \nas well as to schools and students with developmental disabilities and mental illness, to investigate \nallegations of abuse and neglect when such incidents are reported to us or when we determine that \nthere is probable cause to suspect that abuse or neglect has occurred.  42 U.S.C. §§ 10805(a)(4), \n15043(a)(2);  Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. No. JC-0461 (2002); State of Conn. Office of Prot. & Advocacy for \nPersons with Disabilities v. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 464 F.3d 229, 238-43 (2d Cir.2006); see also \nAdvocacy, Incorporated v. Tarrant County Hospital District D/B/A John Peter Smith Hospital, 2001 \nWL 1297688, at *3 (N.D. Tex. October 11, 2001).  Courts have uniformly held that the broad statutory \nauthority of the Acts requires that P&A systems be permitted to operate effectively, and with broad \ndiscretion and independence in gaining access to facilities and records.1  Mississippi Protection & \nAdvocacy System v. Cotten, 929 F.2d 1054, 1058-59 (5th Cir. 1991) (“The state cannot satisfy the \n1 See also, Tarwater, 97 F.3d 492 (11th Cir. 1996) (DD Act); Michigan Protection Advocacy Serv., Inc. v.

Additionally, records obtained from the Texas Education \nAgency and Mansfield ISD, reveal a disproportionate amount of students with disabilities are subjected \nto restraint and other harsh disciplinary practices.  Furthermore, data provided by Mansfield ISD \nindicates that out of the 825 district-wide uses of the blue/calm rooms in 2013-2014, over 200 of those \noccurred at Annette Perry Elementary School. This information gives DRTx probable cause to believe \nthat all students in the SUCCESS classroom at Annette Perry Elementary School may be subject to \nabuse2 and/or neglect.3  DRTx plans on conducting an investigation into these concerns and reports.  \nThe case law and regulations implementing the P&A statutes clearly support DRTx’s authority to gain \naccess to: the identities of multiple individuals who may have been, or who may be in the future, \nsubject to abuse and neglect; and to the identities of their guardians, for purposes of obtaining consent \nto access individual records. \n \nIn fact, several recent cases concluded that public schools were required to disclose “the names \nof all Academy students and the contact information for their parents and guardians.” State of Conn. \nOffice of Prot. & Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities, 464 F. 3d 229 at 246.4  It is under these \nauthorities that DRTx is requesting the names of all students in the SUCCESS classroom at Annette \nPerry Elementary School during the 2013-2014 school year and those scheduled to start the 2014-2015 \nschool year in the classroom as well as their parent or guardian’s name, address, and telephone \nnumber.  \n \n2 The federal regulations implementing the PAIMI Act and the PADD Act define abuse as: “the use of excessive force \nwhen placing an individual with mental illness in bodily restrains; the use of bodily or chemical restraints which is not in \ncompliance with Federal and State laws and regulations; verbal, nonverbal, mental and emotional harassment; and any \nother practice which is likely to cause immediate physical or psychological harm or result in long-term harm if such \npractices continue.”  See 42 C.F.R. § 51.2 (PAIMI Act); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.19(PADD Act). \n \n3 The federal regulations implementing the PAIMI Act and the PADD Act define neglect as the failure to “establish or carry \nout an appropriate individual program plan or treatment plan for a individual with mental illness, the failure to provide \nadequate nutrition, clothing, or health care to a individual with mental illness, or the failure to provide a safe environment \nfor a individual with mental illness. . .”  See 42 C.F.R. § 51.2 (PAIMI Act); 45 C.F.R. § 1386.19 (PADD Act). \n \n4 See also See Disability Law Center of Alaska, Inc. v. Anchorage School Dist., 581 F.3d 936, 939, (9th Cir. 2009)(P&A \nwas entitled to the name of every student in the Lake Otis special education class and their guardian contact information \nwhere there were complaints regarding classroom conditions and the treatment of students); State of Conn. Office of Prot. \n& Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities, 464 F.3d at 244-45 (finding that a P&A system was authorized to obtain the \nnames of all students in a therapeutic educational program for students who require special education and the name and \ncontact information for parents and legal guardians of the students); Pa. Prot. & Advocacy, Inc. v. Royer-Greaves Sch. for \nBlind, 1999 WL 179797, at *9-10 (E.D.Pa. Mar. 25, 1999) (finding that a P & A system was authorized to obtain a list of \nthe names and addresses of the guardians of the students at a residential school for children with developmental disabilities \nand blindness where the P & A system had received complaints of “systemic neglect” at the school); see also Iowa Prot. & \nAdvocacy Servs., Inc. v. Gerard Treatment Programs, L.L.C., 152 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1171-72 (N.D.Ia.2001) (suggesting \nthat probable cause to believe that widespread abuse is occurring justifies generalized access to records). \n14\n\nCase 4:14-cv-00715-A   Document 3   Filed 08/28/14    Page 16 of 56   PageID 47\nSince DRTx is only requesting contact information FERPA’s privacy provisions should not be \na barrier.  However, in the event that you believe that FERPA’s privacy provisions prevent the district \nfrom providing the requested information, you should note that the same courts that required the \nrelease of all student names and guardian contact information for students in special education also \naddressed whether the potential conflict between FERPA and IDEA, on one hand, and the DD Act and \nPAIMI  on  the  other,  and  concluded  that,  “given  the  unequivocal  statutory  mandate  afforded  to \nprotection and advocacy systems to access records in specific situations and the statutory responsibility \nof such organizations to keep such records confidential, FERPA and IDEA did not prevent educational \ninstitutions and agencies from providing such systems with records.”  See State of Conn. Office of \nProt. & Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Hartford Bd. of Educ, 355 F. Supp. 2d 649, 663 \n(D.Conn. 2005); see also Disability Law Center of Alaska, Inc. 581 F.3d at 940; Michigan Protection \nand Advocacy Service v. Miller, 849 F. Supp. 1202, 1208 (W.D.Mich.1994).   \n \nThe PADD Act specifies that records/contact information must be provided not later than three \n(3) business days after DRTx makes a written request. 42 U.S.C. § 15043(a)(2)(J). Therefore, I will \nanticipate your response within three (3) business days of receipt of this request. If you have any \nquestions about this request, please contact me.
