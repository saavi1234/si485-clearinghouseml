    "summary": "<p>In this case, Disability Rights Texas, the state's protection and advocacy system, brought a claim for injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of the organization as a plaintiff using associational standing, and on behalf of four named plaintiffs representing a class of people with mental health disabilities who had been referred for competency evaluation following arrest on criminal charges and subject to excessive delays in this process.</p>\r\n<p>On July 29, 2016, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, plaintiffs filed this claim for injunctive and declaratory relief for due process violations under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution (using 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983) for delays in transferring the plaintiff class from jail to a mental health facility for evaluation and restoration to competency. As a result of these delays, plaintiffs were subjected to lengthy (months-long) stays in Harris County jail while awaiting transfer. This case was brought against the Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. Judge Lee Yeakel was assigned to the matter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following an initial motion to dismiss by the defendant on August 29, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 12, 2016 and the court dismissed the motion to dismiss that day. In the following months defendants filed amended motions to dismiss, and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on November 23, 2016 to include new plaintiff members as earlier named plaintiffs were mooted out. The second motion to dismiss was again unsuccessful, and plaintiffs filed for class certification on November 28, 2016. Motions continued thereafter, with the defendant objecting to class certification, amended motions to dismiss and replies filed, and the judge set a hearing on the motion to dismiss for March 7, 2017. In the intervening time period the judge referred the parties to ADR, and set a timetable for pre-trial proceedings. The defendant&rsquo;s second amended motion to dismiss was dismissed by the court on April 26, 2017. On August 17, 2017 the parties filed a report stating the ADR was premature, as the issue of class certification had not been resolved. On September 1, 2017, the judge certified two classes: one including individuals charged with Texas crimes but adjudged to be incompetent to stand trial under Texas law; and the other including individuals acquitted of Texas crimes because they were determined to be insane under Texas law.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal against the decision to certify the plaintiff classes . The delays caused by this appeal created problems in continuing with discovery and naming plaintiffs, as earlier affected individuals had been moved out of the facility, and plaintiffs moved for the court to appoint named representatives to prevent mootness given the inherently transitory nature of the plaintiff class. The court declined to do so and instead stayed proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal on November 7 2017.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 16, 2018, the Fifth Circuit vacated the class certification and remanded it back to the District Court, finding that the purported class was of the inherently transitory nature that evades mootness, but that the District Court had not sufficiently found commonality, typicality and numerosity amongst the two classes. 753 Fed. App'x 236.</p>\r\n<p>Following the case&rsquo;s remand, it took several more years of litigation in order to certify a class, which occurred finally after a hearing on March 29, 2022. The class certified was a single class consisting of: &ldquo;All persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a crime in the State of Texas, (b) ordered by a Texas court to a Texas Department of State Health Services facility where they are to receive competency-restoration services; but (c) because the Texas Department of State Services maintains insufficient forensic capacity, (d) remain detained in a Texas county jail more than 21 days from the day the Texas Department of State Health Services receives the court order to the day the Texas Department of Health Services makes a bed available in a Texas Department of Health Services mental health facility&rdquo; and appointing named class representatives. The final amended complaint with proper defendant and named representatives was filed on October 17, 2022. This complaint did not include Disability Rights Texas as a plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2023 parties filed a joint motion for release from ADR, as engaging in ADR by the Texas Attorney General requires assent by the Texas Legislature, which was not given. This was so ordered on October 30, 2023.&nbsp; The case is ongoing.<br />&nbsp;</p>",

When an individual charged with a crime is found to be incompetent to stand trial, \nTexas law requires that the Texas Department of State Health Services (โthe Departmentโ or \nโDSHSโ) provide the incompetent detainee with treatment aimed at restoring the individual to \ncompetency.  Texas law further requires that this specialized competency-restoration treatment \nmust be provided by the Department, and the treatment can only be provided in a state mental \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 2 of 20\nhealth facility or, under certain circumstances and with proper supervision, in a community-based \noutpatient program overseen by the Department.1 \n2.  Because  the  Department  routinely  fails  or  refuses  to  provide  competency-\nrestoration treatment within a reasonable period of time from the date of the state criminal-court \norder requiring such treatment, individuals adjudged incompetent are placed on a waiting list until \na bed at a Department mental health facility becomes available.  It is not uncommon for these \nindividuals, after the issuance of the order committing them to treatment, to wait in jail for weeks \nor even months until the Department accepts custody.  Often, these incompetent detaineesโ\ndespite being presumed innocentโend up being confined in jail prior to adjudication and pending \ntreatment longer than if they had been found guilty of the alleged crime. \n3.  This situation is not new.  The Department created its waiting list for individuals \nfound incompetent to stand trial and ordered to a Department mental health facility in 2006.  Since \n2006, the number of criminal defendants found incompetent and ordered for restoration treatment \nhas only increased. \n4.  As a result of the delays caused by the Department, individuals with mental illness \nlanguish in county jails without appropriate mental health treatment until a bed becomes available \nat a Department mental health facility.  Because jails are not designed or administered to provide \ncompetency-restoration treatment or for the psychiatric needs of individuals with mental illness, \nPlaintiffs receive little or no meaningful competency-restoration treatment while they wait for a \nbed at a Department facility.  As such, individuals with mental illness suffer needless deterioration \n                                                           \n1 In 2013, the Texas Legislature appropriated money for two pilot jail-based competency restoration programs.  See \nActs 2013, 83rd Leg., ch. 797 (S.B. 1475), ยง 2, eff. Sept. 1, 2013.  As of the date of this filing, no jail-based \ncompetency-restoration program has been established.  Even if such a program is established, the Department will \nstill fund and operate the program. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 3 of 20\nof their mental health as they wait in jails, frequently in prolonged isolation, for weeks and months \nbefore they receive the competency-restoration services Defendant is responsible for providing. \n5.  The delays caused by the Department violate the due process rights of these \nincompetent detainees as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendant has a duty to \naccept and treat mentally incompetent detainees within a reasonable period of time, which must \nbe measured in days, not weeks or months.  Defendantโs failure to provide timely restoration \ntreatment, however, forces Plaintiffs and members of the Class they represent to wait weeks and \nmonths in county jails for court-ordered competency restoration services that Defendant and his \nDepartment are statutorily required to provide.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration of their \nrights and an order enjoining Defendant from violating their rights.       \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This civil action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of law of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction \nover this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (civil rights). \n7.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).  \nPARTIES \n8.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Harris County to transfer Mr. Ward to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he continues to be confined in the Harris County Jail.  Mr. Ward \ndoes not receive competency-restoration treatment in Jail and has been waiting to be transferred \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 4 of 20\nto a state mental health facility for competency treatment for over twenty-two weeks.  Plaintiff \nJoseph Wardโs current mental state limits his ability to protect his legal interests.  As such, a next \nfriend is necessary to represent his interests.

On or about March 30, 2016, Mr. Lemelle was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lemelle to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Lemelle to a state mental health \nfacility, and, as a result, he continues to be confined in the Travis County Jail. Mr. Lemelle does \nnot receive competency-restoration treatment in Jail and has been waiting to be transferred to a \nstate mental health facility for competency treatment for approximately 21 weeks.  Plaintiff \nLemelleโs current mental state limits his ability to protect his legal interests.  As such, a next friend \nis necessary to represent his interests.  Plaintiff Lemelleโs defense attorney, Mark Westenhover, \nhas volunteered and agreed to serve as Plaintiff Lemelleโs next friend. \n10.

On or about April 18, 2016, Mr. Anderson was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Anderson to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he continues to be confined in the Travis County Jail. Mr. Anderson \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 5 of 20\ndoes not receive competency-restoration treatment in Jail and has been waiting to be transferred \nto a state mental health facility for competency treatment for approximately 13 weeks.

DRTX has the authority under federal law to pursue \nlegal,  administrative,  and  other  appropriate  remedies  on  behalf  of  Texans  with  disabilities, \nincluding those with mental illness, to redress violations of their rights, including advocacy to \nimplement changes in the policies, procedures, and practices of systems that impact persons with \nmental illness.  42 U.S.C. ยง 10805(a)(1)(B).  DRTX brings this action for declaratory and \nprospective injunctive relief to require Defendant to change his agencyโs policies, procedures, and \npractices to ensure that all persons who have been found incompetent to stand trial receive the \nprompt competency-restoration treatment to which they are entitled by law.  \n12.  DRTXโs  governing  board  (โBoardโ),  in  accordance  with  42 U.S.C.  ยง \n0805(c)(1)(B); 42 U.S.C. ยง 15044(a); see also 42 C.F.R. ยง 51.22(b)(2), is composed of members \nwho broadly represent, or are knowledgeable about, the needs of the clients with disabilities served \nby  the  P&A  system.    DRTXโs  Board  includes  nine  (9)  individuals  who  are  persons  with \ndisabilities, six (6) individuals who are family members of persons with disabilities, and one (1) \nperson who is a provider of disability-related services.  The DRTX Board is responsible for \nplanning, designing, and implementing activities necessary to carry out DRTXโs federal mandate. \n42 U.S.C. ยง 10805(2)(A) & (B).  Additionally, DRTX has an Advisory Council; sixty-six percent \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 6 of 20\nof the Advisory Councilโs members either have a mental illness or are family members of persons \nwith a mental illness.  DRTXโs Board and Advisory Council establish DRTXโs priorities for \nrepresentation, and oversee and influence the activities that DRTX undertakes in order to meet the \nrequirements of its federal authorizing legislation.  42 U.S.C. ยง 10805(a)(6)(B).  \n13.  DRTX also provides an opportunity for persons with disabilities to comment on its \npriorities and activities, and has a grievance procedure for clients to โassure that individuals with \nmental illness have full access to the services of the system.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 10805(a)(8) and (9); 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 15044(a).  As such, DRTX represents persons with mental illness and provides them the \nmeans by which they can protect their collective interests. \n14.  Further, DRTX has expended and continues to expend resources advocating on \nbehalf of individuals found incompetent to stand trial, but who have been denied competency-\nrestoration treatment, by representing individual clients and by advocating at the State and local \nlevel for alternatives to hospital-based competency-restoration treatment.  Through this work, \nDRTX has received complaints from hundreds of detainees in the Texas county jails who have \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial and have waited for weeks or months to be transferred to a \nstate  hospital  for  competency-restoration  treatment.    Each  of  these  clients  and  individuals, \nincluding the Plaintiffs, is a member of DRTX and has suffered, or is continuing to suffer, an injury \nthat would allow him or her to bring suit in his or her own right. \n15.  The interests DRTX seeks to protect are germane to its purpose of advocating for \nand protecting the legal rights of all Texans with disabilities.  Neither the claims asserted nor the \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief requested requires the participation of the individual members in \nthis suit.  The benefits of the relief sought will necessarily inure to DRTXโs members who are in \nneed of competency-restoration treatment. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 7 of 20\n16.  Defendant Dr. John Hellerstedt is currently the duly appointed Commissioner of \nthe Texas Department of State Health Services and has been delegated the administration of that \nagency.  As Commissioner, Defendant Hellerstedt is ultimately responsible for ensuring that \nDSHS is in full compliance with federal and state law, as well as agency rules, regulations, and \npolicies.   Defendant  Hellerstedt is  responsible  for  โadministering human services programs \nregarding mental health, including: administering and coordinating mental health services at the \nlocal and state level; operating the stateโs mental health facilities,โ and โdesignat[ing] the state \nhospitals to which persons with mental illness from each district shall be admitted.โ  TEX. HEALTH \n& SAFETY CODE ANN. ยง 1001.072 and ยง552.001.  Defendant Hellerstedt is sued in his official \ncapacity and may be served with process at the Department of State Health Services, 1100 West \n49th Street, Austin, Texas 78756. \nCLASS ACTION ALLLEGATIONS \n17.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated as \nmembers of the following proposed plaintiff class: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the State \nof Texas, and: (a) who are ordered to receive competency restoration services at a  \nTexas DSHS facility; (b) who are waiting in jail for those services; and (c) for \nwhom DSHS receives the court order. \n \n18.  Plaintiffs  seek  class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2). \n19.  While the precise number of Class Members is not known to Plaintiffs with \ncertainty because the number necessarily fluctuates, on information and belief, Plaintiffs estimate \nthat there are approximately 280 individuals at present.  An exact number of current Class members \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 8 of 20\nis known to Defendant and can be determined through discovery; as for potential future Class \nMembers, that number is indeterminable. \n20.  The Class Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class \nbecause  the  individual  Plaintiffs  have  all  been  adjudicated,  or  will  be  adjudicated,  to  be \nincompetent to stand trial and are, or will be, confined in jail while waiting for competency-\nrestoration treatment at a Department mental health facility.  Plaintiffs and all members of the \nClass have similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising from Defendantโs \nactions and inaction. \n21.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether Defendant has failed to provide  competency-restoration treatment to \nPlaintiffs and other Class Members in a timely manner; \n \nWhether Defendantโs failure to admit individuals with mental illness to the DSHSโs \nmental health facilities for competency restoration purposes in a reasonably timely \nmanner violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n22.  Class Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the \nClass.  There are no conflicts of interest between the Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the \nClass.  The Class members will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the Class.  The Class \nPlaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill and experience in civil \nrights and mental health litigation, who will vigorously prosecute this case on behalf of the Class. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 9 of 20\n23.  Defendant has acted or failed or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to \nthe entire Class. \n24.  The claims asserted herein are capable of repetition while evading review.  There \nis a continuing and substantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in favor of Plaintiffs and the Class. \n25.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the \nFederal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  because  Plaintiffs  and  other  members  of  the  Class  seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and all of the necessary factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present. \n26.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause  individual  litigation  of  these  claims  would  be  impracticable  and  would  be  unduly \nburdensome to the courts.  Further, this suit may be maintained as a class action because common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and \nindividual litigation would increase the likelihood of inconsistent or contradictory judgments.  A \nclass  action  presents  fewer  management  difficulties  and  provides  the  benefits  of  a  single \nadjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n27.  Defendant and his Department, through their actions and inaction, knowingly cause \nincompetent  detainees  to  be  incarcerated  for  weeks  or  months  without  providing  them  the \ntreatment needed to restore their competency. \nA.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit mentally incompetent detainees to a DSHS facility \nfor competency restoration services \n \n28.  Under state and federal law, individuals who lack the ability to understand the \nnature of the criminal court proceedings against them may not be tried. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 10 of 20\n29.  Article 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when a criminal defendantโs mental competency is challenged during \ncriminal proceedings.  \n30.  A person is incompetent to stand trial if he or she does not have โsufficient present \nability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,โ or \nโa rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.โ  TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. ANN. arts. 46B.003(a)(1)&(2).   \n31.  โEither party may suggest by motion, or the trial court may suggest on its own \nmotion, that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(a).  โIf the court \ndetermines that there is evidence to support a finding of incompetence, the court . . . shall stay all \nother proceedings in the case.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(d).  โIf the defendant is found incompetent to \nstand trial, the court shall proceed under Subchapter D.โ  Id. \n32.  Pursuant to Subchapter D, aricle 46B.071, the court, on a determination that a \ncriminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial, shall either commit the defendant to a mental \nhealth facility designated by the Department of State Health Services under 46B.073, or release \nthe defendant on bail subject to conditions under 46B.072.  Id., art. 46B.071. \n33.  For a defendant not released on bail, โ[t]he court shall commit a defendant . . . to a \nmental health facility or residential care facility for a period not to exceed 60 days (misdemeanor) \nor 120 days (felony) for further examination and treatment toward the specific objective of \nattaining competency to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.073(b) (emphasis added). \n34.  If a defendant is charged with a โviolent offense,โ as listed in article 17.032(a), \nother than an assault, or the indictment alleges an affirmative finding that a deadly weapon was \nused during the commission of a felony, โthe court shall enter an order committing the defendant \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 11 of 20\nto the maximum security unit [MSU] of any facility designated by the department . . ..โ  Id., art. \n46B.073(c).  If the defendant is not charged with one of the enumerated offenses, โthe court shall \nenter an order committing the defendant to a mental health facility or residential care facility . . ..โ  \nId., art. 46B.073(d). \n35.  An order committing the defendant for restoration of competency โmust place the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to \nreceive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.โ  Id., art. 46B.075. \n36.  Not later than the date of the order of commitment, the court must send a copy of \nthe order to the facility to which the defendant is committed.  Id., art. 46B.076(a). \n37.  The facility to which the defendant is committed must: develop an individual \nprogram of treatment; assess and evaluate whether the defendant will obtain competency in the \nforeseeable future; and report to the court and local mental health or mental retardation authority \non defendantโs progress toward achieving competency.  Id., art. 46B.077(a).   \n38.  Not later than the 15th day before the date on which the restoration period is to \nexpire, the head of the facility must so notify the court that the restoration period is about to expire.  \nId., art. 46B.079(a).  Further, the head of the facility must also โpromptlyโ notify the court when \nthe defendant has obtained competency to stand trial or upon a determination that the defendant \nwill not attain competency in the foreseeable future.  Id., art. 46B.079(b).   \n39.  On the return of the defendant to the court, the court must make a determination as \nto the defendantโs competency to stand trial.  The court must make this determination not later \nthan the 20th day after the court received the notice from the head of the facility required by article \n46B.079. Id., art. 46B.084(a).  If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, criminal \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 12 of 20\nproceedings may be resumed; if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the court may \ndetermine whether the defendant should be subject to civil commitment. \nB.  County jails are unable to provide competency-restoration services to individuals \nfound incompetent to stand trial \n \n40.  County jails in Texas are inappropriate settings for the care and treatment of \nindividuals with mental illness or intellectual disabilities (formerly called โmental retardationโ).  \nJails are not designed to be therapeuticโthey are inherently punitive, and as such are not \nappropriate settings in which to provide treatment aimed at restoring a person to competency. \n41.  Correctional facilities, particularly facilities designed for short-term detention, do \nnot have the staffing, funding, or capabilities to provide proper care and treatment for individuals \nwith significant mental health needs. \n42.  Detainees who are found incompetent to stand trial are often the most severely \nmentally ill in Texas jail settings. \n43.  Most  Texas  jails  do  not  have  the  ability  to  provide  even  basic  psychiatric \nstabilization and management.  As a result, many detainees with serious mental illness are harmed \nby the lack of adequate treatment as manifested by either increased symptoms of their underlying \npsychiatric disorder or lack of improvement regarding their current symptoms.  By refusing to \ntimely take custody of incompetent detainees, Defendant and his Department cause such persons \nto be confined in county jails under conditions nearly certain to exacerbate their mental illness. \n44.  Because county jails are often unable to provide even basic mental health treatment, \nincompetent detainees frequently end up between a rock and a hard place: either they are housed \nin the general jail populationโoften with convicted offendersโor they are placed in solitary \nconfinement, which causes their mental health to further deteriorate.  This deterioration conflicts \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 13 of 20\nwith the Stateโs interest in prompt evaluation and treatment so that such persons may be brought \nto trial.  \n45.  Besides struggling to provide even basic mental health care, county jails in Texas \ndo not have the specific services necessary to restore individuals to competency to stand trial, such \nas the most current medications, identification of specific social needs to restore and maintain \ncompetency, and training specific to the restoration of competency.  In contrast, state mental health \nfacilities are specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment to restore incompetent detainees \nto competence, thereby enabling them to stand trial. \n46.  Nevertheless,  Defendant  knowingly,  intentionally,  and  deliberately  refuses  to \naccept individuals found incompetent to stand trial into state mental health facilities, in violation \nof the requirements of Chapter 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the orders of the \ncriminal courts, and the U.S. Constitution.        \nC.  Defendant and his agency have failed to provide individuals found incompetent to \nstand trial and ordered to a Department mental health facility with competency \nrestoration services in a timely manner  \n \n47.  According to a 2014 Joint Report by the National Sheriffโs Association and the \nTreatment Advocacy Center, โTexas is among the states with the lowest number of public \npsychiatric beds and among the stingiest states in per capita mental health spending.โ  \n48.  In June of 2014, the number of incompetent detainees waiting to be transferred to \na state mental health facility was about 170; by February of 2016, the number had risen to more \nthan 380.  By February 2016, incompetent detainees were waiting an average of 41 days in local \njails.  As of April 1, 2016, the longest wait time for a non-maximum security bed was 275 daysโ\nalmost nine months.  According to the Department, as of April 1, 2016, the average wait time for \na maximum security bed was 122 days.  Currently, about 283 individuals are waiting in county \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 14 of 20\njails for a maximum security bed, and of those individuals, about 246 have been waiting longer \nthan 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting in jail for a maximum security bed the longest \nhas been waiting about 321 days.  As for the wait list for a non-maximum security bed, there are \ncurrently about 96 individuals waiting in jail for such a bed, and of those 96, about 4 have been \nwaiting longer than 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting in jail the longest for a non-\nmaximum security bed has been waiting 34 days.   \n49.  According to a May 13, 2016 investigative report by ABC-13, state statistics going \nback to 2006 show that the number of incompetent detainees waiting in jails for competency-\nrestoration treatment โhas never been this long,โ and that the number of individuals on the wait \nlist has grown by โ20% in the last six months.โ   \n50.  The delay in receiving competency-restoration treatment necessarily extends the \ntime within which an individual can be tried once restored to competency.  \n51.  Because incompetent criminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime, \nthey have an interest in freedom from incarceration, and a liberty interest in receiving restorative \ntreatment.  Because such incompetent detainees must be provided with restorative treatment, lack \nof funds, staff, or facilities cannot justify the Defendantโs failure to provide the treatment. \n52.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, the individual Plaintiffs and the \nClass will continue to be deprived of their liberty rights without due process of law, in violation \nof their constitutional rights. \n53.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt of Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 15 of 20\ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Harris County to transfer Mr. Ward to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he continues to be confined in the Harris County Jail.  Mr. Ward \ndoes not receive competency-restoration treatment in Jail and has been waiting to be transferred \nto a state mental health facility for competency treatment for over 22 weeks. \n54.  Mr. Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, HIV, epilepsy, asthma, \nand hypertension.  Harris County Jail staff note that Mr. Ward has a history of neurocognitive \nimpairment.  In February 2016, during a mental health assessment, staff noted Mr. Wardโs \nconfusion and inability to remember information such as street names, location, and names of \ndoctors.  Staff noted that โcompetency restoration may be unlikely or slow based on current clinical \npresentation of the assessment.โ    \n55.  Mr. Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he has \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial.  During this recent incarceration, Mr. Ward requested, and \ncurrently  voluntarily  takes,  his  psychotropic  medications;  however,  he  continues  to  report \ncommand auditory hallucinations as recently as May of 2016. \n56.  Plaintiff Isaac Lemelle is a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about March 30, 2016, Mr. Lemelle was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lemelle to the state mental health facility.   Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Lemelle to a state \nmental health facility, and, as a result, he continues to be confined in the Travis County Jail.  Mr. \nLemelle does not receive competency-restoration treatment in Jail. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 16 of 20\n57.  Mr. Lemelle is diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia and other psychotic \ndisorders and antisocial personality disorder. The Travis County Jail has classified his mental \nhealth needs as severe. He has a long history of mental illness, and was first treated by the Austin \nTravis County Mental Health Authority in 2008, at age thirteen.  \n58.  During his current incarceration, Mr. Lemelle has exhibited numerous symptoms \nand behaviors as a result of his mental illness, including throwing urine and smearing feces, \nbehaviors which have required his placement in the Jailโs psychiatric lockdown units in a single \ncell.  Individuals in psychiatric lockdown are permitted outside of their cell in the dayroom for one \nhour a day.  They are not guaranteed any time outdoors.  Jail personnel are required to conduct \nvisual checks every 30 minutes.  Mr. Lemelle has also required protective restraints.  \n59.  On  February  23,  2016,  while  Mr.  Lemelle  was  in  jail  waiting  to  be  found \nincompetent to stand trial, officers were notified that Mr. Lemelle stated he wanted to kill himself \nand may have swallowed a razor.  While attempting to place Mr. Lemelle in a restraint chair to \nexamine his mouth for a razor, and to transport him to an isolation cell, Mr. Lemelle spit at a \ncorrections officer.   This incident led to the additional charge of harassment of a public servant \nbeing pressed against Mr. Lemelle.  Following this incident, Mr. Lemelle was transported to a Full \nSuicide Precautions (โFSPโ) unit, where he was placed in a rubber cell and provided only a smock \nas clothing.  In FSP units, Jail staff are required to conduct 15 minute visual checks.  Medical and \npsychiatric evaluations and meetings are conducted through a food chute, i.e., a small opening on \nthe door of each individual cell that is used to pass food to the individuals.  Mr.  Lemelle has also \nbeen accused of approximately fifteen (15) rule violations (on four separate occasions) that \nrequired review by the Travis County Sheriffโs Office disciplinary board. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 17 of 20\n60.  Plaintiff Michael Anderson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 299th Judicial \nDistrict Court, Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 18, 2016, Mr. Anderson was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to the state mental health facility.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Anderson to a state \nmental health facility and, as a result, he continues to be confined in the Travis County Jail.  Mr. \nAnderson receives no competency-restoration treatment in Jail.  \n61.  Mr. Anderson has been diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder, an intellectual \ndisability, schizoaffective disorder, and diabetes.  He has a long history of mental illness and has \nbeen treated by the Austin Travis County Mental Health Authority since 1993.  \n62.  While incarcerated, Mr. Anderson has exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related \nto his mental illness.  Records by the Jail counselor indicate that Mr. Anderson has exhibited \nincoherent thought processes and delusional content and thought processes.  As recently as June \n2016, records show that Mr. Anderson urinates on himself and in his cell.  Following this incident, \nMr. Anderson was placed in a single cell, where Jail staff are required to conduct visual checks \nevery 30 minutes.  \nCAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \n63.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 62 above are incorporated \nherein. \n64.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 18 of 20\n65.  Criminal defendants who have not been convicted and have been adjudicated \nincompetent to stand trial have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and in receiving \ncompetency-restoration treatment. \n66.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n67.  Once an individual is found unable to aid and assist in his or her own defense, the \nonly lawful purpose for confinement is to provide treatment so as to return him or her to \ncompetency. \n68.  County jails do not have the resources or expertise to provide the restorative \ntreatment required by the U.S. Constitution. \n69.  No legitimate state interest justifies the confinement of mentally incompetent \ncriminal  defendants  in  county  jails  for  months  on  end.    The  nature  and  duration  of  their \nincarceration bear no reasonable relation to the restorative purpose for which the court has \ncommitted those individuals to treatment. \n70.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class are entitled to an order of \nthe Court declaring that, by requiring mentally incompetent defendants to remain in county jails \nfor protracted periods, and by failing to provide restorative treatment in a reasonable timely \nmanner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process rights of the Plaintiffs \nand the other Class members. \n71.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members.  The Plaintiffs and the other Class members \nare therefore entitled to an order of the Court enjoining Defendant from further violations of the \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 1   Filed 07/29/16   Page 19 of 20\nPlaintiffsโ  rights  to  due  process  in  relation  to  their  continued  confinement  while  awaiting \nrestorative treatment at a DSHS mental health facility.   \nATTORNEYโS FEES \n72.  Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneyโs fees, costs, and expenses pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE: Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to: \nA.  Certify the Class, as defined above; \nB.  Enter an Order declaring that, by requiring defendants found incompetent to stand \ntrial to remain in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to provide \nrestorative  treatment  in  a  reasonably  timely  manner,  Defendant  is  depriving \nPlaintiffs and Class Members of their due process rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution; \nC.

The Court, after reviewing the motion and pleadings on file, and being \notherwise fully advised, is of the opinion that the Plaintiffsโ motion is meritorious and should be \ngranted. \nAs the Court noted in its March 29, 2022 Order on Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification \n(ECF No. 137),  \nRule  23(a)(4)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  requires  that  โthe \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.โ \nThe rule โmandates an inquiry into the zeal and competence of the representativeโs \ncounsel and into the willingness and ability of the representative to take an active \nrole in and control the litigation and to protect the interests of absentees.โ Horton \nv.

When an individual charged with a crime is found to be incompetent to stand trial, \nTexas law requires that the Texas Department of State Health Services (โthe Departmentโ or \nโDSHSโ) provide the incompetent detainee with treatment aimed at restoring the individual to \ncompetency.  Texas law further requires that this specialized competency restoration treatment \nmust be provided by the Department, and the treatment can only be provided in a state mental \nhealth facility or, under certain circumstances and with proper supervision, in a community-based \noutpatient program overseen by the Department.1 \n2.  When an individual charged with a crime is found not guilty by reason of insanity, \nand the court determines that the offense of which the person was acquitted involved dangerous \nconduct, Texas law requires that the court commit the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by \nthe Department for evaluation of the personโs present mental condition and for treatment.  These \nservices can only be provided by the Department.  Texas law states that the insanity acquittee \ncannot remain in jail awaiting transfer to a facility designated by the Department for a period \nlonger than 14 days. \n3.  Because the Departmentโs facilities are full, the Department refuses to accept \ncustody of those ordered to its care and instead places persons found incompetent to stand trial and \npersons found not guilty by reason of insanity on a waiting list until a bed at a Department mental \nhealth facility becomes available.  It is not uncommon for these individuals, after the issuance of \nthe order committing them to the Departmentโs facilities, to wait in jail for months until the \nDepartment accepts custody.   \n                                                           \n1 In 2013, the Texas Legislature appropriated money for two pilot jail-based competency restoration programs.  See \nActs 2013, 83rd Leg., ch. 797 (S.B. 1475), ยง 2, eff. Sept. 1, 2013.  As of the date of this filing, no jail-based \ncompetency-restoration program has been established.  Even if such a program is established, the Department will \nstill fund and operate the program. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 3 of 31\n4.  Often, incompetent detaineesโdespite being presumed innocentโend up being \nincarcerated in jail prior to adjudication and pending treatment longer than if they had been found \nguilty of the alleged crime.  In addition, insanity acquitteesโdespite being acquittedโalso end up \nbeing  incarcerated  in  jail  for  months  after  an  adjudication  that  absolves  their  criminal \nresponsibility. \n5.  This situation is not new.  The Department created its waiting list for individuals \nfound incompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to a \nDepartment mental health facility in 2006.  Since 2006, the number of criminal defendants found \nincompetent or not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to a Department facility for evaluation \nand/or treatment has only increased. \n6.  As a result of the delays caused by the Department, incompetent detainees and \ninsanity acquittees languish in county jails absent a criminal conviction until a bed becomes \navailable at a Department mental health facility.  Additionally, Texas jails are not designed or \nadministered to provide either competency restoration treatment for incompetent detainees or \nevaluation and/or treatment services for the psychiatric needs of insanity acquittees, leaving \nPlaintiffs with no meaningful competency restoration or evaluation and treatment while they wait \nfor a bed at a Department facility.  As such, incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees suffer \nneedless deterioration of their mental health as they wait in jails, frequently in prolonged isolation, \nfor weeks and months before they receive the services Defendant is responsible for providing. \n7.  The delays caused by the Department violate the due process rights of incompetent \ndetainees and insanity acquittees as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendant has a \nduty to accept and treat detainees within a reasonable period of time, which must be measured in \ndays, not weeks or months.  For insanity acquittees, Texas law specifically mandates that such \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 4 of 31\npersons not remain in jail in excess of 14 days.  Defendantโs failure to timely accept transfer of \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees to its facilities and to provide timely restoration and \nevaluative treatment, however, forces Plaintiffs and members of the Classes they represent to \nremain incarcerated for weeks and months in county jails absent criminal convictions and without \nany of the  court-ordered competency restoration treatment or evaluation and/or treatment services \nthat Defendant and his Department are statutorily required to provide.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek \na declaration of their rights and an order enjoining Defendant from violating their rights.       \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This civil action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of law of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.

Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated as \nmembers of the following proposed plaintiff classes: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the State \nof Texas, and: (a) who are ordered to a Texas DSHS facility where they are to \nreceive competency restoration services; and (b) for whom DSHS receives the court \norder; but (c) who remain incarcerated an unconstitutional permissible length of \ntime waiting to be accepted at a Texas DSHS facility. \n \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the State \nof Texas and who are found not guilty by reason of insanity, and: (a) who are \nordered to receive evaluation and/or treatment services at a DSHS facility; (b) who \nare incarcerated and are waiting for those services for more than 14 days; and (c) \nfor whom DSHS receives the court order. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 9 of 31\n19.  Plaintiffs  seek  class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2). \n20.  While the precise number of Class Members in each class is not known to Plaintiffs \nwith certainty because the number necessarily fluctuates, on information and belief, Plaintiffs \nestimate that there are approximately 346 individuals at present who, although ordered to a \nDepartment mental health facility to receive competency restoration services or evaluation and \ntreatment  services,  remain  incarcerated  in  jail  for  months  waiting  for  transportation  to  a \nDepartment mental health facility.  An exact number of current Class members in each class is \nknown to the Department and can be determined through discovery; as for potential future Class \nMembers, that number is indeterminable. \n21.  As for the class of individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial, the \nPlaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class because the individual \nPlaintiffs and the Class have all been adjudicated, or will be adjudicated, to be incompetent to \nstand trial and are, or will be, incarcerated in jail while waiting for a bed at a Department mental \nhealth facility to receive the statutorily required competency restoration treatment.  Plaintiffs and \nall members of the Class have similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising \nfrom Defendantโs actions and inaction. \n22.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether the Department has failed to accept the ordered transfer of Plaintiffs and \nother Class Members to its facilities for competency-restoration treatment in a \ntimely manner; \n \nWhether Defendantโs failure to admit individuals determined incompetent to stand \ntrial and ordered to the DSHSโs mental health facilities for competency restoration \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 10 of 31\npurposes in a reasonably timely manner violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n23.  As for the class for individuals who have been found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity, the Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class because the \nindividual Plaintiffs and the Class have all been, or will be, found not guilty by reason of insanity \nand are, or will be, incarcerated in jail while waiting for a bed at a Department mental health \nfacility to receive the statutorily required evaluation and/or treatment services.  Plaintiffs and all \nmembers of the Class have similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising from \nDefendantโs actions and inaction. \n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether the Department has failed to accept transfer of individual Plaintiffs and \nother class members who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity for \nevaluation and/or treatment services in a timely manner; \n \nWhether the Departmentโs failure to admit individuals who have been found not \nguilty by reason of insanity and ordered by the criminal court to its mental health \nfacility for evaluation and/or treatment services in a reasonably timely manner \nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 11 of 31\n25.  As to both proposed classes, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and \nprotect the interests of the Class.  There are no conflicts of interest between the Plaintiffs and the \nother members of the Class.  The Class members will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf \nof the Class.  The Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill and \nexperience in civil rights and mental health litigation, who will vigorously prosecute this case on \nbehalf of the Class. \n26.  For both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees, the Department has acted \nor failed or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class. \n27.  The claims asserted herein are capable of repetition while evading review.  There \nis a continuing and substantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in favor of Plaintiffs and the Classes. \n28.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs and other members of the Classes seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and all of the necessary factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present. \n29.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause  individual  litigation  of  these  claims  would  be  impracticable  and  would  be  unduly \nburdensome to the courts.  Further, this suit may be maintained as a class action because common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and \nindividual litigation would increase the likelihood of inconsistent or contradictory judgments.  A \nclass  action  presents  fewer  management  difficulties  and  provides  the  benefits  of  a  single \nadjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 12 of 31\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n30.  Defendant  and  his  Department,  through  their  actions  and  inaction,  cause \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees to be incarcerated for weeks or months before the \nDepartment provides them their court-ordered competency restoration treatment, evaluation and/or \ntreatment services.  \nA.  Defendantโs duty to  timely  admit incompetent detainees to a DSHS  facility for \ncompetency restoration services \n \n31.  Under state and federal law, individuals who lack the ability to understand the \nnature of the criminal court proceedings against them may not be tried. \n32.  Article 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when a criminal defendantโs mental competency is challenged during \ncriminal proceedings.  \n33.  A person is incompetent to stand trial if he or she does not have โsufficient present \nability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,โ or \nโa rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.โ  TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. ANN. arts. 46B.003(a)(1)&(2).   \n34.  โEither party may suggest by motion, or the trial court may suggest on its own \nmotion, that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(a).  โIf the court \ndetermines that there is evidence to support a finding of incompetence, the court . . . shall stay all \nother proceedings in the case.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(d).  โIf the defendant is found incompetent to \nstand trial, the court shall proceed under Subchapter D.โ  Id. \n35.  Pursuant to Subchapter D, article 46B.071, the court, on a determination that a \ncriminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial, shall either commit the defendant to a mental \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 13 of 31\nhealth facility designated by the Department of State Health Services under 46B.073, or release \nthe defendant on bail subject to conditions under 46B.072.  Id., art. 46B.071. \n36.  For a defendant not released on bail, โ[t]he court shall commit a defendant . . . to a \nmental health facility or residential care facility for a period not to exceed 60 days (misdemeanor) \nor 120 days (felony) for further examination and treatment toward the specific objective of \nattaining competency to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.073(b) (emphasis added). \n37.  If a defendant is charged with a โviolent offense,โ as listed in article 17.032(a), \nother than an assault, or the indictment alleges an affirmative finding that a deadly weapon was \nused during the commission of a felony, โthe court shall enter an order committing the defendant \nto the maximum security unit [MSU] of any facility designated by the department . . ..โ  Id., art. \n46B.073(c).  If the defendant is not charged with one of the enumerated offenses, โthe court shall \nenter an order committing the defendant to a mental health facility or residential care facility . . ..โ  \nId., art. 46B.073(d). \n38.  An order committing the defendant for restoration of competency โmust place the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to \nreceive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.โ  Id., art. 46B.075. \n39.  Not later than the date of the order of commitment, the court must send a copy of \nthe order to the facility to which the defendant is committed.  Id., art. 46B.076(a). \n40.  The facility to which the defendant is committed must: develop an individual \nprogram of treatment; assess and evaluate whether the defendant will obtain competency in the \nforeseeable future; and report to the court and local mental health or mental retardation authority \non defendantโs progress toward achieving competency.  Id., art. 46B.077(a).   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 14 of 31\n41.  Not later than the 15th day before the date on which the restoration period is to \nexpire, the head of the facility must so notify the court that the restoration period is about to expire.  \nId., art. 46B.079(a).  Further, the head of the facility must also โpromptlyโ notify the court when \nthe defendant has obtained competency to stand trial or upon a determination that the defendant \nwill not attain competency in the foreseeable future.  Id., art. 46B.079(b).   \n42.  On the return of the defendant to the court, the court must make a determination as \nto the defendantโs competency to stand trial.  The court must make this determination not later \nthan the 20th day after the court received the notice from the head of the facility required by article \n46B.079. Id., art. 46B.084(a).  If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, criminal \nproceedings may be resumed; if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the court may \ndetermine whether the defendant should be subject to civil commitment. \nB.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity to \na DSHS facility for evaluation and/or treatment \n \n43.  Article 46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when the defense of insanity is raised on behalf of a criminal defendant. \n44.  A person is not guilty by reason of insanity if a judge or jury has determined: โ(1) \nthe prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged conduct constituting \nthe offense was committed; and (2) the defense has established by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged conduct.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. \nart. 46C.153(a). \n45.  โ[A] defendant who is found not guilty by reason of insanity stands acquitted of the \noffense charged and may not be considered a person charged with an offense.โ  Id., art. 46C.155(a) \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 15 of 31\n46.  Since the individual is acquitted of the offense and no longer considered a person \ncharged with an offense, โโฆthe court may [only] order the defendant detained in jail or any other \nsuitable place for a period not to exceed 14 days.โ Id., art. 46C.160(a). \n47.  Following a finding that an individual is not guilty by reason of insanity, the court \nmust immediately determine whether the offense of which the person was acquitted involved \ndangerous conduct, as defined in art. 46C.157.   \n48.  If the court determines that the offense involved dangerous conduct, โ[t]he court \nshall order the acquitted person to be committed for evaluation of the personโs present mental \ncondition and for treatment to the maximum security unit of any facility designated by the \n[Department of State Health Services].โ  Id., art. 46C.251(a); see also 46C.001(2) (defining \nโdepartmentโ).   \n49.  When  there  is  a  finding  of  dangerous  conduct  and  an  insanity  acquittee  is \ncommitted to a Department facility for evaluation and/or treatment services, the facility designated \nby the Department receives a copy of the transcript of all medical testimony and certain identifying \ninformation regarding the insanity acquittee. Id., arts. 46C.251(b)(1)&(2).   \n50.  Upon transfer of the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by the Department \nwithin 14 days, and following the evaluation and/or treatment of the insanity acquittee, the \nDepartment must file a report that describes and explains the procedure, techniques, and tests used \nin the examination of the person. Id., art. 46C.252(b).  โThe report must address:  \n(1) whether the acquitted person has a mental illness or [intellectual disability] and, \nif so, whether the mental illness or [intellectual disability] is severe; \n(2) whether as a result of any severe mental illness or [intellectual disability] the \nacquitted person is likely to cause serious harm to another;  \n(3) whether as a result of any impairment the acquitted person is subject to \ncommitment under Subtitle C or D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code;  \n(4) prospective treatment  and supervision  options, if any, appropriate for the \nacquitted person; and  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 16 of 31\n(5) whether any required treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively \nprovided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision.โ \n \nId., art. 46C.252(c). \n \n51.  On the return of the insanity acquittee to court, the court shall conduct a hearing on \ndisposition and shall order the acquitted person (i) committed for inpatient treatment or residential \ncare, (ii) to receive outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, (iii) transferred to \nan appropriate court for civil commitment proceedings under the Texas Health and Safety Code, \nor (iv) discharged and immediately released.  Id., arts. 46C.253(b)-(e). \nC.  County jails are unable to provide competency restoration services to individuals \nfound  incompetent  to  stand  trial  and  are  unable  to  provide  evaluation  and/or \ntreatment services to individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity \n \n52.  County jails in Texas are inappropriate settings for the care and treatment of \nindividuals with mental illness or intellectual disabilities (formerly called โmental retardationโ).  \nJails are not designed to be therapeuticโthey are inherently punitiveโnor do they provide any \ntreatment aimed at restoring a person to competency or evaluation and/or treatment services for \nindividuals found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n53.  Correctional facilities, particularly facilities designed for short-term detention, do \nnot have the staffing, funding, or capabilities to provide treatment aimed at restoring a person to \ncompetency or evaluation and/or treatment services for individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity. \n54.  Detainees who are found incompetent to stand trial and detainees who are found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity are often the most severely mentally ill in Texas jail settings. \n55.  Most  Texas  jails  do  not  have  the  ability  to  provide  even  basic  psychiatric \nstabilization and management.  As a result, many detainees with serious mental illness are harmed \nby the punitive jail setting as manifested by either increased symptoms of their underlying \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 17 of 31\npsychiatric disorder or lack of improvement regarding their current symptoms.  By refusing to \ntimely take custody of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees), Defendant \nand his Department cause such persons to be incarcerated in county jails under conditions nearly \ncertain to exacerbate their mental health condition(s). \n56.  Because county jails are often unable to provide even basic mental health treatment, \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees frequently end up between a rock and a hard place: \neither they are housed in the general jail populationโoften with convicted offendersโor they are \nplaced in solitary confinement, which causes their mental health to further deteriorate.  This \ndeterioration  conflicts  with  the  Stateโs  interest  in  prompt  evaluation  and  treatment  so  that \nincompetent detainees may be brought to trial, or so that insanity acquittees are not punished for \ncrimes they were acquitted of and are appropriately committed, transferred, or released.  \n57.  Besides struggling to provide even basic mental health care, county jails in Texas \ndo not have the specific services necessary to restore individuals to competency to stand trial, such \nas the most current medications, identification of specific social needs to restore and maintain \ncompetency, and training specific to the restoration of competency.  In contrast, state mental health \nfacilities are specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment to restore incompetent detainees \nto competence, thereby enabling them to stand trial.   \n58.  County jails in Texas also do not have the specific services necessary to provide \nevaluation and/or treatment services to insanity acquittees.  State mental health facilities, however, \nare specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment and to conduct evaluations to make \ncomplex determinations about a personโs mental health condition(s), including whether a person \nis likely to cause serious harm to another, whether a person is subject to commitment under the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 18 of 31\nTexas Health and Safety Code, and determinations regarding the appropriateness, safety, and \neffectiveness of prospective treatment and supervision options.  \n59.  Nevertheless,  Defendant  knowingly,  intentionally,  and  deliberately  refuses  to \naccept individuals found incompetent to stand trial and individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity into state mental health facilities in violation of the requirements of Chapters 46B and \n46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the orders of the criminal courts, and the U.S. \nConstitution.        \nD.  Defendant has failed to timely admit incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees \nwho have been ordered to a Department mental health facility. \n \n60.  According to a 2014 Joint Report by the National Sheriffโs Association and the \nTreatment Advocacy Center, โTexas is among the states with the lowest number of public \npsychiatric beds and among the stingiest states in per capita mental health spending.โ  \n61.  Because the Department facilities are full, the Department places detainees (both \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees) on a waiting list until a bed becomes available at \nthe designated facility.   \n62.  In June of 2014, the number of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees) waiting to be transferred to a state mental health facility was about 170; by February \nof 2016, the number had risen to more than 380.  By February 2016, detainees were waiting an \naverage of 41 days in local jails.  As of April 1, 2016, the longest wait time for a non-maximum \nsecurity bed was 275 daysโalmost nine months.  According to the Department, as of April 1, \n2016, the average wait time for a maximum security bed was 122 days.  Currently, about 283 \nindividuals are waiting in county jails for a maximum security bed, and of those individuals, about \n246 have been waiting longer than 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting in jail for a \nmaximum security bed the longest has been waiting about 321 days.  As for the wait list for a non-\n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 19 of 31\nmaximum security bed, there are currently about 96 individuals waiting in jail for such a bed, and \nof those 96, about 4 have been waiting longer than 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting \nin jail the longest for a non-maximum security bed has been waiting 34 days.   \n63.  According to a May 13, 2016 investigative report by ABC-13, state statistics going \nback to 2006 show that the number of detainees waiting in jails for competency restoration \ntreatment โhas never been this long,โ and that the number of individuals on the wait list has grown \nby โ20% in the last six months.โ   \n64.  The delay in admitting those found incompetent to stand trial infringes on their right \nto be free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction as well as the ability to receive \ncompetency-restoration treatment, which necessarily extends the time within which an individual \ncan be tried once restored to competency.   \n65.  The delay in admitting those found not guilty by reason of insanity infringes on \ntheir right to be free from incarceration after being absolved of criminal responsibility, as well as \ntheir ability to receive evaluation and treatment so that the criminal courts can reach final \ndispositions in the civil commitments.  \n66.  Because incompetent criminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime \nand insanity acquittees have been absolved of criminal responsibility, both classes of persons have \na liberty interest in freedom from incarceration, and a liberty interest in receiving treatment.  \nBecause the court has ordered that incompetent detainees must be provided with restorative \ntreatment and that insanity acquittees must be provided with evaluation and/or treatment services, \nlack of funds, staff, or facilities cannot justify the Defendantโs failure to provide the court-ordered \ntreatment in a timely manner. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 20 of 31\n67.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, the Individual Plaintiffs and the \nClasses will continue to be deprived of their liberty rights without due process of law, in violation \nof their constitutional rights.   \n68.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt of Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Harris County to transfer Mr. Ward to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Harris County Jail.  Mr. Ward \ndoes not receive competency-restoration treatment in jail. \n69.  Mr. Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, HIV, epilepsy, asthma, \nand hypertension.  Harris County Jail staff note that Mr. Ward has a history of neurocognitive \nimpairment.  In February 2016, during a mental health assessment, staff noted Mr. Wardโs \nconfusion and inability to remember information such as street names, location, and names of \ndoctors.  Staff noted that โcompetency restoration may be unlikely or slow based on current clinical \npresentation of the assessment.โ    \n70.  Mr. Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he has \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial.  During this recent incarceration, Mr. Ward requested, and \ncurrently  voluntarily  takes,  his  psychotropic  medications;  however,  he  continues  to  report \ncommand auditory hallucinations as recently as May of 2016. \n71.  Plaintiff Michael Anderson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 299th Judicial \nDistrict Court, Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 18, 2016, Mr. Anderson was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to a mental health facility for further examination and \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 21 of 31\ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to the state mental health facility.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Anderson to a state \nmental health facility and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  \nMr. Anderson receives no competency restoration treatment in Jail.  \n72.  Mr. Anderson has been diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder, an intellectual \ndisability, schizoaffective disorder, and diabetes.  He has a long history of mental illness and has \nbeen treated by the Austin Travis County Mental Health Authority since 1993.  \n73.  While incarcerated, Mr. Anderson has exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related \nto his mental illness.  Records by the Jail counselor indicate that Mr. Anderson has exhibited \nincoherent thought processes and delusional content and thought processes.  As recently as June \n2016, records show that Mr. Anderson urinates on himself and in his cell.  Following this incident, \nMr. Anderson was placed in a single cell, where Jail staff are required to conduct visual checks \nevery 30 minutes.  \n74.  Plaintiff Isaac Lemelle is a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about March 30, 2016, Mr. Lemelle was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lemelle to the state mental health facility.   Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Lemelle to a state \nmental health facility, and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  \nMr. Lemelle does not receive competency restoration treatment in Jail. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 22 of 31\n75.  Mr. Lemelle is diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia and other psychotic \ndisorders and antisocial personality disorder. The Travis County Jail has classified his mental \nhealth needs as severe. He has a long history of mental illness, and was first treated by the Austin \nTravis County Mental Health Authority in 2008, at age thirteen.  \n76.  During his current incarceration, Mr. Lemelle has exhibited numerous symptoms \nand behaviors as a result of his mental illness, including throwing urine and smearing feces, \nbehaviors which have required his placement in the Jailโs psychiatric lockdown units in a single \ncell.  Individuals in psychiatric lockdown are permitted outside of their cell in the dayroom for one \nhour a day.  They are not guaranteed any time outdoors.  Jail personnel are required to conduct \nvisual checks every 30 minutes.  Mr. Lemelle has also required protective restraints.  \n77.  On  February  23,  2016,  while  Mr.  Lemelle  was  in  jail  waiting  to  be  found \nincompetent to stand trial, officers were notified that Mr. Lemelle stated he wanted to kill himself \nand may have swallowed a razor.  While attempting to place Mr. Lemelle in a restraint chair to \nexamine his mouth for a razor, and to transport him to an isolation cell, Mr. Lemelle spit at a \ncorrections officer.  This incident led to the additional charge of harassment of a public servant \nbeing pressed against Mr. Lemelle.  Following this incident, Mr. Lemelle was transported to a Full \nSuicide Precautions (โFSPโ) unit, where he was placed in a rubber cell and provided only a smock \nas clothing.  In FSP units, Jail staff are required to conduct 15 minute visual checks.  Medical and \npsychiatric evaluations and meetings are conducted through a food chute, i.e., a small opening on \nthe door of each individual cell that is used to pass food to the individuals.  Mr.  Lemelle has also \nbeen accused of approximately fifteen (15) rule violations (on four separate occasions) that \nrequired review by the Travis County Sheriffโs Office disciplinary board. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 23 of 31\n78.  Plaintiff Marc Lawson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 390th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about May 11, 2016, Mr. Lawson was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lawson to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, the Department has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Lawson to its state \nmental health facility and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  \nMr. Lawson does not receive competency restoration treatment in Jail. \n79.  Mr. Lawson is twenty-two years old, has never previously been incarcerated, and \nhas been in the Texas Child Protective Services system since age five.  Mr. Lawson is diagnosed \nwith an intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder/ADHD,  Bipolar  Disorder,  Conduct  Disorder,  Antisocial  Personality  Disorder, \nEpilepsy/Seizure Disorder and Hepatitis C. Mr. Lawson has a history of treatment at psychiatric \nhospitals and utilization of medication from a young age.   \n80.  During Mr. Lawsonโs incarceration, Jail personnel report that he has obvious \ncognitive deficits and poor social skills.  He is categorized as vulnerable, and Jail personnel have \ndocumented concerns over his being housed in a cell with other inmates due to his vulnerability. \nUpon his admission, Mr. Lawson was initially placed in full suicide precaution and/or psychiatric \nlockdown housing for about one week. While in psychiatric lockdown and full suicide precaution \nhousing, Mr. Lawson was permitted outside of his cell for only one hour a day, and it was not \nguaranteed that he would receive any time outdoors.  He was then transferred to and housed in a \nsingle cell for over two months. Mr. Lawson is prescribed two medications for his medical \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 24 of 31\nconditions and one antipsychotic. The Travis County Jail has classified his mental health and \nmedical needs as severe.  \n81.  Mr. Lawsonโs psychiatric evaluation from May 2016 states that he is incompetent \nto stand trial and โcompetency cannot be restored in the foreseeable future with traditional \ncompetency restoration treatment due to the chronic nature of his condition.โ  The psychiatrist \ndocumented that although he is prescribed psychiatric medication, the medication โwill not \nimprove cognitive symptoms responsible for observed deficits relating to trial competency.โ  \n82.  Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin is a defendant in a criminal case in the 403rd Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 6, 2016, Ms. Lampkin was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nThe order also required the Sheriff to transport Ms. Lampkin to a state mental health facility.  \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, the Department has not allowed Travis County to transfer Ms. \nLampkin to its state mental health facility, and as a result, she continues to be incarcerated in the \nTravis County Jail.  Ms. Lampkin does not receive competency restoration treatment in Jail. \n83.  Ms. Lampkin is diagnosed with an Intellectual Disability and Bipolar Disorder. She \nalso has a history of psychosis, resulting in numerous emergency psychiatric hospitalizations.  She \nhas a long history of mental illness and has a history of being treated by Austin Travis County \nIntegral Care. \n84.  While incarcerated, Ms. Lampkin has exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related \nto her mental health condition.  Records by the jail counselor indicate that Ms. Lampkin has \nobvious cognitive deficits and is low functioning.  Ms. Lampkin has exclusively been housed in \npsychiatric housing, and as recently as July 2016, the jail counselor reports that she is โstruggling \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 25 of 31\ndue to isolation.โ  Moreover, the jail conditions have affected Ms. Lampkinโs physical condition.  \nOver the duration of her incarceration, Ms. Lampkin has lost over 30 lbs. \n85.  Plaintiff Alexander Soto was a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial \nDistrict Court in Harris County, Texas.  On or about May 10, 2016, Mr. Soto was found not guilty \nby reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental health \nfacility for an evaluation.  Despite the criminal courtโs order and the 14-day time limit in TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. ANN art. 46C.160, the Department has not allowed Harris County to transfer \nMr. Soto to a state mental health facility, and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the \nHarris County Jail.  Mr. Soto has not received the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in Jail.   \n86.  Mr. Soto has had significant psychiatric issues during his present incarceration at \nHarris County Jail.  A month after being arrested, in May of 2015, he was charged with another \nfelony after biting a guard.  Mr. Soto was found incompetent to stand trial on his original charge \non July 2, 2015.  He was transferred to a Department state mental health facility for competency \nrestoration treatment.  After he was restored to competency, he returned to Harris County Jail, and \nthe Jail sought and obtained a court order forcing Mr. Soto to take psychiatric medication.  The \nstate dismissed Mr. Sotoโs charge for biting a guard when he was found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity.  Mr. Soto is currently housed in a solitary cell in the acute section of the Mental Health \nUnit at Harris County Jail.   \n87.  Plaintiff Morgan Areshchenko was a defendant in a criminal case in the 427th \nJudicial District Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 4, 2016, Ms. Areshchenko was \nfound not guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security \nmental health facility for evaluation of her present mental condition and for treatment.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order and the 14-day time limit in TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN art. 46C.160, the \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 26 of 31\nDepartment has not allowed Travis County to transfer Ms. Areshchenko to a state mental health \nfacility,  and,  as  a  result,  she  continues  to  be  incarcerated  in  the  Travis  County  Jail.   Ms. \nAreshchenko has not received the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in Jail. \n88.  On information and belief, Ms. Areshchenko is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and \nschizoaffective disorder.   \n89.  Ms.  Areshchenko  has  had  significant  psychiatric  issues  during  her  present \nincarceration at the Travis County Jail.  Ms. Areshchenko was initially found incompetent to stand \ntrial on this charge on September 8, 2015.  She was transferred to a Department state mental health \nfacility for competency restoration treatment.  She was subsequently returned to court, where she \nwas found not guilty by reason of insanity. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \nA.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Incompetent Detainees Rights \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \n90.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 89 above are incorporated \nherein. \n91.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n92.  Criminal defendants who have not been convicted and have been adjudicated \nincompetent to stand trial have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and in receiving \ncompetency restoration treatment. \n93.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 27 of 31\n94.  Once an individual is found unable to aid and assist in their own defense, all \ncriminal  proceedings  must  stop,  thus  eliminating  punishment  as  a  lawful  purpose  for  their \nincarceration.  The only stated lawful purpose for their continued confinement is commitment to \nthe Defendantโs facility where they are to be provided restorative treatment so as to return him or \nher to competency. \n95.  County jails do not provide the restorative treatment required by state law. \n96.  No legitimate state interest justifies the continued incarceration of incompetent \ncriminal  defendants  in  county  jails  for  months  on  end.    The  nature  and  duration  of  their \nincarceration bear no reasonable relation to the restorative purpose for which the court has \ncommitted these individuals. \n97.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of incompetent detainees \nare entitled to an order of the Court declaring that, by requiring persons found incompetent to stand \ntrial to remain in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to provide restorative treatment \nin a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n98.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members found incompetent to stand trial.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other Class members are therefore entitled to an order of the Court enjoining Defendant \nfrom further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation to their continued \nincarceration in jail while awaiting a bed at a DSHS mental health facility where they can receive \nthe state-mandated restorative treatment.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 28 of 31\nB.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Insanity Acquitteesโ Rights Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \n99.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 98 above are incorporated \nherein. \n100.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n101.  Persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, and thereby acquitted \nof criminal charges, have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and in receiving court-\nordered evaluation and/or treatment services. \n102.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n103.  Once an individual is found not guilty by reason of insanity, they have been \nacquitted of the offense charged and cannot remain incarcerated.  The only stated lawful purpose \nfor their continued confinement is commitment to a Department facility where they are to be \nprovided evaluation and treatment services for the personโs present mental condition, which will \nenable the court to reach final disposition. \n104.  County jails do not have the resources or expertise to provide the evaluation and/or \ntreatment services mandated by state law. \n105.  No legitimate state interest justifies the incarceration of insanity acquittees in \ncounty jails for months on end.  The nature and duration of their incarceration bear no reasonable \nrelation to the evaluation and/or treatment purpose for which the court has committed insanity \nacquittees. \n106.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittes are \nentitled to  an order of  the Court declaring that, by requiring insanity  acquittees to  remain \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 11   Filed 09/12/16   Page 29 of 31\nincarcerated in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to provide evaluation and/or \ntreatment in a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n107.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are therefore entitled to an order of the \nCourt enjoining Defendant from further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation \nto their continued confinement while awaiting evaluation and/or treatment at a DSHS mental \nhealth facility.   \nATTORNEYโS FEES \n108.  Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneyโs fees, costs, and expenses pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE: Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to: \nA.  Certify the Classes, as defined above; \nB.  Enter an Order declaring that, by requiring defendants found incompetent to stand \ntrial  to remain incarcerated in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to \nprovide restorative treatment services for incompetent detainees in a reasonably \ntimely manner, Defendant is depriving Plaintiffs and Class Members of their due \nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nC.

JOHN HELLERSTEDT, in his official   ยง\ncapacity as Commissioner of the Texas    ยง\nDepartment of State Health Services.    ยง\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\nOF THE UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\nTO: THE HONORABLE LEE YEAKEL\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\nBefore the Court are Hellerstedtโs Second Amended Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 30); \nPlaintiffsโ Response (Dkt. No. 31); and Hellerstedtโs Reply (Dkt. No. 33). The District Court referred\nthe above motions to the undersigned Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. ยง636(b) and Rule 1(c) of Appendix C of the Local Rules. The Court held a hearing on\nMarch 28, 2017.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nThis case is a proposed class action brought on behalf of seven currently incarcerated\nindividuals, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.1  The two purported classes are comprised of individuals\nfound not guilty by reason of insanity and individuals found incompetent to stand trial, who assert\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights are violated when they are housed for prolonged\n1Joseph Ward, Michael Anderson, Isaac Lemelle, Mare Lawson and Jennifer Lampkin are\ndefendants in criminal cases who have been found incompetent to stand trial, and have been ordered\ncommitted at a mental health facility to receive competency-restoration services. Cecil Adickes and\nMichael Gibson were defendants in criminal cases who were found not guilty by reason of insanity\nand have been ordered to commitment at a maximum security mental health facility for evaluation\nof their present mental condition and for treatment.  \n\nperiods in Texas jails without adequate mental health treatment, while waiting for a bed to open up\nin a Texas Department of State Health Services facility. Defendant Dr. John Hellerstedt is currently\nthe duly appointed Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services and is sued in\nhis official capacity. \nIn Texas, when an individual charged with a crime is found incompetent to stand trial, all\ncriminal proceedings must stop and the individual must be transferred to a Department facility to be\nprovided further examination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency\nto stand trial. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.004, 46B.071-073. Persons found incompetent to\nstand trial and charged with a โviolent offenseโ must be transferred to the maximum security unit\ndesignated by the Department. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.073(c).\nWhen an individual is found not guilty by reason of insanity, the individual stands acquitted\nof the offense charged and may not be considered a person charged with an offense. TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. art. 46C.155(a). If the court determines that the acquitteeโs offense caused, placed\nanother in, or threatened serious bodily injury, the individual must, within 14 days, be transferred\nto the maximum security unit designated by the Department for evaluation of the personโs present\nmental condition and for treatment. TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.157, 46C.251-252(a), and\n46C.160. Once transferred, the Department is required to evaluate the acquittee for 30 days, TEX.\nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.251(a), (d), after which the acquittee must be released if, after a hearing,\nthe State fails to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the individual has a mental illness and\nis dangerous. Id. at 46C.252-258.\nPlaintiffs argue that Hellerstedtโs failure to timely accept transfer of incompetent detainees\nand insanity acquittees to Department facilities and provide timely restoration and evaluative\n2\n\ntreatment forces Plaintiffs and members of the classes they represent to remain incarcerated for\nweeks and months in county jails without any of the treatment or evaluation services that Hellerstedt\nand his Department are statutorily required, and have been ordered, to provide. Plaintiffs argue that\nbecause incompetent criminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime and insanity\nacquittees have been absolved of criminal responsibility, both classes of persons have a liberty\ninterest in freedom from incarceration, and a liberty interest in the receipt of restorative treatment.\nPlaintiffs seek a declaration of their rights and an order enjoining Hellerstedt from violating their\nrights. Plaintiffs assert that they are not seeking immediate release.\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a party to move to dismiss an action for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. FED. R. CIV. P.12(b)(6).  In deciding a Rule\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, โ[t]he court accepts all well-pleaded facts as\ntrue, viewing them in the light most favorable to the [nonmovant].โ  In re Katrina Canal Breaches\nLitig., 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 552 U.S.\n1182 (2008). The Supreme Court has explained that a complaint must contain sufficient factual\nmatter โto state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.โ  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\n(2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  โA claim has facial\nplausibility when the [nonmovant] pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\ninference that the [movant] is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ  Id.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA.  Plaintiffsโ Due Process Claim \nThe parties spend a fair portion of their briefs arguing over the framing of Plaintiffsโ\nconstitutional claim. Hellerstedt insists that Plaintiffs are asserting that they have a stand alone\n3\n\nconstitutional right to restorative treatment, something that has not been recognized by the Supreme\nCourt or Fifth Circuit. Plaintiffs insist that they are not asserting such a claim.  The incompetent\ndetaineesโ pleadings include the following:\n  Criminal defendants who not been convicted and have been adjudicated incompetent\nto stand trial have liberty interests . . . in receiving competency-restoration treatment.\n*  *  *\nThe Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of incompetent detainees are\nentitled to an order of the Court declaring that . . . by failing to provide restorative\ntreatment in a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment due process rights of the Plaintiffs and other Class members.\nSecond Amended Complaint ยถยถ 90, 64, 95.4.  The insanity acquittees plead:  \nPersons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, and thereby acquitted\nof criminal charges, have liberty interests in . . . receiving court ordered evaluation\nand/or treatment.\n*  *  *\nThe Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are\nentitled to an order of the Court declaring that . . . by failing to provide evaluation\nand/or  treatment  in  a  reasonably  timely  manner,  Defendant  has  violated  the\nFourteenth Amendment due process rights of the Plaintiffs and other Class members.\nId. at ยถยถ 99, 104.\nAt the hearing, Plaintiffs confirmed they are not asserting they have a stand-alone liberty\ninterest in the receipt of restorative treatment while in jail; rather, counsel for Plaintiffs stated that\nthey are proceeding under Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972), which held that the nature and\nduration of a personโs confinement must bear a reasonable relationship to the purpose of their\nconfinement.  Given Texas lawโs stated purpose for their detention,2 this means the nature and\nduration of their confinement must bear a reasonable relationship to their receiving restorative and\n2See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. arts. 46B.073(b) & 46C.251(a). \n4\n\nevaluative treatment.  Plaintiffsโ complaint is that by allowing them to languish in a jail setting for\nmonths on end with no treatment or evaluation, the Department is violating their established\nFourteenth Amendment Due Process right recognized in Jackson. They are not arguing that detention\nin such a jail setting without treatment or evaluation for any length of time, no matter how brief,\nwould violate their Due Process rights, or that the jails must provide them those services while they\nawait transferโthe sort of claims a โstand aloneโ Due Process claim would entail.\nIn Jackson, the Supreme Court addressed the question of how long a person could be\ndetained as a result of his incompetence to stand trial.  The Court adopted a general rule of\nreasonableness with regard to the duration of pretrial incarceration for incompetent defendants,\nrequiring at a minimum, โthat the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation\nto the purpose for which the individual is committed.โ 406 U.S. at 733. The Court further held that:\na person charged by a State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on\naccount of his incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than the reasonable\nperiod of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that\nhe will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future.  If it is determined that this is not\nthe case, then the State must either institute the customary civil commitment\nproceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release\nthe defendant.  Furthermore, even if it is determined that the defendant probably soon\nwill be able to stand trial, his continued commitment must be justified by progress\ntoward that goal. \nId. at 738.  In Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324 (1982), the mother of a mental patient who\nsuffered injuries while involuntarily committed to a state mental institution challenged her childโs\nconfinement.    The  Supreme  Court  held  that  an  involuntarily  committed  individual  enjoys\nconstitutionally  protected  interests  in  conditions  of  reasonable  care  and  safety,  reasonably\nnonrestrictive confinement, and such training as may be required by these interests.  โSuch\nconditions of confinement would comport fully with the purpose of respondentโs commitment.โ  Id.;\nSee also, Foucha v. Louisiana, 504 U.S. 71, 79 (1992) (โDue process requires that the nature of\n5\n\ncommitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.โ)\n(citing Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 368 (1983).\nIn support of the motion to dismiss, Hellerstedt relies on DeShaney v. Winnebago County\nDepโt of Soc. Serv., 489 U.S. 189, 197 (1989), a case in which a child sued the state for placing him\nback in the custody of his physically abusive father.  He contends that DeShaney stands for the\nproposition that there is no affirmative right to any governmental benefit and that the Due Process\nClause does not give detainees a right to a particular degree, speed, or effectiveness of treatment.\nHellerstedt reads DeShaney too broadly.  As noted, the suit in that case alleged that the stateโs bad\nact was its failure to remove the child from his fatherโs custody.  In DeShaney, the Court found that\nthe stateโs failure to protect an individual from private violence generally does not violate the Due\nProcess Clause.  The Court explained that โit is the Stateโs affirmative act of restraining the\nindividualโs freedom to act on his own behalfโthrough incarceration, institutionalization, or other\nsimilar restraint of personal libertyโwhich is the โdeprivation of libertyโ triggering the protections\nof the Due Process Clause, not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted\nby other means.โ  Id. at 200.  Hellerstedt tries to stretch DeShaney further, and argues that it rejected\nthe concept that โonce a state confines an individual for care and treatment to a stated end, it is\nrequired to provide sufficient care and treatment to achieve that end.โ  Dkt. No. 30 at 7-8.  That is\nnot quite correct.  DeShaney is limited to the question of what a stateโs obligations are with regard\nto the protection from harm of a confined or restrained person.  It says nothing about how long the\nstate may hold a person in custody solely due to their incompetency to stand trial or their acquittal\ndue to insanity, without addressing their mental state.  That is what the Court addressed in Jackson,\nFoucha, and the other decisions in that line of cases.  Each of the Plaintiff groups has stated a viable\nclaim for relief under Jackson, which remains good law, and DeShaney does not undermine such a\nclaim. \n6\n\nB. Dangerousness and the Insanity Acquitees\nWith regard to the insanity acquitees, Hellerstedt makes an additional argument.  He contends\nthat this group has failed to state a claim, because it has made the flawed assumption that the only\nlawful purpose for their continued confinement is evaluation and treatment at a Department facility.\nHellerstedt argues the insanity acquitees may be constitutionally held purely on the basis of their\ncontinued dangerousness and the Stateโs corresponding interest in protecting society, which he\ncontends is allowed by Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354 (1983). \nIn Jones, an insanity aquittee challenged the constitutionality of the duration of his\ncommitment, which lasted longer than the maximum sentence he could have received had be been\nconvicted of the charged crime.  The Supreme Court stated: \nThe purpose of commitment following an insanity acquittal, like that of civil\ncommitment, is to treat the individualโs mental illness and protect him and society\nfrom his potential dangerousness. The committed acquittee is entitled to release when\nhe has recovered his sanity or is no longer dangerous.\nJones, 463 U.S. at 368 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).  Hellerstedt misreads  Jones\nand Foucha (upon which he also relies).  Those case do not stand for the proposition that an insanity\nacquittee may be held in custody solely because he represents a danger to society. These cases\nexplicitly state that the purpose of such commitment is dualโtreatment and protection of society. \nIn Foucha, the Supreme Court held that, in order to comply with the Due Process Clause, the state\nmay only hold an insanity acquittee in a psychiatric facility ifโafter an adversarial hearingโhe is\nfound to be both dangerous and mentally ill; dangerousness alone was insufficient to support\nconfinement. Foucha, 504 U.S. at 80.  As has been noted, Texas law only permits confinement of\ninsanity acquittees for โevaluation of the personโs present mental condition and for treatment . . . .โ \nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.251(a).  A determination that an insanity acquitee is dangerous,\nwithout more, would therefore be insufficient to make constitutional an insanity acquiteesโs\n7\n\nindefinite incarceration in a county jail.  Moreover, continued detention based on dangerousness and\nmental illness is only constitutional when there has been a sufficiently prompt full adversarial\nhearing where the State has proven by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is\ndemonstrably dangerous to the community.  Foucha, 504 U.S. at 80; United States v. Salerno, 481\nU.S. 739, 746โ47 (1987) (upholding the Bail Reform Act as constitutional because the bailee was\nafforded a prompt detention hearing and the maximum length of pretrial detention was strictly\nlimited by the Speedy Trial Act).  In this case, Plaintiffs plead that they did not receive such a\nhearing after their acquittal.  Jones thus does not support dismissal of the acquiteesโ claim.\nC. Fourteen Day Deadline\nIn an off-hand statement at the end of his motion, Hellerstedt argues that, to the extent the\nPlaintiffs are suing to enforce the 14-day requirement found in TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.160,\nthe suit is barred by Pennhurst State School v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984) (holding the Eleventh\nAmendment bars a federal court from enjoining a state officer from violating state law).  While this\nis a correct statement of law, it is inapplicable to this case.  The Plaintiffs are not seeking to have this\nCourt enforce the maximum 14-day detention period Texas law sets after an insanity acquittal.  As\ndiscussed, Plaintiffs base their claim on the notion that detention without treatment or evaluation\nservices must be brief to conform to constitutional requirements.  They point to the 14-day transfer\nmandate of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure merely as one marker of what period of time is\nโreasonableโ in the Jackson determination, since that was the considered judgment of the Texas\nLegislature on the point.  The Court agrees.  Plaintiffsโ suit does not implicate, nor is it barred by,\nthe Eleventh Amendment.\nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \nBecause the Plaintiffs have stated a viable Fourteenth Amendment claim, the undersigned\nRECOMMENDS that the Court DENY Hellerstedtโs Second Amended Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No.\n8\n\n30).  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this cause of action be REMOVED from the docket of the\nundersigned and RETURNED to the docket of the Honorable Lee Yeakel. \nV.  WARNINGS\nThe parties may file objections to this Report and Recommendation. A party filing objections\nmust specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which objections are being made. \nThe District Court need not consider frivolous, conclusive, or general objections.  See Battle v.\nUnited States Parole Commโn, 834 F.2d 419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987).\nA partyโs failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations\ncontained in this Report within fourteen (14) days after the party is served with a copy of the Report\nshall bar that party from de novo review by the District Court of the proposed findings and\nrecommendations in the Report and, except upon grounds of plain error, shall bar the party from\nappellate review of unobjected-to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the\nDistrict Court.

When an individual charged with a crime is found to be incompetent to stand trial, \nTexas law requires that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (โHHSCโ)1 provide \nthe incompetent detainee with treatment aimed at restoring the individual to competency.  Texas \nlaw further requires that this specialized competency restoration treatment must be provided by \nHHSC, and the treatment can only be provided in a state mental health facility or, under certain \ncircumstances and with proper supervision, in a community-based outpatient program overseen by \nthe HHSC.2 \n2.  When an individual charged with a crime is found not guilty by reason of insanity, \nand the court determines that the offense of which the person was acquitted involved dangerous \nconduct, Texas law requires that the court commit the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by \nHHSC for evaluation of the personโs present mental condition and for treatment.  These services \ncan only be provided by HHSC.  Texas law states that the insanity acquittee cannot remain in jail \nawaiting transfer to a facility designated by HHSC for a period longer than 14 days. \n                                                           \n1 As of September 1, 2017, oversight of the state hospitals and behavioral health programs, formerly the purview of \nthe Department of State Health Services, was moved under the oversight of the Health and Human Services \nCommission. \n2 In 2013, the Texas Legislature appropriated money for two pilot jail-based competency restoration programs.  See \nActs 2013, 83rd Leg., ch. 797 (S.B. 1475), ยง 2, eff. Sept. 1, 2013.  As of the date of this filing, no jail-based \ncompetency-restoration program has been established.  Even if such a program is established, HHSC will still fund \nand operate the program. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 3 of 33\n3.  Because HHSCโs facilities are full, HHSC refuses to accept custody of those \nordered to its care and instead places persons found incompetent to stand trial and persons found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity on a waiting list until a bed at a HHSC mental health facility \nbecomes available.  It is not uncommon for these individuals, after the issuance of the order \ncommitting them to HHSC facilities, to wait in jail for months until HHSC accepts custody.   \n4.  Often, incompetent detaineesโdespite being presumed innocentโend up being \nincarcerated in jail prior to adjudication and pending treatment longer than if they had been found \nguilty of the alleged crime.  In addition, insanity acquitteesโdespite being acquittedโalso end up \nbeing  incarcerated  in  jail  for  months  after  an  adjudication  that  absolves  their  criminal \nresponsibility. \n5.  This situation is not new.  HHSC created its waiting list for individuals found \nincompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to a HHSC mental \nhealth facility in 2006.  Since 2006, the number of criminal defendants found incompetent or not \nguilty by reason of insanity and ordered to a HHSC facility for evaluation and/or treatment has \nonly increased. \n6.  As a result of the delays caused by HHSC, incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees languish in county jails absent a criminal conviction until a bed becomes available at a \nHHSC mental health facility.  Additionally, Texas jails are not designed or administered to provide \neither competency restoration treatment for incompetent detainees or evaluation and/or treatment \nservices for the psychiatric needs of insanity acquittees, leaving Plaintiffs with no meaningful \ncompetency restoration or evaluation and treatment while they wait for a bed at a HHSC facility.  \nAs such, incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees suffer needless deterioration of their mental \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 4 of 33\nhealth as they wait in jails, frequently in prolonged isolation, for weeks and months before they \nreceive the services HHSC is responsible for providing. \n7.  The delays caused by HHSC violate the due process rights of incompetent detainees \nand insanity acquittees as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendant has a duty to \naccept and treat detainees within a reasonable period of time, which must be measured in days, not \nweeks or months.  For insanity acquittees, Texas law specifically mandates that such persons not \nremain in jail in excess of 14 days.  Defendantโs failure to timely accept transfer of incompetent \ndetainees and insanity acquittees to its facilities and to provide timely restoration and evaluative \ntreatment,  however,  forces  Plaintiffs  and  members  of  the  Classes  they  represent  to  remain \nincarcerated for weeks and months in county jails absent criminal convictions and without any of \nthe  court-ordered competency restoration treatment or evaluation and/or treatment services that \nDefendant and HHSC are statutorily required to provide.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration \nof their rights and an order enjoining Defendant from violating their rights.       \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This civil action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of law of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction \nover this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question), and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (civil rights). \n9.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).  \nPARTIES \n10.

Mr. Lawson did not \nreceive competency restoration treatment in jail.  Plaintiff Lawsonโs mental state limited his ability \nto protect his legal interests.  As such, a next friend was necessary to represent his interests.  \nPlaintiff Lawsonโs defense attorney, Krista Chacona, volunteered and agreed to serve as Plaintiff \nLawsonโs next friend. \n14.

Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated as \nmembers of the following plaintiff classes: \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 10 of 33\na.  Class  for  Incompetent  Detainees  with  Named  Plaintiffs  Joseph  Ward,  Michael \nAnderson, Isaac Lemelle, Marc Lawson, Jennifer Lampkin, and Kenneth Jones, through \ntheir next friend, being appointed as class representatives: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the \nState of Texas, and: (a) who are ordered to a Texas HHSC facility where they \nare  to  receive  competency  restoration  services;  and  (b)  for  whom  HHSC \nreceives the court order; but (c) who remain detained in a Texas county jail. \n \nb.  Class for Insanity Acquittees with Named Plaintiffs Cecil Adickes, Michael Gibson, and \nMary Sapp, through their next friend, being appointed as class representatives: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the \nState of Texas and who are found not guilty by reason of insanity, and: (a) who \nare ordered to receive evaluation and/or treatment services at a HHSC facility; \n(b) for whom HHSC receives the court order; but (c) who remain detained in a \nTexas county jail for more than 14 days. \n \n21.  Plaintiffs  seek  class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2). \n22.  While the precise number of Class Members in each class is not known to Plaintiffs \nwith certainty because the number necessarily fluctuates, on information and belief, Plaintiffs \nestimate that there are approximately 346 individuals at present who, although ordered to a HHSC \nmental health facility to receive competency restoration services or evaluation and treatment \nservices, remain incarcerated in jail for months waiting for transportation to a HHSC mental health \nfacility.  An exact number of current Class members in each class is known to the HHSC and can \nbe  determined  through  discovery;  as  for  potential  future  Class  Members,  that  number  is \nindeterminable. \n23.  As for the class of individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial, the \nPlaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class because the individual \nPlaintiffs and the Class have all been adjudicated, or will be adjudicated, to be incompetent to \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 11 of 33\nstand trial and are, or will be, incarcerated in jail while waiting for a bed at a HHSC mental health \nfacility to receive the statutorily required competency restoration treatment.  Plaintiffs and all \nmembers of the Class have similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising from \nDefendantโs actions and inaction. \n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether HHSC has failed to accept the ordered transfer of Plaintiffs and other Class \nMembers to its facilities for competency-restoration treatment in a timely manner; \n \nWhether Defendantโs failure to admit individuals determined incompetent to stand \ntrial and ordered to HHSCโs mental health facilities for competency restoration \npurposes in a reasonably timely manner violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n25.  As for the class for individuals who have been found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity, the Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class because the \nindividual Plaintiffs and the Class have all been, or will be, found not guilty by reason of insanity \nand are, or will be, incarcerated in jail while waiting for a bed at a HHSC mental health facility to \nreceive the statutorily required evaluation and/or treatment services.  Plaintiffs and all members of \nthe Class have similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising from Defendantโs \nactions and inaction. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 12 of 33\n26.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether HHSC has failed to accept transfer of individual Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity for evaluation \nand/or treatment services in a timely manner; \n \nWhether HHSCโs failure to admit individuals who have been found not guilty by \nreason of insanity and ordered by the criminal court to its mental health facility for \nevaluation and/or treatment services in a reasonably timely manner violates the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n27.  As to both proposed classes, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and \nprotect the interests of the Class.  There are no conflicts of interest between the Plaintiffs and the \nother members of the Class.  The Class members will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf \nof the Class.  The Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill and \nexperience in civil rights and mental health litigation, who will vigorously prosecute this case on \nbehalf of the Class. \n28.  For both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees, HHSC has acted or failed \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class. \n29.  The claims asserted herein are capable of repetition while evading review.  There \nis a continuing and substantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in favor of Plaintiffs and the Classes. \n30.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs and other members of the Classes seek \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 13 of 33\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and all of the necessary factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present. \n31.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause  individual  litigation  of  these  claims  would  be  impracticable  and  would  be  unduly \nburdensome to the courts.  Further, this suit may be maintained as a class action because common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and \nindividual litigation would increase the likelihood of inconsistent or contradictory judgments.  A \nclass  action  presents  fewer  management  difficulties  and  provides  the  benefits  of  a  single \nadjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n32.  Defendant  and  HHSC,  through  their  actions  and  inaction,  cause  incompetent \ndetainees and insanity acquittees to be incarcerated for weeks or months before HHSC provides \nthem their court-ordered competency restoration treatment, evaluation and/or treatment services.  \nA.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit incompetent detainees to a HHSC facility for \ncompetency restoration services \n \n33.  Under state and federal law, individuals who lack the ability to understand the \nnature of the criminal court proceedings against them may not be tried. \n34.  Article 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when a criminal defendantโs mental competency is challenged during \ncriminal proceedings.  \n35.  A person is incompetent to stand trial if he or she does not have โsufficient present \nability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,โ or \nโa rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.โ  TEX.

Pursuant to Subchapter D, article 46B.071, the court, on a determination that a \ncriminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial, shall either commit the defendant to a mental \nhealth facility designated by the Health and Human Services Commission under 46B.073, or \nrelease the defendant on bail subject to conditions under 46B.072.  Id., art. 46B.071. \n38.  For a defendant not released on bail, โ[t]he court shall commit a defendant . . . to a \nmental health facility or residential care facility for a period not to exceed 60 days (misdemeanor) \nor 120 days (felony) for further examination and treatment toward the specific objective of \nattaining competency to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.073(b) (emphasis added). \n39.  If a defendant is charged with a โviolent offense,โ as listed in article 17.032(a), \nother than an assault, or the indictment alleges an affirmative finding that a deadly weapon was \nused during the commission of a felony, โthe court shall enter an order committing the defendant \nto the maximum security unit [MSU] of any facility designated by [HHSC] . . ..โ  Id., art. \n46B.073(c).  If the defendant is not charged with one of the enumerated offenses, โthe court shall \nenter an order committing the defendant to a mental health facility or residential care facility . . ..โ  \nId., art. 46B.073(d). \n40.  An order committing the defendant for restoration of competency โmust place the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to \nreceive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.โ  Id., art. 46B.075. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 15 of 33\n41.  Not later than the date of the order of commitment, the court must send a copy of \nthe order to the facility to which the defendant is committed.  Id., art. 46B.076(a). \n42.  The facility to which the defendant is committed must: develop an individual \nprogram of treatment; assess and evaluate whether the defendant will obtain competency in the \nforeseeable future; and report to the court and local mental health or mental retardation authority \non defendantโs progress toward achieving competency.  Id., art. 46B.077(a).   \n43.  Not later than the 15th day before the date on which the restoration period is to \nexpire, the head of the facility must so notify the court that the restoration period is about to expire.  \nId., art. 46B.079(a).  Further, the head of the facility must also โpromptlyโ notify the court when \nthe defendant has obtained competency to stand trial or upon a determination that the defendant \nwill not attain competency in the foreseeable future.  Id., art. 46B.079(b).   \n44.  On the return of the defendant to the court, the court must make a determination as \nto the defendantโs competency to stand trial.  The court must make this determination not later \nthan the 20th day after the court received the notice from the head of the facility required by article \n46B.079. Id., art. 46B.084(a).  If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, criminal \nproceedings may be resumed; if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the court may \ndetermine whether the defendant should be subject to civil commitment. \nB.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity to \na HHSC facility for evaluation and/or treatment \n \n45.  Article 46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when the defense of insanity is raised on behalf of a criminal defendant. \n46.  A person is not guilty by reason of insanity if a judge or jury has determined: โ(1) \nthe prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged conduct constituting \nthe offense was committed; and (2) the defense has established by a preponderance of the evidence \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 16 of 33\nthat the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged conduct.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. \nart. 46C.153(a). \n47.  โ[A] defendant who is found not guilty by reason of insanity stands acquitted of the \noffense charged and may not be considered a person charged with an offense.โ  Id., art. 46C.155(a) \n48.  Since the individual is acquitted of the offense and no longer considered a person \ncharged with an offense, โโฆthe court may [only] order the defendant detained in jail or any other \nsuitable place for a period not to exceed 14 days.โ Id., art. 46C.160(a). \n49.  Following a finding that an individual is not guilty by reason of insanity, the court \nmust immediately determine whether the offense of which the person was acquitted involved \ndangerous conduct, as defined in art. 46C.157.   \n50.  If the court determines that the offense involved dangerous conduct, โ[t]he court \nshall order the acquitted person to be committed for evaluation of the personโs present mental \ncondition and for treatment to the maximum security unit of any facility designated by the \n[Department  of  State  Health  Services  Health  and  Human  Services  Commission].โ  Id.,  art. \n46C.251(a).   \n51.  When  there  is  a  finding  of  dangerous  conduct  and  an  insanity  acquittee  is \ncommitted to a HHSC facility for evaluation and/or treatment services, the facility designated by \nHHSC  receives  a  copy  of  the  transcript  of  all  medical  testimony  and  certain  identifying \ninformation regarding the insanity acquittee. Id., arts. 46C.251(b)(1)&(2).   \n52.  Upon transfer of the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by HHSC within 14 \ndays, and following the evaluation and/or treatment of the insanity acquittee, HHSC must file a \nreport that describes and explains the procedure, techniques, and tests used in the examination of \nthe person. Id., art. 46C.252(b).  โThe report must address:  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 17 of 33\n(1) whether the acquitted person has a mental illness or [intellectual disability] and, \nif so, whether the mental illness or [intellectual disability] is severe; \n(2) whether as a result of any severe mental illness or [intellectual disability] the \nacquitted person is likely to cause serious harm to another;  \n(3) whether as a result of any impairment the acquitted person is subject to \ncommitment under Subtitle C or D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code;  \n(4) prospective treatment  and supervision  options, if any, appropriate for the \nacquitted person; and  \n(5) whether any required treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively \nprovided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision.โ \n \nId., art. 46C.252(c). \n \n53.  On the return of the insanity acquittee to court, the court shall conduct a hearing on \ndisposition and shall order the acquitted person (i) committed for inpatient treatment or residential \ncare, (ii) to receive outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, (iii) transferred to \nan appropriate court for civil commitment proceedings under the Texas Health and Safety Code, \nor (iv) discharged and immediately released.  Id., arts. 46C.253(b)-(e). \nC.  County jails are unable to provide competency restoration services to individuals \nfound  incompetent  to  stand  trial  and  are  unable  to  provide  evaluation  and/or \ntreatment services to individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity \n \n54.  County jails in Texas are inappropriate settings for the care and treatment of \nindividuals with mental illness or intellectual disabilities (formerly called โmental retardationโ).  \nJails are not designed to be therapeuticโthey are inherently punitiveโnor do they provide any \ntreatment aimed at restoring a person to competency or evaluation and/or treatment services for \nindividuals found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n55.  Correctional facilities, particularly facilities designed for short-term detention, do \nnot have the staffing, funding, or capabilities to provide treatment aimed at restoring a person to \ncompetency or evaluation and/or treatment services for individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 18 of 33\n56.  Detainees who are found incompetent to stand trial and detainees who are found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity are often the most severely mentally ill in Texas jail settings. \n57.  Most  Texas  jails  do  not  have  the  ability  to  provide  even  basic  psychiatric \nstabilization and management.  As a result, many detainees with serious mental illness are harmed \nby the punitive jail setting as manifested by either increased symptoms of their underlying \npsychiatric disorder or lack of improvement regarding their current symptoms.  By refusing to \ntimely take custody of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees), Defendant \nand HHSC cause such persons to be incarcerated in county jails under conditions nearly certain to \nexacerbate their mental health condition(s). \n58.  Because county jails are often unable to provide even basic mental health treatment, \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees frequently end up between a rock and a hard place: \neither they are housed in the general jail populationโoften with convicted offendersโor they are \nplaced in solitary confinement, which causes their mental health to further deteriorate.  This \ndeterioration  conflicts  with  the  Stateโs  interest  in  prompt  evaluation  and  treatment  so  that \nincompetent detainees may be brought to trial, or so that insanity acquittees are not punished for \ncrimes they were acquitted of and are appropriately committed, transferred, or released.  \n59.  Besides struggling to provide even basic mental health care, county jails in Texas \ndo not have the specific services necessary to restore individuals to competency to stand trial, such \nas the most current medications, identification of specific social needs to restore and maintain \ncompetency, and training specific to the restoration of competency.  In contrast, state mental health \nfacilities are specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment to restore incompetent detainees \nto competence, thereby enabling them to stand trial.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 19 of 33\n60.  County jails in Texas also do not have the specific services necessary to provide \nevaluation and/or treatment services to insanity acquittees.  State mental health facilities, however, \nare specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment and to conduct evaluations to make \ncomplex determinations about a personโs mental health condition(s), including whether a person \nis likely to cause serious harm to another, whether a person is subject to commitment under the \nTexas Health and Safety Code, and determinations regarding the appropriateness, safety, and \neffectiveness of prospective treatment and supervision options.  \n61.  Nevertheless,  Defendant  knowingly,  intentionally,  and  deliberately  refuses  to \naccept individuals found incompetent to stand trial and individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity into state mental health facilities in violation of the requirements of Chapters 46B and \n46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the orders of the criminal courts, and the U.S. \nConstitution.        \nD.  Defendant has failed to timely admit incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees \nwho have been ordered to a HHSC mental health facility. \n \n62.  According to a 2014 Joint Report by the National Sheriffโs Association and the \nTreatment Advocacy Center, โTexas is among the states with the lowest number of public \npsychiatric beds and among the stingiest states in per capita mental health spending.โ  \n63.  Because  HHSC  facilities  are  full,  HHSC  places  detainees  (both  incompetent \ndetainees and insanity acquittees) on a waiting list until a bed becomes available at the designated \nfacility.   \n64.  In June of 2014, the number of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees) waiting to be transferred to a state mental health facility was about 170; by February \nof 2016, the number had risen to more than 380.  By February 2016, detainees were waiting an \naverage of 41 days in local jails.  As of April 1, 2016, the longest wait time for a non-maximum \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 20 of 33\nsecurity bed was 275 daysโalmost nine months.  According to HHSC, as of April 1, 2016, the \naverage wait time for a maximum security bed was 122 days.  Currently, about 283 individuals are \nwaiting in county jails for a maximum security bed, and of those individuals, about 246 have been \nwaiting longer than 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting in jail for a maximum security \nbed the longest has been waiting about 321 days.  As for the wait list for a non-maximum security \nbed, there are currently about 96 individuals waiting in jail for such a bed, and of those 96, about \n4 have been waiting longer than 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting in jail the longest \nfor a non-maximum security bed has been waiting 34 days.   \n65.  According to a May 13, 2016 investigative report by ABC-13, state statistics going \nback to 2006 show that the number of detainees waiting in jails for competency restoration \ntreatment โhas never been this long,โ and that the number of individuals on the wait list has grown \nby โ20% in the last six months.โ   \n66.  The delay in admitting those found incompetent to stand trial infringes on their right \nto be free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction as well as the ability to receive \ncompetency-restoration treatment, which necessarily extends the time within which an individual \ncan be tried once restored to competency.   \n67.  The delay in admitting those found not guilty by reason of insanity infringes on \ntheir right to be free from incarceration after being absolved of criminal responsibility, as well as \ntheir ability to receive evaluation and treatment so that the criminal courts can reach final \ndispositions in the civil commitments.  \n68.  Because incompetent criminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime \nand insanity acquittees have been absolved of criminal responsibility, both classes of persons have \na liberty interest in freedom from incarceration, and a liberty interest in receiving treatment.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 21 of 33\nBecause the court has ordered that incompetent detainees must be provided with restorative \ntreatment and that insanity acquittees must be provided with evaluation and/or treatment services, \nlack of funds, staff, or facilities cannot justify the Defendantโs failure to provide the court-ordered \ntreatment in a timely manner. \n69.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, the Individual Plaintiffs and the \nClasses will continue to be deprived of their liberty rights without due process of law, in violation \nof their constitutional rights.   \n70.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Ward to a state \nmental health facility, and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail for 59 weeks \nbefore being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on April 4, 2017.  While in jail, Mr. \nWard did not receive competency restoration treatment.   \n71.  Mr. Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, HIV, epilepsy, asthma, \nand hypertension.  Harris County Jail staff noted that Mr. Ward has a history of neurocognitive \nimpairment.  In February 2016, during a mental health assessment, staff noted Mr. Wardโs \nconfusion and inability to remember information such as street names, location, and names of \ndoctors.  Staff noted that โcompetency restoration may be unlikely or slow based on current clinical \npresentation of the assessment.โ    \n72.  Mr. Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he has \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial.  During his recent incarceration, Mr. Ward requested, and \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 22 of 33\nvoluntarily took, his psychotropic medications; however, he continued to report command auditory \nhallucinations throughout his incarceration. \n73.  Plaintiff Michael Anderson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 299th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 18, 2016, Mr. Anderson was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Anderson to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 29 weeks before \nbeing admitted to Rusk State Hospital on November 9, 2016. Mr. Anderson did not receive \ncompetency restoration treatment in jail.  \n74.  Mr. Anderson has been diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder, an intellectual \ndisability, schizoaffective disorder, and diabetes.  He has a long history of mental illness and has \nbeen treated by the Austin Travis County Mental Health Authority since 1993.  \n75.  While incarcerated, Mr. Anderson exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related to \nhis mental illness.  Records by the Jail counselor indicated that Mr. Anderson exhibited incoherent \nthought processes and delusional content and thought processes.  As recently as June 2016, records \nshowed that Mr. Anderson urinates on himself and in his cell.  Following this incident, Mr. \nAnderson was placed in a single cell, where Jail staff were required to conduct visual checks every \n30 minutes.  \n76.  Plaintiff Isaac Lemelle is a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about March 30, 2016, Mr. Lemelle was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 23 of 33\ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lemelle to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Lemelle to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 24 weeks before \nbeing admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on September 15, 2016. Mr. Lemelle did not \nreceive competency restoration treatment in jail.   \n77.  Mr. Lemelle is diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia and other psychotic \ndisorders and antisocial personality disorder. The Travis County Jail classified his mental health \nneeds as severe. He has a long history of mental illness and was first treated by the Austin Travis \nCounty Mental Health Authority in 2008, at age thirteen.  \n78.  During  his  incarceration,  Mr.  Lemelle  exhibited  numerous  symptoms  and \nbehaviors as a result of his mental illness, including throwing urine and smearing feces, behaviors \nwhich required his placement in the Jailโs psychiatric lockdown units in a single cell.  Individuals \nin psychiatric lockdown are permitted outside of their cell in the dayroom for one hour a day.  They \nare not guaranteed any time outdoors.  Jail personnel are required to conduct visual checks every \n30 minutes.  Mr. Lemelle also required protective restraints.  \n79.  On  February  23,  2016,  while  Mr.  Lemelle  was  in  jail  waiting  to  be  found \nincompetent to stand trial, officers were notified that Mr. Lemelle stated he wanted to kill himself \nand may have swallowed a razor.  While officers were attempting to place Mr. Lemelle in a \nrestraint chair to examine his mouth for a razor, and to transport him to an isolation cell, Mr. \nLemelle spat at a corrections officer.  This incident led to the additional charge of harassment of a \npublic servant being pressed against Mr. Lemelle.  Following this incident, Mr. Lemelle was \ntransported to a Full Suicide Precautions (โFSPโ) unit, where he was placed in a rubber cell and \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 24 of 33\nprovided only a smock as clothing.  In FSP units, Jail staff are required to conduct 15 minute visual \nchecks.  Medical and psychiatric evaluations and meetings are conducted through a food chute, \ni.e., a small opening on the door of each individual cell that is used to pass food to the individuals.  \nMr.  Lemelle was also accused of approximately fifteen (15) rule violations (on four separate \noccasions) that required review by the Travis County Sheriffโs Office disciplinary board. \n80.  Plaintiff Marc Lawson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 390th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about May 11, 2016, Mr. Lawson was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lawson to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Lawson to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 10 weeks before \nbeing admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on July 20, 2017.  Mr. Lawson did not \nreceive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n81.  Mr. Lawson is twenty-two years old, has never previously been incarcerated, and \nhas been in the Texas Child Protective Services system since age five.  Mr. Lawson is diagnosed \nwith an intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder/ADHD,  Bipolar  Disorder,  Conduct  Disorder,  Antisocial  Personality  Disorder, \nEpilepsy/Seizure Disorder and Hepatitis C. Mr. Lawson has a history of treatment at psychiatric \nhospitals and utilization of medication from a young age.   \n82.  During Mr. Lawsonโs incarceration, Jail personnel reported that he had obvious \ncognitive deficits and poor social skills.  He was categorized as vulnerable, and Jail personnel \ndocumented concerns over his being housed in a cell with other inmates due to his vulnerability. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 25 of 33\nUpon his admission, Mr. Lawson was initially placed in full suicide precaution and/or psychiatric \nlockdown housing for about one week. While in psychiatric lockdown and full suicide precaution \nhousing, Mr. Lawson was permitted outside of his cell for only one hour a day, and it was not \nguaranteed that he would receive any time outdoors.  He was then transferred to and housed in a \nsingle cell for over two months. Mr. Lawson was prescribed two medications for his medical \nconditions and one antipsychotic. The Travis County Jail has classified his mental health and \nmedical needs as severe.  \n83.  Mr. Lawsonโs psychiatric evaluation from May 2016 stated that he is incompetent \nto stand trial and โcompetency cannot be restored in the foreseeable future with traditional \ncompetency restoration treatment due to the chronic nature of his condition.โ  The psychiatrist \ndocumented that although he is prescribed psychiatric medication, the medication โwill not \nimprove cognitive symptoms responsible for observed deficits relating to trial competency.โ  \n84.  Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin is a defendant in a criminal case in the 403rd Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 6, 2016, Ms. Lampkin was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nThe order also required the Sheriff to transport Ms. Lampkin to a state mental health facility.  \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Ms. \nLampkin to its state mental health facility, and, as a result, she was incarcerated in the Travis \nCounty Jail for 13 weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on July 6, \n2017.  Ms. Lampkin did not receive competency restoration treatment in jail.   \n85.  Ms. Lampkin is diagnosed with an Intellectual Disability and Bipolar Disorder. She \nalso has a history of psychosis, resulting in numerous emergency psychiatric hospitalizations.  She \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 26 of 33\nhas a long history of mental illness and has a history of being treated by Austin Travis County \nIntegral Care. \n86.  While incarcerated, Ms. Lampkin exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related to \nher mental health condition.  Records by the jail counselor indicated that Ms. Lampkin has obvious \ncognitive deficits and is low functioning.  Ms. Lampkin was exclusively been housed in psychiatric \nhousing, and in July 2016, the jail counselor reported that she is โstruggling due to isolation.โ  \nMoreover, the jail conditions affected Ms. Lampkinโs physical condition.  Over the duration of her \nincarceration, Ms. Lampkin lost over 30 lbs. \n87.  Plaintiff Cecil Adickes was a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about November 7, 2016, Mr. Adickes was found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental \nhealth facility for evaluation of his present mental condition and for treatment.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order and the 14-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nArticle 46C.160, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Adickes to a state \nmental health facility, and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 13 weeks \nbefore being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on February 9, 2017.  Mr. Adickes \ndid not and could not receive the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in jail.  \n88.  Plaintiff Michael Gibson was a defendant in a criminal case in the 427th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about September 9, 2016, Mr. Gibson was found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental \nhealth facility for evaluation of his present mental condition and for treatment.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order and the 14-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \nArticle 46C.160, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Gibson to a state mental \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 27 of 33\nhealth facility, and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 18 weeks before \nbeing admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on January 12, 2017.  Mr. Gibson did not \nand could not receive the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in jail. \n89.  Mr. Gibson has a long history of mental illness, including more than fifteen prior \nhospitalizations.  He is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and drug induced \npsychosis.  \n90.  Plaintiff Kenneth Jones is a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Harris County, Texas. On or about August 10, 2017, Mr. Jones was found \nincompetent to stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC has not allowed Harris County to transfer Mr. Jones to \na state mental health facility, and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Harris County \nJail. Mr. Jones does not receive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n91.  Mr. Jones has a long psychiatric history and has been diagnosed with bipolar \ndisorder  and  PTSD.  During  this  recent  incarceration,  Mr.  Jones  requested,  and  currently \nvoluntarily takes, his psychotropic medications; however, in May of 2017, he reported that his \nmedication was not working and that he had become suicidal.  Mr. Jonesโ medications were \nadjusted, but he continues to report visual hallucinations and delusions as recently as August of \n2017.  Mr. Jones has also had several altercations with other inmates resulting in three disciplinary \ncharges. \n92.  Plaintiff Mary Sapp was a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about May 23, 2017, Ms. Sapp was found not guilty by \nreason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental health facility \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 28 of 33\nfor evaluation of her present mental condition and for treatment. Despite the criminal courtโs order \nand the 14-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46C.160, HHSC \nhas not allowed Harris County to transfer Ms. Sapp to a state mental health facility, and, as a result, \nshe continues to be incarcerated in the Harris County Jail. Ms. Sapp has not and cannot receive the \ncourt-ordered evaluation and treatment in jail. \n93.  Ms. Sapp is sixty-seven years old and has been diagnosed with schizoaffective \ndisorder, COPD, diabetes, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, asthma, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and \nspinal degeneration. Ms. Sapp had previously been found incompetent to stand trial on this charge \nand  spent  seven  months  at  North  Texas  State  Hospital-Vernon  for  competency  restoration \ntreatment.  Prior to being incarcerated, Ms. Sapp was receiving outpatient psychiatric services.  \nMs. Sapp has had a number of falls while incarcerated at Harris County Jail and was even sent to \nthe infirmary in April of 2017 due to her inability to care for her own activities of daily living.   \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \nA.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Incompetent Detainees Rights \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \n94.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 93 above are incorporated \nherein. \n95.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n96.  Criminal defendants who have not been convicted and have been adjudicated \nincompetent to stand trial have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and in receiving \ncompetency restoration treatment. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 29 of 33\n97.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n98.  Once an individual is found unable to aid and assist in their own defense, all \ncriminal  proceedings  must  stop,  thus  eliminating  punishment  as  a  lawful  purpose  for  their \nincarceration.  The only stated lawful purpose for their continued confinement is commitment to \nthe Defendantโs facility where they are to be provided restorative treatment so as to return him or \nher to competency. \n99.  County jails do not provide the restorative treatment required by state law. \n100.  No legitimate state interest justifies the continued incarceration of incompetent \ncriminal  defendants  in  county  jails  for  months  on  end.    The  nature  and  duration  of  their \nincarceration bear no reasonable relation to the restorative purpose for which the court has \ncommitted these individuals. \n101.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of incompetent detainees \nare entitled to an order of the Court declaring that, by requiring persons found incompetent to stand \ntrial to remain in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to provide restorative treatment \nin a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n102.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members found incompetent to stand trial.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other Class members are therefore entitled to an order of the Court enjoining Defendant \nfrom further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation to their continued \nincarceration in jail while awaiting a bed at a HHSC mental health facility where they can receive \nthe state-mandated restorative treatment.   \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 30 of 33\nB.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Insanity Acquitteesโ Rights Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \n103.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 102 above are incorporated \nherein. \n104.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n105.  Persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, and thereby acquitted \nof criminal charges, have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and in receiving court-\nordered evaluation and/or treatment services. \n106.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n107.  Once an individual is found not guilty by reason of insanity, they have been \nacquitted of the offense charged and cannot remain incarcerated.  The only stated lawful purpose \nfor their continued confinement is commitment to a HHSC facility where they are to be provided \nevaluation and treatment services for the personโs present mental condition, which will enable the \ncourt to reach final disposition. \n108.  County jails do not have the resources or expertise to provide the evaluation and/or \ntreatment services mandated by state law. \n109.  No legitimate state interest justifies the incarceration of insanity acquittees in \ncounty jails for months on end.  The nature and duration of their incarceration bear no reasonable \nrelation to the evaluation and/or treatment purpose for which the court has committed insanity \nacquittees. \n110.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are \nentitled to  an order of  the Court declaring that, by requiring insanity  acquittees to  remain \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 59   Filed 09/29/17   Page 31 of 33\nincarcerated in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to provide evaluation and/or \ntreatment in a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n111.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are therefore entitled to an order of the \nCourt enjoining Defendant from further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation \nto their continued confinement while awaiting evaluation and/or treatment at a HHSC mental \nhealth facility.   \nATTORNEYโS FEES \n112.  Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneyโs fees, costs, and expenses pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE: Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to: \nA.  Appoint newly named Plaintiffs as class representatives; \nB.  Enter an Order declaring that, by requiring defendants found incompetent to stand \ntrial  to remain incarcerated in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to \nprovide restorative treatment services for incompetent detainees, Defendant is \ndepriving Plaintiffs and Class Members of their due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nC.

Issue  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  restraining  Defendant  from \nviolating the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in relation \nto the confinement of individuals awaiting competency restoration treatment and \nthe confinement of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity and awaiting \nevaluation and/or treatment services; \nE.

R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not \nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH \nCIR. R. 47.5.4. \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 2     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 3 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \n(โDefendantโ)1 challenges on appeal the propriety of the class certification \norder issued by the district court.  In its order, the district court certified two \nclasses of plaintiffsโone including individuals charged with Texas crimes but \nadjudged to be incompetent to stand trial under Texas law; and the other \nincluding individuals acquitted of Texas crimes because they were determined \nto be insane under Texas law.  Because the district court failed to conduct a \nsufficiently rigorous analysis of whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)โs \nrequirements are met, its class certification order is deficient.  Accordingly, we \nvacate the class certification order and remand to the district court for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  \nBACKGROUND \nUnder Texas law, criminal defendants adjudged incompetent to stand \ntrial2 and individuals acquitted of crimes by reason of insanity3 may, under \ncertain  circumstances  specified  by  statute,  be  committed  to  facilities  for \n                                         \n1 On September 29, 2017, while Defendantโs request under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the district courtโs class certification order was \npending, the named plaintiffs in this matter filed their third amended complaint, which, \namong  other  things,  substituted  Charles  Smith,  in  his  official  capacity  as  Executive \nCommissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (โHHSCโ), as the \ndefendant.  This was due to a reorganization of the Stateโs health and human services system \nthat granted control of state hospitals to HHSC on September 1, 2017.  See TEX. GOVโT CODE \nยงยง 531.001(2), 531.0011(a)(2), 531.0201(a)(2)(C); TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE ยงยง 1001.004, \n1001.072. \n2 A criminal defendant is considered incompetent to stand trial under Texas law if he \nor she does not have โsufficient present ability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a \nreasonable degree of rational understandingโ or โa rational as well as factual understanding \nof the proceedings against the person.โ  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 46B.003(a)(1)&(2) \n(West 2004). \n3 An individual charged with a crime is considered not guilty of that crime by reason \nof insanity if:  โ(1) the prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged \nconduct constituting the offense was committed; and (2) the defense has established by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged \nconduct.โ  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 46C.153(a) (West 2004).  A criminal defendant \nwho is found not guilty by reason of insanity โstands acquitted of the offense charged and \nmay not be considered a person charged with an offense.โ  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. \n46C.155(a) (West 2004).   \n2 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 3     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 4 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \ninpatient  mental  health  treatment,  restoration  services,  evaluation  and/or \nobservation.4  The State of Texas does not have enough beds in its hospitals, \nwhich generally operate at full capacity, to accommodate at once all persons \nwho  have  been  committed  for  inpatient  services.5    To  equitably  allocate \navailable hospital beds, the State generally uses a โfirst-come, first-servedโ \napproach.  Individuals who are awaiting admission to a state hospital are \ngenerally  detained  in  county  jails  pending  their  transfer,6  sometimes  for \nmonths.7   \n                                         \n4 See e.g., TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. arts. 46B.071, 46B.073 (West 2004); TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. ANN. arts. 46C.201, 46C.251, 46C.256, 46C.261 (West 2005). \n5 According to the uncontradicted declaration of Timothy E. Bray, the Director of State \nHospitals for the Texas Department of State Health Services at the time this suit was filed, \nTexas has nine state hospitals that offer inpatient services to criminal defendants found \nincompetent to stand trial and individuals acquitted of criminal charges on insanity grounds.  \nSuch hospitals also serve individuals who are civilly committed for services and persons who \nadmit themselves voluntarily.  Those hospitals are funded to operate 2,385 inpatient beds.  \nTwo of the hospitals are equipped as maximum security units (โMSUโ) and operate a total of \n314 inpatient beds.  The State contracts with two private psychiatric hospitals for competency \nrestoration services, which provide an additional 114 beds.  \n6 Texas law does not specifically address under all circumstances where and for how \nlong to hold incompetent criminal defendants and individuals acquitted of criminal charges \non insanity grounds pending transfer to an inpatient mental health facility.  However, Texas \nlaw  does  require  a  court  that  commits  a  criminal  defendant  for  inpatient  competency \nrestoration to place that defendant โin the custody of the sheriff or sheriffโs deputy for \ntransportation to the facility or program.โ  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 46B.075 (West \n2004).  Texas courts are also specifically allowed to order individuals acquitted of crimes by \nreason of insanity detained in jail or another โsuitable placeโ for up to 14 days pending further \nproceedings.  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 46C.160 (West 2005).  Additionally, with \nrespect to a โnon-dangerousโ individual acquitted due to insanity, if there is evidence to \nsupport a finding of mental illness or mental retardation, then a Texas court may order such \nperson  detained  in  jail  or  another  โsuitable  placeโ  pending  โprompt  initiation  and \nprosecutionโ of required civil commitment proceedings.  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. \n46C.201 (West 2005). \n7 In 2017, the average wait time for incompetent criminal defendants and insanity \nacquittees to be transferred from a county jail to a non-MSU hospital was 16 days, while the \naverage wait time for transfer into an MSU hospital was 147 days.   \n3 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 4     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 5 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nJoseph  Ward,  Michael  Anderson,  and  Isaac  Lemelle,  the  original \nplaintiffs in this 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 suit,8 amended their complaint twice, adding \nMarc  Lawson,  Jennifer  Lampkin,  Cecil  Adickes,  and  Michael  Gibson  as \nplaintiffs.9  (Each of the foregoing individuals shall be collectively referred to \nherein  as  โPlaintiffs.โ)    In  Plaintiffsโ  second  amended  complaint,  Ward, \nAnderson, Lemelle, Lawson and Lampkin allege that, though they had been \nordered committed  for inpatient competency restoration  services  by Texas \ncourts, they had been detained in county jails awaiting admission to state \nhospitals for periods ranging from 15 to 27 weeks.  Adickes and Gibson allege \nthat, though they had been acquitted of criminal charges by reason of insanity \nand  ordered  committed  to  maximum  security  unit  (โMSUโ)  facilities  for \nevaluation and treatment, they had been detained in county jails awaiting \nadmission  to  such  facilities  for  two  weeks  and  ten  weeks,  respectively.  \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendant has violated their Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights by confining them in county jails for unreasonable periods of \ntime  without  criminal  convictions  and  failing  to  provide  them  with  the \nappropriate mental health treatment and/or services during their confinement.  \nThey have further requested that the court certify two classes of similarly \nsituated plaintiffs; issue an order declaring that Defendant has violated their \nFourteenth  Amendment  due  process  rights;  and  issue  preliminary  and \npermanent injunctive relief prohibiting Defendant from violating such rights. \nOn  November  28,  2016,  Plaintiffs  moved  for  class  certification.  \nDefendant initially opposed Plaintiffsโ motion under Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure (โRule 23โ).

On August \n17, 2017, Defendant filed an โAdvisory to the Courtโ indicating that Plaintiffsโ \nclaims were moot since each of them had been admitted to state hospitals and \nthat, because no class had yet been certified, the class claims were also moot.  \nPlaintiffs disagreed, asserting that the โinherently transitoryโ nature of their \nclaims saved them from mootness.  Plaintiffs further offered to provide the \ndistrict court with briefing on this argument or, alternatively, amend their \ncomplaint to add new plaintiffs who were still being detained in county jails.  \nId.  Without responding to Plaintiffsโ request for guidance on how to proceed, \non September 1, 2017, over nine months after Plaintiffs filed their motion for \nclass certification, the district court entered an order purporting to certify the \nfollowing two classes of plaintiffs: \n(1) All persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with \na crime in the State of Texas, and (a) who are ordered to a Texas \nDepartment of State Health Services facility where they are to \nreceive competency[]restoration services; and (b) for whom the \nTexas Department of State Health Services receives the court \norder;  but  (c)  who  remain  detained  in  a  Texas  county  jail \n[(โIncompetent Detainee(s)โ)];10 and \n \n(2) All persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with \na crime in the State of Texas and who are found not guilty by \nreason  of  insanity,  and  (a)  who  are  ordered  to  receive \nevaluation-and-treatment services at a Texas Department of \nState  Health  Services  facility;  (b)  for  whom  the  Texas \nDepartment of State Health Services receives the court order; \nbut (c) who remain detained in a Texas county jail for more than \n14 days [(โInsanity Acquittee(s)โ)]. \n                                         \n10 In addition to challenging the district courtโs class certification order on Rule 23 \ngrounds, Defendant argues on appeal that the district court lacked jurisdiction to certify the \nIncompetent Detainee class because such class includes individuals who lack standing to \nassert claims in this matter.  We need not reach the merits of such argument since we vacate \nthe class certification order on other grounds.   \n5 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 6     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 7 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \n \nThe district court did not, however, explicitly appoint the named plaintiffs as \nclass  representatives  as  they  had  requested.    Instead,  the  court  ordered \nPlaintiffs to file yet another amended complaint including โnamed plaintiffs to \nbe appointed as class representatives for the two classes.โ     \nOn  September  29,  2017,  while  Defendantโs  Rule  23(f)  request  for \npermission to appeal the district courtโs class certification order was pending, \nPlaintiffs  filed  their  third  amended  complaint,  in  which  they  added  the \nfollowing named plaintiffs:  Kenneth Jones, a criminal defendant adjudged to \nbe incompetent to withstand trial; and Mary Sapp, who had been acquitted of \ncriminal charges due to insanity.11  On October 17, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a \nmotion requesting that the district court appoint not only Jones and Sapp as \nclass representatives, but also Lawson, Lampkin, Adickes, and Gibson, which \nDefendant opposed.  On the same date, Defendant requested that the district \ncourt  stay  proceedings  pending  his  appeal  of  the  class  certification  order.  \nPlaintiffs agreed to the stay request with the โunderstanding . . . that the Court \nshould  rule  on  Plaintiffsโ  Motion  to  Appoint  Class  Representatives  before \nruling on [the] motion for stay.โ  On November 2, 2017, without ruling on \nPlaintiffsโ motion to appoint class representatives, the district court entered an \norder staying all proceedings.   \nWhile Defendant appeals the district courtโs class certification order on \nmultiple grounds, his primary arguments are that (1) the district court lacked \njurisdiction to enter its class certification order because Plaintiffsโ claims, and \ntherefore, this entire action, became moot prior to the district court entering \nsuch order; and (2) even if this case is not moot, the district courtโs class \ncertification order is deficient under Rule 23.  For the reasons set forth below, \n                                         \n11 In the third amended complaint, the original named plaintiffs also acknowledged \nthat they had all been admitted to state hospitals. \n6 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 7     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 8 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nwe  reject  Defendantโs  mootness  argument  and  vacate  the  district  courtโs \ncertification order on Rule 23 grounds.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nMootness  and  standing  are  issues  of  law  that  we  review  de  novo.  \nFontenot v. McCraw, 777 F.3d 741, 746 (5th Cir. 2015).  Likewise, โwhether the \ndistrict  court  applied  the  correct  legal  standardsโ  in  certifying  a  class  is \nreviewed de novo.  M.D. ex rel. Stukenberg v. Perry, 675 F.3d 832, 836 (5th Cir. \n2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  If the district court has \napplied the correct legal  standard,  we then review its  analysis and order \ncertifying a class for an abuse of discretion.  Id.  โA trial court abuses its \ndiscretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly \nerroneous assessment of the evidence.โ  Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, 359 (5th \nCir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Thus, if the district \ncourtโs โaccount of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its \nentirety,โ we may  not reverse.   Id.  at 363 (internal quotation  marks and \ncitation omitted).  This deference is a result of โthe essentially factual basis of \nthe certification inquiry and of the district court's inherent power to manage \nand control pending litigation.โ  Id. at 360 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). \nDISCUSSION \nMootness \na.  General Mootness Rule \nGiven that mootness is a jurisdictional inquiry,12 we preliminarily turn \nour  attention  to  Defendantโs  mootness  argument.    As  a  general  rule,  โa \n                                         \n12 See U.S. v. Sanchez-Gomez, 138 S. Ct. 1532, 1537 (2018) (acknowledging that โ[a] \ncase  that  becomes  moot  at  any  point  during  the  proceedings  is  no  longer  a  โCaseโ  or \nโControversyโ for purposes of Article III, and is outside the jurisdiction of the federal courtsโ  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). \n7 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 8     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 9 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \npurported class action becomes moot when the personal claims of all named \nplaintiffsโ have been satisfied prior to certification of a class, since, under such \ncircumstances, there is no longer an Article III โcase or controversyโ for the \ncourt to resolve.  Murray v. Fid. Natโl Fin., Inc., 594 F.3d 419, 421 (5th Cir. \n2010) (internal citations omitted); see also Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402 \n(1975) (noting that โ[t]here must . . . be a named plaintiff who has [an Article \nIII] case or controversy at the time the complaint is filedโ and โat the time the \nclass  is  certified  by  the  [d]istrict  [c]ourt,โ  as  well  as  on  review).13    It  is \nundisputed that each of the Plaintiffs were transferred from county jails to \nstate hospitals at least 6 weeks prior to the district court entering its class \ncertification order.  Considering Plaintiffsโ allegations and the relief requested, \neach Plaintiffโs claim seemingly was satisfied upon his or her transfer.  Thus, \nunless Plaintiffsโ claims fall within an exception to the general rule, this matter \nbecame moot on July 20, 2017 when the last Plaintiff remaining in a county \njail was transferred to a state hospital.  \nb.  Inherently Transitory Exception to Mootness \nPotential class actions involving claims that are โinherently transitoryโ \nfall within an exception to the general mootness rule, since such claims would \notherwise likely evade review.  See Genesis Healthcare v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. \n66, 76 (2013) (quoting Cty. of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52 (1991)) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Indeed, in these cases it is \nlikely that โthe trial court will not have even enough time to rule on a motion \nfor class certification before the proposed representativeโs individual interest \nexpires.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Therefore, in \n                                         \n13 Where, however, the named plaintiffโs claims become moot after a class has been \nproperly certified in a matter, the expiration of the named plaintiffโs claims does not have the \neffect of mooting the entire action since โthe class of unnamed persons described in the \ncertification acquired a legal status separate from the interest asserted by [the named \nplaintiff].โ  Sosna, 419 U.S. at 399. \n8 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 9     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 10 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \ncases involving such claims, a class certification order is deemed to relate back \nto the time of the filing of the original complaint.  See McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at \n52 (citing Swisher v. Brady, 438 U.S. 204, 213-214, n.11 (1978)).   \nWhile neither the Supreme Court nor this court has provided detailed \nguidance as to what makes a claim โinherently transitory,โ Supreme Court \njurisprudence  suggests  that  the  following  factors  are  pertinent  to  such  a \ndetermination:  the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim is of a fleeting \nor temporary nature; uncertainty exists at the outset as to the duration of each \nplaintiffโs exposure to the allegedly harmful conduct; it is unlikely that any \ngiven individual plaintiff could see his claim to fruition prior to the claim \nbecoming moot; and there exists a constant group of people suffering the harm \nalleged by the plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Genesis Healthcare, 569 U.S. at 76; Gerstein \nv. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110, n.11 (1975).   \nConsidering the foregoing, as well as the application of the doctrine by \nother courts in the prison context,14 we believe that Plaintiffsโ claims in this \ncase qualify as โinherently transitory.โ  First, the putative plaintiffsโ allegedly \nunlawful detention is of a fleeting or temporary nature, lasting anywhere from \ndays to months.  Additionally, there is uncertainty at the inception of each \n                                         \n14  See, e.g., Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 110, n.11 (finding that the claims of pretrial detainees \nwho argued that they were entitled to a probable cause hearing โbelong[] . . . to that narrow \nclass of cases in which the termination of a class representativeโs claim does not moot the \nclaims of the unnamed members of the classโ); Amador v. Andrews, 655 F.3d 89, 100-01 (2d \nCir. 2011) (recognizing that โ[w]hether claims are inherently transitory is an inquiry that \nmust be made with reference to the claims of the class as a whole as opposed to any one \nindividual claim for reliefโ and finding the claims of the plaintiffs, female inmates in New \nYork prisons, to be inherently transitory given that โthe odds of a[ plaintiff] being able to \ncomplete  the  [stateโs]  grievance  procedure  [with  respect  to  a  sexual  assault  and/or \nharassment claim] and litigate a class action while still incarcerated [were] rather smallโ); \nOlson v. v. Brown, 594 F.3d 577, 583 (7th Cir. 2010) (emphasizing that the named plaintiff \nwho was an inmate at a temporary detention center โdid not know when his claim would \nbecome  mootโ  since  โ[t]he  duration  of  his  claim  was  at  the  discretion  of  the  [state] \n[d]epartment of [c]orrectionโ).   \n \n9 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 10     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 11 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \npotential plaintiffโs claim regarding how long he or she will remain detained in \na county jail prior to being transferred to a state hospital.  Thus, although there \nare potential class members whose claims would not expire within the time it \nwould take to obtain a class certification order, there is no way for Plaintiffs to \nensure  that  any  named  plaintiff  added  to  their  complaint  will  be  that \nindividual.  Additionally, even if an individual plaintiff were to maintain a live \nclaim at the time of class certification, it is highly unlikely that such plaintiffโs \nclaims would remain live throughout the entirety of this lawsuit.  Finally, \nregardless of the status of any individual named plaintiffโs claim, there exists \na constant group of people being subjected to Defendantโs โfirst-come, first-\nservedโ policy complained of by Plaintiffs.  Indeed, by way of analogy, such \npolicy operates similarly to a revolving door.  These characteristics of Plaintiffsโ \nclaims make them likely to evade review if they do not fall within an exception \nto the general mootness rule.  See Genesis, 569 U.S. at 76.  \nBecause of the inherently transitory nature of the claims in this matter, \nthe expiration of all of Plaintiffsโ claims prior to the district court entering its \nclass certification order did not have the effect of mooting this action as a \nwhole.  Moreover, should the district court find it appropriate on remand to \ncertify one or more classes of plaintiffs, its certification order would relate back \nto the filing of Plaintiffsโ complaint.  See McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 52 (citing \nSwisher,  438  U.S.  at  213-214,  n.11).    In  so  finding,  we  acknowledge  the \nnarrowness of the inherently transitory exception15 but also recognize the \nโflexible character of the [Article] III mootness doctrine.โ  U.S. Parole Commโn \nv. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 400 (1980). \n \n                                         \n15 See Rocky v. King, 900 F.2d 864, 870 (5th Cir. 1990) (recognizing the narrow scope \nof the inherently transitory exception). \n10 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 11     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 12 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nRule 23 \nHaving satisfied ourselves of both our and the district courtโs jurisdiction \nover this matter, we now turn to the propriety of the district courtโs class \ncertification order from a procedural standpoint.  To obtain class certification, \nparties must satisfy the following Rule 23(a) requirements:  (1) numerosityโ\nโthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticableโ; (2) \ncommonalityโโthere are questions of law or fact common to the classโ; (3) \ntypicalityโโthe claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of \nthe claims or defenses of the classโ; and (4) adequacy of representationโโthe \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass.โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a); see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. \n338, 345 (2011); Ibe v. Jones, 836 F.3d 516, 528 (5th Cir. 2016).  In addition to \neach of the Rule 23(a) requirements, one Rule 23(b) requirement must be met \nfor a class to be certified.  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b); Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 345.  \nHere, Plaintiffs sought certification under Rule 23(b)(2), which is satisfied if \nโthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally  to  the  class,  so  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  FED. R. CIV. \nP. 23(b)(2).   \n  A party seeking class certification has the burden of establishing that all \nof Rule 23โs requirements are met.  See Ibe, 836 F.3d at 528 (internal citation \nomitted); see also Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 (noting that โRule 23 does not set \nforth a mere pleading standardโ and that โ[a] party seeking class certification \nmust affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Ruleโ).  Thus, such a \nparty must โbe prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous \nparties, common questions of law or fact, typicality of claims or defenses, and \nadequacy  of  representationโ  and  to  satisfy  at  least  one  of  Rule  23(b)โs \n11 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 12     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 13 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nprovisions โthrough evidentiary proof.โ  Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. \n27, 33 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \nAdditionally, before certifying a class, a district court โmust conduct a \nrigorous analysis of the Rule 23 prerequisites,โ which requires it to โlook \nbeyond the pleadings to understand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and \napplicable substantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the \ncertification issues.โ  Yates, 868 F.3d at 362 (quoting Perry, 675 F.3d at 837 \nand Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350-51) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  In light of this imperative, this court has held that โwhen certifying \na class a district court must detail with sufficient specificity how the plaintiff \nhas met the requirements of Rule 23.โ  Vizena v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 360 F.3d \n496, 503 (2004).  Notably, the obligation of a district court to conduct a rigorous \nanalysis  of  Rule  23โs  requirements,  as  evidenced  by  written  reasons  for \ncertification, is not dispensed with by the partiesโ stipulation to certification or \nfailure to contest one or more of Rule 23โs requirements, since โthe court [is] \nbound to conduct its own thorough . . . inquiry.โ  Stirman v. Exxon Corp., 280 \nF.3d 554, 563 n.7 (2002) (emphasis added).  Such independent analysis is \nnecessary to โprotect unknown or unnamed potential class members [who], . . \n. by definition . . . do not and cannot participate in any stipulations concocted \nby the named parties.โ  Id.

We agree. \na.  Rule 23(a) \n1.  Commonality \n  To satisfy Rule 23(a)โs commonality requirement, โthe putative class \nmembersโ claims must depend upon a common contention,โ which โmust be of \nsuch a nature that it is capable of class-wide resolution.โ  Yates, 868 F.3d at \n361 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nIn other words, determining whether such โcommon contentionโ is true or false \nmust allow for โresol[ution of] an issue that is central to the validity of each \n                                         \n16  Though  Defendant  does  not  challenge  satisfaction  of  Rule  23(a)โs  numerosity \nrequirement on appeal, we are compelled to point out the inadequacy of the district courtโs \nnumerosity analysis, which was contained within a footnote of its class certification order.  \nSpecifically, the district court stated that โHellerstedt does not challenge the requirement[] \nof numerosityโ and that, โ[h]aving reviewed the pleadings and all supporting evidence \npresented by the parties,โ it concluded that โPlaintiffs[] have met the burden of establishing \nnumerosity.โ  While we make no comment as to whether numerosity in fact exists in this \ncase, we note that the district courtโs superficial discussion demonstrates that it did not \nundertake the necessary โrigorous analysisโ of such requirement to independently confirm \nits fulfilment.  See Yates, 868 F.3d at 362 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); \nsee also Vizena, 360 F.3d at 503 (recognizing that district courts must state in detail how each \nof the Rule 23 requirements are met); Stirman, 280 F.3d at 563, n.7 (acknowledging the \nobligation of district courts to independently analyze each of the Rule 23 requirements).  \nWhile  a  lengthy  discussion  regarding  numerosity  was  likely  not  necessary  given  the \nDefendantโs apparent concession on this point, the district court was obliged at a minimum \nto identify the approximate number of potential class members in this matter and other \nfactors, if any, that bear on a determination of numerosity, as well as to explain the effect of \nthose factors on its conclusion.  See Ibe, 836 F.3d at 528 (recognizing that to establish \nnumerosity, โ[a] plaintiff must ordinarily demonstrate some evidence or reasonable estimate \nof the number of purported class membersโ and that such factors as โgeographical dispersion \nof the class, the ease with which class members may be identified, the nature of the action, \nand the size of each plaintiffโs claimโ may be relevant to a numerosity analysis) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted)).  It erred in failing to do so. \n13 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 14     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 15 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \none of the claims in one stroke.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).    Accordingly,  what  is  significant  with  respect  to  a  commonality \ndetermination is โnot the raising of common questionsโeven in drovesโbut, \nrather the capacity of a class-wide proceeding to generate common answers apt \nto drive the resolution of the litigation.โ  Id. (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  Indeed, a single common question of law or fact is sufficient \nif it meets the foregoing criteria.  Ibe, 836 F.3d at 528 (citing Wal-Mart, 564 \nU.S. at 350).  Further, to establish commonality, the plaintiff(s) must show \nthat โthe class members have suffered the same injury.โ  Id. (quoting Wal-\nMart, 564 U.S. at 349) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  While \nthe term โinjuryโ is generally tied to the concept of damages, this court has \nrecognized that โan instance of injurious conduct, which would usually relate \nmore directly to the defendantโs liability . . . , may constitute โthe same injuryโโ \nfor purposes of commonality.  In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d 790, 810-11 \n(5th Cir. 2014).  Thus, commonality may exist even where the plaintiffsโ alleged \ndamages are diverse.  Id. \n  The  district  courtโs  discussion  of  whether  the  requirement  of \ncommonality is satisfied in this case includes excerpts from various federal \ncourt cases and an acknowledgement that it had โreviewed the pleadings and \nall supporting evidence in this case[] and look[ed] beyond the pleadings to \nunderstand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable substantive \nlaw.โ  With no further stated analysis, the court concluded that Plaintiffs have \nsatisfied the commonality requirement by asserting the following common \nquestions of fact in this case:   \nwhether incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees who are \ncommitted  to  the  custody  of  Hellerstedtโs  Department  for \nrestoration  of  their  mental  capacity  so  they  may  be  tried  or \ncommitted for evaluation to determine if they can continue to be \nconfined, spend extended periods of time in county jails without \n14 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 15     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 16 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nreceiving restoration or evaluation services; and, if so, whether \nHellerstedt uses a policy or procedure to ensure that any resulting \ndelay in the implementation of such services and the place and \nmanner in the implementation of those services are the product of \nthe judgment rendered by a qualified professional.   \n \nThe Court further found that โ[t]he answers to these questions of fact may \nimplicate a common question of law,โ namely:  \nwhether Hellerstedt violates the substantive due[]process rights of \nincompetent  detainees  and  insanity  acquittees  to  be  free  from \nconditions  or  restrictions  of  confinement  that  amount  to \npunishment  absent  criminal  conviction  by  keeping  such \nindividuals in county jail for extended periods of time while they \nwait to receive restoration and evaluation services that are the \nproduct of professional judgment. \n \n  Notably, however, the district court did not explain at all, much less with \nspecificity, how the determination of such questions would โresolve an issue \nthat is central to the validity of each one of the [putative class memberโs] claims \nin one stroke.โ  Yates, 868 F.3d at 361 (quoting Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Perry, 675 F.3d at 841 (finding \nerror  in  the  district  courtโs  failure  to  explain  why  the  common  questions \nidentified were sufficient); Vizena, 360 F.3d at 503.  Moreover, it is difficult to \nappreciate from a plain reading of the common questions identified by the \ndistrict court how such questions are even capable of being resolved on a class-\nwide basis.   The district courtโs use of the phrase โextended periods of timeโ \nas an integral part of its stated common questions is particularly problematic, \nas such phrase is ambiguous.  Not only is it unclear what period of time the \ndistrict court considers to be โextended,โ but also whether a time period is \nโextendedโ could vary in different circumstances.17   \n                                         \n17 We also note, incidentally, that the common questions identified by the district court \ncontain no specific reference to the โfirst-come, first-servedโ policy to which Plaintiffs contend \nall purported class members are subject.  This is puzzling given that, as we understand \n15 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 16     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 17 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nThe district courtโs failure to substantively address actual or potential \ndifferences in purported class membersโ individual circumstances and claims \nis  also  troublesome,  since  considering  dissimilarities  among  claimants  is \nessential to determining whether even a single common question exists.18  See \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 358.  While we do not take a position at this juncture on \nwhether critical disparities among putative plaintiffs exist here, we note that \nit is incumbent on the district court to consider and discuss the facts of this \ncase, as well as the elements of Plaintiffsโ claims, prior to rejecting Defendantโs \nargument  that  dissimilarities  among  individual  claimants  obviate \ncommonality.  See Perry, 675 F.3d at 843-44 (stating that where a district court \nrejects an argument that the merits of each purported class memberโs claims \ninvolve individualized inquiries that defeat commonality, it โmust do so with \nreference to the elements and defenses and requisite proof for each of the \nproposed class claimsโ).   \nConsidering the foregoing, although we recognize that adequate common \nquestions of law or fact may well exist in this case, we find that the district \ncourt failed to conduct the necessary rigorous analysis to properly determine \nwhether the requirement of commonality is satisfied and further that the \ncommon questions identified by the district court, as currently worded, are \ninsufficient to establish commonality.  \n2.  Typicality and Adequacy of Representation \nThe  Rule  23(a)  requirements  of  typicality  and  adequacy  of \nrepresentation are โclosely relatedโ in that โdemanding typicality on the part \n                                         \nPlaintiffsโ allegations, it is such commonly applied policy and its effects that Plaintiffs \nchallenge. \n18  In  its  class  certification  order,  the  district  courtโs  treatment  of  Defendantโs \nargument in this regard was limited to quoting portions of cases from various federal courts \nthat indicate that the presence of some variations among class members does not necessarily \nrender class certification inappropriate.   \n16 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 17     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 18 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nof the representative helps ensure his adequacy as a representative.โ  Horton \nv. Goose Creek Indep. Sch. Dist., 690 F.2d 470, 485 n.27 (5th Cir. 1982).  To \ndemonstrate  typicality,  the  parties  seeking  certification  need  not  show  โa \ncomplete identity of claims.โ  Stirman, 280 F.3d at 562 (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted); see also FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(3).  Rather, โthe \ncritical inquiry is whether the class representativeโs claims have the same \nessential characteristics of those of the putative class.โ  Id.  Moreover, the \ntypicality inquiry is not concerned so much with the โstrengths of the named \nand unnamed plaintiffsโ casesโ as with the โsimilarity of legal and remedial \ntheories behind their claims.โ  Ibe, 836 F.3d at 528-29 (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  Thus, if the claims of the named plaintiffs and \nputative class members โarise from a similar course of conduct and share the \nsame  legal  theory,โ  typicality  will  not  be  defeated  by  factual  differences.  \nStirman, 280 F.3d at 562 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n Adequacy, in the Rule 23(a) context, concerns โclass representatives, \ntheir counsel, and the relationship between the two.โ  Stirman, 280 F.3d at 563 \n(quoting Berger v. Compaq Comput. Corp., 257 F.3d 475, 479 (5th Cir. 2001)) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  More specifically, adequacy encompasses \nthe  following  three  inquiries:    โ(1)  the  zeal  and  competence  of  the \nrepresentativesโ counsel; (2) the willingness and ability of the representatives \nto take an active role in and control the litigation and to protect the interests \nof  absentees;  and  (3)  the  risk  of  conflicts  of  interest  between  the  named \nplaintiffs and the class they seek to represent.โ  Slade v. Progressive Sec. Ins. \nCo., 856 F.3d 408, 412 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., \n429 F.3d 125, 130 (5th Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  Since โabsent class members are conclusively bound by the judgment \nin any class action brought on their behalf, the court must be especially vigilant \nto ensure that the due process rights of all class members are safeguarded \n17 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 18     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 19 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nthrough adequate representation at all times.โ  Berger, 257 F.3d at 480 (citing \nPhillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985)).  Thus, to satisfy \nthe adequacy of representation requirement, โthe class representatives [must] \npossess a sufficient level of knowledge and understanding to be capable of \nโcontrollingโ or โprosecutingโ the litigation.โ  Ibe, 836 F.3d at 529 (quoting \nBerger, 257 F.3d at 482-83) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n  As with numerosity, the district court conducted no analysis regarding \ntypicality  or  adequacy  of  representation,  noting  that  Defendant  had  not \nchallenged such requirements.  Nevertheless, the court indicated that it โ[had] \nreviewed the pleadings and all supporting evidence presented by the partiesโ \nand concluded that โPlaintiffs[] have met the burden of establishingโ typicality \nand adequacy of representation.  That the court found these requirements \nsatisfied is concerning given that it did not explicitly certify or recognize any \nparticular class representatives in its class certification order.  Rather, the \ncourt ordered Plaintiffs to โfile an amended complaint on or before October 2, \n2017,  which  shall  include  named  plaintiffs  to  be  appointed  as  class \nrepresentatives for the two classes.โ19         \nPlaintiffs maintain that โ[b]ecause commonality is satisfied in this case \n. . . the district courtโs order effectively found that any class memberโs claims \nwould be typical of all other class members.โ  Similarly, they contend that \nโ[b]ecause  all  class  members  are  alleging  that  Defendantโs  same  common \n                                         \n19 The district court presumably took such action because the named plaintiffs had \neach been transferred to state hospitals at the time the district court ruled on Plaintiffsโ \nmotion for class certification.  We acknowledge that the brief duration of the purported class \nclaims may throw some complexity into the district courtโs Rule 23(a) analysis.  This, \nhowever, does not excuse the court from conducting such analysis with respect to specific \nclass representatives identified by the court.  While a purported class claimโs inherently \ntransitory nature may save it from mootness, we are aware of no authority suggesting that \nthis characteristic absolves such claim or the action that encompasses it from full compliance \nwith Rule 23(a). \n18 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 19     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 20 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \npolicy results in unconstitutional detention, the district court necessarily found \nthat any of them can adequately represent the interests of the class.โ  Such \narguments are without merit.  While we recognize that there often is overlap \namong  the  requirements  of  commonality,  typicality  and  adequacy  of \nrepresentation,20 it does not follow that the latter two are necessarily satisfied \nif  the  former  is  satisfiedโwhich,  at  this  point,  has  not  been  properly \ndetermined.   In other words, a finding of commonality does not excuse a \ndistrict court from appropriately analyzing whether typicality and adequacy of \nrepresentation exist.  Moreover, such analysis must be conducted not with \nrespect  to  any  potential  claimant,  but  with  respect  to  โthe  representative \nparties.โ  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a) (emphasis added).  Indeed, a district court \ncan only appropriately assess such factors as โthe willingness and ability of the \nrepresentatives to . . . control the litigation and to protect the interests of \nabsenteesโ21 with reference to one or more specific claimants, as opposed to any \nclaimant that could fall within the putative class.   \nPlaintiffsโ suggestion that the district courtโs ability to amend its existing \ncertification order to approve new class representatives saves the order from \nits deficiencies is likewise without merit.  Rule 23 makes clear that a class \naction may proceed โonly ifโ each of the Rule 23(a) requirements and at least \none Rule 23(b) requirement is satisfied.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23; see also Baker \nv. Washington Mut. Fin. Grp., L.L.C., 193 F. Appโx 294, 296 (5th Cir. 2006) \n(recognizing  that  โ[a]  class  can  be  certified  only  if  it  meets  each  of  the \nrequirements outlined in Rule 23(a)โ (emphasis added)).  Further, nothing in \nRule 23(c), which allows for the amendment of an order granting or denying \nclass certification, relieves plaintiffs seeking class certification from complying \n                                         \n20 See Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 157 n.13 (1982). \n21 See Slade, 856 F.3d at 412 (quoting Feder, 429 F.3d at 130) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).   \n19 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 20     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 21 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nwith, or a court certifying a class from finding satisfaction of, the requirements \nof Rule 23(a) prior to a class initially being certified.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(c). \nAccordingly, we find that the district courtโs unsupported conclusion that \ntypicality  and  adequacy  are  satisfied,  coupled  with  its  failure  to  identify \nspecific class representatives and meaningfully analyze their fitness to serve \nin such capacity, defies the mandate to conduct a rigorous Rule 23(a) analysis \nincluding detailed written reasons that reference the facts and claims at hand.  \nSee Yates, 868 F.3d at 362; Vizena, 360 F.3d at 503; Stirman, 280 F.3d at 563, \nn.7.    Thus,  the  district  court  erred  on  this  basis  also  in  certifying  the \nIncompetent Detainee and Insanity Acquittee classes. \nb.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nIn addition to satisfying the four Rule 23(a) prerequisites, to have a class \nproperly certified, the party seeking certification must show that one of the \nthree  Rule  23(b)  requirements  is  fulfilled.    See  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  23(b).  \nSatisfaction of any of the Rule 23(b) requirements is contingent on satisfaction \nof each of the Rule 23(a) requirements in that a criterion for maintaining a \nclass action under any of the Rule 23(b) requirements is compliance with Rule \n23(a).  See id. (providing that โ[a] class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) \nis satisfiedโ and if one of the three Rule 23(b) requirements is met).  The district \ncourt determined that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2)22 are satisfied here.  \nIn light of our finding that the district court failed to conduct a rigorous \nanalysis of the Rule 23(a) requirements and, as a result, erred in certifying \nboth purported classes of plaintiffs, it would be premature at this juncture for \nus to address the merits of whether Rule 23(b)(2)โs strictures are met.  \n                                         \n22 As stated above, to obtain class certification under Rule 23(b)(2), the party seeking \ncertification must establish that โthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  FED R. CIV. P. 23(b)(2).   \n20 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713881     Page: 21     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 22 of 24\nNo. 17-50899 \nGiven the current posture of this case, however, we take this opportunity \nto briefly discuss what is required to comply with Rule 23(b)(2), the key to \nwhich  is  โthe  indivisible  nature  of  the  injunctive  or  declaratory  remedy \nwarrantedโthe notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or \ndeclared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.โ  \nWal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 360 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nRule 23(b)(2) certification is warranted if the following three requirements are \nsatisfied:  โ(1) class members must have been harmed in essentially the same \nway; (2) injunctive relief must predominate over monetary damage claims; and \n(3) the injunctive relief sought must be specific.โ  Yates, 868 F.3d at 366-67 \n(quoting Maldanado v. Ochsner Clinic Found., 493 F.3d 521, 524 (5th Cir. \n2007)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We note that satisfaction of these \nrequirements is premised on โcommon behavior by the defendant toward the \nclass,โ as opposed to the presence of common issues.  Id. at 366 (quoting In re \nRodriguez,  695  F.3d  360,  365  (5th  Cir.  2012))  (internal  quotation  marks \nomitted).  Thus, this court has found purported class members to have been \nโharmed in essentially the same wayโ where they have each been subject to \nthe same allegedly wrongful policy, despite variations in the degree of damages \nsuffered by each.  See Yates, 868 F.3d at 367-68 (finding that state prisoners \nwho were โsubject to the same policy on climate controlโ were โharmed in \nessentially the same way,โ i.e., โby exposure to a substantial risk of serious \nharm because of exposure to excessive heatโ).   \nWith respect to the Rule 23(b)(2) requirement that the injunctive relief \nsought be specific, we have recognized that plaintiffs must โgive content to the \ninjunctive relief they seek so that final injunctive relief may be crafted to \ndescribe in reasonable detail the acts required.โ  Yates, 868 F.3d at 367 (quoting \nPerry,  675  F.3d  at  848)  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citation  omitted) \n(emphasis added).

We note, \ntherefore, that to comply with Rule 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs will, at minimum, have \nto describe in some kind of detail from what actions or inactions Defendant \nshould be restrained.  A general request that Defendant be restrained from \nviolating Plaintiffsโ Fourteenth Amendment protections is insufficient.23   \nCONCLUSION \n  The district court failed to conduct a rigorous analysis of any of the Rule \n23(a) factors and, therefore, erred in certifying the Incompetent Detainee and \nInsanity Acquittee classes.  Accordingly, we VACATE the district courtโs class \ncertification order and REMAND this matter to the district court for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n                                         \n23 Here, in their โPrayer for Relief,โ Plaintiffs request that the District Court โ[i]ssue \npreliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  restraining  Defendant  from  violating  the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in relation to the confinement of \nindividuals awaiting competency restoration treatment and the confinement of persons found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and awaiting evaluation and/or treatment services.โ  In turn, \nthe district court held that โ[i]f Plaintiffs can establish that Hellerstedt violates the due-\nprocess rights of the proposed class members, the court may render an injunction that will \nstate with specificity the acts to be restrained or required without the need for specific relief \ntailored to each class member.โ   \n22 \n\n      Case: 17-50899      Document: 00514713884     Page: 1     Date Filed: 11/07/2018\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 76   Filed 11/07/18   Page 24 of 24\nUnited States Court of Appeals \nFIFTH CIRCUIT \nOFFICE OF THE CLERK \n   \n \nLYLE W.

When an individual charged with a crime is found to be incompetent to stand trial, \nTexas law requires that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (โHHSCโ)1 provide \nthe incompetent detainee with treatment aimed at restoring the individual to competency.  Texas \nlaw further requires that this specialized competency restoration treatment must be provided by \nHHSC, and the treatment can only be provided in a state mental health facility or, under certain \ncircumstances and with proper supervision, in a community-based outpatient program overseen by \nthe HHSC.2 \n2.  When an individual charged with a crime is found not guilty by reason of insanity \nand the court determines that the offense of which the person was acquitted involved dangerous \nconduct, Texas law requires that the court commit the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by \nHHSC for evaluation of the personโs present mental condition and for treatment.  These services \ncan be provided by only HHSC.  Texas law states that the insanity acquittee cannot remain in jail \nawaiting transfer to a facility designated by HHSC for a period longer than fourteen days. \n3.  Because HHSCโs facilities are full, HHSC refuses to accept custody of those \nordered to its care and instead places persons found incompetent to stand trial and persons found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity on waiting lists until a bed at an HHSC mental health facility \n                                                           \n1 As of September 1, 2017, oversight of the state hospitals and behavioral health programs, formerly the purview of \nthe Department of State Health Services, was moved under the oversight of the Health and Human Services \nCommission. \n2 In 2013, the Texas Legislature appropriated money for two pilot jail-based competency restoration programs.  See \nActs 2013, 83rd Leg., ch. 797 (S.B. 1475), ยง 2, eff. Sept. 1, 2013.  As of the date of this filing, a few jail-based \ncompetency-restoration program have been established; however, these programs are available only to offenders who \nare not committed to a maximum-security facility.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 3 of 32\nbecomes available.  It is not uncommon for these individuals, after the issuance of the order \ncommitting them to HHSC facilities, to wait in jail for months until HHSC accepts custody.   \n4.  Often, incompetent detaineesโdespite being presumed innocentโend up being \nincarcerated in jail prior to adjudication and pending treatment longer than if they had been found \nguilty of the alleged crime.  In addition, insanity acquitteesโdespite being acquittedโalso end up \nbeing  incarcerated  in  jail  for  months  after  an  adjudication  that  absolves  them  of  criminal \nresponsibility. \n5.  This situation is not new.  HHSC created its waiting lists for individuals found \nincompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to an HHSC mental \nhealth facility in 2006. Since 2006, the number of criminal defendants found incompetent or not \nguilty by reason of insanity and ordered to an HHSC facility for evaluation and/or treatment has \nonly increased. \n6.  As a result of the delays caused by HHSC, incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees languish in county jails absent a criminal conviction until a bed becomes available at an \nHHSC mental health facility.  Additionally, Texas jails are not designed or administered to provide \neither competency restoration treatment for incompetent detainees or evaluation and/or treatment \nservices for the psychiatric needs of insanity acquittees, leaving Plaintiffs with no meaningful \ncompetency restoration or evaluation and treatment while they wait for a bed at an HHSC facility.  \nAs such, incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees suffer needless deterioration of their mental \nhealth as they wait in jails, frequently in prolonged isolation, for weeks or months before they \nreceive the services HHSC is responsible for providing. \n7.  The delays caused by HHSC violate the due process rights of incompetent detainees \nand insanity acquittees as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendant has a duty to \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 4 of 32\naccept and treat detainees within a reasonable period of time, which must be measured in days, not \nweeks or months.  For insanity acquittees, Texas law specifically mandates that such persons not \nremain in jail in excess of fourteen days.  Defendantโs failure to timely accept transfer of \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees to its facilities and to provide timely restoration and \nevaluative treatment, however, forces Plaintiffs and members of the Classes they represent to \nremain incarcerated for weeks and months in county jails absent criminal convictions and without \nany of the court-ordered competency restoration treatment or evaluation and/or treatment services \nthat Defendant and HHSC are statutorily required to provide.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a \ndeclaration of their rights and an order enjoining Defendant from violating their rights.       \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This civil action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of law of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction \nover this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (civil rights). \n9.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).  \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Ward to a state \nmental health facility and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail for 59 weeks \nbefore being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on April 4, 2017.  While in jail, Mr. \nWard did not receive competency restoration treatment.  Plaintiff Joseph Wardโs mental state \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 5 of 32\nlimited his ability to protect his legal interests.  As such, a next friend was necessary to represent \nhis interests.

Plaintiff Cecil Adickes was a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about November 7, 2016, Mr. Adickes was found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental \nhealth facility for evaluation of his present mental condition and for treatment.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order and the fourteen-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal \nProcedure Article 46C.160, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Adickes to \na state mental health facility and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 13 \nweeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on February 9, 2017.  Mr. \nAdickes did not and could not receive the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in jail.  To assist \nMr. Adickes in the representation of his interests, Plaintiff Adickesโs criminal defense attorney, \nElsie Craven, has volunteered and agreed to serve as Plaintiff Adickesโs next friend. \n14.  Plaintiff Kenneth Jones is a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Harris County, Texas. On or about August 10, 2017, Mr. Jones was found \nincompetent to stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to transfer Mr. Jones to a \nstate mental health facility and, as a result, he was incarcerated for 49 weeks before being admitted \nto Rusk State Hospital on July 19, 2018. Mr. Jones did not and could not receive competency \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 7 of 32\nrestoration treatment in jail. Plaintiff Jonesโs current mental state limits his ability to protect his \nlegal interests.  As such, a next friend is necessary to represent his interests.  Plaintiff Jonesโs \ncriminal defense attorney, Patricia Sedita, has volunteered and agreed to serve as Plaintiff Jonesโs \nnext friend. \n15.  Plaintiff Mary Sapp was a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about May 23, 2017, Ms. Sapp was found not guilty by \nreason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental health facility \nfor evaluation of her present mental condition and for treatment.

Ms. Cantrell \ndoes not receive competency restoration treatment in jail and has been waiting to be transferred to \na state mental health facility for competency treatment for over 35 days.  Plaintiff Cantrellโs current \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 8 of 32\nmental state limits her ability to protect her legal interests.

Albright and Michael R. Abrams. \nCLASS ACTION ALLLEGATIONS \n18.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated as \nmembers of the following plaintiff classes: \na.  Class for Incompetent Detainees with Named Plaintiffs Joseph Ward, Marc Lawson, \nJennifer Lampkin, Kenneth Jones, and Kara Cantrell, through their next friends, being \nappointed as class representatives: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a crime in \nthe State of Texas, (b) court-ordered to a Texas HHSC facility to receive \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 9 of 32\ncompetency restoration services; but, (c) due to HHSCโs waiting lists are \ninstead detained in a Texas county jail more than 21 days from the day HHSC \nreceives the court order to the day HHSC notifies the jail the person can be \nadmitted to an HHSC mental health facility. \n \nb.  Class for Insanity Acquittees with Named Plaintiffs Cecil Adickes and Mary Sapp, \nthrough their next friends, being appointed as class representatives: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a crime in \nthe State of Texas and who are found not guilty by reason of insanity, (b) \nordered to receive evaluation and/or treatment services at an HHSC facility; \nbut, (c) due to HHSCโs waiting lists are instead detained in a Texas county jail \nmore than 14 days from the day HHSC receives the court order to the day HHSC \nnotifies the jail the person can be admitted to an HHSC mental health facility. \n \n19.  Plaintiffs  seek  class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2). \n20.  While the precise number of Class Members in each class is not known to Plaintiffs \nwith certainty because the number necessarily fluctuates, based on Defendantโs recent discovery \nresponses, Plaintiffs estimate that there are approximately 732 individuals at present who, although \nordered to an HHSC mental health facility to receive competency restoration services or evaluation \nand treatment services, remain incarcerated in jail for months waiting for a bed in an HHSC mental \nhealth facility.  As for potential future Class Members, that number is indeterminable.  Class \nMembers are detained in over seventy-five different county jails located throughout the state of \nTexas.    \n21.  As for the class of individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial, the \nPlaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class. Because of Defendantโs  \nwaiting  lists,  the  individual  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class  have  all  been  adjudicated,  or  will  be \nadjudicated, to be incompetent to stand trial and are, or will, remain incarcerated in jail more than \ntwenty-one days waiting for a bed at an HHSC mental health facility to begin receiving the \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 10 of 32\nstatutorily required competency restoration treatment.  Plaintiffs and all members of the Class have \nsimilarly suffered harm or will suffer harm in the future arising from Defendantโs actions and \ninaction. \n22.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \n \nWhether HHSC has failed to accept the ordered transfer of Plaintiffs and other Class \nMembers to its facilities for competency restoration treatment in a timely manner; \n \nWhether Defendantโs failure to admit individuals determined incompetent to stand \ntrial and ordered to HHSCโs mental health facilities for competency restoration \npurposes in a reasonably timely manner, (e.g. within twenty-one days of receiving \nthe court order committing them to an HHSC mental health facility) causing them \nto remain incarcerated in county jails, violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n23.  As for the class of individuals who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, \nthe Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class.  Because of Defendantโs \nwaiting lists, the individual Plaintiffs and the Class have all been, or will be, found not guilty by \nreason of insanity and are, or will be, incarcerated in jail for more than fourteen days while waiting \nfor a bed at an HHSC mental health facility to receive the statutorily required evaluation and/or \ntreatment services.  Plaintiffs and all members of the Class have similarly suffered harm or will \nsuffer harm in the future arising from Defendantโs actions and inaction. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 11 of 32\n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether HHSC has failed to accept transfer of individual Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity for evaluation \nand/or treatment services in a timely manner; \n \nWhether HHSCโs failure to admit individuals who have been found not guilty by \nreason of insanity and ordered by the criminal court to its mental health facility for \nevaluation and/or treatment services within fourteen days, causing them to remain \nincarcerated in county jails, violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n25.  As to both proposed classes, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and \nprotect the interests of the Classes.  There are no conflicts of interest between the Plaintiffs and \nthe other members of the Classes.  The Class members will vigorously prosecute this action on \nbehalf of the Classes.  The Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill \nand experience in civil rights and mental health litigation, who will vigorously prosecute this case \non behalf of the Classes. \n26.  For both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees, HHSC has acted or failed \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entirety of both Classes. \n27.  The claims asserted herein are inherently transitory.  There is a continuing and \nsubstantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of \nPlaintiffs and the Classes. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 12 of 32\n28.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs and other members of the Classes seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and all of the necessary factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present. \n29.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause  individual  litigation  of  these  claims  would  be  impracticable  and  would  be  unduly \nburdensome to the courts.  Further, this suit may be maintained as a class action because common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and \nindividual litigation would increase the likelihood of inconsistent or contradictory judgments.  A \nclass  action  presents  fewer  management  difficulties  and  provides  the  benefits  of  a  single \nadjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n30.  Defendant  and  HHSC,  through  their  actions  and  inaction,  cause  incompetent \ndetainees and insanity acquittees to be incarcerated for weeks or months before HHSC provides \nthem their court-ordered competency restoration treatment or evaluation and/or treatment services.  \nA.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit incompetent detainees to an HHSC facility for \ncompetency restoration services. \n \n31.  Under state and federal law, individuals who lack the ability to understand the \nnature of the criminal court proceedings against them may not be tried. \n32.  Article 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when a criminal defendantโs mental competency is challenged during \ncriminal proceedings.  \n33.  A person is incompetent to stand trial if he or she does not have โsufficient present \nability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,โ or \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 13 of 32\nโa rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.โ  TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. art. 46B.003(a)(1)&(2).   \n34.  โEither party may suggest by motion, or the trial court may suggest on its own \nmotion, that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(a).  โIf the court \ndetermines that there is evidence to support a finding of incompetence, the court . . . shall stay all \nother proceedings in the case.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(d).  โIf the defendant is found incompetent to \nstand trial, the court shall proceed under Subchapter D.โ  Id. \n35.  Pursuant to Subchapter D, article 46B.071, the court, on a determination that a \ncriminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial, shall either commit the defendant to a mental \nhealth facility designated by HHSC under 46B.073, or release the defendant on bail subject to \nconditions under 46B.072.  Id., art. 46B.071. \n36.  For a defendant not released on bail, the court shall commit a defendant to a mental \nhealth facility or residential care facility for a period not to exceed 60 days (misdemeanor) or 120 \ndays (felony) โfor purposes of further examination and competency restoration services with the \nspecific objective of the defendant attaining competency to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.073(b) \n(emphasis added). \n37.  If a defendant is charged with a โviolent offense,โ as listed in article 17.032(a), \nother than an assault, or the indictment alleges an affirmative finding that a deadly weapon was \nused during the commission of a felony, โthe court shall enter an order committing the defendant \nto the maximum security unit [MSU] of any facility designated by [HHSC] . . ..โ  Id., art. \n46B.073(c).  If the defendant is not charged with one of the enumerated offenses, โthe court shall \nenter an order committing the defendant to a mental health facility or residential care facility . . ..โ  \nId., art. 46B.073(d). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 14 of 32\n38.  An order committing the defendant for restoration of competency โmust place the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to \nreceive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.โ  Id., art. 46B.075. \n39.  Not later than the date of the order of commitment, the court must send a copy of \nthe order to the facility to which the defendant is committed.  Id., art. 46B.076(a). \n40.  The facility to which the defendant is committed must: develop an individual \nprogram of treatment; assess and evaluate whether the defendant will obtain competency in the \nforeseeable future; and report to the court and local mental health or intellectual disability authority \non defendantโs progress toward achieving competency.  Id., art. 46B.077(a).   \n41.  Not later than the 15th day before the date on which the restoration period is to \nexpire, the head of the facility must so notify the court that the restoration period is about to expire.  \nId., art. 46B.079(a).  Further, the head of the facility must also โpromptlyโ notify the court when \nthe defendant has obtained competency to stand trial or upon a determination that the defendant \nwill not attain competency in the foreseeable future.  Id., art. 46B.079(b).   \n42.  On the return of the defendant to the court, the court must make a determination as \nto the defendantโs competency to stand trial.  The court must make this determination not later \nthan the 20th day after the court received the notice from the head of the facility required by article \n46B.079. Id., art. 46B.084(a).  If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, criminal \nproceedings may be resumed; if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the court may \ndetermine whether the defendant should be subject to civil commitment. \nB.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity to \nan HHSC facility for evaluation and/or treatment. \n \n43.  Article 46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when the defense of insanity is raised on behalf of a criminal defendant. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 15 of 32\n44.  A person is not guilty by reason of insanity if a judge or jury has determined: โ(1) \nthe prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged conduct constituting \nthe offense was committed; and (2) the defense has established by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged conduct.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. \n46C.153(a). \n45.  โ[A] defendant who is found not guilty by reason of insanity stands acquitted of the \noffense charged and may not be considered a person charged with an offense.โ  Id., art. 46C.155(a). \n46.  Since the individual is acquitted of the offense and no longer considered a person \ncharged with an offense, โโฆthe court may [only] order the defendant detained in jail or any other \nsuitable place for a period not to exceed 14 days.โ Id., art. 46C.160(a). \n47.  Following a finding that an individual is not guilty by reason of insanity, the court \nmust immediately determine whether the offense of which the person was acquitted involved \ndangerous conduct as defined in art. 46C.157.   \n48.  If the court determines that the offense involved dangerous conduct, โ[t]he court \nshall order the acquitted person to be committed for evaluation of the personโs present mental \ncondition and for treatment to the maximum security unit of any facility designated by the \n[HHSC].โ Id., art. 46C.251(a).   \n49.  When  there  is  a  finding  of  dangerous  conduct  and  an  insanity  acquittee  is \ncommitted to an HHSC facility for evaluation and/or treatment services, the facility designated by \nHHSC  receives  a  copy  of  the  transcript  of  all  medical  testimony  and  certain  identifying \ninformation regarding the insanity acquittee. Id., art. 46C.251(b)(1)&(2).   \n50.  Upon transfer of the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by HHSC within 14 \ndays, and following the evaluation and/or treatment of the insanity acquittee, HHSC must file a \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 16 of 32\nreport that describes and explains the procedure, techniques, and tests used in the examination of \nthe person. Id., art. 46C.252(b).  โThe report must address:  \n(1) whether the acquitted person has a mental illness or [intellectual disability] and, \nif so, whether the mental illness or [intellectual disability] is severe; \n(2) whether as a result of any severe mental illness or [intellectual disability] the \nacquitted person is likely to cause serious harm to another;  \n(3) whether as a result of any impairment the acquitted person is subject to \ncommitment under Subtitle C or D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code;  \n(4) prospective treatment  and supervision  options, if any, appropriate for the \nacquitted person; and  \n(5) whether any required treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively \nprovided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision.โ \n \nId., art. 46C.252(c). \n \n51.  On the return of the insanity acquittee to court, the court shall conduct a hearing on \ndisposition and shall order the acquitted person (i) committed for inpatient treatment or residential \ncare, (ii) to receive outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, (iii) transferred to \nan appropriate court for civil commitment proceedings under the Texas Health and Safety Code, \nor (iv) discharged and immediately released.  Id., arts. 46C.253(b)-(e). \nC.  County jails are unable to provide competency restoration services to individuals \nfound  incompetent  to  stand  trial  and  are  unable  to  provide  evaluation  and/or \ntreatment services to individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n \n52.  County jails in Texas are inappropriate settings for the care and treatment of \nindividuals with mental illness or intellectual disabilities (formerly called โmental retardationโ).  \nJails are not designed to be therapeuticโthey are inherently punitiveโnor do they provide any \ntreatment aimed at restoring a person to competency or evaluation and/or treatment services for \nindividuals found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n53.  Correctional facilities, particularly facilities designed for short-term detention, do \nnot have the staffing, funding, or capabilities to provide treatment aimed at restoring a person to \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 17 of 32\ncompetency or evaluation and/or treatment services for individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity. \n54.  Detainees who are found incompetent to stand trial and detainees who are found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity are often the most severely mentally ill in Texas jail settings. \n55.  Most  Texas  jails  do  not  have  the  ability  to  provide  even  basic  psychiatric \nstabilization and management.  As a result, many detainees with serious mental illness are harmed \nby the punitive jail setting as manifested by either increased symptoms of their underlying \npsychiatric disorders or lack of improvement regarding their current symptoms.  By refusing to \ntimely take custody of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees), Defendant \nand HHSC cause such persons to be incarcerated in county jails under conditions nearly certain to \nexacerbate their mental health conditions. \n56.  Because county jails are often unable to provide even basic mental health treatment, \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees frequently end up between a rock and a hard place: \neither they are housed in the general jail populationโoften with convicted offendersโor they are \nplaced in solitary confinement, which causes their mental health to further deteriorate.  This \ndeterioration  conflicts  with  the  Stateโs  interest  in  prompt  evaluation  and  treatment  so  that \nincompetent detainees may be brought to trial, or so that insanity acquittees are not punished for \ncrimes they were acquitted of and are appropriately committed, transferred, or released.  \n57.  Besides struggling to provide even basic mental health care, county jails in Texas \ndo not have the specific services necessary to restore individuals to competency to stand trial, such \nas the most current medications, identification of specific social needs to restore and maintain \ncompetency, and training specific to the restoration of competency.  In contrast, state mental health \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 18 of 32\nfacilities are specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment to restore incompetent detainees \nto competence, thereby enabling them to stand trial.   \n58.  County jails in Texas also do not have the specific services necessary to provide \nevaluation and/or treatment services to insanity acquittees.  State mental health facilities, however, \nare specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment and to conduct evaluations to make \ncomplex determinations about a personโs mental health condition(s), including whether a person \nis likely to cause serious harm to another, whether a person is subject to commitment under the \nTexas Health and Safety Code, and whether prospective treatment and supervision options are \nappropriate, safe, and effective. \n59.  Nevertheless,  Defendant  knowingly,  intentionally,  and  deliberately  refuses  to \naccept individuals found incompetent to stand trial and individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity into state mental health facilities in violation of the requirements of Chapters 46B and \n46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the orders of the criminal courts, and the U.S. \nConstitution.        \nD.  Defendant has failed to timely admit incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees \nwho have been ordered to an HHSC mental health facility. \n \n60.  According to a 2014 Joint Report by the National Sheriffsโ Association and the \nTreatment Advocacy Center, โTexas is among the states with the lowest number of public \npsychiatric beds and among the stingiest states in per capita mental health spending.โ  \n61.  Because HHSC facilities are full, in February 2006, HHSC implemented a policy \nand practice that requires detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees) to be \nplaced on one of two waiting lists until a bed becomes available at the designated facility.  The \ntwo waiting lists are the MSU Admission List and the Forensic Clearinghouse List.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 19 of 32\n62.  HHSCโs policy and practice is to place all admissions to HHSC mental health \nfacilities on these two lists contingent on the availability of space.  Individuals placed on the \nwaiting lists are generally given admission to an appropriate state hospital primarily on a first-\ncome, first-served basis.   \n63.  In June of 2014, the number of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees) waiting to be transferred to a state mental health facility was about 170; by February \nof 2016, the number had risen to more than 380.  As of April 1, 2016, the longest wait time for a \nnon-maximum security bed was 122 daysโalmost nine months.  According to HHSC, as of April \n1, 2016, the average wait time for a maximum-security bed was 275 days.   \n64.  According to a May 13, 2016 investigative report by ABC-13, state statistics going \nback to 2006 show that the number of detainees waiting in jails for competency restoration \ntreatment โhas never been this long,โ and that the number of individuals on the wait list has grown \nby โ20% in the last six months.โ   \n65.  As of the filing of the Third Amended Complaint in this case in September 2017, \n283 individuals were waiting in county jails for a maximum-security bed; currently, that number \nhas increased to approximately 463 individuals.  The number of individuals waiting in a county \njail longer than twenty-one days for a maximum-security bed has increased from 246 in September \n2017 to approximately 417 as of January 2019.  The individual who has been waiting in jail for a \nmaximum security bed the longest has currently been waiting almost 400 daysโover two months \nlonger than the longest wait in September 2017.  As for the wait list for a non-maximum security \nbed, the waitlist has nearly tripled from 96 individuals in September 2017 to 269 currently waiting \nin jail for such a bed.  While only four individuals had been waiting longer than twenty-one days \nin September 2017, that list has climbed to approximately 174 individuals waiting longer than \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 20 of 32\ntwenty-one days for a non-maximum security bed as of January 2019.  The individual who has \nbeen waiting in jail the longest for a non-maximum security bed has been waiting 113 days, which \nis three times longer than the person waiting the longest at the time of the filing of Plaintiffsโ Third \nAmended Complaint.   \n66.  The delay in admitting those found incompetent to stand trial infringes on their right \nto be free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction as well as the ability to receive \ncompetency-restoration treatment, which necessarily extends the time within which an individual \ncan be tried once restored to competency.   \n67.  The delay in admitting those found not guilty by reason of insanity infringes on \ntheir right to be free from incarceration after being absolved of criminal responsibility, as well as \ntheir ability to receive evaluation and treatment so that the criminal courts can reach final \ndispositions in their civil commitments.  \n68.  Because incompetent criminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime \nand insanity acquittees have been absolved of criminal responsibility, both classes of persons have \na liberty interest in freedom from incarceration.  Because the detention of incompetent detainees \nis solely for the purpose of restorative treatment and the detention of insanity acquittees is solely \nfor evaluation and/or treatment services, lack of funds, staff, or facilities are not legitimate \ngovernment purposes thatt justify the Defendantโs failures.. \n69.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, the Individual Plaintiffs and the \nClasses will continue to be deprived of their liberty rights without due process of law, in violation \nof their constitutional rights.   \n70.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 21 of 32\nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Ward to a state \nmental health facility and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail for 59 weeks \nbefore being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on April 4, 2017.  While in jail, Mr. \nWard did not receive competency restoration treatment.   \n71.  Mr. Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, epilepsy, asthma, and \nhypertension.  Harris County Jail staff noted that Mr. Ward has a history of neurocognitive \nimpairment.  In February 2016, during a mental health assessment, staff noted Mr. Wardโs \nconfusion and inability to remember information such as street names, location, and names of \ndoctors.  Staff noted that โcompetency restoration may be unlikely or slow based on current clinical \npresentation of the assessment.โ    \n72.  Mr. Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he has \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial.  During his most recent incarceration, Mr. Ward requested, \nand voluntarily took, his psychotropic medications; however, he continued to report command \nauditory hallucinations throughout his incarceration. \n73.  Plaintiff Marc Lawson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 390th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about May 11, 2016, Mr. Lawson was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lawson to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Lawson to a state mental \nhealth facility and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for sixty weeks before \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 22 of 32\nbeing admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on July 20, 2017.  Mr. Lawson did not \nreceive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n74.  Mr. Lawson is twenty-two years old, has never previously been incarcerated, and \nhas been in the Texas Child Protective Services system since age five.  Mr. Lawson is diagnosed \nwith an intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity \ndisorder,  bipolar  disorder,  conduct  disorder,  antisocial  personality  disorder,  epilepsy/seizure \ndisorder and Hepatitis C. Mr. Lawson has a history of treatment at psychiatric hospitals and \nreceiving psychotropic medication from a young age.   \n75.  During Mr. Lawsonโs incarceration, jail personnel reported that he had obvious \ncognitive deficits and poor social skills.  He was categorized as vulnerable, and jail personnel \ndocumented concerns over his being housed in a cell with other inmates due to his vulnerability. \nUpon his admission, Mr. Lawson was initially placed in full suicide precaution and/or psychiatric \nlockdown housing for about one week. While in psychiatric lockdown and full suicide precaution \nhousing, Mr. Lawson was permitted outside of his cell for only one hour a day, and it was not \nguaranteed that he would receive any time outdoors.  He was then transferred to and housed in a \nsingle cell for over two months. Mr. Lawson was prescribed two medications for his medical \nconditions and one antipsychotic. The Travis County Jail classified his mental health and medical \nneeds as severe.  \n76.  Mr. Lawsonโs psychiatric evaluation from May 2016 stated that he is incompetent \nto stand trial and โcompetency cannot be restored in the foreseeable future with traditional \ncompetency restoration treatment due to the chronic nature of his condition.โ  The psychiatrist \ndocumented that although he is prescribed psychiatric medication, the medication โwill not \nimprove cognitive symptoms responsible for observed deficits relating to trial competency.โ  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 23 of 32\n77.  Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin is a defendant in a criminal case in the 403rd Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about March 31, 2016, Ms. Lampkin was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nThe order also required the Sheriff to transport Ms. Lampkin to a state mental health facility.  \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Ms. \nLampkin to its state mental health facility and, as a result, she was incarcerated in the Travis \nCounty Jail for 65 weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on July 6, \n2017.  Ms. Lampkin did not receive competency restoration treatment in jail.   \n78.  Ms. Lampkin is diagnosed with an intellectual disability and bipolar disorder. She \nalso has a history of psychosis, resulting in numerous emergency psychiatric hospitalizations.  She \nhas a long history of mental illness and has a history of being treated by Austin Travis County \nIntegral Care. \n79.  While incarcerated, Ms. Lampkin exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related to \nher mental health condition.  Records by the jail counselor indicated that Ms. Lampkin has obvious \ncognitive deficits and is low functioning.  Ms. Lampkin was exclusively been housed in psychiatric \nhousing and, in July 2016, the jail counselor reported that she is โstruggling due to isolation.โ  \nMoreover, the jail conditions affected Ms. Lampkinโs physical condition.  Over the duration of her \nincarceration, Ms. Lampkin lost over thirty lbs. \n80.  Plaintiff Cecil Adickes was a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about November 7, 2016, Mr. Adickes was found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental \nhealth facility for evaluation of his present mental condition and for treatment.  Despite the \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 24 of 32\ncriminal courtโs order and the fourteen-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal \nProcedure Article 46C.160, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Adickes to \na state mental health facility and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 13 \nweeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on February 9, 2017.  Mr. \nAdickes did not and could not receive the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in jail.  \n81.  Plaintiff Kenneth Jones is a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Harris County, Texas. On or about August 10, 2017, Mr. Jones was found \nincompetent to stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Jones \nto a state mental health facility, and, as a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail for \n49 weeks before being admitted to Rusk State Hospital on July 19, 2018.  Mr. Jones did not and \ncould not receive the competency restoration treatment in jail. \n82.  Mr. Jones has a long psychiatric history and has been diagnosed with bipolar \ndisorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. During this recent incarceration, Mr. Jones requested \nand voluntarily took his psychotropic medications; however, in May of 2017, he reported that his \nmedication was not working and that he had become suicidal.  Mr. Jonesโ medications were \nadjusted, but he continued to report visual hallucinations and delusions at the time of the filing of \nPlaintiffsโ Third Amended Complaint.  Mr. Jones also had several altercations with other inmates \nresulting in at least three disciplinary charges. \n83.  Plaintiff Mary Sapp was a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about May 23, 2017, Ms. Sapp was found not guilty by \nreason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental health facility \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 25 of 32\nfor evaluation of her present mental condition and for treatment. Despite the criminal courtโs order \nand the fourteen-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46C.160, \nHHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Ms. Sapp to a state mental health facility \nand, as a result, she was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail for 15 weeks before being admitted \nto North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on August 23, 2017. Ms. Sapp did not and could not receive \nthe court-ordered evaluation and treatment in jail. \n84.  Ms. Sapp is 68 years old and has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, \nCOPD, diabetes, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, asthma, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and spinal \ndegeneration. Ms. Sapp had previously been found incompetent to stand trial on this charge and \nspent seven months at North Texas State Hospital-Vernon for competency restoration treatment.  \nPrior to being incarcerated, Ms. Sapp was receiving outpatient psychiatric services.  Ms. Sapp has \nhad a number of falls while incarcerated at Harris County Jail and was even sent to the infirmary \nin April of 2017 due to her inability to care for her own activities of daily living.   \n85.  Plaintiff Kara Cantrell is a defendant in a criminal case in the 5th County Court at \nLaw of Travis County, Texas.  On or about February 19, 2019, Ms. Cantrell was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, HHSC has not allowed Travis County to transfer Ms. Cantrell to a state \nmental health facility and, as a result, she continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail. \nMs. Cantrell does not receive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n86.  Ms. Cantrell is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.  As of the filing of this \ncomplaint, she continues to experience visual hallucinations and delusional thinking, despite her \ntaking psychotropic medications while in the Travis County Jail.  While confined in the Travis \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 26 of 32\nCounty Jail, Ms. Cantrell bounces back and forth between two pods.  On one pod, she is isolated \nin her cell for twenty-two hours a day causing increased hallucinations.  When the hallucinations \nbecome too extreme, she is moved to a general population pod to reduce her isolation; however, \nin these pods she is bullied.   Ms. Cantrell has a long history with the state hospital system, having \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial on at least three previous occasions, including one 46B \nextended commitment under which she spent over a year in the San Antonio State Hospital. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \nA.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Incompetent Detaineesโ Rights \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n \n87.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 86 above are incorporated \nherein. \n88.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n89.  Criminal defendants who have not been convicted and have been adjudicated \nincompetent to stand trial have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and the right not to \nbe punished. \n90.  To ensure Plaintiffs are not punished, due process requires that the nature and \nduration of confinement bear a reasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is \nconfined. \n91.  Once an individual is found unable to aid and assist in their own defense, all \ncriminal proceedings must stop.  The only stated lawful purpose for their continued confinement \nafter an incompetency determination is commitment for restorative treatment so as to return him \nor her to competency. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 27 of 32\n92.  County jails do not provide Plaintiffs with the restorative treatment required by \nstate law.  Instead, only facilities funded by Defendant provide restorative treatment. No legitimate \nstate interest justifies the continued incarceration of incompetent criminal defendants in county \njails for months on end, especially when there are state-mandated less harsh alternatives. \n93.  Defendantโs policy or practice therefore punishes the Plaintiffs by forcing them to \nlanguish in county jails for months before being admitted to one its facilities for the state-mandated \nrestorative treatment.  \n94.  The nature and duration of Class Plaintiffsโ and the other members of the Class of \nincompetent detaineesโ incarceration bears no reasonable relation to the restorative purpose for \nwhich the court has committed these individuals, violating their Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights. \n95.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of incompetent detainees \nare entitled to an order of the Court declaring that, by requiring persons found incompetent to stand \ntrial to remain in county jails for protracted periods and by failing to provide restorative treatment \nin a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n96.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members found incompetent to stand trial.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other Class members are therefore entitled to an order of the Court enjoining Defendant \nfrom further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation to their continued \nincarceration in jail while awaiting a bed at an HHSC mental health facility where they can receive \nthe state-mandated restorative treatment.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 28 of 32\nB.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Insanity Acquitteesโ Rights Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n \n97.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 96 above are incorporated \nherein. \n98.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n99.  Persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, and thereby acquitted \nof criminal charges, have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and the right not to be \npunished. \n100.  To ensure persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity are not \npunished, due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a reasonable \nrelation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n101.  Once an individual is found not guilty by reason of insanity, they have been \nacquitted of the offense charged and cannot remain incarcerated.  The only stated lawful purpose \nfor their continued confinement is commitment to an HHSC facility where they are to be provided \nevaluation and treatment services for the personโs present mental condition, which will enable the \ncourt to reach final disposition. \n102.  County jails do not have the resources or expertise to provide the evaluation and/or \ntreatment services mandated by state law. \n103.  No legitimate state interest justifies the incarceration of insanity acquittees in \ncounty jails for months on end, especially when there are state-mandated less harsh alternatives.  \n104.    Defendantโs policy or practice therefore punishes the Plaintiffs by forcing them to \nlanguish in county jails for months before being admitted to one of its facilities for the state-\nmandated evaluation and/or treatment services.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 92   Filed 04/02/19   Page 29 of 32\n105.   The nature and duration of Class Plaintiffsโ and the other members of the Class of \ninsanity acquitteesโ incarceration bears no reasonable relation to the evaluation and/or treatment \npurpose  for  which  the  court  has  committed  insanity  acquittees,  violating  their  Fourteenth \nAmendment due process rights. \n106.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are \nentitled to  an order of  the Court declaring that, by requiring insanity  acquittees to  remain \nincarcerated in county jails for protracted periods and by failing to provide evaluation and/or \ntreatment in a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n107.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are therefore entitled to an order of the \nCourt enjoining Defendant from further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation \nto their continued confinement while awaiting evaluation and/or treatment at an HHSC mental \nhealth facility.   \nATTORNEYโS FEES \n108.  Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE: Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to: \nA.

When an individual charged with a crime is found to be incompetent to stand trial, \nTexas law requires that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (โHHSCโ)1 provide \nthe incompetent detainee with treatment aimed at restoring the individual to competency.  Texas \nlaw further requires that this specialized competency restoration treatment must be provided by \nHHSC, and the treatment can only be provided in an HHSC mental health facility2 or, under certain \ncircumstances and with proper supervision, in a community-based outpatient program overseen by \nthe HHSC.3 \n2.  When an individual charged with a crime is found not guilty by reason of insanity \nand the court determines that the offense of which the person was acquitted involved dangerous \nconduct, Texas law requires that the court commit the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by \nHHSC for evaluation of the personโs present mental condition and for treatment.  These services \ncan be provided only by HHSC.  Texas law states that an insanity acquittee cannot remain in jail \nawaiting transfer to a facility designated by HHSC for a period longer than fourteen days. \n3.  Because HHSC lacks sufficient forensic capacity, HHSC refuses to accept custody \nof those ordered to its care and instead places persons found incompetent to stand trial and persons \nfound not guilty by reason of insanity on waiting lists until a bed at an HHSC mental health facility \n                                                           \n1 As of September 1, 2017, oversight of the state hospitals and behavioral health programs, formerly the purview of \nthe Department of State Health Services, was moved under the oversight of the Health and Human Services \nCommission. \n2 When Plaintiffs refer to HHSC mental health facilities, this term encompasses the entire system of all HHSC \noperated, funded, and contracted psychiatric beds. \n3 In addition to community-based outpatient programs, in 2013, the Texas Legislature appropriated money for two \npilot jail-based competency restoration programs.  See Acts 2013, 83rd Leg., ch. 797 (S.B. 1475), ยง 2, eff. Sept. 1, \n2013.  As of the date of this filing, a few jail-based competency-restoration program have been established; however, \nthese programs are available only to offenders who are not committed to a maximum-security facility.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 3 of 34\nbecomes available.  It is common for these individuals, after the issuance of the order committing \nthem to HHSC facilities, to wait in jail for months until HHSC accepts custody.   \n4.  Often, incompetent detaineesโdespite being presumed innocentโend up being \nincarcerated in jail prior to adjudication and pending treatment longer than if they had been found \nguilty of the alleged crime.  In addition, insanity acquitteesโdespite being acquittedโalso end up \nbeing  incarcerated  in  jail  for  months  after  an  adjudication  that  absolves  them  of  criminal \nresponsibility. \n5.  This situation is not new.  To manage forensic access to its mental health facilities, \nHHSC created its waiting lists for individuals found incompetent to stand trial or found not guilty \nby reason of insanity and ordered to an HHSC mental health facility in 2006. Since 2006, the \nnumber of criminal defendants found incompetent or not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered \nto an HHSC mental health facility for evaluation and/or treatment has only increased. \n6.  As a result of the delays caused by HHSC, incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees languish in county jails absent a criminal conviction until a bed becomes available at an \nHHSC mental health facility.  These delays harm Plaintiffs and other similarly situated individuals \nbecause Texas jails are not designed or administered to provide either competency restoration \ntreatment for incompetent detainees or evaluation and/or treatment services for the psychiatric \nneeds of insanity acquittees. As a result, Plaintiffs are left with no meaningful competency \nrestoration or evaluation and treatment while they wait in jail for a bed at an HHSC mental health \nfacility.  As such, incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees suffer needless deterioration of \ntheir mental health as they wait in jails, frequently in prolonged isolation, for weeks or months \nbefore they receive the services HHSC is responsible for providing. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 4 of 34\n7.  The delays caused by HHSC violate the due process rights of incompetent detainees \nand insanity acquittees as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendant has a duty to \naccept and provide state-mandated restoration and evaluation services to detainees within a \nreasonable period of time, which must be measured in days, not weeks or months.  For insanity \nacquittees, Texas law specifically mandates that such persons not remain in jail in excess of \nfourteen days.  Defendantโs failure to timely accept transfer of incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees to its facilities and to provide timely restoration and evaluative treatment, however, \nforces Plaintiffs and members of the Classes they represent to remain incarcerated for weeks and \nmonths  in  county  jails  absent  criminal  convictions  and  without  any  of  the  court-ordered \ncompetency restoration treatment or evaluation and/or treatment services that Defendant and \nHHSC are statutorily required to provide.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaration of their rights \nand an order enjoining Defendant from violating their rights.       \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This civil action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of law of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction \nover this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (civil rights). \n9.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).  \nPARTIES \n10.

Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order and the fourteen-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal \nProcedure Article 46C.160, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Adickes to \none of its mental health facilities; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list.  As a result, he \nwas incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 13 weeks before being admitted to North Texas State \nHospital-Vernon on February 9, 2017.

On or about June 22, 2016, Ms. Sapp was found incompetent to \nstand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.

Class for Insanity Acquittees with Named Plaintiffs Cecil Adickes and Mary Sapp, \nthrough their next friends, being appointed as class representatives: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a Texas crime \nand found not guilty by reason of insanity, (b) ordered to receive evaluation \nand/or treatment services at an HHSC mental health facility, but, (c) due to \nHHSCโs insufficient forensic capacity, (d) remain incarcerated in a county jail \nmore than 14 days from the day HHSC receives the court order to the day it \nnotifies the jail the person can be admitted to an HHSC mental health facility.  \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 10 of 34\n20.  Plaintiffs  seek  class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2). \n21.  While the precise number of Class Members in each class is not known to Plaintiffs \nwith certainty because the number necessarily fluctuates, based on Defendantโs recent discovery \nresponses, Plaintiffs estimate that as of March 15, 2019, there are approximately 771 individuals \nwho, although ordered to an HHSC mental health facility to receive competency restoration \nservices or evaluation and treatment services, remain incarcerated in jail.  Of these, 615 individuals \nhave been waiting in jail longer than 21 daysโin many of these cases, the wait is months long.  \nAs for potential future Class Members, that number is indeterminable.  Class Members are \ndetained in over seventy-five different county jails located throughout the state of Texas.    \n22.  As for the class of individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial, the \nPlaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class. Because of Defendantโs \ninsufficient forensic capacity, the individual Plaintiffs and the Class have all been adjudicated, or \nwill be adjudicated, to be incompetent to stand trial and are, or will, remain incarcerated in jail \nmore than twenty-one days waiting for a bed at an HHSC mental health facility to begin receiving \nthe statutorily required competency restoration treatment.  Plaintiffs and all members of the Class \nhave similarly suffered harm or will suffer harm in the future arising from Defendantโs actions and \ninaction. \n23.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \n \nWhether HHSC has failed to accept the ordered transfer of Plaintiffs and other Class \nMembers to its facilities for competency restoration treatment in a timely manner; \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 11 of 34\nWhether Defendantโs failure to admit individuals determined incompetent to stand \ntrial and ordered to HHSCโs mental health facilities for competency restoration \npurposes in a reasonably timely manner, (e.g., within twenty-one days of receiving \nthe court order committing them to an HHSC mental health facility) causing them \nto remain incarcerated in county jails, violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n24.  As for the class of individuals who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, \nthe Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class.  Because of Defendantโs \ninsufficient forensic capacity, the individual Plaintiffs and the Class have all been, or will be, found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and are, or will be, incarcerated in jail for more than fourteen days \nwhile waiting for a bed at an HHSC mental health facility to receive the statutorily required \nevaluation and/or treatment services.  Plaintiffs and all members of the Class have similarly \nsuffered harm or will suffer harm in the future arising from Defendantโs actions and inaction. \n25.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether HHSC has failed to accept transfer of individual Plaintiffs and other class \nmembers who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity for evaluation \nand/or treatment services in a timely manner; \n \nWhether HHSCโs failure to admit individuals who have been found not guilty by \nreason of insanity and ordered by the criminal court to its mental health facility for \nevaluation and/or treatment services within fourteen days, causing them to remain \nincarcerated in county jails, violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 12 of 34\nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n26.  As to both proposed classes, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and \nprotect the interests of the Classes.  There are no conflicts of interest between the Plaintiffs and \nthe other members of the Classes.  The Class members will vigorously prosecute this action on \nbehalf of the Classes.  The Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill \nand experience in civil rights and mental health litigation, who will vigorously prosecute this case \non behalf of the Classes. \n27.  For both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees, HHSC has acted or failed \nor refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entirety of both Classes. \n28.  The claims asserted herein are inherently transitory.  There is a continuing and \nsubstantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of \nPlaintiffs and the Classes. \n29.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs and other members of the Classes seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief and all of the necessary factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present. \n30.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause  individual  litigation  of  these  claims  would  be  impracticable  and  would  be  unduly \nburdensome to the courts.  Further, this suit may be maintained as a class action because common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and \nindividual litigation would increase the likelihood of inconsistent or contradictory judgments.  A \nclass  action  presents  fewer  management  difficulties  and  provides  the  benefits  of  a  single \nadjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 13 of 34\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n31.  Defendant  and  HHSC,  through  their  actions  and  inaction,  cause  incompetent \ndetainees and insanity acquittees to be incarcerated for weeks or months before HHSC provides \nthem their court-ordered competency restoration treatment or evaluation and/or treatment services.  \nA.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit incompetent detainees to an HHSC mental health \nfacility for competency restoration services. \n \n32.  Under state and federal law, individuals who lack the ability to understand the \nnature of the criminal court proceedings against them may not be tried. \n33.  Article 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when a criminal defendantโs mental competency is challenged during \ncriminal proceedings.  \n34.  A person is incompetent to stand trial if he or she does not have โsufficient present \nability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,โ or \nโa rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.โ  TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. art. 46B.003(a)(1)&(2).   \n35.  โEither party may suggest by motion, or the trial court may suggest on its own \nmotion, that the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(a).  โIf the court \ndetermines that there is evidence to support a finding of incompetence, the court . . . shall stay all \nother proceedings in the case.โ  Id., art. 46B.004(d).  โIf the defendant is found incompetent to \nstand trial, the court shall proceed under Subchapter D.โ  Id. \n36.  Pursuant to Subchapter D, article 46B.071, the court, on a determination that a \ncriminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial, shall either commit the defendant to a mental \nhealth facility designated by HHSC under 46B.073, or release the defendant on bail subject to \nconditions under 46B.072.  Id., art. 46B.071. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 14 of 34\n37.  For a defendant not released on bail, the court shall commit a defendant to a mental \nhealth facility or residential care facility for a period not to exceed 60 days (misdemeanor) or 120 \ndays (felony) โfor purposes of further examination and competency restoration services with the \nspecific objective of the defendant attaining competency to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.073(b) \n(emphasis added). \n38.  If a defendant is charged with a โviolent offense,โ as listed in article 17.032(a), \nother than an assault, or the indictment alleges an affirmative finding that a deadly weapon was \nused during the commission of a felony, โthe court shall enter an order committing the defendant \nto the maximum security unit [MSU] of any facility designated by [HHSC] . . ..โ  Id., art. \n46B.073(c).  If the defendant is not charged with one of the enumerated offenses, โthe court shall \nenter an order committing the defendant to a mental health facility or residential care facility . . ..โ  \nId., art. 46B.073(d). \n39.  An order committing the defendant for restoration of competency โmust place the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to \nreceive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.โ  Id., art. 46B.075. \n40.  Not later than the date of the order of commitment, the court must send a copy of \nthe order to the facility to which the defendant is committed.  Id., art. 46B.076(a). \n41.  The facility to which the defendant is committed must: develop an individual \nprogram of treatment; assess and evaluate whether the defendant will obtain competency in the \nforeseeable future; and report to the court and local mental health or intellectual disability authority \non defendantโs progress toward achieving competency.  Id., art. 46B.077(a).   \n42.  Not later than the 15th day before the date on which the restoration period is to \nexpire, the head of the facility must so notify the court that the restoration period is about to expire.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 15 of 34\nId., art. 46B.079(a).  Further, the head of the facility must also โpromptlyโ notify the court when \nthe defendant has obtained competency to stand trial or upon a determination that the defendant \nwill not attain competency in the foreseeable future.  Id., art. 46B.079(b).   \n43.  On the return of the defendant to the court, the court must make a determination as \nto the defendantโs competency to stand trial.  The court must make this determination not later \nthan the 20th day after the court received the notice from the head of the facility required by article \n46B.079. Id., art. 46B.084(a).  If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, criminal \nproceedings may be resumed; if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the court may \ndetermine whether the defendant should be subject to civil commitment. \nB.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity to \nan HHSC mental health facility for evaluation and/or treatment. \n \n44.  Article 46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when the defense of insanity is raised on behalf of a criminal defendant. \n45.  A person is not guilty by reason of insanity if a judge or jury has determined: โ(1) \nthe prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged conduct constituting \nthe offense was committed; and (2) the defense has established by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged conduct.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. \n46C.153(a). \n46.  โ[A] defendant who is found not guilty by reason of insanity stands acquitted of the \noffense charged and may not be considered a person charged with an offense.โ  Id., art. 46C.155(a). \n47.  Since the individual is acquitted of the offense and no longer considered a person \ncharged with an offense, โโฆthe court may [only] order the defendant detained in jail or any other \nsuitable place for a period not to exceed 14 days.โ Id., art. 46C.160(a). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 16 of 34\n48.  Following a finding that an individual is not guilty by reason of insanity, the court \nmust immediately determine whether the offense of which the person was acquitted involved \ndangerous conduct as defined in art. 46C.157.   \n49.  If the court determines that the offense involved dangerous conduct, โ[t]he court \nshall order the acquitted person to be committed for evaluation of the personโs present mental \ncondition and for treatment to the maximum security unit of any facility designated by the \n[HHSC].โ Id., art. 46C.251(a).   \n50.  When  there  is  a  finding  of  dangerous  conduct  and  an  insanity  acquittee  is \ncommitted to an HHSC facility for evaluation and/or treatment services, the facility designated by \nHHSC  receives  a  copy  of  the  transcript  of  all  medical  testimony  and  certain  identifying \ninformation regarding the insanity acquittee. Id., art. 46C.251(b)(1)&(2).   \n51.  Upon transfer of the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by HHSC within 14 \ndays, and following the evaluation and/or treatment of the insanity acquittee, HHSC must file a \nreport that describes and explains the procedure, techniques, and tests used in the examination of \nthe person. Id., art. 46C.252(b).  โThe report must address:  \n(1) whether the acquitted person has a mental illness or [intellectual disability] and, \nif so, whether the mental illness or [intellectual disability] is severe; \n(2) whether as a result of any severe mental illness or [intellectual disability] the \nacquitted person is likely to cause serious harm to another;  \n(3) whether as a result of any impairment the acquitted person is subject to \ncommitment under Subtitle C or D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code;  \n(4) prospective treatment  and supervision  options, if any, appropriate for the \nacquitted person; and  \n(5) whether any required treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively \nprovided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision.โ \n \nId., art. 46C.252(c). \n \n52.  On the return of the insanity acquittee to court, the court shall conduct a hearing on \ndisposition and shall order the acquitted person (i) committed for inpatient treatment or residential \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 17 of 34\ncare, (ii) to receive outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, (iii) transferred to \nan appropriate court for civil commitment proceedings under the Texas Health and Safety Code, \nor (iv) discharged and immediately released.  Id., arts. 46C.253(b)-(e). \nC.  County jails are unable to provide competency restoration services to individuals \nfound  incompetent  to  stand  trial  and  are  unable  to  provide  evaluation  and/or \ntreatment services to individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n \n53.  County jails in Texas are inappropriate settings for the care and treatment of \nindividuals with mental illness or intellectual disabilities (formerly called โmental retardationโ).  \nJails are not designed to be therapeuticโthey are inherently punitiveโnor do they provide any \ntreatment aimed at restoring a person to competency or evaluation and/or treatment services for \nindividuals found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n54.  Correctional facilities, particularly facilities designed for short-term detention, do \nnot have the staffing, funding, or capabilities to provide treatment aimed at restoring a person to \ncompetency or evaluation and/or treatment services for individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity. \n55.  Detainees who are found incompetent to stand trial and detainees who are found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity are often the most severely mentally ill in Texas jail settings. \n56.  Most  Texas  jails  do  not  have  the  ability  to  provide  even  basic  psychiatric \nstabilization and management.  As a result, many detainees with serious mental illness are harmed \nby the punitive jail setting as manifested by either increased symptoms of their underlying \npsychiatric disorders or lack of improvement regarding their current symptoms.  By refusing to \ntimely take custody of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees), Defendant \nand HHSC cause such persons to be incarcerated in county jails under conditions nearly certain to \nexacerbate their mental health conditions. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 18 of 34\n57.  Because county jails are often unable to provide even basic mental health treatment, \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees frequently end up between a rock and a hard place: \neither they are housed in the general jail populationโoften with convicted offendersโor they are \nplaced in solitary confinement, which causes their mental health to further deteriorate.  This \ndeterioration  conflicts  with  the  Stateโs  interest  in  prompt  evaluation  and  treatment  so  that \nincompetent detainees may be brought to trial, or so that insanity acquittees are not punished for \ncrimes they were acquitted of and are appropriately committed, transferred, or released.  \n58.  Besides struggling to provide even basic mental health care, county jails in Texas \ndo not have the specific services necessary to restore individuals to competency to stand trial, such \nas the most current medications, identification of specific social needs to restore and maintain \ncompetency, and training specific to the restoration of competency.  In contrast, state mental health \nfacilities are specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment to restore incompetent detainees \nto competence, thereby enabling them to stand trial.   \n59.  County jails in Texas also do not have the specific services necessary to provide \nevaluation and/or treatment services to insanity acquittees.  State mental health facilities, however, \nare specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment and to conduct evaluations to make \ncomplex determinations about a personโs mental health condition(s), including whether a person \nis likely to cause serious harm to another, whether a person is subject to commitment under the \nTexas Health and Safety Code, and whether prospective treatment and supervision options are \nappropriate, safe, and effective. \n60.  Nevertheless,  Defendant  knowingly,  intentionally,  and  deliberately  refuses  to \naccept individuals found incompetent to stand trial and individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity into state mental health facilities in violation of the requirements of Chapters 46B and \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 19 of 34\n46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the orders of the criminal courts, and the U.S. \nConstitution.        \nD.  Defendant has failed to timely admit incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees \nwho have been ordered to an HHSC mental health facility. \n \n61.  According to a 2014 Joint Report by the National Sheriffsโ Association and the \nTreatment Advocacy Center, โTexas is among the states with the lowest number of public \npsychiatric beds and among the stingiest states in per capita mental health spending.โ  \n62.  In February 2006, due to HHSCโs insufficient forensic capacity, it implemented \nwaiting lists to track detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees) who remain in \njail while waiting for a bed in an HHSC mental health facility.  HHSC created two waiting lists to \nmanage its lack of forensic capacity: the Maximum Security Unit (โMSUโ) Admission List and \nthe Forensic Clearinghouse List.  \n63.  HHSC requires all detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees) \ncommitted to an HHSC mental health facility be placed on one of the waiting lists.  HHSC uses \nthese waiting lists to manage admissions to their HHSC mental health facilities.  Admissions to an \nHHSC mental health facility are made primarily on a first-come, first-served basis, contingent \nupon the capacity of an appropriate HHSC mental health facility.   \n64.  In June of 2014, the number of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees) waiting to be transferred to an HHSC mental health facility was about 170; by February \nof 2016, the number had risen to more than 380.  As of April 1, 2016, the longest wait time for a \nnon-maximum security bed was 122 daysโapproximately four months.  According to HHSC, as \nof April 1, 2016, the average wait time for a maximum-security bed was 275 days, or more than \nnine months.   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 20 of 34\n65.  According to a May 13, 2016 investigative report by ABC-13, state statistics going \nback to 2006 show that the number of detainees waiting in jails for competency restoration \ntreatment โhas never been this long,โ and that the number of individuals on the wait list has grown \nby โ20% in the last six months.โ   \n66.  As of the filing of Plaintiffsโ Third Amended Complaint in September 2017, 283 \nindividuals were waiting in county jails for a maximum-security bed; currently, that number has \nincreased to approximately 463 individuals.  The number of individuals waiting in a county jail \nlonger than twenty-one days for a maximum-security bed has increased from 246 individuals in \nSeptember 2017 to approximately 417 individuals as of January 2019.  The individual who has \nbeen waiting in jail for a maximum security bed the longest has currently been waiting almost 400 \ndaysโover two months longer than the longest wait in September 2017.  As for the waitlist for a \nnon-maximum security bed, the waitlist has nearly tripled from 96 individuals in September 2017 \nto 269 currently waiting in jail for such a bed.  While only four individuals had been waiting longer \nthan twenty-one days in September 2017, that list has climbed to approximately 174 individuals \nwaiting longer than twenty-one days for a non-maximum security bed as of January 2019.  The \nindividual who has been waiting in jail the longest for a non-maximum security bed has been \nwaiting 113 days, which is three times longer than the person waiting the longest at the time of the \nfiling of Plaintiffsโ Third Amended Complaint.   \n67.  The delay in admitting those found incompetent to stand trial infringes on their right \nto be free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction as well as the ability to receive \ncompetency-restoration treatment, which necessarily extends the time within which an individual \ncan be tried once restored to competency.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 21 of 34\n68.  The delay in admitting those found not guilty by reason of insanity infringes on \ntheir right to be free from incarceration after being absolved of criminal responsibility, as well as \ntheir ability to receive evaluation and treatment so that the criminal courts can reach final \ndispositions in their civil commitments.  \n69.  Because incompetent criminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime \nand insanity acquittees have been absolved of criminal responsibility, both classes of persons have \na liberty interest in freedom from incarceration.  Because the detention of incompetent detainees \nis solely for the purpose of restorative treatment and the detention of insanity acquittees is solely \nfor evaluation and/or treatment services, lack of funds, staff, or facilities are not legitimate \ngovernmental purposes that justify the Defendantโs failures. \n70.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, the Individual Plaintiffs and the \nClasses will continue to be deprived of their liberty rights without due process of law, in violation \nof their constitutional rights.   \n71.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Ward to one of \nits mental health facilities; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list.  As a result, he was \nincarcerated in the Harris County Jail for 59 weeks before being admitted to North Texas State \nHospital-Vernon on April 4, 2017.  While in jail, Mr. Ward did not receive competency restoration \ntreatment.   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 22 of 34\n72.  Mr. Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, epilepsy, asthma, and \nhypertension.  Harris County Jail staff noted that Mr. Ward has a history of neurocognitive \nimpairment.  In February 2016, during a mental health assessment, staff noted Mr. Wardโs \nconfusion and inability to remember information such as street names, location, and names of \ndoctors.  Staff noted that โcompetency restoration may be unlikely or slow based on current clinical \npresentation of the assessment.โ    \n73.  Mr. Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he has \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial.  During his most recent incarceration, Mr. Ward requested, \nand voluntarily took, his psychotropic medications; however, he continued to report command \nauditory hallucinations throughout his incarceration. \n74.  Plaintiff Marc Lawson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 390th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about May 11, 2016, Mr. Lawson was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lawson to an HHSC mental health facility.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Lawson to one if \nits mental health facilities; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list.  As a result, he was \nincarcerated in the Travis County Jail for sixty weeks before being admitted to North Texas State \nHospital-Vernon on July 20, 2017.  Mr. Lawson did not receive competency restoration treatment \nin jail. \n75.  Mr. Lawson is twenty-two years old, has never previously been incarcerated, and \nhas been in the Texas Child Protective Services system since age five.  Mr. Lawson is diagnosed \nwith an intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 23 of 34\ndisorder,  bipolar  disorder,  conduct  disorder,  antisocial  personality  disorder,  epilepsy/seizure \ndisorder and Hepatitis C. Mr. Lawson has a history of treatment at psychiatric hospitals and \nreceiving psychotropic medication from a young age.   \n76.  During Mr. Lawsonโs incarceration, jail personnel reported that he had obvious \ncognitive deficits and poor social skills.  He was categorized as vulnerable, and jail personnel \ndocumented concerns over his being housed in a cell with other inmates due to his vulnerability. \nUpon his admission, Mr. Lawson was initially placed in full suicide precaution and/or psychiatric \nlockdown housing for about one week. While in psychiatric lockdown and full suicide precaution \nhousing, Mr. Lawson was permitted outside of his cell for only one hour a day, and it was not \nguaranteed that he would receive any time outdoors.  He was then transferred to and housed in a \nsingle cell for over two months. Mr. Lawson was prescribed two medications for his medical \nconditions and one antipsychotic. The Travis County Jail classified his mental health and medical \nneeds as severe.  \n77.  Mr. Lawsonโs psychiatric evaluation from May 2016 stated that he is incompetent \nto stand trial and โcompetency cannot be restored in the foreseeable future with traditional \ncompetency restoration treatment due to the chronic nature of his condition.โ  The psychiatrist \ndocumented that although he is prescribed psychiatric medication, the medication โwill not \nimprove cognitive symptoms responsible for observed deficits relating to trial competency.โ  \n78.  Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin is a defendant in a criminal case in the 403rd Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about March 31, 2016, Ms. Lampkin was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nThe order also required the Sheriff to transport Ms. Lampkin to an HHSC mental health facility.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 24 of 34\nDespite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Ms. \nLampkin to one of its mental health facilities; instead, she was placed on an HHSC waiting list.  \nAs a result, she was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 65 weeks before being admitted to \nNorth Texas State Hospital-Vernon on July 6, 2017.  Ms. Lampkin did not receive competency \nrestoration treatment in jail.   \n79.  Ms. Lampkin is diagnosed with an intellectual disability and bipolar disorder. She \nalso has a history of psychosis, resulting in numerous emergency psychiatric hospitalizations.  She \nhas a long history of mental illness and has a history of being treated by Austin Travis County \nIntegral Care. \n80.  While incarcerated, Ms. Lampkin exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related to \nher mental health condition.  Records by the jail counselor indicated that Ms. Lampkin has obvious \ncognitive deficits and is low functioning.  Ms. Lampkin was housed exclusively in psychiatric \nhousing and, in July 2016, the jail counselor reported that she is โstruggling due to isolation.โ  \nMoreover, the jail conditions affected Ms. Lampkinโs physical condition.  Over the duration of her \nincarceration, Ms. Lampkin lost over thirty pounds. \n81.  Plaintiff Cecil Adickes was a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about November 7, 2016, Mr. Adickes was found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental \nhealth facility for evaluation of his present mental condition and for treatment.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order and the fourteen-day time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal \nProcedure Article 46C.160, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Adickes to \none if its mental health facilities; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list.  As a result, he \nwas incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for 13 weeks before being admitted to North Texas State \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 25 of 34\nHospital-Vernon on February 9, 2017.  Mr. Adickes did not and could not receive the court-ordered \nevaluation and treatment in jail.  \n82.  Plaintiff Kenneth Jones is a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Harris County, Texas. On or about August 10, 2017, Mr. Jones was found \nincompetent to stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Jones \nto one of its mental health facilities; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list.  As a result, \nhe was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail for 49 weeks before being admitted to Rusk State \nHospital on July 19, 2018.  Mr. Jones did not and could not receive the competency restoration \ntreatment in jail. \n83.  Mr. Jones has a long psychiatric history and has been diagnosed with bipolar \ndisorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. During this recent incarceration, Mr. Jones requested \nand voluntarily took his psychotropic medications; however, in May of 2017, he reported that his \nmedication was not working and that he had become suicidal.  Mr. Jonesโ medications were \nadjusted, but he continued to report visual hallucinations and delusions at the time of the filing of \nPlaintiffsโ Third Amended Complaint.  Mr. Jones also had several altercations with other inmates \nresulting in at least three disciplinary charges. \n84.  Plaintiff Mary Sapp was a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas.   On or about June 22, 2016, Ms. Sapp was found incompetent to \nstand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to transfer Ms. Sapp to one if its mental health \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 26 of 34\nfacilities; instead, she was placed on an HHSC waiting list.  As a result, she was incarcerated for \neight weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on August 23, 2016.  Ms. \nSapp did not and could not receive the competency restoration treatment in jail.    Ms. Sapp spent \nseven months at North Texas State Hospital-Vernon before being restored to competency and \nreturned to Harris County Jail to stand trial. \n85.  On or about May 23, 2017, Ms. Sapp was found not guilty by reason of insanity \nand was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental health facility for evaluation of \nher present mental condition and for treatment. Despite the criminal courtโs order and the fourteen-\nday time limit required by Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46C.160, HHSC did not \nallow Harris County to timely transfer Ms. Sapp to one of its mental health facilities; instead, she \nwas placed on an HHSC waiting list.  As a result, she was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail \nfor 27 weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on December 7, 2017. \nMs. Sapp did not and could not receive the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in jail. \n86.  Ms. Sapp is 68 years old and has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, \nCOPD, diabetes, stage three chronic kidney disease, asthma, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and \nspinal degeneration. Prior to being incarcerated, Ms. Sapp was receiving outpatient psychiatric \nservices.  Ms. Sapp had a number of falls while incarcerated at Harris County Jail and was even \nsent to the infirmary in April of 2017 due to her inability to care for her own activities of daily \nliving.   \n87.  Plaintiff Julian Torres is a defendant in a criminal case in the 5th County Court at \nLaw of Travis County, Texas.  Within five days of his arrest, Mr. Torres was found incompetent \nto stand trial and, on or about April 16, 2019, was ordered to be committed to a mental health \nfacility  for  further  examination  and  treatment  toward  the  specific  objective  of  attaining \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 27 of 34\ncompetency to stand trial. Despite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC has not allowed Travis County \nto transfer Mr. Torres to one of its mental health facilities; instead, he was placed on an HHSC \nwaiting list.  As a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail. Mr. Torres does \nnot receive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n88.  Mr. Torres is diagnosed with schizophrenia.  His mental health condition was so \ndeteriorated that he spent the first week of his incarceration on the acute psychiatric unit at the \nTravis County Correctional Complex.  He has only recently transferred to a single-cell mental \nhealth pod where he spends twenty-two hours a day isolated in his cell.  This is at least the third \ntime Mr. Torres has been found incompetent to stand trial, having spent several months at Austin \nState Hospital in 2017 and Montgomery County Mental Health Treatment Facility in 2018 on \ncompetency restoration commitments.   \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \nA.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Incompetent Detaineesโ Rights \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n \n89.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 88 above are incorporated \nherein. \n90.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n91.  Criminal defendants who have not been convicted and have been adjudicated \nincompetent to stand trial have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and the right not to \nbe punished. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 28 of 34\n92.  To ensure Plaintiffs are not punished, due process requires that the nature and \nduration of confinement bear a reasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is \nconfined. \n93.  Once an individual is found unable to aid and assist in their own defense, all \ncriminal proceedings must stop.  The only stated lawful purpose for their continued confinement \nafter an incompetency determination is commitment for restorative treatment so as to return him \nor her to competency. \n94.  County jails do not provide Plaintiffs with the restorative treatment required by \nstate law.  Instead, only facilities funded by Defendant provide restorative treatment. No legitimate \nstate interest justifies the continued incarceration of incompetent criminal defendants in county \njails for months on end, especially when there are state-mandated, less harsh alternatives. \n95.  Defendantโs insufficient  forensic  capacity  therefore punishes the Plaintiffs by \nforcing them to languish in county jails for months without state-mandated restorative treatment \nbefore being admitted to one its facilities for the state-mandated restorative treatment.  \n96.  The nature and duration of Class Plaintiffsโ and the other members of the Class of \nincompetent detaineesโ incarceration bears no reasonable relation to the restorative purpose for \nwhich the court has committed these individuals, violating their Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights. \n97.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of incompetent detainees \nare entitled to an order of the Court declaring that, by requiring persons found incompetent to stand \ntrial to remain in county jails for protracted periods and by failing to provide restorative treatment \nin a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 29 of 34\n98.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members found incompetent to stand trial.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other Class members are therefore entitled to an order of the Court enjoining Defendant \nfrom further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation to their continued \nincarceration in jail while awaiting a bed at an HHSC mental health facility where they can receive \nthe state-mandated restorative treatment.   \nB.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Insanity Acquitteesโ Rights Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n \n99.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 98 above are incorporated \nherein. \n100.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n101.  Persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, and thereby acquitted \nof criminal charges, have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and the right not to be \npunished. \n102.  To ensure persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity are not \npunished, due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a reasonable \nrelation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n103.  Once an individual is found not guilty by reason of insanity, they have been \nacquitted of the offense charged and cannot remain incarcerated.  The only stated lawful purpose \nfor their continued confinement is commitment to an HHSC mental health facility where they are \nto be provided evaluation and treatment services for their present mental condition, which will \nenable the court to reach final disposition. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 30 of 34\n104.  County jails do not have the resources or expertise to provide the evaluation and/or \ntreatment services mandated by state law.  Instead, only facilities funded by Defendant provide the \nevaluation and/or treatment services mandated by state law. \n105.  No legitimate state interest justifies the incarceration of insanity acquittees in \ncounty jails for months on end, especially when there are state-mandated, less harsh alternatives.  \n106.    Defendantโs insufficient forensic capacity therefore punishes the Plaintiffs by \nforcing them to languish in county jails for months without evaluation and/or treatment services \nbefore being admitted to one of its facilities for the state-mandated evaluation and/or treatment \nservices.  \n107.   The nature and duration of Class Plaintiffsโ and the other members of the Class of \ninsanity acquitteesโ incarceration bears no reasonable relation to the evaluation and/or treatment \npurpose  for  which  the  court  has  committed  insanity  acquittees,  violating  their  Fourteenth \nAmendment due process rights. \n108.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are \nentitled to  an order of  the Court declaring that, by requiring insanity  acquittees to  remain \nincarcerated in county jails for protracted periods and by failing to provide evaluation and/or \ntreatment in a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n109.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are therefore entitled to an order of the \nCourt enjoining Defendant from further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 31 of 34\nto their continued confinement while awaiting evaluation and/or treatment at an HHSC mental \nhealth facility.   \nATTORNEYโS FEES \n110.  Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE: Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to: \nA.

Enter an Order declaring that, by requiring Class Plaintiffs and the other members \nof the Class who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity to remain \nincarcerated in county jails for more than fourteen days before making a bed \navailable to them at an HHSC mental health facility for evaluation and/or treatment \nservices,  Defendant  is  depriving  them  of  their  due  process  rights  under  the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in violation of state \nlaw; \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 97   Filed 05/09/19   Page 32 of 34\nD.

HHSC oversees state hospitals and behavioral health programs.   \n \n2.  HHSC does not have sufficient capacity to admit all incompetent to stand trial (โISTโ) \ndetainees committed to its care for competency restoration services immediately upon their \ncommitment.   \n \n3.  HHSCโs  mental health facilities1 have  staff specially trained to  provide competency \nrestoration services.   \n \n4.  HHSCโs mental health facilities provide evaluations and treatment for persons found \nNGRI.   \n  \n5.  Defendant operates a forensic Clearinghouse waitlist for persons who are incompetent to \nstand trial and committed to a non-maximum security unit (โMSUโ) facility.   \n \n                                                            \n1 โHHSC forensic mental health facilitiesโ means, any facility that HHSC operates, contracts with, or funds that admits \npersons under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46B or Article 46C. \n\n6.  Persons placed on the Clearinghouse waitlist are removed from the list and admitted to an \nHHSC inpatient mental health facility generally on a first-come, first-served basis.   \n \n7.  Defendant operates an MSU waitlist for individuals found incompetent to stand trial and \nNGRI who are committed to an MSU facility, and for civil committees found โmanifestly \ndangerous.โ   \n \n8.  Persons placed on the MSU waitlist are removed from the list, and admitted to an HHSC \nmental health facility generally on a first-come, first-serve basis.   \n \n9.  The MSU waitlist includes the individualโs name, the county the individual is coming from, \nthe type of commitment, the date HHSC was notified the order of commitment was signed, \nand the number of days since HHSC was notified to the present (if still waiting) or the total \nnumber of days between notification and the personโs admission to an HHSC mental health \nfacility (if no longer waiting).   \n \n10.  The Clearinghouse waitlist also contains the date HHSC is notified an individual is \ncommitted for competency restoration treatment and the number of days from the date of \nnotification to the present (if the individual is still waiting) or the total number of days \nbetween notification and their admission to an HHSC mental health facility (if no longer \nwaiting).   \n \n11.  There are no formal criteria for determining the distribution of forensic versus civil beds.  \n \n12.  The Texas Legislature has given HHSC the discretion to determine how to divide the total \nnumber of HHSC inpatient mental health beds between the civil and forensic population.  \n \n13.  Adult, general, psychiatric beds can be used for patients on  either  forensic  or  civil \ncommitments or voluntary admissions.  \n \n14.  Presently, i.e., as of the date of this filing, HHSC has approximately 2,870 inpatient mental \nhealth beds for forensic and civil commitments.   \n \nUNCONTESTED ISSUES OF LAW RELATED TO IST AND NGRI DETAINEES \n \n1.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46B sets forth the legal standard and process for \na courtโs finding an individual incompetent to stand trial.  \n \n2.  When a person is found incompetent to stand trial, the criminal proceedings against him or \nher are stayed.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art 46B.004(d). \n \n3.  When a person is found incompetent to stand trial, the court shall either commit the \ndefendant to a mental health facility designated by HHSC under TCCP 46B.073 or release \nthe defendant on bail subject to conditions under 46B.072.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Art. \n46B.071. \n \n2 \n \n\n4.  Under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 46B, a defendant found incompetent to \nstand trial and not released on bail shall be committed to a mental health facility โ[f]or \npurposes of further examination and competency restoration services with the specific \nobjective of the defendant attaining competency to stand trialโฆ.โ Tex. Crim. Proc. Code \nAnn. ยง 46B.073(b). \n \n5.  An  order  committing  the  defendant  for  restoration  of  competency  โmust  place  the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the \ndefendant is to receive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.โ  Tex. Code \nCrim. Proc. Art. 46B.075. \n \n6.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46B also sets forth obligations of the HHSC \nmental  health  facilities  to  which  incompetent  defendants  are  committed  concerning \nindividualized  treatment  programs,  assessments  and  evaluations,  and  reports  to  the \ncriminal court.  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Arts. 46B.077; 46B.079-46B.080. \n \n7.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46C sets forth the legal standard and process for \na courtโs finding an individual not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI).   \n \n8.  Under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 46C, when a defendant is acquitted as not \nguilty by reason of insanity of a crime involving dangerous conduct the court โshall order \nthe  acquitted  person  to  be  committed  for  evaluation  of  the  personโs  present  mental \ncondition and for treatment to the maximum security unit of any facility designated by the \ndepartment.โ Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. ยง 46C.251(a). \n \n9.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46C.160(1) provides that the court can order an \ninsanity acquittee detained in jail or other suitable place โfor a period not to exceed fourteen \ndays.โ   \n \n10.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46C also sets forth obligations of the HHSC \nmental  health  facilities  to  which  insanity  acquittees  are  committed  concerning  the \nacquitteeโ s evaluation, treatment, and report to the court.

Introduction to the Classes and Requested Relief \n \n1.  Plaintiffs have defined their proposed Incompetent to Stand Trial (โISTโ) class as \nโall persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a Texas crime, (b) court-ordered \nto an HHSC mental health facility for competency restoration services; but, (c) because of HHSCโs \ninsufficient forensic capacity, (d) remain incarcerated in a county jail more than 21 days from the \nday HHSC receives the court order to the day HHSC makes a bed available in an HHSC mental \nhealth facility.1โ Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, Doc. No. 104 (hereinafter โP. Mot. \nDoc. No. 104โ), at 19.   \n                                                            \n1 โHHSC forensic mental health facilitiesโ means any facility that HHSC operates, contracts with, \nor funds that admits persons under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46B or Article \n46C. \n\n2.  Plaintiffs have defined their proposed Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (โNGRIโ) \nclass as โall persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a Texas crime and \nfound not guilty by reason of insanity, (b) ordered to receive evaluation and/or treatment services \nat an HHSC mental health facility, but, (c) due to HHSCโs insufficient forensic capacity (d) remain \nincarcerated in a county jail more than 14 days from the day HHSC receives the court order to the \nday HHSC makes a bed available in an HHSC mental health facility.โ P. Mot. Doc. No. 104, at \n19. \n3.  Plaintiffs do not request monetary damages, only injunctive and declaratory relief.  \nPlaintiffsโ Fifth Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (hereinafter โP. Comp. \nDoc.  No.  97โ),  at  31-32;  Defendantโs  Answer  and  Defenses  to  Plaintiffsโ  Fifth  Amended \nComplaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief, Doc. No. 98 (hereinafter โD. Ans. Doc. No. 98โ), \nat ยถ 20. \n4.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin HHSC from failing to make a bed available for persons \nfound incompetent to stand trial and ordered to an HHSC mental health facility no later than 21 \ndays from the date HHSC receives notice of a criminal court's commitment order under Chapter \n46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.  P. Comp. Doc. No. 97, at 32. \n5.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin HHSC from failing to make a bed available for persons \nfound not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to an HHSC mental health facility no later than \n14 days from the date HHSC receives notice of a criminal court's commitment order under Chapter \n46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.  P. Comp. Doc. No. 97, at 31. \n2 \n\nII.  Framework for Detention of Incompetency Detainees  \n \n6.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46B sets forth the legal standard and \nprocess for a courtโs finding a person incompetent to stand trial (โISTโ). P. Comp. Doc. No. 97, at \nยถยถ 33-43; D. Ans. Doc. No. 98, at ยถยถ 31-34. \n7.  Once a person is found incompetent to stand trial, the criminal proceedings against \nhim or her are stayed.  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.004(d); D. Ans. Doc. No. 98, at ยถ 34. \n8.  After an incompetency determination is made, the only purpose for the detaineeโs \ncontinued detention is the competency restoration treatment and education services mandated in \nthe Texas Code of Criminal Procedure for all defendants found incompetent to stand trial.  Report \nand Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge, Doc.  No. 49 (hereinafter โMag. R & \nR. Doc. No. 49โ),2 at 4-5 (โGiven Texas lawโs stated purpose for their detention, this means the \nnature and duration of [Plaintiffsโ] confinement must bear a reasonable relation to their receiving \nrestorativeโฆtreatment.โ); TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.073(b).  \n9.  Competency restoration services can be provided in one of only three settings: (1) \non an outpatient basis as a condition of bail, (2) in one of five jail-based competency restoration \nprograms, or (3) in an HHSC mental health facility.  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.071(a).   \n10.  HHSC has no discretion over which incompetency detainees criminal courts order \ninto its mental health facilities and which are released on outpatient restoration commitments or \nreferred to the jail-based competency restoration programs.  April 18, 2019 Deposition of Timothy \nBray, attached as Exhibit A to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 (hereinafter โBray Dep., P. Mot. Ex. A, Doc. \nNo. 104-2โ), at 42:16-25.   \n                                                            \n2 Approved and accepted on June 14, 2017 in โOrder on Report and Recommendation,โ Doc. No. \n50, following no objection from Defendant. \n3 \n\n11.  A courtโs ability to release an incompetent detainee to an outpatient commitment is \nbased on the alleged crime, the availability of an outpatient commitment program, and whether \noutpatient treatment is appropriate.  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. arts. 46B.071, 46B.0711, & 46B.072. \n12.  There are only 11 outpatient competency restoration programs, serving individuals \nincarcerated in 35 counties, in the entire state of Texas.  Defendantโs Objections & Answers to \nPlaintiffsโ First Set of Interrogatories (2017), attached as Exhibit K to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 \n(hereinafter โD. Ans. 2017 Int., P. Mot. Ex. K, Doc. No. 104-12โ), # 11. \n13.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 46B.091 sets out the standard in Texas for \njail-based  competency  restoration  services.    Jail-based  competency  restoration  services  are \nrequired to (1) โprovide jail-based competency restoration services through the use of a multi-\ndisciplinary  treatment  team  that  are  directed  toward  the  specific  objective  of  restoring  the \ndefendantโs competency to stand trial,โ (2) provide the competency restoration services through \nlicensed or qualified mental-health professionals, (3) โprovide weekly competency restoration \nhours commensurate to the hours provided as part of the competency restoration program at an \ninpatient mental health facility,โ and (4) operate in a โdesignated space that is separate from the \nspace used for the general population of the jail.โ  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.091(d)(1), (3)โ\n5). \n14.  Only five jails in TexasโDallas County Jail, Tarrant County Jail, Lubbock County \nJail, Midland County Jail, and Nueces County Jailโoperate jail-based competency restoration \nprograms.  P. Mot. Doc. No. 104, at 5. \n15.  Outside of the five jails that operate formal jail-based competency restoration \nprograms in a designated space separate from other inmates, the remaining jails in Texas are not \nrequired by law to provide, nor do they provide, competency restoration services.  Declaration of \n4 \n\nMelissa Shearer, attached as Exhibit C to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 (hereinafter โShearer Dec., P. Mot. \nEx. C, Doc. No. 104-4โ), at ยถ 7; Declaration of Floyd Jennings, attached as Exhibit D to P. Mot. \nDoc. No. 104 (hereinafter โJennings Dec., P. Mot. Ex. D, Doc.

No. 104-8โ), at ยถ 11; Declaration of Krista Chacona, attached as Exhibit \nH to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 (hereinafter โChacona Dec., P. Mot. Ex. H, Doc. No. 104-9โ), at ยถ 7; \nDeclaration of Daniel Smith of Travis County Jail, attached as Exhibit I to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 \n(hereinafter โTravis County Jail Dec., P. Mot. Ex. I, Doc. No. 104-10โ), at ยถยถ 2 - 4; Declaration of \nLaxman Sunder, M.D. of Harris County Jail, attached as Exhibit J to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 \n(hereinafter โHarris County Jail Dec., P. Mot. Ex. J, Doc. No. 104-11โ), at ยถยถ 2 - 4. \n16.  Under  Texas  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  article  46B,  a  defendant  found \nincompetent to stand trial and not released on an outpatient commitment or committed to a jail-\nbased competency restoration program shall be committed to a mental health facility โ[f]or \npurposes of further examination and competency restoration services with the specific objective \nof the defendant attaining competency to stand trialโฆ.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. ยง 46B.073(b); \nD. Ans. Doc. No. 98, at ยถ 37. \n17.  For incompetency detainees not released on outpatient commitments or committed \nto one of the five jail-based programs, HHSC is the sole entity responsible for providing IST \ndetainees the specialized competency restoration treatment that justifies their continued detention.  \nTEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.0021. \n5 \n\n18.  Unlike  Texas  jails  (excluding  the  five  with  formal  jail-based  competency \nrestoration programs), HHSCโs mental health facilities have staff specially trained to provide \ncompetency restoration services and do provide these services.  April 15, 2019 Deposition of \nMichael Maples, attached as Exhibit B to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 (hereinafter โMaples Dep., P. Mot. \nEx. B, Doc. No. 104-3โ), at 104:13-23; D. Ans. Doc. No. 98, at ยถยถ 58-59. \n19.  The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides that where there is credible \nevidence of restoration of an incompetency detainee while they are awaiting a bed at an HHSC \nmental health facility, the court can have the individual re-evaluated.  If the individual is restored, \nthe court withdraws the order for transport to an HHSC mental health facility and criminal \nproceedings resume against the defendant.  Thus, where an individual is restored while awaiting \ntransport, he or she is never ultimately transported to an HHSC mental health facility.  TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. art. 46B.0755. \nIII.  Framework for Detention of NGRI Acquittees \n \n20.  Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46C sets forth the legal standard and \nprocess for a courtโs finding a person not guilty by reason of insanity (โNGRIโ).  P. Comp. Doc. \nNo. 97, at ยถยถ 44-52; D. Ans. Doc. No. 98, at  ยถยถ 44-46, 48-52. \n21.  At the conclusion of a criminal case, when a court determines a person is NGRI, he \nor she โstands acquitted of the offense charged and may not be considered a person charged with \nan offense.โ  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.155(a).   \n22.  After a person is found NGRI, the only justification for the acquitteeโs continued \nconfinement is to evaluate the acquittee to determine the appropriateness of continued confinement \nand treatment. Mag. R & R. Doc. No. 49 at 4-5 (โGiven Texas lawโs stated purpose for their \ndetention,  this  means  the nature and duration of their confinement  must  bear a reasonable \n6 \n\nrelationship to their receivingโฆevaluative treatment.โ); TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.251 \n(entitled โCommitment for Evaluation and Treatment, Reportโ (emphasis added). \n23.  Immediately upon a finding that a person is NGRI, the court must determine \nwhether the offense for which the person was acquitted concerned โdangerous conductโ as defined \nin subchapter 46C.  TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.157. \n24.  Under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 46C, when a defendant is acquitted \nas not guilty by reason of insanity of a crime involving dangerous conduct, the court โshall order \nthe acquitted person to be committed for evaluation of the person's present mental condition and \nfor treatment to the maximum security unit of any facility designated by [HHSC].โ TEX. CODE \nCRIM. PROC. ยง 46C.251(a); D. Ans. Doc. No. 98, at ยถ 2, 49.3 \n25.  Because the acquittee has not been convicted and is no longer charged, the court \nmay order the acquittee detained in jail for no more than 14 days pending transfer to a maximum-\nsecurity HHSC mental health facility.   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. arts. 46C.160(a); 46C.251(a). \n26.  Texas jails are not required to provide, nor do they provide, NGRI evaluation or \ntreatment.   Rodriguez Dec., P. Mot. Ex. E, Doc. No. 104-6, at ยถ 11; Craven Dec. Ex. G, P. Mot., \nDoc. No. 104-8, at ยถ 11; Travis County Jail Dec., P. Mot. Ex. I, Doc. No. 104-10, at ยถ 5; Harris \nCounty Jail Dec., P. Mot. Ex. J, Doc. No. 104-11, at ยถ 5. \n27.  HHSC is the sole entity responsible for providing NGRI acquittees the specialized \nNGRI evaluation and treatment mandated by the Code of Criminal Procedure. TEX. CODE CRIM. \nPROC. art. 46C.0011. \n                                                            \n3 TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ยง 46C.251(a) was amended by Acts 2019, 86th Leg., ch. 1212 (S.B. \n562), ยง 17, eff. June 14, 2019, and now allows the โacquitted person to be committed for evaluation \nof the personโs present mental condition and for treatment to the facility designated by [HHSC].โ \n7 \n\n28.  Unlike  Texas  jails,  HHSCโs  mental  health  facilities  provide  evaluations  and \ntreatment for persons found NGRI.  Maples Dep., P. Mot. Ex. B, Doc. No. 104-3, at 105:9-20; D. \nAns. Doc. No. 98, at ยถยถ 58-59. \nIV.  HHSC and Texasโs Mental Health System \n  \n29.  The HHSC Executive Commissioner has final authority for all matters related to \nthe state hospitals.  D. Ans. 2017 Int., P. Mot. Ex. K, Doc. No. 104-12, # 5, # 13. \n30.  HHSC is responsible for overseeing state hospitals and behavioral health programs.  \nUncontested Facts and Issues of Law, Doc. No. 99 (hereinafter โUncontested Doc. No. 99โ), at \nFacts ยถ 1. \n31.  HHSC has the authority to contract with private facilities for additional state-funded \nmental health beds for forensic and civil commitments and to provide funding to Local Mental \nHealth Authorities to purchase additional mental health beds in local private facilities for forensic \nand civil commitments.  Declaration of Timothy Bray, attached as Exhibit A to Defendantโs \nResponse to Plaintiffsโ Motion for Class Certification, Doc. No. 110 (hereinafter โBray Dec., D. \nResp. Ex. A, Doc. No. 110-1โ), at 4. \n32.  In 2016, HHSC had 2,998 inpatient mental health beds for forensic and civil \ncommitments. Maples Dep., P. Mot. Ex. B, Doc. No. 104-3, at 66:24 โ 68:10. \n33.  HHSC currently only has 2,870 inpatient mental health beds for forensic and civil \ncommitments.  Uncontested Doc. No. 99, at Facts ยถ 14.   \n34.  This 2,870 beds is 128 less than HHSC had in 2016.  Maples Dep., P. Mot. Ex. B, \nDoc. No. 104-3, at 66:24 โ 68:10. \n8 \n\n35.  HHSCโs struggle to hire and retain sufficient staff and infrastructure concerns were \nthe causes of the reduction of the available beds within the system. Maples Dep., P. Mot. Ex. B, \nDoc. No. 104-3, at 73:23 โ 78:24. \n36.  Of the 2,870 inpatient mental health beds, 2,269 of those beds are state hospital \nbeds. Maples Dep., P. Mot. Ex. B, Doc. No. 104-3, at 68:18-23. \n37.  The Texas Legislature has given HHSC the discretion to determine how to allocate \nthe total number of HHSC state hospital beds between the forensic and non-forensic populations.  \nUncontested Doc. No. 99, at Facts ยถ 12; Bray Dep., P. Mot. Ex. A, Doc. No. 104-2, at 17:7 โ 18:1.   \n38.  HHSC has no formal criteria for determining the allocation of forensic versus non-\nforensic beds, and any adult, general psychiatric bed in one of HHSCโs state hospitals can be used \nfor either population.  Uncontested Doc. No. 99, at Facts ยถยถ 11, 13; D. Ans. 2017 Int., P. Mot. Ex. \nK, Doc. No. 104-12, # 2, # 13. \n39.  Over the last twenty years, HHSC has used its discretion and shifted its allocation \nof state hospital beds between the forensic and non-forensic populations.  Forensic Waitlists for \nState Mental Hospitals: February 2006 โ January 2016 attached as Exhibit L to P. Mot. Doc. No. \n104 (hereinafter โForensic Waitlists 2006 โ 2016, P. Mot. Ex. L, Doc. No. 104-13โ); Bray Dep., \nP. Mot. Ex. A, Doc. No. 104-2, at 19:19-21.   \n40.  Of  the  current  2,269  state  hospital  beds,  HHSC  has  designated  1,474  beds \n(approximately 65%) for forensic commitments and 794 beds (approximately 35%) for non-\nforensic commitments. Bray Dec., D. Resp. Ex. A, Doc. No. 110-1, at ยถ 2. \n41.  For more than a decade, HHSC has failed to ensure consistent, sufficient forensic \ncapacity within its mental health facilities (both contracted and state hospital beds) to admit every \ndetainee found IST within 21 days of receiving notice of the detaineeโs commitment or to admit \n9 \n\nevery NGRI acquittee within 14 days of receiving the notice of the acquitteeโs commitment.  โState \nHospital Forensic Waitlistโ Chart, attached as Exhibit M to Mot. for Class Cert., ECF No. 104 \n(hereinafter โState Hospital Forensic Waitlist, P. Mot. Ex. M, Doc. No. 104-14โ).    \n42.  To manage the flow of forensic commitments, which exceeded the number of beds \nHHSC designated โforensicโ in its mental health facilities, HHSC made a deliberate choice in 2006 \nto create two waitlists, the Clearinghouse waitlist and the Maximum Security Unit Admission list \n(โMSU waitlistโ).  D. Ans. 2017 Int., P. Mot. Ex. K, Doc. No. 104-12, #5.   \n43.  Defendant operates the Clearinghouse waitlist for persons who are found IST and \ncommitted by a criminal court to a non-Maximum Security Unit at an HHSC mental health facility.  \nUncontested Doc. No. 99, at Facts ยถ 5; D. Ans. Doc. No. 98, at ยถ 5.   \n44.  Defendant operates the MSU waitlist for persons found IST and committed to an HHSC \nMSU facility, NGRI acquittees committed to an HHSC mental health facility, and civil committees \nfound โmanifestly dangerous.โ  Uncontested Doc.

If an individual on the MSU waitlist is not waiting in jail because he or she is, for \nexample, bonded out, the MSU waitlist indicates that fact.  MSU Census Spreadsheet, P. Mot. Ex. \nN, Doc.

Of the thousands of individuals placed on the MSU waitlist between October 2017 \nand January 2, 2019, only 9 were bonded out and therefore remained on the waitlist, but were not \nin jail.  MSU Census Spreadsheet, P. Mot. Ex. N, Doc. No. 104-15. \n60.

In the interim, during Fiscal years 2012-2014, HHSC was able to ensure that \npersons committed to a non-MSU at an HHSC mental health facility waited less than 21 days on \nits waitlist.  D. Ans. 2017 Int., P. Mot. Ex. K, Doc. No. 104-12, #8; Bray Dep., P. Mot. Ex. A, Doc. \nNo. 104-2, at 50:13-19. \n66.  During Fiscal Years 2013-2014, HHSC was able to ensure that persons committed \nto an MSU at an HHSC mental health facility waited less than 21 days on its waitlist. D. Ans. 2017 \nInt., P. Mot. Ex. K, Doc. No. 104-12, #8; Bray Dep., P. Mot. Ex. A, Doc. No. 104-2, at 50:20 โ \n51:12. \n67.  The second time HHSC demonstrated that it is capable of curing the violations \nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin occurred when Plaintiff filed the instant action on July 29, 2016.  At the \ntime the Complaint was filed, persons on the Clearinghouse waitlist waited an average of 41 days.  \nPlaintiffsโ Original Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Doc.

HHSC accomplished these temporary decreases in the average wait on its waitlists \nby  prioritizing  forensic  commitments  over  non-forensic  commitments,  i.e.,  shifting  the  bed \nallocation to designate more beds within the mental health facilities for forensic patients and fewer \n14 \n\nfor non-forensic, adding additional beds, and increasing staffing.  D. Ans. 2017 Int., P. Mot. Ex. \nK, Doc. No. 104-12, #8, 9; Bray Dep., P. Mot. Ex. A, Doc. No. 104-2, at 54:23 โ 55:20. \n70.  The current waitlists demonstrate that HHSC will not voluntarily continue to timely \nadmit IST detainees and NGRI acquittees absent court intervention. MSU Census Spreadsheet, P. \nMot. Ex. N, Doc. No. 104-15. \n71.  Since the creation of the waiting lists, the overall trajectory has been upwardโwith \nmore and more people waiting on the lists longer than 21 or 14 days.  State Hospital Forensic \nWaitlist, P. Mot. Ex. M, Doc. No. 104-14.   \n72.  As of March 15, 2019, there were 771 individuals on HHSCโs forensic waitlists, 81 \npercent of whom (625 individuals) remained incarcerated in county jails for more than 21 days \nfrom the day HHSC received the court order to the day it notified the jail that the person could be \nadmitted to an HHSC facility.

Monthly \nWaitlist Update, P. Mot. Ex. Q, Doc. No. 104-18.   \n74.  As of March 15, 2019, there were 318 detainees found IST and placed on HHSCโs \nClearinghouse waitlist.  Of the 318 detainees on the Clearinghouse waitlist, 58 percent (186 \ndetainees) remained incarcerated in county jails for more than 21 days from the day HHSC \nreceived the court order to the day it notified the jail that the person could be admitted to an HHSC \nfacility.

Rather than admit him into one of its mental health facilities within 21 days of his \ncourt order, HHSC placed Plaintiff Ward on one of its waitlists.  Jennings Dec., P. Mot. Ex. D, \nDoc. No. 104-5, at ยถ 6.   \n78.  HHSC admitted Plaintiff Ward to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon more than 21 \ndays after he was found incompetent to stand trial.  He ultimately waited 58 weeks from the date \nof HHSCโs notification to the date HHSC made a bed available in one of its mental health facilities.  \nDef. Ans. 2019 Int., P. Mot. Ex. O, Doc.

No. 104-5, at ยถ 7. \n81.  Plaintiff Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, epilepsy, asthma, \nand hypertension.  Harris County Jail staff noted that Plaintiff Ward has a history of neurocognitive \n16 \n\nimpairment and observed his confusion and inability to remember information such as street \nnames, locations, and names of doctors.  Jennings Dec., P. Mot. Ex. D, Doc. No. 104-5, at ยถ 8. \n82.  Plaintiff Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he \nhad been found incompetent to stand trial.  Jennings Dec., P. Mot. Ex. D, Doc. No. 104-5, at ยถ 8. \n83.  While awaiting transfer to an HHSC mental health facility, Plaintiff Ward requested \nand voluntarily took his psychotropic mediations; however, he continued to report command \nauditory hallucinations throughout his incarceration.  Jennings Dec., P. Mot. Ex. D, Doc. No. 104-\n5, at ยถ 8. \n84.  Plaintiff Ward suffered deterioration during his 58 week wait in Harris County Jail \nfor admission to an HHSC mental health facility due to isolation and enforced idleness.  Jennings \nDec., P. Mot. Ex. D, Doc. No. 104-5, at ยถ 12.   \n85.  Plaintiff Ward was also injured by his lengthy wait for admission to a mental health \nfacility in that he was forced to remain confined in a jail without receiving the state-mandated \ncompetency restoration services while the criminal process against him was stayed.  This delay in \ntreatment  necessarily  lengthened  the  time  within  which he  could  be  tried  once  restored  to \ncompetency.  This delay also unfairly prolonged his criminal case, making it difficult for his \nattorney to adequately represent him, identify witnesses, and to enter into plea negotiations.  \nJennings Dec., P.

Plaintiff Lawson has been diagnosed with an intellectual disability, pervasive \ndevelopmental  disorders,  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder,  bipolar  disorder,  conduct \ndisorder, antisocial personality disorder, epilepsy/seizure disorder, and Hepatitis C.  During Mr. \nLawsonโs incarceration in Travis County Jail, jail personnel reported that he had obvious cognitive \ndeficits and poor social skills.  He was categorized as vulnerable, and jail personnel documented \nconcerns over his being housed in a cell with other inmates due to his vulnerability.  The Travis \nCounty Jail classified his mental health and medical needs as severe.  Chacona Dec., P. Mot. Ex. \nH, Doc. No. 104-9, at ยถ 5. \n92.

Chacona Dec., P. Mot. Ex. H, Doc. No. 104-9, at ยถ 5. \n18 \n\n93.  Plaintiff Lawson was additionally injured by his lengthy wait for admission to a \nmental health facility in that he was forced to remain confined in a jail without receiving the state-\nmandated competency restoration services while the criminal process against him was stayed.  This \ndelay in treatment necessarily lengthened the time within which he could be tried once restored to \ncompetency or have his charges dismissed after a determination that there is no substantial \nprobability that, in the foreseeable future, he will regain competency to stand trial.  This delay also \nnecessarily resulted in a delay of the statutorily required evaluation that is given to determine \nwhether there is a substantial probability that, in the foreseeable future, Mr. Lawson would regain \ncompetency to stand trial.  This delay also unfairly prolonged his criminal case, making it difficult \nfor his attorney to adequately represent him, identify witnesses, and to enter into plea negotiations.  \nChacona Dec., P.

Plaintiff Torres was also injured by his lengthy wait for admission to a mental \nhealth facility in that he was forced to remain confined in a jail without receiving the state-\nmandated competency restoration services while the criminal process against him was stayed.

Harms  suffered  by  proposed  class  members  in  addition  to  the  continued, \nunconstitutional deprivation of their liberty \n \n169.  Acute psychosis, or the presence of severe, acute, and often florid psychosis, is by \nfar the most common ground of incompetency to stand trial.  Such disorders are often treatable in \nrelatively short order if and only if a defendant is (1) examined by a psychiatrist or similarly \nqualified provider, (2) prescribed appropriate medication, usually an antipsychotic, if needed, and \n(3) willing to take medication as prescribed.  In addition, such individuals require other appropriate \nforms of treatment such as individual and group psychotherapy and milieu therapy that takes place \nin a truly therapeutic environment.  It is also important that individuals be in a situation in which \nthey feel safe, to prevent destabilization and/or regression.  Declaration of Joel A. Dvoskin, Ph.D. \nattached as Exhibit S to P. Mot. Doc. No. 104 (hereinafter โDvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. \n104-20โ), at ยถ 11 (emphasis added). \n170.  Many jails lack adequate psychiatric, psychological, social work, and nursing \nservices,  thereby  decreasing  the  likelihood  that  prescribed  medications  will  be  appropriate, \neffective, and taken by the patient as prescribed.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, \nat ยถ 12(i). \n171.  In fact, many jails provide no meaningful mental health treatment at all.  Dvoskin \nDec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถ 17. \n172.  Few if any jails are able to create a therapeutic environment in which an inmate \nfeels like a patient.  The failure to create such a setting precludes the detainee from viewing the \n33 \n\nhealth and mental health care professionals as doctors or nurses who care about them.  Indeed, \nmany jails specifically avoid trying to create such an environment because they need to focus on \nmaintaining security, which they rightly view as their primary objective.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. \nEx. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถ 12(ii). \n173.  Effective psychiatric treatment must be individualizedโa truth that is in direct \nconflict with correctional goals.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถ 12(iii). \n174.  Jails  are  seldom  seen  as  a  safe  place  by  inmates  and  detainees.    Inmatesโ \nunderstandable fears for their own safety can make them loathe to accept psychotropic medication, \nwhich will tranquilize them and leave them less alert and less vigilant in the event they need to \ndefend themselves.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถ 12(iv). \n175.  Many jails are insensitive to the frequent minor disciplinary violations (e.g., being \nout of place, failing to obey a direct order) that usually accompany psychosis, treating such \ninfractions as if they are intentional rule violations.  As a result, inmates with serious mental illness \ncommonly  comprise  a  disproportionate  number  of  inmates  in  lockdown  settings  such  as \nadministrative or disciplinary (punitive) segregation.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-\n20, at ยถ 12(vi). \n176.  There is virtual unanimity among experts that segregation should be avoided for \nany inmate or detainee who suffers from acute symptoms of serious mental illness such as severe \ndepression or psychosis. Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถ 12(vii). \n177.  Individuals with mental disabilities are frequently placed in segregation or solitary \nconfinement where their liberty, freedom of movement, and social interaction are extremely \nlimited and which, as an even more restrictive correctional setting, can accelerate decompensation.  \nDvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถยถ 12(vi), 12(vii). \n34 \n\n178.  Solitary confinement, or 22- to 23-hour per day lock-down, is not therapeutic and \ndisproportionately impacts inmates with mental illness as the isolation only exacerbates their \nconditions.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถยถ 12(vi), 12(vii). \n179.  The vast majority of American jails have grossly inadequate psychiatric and mental \nhealth services, causing inmates to decompensate rapidly.  These exacerbations of serious mental \nillness can cause defendants to harm themselves, to experience more severe hallucinations and \ndelusions, and to disrupt the other inmates and detainees who sometimes respond with violence \ntoward the person with mental illness.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถ 12(ix). \n180.  Research has demonstrated that allowing patients to experience acute and untreated \npsychosis can have a long-term, and possibly permanent, negative effect on the trajectory of the \npersonโs illness; moreover, a long period of untreated psychosis is especially associated with worse \nlong-term outcomes in people with first-episode psychosis.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. \nNo. 104-20, at ยถ 14. \n181.  Psychotic pretrial detainees are likely to remain psychotic longer if housed in a jail \nthan if housed in a modern, competently-run psychiatric hospital.  Accordingly, the standard of \ncare for incompetent defendants who remain in custody in virtually all jurisdictions is transfer to \na state forensic psychiatric hospital which provides a therapeutic environment and milieu, among \nother characteristics.  Dvoskin Dec., P. Mot. Ex. S, Doc. No. 104-20, at ยถ 13. \n182.  The delay in detaineesโ receiving competency restoration treatment caused by their \nremaining  in  jail  lengthens  the  time  within  which  detainees  can  be  tried  once  restored  to \ncompetency or have their charges dismissed after a determination that there is no substantial \nprobability in the foreseeable future they will regain competency to stand trial.

The delay in competency restoration treatment prolongs the detaineesโ criminal \ncases, making it more difficult for their attorneys to adequately represent them after they are \nrestored to competency, to identify witnesses, and to enter into plea negotiations.

Appx. 236, 242-43 (5th Cir. 2018). \n2.  Named Plaintiffs and putative class members have standing to assert their claims.   \nII.  Applicable Law \n \nA.  Substantive Due Process Framework \n \n3.  โ[I]t is not necessary to decide the appropriate standard to employ on the merits in \norder to determine the appropriateness of class certification. In considering class certification the \nrelevant question is whether the Plaintiffsโ claim, under either [the deliberate indifference or \nreasonable relation] standard, will turn on common questions of fact or law.โ  Perry 294 F.R.D. at \n36. \n4.  However, the Fifth Circuitโs ruling in Hare v. City of Corinth, 74 F.3d 633, 647โ\n48 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc) articulates the standard to apply in cases brought by pretrial detainees. \nNerren v. Livingston Police Dept., 86 F.3d 469, 473 n. 25 (5th Cir.1996).   \n5.  Cases brought by pretrial detainees may be brought as an attack on a โcondition of \nconfinementโ or as an โepisodic act or omission.โ  Hare, 74 F.3d at 644โ45.   \n6.  When a plaintiff is challenging a condition of confinement, as Plaintiffs do in this \ncase, this Court applies the test established by the Supreme Court in Bell v. Wolfish. See id at 646.  \n43 \n\nOnly when a plaintiff is challenging an episodic act or omission does the deliberate indifference \nstandard apply.  Id. at 647โ48 \n7.  Since this case challenges general practices or polices of pretrial confinement, and \nnot โa jail official's episodic act or omission,โ id. at 643, the applicable standard is whether the \nnature and duration of confinement is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose. \nSee e.g. Terry ex rel. Terry v. Hill, 232 F. Supp. 2d 934, 941โ44 (E.D. Ark. 2002)(the delay in \ntransferring pretrial detainees to a mental health facility amounts to punishment as it is not related \nto any legitimate governmental purpose). \n8.  Under Bell v. Wolfish, a detaineeโs confinement violates substantive due process \nwhen it amounts to punishment. 441 U.S. 520, 536 (1979). \n9.  Detention amounts to punishment when โthe nature and duration of commitment \n[does not] bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.โ \nJackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972); see also Brown v. Taylor, 911 F.3d 235, 243 (5th \nCir. 2018) citing Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 265 (2001). \n10.  Punishment in the criminal justice system is reserved for criminal defendants who \nplead or are adjudicated guilty.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-36 (1979). \n11.  The stated purpose of confinement is determined by looking to the statute in \nquestion.  Zadvydas, 533 U.S. 678, 696-99 (2001) (holding that the stated purpose of confinement \nis determined by looking to the statute in question); Brown v. Taylor, 911 F.3d 235, 243 (5th Cir. \n2018) (court looked to sexually violent predator statute to determine purpose of confinement). \n12.  An incompetent detaineeโs or NGRI acquitteeโs continued confinement must be \njustified by progress toward the statutesโ stated purposes. See Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, \n738 (1972).   \n44 \n\n13.  The stated statutory purpose for the Named IST detaineesโ and the proposed IST \nclassโs continued confinement is โfor further examination and competency restoration services \nwith the specific objective of the defendant attaining competency to stand trial.โ  TEX. CODE CRIM. \nPROC. art. 46B.073 (entitled โCommitment for Restoration to Competencyโ (emphasis added)); \nMag. R & R. Doc. No. 49, at 4-5, (โGiven Texas lawโs stated purpose for their detention, this \nmeans the nature and duration of [Plaintiffsโ] confinement must bear a reasonable relation to their \nreceiving restorativeโฆtreatment.โ) \n14.  For Named IST Plaintiffs and the proposed IST class, where the only purpose for \ntheir continued detention after being found IST was/is for competency restoration services, and \nwhere their continued detention is in jail with no competency restoration services, the nature of \ntheir continued detention is not reasonably related to the purpose of their continued confinement.     \n15.  For Named IST Plaintiffs and the proposed IST class, where they wait an average \nof 263 days (MSU) or 49 days (non-MSU) after being found incompetent to stand trial before \nreceiving competency restoration services at an HHSC facility, the duration of their continued \ndetention is not reasonably related to the purpose of their continued confinement.    \n16.  The stated statutory purpose for the Named NGRI acquitteesโ and the proposed \nNGRI classโ continued confinement โshallโฆ be forโฆ evaluation of the [acquitteeโs] present \nmental conditionโ to determine the appropriateness of continued confinement and treatment. TEX. \nCODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46C.251 (entitled โCommitment for Evaluation and Treatment, Reportโ \n(emphasis added)); Mag. R & R. Doc. No. 49, at 4-5 (โGiven Texas lawโs stated purpose for their \ndetention, this means the nature and duration of [Plaintiffsโ] confinement must bear a reasonable \nrelation to their receivingโฆevaluative treatment.โ).  \n45 \n\n17.  For Named NGRI Plaintiffs and the proposed NGRI class, where the only purpose \nfor their continued detention after being found NGRI was/is evaluation of their present mental \ncondition to determine the appropriateness of continued confinement, and where their continued \ndetention is in jail without evaluation of their present mental condition, the nature of their \ncontinued detention is not reasonably related to the purpose of their continued confinement.     \n18.  For Named NGRI Plaintiffs and the proposed NGRI class, where they wait more \nthan 14 days after being found NGRI before being evaluated at an HHSC facility, the duration of \ntheir continued detention is not reasonably related to the purpose of their continued confinement.    \n19.  Many  courts,  including  courts  within  this  Circuit,  have  also  applied  the \nโprofessional judgmentโ standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Youngberg v. Romero to cases \nwith similar facts as the ones presented here.  457 U.S. 307, 321โ22 (1982) (holding that \nsubstantive due process requires that restrictions or conditions imposed on pretrial detainees be the \nresult of judgment exercised by a qualified professional); see, e.g., M.D. v. Abbott, 152 F. Supp. \n3d 684, 698โ700 (S.D. Tex. 2015); Disability Law Center, et. al., v. Utah Depโt of Human Servs., \n180 F. Supp. 3d 998, 1008 (D. Utah 2016); Advocacy Center for Elderly and Disabled v. Louisiana \nDepโt of Health and Hospitals, 731 F. Supp. 2d 603, 609โ10 (E.D. La. 2010). \n20.  Plaintiffsโ  and  the  classesโ  due  process  rights  were/are  violated  when  โthe \nconditions and duration of confinement [did not/do not] bear some reasonable relation to the \npurpose for which [they] are committed.โ Brown v. Taylor, 911 F.3d 235, 243 (5th Cir. 2018) \nciting Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 265 (2001); Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738 (1972). \n21.  Under  the  Jackson  analysis,  the  โdetermination  of  constitutionally  adequate \nmedical treatment is not measured by that which must be provided to the general prison population, \nbut by that which must be provided to those committed to for mental incompetencyโฆ.The \n46 \n\ntreatment provided in jails is not designed to promote the defendantโs speedy return to mental \ncompetence.โ  Stiavetti v. Ahlin, No. RG15-779731, 2019 WL 2176240 at *15 (Cal. Super. April \n19, 2019), see also P. Reply Doc. No. 112, at 9 (sting cite).   \n22.  Incidental mental health services provided in jails that do not meet the standards of \nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 46B.091 for formal jail-based competency restoration \nprograms were not/are not competency restoration services sufficient to justify the continued \ndetention of the IST Plaintiffs and the proposed IST class members. \nB.  Plaintiffs Meet the Requirements for Class Certification Under Rule 23 \n \n23.  The  classes  sought  to  be  represented  are  adequately  defined  and  clearly \nascertainable. \n24.  In order to prevail under Rule 23(a) on their Motion for Class Certification, \nPlaintiffs must demonstrate that โ(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable  [numerosity];  (2)  there  are  questions  of  law  or  fact  common  to  the  class \n[commonality]; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class [typicality]; and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the class [adequacy].โ  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 \nU.S. 338, 345 (2011). \n1.  Numerosity \n25.  Rule 23(a)(1) requires a showing that the class is so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.  FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a)(1)  Factors affecting the practicability of joinder \ninclude the geographic dispersion of class members and the ease of identifying all members.  Ibe \nv. Jones, 836 F3d 516, 528 (5th Cir. 2016). \n47 \n\n26.  โSmaller classes are less objectionable whereโฆthe plaintiff is seeking injunctive \nrelief on behalf of future class members as well as past and present members.โ  Jones v. Diamond, \n519 F.2d 1090. \n27.  Poverty, disability, and isolation of individual class members are factors that inform \nthe Courtโs analysis of practicability of joinder. See Steward v. Janek, 315 F.R.D. 472, 480 (W.D. \nTex. May 20, 2016); Armstead v. Pingree, 629 F. Supp. 273, 279 (M.D. Fla. 1986)); Barnes v. \nBoard of Trustees, Michigan Veterans Trust Fund, 369 F. Supp. 1327, 1333 (D. Mich. 1973). \n28.  Where an alleged class also includes unnamed, unknown future members, as \nPlaintiffsโ two classes do here, joinder is impracticable and satisfies Rule 23(a)(1).  See Jack v. \nAm. Linen Supply Co., 498 F.2d 122, 124 (5th Cir. 1974); Pederson v. La. State Univ. 213 F.3d \n858, 868-69 (5th Cir. 2000) (Fifth Circuit found a district court abused its discretion when it \ndecertified a class of only eight female LSU students plus future unnamed students bringing a Title \nIX discrimination claim). \n29.  The numerosity of the IST class is uncontested.  D. Resp. Doc. No. 110, at 21, fn7. \n30.  The IST putative class is sufficiently numerous such that joinder is impracticable \ngiven the 615 putative class members,4 the unknown number of unnamed future class members, \nthe inability to identify future class members, the putative class membersโ mental illnesses and \nimpoverishment, their geographical dispersion, the impracticability in joining them to the suit, and \nthe nature of the action.   \n31.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) with respect to the IST \nclass. \n                                                            \n4 Monthly Waitlist Update, P. Mot. Ex. Q, Doc. No. 104-18.   \n48 \n\n32.  The NGRI putative class is sufficiently numerous such that joinder is impracticable \ngiven the inherently fluctuating number of putative class members, the 75 and 68 members of the \nputative classes in the two preceding years, the unknown number of  unnamed future class \nmembers, the inability to identify future class members, the putative class membersโ mental \nillnesses and impoverishment, their geographical dispersion, the impracticability in joining them \nto the suit, and the nature of the action.   \n33.  Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) with respect to the NGRI \nclass. \n2.  Commonality \n \n34.  After  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  establishing  commonality  entails  two \nshowings: (1) there exists a common policy or practice (including an implicit one) that is the \nalleged source of harm for class members and (2) there are common questions of law or fact that \nwill be dispositive of the putative classโs claims.  M.D. v. Perry, 294 F.R.D. 7, 28-29 (S.D. Tex. \n2013). \n35.  The common practice identified to satisfy the commonality question does not have \nto injure every class member the same way or to the same degree; instead, Plaintiffs must establish \nonly a common legal injury resulting from the common policy or practice.  M.D. v. Perry, 294 \nF.R.D. at 44-45; see also Yates v. Collier, 868 F.3d 354, 363-64 (5th Cir. 2017); Steward v. Janek, \n315 F.R.D. 472, 482 (W.D. Tex. May 20, 2016). \n36.  Plaintiffs have identified Defendantโs practice of using waitlists rather than timely \nadmitting them (within 21-days and 14-days respectively) to its mental health facilities for their \ncourt-mandated services as the common source of their continued, injurious deprivation of liberty. \n49 \n\n37.  Where state law creates a broader liberty interest than does the federal due process \nclause itself, state law determines the actual liberty interests afforded persons in that state, and not \nthe constitutional substantive due process clause.  Mills v. Rogers, 457 U.S. 291, 303 (1982).5   \n38.  Texas law establishes 14 days as the relevant time limit after which the NGRI \nPlaintiffs and putative classโs continued confinement awaiting admission to an HHSC mental \nhealth  facility  violates  their  substantive  due  process  rights.    TEX.  CODE  CRIM.  PROC.  art. \n46C.160(a). \n39.  As a result of Defendantโs policy or practice of using waitlists in lieu of timely \nadmitting class members to its mental health facilities (i.e. within 21 and 14 days, respectively), \nPlaintiffs and the putative class members have suffered the same harm. \n40.  The harm identified by IST Plaintiffs includes  punishment by their wrongful \ncontinued confinement, injurious deprivation of liberty while the criminal processes against them \nwere/are/will  be  stayed,  and  the  prolonging  of    their  criminal  cases,  which  negatively \nimpacted/impacts/will impact their attorneysโ abilities to adequately represent them, identify \nwitnesses, and enter into plea negotiations. \n41.  The harm identified by the NGRI Plaintiffs includes punishment by their wrongful \ncontinued confinement in a jail despite being found not guilty of their charged crimes and the delay \nin the statutorily-required evaluation to determine whether they meet the civil standard for \ncontinued commitment in a mental health facility or can be released. \n                                                            \n5 Although Plaintiffs have not asserted a state-created liberty interest, the Texas statute does meet \nthe criteria of a state-created liberty interest insofar as it provides a mandatory objective rule for \nNGRI aquittees (โthe court may order the defendant detained in jailโฆfor a period not to exceed \n14 daysโ) and a violation of that rule would impose an atypical and significant hardship on an \nacquittee, remaining in jail without a conviction or charge.  See Sandin v Connor, 515 U.S. 472, \n484 (1995). \n50 \n\n42.  Because Defendant places and removes people on the waitlists on a โfirst-come, \nfirst-servedโ basis, Defendant is not making individualized assessments but is acting or refusing \nto  act  on  grounds  that  apply  generally  to  each  class.    Individualized  assessments  of  each \nincompetent detainee are, therefore, not necessary to identify the harm caused them by Defendant \nor to remedy it with Plaintiffsโ prayed-for declarations and injunctions. \n43.  Plaintiffsโ  and  the  class  membersโ  detention  absent  conviction  amounts  to \nunconstitutional punishment where the nature of their confinement (being warehoused in jails) and \nthe duration of their confinement in jail (more than 21 days and 14 days, respectively) is not \nreasonably related to the purpose of their confinement, which is to receive court-mandated \ncompetency or evaluation services at an HHSC mental health facility. \n44.  Because variations in the extent of injury felt by individual class members as a \nresult of the common policy or practice do not defeat commonality, see Yates, 868 F.3d at 362โ\n65, the actual length of time class members are confined beyond 21 or 14 days does not impede \nthe generation of common answers to the common questions of fact and law applicable to the \nclasses. \n45.  The common question of fact inherent in Plaintiffsโ claim is \na.  whether HHSC has failed to accept in a timely manner (i.e., within 21 or 14 \ndays, respectively, from the date HHSC is notified of the courtโs order to the date \nHHSC makes a bed available) the admission of Plaintiffs and class members to its \nmental health facilities for competency restoration treatment or NGRI evaluation \nand/or treatment as ordered by criminal courts. \n \n46.  The common questions of law inherent in Plaintiffsโ claim include \n \na.  whether HHSCโs failure to admit individuals determined incompetent to \nstand trial and NGRI acquittees ordered to HHSCโs mental health facilities within \na reasonably timely manner (i.e., within 21 or 14 days, respectively, from the date \nHHSC is notified of the courtโs order to the date HHSC makes a bed available), \ncausing them to be warehoused in county jails, violates the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution; and \n51 \n\n \nb.  whether Plaintiffs and class members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek, including an order requiring HHSC to admit to its mental \nhealth facilities IST detainees within 21 days and NGRI acquittees within 14 days, \nrespectively, from the date HHSC is notified of the courtโs order to the date HHSC \nmakes a bed available. \n \n47.  These common questions of fact and law are not only relevant to, but determinative \nof, Plaintiffsโ claims such that an answer to the proposed questions will resolve their Fourteenth \nAmendment due process claims in โone stroke.โ \n48.  IST Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden as to commonality under Rule 23(a)(2). \n49.  NGRI Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden as to commonality under Rule 23(a)(2). \n3.  Typicality \n \n50.  The test for typicality asks whether the class representatives โpossess the same \ninterest and suffer the same injuryโ as the class members but does not require that the claims of \nthe named plaintiffs be identical to the claims of the other class members.  Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. \nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982). \n51.  The generality of the Plaintiffsโ asserted claims and their requested relief guides the \ntypicality determination. \n52.  Plaintiffs have asserted a single claim generally applicable to each proposed classโ\nthat their Fourteenth Amendment rights are infringed by HHSCโs overarching policy and practice \nof failing to timely admit IST detainees and NGRI acquittees (within 21 and 14 days, respectively) \nto its mental health facilities for their court-mandated competency restoration services or NGRI \nevaluation and treatment.  P. Comp. Doc. No. 97, at ยถยถ 89-109. \n53.  The relief they seek is correspondingly generalโdeclarations that this policy and \npractice violates their rights to the extent they are required to remain incarcerated for more than \n52 \n\n21 or 14 days after HHSC is notified of their commitment orders and injunctions barring this policy \nand practice from continuing.  P. Comp. Doc. No. 97, at 31-32. \n54.  The Named Plaintiffs share the same characteristics as the proposed class members.  \nThe Named Plaintiffs have been found either incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of \ninsanity, have been court-ordered to an HHSC mental health facility for restoration services or \nevaluation and treatment, and remained in jail for more than 21 or 14 days after HHSC is notified \nof their commitment orders due to HHSCโs self-imposed insufficient forensic capacity. \n55.  The Named Plaintiffs have the same interest as the proposed classes, i.e., avoiding \nbeing warehoused in jails without restoration or evaluation services for more than 21 or 14 days \nbefore HHSC admits them to one of its mental health facilities for those services.   \n56.  The Named Plaintiffs have also suffered the same injury as the proposed classesโ\nincarceration without purpose for more than 21 or 14 days after HHSC was notified of their \ncommitment.   \n57.  IST Plaintiffsโ claims are, therefore, typical of the classes they seek to represent.  \nIST Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3). \n58.  NGRI Plaintiffsโ claims are, therefore, typical of the classes they seek to represent.  \nNGRI Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3). \n4.  Adequacy \n \n59.  To satisfy the adequacy element of Rule 23(a), two criteria must be met: (1) the \nclass representatives must not have antagonistic or conflicting interests with the unnamed members \nof the class and (2) the attorneys representing the class must be qualified and competent.  Neff v. \nVIA Metro. Transit Auth., 179 F.R.D. 185, 194 (W.D. Tex. 1998); Lerwill v. Inflight Motion \nPictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507, 512 (9th Cir. 1978).   \n53 \n\n60.  In determining the adequacy of class representatives, courts consider whether the \ninterests of the Named Plaintiffs are sufficiently aligned with the other class members.โ Neff, 179 \nF.R.D. at 195 (quoting Jenkins v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 109 F.R.D. 269, 273 (E.D. Tex. 1985), \naff'd, 782 F.2d 468 (5th Cir.1986)); see generally Gen. Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 \nU.S. 147 (1982).   \n61.  โDifferences between the proposed representatives and the class do not defeat \nadequacy unless they rise to the level of a conflict of interest.โ  Morrow v. Washington, 277 F.R.D. \n172, 195 (E.D. Tex. 2011) (citing Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F3d 620, 625-26 \n(5th Cir. 1999)). \n62.  In the Fifth Circuit, courts additionally evaluate whether the class representatives \nโpossess a sufficient level of knowledge and understanding to be capable of โcontrollingโ or \nโprosecutingโ the litigation.โโ Steward, 315 F.R.D. at 490โ91 (quoting Feder v. Elec. Data Sys. \nCorp., 429 F.3d 125, 129 (5th Cir. 2005)). \n63.  The mere fact that a named plaintiffโs individual claim has been mooted does not \npreclude that plaintiff from adequately representing the class.  Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 403 \n(1975).   \n64.  The Named Plaintiffs and all members of both proposed classes have suffered, are \nsuffering, or are at risk of suffering, the same injuries as a result of Defendantโs policies and \npractices: waiting in county jails for more than 21 or 14 days for admittance to an HHSC mental \nhealth facility.  The Named Plaintiffs and the unnamed members of the proposed classes share the \nsame interest (prompt admission to Defendantโs facilities for competency restoration treatment or \nNGRI evaluation and treatment services), share the same harm (continued confinement longer than \n21 or 14 days after HHSC receives their commitment orders, in violation of their Fourteenth \n54 \n\nAmendment rights), and seek the same relief (systemic change by declaration and injunction \nrequiring admission within 21 or 14 days) for the classes as a whole.   \n65.  For both classes, the claims of the Named Plaintiffs are not presently or potentially \nin conflict with any members of the class. \n66.  Named Plaintiffsโ mental states limit their ability to protect their legal interests.  As \nsuch, next friends are necessary to represent their interests. \n67.  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), all Named Plaintiffs are \nrepresented by next friends who share the same interests as the Named Plaintiffs and the class and \ndo not have any conflicts between themselves and the proposed classes. \n68.  Under Fifth Circuit law, a next friend representing a Named Plaintiff, who because \nof age or mental disability is unable to adequately represent his or her own interests in the litigation, \ncan serve as an adequate class representative.  See Horton v. Goose Creek Ind. Sch. Dist., 690 F.2d \n470, 484 (5th Cir. 1982); M.D. v. Perry, 294 F.R.D. at 29, 46. \n69.  The Named Plaintiffsโ next friends are dedicated to the Named Plaintiffsโ best \ninterests, familiar with this litigation, understand why the Named Plaintiffs seek relief, and are \nwilling and able to pursue this case on the Named Plaintiffsโ behalf.  See Shearer Dec., P. Mot. Ex. \nC, Doc. No. 104-4; Jennings Dec., P. Mot. Ex. D, Doc. No. 104-5; Rodriguez Dec., P. Mot. Ex. E, \nDoc. No. 104-6; Sedita Dec., P. Mot. Ex. F, Doc. No. 104-7; Craven Dec., P. Mot. Ex. G, Doc. \nNo. 104-8; Chacona Dec., P. Mot. Ex. H, Doc. No. 104-9.   \n70.  The Named Plaintiffs and their next friends have no divergent interests and can \nfully and adequately represent the legal rights and seek the legal remedies to which all members \nof the putative classes are entitled.  Accordingly, the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4) are met. \n55 \n\n71.   In determining the adequacy of class counsel, the trial court is to inquire into โthe \nzeal and competence of the representativeโs counselโฆ.โ  Horton, 690 F.2d at 484.  The factors \nthat courts consider in determining the adequacy of counsel in class actions include the attorneysโ \nprofessional skills, experience, and resources.  See N. Am. Acceptance Corp. Sec. Cases, 593 F.2d \n642, 644 (5th Cir. 1979). \n72.  Based upon the qualifications of attorneys Beth Mitchell, Peter Hofer, and John \nMichael Gaddis as well as non-profit Disability Rights Texas and Winston and Strawn LLP, it is \nclear Plaintiffsโ counsel are well qualified to litigate this action and will prosecute it vigorously on \nbehalf of the classes.  Plaintiffsโ counsel command the necessary resources to competently \nrepresent the classes and they have no other professional commitments that are antagonistic to, or \nwhich would detract from, their efforts to seek a favorable decision for the classes in this case.   \n73.  The competency of class counsel is undisputed.  D. Resp. Doc. No. 110, at 8. \n74.  There is no conflict of interest between the Named Plaintiffs and their counsel or \nbetween the unnamed, future class members and counsel.   \n75.  Disability Rights Texas has no conflict of interest that would prevent it from \nzealously advocating for the rights of the proposed classes simply because its mission includes \nprotecting the rights of other, also-vulnerable populations. \n76.  IST Plaintiffs have thus satisfied the adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(4). \n77.  NGRI Plaintiffs have thus satisfied the adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(4). \n5.  Rule 23(b)(2) \n \n78.  In order to prevail on their Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs must also meet \nthe elements for at least one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b).  In this case, Plaintiffs allege \nthey have met the requirements set forth in Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when โthe party opposing \n56 \n\nthe class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final \ninjunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.โ  \nP. Comp. Doc. No. 97, at ยถ 20; Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \n79.  Under  Wal-Mart,  โRule  23(b)(2)  applies  only  when  a  single  injunction  or \ndeclaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.  It does not authorize class \ncertification when each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or \ndeclaratory judgment against the defendant.โ  564 U.S. at 360. \n80.  In Yates, the Court recognized three requirements for Rule 23(b)(2) certification: \nโ(1) class members must have been harmed in essentially the same way; (2) injunctive relief must \npredominate over monetary damage claims; (3) the injunctive relief must be specific.โ  868 F.3d \n354, 366-67 (quoting Maldonado v. Ochsner Clinic Found., 493 F.3d 521, 524 (5th Cir. 2007)).  \n81.  All members of both proposed classes have been harmed in essentially the same \nway.  Defendantโs policy and practice of refusing timely admission to its mental health facilities \nuniversally affects each member of the two proposed classes equallyโthey all are warehoused in \njail more than 21 or 14 days, respectively, after being committed to an HHSC facility for \ncompetency restoration education or NGRI evaluation and treatment. \n82.  Plaintiffsโ proposed 21-day and 14-day time limits for admission to an HHSC \nmental health facility constitute a reasonable remedy for their constitutional violations. \n83.  The injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs for each proposed class is specific, insofar \nas it would simply require Defendant to admit class members to its mental health facilities within \na specified time frame (21 days or 14 days, respectively) after HHSC is notified of their being \nfound either incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity. \n57 \n\n84.  Plaintiffsโ proposed time limits therefore satisfy the concerns raised by the Fifth \nCircuit regarding the prior class certification order, which it found to be ambiguous because that \norder did not define โwhat period of time the district court considers to be extended.โ Ward, 753 \nFed. Appx. at 246. \n85.  An injunction requiring Defendant to admit incompetent detainees to one of its \nmental health facilities within 21 days of receipt of the criminal courtโs order would provide \nsystemic relief to each member of that class.  Likewise, an injunction requiring that Defendant \nadmit acquittees found not guilty by reason of insanity to one of its mental facilities within 14 days \nof receipt of a criminal courtโs order would provide systemic relief to each member of that class. \n86.  Since Defendant admits each class on a first-come, first-served basis, there is no \nneed for different injunctions or declaratory judgments tailored to different individual class \nmembers, as a single injunction and declaratory judgment for each class provides an appropriate \nremedy for all class members.   \n87.  Injunctive relief predominates in Plaintiffsโ claims because the proposed class \naction seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief, and does not seek monetary damages. \n88.  IST Plaintiffs have, therefore, satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). \n89.  NGRI Plaintiffs have, therefore, satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2). \n90.  Class  certification  is  necessary  to  provide  meaningful  judicial  review  of \nDefendantโs systemic denial of the due process rights of Plaintiffs and the members of the proposed \nclasses. \nC.  Federal Precedent from Identical Cases \n \n91.  Federal district courts in both Utah and Washington have, within the past few years, \ncertified classes for incompetency detainees who had been ordered to the custody of those statesโ \n58 \n\nequivalent of HHSC for competency-restoration treatment but remained housed in county jails.  \nSee Disability Law Ctr., et. al. v. Utah, No. 2:15-cv-00645, 2016 WL 5396681, at *8 (D. Utah, \nSept. 27, 2016); Trueblood et. al. v. Washington State Depโt of Soc. & Health Servs., W.D. Wash. \nNo. 2:14-cv-01178, Docket No. 84, at 4 (October 31, 2014). \n92.  Both courts found that the proposed classes for incompetency detainees, analogous \nto the putative classes in this case, met all the requirements for class certification under Rule 23(a) \nand (b).  See Disability Law Ctr., et. al. v. Utah, No. 2:15-cv-00645, 2016 WL 5396681, at *8 (D. \nUtah, Sept. 27, 2016); Trueblood et. al. v. Washington State Depโt of Soc. & Health Servs., W.D. \nWash. No. 2:14-cv-01178, Docket No. 84, at 4 (October 31, 2014). \nCONCLUSION \nIn light of the foregoing, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that they have carried their burden \nto certify the requested IST and NGRI classes. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n          /s/ Beth Mitchell       \nBETH MITCHELL \nState Bar No. 00784613 \nbmitchell@drtx.org  \nPETER HOFER \nState Bar No. 09777275 \nphofer@drtx.org \nLISA SNEAD \nState Bar No. 24062204 \nlsnead@drtx.org \nDISABILITY RIGHTS TEXAS \n2222 West Braker Lane \nAustin, Texas 78758 \n(512) 454-4816 (Phone) \n(512) 454-3999 (Fax) \nbmitchell@drtx.org \nphofer@drtx.org \nlsnead@drtx.org \n \n59 \n\nCOTY MEIBEYER \nState Bar No. 24085469  \nDISABILITY RIGHTS TEXAS \n1500 McGowen, Suite 100 \nHouston, Texas 77004 \n(713) 974-7691 (Phone) \n(713) 974-7695 (Fax) \ncmeibeyer@drtx.org \n \nJOHN MICHAEL GADDIS \nState Bar No. 24069747 \nWINSTON & STRAWN LLP \n2121 N.

On November 19, \nOn August  19,  2020, Cecile Erwin Young,  in her official capacity as the Executive \nCommissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, was substituted as Defendant in \nthis action (Doc. #136). \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 2 of 20\n2019, the court held a hearing on the motion, at which counsel appeared for all parties.  Having \nconsidered the motion, response, reply, the arguments of counsel at the hearing, the parties' proposed \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and the record in this case, the court will grant the motion \nfor class certification in part for the reasons to follow. \nBackground \nThis cause was originally brought pursuant to Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States \nCode on behalf of seven incarcerated individuals.  Two putative  classes are comprised of (1) \nindividuals found not guilty by reason of insanity and (2) individuals found incompetent to stand \ntrial, who assert that their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights are violated when they are \nhoused for prolonged periods in Texas jails without adequate mental-health treatment while waiting \nfor a bed to become available in a Texas Department of State Health Services facility.  Defendant \nCecile Erwin Young is the Executive Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health \nServices (the \"Department\") and is sued in her official capacity. \nIn Texas, the Department oversees state hospitals and behavioral-health programs.  The \nTexas Legislature has funded the Department to operate approximately 2,269 inpatient beds at its \n10 state hospitals, which serve both the forensic2 and civil populations, as well as persons who are \nvoluntarily self-admitted.  The  Texas  Legislature has  given the Department the  discretion to \ndetermine how to divide the total number of Department inpatient mental-health beds between the \ncivil and forensic population.  The number of forensic patients served by the Department accounts \n2  The forensic population of the state hospitals is comprised of incompetent detainees \nand insanity acquittees. \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 3 of 20\nfor approximately 65 percent of the inpatient beds at its hospitals and approximately 35 percent to \ncivil patients. \nThere are no formal criteria for determining the distribution of forensic versus civil beds. \nThe Department does not have sufficient capacity to admit all incompetent detainees committed to \nits care for competency-restoration services immediately upon commitment. \nThe Department maintains two separate master tracking lists ofp ending forensic admissions: \none for pending admissions for persons requiring placement on a maximum-security-unit tracking \nlist (\"MSU waitlist\"), and one tracking list for the admission of persons determined incompetent to \nstand trial for non-violent offenses or otherwise requiring placement in a nonmaximum-security \nfacility (\"Clearinghouse waitlist\") \nWhen an individual charged with a crime is found incompetent to stand trial, all criminal \nproceedings are stayed,3 and the individual must be transferred to a Department facility for further \nexamination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial or \nreleased on bail subject to conditions.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.071-073 (West 2018 & \nSupp.  2020).  An order committing a defendant for restoration of competency \"must place the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to \nreceive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.\" Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.075 \n(West 2018).  The Department  is granted the flexibility to determine whether an incompetent \ndetainee charged with a violent offense is admitted to an MSU or a non-MSU  Tex. Code \nfacility.4 \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.004(d) (West 2018). \nThe Department asserts that the recent amendment will provide its experienced clinicians \nthe flexibility to ensure that proposed patients are placed in appropriate facilities based on unique \nmedical conditions  as opposed  to offense categories, and  the Department  anticipates that the \n3 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 4 of 20\nCrim. Proc. Art. 46B.073(c) (West Supp. 2020).  Defendants who are not charged with offenses \nrequiring commitment to an MSU are served in other state hospitals or state-supported living centers. \nTex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.073(d). \nAn individual found not guilty by reason of insanity stands acquitted of the offense charged \nand may not be considered a person charged with an offense.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. \n46C. 155(a) (West 2018).  In accordance with Texas law, if a court determines that the acquittee' s \noffense caused, placed another in, or threatened serious bodily injury, the individual must, within 14 \ndays, be transferred to the maximum-security unit designated by the Department for evaluation of \nthe person's present mental condition and for treatment.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.157, \n46C.25 1-252(a), and 46C. 160 (West Supp. 2020).  Once transferred, the Department is required to \nevaluate the acquittee for 30 days,5 after which the acquittee must be released if, after a hearing, the \nstate fails to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the individual has a mental illness and is \ndangerous.  See id. at 46C.252-258 (West 2018). \nThe Department operates the Clearinghouse waitlist on a first-come, first-served basis, and \npatients receive admission to a non-MSU unit at a state hospital or at a contracted facility that serves \nforensic commitments.6 The Department likewise generally operates the MSU waitlist on a first- \namendment will reduce the number of individuals needing admission to a MSU facility. \nSee Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46C.251(a), (d). \n6  As of March 15, 2019, there were 318 detainees found incompetent to stand trial and \nplaced  on the Department's  Clearinghouse waitlist.  Of those  318  detainees,  58  percent  (186 \ndetainees) remained incarcerated in county jails for more than 21 days from the day the Department \nreceived the court order to the day it notified the jail that the person could be admitted to a facility. \n4 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 5 of 20\ncome, first-served basis with respect to incompetent detainee admissions.7 Wait times for admission \nto a non-MSU facility are generally shorter than wait times for admission to a MSU facility.  As for \ninsanity acquittees who have not been convicted and are no longer charged, the acquittee can be \ndetained injail for no more than 14 days pending transfer to an mental-health facility. See Tex. Code \nCrim. P.  art. 46C.160(a).  As of July  15, 2019, only two  insanity acquitees remained on the \nDepartment's MSU \nwaitlist.8 \nPlaintiffs assert that Young's failure to timely accept transfer of incompetent detainees and \ninsanity acquittees to Department facilities and to provide timely restoration and evaluative treatment \nforces Plaintiffs and proposed members of the classes they represent to remain incarcerated for \nweeks or months in county jails without any of the treatment or evaluation services Young and her \nDepartment are statutorily required to provide.  Plaintiffs further argue that because incompetent \ncriminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime and insanity acquittees have been absolved \nof criminal  responsibility,  both  classes  of persons  have  a  liberty  interest  in  freedom  from \nincarceration and a liberty interest in the receipt of restorative treatment. Plaintiffs seek a declaration \nof their rights and an order enjoining Young from violating their rights. Specifically, Plaintiffs seek \nto enjoin Young (1) from failing to make a bed available for persons found incompetent to stand trial \nAs of March 15, 2019, there were 453 detainees found incompetent to stand trial or not \nguilty by reason of insanity and placed on the Department's MSU waitlist.  Of those 453 detainees, \n94.7 percent (429 individuals) remained incarcerated in county jails for more than 21 days from the \nday the Department received the court order to the day it notified the jail that the person could be \nadmitted to a facility. \n8 However, as recently as May 20, 2019, Young admitted that \"insanity acquittees who are \nrequired to be admitted to MSUs within  14 days frequently have to wait weeks or months for \nadmission after the[ir] adjudication.\" \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 6 of 20\nand order to a Department mental-health facility no later than 21 days from the date the Department \nreceives notice of a criminal court's commitment order under Chapter 46B of the Texas Code of \nCriminal Procedure, and (2) from failing to make a bed available for persons found not guilty by \nreason of insanity an order to a Department mental-health facility not later than 14 days from the date \nthe Department receives notice of a criminal court's commitment order under Chapter 46C of the \nTeas Code of Criminal Procedure. \nPlaintiffs' proposed classes are as follows: \n1.  All persons who are now or will be in the future charged with a crime in the State of \nTexas, and: (a) who are ordered to a Texas Department facility where they are to receive competency \nrestoration services; and (b) for whom the Department receives the court order; but (c) who remain \ndetained in a Texas county jail for more than 21 days. \n2.  All persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the State of \nTexas and who are found not guilty by reason of insanity, and: (a) who are ordered to receive \nevaluation or treatment services at a Department facility; (b) for whom the Department receives the \ncourt order; but (c) who remain detained in a Texas county jail for more than 14 days. \nThis court granted Plaintiffs' original Motion for Class Certification. On interlocutory appeal, \nthe Fifth Circuit vacated the certification  order, remanding the case to this court to perform a \n\"rigorous analysis\" of whether Plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.  Wardv. Hellerstedt, 753 Fed. App'x 236, 250 (5th Cir. 2018).  Plaintiffs \nsubsequently filed a second motion for class certification (Doc. #104), to which Young responded \n(Doc. #110) and Plaintiffs' replied (Doc. #112). The parties also filed proposed findings of fact and \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 7 of 20\nconclusions of law (Doc. ## 120 and 121).  The court held a hearing on the motion on November \n19, 2019. \nAnalysis \n\"While retaining broad discretion to certify a class, '[a] district court must rigorously analyze \nRule 23's prerequisites before certifying a class.\" Spence v. Glock, Ges.m.b.H, 227 F.3d 308, 310 \n(5th Cir. 2000) (citing General Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161 (1982); Castano v. American \nTobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 740 (5th Cir. 1996)). See also Cruson v. Jackson Nat '1 Life Ins. Co., 954 \nF.3d 240,  249 (5th  Cir.  2020).  Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure  23  sets  forth the  rules for \nestablishing a certifiable class in federal court.  Section (a) provides: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all \nmembers only if: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses \nof the class; and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \nSection (b) directs that a class action may only be maintained if one of the following is \nsatisfied: \n(1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk \nof: \n(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that \nwould establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or \n(B) adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, \nwould be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual \n7 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 8 of 20\nadjudications or would substantially impair or impede their  ability to protect their \ninterests; \n(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \nto the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole; or \n(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate \nover any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to \nother available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters \npertinent to these findings include: \n(A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense \nof separate actions; \n(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by \nor against class members; \n(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the \nparticular forum; and \n(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). \nAccordingly, a class may be properly certified if it meets the requirements of Rule 23(a) and \none or more of the provisions of Rule 23(b) are satisfied.  The trial court \"maintains substantial \ndiscretion in detennining whether to certify a class action.\" Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 \nF.3d  402, 408  (5th  Cir.  1998)  (citation  omitted).  \"Implicit  in this  deferential  standard is  a \nrecognition of the essentially factual basis of the certification inquiry and of the district court's \ninherent power to manage and control pending litigation.\"  Maldonado v.  Ochsner Clinic Found., \n493 F.3d 521, 523 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting In re MonumentalLfe Ins. Co., 365 F.3d 408, 414 (5th \nCir. 2004)). \nYoung opposes class certification on a number of grounds. Specifically, Young argues: (1) \nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  demonstrate  that  their  proposed  insanity-acquitee  class  sufficiently \n8 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 9 of 20\nnumerous; (2) Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they and each member of the proposed class \nhave suffered the same alleged injury and that there are issues capable of class-wide resolution; (3) \nbecause commonality and typicality requirements tend to merge, for the same reasons described in \nconnection with commonality, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate typicality among the claims of \nthe putative class members; (4) Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate how they and their next friends \nwill adequately protect  the interests of the class;  and (5) Plaintiffs have failed to specify the \ninjunctive relief they are requesting as Plaintiffs' requested time limits for moving putative class \nmembers to state hospitals are arbitrary. \nThe class action is \"an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and \non behalf of the individual namedparties only.\" Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, \n700-701 (1979).  To come within the exception, a party seeking to maintain a class \naction \"must affinnatively demonstrate his compliance\" with Rule 23. WalMart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011).  The Rule \"does not set forth a mere \npleading standard.\" Ibid.  Rather, a party must not only \"be prepared to prove that \nthere are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact,\" \ntypicality of claims or defenses, and adequacy of representation, as required by Rule \n23(a). Ibid.  The party must also satisfy through evidentiary proof at least one of the \nprovisions of Rule 23(b). \nComcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27,33 (2013). The Fifth Circuit requires district courts to \"look \nbeyond the pleadings to 'understand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable substantive \nlaw in  order to make  a meaningful  determination of the certification  issues.\"  McManus  v. \nFleetwood Enters., Inc., 320 F.3d 545, 548 (5th Cir. 2003) (quoting Castano, 84 F.3d at 744).  See \nalso MD. ex re. Stukenberg v. Perry, 675 F.3d 832, 837 (5th Cir. 2012). \nNumerosity \nA class can be certified only if \"the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). See also Ibe v. Jones, 836 F.3d 516, 5238 (5th Cir. 2016). \n\"[A] plaintiff must ordinarily demonstrate some evidence or reasonable estimate of the number of \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 10 of 20\npurported class members.\" Zeidman v. .1 Ray McDermott & Co., Inc., 651 F.2d 1030, 1038 (5th Cir. \n1981).  The Fifth Circuit has noted, however, that \"the number of members in a proposed class is \nnot determinative ofwhetherjoinder is impracticable.\" In re TWL Corp., 712 F.3d 886, 894(5th Cir. \n2013) (quoting Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620,624(5th Cir. 1999)). The court \nmay consider a number of facts other than the actual  or estimated number of purported class \nmembers, including the ease with which class members may be identified, the nature of the action, \nand the size of each plaintiff's claim.  See Zeidman, 651 F.2d at 1038. \nPlaintiffs  contend that as of March 2019, the putative-class  members  of incompetent \ndetainees was 615, with an unknown number of future class members. Young does not contest that \nnumber.  Given the undisputed number, the unknown number of future class members, and the fact \nthat Plaintiffs presented evidence that the mental capacity of the incompetent detainees and their \ntransient state creates a barrier to vindicating their interests, the court finds that the numerosity factor \nis met with regard to incompetent detainees. \nYoung asserts that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that their proposed insanity-acquitee \nclass is sufficiently numerous, arguing that as of the July 15, 2019, only two insanity acquittees \nremained on the MSU waitlist and noting that the Department has prioritized that population to meet \nthe 14-day statutory requirement. Plaintiffs have not presented evidence to refute Young's evidence, \narguing only that the future numbers are unknown and may rise.  Future insanity acquitees can be \nreadily identified through the Department's records. Given the limited number of insanity acquitees \nidentified and the fact that future insanity acquitees can be easily identified and located, the court \nfinds that Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of establishing that the insanity-acquitee class \n10 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 11 of 20\nis so numerous to render joinder impracticable.  See Garcia v. Gloor, 618 F.2d 264, 267 (5th Cir. \n1980); Cooper v. Kliebert, 2014 WL 7338846, at *2 (M.D. La. Dec. 22, 2014). \nCommonality \nThe crux of this case is commonality.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2), a \nclass may be certified only if \"there are questions of law or fact common to the class.\" The parties \nagree that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes establishes the standard for determining the commonality \nrequirement. 564 U.S. 338, 349 (2011). See also Perry, 675 F.3d at 837 (applying standard in Wa!- \nMart Stores).  Thus, the court will consider Young's claim that Plaintiffs fail to identify proper \ncommon questions of law and fact and offer no evidence to support their showing of commonality \namong incompetent pretrial detainees. \nYoung asserts that each incompetent-detainee claim must be resolved on a case-by-case basis \nbased on an individualized inquiry into the circumstances of the detainee's delayed admission to a \nstate facility pursuant to Jackson v.  Indiana, 406 U.S. 715,  717-18 (1972).  Young argues that \nbecause the incompetent  detainees are housed in different county jails, some of which provide \nmedication therapies for the detainees while  others do not,  Plaintiffs  cannot demonstrate that \ndifferences among these detainees do not preclude commonality.  In response, Plaintiffs assert that \nYoung misstates  the standard  for evaluating commonality as requiring that the harm to  class \nmembers must be the same regardless of the circumstances of their detention.  Plaintiffs argue that \nthe standard articulated by the Fifth Circuit in Yates v. Collier, that commonality is satisfied as long \nas there is a single common question existing among the individual class members even where \nindividuals do not have the exact same risk of injury, applies in this case. 868 F.3d 354, 363-34(5th \nCir. 2017) (class certification granted for class of prison inmates exposed to excessive heat even \n11 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 12 of 20\nthough due to age, health, and individual biological responses to heat-mitigation measures taken by \nState all suffered different risk of harms).  Further, Plaintiffs argue that the 21-day timeline for \nincompetent detainees is based on state-law standards that are relevant in determining whether \ncontinued detention in a county jail without transfer to one of the Department's facilities violates \ntheir substantive due process rights.  The court agrees. \nHaving reviewed the pleadings and all supporting evidence in this case, and looking beyond \nthe pleadings to understand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable substantive law, the \ncourt finds that Plaintiffs have asserted common questions of fact in this case.  They are as follows: \nwhether incompetent detainees who are committed to the custody of the Department for restoration \nof their mental capacity so they may be tried spend extended periods of time in county jails without \nreceiving restoration or evaluation services; and, if so, whether Young uses a policy or procedure to \nensure that any resulting delay in the implementation of such services and the place and manner in \nthe  implementation of those services are  the product of the judgment rendered by a  qualified \nprofessional. The answers to these questions of fact implicate a common question of law:  whether \nYoung  violates  the  substantive due-process  rights of incompetent  detainees  to be  free  from \nconditions or restrictions of confinement that amount to punishment absent criminal conviction by \nkeeping such individuals in county jail more than 21 days while they wait to receive restoration and \nevaluation services that are the product of professional judgment. \nAlthough \"a court must trace the class claims and conclude that the common questions will \nresolve them without the need for additional extensive individualized inquiry,\" \"[t]he existence of \nsome  variations  within  the  class  or  individualized  defenses  do  not  necessarily make  class \ncertification improper.\"  MD. v. Perry, 294 F.R.D. 7,28 (S.D. Tex. 2013).  \"It is not necessary that \n12 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 13 of 20\nmembers of the proposed class  'share every fact in common.\" Evon v.  Law Offices of Sidney \nMickell, 688 F.3d 1015, 1030 (9th Cir. 2012)  (quoting Rodriguez v. Hayes, 591 F.3d 1105, 1122 \n(9th Cir. 2010)). See also In re Heartland Payment Sys., Inc. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 851 \nF. Supp. 2d 1040, 1054 (S.D. Tex. 2012).  \"So long as the common questions linking the putative \nclass members are dispositive of their claim and the claim arises out of a single course of conduct \nand on a single theory of liability, Rule 23(a)'s commonality requirement is satisfied.\"  Perry, 294 \nF.R.D. at 28 (citing Young v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 693 F.3d, 532, 535 (6th Cir. 2012); Evon, \n688 F.3d at 1029-30; Wangv. Chinese Daily News, Inc., 709 F.3d 829, 834 (9th Cir. 2013)). \nTo satisfy the commonality requirement, the class members' claims must  \"depend upon a \ncommon contention\" that \"is capable of class wide resolutionwhich means that determination of \nits truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one \nstroke.\"  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 350.  Thus, establishing commonality entails satisfying \ntwo factors: \"that there exists a common policy or practice, possibly an implicit one, that is the \nalleged source of the harm to class members, and that there are common questions of law or fact that \nwill be dispositive of the class members' claim.\" Perry, 294 F.R.D. at 29. \n\"Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification \nstage.  Merits questions may be considered to the extentbut only to the extentthat they are \nrelevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.\" \nAmgen Inc. v.  Connecticut Ret.  Plans & Trust Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013) (internal citations \nomitted). Young's policy and practice of untimely transfer of incompetent detainees to a Department \nfacility causing a common harm to the detainee's due-process rights establish the following common \nquestions of facts and law: (1) whether the Department has failed to accept in a timely manner \n13 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 14 of 20\nwithin 21  days  from the date the Department is notified of the court's order to the date the \nDepartment makes a bed availablethe admission of the incompetent-detainee-class members to \nits mental-health facilities for competency restoration treatment as ordered by the criminal courts; \n(2) whether the Department's failure to admit individuals determined incompetent to stand trial and \nordered to the Department's mental-health facilities within a reasonably timely mannerwithin 21 \nfrom the date the Department is notified of the court's order to the date the Department makes a bed \navailableviolates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (3) whether \nincompetent-detainee class members are entitled to the declaratory and injunctive relief they seek, \nincluding an order requiring the Department to admit incompetent detainees to its mental health \nfacilities within 21 days from the date the Department is notified of the court's order to the date the \nDepartment makes a bed available.  The court therefore concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied the \ncommonality requirement. \nTypicality \nThe typicality requirement in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(3) requires that the class \nrepresentatives \"possess the same interest and suffer the same injury\" as the prospective class \nmembers.  See General Tel.  Co.  of Sw.  v.  Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982).  The United States \nSupreme Court has recognized that \"[t]he commonality and typicality requirements of Rule 23(a) \ntend to merge\" and that \"[b]oth serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular \ncircumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff's claim \nand the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and \nadequately protected in their absence.\"  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 349. Young argues that \n14 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 15 of 20\nbecause the class members' claims in this case are not common there is no claim possessed by the \ngeneral class against which to assess typicality. See Id. \nThe parties' arguments about typicality are in large part arguments about the appropriate level \nof generality at which to compare Plaintiffs to members of the proposed class of incompetent \ndetainees. Plaintiffs argue for typicality because of characteristics they share with the proposed class \nmembers.  Plaintiffs, like the proposed class members, have been found incompetent to stand trial, \nhave been ordered by a court to be placed in a Department facility for evaluation and restoration \nservices, and have been denied timely transfer to a Department facility.  The court is persuaded by \nPlaintiffs' argument.  Plaintiffs have the same interest as the proposed classavoiding remaining \nin county jail without restoration or evaluation services for more than 21  days before they are \nadmitted to one of the Department's facilities; and Plaintiffs have suffered the same injury as the \nproposed classincarceration for more than 21 after the Department was notified of the court order \nto transfer.  For these reasons, the court concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that, in all \npertinent respects, they are typical of the proposed class. \nAdequacy \nRule 23(a)(4) oft he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that \"the representative parties \nwill fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\"  The rule \"mandates an inquiry into the \nzeal and competence of the representative's counsel and into the willingness and ability of the \nrepresentative to take an active role in and control the litigation and to protect the interests of \nabsentees.\"  Horton v.  Goose Creek ISD, 690 F.2d 470, 484 (5th Cir. 1982).  The court must find \nclass counsel \"qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation.\" North \nAm. Acceptance Corp. v. Ama!!,  Golden & Gregory, 593 F.2d 642, 644 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting \n15 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 16 of 20\nJohnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 417 F.2d 1122, 1125 (5th Cir. 1969)).  In addition, \"the \nclass representatives [must] possess a sufficient level of knowledge and understanding to be capable \nof controlling or prosecuting the litigation.\"  Feder v. Electronic Data Sys. Corp., 429 F.3d 125, \n129-30 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal quotations omitted).  \"Differences between named plaintiffs and \nclass members render the named plaintiffs inadequate representatives only if those differences create \nconflicts between the named plaintiffs' interests and the class members' interests.\" Mullen, 186 F.3d \nat 625-26 (citing Jenkins v. Raymark Indus., Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1986) (considering \nwhether named plaintiffs have \"an insufficient stake in the outcome or interests antagonistic to the \nunnamed members\" in evaluating adequate-representation requirement)). \nYoung argues that Plaintiffs are not proper class representatives because most, if not all, have \nalready been transferred to a Department facility and therefore do not have the requisite interest in \nthe case to serve as class representatives because their individual claims have been mooted.  Young \nfurther argues that Plaintiffs have provided no authority to support the proposition that Plaintiffs' \ndesignated next friends can substitute for an inadequate group of individual Plaintiffs. In response, \nPlaintiffs argue that regardless of whether the individual Plaintiffs' claims have been mooted, their \nclaims are capable of repetition. See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 319-20 (1988). Plaintiffs further \nargue that the injunctive relief they seek will benefit the individual Plaintiffs and all present and \nfuture class  members as no  current or future  class members  have an interest in  maintaining \nunreasonably lengthy waiting periods for transfer to a Department facility.  Cf Sosna v. Iowa, 419 \nU.s. 393, 403 n.13 (1975).  The court agrees.  Moreover, Plaintiffs have provided the court with \naffidavit evidence that the individual Plaintiffs'  next friends and counsel who represented  the \n16 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 17 of 20\nindividual Plaintiffs in their individual criminal cases are competent, experienced, and fully capable \nto represent the interests in the individual Plaintiffs and all class members. \nYoung next argues that Plaintiffs' counsel, Disability Rights of Texas, may not be able to \nadequately represent Plaintiffs because Disability Rights of Texas is charged with protecting both \ncivil and criminal commitments to the Department. Relying on Krim v. pcOrder. corn, Inc.  Young \nasserts that the relief sought in this case would at least implicitly eliminate the Department's bed \ncapacity for civil commitments, creating a potential conflict of interest.  In response, Plaintiffs note \nthat the relief sought requires only the enforcement of a time limit for how long the class members \ncan remain on a waitlist for placement in a Department facility.  Plaintiffs do not seek to reduce the \nnumber of civil-commitment beds.  Moreover, Young offers no evidence or authority for the \nproposition that class counsel can be found inadequate based on an implicit conflict of interest \ninvolving persons not involved in this case or any other pending litigation. Young's reliance on Kim \nis misplaced.  Because the interests of Plaintiffs are aligned with the proposed class members, and \nPlaintiffs' counsel can adequately represent Plaintiffs and the class members, the court finds that the \nrequirements of Rule 23(a)(4) are satisfied. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) \nPlaintiffs  seek class-action certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), \nauthorizing certification where \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \nthat apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is \nappropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"  \"Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction \nwould provide relief to each member of the class.\" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 360.  The \n210 F.R.D. 581, 589 (W.D. Tex. 2002). \n17 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 18 of 20\nFifth Circuit has interpreted Rule 23(b)(2) to create two relevant requirements when a proposed class \nseeks classwide injunctive relief: (1) the \"class members must have been harmed in essentially the \nsame way,\" Maldonado v. Ochsner Clinic Found., 493 F.3d 521, 524 (5th Cir. 2007), and (2) \"the \ninjunctive relief sought must be specific.\" Id.  (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)). \nThe court finds that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) have been satisfied. Young seemingly \nholds incompetent detainees in county jails for extended periods after they have been committed to \nthe Department's custody for restorative or evaluation services pursuant to a first come, first served \npolicy generally applicable to all proposed class members.  Therefore, the proposed class members \ninjuries are similar. \nIn addition, the proposed class members' injuries can be remedied through an injunction that \ndoes not differentiate between class members. If Plaintiffs can establish that Young violates the due- \nprocess rights of the proposed class members, the court may render an injunction that will state with \nspecificity the acts to be restrained or required without the need for specific relief tailored to each \nclass member.  Therefore, the court concludes that class certification is appropriate. \nConclusion \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification filed June \n17, 201 (Doc. #104) is GRANTED IN PART AS FOLLOWS: \nThis action shall proceed as a class action with one class certified under Rule 23(c) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure consisting of: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a crime in the State of \nTexas, (b) ordered by a Texas court to a Texas Department of State Health Services facility where \nthey are to receive competency-restoration services; but (c) because the Texas Department of State \n18 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 19 of 20\nHealth Services maintains insufficient forensic capacity, (d) remain detained in a Texas county jail \nmore than 21 days from the day the Texas Department of State Health Services receives the court \norder to  the day the  Texas Department  of Health  Services makes a bed available  in a Texas \nDepartment of Health Services mental health facility; and \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Disability Rights Texas and Winston & Strawn, L.L.C. \nare  appointed as class counsel for the above class pursuant to Rule 23(g) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nAt the time Plaintiffs' Fifth Amended Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief was \nfiled on May 9, 2019 (Doe. #97), the named individual  Plaintiffs were members of a class of \nincompetent detainees who remained housed for prolonged periods in Texas county jails without \nadequate mental-health treatment for a bed to become available in a Department facility, or who had \nbeen awaiting transfer at the time they were added to the case by amendment, and the record does \nnot indicate whether at least one of named individual Plaintiffs is still housed in a county jail as of \nthe date of this order.  Because the length of time in county jail cannot be ascertained at the outset, \nand it may be ended at any time by transfer to a mental-health facility, it is by no means certain that \nany of the named individual Plaintiffs would be in pretrial custody long enough for a this court to \ncertif' the class.  Thus, this case belongs to a narrow class of cases in which the termination of a \nclass representative's claim does not moot the claims of the unnamed members of the class.  See \nGerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 111(1975).  Therefore, \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffs Joseph Ward, Marc Lawson, Kenneth Jones, \nJennifer Lampkin, and Julian Torres are conditionally appointed to represent the class of persons \nfound incompetent to stand trial. \n19 \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-LY   Document 137   Filed 03/29/22   Page 20 of 20\nIn all other respects, Plaintiffs' motion is DENIED. \nIT IS FINALLY ORDERED that a Conference after Class Certification is set in Courtroom \nNo. 7, Seventh Floor of the United States Courthouse, 501 West 5th Street, Austin, Texas, on April \n19, 2022, at 9:30 a.m. \nSIGNED this  day of March, 2022. \nL(YEAKEL  I  I \nUITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n20 ",

When an individual charged with a crime is found to be incompetent to stand trial, all \ncriminal proceedings cease, and the sole purpose for the personโs continued detention is โ[f]or \npurposes of further examination and competency restoration services with the specific objective of \nthe defendant attaining competency to stand trial.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art. 46B.073(b). Texas \nlaw further requires that the criminal court order these specialized competency restoration services \nbe provided in a Texas Health and Human Services Commission (โHHSCโ)1 operated and contracted \nmental health facility2 or in an HHSC funded jail-based or community-based competency restoration \nprogram. In practice, these services are provided primarily in HHSC mental health facilities, with \njail-based and community-based programs serving defendants found incompetent to stand trial in \nonly limited circumstances. \n2.  Because HHSC lacks sufficient forensic capacity, HHSC refuses to accept custody of \nthose ordered into its care and instead places persons found incompetent to stand trial on waiting lists \nuntil a bed at an HHSC mental health facility becomes available. It is common for these individuals, \nafter the issuance of the orders committing them to HHSC facilities, to wait in jail for many months \nuntil HHSC accepts custody of them. \n3.  Often,  incompetency  detainees,  despite  being  presumed  innocent,  are  ultimately \nincarcerated in jail prior to adjudication and awaiting treatment longer than if they had been found \nguilty of the alleged crime.  \n4.  This situation is not new. To manage forensic access to its mental health facilities, \nHHSC created its waiting lists for individuals found incompetent to stand trial and ordered to an \n                                                      \n1 As of September 1, 2017, oversight of the state hospitals and behavioral health programs, formerly \nthe purview of the Department of State Health Services, was moved under the oversight of the Health \nand Human Services Commission. \n2 When Plaintiffs refer to HHSC mental health facilities, this term encompasses the entire system of \nall HHSC operated, funded, and contracted inpatient psychiatric beds. \n2 \n\nHHSC  mental  health  facility  in  2006.  Since  2006,  the  number  of  criminal  defendants  found \nincompetent and ordered to an HHSC mental health facility for competency restoration services has \nonly increased. \n5.  As a result of the delays caused by HHSC, incompetency detainees languish in county \njails absent criminal convictions until beds become available at HHSC mental health facilities. These \ndelays harm Plaintiffs and the Class Members because Texas jails are not designed or authorized to \nprovide competency restoration treatment for incompetency detainees, outside of the handful of jail-\nbased competency restoration programs available in the State which serve a limited number of \nindividuals. As a result, Plaintiffs and the Class Members are left with no meaningful competency \nrestoration services while they wait in jail for a bed at an HHSC mental health facility. As such, \nPlaintiffs and the Class Members suffer needless deterioration of their mental health as they wait for \nmany months in county jails, often in prolonged isolation, before they receive the services HHSC is \nresponsible for providing. \n6.  The delays caused by HHSC violate the due process rights of incompetency detainees as \nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendant has a duty to accept and provide state-\nmandated restoration services to detainees committed to its care within a reasonable period of time, \nwhich must be measured in days, not months. Defendantโs failure to timely accept transfer of \nincompetency detainees to its facilities and to provide timely restoration services, however, forces \nPlaintiffs and Class Members to remain incarcerated for many months in county jails absent criminal \nconvictions and without any of the court-ordered competency restoration services that Defendant and \nHHSC are statutorily required to provide. Accordingly, Plaintiffs and Class Members seek a declaration \nof their rights and an order enjoining Defendant from violating their rights. \n3 \n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n7.  This civil action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of law of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. This Court has jurisdiction over \nthis action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (civil rights). \n8.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b). \n \nPARTIES \n \n9.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward was a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent to \nstand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required \nthe Sheriff to transport Mr. Ward to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs \norder, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Ward to an HHSC mental health \nfacility; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris \nCounty Jail for fifty-nine (59) weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on \nApril 4, 2017. Mr. Ward did not and could not receive competency restoration services in jail. Because \nPlaintiff Wardโs mental state limits his ability to protect his legal interests, a next friend is necessary \nto represent his interests. Plaintiff Wardโs defense attorney was the Harris County Public Defender. \nBarbara Drumheller, Harris County Public Defender, has volunteered and agreed to serve as Plaintiff \nWardโs next friend. \n10.  Plaintiff Marc Lawson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 390th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas. On or about May 11, 2016, Mr. Lawson was found incompetent to \nstand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required \nthe Sheriff to transport Mr. Lawson to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs \n4 \n\norder, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Lawson to an HHSC mental health \nfacility; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis \nCounty Jail for sixty (60) weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on July \n20, 2017. Mr. Lawson did not and could not receive competency restoration services in jail. Because \nPlaintiff Lawsonโs mental state limits his ability to protect his legal interests, a next friend is necessary \nto represent his interests. Plaintiff Lawsonโs defense attorney, Krista Chacona, has volunteered and \nagreed to serve as Plaintiff Lawsonโs next friend. \n11.  Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin was a defendant in a criminal case in the 403rd Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas. On or about March 31, 2016, Ms. Lampkin was found \nincompetent to stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The \norder also required the Sheriff to transport Ms. Lampkin to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite \nthe criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Ms. Lampkin to an \nHHSC mental health facility; instead, she was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, she was \nincarcerated in the Travis County Jail for sixty-five (65) weeks before being admitted to North Texas \nState Hospital-Vernon on July 6, 2017. Ms. Lampkin did not and could not receive competency \nrestoration services in jail. Because Plaintiff Lampkinโs mental state limits her ability to protect her \nlegal interests, a next friend is necessary to represent her interests. Plaintiff Lampkinโs defense \nattorney, Elsie Craven, has volunteered and agreed to serve as Plaintiff Lampkinโs next friend. \n12.  Plaintiff Kenneth Jones is a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about August 10, 2017, Mr. Jones was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required \nthe Sheriff to transport Mr. Jones to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs \n5 \n\norder, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Jones to an HHSC mental health \nfacility; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris \nCounty Jail for forty-nine (49) weeks before being admitted to Rusk State Hospital on July 19, 2018. \nMr. Jones did not and could not receive competency restoration services while in jail. \n13.  After returning from Rusk State Hospital, Mr. Jones was again found incompetent to \nstand trial on or about April 1, 2021 and was again ordered to be committed to a mental health facility. \nThe order also required the Sheriff to transport Mr. Jones to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite \nthe criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Jones to an \nHHSC mental health facility; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he has \nbeen incarcerated in the Harris County Jail for eighty-two (82) weeks as of the filing of this complaint, \nwaiting to be accepted to an HHSC mental health facility. Because Plaintiff Jonesโs mental state limits \nhis ability to protect his legal interests, a next friend is necessary to represent his interests. Plaintiff \nJonesโs defense attorney, Patricia Sedita, has volunteered and agreed to serve as Plaintiff Jonesโs next \nfriend. \n14.  Plaintiff Mary Sapp is a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District Court \nin Harris County, Texas. On or about June 22, 2016, Ms. Sapp was found incompetent to stand trial \nand was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and treatment \ntoward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required the Sheriff \nto transport Ms. Sapp to an HHSC Mental Health Facility. Despite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC \ndid not allow Harris County to timely transfer Ms. Sapp to an HHSC mental health facility; instead, \nshe was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, she was incarcerated in the Harris County Jail \nfor eight (8) weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on August 23, 2016. \nMs. Sapp did not and could not receive competency restoration services in jail. Because Plaintiff \nSappโs mental state limits her ability to protect her legal interests, a next friend is necessary to \n6 \n\nrepresent her interests. Plaintiff Sappโs defense attorney, Lourdes Rodriguez, has volunteered and \nagreed to serve as Plaintiff Sappโs next friend. \n15.  Plaintiff Julian Torres was a defendant in a criminal case in the 5th County Court at \nLaw in Travis County, Texas. On or about April 16, 2019, Mr. Torres was found incompetent to stand \ntrial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and treatment \ntoward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required the Sheriff \nto transport Mr. Torres to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did \nnot allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Torres to an HHSC mental health facility; instead, he \nwas placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Jail for \nfour (4) weeks before being admitted to the Montgomery County Mental Health Treatment Facility, \nan HHSC-contracted mental health facility, on May 14, 2019. Mr. Torres did not and could not \nreceive competency restoration treatment in jail. Because Plaintiff Torresโs mental state limits his \nability to protect his legal interests, a next friend is necessary to represent his interests. Plaintiff \nTorresโs defense attorney was the Travis County Mental Health Public Defenderโs Office. Melissa \nShearer, Director of the Travis County Mental Health Public Defenderโs Office, has volunteered and \nagreed to serve as Plaintiff Torresโs next friend. \n16.  Defendant Cecile Young is currently the duly appointed Executive Commissioner of \nthe Texas Health and Human Services Commission and has been delegated the administration of that \nagency. As Executive Commissioner, Defendant Young is ultimately responsible for ensuring that \nHHSC is in full compliance with federal and state law, as well as agency rules, regulations, and \npolicies. Defendant Young is responsible for  โadministering human services programs regarding \nmental health, including: administering and coordinating mental health services at the local and state \nlevel; operating the stateโs mental health facilities,โ and โdesignat[ing] the state hospitals to which \npersons with mental illness from each district shall be admitted.โ TEX.

Defendant Young is sued in her official capacity and is served with this Sixth \nAmended Complaint through her attorneys of record, Kimberly Gdula, William Wassdorf, and \nChristopher Hilton of the Texas Attorney Generalโs Office. \nCLASS ACTION ALLLEGATIONS \n \n17.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated as members \nof the following plaintiff class: \nClass for Incompetent Detainees with Named Plaintiffs Joseph Ward, Marc Lawson, Jennifer \nLampkin, Kenneth Jones, Mary Sapp, and Julian Torres, through their next friends, being appointed \nas class representatives: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, (a) charged with a Texas \ncrime, (b) court-ordered to an HHSC mental health facility for competency \nrestoration  services;  but,  (c)  because  of  HHSCโs  insufficient  forensic \ncapacity, (d) remain incarcerated in a county jail more than twenty-one (21) \ndays from the day HHSC receives the court order to the day HHSC notifies \nthe jail the person can be admitted to an HHSC mental health facility. \n \n18.  On March 29, 2022, the Court issued an order (ECF No. 137), finding that Plaintiffs \nsatisfied the elements of class certification, certifying the class of Incompetency Detainees as \ndescribed above, and conditionally naming Joseph Ward, Marc Lawson, Jennifer Lampkin, Kenneth \nJones, and Julian Torres as class representatives. On June 10, 2022, the Court issued an order (ECF \nNo. 147) correcting its March 29, 2022 order to also conditionally name Mary Sapp as a class \nrepresentative. \n19.  The Court found that the Class was sufficiently numerous such that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable. At the time the Court considered class certification, there were over 615 \nputative members of the Class, with an unknown number of future Class Members. Consistent with \nthese findings, as of October 2022, there were over 2500 individuals on HHSCโs waiting lists who, \nalthough ordered to an HHSC mental health facility to receive competency restoration services, \n8 \n\nremained incarcerated in jail. Most have been waiting in jail longer than twenty-one (21) days; in \nfact, many have been waiting for over a year. As before, there continues to be an unknown number \nof future Class Members. \n20.  The Court found the Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all Class Members. \nBecause  of  Defendantโs  insufficient  forensic  capacity,  the  individual  Plaintiffs  and  the  Class \nMembers have all been adjudicated, or will be adjudicated, incompetent to stand trial and are, or will, \nremain incarcerated in jail more than twenty-one (21) days waiting for a bed at an HHSC mental health \nfacility to begin receiving the statutorily required competency restoration services. Plaintiffs and \nClass Members have similarly suffered harm or will suffer harm in the future arising from Defendantโs \nactions and inaction. \n21.  The Court found that common questions of law and fact exist as to all Class Members \nand predominate over any questions solely affecting individual Class Members. These common legal \nand factual questions include: \nWhether HHSC has failed to accept in a timely manner โ within twenty-one \n(21) days from the date HHSC is notified of the courtโs order to the date \nHHSC makes a bed available โ the ordered admission of Plaintiffs and other \nClass Members to its facilities for competency restoration treatment; \n \nWhether HHSCโs failure to admit Plaintiffs and other Class Members in a \nreasonably timely mannerโwithin  twenty-one (21) days  from  the  date \nHHSC is notified of the courtโs order to the date HHSC makes a bed \navailableโcausing them to remain incarcerated in county jails, violates the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory \nand injunctive relief they seek, including an order requiring HHSC to admit \nincompetency detainees to its mental health facilities within twenty-one \n(21) days from the date HHSC is notified of the courtโs order to the date \nHHSC makes a bed available; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of \nreasonable attorneysโ fees and costs. \n \n9 \n\n22.  Likewise, the Court found the Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and \nprotect the interests of the Class Members. There are no conflicts of interest between the Plaintiffs \nand the other Class Members. The Plaintiffs will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf of the \nother Class Members. The Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill \nand experience in civil rights and mental health litigation who will vigorously prosecute this case on \nbehalf of the Plaintiffs and Class Members. \n23.  The Court found HHSC has acted or failed or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the entirety of the Plaintiffs and the Class Members. \n24.  The Court found the claims asserted herein are capable of repetition yet evading \nreview and inherently transitory. There is a continuing and substantial public interest in these matters, \njustifying declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of Plaintiffs and the Class Members. \n25.  The Court found this suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) \nand (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs and Class Members seek declaratory \nand injunctive relief and all of the necessary factors of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and \nadequacy are present. \n26.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause  individual  litigation  of  these  claims  would  be  impracticable  and  would  be  unduly \nburdensome to the courts. Further, this suit is maintained as a class action because common questions \nof law and fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and individual \nlitigation would increase the likelihood of inconsistent or contradictory judgments. A class action \npresents fewer management difficulties and provides the benefits of a single adjudication, economy \nof scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \n10 \n\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n27.  Defendant and HHSC, through their actions and inaction, cause Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers to be incarcerated for weeks, months, or even years, before HHSC makes a bed available \nfor their court-ordered competency restoration treatment services. \nA.  Defendant Has a Duty to Timely Admit Detainees Found Incompetent to Stand Trial to \nan HHSC Mental Health Facility for Competency Restoration Services. \n \n28.  Under state and federal law, individuals who lack the ability to understand the nature \nof the criminal court proceedings against them may not be tried. \n29.  Article 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when a criminal defendantโs mental competency is challenged during \ncriminal proceedings. \n30.  A person is incompetent to stand trial if he or she does not have โsufficient present \nability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,โ or โa \nrational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. \nPROC. art. 46B.003(a). \n31.  โEither party may suggest by motion, or the trial court may suggest on its own motion, \nthat the defendant may be incompetent to stand trial.โ Id. at art. 46B.004(a) (emphasis added). โIf the \ncourt determines there is evidence to support a finding of incompetency, the court . . . shall stay all \nother proceedings in the case.โ Id. at (d) (emphasis added). An attorney is appointed, as well as an \nexpert to conduct an examination of the defendant, and a hearing is held on the defendantโs \ncompetency. Id. at arts. 46B.004, 46B.005, 46B.021, 46B.051. โIf the defendant is found incompetent \nto stand trial, the court shall proceed under Subchapter Dโ of Article 46B. Id. at art. 46B.055. \n32.  The defendantโs detention after a finding of incompetency is for solely โ[f]or purposes \nof  further  examination  and  competency  restoration  services  with  the  specific  objective  of  the \ndefendant attaining competency to stand trial.โ Id. at art. 46B.073(b) (emphasis added). \n11 \n\n33.  In keeping with this purpose, Subchapter D requires a court to order the defendant \ncommitted to a mental health facility, residential care facility, outpatient competency restoration \nprogram, or jail-based competency restoration program. Id. at art. 46B.071. \n34.  The order committing the defendant โmust place the defendant in the custody of the \nsheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to receive treatmentโ for purposes of \ncompetency restoration. Id. at art. 46B.075. \n35.  The courtโs determination regarding which facility or program a defendant will go to \nis based largely on the alleged crime and the availability of outpatient and/or jail-based programs. \nFor example, for a criminal defendant charged with an offense punishable as a Class B misdemeanor, \nthe court shall either release the defendant on bail to an outpatient competency restoration program \nor commit the defendant to a jail-based competency restoration program. Id. at arts.46B.0711, \n46B.073(e). However, if an outpatient program or jail-based program is not available, the court shall \ncommit the defendant to a mental health facility. Id. at art. 46B.073(f). In practice, most Class B \nmisdemeanors are still committed to HHSC mental health facilities. \n36.  The  courtโs  order  also  contains  an  expiration  dateโfor  incompetency  detainees \ncommitted to an HHSC mental health facility or jail-based competency restoration program, the \ncommitment period is not to exceed sixty (60) days for misdemeanor offenses and 120 days for \nfelonies. Incompetency detainees committed to outpatient competency restoration programs are \ncommitted not longer than sixty (60) days for class B misdemeanors and up to 120 days for all more \nserious offenses. These time periods do not begin to run until the date the person arrives at the mental \nhealth facility, jail-based competency restoration program, or outpatient competency restoration \nprogram. Id. at art. 46B.0735. This makes it essentially impossible for these defendants to make \nprogress towards the goal of being restored to competency while they are waiting in jail. \n12 \n\n37.  Courts release few defendants to outpatient competency restoration programs, mostly \ndue to their limited availability in the State. As of July 2021, Texas had only eighteen (18) outpatient \ncompetency restoration programs.  \n38.  This is also true of jail-based competency restoration programs, as they are available \nin only six Texas jails as of July 2021 and serve a limited number of incompetency detainees. Even \nwhere jail-based programs are available, defendants charged with a โviolent offenseโ as listed in \nArticle 17.032(a) or whose indictment alleges an affirmative finding under Article 42A.054(c) or (d) \n(regarding use or display of a deadly weapon) are automatically ineligible for competency restoration \nservices in a jail-based competency restoration program. Id. at art. 46B.071(c), (e).   \n39.  As a result of the limited availability of outpatient competency restoration programs \nand jail-based competency restoration programs, most defendants found incompetent to stand trial \nare committed to HHSC mental health facilities.3  \n40.  Once the defendant arrives at the mental health facility, the facility staff must: develop \nan individual program of treatment, assess and evaluate whether the defendant is likely to be restored \nto competency in the foreseeable future, and report to the court and local mental health or intellectual \nand developmental disability authority on the defendantโs progress toward achieving competency. Id. \nat art. 46B.077(a). \n41.  Not later than the 15th day before the date on which the restoration period is to expire, \nthe head of the facility must notify the court that the restoration period is about to expire. Id. at art. \n46B.079(a). Further, the head of the facility must also โpromptlyโ notify the court when the defendant \nhas attained competency to stand trial or upon a determination that the defendant is not likely to attain \ncompetency in the foreseeable future. Id. at art. 46B.079(b). \n                                                      \n3 A small minority of individuals whose incompetency to stand trial is due to an intellectual disability \nrather than mental illness will be committed to residential care facilities, also operated by Texas \nHHSC, for their competency restoration services. \n13 \n\n42.  On the return of the defendant to the court, the court must determine whether the \ndefendant has become competent to stand trial. Id. at art. 46B.084(a-1)(1). The court must make this \ndetermination not later than the 20th day after the court received the notice from the head of the facility \nrequired by article 46B.079. Id. at art. 46B.084(a). If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, \ncriminal proceedings may be resumed; if the defendant is again found incompetent to stand trial, the \ncourt may determine whether the defendant should be subject to civil commitment. Id. at art. \n46B.084(d) and (e). \nB.  County Jails are Unable to Provide Competency Restoration Services to Individuals \nFound Incompetent to Stand Trial. \n \n43.  County  jails  in  Texas  are  inappropriate  settings  for  the  care  and  treatment  of \nindividuals with mental illness and/or intellectual disabilities (formerly called โmental retardationโ) \nand for restoring a defendant to competency. \n44.  Adequate competency restoration treatment can occur only in a setting conducive to \nmental health treatment. A jail setting is neither conducive to health treatment nor competency \nrestoration treatment. Jail crowding, the threat of violence, the culture of punishment that permeates \nthe facilities, the relative inadequacy of programs and treatment, and the lack of officers have a very \ndetrimental effect on the mental states of incompetency detainees and on their abilities to participate \neffectively in competency restoration. This detrimental effect is often manifested by either increased \nsymptoms of their underlying psychiatric disorders or lack of improvement regarding their current \nsymptoms. \n45.  Studies and reports conclude that jail officers use more force and more excessive force \nagainst detainees with serious mental illness and engage in more human rights abuses against this \npopulation.4  \n                                                      \n4 See e.g. Jamie Fellner, Human Rights Watch, Callous and Cruel: Use of Force against Inmates with \nMental  Disabilities  in  US  Jails  and  Prisons,  May  2015,  available  at  \n14 \n\n46.   In contrast, at HHSC mental health facilities, clinical staff typically handle discipline \nproblems with treatment goals in mind and rarely call security officers. \n47.  Because of crowding, violence, isolation, the frequent use of force by  detention \nofficers and relatively inadequate mental health treatment and rehabilitation programs, individuals \nwith serious mental illness are at risk of harm while incarcerated in jail. \n48.  Detainees who are found incompetent to stand trial are often the inmates experiencing \nthe most severe symptoms of mental illness in Texas jail settings; thus they are often the inmates \nexperiencing the most abuses and deterioration as detailed above. \n49.  By refusing to timely take custody of incompetency detainees, Defendant causes such \npersons to be incarcerated in county jails under conditions nearly certain to exacerbate their mental \nhealth conditions. Because county jails are often unable to provide even basic mental health care, \nincompetency detainees frequently end up between a rock and a hard place: either they are housed in \nthe  general  jail  populationโoften  with  convicted  offendersโor  they are  placed  in  solitary \nconfinement, which causes their mental health to further deteriorate. This deterioration conflicts with \nthe Stateโs interest in prompt evaluation and treatment so that incompetency detainees may be brought \nto trial. \n50.  Nevertheless, Defendant knowingly, intentionally, and deliberately refuses to timely \naccept incompetency detainees court-ordered into one of its HHSC  mental  health  facilities  in \nviolation of the requirements of Chapter 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and the U.S. \nConstitution. \n                                                      \nhttps://www.hrw.org/report/2015/05/12/callous-and-cruel/use-force-against-inmates-mental-\ndisabilities-us-jails-and#8653. \n15 \n\nC.  Defendant  Has  Failed  to  Timely  Admit  Incompetency  Detainees  Who  Have  Been \nOrdered to an HHSC Mental Health Facility. \n \n51.  Texas is one of only thirteen states that provides inpatient psychiatric care at a level \nless than the estimated need and is among the stingiest states in per capita mental health spending.5   \n52.  In February 2006, due  to  its  insufficient  forensic capacity,  HHSC implemented \nwaiting lists to track detainees (both incompetency detainees and insanity acquittees)6 who remain in \njail while waiting for beds in an HHSC mental health facility. HHSC created two waiting lists to \nmanage its lack of forensic capacity: the Maximum Security Unit (โMSUโ) Admission List and the \nForensic Clearinghouse List. \n53.  HHSC requires all incompetency detainees committed to an HHSC mental health \nfacility to be placed on one of the waiting lists. HHSC uses these waiting lists to manage admissions \nto their HHSC mental health facilities. Admissions to an HHSC mental health facility are made almost \nexclusively on a first-come, first-served basis, contingent upon the capacity of an appropriate HHSC \nmental health facility. HHSC generally places individuals charged with misdemeanor and non-violent \noffenses on the Forensic Clearinghouse List and places individuals charged with violent offenses on \nthe MSU Admission List, though HHSC has discretion to determine which of the two lists it places \nan incompetency detainee on. \n54.  In June 2014, the number of incompetency detainees waiting to be transferred to an \nHHSC mental health facility was about 170; by February 2016, the number had risen to more than \n                                                      \n5 C.G. Hudson, Benchmarks for Needed Psychiatric Beds for the United States: A Test of a Predictive \nAnalytics  Model.  18  INT  J  ENVIRON  RES  PUBLIC  HEALTH  12205  (Nov.  2021)  available  at \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8625568/;    Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health \nServices Administration, Funding and Characteristics of Single State Agencies for Substance Abuse \nServices and State Mental Health Agencies, 2015, HHS Pub. No. (SMA) SMA-17-5029 (2017) \navailable at https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/d7/priv/sma17-5029.pdf. \n6 While HHSC places insanity acquittees on its lists, because the certified Class represents only those \ndefendants found incompetent to stand trial, discussion of the waiting lists is limited to incompetency \ndetainees. \n16 \n\n380; as of the filing of this Sixth Amended Complaint, that number has increased six-fold, to over \n2500.  \n55.  In September 2017, 283 individuals were waiting in county jails for a maximum-\nsecurity bed; as of the filing of this complaint, that number has increased to approximately 995 \nindividuals, many if not most of whom had been waiting in a county jail longer than twenty-one (21) \ndays.  \n56.  As for the waitlist for a non-maximum-security bed, the waitlist has increased sixteen \ntimes over, from ninety-six (96) individuals in September 2017 to 1,547 as of October 2022. While \nonly four (4) individuals had been waiting longer than twenty-one (21) days for a non-maximum-\nsecurity bed in September 2017, many if not most of the 1,547 individuals currently waiting have \nwaited longer than twenty-one (21) days.  \n57.  In April 2016, the longest wait time for a non-maximum-security bed was 122 days or \napproximately four (4) months. As of September 2022, the average wait time had doubled to 241 \ndays, or approximately eight (8) months, with some waiting longer. For maximum security beds, the \naverage wait time in April 2016 was 275 day, approximately nine (9) months; as of September 2022, \nthe  average  wait  time  for  a  maximum-security  bed  had  more  than  doubled  to  699  days,  or \napproximately twenty-three (23) months. \n58.  Defendantโs delay in admitting those found incompetent to stand trial infringes on their \nrights to be free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction as well as their abilities to receive \ntheir court-ordered competency-restoration treatment, which necessarily extends the time within \nwhich an individual can be tried once restored to competency. \n59.  Because criminal defendants found incompetent to stand trial have not been convicted \nof any crime, they have a liberty interest in freedom from incarceration. Because the detention of \n17 \n\nincompetency detainees is solely for the purpose of restorative treatment, Defendantโs lack of funds, \nstaff, or facilities are not legitimate excuses that justify Defendantโs failures. \n60.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, the Plaintiffs and Class Members \nwill continue to be deprived of their liberty without due process of law, in violation of their \nconstitutional rights. \nD.  Defendant  Has  Failed  to  Provide  Competency  Restoration  Services  to  the  Class \nPlaintiffs in a Timely Manner. \n \n1.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward \n \n61.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward was a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent to \nstand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required \nthe Sheriff to transport Mr. Ward to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs \norder, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Ward to an HHSC mental health \nfacility; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris \nCounty Jail for fifty-nine (59) weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on \nApril 4, 2017. Mr. Ward did not and could not receive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n62.  Mr. Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, epilepsy, asthma, and \nhypertension.  Harris  County  Jail  staff  noted  that  Mr.  Ward  has  a  history  of  neurocognitive \nimpairment. In February 2016, during a mental health assessment, staff noted Mr. Wardโs confusion \nand inability to remember information such as street names, locations, and names of doctors. Staff \nnoted that โcompetency restoration may be unlikely or slow based on current clinical presentation of \nthe assessment.โ \n18 \n\n63.  Mr. Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he has been \nfound incompetent to stand trial. During his most recent incarceration, Mr. Ward requested and \nvoluntarily took his psychotropic medications; however, he continued to report command auditory \nhallucinations throughout his incarceration. \n2.   Plaintiff Marc Lawson \n64.  Plaintiff Marc Lawson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 390th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas. On or about May 11, 2016, Mr. Lawson was found incompetent to \nstand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required \nthe Sheriff to transport Mr. Lawson to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs \norder, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Mr. Lawson to an HHSC mental health \nfacility; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he was incarcerated in the Travis \nCounty Jail for sixty (60) weeks before being admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on July \n20, 2017. Mr. Lawson did not and could not receive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n65.  Mr. Lawson was twenty-two (22) years old at the time of his detention, had never \npreviously been incarcerated, and had been in the Texas Child Protective Services system since age \nfive. Mr. Lawson is diagnosed with an intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, \nattention deficit  hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial personality \ndisorder, epilepsy/seizure disorder, and Hepatitis C. Mr. Lawson has a history of treatment at \npsychiatric hospitals and receiving psychotropic medication from a young age. \n66.  During Mr. Lawsonโs incarceration, jail personnel  reported that he had obvious \ncognitive deficits and poor social skills. He was categorized as vulnerable, and jail personnel \ndocumented concerns over his being housed in a cell with other inmates due to his vulnerability. \nUpon his admission, Mr. Lawson was initially placed in full suicide precaution and/or psychiatric \n19 \n\nlockdown housing for about one (1) week. While in psychiatric lockdown and full suicide precaution \nhousing, Mr. Lawson was permitted outside of his cell for only one (1) hour a day, and it was not \nguaranteed that he would receive any time outdoors. He was then transferred to and housed in a single \ncell for over two (2) months. Mr. Lawson was prescribed two (2) medications for his medical \nconditions and one (1) antipsychotic. The Travis County Jail classified his mental health and medical \nneeds as โsevere.โ \n3.   Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin \n67.  Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin was a defendant in a criminal case in the 403rd Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas. On or about March 31, 2016, Ms. Lampkin was found \nincompetent to stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The \norder also required the Sheriff to transport Ms. Lampkin to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite \nthe criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to timely transfer Ms. Lampkin to an \nHHSC mental health facility; instead, she was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, she was \nincarcerated in the Travis County Jail for sixty-five (65) weeks before being admitted to North Texas \nState Hospital-Vernon on July 6, 2017. Ms. Lampkin did not and could not receive competency \nrestoration treatment in jail. \n68.  Ms. Lampkin is diagnosed with an intellectual disability and bipolar disorder. She also \nhas a history of psychosis, resulting in numerous emergency psychiatric hospitalizations.  She has a \nlong history of mental illness and has a history of being treated by Integral Care, the local mental \nhealth authority for Travis County. \n69.  While incarcerated, Ms. Lampkin exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related to her \nmental health condition.  Records by the jail counselor indicated that Ms. Lampkin has obvious \ncognitive deficits and is low functioning. Ms. Lampkin was housed exclusively in psychiatric housing \n20 \n\nand, in July 2016, the jail counselor reported that she is โstruggling due to isolation.โ Moreover, the \njail conditions affected Ms. Lampkinโs physical condition. Over the duration of her incarceration, Ms. \nLampkin lost over thirty pounds. \n4.  Plaintiff Kenneth Jones \n70.  Plaintiff Kenneth Jones is a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about August 10, 2017, Mr. Jones was found incompetent to \nstand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required \nthe Sheriff to transport Mr. Jones to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs \norder, HHSC did not allow Harris County to timely transfer Mr. Jones to an HHSC mental health \nfacility; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, he was incarcerated in the Harris \nCounty Jail for forty-nine (49) weeks before being admitted to Rusk State Hospital on July 19, 2018. \nFollowing his return from Rusk State Hospital, Mr. Jones was again found incompetent to stand trial \non or around April 1, 2021. Though committed to a mental health facility and ordered into the custody \nof the Sheriff for transport to an HHSC mental health facility, Mr. Jones remains in jail. Mr. Jones \ndid not and could not receive competency restoration treatment in jail. \n71.  Mr. Jones has a long psychiatric history and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder \nand post-traumatic stress disorder. During his first incarceration, Mr. Jones requested and voluntarily \ntook his psychotropic medications; however, in May of 2017, he reported that his medication was not \nworking and that he had become suicidal. Mr. Jonesโs medications were adjusted, but he continued \nto report visual hallucinations and delusions during his incarceration. Mr. Jones also had several \naltercations with other inmates resulting in at least three disciplinary charges. \n21 \n\n5.  Plaintiff Mary Sapp \n72.  Plaintiff Mary Sapp was a defendant in a criminal case in the 185th Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas. On or about June 22, 2016, Ms. Sapp was found incompetent to stand \ntrial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and treatment \ntoward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also required the Sheriff \nto transport Ms. Sapp to an HHSC mental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC \ndid not allow Harris County to timely transfer Ms. Sapp to an HHSC mental health facility; instead, \nshe was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As a result, she was incarcerated for eight (8) weeks before \nbeing admitted to North Texas State Hospital-Vernon on August 23, 2016. Ms. Sapp did not and could \nnot receive competency restoration treatment in jail.  \n73.  When she was incarcerated and waiting for a bed after being found incompetent to \nstand trial, Ms. Sapp was sixty-six (66) years old and was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, \nCOPD, diabetes, stage three chronic kidney disease, asthma, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and spinal \ndegeneration. Prior to being incarcerated, Ms. Sapp was receiving outpatient psychiatric services. Ms. \nSapp had a number of falls while incarcerated at Harris County Jail waiting for a bed at an HHSC \nmental health facility. \n6.  Plaintiff Julian Torres \n74.  Plaintiff Julian Torres was a defendant in a criminal case in the 5th County Court at \nLaw of Travis County, Texas. Within five (5) days of his arrest, Mr. Torres was found incompetent \nto stand trial and, on or about April 16, 2019, and was ordered to be committed to a mental health \nfacility  for  further  examination  and  treatment  toward  the  specific  objective  of  attaining \ncompetency to stand trial. The order also required the Sheriff to transport Mr. Ward to an HHSC \nmental health facility. Despite the criminal courtโs order, HHSC did not allow Travis County to transfer \nMr. Torres to one of its mental health facilities; instead, he was placed on an HHSC waiting list. As \n22 \n\na result, he was incarcerated in the Travis County Correctional Complex for four (4) weeks before \nbeing admitted to the Montgomery County Mental Health Treatment Facility, an HHSC-contracted \nmental health facility, on May 14, 2019. Mr. Torres did not and could not receive competency \nrestoration treatment in jail.  \n75.  Mr. Torres is diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mental health condition was so \ndeteriorated that he spent the first week of his incarceration on the acute psychiatric unit at the Travis \nCounty Jail. He was then transferred to a single-cell mental health pod where he spent twenty-two \n(22) hours a day isolated in his cell. This is at least the third time Mr. Torres has been found \nincompetent to stand trial, having spent several months at Austin State Hospital in 2017 and \nMontgomery  County  Mental  Health  Treatment  Facility  in  2018  on  competency  restoration \ncommitments. \nCAUSE OF ACTION:  \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \nDefendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Incompetency Detaineesโ Rights Under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n \n76.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 75 above are incorporated herein. \n \n77.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution prohibits states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process \nof law. \n78.  Criminal  defendants  who  have  not  been  convicted  and  have  been  adjudicated \nincompetent to stand trial have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration, in receiving restorative \ntreatment, in the right not to be punished, and in safe conditions of confinement. \n79.  To ensure Plaintiffs and Class Members are not punished prior to an adjudication of \nguilt, due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement bear a reasonable relation to \nthe purpose for which they are confined. \n23 \n\n80.  On a suggestion that an individual is found unable to aid and assist in their own \ndefense, all criminal proceedings must stop. The only stated lawful purpose for their continued \nconfinement after an incompetency determination is commitment for restorative treatment so as to \nreturn them to competency \n81.  With limited exceptions where there are jail-based competency restoration programs, \ncounty jails do not provide Plaintiffs or Class Members with the restorative treatment required by \nstate law. Instead, facilities funded by Defendant provide restorative treatment to the vast majority of \nClass Members. No legitimate state interest justifies the continued incarceration of Plaintiffs and \nClass Members in county jails for months on end after they are found incompetent to stand trial, \nespecially when there are state-mandated, less harsh alternatives. \n82.  Defendantโs insufficient forensic capacity therefore punishes the Plaintiffs and Class \nMembers by forcing them to languish in county jails for months without state-mandated restorative \ntreatment before making a bed available at one of its facilities where they can receive such treatment. \n83.  The nature and duration of Plaintiffsโ and Class Membersโ incarcerations bear no \nreasonable relation to the restorative purpose for which the courts have committed these individuals, \nviolating their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. \n84.  The Plaintiffs and Class Members are entitled to an order of the Court declaring that, \nby requiring persons found incompetent to stand trial to remain in county jails for protracted periods \nand by failing to provide restorative treatment in a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated \nthe Fourteenth Amendment due process rights of the Plaintiffs and Class Members. \n85.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and Class Members. The Plaintiffs and Class Members are therefore entitled to \nan order of the Court enjoining Defendant from further violations of the Plaintiffsโ and Class \n24 \n\nMembersโ rights to due process in relation to their continued incarceration in jail while awaiting beds \nat HHSC mental health facilities where they can receive the state-mandated restorative treatment. \nATTORNEYSโ FEES \n \n86.  Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneysโ fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nTHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to: \n \nA.  Enter an Order declaring that, by requiring Plaintiffs and other Class Members to \nremain incarcerated in county jails for protracted periods and not timely making a bed available to \nthem for purposes of state-mandated restorative treatment servicesโwithin twenty-one (21) days of \nreceiving the court order committing them to an HHSC mental health facility, Defendant is depriving \nthem of their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nB.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief restraining Defendant from failing \nto make a bed available to detainees found incompetent to stand trial for purposes of the state-\nmandated restoration services within a reasonable time periodโwithin twenty-one (21) days from the \ndate HHSC is notified of the courtโs order to the date HHSC makes a bed availableโor enter other \ninjunctive relief sufficient to prevent Defendant from violating the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited  States  Constitution  in  relation  to  the  confinement  of  individuals  awaiting  competency \nrestoration treatment; \nC.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs; and \n \nD.  Grant all relief in law or equity that the Court may deem just and proper. \n \n   \n25 \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n \nBETH MITCHELL \nState Bar No. 00784613 \nbmitchell@drtx.org \n \nPETER HOFER \nState Bar No. 09777275 \nphofer@drtx.org \n \nLISA SNEAD \nState Bar No. 24062204 \nlsnead@drtx.org \n \nDISABILITY RIGHTS TEXAS \n2222 West Braker Lane \nAustin, Texas 78758 \n(512) 454-4816 (Phone) \n(512) 454-3999 (Fax) \n \nCOTY MEIBEYER \nState Bar No. 24085469 \nDISABILITY RIGHTS TEXAS \n1500 McGowen, Suite 100 \nHouston, Texas 77004 \n(713) 974-7691 (Phone) \n(713) 974-7695 (Fax) \ncmeibeyer@drtx.org \n \nJOHN MICHAEL GADDIS \nState Bar No. 24069747 \nWINSTON & STRAWN LLP \n2121 N.

When an individual charged with a crime is found to be incompetent to stand trial, \nTexas law requires that the Texas Department of State Health Services (โthe Departmentโ or \nโDSHSโ) provide the incompetent detainee with treatment aimed at restoring the individual to \ncompetency.  Texas law further requires that this specialized competency restoration treatment \nmust be provided by the Department, and the treatment can only be provided in a state mental \nhealth facility or, under certain circumstances and with proper supervision, in a community-based \noutpatient program overseen by the Department.1 \n2.  When an individual charged with a crime is found not guilty by reason of insanity, \nand the court determines that the offense of which the person was acquitted involved dangerous \nconduct, Texas law requires that the court commit the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by \nthe Department for evaluation of the personโs present mental condition and for treatment.  These \nservices can only be provided by the Department.  Texas law states that the insanity acquittee \ncannot remain in jail awaiting transfer to a facility designated by the Department for a period \nlonger than 14 days. \n3.  Because the Departmentโs facilities are full, the Department refuses to accept \ncustody of those ordered to its care and instead places persons found incompetent to stand trial and \npersons found not guilty by reason of insanity on a waiting list until a bed at a Department mental \nhealth facility becomes available.  It is not uncommon for these individuals, after the issuance of \n                                                           \n1 In 2013, the Texas Legislature appropriated money for two pilot jail-based competency restoration programs.  See \nActs 2013, 83rd Leg., ch. 797 (S.B. 1475), ยง 2, eff. Sept. 1, 2013.  As of the date of this filing, no jail-based \ncompetency-restoration program has been established.  Even if such a program is established, the Department will \nstill fund and operate the program. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 3 of 31\nthe order committing them to the Departmentโs facilities, to wait in jail for months until the \nDepartment accepts custody.   \n4.  Often, incompetent detaineesโdespite being presumed innocentโend up being \nincarcerated in jail prior to adjudication and pending treatment longer than if they had been found \nguilty of the alleged crime.  In addition, insanity acquitteesโdespite being acquittedโalso end up \nbeing  incarcerated  in  jail  for  months  after  an  adjudication  that  absolves  their  criminal \nresponsibility. \n5.  This situation is not new.  The Department created its waiting list for individuals \nfound incompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to a \nDepartment mental health facility in 2006.  Since 2006, the number of criminal defendants found \nincompetent or not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to a Department facility for evaluation \nand/or treatment has only increased. \n6.  As a result of the delays caused by the Department, incompetent detainees and \ninsanity acquittees languish in county jails absent a criminal conviction until a bed becomes \navailable at a Department mental health facility.  Additionally, Texas jails are not designed or \nadministered to provide either competency restoration treatment for incompetent detainees or \nevaluation and/or treatment services for the psychiatric needs of insanity acquittees, leaving \nPlaintiffs with no meaningful competency restoration or evaluation and treatment while they wait \nfor a bed at a Department facility.  As such, incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees suffer \nneedless deterioration of their mental health as they wait in jails, frequently in prolonged isolation, \nfor weeks and months before they receive the services Defendant is responsible for providing. \n7.  The delays caused by the Department violate the due process rights of incompetent \ndetainees and insanity acquittees as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Defendant has a \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 4 of 31\nduty to accept and treat detainees within a reasonable period of time, which must be measured in \ndays, not weeks or months.  For insanity acquittees, Texas law specifically mandates that such \npersons not remain in jail in excess of 14 days.  Defendantโs failure to timely accept transfer of \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees to its facilities and to provide timely restoration and \nevaluative treatment, however, forces Plaintiffs and members of the Classes they represent to \nremain incarcerated for weeks and months in county jails absent criminal convictions and without \nany of the  court-ordered competency restoration treatment or evaluation and/or treatment services \nthat Defendant and his Department are statutorily required to provide.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek \na declaration of their rights and an order enjoining Defendant from violating their rights.       \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This civil action is authorized by 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 to redress the deprivation under \ncolor of law of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.  This Court has jurisdiction \nover this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331 (federal question), and 28 U.S.C. ยง 1343 (civil rights). \n9.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).  \nPARTIES \n10.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt in Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, the Department has not allowed Harris County to transfer Mr. Ward to a \nstate mental health facility, and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Harris County \nJail.  Mr. Ward does not receive competency restoration treatment in Jail and has been waiting to \nbe transferred to a state mental health facility for competency treatment for over 27 weeks.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 5 of 31\nPlaintiff Joseph Wardโs current mental state limits his ability to protect his legal interests.

Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated as \nmembers of the following proposed plaintiff classes: \na.  Class  for  Incompetent  Detainees  with  Named  Plaintiffs  Joseph  Ward,  Michael \nAnderson, Isaac Lemelle, Marc Lawson, and Jennifer Lampkin, through their next \nfriend, being appointed as class representatives: \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 9 of 31\nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the \nState of Texas, and: (a) who are ordered to a Texas DSHS facility where they \nare  to  receive  competency  restoration  services;  and  (b)  for  whom  DSHS \nreceives the court order; but (c) who remain detained in a Texas county jail. \n \nb.  Class for Insanity Acquittees with Named Plaintiffs Cecil Adickes and Michael Gibson, \nthrough their next friend, being appointed as class representatives: \nAll persons who are now, or will be in the future, charged with a crime in the \nState of Texas and who are found not guilty by reason of insanity, and: (a) who \nare ordered to receive evaluation and/or treatment services at a DSHS facility; \n(b) for whom DSHS receives the court order; but (c) who remain detained in a \nTexas county jail for more than 14 days. \n \n19.  Plaintiffs  seek  class-wide  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  pursuant  to  Rule \n23(b)(2). \n20.  While the precise number of Class Members in each class is not known to Plaintiffs \nwith certainty because the number necessarily fluctuates, on information and belief, Plaintiffs \nestimate that there are approximately 346 individuals at present who, although ordered to a \nDepartment mental health facility to receive competency restoration services or evaluation and \ntreatment  services,  remain  incarcerated  in  jail  for  months  waiting  for  transportation  to  a \nDepartment mental health facility.  An exact number of current Class members in each class is \nknown to the Department and can be determined through discovery; as for potential future Class \nMembers, that number is indeterminable. \n21.  As for the class of individuals who have been found incompetent to stand trial, the \nPlaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class because the individual \nPlaintiffs and the Class have all been adjudicated, or will be adjudicated, to be incompetent to \nstand trial and are, or will be, incarcerated in jail while waiting for a bed at a Department mental \nhealth facility to receive the statutorily required competency restoration treatment.  Plaintiffs and \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 10 of 31\nall members of the Class have similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising \nfrom Defendantโs actions and inaction. \n22.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \nWhether the Department has failed to accept the ordered transfer of Plaintiffs and \nother Class Members to its facilities for competency-restoration treatment in a \ntimely manner; \n \nWhether Defendantโs failure to admit individuals determined incompetent to stand \ntrial and ordered to the DSHSโs mental health facilities for competency restoration \npurposes in a reasonably timely manner violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n23.  As for the class for individuals who have been found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity, the Plaintiffsโ claims are typical of the claims of all members of the Class because the \nindividual Plaintiffs and the Class have all been, or will be, found not guilty by reason of insanity \nand are, or will be, incarcerated in jail while waiting for a bed at a Department mental health \nfacility to receive the statutorily required evaluation and/or treatment services.  Plaintiffs and all \nmembers of the Class have similarly suffered harm, or will suffer harm in the future, arising from \nDefendantโs actions and inaction. \n24.  Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the Class and \npredominate over any questions solely affecting individual members of the Class.  These common \nlegal and factual questions include: \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 11 of 31\nWhether the Department has failed to accept transfer of individual Plaintiffs and \nother class members who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity for \nevaluation and/or treatment services in a timely manner; \n \nWhether the Departmentโs failure to admit individuals who have been found not \nguilty by reason of insanity and ordered by the criminal court to its mental health \nfacility for evaluation and/or treatment services in a reasonably timely manner \nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to the declaratory and \ninjunctive relief they seek; and \n \nWhether Plaintiffs and other Class Members are entitled to an award of reasonable \nattorneyโs fees and costs. \n \n25.  As to both proposed classes, Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and \nprotect the interests of the Class.  There are no conflicts of interest between the Plaintiffs and the \nother members of the Class.  The Class members will vigorously prosecute this action on behalf \nof the Class.  The Plaintiffs are represented by competent counsel with considerable skill and \nexperience in civil rights and mental health litigation, who will vigorously prosecute this case on \nbehalf of the Class. \n26.  For both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees, the Department has acted \nor failed or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the entire Class. \n27.  The claims asserted herein are capable of repetition while evading review.  There \nis a continuing and substantial public interest in these matters, justifying declaratory and injunctive \nrelief in favor of Plaintiffs and the Classes. \n28.  This suit may be maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and (b) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiffs and other members of the Classes seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, and all of the necessary factors of numerosity, commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy are present. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 12 of 31\n29.  A class action is the best available method for adjudication of these legal issues \nbecause  individual  litigation  of  these  claims  would  be  impracticable  and  would  be  unduly \nburdensome to the courts.  Further, this suit may be maintained as a class action because common \nquestions of law and fact predominate over questions affecting only individual class members, and \nindividual litigation would increase the likelihood of inconsistent or contradictory judgments.  A \nclass  action  presents  fewer  management  difficulties  and  provides  the  benefits  of  a  single \nadjudication, economy of scale, and comprehensive supervision by a single court. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n30.  Defendant  and  his  Department,  through  their  actions  and  inaction,  cause \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees to be incarcerated for weeks or months before the \nDepartment provides them their court-ordered competency restoration treatment, evaluation and/or \ntreatment services.  \nA.  Defendantโs duty to  timely  admit incompetent detainees to a DSHS  facility for \ncompetency restoration services \n \n31.  Under state and federal law, individuals who lack the ability to understand the \nnature of the criminal court proceedings against them may not be tried. \n32.  Article 46B of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when a criminal defendantโs mental competency is challenged during \ncriminal proceedings.  \n33.  A person is incompetent to stand trial if he or she does not have โsufficient present \nability to consult with the personโs lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,โ or \nโa rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against the person.โ  TEX.

Pursuant to Subchapter D, article 46B.071, the court, on a determination that a \ncriminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial, shall either commit the defendant to a mental \nhealth facility designated by the Department of State Health Services under 46B.073, or release \nthe defendant on bail subject to conditions under 46B.072.  Id., art. 46B.071. \n36.  For a defendant not released on bail, โ[t]he court shall commit a defendant . . . to a \nmental health facility or residential care facility for a period not to exceed 60 days (misdemeanor) \nor 120 days (felony) for further examination and treatment toward the specific objective of \nattaining competency to stand trial.โ  Id., art. 46B.073(b) (emphasis added). \n37.

If the defendant is not charged with one of the enumerated offenses, โthe court shall \nenter an order committing the defendant to a mental health facility or residential care facility . . ..โ  \nId., art. 46B.073(d). \n38.  An order committing the defendant for restoration of competency โmust place the \ndefendant in the custody of the sheriff for transportation to the facility in which the defendant is to \nreceive treatment for purposes of competency restoration.โ  Id., art. 46B.075. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 14 of 31\n39.  Not later than the date of the order of commitment, the court must send a copy of \nthe order to the facility to which the defendant is committed.  Id., art. 46B.076(a). \n40.  The facility to which the defendant is committed must: develop an individual \nprogram of treatment; assess and evaluate whether the defendant will obtain competency in the \nforeseeable future; and report to the court and local mental health or mental retardation authority \non defendantโs progress toward achieving competency.  Id., art. 46B.077(a).   \n41.  Not later than the 15th day before the date on which the restoration period is to \nexpire, the head of the facility must so notify the court that the restoration period is about to expire.  \nId., art. 46B.079(a).  Further, the head of the facility must also โpromptlyโ notify the court when \nthe defendant has obtained competency to stand trial or upon a determination that the defendant \nwill not attain competency in the foreseeable future.  Id., art. 46B.079(b).   \n42.  On the return of the defendant to the court, the court must make a determination as \nto the defendantโs competency to stand trial.  The court must make this determination not later \nthan the 20th day after the court received the notice from the head of the facility required by article \n46B.079. Id., art. 46B.084(a).  If the defendant is found competent to stand trial, criminal \nproceedings may be resumed; if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the court may \ndetermine whether the defendant should be subject to civil commitment. \nB.  Defendantโs duty to timely admit individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity to \na DSHS facility for evaluation and/or treatment \n \n43.  Article 46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedures that \nTexas courts must follow when the defense of insanity is raised on behalf of a criminal defendant. \n44.  A person is not guilty by reason of insanity if a judge or jury has determined: โ(1) \nthe prosecution has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged conduct constituting \nthe offense was committed; and (2) the defense has established by a preponderance of the evidence \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 15 of 31\nthat the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged conduct.โ TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. \nart. 46C.153(a). \n45.  โ[A] defendant who is found not guilty by reason of insanity stands acquitted of the \noffense charged and may not be considered a person charged with an offense.โ  Id., art. 46C.155(a) \n46.  Since the individual is acquitted of the offense and no longer considered a person \ncharged with an offense, โโฆthe court may [only] order the defendant detained in jail or any other \nsuitable place for a period not to exceed 14 days.โ Id., art. 46C.160(a). \n47.  Following a finding that an individual is not guilty by reason of insanity, the court \nmust immediately determine whether the offense of which the person was acquitted involved \ndangerous conduct, as defined in art. 46C.157.   \n48.  If the court determines that the offense involved dangerous conduct, โ[t]he court \nshall order the acquitted person to be committed for evaluation of the personโs present mental \ncondition and for treatment to the maximum security unit of any facility designated by the \n[Department of State Health Services].โ Id., art. 46C.251(a); see also 46C.001(2) (defining \nโdepartmentโ).   \n49.  When  there  is  a  finding  of  dangerous  conduct  and  an  insanity  acquittee  is \ncommitted to a Department facility for evaluation and/or treatment services, the facility designated \nby the Department receives a copy of the transcript of all medical testimony and certain identifying \ninformation regarding the insanity acquittee. Id., arts. 46C.251(b)(1)&(2).   \n50.  Upon transfer of the insanity acquittee to a facility designated by the Department \nwithin 14 days, and following the evaluation and/or treatment of the insanity acquittee, the \nDepartment must file a report that describes and explains the procedure, techniques, and tests used \nin the examination of the person. Id., art. 46C.252(b).  โThe report must address:  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 16 of 31\n(1) whether the acquitted person has a mental illness or [intellectual disability] and, \nif so, whether the mental illness or [intellectual disability] is severe; \n(2) whether as a result of any severe mental illness or [intellectual disability] the \nacquitted person is likely to cause serious harm to another;  \n(3) whether as a result of any impairment the acquitted person is subject to \ncommitment under Subtitle C or D, Title 7, Health and Safety Code;  \n(4) prospective treatment  and supervision  options, if any, appropriate for the \nacquitted person; and  \n(5) whether any required treatment and supervision can be safely and effectively \nprovided as outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision.โ \n \nId., art. 46C.252(c). \n \n51.  On the return of the insanity acquittee to court, the court shall conduct a hearing on \ndisposition and shall order the acquitted person (i) committed for inpatient treatment or residential \ncare, (ii) to receive outpatient or community-based treatment and supervision, (iii) transferred to \nan appropriate court for civil commitment proceedings under the Texas Health and Safety Code, \nor (iv) discharged and immediately released.  Id., arts. 46C.253(b)-(e). \nC.  County jails are unable to provide competency restoration services to individuals \nfound  incompetent  to  stand  trial  and  are  unable  to  provide  evaluation  and/or \ntreatment services to individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity \n \n52.  County jails in Texas are inappropriate settings for the care and treatment of \nindividuals with mental illness or intellectual disabilities (formerly called โmental retardationโ).  \nJails are not designed to be therapeuticโthey are inherently punitiveโnor do they provide any \ntreatment aimed at restoring a person to competency or evaluation and/or treatment services for \nindividuals found not guilty by reason of insanity. \n53.  Correctional facilities, particularly facilities designed for short-term detention, do \nnot have the staffing, funding, or capabilities to provide treatment aimed at restoring a person to \ncompetency or evaluation and/or treatment services for individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 17 of 31\n54.  Detainees who are found incompetent to stand trial and detainees who are found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity are often the most severely mentally ill in Texas jail settings. \n55.  Most  Texas  jails  do  not  have  the  ability  to  provide  even  basic  psychiatric \nstabilization and management.  As a result, many detainees with serious mental illness are harmed \nby the punitive jail setting as manifested by either increased symptoms of their underlying \npsychiatric disorder or lack of improvement regarding their current symptoms.  By refusing to \ntimely take custody of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees), Defendant \nand his Department cause such persons to be incarcerated in county jails under conditions nearly \ncertain to exacerbate their mental health condition(s). \n56.  Because county jails are often unable to provide even basic mental health treatment, \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees frequently end up between a rock and a hard place: \neither they are housed in the general jail populationโoften with convicted offendersโor they are \nplaced in solitary confinement, which causes their mental health to further deteriorate.  This \ndeterioration  conflicts  with  the  Stateโs  interest  in  prompt  evaluation  and  treatment  so  that \nincompetent detainees may be brought to trial, or so that insanity acquittees are not punished for \ncrimes they were acquitted of and are appropriately committed, transferred, or released.  \n57.  Besides struggling to provide even basic mental health care, county jails in Texas \ndo not have the specific services necessary to restore individuals to competency to stand trial, such \nas the most current medications, identification of specific social needs to restore and maintain \ncompetency, and training specific to the restoration of competency.  In contrast, state mental health \nfacilities are specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment to restore incompetent detainees \nto competence, thereby enabling them to stand trial.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 18 of 31\n58.  County jails in Texas also do not have the specific services necessary to provide \nevaluation and/or treatment services to insanity acquittees.  State mental health facilities, however, \nare specifically designed to provide inpatient treatment and to conduct evaluations to make \ncomplex determinations about a personโs mental health condition(s), including whether a person \nis likely to cause serious harm to another, whether a person is subject to commitment under the \nTexas Health and Safety Code, and determinations regarding the appropriateness, safety, and \neffectiveness of prospective treatment and supervision options.  \n59.  Nevertheless,  Defendant  knowingly,  intentionally,  and  deliberately  refuses  to \naccept individuals found incompetent to stand trial and individuals found not guilty by reason of \ninsanity into state mental health facilities in violation of the requirements of Chapters 46B and \n46C of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, the orders of the criminal courts, and the U.S. \nConstitution.        \nD.  Defendant has failed to timely admit incompetent detainees and insanity acquittees \nwho have been ordered to a Department mental health facility. \n \n60.  According to a 2014 Joint Report by the National Sheriffโs Association and the \nTreatment Advocacy Center, โTexas is among the states with the lowest number of public \npsychiatric beds and among the stingiest states in per capita mental health spending.โ  \n61.  Because the Department facilities are full, the Department places detainees (both \nincompetent detainees and insanity acquittees) on a waiting list until a bed becomes available at \nthe designated facility.   \n62.  In June of 2014, the number of detainees (both incompetent detainees and insanity \nacquittees) waiting to be transferred to a state mental health facility was about 170; by February \nof 2016, the number had risen to more than 380.  By February 2016, detainees were waiting an \naverage of 41 days in local jails.  As of April 1, 2016, the longest wait time for a non-maximum \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 19 of 31\nsecurity bed was 275 daysโalmost nine months.  According to the Department, as of April 1, \n2016, the average wait time for a maximum security bed was 122 days.  Currently, about 283 \nindividuals are waiting in county jails for a maximum security bed, and of those individuals, about \n246 have been waiting longer than 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting in jail for a \nmaximum security bed the longest has been waiting about 321 days.  As for the wait list for a non-\nmaximum security bed, there are currently about 96 individuals waiting in jail for such a bed, and \nof those 96, about 4 have been waiting longer than 21 days.  The individual who has been waiting \nin jail the longest for a non-maximum security bed has been waiting 34 days.   \n63.  According to a May 13, 2016 investigative report by ABC-13, state statistics going \nback to 2006 show that the number of detainees waiting in jails for competency restoration \ntreatment โhas never been this long,โ and that the number of individuals on the wait list has grown \nby โ20% in the last six months.โ   \n64.  The delay in admitting those found incompetent to stand trial infringes on their right \nto be free from incarceration absent a criminal conviction as well as the ability to receive \ncompetency-restoration treatment, which necessarily extends the time within which an individual \ncan be tried once restored to competency.   \n65.  The delay in admitting those found not guilty by reason of insanity infringes on \ntheir right to be free from incarceration after being absolved of criminal responsibility, as well as \ntheir ability to receive evaluation and treatment so that the criminal courts can reach final \ndispositions in the civil commitments.  \n66.  Because incompetent criminal defendants have not been convicted of any crime \nand insanity acquittees have been absolved of criminal responsibility, both classes of persons have \na liberty interest in freedom from incarceration, and a liberty interest in receiving treatment.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 20 of 31\nBecause the court has ordered that incompetent detainees must be provided with restorative \ntreatment and that insanity acquittees must be provided with evaluation and/or treatment services, \nlack of funds, staff, or facilities cannot justify the Defendantโs failure to provide the court-ordered \ntreatment in a timely manner. \n67.  As a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, the Individual Plaintiffs and the \nClasses will continue to be deprived of their liberty rights without due process of law, in violation \nof their constitutional rights.   \n68.  Plaintiff Joseph Ward is a defendant in a criminal case in the 351st Judicial District \nCourt of Harris County, Texas.  On or about February 17, 2016, Mr. Ward was found incompetent \nto stand trial and was ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination \nand treatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Harris County to transfer Mr. Ward to a state mental \nhealth facility, and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Harris County Jail.  Mr. Ward \ndoes not receive competency-restoration treatment in jail. \n69.  Mr. Ward has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, HIV, epilepsy, asthma, \nand hypertension.  Harris County Jail staff note that Mr. Ward has a history of neurocognitive \nimpairment.  In February 2016, during a mental health assessment, staff noted Mr. Wardโs \nconfusion and inability to remember information such as street names, location, and names of \ndoctors.  Staff noted that โcompetency restoration may be unlikely or slow based on current clinical \npresentation of the assessment.โ    \n70.  Mr. Ward has a long psychiatric history and previous incarcerations where he has \nbeen found incompetent to stand trial.  During this recent incarceration, Mr. Ward requested, and \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 21 of 31\ncurrently  voluntarily  takes,  his  psychotropic  medications;  however,  he  continues  to  report \ncommand auditory hallucinations as recently as May of 2016. \n71.  Plaintiff Michael Anderson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 299th Judicial \nDistrict Court, Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 18, 2016, Mr. Anderson was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial.  The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to the state mental health facility.  Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Anderson to a state \nmental health facility and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  \nMr. Anderson receives no competency restoration treatment in Jail.  \n72.  Mr. Anderson has been diagnosed with schizophrenic disorder, an intellectual \ndisability, schizoaffective disorder, and diabetes.  He has a long history of mental illness and has \nbeen treated by the Austin Travis County Mental Health Authority since 1993.  \n73.  While incarcerated, Mr. Anderson has exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related \nto his mental illness.  Records by the Jail counselor indicate that Mr. Anderson has exhibited \nincoherent thought processes and delusional content and thought processes.  As recently as June \n2016, records show that Mr. Anderson urinates on himself and in his cell.  Following this incident, \nMr. Anderson was placed in a single cell, where Jail staff are required to conduct visual checks \nevery 30 minutes.  \n74.  Plaintiff Isaac Lemelle is a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about March 30, 2016, Mr. Lemelle was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment toward the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 22 of 31\nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lemelle to the state mental health facility.   Despite the \ncriminal courtโs order, DSHS has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Lemelle to a state \nmental health facility, and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  \nMr. Lemelle does not receive competency restoration treatment in Jail. \n75.  Mr. Lemelle is diagnosed with unspecified schizophrenia and other psychotic \ndisorders and antisocial personality disorder. The Travis County Jail has classified his mental \nhealth needs as severe. He has a long history of mental illness, and was first treated by the Austin \nTravis County Mental Health Authority in 2008, at age thirteen.  \n76.  During his current incarceration, Mr. Lemelle has exhibited numerous symptoms \nand behaviors as a result of his mental illness, including throwing urine and smearing feces, \nbehaviors which have required his placement in the Jailโs psychiatric lockdown units in a single \ncell.  Individuals in psychiatric lockdown are permitted outside of their cell in the dayroom for one \nhour a day.  They are not guaranteed any time outdoors.  Jail personnel are required to conduct \nvisual checks every 30 minutes.  Mr. Lemelle has also required protective restraints.  \n77.  On  February  23,  2016,  while  Mr.  Lemelle  was  in  jail  waiting  to  be  found \nincompetent to stand trial, officers were notified that Mr. Lemelle stated he wanted to kill himself \nand may have swallowed a razor.  While attempting to place Mr. Lemelle in a restraint chair to \nexamine his mouth for a razor, and to transport him to an isolation cell, Mr. Lemelle spit at a \ncorrections officer.  This incident led to the additional charge of harassment of a public servant \nbeing pressed against Mr. Lemelle.  Following this incident, Mr. Lemelle was transported to a Full \nSuicide Precautions (โFSPโ) unit, where he was placed in a rubber cell and provided only a smock \nas clothing.  In FSP units, Jail staff are required to conduct 15 minute visual checks.  Medical and \npsychiatric evaluations and meetings are conducted through a food chute, i.e., a small opening on \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 23 of 31\nthe door of each individual cell that is used to pass food to the individuals.  Mr.  Lemelle has also \nbeen accused of approximately fifteen (15) rule violations (on four separate occasions) that \nrequired review by the Travis County Sheriffโs Office disciplinary board. \n78.  Plaintiff Marc Lawson is a defendant in a criminal case in the 390th Judicial District \nCourt in Travis County, Texas.  On or about May 11, 2016, Mr. Lawson was found incompetent \nto stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further examination and \ntreatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. The order also \nrequired the Sheriff to transport Mr. Lawson to a state mental health facility.  Despite the criminal \ncourtโs order, the Department has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Lawson to its state \nmental health facility and, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  \nMr. Lawson does not receive competency restoration treatment in Jail. \n79.  Mr. Lawson is twenty-two years old, has never previously been incarcerated, and \nhas been in the Texas Child Protective Services system since age five.  Mr. Lawson is diagnosed \nwith an intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder/ADHD,  Bipolar  Disorder,  Conduct  Disorder,  Antisocial  Personality  Disorder, \nEpilepsy/Seizure Disorder and Hepatitis C. Mr. Lawson has a history of treatment at psychiatric \nhospitals and utilization of medication from a young age.   \n80.  During Mr. Lawsonโs incarceration, Jail personnel report that he has obvious \ncognitive deficits and poor social skills.  He is categorized as vulnerable, and Jail personnel have \ndocumented concerns over his being housed in a cell with other inmates due to his vulnerability. \nUpon his admission, Mr. Lawson was initially placed in full suicide precaution and/or psychiatric \nlockdown housing for about one week. While in psychiatric lockdown and full suicide precaution \nhousing, Mr. Lawson was permitted outside of his cell for only one hour a day, and it was not \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 24 of 31\nguaranteed that he would receive any time outdoors.  He was then transferred to and housed in a \nsingle cell for over two months. Mr. Lawson is prescribed two medications for his medical \nconditions and one antipsychotic. The Travis County Jail has classified his mental health and \nmedical needs as severe.  \n81.  Mr. Lawsonโs psychiatric evaluation from May 2016 states that he is incompetent \nto stand trial and โcompetency cannot be restored in the foreseeable future with traditional \ncompetency restoration treatment due to the chronic nature of his condition.โ  The psychiatrist \ndocumented that although he is prescribed psychiatric medication, the medication โwill not \nimprove cognitive symptoms responsible for observed deficits relating to trial competency.โ  \n82.  Plaintiff Jennifer Lampkin is a defendant in a criminal case in the 403rd Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about April 6, 2016, Ms. Lampkin was found \nincompetent to stand trial and ordered to be committed to a mental health facility for further \nexamination and treatment towards the specific objective of attaining competency to stand trial. \nThe order also required the Sheriff to transport Ms. Lampkin to a state mental health facility.  \nDespite the criminal courtโs order, the Department has not allowed Travis County to transfer Ms. \nLampkin to its state mental health facility, and as a result, she continues to be incarcerated in the \nTravis County Jail.  Ms. Lampkin does not receive competency restoration treatment in Jail. \n83.  Ms. Lampkin is diagnosed with an Intellectual Disability and Bipolar Disorder. She \nalso has a history of psychosis, resulting in numerous emergency psychiatric hospitalizations.  She \nhas a long history of mental illness and has a history of being treated by Austin Travis County \nIntegral Care. \n84.  While incarcerated, Ms. Lampkin has exhibited symptoms of and behaviors related \nto her mental health condition.  Records by the jail counselor indicate that Ms. Lampkin has \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 25 of 31\nobvious cognitive deficits and is low functioning.  Ms. Lampkin has exclusively been housed in \npsychiatric housing, and as recently as July 2016, the jail counselor reports that she is โstruggling \ndue to isolation.โ  Moreover, the jail conditions have affected Ms. Lampkinโs physical condition.  \nOver the duration of her incarceration, Ms. Lampkin has lost over 30 lbs. \n85.  Plaintiff Cecil Adickes was a defendant in a criminal case in the 147th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about November 7, 2016, Mr. Adickes was found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental \nhealth facility for evaluation of his present mental condition and for treatment.

ANN art. 46C.160, the \nDepartment has not allowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Adickes to a state mental health facility, \nand, as a result, he continues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  Mr. Adickes has not \nreceived the court-ordered evaluation and treatment in Jail. \n86.  Plaintiff Michael Gibson was a defendant in a criminal case in the 427th Judicial \nDistrict Court in Travis County, Texas.  On or about September 9, 2016, Mr. Gibson was found \nnot guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered to be committed to a maximum security mental \nhealth facility for evaluation of his present mental condition.  Despite the criminal courtโs order \nand the 14-day time limit in TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN art. 46C.160, the Department has not \nallowed Travis County to transfer Mr. Gibson to a state mental health facility, and, as a result, he \ncontinues to be incarcerated in the Travis County Jail.  Mr. Gibson has not received the court-\nordered evaluation and treatment in Jail. \n87.  Mr. Gibson has a long history of mental illness, including more than fifteen prior \nhospitalizations.  He is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type and drug induced \npsychosis.  \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 26 of 31\nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \nA.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Incompetent Detainees Rights \nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \n88.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 89 above are incorporated \nherein. \n89.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n90.  Criminal defendants who have not been convicted and have been adjudicated \nincompetent to stand trial have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and in receiving \ncompetency restoration treatment. \n91.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n92.  Once an individual is found unable to aid and assist in their own defense, all \ncriminal  proceedings  must  stop,  thus  eliminating  punishment  as  a  lawful  purpose  for  their \nincarceration.  The only stated lawful purpose for their continued confinement is commitment to \nthe Defendantโs facility where they are to be provided restorative treatment so as to return him or \nher to competency. \n93.  County jails do not provide the restorative treatment required by state law. \n94.  No legitimate state interest justifies the continued incarceration of incompetent \ncriminal  defendants  in  county  jails  for  months  on  end.    The  nature  and  duration  of  their \nincarceration bear no reasonable relation to the restorative purpose for which the court has \ncommitted these individuals. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 27 of 31\n95.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of incompetent detainees \nare entitled to an order of the Court declaring that, by requiring persons found incompetent to stand \ntrial to remain in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to provide restorative treatment \nin a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due process \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n96.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members found incompetent to stand trial.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other Class members are therefore entitled to an order of the Court enjoining Defendant \nfrom further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation to their continued \nincarceration in jail while awaiting a bed at a DSHS mental health facility where they can receive \nthe state-mandated restorative treatment.   \nB.  Defendant Has Violated, and Continues to Violate Insanity Acquitteesโ Rights Under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n \n97.  The allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 96 above are incorporated \nherein. \n98.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits states from \ndepriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \n99.  Persons who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity, and thereby acquitted \nof criminal charges, have liberty interests in freedom from incarceration and in receiving court-\nordered evaluation and/or treatment services. \n100.  Due process requires that the nature and duration of confinement must bear a \nreasonable relation to the purpose for which an individual is confined. \n101.  Once an individual is found not guilty by reason of insanity, they have been \nacquitted of the offense charged and cannot remain incarcerated.  The only stated lawful purpose \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 28 of 31\nfor their continued confinement is commitment to a Department facility where they are to be \nprovided evaluation and treatment services for the personโs present mental condition, which will \nenable the court to reach final disposition. \n102.  County jails do not have the resources or expertise to provide the evaluation and/or \ntreatment services mandated by state law. \n103.  No legitimate state interest justifies the incarceration of insanity acquittees in \ncounty jails for months on end.  The nature and duration of their incarceration bear no reasonable \nrelation to the evaluation and/or treatment purpose for which the court has committed insanity \nacquittees. \n104.  The Class Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittes are \nentitled to  an order of  the Court declaring that, by requiring insanity  acquittees to  remain \nincarcerated in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to provide evaluation and/or \ntreatment in a reasonably timely manner, Defendant has violated the Fourteenth Amendment due \nprocess rights of the Plaintiffs and the other Class members. \n105.  Unless enjoined by the Court, Defendant will continue to violate the constitutional \nrights of the Plaintiffs and the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees.  The Plaintiffs \nand the other members of the Class of insanity acquittees are therefore entitled to an order of the \nCourt enjoining Defendant from further violations of the Plaintiffsโ rights to due process in relation \nto their continued confinement while awaiting evaluation and/or treatment at a DSHS mental \nhealth facility.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 29 of 31\nATTORNEYโS FEES \n106.  Plaintiffs are entitled to recover their attorneyโs fees, costs, and expenses pursuant \nto 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and 42 U.S.C. ยง 12205. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nTHEREFORE: Plaintiffs respectfully request this Court to: \nA.  Certify the Classes, as defined above; \nB.  Enter an Order declaring that, by requiring defendants found incompetent to stand \ntrial  to remain incarcerated in county jails for protracted periods, and by failing to \nprovide restorative treatment services for incompetent detainees, Defendant is \ndepriving Plaintiffs and Class Members of their due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nC.  Enter an Order declaring that, by requiring defendants found not guilty by reason \nof insanity to remain incarcerated in county jails for more than 14 days, absent a \ncriminal conviction or criminal charge, and by failing to provide evaluation and/or \ntreatment services for insanity acquittees, Defendant is depriving Plaintiffs and \nClass Members of their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution and in violation of state law; \nD.   Issue  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  restraining  Defendant  from \nviolating the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in relation \nto the confinement of individuals awaiting competency restoration treatment and \nthe confinement of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity and awaiting \nevaluation and/or treatment services; \nE.  Award Plaintiffs their reasonable attorneyโs fees and costs; and  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:16-cv-00917-DAE   Document 23   Filed 11/23/16   Page 30 of 31\nF.
