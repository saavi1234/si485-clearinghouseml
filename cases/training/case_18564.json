Plaintiffs are children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.  They \nappear through their adult next friends.  They ask the Court to order Defendants to \nactually provide them with Applied Behavior Analysis treatment for their autism \nspectrum disorder and to inform them that Applied Behavior Analysis is available.1  \n2.  Plaintiffs and their next friends bring this suit because Defendants do not provide \nApplied Behavioral Analysis as a Texas Medicaid benefit or inform anyone about it \nas a Medicaid benefit. 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396a(a)(43);  1396d(r). Through 42 \nU.S.C. Section 1983, Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare that Defendants violate their \nrights and to enjoin Defendants from depriving them of rights secured by the federal \nMedicaid Act.     \n                                                \n11 Plaintiffs’ Lead Counsel did not number the paragraphs when she filed the Original Complaint in this \ncase.  She apologizes for this mistake.  Plaintiffs file  this First Amended Complaint only to add  paragraph \nnumbering.  F.R.Civ. P. 10(b) (numbered paragraphs are required);  F.R.Civ.P 15(a)(1)(amending as a \n“matter of course”). \n1 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 2 of 17\n3.  According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, autism \nspectrum disorder  (ASD)  \nis a developmental disability that is caused by differences in how the brain \nfunctions. People with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn \nin different ways. Signs of ASD begin during early childhood and usually \nlast throughout a person’s life….  The term ‘spectrum’ in ASD means that \neach person can be affected in different ways, and symptoms can range \nfrom mild to severe. People with ASD share some similar symptoms, such \nas difficulties with social interaction, difficulties with communication, and \nhighly focused interests and/or repetitive activities. How the symptoms \naffect a person’s functioning depends on the severity and combination of \nthose symptoms. \n \nhttp://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/documents/comm-report-autism-what-is.pdf \n4.  The Texas Health and Human Services Commission told the Texas \nLegislature that Applied Behavior Analysis “is a treatment that uses \nbehavioral principles to evaluate and teach socially relevant behavior and new \nskills and decrease undesirable behaviors through positive reinforcement.  It is \nthe most recommended, evidence-based treatment” for autism spectrum \ndisorder.  available at https://hhs.texas.gov/sites/hhs/files/documents/about-\nhhs/communications-events/news/fy18-19-lar.pdf at 3.A at 450 (hereinafter, \nLAR 2018-19). \n5.  It is medically necessary for each Plaintiff to receive Applied Behavior Analysis \ntreatment.  \n6.  The indigent Plaintiffs and their families cannot afford to pay for Applied Behavior \nAnalysis treatment.  The medically necessary dosage is normally 20-40 hours/week of \ntreatment for several years.      \nJURISDICTION \n7.  This Court has jurisdiction over this suit. 28 U.S.C. Sections 1331, 1343.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 3 of 17\nVENUE \n8.  Venue is proper in this Court.  28 U.S.C. Section 1391(b)(2). \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiffs XW and KRW appear by their next friend, AW.  AW is the twin’s mother \nand next friend in this case.  They live together in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas \nwith their older brother.  The twins qualify for Medicaid in Texas.  XW’s Texas \nMedicaid ID number is  XXX- XX- 6563.  KRW’s Texas Medicaid ID number is \nXXX-XX-6562.   \n10. Plaintiff BA appears by his next friend, BC. BC is BA’s mother and next friend in \nthis case.  They live together in Bexar County, Texas with BA’s father, brother and \nsister.  Their father is a United States military veteran who served as a medic.  \nUnfortunately, he was disabled following a vehicle roll over caused by an improvised \nexplosive device (IED) while he was in the service.   BA qualifies for Medicaid in \nTexas.  His Medicaid ID number is XXX-XX-1211. \n11. Defendant Charles Smith is the Executive Commissioner of the Texas Health and \nHuman Services Commission.  The Texas Health and Human Services Commission is \nTexas’ “single state agency”, which administers the Texas Medicaid Program. 42 \nU.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(5).  Defendant Smith may be served with process at the \nTexas Health and Human Services Commission, Brown-Heatly Building, 4900 N. \nLamar Blvd., Austin, TX 78751-2316.  Plaintiff sues Defendant Smith in his official \ncapacity only, and seeks only injunctive relief, declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees.  \n12. Defendant Gary Jessee is the Texas Medicaid Director. He may be served with \nprocess at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, Brown-Heatly \n3 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 4 of 17\nBuilding, 4900 N. Lamar Blvd., Austin, TX 78751-2316.  Plaintiff sues Defendant \nJessee in his official capacity only, and seeks only injunctive relief, declaratory relief \nand attorneys’ fees.  \nFACTS \nPlaintiffs XW and KRW \n13. Plaintiffs XW and KRW are 5 year old twin brothers.  They were born prematurely in \nApril, 2011.  In May, 2016, both were found to have autism spectrum disorder during \nevaluations to determine if they qualify for special education services for children \nwith disabilities.  Further, psychologist Andrew Martinez, PhD, confirmed the \ndiagnosis in the fall of 2016.  \nXW \n14. XW’s mother describes him as a loving, funny, cute child. He shows interest in books \nand he likes to run and jump.  He is active and easily distracted. \n15. XW was born prematurely.  At birth, he only weighed about 3 pounds.  He has an oral \naversion;  even though he is already 5 years old, he does not eat any solid food.  XW  \nreceives all nutrition by drinking a nutritional supplement (Boost) from a bottle.  \nSensory disorders, such as oral aversion, are common among people with autism \nspectrum disorder. \n16. XW’s expressive and receptive speech are in the below average range. He can speak \nin 2 word phrases but he cannot yet speak in 3 word phrases.  He also babbles and \nrepeats phrases in a manner known as echolalia, which is common among people who \nhave autism spectrum disorder.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 5 of 17\n17. XW is not toilet trained.  He needs adult assistance to wash his hands.  He does not \ndress himself. \n18. Both the special education evaluation and Dr. Martinez’ evaluation show that XW has \nsevere autism spectrum disorder.   Both evaluations also show that his intellectual \ndevelopment is significantly below the norm for children of his age. \n19. It is medically necessary for XW to receive up to 40 hours of Applied Behavior \nAnalysis every week for several years.  \nKRW \n20.  KRW’s mother reports that he is also loving, funny, cute and generally happy. He \nlikes to play with toy cars. \n21. KRW was born seconds before XW.  At birth, he weighed about 6 pounds.   \n22. Like his twin, KRW is an active child and easily distracted.   \n23. When upset, KRW sometimes exhibits self-injurious behaviors, which is common \namong people with autism spectrum disorder.  For example, KRW exhibits  head \nbanging. He also slams himself into walls or doors. \n24. KRW is not toilet trained.  \n25. Although KRW’s speech is somewhat more developed than his brother’s, both his \nreceptive and expressive speech are in the below average range. \n26. The evaluations by the school and Dr. Martinez both show that KRW has mild to \nmoderate autism spectrum disorder.  His intellectual functioning is below the norm \nwhen compared to other children of his age.   \n27. It is medically necessary for KRW to receive up to 40 hours of Applied Behavior \nAnalysis for several years.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 6 of 17\n28. Plaintiffs XW and KRW started to receive very limited Applied Behavior Analysis \nservices in the summer of 2016.  They receive these limited services through \nDefendants’ focused Applied Behavior Analysis program, which is described in more \ndetail below.   The program does not meet their needs because it is limited to 30 \nhours/month and 6 months out of a year.  The twins need 30-40 hours/week of \nApplied Behavior Analysis, and they will need ongoing treatment for several years.   \n29. Defendants’ focused Applied Behavior Analysis services are not a Medicaid benefit. \nBA \n30. CB had suspected for a long time that her son, BA, had a medical problem that \nimpaired his social functioning.  But it was not until BA was in the third grade that a \ndoctor confirmed her suspicions.  At that time, a new pediatrician determined that \nsomething was wrong.   \n31. The new pediatrician, Syliva Leal, MD,  referred BA for an evaluation to find out if \nhe had autism spectrum disorder in late 2014.  It took until June 2016 for BA to be \nseen at the Multidisciplinary Autism Clinic at the Children’s Hospital of San Antonio.   \n32. Each member of the multidisciplinary team enjoyed working with BA.  They found \nBA to be “delightful and pleasant” and noted that his family is very supportive of \nhim.  \n33. The Clinic diagnosed BA with autism spectrum disorder.  Their intellectual \nfunctioning evaluation showed that BA does not have an intellectual disability \nalthough his intelligence is in the low-normal range.   \n34. Proper Applied Behavior Analysis treatment could enable BA to function \nindependently in school, in the community and at home. \n6 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 7 of 17\n35. The Clinic concluded that BA \nis smart and this bodes well for his prognosis.  We feel that ABA (applied \nbehavioral analysis) therapy would be very good for [BA] to focus on \nsocial skills and to improve his restricted, repetitive behaviors.  However, \nthis can be very difficult to get as Medicaid will not cover this.  However, \nif he is able to get it, he would greatly benefit, so we have given \ninformation on scholarships to cover this therapy.  \n \nPlaintiffs Requested Assistance \n36. XW and KRW requested Medicaid coverage of an adequate amount of Applied \nBehavior Analysis by letter to Defendants’ Chief Counsel on October 11, 2016.  BA \nalso asked the Chief Counsel to approve Applied Behavior Analysis by letter on \nOctober 28, 2016.   To date, the Chief Counsel’s Office has not responded. \nAutism Spectrum Disorder \n37. Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability evidenced by impairments in \nsocial relations and communication as well as restricted interests, repetitive \nbehaviors. Sensory disorders are also fairly common.  There is significant variation \namong people who are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in terms of the \nseverity of the condition and the symptoms displayed.  \n38. According to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the  \n“Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2015, \napproximately 1 in 68 children in the U.S.  had a diagnosis of autism \nspectrum disorder (ASD).  Based on these numbers, it is estimated that \nthere are more than 157, 780 […] children ages 3 through 15 with ASD in \nTexas in 2016.  The number is projected to increase, growing to \napproximately 159,449 in 2017.”   \n \nLAR 2018-2019 at 3.A. at  140.   The “increasing number of children diagnosed with \nautism has created a national health emergency in the United States.  Autism is more \n7 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 8 of 17\ncommon than childhood cancer, juvenile diabetes, and pediatric AIDS combined.”  Id. at \n450.  \n39. About 1 in 42 boys suffers from autism spectrum disorder;  about 1 in 189 girls \nreceive the diagnosis.   \n40. Some children with autism spectrum disorder also have intellectual disabilities but \nothers do not.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about \n44% of children with autism spectrum disorder have cognitive function that is \naverage or above average. \n41. The cause of autism spectrum disorder is not fully understood.  Genetics plays a role \nbut this role is not clear cut.  Other factors are important, including parents’ advanced \nage at conception and problems during pregnancy and delivery.  \n42. There is not yet a cure for autism spectrum disorder. \nApplied Behavior Analysis  \n43. Applied Behavior Analysis has been studied for several decades.  It is the gold \nstandard, evidence-based treatment for children with autism spectrum disorder.  \nAlthough Applied Behavior Analysis cannot cure autism spectrum disorder, it can \nalleviate symptoms – or help children to cope with symptoms - so that some children \nwith autism spectrum disorder go on to live normal, productive lives.   \n44. Applied Behavior Analysis is performed by Board Certified Behavior Analysts \n(BCBAs), who are certified by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board.  To sit for \nthe certification exam, applicants must graduate from an approved graduate program \nat an accredited university, complete sufficient graduate course work in behavior \nanalysis, and complete a supervised practicum.  BCBAs  are trained to evaluate the \n8 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 9 of 17\nstrengths and weaknesses of children with autism spectrum disorder.  Based on that \nevaluation, they develop, implement, evaluate and recalibrate Applied Behavior \nAnalysis treatment plans for children with autism spectrum disorder.  BCBAs also \nteach families to help children with autism spectrum disorder. \n45. Applied Behavior Analysis uses proven behavioral treatments to improve the ability \nof children with autism spectrum disorder to function in real life situations by \nreducing the frequency of problem behaviors and increasing the frequency of \nfunctional behaviors.  Applied Behavioral Analysis uses learning theory to intervene \nto alter behavior using frequent repetition of expectations, positive reinforcement of \ndesired behaviors, incremental change in small behaviors over time and recalibration \nof the treatment plan over time as behavior changes.   It includes daily documentation \nto show if interventions cause improvement so that if an intervention is not \nappropriate, it can be changed.  In short, “ABA is a treatment that uses behavioral \nprinciples to evaluate and teach socially relevant behavior and new skills and increase \ndesirable behaviors through positive reinforcement….  The team that develops the \nplan assesses progress and adjusts it to address the child’s needs and strengths.”  \nLAR2018-2019 at 3.A. at 450.  Since children with autism spectrum disorder vary a \nlot in their symptoms, Applied Behavior Analysis treatment plans are specific to the \nneeds of each child. \n46. Among children with autism, Applied Behavior Analysis has been shown to improve \nglobal function in the areas of communication, interpersonal relationships, learning, \nself-regulation, adaptability and lessening of maladaptive behaviors.  If children \nreceive good Applied Behavior Analysis for long enough, some can function \n9 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 10 of 17\nnormally without other support in school, at home and in the community. LAR 2018-\n2019 at 3.A. at 140.  Others will continue to need ongoing support. \n47. Children with autism spectrum disorder require about 20-40 hours/week of Applied \nBehavior Analysis, usually for several years.   This level and extent of service is \nnecessary to help children with autism spectrum disorder to develop and/or improve \nthe full range of life skills that they often lack. \n48. “Focused Applied Behavior Analysis” is another form of the treatment.  As implied \nby its name, this form of treatment focuses on one or a few interrelated harmful \nbehaviors.  While focused treatment can be helpful when used appropriately, it is not \nadequate to address the broad range of maladaptive behaviors found among children \nwith autism spectrum disorder. \n49. Although Defendants do not offer Applied Behavior Analysis at all as a Medicaid \nbenefit, they offer very limited focused Applied Behavior Analysis treatment to 3-15 \nyear olds with autism spectrum disorder through grants.  The program is, however, \nlimited.  It only provides up to 30 hours of services per month for no more than 6 \nmonths/year.  Some children with autism spectrum disorder regress after services \nend. \n50. The focused program is also limited because it serves only a very small number of \nTexas children with autism spectrum disorder.   Even according to the Defendants, \nApplied Behavior Analysis is “still not available in all areas of the state, and there \ncontinues to be significant need.”  LAR 2018-2019 at 3.A. at 140.  \n51. The numbers support Defendants’ conclusion that in Texas there is significant unmet \nneed for Applied Behavior Analysis treatment.  Defendants estimate that in FY2016, \n10 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 11 of 17\nthey will provide even their very limited focused services to only 657 children.  They \nhope to expand the service to help 1114 children in FY2018 and 2019.  LAR 2018-\n2019 at 3.A. at 138.   Since more than 150,000 Texas children have autism spectrum \ndisorder, Defendants’ limited program served less than 4% of children in need of \nApplied Behavior Analysis in 2016..  \n52. Defendants used to also offer more extensive Applied Behavior Analysis for children \nwith autism spectrum disorder, with 20-40 hours of treatment/week for more than a \nyear at a time. But, they phased out this more adequate comprehensive treatment \nprogram. “As of September 1, 2015, the program began only enrolling new children \nin Focused ABA treatment….”  LAR2018-2019 at 3.A. at 451.  \nTexas Medicaid Program \n53. Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program.  The federal government provides \nfunds to states to furnish health care services to indigent individuals.  If a state opts to \naccept federal Medicaid funding, it must comply with federal requirements, including \nthose set out in this Complaint.  \n54. State Medicaid programs must identify a “single state agency” to run its Medicaid \nprogram.  42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(5).  The Texas Health and Human Services \nCommission is Texas’ single state agency. \n55. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services is the federal Medicaid agency.  \n56. Defendants’ policy is that Applied Behavior Analysis is not a covered benefit of the \nTexas Medicaid Program.  Defendants do not inform anyone about Applied Behavior \nAnalysis as part of their Medicaid informing efforts. \n11 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 12 of 17\nCongress Intends That Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Receive Applied  \nBehavior Analysis Treatment  \n \n57. Medicaid assistance “means payment of part or all of the cost of the following care \nand services or the care and services themselves, or both….”  42 U.S.C. Section \n1396d(a)(emphasis added).   In other words, Congress intends that Medicaid \nrecipients like Plaintiffs are entitled to actually receive “care and services” as well as \npayment to their health care professionals for those services.   \nEarly, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT): \nA Mandatory Medicaid Service for Children \n \n58. Defendants must provide “early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment \nservices” for Medicaid recipients up through the age of 21 years.  42 U.S.C. Sections \n13969a(A)(43);  1396d(r)(“EPSDT”)(emphasis added).  As part of EPSDT, \nDefendants must provide “[s]uch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, \ntreatment, and other measures described in [42 U.S.C. Section 1396d(a)] to correct or \nameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the \nscreening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan.” 42 \nU.S.C. Section 1396d(r)(5) (emphasis added).  Applied Behavior Analysis is an \nEPSDT service because it is necessary health care to correct or ameliorate defects and \nillnesses and conditions.   \n59. Indeed,  on  July 14, 2014, CMS issued an Informational Bulletin entitled \nClarification of Medical Coverage of Services to Children with Autism.  It  \nreaffirmed that EPSDT is “intended to ensure a comprehensive, high-quality health \ncare benefit for eligible individuals under the age of 21, including for those with \n[autism spectrum disorder], based on individual determinations of medical \n12 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 13 of 17\nnecessity…. [For Medicaid recipients under the age of 21 years,],… the expectation \n[is] that EPSDT will meet the individual’s needs.” \n60. The EPSDT section of the Medicaid Act creates rights that can be vindicated via 42 \nU.S.C. Section 1983.   First, Congress clearly intended to confer rights on individuals \nunder the age of 21, like Plaintiffs;  the Medicaid Act requires Defendants to provide \nEPSDT services to “all persons in the State who are under the age of 21 and who \nhave been determined to be eligible for” Medicaid.  42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(43).  \n61. Further, the EPSDT section of the Act is neither vague nor amorphous.  Enforcement \nwould not strain the competence of this Court or any other Court.  Plaintiffs ask the \nCourt to determine that they are entitled to one specific treatment:  Applied Behavior \nAnalysis, which is a covered service included in the EPSDT benefit. Sections. \n1396a(a)(43); 1396d(r)(5).    \n62. Last, Congress requires Defendants to provide Applied Behavior Analysis for \nPlaintiffs.   For Medicaid recipients under the age of 21 years, Defendants “must … \nprovide … “  EPSDT services.  42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(43).  Further, Section \n1396a(a)(43)(A) states that the full scope of services is defined in Section 1396d(r), \nmentioned above.   Section 1396(d)(r)(5) requires Defendants to provide a broad \nrange of health care services to Medicaid recipients under the age of 21, including \nApplied Behavior Analysis. \nDefendants Must Make Medical Assistance “Available” \n63. Defendants “must … provide for making medical assistance available, including at \nleast the care and services listed in paragraphs (1) through (5), (17) and (21) of \nsection 1396d(a) of this title, to all individuals…”  who qualify for Medicaid.   42 \n13 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 14 of 17\nU.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i). Applied Behavior Analysis is covered in the \nEPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act.  EPSDT services are listed in the 4th  \nparagraph of Section 1396(d)(a).  The 4th  paragraph further refers to Section \n1396d(r), which defines the broad scope of services that Defendants must provide to \nPlaintiffs, including Applied Behavior Analysis.  \n64. Section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Medicaid Act creates rights that can be vindicated \nvia 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.  Congress clearly intended to confer rights on individuals \nwho qualify for Medicaid, such as Plaintiffs.  Indeed, Section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) \nstates that Defendants “must …  mak[e] … medical assistance available … to all \nindividuals who qualify for Medicaid.”   \n65. Further, it is well within the Courts’ competence to enforce Section \n1396a(a)(10)(A)(i).  As stated above, Plaintiffs seek to require Defendants to make \navailable to them only one treatment:  Applied Behavior Analysis. This is not vague \nor amorphous. \n66. Finally, Congress certainly requires Defendants to provide Applied Behavior \nAnalysis to Plaintiffs.  Section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i) is phrased in mandatory terms:  \nDefendants “must … provide for making medical assistance available…” including \nEPSDT services.  Section 1396a(a)(43);  1396d(r)(5). \nDefendants Must Inform Plaintiffs That Applied  \nBehavior Analysis Is A Covered Medicaid Benefit \n67. Defendants “must … provide for— informing all persons in the State who are under \nthe age of 21 and who have been determined to be eligible for medical assistance …, \nof the availability of early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services \nas described in section 1396d(r) of this title….”  42 U.S.C. Section 1396a(a)(43)(A).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 15 of 17\nDefendants have not informed anyone about Applied Behavior Analysis as a \nMedicaid benefit, as required by law. \n68. Section 1396a(a)(43)(A) of the Medicaid Act creates rights that can be vindicated via \n42 U.S.C. Section 1983.  Congress clearly intended to confer rights on children who \nqualify for Medicaid, such as Plaintiffs.  Indeed, Section 1396a(a)(43)(A) states that \nDefendants “must …  provide for informing all persons who are under the age of 21 \nand who have been determined eligible for Medicaid,” which includes Plaintiffs.   \n69. Further, it is well within the Courts’ competence to enforce Section 1396a(a)(43)(A).  \nPlaintiffs seek to require Defendants to inform them about only one thing:  Applied \nBehavior Analysis as a Medicaid benefit. This is not vague or amorphous. \n70. Finally, Congress certainly requires Defendants to inform Plaintiffs about Applied \nBehavior Analysis as a Medicaid benefit included within EPSDT.  Section \n1396a(a)(43)(A) is phrased in mandatory terms:  Defendants “must … provide for - \ninforming… …” about EPSDT services, including Applied Behavior Analysis.  \nSection 1396a(a)(43);  1396d(r)(5). \nREMEDIES SOUGHT \n71. Plaintiffs seek relief to require Defendants to 1) change their policy to cover Applied \nBehavior Analysis as a Medicaid benefit when medically necessary, 2) actually \nprovide Applied Behavior Analysis when medically necessary, as it is for the \nPlaintiffs in this case, and 3) inform Plaintiffs and others about Applied Behavior \nAnalysis as a covered benefit of the Medicaid program to assist them to actually \nreceive services that they need.   Further, Plaintiffs ask the Court to declare that \nDefendants violate their rights granted by the Medicaid Act.  They also ask the Court \n15 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 16 of 17\nto enjoin Defendants to actually provide Applied Behavior Analysis to them and to \ninform them about this Medicaid service. 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396a(a)(43);  1396d(r); \n42 U.S.C. Section 1983;  28 U.S.C. Sections 2201 and 2202; Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 57 and 65.   They also seek to recover attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses.  \n42 U.S.C. Section 1988; FRCivP 54(d).  \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n72. Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ right to EPSDT services by failing to provide  the \nApplied Behavior Analysis that they need,  in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sections \n1396a(a)(43) and 1396d(r)(5).  They may seek relief from the violation of their rights.  \n42 U.S.C. Section 1983. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n73. Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ right to have “available” Applied Behavior Analysis, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396a(a)(10);  1396a(a)(43); 1396d(r)(5).  Plaintiffs  \nmay seek relief from the violation of these rights.  42 U.S.C. Section 1983. \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n74. Defendants violate Plaintiffs’ right to information about Applied Behavior Analysis \nas a Medicaid benefit, in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sections 1396a(a)(43)(A). Plaintiffs \nmay seek relief from the violation of these rights.  42 U.S.C. Section 1983. \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs, through their next friends, seek the following relief: \na.  That the Court assert jurisdiction over this case and the Defendants; \nb.  That the Court require Defendants to be served and to respond; \nc.  That the Court permit reasonable discovery to Plaintiffs; \n16 \n \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 3   Filed 12/07/16   Page 17 of 17\nd.

In \nsupport, Plaintiffs would show: \nI.   INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs X.W., K.R.W. and B.A. are all young children who have been diagnosed with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD).  According to the United States Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, ASD  \nis  a  developmental  disability  that  is  caused  by  differences  in  how  the  brain \nfunctions. People with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn in \ndifferent  ways.  Signs  of  ASD  begin  during  early  childhood  and  usually  last \nthroughout a person’s life….  The term ‘spectrum’ in ASD means that each \nperson can be affected in different ways, and symptoms can range from mild to \nsevere. People with ASD share some similar symptoms, such as difficulties with \nsocial interaction, difficulties with communication, and highly focused interests \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 2 of 18\nand/or  repetitive  activities.  How  the  symptoms  affect  a  person’s  functioning \ndepends on the severity and combination of those symptoms.1 \n \nSee also, Martinez Affidavit at ¶ 4 (Exhibit A), Svoboda Declaration at ¶ 4 (Exhibit B). \n \nPlaintiffs have been assessed to have a medical need for Applied Behavior Analysis \n(ABA) to treat their ASD.  Martinez Affidavit at ¶¶ 7, 9.  Texas Medicaid acknowledges that \nABA is an essential treatment for children with ASD, having told the Texas Legislature that \nApplied Behavior Analysis “is a treatment that uses behavioral principles to evaluate and teach \nsocially relevant behavior and new skills and decrease desirable behaviors through positive \nreinforcement.  It is the most recommended, evidence-based treatment” for autism spectrum \ndisorder.2 (emphasis added). \nPlaintiffs  are  all  eligible  Medicaid  beneficiaries  who  are  entitled  to  all  medically \nnecessary services, including ABA, under the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and \nTreatment  (“EPSDT”)  program  for  Medicaid  beneficiaries  under  the  age  of  twenty-one.  \nExhibits, Affidavit of CB at ¶ 6 (BA) (Exhibit D); Affidavit of AW at ¶ 6 (XW and KRW) \n(Exhibit E).  Nevertheless, Texas Medicaid is refusing to cover or make available ABA for the \nPlaintiffs, despite their medical need for such preventative or rehabilitative therapy, in violation \nof Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5), and its implementing \nregulations. \nDefendant  Smith  is  the  Executive  Commissioner  of  the  Texas  Health  and  Human \nServices  Commission,  which  is  designated  as  the  “single  state  agency”  responsible  for \nadministering the state’s Medicaid program.  Defendant Jessee is the Texas Medicaid Director \n(Defendants will be referred to collectively as “Texas Medicaid”).   \n                                                 \n1 Available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/documents/comm-report-autism-what-is.pdf  \n2  Available  at  https://hhs.texas.gov/sites/hhs/files/documents/about-hhs/communications-events/news/fy18-19-\nlar.pdf at page 140 of 491.  (Attached hereto as Exhibit C) \n  2 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 3 of 18\nPlaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief from this Court because their conditions will \ndeteriorate or regress, and they will suffer irreparable harm, if they do not promptly receive the \ncomprehensive  ABA  services  that  they  have  been  prescribed.    Because  early  behavioral \nintervention and treatment  is  critical  for children with  ASD, it is  imperative that ABA be \nprovided as soon as possible.      \nThe legal issue presented by Plaintiffs in the underlying case is straight forward: can \nTexas Medicaid categorically exclude coverage of ABA, fail to provide these children with \nABA, and fail to inform them of ABA as a Medicaid service, even though ABA is medically \nnecessary to treat children with ASD?  As shown below, Plaintiffs can establish a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, that they face a threat of irreparable injury to their health if \nthe  requested  injunction  is  not  granted,  that  their  threatened  injuries  easily  outweigh  any \nthreatened harm to Defendants if the injunction is granted, and that the grant of medical care will \nnot disserve the public interest.   \nPlaintiffs have tried to avoid the need for the Court’s early action in this case.  Plaintiffs’ \nlead counsel wrote to the Chief Counsel for the Medicaid Program in October to request ABA \nfor each of the Plaintiffs.  She got no response.  She wrote again on December 6, 2016, to \nforward to the Chief Counsel a copy of the complaint in this case and to again request initiation \nof ABA for the Plaintiffs.  She asked for a response by Monday, December 12, 2016.  Exhibit F.  \nDefendants’ attorney, Sean Flammer, wrote to Plaintiffs’ counsel on December 12, 2016.  He did \nnot agree that the Medicaid Program would provide the ABA that the Plaintiffs need while this \n  3 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 4 of 18\ncase is pending.3  Moreover, this morning before filing this Motion, Plaintiffs’ lead counsel \ncalled Mr. Flammer, who advised that Defendants oppose this motion. \nBecause Defendants are continuing to refuse to provide Plaintiffs with the ABA they \nmedically need, Plaintiffs urge this Court to grant this motion for preliminary injunctive relief. \nII.   STATEMENT OF FACTS \nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):  According to Melisssa Svoboda, MD, “[a]utism spectrum \ndisorder (ASD) is first and foremost difficulty with social skills…. In order to have ASD, you \nhave to have a significant deficit in social skills and communication, above and beyond what \nwould be expected for your intelligence level.”  Svoboda Declaration, ¶ 4.4   \nAndrew  Martinez,  PhD  continued,  “ASD  is  …  characterized  by  deficits  in  social \ncommunication and interaction and a pattern of restricted and repetitive behaviors.”  Martinez \nAffidavit at ¶ 4.5  It includes “difficulty with nonverbal communication and understanding the \n‘back and forth’ of social interactions.”  Id.  People with ASD “struggle to develop, maintain, \nand establish social relationships.  They often exhibit stereotyped or repetitive movements or \nvocalizations  (e.g.,  hand  flapping,  echolalia).”  Id.    Other  symptoms  may  include  trouble \nadjusting to changes in routine or environment, restricted interests and increased or lessened \nsensitivity to sensory input.    Martinez Affidavit at ¶ 4.  \nPeople with autism spectrum disorder “vary based on severity levels.  Severity is based \non a 1-3 scale”;  Level 1 means mild symptoms (noticeable symptoms “cause some difficulties”), \n                                                 \n3 Defendants argue that Plaintiffs should have requested prior authorization of the ABA that they need.  This would \nhave been a futile act, however, because Defendants do not provide ABA.  There is “no there there” to be the subject \nof a prior approval request. \n4 Dr. Svoboda is a pediatric neurologist who specializes in neurodevelopment.  She is the medical director of the \nComprehensive Autism Program at The Children’s Hospital of San Antonio.  She is also a member of the faculty of \nBaylor College of Medicine’s Pediatrics Department in San Antonio. Svoboda Declaration, ¶ 2.  \n5 Dr. Martinez is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine in San Antonio.  He is the co-\nfounder and co-director of the Autism Clinic at The Children’s Hospital of San Antonio, where he also provides \nclinical psychology services.  Martinez Affidavit, ¶¶ 2-3. \n  4 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 5 of 18\nLevel 2 means moderate symptoms (obviously noticeable symptoms “interfere a great deal with \nfunctioning  across  settings”)  and  Level  3  means  severe  symptoms  (“severe  impairment  in \nfunctioning”).  Martinez Affidavit, ¶ 4. \nPlaintiffs Have Been Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder:  Plaintiffs have all been \ndiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, as follows: \n“BA’s diagnoses are: \ni.  Autism Spectrum Disorder \n1.  Social Communication – Level 1:  requiring support \n2.  Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors – Level 3:  Requiring very substantial support \nXW’s diagnoses are: \ni.  Autism Spectrum Disorder \n1.  Social Communication -  Level 3:  Requiring very substantial support \n2.  Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors – Level 3:  Requiring very substantial support \nKRW’s diagnoses are: \n1.  Autism Spectrum Disorder \n1.  Social Communication – Level 2:  Requiring substantial support \n2.  Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors – Level 2:  requiring substantial support” \nMartinez Affidavit at ¶ 7.  \nApplied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Treatment Is Medically Necessary for Children with \nAutism Spectrum Disorder.  “There is no cure for ASD, but there are some very good therapies \nand treatments that can make a profound improvement.”  Svoboda Declaration, ¶ 4.  As the \nDefendants have explained to the Texas Legislature, ABA “is a treatment that uses behavioral \nprinciples  to  evaluate  and  teach  socially  relevant  behavior  and  new  skills  and  decrease \n  5 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 6 of 18\nundesirable behaviors through positive reinforcement.  It is the most recommended, evidence-\nbased treatment” for ASD.  (Emphasis added.)  Exhibit C. \nAccording to Dr. Svoboda, “[b]ecause of how much improvement we see when ABA is \ngiven to those with ASD, the [American Academy of Pediatrics] deems it medically necessary \nfor children with ASD.”  Svoboda Declaration, ¶ 7, see also, Id.,¶ 5-7.  Dr. Svoboda continued,  \nABA (applied behavioral analysis) therapy is the best current treatment for those \nwith ASD. It involves a highly trained therapist tailoring a behavior training \nprogram  based  upon  that  child’s  challenges.  It  focuses  on  improving \ncommunication and adaptive skills (skills needed for day-to-day life like using the \nbathroom, eating, etc.). Because ASD is a spectrum, the therapist must be trained \nin many different approaches and understand how to craft a program for that \nparticular child. The therapists must have at least a master’s degree, some have \nPhDs….  Not only is it wonderful to have a therapy that is not a medication, but it \nis evidenced-based (meaning that it has actually been proven to work!). Multiple, \nhigh-quality studies have looked at ABA in ASD children and have seen dramatic \nimprovements in IQ, language, and adaptive skills. As physicians, we try our best \nto only recommend things that are evidence-based because we want to be sure \nthat if a family and child are subjected to something, that it actually works. \n \nSvoboda Declaration, ¶ 4; see also, Martinez Affidavit at ¶ 8 (ABA is the “preferred, evidence \nbased treatment” for ASD). \nAfter  extensive  review  and  research,  the  “American  Academy  of  Pediatrics \nrecommend[ed] intensive, comprehensive ABA therapy for every child with an ASD diagnosis.”  \nSvoboda Declaration, ¶ 5.  Indeed, children with ASD need about 20-40 hours of ABA each \nweek for many years.  Id., ¶ 7.  This is because “it takes a long time to change a behavior.”  Id., ¶ \n4.  Dr. Svoboda concludes that ABA “can truly change a family and the person with ASD. In my \nopinion, it is as vital a therapy as insulin is to diabetes.”  Svoboda Declaration, ¶ 8.  \nPrompt initiation of treatment is also important.  Comprehensive treatment, including \nABA,  should  begin  within  60  days  of  diagnosis  “because  evidence  shows  that  the  earlier \ntreatment leads to better outcomes later on.”  Id.  Dr. Martinez added research “has shown that \n  6 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 7 of 18\nintensive, early intervention increases the chances of long-term success.  Withholding ABA can \nbe detrimental to … long term success.”  Martinez Affidavit, ¶ 10.  Indeed, ‘[a]ll three Plaintiffs \nneed ABA as soon as possible,” as explained in more detail below.  Id.  \nIII.   PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show: (1) a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, \n(3) that the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs the threatened harm that will \nresult if the injunction is granted, and (4) that the grant of the preliminary injunction will not \ndisserve the public interest.  Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 837 F.3d 477, 488 (5th \nCir. 2016).  “A preliminary injunction aims to ‘prevent irreparable injury so as to preserve … [a] \ncourt’s ability to render a meaningful decision on the merits.’”  Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, \nInc. v. Kliebert, 141 F.Supp.3d 604, 635, quoting Anderson v. Jackson, 556 F.3d 351, 360 (5th \nCir. 2009).  “Preliminary injunctive relief may be necessary to insure that a remedy may be \navailable” at some future date.  United States v. Alabama, 791 F2d 1450, 1460 (11th Cir. 1986).  \nA.  Plaintiffs have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits  \n1.  Plaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce the EPSDT provisions of \nthe Medicaid Act under § 1983 \n \nIt is well settled that Plaintiffs can enforce their rights under the EPSDT provisions of the \nMedicaid Act through § 1983.  In S.D. v. Hood, 391 F3d. 581, 603-604 (2004), the Fifth Circuit \nconsidered this precise issue, and held that the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act are \nenforceable in an action brought under § 1983 (the EPSDT provisions require that “health care \nand services must be provided to all eligible recipients under the age of twenty-one” and have \n“precisely the sort of ‘rights-creating’ language identified in Gonzaga.”).  All federal circuit \ncourts of appeal to have ruled on this issue have held the same, that the EPSDT provisions create \n  7 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 8 of 18\nprivate rights that are enforceable under § 1983.  See Westside Mothers v. Haveman, 454 F.3d \n532 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding EPSDT plaintiffs could enforce § 1396a(a)(A)(10)(A) through § \n1983), same case, 289 F.3d 852, 863-64 (6th Cir. 2002) (allowing EPSDT beneficiaries to \nenforce § 1396a(a)(43)); Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas Dep’t of Human Servs., 293 \nF.3d 472, 477-79 (8th Cir. 2002) (allowing enforcement of the EPSDT provisions), same case, \n443 F.3d 1005, 1008 (8th Cir. 2006) (noting that children have enforceable rights to EPSDT), \nvacated on other grounds sub nom. Selig v. Pediatric Specialty Care, 551 U.S. 1142 (2007).   \n2.  Likelihood of Success \nWith Plaintiffs having a private right of action to bring this § 1983 action to enforce their \nfederal rights under the Medicaid Act, the next question for the Court is whether Plaintiffs have a \nsubstantial likelihood of success of the merits.  Because the EPSDT provisions and relevant case \nlaw support Plaintiffs’ claims, they have substantial likelihood of success on the merits. \ni.  Statutory background \nMedicaid is a medical assistance program that was established in 1965 by Title XIX of \nthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v (“the Medicaid Act”).  Cooperatively funded \nby the federal  and state governments,  Medicaid  provides health care  coverage to  specified \ncategories  of  low-income  individuals  meeting  certain  criteria.    See  id.    Texas  elected  to \nparticipate in the Medicaid program in 1967.  \nState participation in Medicaid is voluntary, but once a state agrees to participate in the \nprogram, it must administer a state plan that meets federal requirements.  Frew v. Hawkins, 540 \nU.S. 431 433 (2004).  One requirement is that the state “must have an Early and Periodic \nScreening,  Diagnosis,  and  Treatment  (EPSDT)  program.”    Id.  at  433  (citing  to  42  U.S.C. \n1396a(a)(43), 1396d(r)).  As the Supreme Court explained, “EPSDT programs provide health \n  8 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 9 of 18\ncare services to children to reduce lifelong vulnerability to illness or disease.  The EPSDT \nprovisions  of  the  Medicaid  statute  require  participating  States  to  provide  various  medical \nservices to eligible children, and to provide notice of the services.”  Id. at 433-434.     \nThe Fifth Circuit described EPSDT as “a comprehensive child health program designed \nto assure the availability and accessibility of health care resources for the treatment, correction \nand amelioration of the unhealthful conditions of individual Medicaid recipients under the age of \ntwenty-one.”  S.D. v. Hood, 391 F.3d at 586 (citing CMS State Medicaid Manual § 5010.B).  \n“The natural reading of § 1396d(r)(5)’s phrases is that all of the health care, services, treatments, \nand other measures described by § 1396d(a) must be provided by the state Medicaid agencies \nwhen  necessary  to  correct  or  ameliorate  unhealthful  conditions  discovered  by  screening, \nregardless of whether they are covered by the state plan.”  Id. at 589.   \n“Accordingly, every Circuit which has examined the scope of the EPSDT program has \nrecognized that states must cover every type of health care or service necessary for EPSDT \ncorrective or ameliorative purposes that is allowable under § 1396d(a).”6  Id. (citing Collins v. \nHamilton, 349 F.3d 371, 376 n.8 (7th Cir. 2003) (a state’s discretion to exclude services deemed \n‘medically necessary’ . . . has been circumscribed by the express mandate of the statute”)); \nPittman by Pope v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Health & Rehab., 998 F.2d 887, 892 (11th Cir. 1993) \n(1989  amendment  adding  §  1396d(r)(5)  took  away  any  discretion  state  might  have  had  to \nexclude  organ  transplants  from  the  treatment  available  to  individuals  under  twenty-one); \n                                                 \n6 Even prior to the 1989 amendment of the Act, which clarified that states must provide all mandatory and optional \nservices to EPSDT beneficiaries, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that the Medicaid Act mandates \nTexas Medicaid to affirmatively and aggressively remedy the health problems of Texas children participating in the \nMedicaid program.  Mitchell v. Johnson, 701 F.2d 337, 347-348 (5th Cir. 1983) (citing Stanton v. Bond, 504 F.2d. \n1246, 1250 (7th Cir. 1974)); see also, Introduction to the Final Regulation Guidelines for the EPSDT Program, \nissued June 28, 1972 as part of the Medical Assistance Manual, Part 5, Sections 5-70-00, et seq. (through the \nEPSDT program “Congress intended to require states to take aggressive steps to screen, diagnose and treat children \nwith health problems”).  The Mitchell court found that Texas Medicaid, through its reduction and termination of \ncertain dental services for children, had “ignored the preventive and restorative purposes of the EPSDT legislation” \nand “unduly frustrated” these purposes.  Mitchell, 701 F.2d at 348-351.   \n  9 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 10 of 18\nPediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v.

Hood, 391 F.3d at 590. \n  10 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 11 of 18\nii.  ABA is covered as part of the EPSDT benefit \nAs for whether ABA must be covered as part of the EPSDT benefit, all decisions found \nby the undersigned counsel agree that ABA is a covered benefit.  For example, the court in \nGarrido v. Dudek reasoned that to determine “if [Florida Medicaid’s] decision not to cover ABA \nfor children with autism and ASD violates the EPSDT provisions in the Medicaid Act, [the] \nstatutory framework presents two questions: (1) is ABA among those services which can be \ncovered under 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a), and (2) is ABA necessary to correct or ameliorate an illness \nfor a Medicaid recipient under age 21?” Garrido v. Dudek, 864 F.Supp.2d 1314, 1318 (S.D. Fla. \n2012), aff’d 731 F.3d 981 (11th Cir. 2013), on remand F.Supp.2d 1275, 1280 (S.D. Fla. 2013) \n(permanent injunction).  The Garrido court answered both questions in the affirmative, finding \nthat ABA falls within the scope of 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) (as a preventative or rehabilitative \nservice) and that ABA is “an effective and significant treatment to prevent disability and restore \ndevelopmental skills to children with autism and ASD.”  Id. at 1280, 1287.  Similarly, the court \nin Chisholm ex rel. CC v. Kliebert, 2013 WL 3807990, at *22 (E.D. La. July 18, 2013), found \nthat “ABA therapy, when recommended by a physician or licensed psychologist, constitutes \n‘medical  assistance’  under  Section  1396d(a)(13)  .  .  .”  and  that  “ABA  therapy  is  medical \nassistance that was necessary to correct or ameliorate the debilitating effects of [the plaintiffs’] \nautism.”  See also Parents League for Effective Autism Treatment v. Jones-Kelly, 339 Fed. App’x \n542 (6th Cir. 2009) (affirming preliminary injunction holding that ABA was likely mandated in \nOhio EPSDT as either a rehabilitative or preventative service); Hummel v. Ohio Dep’t of Job & \nFamily Servs., 844 N.E.2d 360 (Ohio App. 6th 2005) (ABA must be covered by Medicaid when \nmedically necessary).  \n  11 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 12 of 18\nIn August 2016, a federal district court in Hawaii concluded that Hawaii Medicaid had \ndelayed in covering ABA, “despite the Medicaid Act’s early and periodic screening, diagnostic \nand treatment  (EPSDT) mandate, 42 U.S.C. § 1396  et seq.,  and despite recognizing ABA \ntreatment’s effectiveness and qualification for Medicaid coverage.”  J.E., et al. v. Wong, Case \nNo. 1:14-cv-00399-HG-KJM, at 45 (Dist. of HA, August 12, 2016).  The court also held that \nHawaii  Medicaid  “did  not  fulfill  the  Medicaid  Act’s  requirement  that  eligible  persons  be \ninformed effectively of EPSDT services.”  Id. \nBecause ABA falls within the scope of 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) as a preventative or \nrehabilitative service and is  an effective and significant  treatment  to  prevent  disability  and \nrestore developmental skills to children with autism and ASD, Texas Medicaid simply lacks the \ndiscretion to deny coverage of ABA to Medicaid beneficiaries under the age of 21 who have a \nmedical need for such therapy.  As such, Plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the \nmerits of their Medicaid Act claims.   \nB.  Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if they continue to be denied their medically \nnecessary treatment \n \nBecause Plaintiffs are being denied medically necessary treatment for their significant \ndisabilities, they easily satisfy the “irreparable harm” element.  In Planned Parenthood, the Fifth \nCircuit held that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm even if they were only unable to \nreceive medical care from the Medicaid provider of their choice.  Planned Parenthood, 837 F.3d \nat 500-501.  Here, Plaintiffs are being entirely denied medically necessary services, not simply \nfrom the medical provider of their choice.  Because Plaintiffs are being denied access to needed \nmedical care, they will suffer irreparable harm absent entry of a preliminary injunction.  In M.R. \nv. Dreyfus, the Ninth Circuit reiterated that “[w]e have several times held that beneficiaries of \npublic assistance may demonstrate a risk of irreparable injury by showing that enforcement of a \n  12 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 13 of 18\nproposed rule ‘may deny them needed medical care.’”  M.R. v. Dreyfus, 697 F.3d 706, 732 (9th \nCir. 2011) (quoting Independent Living Ctr. of S. Cal. v. Maxwell-Jolly, 572 F.3d. 644, 658 (9th \nCir. 2009).  See also V.L. v. Wagner, 669 F. Supp. 2d 1106, 1121 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (“[n]umerous \nfederal  courts have recognized that  the reduction or elimination of public  medical benefits \nirreparably harms the participants in the programs being cut.); Beltran v. Myers, 677 F.2d 1317, \n1322 (9th Cir.1982) (holding that possibility that plaintiffs would be denied Medicaid benefits \nsufficient to establish irreparable harm); Newton–Nations v. Rogers, 316 F.Supp.2d 883, 888 (D. \nAriz. 2004) (citing Beltran and finding irreparable harm shown where Medicaid recipients could \nbe denied medical care as a result of their inability to pay increased co-payment to medical \nservice providers); Edmonds v. Levine, 417 F.Supp.2d 1323, 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2006) (finding that \nstate Medicaid agency's denial of coverage for off-label use of prescription pain medication \nwould  irreparably  harm  plaintiffs);  Cota  v.  Maxwell–Jolly,  688  F.  Supp.  2d  980,  997 \n(N.D.Cal.2010)  (“[T]he  reduction  or  elimination  of  public  medical  benefits  is  sufficient  to \nestablish irreparable harm to those likely to be affected by the program cuts.”). \nIn issuing its permanent injunction, the court in Garrido recognized that it was imperative \nthat children with ASD in Florida “receive ABA immediately to prevent irreversible harm to \nthese children’s health and development.”  Garrido, 864 F. Supp. 2d at 1327.  The court in \nChisholm similarly found that ABA “must be provided early to achieve . . . maximum effect ….”  \nChisholm, 3013 WL 3807990 at *24.  The same is true here.  As explained in the attached \naffidavits and declarations, the Plaintiffs have an immediate medical need for comprehensive \nABA  to  prevent  irreparable  harm.    For  example,  Dr.  Martinez  describes  the  reasons  that \nPlaintiffs need ABA in his Paragraph 9.  In Paragraph 10, he continued that,  \nAll 3 Plaintiffs need ABA as soon as possible.  Research has shown that intensive, \nearly intervention increases the chances of long-term success.  Withholding ABA \n  13 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 14 of 18\ncan be detrimental to their long-term success.  Moreover, in BA’s case, his social \nfunctioning  is  declining  due  to  social  deficits  and  restrictive  and  repetitive \nbehaviors.    Without  ABA,  if  this  trajectory  continues,  his  social  skills  may \ncontinue to decline.  In KRW’s case, his self-injurious behaviors need to be \naddressed before he begins seriously hurting himself or others.  If we do not \ndecrease these behaviors, the older and bigger he gets, the greater the likelihood \nhe can hurt himself or others.  In XW’s case, he has severe deficits that warrant \nimmediate treatment. \n \nC.  In balancing the equities, the balance easily weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor \n \nIn  a  balance  of  the  harms,  the  outcome  weighs  unquestionably  in  Plaintiffs’  favor.  \nPlaintiffs XW, KR.W, and BA will continue to suffer harm from the deprivation of medically \nnecessary services that are essential to their health.  Even delayed initiation of ABA treatment \nwill  harm  them  because  “individuals  with  ASD  should  receive  comprehensive  intervention \n(including intensive ABA) within 60 days of identifying that they have the diagnosis. This is \nbecause evidence shows that the earlier treatment leads to better outcomes later on.”  Svoboda \nDeclaration at ¶ 6.  Dr. Martinez agrees; “[a]ll 3 Plaintiffs need ABA as soon as possible…. \n[I]ntensive, early intervention increases the chances of long-term success.”  Martinez Affidavit at \n¶ 10.  For each child, harm will ensue if treatment is delayed: \n  BA’s social skills will continue to decline even more than they already have. \nKRW’s self-injurious behavior will worsen.  If allowed to continue unabated as \nhe ages and grows, he will become big enough to seriously hurt himself or others. \n \nXW’s severe deficits “warrant immediate treatment.” \nId.  Plaintiffs have filed this action simply to compel Defendants to comply with controlling \nfederal law.  As the Fifth Circuit recognized in Planned Parenthood, a state agency “simply does \nnot have a legitimate interest in administering the state’s Medicaid program in a way that \nviolates federal law.”  Planned Parenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. v. Gee, 837 F.3d at 501.  The \nCourt continued that “there is a robust public interest in safeguarding access to healthcare for \n  14 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 15 of 18\nthose eligible for Medicaid, whom Congress has recognized as ‘the most needy in the country.’”  \nId., again quoting Maxwell-Jolly, 572 F.3d at 659 (quoting Schweiker v. Hogan, 457 U.S. 569, \n590 (1982)). As the noted by the Court in Planned Parenthood, the Fourth Circuit reached a \nsimilar conclusion: “the public interest lies with safeguarding public health rather than assuaging \nNorth Carolina’s budget woes.”  Pashby v. Delia, 709 F.3d 307, 331 (4th Cir. 2013). \nD.  It is in the public interest to safeguard access to healthcare for those eligible for \nMedicaid \n \nThe issuance of a preliminary junction will simply ensure that these young Plaintiffs will \nnot be denied medically necessary services pending this litigation.  It is in the public interest for \nDefendants to comply with federal law, i.e., the Medicaid Act.  Further, as explained by the Fifth \nCircuit in Planned Parenthood, “the public interest weighs in favor of preliminarily enforcing \nthe Individual Plaintiffs’ rights and allowing some of the state’s neediest individuals to continue \nreceiving medical care ….”  837 F.3d at 502.  The Court concluded that: “We emphasize that \n‘there is a legitimate public interest in safeguarding access to health care for those eligible for \nMedicaid.’” Id. (quoting Maxwell-Jolly, 572 F.3d at 659).  Because Plaintiffs seek to enforce \ntheir rights under the Medicaid Act, and receive medically necessary ABA, it is in the public \ninterest to issue preliminary injunctive relief.  As Dr. Martinez stated, “[i]t is in the public \ninterest for these 3 plaintiffs to receive ABA therapy.  There is research highlighting that ABA \ntherapy can decrease the amount of funding needed to care for these children long-term.  Some \nchildren who receive ABA may not require as much government funding in the future (medical \nand/or educational).”  Martinez Affidavit, ¶ 11; see also Dr. Svoboda Declaration, ¶ 7 (early \nintensive ABA can help avoid costly special education services, and improve the life of the child \nand the family).  Dr. Svoboda concluded that ABA “can truly change a family and the person \nwith ASD.  In my opinion, it is as vital a therapy as insulin is to diabetes.”  Id., ¶ 9.        \n  15 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 16 of 18\nE.  The Court should waive the bond for these indigent, disabled Plaintiffs    \nPlaintiffs, indigent children, request that they not be required to post any cash bond, and \nthe Court has the discretion to issue a preliminary injunction without requiring the Plaintiffs to \ngive security.  See Corrigan Dispatch Co. v. Casa Guzman, S.A., 569 F.2d 300, 302-303 (5th Cir. \n1978) (The amount of bond “is a matter of discretion of the trial court; it may elect to require no \nsecurity at all.”) (cited approvingly in Gordon v. City of Houston, Texas, 2015 WL 138115 at \n*16 (S.D. Tex. January 9, 2015).  \nCourts have used their discretion to waive the bond requirement for indigent plaintiffs.  \nSee e.g., Bass v. Richardson, 338 F. Supp. 478, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (“It’s clear to us that \nindigents, suing individually or as class plaintiffs, ordinarily should not be required to post a \nbond under Rule 65(c)”); Denny v. Health and Soc. Servs. Bd. of the State of Washington, 285 F. \nSupp. 526, 527 (E.D. Wis. 1968) (“Poor persons . . . are by hypothesis unable to furnish security \nas contemplated by Rule 65(c), and the court should order no security in connection with this \npreliminary injunction.”). \nBecause  Plaintiff  children  in  this  case  are  indigent  and  disabled,  and  seek  only \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to vindicate their rights under the Medicaid Act, this Court \nshould not require Plaintiffs to give security. \nV.   CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should preliminary enjoin Defendant from \ncontinuing to deny Plaintiffs medically necessary ABA treatment. \n   \n  16 \n\nCase 5:16-cv-01235-OLG   Document 10   Filed 12/13/16   Page 17 of 18\nRespectfully submitted, \n \n                 /s/ Peter Hofer         \n      PETER HOFER \n      State Bar No. 09777275 \n  DISABILITY RIGHTS TEXAS \n  2222 West Braker Lane \n  Austin, Texas 78758 \n  (512) 454-4816 (Phone) \n  (512) 454-3999 (Fax) \n  phofer@drtx.org \n \n              SUSAN F.
