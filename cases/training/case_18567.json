The records concern the \ndeath of J. C., an individual with developmental disabilities.  The dLCV is entitled to the requested \nrecords by law, which are necessary to complete its review of the individual’s death and the \nefficacy of DePaul’s internal investigation.  \n1.  By way of background, there are three federal statutes requiring states to establish \nprotection and advocacy (P&A) systems to protect persons with disabilities and advocate on their \nbehalf. Those statutes are the Developmental Disabilities and Bill of Rights Act (“DD Act”), the \nProtection and Advocacy  for Mentally  Ill  Individuals Act  of 1986 (“PAIMI Act”), and the \nProtection and Advocacy of Individual Rights Act (“PAIR Act”). DD Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 15001–\n1 \n \n\nCase 7:19-cv-00349-MFU   Document 1   Filed 05/03/19   Page 2 of 8   Pageid#: 2\n \n115 (2006); PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801–851 (2006); PAIR  Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e (2006). To \nreceive federal funding under the PAIMI, PADD and PAIR Acts, states must have a P&A system.  \nPARTIES \n2.  The dLCV is a private, non-profit organization that is the Commonwealth of \nVirginia’s designated P&A system for persons with disabilities. Va. Code § 51.5-39.13. \n3.  The Defendant, DePaul Community Resources (“DePaul”), is located in Roanoke, \nVirginia, and is a provider of services to individuals with disabilities. The Defendant is subject to \nthe record production provisions of the P&A statutes cited above. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  Jurisdiction is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, since the Plaintiff’s \nfederal claim is established by the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15001 et seq. \n5.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1). DePaul Community \nResources maintains its principle place of business at 5650 Hollins Road, Roanoke, VA 24019. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n6.  As noted above, through the DD Act, Congress established the P&A system to \nmonitor and investigate incidents of abuse and neglect and to pursue legal, administrative, and \nother appropriate remedies to safeguard the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities. \nCongress extended the protection and advocacy mandate to cover individuals with mental illness \nwith the enactment of the PAIMI Act in 1986. The scope of the P&A system was further expanded \nin 1993 when the PAIR Act was enacted.  \n7.  The  dLCV  requested  information  from  DePaul  Community  Resources  to \ninvestigate the particular matter of J.C.’s death and for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating \nthe quality of provider investigations into deaths of service recipients. \n2 \n \n\nCase 7:19-cv-00349-MFU   Document 1   Filed 05/03/19   Page 3 of 8   Pageid#: 3\n \n8.  DePaul is a provider of services for individuals with developmental disabilities.  \nDePaul is licensed by the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services \n(“DBHDS”) to provide: Residential/Crisis Stabilization Service; Day Support Service; Supportive \nServices; Intensive In-Home Services, Outpatient Service, Sponsored Residential Home Service, \nRespite Services, and In-Home Respite Services. \n9.  As a condition of licensure, providers of licensed services are required to comply \nwith the Rules and Regulations for Licensing Providers by the DBHDS. Effective September 9, \n2018, all providers of licensed services are required to conduct a root cause analysis within “30 \ndays of discovery of Level II and Level III serious incidents. The root cause analysis shall include \nat least the following information: (i) a detailed description of what happened; (ii) an analysis of \nwhy it happened, including identification of all identifiable underlying causes of the incident that \nwere under the control of the provider; and (iii) identified solutions to mitigate its reoccurrence.” \nSee 12VAC35-105-160. A “serious incident” is “any event or circumstance that causes or could \ncause harm to the health, safety, or well-being of an individual.” Any serious incident which results \nin the death of an individual is a Level III serious incident. \n10.  The dLCV sent its first request for relevant reports on December 13, 2018, and \nreceived partial documentation from DePaul on December 19, 2018.   \n11.  The dLCV contacted DePaul counsel by phone conference on December 20, 2019, \nto discuss the request. Staff on the call agreed to refer the matter to dLCV’s managing attorney in \nan effort to negotiate the disclosure of the internal investigation report. \n12.  On  December  20,  2018,  dLCV  staff  and  Director  for  Legal  Services  Clyde \nMathews  conducted  a  telephone  conference  with  DePaul  counsel.  In  that  conference  and \nsubsequent email communications, the parties negotiated in good faith.   \n3 \n \n\nCase 7:19-cv-00349-MFU   Document 1   Filed 05/03/19   Page 4 of 8   Pageid#: 4\n \n13.  On January 10, 2019, DePaul counsel indicated its preference that the dLCV rely \nupon the already disclosed information to carry out its protection and advocacy function.  DePaul \ncounsel also indicated that they were open to “a mutually acceptable approach that accounts for \nour waiver concerns.” \n14.  On January 17, 2019, Director for Legal Services Clyde Mathews and Director for \nLitigation Steven Traubert conducted an additional phone conference with DePaul counsel.  On \nthat call, the dLCV agreed that it would complete its review of the documentation already provided \nby DePaul and would determine, in its discretion, its continued need for the report. \n15.  The dLCV met by telephone with DePaul counsel on March 28, 2019 and April 5, \n2019 to inform them of its continued need for the report and negotiate delivery of the Root Cause \nAnalysis (RCA) report to dLCV. DePaul continued to assert the work product privilege and \nexpress concerns about waiving that privilege, should it apply.  \n16.  To address DePaul’s privilege claim, on December 28, 2018, the dLCV offered to \nenter into a confidentiality agreement to protect the RCA from disclosure. In response, DePaul \npointed out that such an agreement may nonetheless result in a waiver of the privilege as to third-\nparties if the RCA is deemed voluntarily provided to dLCV, even with an agreement between the \nparties to maintain any privilege.   See, e.g., In re Mut. Funds Inv. Litig., 251 F.R.D. 185, 187 (D. \nMd. 2008) (finding “[t]he defendants’ voluntary disclosure of otherwise protected material to the \nSEC and NYAG, despite the entry of a confidentiality agreement, results in waiver.”); Fed. R. \nEvidence 502(e) (“An agreement on the effect of disclosure in a federal proceeding is binding only \non the parties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order.”); cf. Va. Code § 8.01-\n420.7(D) (“An agreement on the effect of the disclosure in a proceeding is binding only on the \nparties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a court order.”). \n4 \n \n\nCase 7:19-cv-00349-MFU   Document 1   Filed 05/03/19   Page 5 of 8   Pageid#: 5\n \n17.  The dLCV contends that the work product doctrine does not apply because the \nreport was produced under a recently revised state regulation 12VAC35-105-60, (Exhibit A), that \nrequires providers like DePaul to produce such reports in circumstances like this whether litigation \nis foreseen or not. See Solis v. Food Employers Labor Relations Assoc., 644 F.3d 221, 231-32 (4th \nCir. 2011)(“‘Materials prepared . . . pursuant to regulatory requirements’. . . do not constitute \n‘documents prepared in anticipation of litigation’ protected by work product privilege”)(citing \nNat’l union Fire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992)). DePaul \ncontends that the doctrine still applies despite any regulatory requirement, citing McCarthy v. \nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. (In re El-Atari), 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 589, at *16-17 (Bankr. E.D. Va. \n2013)(applying work product privilege to document in a highly regulated industry). \n18.  Even if work product were to apply, the dLCV contends its unique position as a \nfederally mandated and federally funded protection and advocacy (P&A) organization for disabled \npersons grants it broad access to records such as those here. PADD Act 42 U.S.C. §§ 15001–115 \n(2006); 45 CFR 1386.22 & .25(b). As such, the dLCV contends it is uniquely entitled to this report \ndespite the work product privilege. Iowa Protection and Advocacy Services v. Rasmussen, 206 \nF.R.D. 630, 643 (S.D. Iowa 2001)(holding that under the PADD Act a P&A agency was entitled \nto an investigative report “regardless of whether it is, in fact, covered by the work product \ndoctrine”). Consequently, by operation of law, DePaul must produce the RCA to the dLCV, \nwithout waiving any privilege (should one apply) as to any other party. See Disability Rights North \nCarolina v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp., 2013 WL 4854316, at *4 (Sept. 11, 2013 M.D. \nN.C.)(ordering production of peer review records to P&A under companion statute but finding that \ndefendant “has not waived its peer review privilege” because “Defendant is required to produce \nthese records to Plaintiff as a matter of law”). \n5 \n \n\nCase 7:19-cv-00349-MFU   Document 1   Filed 05/03/19   Page 6 of 8   Pageid#: 6\n \n19.  To address the parties’ respective concerns regarding production of the RCA, the \ndCLV and DePaul have agreed that DePaul will produce the RCA following the entry of a \nproposed Agreed Protective Order in accordance with Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d), which \nprovides:  “Controlling Effect of a Court Order.  A federal court may order that the privilege or \nprotection is not waived by disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court—in \nwhich event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other federal or state proceeding.”  Cf. Va. \nCode § 8.01-420.7(C) (“A court may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by the \ndisclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court, in which case the disclosure does \nnot operate as a waiver in any other proceeding.”). \nCAUSE OF ACTION \n20.  P&A access to records of individuals with developmental disabilities is outlined in \ndetail in 42 U.S.C. § 15043 and 45 CFR § 1386.22. \n21.  The DD Act at 42 U.S.C. § 15043(I) provides that the P&A shall have access to \n“all records” (emphasis added) of any individual who is a client of the P&A system, or in other \ncircumstances where the P&A is authorized.  \n22.  The DD Act at 42 U.S.C. §15043(J)(ii) authorizes access to the records “without \nconsent from another party in a situation in which services, supports, and other assistance are \nprovided to an individual with a developmental disability” […] “in any case of death of an \nindividual with a developmental disability[.]” (Emphasis added.) The dLCV received a report of \nthe individual’s death and subsequently requested records from DePaul by mail on December 13, \n2018.  \n23.  Furthermore, 42 U.S.C. §15043(J)(ii) states that the P&A shall receive “immediate \naccess, not later than 24 hours after the system makes such a request.”  \n6 \n \n\nCase 7:19-cv-00349-MFU   Document 1   Filed 05/03/19   Page 7 of 8   Pageid#: 7\n \n24.  The regulations at 45 C.F.R. § 1386.25(b) specify that: \n“[i]ndividual records to  which P&A systems  must have access  under section \n143(a)(2), (A)(i), (B), (I), and (J) of the Act (whether written or in another medium, \ndraft,  preliminary  or  final,  including  handwritten  notes,  electronic  files, \nphotographs or video or audiotape records) shall include, but shall not be limited \nto: (1) information and individual records, obtained in the course of providing \nintake, assessment, evaluation, supportive and other services, including medical \nrecords, financial records, and reports prepared or received by a member of the staff \nof a facility or program rendering care or treatment. This includes records stored or \nmaintained in locations other than the facility or program as long as the system has \nobtained  appropriate  consent  consistent  with  section  105(a)(4)  of  the Act. \nThe system shall  request  of  facilities  that  in  requesting  records  from  service \nproviders or other facilities on residents that they indicate in the release form the \nrecords may be subject to review by a system. (2) (2) Reports prepared by a Federal, \nState  or  local  governmental  agency,  or  a  private  organization  charged  with \ninvestigating incidents of abuse or neglect, injury or death. The organizations \nwhose reports are subject to this requirement include, but are not limited to, \nagencies in the foster care systems, developmental disabilities systems, prison and \njail systems, public and private educational systems, emergency shelters, criminal \nand civil law enforcement agencies such as police departments, agencies overseeing \njuvenile  justice  facilities,  juvenile  detention  facilities,  all  pre  -  and  post  - \nadjudication  juvenile  facilities,  State  and  Federal  licensing  and  certification \nagencies, and private accreditation organizations such as the Joint Commission on \nthe Accreditation of Health Care Organizations or by medical care evaluation or \npeer review committees, regardless of whether they are protected by federal or \nstate law.” (Emphasis added). \n \n25.  Under the statutes and regulations above, the dLCV is entitled to the production of \nthe RCA regardless of whether the work product doctrine (or peer review privilege) applies.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter the proposed \nProtective Order to be submitted with a joint motion by the parties, under which: \n1.  DePaul shall produce a copy of the final RCA to dLCV following entry of the \nproposed Order; \n7 \n \n\nCase 7:19-cv-00349-MFU   Document 1   Filed 05/03/19   Page 8 of 8   Pageid#: 8\n \n2.  DePaul’s production of the RCA to dLCV shall not operate as a waiver of any \nprivilege, including the work product privilege, and DePaul remains entitled to assert that \nprivilege in any later proceeding;  \n3.  The dLCV is uniquely entitled to receive the RCA even if work product or peer \nreview privileges apply; and \n4.  The dLCV shall maintain the RCA as confidential to the extent required by law.   \nFor the above-stated reasons, the Plaintiff disAbility Law Center of Virginia asks the \nCourt to enter judgment in its favor. \nRespectfully submitted, \nTHE DISABILITY LAW CENTER OF VIRGINIA \nMelissa A.

The dLCV is investigating that death.  \nPrior to this litigation, DePaul received a request from dLCV for information relating to \nthe resident’s death.  DePaul provided the underlying records requested, included all records relied \non to prepare the RCA. DePaul, however, asserted and continues to assert that the RCA and \ninterviews conducted following the resident’s death were prepared in anticipation of litigation and \nare privileged and protected from disclosure by the work product doctrine.  See, e.g., Virginia Code \n§ 8.01-420.7 (protecting work product in accordance with Rule 4:1 of the Rules of the Supreme \nCourt of Virginia when dealing with a public body under Va. Code § 2.2-3701, such as dLCV); \nVa. S. Ct. Rule 4:1(b)(3) (protecting work prepared in anticipation of litigation “by or for another \nparty or by or for that other party’s representative (including his attorney, consultant, surety, \nindemnitor, insurer, or agent)”); Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), Advisory Cmt.
