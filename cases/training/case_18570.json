The parties have submitted a Stipulated Protective Order for the court's consideration (Dkt. # 21 ).The court will take no action on the document the parties submitted. Paragraph 2 of the model stipulated protective order adopted by this District requires the parties to set forth with specificity the confidential material that shall be subject to the protective order. The court finds the fourth bullet point of Paragraph 2 of the parties' submission to be too broad and vague to provide sufficient specificity as to the materials to be protected. This order is without prejudice to a new submission that corrects the deficiency noted above. (VE) (Entered: 09/11/2013)"

The courts records reflect that the notice of appeal was filed during the pendency of a timely filed motion listed in Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4). The notice of appeal is therefore ineffective until entry of the order disposing of the last such motion outstanding. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).

Plaintiff \n2 \nB.S.  is  a  beneficiary,  as  defined  by  ERISA  § 3,  29 U.S.C.  § 1002(8),  of  the  Western \n3 \nClearing Corporation Health Benefit Plan. \n4 \n3.  Garrigan Lyman Group Health Benefit Plan.  The Garrigan Lyman \n5 \nGroup  Health  Benefit  Plan  is  an  “employee  welfare  benefit  plan”  under  ERISA \n6 \n§ 1002(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1).  The Garrigan Lyman Group Health Benefit Plan covers \n7 \nmore than 50 employees. \n8 \n4.  The  Western  Clearing  Corporation  Health  Benefit  Plan.    The \n9 \nWestern Clearing Corporation Health Benefit Plan is an “employee welfare benefit \n10 \nplan” under ERISA § 1002(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1002(1).  The Western Clearing Corporation \n11 \nHealth Benefit Plan does not cover more than 50 employees. \n12 \n5.  Regence BlueShield.  The health benefits of the Garrigan Lyman \n13 \nGroup Health Benefit Plan and The Western Clearing Corporation Health Benefit Plan \n14 \nare underwritten and administered by Regence BlueShield (“Regence”).  Regence is an \n15 \nauthorized health carrier based in King County and is engaged in the business of \n16 \ninsurance in the State of Washington, including King County.  Regence underwrites \n17 \nand  administers  benefits  for  many  ERISA-governed  employer-sponsored  employee \n18 \nwelfare benefits plans including plans with greater than 50 employees in Washington \n19 \nState (“Plans”).  Regence makes benefit determinations, reviews and finally decides \n20 \nappeals  of  denied  claims  under  the  Plans  it  insures,  and,  in  those  capacities,  is  a \n21 \nfiduciary under ERISA.  Regence is a Washington corporation that does business in the \n22  State of Washington, including King County. \n23  6.  Cambia Health Solutions, Inc., f/k/a The Regence Group.  Cambia \n24  Health Solutions, Inc., f/k/a The Regence Group (“Cambia”) is the nonprofit parent \n25  corporate owner of Regence BlueShield.  Cambia also owns other authorized health \n26  carriers engaged in the business of insurance in the State of Washington, including \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 2  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL.

Cambia provides claims processing and \n2 \nother services for Regence BlueShield and, based upon information and belief, for other \n3 \nwholly owned authorized health carriers engaged in the business of insurance in the \n4 \nState of Washington.  As a result, Cambia is a fiduciary under ERISA. \n5 \n7.  Relationship between Regence and Cambia.  Regence BlueShield \n6 \nof Washington and Cambia are “alter egos.”  See McKinnon v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of \n7 \nAlabama, 691 F. Supp. 1314, 1319 (1988), aff’d, 874 F.2d 820 (1989).  Regence and the \n8 \nother authorized health carriers doing business in the State of Washington that are \n9 \nwholly owned and/or managed by Cambia use the same or similar standard contracts \n10 \nfor  policies  issued  in  Washington  state,  the  same  standard  definition  of  “medical \n11 \nnecessity” and the same internal policies and procedures for determining coverage of \n12 \nABA and neurodevelopmental therapies.  Cambia’s wholly owned holding company, \n13 \nThe Regence Insurance Holding Company, provides claims processing services for \n14 \nRegence and, based upon information and belief, for Cambia’s other wholly-owned or \n15 \nmanaged authorized health carriers doing business in the State of Washington.  For the \n16 \npurpose of this Complaint, both are referred to as a single defendant, “Regence.” \n17 \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18 \n8.  Jurisdiction  of  this  Court  arises  pursuant  to  ERISA  § 502(e)(1), \n19 \n29 U.S.C. § 1132(e)(1).   \n20 \n9.  Venue  is  proper  under  ERISA  § 502(e)(2),  29 U.S.C.  § 1132(e)(2) \n21 \nbecause, inter alia, a defendant resides or may be found in this district. \n22 \nIII.  NATURE OF THE CASE \n23  10.  Plaintiffs  seek  to  end  Regence’s  standard  practice  of  insurance \n24 \ndiscrimination  against  thousands  of  Washington  children  with  developmental \n25 \ndisabilities.  Early and intensive provision of key therapies can dramatically improve \n26  the  health  and  life-long  wellbeing  of  insureds  with  developmental  disabilities.  \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 3  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL. (206) 223-0303    FAX (206) 223-0246 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-01214-RAJ     Document 1     Filed 07/11/13     Page 4 of 16\n \n1 \nRegence, however, routinely excludes and limits coverage of the essential therapies to \n2 \ntreat  developmental  conditions.    Plaintiffs  seek  to  enforce  both  the  federal  and \n3 \nWashington state Mental Health Parity Acts in Regence’s health plans to end such \n4 \ndiscriminatory practices. \n5 \n11.  On October 3, 2008, Congress enacted the Paul Wellstone and Pete \n6 \nDomenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (“Federal Parity \n7 \nAct”).  See 29 U.S.C. § 1185a; 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-5; 26 U.S.C. § 9812.  The Federal Parity \n8 \nAct became effective one year later on October 3, 2009.  The purpose of the law was to \n9 \nend  discrimination  in  the  provision  of  coverage  for  mental  health  treatment,  as \n10 \ncompared to medical and surgical services.  See Coal. for Parity, Inc. v. Sebelius, 709 F. \n11 \nSupp. 2d 10, 13 (D.D.C. 2010).  While the federal Parity Act does not require coverage \n12 \nof mental health services, if such coverage is provided, it must be provided “in parity” \n13 \nwith medical and surgical benefits.  Id. \n14 \n12.  At the same time, Regence’s ERISA insured plans are also subject \n15 \nto  Washington’s  Mental  Health  Parity  Act  (“Washington  Parity  Act”).    See \n16 \nRCW 48.44.341.    The  Washington  Parity  Act  is  also  designed  to  end  insurance \n17 \ndiscrimination against persons with mental health conditions:   \n18 \nTherefore, the legislature intends to require that insurance \n19  coverage be at parity for mental health services, which means \nthis  coverage  be  delivered  under  the  same  terms  and \n20  conditions as medical and surgical services. \n21 \nFinal Substitute House Bill 1154 (2005 Leg.).  A study by the Washington Department \n22 \nof Health had concluded that insurers’ false distinction between physical and mental \n23 \nhealth had caused thousands of Washington residents to go untreated.  See Mental \n24 \nHealth Parity Mandated Benefits Sunrise Review, Washington Department of Health, \n25 \nNovember 1998.  The study found that untreated mental disorders ultimately cost our \n26 \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 4  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL.

Both Washington and Federal Parity Acts, taken together, require \n4 \nRegence ERISA health plans to cover all outpatient and inpatient services to treat \n5 \nmental disorders covered by the diagnostic categories listed in the most current version \n6 \nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, so long as the services are \n7 \nmedically necessary.  For all health plans delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on \n8 \nor after October 3, 2009, the Acts require those health plans to ensure that treatment \n9 \nlimitations on services to treat DSM mental health conditions are the same as any such \n10 \nlimitations imposed on two-thirds of the plan’s medical and surgical services. 26 C.F.R. \n11 \n§ 54.9812-1T(b); 29 C.F.R. § 2590.712(c).  \n12 \n14.  Defendant Regence does not apply the Washington and Federal \n13 \nParity Act requirements to all services that are necessary to treat conditions listed in the \n14 \nDSM.    Regence  has  adopted  a  uniform  policy  excluding  all  coverage  for  applied \n15 \nbehavior  analysis  (ABA)  therapy  to  treat  autism  and  autism  spectrum  disorders.  \n16 \nPlaintiff K.M. was denied his pre-service request for coverage of ABA therapy to treat \n17 \nhis autism.  When he appealed, Regence refused to process his appeal, but again \n18 \nindicated that all coverage of ABA therapy to treat autism is excluded. \n19  15.  Defendant Regence also excludes and limits neurodevelopmental \n20 \ntherapies to treat autism and other developmental disorders.  Plaintiff B.S. was denied \n21 \nall coverage of neurodevelopmental therapy sessions to treat his autism.  Plaintiff K.M. \n22  was denied coverage of  neurodevelopmental therapy session to treat his autism after \n23  he exhausted the visit limits imposed on neurodevelopmental therapy in his plan, even \n24  though Regence does not impose such visit limits on two-thirds of Regence’s medical-\n25  surgical benefits.   \n26 \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 5  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL.

Regence’s uniform exclusions, limitations, policies and practices \n2 \nviolate the requirements of the Washington Parity Act, RCW 48.44.341 and the Federal \n3 \nParity  Act,  29 U.S.C.  § 1185a;  42  U.S.C.  § 300gg-5;  26  U.S.C.  § 9812,  and  their \n4 \nimplementing regulations, as incorporated as “terms of the plan[s]” into the Plans it \n5 \ninsures.  ERISA requires Regence to process claims and administer the Plans it insures \n6 \nin  a  manner  that  includes  the  requirements  of  non-preempted  state  and  federal \n7 \ninsurance  mandates,  such  as  the  Parity  Acts.    By  failing  to  do  so,  Regence  is \n8 \nsystemically and uniformly failing to properly process claims and administer the Plans \n9 \nit insures.  The Plans’ participants and beneficiaries have not received the benefits they \n10 \nare entitled to under the Plans. \n11 \n17.  This lawsuit seeks remedies for Regence’s breach of fiduciary duty \n12 \nunder ERISA, arising out of its failure to comply with the terms of the ERISA Plans it \n13 \ninsures.  It further seeks to recover the benefits that have been wrongfully denied to \n14 \nplaintiff and the class he seeks to represent.  It also seeks a court order declaring \n15 \nRegence’s exclusions, limitations, policies and practices illegal and void.  The lawsuit \n16 \nfurther seeks an injunction to prevent any future or ongoing efforts by Regence to use \n17 \nand enforce any exclusions, limitations, policies or practices that impermissibly deny, \n18 \nexclude or limit beneficiaries’ access to medically necessary services to treat conditions \n19 \nrecognized in the latest version of the DSM under the Plans it insures.   \n20 \nIV.

Size of Class.  All three classes of persons who have received, \n5 \nrequire or are expected to require neurodevelopmental and/or ABA therapy for the \n6 \ntreatment  of  conditions  listed  in  the  DSM,  and  who  have  been,  are  or  will  be \n7 \nbeneficiaries under ERISA-governed Plans insured by Regence, are expected to number \n8 \nin the thousands and is so large that joinder of all members is impracticable \n9 \n20.  Class Representative K.M.  Named plaintiff K.M. is an enrollee in \n10 \na Regence insured health benefit plan that is subject to ERISA.  K.M. is a beneficiary of \n11 \na plan sponsored by a large employer of more than 51 employees.  K.M. is diagnosed \n12 \nwith autism, a  condition that is listed in the most recent DSM.  K.M. needs both \n13 \nneurodevelopmental and ABA therapy to treat his autism.  Regence denied both K.M.’s \n14 \nrequests for coverage of neurodevelopmental therapies beyond Regence’s contractually \n15 \nimposed visit limits, and his request for coverage of ABA therapy services.  His claims \n16 \nare  typical  of  the  claims  of  the  other  members  of  the  Large  Employer \n17 \nNeurodevelopmental Class and the ABA Class, and through his parents, he will fairly \n18 \nand adequately represent the interests of these classes. \n19  21.  Class Representative B.S.  B.S. is a beneficiary in a Plan insured by \n20 \nRegence and subject to ERISA.  B.S. is a beneficiary of a plan sponsored by an employer \n21 \nwith fewer than 51 employees.  B.S. is diagnosed with autism, a condition that is listed \n22  in the latest version of the DSM.  He needs neurodevelopmental and ABA therapy to \n23  treat  his  autism.    Regence  denied  B.S.’s  requests  for  coverage  of  speech  and \n24  occupational  therapy  services  to  treat  his  mental  disorder  under  its \n25  neurodevelopmental  therapy  exclusion  for  insureds  over  the  age  of  six.

Common  Questions  of  Law  and  Fact.    This  action  requires  a \n5 \ndetermination of whether Regence’s application of contract provisions, policies and \n6 \npractices  that  deny,  exclude  and/or  limit  coverage  of  services  to  treat  conditions \n7 \nidentified in the DSM in health plans issued, delivered or renewed by Regence that are \n8 \nsubject to ERISA violates the requirements of the Washington and Federal Parity Acts.  \n9 \nThe Washington Parity Act requires “health benefit plans” such as Regence to cover \n10 \n“mental health services,” which is defined as any medically necessary outpatient and \n11 \ninpatient service provided to treat a mental disorder listed in the most recent version of \n12 \nthe  DSM.    See  RCW 48.44.341(1);  (2).    The  Federal  Parity  Act  requires  that  such \n13 \ncoverage be provided in strict parity with medical and surgical services generally.  The \n14 \ntwo  Parity  Acts,  taken  together,  renders  void  and  unenforceable  all  exclusions, \n15 \nlimitations, policies or practices that wholly exclude medically necessary services to \n16 \ntreat DSM conditions, or that establish treatment limitations that are more restrictive \n17 \nthan that for medical and surgical services generally.  Adjudication of this issue will in \n18 \nturn determine whether Regence is liable under ERISA for its conduct. \n19  23.  Separate  Suits  Would  Create  Risk  of  Varying  Conduct \n20 \nRequirements.  The prosecution of separate actions by class members against Regence \n21 \nwould create a risk of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual \n22  class  members  and  Plans  that  would  establish  incompatible  standards  of  conduct.  \n23  Certification is therefore proper under CR 23(b)(1). \n24  24.  Regence  Has  Acted  on  Grounds  Generally  Applicable  to  the \n25  Classes.  Regence, by applying policies and practices that result in the exclusion and \n26  improper limitation of certain services to treat certain conditions listed in the DSM, has \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 10  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL.

Certification  is  therefore  proper  under \n3 \nCR 23(b)(2). \n4 \n25.  Questions of Law and Fact Common to the Class Predominate \n5 \nOver  Individual  Issues.    The  claims  of  the  individual  class  members  are  more \n6 \nefficiently adjudicated on a class-wide basis.  Any interest that individual members of \n7 \nthe classes may have in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions is \n8 \noutweighed by the efficiency of the class action mechanism.  Upon information and \n9 \nbelief, there is no pending class action suit filed against these defendant for the same \n10 \nrelief  requested  in  this  action,  for  a  class  of  ERISA  insureds.    In  J.T.  v.  Regence \n11 \nBlueShield, No. 2:12-cv-00090 RAJ (W.D. Wash., J. Jones) , the trial court dismissed \n12 \nplaintiffs’  claims  for  class-wide  injunctive  relief  for  ERISA  insureds  related  to \n13 \nRegence’s coverage of neurodevelopmental therapies on standing grounds.  See Dkt. \n14 \nNos. 67 and 85.  The J.T. litigation does not seek any relief related to coverage of ABA \n15 \ntherapy to treat autism.     \n16 \n26.  This action can be most efficiently prosecuted as a class action in \n17 \nthe Western District of Washington, where Regence has its principal place of business, \n18 \ndoes business, and where K.M. and B.S. reside.  Issues as to Regence’s conduct in \n19 \napplying standard policies and practices towards all members of the class predominate \n20 \nover  questions,  if  any,  unique  to  members  of  the  class.

(206) 223-0303    FAX (206) 223-0246 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-01214-RAJ     Document 1     Filed 07/11/13     Page 12 of 16\n \n1 \nbenefit plans with health benefits insured by Regence that are subject to the Employee \n2 \nIncome Security Act of 1974 under ERISA § 4, 29 U.S.C. § 1003.  \n3 \n29.  Since January 1, 2006, and continuing to the present, K.M., B.S., \n4 \nand other members of the Neurodevelopmental, Large Employer Neurodevelopmental \n5 \nand ABA classes have been diagnosed with conditions that are considered mental \n6 \ndisorders covered by the diagnostic categories in the latest version of the DSM. \n7 \n30.  K.M.,  B.S.,  and  members  of  the  Neurodevelopmental,  Large \n8 \nEmployer Neurodevelopmental and ABA classes have sought or will seek and have \n9 \nreceived  or  will  receive  treatment  for  these  conditions  from  behavioral  and \n10 \nneurodevelopmental therapists.  Regence, however, has refused to cover, reimburse \n11 \nand/or authorize medically necessary neurodevelopmental and ABA therapist to treat \n12 \nthe mental conditions of K.M., B.S., and other members of the classes through the \n13 \napplication  of  certain  uniform  exclusions,  limitations,  internal  policies  and/or \n14 \npractices. \n15 \n31.  Because the application of these uniform exclusions, limitations, \n16 \ninternal policies and/or practices has resulted, and continues to result, in the exclusion \n17 \nor limitation of coverage for services to treat conditions listed in the DSM, and because \n18 \nRegence has failed, and continues to fail to provide and/or authorize such coverage, \n19 \nK.M., B.S. and members of the classes have paid for treatment rendered by these \n20 \nproviders out of their own pockets, or face the imminent threat that they will have to \n21 \ndo so in the near future, because their Plans have not received all of the benefits \n22  promised and insured by Regence.  Other class members have been forced to forgo \n23  necessary treatment due to Regence’s conduct. \n24  32.  In light of the established plan documents, public statements and \n25  internal policies of Regence and the written representations by Regence to K.M., B.S. \n26  and other class members, any attempt by K.M., B.S. or other class members to pursue \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 12  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL. (206) 223-0303    FAX (206) 223-0246 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-01214-RAJ     Document 1     Filed 07/11/13     Page 13 of 16\n \n1 \nadministrative remedies would have been futile.  Nonetheless, K.M. and B.S. appealed \n2 \nRegence’s denials of coverage of their neurodevelopmental therapies, and for K.M., \n3 \nRegence’s denial of his pre-service request for ABA therapy coverage, to no avail. \n4 \nVI.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n5 \nFIRST CLAIM: \n6  BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTIES \nERISA § 404(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a) \n7 \n33.  Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1 through 32, above. \n8 \n34.  Regence  is  a  fiduciary  under  ERISA  § 3(21)(A),  29 U.S.C. \n9 \n§ 1002(21)(A), because it makes benefit determinations, reviews and finally decides \n10 \nappeals of denied claims under the ERISA Plans it insures. \n11 \n35.  ERISA  imposes  strict  fiduciary  duties  upon  plan  fiduciaries.  \n12 \nERISA  § 404(a)(1)(C),  29 U.S.C.  § 1104(a)(1)(C),  states,  in  relevant  part,  that  a  plan \n13 \nfiduciary must discharge its duties with respect to a plan “solely in the interest of the \n14 \nparticipants  and  beneficiaries  and  …  in  accordance  with  the  documents  and \n15 \ninstruments  governing  the  plan  insofar  as  such  documents  and  instruments  are \n16 \nconsistent with the provisions of this title and Title IV.” \n17 \n36.  ERISA § 409(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1109(a), states, in relevant part:   \n18 \nAny person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who \n19  breaches  any  of  the  responsibilities,  obligations,  or  duties \nimposed  upon  fiduciaries  by  this  title  shall  be  personally \n20  liable  to  make  good  to  such  plan  any  losses  to  the  Plan \nresulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan \n21 \nany profits of such fiduciary which have been made through \n22  each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of \nsuch fiduciary which have been made through use of assets \n23 \nof the Plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other \nequitable  or  remedial  relief  as  the  court  may  deem \n24 \nappropriate, including removal of such fiduciary. \n25 \n26 \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 13  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL. (206) 223-0303    FAX (206) 223-0246 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-01214-RAJ     Document 1     Filed 07/11/13     Page 14 of 16\n \n1 \n37.  The terms of an ERISA plan include non-preempted provisions of \n2 \nsubstantive state and federal law, such as the requirements in the Washington Parity \n3 \nAct  and  the  Federal  Parity  Act.    In  processing  claims  for  benefits  and  otherwise \n4 \nadministering the Plans it insures, Regence has failed to comply with the terms of the \n5 \nPlans, which include the requirements of RCW 48.44.341, 29 U.S.C. § 1185a; 42 U.S.C. \n6 \n§ 300gg-5; 26 U.S.C. § 9812, and their implementing regulations. \n7 \n38.  Regence violated its obligations under ERISA § 404(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \n8 \n§ 1104(a)(1)  by  failing  act  in  accordance  with  the  documents  and  instruments \n9 \ngoverning the Plans, and breached its fiduciary duties to the Plans it insured, the \n10 \nplaintiff, and all class members. \n11 \n39.  As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  these  acts  and  omissions, \n12 \nplaintiffs, the Plans and the Plans’ participants and beneficiaries have suffered losses \n13 \nand are entitled to relief under ERISA against Regence. \n14 \n40.  Plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on behalf of the classes and the \n15 \nPlans for all class members, seeks recovery of all losses (including interest) arising from \n16 \nRegence’s breaches of its fiduciary duties when it failed to pay for, and insure, the care \n17 \nrequired by the Washington and Federal Parity Acts. \n18 \nSECOND CLAIM: \nCLAIM FOR RECOVERY OF BENEFITS, CLARIFICATION OF RIGHTS \n19 \nUNDER TERMS OF THE PLANS AND CLARIFICATION OF \nRIGHT TO FUTURE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLAN \n20 \nERISA § 503(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) \n21 \n41.  Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1 through 40, above. \n22 \n42.  ERISA  § 502(a)(1)(B),  29 U.S.C.  § 1132(a)(1)(B)  provides  that  a \n23 \nparticipant or beneficiary may bring an action to “recover benefits due to him under \n24 \nthe terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his \n25 \nrights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.” \n26 \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 14  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL. (206) 223-0303    FAX (206) 223-0246 \n \n\nCase 2:13-cv-01214-RAJ     Document 1     Filed 07/11/13     Page 15 of 16\n \n1 \n43.  Plaintiffs and the classes are entitled to recover benefits due them \n2 \ndue to the improper exclusion and/or limitations of ABA and neurodevelopmental \n3 \ntherapy.  They are also entitled to a declaration of present and future rights to benefits \n4 \nfor ABA and neurodevelopmental therapy under the Plans insured by Regence. \n5 \nTHIRD CLAIM: \n6  CLAIM TO ENJOIN ACTS AND PRACTICES IN VIOLATION OF THE TERMS \nOF THE PLANS, TO OBTAIN OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND TO \n7  ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THE PLANS \nERISA § 503(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) \n8 \n44.  Plaintiffs re-allege paragraphs 1 through 43, above. \n9 \n45.  ERISA § 503(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) provides that a participant \n10 \nor beneficiary may “enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this \n11 \nsubchapter or the terms of the plan.”  Plaintiffs and the classes seek to enjoin Regence \n12 \nfrom continuing to process and pay claims under its insured Plans in a manner that is \n13 \ninconsistent with the Washington and Federal Parity Acts, as incorporated into the \n14 \nterms of the Plans.  Plaintiffs and the classes also seek to have Regence provide the \n15 \nclasses with corrective notice and information, including reformation of the relevant \n16 \nPlan documents. \n17 \n46.  ERISA § 503(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3), further provides that a \n18 \nparticipant  or  beneficiary  may  obtain  other  appropriate  equitable  relief  to  redress \n19 \nviolations of ERISA or enforce plan terms.  To the extent full relief is not available \n20 \nunder ERISA  § 503(a)(1)(b), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) or ERISA  § 503(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. \n21 \n§ 1132(a)(2),  then  plaintiffs  and  the  classes  seek  equitable  “make  whole”  remedies \n22 \nincluding,  without  limitation,  unjust  enrichment,  disgorgement,  restitution,  and \n23 \nsurcharge  arising  out  of  Regence’s  failure  to  follow  the  requirements  of  the \n24 \nWashington and Federal Parity Acts, as incorporated into the terms of the Plans. \n25 \n26 \n  SIRIANNI YOUTZ  \n[REDACTED]  SPOONEMORE HAMBURGER \nCOMPLAINT (ERISA CLASS ACTION) – 15  999 THIRD AVENUE, SUITE 3650 \n  SEATTLE, WASHINGTON  98104 \nTEL.
