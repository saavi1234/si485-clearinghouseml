PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n18  1.  This civil rights action seeks injunctive and declaratory relief to enjoin Sheriff \n19  Chuck Atkins, Chief Ric Bishop, Commander Mike Anderson, and Clark County Jail from \n20  obstructing Disability Rights Washington’s full, complete, and meaningful access to all records \n21  necessary to investigate deaths in the jail over the last year. Disability Rights Washington, the \n22  federally designated protection and advocacy system for people with disabilities in Washington \n23  State, requested records pursuant to the federal Protection and Advocacy Acts, including the \n \nCOMPLAINT - 1  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 2 of 14\n \n1  Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights (DD) Act of 1975, 42 U.S.C. § 15041, \net seq., the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals With Mental Illness (PAIMI) Act, 42 U.S.C. \n2 \n§ 10801, et seq., and the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights (PAIR) Act 29 U.S.C. § \n3 \n794e, et seq., and the regulations promulgated pursuant to these statutes. Disability Rights \n4 \nWashington made this request in order to investigate numerous death that have occurred at Clark \n5 \nCounty Jail which is operated under the direction of Sheriff Atkins and the other defendants.  \n6 \n2.  Under federal law, Disability Rights Washington is entitled to any records \n7 \nnecessary to complete a full investigation, including video recordings. When an investigation \n8 \ninvolves a death, responses must be provided immediately, no later than 24 hours from the time \n9 \nof the request.  \n10 \n3.  In response to Disability Rights Washington’s record request, the jail has \n11 \nprovided written records, but refuses to provide responsive video records unless Disability \n12 \nRights Washington agrees not to share the videos with anyone. The federal law that gives \n13 \nprotection and advocacy systems like Disability Rights Washington access to these records does \n14 \nnot contain any requirement that Disability Rights Washington agree to never share records with \n15 \nanyone. In fact, the federal mandates expect that Disability Rights Washington will use the \n16 \ninformation it receives to educate and advocate.   \n17 \n4.  Defendants’ continued resistance to the independent scrutiny of the protection and \n18 \nadvocacy system though its refusal to provide the requested video is an unnecessary, \n19 \nunreasonable, and unlawful restriction on Disability Rights Washington’s ability to effectively \n20 \nprotect the rights of people with disabilities.  \n21 \n   \n22 \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 2  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 3 of 14\n \n1  II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5.  This action arises under the laws of the United States.  Plaintiff Disability Rights \n2 \nWashington seeks declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to, the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15041, \n3 \nthe PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801, and the PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e, to redress the \n4 \ninterference, by Defendants, in Disability Rights Washington’s ability to carry out the function \n5 \nof the protection and advocacy system for Washington State by denying Disability Rights \n6 \nWashington access to records that are necessary to conduct a full and meaningful investigation in \n7 \nto potential abuse and neglect.   \n8 \n6.  Jurisdiction in this matter is asserted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201 for \n9 \ncauses of action arising under the Constitution and federal statutory and common laws of the \n10 \nUnited States. \n11 \n7.  The rights which Plaintiff seeks to enforce are guaranteed by the federal \n12 \ngovernment through the mandates set forth in the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. §15041, the PAIMI Act, 42 \n13 \nU.S.C. § 10801, and the PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e.  These Acts establish a mandate for \n14 \nDisability Rights Washington to protect and advocate for individuals with developmental, \n15 \nmental, sensory, and physical disabilities who have been abused, neglected, or had their rights \n16 \notherwise violated.   \n17 \n8.  This Honorable Court also has authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 \n18 \nto enter declaratory judgments declaring the rights and other legal relations of parties to the \n19 \naction.   \n20 \n9.  An award of monetary damages is inadequate as plaintiff suffers and will continue \n21 \nto suffer irreparable harm from defendants’ actions, inactions, policies, and procedures and the \n22 \nviolations complained herein.   \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 3  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 4 of 14\n \n1  10.  Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as all parties reside in the State \nof Washington and Plaintiff’s claim for relief arises within this state.  Defendants performed the \n2 \nacts and omissions complained of herein in the State of Washington in this district.  This District \n3 \nprovides the most convenient forum for the litigation of these issues.   \n4 \nIII.  PARTIES \n5 \nPlaintiff  \n6 \nDisability Rights Washington \n7 \n11.

Clark County Jail \n12 \n21.  Defendant Clark County Jail is a county operated correctional facility housing \n13 \npeople charged with crimes or serving relatively short sentences, which includes numerous \n14 \npeople with disabilities, many of whom require specialized services or housing to be safe. As a \n15 \njail, its staff, facilities, and infrastructure are used to create and maintain records on the services \n16 \nand people it serves and the actions of staff.   \n17 \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n18 \n22.  At all times relevant herein, Disability Rights Washington has been, and is, \n19 \ndesignated by the Governor of the State of Washington as the protection and advocacy system \n20 \nfor those citizens of this state who have mental, developmental, and physical disabilities. \n21 \n23.  Disability Rights Washington, like each of the protection and advocacy agencies \n22 \ncurrently operating in the other forty-nine states, the federal protectorates (American Samoa, the \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 6  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 7 of 14\n \n1  Commonwealth of the North Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin \nIslands), and the District of Columbia, operates under the mandates of the DD Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n2 \n15041 et seq., the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., and the PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e et \n3 \nseq.  \n4 \n24.  As a result of the extensive congressional hearings preceding each of the aforesaid \n5 \nstatutory enactments, Congress found that there had been an extensive history of unlawful \n6 \ndiscriminatory segregation, extraordinary maltreatment, financial exploitation, neglect, and \n7 \nphysical abuse of individuals with disabilities throughout the United States.  \n8 \n25.  The federal laws that established the protection and advocacy systems were \n9 \ncreated in direct response to the need for independent advocacy services for individuals with \n10 \ndisabilities who were not getting adequate services from state operated programs. See e.g., 42 \n11 \nU.S.C. § 10501 (11)-(12).   \n12 \n26.  The Protection and Advocacy Acts (P&A Acts) require that each state, in \n13 \nexchange for receipt of certain federal financial assistance, “effect a system to protect and \n14 \nadvocate for the rights of persons” with disabilities and further specify that these systems must \n15 \nhave the authority to investigate and pursue legal and other appropriate remedies for those \n16 \npersons.  The DD Act, 42 U.S.C. § 15041 et seq., the PAIMI Act, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., and \n17 \nthe PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e et seq.     \n18 \n27.  The Washington State legislature provided for such a system with the enactment \n19 \nof R.C.W. 71A.10.080.  Specifically, under the provisions of R.C.W. 71A.10.080 (1), the \n20 \ndesignated protection and advocacy agency “shall have the authority to pursue legal, \n21 \nadministrative, and other appropriate remedies to protect the rights of the developmentally \n22 \ndisabled, and to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect.”    \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 7  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 8 of 14\n \n1  28.  Disability Rights Washington, in accordance with its congressional mandates, \nduties, and responsibilities as the designated protection and advocacy agency for Washington, \n2 \nemploys attorneys and advocates to provide protection and advocacy services to people in \n3 \nWashington who have mental, developmental, physical, and sensory disabilities.   \n4 \n29.  Disability Rights Washington’s mandate to provide investigative and advocacy \n5 \nservices to individuals with disabilities extends to individuals residing in both private and \n6 \npublicly-funded facilities. \n7 \n30.  Defendants administer Clark County’s jail.  \n8 \n31.  Jails are explicitly mentioned in a non-exclusive list of setting that are considered \n9 \na facility which “may include, but need not be limited to, hospitals, nursing homes, community \n10 \nfacilities for individuals with mental illness, board and care homes, homeless shelters, and jails \n11 \nand prisons.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 10802. \n12 \n32.  Disability Rights Washington has authority to initiate an investigation when it has \n13 \nprobable cause to suspect people with disabilities are being abused or neglected. \n14 \n33.  Disability Rights Washington’s determinations of probable cause are controlled \n15 \nby federal law which states:  \n16 \n(g) Determination of “probable cause” may result from P&A system monitoring \n17 \nor other activities, including observation by P&A system personnel, and reviews \nof monitoring and other reports prepared by others whether pertaining to \n18 \nindividuals with mental illness or to general conditions affecting their health or \nsafety. \n19 \n \n42 C.F.R. § 51.31.  \n20 \n34.  Here, Disability Rights Washington has relied upon its understanding of the terms \n21 \nabuse and neglect as defined by the Protection and Advocacy Acts as well as its extensive \n22 \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 8  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 9 of 14\n \n1  knowledge and experience with jail service delivery systems generally and its visits and review \nof records from Clark County Jail to determine it has probable cause.   \n2 \n35.  The federal laws that control Disability Rights Washington’s investigations define \n3 \nabuse as:  \n4 \nany act or failure to act by an employee of a facility rendering care or treatment \n5 \nwhich was performed, or which was failed to be performed, knowingly, \nrecklessly, or intentionally, and which caused, or may have caused, injury or \n6 \ndeath to a [sic] individual with mental illness, and includes acts such as— \n(A) the rape or sexual assault of a [sic] individual with mental illness; \n7 \n(B) the striking of a [sic] individual with mental illness; \n(C) the use of excessive force when placing a [sic] individual with mental illness \n8 \nin bodily restraints; and \n(D) the use of bodily or chemical restraints on a [sic] individual with mental \n9 \nillness which is not in compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations.  \n \n10 \n42 U.S.C.A. § 10802. \n \n11 \n36.  Neglect is defined as: \n12 \na negligent act or omission by any individual responsible for providing services in \na facility rendering care or treatment which caused or may have caused injury or \n13 \ndeath to a1 individual with mental illness or which placed a1 individual with \nmental illness at risk of injury or death, and includes an act or omission such as \n14 \nthe failure to establish or carry out an appropriate individual program plan or \ntreatment plan for a1 individual with mental illness, the failure to provide \n15 \nadequate nutrition, clothing, or health care to a [sic] individual with mental \nillness, or the failure to provide a safe environment for a [sic] individual with \n16 \nmental illness, including the failure to maintain adequate numbers of \nappropriately trained staff. \n17 \n42 U.S.C.A. § 10802. \n18 \n \n37.  Public reports from multiple media sources indicate there have been multiple \n19 \ndeaths in the Clark County Jail.  \n20 \n38.  On March 22, 2015, Mycheal Lynch, a 32 year old Vancouver resident, died from \n21 \na homicide in Clark County Jail after a restraint incident. \n22 \nhttp://www.columbian.com/news/2015/apr/16/clark-county-jail-inmate-death-homicide-lynch/ \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 9  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 10 of 14\n \n1  39.  On March 30, 2015, Douglas E. Mayhugh, a 35 year old Longview resident, died \nfrom suicide in the Clark County Jail of asphyxia due to hanging. \n2 \nhttp://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/inmates-death-in-clark-county-jail-is-ruled-a-suicide-\n3 \nby-hanging/ \n4 \n40.  On February 27, 2016, Daniel J. Fisher, a 33 year old Vancouver resident, died \n5 \nfrom suicide in the Clark County Jail of asphyxia due to hanging. \n6 \nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-\n7 \nnews/index.ssf/2016/04/clark_county_jail_reports_seco.html \n8 \n41.  In light of these deaths of inmates who may have needed additional services to \n9 \navoid homicide and suicide in the Clark County Jail, and in conjunction with previous records it \n10 \nhad received from Defendants regarding suicides in previous years and jail policies, and an on-\n11 \nsite visit to the facility on March 7, 2016 in which Disability Rights Washington attorneys and \n12 \nstaff interviewed jail staff and inmates, and took video and photographic recordings of various \n13 \njail settings, Disability Rights Washington determined it had probable cause to suspect possible \n14 \nabuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities affected by Defendants services or lack thereof.   \n15 \n42.  On April 13, Disability Rights Washington sent a request for: \n16 \n1. List of inmate deaths from 3/31/2015 to present, names of said inmates, and the \n17 \ndetermined causes of death;  \n18 \n2.

Jail records, inmate health records, and any other investigative records of \n23  additional inmates, if any, who died from suicide between 3/30/2015 and \npresent;  \n \nCOMPLAINT - 10  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 11 of 14\n \n1  6. The names and contact information of the individuals who have attempted to \ncommit suicide, and, if applicable, the legal guardian of each individual who \nattempted to commit suicide while being detained at Clark County Jail from \n2 \n1/1/2015 to present; and  \n3 \n7. Any updated jail policies or procedures regarding suicide precautions, \nassessment, and screening since March of 2015.  \n4 \n5  43.  That request informed Defendants that the definition of records included “written \n6  or in another medium, draft or final, including handwritten notes, electronic files, photographs or \n7  video or audio tape records….” 42 C.F.R. § 51.41(c) (emphasis added). \n8  44.  The request also informed Defendants that federal statute provides 24 hours to \n9  respond.  \n10  45.  Defendants have provided written records, but refuse to provide video records \n11  unless Disability Rights Washington agrees to not show anyone else the videos.  \n12  46.  It is now three weeks since that request was made, and subsequent to that request \n13  another death occurred in Clark County jail. \n14  47.  On April 22, 2016, Dustin M. Graves, a 23 year old Battle Ground resident, died \n15  from suicide in the Clark County Jail of asphyxia due to hanging. \n16  http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/apr/25/clark-county-jail-suicide-victim-idd-as-battle-\n17  ground-man/ \n18  48.  This delay highlights the urgency of timely production of records as Defendants \n19  continue to operate a correctional facility and serve countless people with disabilities every day.  \n20  49.  Disability Rights Washington attempted to resolve this issue without resorting to \n21  litigation over several phone and email exchanges with Defendants’ counsel. See e.g. Letter from \n22  David Carlson , Director of Legal Advocacy, Disability Rights Washington, to Jane Vetto, \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 11  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 12 of 14\n \n1  Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, Civil Division Clark County Prosecutor’s Office (May 3, \n2016) a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.  \n2 \n50.  As a result of Defendants’ refusal to follow federal law, DRW has been denied \n3 \naccess to conduct a full and meaningful investigation and has been unable to fulfill its federal \n4 \nmandate to investigate possible abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities. \n5 \n51.  Defendants not only refuse to provide the video without restrictions on how \n6 \nDisability Rights Washington may use it, Defendants also refuse to provide their actual reason \n7 \nfor denial or delay as required by federal law. 42 CFR § 51.43.  Instead their written response is: \n8 \n“The Jail videos are different from other records and unrestricted release of those records \n9 \nexposes guards and inmates to unacceptable risks.” See Email string terminating in email from \n10 \nStacie Siebrecht, Associate Director of Legal Advocacy, Disability Rights Washington, to Chris \n11 \nHorne, Chief Civil Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, Civil Division Clark County Prosecutor’s \n12 \nOffice (May 3, 2016) a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2. There is no \n13 \nfactual support for Defendants’ conclusion and most importantly, no legal support for violating \n14 \nfederal law.   \n15 \n52.  Defendants have been made aware of Disability Rights Washington’s federal \n16 \nauthority to obtain relevant videos, when Disability Rights Washington is investigating abuse \n17 \nand neglect.  \n18 \n53.  Defendants’ refusal to provide the videos frustrate the federally mandated \n19 \nfunctions and duties of the protection and advocacy system.  As described in the foregoing \n20 \nparagraphs, Plaintiff attempted, on multiple occasions, to resolve its access issue with the \n21 \nDefendants.  These attempts have proven unsuccessful.   \n22 \n23 \n \nCOMPLAINT - 12  Disability Rights Washington \n  315 5th Avenue South, Suite 850 \n \nSeattle, Washington   98104 \n(206) 324-1521    Fax: (206) 957-0729  \n \n\nCase 3:16-cv-05329-RBL   Document 1   Filed 05/04/16   Page 13 of 14\n \n1  54.  Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer direct and irreparable injury to its \nstatutory interests in investigating abuse and neglect. \n2 \n55.  Plaintiff has standing to bring this action on its own behalf, because the refusal of \n3 \naccess by Defendants constitutes an injury in fact to Plaintiff’s legally-protected interests.  This \n4 \ninjury is concrete, particularized, actual, and imminent.  There is a causal relationship between \n5 \nthe injury and Defendants’ challenged conduct, and a favorable decision by this Court will \n6 \naddress the injury.  \n7 \n56.  Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.   \n8 \nV.  CLAIMS \n9 \n57.  Violation of DRW’s Rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 42 U.S.C. § 10541, et seq., \n10 \n42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq., and 29 U.S.C. § 794e. \n11 \nVI.  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n12 \n58.  Wherefore, plaintiff Disability Rights Washington respectfully prays to the \n13 \nHonorable Court for the following relief: \n14 \n  A.  For an Order assuming Jurisdiction over this case; \n15 \n  B.

For an Order directing Defendant to immediately provide plaintiff \nDisability Rights Washington with all video records responsive to its April 13, 2016 \n2 \nrequest; \n3 \n  D.  For an Order directing Defendant to adhere to the P&A Acts in responding \n4 \nto Disability Rights Washington’s access requests;  \n5 \n  E.  For an Order directing Defendant to pay Plaintiff’s reasonable attorney \n6 \nfees and costs associated with enforcing Plaintiff’s rights in this action; and \n7 \n  F.  For an Order granting Plaintiff such other and further relief as this Court \n8 \ndeems just and proper.   \n9 \n  Dated this 4th day of May, 2016. \n10 \n \n            Respectfully Submitted, \n11 \n \n            DISABILITY RIGHTS WASHINGTON \n12 \n \n \n13 \n          By:  /s/David R.
