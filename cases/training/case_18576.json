This is a civil action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against \n3  Defendants for allowing legally incompetent criminal defendants (hereinafter “patients”) \n4  to languish for months in county jails rather than promptly transporting them to a state-run \n5  mental health treatment facility for competency restoration treatment as required by court \n6  orders, state statutes, and the constitutions of the United States and Washington State.  \n7  2.  Because of Defendants’ acts and omissions, Ms. Ara Badayos has been \n8  confined for the past 33 days (as of August 4) in solitary confinement in Snohomish \n9  County Jail (without any of the legally and medically necessary treatment) rather than at \n10  Western State Hospital (WSH) or an analogous facility where she would have spent the \n11  same period of time receiving professional care.  \n12  3.  The maximum allowable time for Defendants to attempt restoration for Ms. \n13  Badayos is 45 days.  \n14  4.  Defendants official position (as indicated in sworn testimony and legal \n15  filings at various Show Cause hearings in the underlying criminal actions) is that the 45 \n16  day period does not begin until Ms. Badayos is transported to WSH, and that there is no \n17  timeline whatsoever for transporting her.  \n18  5.  Thus, Defendants’ sincerely believe that there is no deadline whatsoever \n19  for transporting Ms. Badayos, and that she could lawfully be held indefinitely.  \n20  6.  Plaintiffs, who are advocates for Ms. Badayos and similarly situated \n21  persons, have attempted to obtain Defendant’s compliance with the law by repeatedly \n22  filing motions in the state trial court.  \n23  7.  The state trial courts, in piecemeal fashion, occasionally order Defendants \n24  to transport these patients and rarely dismiss the criminal actions for governmental \n25  mismanagement, but have declined to issue a general order requiring Defendants to \n26   \n2 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 3 of 18\n \n \n1  transport competency restoration patients within a specific time period.  \n2  8.  The most-recent information (dated August 1) from Defendants admit that \n3  (in addition to Ms. Badayos) “approximately 100” other competency restoration patients \n4  are waiting in county jails to be transported to WSH; and that the average wait-time for \n5  each of these persons is 51 days (just under two months). See Exhibit 3 to Declaration of \n6  Trueblood at para. 3. \n7  9.  This inhumane treatment of mentally ill individuals is an ongoing crisis. \n8  Without immediate intervention, Ms. Badayos and at least 100 other similarly situated \n9  persons will continue to be unlawfully and indefinitely held in harmful circumstances and \n10  without legally and medically necessary treatment.   \n11  JURISDICTION \n12  10.  This Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§1331 and \n13  1343 because this is an action arising under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \n14  amendments to the United States Constitution.  \n15  11.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), this Court has supplemental jurisdiction \n16  over related claims arising under state law, namely sections Three, Ten, Twelve, \n17  Fourteen, and Twenty Two of the Washington State Constitution, and a variety of \n18  Washington State statutes. \n19  12.  The Court has jurisdiction to award declaratory and injunctive relief \n20  pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. \n21  13.  Venue is appropriate in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §1391(b)(2) because the \n22  events giving rise to this complaint occurred in Snohomish County in the Western District \n23  of Washington. \n24  PARTIES \n25  THE PLAINTIFFS \n26   \n3 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 4 of 18\n \n \n1  14.  Ms. Ara Badayos is a 27year-old U.S. citizen domiciled in Washington \n2  State. Though she is “the real party in interest,” she lacks capacity to stand trial due to \n3  severe mental illness and cannot serve as Plaintiff in this action. She has no legal \n4  guardian and no known family members.  \n5  15.  Because Ms. Badayos is incapacitated and otherwise without \n6  representation and because of the emergent nature of these claims, Plaintiff Cassie \n7  Cordell Trueblood brings this suit as Ms. Badayos’ “next friend”1, pursuant to FRCP 17 \n8  (c)(2). Ms. Trueblood is the duly appointed criminal defense attorney representing Ms. \n9  Badayos on a criminal charge underlying this civil suit. Ms. Trueblood practices law in \n10  Snohomish County, Washington. \n11  16.  Ms. Trueblood requests the Court appoint a Guardian Ad Litem for Ms. \n12  Badayos, pursuant to FRCP 17 (c)(2).  \n13  17.  Ms. Trueblood also brings suit on her own behalf for frustration of mission \n14  and injury to resources available to represent other clients. \n15  18.  Plaintiff Snohomish County Public Defender Association (SCPDA) is a \n16  non-profit corporation whose purpose and function is to represent indigent people facing \n17  criminal prosecution in Snohomish County, Washington. SCPDA employs Plaintiff Cassie \n18  Trueblood as a trial attorney. SCPDA brings this action on its own behalf for frustration of \n19  its mission and injury to the organization. \n20  19.  Because Ms. Trueblood’s and SCPDA’s incompetent in-custody clients \n21  face significant obstacles to asserting their own rights (including imminent mootness of \n22  individual claims due to transport to WSH during the pendency of the case, and their \n23                                                   \n1 Ms. Trueblood is the only apparent advocate for Ms. Badayos. Ms. Trueblood is professionally and \n24  ethically bound to advance every lawful and proper argument for Ms. Badayos. Ms. Trueblood and Ms. \nBadayos have a sufficiently close relationship to permit Ms. Trueblood to effectively advance the pertinent \n25  claims. Ms. Trueblood is uniquely qualified, by virtue of the confidential attorney-client relationship to litigate \nthe unconstitutionality of Defendants’ acts and omissions. \n26   \n4 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 5 of 18\n \n \n1  impaired mental condition), Plaintiffs also brings this action on behalf of clients – past, \n2  present, and future – who suffer injury as a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions.  \n3  Are not only responsible for advancing every lawful defense and argument for its clients, \n4  but also have a “special public duty to improve the overall quality and efficiency of the \n5  criminal justice system,” rendering them well-suited to litigate the claims of their clients.  \n \n6 \nDEFENDANTS \n7 \n20.  Defendant Washington State Department of Social and Human Services \n8 \n(DSHS) is the governmental entity that oversees a variety of social welfare programs, \n9 \nincluding Defendant Western State Hospital (WSH). \n10 \n21.  Defendant WSH is one of two state-run psychiatric hospitals (the other is \n11 \nEastern State Hospital), and serves the mentally ill population in the western half of the \n12 \nstate. WSH is the facility to which mentally ill criminal defendants are committed for all \n13 \npurposes related to a criminal proceeding, including those (like Ms. Badayos) in need of \n14 \ncompetency restoration prior to facing prosecution. \n15 \n22.  Defendant Kevin W. Quigley is the Secretary of Defendant Washington \n16 \nState Department of Social and Human Services (DSHS). Mr. Quigley is responsible for \n17 \nDSHS’s mental health program (including Western and Eastern State Hospitals) and their \n18 \ncompliance with state and federal law. Mr. Quigley, for all purposes relevant to this suit, \n19 \nhas acted under color of law. \n20 \n23.  Defendant Ron Alder is the Certified Executive Officer of Defendant WSH.  \n21 \nIn his professional capacity, Mr. Alder is responsible for WSH (including its duty to \n22 \ntransport people for restoration of legal competence) and its compliance with state and \n23 \nfederal law. Mr. Alder, for all purposes relevant to this suit, has acted under color of law. \n24 \n24.  Defendant Dr. Brian Waiblinger is the Medical Director for Defendant WSH. \n25 \nIn his professional capacity, Dr. Waiblinger is responsible for supervising the \n26   \n5 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 6 of 18\n \n \n1  transportation of patients to the hospital, scheduling admissions, and developing the \n2  prioritization algorithm for the admissions waitlist. Mr. Waiblinger, for all purposes \n3  relevant to this suit, has acted under color of law.  \n4   \n5  STANDING \n6  25.  SCPDA has standing to sue on its own behalf, for injuries suffered as a result \n7  of Defendants' practice of delay in admitting criminal defendants represented by SCPDA to \n8  WSH for needed restorative mental health treatment. SCPDA will demonstrate that its \n9  ability to represent its clients' interests is being impaired by Defendants' refusal to accept \n10  custody, and that it is expending additional resources to effectively represent such clients \n11  and to advocate for a just and fair criminal justice system. On that basis, this Court should \n12  find that SCPDA has organizational standing. See Oregon v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, \n13  1108-09 (9th Cir. 2002); Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 368, 379 (1982). \n14   \n15  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n16  26.  Ms. Badayos is extremely mentally ill. She is currently subject to a civil \n17  commitment order under the “presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled” \n18  standard, as provided by RCW 71.05.  \n19  27.  She has also been found to be legally incompetent (meaning that she does \n20  not have the mental ability to understand the criminal process and aid in the defense, as \n21  provided by RCW 10.77). In the Forensic Mental Health Report of Ms. Badayos, the \n22  Defendant described her as in a “severely agitated and decompensated state.” See \n23  Exhibit 1 to Declaration of Trueblood at .pdf pg. 10, document pg. 8. On August 1, after \n24  indicating her agreement to come to court, she removed all of her clothing, made \n25  court-inappropriate gestures, and then indicated her refusal to come to court.  \n26   \n6 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 7 of 18\n \n \n1  28.  Ms. Badayos is held in solitary confinement in the Snohomish County Jail \n2  on a criminal charge of Assault in the Third Degree for allegedly slapping a police officer.2 \n3  (Plaintiff Cassie Trueblood, who is employed by Plaintiff SCPDA, is the duly appointed \n4  public defender representing Ms. Badayos on this charge.)  \n5  29.  Because Ms. Badayos is legally incompetent, the prosecution is stayed \n6  indefinitely pending restoration of competence (in which case, prosecution would \n7  resume) or a determination that competence is unlikely (in which case, the charge would \n8  be dismissed).  \n9  30.  On July 2, the state trial court ordered Defendants to transport Ms. Badayos \n10  to WSH to attempt restoration of legal competence for a period not to exceed 45 days. \n11  See Exhibit 2 to Declaration of Trueblood at para. A. \n12  31.  On August 1, Plaintiff Cassie Trueblood moved the trial court to order WSH \n13  to show cause why it failed to transport Ms. Badayos, to pay sanctions for contempt of the \n14  trial court’s July 2 order, and to transport to Ms. Badayos to WSH for treatment \n15  immediately. The trial court denied all of these motions, instead ordering Defendants to \n16 \n                                                 \n17 \n2 A summary of the procedural posture of the underlying criminal case: Ms. Badayos has been in- and \nout-of-custody on the Assault 3 charge since March 14, when the incident allegedly occurred. Ms. Badayos \n18 \nwas held on bail in what is called a “felony-expedited” process, which was not to exceed 14 days during \nwhich time she was not officially charged. On March 25, Ms. Badayos was charged with Assault in the Third \n19 \ndegree. On March 26, bail was set at $2,500. On March 28, she was arraigned and a plea of not guilty was \nentered on her behalf. At that time she was released on the charge, but was not actually released until jail \n20 \nstaff evaluated her for mental health issues. On April 11, she appeared for an in-custody scheduling \nhearing. On April 14, she was released so that she could be admitted to Providence Hospital in Everett for \n21 \ncivil commitment. On May 8, she appeared at an out-of-custody scheduling hearing and the case was \ncontinued. On May 30, Ms. Badayos was back in-custody and the trial court ordered Western State Hospital \n22  (WSH) to perform an initial evaluation of Ms. Badayos’ legal competence to stand trial. On June 12, defense \ncounsel noted a motion that WSH show cause why it had failed to perform evaluation. On June 13, WSH \n23  submitted the evaluation, concluding that Ms. Badayos is legally incompetent. On July 1, an incident \nbetween Ms. Badayos and a nurse at the residential treatment facility resulted in Ms. Badayos’ \n24  re-incarceration. Back in custody on July 2, the trial court ordered WSH to attempt restoration of Ms. \nBadayos’s legal competence within a 45 day period. When nothing happened, Defense counsel noted a \n25  motion for August 1 demanding that WSH show cause for its failure to transport Ms. Badayos for restoration \nof competence. \n26   \n7 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 8 of 18\n \n \n1  evaluate Ms. Badayos for expedited transportation to WSH under a “medical emergency” \n2  exception3 to Defendant’s plainly unconstitutional practice of refusing to transport \n3  incarcerated patients.  \n4  32.  The trial court ordered Defendants to perform this “medical emergency” \n5  evaluation on Monday, August 4 by 5 p.m. Immediately after the hearing, through their \n6  counsel, Defendants indicated to Ms. Trueblood (and not to the trial court) their intent to \n7  again violate the trial court’s order by not evaluating Ms. Badayos until Tuesday, August \n8  5.  \n9  33.  Since July 2, Defendants have done nothing to comply with the order to \n10  transport and treat Ms. Badayos. As of today, August 4, Ms. Badayos is still waiting in \n11  solitary confinement. \n12  34.  In response to Ms. Trueblood’s demand that WSH show cause for its failure \n13  to transport Ms. Badayos, Defendant Dr. Brian Waiblinger (WSH’s Medical Director) \n14  submitted a sworn declaration (dated July 30). The declaration states that the current \n15  waitlist for transportation to WSH is “approximately 100 [patients],” and that the average \n16  wait is “51 days.” The declaration also states that WSH anticipates transporting Ms. \n17  Badayos “by the third week in August.” See Exhibit 3 to Declaration of Trueblood at para. \n18  4. Dr. Waiblinger also testified on the record at the August 1 hearing that he could give a \n19  “date certain” for Ms. Badayos’s transport of August 22. \n20  35.  Defendant’s explanation for this comprehensive refusal to comply with court \n21  orders, constitutional and statutory law, and basic human decency is that WSH does not \n22 \n                                                 \n23  3 To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, Defendants have never before offered or even hinted at this “medical \nemergency” exception, and there is no authority in statute or administrative materials suggesting such an \n24  option. This appears to have been a last-ditch effort to prevent the trial court from ordering sanctions. While \nin the opinion of Plaintiffs, Ms. Badayos certainly should qualify for this exception, such an option is entirely \n25  beside the point that Defendants continually fial to promptly transport all legally incompetent patients, \nmedical emergency or no. \n26   \n8 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 9 of 18\n \n \n1  have enough physical bed space to promptly treat every patient.  \n2  36.  However, state statute provides Defendants with an alternative to the \n3  resource-scarce WSH: “some other facility as determined by the [Defendants] for … \n4  treatment.” RCW 10.77.086(1)(a)(ii). Defendants have apparently never even attempted \n5  to make such an alternate available to handle the additional demand on its system. \n6  37.  Defendants also claim that the “performance targets” (enacted in 2012 in \n7  response to a similar waitlist problem at WSH) providing that competency restoration \n8  patients should be transported to WSH within seven days are non-binding and therefore \n9  can be ignored. See RCW 10.77.068.  \n10  38.  Based upon a hair-splitting interpretation, Defendants claim that the statute \n11  specifically providing that “[c]onfinement in a county jail or other local facility while \n12  awaiting either placement in a treatment program or a court hearing pursuant to this \n13  chapter is permitted for no more than seven days” only pertains to other categories of \n14  mentally ill individuals (who are held “pursuant to this chapter”), and not competency \n15  restoration patients (who are Defendants claim are only held pursuant to their criminal \n16  charge). RCW 10.77.220. It is Defendant’s practice to transport NGRI persons within \n17  three days. \n18  39.  In this apparent belief in the total lack of any timeline, Defendants have \n19  developed an “algorithm” to determine which patients should be transported first. \n20  Defendants concede that this system is not on a first-come, first-served basis. The \n21  algorithm always prioritizes other categories of criminally-involved patients over \n22  individuals requiring competency restoration. These categories include those patients \n23  who have been found Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI) and “criminal conversion” \n24  patients (meaning they are civilly committed after their criminal action has been \n25  dismissed). \n26   \n9 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 10 of 18\n \n \n1  40.  Defendants’ algorithm also places certain categories of restoration patients \n2  before others.4 Ms. Badayos’ category, arbitrarily, is located towards the end of this \n3  prioritization scheme. In any event, Defendants confidently assert that they are under no \n4  deadline whatsoever to transport any felony restoration patient.  \n5  41.  Defendant’s algorithm, in prosecutorial fashion, perversely benefits those \n6  who have admitted the acts underlying their criminal conduct over those who have an \n7  unconditional right to dispute their charges. In this respect, Defendant’s system \n8  incentivizes Plaintiffs to put their clients through the NGRI process rather than having \n9  those clients evaluated for basic legal competence to understand the criminal process. \n10  42.  It is undisputed that, were Ms. Badayos an NGRI patient, WSH would have \n11  made room for her, and she would have been transported to the hospital within seven \n12  days of July 2. It is further undisputed that, were the case dismissed, Ms. Badayos would \n13  be sent to a treatment facility in three days by a county designated mental health \n14  professional and would receive treatment.  \n15  43.  The wait for available beds at WSH is getting worse while Ms. Badayos and \n16  similarly situated individuals languish in jail. On July 2 (when Defendants were ordered to \n17 \n                                                 \n18 \n4 . The maximum period for restoring patients held on misdemeanor charges is 14 days. RCW 10.77.088. \nThe maximum initial period for restoring patients held on non-serious felony charges is 45 days (the initial \n19 \nperiod is 90 days for “serious” felony offenses), while second and third restoration periods for all felonies are \n90 days each. RCW 10.77.088. The algorithm places those patients on 14 day misdemeanor restoration \n20 \norders and those on the third 90 day felony restoration order before all initial 45 day felony restoration \norders. Those on second 90 restoration orders are last. See Exhibit 5 to Declaration of Trueblood at pg. 4, \n21 \nln. 7 through pg. 5, ln. 1. Thus, Ms. Badayos, with an initial 45 day order, is located behind all misdemeanor \npatients, all felony patients on their last restoration period, and—of course behind those felony patients in \n22  the same category as her who were placed on the list before her. Defendants’ explanation for this \nconvoluted system is their belief that state statute requires them to transport NGRI patients within seven \n23  days, criminal conversion patients within three days, and misdemeanor restoration patients within a \n“reasonable time.” The rest of the prioritization scheme is simply Defendants’ policy. It may be that \n24  Defendants transport other patients before competency restoration patients because of the risk that other \npatients will be released otherwise. Defendants need not be concerned that felony restoration patients will \n25  be released. Because Defendants are confident Ms. Badayos will stay in jail until she is transported, she \nmust wait for months while other patients are admitted ahead of her. \n26   \n10 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 11 of 18\n \n \n1  take custody of Ms. Badayos), there were approximately 72 patients on the waitlist. On \n2  July 25, when Dr. Waiblinger testified in an almost identical scenario in a different case in \n3  Snohomish County, he indicated the waitlist had grown to 84 patients. When Dr. \n4  Waiblinger testified on August 1, the waitlist was 100 incarcerated, mentally ill people.  \n5  44.  This 100 person waitlist does not include in-custody patients awaiting for \n6  Defendants to perform the initial evaluation on competency. \n7  45.  This 100 person figure does not include competency restoration patients \n8  waiting for admission to Eastern State Hospital (the waitlist for which is rumored to be \n9  similarly long). \n10  46.  Defendants caused similar injuries to competency restoration patients in \n11  2012. Law suits were prepared but not filed. A legislative fix was attempted, resulting in \n12  the “performance targets” of RCW 10.77.068. Unfortunately, the problem has surfaced \n13  again, and Defendants only point to the section of RCW 10.77.068 for the proposition that \n14  the targets are non-binding. \n15  47.  Snohomish County Jail records independently corroborate Defendant’s \n16  admissions. As of July 30, 2014, 14 mentally ill individuals were subject to a WSH \n17  transport order from that jail alone. Those people had waited an average of 38 days \n18  before WSH provided the court-ordered transportation and treatment. One individual \n19  waited 56 days. See exhibit __ to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  \n20  48.  Given the virtual certainty that some, if not all, of these in-custody mentally \n21  ill people qualify for a public defender, they are likely constituents of Plaintiff SCPDA. \n22  Unfortunately, there has not been an opportunity prior to the filing of this suit to \n23  individually identify and contact these individuals regarding participating in this suit as \n24  plaintiffs. \n25  49.  Plaintiffs Ms. Trueblood and SCPDA have been repeatedly forced to file \n26   \n11 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 12 of 18\n \n \n1  briefing, attending hearings, and otherwise expend significant efforts to force Defendants \n2  to comply with the law, taking away from Plaintiffs’ resources to effectively advocate for all \n3  of their clients on issues more directly related to the substance of criminal prosecution.  \n4  50.  Furthermore, Defendants place Plaintiffs in an ethical quandary. When \n5  Plaintiffs reasonably believe that their clients suffer from diminished capacity, RPC 1.14 \n6  requires the lawyer to take protective action to protect their clients. On the other hand, \n7  RPC 1.2 obligates Plaintiffs to abide by their client’s objectives, which universally include \n8  avoiding unnecessary incarceration. Raising concerns about a client’s legal competence \n9  knowing that doing so will subject the client to injury at the hands of the Defendants \n10  creates a real dilemma for conscientious attorneys.  \n11  51.  County jails are neither designed nor prepared to house (let alone treat) \n12  mentally ill individuals.5 Jails control inmates through discipline. Such system is \n13  ineffective for mentally ill persons, and, in fact, harmful to them. \n14  52.  The Snohomish County Jail is a particularly inappropriate place to house \n15  the mentally ill because of the Jails’ demonstrated inability to care for that population. The \n16  U.S. Justice Department (in response to multiple recent inmate deaths at the Jail) \n17  investigated the facility, finding that “treatment for mental illness is very limited beyond \n18  medications, and treatment planning is inadequate for the number of inmates who have \n19  or who likely have a diagnosable mental illness. . . . There is virtually no regular individual \n20  or group mental health treatment provided to the inmates.” Exhibit ___ to Plaintiff’s Motion \n21 \n                                                 \n22  5 The Jail can provide medication management for people who are willing to take medications, but cannot \nadminister medication involuntarily, except in a life-threatening emergency.  When resources permit, \n23  treatment for “unfit to proceed” defendants may possibly include basic clinical psychiatry and intervention.  \nSuch treatment is designed to stabilize the inmate.  However, some inmates, particularly those with mental \n24  illness, refuse or do not respond to medication, and do not otherwise respond to the treatment the jails can \nprovide. Jails tend to segregate the mentally ill. Conversely, WSH provides housing for persons found unfit \n25  to proceed is staffed by full-time psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health specialists, recreation \ncounselors, social workers, mental health technicians, and nurses. \n26   \n12 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 13 of 18\n \n \n1  for Preliminary Injunction at page 62. \n2  53.  County jails are punitive environments—not restorative. They do not \n3  provide adequate, if any, services for the mentally ill. The Justice Department’s report \n4  also notes that “prisons and jails, which tend to be environments that exacerbate the \n5  symptoms of mental illness, inmates with mental illness are especially at risk of harming \n6  themselves or others.” Exhibit ___ to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction at page \n7  56.  \n8  54.  On August 1, when asked by jail staff, Ms. Badayos initially indicated she \n9  would come to court for the show cause hearing against Defendants. When, staff went to \n10  her cell to pick her up, she was entirely naked, made obscene anatomical gestures \n11  toward jail staff, and then indicated her unwillingness to come to court. The extended \n12  isolation in solitary confinement has obviously caused additional damage to her mental \n13  state. She has apparently not washed herself for some time. Jail staff were overheard to \n14  say that they wished they had a way to remotely flush the toilet in her cell prior to opening \n15  the door. \n16  55.  She is, and has been, isolated in this 8’ by 10’ cell for 23 hours per day for \n17  the past 33 days. The cell contains a granite slab for a bed with a ¼” thick piece of rubber \n18  padding, a blanket, a fixed, backless stool, concrete bench, and an aluminum toilet. She \n19  is allowed out of her cell for one hour a day. During that hour she remains in hand and leg \n20  restraints unless she chooses to shower, which she rarely does. Jail staff will not remove \n21  her from the cell even to meet with her attorney; Ms. Trueblood is forced to communicate \n22  with Ms. Badayos through a closed, locked metal door with a small plexiglass window and \n23  hole for a food tray. \n24  56.  Were she not involved in Washington State’s criminal justice system, Ms. \n25  Badayos would be in a community-based in-patient professional mental health facility \n26   \n13 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 14 of 18\n \n \n1  receiving treatment, pursuant to the civil commitment order.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n2 \n3 \n57.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate all allegations contained in the preceding \n4 \nparagraphs for purposes of the following causes of action. \n5 \n58.  Plaintiffs, Ms. Badayos, and all similarly situated persons have no complete \n6 \nand adequate remedy at law.  \n7 \n59.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of Ms. Badayos and all similarly situated persons, assert \n8 \nthe following causes of action: \n9 \n \n10 \nVIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n11 \n60.  Due process under the federal and state constitutions require that the \n12 \nnature and duration of confinement bear reasonable relation to the purpose for which the \n13 \nindividual is committed.  \n14 \n61.  Once Ms. Badayos and similarly situated persons are found to be legally \n15 \nincompetent, the only lawful purpose for confinement is to attempt to restore legal \n16 \ncompetency.   \n17 \n62.  Delay in transportation and treatment delays Ms. Badayos’s return to court, \n18 \nwhen requests to reduce bail (if her competence is restored) or to dismiss criminal charge \n19 \n(if she is not restorable) could be made. \n20 \n63.  Legally incompetent individuals have a constitutional right to individualized \n21 \ntreatment to provide a realistic opportunity to be cured or to improve their mental \n22 \ncondition. \n23 \n64.  County jails do not have the capacity to provide the restorative mental \n24 \nhealth treatment required by the State and Federal Constitution. \n25 \n65.  Defendants’ acts and omission done under color of law directly and \n26   \n14 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 15 of 18\n \n \n1  proximately caused unnecessarily extended confinement, additional injury to the mental \n2  state of these individuals, and violation of the constitutional rights to physical freedom and \n3  medical treatment.   \n4  66.  Federal and state constitutions and related laws guarantee the right to a fair \n5  and speedy trial.  \n6  67.  Defendants’ willful acts and omissions done under color of law directly and \n7  proximately caused unnecessary delay to an otherwise speedy trial process, harmful \n8  delay in interviewing witnesses and preparing an adequate defense, and violation the \n9  constitutional rights to a speedy and fair trial.  \n10   \n11  VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION \n12  68.  Federal and state Constitutions guarantee equal protection of the law, free \n13  from discrimination.  \n14  69.  Ms. Badayos and similarly situated individuals are members of a protected \n15  class of individuals who suffer from mental illness.  \n16  70.  Ms. Badayos and similarly situated individuals are incarcerated while \n17  awaiting lengthy delays in admission to WSH.  \n18  71.  Unlike other criminal defendants who may be held pretrial pursuant to a bail \n19  setting order while awaiting trial, Ms. Badayos and similarly situated individuals are being \n20  held without a speedy trial date, without the ability to consult with counsel, and without the \n21  constitutionally mandated medical regime to restore them to competency. Because of her \n22  mental illness, Ms. Badayos is being held at the jail.  \n23  72.  Defendants’ willful acts and omissions done under color of law directly and \n24  proximately caused unnecessary incarceration because of Ms. Badayos mental illness \n25  and lack of capacity.  \n26   \n15 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 16 of 18\n \n \n1   \n2  CRUEL AND UNUSAL PUNISHMENT \n3  73.  Federal and state Constitutions guarantee freedom from cruel and unusual \n4  punishment.  \n5  74.  Defendants knew or should have known that legally incompetent persons \n6  remanded to their custody were temporarily housed in county jails, and knew or should \n7  have known that such institutions do not maintain staff or facilities qualified or adequate to \n8  provide mental health care and restorative treatment for such persons. \n9  75.  Because Ms. Badayos is going without treatment, her mental health is \n10  further deteriorating. The additional damage to her mental state will likely require \n11  additional detention time to accomplish restoration. \n12  76.  Incarcerating Ms. Badayos for an indefinite period of time without essential \n13  psychotropic medication is a form of cruel and unusual punishment.  \n14   \n15  AFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL \n16  77.  Plaintiff SCPDA is constitutionally and contractually mandated to provide \n17  affective assistance of counsel to all indigent defendants to whom they are appointed.  \n18  78.  To provide affective assistance of counsel within state-mandated and \n19  contractual guidelines, SCPDA monitors the number of clients assigned to individual \n20  attorneys, represents individuals in court in pretrial, trial, and post-trial proceedings.  \n21  79.  In the last 10 months SCPDA attorneys have filed numerous motions \n22  seeking Defendants’ compliance with court orders and the constitution. These motions \n23  have resulted in extensive hours of work and litigation above and beyond the attorneys’ \n24  normal workloads. Every hour devoted to Ms. Badayos and similarly situated individuals \n25  is time taken from other clients who the agency is contractually and constitutionally bound \n26   \n16 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 17 of 18\n \n \n1  to represent in an affective manner. \n2  80.  Defendants’ willful and continued acts and omissions done under color of \n3  law directly and proximately caused a surge in hours worked by attorneys seeking \n4  compliance by Defendants on behalf of their clients. This surge frustrates the agency’s \n5  mission to affectively assist other clients.  \n6   \n7   \n8  JURY DEMAND \n9  81.  Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a jury trial is \n10  demanded on all causes of action. \n11   \n12  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs, on behalf of Ms. Badayos, and all similarly situated \n14  persons, respectfully request this Court to enter judgment against Defendants and grant \n15  the following relief: \n16  A.  Temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief requiring \n17  Defendants to promptly transport and treat Ms. Badayos and all other similarly situated \n18  persons to WSH or another adequate professional mental health treatment facility within \n19  a reasonable period of time, but no more than seven (7) days; \n20  B.  Issue declaratory judgment that Defendants must comply with constitutional \n21  requirements by transporting and treating Ms. Badayos and similarly situated individuals \n22  within a reasonable time after entry of an order to restore, but no more than seven (7) \n23  days; \n24  C.  Award nominal money damages in the amount of $1;  \n25  D.  Award reasonable attorneys fees and costs, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988; \n26   \n17 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n \n\nCase 2:14-cv-01178-MJP   Document 1   Filed 08/04/14   Page 18 of 18\n \n \n1  and \n2  E.  All such other relief as this honorable Court deems just and proper. \n3   \n4  This ___ day of August, 2014. \n5   \n6   \n7   \n8  ________________________________ \nBraden Cyrus Pence, WSBA# 43495 \n9 \nSnohomish County Public Defender Association \n2722 Colby Avenue, Ste. 200 \n10 \nATTORNEY FOR PLAINTIFFS  \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26   \n18 - COMPLAINT \n27 \n28 \n ",
