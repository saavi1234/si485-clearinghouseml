On January 10, 2005, Protection and Advocacy System, Inc., Wyoming&rsquo;s P&amp;A, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming. The Wyoming P&amp;A filed suit against David Freudenthal in his official capacity as Wyoming&rsquo;s Governor. Represented by Gagley, Karpan, Rose &amp; White, Wyoming P&amp;A alleged that defendants violated the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals With Mental Illness (PAIMI) Act and the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights (DD) Act when they limited the P&amp;A&rsquo;s facilities access and claimed that HIPAA and Medicaid requirements prevented defendants from disclosing records. Judge Alan B. Johnson presided over this matter.</p>\r\n<p>Wyoming P&amp;A initially filed this lawsuit through associational standing, alleging injuries on behalf of its members, and through organizational standing, alleging harm to the P&amp;A itself because defendants denied them records access under the PAIMI Act. On April 25, 2005, the court granted Freudenthal&rsquo;s Motion to Dismiss on the associational standing claims, but allowed the organizational standing claims on records access to proceed. In January 6 2006, the court found that the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Medicaid confidentiality provision did not bar defendants from providing the P&amp;A records under the PAIMI and DD Acts. The court required that the parties reach an agreement on protocol for the P&amp;A to access records. The settlement defined reasonable access to facilities for monitoring as 8:00 A.M.-5:00 P.M. from Monday-Friday. The settlement used the DD Act guidelines for records access under the PAIMI Act, which require the facility provide the P&amp;A records or to explain why the facility cannot provide the records within 3 business days of the records request. The case closed following the January 6, 2006 settlement.</p>",

Defendants raise the issue of the extent to which HIPAA and the Medicaid Act affect \nthe disclosure requirements in the P&A acts. These concerns create a live case or controversy, as \ndistinguished from the recent protection and advocacy case of Disabilitv Law Center v. Millcreek \nHealth Center et al, No. 04-4268 (10'  Cir. Slip Op. of November 10,2005). \nThe Court holds that neither HIPAA nor the Medicaid Act bars the Plaintiff from \naccessing records at the Wyoming State Hospital and the Wyoming State Training School as long \nas the disclosure is required by a P&A act and P&A complies with all requirements set forth in \nthe P&A act.  The Court further holds that the access agreement (attached as Appendix A) \ncomplies with all current applicable laws. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nI. THE PARTIES \nThe P&A acts authorize creation in each state of a protection and advocacy system for \npersons with certain disabilities. Understanding the genesis of the protection and advocacy \nsystems is helpful to resolution of this case. \n\nIn response to the \"inhumane and despicable conditions\" discovered at a New York \ninstitution for persons with developmental disabilities, Congress enacted the DD Act to protect \nthe civil rights of this vulnerable population.  Pursuant to the Act, a state cannot receive federal \nfunds for services to persons with developmental disabilities unless it has established a protection \nand advocacy system. Alabama Disabilities Advocacv P r o m v . J.S. Tarwater Develo~ment \nw, \n97 F. 3d 492,495 (1 1\" Cir. 1996). \nFollowing hearings in 1985 to examine the care and treatment of persons with mental \nillness who were residents of institutions, Congress in 1986 enacted the PAlMl Act to \"assure the \nconstitutional and statutory rights of the mentally ill are protected and to assure investigation of \nabuse and neglect.\"  Robbii v. Budke, 739 F. Supp. 1479, 1481 (D.N.M. 1990). \nPlaintiff Protection & Advocacy System, Inc., (hereinafter, \"P&An), is the designated \nsystem in Wyoming.  The PAlMI Act applies to persons with mental illness, and the DD Act \napplies to persons with developmental disabilities. The Protection and Advocacy of Individual \nRights Program (\"PAIR\") was created by Congress in an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973 and is codified at 29 U.S.C.$794e.  PAIR applies to persons with disabilities who do not \nhave a developmental disability and are not persons with mental illness. \nThese acts and their implementing regulations authorize P&A to investigate allegations \nof abuse and neglect; to monitor; to provide training on rights and make referrals and to pursue \nlegal, administrative and other remedies. They also authorize P&A to obtain access to records \n\nunder specific circumstances. \nThe PAlMl Act and DD Act have slightly different access provisions. The PAlR Act \nauthorizes P&A to have the same access rights as the DD Act. 29 U.S.C. §794e(f)(l)-(2); h a  \nProtection and Advocacv Services. Inc. v. Res-Care Premium. Inc. No. 4-02-CV-10112 (S.D. \na \nlowa 2002) and \nHartford Board of Education, 355 F. Supp. 2d 649 at 657-658 (D. Conn. 2005). \nThe Wyoming State Hospital (hereinafter, \"State Hospital\") is a state institution which \nwas established in 1886. It is the only publicly funded, psychiatric inpatient facility in the State. \nThe State Hospital is an agency within the Wyoming Department of Health, and is a \"covered \nentity,\"  as that term is defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n(hereinafter, \"HIPAA\"), 42 U.S.C. 51320d. \nThe Wyoming State Training School (hereinafter, \"State Training School\") is a state \ninstitution which was opened in 1912, originally as an inpatient facility for persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities. The State Training School continues to serve individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities. It also provides support and services to individuals who are dually \ndiagnosed with developmental disabilities and mental illness. The State Training School also \nprovides inpatient services for persons with traumatic brain injuries. The State Training School \nis an agency within the Wyoming Department of Health and is a \"covered entity,\" as that term is \n\ndefined in HIPAA.  The Wyoming Medicaid program pays for services to some of the patients \nof the State Training School. \n11. ISSUES \nThe parties agree that the P&A acts authorize P&A to obtain patient and other records \nfrom the State Hospital and State Training School in certain circumstances. However, \nDefendants question the extent to which HIPAA and the Medicaid Act affect those rights of \naccess. Thus, the parties have asked the Court to rule on the interplay between the P&A acts, \nwhich confer a right to access patient records under certain circumstances, and HIPPA and the \nMedicaid Act, which safeguard protected health information. The parties, through negotiations, \nhave established a mutually acceptable access agreement (Appendix A), but it cannot be \nimplemented if HIPAA or the Medicaid Act bar disclosure of the records to P&A. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nThe issue of PtA's access to records requires the Court to consider other federal statutes \nwhich impose confidentiality requirements to protect individual records.  The requirements \nregarding access and confidentiality rights relevant to this case are set forth in the PAIMI, DD \nand PAIR acts; in HIPAA, 42 U.S.C. 51320d to d-8; and in the federal Medicaid confidential \ndata standards, as established by §1902(a)(7) of the Social Security Act (hereinafter, \n\"Medicaid\"), 42 U.S.C. §1396a(a)(7). \n\nI.  RELEVANT ACCESS AND CONFIDENTIALITY LAWS \nA.  P&A Statutes on Access to Records \nIn order for P&A to carry out its statutory mandate to investigate allegations of abuse and \nneglect and to pursue appropriate administrative, legal and other remedies, it is critical that P&A \nbe able to obtain access to facilities, residents, staff and records as provided under the acts.  As \nthe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals said with regard to the DD Act, \"[Ilt is clear the Act \nprovides express authority for P&A1s to gain broad access to records, facilities and residents to \nensure that the Act's mandates can be effectively pursued.\" Alabama Disabilities Advocacy \nm, \nProeram v. J.S. Tanvater Develooment Center,  at 97 F. 3d 497, citing Mississiooi \nProtection and Advocacy System. Inc. v. Cotten, 929 F. 2d 1054,1058-59 (SLhC ir. 1991) \n(facilities have an affirmative duty to implement policies and practices which promote effective \nP&A access); Robbins v. Budke, 739 F. Supp. 1479, 1485-1489 (P&A's must have meaningful \naccess to carry out their protection mandate). \nThe DD Act applies to persons with developmental disabilities, as defined at 42 U.S.C. \n§15002(8). It authorizes disclosure of individual patient records to P&A at 42 U.S.C. \n4 15043(a)(2)(1), which specifically provides for access in the following circumstances: \n(i) any individual with a developmental disability who is \n- \na client of the system if such individual. or the leeal \nguardian, conservator, or other legal representative of such \nindividual, has authorized the system to have such access; \n\n(ii) any individual with a developmental disability, in a \nsituation in which- \n(I) the individual, by reason of such individual's \nmental or physical condition, is unable to \nauthorize the system to have such access; \n(11) the individual does not have a legal guardian, \nconservator, or other legal representative, or the \nlegal guardian of the individual is the State; and \n(111) a complaint has been received by the system \nabout the individual with regard to the status or \ntreatment of the individual or. as a result of \nmonitoring or other activities, there is probable \ncause to believe that such individual has been \nsubject to abuse or neglect; and \n(iii) any individual with a developmental disability in a situation \nin which- \n(I) the individual has a legal guardian, conservator, or other \nlegal representative; \n(11) a complaint has been received by the system about the \nindividual with regard to the status or treatment of the \nindividual or, as a result of monitoring or other activities, \nthere is probable cause to believe that such individual has \nbeen subject to abuse or neglect; \n(111) such representative has been contacted by such system, \nupon receipt of the name and address of such representative; \n(N) such representative has failed or refused to act on \nbehalf of the individual. \n\nIn addition, the DD Act also authorizes disclosure of individual patient records to P&A at \n42 U.S.C. §15043(a)(2)(J) as follows: \n(i) have access to the records of individuals described in \nsubparagraphs (B) and (I), and other records that are \nrelevant to conducting an investigation, under the \ncircumstances described in those subparagraphs, not \nlater than 3 business days after the system makes a \nwritten request for the records involved; and \n(ii) have immediate access, not later than 24 hours after \nthe system makes such a request, to the records without \nconsent from another party, in a situation in which services: \nsupports and other assistance are provided to an individual \nwith a developmental disability- \n(I) if the system determined there is probable cause to \nbelieve that the health or safety of the individual is in \nserious and immediate jeopardy; or \n(11) in any case of death of an individual with a \ndevelopmental disability. \nThe DD regulations at 45 C.F.R. 81386.22 provide M e r e xamples of the records which P&A \nis authorized to obtain. \nThe PAIMI Act applies to persons with mental illness, as defined at 42 U.S.C. §10802(4). \nIt specifically provides at 42 U.S.C.  §10805(a)(4) for access in the following circumstances: \n(A) any individual who is a client of the system if such individual, \nor the legal guardian, conservator, or other legal representative of \nsuch individual, has authorized the system to have such access; \n(B) any individual (including an individual who has died or whose \nwhereabouts are unknown);-- \n\n(i) who by reason of the mental or physical condition of \nsuch individual is unable to authorize the system to have \nsuch access; \n(ii) who does not have a legal guardian, conservator, or \nother legal representative, or for whom the legal guardian \nis the State; and \n(iii) with respect to whom a complaint has been received \nby the system or with respect to whom as a result of \nmonitoring or other activities (either of which result \nfrom a complaint or other evidence) there is probable \ncause to believe that such individual has been subject \nto abuse or neglect; and \n(C) any individual with a mental illness, who has a legal guardian \nconservator or other legal representative, with respect to whom a \ncomplaint has been received by the system or with respect to \nwhom there is probable cause to believe the health or safety of the \nindividual is in serious and immediate jeopardy, whenever- \n(i) such representative has been contacted by such \nsystem upon receipt of the name and address of such \nrepresentative; \n(ii) such system has offered assistance to such \nrepresentative to resolve the situation; and \n(iii) such representative has failed or refused to act \non behalf of the individual; \nIn addition to individual patient records, the PAIMI Act also authorizes P&A to obtain \naccess to other \"records,\"  defined at 42 U.S.C. §10806@)(3)(A)t o include: \"reports prepared by \nany staff of a facility rendering care and treatment or reports prepared by an agency charged with \ninvestigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect and injury occurring at such facility that \n\ndescribe incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury occurring at such facility and the steps taken to \ninvestigate such incidents, and discharge planning records.\"  The PAlMI regulations at 42 C.F.R. \n$5 1.4 1( c)(d) and (e) also address records which may be accessed. \nThe PAIR Act, 29 U.S.C. $794e, applies to persons with disabilities who are not eligible \nunder the DD Act, PAlMl Act, or P&A's Client Assistance Program, which is authorized by 29 \nU.S.C. $732. The PAIR Act grants P&A the same access rights as the DD Act.  29 U.S.C. \n$794e(f)(l)-(2).  Some patients at the State Hospital or State Training School may be eligible for \nservices under the PAIR statute. \nP&A is required to \"maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same extent as is \nrequired of the provider of such services.\" 42 U.S.C.  $10806(a), 42 C.F.R. $5 1.45, and 45 \nC.F.R. $1386.22(e), Robbins v. Budke, 739 F. Supp. 1479, 1488 (D.N.M. 1990), Pennsvlvania \nProtection and Advocacy. Inc. v. Houstoun, 228 F. 3d 423 at 427 (3rdC  ircuit 2000). \nB.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the \nMedicaid Act \nCongress enacted HIPAA, 42 U.S.C.  $1320d to d-8, in part, to address concerns about the \nconfidentiality of individually identifiable health information, particularly in an era of electronic \ncommunication. Effective as of April 14,2003, the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices, (hereinafter \"DHHS\"),  promulgated a Privacy Rule protecting all individually \nidentifiable health information held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate in \n\nany form or media.  The Privacy Rule calls this information \"protected health information.\" 45 \nC.F.R. $160.103. HIPAA defines terms and imposes requirements for exchanging health \ninformation and provides civil and criminal penalties for violations.  42 U.S.C. $ 1320d-5 to d-6. \nThe parties agree that both the State Hospital and State Training School, agencies within \nthe Wyoming Department of Health, are covered entities under HIPAA and the Privacy Rule, as \ndefined in the regulations at 45 C.F.R. $160.103. \nThe drafters of the Privacy Rule clearly anticipated its potential conflict with other \nfederal laws and addressed the issue in the preamble to the rule. The Court will consider the \ndrafters' comments at length, as an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to \nsubstantial deference. Wvominn Outdoor Council v. U.S. Forest Service, 165 F.3d 43,53 (D.C. \nCir. 1999), citing Thomas Jefferson Universitv v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504,512 (1994) and National \nTrust for Historic Preservation v. Dole, 828 F.2d 776,782 (D.C. Cir. 1987). \"[Tlhe agency's \nconstruction of its own regulation is controlling 'unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent \nwith the regulation.\"'  Wvomine Outdoor Council v U.S. Forest Service, yxa, at 165 F.3d 44, \nciting United States v. Larionoff, 431 U.S. 864,872 (1977) (quoting \n  , .Co  325 U.S. 410,414 (1945).) \nThe preamble to the Privacy Rule states, under the heading of \"Relationship to Other \nFederal Laws:\" \"[Clovered entities subject to these rules are also subject to other federal statutes \nand regulations.\"  Further, the preamble advised that \"covered entities will need to determine \n\nhow the privacy regulation will affect their ability to comply with other federal laws.\"  65 Fed. \nReg. 8248 1 (December 28,2000). \nThe Privacy Rule was intended to develop a procedure for handling protected health \ninformation and not to create or change substantive law, as indicated in the following statement \nin the preamble to the rule: \nMany apparent conflicts will not be true conflicts. \nFor example, if a conflict appears to exist because \na previous statute or regulation requires a specific \nuse or disclosure of protected health information \nthat the rules below appear to prohibit, the use or \ndisclosure pursuant to that statute or regulation \nwould not be a violation of the privacy regulation \n5 \nbecause  164.51 2(a) permits covered entities \nto use or disclose protected health information as \nrequired by law. \n65 Fed. Reg. 8248 1-82482 (December 28,2000). \nThe drafters did not intend the Privacy Rule to interfere with the operation of \nP&A acts where access to records is required, as illustrated in the following comment and \nresponse in the preamble: \nComment: One commenter urged HHS [Health and \nHuman Services] to ensure that the regulation would \nnot impede access to individually identifiable health \ninformation to entities that are part of the Protection \nand Advocacy System to investigate abuse and \nneglect as authorized by the Developmental \nDisabilities Bill of Rights Act. \n\nResponse: The Developmental Disabilities Assistance \nand Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (\"DD  Act\") mandates \nspecific disclosures of individually identifiable \nhealth information to Protection and Advocacy \nsystems designated by the chief elected official of the \nstates and territories. Therefore covered entities \nmay make these disclosures under 3 164.51 2(a) \nwithout first obtaining an individual's authorization, \nexcept in those circumstances in which the DD Act \nrequires the individual's authorization. Therefore, \nthe rules below will not impede the functioning of \nthe existing Protection and Advocacy System. \n65 Fed. Reg. 82594 (December 28,2000). \nThe Privacy Rule provision governing disclosures \"required by law\" is 45 \nC.F.R. §164.512(a)(l), which states as follows: \nA covered entity may use or disclose protected health \ninformation to the extent that such use or disclosure \nis required by law and the use or disclosure complies \nwith and is limited to the relevant requirements of \nlaw. \nDHHS has designated its Office of Civil Rights, (hereinafter \"OCR\"), as the agency to \nenforce the Privacy Rule.  OCR operates a web site on which it provides information and \nanswers to questions about the Privacy Rule. The web site reports the OCR was asked the \nfollowing question: \nMay a covered entity disclose protected health \ninformation to a Protection and Advocacy system \nwhere the disclosure is required by law? \n\nThe Oftice of Civil Rights responded, in the affirmative, stating, in part: \nYes. The Privacy Rule permits a covered entity to \ndisclose protected health information (PHI) \nwithout the authorization of the individual to a \nstate-designated Protection and Advocacy (PLA) \nsystem to the extent that such disclosure is \nrequired by law and the disclosure complies \nwith the requirements of that law. \nIn the case at hand, the Court has quoted extensively from the preamble to the Privacy \nRule because there is apparently only one case in which a court has considered the interplay \nbetween HIPAA and the PLA acts. The case is Ohio Leeal Riehts Service v. Buckeve Ranch. \nInc., \n365 F. Supp. 2d 877 (S.D. Ohio 2005).  Although the court based its decision on Ohio state \nlaw, the opinion is helpful for its interpretation of the HIPAA regulation on disclosures required \nby law.  45 C.F.R. §164.512(a). \nThe case involved two parallel investigations by Ohio Legal Rights Service (hereinafter, \n\"OLRS\"), a designated protection and advocacy system. In relevant part, OLRS was \ninvestigating the possible abuse of a 13-year old whose wrist was apparently fractured during a \nrestraint at Buckeye Ranch, a residential facility for children with mental illness. The Buckeye \nRanch refused PLA access to the records arguing that HIPAA prohibited it from disclosing the \nrecords and that Buckeye Ranch would face civil and criminal penalties if it released individually \n\nidentifiable health information. This is the same concern the State Hospital and State Training \nSchool have raised in this case. \nThe court found that the HIPAA Privacy Rule did not bar disclosure of records to P&A, \nbut that Buckeye Ranch acted appropriately in refusing to produce the records because P&A had \nnot asserted probable cause as required under the PAIMI Act: \nThe Court is certainly aware of OLRS's important mission \nof defending mentally ill individuals from abuse and \nneglect.  Nonetheless, OLRS's requests for the seclusion \nand restraint logs were not based on a finding of probable \ncause...  Buckeye Ranch cannot be faulted for refusing to \nproduce the logs when it did not know OLRS had probable \ncause to believe that incidents of abuse and neglect had \noccurred. Ih, \nIn addressing the Privacy Rule's \"required by law\" provision at 45 C.F.R. §164.512(a)(l), \nthe court stated: \nSubparagraph (I) is an exception that stands on \nits own, allowing a covered entity to make a \ndisclosure otherwise prohibited by HIPAA if \nthat disclosure is required by another law.  In \ndisclosing the information, the covered entity \nmust simply comply with the requirements of \nthe other law-HIPAA  imposes no further \nconditions. \nOhio Legal Riphts Service v. Buckeve Ranch, Inc.,  at 365 F. Supp. 2d 886. \nThe court supported its interpretation of the Privacy Rule provision by quoting from the \ncommentary to the HIPAA rule, stating in part: \n\nA reading of the final commentary accompanying the HIPAA \nregulations confirms that the Court's interpretation is correct. \nThe commentary notes that the phrase 'required by law' is \nintended to be read broadly to include the full array of binding \nlegal authority, such as constitutions, statutes, tules, \n.... \nregulations  It encompasses federal, state or local actions \nwith legally binding effect .... \n65 Fed. Reg. 82462,82668.' \nId. \nOhio Lead Riahts Service,  at 365 F. Supp. 2d 886. \nIn the case at hand, the Court, in interpreting 45 C.F.R. 5 164.5 12(a)(l), adopts the \nm. \nreasoning of DHHS and of the court in Ohio Lena1 Riehts Service v. Buckeve Ranch. Inc., \nAccordingly, the Court specifically finds as a matter of law that the HIPAA Privacy Rule does \nnot bar the State Hospital and State Training School from disclosing \"protected health \ninformation\" without the authorization of the individual to P&A if such disclosure is required by \na P&A act, and that P&A complies with the requirements set forth in the act. \nMedicaid is a program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and \nfamilies with low incomes and resources. The program became law in 1965 and is jointly funded \nby the federal and state governments to assist states in providing assistance for long-term medical \ncare to people who meet certain eligibility criteria. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for \nmedical and health-related services for people with limited income. \nThe federal Medicaid confidential data standard, as established by §1902(a)(7) of the \nSocial Security Act (Medicaid), contains requirements for disclosure of records. 42 U.S.C. \n\n$1396a(a)(7). Records may be released pursuant to 42 C.F.R. $43 1.302 for purposes which are \ndirectly related to State plan administration, including: \n(a) Establishing eligibility; \n- \nI.b .l  Determining the amount of medical assistance: \n(c) Providing services for recipients; and \n(d) Conductin-g  or assistin-g  an investigation, \n- \nprosecution, or civil or criminal proceeding \nrelated to the plan. \nThe Wyoming State Medicaid program pays for services to some patients at the State \nTraining School. The Wyoming State Medicaid program considers a request from P&A for \nrecords as falling withiin subsection (d) of $431.302 because it regards P&A as investigating \nwhether or not the facility provided adequate services or adequate safeguards for its clients. \nThe Court adopts the Wyoming State Medicaid interpretation of 42 C.F.R. $43 1.302(d). \nAccordingly, the Court specifically finds as a matter of law that the State Hospital and the State \nTraining School do not violate the confidentiality provisions of the Medicaid act and regulations \nby disclosing records to P&A so long as the discloswe is authorized by a P&A act, and the \nrequirements for disclosures are met. \n11.  DlSCLOSURE OF RECORDS \nThe parties have reached agreement on a protocol to govern P&A's access to records of \nthe State Hospital and State Training School. (Appendix A.)  The DD Act at 42 U.S.C. \n$15043(a)(Z)(B) grants P&A \"authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of \nindividuals with developmental disabilities if the incidents are reported to the system or if there \n\nis probable cause to believe the incidents occurred.\"  The PAIMI Act at 42 U.S.C. \n5 10805(a)(l)(A) grants P&A \"authority to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of \nindividuals with mental illness if the incidents are reported to the system or if there is probable \ncause to believe the incidents occurred.\" \nIn its investigation of alleged abuse and neglect,  P&A is entitled to access a broad range \nof records. The DD Act and its implementing regulations authorize access at 42 U.S.C. \n$15043(c) and 45 C.F.R. $1386.22; these provisions apply as well to requests under the PAIR \nAct.  29 U.S.C. §794e(f)(l)-(2).  The PAIMI Act and its implementing regulations authorize \naccess to records at 42 U.S.C. $10805(a)(l)(A) and 42 C.F.R. $51.41. \nThe DD and PAIMI acts delineate the circumstances under which P&A is authorized to \nobtain individual patient records. 42 U.S.C. $15043(a)(2)(l)(i) and 42 U.S.C.  $10805(a)(4)(A). \nAs the statutes provide, P&A sometimes requests records on the basis of probable cause \nto believe that a person with a disability has been subjected to abuse or neglect. The law is well \nestablished that in requesting records, P&A makes the decision as to whether probable cause \nexists. As the court stated in a 2003 case in Connecticut: \n... \nit is now a settled principle that the P&A \nis the 'final arbiter of probable cause for \ntriggering its authority to access all records \nfor an individual that may have been subject \nto abuse or neglect.' Arizona Center for \nDisabilitv Law v. Allm, 197 F.R.D. 689,693 \n(D. Ariz. 2000).  Such a position has been \noverwhelmingly agreed with by other courts. \n\nSee:%, Earnest, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 1257; \n(D. Co. 2002), reversed on other erounds, \n320 F. 3d 1107 (10\" Cir. 20031 Jtamussen, \n206 F.R.D. 630,2001 WL 1809404; Gerard \nTreatment Pronrams. LLC, 152 F. Supp. 2d at \n1159; J.S. Tarwater Develooment Ctr, 97 \nF. 3d at 428-29; Mt Washinnton Pediatric \nHosoital.lnc.,  106 Md. App. 55,664 A. 2d \n16 (1995). \nOffice of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Armstrong, 266 F. Supp. 2d \n303,3 18 (D. Corn. 2003). \nP&A is entitled to access an individual's records upon a finding of probable cause so long \nas the other requirements set forth at 42 U.S.C.$15043(a)(2)(I)(ii) and (iii); 42 U.S.C.§15043 \n(a)(Z)(J)(ii)(I) and (11); or 42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(4)(B) or (C) are met. \nWhere a release of records is specifically allowed under the PAIMI or DD acts, HIPAA \ndoes not bar disclosure since such records are produced based on the \"as required by law\" \nexception to HIPAA. If there is no probable cause, HIPAA would prohibit facilities from \ndisclosing incident reports that contain protected health information without the authorization of \nthe individual. \nThe primary purpose of HIPAA's Privacy Rule is to safeguard the privacy of medical \nprotected health information. However, these incident reports contain information which can be \nhelpful to P&A in monitoring compliance with patients' rights and in determining whether there \nis probable cause to believe that abuse or neglect has occwed. The analysis of the release of the \n\nincident reports must take into account these different interests.  The Court finds that the purpose \nof all statutes can be met by providing the incident reports to P&A with names and identifying \ninformation redacted. \nIf P&A, after its review of the reports, determines there is probable cause to believe that a \npatient has been subject to abuse or neglect or that the health or safety of the individual is in \nserious or immediate jeopardy, it can make an appropriate request for more information. The \nState Hospital can then provide an unredacted report pursuant to 42 C.F.R. $5 1.41(~)(2)(1): \n(2) Reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating \nabuse, neglect, or injury occurring at a facility rendering care \nor treatment, or by or for a facility itself, that describe any of \nthe following: \n(i) Abuse, neglect or injury occurring at the facility. \nThe State Training School can then provide an unredacted report pursuant to 45 \n(2) Reports prepared by an agency charged with investigating \nincidents of abuse or neglect, injury or death occurring in the \nfacility or while the individual with a developmental disability \nis under the care of a member of the staff of a facility, or by \nsuch a facility that describe any or all of the following: \n(i) Abuse, neglect, injury or death; \nP&A can then proceed with the requirements set forth in 42 U.S.C. §10805(a)(4) and 42 \nU.S.C.  51 5043(a)(2)(1) or (J). \n\nThe Court specifically finds that this protocol for disclosing incident reports does not \nviolate the HIPAA Privacy Rule or the Medicaid regulations on confidentiality. \nThe DD Act at 42 U.S.C. $ 15043(a)(2)(1) requires P&A to have access to records no \nlater than three business days after it makes a written request, but that P&A shall have immediate \naccess, no later than twenty-fow hours after it makes a request without consent from another \nparty, if P&A determines there is probable cause to believe the \"health or safety of the individual \nis in serious or immediate jeopardy\" or in any case of death of a person with a developmental \ndisability. \nNeither the PAIMI Act nor its regulations establishes specific deadlines for production \nof records. The PAIMI regulations at 42 C.F.R. $5 1.4 1(a) merely say, \"[A]ccess to records shall \nbe extended promptly to all authorized agents of a P&A system.\" \nThe Court fmds that the parties may use the deadlines in the DD Act as a guideline for \nrequests under the PAIMI Act, but, this approach should reflect a good faith analysis of the \nnature and extent of the request. A narrow request for a small number of records should not \nrequire the full three days allowed under DD Act, while a very broad and time intensive request \nshould be allowed some leeway. \nThe Court finds that the access agreement complies with the current and controlling law \nand will be the authoritative and enforceable document regarding P&A's access to information \nand records at the State Hospital and State Training School until or unless the laws and \n\ncontrolling legal precedents change. If the relevant laws are amended, additional relevant laws \nare passed, or controlling case law deems any provision illegal, the parties will revise the access \nagreement accordingly. \nORDER \nWHEREFORE, THE COURT ORDERS: \n1. The HIPAA Privacy Rule does not bar the State Hospital or State Training School \nfrom disclosing \"protected health information\" without the authorization of the individual to \nP&A so long as the disclosure is required by a P&A act and P&A meets all requirements under \nthe act. \n2.  The Medicaid confidentiality provision does not bar the State Hospital or State \nTraining School from disclosing records to P&A so long as the disclosure is authorized by a \nP&A act and P&A meets all requirements under the act. \n3.  The process set forth in this Order and the Access Agreement shall govern the \nrelease of records to P&A subject to changes in applicable laws. \n4.  As the parties have resolved the main substantive issue in this case and have \ninformed this Court that they no longer wish to pursue residual issues in this case, the Plaintiffs \ncase for retaliation is dismissed with prejudice and the Defendant's claim for copying costs is \ndismissed with prejudice. \n\n5. The above-captioned case is dismissed with prejudice and each party shall bear its \nown costs and fees. \nDATEDthis  ?/dayof \n-<&z7r/\" \nUnited States District Court Judge \n; \nPatric  J.  rank \nAttorney General \n&A \nl1=zzZs- \nMisha Westby \nSenior Assistant Attorney General \n*L \nb h \" %  \nKathleen M.

The facilities will use the deadlines in the \nDD Act as a guideline for requests under the PAlMl Act, but this approach should \nreflect a good faith analysis of the nature and extent of the request.  A narrow \nrequest for a small number of records should not require the full three days \nallowed under the DD Act, while a very broad and time intensive request should \nbe allowed some leeway. \nC.  Procedure for Requesting Records: \n1. In order to access records, P&A will make a written request to the facility \nsuperintendent or hisher designee, which request shall reasonably identify the patient \nand/or institutional records being sought.

P&A will have reasonable access to review records on site, in accordance with the \ncriteria set forth in sections 3.A.1 and 3.A.2. Under no circumstances will P&A remove \nany part of the original record or make any changes to it. \n2.  P&A will maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same extent as \nrequired of the facilities by the laws of both the State of Wyoming and the United \nStates of America. \n3.  At the same time access to records is granted, the mental health professional \nresponsible for supervising mental health services to the patient may give P&A a \nwritten determination that the disclosure of the information to the patient would be \ndetrimental to the patient's health.  In that case, in accordance with federal regulations, \nP&A will not disclose the information to the patient unless another mental health \nprofessional determines that disclosure would not be detrimental to the patient's health. \n4.  The facilities will provide space for P&A to set up its own copier or scanner on site. \nFacilities will not charge P&A for the space they provide or for copies made on \nP&A's copier or scanner. In those instances in which P&A uses the facility copier, P&A \nwill pay five cents a page. \n\n5.  If the facility denies access to records, the facility superintendent or designee will give \nP&A a written explanation for the denial. The written explanation shall be provided to \nP&A within two business days after the expiration of the deadline for the release of \nrecords, as established in Section 3.B above. \nE.  Incident Reports: \n1. On a regular basis, the facilities will give P&A copies of all incident reports, with the \npatient's name redacted. After reviewing the redacted incident reports, P&A may \ndetermine that probable cause exists to investigate. If so, P&A will request a copy \nof the unredacted report in order to obtain the patient's name.  At that time, the facility \nwill also give P&A contact information for the patient or for the patient's guardian, \nconservator or legal representative. \nSection 4: Coooerative Efforts \nA.  Information on Contacting P&A: \n1. The facilities agree to distribute and post P&A informational brochures and other \nwritten materials on its senices, activities, and scheduled events. \n2. P&A will pay for and provide informational material on its programs for \ndistribution to patients, family members, guardians and other legally authorized \nrepresentatives of patients. \n\n3. The facilities agree to post the toll free P&A telephone number near each public \ntelephone in its facility. \nB.  Policies and Procedures Made Available: \nUpon request, P&A will provide the facility with a copy of its policies and procedures \nformulated pursuant to P&A statutes and regulations. Upon request, the facilities will \nprovide P&A with copies of their policies and procedures. \nC. Training Sessions on Client Rigbts: \n1. The facilities will schedule periodic meetings at the facility for P&A to present \ntraining sessions on client rights and responsibilities and to hear patient concerns. \nFacility staff may attend the classes. \n2. As its resources allow, P&A may also train facility staff on client rights and \nresponsibilities and may sponsor educational seminars by experts in the field. \nD. Training Sessions on the Access Agreement: \n1. The parties may sponsor joint training sessions on this Access Agreement to be \nattended by both PLA and facility staff. \nE.  Dispute Resolution: \nThe parties mutually agree to resolve disputes whenever possible through non- \nadversarial means, including negotiation, mediation or conciliation. Any complaint \nwill be immediately brought to the attention of the facility superintendent and the \n\nexecutive director of P&A to resolve as expeditiously and informally as possible and at \nthe lowest appropriate level.  If they cannot resolve the dispute, it will be referred to the \nDirector of the Wyoming Department of Health. If the dispute is not resolved within a \nreasonable time, the parties may pursue other remedies. \nSection 5: Modification of Aereement \nThis Agreement is effective from the date of the last signature, and it may at any time be \namended by mutual written agreement signed by the parties. \nSigned this  day of 3  2006. \nI O L , ~ ~  \nc s b A 3 - Q  \nON & ADVOCACY SYSTEM, INC. \nBy: Jeanne A.
