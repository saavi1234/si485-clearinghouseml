Upon his release from jail, he was ordered to wear and pay $11 a day for a Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM) bracelet. For his period of probation, it would mean approximately $18,000. It is not a Medicaid-covered device.  The defendant worked odd jobs and with the help of his mother, he was able to pay for five out of his first six months of probation. He was told by the probation officers that they could reduce the payment to $4 a day. However, the probationer could not afford to make any payments. The bracelet was removed, and probation was revoked because he was unable to pay. Probationer filed a complaint stating payment for the bracelet is punitive and does not promote public safety. The lower court held that he should not be required to pay.</p>",
