    "summary": "<p>This class action civil rights lawsuit alleged abuses at a New Hampshire youth detention center, the Youth Detention Center (YDC), in the 1990s. An alleged victim of that abuse filed this suit on January 11, 2021 against the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, YDC, the state Division of Juvenile Services, the state Division of Children, Youth, and Families, and hundreds of individual defendants. The plaintiff was represented by the private law firm Rilee &amp; Associates and the case was assigned to Justice John C. Kissinger, Jr. for the Superior Court of Merrimack County. Plaintiff's complaint described a series alleged systemic abuses involving rape, solitary confinement, and emotional abuse. Plaintiff, who experienced these alleged abused as a teenager, explained that he did not begin to connect the actions of individual abusers to the institution until 2017. The plaintiff alleged that employees of the YDC raped and physically assaulted juveniles for decades, and conspired to cover up the crimes.&nbsp;Plaintiff sought to represent a class of all other men and women who were survivors of abuse from YDC with claims of physical abuse, sexual abuse, mental or emotional abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of education.</p>\r\n<p>The complaint alleged violations of state and federal law. The state law claims included negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, and a violation of the right to education enshrined in the New Hampshire Constitution. The federal claims included violations of Title IX as well the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendment. The federal Constitutional claims were brought under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983.</p>\r\n<p>On May 25, 2021, Justice Kissinger ruled on defendants' motion to dismiss. He dismissed the complaint in part, including the class action, but his opinion left the door open for additional individual suits against YDC and its staff. Justice Kissinger reasoned that the putative class definition would make it impossible to identify class members and, even if they were identified, their varying damages would require too many mini-trials. Accordingly, the court likewise dismissed the class-based claims for civil conspiracy and the claims alleging Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment violations. Also, the court dismissed plaintiff's state constitutional claim alleging a violation of the right to education. On this point, Justice Kissinger explained that the right to education in New Hampshire was a public&mdash;not an individual&mdash;right and therefore was improper for tort claims.</p>\r\n<p>However, Judge Kissinger allowed the remaining claims to proceed on an individual basis. These claims included negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, a &sect; 1983 claim for failure to promulgate rules to prevent the alleged abuse, and the remaining federal claim of Title IX. Further, Justice Kissinger explained that statutes of limitations were not a bar to plaintiff's individual claims because the discovery rule applied. The court agreed with plaintiff that a child released from state custody after suffering years of abuse would likely not understand the abuse or that it was caused by institutional failures.</p>\r\n<p>Since Justice Kissinger's May 25th ruling, several other alleged victims have brought individual suits against YDC with similar claims to plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing as of January 31, 2022.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2021, a former detainee of a youth detention center in New Hampshire filed this class action lawsuit alleging systemic rape and other abuse in the the Superior Court of Merrimack County, New Hampshire. The complaint argued that the alleged abuses violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Title IX, the New Hampshire Constitutional right to education, and various other state law claims. Later in 2021, Justice Kissinger granted in part defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiff's class action complaint and class-based claims were dismissed. However, the remaining individual claims—except the right to education claim, which was improper for a tort suit—could proceed. The case is on-going.",

These horrific acts of abuse were perpetrated by the very individuals who were \nlegally responsible for providing protection, care, guidance, rehabilitative, educational and other \nservices to children who had been committed to YDC pursuant to RSA 621, et seq.  These \nindividuals not only conspired to perpetrate horrific acts of abuse on these children who were in \ntheir care, custody, and control, but they then conspired to conceal these acts and their complicity \nin  and  knowledge  of  these  acts  from  outside  scrutiny.    As  if  that  weren’t  enough,  these \nindividuals deliberately intimidated and manipulated these children into believing that they had \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co no recourse and that no one would believe them.  Even when these children, sporting black eyes, \n.

This lawsuit seeks to hold the State of \nNew Hampshire and others responsible for the lives they forever destroyed and to bring about \nsystemic change so that this can never happen again to another child in New Hampshire. \n \n \n \n \n1 As of today’s date, undersigned counsel already represents thirty-five (35) other members of this putative class \nwith claims against not only these defendants, but against other individual perpetrators, who will be identified in \nlater court filings. \n2 \n \n\n \nPARTIES \n1.

Pursuant  to  N.H.  R.S.A.  491:7,  this  Honorable  Court  has  subject-matter \njurisdiction over this action because this is a civil action arising out of acts that occurred in the \nState of New Hampshire. \n16.  Pursuant to N.H. R.S.A. 507:9, this Honorable Court is a proper venue for this \naction because, at all times relevant to the specific allegations of negligence contained herein, the \ndefendants are residents of the County of Merrimack, State of New Hampshire. \n5 \n \n\n \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n17.  Plaintiff herein brings all claims as class claims on behalf of himself and the \nputative class (or subclass(es)2, as this Honorable Court may deem necessary) pursuant to N.H. \nSuper. Ct. R. 16 and the common law of the State of New Hampshire. \n18.  The putative class consists of both men and women who, while minors in the \ncare,  custody  and  control  of  the  defendants,  were  victims  of  physical,  sexual,  and \nmental/emotional abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of education at the hands of \ndefendants, their agents, employees, and/or contractors.  The plaintiff seeks certification of this \nputative class as an “opt out” class. \n19.  The class is so numerous that joinder of all members, whether otherwise \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co required or permitted is impracticable.  N.H. Super. Ct. R. 16(a)(1).  There are believed to be \n.

Even then, those statutes of limitations \nmay be further extended by the application of any number of legal principles, including the \n“discovery rule,” fraudulent concealment, equitable tolling, and defendant absence from the \njurisdiction.  As such, it would be impossible to identify and join all members of the putative \n \n2 Subclasses may include survivors with claims of (a) physical abuse, (b) sexual abuse, (c) mental/emotional abuse, \n(d) solitary confinement, and (e) deprivation of education. \n6 \n \n\n \nclass, and the only way to determine the number and identities of putative class members would \nbe  through  discovery  and  notice  to  those  putative  class  members.    As  of  today’s  date, \nundersigned counsel already represents thirty-five (35) other members of this putative class with \nclaims against not only these defendants, but other individual perpetrators, who will be identified \nin later court filings. \n20.  There are questions of law or fact common to the class which predominate \nover any questions affecting only individual members.  N.H. Super. Ct. R. 16(a)(2).  Those \ncommon mixed questions of law and fact include, inter alia, the following: \na.  Whether the “discovery rule” applies to toll the statute of limitations for claims of \nphysical abuse against the State defendants pursuant to RSA 508:4;  \nb.

Whether the “discovery rule” applies to toll the statute of limitations for claims of \ndeprivation of education against individual employees of the State defendants \npursuant to the New Hampshire Constitution, Part 2 Article 83;  \ni.  Whether the defendant’s absence from the jurisdiction applies to toll the statute of \nlimitations  for  claims  against  individual  employees  of  the  State  defendants \npursuant to RSA 508:9;  \nj.  Whether the common law doctrine of fraudulent concealment operates to toll the \nstatute of limitations against the State defendants; \nk.  Whether the common law doctrine of fraudulent concealment operates to toll the \nstatute of limitations against individual employees of the State defendants; \n7 \n \n\n \nl.  Whether the common law doctrine of equitable tolling operates to toll the statute \nof limitations against the State defendants; \nm. Whether the common law doctrine of equitable tolling operates to toll the statute \nof limitations against the individual employees of the State defendants; \nn.  Whether physical, sexual, and mental/emotional abuse of children while in the \ncustody of the State constitute violations of the class plaintiffs’ civil rights in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. §1983; \no.  Whether  solitary  confinement  of  children  while  in  the  custody  of  the  State \nconstitutes violations of the class plaintiffs’ civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \n§1983; and \np.  Whether physical, sexual, and mental/emotional abuse of children while in the \ncustody of the State deprived the class plaintiffs of their educational rights in \nviolation of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. 1681, et seq. \n \n21.  The claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class.  N.H. Super. Ct. R. 16(a)(3).  David’s claims are for physical abuse, sexual \nabuse,  mental/emotional  abuse,  solitary  confinement,  and  deprivation  of  education.    These \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co claims are typical of not only the other thirty-five (35) other putative class members who \n.

N.H.  Super.  Ct.  R.  16(a)(4).    David  has  overcome  feelings  of  fear,  shame,  and \n0\n6\nembarrassment to go public with his claims of abuse in order to shine a light on a broken juvenile \njustice system, bring forward public criminal charges to hold people accountable, and to bravely \ngive a voice to those who, for various reasons - all caused by the State - haven’t had the strength \nto do the same.  It is with his strength and courage that David will ensure that the interests of the \nclass, which are the same as his own, are protected at all costs. \n23.  A class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient \nadjudication of the controversy.  N.H. Super. Ct. R. 16(a)(5).  Because of the commonality \nregarding issues of liability, law and damages among the representative party and the class \n8 \n \n\n \nmembers, certification as a class action will provide for streamlined discovery, avoid repetitive \nand duplicative expert testimony, and overall promote judicial economy.  \n24.  Undersigned counsel for the representative party will adequately represent the \ninterests of the class.  N.H. Super. Ct. R. 16(a)(6).  Undersigned counsel is experienced in high-\nexposure, complex multi-party litigation, both inside and outside the State of New Hampshire, \nincluding claims involving sexual abuse, catastrophic injury, and death against governmental \nagencies and national and international corporations. \nALTERNATIVE TO FORMAL CLASS CERTIFICATION \n25.  Plaintiff herein bring all claims on behalf of himself and a group of claimants3 \nwith similar claims arising out of the same kinds of events and involving common issues of law \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co and/or fact as set forth in the previous paragraphs, hereby incorporated as though fully set forth \n. P& Associates, www.rilee8234   herein.  26.  Specifically, the claimants as a group consist of individuals who, while minors \ne 2.\ne3\nRil3.2 in the care, custody and control of the defendants, were victims of physical abuse, sexual abuse, \n0\n6\nmental/emotional abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of education at the hands of \ndefendants, their agents, employees, and/or contractors.   \n27.  Because it is likely that a class exists, David and the claimants would urge the \nCourt  to  proceed  as  though  they  were  a  putative  class  for  the  purposes  of  discovery, \nconsolidating all present and future claims by all plaintiffs in all courts in New Hampshire into \nthis Honorable Court, as this would provide for streamlined discovery, avoid repetitive and \nduplicative expert testimony, and overall promote judicial economy.   \n \n3 As of today’s date, undersigned counsel already represents thirty-five (35) other members of this putative class \nwith claims against not only these defendants, but against other individual perpetrators, who will be identified in \nlater court filings. \n \n9 \n \n\n \n28.  There are questions of law or fact common to this group of plaintiff and \nclaimants which predominate over any questions affecting only individual claimants.  Those \nmixed questions of law and fact include, inter alia, the following: \na.  Whether the “discovery rule” applies to toll the statute of limitations for claims of \nphysical abuse against the State defendants pursuant to RSA 508:4;  \nb.  Whether the “discovery rule” applies to toll the statute of limitations for claims of \nsexual abuse against the State defendants pursuant to RSA 508:4-g;  \nc.

These \nclaims are typical of not only the other thirty-five (35) claimants who undersigned counsel \ncurrently represents, but also of those likely to bring future claims.   \n30.  Because of the commonality regarding issues of liability, law and damages \namong all members of the group, proceeding as a putative class in these claims for the purposes \nof discovery will provide for streamlined discovery, avoid repetitive and duplicative expert \n m\nL.L..

David was born in 1981. \n33.  Starting in approximately fifth grade, David ran away from home multiple \ntimes in order to escape the toxic and abusive environment of his home.  Consequently, he was \noften homeless and living “on the street.” \n11 \n \n\n \n34.   During David’s episodic periods of homelessness, David met and became \ndependent on other homeless juveniles for companionship and protection.   \n35.  During  these  periods  of  homelessness,  David  committed  a  number  of \nburglaries in order to acquire the means to obtain food and shelter.  This led to his apprehension \nby the police on multiple occasions during 1995. \n36.   Finally, on December 1, 1995, when David was fourteen years old, David \nwas ordered committed to YDC by the Rochester, New Hampshire District Court.  The Court \nalso ordered that David “…have individualized counseling as soon as practicable.”   \n37.  New Hampshire Revised Statutes, 621:2, effective on June 30, 1981, sets forth \nthe purposes and policies of YDC:  \n m\nL.L..

To cooperate with the courts, law enforcement agencies, and other \nagencies in juvenile matters to ensure that the needs of each child who \nis involved with these agencies are met with minimum adverse impact \nupon the child; and \nVII. To return each child committed to the center to a community setting with \nan improved attitude toward society. \n \n38.  Even before David arrived at YDC, he had heard rumors about mistreatment \nof the residents including rapes and beatings.  Shortly before his commitment to YDC, in \nOctober 1995, David was being transported between the Rochester District Court and the Youth \nDetention  Services  Unit  (“YDSU”)  in  Concord,  New  Hampshire  by  the  Strafford  County \n12 \n \n\n \nSheriff’s Department.  There was another boy in the vehicle with him who was being transported \nbetween the Rochester District Court and YDC.  While they were in transit, the other boy told \nDavid that he and others were being raped and beaten at YDC and that no one would believe it.  \nDavid and this other boy, who were handcuffed, fled from the vehicle and remained on the run \nfor two weeks.  \n39.  When  David  was  first  admitted  to  YDC,  he  was  assigned  to  Spaulding \nCottage, one of the medium security “cottages” where juveniles committed to YDC to live. \n40.  Within  the  first  two  weeks  of  David’s  arrival  at  YDC,  David  witnessed \nanother YDC resident being called out of line and, when that resident initially refused to comply, \nDavid saw him dragged out of the line by Woodlock and Murphy.  The next time David saw that \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co resident, all of the blood vessels around his eyes were broken.  On information and belief, it was \n. P& Associates, www.rilee8234   Dbraovkiedn’ sb luonodde rvsetsasnedlisn. g that this young resident had been choked nearly to death, causing the \ne 2.\ne3\nRil3.2 41.  During most of 1996, David seemed to adjust well to life at YDC.  He visited \n0\n6\nhome regularly on scheduled furloughs and on information and belief and based upon the records \nin plaintiff’s possession, with the exception of one disciplinary action for failing to report the \npresence of smoking and cigarette lighters in the main kitchen, was not the subject of any \ndisciplinary action. \n42.  On or about June 26, 1996, David was sent home on an “Administrative \nrelease” for the summer months until August 9, 1996.  At the end of that time, David’s father \nreported that he did not want David to return home. \n43.  On August 9, 1996, upon revocation of his administrative release, David was \nreturned to YDC and placed directly at King Cottage, which was a “maximum security” cottage. \n13 \n \n\n \n44.  After Thanksgiving 1996, David did not return to King Cottage from his \nholiday visit home and was reported “AWOL” (Away Without Leave).  He was apprehended on \nDecember  12,  1996  and  that  day  was  sanctioned  with  a  ten-day  “Out  of  Community” \nconfinement.   \n45.  An  Out  Of  Community  (“OOC”)  confinement  was  equivalent  to  solitary \nconfinement.  During an OOC, the resident was confined alone in his room. \n46.  On information and belief, King Cottage was a higher security dormitory than \nEast Cottage.  At King Cottage, many if not all of the rooms were equipped with toilets and \nsinks, so when the residents were placed in OOC they were not taken out of their cells even to go \nto the bathroom. The only contact that residents of King Cottage had with others when they were \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co in OOC was when their meals were brought to them. \n.

These trips were included in the fifteen minutes.   \n48.  On information and belief, when a resident was confined to his cell in East \nCottage during OOC, the staff was required to do fifteen-minute checks on the resident, but often \nthe staff did not check on the resident for many hours but would sign the time-sheet as though \nthe checks had been done.  Consequently, there were times when residents who needed to use the \nbathroom would have to bang on the doors to get attention but were often unable to attract any \nnotice.  Consequently, residents who were in OOC would find themselves having to relieve \nthemselves on the floor because no one responded to their requests to be taken to the bathroom. \n14 \n \n\n \n49.  For example, on more than one occasion when David was confined on OOC, \nDavid had to urinate but no one responded when he banged on the door.  David finally had to \nrelieve himself by urinating on the floor.  He was then forced to clean up the puddle with the \nonly available object in the room—the clothing he was wearing.   \n50.  On information and belief, often when the resident was placed in OOC, the \nresident  was  not  permitted  to  attend  school  and  was  given  no  educational  instruction  or \n“makeup” lessons. \n51.  On information and belief, more often than not, during the school day, when \nthe other residents of East Cottage were taken by the staff to the school building, the residents \nwho were in OOC were brought to King Cottage and placed in cells there because King Cottage \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co was staffed even during the school day while the staff of East Cottage was at the school building \n. P& Associates, www.rilee8234   during s5c2h.o ol hourOs. n information and belief, when a resident was placed in OOC following a \ne 2.\ne3\nRil3.2 serious infraction, the resident’s cell would be stripped of everything but the mattress, a sheet \n0\n6\nand a bible, and the resident himself would be stripped to only his underwear.  The resident was \nsometimes permitted to have a pencil and paper for a few hours during the day.   \n53.  In early January 1997 David was disciplined again, once for disobeying a \nteacher and once for fighting with another YDC youth.  The second infraction resulted in David \nbeing sanctioned with ten days locked room confinement.   \n54.  On one occasion during the time that David was serving his time in Out Of \nCommunity confinement during this period of December 1996-January 1997, Davis entered his \nroom and told David that he was there to perform a contraband search.  He instructed David to \nundress.  Davis put a glove on his hand, picked up a tube of lubricant and told David to turn \n15 \n \n\n \naround.  David complied, believing that Davis was going to perform a digital cavity search.  \nInstead, Davis anally raped him.  When David felt Davis’ penis enter his rectum he turned his \nhead and saw another YDC employee, defendant Brown, at the door to the room, apparently \nstanding guard and preventing the door from closing and automatically locking.  This was the \nfirst time David was raped.  David contracted gonorrhea as a result of this rape, for which he was \ntreated by YDC staff.  David was fifteen years old. \n55.  On or about May 4, 1997 David was reported to have run from home during a \nfurlough.  He received ten days room confinement OOC. \n56.  By June 1997 David was living at East Cottage again.  \n57.  At East Cottage, David encountered Buskey, Murphy and Woodlock.  On \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co information and belief, Buskey was a counselor, Murphy was a counselor and Woodlock was a \n.

Buskey would give David special privileges, such as coveted work assignments and \n0\n6\naccess to snacks not given to the other boys.  With Buskey’s help, David was permitted to leave \nthe campus to play basketball with a local high school team.  David came to look upon Buskey \nas a father figure and as one of the few people who cared about him. \n59.  At the end of July 1997 David was accused of, and admitted to, planning to \nrun from the facility.  He was sanctioned with 10 days OOC.   \n60.  On or about September 11, 1997 David was sentenced to 10 days of room \nconfinement for fighting.  Shortly thereafter he was given 3 days OOC following an accusation \nthat he stole candy from someone’s locker. \n16 \n \n\n \n61.  Sometime after David moved to East Cottage and prior to Halloween 1997, \nBuskey told David that “I bet I can get you to break up with his girlfriend and suck my dick in \nthe same day.”  David assumed that he was joking around. \n62.  At that time, David’s girlfriend was a resident at the Nashua Children’s Home \nbut she was scheduled to be released at the end of October 1997. \n63.  In late October 1997 Buskey told David that David should break up with his \ngirlfriend, advising David that they were not good together.  Buskey told David that if he did not \nbreak up with his girlfriend, David would be denied any further furloughs.   \n64.  Buskey took David to the second floor central control area of East Cottage \nand had him place the call to his girlfriend, who at the time was still confined at the Nashua \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co Children’s Home.  After David ended the relationship, and while David was sobbing at Buskey’s \n.

Approximately a week later, early one morning he was surprised by Murphy, \nwho forced him to his knees and orally raped him.  David was visibly bruised during his futile \nefforts to resist the rape.  \n66.  Later that day, Buskey saw the bruises on David. When Buskey realized that \nthe bruises were a result of David’s struggles during his oral rape by Murphy, Buskey became \nangry and anally raped David for the first time.  This would also be the first time, but not the last \ntime, that David was raped by both Buskey and Murphy on the same day. \n17 \n \n\n \n67.  At some point after these two rapes, during October or November, Buskey \nforced David to watch while he sexually assaulted a female resident with whom David had \nbecome friendly.   \n68.  One of the privileges Buskey had secured for David was the privilege of being \nallowed to play basketball with a school team outside of YDC.  On one occasion, prior to \nbasketball practice, Buskey took David to his apartment.  While there, he took David to the \nbedroom of the apartment and showed him a gun, removed the magazine, and let David handle \nit.  When David returned the gun to Buskey, Buskey replaced the magazine, pulled back the \nslide, loading a bullet into the chamber, and then put the gun to David’s head while he forced \nDavid to perform oral sex.  During the rape, Buskey told David “Do not make a mess.  This time, \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co you clean up every last drop, or I will pull the trigger.” \n.

Although he was not \n0\n6\nevaluated for suicidality, during his time in confinement, he was placed on “suicide watch” and \nwas confined to his room dressed in only his underwear with only his mattress, a sheet and a \nbible. \n70.  Following  David’s  return  to  YDC  on  January  3,  1998,  David  began  to \nexperience almost constant physical, sexual and emotional abuse.   \n71.  On an almost daily basis, David was orally and/or anally raped by Buskey \nand/or Murphy, sometimes multiple times in one day.  During these rapes, the perpetrator would \noften beat him.  \n18 \n \n\n \n72.  During these times of OOC solitary confinement, when David was beaten and \nraped on an almost constant basis, he was not permitted to attend school, nor was he provided \nwith any alternative educational resources or opportunities.   \n73.  Woodlock  would  be  present  to  hold  the  door  open  so  that  it  would  not \nautomatically lock whenever he was raped by Murphy and he was present on many occasions \nwhen he was raped by Buskey.  Often Woodlock would help to hold David down, take off his \npants, and participate in the beatings.   \n74.  On February 6, 1998 David was sentenced again to 5 days Out Of Community \nfor “excessive horseplay” that resulted in physical contact. On or about April 18, 1998 David and \nanother resident were accused of planning to use another resident as a hostage as part of a plan to \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co escape from YDC.  David was sentenced to ten days of full room confinement. \n.

David was crying, his face was bruised, his \n0\n6\nnose was broken and he was covered in urine.  Nurse Jane remarked that it appeared that these \nwere self-inflicted injuries and departed.  \n76.  David assumed that Nurse Jane thought he was lying.  On information and \nbelief, no further inquiry was made into David’s allegations. \n77.  The next day, on or about April 21, 1998, when David’s food was brought to \nhim, he cursed at the individuals who brought the food and told them to “get the fuck out.”  \nDavid was sanctioned with an additional five days of confinement.  \n78.  During this time period in the winter-spring of 1998, during one of the times \nthat David was in OOC and had been brought from East Cottage to King Cottage, defendant \n19 \n \n\n \nSearles came into his cell.  David’s face was severely bruised, he had a black eye and a split lip.  \nSearles asked, in a jocular tone, what had happened, at which point David began to cry and told \nSearles that he had been beaten and raped.  Searles cut him off, responding “Look little fella, that \njust doesn’t happen.”  Then Searles left. \n79.  David assumed that Searles thought he was lying.  On information and belief, \nno further inquiry was made into David’s allegations. \n80.  On information and belief, at the time that David confided in Searles, Searles \nwas the House Leader of King Cottage. \n81.  In a Program Plan Review report dated June 18, 1998 it was noted that over \nthe prior two months David had been displaying a lot of anger. \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co 82.

A nurse was running over and Buskey was looking at him while telling the nurse \n0\n6\nthat David had suffered a “football injury.”  He was taken to Elliot Hospital where he was found \nto have suffered a groin injury. \n83.  On or about October 7, 1998 David was transferred from YDC to another \nfacility, Orion House. \n84.  Between approximately January 8, 1999 and January 14, 1999 David returned \nto YDC.  While at YDC, David participated in a group counseling activity led by Woodlock \nduring which David revealed to the group that he had been raped during his stay at YDC.  \nWoodlock  responded  that  this  was  untrue,  had  not  happened  and  that  David  had  simply \nmisunderstood events. \n20 \n \n\n \n85.  Later in 1999, David turned eighteen and was released from YDC’s custody.   \n86.  On information and belief, Murphy began residing outside of the State of New \nHampshire no later than October 2002. \n87.  On information and belief, Buskey began residing outside of the State of New \nHampshire no later than June 2008. \n88.  David felt tremendous shame as a result of the physical, sexual, and emotional \nabuse to which he had been subjected at YDC.  Thinking about the abuse he had suffered was \nitself traumatizing.  As a result, following his departure from YDC, David hid his history of \nabuse from others, including the same girlfriend Buskey made him break up with (now his wife \nand mother of his three (3) children) and made a conscious effort to put it out of his mind.

Inside his mind, he couldn’t find a place to rest. \n0\n6\n89.  As  a  consequence  of  the  physical  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  mental/emotional \nabuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of education that David and the putative class \nplaintiffs suffered at YDC, David and the putative class plaintiffs, upon reaching adulthood, were \nsuffering from various psychiatric disorders, and when they were released into society, they were \nunable to function normally or find and keep gainful employment.  \n90.  On January 13, 2017, David was no longer able to suppress the memories of \nthe horrific abuse he had suffered. At that time, David disclosed the abuse to his wife for the first \ntime,  after  which  they  immediately  went  to  Exeter  Hospital  for  an  evaluation,  then  to  the \nBrentwood Police station and reported the abuse that David had suffered at YDC.  \n21 \n \n\n \n91.  On or about late February or early March, 2017 an investigator for the State \nPolice met with David at his home.  David recognized her as a former assistant gym teacher from \nYDC who worked there while David was there.  This investigator started out by telling David \nthat she believed him.  The investigator informed David that while she was working at YDC as \nan intern, she became concerned, based on her interactions with the residents at YDC, that there \nwas some form of abuse taking place.  In particular, the investigator described a time when she \nwas working at East Cottage and witnessed another staff member named Al McDonald assault a \nresident and observed other residents with bruises and contusions.  She told David that she was \ntold by a superior that it was in her best interest to keep quiet and stay out of things that did not \nconcern her.     \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co 92.

Prior to that time, David believed that Buskey, Murphy and Woodlock were \n0\n6\nacting alone and without the knowledge of anyone else at YDC, and he believed that the nurse \nand Searles thought he was lying.  \n93.  Following David’s conversation with this State Police investigator in late \nFebruary/early March 2017, as David began to deal with the abuse he had disclosed and began to \nundergo counseling, David began a period of inquiry, investigation and diligence into how adults \nin positions of authority at YDC could have known about the abuse and failed to protect him. \n94.  Over  the  following  weeks,  months,  and  years,  additional  witness  and \nclaimants began to come forward to tell their stories of abuse. \n22 \n \n\n \n95.  Upon information and belief, through this period of inquiry, investigation, and \ndiligence, David discovered why his disclosures of horrific abuse decades earlier had fallen on \ndeaf ears:  he learned that both Brown and Searles, the two (2) men he made aware of his abuse \nwhen he was at YDC, were also physically, sexually, and mentally/emotionally abusing other \nyoung boys at YDC. \n96.  On information and belief, multiple people knew about the crimes of Buskey, \nMurphy, Woodlock and others but not only failed to report this information as required pursuant \nto R.S.A. 169-C:29 but also concealed this information which resulted in these individuals’ \ncontinued retention at YDC. \n97.

On  information  and  belief,  the  physical  abuse,  sexual  abuse,  and \nmental/emotional abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of education suffered by David \nand by the putative class plaintiffs was so pervasive and severe that it was apparent to and known \nabout by everyone working at YDC, including, but not limited to, those in supervisory positions.   \n99.  On information and belief, YDC, through its agents and employees, and the \nindividual  defendants  both  as  agents  and/or  employees  of  YDC  and  also  individually, \n23 \n \n\n \nintentionally concealed the ongoing acts of abuse from law enforcement authorities and also \nacted to “gaslight” David and the other putative class plaintiffs by denying the physical abuse, \nsexual abuse, and mental/emotional abuse had ever occurred, even when directly confronted by \none of their victims.  This created an atmosphere at YDC in which David and the other putative \nclass members were made to understand that it was unsafe for them to attempt to report the abuse \nthey were suffering, that they would not be believed if they attempted to report the abuse to \nanyone inside or outside of YDC, and that there was no recourse for their suffering. \n100.  As a direct consequence of the deliberate acts of the defendants, even after \nleaving YDC, David and the other putative class members were too frightened to speak out and \ndid not understand that they could seek legal counsel. \n m\nL.L..

As a direct consequence of the deliberate acts of the defendants, even after \n0\n6\nleaving YDC, David and the other putative class members believed that there was no way to \nprove that they had been abused while at YDC, so any action to seek redress would be futile. \n103.  Because the deliberate and intentional acts of the defendants misled David and \nthe other putative class members, thereby preventing them from promptly seeking redress for \ntheir injuries, the applicable statute of limitations should be tolled until David and the other \nputative class members learned that there was legal recourse for his, and their, abuse.   \n104.  On or about July 25, 2019, the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office \nannounced that Buskey and Murphy were indicted on eighty-two (82) counts of aggravated \n24 \n \n\n \nfelonious sexual assault against David, and that the Office was “launching a comprehensive, \nmulti-faceted investigation of the YDC and the personnel employed at that agency.”   \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \n(Negligent Hiring, Training, Supervision, and Retention – DHHS, DJJS, DCYF, and \nSYSC) \n \n105.  The plaintiff hereby repeats, realleges, and incorporates by reference each and \nevery factual allegation set forth in the preceding Paragraphs as though fully and completely set \nforth herein. \n106.  On information and belief, multiple people knew about the crimes of Buskey, \nMurphy, Woodlock and other perpertrators, then not only failed to report this information, but \n m\nL.L.. Claw.co also actively concealed this information which resulted in these individuals’ continued retention \n. P& Associates, www.rilee8234   at YDC1. 07.  On further information and belief, when reports of suspected sexual and physical \ne 2.\ne3\nRil3.2 abuse  were  made,  the  reporters  were  told  to  keep  it  to  themselves.    Consequently,  the \n0\n6\nperpetrators of sexual abuse continued to work at YDC and continued to commit acts of physical \nabuse, sexual abuse, and mental/emotional abuse against David and the putative class plaintiffs. \n108.  At all times relevant to the allegations contained herein, DHHS, DJJS, DCYF, and \nSYSC owed David and the putative class plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care in the \nhiring, training, supervision, and retention of its employees and agents, including, inter alia, the \nduty to conduct appropriate background checks of employees, the duty to properly supervise, \ntrain, and control the employees and agents working at YDC and/or to ensure that programs were \nin place to provide proper supervision, training and control of YDC agents and/or employees so \n25 \n \n\n \nthat they would comply with the requirements of New Hampshire Revised Statutes, 621:2, which \ninclude the duties: \nI. To provide a wholesome physical and emotional setting for each child \ndetained at or committed to the center; \nII. To provide protection, care, counseling, supervision, and rehabilitative \nservices as required by the individual child; \nIII. To assure that the child has not been deprived of those rights to which \nhe or she is entitled by law. \n \n109.

As a consequence of the failure to adopt any rules, there were no policies in \nplace at YDC for the prevention and, if necessary, reporting of abuse of the residents of YDC by \nthe staff and/or other employees at YDC.  In fact, the lack of any rules communicated a laissez-\nfaire attitude that the employees and agents at YDC were free to behave as they pleased without \n27 \n \n\n \nfear of discovery or consequences. \n114.
