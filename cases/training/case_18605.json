Biden, Jr., Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, Meena Seshamani, Daniel Tsai USCA Appeal #: 21-3725 - Before LOKEN, BENTON, and KELLY, Circuit Judges In November 2021, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the \"Secretary\") issued an interim final rule requiring that participating facilities ensure that their staff are vaccinated against COVID-19 to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding (unless exempt for medical or religious reasons). See 86 Fed. Reg. 61555 (2021). Many states challenged the rule. Two district courts, including the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, enjoined its enforcement. See Missouri v. Biden, No. 4:21-CV-01329-MTS, 2021 WL 5564501 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 29, 2021). The district court ruled that the states were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to issue the rule. Id. The federal government filed an emergency motion in this court to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. This court denied the motion. The federal government petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending further review by this court. The Supreme Court stayed the preliminary injunction pending the outcome of this appeal. Biden v. Missouri, 142 S. Ct. 647 (2022). Based on the Supreme Court's opinion, this court vacates the preliminary injunction and remands to the district court for a determination of the merits of the State of Missouris claim for permanent injunctive relief.

    "summary": "<p>This case is about whether the federal government can require Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. President Joe Biden announced in September 2020 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would issue a rule requiring vaccination for all employees in Medicare- and Medicaid- participating facilities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), which is an HHS component, issued a rule to that effect. On November 10, 2021, the States of Missouri, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Wyoming, Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and New Hampshire sued the United States, President Joseph Biden, HHS, CMS, and several other federal officials in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\r\n<p>The states presented several statutory and constitutional claims for relief. They argued that the rule was arbitrary and capricious and therefore in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The states contended CMS failed to engage in reasoned decision-making and arbitrarily failed to account for the economic impacts of the mandate on the healthcare industry and the costs to the states and instead simply followed the directions of the President. The states also claimed that CMS violated the APA by acting in excess of its statutory authority, arguing that CMS lacks the power to mandate vaccinations and that its dong so violated Title 18 of the Social Security Act by authorizing federal officials to exercise supervision or control over the selection and tenure of persons providing health services. The states also claimed that CMS failed to abide by the notice and comment requirements for federal rule-making, in violation of the APA and the Social Security Act. In addition, the states argued that the vaccine mandate violated 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1395z due to CMS's failure to consult with the appropriate state agencies and violated 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1302 due to HHS's failure to prepare a regulatory impact analysis on the mandate's effect on rural hospitals.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the claims of statutory violations, the states also made constitutional and federalism arguments. They stated that the vaccine mandate violated the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution by putting an unconstitutional condition on the states' receipt of federal funds and by using the federal government's spending power to conscript state agencies for federal purposes. The states also contended that the mandate violated the anti-commandeering doctrine by compelling states to administer federal regulatory programs. Lastly, the states argued that the federal government violated the Tenth Amendment and the principles of federalism by exercising power beyond what was delegated to it through the Constitution and U.S. Congress and by interfering with the states' police power, which includes the authority to adopt public health regulations.</p>\r\n<p>The states sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against enforcement of the mandate and a declaration that the mandate is unconstitutional and unlawful. The case was assigned to Judge Matthew T. Schelp.</p>\r\n<p>On November 12, 2021, the states moved for a preliminary injunction. On November 29, the court granted the motion and enjoined CMS from implementing and enforcing the vaccine mandate. 571 F.Supp.3d 1079. The court ruled that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their case. The court found that, while Congress gave HHS the general authority to enact regulations for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid and the health and safety of recipients, the nature and breadth of the CMS mandate required clear authorization from Congress, which had not occurred. The court noted the vast economic and political significance of the mandate and the significant alteration of the balance between federal and state power that the mandate entailed. The court also found no clear indication of Congress's intent to authorize CMS to enact such a substantial and significant mandate and thus concluded that Congress likely did not grant CMS the authority to mandate the vaccine.</p>\r\n<p>The court also found a likelihood that CMS improperly bypassed the notice and comment requirements of the APA and the Social Security Act. The court noted that while the requirements may be bypassed if the agency has good cause, CMS's own delay in mandating vaccination undermined its emergency justification argument for dispensing with the requirements. The court stated that given the unprecedented, controversial, and health-related nature of the mandate, good cause was even more important than usual. The court also noted that the failure to take and respond to comments would likely exacerbate vaccine hesitancy.</p>\r\n<p>The court also determined that the states were likely to succeed in establishing that the vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious. The court held that CMS lacked evidence showing that vaccination status has a direct impact on COVID-19 spread in healthcare facilities. Furthermore, the court found that CMS had improperly rejected alternatives to the mandate, such as periodic testing or exemptions for individuals with natural immunity from COVID-19 due to a prior infection. The court also found a likelihood of a finding that the mandate is arbitrary and capricious due to its broad scope. Specifically, the court noted that the mandate applies to all covered facilities equally, regardless of the dangers of COVID-19 infection in each respective facility. The court also concluded that CMS had failed to adequately explain its sudden change in policy, from encouraging to forcing vaccination. The court also determined that when CMS weighed the benefits and risks of the mandate to the healthcare industry, it failed to properly consider all reliance interests, particularly the interests of those opposed to the mandate.</p>\r\n<p>Next, the court held that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief. The court found that the states had shown that mandate would irreparably harm their sovereign interests because they would be unable to enforce their own laws surrounding vaccination mandates and proof of vaccination. Next, the court determined that the states' quasi-sovereign interests were likely to suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction. These quasi-sovereign interests include the health and well-being of the residents of the plaintiff states. The court found that the plaintiffs had filed adequate support to show that their citizens would be physically and economically harmed by the mandate. These harms stem from the likelihood that the mandate would exacerbate already-existing staffing shortages, which would likely cause a reduction in quality of care, a decrease in the variety of services offered, and possible closures of some facilities, entirely. The court also found that the negative effects on the economies of the plaintiff states would also be irreparable due to sovereign immunity against monetary damages for federal agencies. The court further determined that the plaintiffs would likely face irreparable harm to their proprietary interests absent preliminary relief. These proprietary interests include the general financial health of the plaintiffs' facilities.</p>\r\n<p>Next, the court held that the balance of equities tipped in favor of the plaintiff states and that the public had an interest in an injunction. The court found that the public would suffer little, if any, harm from maintaining the status quo throughout the litigation. The court noted that the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease transmission was unknown, while the evidence submitted by the plaintiff states showed a likelihood of crippling effects on significant numbers of healthcare facilities.</p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2021, the defendants appealed the district court's preliminary injunction to the Eighth Circuit (USCA Case # 21-3725). On the same day, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending their appeal in the district court and in the Eighth Circuit. On December 1, the district court denied the defendant's motion for a stay. 2021 WL 5631736. The court determined that the defendants were not likely to prevail on the merits of their appeal for the same reasons that the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. While the defendants argued that hundreds or thousands of lives would be lost each month without a vaccine mandate in place, the court noted CMS's conclusion that the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease transmission by those who are vaccinated is currently unknown. The court therefore concluded that the defendants had not shown a likelihood of irreparable harm absent a stay. The court further concluded that facilities in the plaintiff states would likely face operational crises if a stay were granted. Lastly, the court reiterated its earlier finding that an injunction is in the public's interest. On December 13, the Eighth Circuit also denied the defendants' motion for a stay pending appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On December 16, 2021, the defendants applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. On December 22, the defendants filed a consent motion to stay proceedings in the district court pending appeal, which the district court granted on the same day.</p>\r\n<p>On January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court stayed the district court's injunction pending the defendants' appeal in the Eighth Circuit. 595 U.S. 87. In a per curiam opinion, the Court analyzed two preliminary injunctions against CMS's mandate: the injunction issued by the Eastern District of Missouri in this case and the injunction issued in Louisiana v. Becerra. See 2021 WL 5609846. First, the Court held that the mandate fell within the authorities that Congress conferred on HHS, including the ability to impose conditions on the receipt of Medicaid and Medicare funds if the department finds the conditions necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals receiving services through Medicare and Medicaid. The Court found that requiring providers to take steps to avoid transmitting COVID-19 was consistent with this statutory authorization. The Court noted the longstanding practice of HHS to condition Medicare and Medicaid funds on a host of conditions that address the safe and effective provision of healthcare, including conditions of participation that relate to the qualifications and duties of healthcare workers.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court also held that the mandate was not arbitrary and capricious. The Court stated that the plaintiff states had not shown that CMS had failed to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its decisions to impose the vaccine mandate instead of a testing mandate; require vaccination of employees with natural immunity; and to depart from the agency's prior approach of encouraging, rather than mandating, vaccination. The Court also concluded that CMS had good cause to delay notice and comment, since it found that the promulgation of the rule in advance of the winter flu season would reduce COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Justice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion in the case, which was joined by Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett. Justice Alito also filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, and Barrett.</p>\r\n<p>On February 23, 2022, the plaintiff states filed an amended complaint back in the district court and moved to lift the stay of the district court proceedings that had started on December 22, 2021. On March 23, 2022, the court struck the plaintiffs' amended complaint, since the time had passed to amend their complaint by right and since they had not received leave of court or the defendants' written consent to file the amended complaint. The court also denied the plaintiffs' motion to lift the stay, finding that such a move was not warranted since briefing on appeal in the Eighth Circuit had already concluded.</p>\r\n<p>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case on November 2, 2022. That motion was dismissed without prejudice as moot on November 29, 2022, because the plaintiffs had filed an amended complaint. The defendants filed another motion to dismiss on January 20, 2023. Before the court ruled on that motion to dismiss, on July 19, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice because DHHS withdrew language on COVID-19 health care staff vaccination requirements. On July 21, 2023, the court closed the case.&nbsp;</p>",

As \nof the time of the issuance two weeks ago of the rule at issue in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that \ncauses COVID-19, had infected over 44 million people, hospitalized more than 3 million people, and \nhad claimed more than 720,000 lives in the United States alone.  Those numbers have only grown \nsince.    See  Centers  for  Disease  Control  (“CDC”),  COVID  Data  Tracker  Weekly  Review, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html (updated Nov. 19, \n2021).  More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 68,000 new cases \nand over 1,000 new deaths are reported in the United States every day.  See id.  Included among the \ntremendous human cost are at least half a million reported cases and 1,900 reported deaths among \nhealth  care  staff.    Medicare  and  Medicaid  Programs;  Omnibus  COVID-19 Health  Care  Staff \nVaccination,  86 Fed. Reg. 61,555, 61,559 (Nov. 5, 2021).  The pandemic has been devastating  for \nhealth care facilities and for patients alike.  Because the virus is highly transmissible,  it can easily pass \nfrom person to person at health care facilities.  Beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, \nin  particular,  are more likely  than  the  general  population  to suffer serious  outcomes,  including \nhospitalization  or death, from contracting the disease.   \nFortunately,  there  are  three  vaccines  that  have  now  been  approved or  authorized  for \nemergency use in the United States to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  These vaccines are safe and \nhighly effective.  In health care settings in particular, the weight of the scientific  evidence shows that \nvaccinated people are less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, and are less likely to pass it \nalong to others, than are those who have not been vaccinated.   \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services reviewed this evidence and concluded that action \nwas urgently needed to protect Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries  from the possibility  that they \nwould become infected with the virus while they receive care in facilities  funded by these programs.  \nCongress has assigned the Secretary a statutory responsibility to ensure that the health and safety of \npatients are protected in these federally-funded facilities.  He accordingly issued a rule to do so.   \nThe Secretary’s rule requires certain health care facilities,  as a condition of their participation \n1 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 16 of 66 PageID #: 359\nin these programs, to ensure that those members of their health care staffs who interact with patients, \nor who have  contact with other staff who do so, receive vaccination  for COVID-19, absent an \nexemption.  These staff members are required to be vaccinated (or to obtain the first shot of a two-\ndose regimen) by December 6, or to request an exemption from this requirement from their employer.  \nNon-exempt employees who follow a two-shot regimen must complete their second shot by January \n4, 2022.  The Secretary issued his rule on an emergency basis, and waived a comment period in advance \nof issuing  the  rule,  because  he  foresaw an  imminent  need  to protect  Medicare  and  Medicaid \nbeneficiaries  against a spike in COVID-19 cases in the coming winter months.   Although  precise \ncalculations  on this score are of course not possible, he determined that his rule was likely to save \nhundreds, and possibly thousands, of lives each month, once it is implemented. \nThe Plaintiffs  are ten States, who now seek a preliminary injunction  to prevent the Secretary \nfrom enforcing this rule.  But this Court lacks jurisdiction over their claims.  Congress has withdrawn \nfederal-question jurisdiction over claims like this one that arise under the Medicare statute.  Instead, \nCongress has established by statute an exclusive system for judicial review, under which a party must \nfirst present a particular  claim for benefits,  or dispute a particular  sanction,  to the agency for its \nresolution before that party may proceed to federal court.  The Plaintiffs have not met this statutory \nprerequisite for this Court’s jurisdiction.  \n In addition, the Plaintiffs  fail to satisfy any of the requirements for a preliminary injunction.   \nIn particular, the Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims.  The Secretary has the \nstatutory authority and responsibility to ensure that federal funds are used to protect, rather than harm, \nthe  health  and safety  of patients  who receive  care in facilities  that  voluntarily  participate  in  the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs.  He reasonably exercised that authority to arrive at his vaccination \nrule.  He explained his determination that the life-saving potential of the rule compelled him to take \naction now.  In so doing, he took into account the rule’s potential costs, including the possibility that \nsome health  care  workers would seek other  employment rather  than  accept  vaccination,  but he \nconcluded, on the basis of real-world experience with vaccination  requirements,  that relatively  few \nhealth care workers would do so.  Given that about a quarter of a health care facility’s staff on average \n2 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 17 of 66 PageID #: 360\nare new hires in any given year, he concluded that the effects of workers leaving for other employment \nto avoid vaccination, and the countervailing effects of other employees newly seeking jobs in facilities \nthat require vaccination,  would be dwarfed by the effects of this  regular churn  in the health  care \nworkforce.  The Secretary accordingly reasonably chose to take action,  on an emergency basis, to \nprotect lives in the coming weeks and months.   \nNor can the Plaintiffs  meet the remaining  preliminary injunction  factors.  They have not \nshown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief.  The only harm the \nPlaintiffs  might  even  have  Article  III  standing  to assert—an  alleged  economic  loss—is  entirely \nspeculative, as the Northern District of Florida recently concluded.  Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., No. 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021), Order at 8, ECF No. 6 (denying \npreliminary injunction motion in a nearly identical suit for the State’s failure to show irreparable harm).  \nAnd the equities and the public interest weigh heavily against the entry of preliminary injunctive  relief.  \nGranting the requested injunction would harm the public’s significant interest in protecting the health \nof Medicare and Medicaid patients.  An injunction would increase the likelihood that health care staff \nwill infect those patients with the virus and thus the likelihood that they will suffer COVID-19 illness \nor death.  It will also increase the risks to the health of health care staff and exacerbate some known \ncauses  of staffing  shortages  at Medicare- and Medicaid-participating  facilities.   These  compelling \ninterests  easily  outweigh  the  speculative  economic  harm  that  might  befall  the Plaintiffs  absent \npreliminary relief.   \nFor all of these reasons, the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction  should be denied. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The COVID-19 pandemic  has had devastating effects on Medicare and Medicaid \npatients, and on health care workers. \n  The  novel  coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2 causes  a severe  acute  respiratory  disease  known as \nCOVID-19.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,556.  The virus is highly transmissible,  id. at 61,557, and extremely \ndangerous, id. at 61,556.  As of mid-October 2021, over 44 million  COVID-19 cases,  3 million \nCOVID-19 related hospitalizations,  and 720,000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported in the United \n3 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 18 of 66 PageID #: 361\nStates.  Id.  Over half a million COVID-19 cases and 1,900 deaths have been reported among health \ncare staff alone.  Id. at 61,559.  COVID-19 has now “overtaken the 1918 influenza pandemic as the \ndeadliest disease in American history.”  Id. at 61,556. \nRecent  estimates  of undiagnosed infections  and under-reported deaths  indicate  that these \nfigures likely underestimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Id. at 61,557 n.4 (citing Seyed \nM. Moghadas and Alison P. Galvani, The Unrecognized Death Toll of COVID-19 in the United States, Lancet \nRegional  Health  Americas  (Sept.  1,  2021),  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100033).    These \nfigures also fail to capture the widespread and devastating effects of post-acute illness from the virus, \nincluding  long-term  nervous  system  and neurocognitive  disorders, cardiovascular  disorders,  and \nreduced quality of life.  Id. at 61,557 n.5 (citing Destin Groff, et al., Short-Term and Long-Term Rates of \nPostacute  Sequelae  of  SARS-CoV-2  Infection,  JAMA  Network  Open  (Oct.  13,  2021), \nhttps://doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.28568).   \nBecause the virus that causes  COVID-19 is highly transmissible,  it is easily  spread among \nhealth care workers, and from health care workers to patients, in health care facilities.  Id. at 61,557 \nn.16 (citing,  e.g., Jonne J. Sikkens,  et al., Serologic Surveillance  and Phylogenetic  Analysis  of SARS-CoV-2 \nInfection  among  Health  Care  Workers,  JAMA  Network  Open  (July  28,  2021), \nhttp://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.18554).  Unvaccinated health care workers are highly \nsusceptible to transmitting the virus to their colleagues and to their patients.  Id. at 61,558 n.42 (citing, \ne.g., Scott C. Roberts, et al., Correlation of Healthcare Worker Vaccination with Inpatient Healthcare-Associated \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 2021 Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology 1 (Sept. 21, \n2021)).  Participants  in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are more likely  to face high risk of \ncontracting COVID-19 and of experiencing severe outcomes from the disease.  Id. at 61,609.  In short, \n“the available evidence for ongoing healthcare-associated  COVID-19 transmission risk is sufficiently \nalarming in and of itself to compel CMS to take action.”  Id. at 61,558.   \nUnvaccinated staff also jeopardize patients’ access to needed medical care and services.  Id.  \nOut of a fear of exposure to the virus, patients  are refusing care from unvaccinated  staff, thereby \nlimiting the ability of providers to meet the health care needs of their patients.  Id.  Patients also are \n4 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 19 of 66 PageID #: 362\nforgoing medically necessary care altogether to avoid contracting SARS-Cov-2 infections from health \ncare workers.  Id.  Absenteeism from health care staff as a result of infection with the virus has also \ncreated staffing shortages that have disrupted patient access to recommended care.  Id. at 61,559.  At \nnursing  homes in particular, overall staffing levels,  as measured on the basis of nursing  hours per \nresident day, have remained stable; however, this appears to be a function of the reduced demand for \nmedical care associated with patients’ fears of contracting the virus from health care facility settings.  \nId.       \nIn June and July 2021, the United States began to experience a dramatic increase in COVID-\n19 case and hospitalization  rates, driven by an especially contagious strain of SARS-CoV-2 known as \nthe Delta variant. Id. at 61,559.  COVID-19 cases among staff of health care facilities  have grown \nsubstantially  since the emergence of the Delta variant.   For example, cases among long-term care \nfacility and end-stage renal disease facility staff have increased by over 1400 percent and 850 percent, \nrespectively,  between June and September 2021.  Id.  Over the same time period, daily cases  of \nCOVID-19 increased over 1200 percent, new hospital admissions increased over 600 percent, and \ndaily deaths increased over 800 percent.  Id. at 61,583.  The vast majority of cases during this time \nperiod were among the unvaccinated population.  Id.    \nIn September and October 2021, newly reported cases began to trend downward, albeit still \nat highly elevated levels,1 but there are troubling indications that a resurgence in the virus is coming \nin the next several weeks, particularly in northern states.  Id. at 61,584.  Respiratory virus infections, \nlike the virus that causes COVID-19, typically circulate more frequently  during the winter months, \nand the United States experienced a large spike in COVID-19 cases during the winter of 2020.  Id.  \nThe 2021-2022 winter influenza season may be an abnormally severe one, given lower immunity levels \nto influenza.   Id.  The interaction  between the COVID-19 virus and the influenza virus may lead to \nparticularly severe outbreaks over the next several months.  Id. at 61,584  n.190 (citing Sonja J. Olson, \n                                              \n1  Those trends have reversed in the two weeks since the issuance  of the rule; case rates are \nnow climbing substantially.   See Centers for Disease Control, COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html (updated Nov. 19, \n2021). \n5 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 20 of 66 PageID #: 363\net al., Changes in Influenza  and Other Respiratory Virus Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic – United \nStates, 2020-2021, 70 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1013 (July 23, 2021)).  “Accordingly, it \nis imperative that the risk for healthcare-associated  COVID-19 transmission be minimized during the \ninfluenza season.”  Id.        \nII.  Safe and effective vaccines are available to protect patients of health care facilities. \n  Currently, three manufacturers offer vaccines approved or authorized for emergency use in \nthe United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Id. at 61,563.  FDA has authority to \nreview and approve “biological products,” including vaccines, as safe and effective for their intended \nuses.  See 42 U.S.C. § 262(a)(1), (i)(1).  Under § 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 \nU.S.C. § 360bbb-3, FDA also may issue an “emergency use authorization”  (EUA) during a public \nhealth emergency, which authorizes the marketing of vaccines (and other products) “intended for use” \nin responding to the emergency.  \nIn March 2020, the Secretary determined that “circumstances exist justifying the authorization \nof emergency  use  of drugs and biological  products during  the  COVID-19 pandemic[.]”  EUA \nDeclaration, 85 Fed. Reg. 18,250, 18,250–51 (Apr. 1, 2020).  Based on that determination, FDA issued \nEUAs in December 2020 for the  Pfizer-BioNTech  and Moderna vaccines,  and a third  EUA in \nFebruary 2021 for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,564.  The EUAs for \nthe three vaccines  are based on FDA’s review of extensive  safety and efficacy data, including  data \nfrom clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people.  Id. at 61,562.   \nOn August 23, 2021, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine obtained FDA approval, under \nthe name Comirnaty, for people aged 16 years and older.  Id. at 61,564.  In approving Comirnaty, FDA \ndetermined that the vaccine was 91.1% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease and between 95% \nand 100% effective in preventing severe COVID-19 disease, based on an analysis of effectiveness data \nfrom approximately 20,000 vaccine  and 20,000 placebo recipients.   FDA, Comirnaty Approved \nPrescribing Information at 7, 15–18 (revised Aug. 20, 2021), https://perma.cc/53H8-UG3C.

The Social Security Act grants the Secretary the authority to protect the health and \nsafety of patients in facilities funded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \nCongress established the Medicare program “[a]s a means of providing health care to the aged \nand disabled.”  Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 404 (1993); see 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.  \nCongress also created the Medicaid program, which is a cooperative state and federal program to \n“furnish medical assistance”—i.e.,  health care—on behalf of individuals “whose income and resources \nare insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services[.]”  42 U.S.C. § 1396-1.   Both programs \nwere adopted in the 1965 amendments to the Social Security  Act.  Both are administered by the \nSecretary  of Health  and  Human  Services,  acting  through  the  Administrator  of the  Centers  for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  Under both Medicare and Medicaid, health care services are \nprovided by private organizations and health care professionals who meet the statutory and regulatory \nrequirements for participation.  Participation in either Medicare or Medicaid is voluntary.   \nTo participate  in  the  Medicare  program and  receive  payment  for services  furnished  to \nMedicare  beneficiaries,  providers such  as hospitals,  home-health  agencies,  hospices,  and skilled \nnursing facilities must enter into a provider agreement with CMS after demonstrating that they meet \nthe conditions for participation.  42 U.S.C. § 1395cc.  Medicaid providers, likewise, voluntarily enter \ninto provider agreements with State Medicaid agencies to be eligible for participation in that program.  \n8 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 23 of 66 PageID #: 366\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(27).  By voluntarily  entering into a provider agreement, a facility agrees that it \nwill comply with the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and the regulations that the \nSecretary issues under these statutes.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2); see also id. § 1396a(p)(1).   \nThe Secretary has broad authority under the Social Security Act and, in particular, under the \nMedicare statute to issue such regulations “as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the \nfunctions with which” he is charged under each statute.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(a); see also id. § 1395hh(a)(1).  \nIn particular, the Secretary is charged with issuing regulations as he deems necessary to—among other \nthings—ensure  that the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients are protected while these \nindividuals receive care that is funded by either program.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9) (defining a \n“hospital” as an institution  which “meets such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary in \nthe interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution”);  id. \n§ 1395i-3(d)(4)(B) (“A skilled nursing facility must meet such other requirements relating to the health, \nsafety, and well-being of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find \nnecessary.”).  These regulations are alternatively  known as “conditions of participation,” “conditions \nfor coverage,” or “requirements for participation.”   \nThe Secretary’s  long-standing  regulations  include  detailed requirements  governing, among \nother things, the qualifications of professional staff, the condition of facilities, and other requirements \nthat he deems necessary to protect patient health and safety.  In particular, Medicare and Medicaid \nproviders and suppliers  have long been required  to maintain  effective  “infection  prevention  and \ncontrol programs,” to “provide a safe, sanitary, and comfortable environment and to help prevent the \ndevelopment and transmission of communicable diseases and infections.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.80 (long-\nterm care facilities);  see also, e.g., id. §§ 482.42(a) (hospitals); 416.51(b) (ambulatory surgical centers).   \nThe Medicare statute directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with the States under which \neach state health agency (or other appropriate state or local agency) agrees to conduct periodic surveys \nto determine whether providers meet Medicare’s conditions of participation.  42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a); \nsee also 42 C.F.R. § 488.10(a).  A State’s decision to enter into a state survey agreement is voluntary.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a) (authorizing agreements with “any State which is able and willing to do so”).  \n9 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 24 of 66 PageID #: 367\nIf the State enters into such an agreement, however, it obliges itself to conduct surveys to “assess \ncompliance with Federal health,  safety and quality  standards,” 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(1),  using “the \nsurvey methods, procedures, and forms that are prescribed by CMS,” id. § 488.26(d).  If a provider is \naccredited by a national accrediting organization’s CMS-approved accreditation program, CMS may \ndeem that provider to have met the applicable Medicare conditions of participation.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395bb(a); 42 C.F.R. §§ 488.4, 488.10(b).  In such a case, however, the Medicare statute authorizes \nCMS to rely  on state  health  agencies  (or other  appropriate state  or local agencies)  to conduct \n“validation  surveys”  of  an  accredited  provider  to  “validate”  the  accrediting  organization’s \ndetermination.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(c); 42 C.F.R. § 488.10(c).  These surveys are conducted on a \n“representative  sample” basis or “in response to substantial  allegations”  of deficiencies  that would \nadversely affect the health and safety of patients (in which case they are often referred to as “complaint \nsurveys”).  42 C.F.R. § 488.9(a); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(c).   If such a validation or complaint survey \nreveals significant  deficiencies  on the part of a provider, that provider will no longer be deemed to \nmeet the conditions of participation and will be subject to ongoing review by the state survey agency \nuntil  the  provider demonstrates  compliance.   See 42 U.S.C. §  1395bb(c); 42 C.F.R.  §§ 488.9(c), \n488.10(d).2 \nAfter completing a survey, the State survey agency provides its certification  of substantial \ncompliance or noncompliance, which is a recommendation to CMS.  See 42 C.F.R. § 488.12.  CMS has \nsole authority to determine noncompliance and impose remedies on Medicare providers.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395i-3(h)(2).  If a provider fails to comply with conditions of participation, CMS may, upon notice, \nterminate the provider’s participation in the Medicare program, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2); 42 C.F.R. \n                                              \n2  Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ assertion, Br. at 29-30, a state survey agency’s failure to review for \nprovider compliance does not “disqualify” providers in that state from program participation.   All \nMedicare and Medicaid certified facilities are assumed to be in compliance until a survey (which could \nbe performed by a CMS contractor, by an accreditation organization, or—if a State voluntarily takes \non this role—by a state survey agency) makes an initial finding of a violation.  Even then, the facility \nwould remain certified while CMS pursues a plan of correction with the agency.  See 42 C.F.R. § 488.11 \n(state survey agency functions do not include enforcement). \n10 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 25 of 66 PageID #: 368\n§ 489.53, or in certain circumstances,  impose other remedies, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395bbb(e),(f); 42 \nC.F.R. § 488.820 (additional remedies for home-health agencies). \nProviders have a vehicle for administrative  review of these remedies.  Specifically,  a facility \nmay appeal an “initial determination” by CMS, including a “finding of noncompliance leading to the \nimposition of enforcement actions” specified in the regulations.  42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(13).  The facility \nis entitled to a de novo hearing before an administrative  law judge (“ALJ”), at which it may present \nevidence and witnesses.   42 C.F.R. §§ 498.40-498.79.  A facility  that is dissatisfied  with an ALJ’s \ndetermination may appeal that decision to the Appellate Division of the Departmental Appeals Board \n(the “Board”).  42 C.F.R. § 498.80.   \nThe Board’s decision is the final decision of the Secretary.  See id.  § 498.90.  The Medicare \nstatute allows a provider to seek judicial review of the “final decision” of the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395cc(h)(1)(A)  (cross-referencing  42 U.S.C. § 405(g)).  As explained  by the Supreme Court in \nShalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 8 (2000), the Medicare statute makes this avenue \nof judicial  review exclusive.   The statute  provides that  “[n]o findings  of fact or decision  of the \n[Secretary]  shall  be reviewed by any  person,  tribunal,  or governmental  agency  except as  herein \nprovided.”  42 U.S.C. § 405(h) (incorporated into the Medicare statute by 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii).  And \nthe same provision further provides that “[n]o action against the United States, the [Secretary], or any \nofficer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of Title 28 to recover on any \nclaim arising under [the Medicare Act].”  Id. \nIV.  The Secretary has acted in response to the pandemic, but recent developments have \nrevealed an urgent need for further action to protect the health of Medicare and \nMedicaid patients. \nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretary has taken numerous actions to \naddress the public health emergency.  Among other things, he issued a rule waiving certain regulatory \nrequirements requiring that medical encounters be held in person.  85 Fed. Reg. 19,230 (Apr. 6, 2020).  \nHe  also instituted  new data-reporting requirements  for certain  providers and implemented  new \nstatutory requirements that providers make public the prices for COVID-19 diagnostic tests.  See 85 \n11 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 26 of 66 PageID #: 369\nFed. Reg. 54,820 (Sept. 2, 2020); 85 Fed. Reg. 71,142-205 (Nov. 6, 2020).     \nIn May 2021, the Secretary exercised his authority to issue regulations for the protection of \nbeneficiaries’  health  and  safety  by  issuing  a  rule  that  established  enhanced  infection  control \nrequirements  for long-term care facilities  and other facilities.   86 Fed. Reg. 26,306 (May 13, 2021).  \nThis rule required, among other things, that the covered facilities offer COVID-19 vaccination  and \neducation about the vaccine to both residents and staff.  Id.   \nAs noted above, the emergence of the Delta variant over the summer months led to a dramatic \nspike in cases, hospitalizations,  and deaths caused by COVID-19, a resurgence that has been driven \nby the spread of infection among the unvaccinated population.  The Secretary’s initial policy approach, \nafter vaccines became available to the general population during the early months of 2021, was “to \nencourage rather than mandate vaccination.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  It appeared at the time that “a \ncombination  of other  Federal  actions,  a  variety  of public  education  campaigns,  and  State  and \nemployer-based efforts would be adequate.”  Id.  Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case—\n“vaccine uptake among health care staff has not been as robust as hoped for and ha[s] been insufficient \nto protect the health and safety of individuals receiving health care services” from covered providers.  \nId.  Vaccination rates among health care workers average 67%, 64%, or 60% for long-term care facility \nstaff, hospital staff, and end-stage renal disease facility staff, respectively.  Id. at 61,599.  In September \n2021, the President announced his COVID-19 Action Plan, which announced a series of regulatory \nactions that federal agencies were planning to undertake in response to the pandemic.  As relevant \nhere, the announcement  described CMS’s plans to require vaccinations  for health  care workers at \nMedicare- and Medicaid-participating  facilities.   The  White  House,  Path  Out  of the  Pandemic, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan (last visited Nov. 19, 2021). \nV.  The Secretary issued the vaccination rule to protect the health and safety of Medicare \nand Medicaid patients from the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in health care \nfacilities.   \nOn November 5, 2021, CMS issued the  interim final rule that is the subject  of this  case.  \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs; Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. \n12 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 27 of 66 PageID #: 370\n61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021).  The  rule is comprehensive  and detailed,  discussing  in 72 pages its  new \nrequirements  for Medicare and Medicaid suppliers and providers.  It requires various categories of \nproviders and suppliers that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including hospitals, \nlong-term care facilities,  and end-stage renal dialysis facilities,  to develop and implement plans and \npolicies to “ensure staff are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, unless  exempt, because vaccination  of \nstaff is necessary for the health and safety of individuals to whom care and services are furnished.”  \nId. at 61,561.  Specifically,  vaccination  and accompanying documentation are required for any non-\nexempt staff that  “interact  with other staff, patients,  residents,  clients,  or [elderly care] program \nparticipants in any location[.]”  Id. at 61,568, 61,570; see also id. at 61,570 (listing the types of facility \nstaff subject to the vaccination  requirement).   At the same time, facilities  must develop policies to \npermit their staff to request exemptions from the vaccination  requirement,  given that  staff  “who \ncannot be vaccinated  or tested because of an ADA disability,  medical condition, or sincerely  held \nreligious belief, practice, or observance may in some circumstances  be granted an exemption from \ntheir employer.”  Id. at 61,572.   \nThe rule establishes two implementation phases.  Phase 1 is effective 30 days after publication, \ni.e., December 6, 2021, and requires all relevant staff to have received the first dose of a two-dose \nCOVID-19 vaccine or a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, or to have requested or have been granted \nan exemption under the health care facility’s exemption policies.  Id. at 61,573.  In addition, Phase 1 \nrequires that facilities subject to the rule have developed and implemented policies and procedures to \nvaccinate staff by that date.  Id.  Phase 2 is effective 60 days after publication, i.e., January 4, 2022, and \nrequires that all non-exempt staff who are covered by the rule be vaccinated by that date.  Id.  The rule \nstates  that  CMS will issue  interpretive  guidelines  regarding assessment  of compliance with these \nrequirements,  and  provider and  suppliers  cited  for noncompliance  may  be  subject  to  certain \nenforcement remedies depending “on the level of noncompliance and the remedies available under \nFederal law.”  Id. at 61,574. \nThe Secretary also concluded in the rule that there was good cause to waive the notice and \ncomment process in rulemaking.  He explained in detail how “current levels of COVID-19 vaccination \n13 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 28 of 66 PageID #: 371\ncoverage up until  now have  been  inadequate  to protect  health  care  consumers  and staff,”  and \ndemonstrated a “pressing need for a consistent  Federal policy mandating staff vaccination in health \ncare settings that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds.”  Id. at 61,583-84.  In particular, the Secretary \nreasoned that there was a pressing need for action in light of the coming winter influenza  season, \nwhich he noted could be particularly intense  and could lead to a dramatic increase in both influenza \nand COVID-19 cases among vulnerable populations, including Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.  \nId. at 61,584. These findings demonstrated to the Secretary that “a vaccine mandate for healthcare \nworkers is an essential  component of the nation’s COVID-19 response, the delay of which would \ncontribute to additional negative health outcomes for patients including loss of life.”  Id. (emphasis added).  \nThus, CMS concluded “it would endanger the health  and safety of patients, and be contrary to the \npublic interest  to delay” issuance  of a vaccine  requirement  for staff in healthcare  settings.   Id. at \n61,586.  \nVI.  This litigation is brought. \nThe  Plaintiff  States  challenge  the  rule,  asserting  claims  purportedly arising  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Social Security Act, and Article I and the Tenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution.  Compl. ¶¶ 166-257.  The Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on November \n10, 2021.  See Compl.  On November 12, 2021, the Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  See Pl. \nStates’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 9 (“Br.”). \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n “A preliminary injunction  is an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that should “never be \nawarded as of right.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008) (citation omitted).  A plaintiff is \nentitled to such an “extraordinary remedy” only “upon a clear showing” that it is “entitled to such \nrelief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  To establish  such entitlement,  a \nplaintiff  must demonstrate  that  (1) it is likely  to succeed  on the  merits;  (2) it is  likely  to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its favor; and \n(4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Id. at 20.  “No single factor is dispositive,” but the “likelihood \nof success on the merits is the most significant.”  Turtle Island Foods, SPC v. Thompson, 992 F.3d 694, \n14 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 29 of 66 PageID #: 372\n699 (8th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted).  When the government is the opposing party, the last two factors \nmerge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIMS BECAUSE \nTHE MEDICARE STATUTE’S CHANNELING PROVISION DEPRIVES THIS \nCOURT OF JURISDICTION OVER SUCH CLAIMS. \nThe Plaintiffs  dispute the validity of the vaccination rule, and argue that health care facilities \nin their States should not be subject  to any sanction,  in the form of loss of Medicare funding or \neligibility  for participation  in the Medicare program, for a violation  of the rule.  This Court lacks \njurisdiction  over these  claims.  Any  claim arising  under the Medicare statute  must be channeled \nthrough that statute’s  exclusive channeling  provisions, no matter whether the Plaintiffs  attempt to \nbring their claim as a pre-enforcement challenge, or whether they bring a constitutional  challenge.  \nThe Medicare statute  “channels  most, if not all, Medicare claims through [a] special review \nsystem.”  Illinois Council,  529 U.S. at 8; see also Degnan v. Burwell, 765 F.3d 805, 808 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h)(1),  for example, a provider dissatisfied with the agency’s decision to \nterminate its Medicare agreement is entitled to “a hearing thereon by the Secretary” and to “judicial \nreview of the Secretary’s  final decision” as is provided in 42 U.S.C. § 405(g).  Congress made this \navenue of judicial review exclusive.  The statute provides that “[n]o findings of fact or decision of the \n[Secretary]  shall  be reviewed by any  person,  tribunal,  or governmental  agency  except as  herein \nprovided.”  42 U.S.C. § 405(h) (made applicable to the Medicare statute by 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii).  And \nthe same provision also forecloses any alternative  bases for jurisdiction,  such  as federal-question \njurisdiction, over any claim “arising under” the Medicare statute.  Id.; see also Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at \n10; Smith v. Berryhill, 139 S.

The Court made inescapably clear that claims involving the Medicare \nprogram may not be brought in federal court before a party first presents its claim to the agency.  The \nCourt held that “the bar of § 405(h) reaches beyond ordinary administrative law principles of ‘ripeness’ \nand ‘exhaustion  of administrative  remedies,’” which are subject to well-established  exceptions, and \ninstead “demands the ‘channeling’  of virtually all legal attacks through the agency.”  529 U.S. at 12–\n13.  As the Court explained, this stringent  requirement  “assures the agency greater opportunity to \napply, interpret, or revise policies, regulations, or statutes without possibly premature interference by \ndifferent individual courts applying ‘ripeness’ and ‘exhaustion’  exceptions case by case.”  Id. at 13. \nThe Supreme Court recognized  that “this  assurance  comes at a price, namely,  occasional \nindividual, delay-related hardship.”  Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 13.  But, the Court explained, \nIn the context of a massive, complex health and safety program such as Medicare, \nembodied in hundreds of pages of statutes and thousands of pages of often interrelated \nregulations, any of which may become the subject of a legal challenge in any of several \ndifferent courts, paying this price may seem justified. \nId.  At least, “such was the judgment of Congress.”  Id.; see also Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 627 \n(1984). \nIllinois Council emphasized the broad reach of the channeling requirement.  The Supreme Court \nexplained that its decisions “foreclose distinctions  based upon the ‘potential future’ versus the ‘actual \npresent’ nature of the claim, the ‘general legal’ versus the ‘fact-specific’ nature of the challenge,  the \n‘collateral’ versus ‘non-collateral’ nature of the issues, or the ‘declaratory’ versus ‘injunctive’  nature of \n                                              \nwhatever.”  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 63 (2004) (cleaned up); see also Family Rehab., \nInc. v. Azar, 886 F.3d 496, 505–06 (5th Cir. 2018).  “The duty owed to the plaintiff must be ministerial \nand a positive command so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt.”  Mitchael v. Colvin, 809 F.3d \n1050, 1054 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation omitted).  The Plaintiffs here seek to invalidate a federal \nregulation, not to compel the performance of a ministerial duty. \n16 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 31 of 66 PageID #: 374\nthe relief sought.”  529 U.S. at 13–14.  The Court also explained that the channeling  requirement is \nnot limited to particular types of relief.  “Claims for money, claims for other benefits, claims of program \neligibility,  and claims  that contest a sanction  or remedy,” the  Court noted, “may all  similarly  rest  upon \nindividual fact-related circumstances,  may all similarly dispute agency policy determinations,  or may \nall similarly involve the application, interpretation,  or constitutionality  of interrelated regulations or \nstatutory provisions.”  Id. at 14 (emphasis added).  The Court found “no reason to distinguish among \nthem in terms of the language or in terms of the purposes of § 405(h).”  Id.; see also In re Bayou Shores \nSNF, LLC, 828 F.3d 1297, 1329 (11th Cir. 2016) (dismissing claim by skilled nursing facility for pre-\nenforcement review of termination of provider agreement). \nThe Plaintiffs’  claims are subject to the jurisdiction-channeling  provision of § 405(h),  and \nfederal-question jurisdiction is barred, if they arise under the Medicare statute, even if they may also \nrise under the Constitution or under other statutes such as the Administrative Procedure Act.  A claim \n“arises  under”  the  Medicare  statute  if  “both  the  standing  and  the  substantive  basis  for  the \npresentation” of the claim is the statute, or if it is “inextricably intertwined with a claim for benefits.”  \nRinger, 466 U.S. at 614-15; see also Clarinda Home Health v. Shalala, 100 F.3d 526, 529 (8th Cir. 1996).  \nThe “arising under” inquiry looks to the claim’s “essence,” and “not whether [the claim] lends itself \nto a ‘substantive’ rather than a ‘procedural’ label.”  Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614-15, 624.  Accordingly, the \nSupreme Court has stated that this rule applies not only to “a claim for future benefits,” but also to \n“all aspects” of any such present or future claim, including requests  for injunctive  and declaratory \nrelief.  See Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 12-14 (quoting Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614-15).   \nUnder this standard, all the claims at issue here plainly “arise under” the Medicare statute.  The \nPlaintiffs, acting purportedly on behalf of several state-run health care facilities and as parens patriae for \nprivately-run health  care facilities  within their borders, challenge  the Secretary’s  statutory authority \nunder the Medicare statute to issue the rule governing standards for COVID-19 vaccinations.   They \nseek pre-enforcement review to challenge  the Secretary’s authority to impose the Medicare statute’s \nremedies of civil monetary penalties, withholding of payments, or termination on facilities that violate \nthe rule.  The standing and substantive  basis for these claims arise under the Medicare statute,  and \n17 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 32 of 66 PageID #: 375\nthey are inextricably intertwined with facilities’ claims that they should continue to receive the benefit \nof eligibility to participate in the Medicare program, without sanction, even if they do not comply with \nthe vaccination rule.  See Blue Valley Hosp. v. Azar, 919 F.3d 1278, 1283 (10th Cir. 2019).4   \nIt does not matter that the Plaintiffs also allege various constitutional  violations; the Medicare \nstatute’s channeling  requirement applies equally to constitutional  as well as nonconstitutional  claims.  \nSee Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 10 (“The statute plainly bars § 1331 review … irrespective of whether \nthe  individual  challenges  the  agency’s  denial  [of a benefit]  on evidentiary,  rule-related,  statutory, \nconstitutional,  or other legal grounds.”); id. at 12 (stressing  that “‘all aspects’ of any such present or \nfuture claim must be ‘channeled’ through the administrative process”).  See also Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 \nU.S. 749, 760–62 (1975).   \nThe Supreme Court has recognized a narrow exception to § 405(h)’s jurisdictional  bar; the \nCourt presumes  that  Congress  did not intend  to preclude  review when  the  application  of the \nchanneling  requirement “would not simply channel  review through the agency, but would mean no \nreview at all.”  Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 19.5   But Plaintiffs may not invoke this exception simply by \nalleging that financial hardship forecloses further review.  See id. at 22; see also Sw. Pharmacy Sols., Inc. v. \nCMS, 718 F.3d 436, 441 (5th Cir. 2013) (“The fact that a plaintiff would suffer great hardship if forced \nto proceed through administrative channels  before obtaining judicial review is insufficient  to warrant \napplication of the Illinois Council exception.”).  “[T]he ‘channeling’  of virtually all legal attacks through \nthe agency . . . comes at a price, namely, occasionally individual, delay-related hardship,” but Congress \n                                              \n4  The conditions of participation regulations are common Medicare and Medicaid regulations, \nwhich are enforced through a unitary enforcement scheme that determines eligibility  and penalties \nunder both programs.  Because  this system requires  review of these  determinations  “through the \nMedicare administrative appeals procedure,” the channeling  requirement of § 405(h) applies fully to \nchallenges  to these regulations.  Cathedral Rock of N. Coll. Hill, Inc. v. Shalala, 223 F.3d 354, 366 (6th \nCir. 2000); see also In re Bayou Shores SNF, LLC, 828 F.3d 1297, 1330 (11th Cir. 2016); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396i(b)(2). \n5  A second narrow exception applies where a plaintiff has presented its claim to the agency, \nand either the agency or the court finds adequate grounds to excuse further exhaustion of that claim.  \nSee Degnan, 765 F.3d at 808-09.  But even where exhaustion might be excused, the presentment of a \nclaim to the agency is a non-waivable jurisdictional requirement under § 405(h).  See Illinois Council, 529 \nU.S. at 15.  No party has yet presented a claim to the agency to contest an enforcement action, and so \nthis exception cannot apply here.  \n18 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 33 of 66 PageID #: 376\nnonetheless  deemed that price “justified” when it enacted the Medicare statute.   Illinois  Council, 529 \nU.S. at 13.  The question instead is “whether, as applied generally . . . hardship likely found in many \ncases  turns what appears to be simply a channeling  requirement  into  complete preclusion  of judicial \nreview.”  Id. at 22-23 (emphasis added); see also Sensory Neurostimulation, Inc. v. Azar, 977 F.3d 969, 983–\n84 (9th Cir. 2020); Blue Valley Hosp., 919 F.3d at 1287–88.   \nThe application of § 405(h) here would not result  in the “complete preclusion” of judicial \nreview of the Secretary’s vaccination rule.  Any provider or supplier that violates the rule and is subject \nto an enforcement action could exhaust its remedies before the agency and then proceed to federal \ncourt.  42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h).   Alternatively,  such  a facility,  upon receiving  notice  of a potential \nsanction and after filing an appeal before an ALJ, “shall have expedited access to judicial review” that \nwill permit the facility  to proceed directly to federal court to challenge  the legality of the rule.  Id. \n§ 1395cc(h)(1)(B).   Far from a “complete preclusion” of review, the Medicare statute sets forth an \norderly procedure for parties to contest the legality  of sanctions  that the Secretary would seek to \nimpose on them.  See Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 19.    \nIt is true, of course, that State governments are not “dissatisfied” “institution[s]  or agenc[ies]” \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h)(1),  and thus the States themselves  could not use that \nstatute’s  vehicle  for judicial  review, although individual state-operated facilities  could do so if they \nfaced a sanction.  But the same point was true of the association that was the plaintiff in Illinois Council, \nand the Supreme Court held that that was immaterial.   It is the “rights to review” of health  care \nfacilities  subject to the vaccination  rule “that are at stake,” and “the statutes  that create the special \nreview channel  adequately  protect those  rights.”   529 U.S. at 24.  Health  care facilities  that  are \naggrieved by the enforcement of the vaccination rule may seek review of that rule after following the \njurisdictional  requirements of § 405(h).  State governments, however, may not skip the jurisdictional \nrequirements to litigate on their behalf.6   \n                                              \n6  At all events, the Plaintiffs’  claims against President Biden must be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction,  because  the  courts  have  “no  jurisdiction  of  a bill  to  enjoin  the  President  in  the \nperformance of his official duties.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992). \n19 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 34 of 66 PageID #: 377\nII.  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR \nCLAIMS. \nA.  CMS has statutory authority for the rule. \nAs noted above, the Secretary has broad authority under the Social Security Act to issue such \nregulations “as may be necessary  to the efficient administration  of the functions with which” he is \ncharged under the Act.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(a).  The Medicare statute further confirms this authority by \ndirecting  the  Secretary  to  “prescribe  such  regulations  as  may  be  necessary  to  carry  out  the \nadministration of the insurance programs under” that statute.  Id. § 1395hh(a)(1).  Binding Supreme \nCourt and Eighth Circuit case law confirms the extent of the Secretary’s authority under these statutes.  \nAddressing similar enabling language in other statutes,  the Supreme Court has concluded that this \nlanguage grants the agency “broad authority.”  Mourning v. Family Publ’ns Serv., Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 365 \n(1973) (quotation marks omitted).  More specifically, “[w]here the empowering provision of a statute \nstates simply that the agency may ‘make . . . such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry \nout the  provisions  of this  Act,’”  the  Court held  that  “the  validity  of a regulation  promulgated \nthereunder  will be sustained  so long as it is  ‘reasonably  related to the  purposes of the enabling \nlegislation.’”  Id. at 369 (quoting Thorpe v. Hous. Auth. of City of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 280-81 (1969)).   \nApplying this standard, the Supreme Court has recognized that § 1302(a) confers “broad rule-\nmaking powers . . . in substantially  the same language” as the rulemaking provision in the cases cited \nabove.  Thorpe, 393 U.S. at 277 n.28; see also Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S. 132, 140 n.8 (1982) (same).  Because \nthe rulemaking provision of the Social Security Act, § 1302(a), contains essentially  the same terms as \nwere at issue in Mourning and Thorpe, the Eighth Circuit applies the same “reasonably related” standard \nin reviewing an attack on the Secretary’s authority to promulgate regulations under § 1302(a).  See Ark. \nPharmacists Ass’n v. Harris, 627 F.2d 867, 870 (8th Cir. 1980); Leimbach v. Califano, 596 F.2d 300, 304 \n(8th Cir. 1979); see also Ark. State Bank Comm’r v. Resol. Tr. Corp., 911 F.2d 161, 170 (8th Cir. 1990). \nThe  vaccination  rule  is comfortably within  the  Secretary’s  statutory  authority  under  this \nstandard.  As noted above, Congress created both the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a means to \nprovide health  care to the populations covered under each program.  See Good Samaritan Hosp., 508 \n20 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 35 of 66 PageID #: 378\nU.S. at 404; see also 42 U.S.C. § 1396-1.  The purpose of providing health  care services  to these \npopulations, of course, is to advance and maintain patients’ health, not to harm them.  It is therefore \nunsurprising that Congress has taken care to instruct the Secretary to administer these programs in a \nway that ensures that the health and safety of patients are protected.  Throughout the Medicare statute, \nCongress has charged the Secretary to use the various tools at his disposal to ensure that health care \nproviders do not cause harm to their patients.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a) (instructing  the Secretary \nto impose any conditions on facilities found to be noncompliant that he “finds necessary in the interest \nof health and safety of individuals who are furnished care or services” at the facility); id. § 1396a(a)(36) \n(same); id. § 1395bb(c) (instructing  the Secretary to deem facilities  ineligible for participation if they \nare found to be in violation of health and safety regulations); id. § 1395bbb(b) (imposing duty on the \nSecretary to assure “the enforcement of such conditions and requirements are adequate to protect the \nhealth and safety of individuals under the care of a home health agency”). \nOf particular relevance  here, numerous provisions throughout the Medicare and Medicaid \nstatutes charge the Secretary with the responsibility to issue regulations, as he deems necessary,  that \ncondition health care facilities’ eligibility for the Medicare and Medicaid programs on those facilities’ \nability to protect the health and safety of their patients while those patients are receiving care that is \nfunded by either program.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9) (defining a “hospital” as an institution \nwhich, among other things,  “meets such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary  in the \ninterest  of the health  and safety of individuals  who are furnished  services  in the institution”);  id. \n§ 1395i-3(d)(4)(B) (“A skilled nursing facility must meet such other requirements relating to the health, \nsafety, and well-being of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find \nnecessary.”);  id. § 1395i-3(f)(1) (instructing  the Secretary to ensure that regulatory requirements  for \nskilled nursing facilities “are adequate to protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of residents”).7     \n                                              \n7  See also 42 U.S.C. § 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i)  (requiring ambulatory surgical centers to meet “health, \nsafety, and other standards specified by the Secretary in regulations”); id. §§ 1395x(dd)(2)(G) (requiring \nhospice programs to meet “such other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest \nof the health  and safety of the individuals  who are provided care and services  by such  agency or \norganization”);  1395x(o)(6)  (requiring  home health  agencies  to  meet “such  other  conditions  of \n21 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 36 of 66 PageID #: 379\nAs the Eighth Circuit held last month, these provisions of the Medicare and Medicaid statutes \noperate “capaciously,” and “are broadly worded to give HHS significant leeway in deciding how best \nto safeguard [patients’] health and safety and protect their dignity and rights.”  Northport Health Servs. \nof Arkansas, LLC v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 14 F.4th 856, 870 (8th Cir. 2021) (discussing \n§ 1395i-3(f)(1)).  The statutes thus accord the Secretary the authority, and the responsibility, to impose \nconditions  of participation  on health  care facilities  so as to protect patients’  health  and safety—a \nresponsibility that has taken on paramount importance since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nThe Secretary, at least, reasonably understood his authority to encompass this responsibility,  and that \nunderstanding is entitled to deference from this Court.  See id.   \n The Plaintiffs  do not dispute that  a rule requiring  the vaccination  of health  care facility \nemployees protects the “health and safety” of those facilities’  patients, as those words are ordinarily \nunderstood.  Instead, they invoke the doctrine of noscitur a sociis to contend that, given the detail with \nwhich Congress addressed other standards in these statutes, the statutes’ failure to expressly address \nvaccinations  means that Congress intended to deny the Secretary the authority to find vaccination \nrequirements to be necessary to protect the health and safety of patients.  Br. at 26-27.  But that canon \n“may only be used where words are of obscure or doubtful meaning.”  Iverson v. United States, 973 F.3d \n                                              \nparticipation as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals \nwho are furnished services by such agency or organization[.]”);  1395x(p)(4)(A)(v),  (B) (providers of \noutpatient physical therapy services must meet “such other conditions relating to the health and safety \nof individuals  who are furnished  services  by such  clinic  or agency on an outpatient  basis, as the \nSecretary  may  find  necessary”);  1395x(aa)(2)(K)  (rural  health  clinics  must  meet  “such  other \nrequirements  as the  Secretary  may find necessary  in the  interest  of the  health  and safety  of the \nindividuals  who are  furnished  services  by  the  clinic”);  1395x(cc)(2)(J)  (requiring  comprehensive \noutpatient rehabilitation facilities to meet “such other conditions of participation as the Secretary may \nfind necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services by such \nfacility”); 1395x(ff)(3)(B)(iv) (community mental health center must meet “such additional conditions \nas the Secretary shall  specify  to ensure  the health  and safety  of individuals  being furnished  such \nservices”);  1395x(iii)(3)(D)(i)(IV)  (qualified home infusion therapy supplier must meet “such other \nrequirements  as the Secretary  determines appropriate”); 1395rr(b)(1)(A)  (providers of services  for \nindividuals  with end-stage renal  disease  must meet “such  requirements  as the Secretary  shall  by \nregulation  prescribe”); 1395eee(f)(4)  (authorizing  regulations  “to ensure  the  health  and safety  of \nindividuals enrolled in a PACE program”); 1395i-4(e)(3) (requiring critical  access hospitals  to meet \n“such other criteria as the Secretary may require”); 1396d(d)(1) (requiring intermediate care facilities \nfor individuals  with intellectual  disabilities  to meet “such  standards as may be prescribed by the \nSecretary”); 1396d(h)(1) (incorporating for psychiatric residential  treatment facilities,  through cross-\nreferenced statutes, the health and safety requirements for hospitals under § 1395x(f)). \n22 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 37 of 66 PageID #: 380\n843, 853 (8th Cir. 2020) (citing Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 514, 520 (1923)).  Here, \nwhere the words “health” and “safety” have “a character of [their] own” that plainly encompasses the \navoidance of a deadly disease, the canon has no application.  Russell Motor Car Co., 261 U.S. at 519.  \nAnd, in any event, this canon “is a feeble helper in an administrative setting, particularly when, as here, \n[the Plaintiffs]  point[] to no evidence suggesting that Congress considered the unnamed possibility \nand meant to say no to it.”  Northport Health, 14 F.4th at 871 (citations and internal quotations omitted).   \nFor this reason, the Plaintiffs’  reliance on Alabama Association of Realtors v. Department of Health \n& Human Services, 141 S. Ct. 2485 (2021), is misplaced.  The Supreme Court in that case rejected the \nissuance of a national eviction moratorium by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under \na far different provision of the Public Health Service Act, reasoning that a “downstream connection \nbetween eviction and the interstate spread of disease is markedly different from the direct targeting of \ndisease that characterizes the measures identified in [that] statute.”  Id. at 2488.  The Secretary here is \nnot seeking to regulate the “downstream” effects of the pandemic.  Rather, the statutes directly instruct \nhim to protect the health and safety of beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while \nthose  individuals  are  receiving  care that  is  paid for by either  program.  Because  the  Secretary \ndetermined that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 poses a unique threat to patients’ health and safety in \nthese settings,  he discharged his statutory responsibility  by issuing  his vaccination  rule.  See generally \nMerck & Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 962 F.3d 531, 537-38 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (distinguishing, \nfor purposes of Sections 1302 and 1395hh, between an invalid rule with only “a hoped-for trickle-\ndown effect on the regulated programs” and a valid rule that has “an actual and discernible nexus \nbetween the rule and the conduct or management of Medicare and Medicaid programs”).8  \nFinally, the Plaintiffs contend that the rule violates 42 U.S.C. § 1395, in that the Secretary has \n                                              \n8  The Plaintiffs also attempt to invoke the nondelegation doctrine to contend that Congress \ncould not lawfully delegate to the Secretary the authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare \nand Medicaid patients.  Br. at 27.  As the Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge, a “statutory delegation is \nconstitutional  as long as Congress lays down by legislative  act an intelligible  principle to which the \nperson or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform.”  Bhatti v. Fed. \nHous. Fin. Agency, 15 F.4th 848, 854 (8th Cir. 2021) (internal quotations and alterations omitted).  The \nSecretary’s statutory authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients easily \nmeets this minimal standard.   \n23 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 38 of 66 PageID #: 381\npurportedly asserted control over the selection of health care facility employees or the administration \nof health  care institutions.   This assertion  misconstrues  the nature of the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, and of the vaccination rule.  Health care facilities  “voluntarily participate in the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs,” and if they choose to do so, they “must comply with the [Secretary’s health \nand safety regulations] as the price of admission to obtain federal funding.”  Northport Health, 14 F.4th \nat 869 n.5.  Those conditions  on federal funding have long included detailed rules addressing the \nqualifications  of employees at health care facilities.  See, e.g., 42 C.FR. § 482.22 (standards for medical \nstaff at  hospitals).   The  Secretary’s  vaccination  rule,  like  these  other rules  addressing  employee \nqualifications, ensures that federal funds are used only to pay for the purposes that Congress intended.  \nBecause the vaccination rule is not a legal mandate, but instead a condition imposed on the payment \nof federal funds, the rule does not assert “control” over the administration of institutions.   See Goodman \nv. Sullivan, 891 F.2d 449, 451 (2d Cir. 1989) (“The regulation does not actually direct or prohibit any \nkind of treatment or diagnosis.  It only refuses subsequent Medicare reimbursement for certain kinds \nof services.”); see also Am. Acad. of Ophthalmology, Inc. v. Sullivan, 998 F.2d 377, 387 (6th Cir. 1993).    \nB.  The rule is the product of reasoned decisionmaking. \nThe Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary acted arbitrarily by issuing a rule to protect the health \nand safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients.  This Court reviews this claim under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), \nwhich  provides  that  the  Secretary’s  findings,  “if  supported  by  substantial  evidence,  shall  be \nconclusive.”   Even if this  statute  incorporates  the  Administrative  Procedure Act’s  standard  for \narbitrary-and-capricious review, but see Estate of Morris v. Shalala, 207 F.3d 744, 745 (5th Cir. 2000), that \nstandard is easily met here. \nThe APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard “is a highly  deferential  standard of review.”  \nAdventist Health Sys./SunBelt, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., — F.4th —, No. 21-1589, 2021 \nWL 5170810, at *7 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2021).  The courts “defer to agency action so long as an agency \nexamined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action.”  Id. (citation and \nalterations omitted).  “A court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Id. (citation and \nalterations omitted).  “This is particularly true when the resolution of the dispute involves primarily \n24 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 39 of 66 PageID #: 382\nissues of fact and analysis of the relevant information requires a high level of technical expertise by an \nagency acting within its sphere of expertise.”  Id. (citation  and alterations  omitted).  In short, the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard simply “requires that agency action be reasonable and reasonably \nexplained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021). \nThe Secretary considered all the relevant factors, and reasonably explained his decision, when \nhe issued his rule to protect Medicare and Medicaid patients from the transmission  of a deadly virus \nat facilities funded by these programs.  The APA requires nothing more.   \nProtection of the Health and Safety of Medicare and Medicaid Patients.  As explained above, the Social \nSecurity Act assigns to the Secretary the primary responsibility  to protect the health and safety of \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries while those individuals are receiving care from facilities that are \nfunded by either program.  The Secretary reasonably considered the available evidence to conclude \nthat  his  vaccination  rule  would  protect  these  patients’  health  and  safety;  indeed,  the  record \noverwhelmingly points to this conclusion.   \nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is highly transmissible,  and extremely dangerous. 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,556-57.   By the time this rule was promulgated, it had caused the deaths of at least 720,000 \npeople in the United States, including at least 1,900 health care workers.  Id. at 61,556, 61,569.  It has \nhospitalized at least 3 million people.  Id. at 61,556.  In short, it is “the deadliest disease in American \nhistory.”  Id.  \nGiven the virulence of this virus, it is easily transmitted among health care workers, and from \nhealth care workers to patients,  in health  care facilities.   86 Fed. Reg at 61,557 n.16.  Unvaccinated \nhealth  care workers are highly  susceptible to transmitting  the virus to their colleagues and to their \npatients.  Id. at 61,558 n.42.  Patients in facilities funded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs are \nmore likely than the general population to suffer severe illness or death from COVID-19.  Id. at 61,609.  \nFor these reasons, the Secretary concluded, “the available evidence for ongoing healthcare-associated \nCOVID-19 transmission  risk is sufficiently  alarming in and of itself to compel CMS to take action.”  \nId. at 61,558. \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to the medical care that they need is jeopardized \n25 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 40 of 66 PageID #: 383\nby low rates of vaccination among health  care workers at facilities  funded by these programs.  Id.  \nPatients in these programs have refused care from unvaccinated staff, or have forgone care altogether, \nto avoid contracting SARS-CoV-2 from health care workers.  Id.  Absenteeism from health care staff \nas a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness has also contributed to staffing shortages \nthat disrupt patient access to recommended care.  Id. at 61,559.     \nThe effects have been compounded by the emergence this summer of the Delta variant.  Id.  \nIn  particular,  cases  among long-term care  facility  and end-stage  renal  disease  facility  staff  have \nincreased by over 1400 percent and 850 percent, respectively,  since the Delta variant emerged.  Id.  \nBetween June and September 2021, daily cases of COVID-19 increased  over 1200 percent,  new \nhospital admissions for patients with COVID-19 increased over 600 percent, and daily deaths from \nCOVID-19 increased over 800 percent.  Id. at 61,583.  The vast majority of cases during this time \nperiod were among the unvaccinated population.  Id.    \nWhat is more, the evidence points to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases over the next several \nweeks.  Id. at 61,584.  There was a large spike in cases during the winter of 2020, demonstrating that \nCOVID-19 follows seasonal  patterns  that are common for other respiratory virus infections.   Id.  \nThere is strong reason to fear that SARS-CoV-2 will be exceptionally virulent during this period, as a \nsevere 2021-2022 winter influenza  season is anticipated,  and the interaction  between SARS-CoV-2 \nand the influenza virus may lead to worse outcomes over the next several months.  Id. at 61,584  n.190.  \nThe  Secretary  accordingly  reasoned that  “it is  imperative  that  the  risk  for healthcare-associated \nCOVID-19 transmission be minimized during the influenza season.”  Id. at 61,584.        \nFortunately,  the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved or authorized for use in the \nUnited States are safe, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,562, and are highly effective in preventing serious outcomes \nof COVID-19, including hospitalization  and death, id. at 61,565 n.115.  These vaccines continue to \noffer strong protection against known variants of the virus, including  the Delta variant, particularly \nagainst hospitalization and death.  Id. at 61,565 n.116.   \nRecent  studies also show that the vaccines are highly  effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection among frontline workers.  Id. at 61,585 n.205.  Studies have shown that vaccinated people \n26 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 41 of 66 PageID #: 384\nwith breakthrough  infections  may be less  infectious  than  unvaccinated  individuals  with primary \ninfections, resulting in fewer opportunities for transmission.   Id. at 61,558 n.37.   \nIn short, as the Secretary recognized, the available scientific evidence overwhelmingly points \nto the conclusion  that the  virus that causes COVID-19 is extremely dangerous for Medicare and \nMedicaid patients,  and  that  vaccinations  of health  care  staff  are  highly  effective  in  preventing \ntransmission  among health  care  workers, and  from health  care workers to their  patients.   The \nSecretary, at minimum, reasonably reached this conclusion, and took action on that basis to fulfill his \nstatutory  responsibility  to protect  the  health  and safety  of program beneficiaries  while they  are \nreceiving care that these programs pay for.  The APA requires nothing more than that.  See Prometheus \nRadio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.       \nStaff Shortages in Health Care Facilities.  The Secretary also reasonably concluded that high rates \nof transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among health care staff have contributed to a shortage of health care \nworkers, and that his vaccination rule would alleviate this problem.  As noted above, many health care \nworkers have missed work due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and these absences have disrupted patient \naccess to care.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,559.  There have been at least 500,000 reported COVID-19 cases, \nand at least 1,900 reported COVID-19 deaths, among health care staff; and the true figures are likely \nmuch higher.  Id.  And the rate of infection among health care staff has increased dramatically with \nthe rise of the Delta variant.  Id.  These trends are driven by health care staff vaccination  rates that \nremain too low to protect staff and patients  from the  virus.  Id.  The Secretary  thus reasonably \nconcluded and fully explained that the rule would serve to alleviate personnel shortages at health care \nfacilities. Id. at 61,569-70. \nThe Plaintiffs protest that they predict that a substantial  portion of health care workers will \nchoose to leave their jobs rather than be vaccinated, thereby threatening  the operation of health care \nfacilities.   Br. at 16.  The Secretary considered this  possibility  and rejected it, after reviewing the \nempirical evidence that has developed in recent months with regard to the effect of government-\nimposed or privately-imposed vaccination requirements.   \nNumerous health systems and individual health care employers throughout the country have \n27 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 42 of 66 PageID #: 385\nimplemented  COVID-vaccine  requirements.   86 Fed  Reg. at  61,566.  These  policies  have  been \noverwhelmingly successful, even among health care workers who were previously hesitant  to obtain \nvaccination.  Id.  For example, after Houston Methodist implemented a vaccination requirement for \npractitioners  at its facilities,  it achieved  a 99% compliance rate with that  requirement  among its \nemployees and physicians.   Id. at 61,566 n.131 (citing  Todd Ackerman, Houston Methodist  Requires \nCOVID-19 Vaccine for Credentialed  Doctors (June  8, 2021), https://www.houstonmethodist.org/leading-\nmedicine-blog/articles/2021/jun/houston-methodist-requires-covid-19-vaccine-for-credentialed-doctors/).   \nNovant Health, similarly, achieved 98.6% compliance with its mandatory vaccination requirement for \nits staff.  Id. at 61,566 n.132 (citing Novant Health Update on Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Program \nfor  Employees  (Sept.  21,  2021),  https://www.novanthealth.org/home/about-us/newsroom/press-\nreleases/newsid33987/2576/novant-health-update-on-mandatory-covid-19-vaccination-program-for-employees.aspx).  \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ claim that “CMS did not reference data on any past efforts to mandate COVID-\n19 vaccines in rural areas,” Br. at 18, Novant Health in fact operates numerous hospitals, physician \nclinics,  and urgent care centers,  including several in rural North Carolina.  See, e.g., Novant Health, \nUrgent Care Locations, https://www.novanthealth.org/home/patients--visitors/locations/urgent-care-\nlocations.aspx (last visited Nov. 20, 2021). \nThe State of New York also reported a 92% compliance rate with its vaccine requirement, for \nall 650,000 hospital and nursing home workers in that state, a figure which plainly accounts for the \nrural areas of New York as well.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569 n.159 (citing New York Times, Thousands of \nN.Y. Healthcare Workers Get Vaccinated Ahead of Deadline (Sept. 28, 2021)).  Additional operators of more \nthan 250 long-term care facilities around the country have achieved greater than 95%, and in some \ncases 100%, vaccination  rates after imposing their  own requirements.   Id. at 61,569 n.158 (citing \nEzekiel J. Emanuel and David J. Skorton, Mandating COVID-19 Vaccination for Health Care Workers, \nAnnals of Internal Medicine (Sept. 2021), http://doi.org/10.7326/M21-3150).   \nOn  the  basis  of this  evidence,  a  coalition  of  more than  fifty  professional  health  care \nassociations, including the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and the \nNational Association for Home Care and Hospice concluded that vaccination requirements are in the \n28 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 43 of 66 PageID #: 386\nbest interest  of their memberships, of patients,  and of health care facilities.   86 Fed. Reg. at 61,565.   \nA leading national  association  of long-term care providers also concluded that acceptance  of the \nvaccine would be high among the staff of its members’ facilities and urged the issuance of a rule that \nwould require vaccination.  Id.        \nThe Secretary recognized that there was some uncertainty  as to how many employees would \nleave their jobs as a result of a vaccination rule, but concluded that it was more likely that any such \neffect would be more than offset by reduced staff absenteeism from a reduction in illnesses,  as well as \na return to work of employees who have stayed out of the workforce for fear of contracting SARS-\nCoV-2.  Id. at 61,608.  These effects would be dwarfed, however, by the ordinary degree of churn in \nthe market of labor in the health care industry.  In any given year, it is typical for about 2.66 million \nemployees in health care settings to be new hires, in comparison to a total workforce of 10.4 million \nemployees.  Id.  Health care providers are accustomed to regularly finding and replacing employees, \nand there is no reason to believe that the need to find staffing will be noticeably more onerous as a \nresult  of the  vaccination  rule,  even  if  some  unvaccinated  health  care  workers leave  for other \nemployment and some vaccinated workers seek jobs in health care facilities.  Id.    \nIn sum, after reviewing the real-world evidence of the success of vaccination requirements to \ndate, the  Secretary  predicted that  his  rule  would “result  in  nearly  all  health  care workers being \nvaccinated.”  Id. at 61,569.  The Eighth Circuit has long held that “[j]udicial deference to agency action \nis ‘especially important’ when [an] agency’s judgments are ‘predictive.’”  Citizens Telecomms. Co. of Minn., \nLLC v. FCC, 901 F.3d 991, 1010 (8th Cir. 2018) (quoting Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 153 F.3d 523, 547 \n(8th Cir. 1998)); see also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 521 (2009); Newspaper Ass’n of \nAm. v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 734 F.3d 1208, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“When, as here, an agency is making \n‘predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule,’ we are particularly loath to second-\nguess its analysis.”) (citation omitted). \nAsserted Reliance Interests.  The Plaintiffs also argue that the Secretary failed to take into account \nthe reliance interests of health care facilities and their workers.  Br. at 16.  To the contrary, as discussed \nabove, the Secretary directly took into account the costs that employers and some employees would \n29 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 44 of 66 PageID #: 387\nincur under the rule.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,607-10.  He concluded, however, that the benefits far \noutweighed the costs.  He calculated that any combination of 120 lives saved, or 600 hospitalizations \nprevented, would result in the benefits of the rule outweighing its costs.  Id. at 61,612.  The lives saved \nunder the rule will probably be “many times higher” than that threshold.  Id.  Although these estimates \nare subject to some uncertainty,  “total lives saved under this rule may well reach several hundred a \nmonth or perhaps several thousand a month.”  Id.   \nNothing in the APA required the Secretary to weigh any costs under the rule more heavily in \nthis analysis.  The Plaintiffs claim that they relied on the Secretary’s May 2021 rule, which had not yet \nrequired vaccinations  in health  care facilities,  in their  hiring  of “workforces without concern  for \nvaccination.”  Br. at 20.  But that rule expressly required education on COVID-19 vaccines and the \nprovision of vaccines in nursing homes, so it strains credulity to conclude that the rule encouraged \nemployers or employees to forgo vaccination.  That rule, moreover, was plainly described as just “one \nstep in the broad effort to support those individuals at higher risk,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 26,308 (emphasis \nadded), and the Secretary explained that comments submitted in response to that rule “will help inform \nfuture CMS actions.”  Id.  The Secretary did not, in his rule issued six months earlier, in any way \ndisclaim the  possibility  of additional  regulation  to protect the  health  and safety of Medicare and \nMedicaid patients from SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, as circumstances  developed.  And, when he \nissued  the  rule  at issue  in  this  case,  he  reasonably  explained  that,  although  he  had previously \nencouraged but did not require vaccinations,  the continued low rates of vaccination  uptake among \nhealth care workers and the concerns of the coming danger to Medicare and Medicaid patients in the \nwinter months had cause him to reconsider that policy.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583-84.   \nBut even assuming any reliance interests were at issue here, the Secretary “reasonably explained \nthe departure from CMS’s prior policy in spite of those reliance interests.”  Northport Health, 14 F.4th \nat  876.    “[A]n  agency  need  only  provide  a  reasoned  explanation  for  disregarding  facts  and \ncircumstances  that  underlay or were engendered by the prior policy,” id. (citation  and alterations \nomitted), a standard that was easily met here.  \nFederalism Concerns.  The Plaintiffs also incorrectly contend that the Secretary did not consider \n30 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 45 of 66 PageID #: 388\nthe rule’s impact on state sovereignty.   Br. at 20-21.  In fact, he specifically  acknowledged that he \nneeded to consider  federalism concerns  under  Executive  Order 13132,  86 Fed.  Reg. at 61,613, \nrecognized that his rule “would pre-empt some State laws that prohibit employers from requiring their \nemployees to be vaccinated for COVID-19,” id., and determined that it was still necessary to establish \nthe rule as the “minimum regulatory action necessary to achieve the objectives of the statute.”  Id.  He \ndetermined that the “contagion rates of the existing strains of coronavirus and their disproportionate \nimpacts on Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries,” necessitated that a vaccine mandate be imposed so \nas “to promote and protect patient health and safety.”  Id.  That was more than sufficient consideration \nof the federalism concerns.  The Plaintiffs’  position that protecting the public health and mandatory \nvaccinations  “‘do not ordinarily concern  the national  government,’”  Br. at 20 (quoting  Jacobson  v. \nMassachusetts,  197 U.S. 11, 38 (1905)), ignores the Secretary’s responsibility  to ensure the health and \nsafety of Medicare and Medicaid patients while they are receiving care at facilities  funded by those \nprograms.    \nThe Risk of Reinfection  in Previously Infected Individuals.  The Plaintiffs next fault the Secretary for \nhis purported failure to consider whether to exempt individuals who were previously infected with the \nCOVID-19 virus from the scope of his rule.  Br. at 21.  They cite a study of patients in Israel, which \nreported a finding of high levels of immunity for previously-infected individuals.  Id.  Contrary to their \nclaims, the Secretary directly considered the issue of “natural immunity” in general, and their cited \nstudy  in  particular,  but  he concluded  that  the  weight  of the  scientific  evidence  pointed against \nexempting individuals with prior infections. \nThe  Secretary  concluded  that  infection-induced  immunity  is  not  equivalent  to receiving \nvaccination  for COVID-19, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,559, and that, even among those persons with prior \nSARS-CoV-2 infections,  vaccination  provides strong protection against  reinfection.   Id. at 61,585 \nn.205.  Among persons previously infected with the virus, people who remain unvaccinated after that \ninfection are more than twice as likely to be reinfected, as compared to fully vaccinated people.  See \nCavanaugh, et al., 70 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report at 1081.  The Secretary accordingly \nfollowed the recommendations of CDC, which has found that the best academic evidence supports \n31 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 46 of 66 PageID #: 389\nthe benefits of vaccination for all people, regardless of their infection history.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560.   \nIn particular, CDC found on the basis of a comprehensive review of the academic literature \nthat,  among previously  infected  individuals,  “[n]umerous  immunologic  studies  have  consistently \nshown that vaccination of individuals who were previously infected enhances their immune response, \nand growing epidemiologic evidence indicates that vaccination following infection further reduces the \nrisk of subsequent  infection,  including  in the  setting  of increased  circulation  of more infectious \nvariants.”  Id. at 61,560 n.70 (citing CDC, Interim Clinical Considerations  for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines \nCurrently Approved or Authorized in the United States, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-\nconsiderations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#CoV-19-vaccination).    \nIn reaching this conclusion, CDC engaged in a comprehensive review of studies on the subject, \nincluding the Israeli study cited by the Plaintiffs  as well as a more recent analysis  that critiqued the \nmethodology of that study; the later analysis found that the Israeli study had only considered short-\nterm effects of infection,  and that  over a longer period, “there  was a 5.5 times  higher  odds of \nlaboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among previously infected patients  than  among fully vaccinated \npatients.”  Science Brief: SARS-CoV-2 Infection-induced  and Vaccine-induced  Immunity (citing Catherine H. \nBozio, et al., Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 Among Adults Hospitalized with COVID-19–Like Illness with \nInfection-Induced or mRNA Vaccine-Induced SARS-CoV-2 Immunity — Nine States, January–September 2021, \n70  Morbidity  and  Mortality  Weekly  Report  1539  (Oct.  29,  2021), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html) \n(linked to in Interim Clinical Considerations  for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines Currently Approved or Authorized \nin the United States, cited at 86 Fed. Reg. 61,560 n.70, and accessible by clicking hyperlinked “studies” \nunder “COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection: People with prior or current SARS-CoV-\n2 infection”).  \nBecause the overall weight of the scientific evidence pointed in favor of increased benefits of \nvaccinations  of previously  infected  individuals,  the  Secretary  reasonably  chose  not  to create  an \nexemption for these persons.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614.  That easily  satisfies  the standards of APA \nreview.    In  reviewing  agency  action,  it  “is  generally  not  for the  judicial  branch  to  undertake \n32 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 47 of 66 PageID #: 390\ncomparative evaluations of conflicting scientific evidence.”  Bellion Spirits, LLC v. United States, 335 F. \nSupp. 3d 32, 42 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’'d, 7 F.4th 1201 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (citation omitted).  Moreover, the \nSecretary reasoned, an exemption would have raised complex issues of administrability, including, but \nnot limited to, developing a methodology to evaluate the declining levels of antibodies over time in \npreviously  infected  persons.    86 Fed.  Reg.  at  61,614.    The  Secretary  reasonably  declined  that \nundertaking.     \nAllegedly Post-Hoc Reasoning.  Nor can the Plaintiffs succeed on their claim that the vaccination \nrule amounts to a “post hoc rationalization.”  Br. at 22.  In reviewing agency action, “a court is ordinarily \nlimited to evaluating the agency’s contemporaneous explanation in light of the existing administrative \nrecord.”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2573 (2019).  The Secretary provided a \ncomprehensive statement of the reasons supporting his issuance of the rule, at the time that he did so.  \nThis statement provides the “contemporaneous explanation” for the issuance  of the rule.  Camp v. \nPitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973).  This case is entirely unlike the agency’s justification  in Department of \nHomeland Security v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1909 (2020)—the only case cited by \nthe Plaintiffs—which  involved an agency memorandum created far after the predicate action took \nplace.   \nThe Scope of the Rule.  Finally, the Plaintiffs contend that the rule is overly broad, either because \nit should have applied only to facilities that care for the elderly and infirm, or because the rule should \nhave exempted personnel without direct contact with patients.  Br. at 22.  The Secretary reasonably \nexplained his policy choices on both scores. \nThe Plaintiffs assert that the rule “reaches categories of healthcare facilities, such as Psychiatric \nResidential Treatment Facilities (“PRTFs”) for individuals under age 21, that are not related to CMS’s \nasserted interest in protecting elderly and infirm patients from COVID-19.”  Id.  But that misstates \nthe Secretary’s interest;  nowhere in the rule did he claim that his statutory responsibilities  extended \nonly to the elderly or infirm.  Instead,  his statutory responsibility—and  his asserted interest—is  to \nprotect the health and safety of each of the patient populations at health care facilities covered by this \nrule.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(h)(1) (incorporating for psychiatric  residential  treatment  facilities, \n33 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 48 of 66 PageID #: 391\nthrough  cross-referenced  statutes,  the  health  and  safety  requirements  for  hospitals  under \n§ 1395x(e)(9)).   And he reasonably concluded that individuals  in congregate care settings,  such as \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities, are at greater risk of acquiring infections, including infection \nwith the virus that causes COVID-19.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,575.  He also noted the danger of cross-\ntransmission of the virus, since staff at certain facilities may work across facility types.  Id.  Residents \nof these  facilities  also  may  have  difficulty  adhering  to  alternative  protocols  used  to  limit  the \ntransmission  of the virus.  Id.  In addition to this discussion  of the risks posed in these particular \nfacilities, the Secretary explained his rationale for extending the rule to each of the types of providers \nthat are subject to its requirements.  See id. at 61,575-83.   \nThe Plaintiffs also contend that the rule is overbroad because it requires the vaccination of all \nstaff that  may come into contact  with others at the site of care.  Br. at 22.  But far from being \n“inexplicable,” id., the Secretary explained at length why these personnel should be covered by the \nvaccination requirements.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,570-71.  He concluded that these persons may \n“encounter fellow employees, such as in an administrative office or at an off-site staff meeting, who \nwill themselves enter a health care facility or site of care for their job responsibilities[.]”   Id. at 61,568. \nGiven the high transmissibility  of the virus and demonstrated rates of transmission of the virus among \nhealth care workers, this conclusion was eminently reasonable.  See id. at 61,557.  The Secretary elected \nto exempt persons who perform only infrequent tasks at health care facilities, and directed providers \nto consider  “frequency  of presence,  services  provided, and  proximity to patients  and staff”  in \nevaluating which of their employees would be covered under the rule.  Id. at 61,571.  He considered a \nbroader exemption to “exclud[e] individual staff members who are present at the site of care less \nfrequently  than once per week from these vaccination  requirements,  but [was] concerned that this \nmight lead to confusion or fragmented care.”  Id. at 61570-71. Accordingly, the rule provides strong \nprotection  to patients  by requiring  the  vaccinations  of health  care providers and personnel  who \ninteract with patients directly, along with staff who pose a danger of indirect transmission of the virus.9   \n                                              \n9 At the same time, the rule exempts from the vaccine requirements those staff who “telework \n34 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 49 of 66 PageID #: 392\nUltimately, the Plaintiffs’ argument boils down to a dispute over where to draw the line with \na vaccination  requirement.   But an agency “is not required to identify the optimal threshold  with \npinpoint precision.   It is only required to identify the standard and explain its relationship  to the \nunderlying regulatory concerns.”  WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 238 F.3d 449, 461-62 (D.C. Cir. 2001); see also \nExxonMobil Gas Mktg. Co. v. FERC, 297 F.3d 1071, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“We are generally ‘unwilling \nto review line-drawing performed by the Commission unless a petitioner can demonstrate that lines \ndrawn . . . are patently unreasonable, having no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.’”) \n(quoting Cassell v. FCC, 154 F.3d 478, 485 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).  Although the Plaintiffs would prefer for \nthe rule to cover fewer health care staff, the APA does not permit them to “substitute [their] policy \njudgment for that of the agency.” Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.  It was plainly reasonable \nfor the Secretary to pursue robust protection for patients by requiring vaccination of the categories of \nstaff set forth above, and reasonableness is all the APA requires.  See id. (“A court simply ensures that \nthe agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and . . . has reasonably considered the relevant \nissues and reasonably explained the decision.”). \nC.  The Secretary had good cause to issue the rule on an interim basis. \nThe Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their claim that the Secretary was required to follow \nnotice-and-comment  procedures before issuing  the rule.   Notice-and-comment rulemaking is not \nrequired “when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement \nof reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, \nunnecessary,  or contrary to the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(2)(C) \n(incorporating 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B)) into the Medicare statute).   This exception excuses notice and \ncomment in emergency situations,  or where delay could result in serious harm.  See Jifry v. FAA, 370 \nF.3d 1174, 1179 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  The Secretary’s finding here more than meets that standard. \nAs the Secretary explained, “a further delay in imposing a vaccine mandate would endanger \n                                              \nfull-time,” and vendors and other professionals who perform infrequent, non-healthcare services.  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,571.  CMS also found that  it would be “overly burdensome” to mandate that all \nproviders and suppliers ensure COVID-19 vaccination “for all individuals who enter the facility.”  Id.     \n35 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 50 of 66 PageID #: 393\nthe health and safety of additional patients and be contrary to the public interest.”   86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,584; see id. at 61,583, 61,586 (similar).  The Secretary found that any delay for a comment period \nwould be contrary to the public interest, given the “life-saving importance” of the rule, Council of S. \nMountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 573, 581 (D.C. Cir. 1981), just as the APA permits.  See also, e.g., \nNw. Airlines, Inc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 F.2d 1309, 1321 (8th Cir. 1981) (holding that the “urgent necessity \nfor rapid administrative action under the circumstances of the present case would justify the Secretary's \nfinding of ‘good cause’”).  If, as the Eighth Circuit held, the desire for smooth air travel “on the eve \nof the winter holiday season,” constitutes  “good cause” to implement an air traffic rule with a seven-\nday comment period, id., then  the urgent need  to protect the health  and safety of Medicare and \nMedicaid patients from a virus that has claimed more than 720,000 lives plainly suffices to waive the \nnotice-and-comment requirement as well.     \nThe Secretary reasonably determined that “[a]ny delay in the implementation of this rule would \nresult  in additional  deaths  and serious  illnesses  among health  care  staff and consumers,  further \nexacerbating the newly-arising, and ongoing, strain on the capacity of health care facilities to serve the \npublic.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.  In fact, he projected that the “total lives saved under this rule may \nwell reach several hundred a month or perhaps several thousand a month.”  Id. at 61,612; accord United \nStates v. Brewer, 766 F.3d 884, 890 (8th Cir. 2014) (recognizing that “the risk of future harm may, under \nsome circumstances,  justify a finding of good cause” where the risk is “more substantial than a mere \npossibility”).  See also Sorenson Comm’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (although good \ncause is rarely invoked, “we have approved an agency’s decision to bypass notice and comment where \ndelay would imminently threaten life”).    \nUnable to dispute these findings, the Plaintiffs simply ignore them.  This omission is of a piece \nwith the Plaintiffs’ failure to acknowledge the now more than 760,000 total lives lost to COVID-19 \nin the United States, or that COVID-19 continues to claim over 1,000 lives in this country every day.10  \n                                              \n10 See New York Times, Coronavirus in the US: Latest Map and Case Count (updated Nov. 17, 2021), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html  (stating  a daily average of 1,158 \ndeaths, 48,276 hospitalizations,  and 94,669 cases).  \n36 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 51 of 66 PageID #: 394\nBut the Eighth Circuit has long recognized that “considerations  of public health  and safety” may \nconstitute  good cause to waive notice and comment.  United States v. Gavrilovic, 551 F.2d 1099, 1105 \n(8th Cir. 1977).   The court recognized that “[a]s the degree of risk and the potential for harm increase \nthe need to provide immediate controls increases accordingly.  The issue is whether the need is so \ngreat and the emergency so defined that it justifies administrative rule making without according the \npublic the ordinary notice required by law.”  Id.  The COVID-19 pandemic is indeed a precisely \ndefined emergency.  Moreover, with COVID-19 being “the deadliest disease in American history,” 86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,556, “the degree of risk and potential for harm” yield a “need to provide immediate \ncontrols” of unparalleled  and (at the least)  sufficient  “greatness”  to clear the  good cause  hurdle.  \nGavrilovic, 551 F.2d at 1105; accord Hedge v. Lyng, 689 F. Supp. 884, 892–93 (D. Minn. 1987) (explaining \nthat “legitimate grounds” for invoking the good cause exception include “an urgency of conditions \ncoupled with a demonstrated and unavoidable limitations of time”) (citation omitted). \nBeyond reasonably concluding  and explaining  that  the need to prevent loss of additional \nhuman life justifies the immediate action here, the Secretary also detailed the nature of the emergency \nover the most recent several months  and reached reasonable  predictions about the nature of the \nemergency  over  the  coming  few  months.    He  explained  that  he  initially  chose  a  policy  of \n“encourag[ing] rather than mandat[ing] vaccination,” believing that a combination of other efforts and \nactions would be “adequate.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  However, despite all of these other efforts, id. \n“vaccine uptake among health  care staff” remains “insufficient  to protect the health and safety of \nindividuals  receiving  health  care  services  from Medicare- and  Medicaid-certified  providers  and \nsuppliers.”  Id.; see also id. at 61,559 (detailing average vaccination rates below 70% among health care \nstaff across different types of facilities).  This conclusion is supported by data “demonstrat[ing] SARS–\nCoV–2 transmissions between health-care workers and patients in hospitals, despite universal masking \nand other protocols.”  Id. at 61,585.  As a result, any delay of the rule “would contribute to additional \nnegative health outcomes for patients including loss of life.”  Id. at 61,584.    \nThe Secretary  also explained why the  advent of the Delta variant  requires  addressing the \ncurrently inadequate vaccination levels without delay.  Id. at 61,583.  As the Secretary explained, the \n37 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 52 of 66 PageID #: 395\nemergence of Delta in summer 2021 reversed the declines in cases, hospitalizations,  and deaths in the \nfirst half of the year, with daily cases increasing over 1200 percent, hospitalizations,  over 600 percent, \nand deaths, by nearly 800 percent, with the overwhelming majority occurring among individuals who \nwere not fully vaccinated.  Id.  These persistently  high hospitalization  rates, which are concentrated \namong the unvaccinated,  are, together  with “persistent  staffing shortages due, at least  in part, to \nCOVID-19 infection or quarantine  following exposure,” placing “tremendous strain” on the health \ncare system.  Id.  As of mid-October 2021, CDC had reported an estimated more than 500,000 cases \nand 1,900 deaths among health care staff, a likely underestimate.  Id. at 61,585.  Moreover, data shows \nthat cases among health care workers have “grown in tandem with broader national incidence trends \nsince the Delta variant’s emergence,” id.; among those healthcare staff for whom data was reported to \nthe CDC, cases “increased by nearly 600 percent between June and August 2021.”  Id.  As the Secretary \nexplained, “[b]ecause they are at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection and severe disease, \nunvaccinated  staff present  a risk of exacerbating  ongoing staffing  shortages—particularly  during \nperiods of community surges in SARS–CoV–2 infection,  when demand for health  care services is \nmost acute.”  Id. \nFurther, and based on available data, the Secretary reasonably predicted that a renewed surge, \nthe coming flu season, or a combination of the two will further exacerbate the strain on the health \ncare system.  See, e.g., Citizens  Telecoms.  Co. of Minn.,  LLC, 901 F.3d at 1010 (judicial  deference is \nparticularly important to an agency’s predictive judgments).  First, the Secretary identified “emerging \nindications  of potential increases”  in cases, “particularly [in] northern states where the weather has \nbegun  to  turn  colder,”  indications  which  are consistent  with  evidence  that  “[r]espiratory  virus \ninfections typically circulate more frequently during the winter months.” Id. at 61,584.11 \nSecond, the Secretary explained that the coming flu season “presents an additional threat to \npatient health and safety,” given that the interaction of the flu virus with the COVID-19 virus could \n                                              \n11 Although Plaintiffs assert that CMS’s claims of “emerging indications of potential increases” \nare “uncited” and “undocumented,” those indications were evident in the CDC COVID Data Tracker \ncited numerous times throughout the rule, including in this discussion. See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583-\n84 n.185. \n38 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 53 of 66 PageID #: 396\nlead to particularly severe outcomes for health care facility patients.  Id.  While he acknowledged that \nthe “intensity” of the coming flu season “cannot be predicted,” he identified “[s]everal factors” that \n“could make this flu season more severe.” Id. ( “return to school by children with no prior exposure \nto flu . . . , waning protection over time from previous seasonal influenza  vaccination, and the fact \nthat adult immunity . . . will now partly depend on exposure to viruses two or more seasons earlier”).  \nThe number of factors cited by the agency, and the likelihood of each occurring, raises the risk of a \nsevere flu season above “a mere possibility.” Brewer, 766 F.3d at 890 (cited in Br. at 34). \nMoreover, the  Secretary  cited “[p]reliminary  evidence  suggest[ing]  that  a combination  of \ninfections with influenza and SARS–CoV–2 would result in more severe health outcomes for patients \nthan either infection alone.”  Id.  He determined that the strain on the health care system produced by \nthe coincidence  of persistently  high (or rising)  COVID-19 cases  together with an imminent  and \npotentially  severe flu season would “adversely impact patient access to care and care quality” and, \ntherefore,  “it  is  imperative  that  the  risk  for healthcare-associated  COVID-19 transmission  be \nminimized during the influenza  season.”  Id.  Because flu incidence  is highest “between December \nthrough March” and “COVID-19 vaccines require time after administration for the body to build an \nimmune response,” he reasonably determined that “a staff COVID-19 vaccination requirement  for \nthe providers and suppliers identified in this rule cannot be further delayed.”  Id.  In this regard, and \ncontrary to the Plaintiffs’ suggestion, Br. at 33, the Secretary has “point[ed] to something specific that \nillustrates a particular harm that will be caused by the delay required for notice and comment.” Brewer, \n766 F.3dat 890 (citation  omitted).  Moreover, his invocation  of a renewed COVID-19 surge, the \ncoming flu season, or a combination of the two, are not merely recitations of the reasons for the rule, \ncontra Br. at 33; they are, rather, considered, supported reasons that the rule is necessary right now. \nBased on all of these reasons, and considering all of the available data, the Secretary determined \nthat “a further delay in imposing a vaccine mandate would endanger the health and safety of additional \npatients  and be contrary  to the  public  interest,”  id at  61,584; see  also  id.  at 61,586 (same),  and, \naccordingly, carried its burden of demonstrating that delay occasioned by the notice and comment \nprocedures “would in fact harm that interest.”  Mack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 95 (D.C. Cir. \n39 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 54 of 66 PageID #: 397\n2012); see also Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d 95, 113–14 (2d Cir. \n2018).   The fact that the Secretary issued the rule several weeks after President Biden’s announcement \ndoes not “weaken[]” this determination.  Br. at 34.  Any rule—whether or not accompanied by notice \nand comment procedures—must be the result of considered judgment and a reasoned decisionmaking \nprocess, a process that takes time to complete.  To the extent the President’s announcement is relevant \nhere,  the  fact that  the  Secretary  issued  the  rule  less  than  two months  after that  announcement \ndemonstrates that he acted with appropriate dispatch. \nBecause the Secretary had good cause to dispense with notice-and-comment rulemaking, the \nPlaintiffs’  two additional procedural arguments are unavailing.   First, the Plaintiffs  contend that the \nSecretary  violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  Br. at 35.  That statute  directs that,  “[i]n carrying out his \nfunctions,  relating  to determination  of [some, but not all,  of the] conditions  of participation  by \nproviders of services . . . [at issue here], the Secretary shall consult with appropriate State agencies and \nrecognized national  listing  or accrediting bodies[.]”  42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  The Secretary found that \n“[a]ny delay in the implementation of this rule would result in additional deaths and serious illnesses \namong health care staff and consumers, further exacerbating the newly-arising, and ongoing, strain on \nthe capacity of health care facilities to serve the public.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.  Based on that finding \nof the existence  of an emergency, he determined that there are no entities  with which it would be \n“appropriate to engage in these consultations  in advance of issuing” the interim rule, but noted that \nhe would engage in consultations following the rule’s issuance “in carrying out [his] functions.”  Id.   \nThis determination  is entitled  to deference from this  Court, for the same reasons that the \nSecretary’s decision to issue an interim final rule is so entitled.  See The GEO Grp., Inc. v. Newsom, 15 \nF.4th 919, 930 (9th Cir. 2021) (statutory language authorizing agency to take “appropriate” action “is \na hallmark of vast discretion”).  See also Alon Refin. Krotz Springs, Inc. v. EPA, 936 F.3d 628, 655 (D.C. \nCir. 2019), cert. denied sub nom., Valero Energy Corp. v. EPA, 140 S. Ct. 2792 (2020) (“nor does the phrase \n‘as appropriate’ itself specify a particular temporal dimension”).   \nSecond, the Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary’s issuance of his rule on an emergency basis \nviolated 42 U.S.C. § 1302(b), which requires the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis upon the \n40 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 55 of 66 PageID #: 398\npublication of a “notice of proposed rulemaking,” id. § 1302(b)(1), or upon the publication of a “final \nversion of a rule or regulation with respect to which an initial regulatory impact analysis is required by \nparagraph (1),” id. § 1302(b)(2).  This requirement does not apply here.  The Secretary did not publish \na notice of proposed rulemaking, and this is not the final version of a rule with respect to which an \ninitial regulatory impact analysis  was required.  The Secretary accordingly reasonably found that the \nstatute did not require an analysis under either paragraph; the plain text of the statute “only applies to \nfinal rules for which a proposed rule was published,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613, not to interim final rules, \nsuch as this one, that the Secretary publishes to address emergencies such as an imminent threat to \npatients’ lives.   See Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) \n(courts  are not free to impose additional procedural requirements  on rulemakings  beyond those \nexpressed in statute). \nD. The rule is constitutional. \nThe vaccination  rule does not, as the Plaintiffs contend, upset any federal-state “balance” or \nexceed Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce.  The Supreme Court “long ago rejected the \nsuggestion  that  Congress invades  areas reserved to the  States  by the  Tenth  Amendment simply \nbecause it exercises its authority under the Commerce Clause [or, as here, the Spending Clause] in a \nmanner that displaces  the States’ exercise  of their  police powers.”  Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & \nReclamation  Ass’n, 452 U.S. 264, 291 (1981).  In fact, “[a] Tenth Amendment challenge  to a statute \nnecessarily  fails if the statute is a valid exercise of a power relegated to Congress.”  United States v. \nLouper-Morris, 672 F.3d 539, 563 (8th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).  Even though “public health” is an \n“area[] of traditional state concern,” “Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause to choose how \nto fund the Medicare program is not in doubt.”  Minnesota ex rel. Hatch v. United States, 102 F. Supp. 2d \n1115, 1123 (D. Minn. 2000), aff'd sub nom. Minnesota Senior Fed’n, Metro. Region v. United States, 273 F.3d \n805 (8th Cir. 2001).  And it stands to reason that if a statute constitutes a valid exercise of congressional \npower, any regulation validly promulgated pursuant to statutory authority must also be immune from \na Tenth  Amendment challenge.   Accordingly,  because, for the reasons articulated  above, see supra \n41 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 56 of 66 PageID #: 399\nSection II.A., the vaccination rule is a valid exercise of the agency’s statutory authority, the Plaintiffs \nare unlikely to succeed on the merits of their Tenth Amendment challenge. \nThe Plaintiffs  next contend briefly that the vaccination  rule was not a valid exercise of the \nCommerce Clause.  Br. at 31.  But the statutes upon which the Secretary relied are exercises of the \nCongressional spending power, rather than the commerce power, so the Plaintiffs’ discussion of the \nCommerce Clause is irrelevant here.  See Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., \n527 U.S. 666, 686 (1999) (“Congress may, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its grant of \nfunds to the States upon their taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take, and \nthat acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the actions.”).  And, in any event, the States miss \nthe mark in arguing that the vaccination rule “does not regulate ongoing commercial activity,” Br. at \n31, or in likening  it to the provision of the  Affordable Care Act at issue  in National Federation of \nIndependent  Business  v. Sebelius,  567 U.S. 519, 520 (2012) (“NFIB”).  The vaccination  rule does not \ncompel any parties to become active in commerce; instead, it is a condition on payment of funds to \nentities  that make the voluntary choice to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  See \nNorthport Health Servs., 14 F.4th at 869 n.5. \nThe Plaintiffs  likewise err when they reach the constitutional  provision that does apply here, \nthe Spending Clause.  They argue that the vaccination rule violates the Spending Clause by allegedly \ncommandeering the States’ administrative apparatus for federal purposes without clear notice to the \nStates.  Br. at 29-30.  But the conditions on federal spending of which the Plaintiffs  complain are \nimposed on public  or private  entities  that  choose  to participate  in  the  Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, not on States in their capacity as States.  See Northport Health Servs., 14 F.4th at 869 n.5. \n In any event, “under Congress[’s] spending power, [it] may attach conditions on the receipt \nof federal funds,” as long as ‘[s]uch conditions . . . bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \nspending.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992) (citation omitted).  “Congress has broad \npower to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the States.”  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. \nBd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).  “[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power \n42 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 57 of 66 PageID #: 400\nis much in the nature  of a contract:   in return for federal funds, the States  agree to comply with \nfederally imposed conditions.”  Pennhurst States Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  \nMedicare and Medicaid are massive federal programs that impose all sorts of conditions with \nwhich participants  must comply in order to receive funds.  Even where, unlike here, the Medicaid \nprogram has conditioned federal funding for State governments on the States’ agreement to certain \nconditions,  courts have upheld  those conditions  under Congress’s spending  authority,  absent,  in \ncertain circumstances not present here, a conclusion that the offer of federal funding is coercive.  See, \ne.g., Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n,  496 U.S. 498, 502 (1990) (“Although participation  in the [Medicaid] \nprogram is voluntary, participating [s]tates must comply with certain requirements imposed by the Act \nand regulations promulgated by the Secretary.”).  And Congress acts on even stronger footing when \nit  offers federal funding  to private entities  in  exchange  for their  agreement  to abide by certain \nconditions on that funding, such as an agreement to protect the health and safety of their patients.  See \nMinn. Ass’n of Health Care Facilities, Inc. v. Minn. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 742 F.2d 442, 446 (8th Cir. 1984) \n(“Despite the strong financial inducement to participate in Medicaid, a nursing home’s decision to do \nso is nonetheless  voluntary.”);  see also Northport Health, 14 F.4th at 869 n.5; Se. Ark. Hospice, Inc. v. \nBurwell, 815 F.3d 448, 450 (8th Cir. 2016) (holding that hospice provider’s voluntary participation in \nMedicare “forecloses the  possibility  that  the statute  could result  in an imposed taking  of private \nproperty which would give rise to the constitutional  right of just compensation” (quoting Minn. Ass’n, \n742 F.2d at 446)). \n   The Plaintiffs  nevertheless  argue—again, on the basis of NFIB—that “[f]orcing States to \nadminister the mandate or jeopardize all Medicare and Medicaid funds flowing into their States (even to private \nhealthcare providers) is ‘a gun to the head’ that compels states to participate against their will.”  Br. at \n30 (Plaintiffs’  emphasis) (quoting NFIB, 567 U.S. at 581).  The NFIB plurality reasoned that Congress \nhad coerced the States by conditioning all funding for one program, the traditional Medicaid program, \non the States’ agreement to participate in a new, second program, the expansion of the program to \nnew populations.  But here, the Secretary is not “enlisting  the States in a new health care program,” \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 584.  See Gruver v. La. Bd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. & Mech. Coll., 959 \n43 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 58 of 66 PageID #: 401\nF.3d 178, 184 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 901 (2020).  He is simply applying the existing provisions \nof the Medicare and Medicaid statutes to fulfill his statutory duty to protect the health and safety of \nbeneficiaries of these programs.    \nThe Plaintiffs also contend that they did not have “clear notice” of the obligations imposed \nby the rule.  Br. at 30 (quoting Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., 548 U.S. at 296).  But health care facilities that \nchoose to receive federal funding do so with the awareness that they are subject to the Secretary’s \nhealth and safety standards.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a).  Likewise, if States choose to operate as state \nsurveyors, they enter into a voluntary agreement, that is terminable by either party, to receive funding \nfor their survey activities.   If they enter into such an agreement, they simply commit themselves  to \nreview health  care facilities’  compliance with federal standards and to report their  findings to the \nSecretary for further action, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a); 42 C.F.R. § 488.10(a), 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(1), \nusing “the survey methods, procedures, and forms that are prescribed by CMS,” id. § 488.26(d).   \nDespite making that commitment, the Plaintiffs  now protest that the Secretary’s  health and \nsafety standards are not expressly spelled out by statute.  The Constitution does not demand this level \nof exactitude.    See,  e.g.,  Bennett  v.  Ky. Dep’t  of  Educ.,  470 U.S.  656,  669 (1985)  (“[T]he  Federal \nGovernment simply could not prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity concerning particular \napplications of [a grant program’s] requirements . . . .”).  “Congress is not required to list every factual \ninstance in which a state will fail to comply with a condition.”  Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, \n1067 (9th Cir. 2002).  At bottom, the choice of health care facilities to participate in the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs is a voluntary one, and facilities that make that choice do so with the knowledge \nthat  the  Secretary  may  impose  requirements  on  them  that  he  finds  necessary  to  further  the \nCongressional purposes of protecting the health and safety of program beneficiaries.   See Northport \nHealth, 14 F.4th at 869 n.5. \nIII.  THE  REMAINING  INJUNCTION  FACTORS  REQUIRE  DENIAL  OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION.  \nA.  Plaintiffs fail to establish irreparable harm. \nThe Plaintiffs also cannot demonstrate likely irreparable harm.  See Florida v. Dep’t of Health & \n44 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 59 of 66 PageID #: 402\nHuman Servs., No. 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021), Order, ECF No. 6 (denying \npreliminary injunction  in a nearly identical suit for the State’s failure to show irreparable harm).  Such \na showing is indispensable for a preliminary injunction.  Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Rounds, \n530 F.3d 724, 732–33 & n.5 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  “In order to demonstrate irreparable harm, a \nparty must show that the harm is certain and great and of such imminence that there is a clear and \npresent  need  for equitable  relief.”  Iowa  Utils.  Bd.  v.  FCC,  109  F.3d 418,  425  (8th  Cir.  1996).  \n“Speculative harm” or a mere “possibility of irreparable harm” is not enough.  S.J.W. ex rel. Wilson v. \nLee’s Summit R-7 Sch. Dist., 696 F.3d 771, 779 (8th Cir. 2012); Winte, 555 U.S. at 22.  Economic loss \nalone is not irreparable harm unless the injuries cannot be recovered.  See Chlorine Inst., Inc. v. Soo Line \nR.R., 792 F.3d 903, 915 (8th Cir. 2015).  \n1.  The  Plaintiffs  suffer  no  cognizable  harm  to  their  “sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  or \nproprietary” interests at all, let alone a harm of the type required for equitable relief.  The Plaintiffs do \nnot have a cognizable interest for Article III purposes in the abstract question whether state law is \npreempted.  See Va. ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253, 270 (4th Cir. 2011); see also Florida, Order \nat 10 (rejecting this same argument as “lack[ing] merit”).  And, as for the Plaintiffs’  quasi-sovereign \ninterests or parens patriae interests, the Plaintiffs have no standing to sue the federal government in that \ncapacity and therefore cannot assert that they have been irreparably harmed on the basis of such \ninterests.  See Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Block, 771 F.2d 347, 355 (8th Cir. 1985) (“[W]e cannot allow the State \nto proceed as parens patriae in this case.  To do so would intrude on the sovereignty  of the federal \ngovernment and ignore important considerations of our federalist system.”); see also Alfred L. Snapp & \nSon v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 610 n.16 (1982) (“A State does not have standing as parens \npatriae to bring an action against the Federal Government”).    \nFinally,  regarding the Plaintiffs’  proprietary interests,  they assert they will suffer “irreparable \npocketbook harm” and “a diversion of state resources,” Br. at 40, but neither constitutes  irreparable \nharm.  See Florida, Order at 9 (“[E]conomic loss such as the loss of funding is not irreparable.”).  In \nfact, as explained previously, the Supreme Court recognized § 405’s channeling provision “comes at a \nprice, namely, occasional individual, delay-related hardship,” but concluded that Congress judged this \n45 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 60 of 66 PageID #: 403\nprice to be justified  “[i]n the  context  of a massive,  complex health  and safety program such  as \nMedicare.”   Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 13. \n2.   The  Plaintiffs’  claims  of irreparable  harm  are  also  speculative,  as  the  Florida  court \nrecognized.  That court “disregarded as conclusory” and as “speculative”  the State’s assertions  (in \ndeclarations  materially identical  to those submitted here) “of how the various [state] agencies  and \ninstitutions  anticipate they may be adversely impacted by the mandate.”  Florida, Order at 8.  The court \nalso noted that Florida’s affidavits failed to “take . . . into account any impact from the availability of \nthe exemption process,” and concluded that Florida had failed to provide any “evidence to suggest \nthat  the  anticipated  loss  of federal  funding  from the  State  agencies’  noncompliance  will  occur \nimmediately on December 6, 2021.”  Id. at 10.   \nThe Plaintiffs’  evidence here is equally  lacking.  They rely on conjecture  that the rule will \n“exacerbate an alarming shortage of healthcare workers.”  Br. at 1.  “‘Bare allegations of what is likely \nto occur are of no value since the court must decide whether the harm will in fact occur.’”  Packard \nElevator v. Interstate Com. Comm’n, 782 F.2d 112, 115 (8th Cir. 1986) (quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 \nF.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)).  As stated in the rule, “many health care workers already \ncomply with employer or State government vaccination  requirements  (for example, influenza,  and \nhepatitis B virus (HBV)),” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567, and “most of these individuals met State and local \nvaccination  requirements  in order to attend school.”  Id. at 61,567-68.  The Secretary recognized \nconcerns that health  care workers would choose to leave their jobs rather than be vaccinated,  but \nfound “insufficient  evidence to quantify  and compare adverse impacts on patient and resident care \nassociated with temporary staffing losses due to mandates and absences due to quarantine for known \nCOVID-19 exposures and illness.”  Id. at 61,569.  Further, the Secretary identified real-world evidence \nshowing that, when COVID-19 vaccination requirements have been initiated, workers have responded \nby getting vaccinated.  “99.5 percent of . . . staff” at a large hospital system in Texas responded to the \nsystem’s mandate by getting vaccinated, id.; 98 percent of a 33,000 employee health system in Detroit \ndid the same, id.; 95 percent of workers at more than 250 long-term care facilities did so, id.; and New \nYork’s state-wide health care worker mandate also saw a “jump in vaccine compliance in the final days \n46 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 61 of 66 PageID #: 404\nbefore the requirements took effect,” id.  See also 86 Fed. Reg. 63,418, 63,422 (Nov. 16, 2021) (Office \nof Management and Budget analysis noting that “Tyson Foods reported more than 96 percent of its \nworkforce is now vaccinated” after the company imposed a vaccination requirement).   \nThe Plaintiffs  identify no evidence demonstrating that health care workers will actually leave \ntheir jobs in large numbers if the vaccination rule remains in effect.  They cite declarations from health \ncare facilities that “project” losses, “fear[]” that they will not survive, and “expect[]” to lose employees, \nBr. at 9, but they have not identified any facilities that actually issued or were subject to vaccination \nrequirements  and lost  significant  numbers of employees.   In  the  absence  of such  evidence,  the \nPlaintiffs cannot show that the harm they fear will in fact occur.   \nMoreover, the Plaintiffs fail to set forth any evidence that the labor loss they fear will certainly \noutstrip staffing losses and absences due to quarantine for known COVID-19 exposures or the normal \nchurn in the health care labor market.  The Plaintiffs set forth statistics  about staffing shortages, but \nthey do not evaluate why those shortages exist.  The Secretary explored this issue, and found that \n“some hospitals and health care systems are currently experiencing tremendous strain due to high case \nvolume, coupled with persistent  staffing shortages due, at least in part, to COVID-19 infection or \nquarantine following exposure.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  Nor do the Plaintiffs provide any evidence \nthat in the absence of the vaccination rule, they will be able to stave off additional staffing problems.  \nIn fact, the opposite appears to be the case.  The Plaintiffs admit that during the pandemic, “there has \nbeen a boom in demand for travel nurses” and that “small rural hospitals . . . cannot afford to pay \ntheir nurses more to stay.”  Br. at 2.  The longer the pandemic rages, the more the demand for travel \nnurses will stay high and the more employees will be lured away for higher pay.  The Plaintiffs cannot \ncarry their burden to show irreparable harm when they cannot show that in the absence of the rule \nthey will be able to retain all of their current employees. \nAccordingly,  they cannot  show that  the harm they  fear is “certain  and great and of such \nimminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.”  Novus Franchising, Inc. v. Dawson, \n725 F.3d 885, 895 (8th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).  Because the Plaintiffs cannot show irreparable \nharm, they are not entitled to injunctive  relief.  Mgmt. Registry, Inc. v. A.W. Companies,  Inc., 920 F.3d \n47 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 62 of 66 PageID #: 405\n1181, 1184 (8th Cir. 2019).   \nB.  Plaintiffs fail to establish that the balance of equities and public interest factors \nfavor the requested injunction. \nThe third and fourth requirements  for issuance  of a preliminary injunction—the  balance of \nharms and whether the  requested  injunction  will disserve  the  public interest—“merge  when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  Here, these considerations tilt decisively \nin the Defendants’ favor. \nFirst, enjoining the rule would harm the public interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19 \namong millions of health care workers and Medicare and Medicaid patients.  As the Supreme Court \nhas  recognized,  “[s]temming the  spread of COVID-19 is unquestionably  a compelling interest.”  \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020).  Accordingly, numerous courts \nreviewing “executive action designed to slow the spread of COVID-19” have concluded that, “[t]he \npublic  interest  in  protecting  human  life—particularly  in  the  face of a global and unpredictable \npandemic—would not be served by” an injunction.   Tigges v. Northam, 473 F. Supp. 3d 559, 573–74 \n(E.D. Va. 2020); see also, e.g., Am.’s Frontline Drs. v. Wilcox, No. EDCV 21-1243, 2021 WL 4546923, at \n*8 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2021); Valdez v. Grisham, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 4145746, at *13 (D.N.M. \nSept. 13, 2021), appeal filed, No. 21-2105 (10th Cir. Sept. 15, 2021); Harris v. Univ. of Mass., Lowell, ---\nF. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 3848012, at *8 (D. Mass. Aug. 27, 2021), appeal filed, No. 21-1770 (1st Cir. \nSept. 28, 2021); Williams  v. Brown, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 4894264, at *10-11 (D. Or. Oct. 19, \n2021); Wise v. Inslee, No. 2:21-cv-0288, 2021 WL 4951571, at *6 (E.D. Wash. Oct. 25, 2021); Mass Corr. \nOfficers Federated Union v. Baker, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 4822154, at *7-8 (D. Mass. Oct. 15, 2021); \nJohnson v. Brown, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 4846060, at *26-27 (D.Or. Oct. 18, 2021); TJM 64, Inc. v. \nHarris, 475 F. Supp. 3d 828, 840–41 (W.D. Tenn. 2020); Talleywhacker, Inc. v. Cooper, 465 F. Supp. 3d \n523, 543 (E.D.N.C. 2020). \nSecond, enjoining  the rule would harm the public interest by further exposing Medicare and \nMedicaid patients and staff—and the Medicare and Medicaid programs—to unvaccinated health care \nworkers.  For  patients  and  staff,  this  means  numerous  additional  lives  affected  by  disease, \n48 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 63 of 66 PageID #: 406\nhospitalization,  or even death.  See supra at 31.  For providers, this means a further contribution to \nstaffing shortages owing to both time off for illness  and quarantine,  as well as staff deaths.  The \nSecretary cited concrete  evidence that an increase  in vaccinated  health  care staff improves patient \nsafety and access to care.  As the Secretary detailed in the rule, “evidence has shown that influenza \nvaccination  of health  care staff is  associated  with declines  in  nosocomial [meaning,  health-care-\nassociated  or  hospital-acquired]  influenza  in  hospitalized  patients,  and  among  nursing  home \nresidents.”   86 Fed. Reg. at 61,558.  Additionally,  “[f]ewer infected staff and lower transmissibility \nequates to fewer opportunities for transmission  to patients.”  Id. at 61,558.  And further, “case rates \namong [long-term care] facility residents are higher in facilities with lower vaccination coverage among \nstaff,” and “nursing home outbreaks have [been] linked . . . to unvaccinated health care workers.”  Id.  \nFinally,  the  Secretary  demonstrated  that  “illnesses  and  deaths  associated  with  COVID-19 are \nexacerbating staffing shortages across the health care system.”  Id. at 61,559.  In particular, “[o]ver half \na million COVID-19 cases and 1,900 deaths among health care staff have been reported to CDC since \nthe start of the [public health emergency],” numbers that are likely undercounts.  Id. \nNot  only  has  the  Secretary  identified  concrete,  data-driven  harms,  but  he  reasonably \ndetermined,  based on the  available  evidence,  that  a tool exists  to counter  those  harms. “FDA-\napproved and FDA-authorized  vaccines  in use  in the  U.S. are both safe and highly  effective  at \nprotecting vaccinated people against symptomatic and severe COVID-19.”  Id. at 61,560.  Moreover, \n“[e]merging evidence also suggests that vaccinated people who become infected with the SARS–CoV–\n2 Delta variant have potential to be less infectious than infected unvaccinated people, thus decreasing \ntransmission risk.” Id. at 61,558.  Reducing COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations,  and deaths, as well as \nthe  transmissibility  of COVID-19 among health  care  workers will  both  prevent  some  staffing \nshortages and protect patient health.  Id. \nBy comparison, any theoretical harm that the Plaintiffs might experience absent a preliminary \ninjunction is, as explained supra at Part III.A, both speculative and purely economic.  Nowhere do the \nPlaintiffs dispute this evidence of positive effects of vaccination on patient care and health, including \nthe  saving  of lives.   In  fact,  in  discussing  the  public  interest  prong, the  Plaintiffs  fail  to even \n49 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 64 of 66 PageID #: 407\nacknowledge the unparalleled American casualties from COVID-19.   Rather, the Plaintiffs argue that \nthe rule will cause health care staff to leave their jobs, with cascading effects on patient access to care.  \nBut they have set forth no evidence to demonstrate that the vaccination rule will actually have that \neffect.  In fact, as noted in the rule, there are clear examples of requirements having exactly the effect \nthat the Secretary intends—increasing  the percentage of vaccinated staff to near 100 percent.  86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,569.   \nMoreover, “[t]here is inherent  harm to an agency in preventing it from enforcing regulations \nthat Congress found it in the public interest to direct that agency to develop.”  Cornish v. Dudas, 540 \nF. Supp. 2d 61, 65 (D.D.C. 2008).  Congress has charged the Secretary with the responsibility  to \nprotect the health and safety of individuals providing and receiving care and services from Medicare \nand Medicaid providers.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395x(e)(9) (hospitals); 1395i–3(d)(4)(B) (Medicare long-\nterm care facilities).   The public interest favors allowing the Secretary to fulfill these responsibilities. \nAt bottom, the balance of harms and the public interest factors of the injunctive  relief analysis \nweigh heavily in favor of allowing the federal government to take reasonable steps to protect the health \nof patients and staff in health care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  \nGranting the Plaintiffs’  motion would do far more certain harm to the public interest than denying \nthe motion might (potentially) harm the Plaintiffs. \nIV.  ANY  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF  SHOULD  BE  LIMITED  TO  FACILITIES \nOPERATED  BY  THE  PLAINTIFFS  AND  ONLY  TO  ANY  UNLAWFUL \nASPECTS, IF ANY, OF THE RULE.  \nIf the Court disagrees with the Defendants’ arguments, any relief should be no broader than \nnecessary  to remedy the demonstrated irreparable harms of the specific Plaintiffs  in this case.  “A \nplaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury,” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. \nCt. 1916, 1934 (2018), and “injunctive  relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs,” Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, \n765 (1994) (citation omitted). \nIn that regard, first, any injunction  should apply only to those aspects of the rule for which the \n50 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 65 of 66 PageID #: 408\nCourt finds the Plaintiffs have met their burden under the four-factor test for emergency relief.  The \nSupreme Court has held a regulation severable where severance would “not impair the function of the \nstatute as a whole, and there is no indication that the regulation would not have been passed but for \nits inclusion.”  K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 294 (1988) (invalidating only the provision of \na regulation that exceeded the agency’s statutory authority).   Severability clauses, such as the one in \nthe rule, see 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560, create a presumption that the validity of the entire regulation is not \ndependent on the validity of any specific unlawful provision if that unlawful provision would not \nimpair the function of the regulation as a whole.  Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 686 (1987). \nSecond, any injunctive  relief should be limited, at most, to facilities  operated by the Plaintiffs.  \n“The  Court’s constitutionally  prescribed  role is  to vindicate  the  individual  rights  of the  people \nappearing before it.”  Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1933; see also id. at 1934 (citing Daimler Chrysler Corp. v. Cuno, \n547 U.S. 332, 353 (2006)); Madsen, 512 U.S. at 765.  Indeed, the Plaintiffs have no serious interest in \nwhether other States are subject to the rule during the pendency of this lawsuit (and in fact, if their \nallegations concerning trends among health care workers are to be believed, they would benefit from \nrelief being circumscribed within their own borders to facilities they themselves operate), nor standing \nto assert claims on behalf of facilities  in the Plaintiffs  States that Plaintiffs  do not operate, and the \nPlaintiffs’  claims would be fully redressed through a preliminary injunction  prohibiting the Secretary \nfrom “implementing” or “enforcing” the rule against facilities Plaintiffs operate alone. \nNationwide relief would be particularly harmful here given that two other district courts are \ncurrently considering similar challenges,  and a third recently decided one.  A nationwide injunction \nwould render the district court’s order in Florida, as well as any additional orders that might follow \nfrom other courts considering similar claims, meaningless as a practical matter.  It would also preclude \nappellate courts from testing the Plaintiffs’  claims against the rule’s operation in other jurisdictions.   \nMoreover, more than half of the States are not challenging  the vaccination rule.  There is no reason \nwhy the Plaintiffs’ disagreements with it should govern the rest of the country.  See California v. Azar, \n911 F.3d 558, 583 (9th Cir. 2018) (“The detrimental consequences  of a nationwide injunction are not \nlimited to their effects on judicial decisionmaking.  There are also the equities of non-parties who are \n51 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 66 of 66 PageID #: 409\ndeprived the right to litigate in other forums.”); see also id. at 582-84 (vacating nationwide scope of \ninjunction  in facial challenge under the APA).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied. \n \nDated: November 22, 2021        Respectfully submitted, \n \n              BRIAN M.

Reg. \n61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021).  That IFC, also referred to as the “CMS vaccine mandate,” “CMS mandate,” \nor “mandate,” imposes an unprecedented federal vaccine mandate on nearly every employee, \nvolunteer, and third-party contractor working at a wide range of healthcare facilities. \n  This mandate threatens to exacerbate an alarming shortage of healthcare workers, parti-\ncularly in rural communities, that has already reached a crisis point.  Indeed, the circumstances in \nthe Plaintiff States—facts that CMS, which skipped notice-and-comment rulemaking, did not \nmeaningfully consider—foreshadow an impending disaster in the healthcare industry.  By ignoring \nthe facts on the ground and unreasonably dismissing concerns about workforce shortages, the CMS \nvaccine mandate jeopardizes the healthcare interests of rural Americans. \nThis mandate is unlawful for at least five reasons.  First, it is arbitrary and capricious under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706.  Second, it exceeds CMS’s \nstatutory authority and conflicts with law.  Third, it violates the U.S. Constitution.  Fourth, it \nviolates numerous procedural requirements of the APA and the Social Security Act.  And fifth, \nCMS failed to prepare a required regulatory impact analysis (“RIA”) on the impact the IFC will \nhave on the operations of Plaintiff States’ small rural hospitals.  Because the CMS mandate is \nunlawful, and because it threatens to devastate healthcare throughout the country, the Court should \nenjoin it pending final resolution on the merits. \n1 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 9 of 52 PageID #: 119\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  The Healthcare Worker Shortage Crisis in the Plaintiff States. \n  “[C]urrently there are endemic staff shortages,” CMS admits, “for almost all categories of \nemployees at almost all kinds of health care providers and supplier[s].”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,607.  \n“1 in 5 hospitals,” CMS notes, “report that they are currently experiencing a critical staffing \nshortage.”  Id. at 61,559.  In addition, “approximately 23 percent of [long-term-care] facilities \nreport[] a shortage in nursing aides; 21 percent report[] a shortage of nurses; and 10 to 12 percent \nreport[] shortages in other clinical and non-clinical staff categories.”  Id.  It is thus not surprising, \nCMS relayed, that “[o]ver half (58 percent) of nursing homes participating in a recent survey . . . \nindicated that they are limiting new admissions due to staffing shortages.”  Id.   \n  The Plaintiff States’ experience confirms this.  Healthcare facilities through the Plaintiff \nStates affirm that they have been and still are experiencing serious workforce shortages.  See, e.g., \nStrong Decl. ¶ 4 (Ex. F); Kahl Decl. ¶ 7 (Ex. Q); McNea Decl. ¶ 9 (Ex. S); Barber Decl. ¶ 11 (Ex. \nN); Mazanec Decl. ¶ 11 (Ex. R); Glaubke Decl. ¶ 11 (Ex. U); Sroczynski Decl. ¶¶ 4–7 (Ex. T); \nJohansson Decl. ¶¶ 2, 5–6 (Ex. DD).  A recent study shows that 97 of Missouri’s 114 counties \nhave a nursing shortage.  Lori Schneidt, Anne Heyen & Tracy Greever-Rice, Show Me the Nursing \nShortage: Location Matters in Missouri Nursing Shortage, 12 J. Nursing Reg. 52 (2021).  In \naddition, staff nurse turnover in Missouri is the highest it has been in 20 years.  See Missouri \nHospital  Association,  2021  Workforce  Report  (2021),  available  at \nhttps://www.mhanet.com/mhaimages/Workforce/2021/2021_WF_report.pdf.  Thus, to fill open \npositions, there has been a boom in demand for travel nurses, but this further harms small rural \nhospitals that cannot afford to pay their nurses more to stay and cannot afford the exorbitant rates \nof travel nurses.  See Leticia Miranda, Rural hospitals losing hundreds of staff to high-paid \n2 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 10 of 52 PageID #: 120\ntraveling nurse jobs (Sept. 15, 2021), https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/rural-\nhospitals-losing-hundreds-staff-high-paid-traveling-nurse-jobs-n1279199.   \n  The staffing shortages have gotten so bad that it has prompted emergency measures by \nstate officials.  Just a few months ago, on August 27, 2021, Missouri Governor Michael L. Parson \nsigned Executive Order 21-09 declaring a targeted State of Emergency for Missouri’s healthcare \nsystem.  Mo. Exec. Order 21-09 (Aug. 27, 2021), available at https://www.sos.mo.gov/library/ \nreference/orders/2021/eo9 (last visited Nov. 8, 2021).  The Order, which remains in effect until \nDecember 31, 2021, declared that “a state of emergency exists relative to staff shortages in the \nState’s healthcare system and the State’s recovery efforts from the COVID-19 public health \nthreat.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Likewise, on August 26, 2021, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts \nissued Executive Order No. 21-12 declaring that “Nebraska hospitals, clinics, and other health care \nfacilities are facing a shortage of health care professionals” and that “a hospital capacity emergency \nexists.”  Neb. Exec. Order 21-12 (Aug. 26, 2021), available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/ \nsm3dpu7t094ymum/Executive%20Order%2021-12%20-%20Additional%20Healthcare%20 \nWorkforce%20Capacity.pdf?dl=0.  Governor Ricketts issued the order, which temporarily waived \ncertain regulations governing healthcare workers and which remains in effect until December 31, \n2021, to “protect[] the citizens of Nebraska from the public health threat of a hospital capacity and \nworkforce emergency.”  Id.  In addition, on September 21, 2021, Wyoming Governor Mark \nGordon activated the Wyoming National Guard to provide temporary assistance to healthcare \nfacilities throughout Wyoming.  Governor Gordon called approximately 97 soldiers to provide \nadditional staffing for “Wyoming hospitals, long term care facilities, and public health departments \nstatewide.”  Johansson Decl. ¶ 3 (Ex. DD). \n3 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 11 of 52 PageID #: 121\nB.  President Biden’s September 9, 2021 Speech Announcing Vaccine Mandates. \nFor the first six months of President Biden’s Administration, none of his agencies sought \nto impose vaccine mandates on the American people.  As recently as July 23, 2021, the White \nHouse announced that mandating vaccines is “not the role of the federal government.”  Press \nBriefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki (July 23, 2021), The White House, https://www.whitehouse. \ngov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/23/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-\n23-2021/.   \nYet on September 9, 2021, amid flagging poll numbers due to the crisis in Afghanistan and \non the southern border, the Administration’s policy on federal vaccine mandates underwent a \ndramatic about-face.  That day, President Biden gave a speech announcing his six-point Plan to \n“turn the tide on COVID-19.”  Joseph Biden, Remarks at the White House (Sept. 9, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-president-\nbiden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/ (“Biden Speech”).  He announced the first plank of \nhis plan: to “require more Americans to be vaccinated.”  Id.  Toward that end, the President called \nfor several federal vaccine mandates—(1) a mandate from the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration (“OSHA”) for companies with more than 100 employees, (2) a mandate for federal \nemployees, (3) a mandate for employees of federal contractors and subcontractors, and (4) the \nCMS vaccine mandate challenged here.  Id.  The stated purpose of these mandates was to increase \nthe number of vaccinated people by any coercive power available to the federal government.  Id. \nPresident  Biden  also  expressed  a  dismissive  view  of  States  that  have  used  their \nconstitutionally guaranteed police powers to adopt contrary public-health policies.  Id.  He stated: \n“Let me be blunt.  My plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining . . . these \n4 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 12 of 52 PageID #: 122\nlifesaving actions.”  Id.  Speaking scornfully of “governor[s]” who oppose the new federal man-\ndates, he promised that “if these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as \nPresident to get them out of the way.”  Id.  \n  C.   CMS’s November 5, 2021 Vaccine Mandate. \nOn November 5, 2021, nearly two months after President Biden announced his federal \nvaccine mandates, CMS published the IFC challenged here.  86 Fed. Reg. 61,555.  In creating that \nrule, however, CMS did not comply with notice-and-comment requirements or consult with the \nStates.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c) (APA requirements), 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(1) (Social Security \nAct requirements), 42 U.S.C. § 1395z (“Secretary shall consult with appropriate State agencies”). \nCMS openly recognized that its action was unprecedented—never before had the agency \nmandated vaccination.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567 (“We have not previously required any \nvaccinations”); see also Compl. ¶ 121 (collecting other cites).  CMS nevertheless took this action \nto nationalize the COVID-19 vaccination response, explaining that “the inconsistent web of State, \nlocal, and employer COVID-19 vaccination requirements have established a pressing need for a \nconsistent Federal policy mandating staff vaccination in health care settings.”  86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,584.  And the agency chose the draconian course of mandating vaccines because it determined \nthat the “most important inducement [for vaccination] will be the fear of job loss.”  Id. at 61,607. \nThe CMS vaccine mandate covers fifteen categories of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified \nproviders and suppliers, including Rural Health Clinics (“RHCs”), Critical Access Hospitals \n(“CAHs”), other hospitals, Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (“PRTFs”) for individuals \nunder age 21, and long-term-care (“LTC”) facilities.  Id. at 61,556.  By expanding its reach in this \nway, the mandate broadly sweeps in a “diverse” set of healthcare providers.  Id. at 61,602. \n5 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 13 of 52 PageID #: 123\nCMS applies its vaccine mandate to practically every full-time employee, part-time worker, \ntrainee, student, volunteer, or third-party contractor working at covered facilities.  The mandate \nrequires vaccination for all “facility staff”—a term that includes employees, trainees, students, \nvolunteers, and contractors—“who provide any care, treatment, or other services for the facility,” \n“regardless of . . . patient contact.”  Id. at 61,570 (emphasis added).  This includes “administrative \nstaff” and “housekeeping and food services.”  Id.  CMS also imposed its mandate on “any \nindividual that . . . has the potential to have contact with anyone at the site of care.”  Id. at 61,571 \n(emphasis added).  This includes “staff that primarily provide services remotely via telework” but \n“occasionally encounter fellow staff . . . who will themselves enter a health care facility.”  Id. at \n61, 570.  Illustrating its breadth, the mandate also covers a “crew working on a construction project \nwhose members use shared facilities (restrooms, cafeteria, break rooms) during their breaks[.]”  \nId. at 61,571.  CMS allows exemptions only to the extent necessary to “comply with applicable \nFederal anti-discrimination laws and civil rights protections,” such as medical exemptions required \nby the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and religious exemptions required by Title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Id. at 61,568. \nRecognizing the mandate’s breadth, CMS acknowledges its “near-universal applicability” \nto health-care staff and its demand that “virtually all health care staff in the U.S. [must] be \nvaccinated for COVD-19.”  Id. at 61,573.  CMS estimates that approximately 10.3 million \nemployees will fall under the mandate.  Id. at 61,603. \nCMS expressly rejected the option of allowing workers to undergo “daily or weekly \n[COVID-19] testing” instead of mandatory vaccination, and it did so for only one reason: because \nthe agency believes that “vaccination is a more effective infection control measure” than regular \ntesting.  Id. at 61,614. \n6 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 14 of 52 PageID #: 124\nCMS was “aware of concerns about health care workers choosing to leave their jobs rather \nthan be vaccinated” and knew that “there might be a certain number of health care workers who \nchoose to do so.”  Id. at 61,569.  But CMS dismissed these concerns because “there is insufficient \nevidence to quantify” that risk and balance it against others.  Id.  Instead, based on the experiences \nof a few private healthcare facilities that implemented vaccine mandates in mostly urban areas, \nCMS optimistically “believe[d] that the COVID-19 vaccine requirements . . . will result in nearly \nall health care workers being vaccinated.”  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 61,609 (finding \nthat only a “relatively small fraction” of turnover “will be due to vaccination”).   \nThe IFC was immediately effective on November 5, 2021—the day it was published.  Id. \nat 61,555.  Covered providers must implement the vaccine mandate in two 30-day phases.  Id. at \n61,571.  Phase 1 requires staff to receive the first vaccine dose or request a medical or religious \nexemption by December 6, 2021.  Id.  And Phase 2 mandates that non-exempt staff be fully vacci-\nnated by January 4, 2022.  Id.  Covered healthcare providers that do not comply are subject to \ntermination of their Medicare/Medicaid provider agreement.  Id. at 61,574; see also Compl. ¶ 127 \n(citing other support).  Because the decision to get vaccinated must occur by December 6, the \nPlaintiff States need relief before that date. \n  D.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate’s Commandeering of the States. \nThe CMS mandate overrides state laws and commandeers state officials at every turn.  The \nagency repeatedly says that it intends for the mandate to preempt any arguably inconsistent state \nand local laws.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,568 (“We intend . . . that this nationwide regulation \npreempts inconsistent State and local laws”); see also Compl. ¶ 121 (collecting cites).   \nCMS also requires “State-run facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding” to \nenforce and administer the vaccine mandate by “imposing [it] on their employees.”  86 Fed. Reg. \n7 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 15 of 52 PageID #: 125\nat 61,613.  This includes complying with overbearing record-keeping obligations, such as “track-\ning [the] vaccination status” of staff who are not covered by the mandate, and documenting the \n“vaccination status of any staff who have obtained any booster doses” even though the mandate \ndoes not require boosters.  Id. at 61,571.  The Plaintiff States operate many state-run hospitals.  \nSee, e.g., Huhn Decl. ¶¶ 3, 6–12, 15–18 (Ex. J); York Decl. ¶¶ 1–3 (Ex. B); Johansson Decl. ¶¶ 1–\n2, 6 (Ex. DD); Kahl Decl. ¶¶ 8–10 (Ex. Q); White Decl. ¶¶ 3–4 (Ex. C); Ringling Decl. ¶ 3 (Ex. \nCC); Jones Decl. ¶ 3 (Ex. AA).  \nCMS additionally coopts “State surveyors . . . to assess compliance with” the mandate.  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,574.  Those surveyors are employed by the States.  See Bollin Decl. ¶ 5 (Ex. H); \nGayhart Decl. ¶ 3 (Ex. A); Wehbi Decl. ¶ 4 (Ex. BB).  They must “review[] the entity’s records of \nstaff vaccinations” and “interview[] staff to verify their vaccination status.”  86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,574.  And they must “cite providers and suppliers when noncompliance is identified.”  Id. \n  E.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate’s Disruptive Impact on Healthcare. \nVaccination rates, as CMS admits, “are disproportionately low among nurses and health \ncare aides” in rural locations and other “communities that experience social risk factors,” 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,566, and “rural hospitals are having greater problems with employee vaccination . . . \nthan urban hospitals,” id. at 61,613.  A recent survey also shows that a substantial portion of \n“unvaccinated workers”—a whopping 72%—“say they will quit” rather than submit to a vaccine \nmandate.  Chris Isidore and Virginia Langmaid, 72% of unvaccinated workers vow to quit if \nordered to get vaccinated, CNN.com (Oct. 28, 2021), https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/business/ \ncovid-vaccine-workers-quit/index.html.  The confluence of these developments have created the \nperfect storm for healthcare calamity in rural America.   \n8 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 16 of 52 PageID #: 126\nHealthcare facilities throughout the Plaintiff States confirm this.  The leadership at Calla-\nway  District  Hospital—a  Small  Rural  Hospital  and  Critical  Access  Hospital  in  Callaway, \nNebraska—is deeply distressed.  Eggleston Decl. ¶¶ 1, 4–5 (Ex. L).  Around 20 members of its \n65-person staff are not vaccinated, and over half of those unvaccinated workers are nurses.  Id. at \n12, 14.  Sadly, Callaway “project[s] [the] loss of approximately 30% of [its] staff” from the CMS \nmandate—losses that “will almost certainly lead to closure of [the] facility” and “leave [that] rural \ncommunity without essential healthcare services.”  Id. at ¶¶ 16–17.   \nLikewise, Cherry County Hospital in rural Valentine, Nebraska fears that it will not survive \nCMS’s mandate.  Kellum Decl. ¶¶ 1, 4, 15 (Ex. P).  Sixty-six of its 159 staff members are not \nvaccinated, and the hospital projects that the mandate will force 50 of those 66 to leave their \npositions.  Id. at ¶¶ 11, 13–14.  That will result in closing its dialysis and chemotherapy depart-\nments, dramatically reducing its ability to provide needed surgeries, and perhaps even shutting \ndown the hospital.  Id. at ¶ 15.  In the CEO’s words, “I cannot express the extent of what is about \nto happen.”  Id. at ¶ 16.  Patients in that community “will not have the primary care services needed \nto stay healthy,” and they “will not have the staff to care for them in an emergency.”  Id.  \nSimilar evidence from Box Butte General Hospital, a Small Rural Hospital and Critical \nAccess Hospital in Alliance, Nebraska, illustrates the systemic staffing issues.  Mazanec Decl. ¶¶ \n1, 4–5 (Ex. R).  Box Butte has had open positions “since 2019 with no applications received” due \nto “existing health care worker shortages” and “challenges of the rural location.”  Id. at ¶ 11.  \nCurrently, 42% of Box Butte’s 289 employees are unvaccinated, and those employees include \nsenior leadership, physicians, and nurses.  Id. at ¶¶ 10, 12.  The hospital expects “to lose 15 percent \nof its total employees” from the CMS mandate, and those losses will “impact[] nearly all . . . \ndepartments,” including emergency medicine.  Id. at ¶ 13.  Box Butte thus anticipates needing to \n9 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 17 of 52 PageID #: 127\nclose departments, reduce services, and turn patients away.  Id. at ¶ 14.  And because the remaining \nemployees “will be forced to work extended hours,” this will feed a vicious cycle as they \n“experience an even greater amount of burnout” and will be likely to “leave health care” altogether.  \nId. at ¶ 15.   \nCommunity Hospital—which is in rural McCook, Nebraska, serves people from Southwest \nNebraska and Northwest Kansas, and is 70 miles from the next closest facility providing similar \nservices—also faces severe consequences from the CMS mandate.  Bruntz Decl. ¶¶ 1, 9–10 (Ex. \nW).  Seventy-eight of its 330 employees (24%) are unvaccinated, and 76 of the unvaccinated staff \n“have indicated they will not or are seriously considering not receiving the vaccination.”  Id. at ¶ \n13.  The hospital thus expects that it will “lose well more than 10% of its staffing,” that its patients \n“will be harmed” when the facility is “forced to limit or close services,” and that many of the \nremaining vaccinated staff “will resign due to the stress and burn out that will inevitably exist.” \nId. at ¶¶ 14–16.   \nThe experience of Franciscan Care Services, a Small Rural Hospital and Critical Access \nHospital in Northeast Nebraska, illustrates the interconnectedness of the healthcare industry.  \nToline Decl. ¶¶ 1, 4–5, 9 (Ex. Y).  Just a few months ago, in June 2021, it experienced “increased \nvolumes” after the closure of a critical access hospital 15 miles away.  Id. at ¶ 9.  Now it fears for \nthe future since 23% of its staff are unvaccinated.  Id. at ¶ 14.  If it loses many of them as it expects, \nFranciscan will need “to reduce services in the clinic” to provide care for “emergency patients.”  \nId. at ¶ 15.  In turn, “[e]mergency room patient volumes . . . will increase due to inability to care \nfor [patients] in the clinic setting.”  Id.   \nThe  leadership  at  a  slightly  larger  hospital—Great  Plains  Health  in  North  Platte, \nNebraska—is also troubled by the vaccine mandate.  It has a total staff of 1,197, and 311 of them \n10 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 18 of 52 PageID #: 128\nare not vaccinated.  McNea Decl. ¶¶ 1, 8, 10 (Ex. S).  The hospital projects that it will “lose a high \npercentage of these unvaccinated employees,” in addition to already having 231 vacancies.  Id. at \n¶¶ 9–10.  Such losses, which would lead to “a dangerously reduced number of staffed ICU beds,” \nwould have “negative effects” on patients.  Id. at ¶ 11.  Great Plains also fears that it will “need to \nclose or reduce” its “behavioral health unit,” requiring it to send patients to a different facility that \n“is nearly three hours away and itself facing staffing concerns.”  Id. at ¶ 12. \nWhat’s more, Scotland County Hospital in Memphis, Missouri, a 25-bed, non-profit \nCritical Access Hospital serving rural Northeast Missouri and Southeast Iowa, has “at least” five \nessential workers in critical areas who have “stated emphatically they will not be vaccinated,” and \nthe hospital’s CEO believes the CMS vaccine mandate will cause these workers to quit or he’ll \nhave to fire them.  The hospital has already “suffered staff resignations by 18%” during the \npandemic, and the loss of “additional employees will cause significant difficulty in the continued \nquality and safe operations of SCH.”  Tobler Decl. ¶¶ 1–2, 4, 6–7 (Ex. G).    \nEvidence also shows that CMS’s mandate will have substantially negative effects on \nhospitals with successful voluntary vaccination efforts.  St. Anthony Regional Hospital, in rural \nCarroll, Iowa, has about 87% of its 750-person staff vaccinated.  Smith Decl. ¶¶ 3, 4, 6 (Ex. D).  \nBut a recent survey of its unvaccinated employees shows that 40 employees are likely to resign \nrather than comply with CMS’s mandate.  Id. at ¶ 8.  Given the hospital’s significant struggles \nwith filling and recruiting staff, the loss of 40 employees will force it “to evaluate the availability \nof needed healthcare services to the people” it serves.  Id. at ¶ 5, 9, 11. \nThe mandate’s unsettling effects on the healthcare industry reach beyond rural hospitals to \nskilled nursing and long-term-care (“LTC”) facilities.  Many long-term-care facilities in Missouri \n“have indicated that they would have to close their facilities” under the mandate.  Strong Decl. ¶ \n11 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 19 of 52 PageID #: 129\n6 (Ex. F).  That “would displace thousands of residents across the state and affect the entire health \ncare system” by “inundat[ing] hospital capacity” and “leaving little room for others in the \ncommunity to receive the care they need.”  Id.  \nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (“DHSS”) echoed these concerns \nin a November 12, 2021 emergency amendment to Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 19, § 30-82.010.  See \nEmergency Amendment, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (Nov. 12, 2021), \nhttps://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/AdRules/main/EmergenciesforInternet/19c30-\n82.010IE.pdf.  According to DHSS, approximately 44% of staff working at Missouri’s long-term-\ncare facilities are not fully vaccinated.  Id.  DHSS anticipates that “many of the [44%] of \nunvaccinated staff working at these long term facilities will not choose to get vaccinated, even \nwith this vaccine mandate from CMS.”  Id.  DHSS thus predicts that because of the CMS vaccine \nmandate, some long-term-care facilities—namely, skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care \nfacilities—“will not have enough staff to care for the residents in their facilities and be in \ncompliance with federal and state law.”  Id.  These facilities may be forced to temporarily close or \nconsolidate until the staffing shortages are fixed.  Id.  The emergency amendment thus creates a \ntemporary closure procedure for facilities should they need to “make plans to begin discharging \nresidents and pursing temporary closures before” CMS’s deadlines.  Id. \nSpecific examples throughout the Plaintiff States support these broader concerns about \nlong-term-care facilities.  One troubling situation involves Kimball County Manor and Assisted \nLiving, a nursing home in rural Nebraska.  Monheiser Decl. ¶ 1 (Ex. V).  Of that facility’s 55 \nemployees, 31 are unvaccinated, and at least 27 of them “have informed management that they \nwill resign or be terminated rather than be vaccinated.”  Id. at ¶ 8. “Losing potentially 48% of [its] \nworkforce, including a substantial percentage of [its] already depleted nursing staff[,] will force” \n12 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 20 of 52 PageID #: 130\nthe manor to reduce its services and transfer “current patients” to facilities further away.  Id. at ¶ \n9.  It will also jeopardize the manor’s “very existence.”  Id. at ¶ 9.  Fearing its impending doom, \nthe manor has already placed “a hold on admitting new patients in anticipation of [the] loss of \nstaff.”  Id. at ¶ 7. \nA similar situation faces Monroe City Manor Care Center, a nursing home in Missouri.  It \nhas an employee vaccination rate under 50%, and “[w]hen surveyed, a majority of the[] unvacci-\nnated staff stated they would choose to leave healthcare completely over being forced to get [a] \ncovid-19 vaccine.”  Vanlandingham Decl. ¶ 7 (Ex. E).  That loss of 25% of its total staff “will \ncause significant difficulty in the continued operation” of the facility.  Id. at ¶ 8.  \nScotland County Care Center (“SCCC”), another nursing home in Missouri, is similarly \nsituated.  SCCC, a political subdivision of the State of Missouri, derives 50% of its total operational \nrevenues from CMS, and is currently experiencing a shortage of nursing staff.  This has already \nled SCCC to contract-out nursing services at a substantial premium.  And now, the CMS vaccine \nmandate will cause SCCC to “lose more staff, struggle to fill those vacancy spots with agency \nstaffing, causing even more financial hardship.”  Twenty out of 65 of SCCC’s employees are \n“vehemently opposed to taking the vaccine and if the CMS mandate is indeed imposed, they will \nquit working at SCCC.”  “If that happens,” SCCC “will lose about 30% of [its] workforce”—a \nloss that will cause SCCC to cease its operations.  Schrage Decl. ¶¶ 1–2, 4–5, 7, 9 (Ex. I).   \nEmerald Health Care, which operates four skilled nursing facilities throughout Nebraska, \nanticipates that the CMS mandate will cause it to lose between 25% and 10% of its staff at each of \nits locations.  Sroczynski Decl. ¶¶ 4–7 (Ex. T).  Considering that the staffing at these facilities is \nalready extremely deficient, Emerald’s long-term prospects are quite grim.  Id.  Even if it survives, \nthe mandate “will result in each [Emerald] facility turning away patients.”  Id. at ¶ 8.  \n13 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 21 of 52 PageID #: 131\nState-run healthcare facilities will also be significantly impacted.  The Alaska Psychiatric \nInstitute (“API”) estimates that “[d]espite the availability of medical and religious exemptions,” it \n“is likely to lose approximately 20 employees (8% of [its] workforce) as a result of the vaccine \nmandate.”  York Decl. ¶ 9 (Ex. B).  “Losing even 5% of its workforce would cause substantial \nharm to API because it would be extremely difficult to fill those positions.”  Id. at ¶ 10.  Similarly, \n37% of the staff at Arkansas’s seven state-run healthcare facilities are unvaccinated, and the State \n“expects that the CMS vaccine mandate will result in increased staffing shortages” for those \nproviders.  White Decl. ¶¶ 8–9 (Ex. C).  South Dakota likewise expects staff loss at its state-run \npsychiatric hospital and fears that it might result in “individuals needing emergency inpatient \npsychiatric treatment [being] held in jail settings or emergency rooms until capacity is available.”  \nRingling Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7–8 (Ex. CC). \nThat the CMS mandate would ignite these healthcare catastrophes was not a secret.  In \nMissouri, for example, it has been publicly discussed and widely anticipated for the last few \nmonths that vaccine mandates will prompt widespread resignations and intensify existing staffing \nshortages in the healthcare sector—as healthcare facilities described their prospects under the \nthreatened mandate as “dangling by a thread.”1  National media also covered this issue.  See, e.g., \nAs Vaccine Deadlines Approach, Hospitals Fear Staffing Shortages Will Occur, NPR.org (Sept. \n27,  2021),  https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/09/27/1041047608/ \n                                                 \n1 See, e.g., Emily Manley, Missouri Health Care Association says vaccine mandate will worsen \nstaffing shortage, Fox 2 News (Sept. 14, 2021), https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/missouri-\nhealth-care-association-says-vaccine-mandate-will-worsen-staffing-shortage/;  Allison  Kite  and \nTessa Weinberg, ‘Dangling by a thread’: Nursing home industry warns of staff exodus over \nvaccine mandates, Missouri Independent (Sept. 15, 2021), https://missouriindependent.com/2021/ \n09/15/dangling-by-a-thread-nursing-home-industry-warns-of-staff-exodus-over-vaccine-\nmandates/; Mike Stunson, Missouri hospital fears staff may quit over Biden vaccine mandate, \nKansas  City  Star  (Oct.  14,  2021),  https://www.kansascity.com/news/coronavirus/ \narticle254948037.html. \n14 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 22 of 52 PageID #: 132\nvaccine-deadlines-hospitals-fear-staffing-shortages.  All this shows that these adverse impacts, \nespecially in rural and underserved areas, have been widely anticipated for many weeks. \nARGUMENT \nCourts consider four factors in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction: “(1) \nthe likelihood of the movant’s success on the merits; (2) the threat of irreparable harm to the \nmovant in the absence of relief; (3) the balance between that harm and the harm that the relief \nwould cause to other litigants; and (4) the public interest.”  Watkins Inc. v. Lewis, 346 F.3d 841, \n44 (8th Cir. 2003) (citing Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C.L. Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981) \n(en banc)).  Here, all four factors favor Plaintiff States. \nI.  The Plaintiff States Are Likely To Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims. \n  The Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that (1) the CMS \nvaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious, (2) it exceeds CMS’s statutory authority and conflicts \nwith law, (3) it violates the Constitution, (4) it contravenes multiple procedural rulemaking require-\nments, and (5) CMS failed to produce a required regulatory impact analysis. \nA.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate Is Arbitrary and Capricious in Violation of the \nAPA.  \n \n  The CMS vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  As an initial matter, \nthe APA undoubtedly applies to this case.  The United States Department of Health and Human \nServices (“HHS”), which delegated its authority to and acted through CMS, is a federal agency.  \nSee Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (“[T]he APA . . . confers agency status \non any administrative unit with substantial independent authority in the exercise of specific \nfunctions.”).  And the IFC is final agency action because (1) it “mark[s] the consummation of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process,” and (2) it is a pronouncement “by which rights or obligations \nhave been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennet v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n15 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 23 of 52 PageID #: 133\n154, 177–78 (1997).  Indeed, the IFC directly determines which healthcare facilities will be eligible \nto receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.  In CMS’s words, “[p]rovider and supplier compliance \nwith the Federal rules issued under these statutory authorities are mandatory for participation in \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560. \n  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary” \nor “capricious.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  “The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires \nthat agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, \n141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021).  Courts must ensure that “the agency has acted within a zone of \nreasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably \nexplained the decision.”  Id.  “[T]he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.”’  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983).  The arbitrary-and-capriciousness standard also requires the agency “to assess \nwhether there were reliance interests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such \ninterests against competing policy concerns.”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCalifornia, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1915 (2020).  Under these principles, the IFC establishing the CMS \nvaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious for at least seven reasons. \n  First, CMS failed to reasonably explain its decision to impose its vaccine mandate despite \nthe alarming healthcare workforce shortages and the obvious risk that the mandate will exacerbate \nan already unstable situation.  In fact, CMS’s analysis goes a long way toward showing that the \nvaccine mandate will indeed throw gasoline on the fire.   \nCMS repeatedly admits that the current “endemic staff shortages” in the healthcare industry \n“may be made worse if any substantial number of unvaccinated employees leave health care \n16 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 24 of 52 PageID #: 134\nemployment altogether.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,607; see also id. at 61,608 (“[T]here may be \ndisruptions in cases where substantial numbers of health care staff refuse vaccination and are not \ngranted  exemptions  and  are  terminated,  with  consequences  for  employers,  employees,  and \npatients”); id. at 61,609 (“[I]t is true that compliance with this rule may create some short-term \ndisruption of current staffing levels for some providers or suppliers in some places.”).  And CMS \nwent further by acknowledging that “[e]ven a small fraction” of unvaccinated healthcare workers \nleaving their jobs “could disrupt facility operations.”  Id. at 61,612.   \nCMS also discussed facts showing that potential calamity awaits rural communities in \nparticular.  For instance, CMS acknowledged that “vaccination rates are disproportionately low \namong nurses and health care aides” in rural locations and other “communities that experience \nsocial risk factors.”  Id. at 61,566.  And it admitted that “early indications are that rural hospitals \nare having greater problems with employee vaccination . . . than urban hospitals.”  Id. at 61,613. \nDespite these acknowledged concerns about intensifying an already-existing healthcare \ncrisis, CMS decided to move forward anyway.  It did so because it thought that the unvaccinated \nemployees would get jobs in other healthcare positions, such as “physician and dental offices,” \nthat are not covered by the CMS vaccine mandate.  Id. at 61,607.  Yet this speculation does nothing \nto abate the debilitating harm soon to be inflicted upon the healthcare facilities falling under this \nmandate.  Indeed, it does not suggest that the healthcare worker shortage will improve but only \nthat shortages will be further concentrated among the covered healthcare facilities. \nCMS also conjectured that staffing deficiencies at facilities covered by the mandate “might \nbe offset by persons returning to the labor market who were unwilling to work at locations where \nsome other employees are unvaccinated.”  Id. at 61,607.  This was pure speculation.  CMS cited \nno evidence that such vaccinated workers exist, and it strains credulity to suggest that they do.  A \n17 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 25 of 52 PageID #: 135\nworker who harbors such fears would still have to regularly work with unvaccinated patients, and \nit is irrational to assume that they would be willing to work with unvaccinated patients but not \nunvaccinated coworkers.  \n  In the end, CMS dismissed the concerns about staffing because, it believed, “there is \ninsufficient evidence to quantify” those concerns and balance them against other risks.  Id. at \n61,569.  Instead, based on the experiences of a few private healthcare facilities that implemented \nvaccine mandates in mostly urban settings, which have much larger labor-market pools and higher \ncommunity  vaccination  rates,  CMS  optimistically  “believe[d]  that  the  COVID-19  vaccine \nrequirements . . . will result in nearly all health care workers being vaccinated.”  Id. (emphasis \nadded).  But CMS did not reference data on any past efforts to mandate COVID-19 vaccines in \nrural areas.  Making such a rosy across-the-board projection based on nothing more than the \nexperiences of a few cherry-picked healthcare providers is decidedly unreasonable.   \nThe arbitrariness is particularly apparent in CMS’s decision to act based on such scant and \ninapposite anecdotes instead of soliciting public comment and state input, as applicable statutes \nrequired the agency to do.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c) (APA), 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(1) (Social \nSecurity Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1395z (“Secretary shall consult with appropriate State agencies”).  \nObtaining insight from those sources would have provided the agency with important information \non the looming healthcare disaster.  Had CMS sought public comment, it would have heard about \ncountless situations like those recounted in the declarations supporting this motion (and in Section \nE under the Statement of Facts above).  With the fate of our strained national healthcare industry \nhanging in the balance, it is the height of arbitrariness not to solicit input from key stakeholders. \n  Despite the obvious concerns about the vaccine mandate upending significant sectors of \nthe healthcare industry, CMS remarkably concluded that existing staffing shortages are actually a \n18 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 26 of 52 PageID #: 136\nreason to impose the mandate.  In CMS’s words, “the urgent need to address COVID-related \nstaffing shortages that are disrupting patient access to care[] provides strong justification as to the \nneed to issue this” mandate.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.  Because “unvaccinated staff” are purportedly \n“at greater risk for infection” and “absenteeism,” CMS elaborated, allowing providers to continue \nhiring them might “create staffing shortages.”  Id. at 61,559.  But this speculation irrationally \nignores the obvious: that maintaining a larger pool of potential workers, even if some might have \na bout with COVID-19, is better than categorically excluding an entire class of individuals.  In \nshort, CMS’s discussion of the mandate’s projected effect on the existing healthcare crisis is \nunreasonable from beginning to end. \n  Second, CMS failed to consider the reliance interests of healthcare providers (including \nstate-run facilities) and healthcare workers.  For years, CMS has had regulations setting the \nconditions for Medicare and Medicaid participation.  See id. at 61,555 (listing the regulations \namended by the IFC).  Yet never before had CMS mandated any vaccines for staff members.  And \nsix months ago, when CMS adopted an IFC requiring two groups of healthcare providers covered \nby  this  mandate—long-term-care  (“LTC”)  facilities  and  Intermediate  Care  Facilities  for \nIndividuals  with  Intellectual Disabilities (“ICFs-IID”)—to  educate their staff on COVID-19 \nvaccines, it did not go so far as to mandate them.  See Medicare and Medicaid Programs; COVID-\n19 Vaccine Requirements for Long-Term Care (LTC) Facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities \nfor Individuals With Intellectual Disabilities (ICFs-IID) Residents, Clients, and Staff, 86 Fed. Reg. \n26306-01 (May 13, 2021).  So when CMS adopted the vaccine mandate, the agency was “not \nwriting on a blank slate,” and thus it needed to consider reliance interests.  Regents, 140 S. Ct. at \n1915. \n19 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 27 of 52 PageID #: 137\n  Many healthcare providers relied on CMS’s prior rules by hiring staff members regardless \nof their vaccination status.  See, e.g., McNea Decl. ¶ 9 (Ex. S); Naiberk Decl. ¶ 11 (Ex. M); Sharp \nDecl. ¶ 12 (Ex. X); Kahl Decl. ¶ 13 (Ex. Q).  In fact, Nebraska specifically sought out unvaccinated \napplicants because the State’s executive-branch officials decided that they would not mandate \nvaccination as a condition of working in state-run healthcare facilities.  Kahl Decl. ¶ 13 (Ex. Q).  \nBy relying on the then-existing regulations, many healthcare facilities assembled workforces \nwithout concern for vaccination.  But now those facilities stand to abruptly lose significant portions \nof their staff because of CMS’s change in course.  And the impact of that will reach far beyond the \nproviders themselves and directly harm the people in the communities they serve.  CMS did not \ndiscuss these reliance interests when adopting its mandate.   \n  Nor did CMS consider any of the reliance interests of healthcare workers.  Those indivi-\nduals have “embarked on careers” and taken jobs in reliance on the prior CMS rules.  Regents, 140 \nS. Ct. at 1914.  Now they stand to lose those jobs because of CMS’s mandate.  And the conse-\nquences of that would “radiate outward” to injure not only those workers’ families but also the \nvery people they once cared for.  Id.  “These are certainly noteworthy concerns,” and it was CMS’s \nduty to consider them, “but the agency failed to do it.”  Id.  Ignoring these critical worker-focused \nreliance interests violates the APA.   \n  Third, CMS completely “failed to consider” other “important aspects of the problem” \nbefore it.  Id. at 1910 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43) (cleaned up).  Critically, CMS did not \nacknowledge that it was infringing on a well-established area of state sovereignty.  “[T]he police \npower of a state” includes the authority to adopt regulations seeking to “protect the public health,” \nincluding the topic of mandatory vaccination.  Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24–25 \n(1905).  Though these matters “do not ordinarily concern the national government,” id. at 38, CMS \n20 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 28 of 52 PageID #: 138\nnever recognized that it was trampling on traditional State prerogatives and disrupting the existing \nfederal-state balance of authority.  Instead, CMS made explicit its desire to override contrary state \nlaw on vaccine issues.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,568 (“We intend . . . that this nationwide \nregulation preempts inconsistent State and local laws”). \n  Fourth, CMS’s own discussion betrays the illogic of its refusal to exempt healthcare \nworkers who have been previously “infected by SARS-CoV-2” and thus have developed infection-\ninduced immunity, also called natural immunity.  Id. at 61,614.  The agency cast aside that option \nbecause it perceives “uncertainties about [sic] as to the strength and length of [natural] immunity.”  \nId.  But CMS similarly acknowledges that vaccine “immunity decreases” over time “after the \nprimary vaccine series.”  Id. at 61,562.  And the agency elsewhere recognized the value of natural \nimmunity when it said that each day 100,000 people are “recover[ing] from infection,” that they \n“are no longer sources of future infections,” and that their natural immunity “reduce[s] the risk to \nboth health care staff and patients substantially.”  Id. at 61,604 (emphasis added).  Simply put, \nCMS’s inconsistencies on natural immunity demonstrate the unreasonableness of its decision. \n  CMS also ignored key evidence indicating that natural immunity effectively guards against \nthe Delta variant.  A widely publicized study of a large population of patients in Israel found that \nvaccinated people who had not been previously infected had 13 times higher odds of experiencing \na breakthrough infection with the Delta variant than patients who had recovered from COVID but \nwere never vaccinated.  Sevan Gazit et al., Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-\ninduced  immunity:  Reinfections  versus  breakthrough  infections,  medRxiv  Preprint  (2021), \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1).  It is unreasonable for CMS \nto pretend that this evidence does not exist. \n21 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 29 of 52 PageID #: 139\n  Fifth, CMS’s pronouncement about the necessity of the vaccine mandate is an impermiss-\nible “post hoc rationalization.”  Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1908 (citation omitted).  The agency did not \nfirst identify the mandate as necessary to protect public health and then produce the rule.  Rather, \nthe President directed CMS to impose the mandate as part of a comprehensive plan to federalize \nthe public-health response to COVID-19, and then the agency spent nearly two months reverse-\nengineering a justification for it.  Such post hoc rationalizations cannot satisfy APA review.   \n  Sixth, the exceedingly broad scope of healthcare providers covered by the CMS vaccine \nmandate is arbitrary.  The mandate reaches categories of healthcare facilities, such as Psychiatric \nResidential Treatment Facilities (“PRTFs”) for individuals under age 21, see 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61576, that are not related to CMS’s asserted interest in protecting elderly and infirm patients from \nCOVID-19.  Indeed, CMS recognizes that “risk of death from infection from an unvaccinated 75- \nto 84-year-old person is 320 times more likely than the risk for an 18- to 29-years old person.”  Id. \nat 61,610 n.247.  CMS provides no reasoned explanation for this overbroad approach. \n  Seventh, the vast range of workers, volunteers, and third-party contractors compelled by \nthe mandate is inexplicable.  It applies to onsite “administrative staff” and “housekeeping and food \nservices” staff “regardless of . . . patient contact.”  Id. at 61,570 (emphasis added).  It also reaches \n“any individual that . . . has the potential to have contact with anyone at the site of care.”  Id. at \n61,571 (emphasis added).  This includes “staff that primarily provide services remotely via tele-\nwork” but “occasionally encounter fellow staff . . . who will themselves enter a health care \nfacility.”  Id. at 61, 570.  And the mandate also covers a third-party vendor’s “crew working on a \nconstruction project whose members use shared facilities (restrooms, cafeteria, break rooms) \nduring their breaks.”  Id. at 61,571.  The sheer breadth of this mandate is far removed from the \n22 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 30 of 52 PageID #: 140\npurported purpose of protecting patient safety.  For all these reasons, the CMS vaccine mandate is \narbitrary and capricious under the APA. \nB.  The  CMS  Vaccine  Mandate  Exceeds  Statutory  Authority  And  Is  Not  In \nAccordance With Law.  \n \n  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “not in \naccordance with law” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority[] or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  The CMS vaccine violates this command in two ways.  First, \nthe mandate exceeds statutory authority because the statutes that CMS cites do not support \nimposing a vaccine mandate.  Second, the mandate conflicts with 42 U.S.C. § 1395 by imper-\nmissibly authorizing CMS officials to control the selection of healthcare workers. \n1.  The mandate exceeds CMS’s statutory authority. \nCMS’s purported statutory authority for its vaccine mandate rests on two sets of laws.  See \n86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.  First, the agency relies on two statutes that give general rulemaking power \nto HHS.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1302(a) (“the Secretary of Health and Human Services . . . shall make \nand publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this Act, as may be necessary to the \nefficient administration of the functions with which [he] is charged under this Act”); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395hh(a)(1) (providing that the “Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary \nto carry out the administration of the insurance programs under” Title 18 of the Social Security \nAct).  Second, CMS invokes other more specific statutes that supposedly give it authority to \nimpose the mandate on the covered classes of healthcare facilities.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.   \n  Before analyzing the statutory text, it is important to assess the magnitude of what CMS \nhas done.  Amidst an ongoing political debate about whether governments should mandate \nCOVID-19 vaccines, President Biden announced that his administration would implement a slew \nof them, including CMS’s mandate.  See Biden Speech, supra.  This is a brazen attempt to \n23 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 31 of 52 PageID #: 141\nfederalize a national public-health response to COVID-19, and it is something that CMS admits it \nhas never done before.  These statutes do not give CMS that kind of power. \n  Start with three important background principles of statutory construction often referred to \nas clear-statement rules.  First, courts “expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an \nagency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.”  Alabama Ass’n of Realtors \nv. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (per curiam); see also Whitman v. \nAm. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (Congress does not “hide elephants in mouse-\nholes”).  Exercising power of vast economic and political significance is precisely what CMS has \ndone here.  It seeks to settle a federal-state struggle on politically controversial public-health \nmatters  by  implementing  a  heavy-handed  policy  that  threatens  to  inflict  economic  ruin  on \nsignificant segments of the healthcare industry.   \n  Second, “‘it is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of Congress’ intent before \nfinding that federal law overrides’ the ‘usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.’”  \nBond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 858 (2014)  (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 \n(1991)).  CMS’s mandate seeks to usurp the police power of the States to “protect the public \nhealth” by addressing mandatory vaccination—a topic that “do[es] not ordinarily concern the \nnational government.”  Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 24–25, 38.   \n  Third, “[w]here an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of \nCongress’ power,” courts “expect a clear indication that Congress intended that result.”  Solid \nWaste Agency of N. Cook Cnty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 172 (2001).  As \nexplained in the constitutional argument below, affording a federal agency the power to mandate \nvaccines reaches beyond even the outer limits of Congress’s power.   \n24 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 32 of 52 PageID #: 142\nFor all these reasons, Congress must speak unambiguously to authorize CMS to mandate \nvaccines.  Yet it has not done so, as an examination of the relevant statutory texts demonstrates.   \nTurning to that text, the two general rulemaking statutes that CMS invokes do not suffice.  \nThose  statutes  give  CMS  the  authority  to  create  regulations  “necessary  to  the  efficient \nadministration” of its functions, 42 U.S.C. § 1302(a), or “necessary to carry out the administration” \nof Title 18 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(a)(1).  But CMS may exercise this \nauthority only if it is connected to a specific aspect of the agency’s duties.  That is why CMS \nattempts to tie each part of the vaccine mandate to a more specific statute.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,567.  Thus, CMS’s supposed authority under these general statutes piggy-backs entirely on its \nreliance on the more specific statutes.  And those specific statutes do not grant CMS the power it \nhas exercised here.  \nThe specific statutes are best divided into two groups.  The first includes statutes stating \nthat CMS may set “standards,” “criteria,” or “requirements” for certain facilities.2  But those laws \ndo not connect the referenced standards, criteria, or requirements to vaccines specifically or even \nto health or safety in general.  See Compl. ¶¶ 136–39, 143.  By their own terms, then, they do not \nremotely authorize a vaccine mandate.   \nThe second group includes statutes indicating that CMS may create rules or conditions \n                                                 \n2  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1396d(h)(1)(B)(i)  (governing  Psychiatric  Residential  Treatment \nFacilities (“PRTFs”) and mentioning “standards as may be prescribed in regulations by the \nSecretary”); 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d)(1) (governing Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with \nIntellectual Disabilities (“ICFs-IID”) and mentioning “standards as may be prescribed by the \nSecretary”);  42  U.S.C.  §  1395i–4(e)  (governing  Critical  Access  Hospitals  (“CAHs”)  and \nmentioning “criteria as the Secretary may require”); 42 U.S.C. § 1395rr(b)(1)(A) (governing End-\nStage Renal Disease (“ESRD”) facilities and mentioning “requirements as the Secretary shall by \nregulation prescribe”); 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(iii)(3)(D)(i)(IV) (governing Home Infusion Therapy \n(“HIT”) suppliers and mentioning “requirements as the Secretary determines appropriate”). \n25 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 33 of 52 PageID #: 143\nconcerning the health and safety of the individuals served.  Most of these statutes permit regu-\nlations that “ensure,” or are “necessary” for, the “health and safety” of patients or recipients of \nservices,3 while a few generically authorize CMS to adopt health and safety “standards” or \n“conditions” without mentioning necessity.4  Though these statutes mention health and safety, they \ntoo fail to authorize vaccine mandates. \nA statute’s surrounding words and sentences inform an agency’s “grant of authority by \nillustrating the kinds of measures that could be necessary.”  Alabama Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. \nat 2488.  Under “the doctrine of noscitur a sociis,” courts apply the rule that “a word is known by \nthe company it keeps” to “avoid ascribing to one word” or phrase “a meaning so broad that it is \ninconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Con-\ngress.”  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 575 (1995) (cleaned up).  Surrounding nearly all \n                                                 \n3 See 42 U.S.C. § 1395eee(f) (addressing Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly \n(“PACE”) facilities and allowing provisions “provisions  to  ensure the health and safety of \nindividuals enrolled”); 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(aa)(2)(K) (addressing Rural Health Clinics (“RHCs”) \nand mentioning “requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and \nsafety of the individuals who are furnished services”); 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(ff)(3)(B) (addressing \nCommunity Mental Health Centers (“CMHCs”) and mentioning “conditions as the Secretary shall \nspecify to ensure . . . the health and safety of individuals being furnished such services”); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395x(e)(9) (addressing hospitals and mentioning “requirements as the Secretary finds necessary \nin the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services”); 42 U.S.C. § \n1395x(dd)(2)(g) (addressing hospices and mentioning “requirements as the Secretary may find \nnecessary in the interest of the health and safety of the individuals who are provided care and \nservices”); 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(cc)(2)(J) (addressing Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation \nFacilities (“CORFs”) and mentioning “conditions of participation as the Secretary may find \nnecessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services”); 42 \nU.S.C. § 1395i–3(d)(4)(B) (addressing LTC facilities and mentioning “requirements relating to \nthe health, safety, and well-being of residents . . . as the Secretary may find necessary”); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396r(d)(4)(B) (same); 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(o)(6) (addressing Home Health Agencies (“HHAs”) \nand mentioning “conditions of participation as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of \nthe health and safety of individuals who are furnished services”).  \n4 See 42 U.S.C. § 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) (addressing Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”) \nand mentioning “health, safety, and other standards”); 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(p) (addressing facilities \nthat provide outpatient physical therapy and speech-language pathology services and mentioning \n“conditions relating to the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services”). \n26 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 34 of 52 PageID #: 144\nthe health and safety language in the statutes that CMS cites are explicit statutory standards, \nconditions, and requirements.  Those express conditions, as one statute illustrates, generally add-\nress  topics like administrative matters (“maintain[ing] clinical  records”), staff qualifications \n(nurses must be “licensed”), and the services that the facility provides (“24-hour nursing service”).  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e) (listing conditions for hospitals).   \nYet those kinds of requirements are entirely unlike vaccine mandates in at least three ways.  \nFirst, vaccines seek to safeguard patients by keeping staff members from getting sick in the first \ninstance.  Second, vaccines require staff members to submit to a personal medical intervention.  \nThird, as CMS acknowledges, vaccines entail some risks of “[s]erious adverse reactions” to staff \nmembers even though “they are rare.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,565.  No other statutory condition \nexpressly listed in CMS’s statutes exhibits any, much less all, of these characteristics.  Because \nvaccine mandates differ in kind (and not merely degree) from the statutory conditions, CMS’s \ncited statutes do not afford the vast power the agency claims. \nFinally, reading these statutes to give CMS the authority to mandate vaccines throughout \nthe healthcare field would create a serious nondelegation problem.  The nondelegation doctrine \nrequires Congress to “lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or \nbody authorized to fix such rates is directed to conform.”  Panama Ref. Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, \n429–30 (1935).  But if nondescript language about health and safety requirements is so broad that \nit allow CMS to mandate vaccines, the intelligible principle that precedent demands is nowhere to \nbe found.  For all these reasons, CMS exceeded its statutory authority in adopting its mandate. \n2.  The Mandate conflicts with 42 U.S.C. § 1395 by authorizing CMS \nofficials to control the selection of healthcare workers.  \nThe CMS vaccine mandate not only exceeds the agency’s lawful authority but also violates \na provision in the Social Security Act.  That statute—42 U.S.C. § 1395—states:  \n27 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 35 of 52 PageID #: 145\nNothing in [Title 18 of the Social Security Act] shall be construed to authorize any \nFederal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the practice \nof medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided, or over the \nselection, tenure, or compensation of any officer or employee of any institution, \nagency, or person providing health services; or to exercise any supervision or \ncontrol over the administration or operation of any such institution, agency, or \nperson. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 1395 (emphases added).  The CMS vaccine mandate violates 42 U.S.C. § 1395 because \nit authorizes federal officials at CMS to exercise “supervision” and “control” over the “selection” \nand “tenure” of employees (including state employees) and other persons “providing health \nservices.”  Id.  It does so by prohibiting covered healthcare facilities from hiring unvaccinated \nemployees and forcing those facilities to terminate—and thus end the “tenure” of—unvaccinated \nemployees.  Id.  In addition, CMS’s mandate violates this statute because it authorizes CMS \nofficials to exercise “supervision” and “control” over the “administration” and “operation” of \ninstitutions, agencies, and persons that provide health services (including state facilities and \nemployees).  Id.  Indeed, the mandate controls the administration and operation of these institutions \nby dictating their hiring and firing policies.  Thus, CMS’s actions conflict directly with the plain \nmeaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1395 and are not in accordance with law.   \nC.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate Unconstitutionally Infringes on the Authority of \nthe States and Exceeds Congress’s Enumerated Powers.  \n \n“[E]ven in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.”  Roman Cath. \nDiocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 68 (2020).  The Constitution “leaves to the several \nStates a residuary and inviolable sovereignty, reserved explicitly to the States by the Tenth Amend-\nment.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 188 (1992) (cleaned up).  As that Amendment \nsays, “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to \nthe States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  U.S. Const. amend. X. \nAs already discussed,  “the police power of a  state” includes the authority to  adopt \n28 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 36 of 52 PageID #: 146\nregulations seeking to “protect the public health,” including the topic of mandatory vaccination.  \nJacobson, 197 U.S. at 24–25.  The States “did not surrender” these powers “when becoming . . . \nmember[s] of the Union.”  Id. at 25.  Thus, in our constitutional order, “[t]he safety and the health \nof the people . . . are, in the first instance, for [the States] to guard and protect.”  Id. at 38.  To the \nextent that health measures like vaccine mandates “can be [implemented] by any government, they \ndepend, primarily, upon such action as the state, in its wisdom, may take.”  Id.  \nBy seeking to impose its vaccine mandate on millions of state and private healthcare \nworkers, CMS is arrogating to itself powers that belong to the States.  CMS admits that it never \nbefore has attempted to mandate vaccines on state or private employees.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,568 \n(“[W]e have not, until now, required any health care staff vaccinations”).  Often “the most telling \nindication of a severe constitutional problem is the lack of historical precedent” for it.  NFIB v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 549 (2012).  That is certainly true here.   \nConfirming the Tenth Amendment violation, nothing in the Constitution gives the federal \ngovernment the power CMS seeks to exercise.  While Congress has Spending Clause authority, \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1, that power does not support the CMS mandate for two reasons.   \nFirst, the federal government cannot use Congress’s spending power to “commandeer[] a \nState’s . . . administrative apparatus for federal purposes,” NFIB, 567 U.S. at 577, or “conscript \nstate [agencies] into the national bureaucratic army,” id. at 585; see also Printz v. United States, \n521 U.S. 898, 926, 933 (1997) (explaining that Congress “may not compel the States to . . . \nadminister a federal regulatory program,” and holding that Congress cannot require state officials \nto conduct a background check on prospective gun purchasers).  But that is exactly what CMS has \ndone—forcing  “State  surveyors”  to  enforce  the  mandate  by  verifying  healthcare  providers’ \ncompliance with it.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,574.  If States instruct their surveyors not to enforce the \n29 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 37 of 52 PageID #: 147\nmandate, that will disqualify Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers in their \nStates.  Kahl Decl. ¶ 12 (Ex. Q).  Forcing States to administer the mandate or jeopardize all \nMedicare and Medicaid funds flowing into their States (even to private healthcare providers) is “a \ngun to the head” that compels States to participate against their will.  NFIB, 567 U.S. at 581.   \nIt is not only state surveyors that must enforce the vaccine mandate; it is also the state \nofficials who run state-run healthcare facilities.  Those officials now must demand that their \nemployees get vaccinated and fire them if they demur.  They have become administrators of this \nfederal COVID-19 mandate.  Nor is it possible for all the state-run health facilities in the Plaintiff \nStates to immediately forego all Medicare and Medicaid funding.  That money often amounts to a \nsubstantial percentage of a facility’s annual budget.  See, e.g., Huhn Decl. ¶ 22 (Ex. J) (89% of the \nMissouri Department of Mental Health’s budget); Kahl Decl. ¶ 10 (Ex. Q) (62% of one state \nfacility’s expenditures).  But States have been given a mere month to either give up all that funding \n(and thereby imperil the people served by those facilities) or submit to this federal strong-arming \nby demanding that their employees get vaccinated.  Forcing this choice on such an abrupt timeline \nis another way in which CMS is compelling the States to enforce this unconstitutional mandate. \nSecond, CMS’s claimed statutory authority for its mandate did not provide “clear notice” \nto the States that the agency could impose vaccine requirements.  See Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. \nBd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).  “[W]hen Congress attaches conditions to a \nState’s acceptance of federal funds, the conditions must be set out ‘unambiguously.’”  Id. (quoting \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)).  But as explained above, the \nrelied-upon statutes do not authorize CMS’s unprecedented action, must less did they furnish clear \n30 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 38 of 52 PageID #: 148\nnotice of that power.  See NFIB, 567 U.S. at 584 (“[T]he spending power . . . does not include \nsurprising participating States with post-acceptance . . . conditions.”). \nJust as the Spending Clause does not authorize CMS’s mandate, neither does the Comm-\nerce Clause.  Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  Indeed, the mandate does not “regulate Commerce”—that is, it does \nnot regulate ongoing commercial activity.  Id.  Rather, it demands action—in the form of compul-\nsory vaccines—from millions of people.  NFIB, 567 U.S. at 555 (“The Framers gave Congress the \npower to regulate commerce, not to compel it”).  But the Commerce Clause is not a license to act \n“whenever enough [people] are not doing something the [federal] Government would have them \ndo.”  Id. at 553.  Much like Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to directly \nmandate the purchase of personal health insurance, so also it lacks authority to directly mandate \nvaccination.  See id.  Moreover, Defendants’ mandate does not merely require activities in the \nworkplace; it intrudes upon a deeply personal health decision that transcends commerce and work \nissues.  “Any police power to regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities, remains \nvested in the States” and has not been given to the federal government.  Id. at 557.  Defendants \nhave thus exceeded their authority by attempting to impose their mandate. \nD.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate Violates Procedural Notice-and-Comment and \nState-Consultation Requirements.  \n \n  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “without \nobservance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  The APA requires federal agen-\ncies to publish “notice of proposed rule making . . . in the Federal Register” and then “give inter-\nested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, \nviews, or arguments.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c).  The Social Security Act similarly requires CMS to \n“provide for notice of [a] proposed regulation in the Federal Register and a period of not less than \n60 days for public comment thereon.”  42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(1).   \n31 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 39 of 52 PageID #: 149\nBefore promulgating its vaccine mandate, CMS admittedly did not publish notice of pro-\nposed  rulemaking  in  the  Federal  Register  or  give  all  interested  members  of  the  public  an \nopportunity to comment.  Thus, the agency violated the governing notice-and-comment require-\nments unless it showed “good cause” that those procedural regularities “are impracticable, unne-\ncessary, or contrary to the public interest” under the circumstances.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B) (APA); \n42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(2)(C) (incorporating 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B) into the Social Security Act).  \nBut CMS failed to demonstrate that “good cause” excuses its procedural failures. \n  “The  burden  is  on  the  agency  to  establish  that  notice  and  comment  need  not  be \nprovided.”  Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d 95, 113–14 \n(2d Cir. 2018).  “[J]udicial review of a rule promulgated under an exception to the APA’s notice-\nand-comment requirement must be guided by Congress’s expectation that such exceptions will be \nnarrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced.”  Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 \nF.2d 1309, 1321 (8th Cir. 1981) (citation omitted).  “The public interest prong of the good cause \nexception is met only in the rare circumstance when ordinary procedures—generally presumed to \nserve the public interest—would in fact harm that interest.”  Mack Trucks, Inc. v. E.P.A., 682 F.3d \n87, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2012).   \n  Under these circumstances, notice-and-comment procedures would not have harmed the \npublic interest.  Far from it.  Those procedural requirements would have created a vital forum for \nStates, healthcare providers, and healthcare workers to submit critical information showing that \nthe CMS vaccine mandate portends disaster for the healthcare industry, particularly in rural \ncommunities.  This is one of the key purposes that notice-and-comment procedures serve.  See \nInt’l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 407 F.3d 1250, 1259 \n(D.C. Cir. 2005) (recognizing that the purpose of the procedural requirements is “to give affected \n32 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 40 of 52 PageID #: 150\nparties an opportunity to develop evidence in the record to support their objections” and “ensure \nthat agency regulations are tested via exposure to diverse public comment”).  By dispensing with \nthose requirements, CMS plugged its ears and ignored the mountain of evidence showing that the \nmandate threatens devastating consequences to healthcare providers throughout the nation. \nCMS purported to find “good cause to waive notice of proposed rulemaking” because it \nsupposedly “would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest . . . to undertake normal \nnotice and comment procedures.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,586.  Though CMS mentioned the alleged \nimpracticability of fulfilling notice-and-comment requirements, the focus of its reasoning was on \nthe public interest.  CMS offered two different groups of justifications, but neither suffices. \nFirst, CMS’s good-cause discussion spills much ink rehashing its justifications for the \nmandate itself—reasons such as the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, CMS’s displeasure with \ncurrent “levels of vaccination based on voluntary efforts,” and “FDA’s full licensure of the Pfizer-\nBioNTech’s Comirnaty vaccine.”  Id. at 61,584.  But it is not enough under the good-cause \nstandard to recite the reasons for the rule itself; the agency must “point to something specific that \nillustrates a particular harm that will be caused by the delay required for notice and comment.”  \nUnited States v. Brewer, 766 F.3d 884, 890 (8th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  These general \nreasons thus do not advance CMS’s good-cause argument. \nSecond, CMS places much weight on “[t]he emergence of the Delta variant” in May and \nJune 2021.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583; see also id. at 61,584 (mentioning “Delta-variant-driven \nsurging case counts beginning in summer 2021”).  But CMS undermines that reason when it \nacknowledges that “newly reported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have begun to \ntrend downward at a national level.”  Id. at 61,583.  CMS nonetheless claims, without citing any \nsupport, that “there are emerging indications of potential increases” in case counts arising in \n33 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 41 of 52 PageID #: 151\n“northern states where the weather has begun to turn colder.”  Id. at 61,584.  CMS’s undocumented \nand unexplained pronouncement of “emerging indications” cannot carry the day. \nCMS also raises its concern that “the 2021–2022 influenza season” will soon begin.  Id.  \nYet the agency simultaneously concedes that “the intensity of the upcoming 2021–2022 influenza \nseason cannot be predicted” and that “influenza activity during the 2020–2021 season was low \nthroughout the U.S.”  Id.  Moreover, one would naturally assume that the onset of the flu season \nwould be a reason to avoid critical staffing shortages at healthcare facilities for underserved \ncommunities—not to exacerbate them.  For a “risk of future harm” to “justify a finding of good \ncause,” the “risk must be more substantial than a mere possibility.”  Brewer, 766 F.3d at 890.  \nBecause CMS’s influenza concerns raise no more than a “mere possibility” of harm, they are \ninsufficient to establish good cause.  \nAnother consideration further weakens CMS’s good-cause claim: the agency’s professed \nneed to immediately implement the rule is “undermined” by its own “delay in promulgating the \n[IFC].”  Id.  President Biden announced the CMS mandate nearly two months before the agency \nreleased it.  That delay hardly suggests a situation so dire that CMS may dispense with notice-and-\ncomment procedures and the important purposes they serve. \n  Not only did CMS violate notice-and-comment requirements under the APA and Social \nSecurity Act, it also flouted the statutory obligation to “consult with appropriate State agencies” \nbefore issuing rules like this.  The relevant statute—42 U.S.C. § 1395z—provides that “the \nSecretary shall consult with appropriate State agencies . . . and may consult with appropriate local \nagencies” when “carrying out his functions, relating to determination of conditions of participation \nby providers of services, under subsections (e)(9), (f)(4), (j)(15), (o)(6), (cc)(2)(I), and[] (dd)(2), \nand (mm)(1) of section 1395x of this title, or by ambulatory surgical centers under section \n34 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 42 of 52 PageID #: 152\n1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title.”  This statute gives the States a direct procedural interest in being \nconsulted before decisions such as this. \nThe statute applies to CMS’s mandate because this agency action purports to establish \n“conditions of participation” for many of the referenced “providers of services.”  These include \nhospitals under 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9), long-term-care facilities (also known as skilled nursing \nfacilities) under 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(j) and 42 U.S.C. § 1395i–3, Home Health Agencies (“HHAs”) \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(o)(6), Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (“CORFs”) \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(cc)(2), hospices under 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(dd)(2), Critical Access \nHospitals  (“CAHs”)  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1395x(mm)(1)  and  42  U.S.C.  §  1395i–4(e),  and \nAmbulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”) under 42 U.S.C. § 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i). \nCMS admitted that it did not comply with the requirement to “consult with appropriate \nState agencies.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.  By failing to seek that input before issuing the mandate, \nCMS violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395z.   \nCMS counters that it has not violated the statute because it “intend[s] to engage in consulta-\ntions with appropriate State agencies . . . following the issuance of th[e] rule.”  86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,567.  This position is baseless.  The statute plainly requires that the consultation with States \noccur before a rule is issued.  Consultation after a rule is finalized is essentially meaningless—\nallowing the States to discuss a fait accompli.  Accordingly, the statute’s text demands the \nconsultation when the Secretary is “carrying out his functions[] relating to determination of \nconditions of participation by providers of services.”  42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  The Secretary, via CMS, \nalready made the determination that the vaccine mandate should be a condition of participation.  It \nwas at that time CMS was required to consult with the States.  Indeed, the whole purpose of this \nconsultation requirement is to enable States, which are so intimately involved with and affected \n35 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 43 of 52 PageID #: 153\nby these Medicare and Medicaid rules, to provide the agency critical information that it might be \nignoring.  Allowing this to occur after the rule takes effect defeats the point.  Since CMS did not \nconsult with the States ahead of time, the agency ran afoul of 42 U.S.C. § 1395z. \nE.  CMS Failed to Prepare the Regulatory Impact Analysis Required Under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1302. \n \n  CMS violated another mandatory obligation when it failed to prepare a regulatory impact \nanalysis (“RIA”) under 42 U.S.C. § 1302.  That statute requires that whenever the Secretary \npublishes a rule—and, therefore, “publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking”—“that may \nhave a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals, the \nSecretary shall prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory impact \nanalysis.”  42 U.S.C. § 1302(b)(1) (emphases added). \n  Congress’s use of the word “shall” in statutes indicates mandatory action.  “The first sign \nthat the statute impose[s] an obligation is its mandatory language: ‘shall.’”  Maine Cmty. Health \nOptions v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 1308, 1320 (2020).  “Unlike the word ‘may,’ which implies \ndiscretion, the word ‘shall’ usually connotes a requirement.”  Id. (citation omitted).  This explains \nwhy courts in the Eighth Circuit have construed § 1302(b)(1)’s use of the word “shall” as a require-\nment.  See Ashley Cty. Med. Ctr. v. Thompson, 205 F. Supp. 2d 1026, 1067 (E.D. Ark. 2002) \n(“[T]he Social Security Act provides that when HHS publishes a proposed rule under the Medicaid \nstatute that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of rural \nhospitals, HHS must prepare a regulatory impact analysis.”) (emphasis added) (citing 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1302(b)(1)). \n  It is indisputable that § 1302(b)(1) applies to the CMS vaccine mandate because CMS’s \ncited statutory authority falls under Titles 18 and 19 of the Social Security Act.  86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,567.  It’s also indisputable that the IFC would cover small rural hospitals located in the Plaintiff \n36 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 44 of 52 PageID #: 154\nStates.  See id. at 61,613 (defining a “small rural hospital” as one “located outside of a metropolitan \nstatistical area and has fewer than 100 beds”); Bruntz Decl. ¶ 4 (Ex. W); Tobler Decl. ¶ 2 (Ex. G).  \nAnd it’s also indisputable that the mandate will—not just “may”—have a significant impact on the \noperations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  See Statement of Facts, supra, at § E.  \nThe plain language of § 1302(b)(1) does not require certainty of a significant impact; it merely \nrequires possibility.  The evidence the Plaintiff States have submitted readily meets that standard: \nThe CMS vaccine mandate threatens to exacerbate already devastating shortages in healthcare \nstaffing by forcing small rural hospitals to terminate their unvaccinated workers.  That, in turn, \nwill compel those hospitals to close certain divisions, cancel certain services, or shutter altogether.  \nEggleston Decl. ¶¶ 16–17 (Ex. L); Mazanec Decl. ¶ 14 (Ex. R). \n  These dire consequences stretch across rural America, and their collective force required \nCMS to prepare a regulatory impact analysis—something it failed to do.  That critical procedural \nstep would have forced CMS to “describe”—and thus address—“the impact of the proposed rule” \non the Plaintiff States’ small rural hospitals.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(b)(1).  Thus, this RIA (along with \ncommentary from key stakeholders) could have helped CMS address “important aspects of the \nproblem” and consider legitimate reliance interests, as required under the APA.  Regents, 140 S. \nCt. at 1910, 1913.  But CMS did not do that. And just as CMS’s failure to comply with the APA’s \nnotice-and-comment requirements was “prejudicial error,” so too was its “complete failure” to \nprepare a regulatory impact analysis under § 1302(b)(1).  Brewer, 766 F.3d at 890–91 (cleaned \nup).  For these reasons, CMS violated 42 U.S.C. § 1302(b)(1). \nII.  The Balancing of Harms and the Public Interest Support an Injunction. \n  The remaining preliminary-injunction factors include “(2) the threat of irreparable harm to \nthe movant in the absence of relief; (3) the balance between that harm and the harm that the relief \n37 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 45 of 52 PageID #: 155\nwould cause to other litigants; and (4) the public interest.”  Watkins, Inc., 346 F.3d at 44.  These \nfactors also favor the States. \nA.  The States Face Irreparable Harm to Their Sovereign, Quasi-Sovereign, and \nProprietary Interests. \n \n  Without an injunction, the States will suffer irreparable harm to their sovereign, quasi-\nsovereign, and proprietary interests.  These injuries not only establish irreparable harm but also \ndemonstrate why the States have standing to bring their claims. \n  First, the States face direct sovereign injuries from CMS’s mandate.  As noted above, the \nmandate expresses CMS’s intent to preempt any contrary state statute or policy.  See Compl. ¶ 121 \n(collecting cites).  If not enjoined, the mandate will supersede all these sovereign state choices.   \nThis includes numerous statutes and policies of the Plaintiff States.  For example, Missouri \nhas a statute that prohibits public health orders, including vaccine mandates, if they are not \napproved by the governing bodies of political subdivisions, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 67.265, and that \nstatute may be partially preempted if the vaccine mandate goes into effect.  CMS’s mandate also \nostensibly preempts an Alaska statute that (1) broadly protects the right to object to COVID-19 \nvaccines  “based  on  religious,  medical,  or  other  grounds”  and  (2)  forbids  any  person  from \n“requir[ing] an individual to provide justification or documentation to support the individual’s \ndecision to decline a COVID-19 vaccine.”  2021 Alaska Sess. Laws ch. 2, § 17 (emphasis added).  \nSimilarly, the mandate purportedly preempts Ark. Code § 20-7-143, which is currently in effect \nand prohibits public entities in the State from requiring vaccines, and Ark. Code § 11-5-118, which \nwill go into effect in January and require that private employees be given a testing option in lieu \nof a vaccine mandate.  \nPreempting, and thus partially invalidating, duly enacted state statutes inflicts per se \nirreparable injury on the States as sovereigns.  “Any time” a State is blocked “from effectuating \n38 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 46 of 52 PageID #: 156\nstatutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  Maryland \nv. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (citing New Motor Vehicle Bd. \nof Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)).  In other \nwords, when a State is blocked from implementing its statutes, “the State necessarily suffers the \nirreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforcement of its law.”  Planned Parenthood \nof Greater Texas Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th Cir. 2013); Coalition \nfor Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 718, 719 (9th Cir. 1997).  \nSecond, the States face irreparable injuries to their quasi-sovereign or parens patriae \ninterests in protecting substantial segments of their population.  The Supreme Court has recognized \nthat each State has “a quasi-sovereign interest in the health and well-being—both physical and \neconomic—of its residents in general.”  Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, \n458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982).  This quasi-sovereign interest arises when a defendant’s conduct \nthreatens harm to a “sufficiently substantial segment of [a State’s] population,” especially where \nthe “injury to the health and welfare of [the State’s] citizens . . . is one that the State, if it could, \nwould likely attempt to address through its sovereign lawmaking powers.”  Id.  As noted above, \nseveral States have already enacted statutes to protect their citizens from vaccine mandates.   \nThe States’ quasi-sovereign interests manifest themselves in at least two ways.  More \nbroadly, the States seek to maintain the viability of healthcare providers within their borders.  But \nthe CMS mandate threatens to cripple healthcare in the States (especially in rural areas), create a \ncritical shortage of services, and jeopardize the lives and wellbeing of vulnerable citizens.  All this \neasily constitutes irreparable harm.  See Kai v. Ross, 336 F.3d 650, 656 (8th Cir. 2003) (“danger \nto plaintiffs’ health, and perhaps even their lives, gives them a strong argument of irreparable \ninjury”).  In addition, the States are home to tens of thousands of healthcare workers who are now \n39 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 47 of 52 PageID #: 157\nforced to accept an unwanted medical intervention or give up their livelihood.  Illustrating the \nirreparable harm to these workers, the mere announcement of CMS’s mandate has already com-\npelled some to resign.  Shackett Decl. ¶ 8 (Ex. Z). \n  Third, the States face irreparable injury to their proprietary interests.  Those harms are \nreadily apparent when the States operate their own healthcare facilities.  They are forced to impose \nthe CMS mandate on their own employees, and the resulting compliance costs, labor losses, \ndisruptions in day-to-day operations, and decreased revenue from turning away patients are all \nirreparable injuries.  See Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 220–21 (1994) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring) (“[A] regulation later held invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of \nnonrecoverable compliance costs.”).  Irreparable injury to further proprietary interests also occurs \nwhen States direct their surveyors to spend time and resources “assess[ing] compliance” with the \nvaccine mandate by “reviewing . . . records of staff vaccinations,” “interview[ing] staff to verify \ntheir vaccination status,” and “cit[ing] providers and suppliers when noncompliance is identified.”  \n86 Fed. Reg. at 61,574.  In addition, States will incur irreparable pocketbook harm in the form of \n(1) lost tax revenue because of reduced healthcare services in the States and (2) a diversion of state \nresources to supply “State immunization” records to healthcare providers needing to document \nstaff vaccination status.  Id. at 61,572.  All these irreparable harms show why the Plaintiff States \nneed immediate relief.   \nB.  The Balance of Harms and The Public Interest Support an Injunction. \n \n  When the party opposing the injunction is the federal government, the balance-of-harms \nfactor “merge[s]” with the public-interest factor.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 436 (2009).  That \nbalance weighs heavily in the States’ favor.  On the one hand, as explained above, the States stand \nto suffer all sorts of irreparable harms absent an injunction.  But on the other hand, an order \n40 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  9   Filed: 11/12/21   Page: 48 of 52 PageID #: 158\npreventing CMS from enforcing its unlawful mandate will inflict no cognizable injury on the \nagency  because  government  officials  “do[]  not  have  an  interest  in  the  enforcement  of  an \nunconstitutional law.”  N.Y. Progress & Prot. PAC v. Walsh, 733 F.3d 483, 488 (2d Cir. 2013).  \nSimilarly, the public interest supports an injunction because “[t]here is generally no public interest \nin the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League of Women Voters of United States v. \nNewby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \n  The mandate’s anticipated adverse impact on the healthcare worker shortage also shows \nthat the public interest  calls for an injunction.  The Plaintiff States have shown that many \nhealthcare providers, particularly in rural areas, will be forced to fire desperately needed workers, \ncancel vital services, and even shut down completely.

BIDEN, JR., in his official capacity  ) \nas the President of the United States of America,  ) \net al.,  ) \n               Defendants.  ) \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n  Two days ago, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, which \npreliminarily enjoined Defendants from implementing or enforcing 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 (Nov. 5, \n2021), the Interim Final Rule with Comment Period entitled “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; \nOmnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination,” against any and all Medicare- and Medicaid-\ncertified providers and suppliers within the States of Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, \nNebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.  Doc. [28] at 32 (2021 \nWL 5564501, at *16).  Defendants appealed, doc. [29], and now ask the Court to stay the Court’s \norder granting the injunction pending the appeal, doc. [30].  Plaintiffs oppose Defendants’ motion \nfor Stay.  See doc. [30]. \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c), “an interlocutory or final judgment in an \naction for an injunction” is “not stayed after being entered, even if an appeal is taken,” unless the \ncourt orders otherwise.  See also Fed. R. App. P. 8(a).  Courts consider four factors when \ndetermining whether a stay pending appellate review is warranted: (1) the likelihood that the \nmoving party will prevail on the merits of the appeal; (2) the likelihood that the moving party will \nbe irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) the prospect that others will be harmed if the court grants \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  35   Filed: 12/01/21   Page: 2 of 3 PageID #: 499\nthe stay; and (4) the public interest in granting the stay.  See, e.g., Banks v. Cotter Corp. (N.S.L.), \nNo. 4:20-cv-01227-JAR, 2021 WL 677912, at *1 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 22, 2021).  The Court does not \nfind these factors weigh in favor of a stay in this case, so the Court will deny Defendants’ Motion \nfor Stay. \n  First, the Court does not believe that Defendants are likely to prevail on the merits of their \nappeal in this case for the reasons stated in the Order.  See doc. [28] at 3–23; see also Louisiana v. \nBecerra, No. 3:21-cv-03970, 2021 WL 5609846 (W.D. La. Nov. 30, 2021); cf. Kentucky v. Biden, \nNo. 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT, 2021 WL 5587446 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 30, 2021).  Second, as to irreparable \nharm absent a stay, Defendants assert “hundreds or thousands of lives [will be] lost each month” \nif the “vaccination rule were not implemented.”  Doc. [31] at 3; but see 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,612 \n(noting that “predicting the full range of benefits . . . in either the short run or the next full year \nwith any degree of estimating precision is all but impossible”).  But, in the very regulation at issue, \nCMS concluded that “the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease transmission by those \nvaccinated [is] not currently known.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,615.  Defendants have not shown, then, \nthat such harm is likely.  See also doc. [28] 14–16, 29–31.  Third, the Court reiterates its conclusion \nthat “Plaintiffs’ evidence shows that facilities—rural facilities in particular—likely would face \ncrisis standards of care or will have no choice but to close to new patients or close altogether,” \nwhich “would cause significant [ ] harm to Plaintiffs’ citizens.”  Doc. [28] at 27; see also id. at 23–\n28.  Fourth, and finally, the Court reiterates its conclusion that the preliminary injunction is in the \npublic’s interest, see id. at 29–31, notably, the ability of healthcare facilities to provide proper care, \nand thus, save lives, such that a stay of the injunction would be against the public’s interest.  \n  After due consideration of these four factors, this case does not warrant a stay of the \npreliminary injunction pending the appeal. Accordingly, \n- 2 - \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  35   Filed: 12/01/21   Page: 3 of 3 PageID #: 500\n  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Stay Pending Appeal, doc. [30], \nis DENIED. \nDated this 1st day of December, 2021.  \n   \n                           \nMATTHEW T. SCHELP \n            UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n- 3 - \n ",

Plaintiffs, the States of Missouri, Nebraska, Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Wyoming, Alaska, \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, and New Hampshire bring this action to challenge the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services’ (“CMS”) Interim Final Rule with Comment Period (“IFC”) \nentitled “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination.”  \n86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021).  That IFC, also referred to as the “CMS vaccine mandate,” \nimposes an unprecedented federal vaccine mandate on nearly every full-time employee, part-time \nemployee, volunteer, and contractor working at a wide range of healthcare facilities receiving \nMedicaid or Medicaid funding.  \n2.  The CMS vaccine mandate threatens with job loss millions of healthcare workers who \nrisked their lives in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to care for strangers and friends in \ntheir communities.  The Plaintiff States seek to end this dragooning of our States’ healthcare \nheroes. \n3.  Critically, the CMS vaccine mandate also threatens to exacerbate an alarming shortage of \nhealthcare workers, particularly in rural communities, that has already reached a boiling point.  \nIndeed, the circumstances in the Plaintiff States—facts that CMS, which skipped notice-and-\ncomment rulemaking, did not fully consider—foreshadow an impending disaster in the healthcare \nindustry.  By ignoring the facts on the ground and unreasonably dismissing concerns about \nworkforce shortages, the CMS vaccine mandate jeopardizes the healthcare interests of rural \nAmericans. \n4.  This case illustrates why the police power over compulsory vaccination has always been \nthe province of—and still properly belongs to—the States.  Vaccination requirements are matters \nthat depends on local factors and conditions.  Whatever might make sense in New York City, St. \n2 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 3 of 58 PageID #: 3\nLouis, or Omaha could be decidedly counterproductive and harmful in rural communities like \nMemphis, Missouri or McCook, Nebraska.  Federalism allows States to tailor such matters in the \nbest interests of their communities.  The heavy hand of CMS’s nationwide mandate does not.  This \nCourt should thus set aside that rule as unlawful agency action under the Administrative Procedure \nAct (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706. \nPARTIES \n5.

For many years now, beginning long before the COVID-19 pandemic and reaching now \nall  the  way  forward  to  the  present,  the  healthcare  industry  in  the  United  States  has  been \nexperiencing severe workforce shortages.  \n6 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 7 of 58 PageID #: 7\n38. Like the rest of the nation, Missouri is experiencing a healthcare worker shortage.  A recent \nstudy by the Missouri State Board of Nursing and the University of Missouri shows that 97 of \nMissouri’s 114 counties have a nursing shortage.

As of January 2021, Missouri had a staff nurse vacancy of 12% with 4,894 vacant staff \nnurse positions.  Missouri Hospital Association, 2021 Workforce Report (2021), available at \nhttps://www.mhanet.com/mhaimages/Workforce/2021/2021_WF_report.pdf (last visited Nov. 9, \n2021).  Additionally, staff nurse turnover is the highest it has been in 20 years at 18.1%.  Id.  The \ncombined turnover rate among all healthcare professions is 21.5%.  Id.  \n40. The president of eight SSM Health St. Louis-area hospitals, Jeremy Fotheringham, has \nstated on the record that the nursing shortage in Missouri is “severe” with about 80 out of his 5,500 \nsystem nurses leaving each month.  Pandemic Making Nursing Shortage a Crisis in St. Louis, \nAssociated  Press  (Oct.  4,  2021),  https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/missouri/articles/ \n2021-10-03/pandemic-making-nursing-shortage-a-crisis-in-st-louis  (last  visited  Nov.  9, \n2021).  Likewise, Mercy is losing about 160 out of 8,500 system nurses each month.  Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 8 of 58 PageID #: 8\n41. Nurses  are  leaving  their  positions  because  they  are  burnt-out  from  the  COVID-19 \npandemic or they are attracted to the increased demand and inflated hourly rates of travel \nnursing.   Michelle  Munz,  St.  Louis-area  hospitals  face  staffing  crisis  as  burnout  and  high \n‘traveler’ salaries cause nurses to leave (Oct. 4, 2021), https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/ \nmetro/st-louis-area-hospitals-face-staffing-crisis-as-burnout-and-high-traveler-salaries-cause-\nnurses/article_26ad26f2-8c3a-50a6-8ddf-1253bf745d86.html (last visited Nov. 9, 2021). Fother-\ningham says, “A year ago, there were about 2,000 open traveler positions across the U.S.  They \nhave since ballooned to 30,000.”  Id.  This boom in demand for travel nurses is especially difficult \nfor smaller, rural hospitals who cannot afford to pay their nurses more to stay nor can they afford \nthe exorbitant rates of travel nurses.  See Leticia Miranda, Rural hospitals losing hundreds of staff \nto high-paid traveling nurse jobs (Sept. 15, 2021), https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-\nnews/rural-hospitals-losing-hundreds-staff-high-paid-traveling-nurse-jobs-n1279199 (last visited \nNov. 9, 2021). \n42. Just a few months ago, on August 27, 2021, Missouri Governor Michael L. Parson signed \nExecutive  Order  21-09  declaring  a  targeted  State  of  Emergency  for  Missouri’s  healthcare \nsystem.  Mo. Exec. Order 21-09 (Aug. 27, 2021), available at https://www.sos.mo.gov/library/ \nreference/orders/2021/eo9 (last visited Nov. 8, 2021).  The Order, which remains in effect until \nDecember 31, 2021, declared that “a state of emergency exists relative to staff shortages in the \nState’s healthcare system and the State’s recovery efforts from the COVID-19 public health \nthreat.” \n43. The Order suspended “certain statutory and regulatory provisions related to telemedicine” \nand vested state agencies, executive boards, and commissions with “authority [1] to waive or \nsuspend statutory or regulatory requirements, [. . .] where strict compliance would hinder the \n8 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 9 of 58 PageID #: 9\nState’s recovery from COVID-19, and [2] to ease licensing requirements to eliminate barriers to \nthe provision of health care services and other professions.”  Specifically, the Director of the \nMissouri Department of Health and Senior Services may temporarily waive or suspend any \nrequirements or rules that would “prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action by the department to \nrespond to staff shortages[.]”  The Order also “direct[ed] the members of the [Missouri] National \nGuard to provide assistance to the Department of Health and Senior Services to ensure on-time \nreporting of data in electronic records from medical providers relative to COVID-19 testing, and \nas otherwise needed to help aid the department to respond to staff shortages[.]” \n44. According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, there were 48 Small \nRural Hospitals operating in the State of Missouri as of September 24, 2020.  Missouri Rural \nHospitals and Critical Access Hospitals, Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services \n(Sept.  24,  2020),  available  at  https://health.mo.gov/living/families/ruralhealth/pdf/rural-\nhospitals.pdf (last visited Nov. 8, 2021). \n45. Dr. Randy Tobler, CEO of Scotland County Hospital in Memphis, Missouri—a small rural \nhospital—believes a COVID-19 vaccine mandate will encourage his staff to quit rather than \nreceive the vaccine.  Elle Reeve, A Covid-19 vaccine mandate won’t force staff at this rural \nMissouri hospital to get the shot, CEO says. It will make them quit., CNN (Oct. 12, 2021), \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/us/unvaccinated-missouri-hospital-covid-19/index.html  (last \nvisited Nov. 8, 2021).  According to Dr. Tobler: “There were people in the hospital that freely \nshared that if the vaccine mandate happened . . . , they would not work here.  That’s just something \nthey weren’t going to put in their body.”  Id.  The hospital has already lost 10 of its 57 nurses \n(approximately 18 percent) since the pandemic began and, at times, has had to turn away patients \namid a surge in COVID-19 cases due to staff shortages.  Lauren Weber Kaiser, In Missouri, the \n9 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 10 of 58 PageID #: 10\nlack of a vaccine mandate becomes competitive advantage in hospital staffing wars, St. Louis Post-\nDispatch  (Aug.  31,  2021),  https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/coronavirus/in-\nmissouri-the-lack-of-a-vaccine-mandate-becomes-competitive-advantage-in-hospital-staffing-\nwars/article_64cc03c0-5924-578e-9adc-d26e0e43db11.html.  To fill the gaps, the hospital has \nhired travel nurses, which cost $200 an hour or more—a price that small rural hospitals cannot \neasily afford.  Id.  \n46. Nebraska likewise has been experiencing a significant shortage in healthcare workers.  This \ncrisis started long before the COVID-19 pandemic began.  For example, the latest statistics \navailable from 2018 indicate that more than 4,300 job openings for registered nurses existed in \nNebraska. \n47. According to data from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, nine \nassisted living facilities and 20 nursing homes in rural Nebraska have closed since 2019.   \n48. Just a few months ago, on August 26, 2021, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, much like \nMissouri Governor Parson, issued Executive Order No. 21-12.  That order declared that “Nebraska \nhospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities are facing a shortage of health care professionals” \nand that “a hospital capacity emergency exists.”  Neb. Exec. Order 21-12 (Aug. 26, 2021), \navailable  at  https://www.dropbox.com/s/sm3dpu7t094ymum/Executive%20Order%2021-\n12%20-%20Additional%20Healthcare%20Workforce%20Capacity.pdf?dl=0 (last visited Nov. 5, \n2021).    Governor  Ricketts  issued  the  order,  which  temporarily  waived  certain  statutes  and \nregulations governing healthcare workers, to “protect[] the citizens of Nebraska from the public \nhealth threat of a hospital capacity and workforce emergency.”  Id.  The order, which “remain[s] \nin effect until December 31, 2021,” id., addressed the hospital capacity issue by “expand[ing] the \npool of healthcare professionals who are eligible to care for Nebraskans.”  Gov. Ricketts Takes \n10 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 11 of 58 PageID #: 11\nAction  to  Help  Hospitals  Increase  Staffing  (Aug.  27,  2021),  https://governor.nebraska.gov/ \npress/gov-ricketts-takes-action-help-hospitals-increase-staffing (last visited Nov. 5, 2021). \n49. Also, on August 26, 2021, Governor Ricketts announced a Directed Health Measure, see \nid., suspending certain elective surgeries that could wait four weeks or longer without substantially \nchanging a patient’s outcome.

In August 2021, just weeks before President Biden announced that his Administration \nwould create the CMS vaccine mandate, Nebraska state officials started specifically recruiting \nunvaccinated healthcare workers to address their workforce shortage.  Alyssa Lukpat and Lauren \nMcCarthy, Nebraska is recruiting unvaccinated nurses to plug a staffing shortage, N.Y. Times \n(Aug.  26,  2021),  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/us/nebraska-delta-nurses-\nunvaccinated.html (last visited Nov. 5, 2021).  The advertisements that state officials posted for \npositions in veterans’ homes, psychiatric treatment facilities, and other locations explicitly said, \n“No mandated Covid-19 vaccinations.”  Id.  \n51. In late September 2021, Troy Bruntz—the President and Chief Executive Officer of \nCommunity Hospital in McCook, Nebraska, a small rural community—announced that some of \nhis hospital’s employees will quit rather than get vaccinated.  Andrew Ozaki, Federal vaccine \nmandate  will  cause  exodus  of  staff,  rural  hospital  leader  warns,  KETV  (Sept.  29,  2021), \nhttps://www.ketv.com/article/federal-vaccine-mandate-will-cause-exodus-of-staff-rural-hospital-\n11 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 12 of 58 PageID #: 12\nleader-warns/37780945 (last visited Nov. 5, 2021).  He said that his hospital “might end up losing \na lot of services . . . that our communities definitively need[].”  Id. \n52. Mary Lanning Healthcare—a hospital in Hastings, Nebraska, which is a rural community \nwith less than 25,000 residents—is also concerned about the CMS vaccine mandate’s effect.  The \nhospital already has 45 vacancies within its 270 registered nurse staff positions, and it projects that \nthe mandate will only make matters worse.  Moreover, some of its critical units, such as its \nemergency department and intensive care unit, have current vaccination rates at or below 50%, \nthus adding to its concerns. \n53. Great Plains Health—a hospital in North Platte, Nebraska, which is a rural community with \nless than 25,000 residents—shares these concerns about the CMS vaccine mandate.  Because of \nits ongoing workforce shortages, the hospital is currently able to staff only around 70 of its 116 \nbeds.  To make matters worse, the hospital has received notice from a majority of the personnel \nwithin its behavioral health unit that they will resign rather than submit to vaccination.  Because \nits behavioral health unit is one of only two in western Nebraska, the impact of reducing those \nservices will be felt throughout the western half of the State.   \n54. Other Medicare- and Medicaid-qualifying healthcare providers have expressed similar \nconcerns about the negative impacts of the CMS vaccine mandate. \n55. As of October 24, 2021, 101 of the 195 nursing homes in Nebraska (51.8%) had staff \nvaccination rates under 75%.  Breaking down those numbers further, 24 of the 195 nursing homes \n(12.3%) had staff vaccination rates under 50%, and 77 of the 195 (39.4%) had staff vaccination \nrates between 50% and 75%.    \n12 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 13 of 58 PageID #: 13\n56. In late September 2021, Governor Ricketts publicly said: “I don’t think the Administration \nunderstands the devastating effect it will have on rural health care if they go forward with this \nvaccine mandate.”  Ozaki, supra.  \n57. Wyoming  has  also  been  experiencing  a  significant  shortage  in  healthcare  workers. \nWyoming’s hospitals have sought additional support to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe surge in hospitalized patients. \n58. To help with the healthcare workforce crisis, on September 21, 2021, Wyoming Governor \nMark Gordon activated the Wyoming National Guard to provide temporary assistance to hospitals \nthroughout Wyoming.  Governor Gordon called approximately 95 soldiers and airmen to State \nactive duty orders assigning them to hospital locations at 24 different sites within 17 Wyoming \ncounties to augment hospital and Wyoming Department of Health staff to ease workloads. \n59. The  Wyoming  National  Guard  members’  responsibilities  include  assisting  in \nenvironmental cleanup in hospital facilities; food and nutrition service; COVID-19 screening; \nmanaging personal protective equipment supplies; and other support tasks. \n60. Nearly every county in Wyoming is designated a HIPSA (health professional shortage \narea) by the Health Resources and Services Administration. \n61. Certain Wyoming healthcare providers have been forced to operate in crisis standards of \ncare in order to mitigate COVID-19 and the resultant staffing shortages, which are significant in \nWyoming. \n62. The State of Wyoming, through the Department of Health, operates several safety net \nhealthcare facilities to serve the mentally ill, the disabled, and the elderly. These facilities operate \nin rural frontier areas and experience significant staffing shortages. \n13 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 14 of 58 PageID #: 14\n63. The State of Alaska also faces a significant shortage in healthcare workers.  Alaska has \nalso been dealing with that issue before the COVID-19 pandemic began. \n64. A recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation confirmed that vaccine mandates pose \nsubstantial  threats  to  existing  workforce  shortages.    That  survey  found  that  72  percent  of \n“unvaccinated workers say they will quit” rather than submit to a vaccine mandate.  Chris Isidore \nand Virginia Langmaid, 72% of unvaccinated workers vow to quit if ordered to get vaccinated, \nCNN.com  (Oct.  28,  2021),  https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/28/business/covid-vaccine-workers-\nquit/index.html (last visited Nov. 6, 2021). \n65. The CEO of the National Rural Health Association, Alan Morgan, has acknowledged the \nserious challenge that a vaccine mandate presents for rural healthcare providers: “Obviously, it’s \ngoing to be a real challenge for these small, rural hospitals to mandate a vaccine when they’re \nalready facing such significant workforce shortages.”  Weber Kaiser, supra. \n66. The Plaintiff States anticipate that the CMS vaccine mandate will have devastating adverse \neffects on healthcare services in their States, particularly in their rural communities. \nThe Plaintiff States’ Role in Medicare and Medicaid \n67. Medicaid is a cooperative state-federal program in which States may choose to participate. \n68. Medicaid is a program that helps States finance the medical expenses of their citizens. \n69. The Plaintiff States have all entered into agreements with the federal government to \nparticipate in Medicaid. \n70. Medicare is a medical-funding program paid for and administered by the federal govern-\nment. \n71. The Plaintiff States employ state surveyors who regularly evaluate healthcare facilities’ \ncompliance  with  Medicare  and  Medicaid  requirements.    When  the  state  surveyors  conduct \n14 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 15 of 58 PageID #: 15\ninspections, they assess compliance with both federal and state regulations at the same time.  \nNebraska currently employs over 60 state surveyors who work under its Department of Health and \nHuman Service’s Division of Public Health.  Iowa currently employs about 80 state surveyors \nwithin its Health Facilities Division of the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals.  \n72. Unless state surveyors confirm a healthcare facilities’ compliance with Medicare and \nMedicaid requirements, those facilities are not entitled to obtain Medicare or Medicaid reimburse-\nments. \n73. When state surveyors find that a healthcare facility is not in compliance with federal \nMedicare or Medicaid regulations, they send the facility a violation report—known as a 2567 \nForm—informing it of the deficiencies. \n74. The Plaintiff States also have state-run healthcare facilities that receive Medicare and \nMedicaid funding. \n75. Missouri has 13 state-run healthcare facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding \nand fall within the scope of the CMS vaccine mandate.  These include five adult inpatient facilities, \none  children’s  psychiatric  hospital,  six  Intermediate  Care  Facilities  for  Individuals  with \nIntellectual Disabilities (“ICFs-IDD”), and one hospital system.  The Center for Behavioral \nMedicine, Fulton State Hospital, Northwest Missouri Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center, Southwest \nMissouri Mental Health Center, and the St. Louis Forensic Treatment Center provide inpatient and \nresidential psychiatric services.  These five facilities, which collectively have 1,127 beds, qualify \nas hospitals under the CMS vaccine mandate.  The Hawthorn Children’s Psychiatric Hospital is a \n28-bed Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility that provides acute and residential services to \nchildren and youth.  The Bellefontaine Habilitation Center, Higginsville Habilitation Center, St. \nCharles Habilitation Center, SEMO Residential Services in Sikeston and Poplar Bluff, and the \n15 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 16 of 58 PageID #: 16\nSouth County Habilitation Center each provide 24-hour accommodation, board, personal care, and \nbasic health and nursing care services to individuals with intellectual disabilities.  They qualify as \nICFs-IID under the CMS vaccine mandate.  \n76. Nebraska has two  state-run healthcare facilities that receive Medicare  and Medicaid \nfunding.  The first is the Lincoln Regional Center, which is a 250-bed inpatient psychiatric hospital \nthat falls within the scope of the CMS vaccine mandate.  It serves people who need very specialized \npsychiatric services and people who, because  of mental illness, require a highly structured \ntreatment setting.  Based on the most recently available information, only 68% of the staff at the \nLincoln Regional Center has received a COVID-19 vaccine.  The second facility is the Beatrice \nState Developmental Center.  It is a residential treatment facility dedicated to providing specialized \npsychological, medical, and developmental supports to people with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities.  It qualifies as an ICF-IID and is covered by the CMS vaccine mandate.  Based on the \nmost recently available information, only 57.5% of the staff at the Beatrice State Developmental \nCenter has received a COVID-19 vaccine. \n77. Alaska has one state-run health care facility that receives Medicare and Medicaid funding, \nthe Alaska Psychiatric Institute (“API”).  API is an 80-bed psychiatric hospital that falls within the \nCMS mandate.  The state of Alaska is required by state law to make mental health treatment \navailable at a state-operated hospital to any individual ordered to be involuntarily committed for \ntreatment under state law.  Alaska Stat. § 47.30.760. \n78. Iowa has five state-run healthcare facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding \nand fall under the CMS vaccine mandate as written. The Cherokee and Independence Mental \nHealth Institutes serve children, adolescents and adults in need of specialized psychiatric services \nand people who, because of persistent mental illness, require a highly structured treatment setting \n16 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 17 of 58 PageID #: 17\nor higher level of specialized care. These facilities serve as a provider of last resort and collectively \ntreated more than 400 people within state fiscal year 2020.  The Glenwood and Woodward \nResource Centers are residential treatment facilities dedicated to providing specialized psycho-\nlogical, medical, and developmental supports to people with intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities.  Both are licensed as an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual \nDisabilities (ICFs-IID). Today, Glenwood and Woodward are home to 286 Iowans.  The Iowa \nVeterans serves as a long-term health care facility providing nursing and residential levels of care \nfor honorably discharged veterans and their dependent spouses, surviving spouses, and gold star \nparents. It provides a continuum of care to more than 500 veterans and family members, including \nat its 113-bed licensed residential care facility.   \n79. The State of Wyoming, through the Department of Health, operates three state-run facilities \nthat receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.  The facilities are the Wyoming State Hospital, the \nWyoming Life Resource Center, and the Wyoming Retirement Center. These facilities serve the \nmentally ill, the disabled, and the elderly. These facilities operate in rural frontier areas and \nexperience significant staffing shortages. \nThe President’s Announcement of Widespread Federal Vaccine Mandates \n80. For the first six months of President Biden’s Administration, none of his agencies sought \nto impose vaccine mandates on the American people.  As recently as July 23, 2021, the White \nHouse announced that mandating vaccines is “not the role of the federal government.”  Press \nBriefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki (July 23, 2021), The White House, https://www.whitehouse. \ngov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/23/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-\n23-2021/ (last visited Nov. 5, 2021). \n17 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 18 of 58 PageID #: 18\n81. On September 9, 2021, amid flagging poll numbers due to the crisis in Afghanistan and on \nthe  southern  border,  the  Administration’s  policy  on  federal  vaccine  mandates  underwent  a \ndramatic about-face.   \n82. On September 9, President Biden gave a speech announcing his six-point Plan to “turn the \ntide  on  COVID-19.”    Joseph  Biden,  Remarks  at  the  White  House  (Sept.  9,  2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-president-\nbiden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/ (last visited Nov. 5, 2021) (“Biden Speech”).   \n83. President Biden announced that the first plank of his plan is to “require more Americans to \nbe vaccinated.”  Id.  The purpose of this plan, as he said, is to “reduce the number of unvaccinated \nAmericans.”  Id.  \n84. President Biden laid primary responsibility for the ongoing pandemic with unvaccinated \nAmericans, saying that he is “frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not \nvaccinated.”  Id.  He stated that “[t]his is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” and that the “nearly 80 \nmillion Americans [who are] not vaccinated . . . can cause a lot of damage—and they are.”  Id.  He \neven  blamed  the  unvaccinated  for  healthcare  shortages:  “The  unvaccinated  overcrowd  our \nhospitals, are overrunning the emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for \nsomeone with a heart attack . . . or cancer.”  Id.  Scolding the unvaccinated, he stated: “[O]ur \npatience is wearing thin.  And your refusal has cost all of us.”  Id.  And in an apparent effort to \nfoment national discord, he said: “For the vast majority of you who have gotten vaccinated, I \nunderstand your anger at those who haven’t gotten vaccinated.”  Id.  \n85. President Biden repeatedly said that “the vaccines provide very strong protection from \nsevere illness from COVID-19.”  Id.  \n18 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 19 of 58 PageID #: 19\n86. President Biden announced several federal vaccine mandates—(1) a mandate from the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) for companies with more than 100 \nemployees, (2) a mandate for federal employees, (3) a mandate for employees of federal contrac-\ntors and subcontractors, and (4) the CMS vaccine mandate challenged here.  Id.   \n87. President  Biden  also  expressed  a  dismissive  view  of  States  that  have  used  their \nconstitutionally guaranteed police powers to adopt contrary public-health policies.  Id.  He stated: \n“Let me be blunt.  My plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining . . . these \nlifesaving actions.”  Id.  Speaking scornfully of “governor[s]” who oppose the new federal man-\ndates, he promised that “if these governors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as \nPresident to get them out of the way.”  Id.  \nOverview of the CMS Vaccine Mandate \n88. On November 5, 2021, nearly two months after President Biden announced his federal \nvaccine mandates, CMS finally published the IFC challenged here, which contains the CMS \nvaccine mandate. 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555. \n89. The CMS vaccine mandate covers fifteen categories of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified \nproviders and suppliers.  By expanding its reach in this way, the mandate broadly sweeps in a \ndiverse set of healthcare providers.  These include, among others, rural health clinics, hospitals, \nlong-term-care facilities, and home health agencies.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569–70.  Demonstrating \nthe far reach of the mandate, CMS reported that “Medicare-participating hospitals . . . include \nnearly all hospitals in the U.S.”  Id. at 61,577. \n90. The Plaintiff States have many healthcare providers that fall within the fifteen categories \nof  Medicare-  and  Medicaid-certified  providers  and  suppliers  covered  by  the  CMS  vaccine \nmandate.  For example, Nebraska has approximately 50 Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”), \n19 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 20 of 58 PageID #: 20\n35 hospices, five Psychiatric residential treatment facilities (“PRTFs”), one Program of All-\nInclusive Care for the Elderly (“PACE”), 42 hospitals, 195 long-term-care (“LTC”) facilities, 13 \nIntermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (“ICFs-IID”), 67 home \nhealth agencies (“HHAs”), 63 Critical Access Hospitals (“CAHs”), six outpatient physical therapy \nand  speech-language  pathology  clinics,  145  Rural  Health  Clinics  (“RHCs”),  39  Federally \nQualified Health Centers (“FQHCs”), and 40 End-Stage Renal Disease (“ESRD”) facilities. \n91. CMS recognized that the “providers and suppliers regulated under this rule are diverse in \nnature, management structure, and size.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,602.  Despite this, CMS relied \npredominantly on facts and figures involving long-term-care facilities—providers who serve \nmostly elderly and often immunocompromised patients—to make its case for applying the vaccine \nmandate to fourteen other categories of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers.  See, e.g., id. \nat 61,585 (discussing “case rates among [long-term-care] facility residents,” and claiming, without \ncitation, that those facilities’ “experience may generally be extrapolated to other settings”); id. at \n61,604 (“[W]e often use [long-term-care] facilities for examples because they pose some of the \ngreatest risks for COVID–19 morbidity and mortality”).  CMS did this while acknowledging that \n“[a]ge remains a strong risk factor for severe COVID–19 outcomes,” id. at 61,566, and that “risk \nof death from infection from an unvaccinated 75- to 84-year-old person is 320 times more likely \nthan the risk for an 18- to 29-years old person,” id. at 61,610 n.247. \n92. CMS acknowledged that psychiatric residential treatment facilities serve individual under \n21 years of age, see id. at 61576, and that “rural and other community-care oriented health centers \nserve the full age spectrum and a lower fraction of severely health-impaired,” id. at 61,612.  Even \nthough the individuals served by these facilities are generally at a low risk from COVID-19, the \n20 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 21 of 58 PageID #: 21\nIFC imposed the same stringent vaccine mandate on psychiatric residential treatment facilities and \nrural health centers as it did on long-term-care facilities. \n93. CMS applied its vaccine mandate to practically  every  full-time  employee, part-time \nworker, trainee, student, volunteer, or contractor working at the covered facilities.  The mandate \nrequires vaccination for all “facility staff”—a term that includes employees, trainees, students, \nvolunteers, or contractors—“who provide any care, treatment, or other services for the facility,” \n“regardless of . . . patient contact.”  Id. at 61,570 (emphasis added).  This includes “administrative \nstaff” and “housekeeping and food services,” to name a few.  Id.  CMS also imposed its mandate \non “any individual that . . . has the potential to have contact with anyone at the site of care.”  Id. \nat 61,571 (emphasis added).  This includes “staff that primarily provide services remotely via tele-\nwork” but “occasionally encounter fellow staff . . . who will themselves enter a health care \nfacility.”  Id. at 61, 570.  Illustrating its breadth, the mandate also covers a contracted “crew \nworking on a construction project whose members use shared facilities (restrooms, cafeteria, break \nrooms) during their breaks[.]”  Id. at 61,571.  \n94. Maximizing the scope of the mandate, CMS allowed exemptions only to the extent \nnecessary to “comply with applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws and civil rights protections” \nsuch as medical exemptions required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and \nreligious exemptions required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Id. at 61,568. \n95. The IFC became immediately effective on November 5, 2021—the day it was published.  \nId. at 61,555. \n96. Covered providers must implement the CMS vaccine mandate in two 30-day phases.  Id. \nat 61,571.  Phase 1 requires that staff receive the first dose of the vaccine or request a medical or \n21 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 22 of 58 PageID #: 22\nreligious exemption by December 5, 2021.  Id.  And Phase 2 mandates that non-exempt staff be \nfully vaccinated by January 4, 2022.  Id.  \n97. CMS recognized the breadth of and expedited schedule imposed by its vaccine mandate, \nacknowledging its “near-universal applicability” to health-care staff, and observing that under the \nrule “virtually all health care staff in the U.S. will be vaccinated for COVD–19 within a matter of \nmonths.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,573.  CMS estimated that approximately 10.3 million employees will \nfall under the mandate.  Id. at 61,603. \n98. CMS settled on the draconian course of mandating vaccines because it determined that the \n“most important inducement [for vaccination] will be the fear of job loss.”  Id. at 61,607. \n99. CMS “expect[s]” its vaccine mandate “to remain relevant for some time beyond the end” \nof the formal public health emergency and anticipates retaining the mandate “as a permanent \nrequirement for facilities.”  Id. at 61,574.  \nThe CMS Vaccine Mandate and Healthcare Worker Shortages \n100.  CMS admitted that “currently there are endemic staff shortages for almost all \ncategories of employees at almost all kinds of health care providers and supplier[s].”  86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,607.  “1 in 5 hospitals,” CMS noted, “report that they are currently experiencing a critical \nstaffing shortage.”  Id. at 61,559.  In addition, “approximately 23 percent of [long-term-care] \nfacilities report[] a shortage in nursing aides; 21 percent report[] a shortage of nurses; and 10 to 12 \npercent report[] shortages in other clinical and non-clinical staff categories.”  Id.  It is thus not \nsurprising, CMS relayed, that “[o]ver half (58 percent) of nursing homes participating in a recent \nsurvey . . . indicated that they are limiting new admissions due to staffing shortages.”  Id.   \n101.  In creating the rule, CMS was “aware of concerns about health care workers \nchoosing to leave their jobs rather than be vaccinated” and knew that “there might be a certain \n22 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 23 of 58 PageID #: 23\nnumber of health care workers who choose to do so.”  Id. at 61,569.  In fact, CMS reported that “a \nlarge long term care association” recently issued a policy statement observing that “some in the \nsector fear that a vaccine mandate could lead to worker resignations.”  Id. at 61,565-66.  But CMS \ndismissed these concerns because “there is insufficient evidence to quantify” them.  Id. at 61,569.  \nInstead, CMS optimistically “believe[d] that the COVID-19 vaccine requirements . . . will result \nin nearly all health care workers being vaccinated.”  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 61,609 \n(finding that only a “relatively small fraction” of turnover “will be due to vaccination”).  \n102.  CMS repeatedly admitted that the current “endemic staff shortages . . . may be made \nworse  if  any  substantial  number  of  unvaccinated  employees  leave  health  care  employment \naltogether.”  Id. at 61,607; see also id. at 61,608 (“[T]here may be disruptions in cases where \nsubstantial numbers of health care staff refuse vaccination and are not granted exemptions and are \nterminated, with consequences for employers, employees, and patients”); id. at 61,609 (“[I]t is true \nthat compliance with this rule may create some short-term disruption of current staffing levels for \nsome providers or suppliers in some places.”).   \n103.  CMS also recognized that these staffing concerns apply even if providers do not \nlose a substantial number of employees.  In fact, “[e]ven a small fraction” of what CMS called \n“recalcitrant unvaccinated employees” who decline to take a vaccine “could disrupt facility \noperations.”  Id. at 61,612.   \n104.  CMS additionally recognized facts indicating that potential disaster awaits rural \ncommunities, including minority health-care workers in those communities.  CMS acknowledged \nthat “vaccination rates are disproportionately low among nurses and health care aides” in rural \nlocations and other “communities that experience social risk factors.”  Id. at 61,566.  And it \nadmitted that “early indications are that rural hospitals are having greater problems with employee \n23 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 24 of 58 PageID #: 24\nvaccination . . . than urban hospitals.”  Id. at 61,613.  In addition, CMS observed that “nurses and \naides in these [rural and other underprivileged] settings are more likely to be members of racial \nand  ethnic  minority  communities.”    Id.  at  61,566.    This  means  minority  workers  in  rural \ncommunities are among the most likely groups to lose their jobs under the mandate. \n105.  CMS nonetheless dismissed these workforce concerns because it thought that the \nunvaccinated employees would get jobs in other healthcare positions, such as “physician and \ndental offices,” that are not covered by the CMS vaccine mandate.  Id. at 61,607.  Yet this specula-\ntion does nothing to abate the debilitating losses threated to the healthcare facilities falling under \nthis mandate.  It does not suggest that the healthcare worker shortage will disappear but only that \nshortages will be further concentrated among the healthcare facilities covered by the CMS man-\ndate. \n106.  CMS also conjectured that staffing deficiencies at facilities covered by the mandate \n“might be offset by persons returning to the labor market who were unwilling to work at locations \nwhere some other employees are unvaccinated and hence provide some risk[] to those who have \ncompleted  the  primary  vaccination  series  for  COVID–19.”    Id.  at  61,607.    This  was  pure \nspeculation.  CMS cited no evidence that such vaccinated workers exist.  In any event, a worker \nwho harbored such fears would still have to regularly work with unvaccinated patients, and it is \nirrational to assume that they would be willing to work with unvaccinated patients but not \nunvaccinated co-workers.  \n107.  CMS additionally dismissed workforce shortage concerns by assuming “a dynamic \nlabor market” where “net employment opportunities . . . do not change.”  Id. at 61,608 (finding \n“no reason to believe” that “net employment opportunities” will “change”).  But an industry with \nadmittedly  “endemic  staff  shortages,”  id.  at  61,607,  is  not  a  dynamic  labor  market.    Net \n24 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 25 of 58 PageID #: 25\nemployment opportunities in the existing healthcare industry can and do change.  Indeed, if the \nCMS vaccine mandate drives out enough employees from particular facilities, those facilities \nmight be forced to close certain divisions, cancel certain services, or shutter altogether—any of \nwhich would decrease net employment opportunities.  \n108.  If CMS is wrong in its optimism that “nearly all health care workers” will submit \nto the mandate, the results will be disastrous.  Id. at 61,569.  CMS itself concluded that approx-\nimately 2.4 million healthcare workers will get vaccinated under this IFC in the first year.  Id. at \n61,603.  If even 10 percent of those workers decline vaccination, the healthcare industry will lose \nover 200,000 employees, dealing a devastating blow to an already struggling industry.  Id. at \n21,606. \n109.  Further confirming that this vaccine mandate threatens grave staffing concerns, \nCMS observed that many healthcare workers decline other vaccines.  It did so by noting that \n“studies on annual seasonal influenza vaccine uptake consistently show that half of health care \nworkers may resist seasonal influenza vaccination nationwide.”  Id. at 61,568. \n110.  Despite the very real concerns about the vaccine mandate pushing many healthcare \nworkers out of their jobs, CMS remarkably concluded that existing staffing shortages are actually \na reason to impose the mandate.  In CMS’s words, “the urgent need to address COVID-related \nstaffing shortages that are disrupting patient access to care[] provides strong justification as to the \nneed to issue this” mandate.  Id. at 61,567.  Because “unvaccinated staff” are “at greater risk for \ninfection” and “absenteeism,” CMS elaborated, allowing providers to continue hiring them might \n“create staffing shortages.”  Id. at 61,559.  But this speculation ignores the obvious fact that \nmaintaining a larger pool of potential workers, even if some might have a bout with COVID-19, \nis better than categorically excluding a class of individuals.  \n25 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 26 of 58 PageID #: 26\nThe CMS Vaccine Mandate’s Contradictions, Concessions, and Omissions \n111.  CMS “considered requiring daily or weekly testing of unvaccinated individuals” \ninstead of mandatory vaccination.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614.  But it chose the vaccine mandate for \none reason: because it believes that “vaccination is a more effective infection control measure.”  \nId.    In  so  doing,  CMS  failed  to  discuss  how  other  countervailing  considerations—such  as \nworkforce  shortages  and  personal  liberty  considerations—factored  into  the  rejection  of  the \nperiodic testing option.  Nor did CMS acknowledge the disparity between its rejection of testing \nand  OSHA’s  recently  issued  Emergency  Temporary  Standard  (“ETS”),  see  COVID–19 \nVaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary Standard, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402 (Nov. 5, 2021), \nwhich allows regular testing as an adequate alternative. \n112.  CMS “considered whether it would be appropriate to limit COVID-19 vaccination \nrequirements to staff who have not previously been infected by SARS-CoV-2.”  86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,614.  Yet it decided against that option because it did not think that “infection-induced \nimmunity, also called ‘natural immunity’” is “equivalent to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.”  Id. \nat 61,559.  But elsewhere, CMS recognized the value of natural immunity when it stated that each \nday 100,000 people are “recover[ing] from infection,” that they “are no longer sources of future \ninfections,” and that their natural immunity “reduce[s] the risk to both health care staff and patients \nsubstantially.”  Id. at 61,604 (emphasis added).   \n113.  CMS ignored key evidence indicating that natural immunity effectively guards \nagainst the Delta variant.  In a study of a large population of patients in Israel, vaccinated people \nwho had not been previously infected had 13 times higher odds of experiencing a breakthrough \ninfection with the Delta variant than patients who had recovered from COVID but were never \nvaccinated.  Sevan Gazit et al., Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced \n26 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 27 of 58 PageID #: 27\nimmunity:  Reinfections  versus  breakthrough  infections,  medRxiv  Preprint  (2021), \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1 (last visited Nov. 6, 2021). \n114.  CMS repeatedly said, much like President Biden had in his September 9 speech, \nthat the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are “highly effective at protecting vaccinated \npeople against symptomatic and severe COVID-19.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560.   \n115.  CMS also recognized that “the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease \ntransmission by those vaccinated [is] not currently known.”  Id. at 61,615.   \n116.  CMS’s various directives sent conflicting messages on “booster” or additional \ndoses.  On the one hand, CMS said that its mandate does not require “booster doses” or additional \ndoses of the vaccine.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,563.  But on the other hand, CMS included a “booster” \nshot in its cost calculations, id. at 61,608, and acknowledged that “[s]ome in the scientific \ncommunity believe that ‘booster’ vaccinations after 6 or 8 months would be desirable to maintain \na high level of protection against the predominant Delta version of the virus,” id. at 61,609.  CMS \nappeared to be forecasting that if it has the power to mandate vaccines, it will eventually extend \nthe mandate to include booster shots. \n117.  CMS recognized that vaccines, like all other medical interventions, are not without \nrisks.  “Serious adverse reactions also have been reported following COVID–19 vaccines,” even \nthough “they are rare.”  Id. at 61,565.  The adverse reactions include “anaphylaxis,” “thrombosis,” \nand “myocarditis and/or pericarditis,” to name a few.  Id.   \n118.  CMS never considered other important aspects of imposing its mandate.  Among \nthose are the interests of healthcare workers who—for any number of varying personal reasons—\ndo not want to take one of the currently authorized vaccines. \n27 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 28 of 58 PageID #: 28\n119.  Upon  information  and  belief,  some  religious  healthcare  institutions  received \nMedicare and Medicaid funding and will be subject to the CMS vaccine mandate.  The mandate \nwill thus require those religious institutions to terminate ministerial employees in violation of the \nFirst Amendment.  Our Lady of Guadalupe Sch. v. Morrissey-Berru, 140 S. Ct. 2049, 2061 (2020).  \nBut CMS never considered this problem when imposing its mandate.  \nThe CMS Vaccine Mandate’s Unprecedented Intrusion on States’ Police Powers \n120.  CMS repeatedly recognized that the vaccine mandate is unprecedented because \nCMS has never before mandated any vaccination.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567 (“We have not \npreviously required any vaccinations”); id. at 61,568 (“[W]e have not, until now, required any \nhealth care staff vaccinations”); id. (“We acknowledge that we have not previously imposed such \nrequirements”). \n121.  CMS made clear that the vaccine mandate is an attempt to nationalize the COVID-\n19 vaccination response.  For example, it explained that “the inconsistent web of State, local, and \nemployer COVID–19 vaccination requirements have established a pressing need for a consistent \nFederal policy mandating staff vaccination in health care settings that receive Medicare and \nMedicaid funds.”  Id. at 61,584. \n122.  CMS made clear that it intends for the vaccine mandate to preempt any arguably \ninconsistent state and local laws.  See, e.g., id. at 61,568 (“We intend . . . that this nationwide \nregulation preempts inconsistent State and local laws”); id. at 61,572 (“[T]his IFC preempts the \napplicability of any State or local law providing for exemptions to the extent such law provides \nbroader exemptions than provided for by Federal law and are inconsistent with this IFC”); id. at \n61,613 (“This rule would pre-empt some State laws that prohibit employers from requiring their \nemployees to be vaccinated for COVID–19.”). \n28 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 29 of 58 PageID #: 29\n123.  The CMS vaccine mandate requires certain state-run healthcare facilities that \nreceive Medicare or Medicaid funding to force their state employees to get vaccinated.  Id. at \n61,613 (“[T]o the extent that State-run facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding are \nprohibited by State or local law from imposing vaccine mandates on their employees, there is direct \nconflict between the provisions of this rule (requiring such mandates) and the State or local law \n(forbidding them).”).  \n124.  The CMS vaccine mandate forces certain state-run healthcare facilities that receive \nMedicare or Medicaid funding to comply with overbearing, invasive, and unnecessary record-\nkeeping obligations.  Even for the rare healthcare staff who fall outside the IFC, the facility still \nmust “identify and monitor these individuals” by “documenting and tracking [their] vaccination \nstatus.”  Id. at 61,571.  To what end or purpose, CMS does not say.  And though the mandate \npurports to require only initial vaccination and not booster shots, covered facilities must track and \ndocument the “vaccination status of any staff who have obtained any booster doses.”  Id.  Again, \nCMS does not disclose the purpose of this seemingly arbitrary demand.  In addition, “[v]accine \nexemption requests and outcomes must also be documented” and preserved.  Id. at 61,572.  This \nis so even though CMS has no interest in knowing whether healthcare facilities comply with the \nADA or Title VII.   \n125.  CMS announced that it will coopt state employees to enforce the vaccine mandate.  \nAs it explained, CMS “will advise and train State surveyors on how to assess compliance with the \nnew requirements.”  Id. at 61,574.  Those state employees will need to “review[] the entity’s \nrecords of staff vaccinations” and “interview[] staff to verify their vaccination status.”  Id.  The \nsurveyors will also “cite providers and suppliers when noncompliance is identified.”  Id.   \n29 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 30 of 58 PageID #: 30\n126.  Non-compliant healthcare providers are “subject to enforcement remedies imposed \nby CMS depending on the level of noncompliance and the remedies available under Federal law \n(for example, civil money penalties, denial of payment for new admissions, or termination of the \nMedicare/Medicaid provider agreement).”  Id. at 61,574.   \n127.  It appears that a covered healthcare provider that flatly refuses to comply—or \notherwise cooperate—with the vaccine mandate will face termination of its Medicare/Medicaid \nprovider agreement.  Id. at 61,574 (noting that the available “remedies” include “termination of \nthe Medicare/Medicaid provider agreement”); Background Press Call on OSHA and CMS Rules \nfor Vaccination in the Workplace (Nov. 4, 2021), The White House, https://www.whitehouse.gov/ \nbriefing-room/press-briefings/2021/11/04/background-press-call-on-osha-and-cms-rules-for-\nvaccination-in-the-workplace/ (last visited Nov. 8, 2021) (“If a facility were not making steps to \ncome into compliance, we have a range of remedies.  . . .  We could . . . certainly, as a last resort, \nterminate them from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.”). \n128.  CMS recognized that governing statutes require HHS Secretary Becerra to “consult \nwith appropriate State agencies” when determining the “conditions of participation by providers \nof services,” 42 U.S.C. § 1395z, and that no such consultation occurred before the IFC issued, 86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,567.  Yet CMS claimed that it did not violate that statute because it “intend[s] to \nengage in consultations with appropriate State agencies . . . following the issuance of this rule,” \nand it does not “understand the statute to impose a temporal requirement to do so in advance of \nthe issuance of this rule.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.   \nThe CMS Vaccine Mandate’s Failure to Comply with Notice and Comment Requirements \n129.  CMS recognized that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 553, and the \nSocial Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395hh(b)(1), ordinarily require notice and a comment period \n30 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 31 of 58 PageID #: 31\nbefore a rule like this one takes effect.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  But CMS “believe[d] it would be \nimpracticable and contrary to the public interest . . . to undertake normal notice and comment \nprocedures.”  Id. at 61,586.  It thus found “good cause to waive” those procedures.  Id.   \n130.  Trying to justify its good cause finding, CMS stated that “[t]he data showing the \nvital importance of vaccination” indicates that it “cannot delay taking this action.”  Id. at 61,583.  \nBut CMS did not reconcile that finding with its acknowledgement that “the effectiveness of the \nvaccine[s] to prevent disease transmission by those vaccinated [is] not currently known.”  Id. at \n61,615. \n131.  CMS recognized that although summer brought a Delta-variant-driven COVID-19 \nsurge,  “newly  reported  COVID–19  cases,  hospitalizations,  and  deaths  have  begun  to  trend \ndownward at a national level.”  Id. at 61,583.  Yet CMS still sought to immediately impose the \nvaccine  mandate  because  it  claimed,  without  citing  any  support,  that  “there  are  emerging \nindications of potential increases in . . . northern states where the weather has begun to turn colder.”  \nId. at 61,584.   \n132.  CMS  also  asserted  that  it  must  immediately  implement  the  vaccine  mandate \nbecause “the 2021–2022 influenza season” will soon begin.  Id. at 61,584.  CMS offered this \njustification while simultaneously admitting that “the intensity of the upcoming 2021–2022 \ninfluenza season cannot be predicted” and that “influenza activity during the 2020–2021 season \nwas low throughout the U.S.”  Id.  \n133.  In claiming that it must immediately implement the vaccine mandate, CMS ignored \nthat it waited almost two months after President Biden’s directive before it promulgated the IFC \nto the public. \n31 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 32 of 58 PageID #: 32\nCMS’s Cited Statutory Authority for the Vaccine Mandate \n134.  CMS’s alleged statutory authority for its vaccine mandate rests on two sets of laws.  \nId. at 61,567.  First, it relies on two statutes that grant general rulemaking power to HHS.  Id.  \nSecond, it relies on more specific statutes that purportedly give it authority to apply the vaccine \nmandate to the specific covered classes of healthcare facilities.  Id. \n135.  The two statutes that grant general rulemaking power to HHS are in the Social \nSecurity Act.  The first—42 U.S.C. § 1302(a)—provides that “the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices . . . shall make and publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, \nas may be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which [he] is charged \nunder this Act.”  The second—42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(a)(1)—states that the “Secretary shall prescribe \nsuch regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs \nunder” Title 18 of the Social Security Act (Medicaid).  These statutes do not establish that the \nSecretary may mandate vaccines. \n136.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of Psychiatric Residential \nTreatment  Facilities  (“PRTFs”)  in  the  vaccine  mandate.    That  statute—42  U.S.C.  § \n1396d(h)(1)(B)(i)—defines the term “inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under \nage 21” to “include[] only . . . inpatient services which . . . involve active treatment which meets \nsuch standards as may be prescribed in regulations by the Secretary.”  This statute implies that the \nSecretary may create regulations setting “standards” for the “active treatment” of individuals under \nage 21 needing inpatient psychiatric services.  But this statute does not establish that the Secretary \nmay impose mandatory vaccines on the staff at PRTFs. \n137.  CMS  cites  one  specific  statute  to  support  its  inclusion  of  Intermediate  Care \nFacilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (“ICFs-IID”) in the vaccine mandate.  That \n32 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 33 of 58 PageID #: 33\nstatute—42 U.S.C. § 1396d(d)(1)—defines those facilities to mean an institution whose “primary \npurpose . . . is to provide health or rehabilitative services for [intellectually disabled] individuals” \nif “the institution meets such standards as may be prescribed by the Secretary.”  This statute implies \nthat the Secretary may create standards concerning the kinds of “health or rehabilitative services” \nthe facility provides.  But this statute does not establish that the Secretary may impose mandatory \nvaccines on the staff at ICFs-IID. \n138.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of Critical Access Hospitals \n(“CAHs”) in the vaccine mandate.  That statute—42 U.S.C. § 1395i–4(e)—says that “[t]he \nSecretary shall certify a facility as a critical access hospital if the facility—(1) is located in a State \nthat has established a medicare rural hospital flexibility program . . . ; (2) is designated as a critical \naccess hospital by the State in which it is located; and (3) meets such other criteria as the Secretary \nmay require.”  This statute implies that the Secretary may create “other criteria” similar to the two \nexpressly listed requirements.  But this statute does not establish that the Secretary may impose \nmandatory vaccines on the staff at CAHs. \n139.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of End-Stage Renal Disease \n(“ESRD”) facilities in the vaccine mandate.  That statute—42 U.S.C. § 1395rr(b)(1)(A)—author-\nizes payments for end-stage renal disease services to “providers of services and renal dialysis \nfacilities  which  meet  such  requirements  as  the  Secretary  shall  by  regulation  prescribe  for \ninstitutional dialysis services and supplies . . . , transplantation services, self-care home dialysis \nsupport services which are furnished by the provider or facility, and routine professional services \nperformed by a physician during a maintenance dialysis episode . . . .”  This statute acknowledges \nthat the Secretary may create “requirements” for “institutional dialysis services,” “transplantation \n33 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 34 of 58 PageID #: 34\nservices,” and the like.  But this statute does not establish that the Secretary may impose mandatory \nvaccines on the staff at ESRD facilities. \n140.  CMS cites a few specific statutes to support its inclusion of Ambulatory Surgical \nCenters (“ASCs”) in the vaccine mandate.  The main statute that CMS cites—42 U.S.C. § \n1395k(a)(2)(F)(i)—provides that Medicaid benefits shall include payments for “services furnished \nin connection with surgical procedures specified by the Secretary . . . performed in an ambulatory \nsurgical center (which meets health, safety, and other standards specified by the Secretary in \nregulations).”  Though this statute implies that the Secretary may create regulations setting “health, \nsafety, and other standards,” it does not establish that the Secretary’s regulatory power is so broad \nthat he may mandate vaccines. \n141.  CMS cites two specific statutes to support its inclusion of Programs of All-Inclusive \nCare  for  the  Elderly  (“PACE”)  facilities  in  the  vaccine  mandate.    The  first—42  U.S.C.  § \n1395eee(f)—provides that “[t]he Secretary shall issue interim final or final regulations to carry out \nthis section,” and that “[n]othing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the Secretary \nfrom including in regulations provisions to ensure the health and safety of individuals enrolled in \na PACE program.”  The second—42 U.S.C. § 1396u–4(f)—is materially indistinguishable in its \nrelevant language.  Though these statutes authorize the Secretary to adopt some health- and safety-\nrelated regulations, they do not establish that the Secretary’s regulatory power is so broad that he \nmay mandate vaccines. \n142.  CMS cites a few specific statutes to support its inclusion of Rural Health Clinics \n(“RHCs”)  in  the  vaccine  mandate.    The  primary  statute  that  CMS  cites—42  U.S.C.  § \n1395x(aa)(2)(K)—defines the term “rural health clinic” to “mean[] a facility which,” among \ncertain qualifying factors, “meets such other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in \n34 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 35 of 58 PageID #: 35\nthe interest of the health and safety of the individuals who are furnished services by the clinic.”  \nThe expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services provided, staff qualifications, \nmedication requirements, and administrative matters.  They do not include vaccination.  This \nstatute thus does not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines. \n143.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of Home Infusion Therapy \n(“HIT”) Suppliers in the vaccine mandate.  That statute—42 U.S.C. § 1395x(iii)(3)(D)(i)(IV)—\ndefines the term “qualified home infusion therapy supplier” to “mean[] a pharmacy, physician, or \nother provider of services or supplier” that, among certain qualifying factors, “meets such other \nrequirements as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into account the standards of care for \nhome infusion therapy established by Medicare Advantage plans under part C and in the private \nsector.”  The expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services provided and staff \nqualifications.  They do not include vaccination.  This statute thus does not give the Secretary the \npower to mandate vaccines. \n144.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of facilities that provide \noutpatient physical therapy and speech-language pathology services in the vaccine mandate.  That \nstatute—42  U.S.C.  §  1395x(p)(4)(A)(v)—defines  “outpatient  physical  therapy  services”  to \nexclude services “furnished by a clinic or rehabilitation agency” that does not, among certain \nqualifying factors, “meet[] such other conditions relating to the health and safety of individuals \nwho are furnished services by such clinic or agency on an outpatient basis, as the Secretary may \nfind necessary.”  The expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services provided, \nstaff qualifications, and administrative matters.  They do not include vaccination.  This statute thus \ndoes not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines. \n35 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 36 of 58 PageID #: 36\n145.  CMS cites a few specific statutes to support its inclusion of Community Mental \nHealth Centers (“CMHCs”) in the vaccine mandate.  The primary statute that CMS cites—42 \nU.S.C. § 1395x(ff)(3)(B)—defines a “community mental health center” to “mean[] an entity that,” \namong certain qualifying factors, “meets such additional conditions as the Secretary shall specify \nto ensure . . . the health and safety of individuals being furnished such services.”  The expressly \nlisted qualifying factors include the types of services provided, staff qualifications, and admini-\nstrative matters.  They do not include vaccination.  This statute thus does not give the Secretary \nthe power to mandate vaccines. \n146.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of hospitals in the vaccine \nmandate.  That statute—42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9)—defines the term “hospital” to “mean[] an \ninstitution which,” among certain qualifying factors, “meets such other requirements as the \nSecretary finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished \nservices in the institution.”  The expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services \nprovided, staff qualifications, and administrative matters.  They do not include vaccination.  This \nstatute thus does not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines. \n147.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of hospices in the vaccine \nmandate.  That statute—42 U.S.C. § 1395x(dd)(2)(G)—says that “[t]he term ‘hospice program’ \nmeans a public agency or private organization (or a subdivision thereof) which,” among certain \nqualifying factors, “meets such other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the \ninterest of the health and safety of the individuals who are provided care and services by such \nagency or organization.”  The expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services \nprovided, staff qualifications, and administrative matters.  They do not include vaccination.  This \nstatute thus does not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines. \n36 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 37 of 58 PageID #: 37\n148.  CMS cites one specific statute to support its inclusion of Comprehensive Outpatient \nRehabilitation  Facilities  (CORFs)  in  the  vaccine  mandate.    That  statute—42  U.S.C.  § \n1395x(cc)(2)(J)—provides  that  “[t]he  term  ‘comprehensive  outpatient  rehabilitation  facility’ \nmeans a facility which,” among certain qualifying factors, “meets such other conditions of \nparticipation as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of \nindividuals  who  are  furnished  services  by  such  facility,  including  conditions  concerning \nqualifications of personnel in these facilities.”  The expressly listed qualifying factors include the \ntypes of services provided, staff qualifications, and administrative matters.  They do not include \nvaccination.  This statute thus does not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines. \n149.  CMS cites two specific statutes to support its inclusion of long-term-care (“LTC”) \nfacilities in the vaccine mandate.  The first—42 U.S.C. § 1395i–3(d)(4)(B)—states that “[a] skilled \nnursing facility must meet such other requirements relating to the health, safety, and well-being of \nresidents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find necessary.”  The \nsecond—42 U.S.C. § 1396r(d)(4)(B)—likewise provides that “[a] nursing facility must meet such \nother requirements relating to the health and safety of residents or relating to the physical facilities \nthereof as the Secretary may find necessary.”  The expressly listed qualifying factors include the \ntypes of services provided, staff qualifications, licensing requirements, sanitation issues, and \nadministrative matters.  They do not include vaccination.  These statutes thus do not give the \nSecretary the power to mandate vaccines. \n150.  CMS cites a few specific statutes to support its inclusion of Home Health Agencies \n(“HHAs”) in the vaccine mandate.  The first—42 U.S.C. § 1395x(o)(6)—defines a “home health \nagency” to “mean[] a public agency or private organization, or a subdivision of such an agency or \norganization,  which,”  among  certain  qualifying  factors  that  do  not  include  vaccination \n37 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 38 of 58 PageID #: 38\nrequirements, “meets the conditions of participation specified in [42 U.S.C. § 1395bbb(a)] and \nsuch other conditions of participation as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the \nhealth and safety of individuals who are furnished services by such agency or organization.”  The \nsecond—42 U.S.C. § 1395bbb—outlines various “conditions of participation that a home health \nagency is required to meet,” none of which include vaccination requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. § \n1395bbb(a).  That statute also says that “[i]t is the duty and responsibility of the Secretary to assure \nthat the conditions of participation and requirements specified in or pursuant to [42 U.S.C. § \n1395x(o)]  and  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  and  the  enforcement  of  such  conditions  and \nrequirements are adequate to protect the health and safety of individuals under the care of a home \nhealth agency.”  42 U.S.C. § 1395bbb(b).  While these statutes give the Secretary authority to \nprotect the health and safety of people served by HHAs, they do not give the Secretary the power \nto mandate vaccines. \nThe CMS Vaccine Mandate Harms the Plaintiff States \n151.  The CMS vaccine mandate directly injures the Plaintiff States. \n152.  The Plaintiff States are parties to Medicaid agreements with HHS.  But the CMS \nvaccine mandate seeks to transform that agreement in drastic ways far beyond any terms that the \nStates have accepted. \n153.  The Plaintiff States operate state-run healthcare facilities that receive Medicare and \nMedicaid funding.  They are thus required to impose the mandate on their own state employees. \n154.  The Plaintiff States’ surveyors are state employees who enforce Medicare and \nMedicaid compliance.  The CMS vaccine mandate seeks to commandeer those state employees to \nbecome enforcers of CMS’s unlawful attempt to federalize national vaccine policy and override \nthe States’ police power on matters of health and safety. \n38 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 39 of 58 PageID #: 39\n155.  By requiring state-run healthcare facilities and state surveyors to enforce the CMS \nvaccine mandate, the Plaintiff States will face increased enforcement costs. \n156.  By requiring state-run healthcare facilities and state surveyors to enforce the CMS \nvaccine mandate, that mandate directly infringes the Plaintiff States’ sovereign authority. \n157.  The Plaintiff States are injured because the CMS vaccine mandate purports to \npreempt their state and local laws on matters of vaccines and the rights of their citizens.  This \nviolates the Plaintiff States’ sovereign right to enact and enforce their laws.  It also violates the \nPlaintiff States’ sovereign right to exercise their police power on matters such as compulsory \nvaccination.  \n158.  For example, the CMS vaccine mandate purports to preempt Missouri’s Exec. \nOrder No. 21-10 § 3 (Oct. 28, 2021) (Gov. Parson), which prohibits state agencies from penalizing \nindividuals or businesses for non-compliance with any federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate if the \n“non-compliance is the result of an individual’s sincerely held religious belief or for medical \nreasons.”   \n159.  Similarly,  the  CMS  vaccine  mandate  purports  to  preempt  Arkansas  statutes, \nincluding Ark. Code § 20-7-143, which is currently in effect and prohibits public entities from \nrequiring vaccines, and Ark. Code § 11-5-118, which will go into effect in January and requires \nprivate employers give employees a testing option in lieu of vaccination. \n160.  The mandate similarly conflicts with the laws of the State of Alaska.  Under the \nAlaska Constitution, the State cannot mandate vaccination without running afoul of Alaskans’ \nfundamental privacy right to make decisions about medical treatment.  An individual’s freedom to \nmake medical decisions for themselves and their children is a fundamental liberty and privacy \nright under Article I, Section 22 of the Alaska Constitution.  Huffman v. State, 204 P.3d 339, 346 \n39 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 40 of 58 PageID #: 40\n(Alaska 2009).  In Huffman, the Alaska Supreme Court held that although the State had a \ncompelling interest in preventing the spread of contagious diseases, it must use the least restrictive \nmeans to achieve that interest.  Id. at 347.  In 2021, the State of Alaska enacted a statute that grants \nits citizens the right to object to COVID-19 vaccines “based on religious, medical, or other \ngrounds,” and that forbids any person from “requir[ing] an individual to provide justification or \ndocumentation to support the individual’s decision to decline a COVID-19 vaccine.”  2021 Alaska \nSess. Laws ch. 2, § 17 (emphasis added). \n161.  The Plaintiff States will suffer other pocketbook injuries.  The CMS vaccine \nmandate requires covered healthcare facilities to maintain documentation of their staff’s vacci-\nnation status.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,572.  That documentation can consist of records from the “State \nimmunization information system.”  Id.  A predictable consequence of the CMS vaccine mandate \nis thus to increase the number of people seeking documentation from the Plaintiff States regarding \nvaccination status.  See Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019).  \n162.  The Plaintiff States have quasi-sovereign and parens patriae interests in protecting \nthe rights of their citizens and vindicating them in court.  The Plaintiff States thus may sue to \nchallenge unlawful actions that “affect the [States’] public at large.”  In re Debs, 158 U.S. 561, \n584 (1895). \n163.  On information and belief, a natural and predictable consequence of the CMS \nvaccine mandate is that numerous state and private healthcare workers may be fired, retire, or quit \ntheir jobs.  This injures the Plaintiff States’ quasi-sovereign and parens patriae interest in the \nhealth and economic well-being of their citizens.  This injury is especially acute because of the \nalready critical healthcare workforce shortage that the Plaintiff States are experiencing.  An exodus \n40 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 41 of 58 PageID #: 41\nof healthcare workers further injures the Plaintiff States in that it will likely increase the burden on \nthe Plaintiff States’ unemployment insurance funds. \n164.  The Plaintiff States are injured because the CMS vaccine mandate discriminates \nbetween citizens of the Plaintiff States who are vaccinated and those who are not by denying the \nlatter employment opportunities available to the former.  The States have a quasi-sovereign and \nparens patriae interests in protecting their citizens from discriminatory policies.  See Alfred L. \nSnapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 609 (1982) (“This Court has had \ntoo much experience with the political, social, and moral damage of  discrimination not to \nrecognize that a State has a substantial interest in assuring its residents that it will act to protect \nthem from these evils.”). \n165.  Declaratory relief announcing that the CMS vaccine mandate is unlawful, an \ninjunction enjoining its enforcement, and an order vacating the IFC will remedy these harms to the \nPlaintiff States’ interests. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE – SUBSTANTIVE VIOLATION OF THE APA \nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTION NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n \n166.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n167.  HHS, which includes CMS, is a federal agency subject to the requirements of the \nAPA. \n168.  CMS’s adoption and promulgation of the vaccine mandate through an IFC was a \nmajor agency action that could not lawfully be conducted without compliance with the APA. \n169.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n41 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 42 of 58 PageID #: 42\n170.  The APA forbids federal administrative agencies from relying on post hoc rational-\nizations.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1907, \n1909 (2020) (holding that it is a “foundational principle of administrative law” to reject an \nagency’s “impermissible post hoc rationalizations”) (quoting Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699 \n(2015)).   \n171.  CMS’s conclusion that the vaccine mandate is necessary was a post hoc rational-\nization because nearly two months before the IFC issued, President Biden instructed CMS to adopt \na rule mandating vaccination for healthcare workers.  \n172.  The APA requires federal administrative agencies to engage in “reasoned decision-\nmaking.”  Allentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 379 (1998) (cleaned up).  \nAgency action is thus “lawful only if it rests on a consideration of the relevant factors” and \n“important aspects of the problem.”  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750-52 (2015) (cleaned up).  \nFailing to consider—or arbitrarily rejecting—important factors affecting the efficacy of a policy \nrenders agency action arbitrary and capricious. \n173.  CMS did not engage in reasoned decisionmaking in concluding that the vaccine \nmandate was necessary to protect patient health and safety and that the mandate will not exacerbate \nthe endemic staff shortages that already exist for almost all categories of employees at almost all \nkinds of health care providers. \n174.  CMS ignored or arbitrarily rejected important aspects of the issue and relevant \nfactors, including but not limited to the economic impacts on the healthcare industry, labor-force \ndisruptions in the healthcare industry, loss of jobs in the healthcare industry, costs to States and \ntheir agencies, the current health risks of COVID-19, the admitted current limitations of COVID-\n19 vaccines, the acknowledged benefits of natural immunity to COVID-19, and basic distinctions \n42 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 43 of 58 PageID #: 43\namong workers such as those with natural immunity to COVID-19 and those who work with \nlimited in-person contacts. \n175.  CMS ignored or arbitrarily rejected the adverse effects of resignations among \nunvaccinated healthcare workers, which is a particularly important problem for an economy \nalready experiencing a critical labor shortage in healthcare, high levels of inflation, and a supply-\nchain crisis. \n176.  CMS ignored or arbitrarily rejected the adverse effects of resignations among \nunvaccinated  healthcare  workers,  which  is  a  particularly  important  problem  facing  rural \ncommunities. \n177.  CMS ignored or arbitrarily rejected the adverse effects on States, which operate \nstate-run hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, and which incur costs associated \nwith enforcing the vaccine mandate, including enforcement through state surveyors. \n178.  CMS ignored or arbitrarily rejected the fact that the vaccine mandate will have a \ndisparate impact on minority and economically disadvantaged communities that have relatively \nlow rates of vaccination by inflicting disproportionately greater unemployment, job losses, loss of \nhealthcare services, and economic injury on those disadvantaged communities. \n179.  CMS ignored or arbitrarily rejected the interests of healthcare workers who—for \nany number of varying personal reasons—do not want to take one of the currently authorized \nCOVID-19 vaccines. \n180.  CMS ignored that the vaccine mandate will cover religious healthcare institutions \nand thus require them to terminate ministerial employees in violation of the First Amendment.  \nOur Lady of Guadalupe Sch. v. Morrissey-Berru, 140 S. Ct. 2049, 2061 (2020).  \n43 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 44 of 58 PageID #: 44\n181.  CMS ignored that its actions were contrary to law, as they were not authorized by \nthe Social Security Act, and were also unconstitutional, as the vaccine mandate violates the Tenth \nAmendment by invading the States’ police power over compulsory vaccinations. \n182.  CMS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by refusing to provide a testing option for \nemployees who decline to take one of the available COVID-19 vaccines.  This decision arbitrarily \nand capriciously conflicts with OSHA’s recently issued ETS, which allows periodic testing as an \nalternative to compulsory vaccines. \n183.  CMS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by refusing to provide an exemption to \npersons with natural immunity to COVID-19 because natural immunity is at least as effective as \nvaccination in preventing re-infection, transmission, and severe health outcomes. \n184.  CMS’s finding that the vaccine mandate is necessary was pretextual because the \nmandate is a blatant attempt to federalize public health issues involving vaccination that belong \nwithin the States’ police power. \n185.  CMS’s finding that the vaccine mandate is necessary was undermined by its delay \nin adopting it.  Vaccines have been authorized for almost a year, yet CMS did not impose this \nmandate until two months after it was instructed to do so by the President as part of his “six-point \nplan” to federalize public-health policy. \n186.  CMS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by ignoring or unreasonably rejecting the \nimportant reliance interests of many institutions and individuals in the Plaintiff States.  These \nreliance interests are longstanding and deep-seated since the federal government has never before \ntried to impose a vaccine requirement on healthcare workers.  These specific reliance interests \ninclude (1) the State’s reliance interests in their healthcare providers continuing to operate under \nthe existing rules without facing this new mandate that threatens to cause significant harm to the \n44 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 45 of 58 PageID #: 45\nStates’ citizens, particularly those in rural communities; (2) healthcare providers’ similar reliance \ninterests in staffing their facilities under the existing rules without facing this new mandate that \nthreatens their workforce, the services they provide, and their very existence; and (3) healthcare \nworkers’ reliance interests, especially the interests of minority workers in rural communities, in \nselecting a job and building a career under the existing rules. \n187.  The broad scope of healthcare providers covered by the CMS vaccine mandate is \narbitrary and capricious.  The mandate reaches many categories of healthcare facilities, such as \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities for individual under 21 years of age, see 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61576, that are not related to CMS’s asserted interest in protecting elderly and infirm patients from \nthe transmission of COVID-19.  Indeed, CMS recognizes that “risk of death from infection from \nan unvaccinated 75- to 84-year-old person is 320 times more likely than the risk for an 18- to 29-\nyears old person.”  Id. at 61,610 n.247. \n188.  The broad scope of workers, volunteers, and contractors covered by the CMS \nvaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious.  The mandate applies to “any individual that . . . has \nthe potential to have contact with anyone at the site of care.”  Id. at 61,571 (emphasis added).  This \nincludes “staff that primarily provide services remotely via telework” but “occasionally encounter \nfellow staff . . . who will themselves enter a health care facility.”  Id. at 61, 570.  And the mandate \nalso covers a contracted “crew working on a construction project whose members use shared \nfacilities (restrooms, cafeteria, break rooms) during their breaks.”  Id. at 61,571.  The vast reach \nof this mandate is far removed from the purported purpose of protecting patient safety.  \n189.  For all these reasons, CMS’s promulgation of the vaccine mandate was arbitrary, \ncapricious, and unlawful under the APA, and the IFC should be set aside. \n45 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 46 of 58 PageID #: 46\nCOUNT TWO – SUBSTANTIVE VIOLATION OF THE APA  \nACTION IN EXCESS OF AUTHORITY AND NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW \n190.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n191.  HHS, which includes CMS, is a federal agency subject to the requirements of the \nAPA. \n192.  CMS’s adoption and promulgation of the vaccine mandate through an IFC is a \nmajor agency action that could not lawfully be conducted without compliance with the APA. \n193.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“not in accordance with law” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority[] or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n194.  The CMS vaccine mandate is contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority \nbecause CMS’s statutory rulemaking power does not include the authority to impose a broad \nvaccine mandate that Congress has not authorized. \n195.  None of the statutes that CMS cited in its IFC authorize the vaccine mandate.  This \nincludes the two statutes that grant general rulemaking power to HHS—42 U.S.C. § 1302(a) and \n42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(a)(1)—and the more than a dozen specific statutes discussed above that CMS \ninvoked in support of its mandate.  \n196.  The CMS vaccine mandate is unprecedented—never before has it tried to use its \nrulemaking authority to mandate vaccines.  This confirms that CMS acted contrary to law and in \nexcess of statutory authority. \n197.  Reading CMS’s statutory authority to include the power to mandate vaccines \nthroughout an industry violates the Supreme Court’s major-questions doctrine.  See Alabama Ass’n \nof Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (per curiam) (“We \nexpect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise powers of vast economic \n46 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 47 of 58 PageID #: 47\nand political significance.”) (cleaned up); Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 \n(2001) (Congress does not “hide elephants in mouseholes”).  \n198.  Reading CMS’s statutory authority to include the power to mandate vaccines \nthroughout an industry violates the nondelegation doctrine.  See Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. \n2116, 2123 (2019) (plurality op.) (Congress must provide an “intelligible principle to guide the \ndelegee’s use of discretion” in the exercise of delegated power). \n199.  Reading CMS’s statutory authority to include the power to mandate vaccines \nthroughout an industry violates the Spending Clause for the reasons explained below. \n200.  Reading CMS’s statutory authority to include the power to mandate vaccines \nthroughout an industry violates the Tenth Amendment by trampling on the traditional authority of \nthe States to regulate public health within their borders, including the topic of compulsory \nvaccination.  See Alabama Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489 (“[Supreme Court] precedents \nrequire Congress to enact exceedingly clear language if it wishes to significantly alter the balance \nbetween federal and state power and the power of the Government over private property.”). \n201.  The CMS vaccine mandate is also contrary to law and in excess of statutory \nauthority because it conflicts with 42 U.S.C. § 1395.   \n202.  42 U.S.C. § 1395 provides that nothing in Title 18 of the Social Security Act “shall \nbe construed to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control \nover the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided, or over the \nselection, tenure, or compensation of any officer or employee of any institution, agency, or person \nproviding health services; or to exercise any supervision or control over the administration or \noperation of any such institution, agency, or person.”   \n47 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 48 of 58 PageID #: 48\n203.  The CMS vaccine mandate violates 42 U.S.C. § 1395 because it authorizes federal \nofficials at CMS to exercise “supervision” and “control” over the “selection” and “tenure” of \nemployees (including state employees) and other persons “providing health services.”  It does so \nby prohibiting covered healthcare facilities from hiring unvaccinated employees and forcing those \nfacilities to terminate—and thus end the tenure of—unvaccinated employees. \n204.  The CMS vaccine mandate also violates that statute because it authorizes federal \nofficials at CMS to exercise “supervision” and “control” over the “administration” and “operation” \nof institutions, agencies, and persons that provide health services (including state facilities and \nemployees).  It does so by dictating the hiring and firing policies of these institutions concerning \nunvaccinated workers.  \n205.  For all these reasons, CMS’s promulgation of the vaccine mandate is contrary to \nlaw and in excess of statutory authority, and the IFC should be set aside. \nCOUNT THREE – PROCEDURAL VIOLATION OF THE APA  \nACTION WITHOUT NOTICE AND COMMENT \n206.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n207.  HHS, which includes CMS, is a federal agency subject to the requirements of the \nAPA. \n208.  CMS’s adoption and promulgation of the vaccine mandate through an IFC was a \nmajor agency action that could not lawfully be conducted without compliance with the APA. \n209.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \n210.  The APA requires a federal agency to publish “notice of proposed rule making . . . \nin the Federal Register” and then “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule \nmaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments.”  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c). \n48 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 49 of 58 PageID #: 49\n211.  Prior to publishing the vaccine mandate, CMS did not publish notice of proposed \nrulemaking in the Federal Register or give all interested members of the public an opportunity to \ncomment. \n212.  The  APA’s  notice  and  comment  requirements  do  not  apply  if  “good  cause” \nestablishes that they “are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest” under the \ncircumstances.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B). \n213.  Despite attempts to do so, CMS failed to demonstrate that “good cause” excuses its \nfailure to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking. \n214.  For all these reasons, CMS’s promulgation of the vaccine mandate violated APA \nprocedural requirements, and the IFC should be set aside. \nCOUNT FOUR – PROCEDURAL VIOLATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT  \nACTION WITHOUT NOTICE AND COMMENT \n215.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n216.  HHS, which includes CMS, is a subject to the procedural rulemaking requirements \nin the Social Security Act. \n217.  Under the Social Security Act, CMS “shall provide for notice of [a] proposed \nregulation in the Federal Register and a period of not less than 60 days for public comment \nthereon.”  42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(1). \n218.  Prior to publishing the vaccine mandate, CMS did not publish notice of proposed \nrulemaking in the Federal Register or give all interested members of the public an opportunity to \ncomment. \n219.  The Social Security Act’s notice and comment requirements, like the APA’s similar \nrequirements, do not apply if “good cause” establishes that they “are impracticable, unnecessary, \n49 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 50 of 58 PageID #: 50\nor contrary to the public interest” under the circumstances.  42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(2)(C) (invoking \n5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B)). \n220.  Despite attempts to do so, CMS failed to demonstrate that “good cause” excuses its \nfailure to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking. \n221.  For all these reasons, CMS’s promulgation of the vaccine mandate violated the \nSocial Security Act’s procedural requirements, and the IFC should be set aside. \nCOUNT FIVE – VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1395z  \nFAILURE TO CONSULT WITH APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCIES \n222.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n223.  42 U.S.C. § 1395z provides that “the Secretary shall consult with appropriate State \nagencies and recognized national listing or accrediting bodies, and may consult with appropriate \nlocal agencies” when “carrying out his functions, relating to determination of conditions of \nparticipation by providers of services, under subsections (e)(9), (f)(4), (j)(15), (o)(6), (cc)(2)(I), \nand[] (dd)(2), and (mm)(1) of section 1395x of this title, or by ambulatory surgical centers under \nsection 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title.”   \n224.  42 U.S.C. § 1395z applies to the CMS vaccine mandate because that mandate \npurports to establish conditions of participation for hospitals under 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9), long-\nterm-care facilities (also known as skilled nursing facilities) under 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(j) and 42 \nU.S.C.  §  1395i–3,  Home  Health  Agencies  (“HHAs”)  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1395x(o)(6), \nComprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (“CORFs”) under 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(cc)(2), \nhospices under 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(dd)(2), Critical Access Hospitals (“CAHs”) under 42 U.S.C. § \n1395x(mm)(1) and 42 U.S.C. § 1395i–4(e), and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”) under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i). \n50 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 51 of 58 PageID #: 51\n225.  CMS admitted that it did not comply with 42 U.S.C. § 1395z’s requirement that it \n“consult with appropriate State agencies.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.   \n226.  By failing to consult with appropriate States agencies before issuing the vaccine \nmandate, CMS violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  \n227.  CMS’s “inten[t] to engage in consultations with appropriate State agencies . . . \nfollowing the issuance of th[e] rule,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567, does not satisfy 42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  \nThe statute plainly requires that the consultation with States occur before a rule is issued.  The \nstatutory text demands the consultation when the Secretary is “carrying out his functions[] relating \nto determination of conditions of participation by providers of services.”  42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  The \nSecretary, via CMS, already made his determination that the vaccine mandate should be a condi-\ntion of participation by providers.  It was at that time he was required to consult with the States.  \nSince he did not, the Secretary, acting through CMS, violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395z. \n228.  For all these reasons, CMS’s promulgation of the vaccine mandate violated 42 \nU.S.C. § 1395z, and the IFC should be set aside. \nCOUNT SIX – VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1302  \nFAILURE TO PREPARE REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS \n229.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n230.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(b)(1) provides that “[w]henever the Secretary [of HHS] publishes \na general notice of proposed rulemaking for any rule or regulation proposed under subchapter \nXVIII, subchapter XIX, or part B of [title IX of the Social Security Act] that may have a significant \nimpact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals, the Secretary shall \nprepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory impact analysis.” \n231.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(b)(1) applies to the CMS vaccine mandate because CMS’s cited \nstatutory authority for its vaccine mandate falls under Titles 18 and 19 of the Social Security Act \n51 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 52 of 58 PageID #: 52\nand because the mandate will have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number \nof small rural hospitals. \n232.  The CMS vaccine mandate threatens to exacerbate already devastating shortages in \nhealthcare staffing by forcing small rural hospitals to terminate their unvaccinated workers.  That, \nin turn, will compel those hospitals to close certain divisions, cancel certain services, or shutter \naltogether.  These dire consequences stretch across rural America, and their collective force \nrequired CMS to prepare a regulatory impact analysis. \n233.  For all these reasons, CMS’s promulgation of the vaccine mandate violated 42 \nU.S.C. § 1302(b)(1), and the IFC should be set aside. \nCOUNT SEVEN – UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXERCISE OF THE SPENDING POWER  \n234.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n235.  The CMS vaccine mandate is an unconstitutional condition on the Plaintiff States’ \nreceipt of federal funds. \n236.  “[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must \ndo so unambiguously,” so “States [can] exercise their choice knowingly.”  Pennhurst State Sch. & \nHosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  \n237.  Nothing in federal law gave States’ notice that forcing their employees at state-run \nhospitals to get a COVID-19 vaccination or forcing their state surveyors to enforce the CMS vac-\ncine mandate would be a condition of accepting federal funds. \n238.  “[C]onditions on federal funds must be related to the federal interest in particular \nnational projects or programs.”  Van Wyhe v. Reisch, 581 F.3d 639, 650 (8th Cir. 2009). \n239.  The scope of the CMS vaccine mandate reaches far beyond a federal interest in \npatient safety.  Because the mandate applies to “any individual that . . . has the potential to have \ncontact with anyone at the site of care,” it covers a contracted “crew working on a construction \n52 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 53 of 58 PageID #: 53\nproject whose members use shared facilities (restrooms, cafeteria, break rooms) during their \nbreaks.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,571 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the mandate also covers healthcare \nproviders, such as psychiatric residential treatment facilities for individual under 21 years of age, \nthat exclusively serve patients at very low risk from COVID-19.  Id. at 61576.  This vast reach of \nthe mandate is far removed from the supposed purpose of protecting patients whose healthcare \nproviders receive federal funding.   \n240.  The federal government cannot use the spending power to “commandeer[] a State’s \n. . . administrative apparatus for federal purposes,” NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012), or \n“conscript state [agencies] into the national bureaucratic army,” id. at 585. \n241.  The CMS vaccine mandate conscripts state agencies by forcing state-run hospitals \nthat fall under the mandate to either fire their unvaccinated employees or give up all their Medicare \nand Medicaid funding. \n242.  The CMS vaccine mandate conscripts state agencies by forcing state surveyors to \nenforce the mandate through verifying healthcare providers’ compliance with it.  If States instruct \ntheir surveyors not to enforce the CMS vaccine mandate, that will result in the disqualification of \nMedicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers in their States.  Forcing States to admini-\nster the CMS vaccine mandate or else jeopardize all Medicare and Medicaid funds flowing into \nthe States is a gun to the head that compels States to participate against their will.  \n243.  For all these reasons, the CMS vaccine mandate was adopted pursuant to an \nunconstitutional exercise of authority and must be invalidated. \nCOUNT EIGHT – VIOLATION OF ANTI-COMMANDEERING DOCTRINE  \n244.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n245.  “[T]he Federal Government may not compel the States to implement, by legislation \nor executive action, federal regulatory programs.”  Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 925 \n53 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 54 of 58 PageID #: 54\n(1997).  Stated differently, the Constitution does not tolerate the federal government dragooning \nstate employees “into administering federal law.”  Id. at 928. \n246.  The  CMS  vaccine  mandate  compels  States  to  administer  federal  regulatory \nprograms by forcing state-run hospitals that fall under the mandate to either fire their unvaccinated \nemployees or give up all their Medicare and Medicaid funding. \n247.  The  CMS  vaccine  mandate  compels  States  to  administer  federal  regulatory \nprograms  by  forcing  state  surveyors  to  enforce  the  mandate  through  verifying  healthcare \nproviders’ compliance with it.  If States instruct their surveyors not to enforce the CMS vaccine \nmandate, that will result in the disqualification of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and \nsuppliers in their States.  Forcing States to administer the CMS vaccine mandate or else jeopardize \nall Medicare and Medicaid funds flowing into the States is a gun to the head that compels States \nto participate against their will. \n248.  For all these reasons, the CMS vaccine mandate was adopted pursuant to an \nunconstitutional exercise of authority and must be invalidated. \nCOUNT NINE – VIOLATION OF TENTH AMENDMENT AND FEDERALISM \n249.  All preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint are hereby incorporated by reference. \n250.  The structure of the U.S. Constitution and the text of the Tenth Amendment protect \nfederalism. \n251.  The powers  not delegated by the Constitution to the federal  government are \nreserved to the States. \n252.  The CMS vaccine mandate seeks to exercise power far beyond what was delegated \nto the federal government by constitutional mandate or congressional action. \n54 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 55 of 58 PageID #: 55\n253.  Neither Article II of the U.S. Constitution nor any act of Congress authorizes CMS \nto implement the vaccine mandate. \n254.  The power to impose vaccine mandates, to the extent that any such power exists, is \na power reserved to the States. \n255.  “[T]he  police  power  of  a  state”  includes,  above  all,  the  authority  to  adopt \nregulations seeking to “protect the public health,” including the topic of mandatory vaccination.  \nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24–25 (1905).  These matters “do not ordinarily concern \nthe national government.”  Id. at 38.  \n256.  By interfering with the traditional balance of power between the States and the \nfederal government, and by acting pursuant to ultra vires federal action, CMS violated the Tenth \nAmendment and structural principles of federalism. \n257.  For all these reasons, the CMS vaccine mandate was adopted pursuant to an \nunconstitutional exercise of authority and must be invalidated. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWherefore, the Plaintiff States ask this Court to issue an order and judgment: \nA.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the CMS vaccine mandate is arbitrary and \ncapricious and unlawful under the APA; \nB.

Declaring, pursuant to  28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the CMS vaccine mandate violates APA \nprocedural requirements; \nD.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the CMS vaccine mandate violates the Social \nSecurity Act’s procedural requirements; \n55 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  1   Filed: 11/10/21   Page: 56 of 58 PageID #: 56\nE.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the CMS vaccine mandate violates 42 U.S.C. § \n1395z because CMS failed to consult with appropriate state agencies; \nF.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the CMS vaccine mandate violates 42 U.S.C. § \n1302(b)(1) because CMS failed to prepare a regulatory impact analysis; \nG.  Declaring, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, that the CMS vaccine mandate violates the Spending \nClause, the anti-commandeering doctrine, and the Tenth Amendment; \nH.  Setting aside the CMS vaccine mandate; \nI.  Preliminarily  and  permanently  enjoining  Defendants  from  imposing  the  CMS  vaccine \nmandate;   \nJ.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants from imposing the CMS vaccine mandate \nwithout first following the required notice-and-comment procedures of the APA and the Social \nSecurity Act; and \nK.  Granting any and all other relief the Court deems just and proper. \nDated: November 10, 2021      Respectfully submitted, \n \nDOUGLAS J. PETERSON     ERIC S.

Even  now,  Defendants  dismiss  as  speculative  and  irrelevant  30 \ndeclarations detailing the coming catastrophe in the healthcare industry and its specific impact on \nrural Americans.  It seems that nothing short of an immediate injunction from this Court will stop \nthis impending disaster.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue that remedy—which is warranted \nbecause all four equitable factors overwhelmingly favor Plaintiff States. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Court has Jurisdiction. \n  This Court has jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Defendants argue (at 2) that this Court \n“lacks  jurisdiction”  over  Plaintiff  States’  claims  because  “Congress  has  withdrawn  federal-\nquestion jurisdiction over claims like this one that arise under the Medicare statute,” citing 42 \nU.S.C. § 405(h), as incorporated by 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii.  This argument lacks merit. \n  As Defendants readily concede (at 19), “State governments” such as Plaintiff States are \nneither  “institution[s]”  nor  “agenc[ies]”  “dissatisfied”  with  the  Secretary’s  determination \nregarding eligibility or receipt of benefits under 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h)(1) and, therefore, “the \nStates themselves could not use that statute’s vehicle for judicial review[.]”  Thus, for this reason \nalone, Defendants’ heavy reliance on Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 \nU.S. 1 (2000), is deeply misplaced.     \n  Despite their fatal concession, Defendants argue (at 19) that Plaintiff States are no different \nthan the nursing home association in Shalala, but the Supreme Court concluded the association \nwas effectively an “institution” under § 1395cc(h)(1) due to its theory of associational standing.  \n529 U.S. at 24.  Here, by contrast, Plaintiff States’ standing arises out of their procedural right \n1 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 7 of 28 PageID #: 428\nunder the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702, and their “stake in protecting [their] quasi-sovereign interests[.]”  \nMassachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007); accord California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 571 \n(9th Cir. 2018) (holding in a multi-state challenge over the validity of HHS’s interim final rules \nseeking to enjoin enforcement of the IFRs “that the states have standing to sue on their procedural \nAPA claim”); Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 152 (5th Cir. 2015) (“In enacting the APA, \nCongress intended for those ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency action’ to have judicial \nrecourse, and the states fall well within that definition.”) (citing 5 U.S.C. § 702) (footnote omitted). \n  Moreover, unlike Plaintiff States’ challenge here, the Supreme Court’s review in Shalala \ndidn’t even involve a claim under the APA—a statute where Congress has “reinforced” the \npresumption of judicial review over administrative action.  529 U.S. at 44 n.11 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting); see also id. at 51 n.14 (noting that the “Secretary did not seek review of the Court of \nAppeals’ holding that [the] APA notice-and-comment challenge is ripe”); Illinois Council on Long \nTerm Care Inc. v. Shalala, 143 F.3d 1072, 1078 (7th Cir. 1998) (Easterbrook, J.), rev’d, 529 U.S. \n1 (2000) (“[T]he APA-based objection to adoption of the manual is within the district court’s \njurisdiction and should be addressed on the merits[.]”).  Thus, Shalala has no application to this \ncase,  and  no  “statute[]  preclude[s]  judicial  review[.]”    5  U.S.C. § 701(a)(1);  see \nalso id. §§ 702, 704. \n  In any event, Plaintiff States’ claims that arise under the Medicaid Act—as opposed to the \nMedicare Act—are not subject to § 405(h)’s jurisdictional bar.  See Avon Nursing & Rehab. v. \nBecerra, 995 F.3d 305, 311 (2d Cir. 2021) (“Unlike the Medicare Act, the Medicaid Act does not \nincorporate the Social Security Act’s claim-channeling and jurisdiction-stripping provisions, 42 \nU.S.C. § 405(g) and (h).  Federal courts thus have jurisdiction over claims arising under the \n2 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 8 of 28 PageID #: 429\nMedicaid Act pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.”).  Thus, all aspects of the IFC that purport to change \na Medicaid regulation are clearly not barred even under Defendants’ arguments.  \n  Accordingly, § 405(h), as incorporated by § 1395ii, does not divest this Court of federal-\nquestion jurisdiction under § 1331.  \nII.  The Plaintiff States Are Likely To Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims. \nA.  CMS Lacked Statutory Authority to Issue the Vaccine Mandate. \n \n  CMS openly recognized that its action was unprecedented—never before had the agency \nmandated vaccination.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567 (“We have not previously required any \nvaccinations”); see also Compl. ¶ 121 (collecting other cites).  Yet, Defendants characterize this \nsweeping mandate as a routine exercise of the Secretary’s regulatory authority.  They’re wrong. \n  To be sure, “[t]he Secretary’s administrative authority is undoubtedly broad.”  Merck & \nCo. v. United States Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 962 F.3d 531, 537 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  “But it \nis not boundless.”  Id.  The applicable statutes did not give CMS the power to impose a nationwide \nvaccine mandate.  Section 1302(a) directs the Secretary to “make and publish such rules and regu-\nlations, not inconsistent with [the Social Security Act], as may be necessary to the efficient admini-\nstration of the functions with which [the Secretary] is charged under” the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(a) (emphasis added).  Similarly, Section 1395hh(a)(1) directs the \nSecretary to “prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the \ninsurance programs under” the Medicare Act.  Id. § 1395hh(a)(1) (emphasis added).  \n  The word “administration” is the “central focus” of these statutes, and its original meaning \nin 1935 was “the practical management and direction of its various programs (including eventually \nMedicare and Medicaid), as well as their management and conduct.”  Merck, 962 F.3d at 537.  As \nthe D.C. Circuit has aptly put it:  \n3 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 9 of 28 PageID #: 430\n[F]or a regulation to be “necessary” to the programs’ “administration,” 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1302(a), 1395hh(a)(1), the Secretary must demonstrate an actual and discernible \nnexus between the rule and the conduct or management of Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms.  The regulation’s operational focus must also be on those two programs, \nand the rule’s effect must be more than tangential.  For example, the Secretary \nwould be hard pressed to defend as necessary to program administration a rule \nforbidding  vending  machines  or  smoking  breaks  at  businesses  that  employ \nMedicare or Medicaid recipients just because those measures could promote \nhealthier living and thereby reduce program costs.  In other words, the further a \nregulation strays from truly facilitating the “administration” of the Secretary’s \nduties, the less likely it is to fall within the statutory grant of authority.   \n \nId. at 537–38 (emphasis added). \n \n  Here, the IFC “strays far off the path of administration” for several reasons.  Id. at 538.  \nChief among them is that under the logic of Merck, if the Secretary could not promulgate a \nregulation  prohibiting  vending  machines  at  businesses  that  employ  Medicare  or  Medicaid \nrecipients to further healthier living and thus reduce program costs, he too would be “hard pressed” \nto defend a regulation that mandates similar recipients to adopt a plant-based diet.  A sweeping \nvaccine mandate is no different; even if vaccination promotes health and safety and thus might \nreduce program costs, it still has nothing to do with the practical “management” of Medicaid or \nMedicare. \n  Defendants’ invocation (at 21) of results-oriented purposivism—i.e., the Secretary has \nregulatory authority to promote the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid recipients—is a \npoor substitute for any text in §§ 1302(a) and 1395hh(a)(1) that supports his authority.  Indeed, \nneither statute even explicitly reference “health and safety.”  And even those specific statutes that \ndo use that phrase still fail because they do not authorize the sweeping vaccine mandate the IFC \npurports to authorize here, as Plaintiff States have argued extensively in their opening brief.  In \nany event, the mandate will actually result in patients not having access to essential healthcare \n4 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 10 of 28 PageID #: 431\nservices, as the Plaintiff States’ undisputed evidence shows; thus, it does not promote patients’ \n“health and safety.” \nB.  The CMS Mandate Is Arbitrary and Capricious.  \n \n  The Court’s review under the APA for arbitrary and capricious agency action “is not \ntoothless.  In fact, after Regents, it has serious bite.”  Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. v. United \nStates Food & Drug Admin., 16 F.4th 1130 (5th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up).  Applying that standard \nhere, the IFC fails to pass muster under the APA. \n  Exacerbating Existing Healthcare Crisis. CMS arbitrarily concluded that its mandate will \nnot exacerbate the existing healthcare crisis, and Defendants’ feeble attempt to defend that conclu-\nsion shows just how unreasonable the agency’s explanation is.  Unable to deny that CMS’s \nsupporting data focused on the experiences of a few large healthcare providers in urban settings, \nDefendants pretend that CMS also considered data on rural providers by pointing to Novant \nHealth.  Opp. at 28.  But Novant—a massive 35,000-employee healthcare system in North Carolina \nwith locations clustered mostly in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, and their suburbs—is not remotely \nrepresentative of the rural healthcare community, especially in Plaintiff States.  See id. (citing \nwebsites).  Defendants thus failed to consider the harsh impact of the mandate on rural healthcare.  \nThis failure was particularly unreasonable given CMS’s recognition that “rural hospitals are hav-\ning greater problems with employee vaccination . . . than urban hospitals.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613. \n  Defendants next cite a New York Times article that “reported a 92% compliance rate” with \nNew York State’s vaccine mandate for “650,000 hospital and nursing home workers.”  Opp. at 28.  \nBut a 92% compliance rate means that 8% of the healthcare workers in the State—a total of 52,000 \npeople—were not compliant.  This directly undercuts the sentence in the IFC that immediately \n5 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 11 of 28 PageID #: 432\nfollows the New York Times article—CMS’s unreasonable belief that its mandate “will result in \nnearly all health care workers being vaccinated.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569 (emphasis added).   \nBeyond this, the Times article raises alarming concerns that CMS failed to mention.  The \narticle noted that New York “hospitals and nursing homes continue[d] to brace for potential staff-\ning shortages,” that many “braced themselves by activating emergency staffing plans,” and that \n“even minor staff losses because of [the vaccine mandate] could put some patients at risk.”  \nThousands of N.Y. Health Care Workers Get Vaccinated Ahead of Deadline, N.Y. Times (Sept. \n28, 2021).  The article also discussed that the “governor declared a state of emergency” just days \nbefore the mandate’s deadline “allow[ing] her to use the National Guard to fill staffing shortages,” \nand that she “opened a crisis operations center for health care facilities to request help and . . . \nallow nurses and other health care workers from outside New York to assist.”  Id.1  And the article \nreported that a hospital-affiliated nursing home in Buffalo placed 20% of its staff “on unpaid leave \n. . . for refusing to get vaccinated,” causing the facility to “transfer[] staff in from other facilities, \nreduc[e] beds at the nursing home[,] and suspend[] some elective surgeries at the hospital.”  Id.  \nFaced with these disturbing facts, it was unreasonable for CMS to fail to even mention them, let \nalone to rely on this article to dismiss the national healthcare workforce shortage concerns.2  \n                                                 \n1 The governor has extended this state of emergency after recognizing that “severe under-\nstaffing in hospitals and other healthcare facilities is expected to continue.”  Executive Order 4.1 \n(Oct. 27, 2021), https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021-10/EO%204.1.pdf.   \n \n2 The facts on the ground continue to demonstrate the fallout from New York’s vaccine \nmandate.  See Long Island hospital temporarily closing ER due to nursing staff shortages amid \nvaccine  mandate,  ABC  7  New  York  (Nov.  22,  2021),  https://www.msn.com/en-\nus/health/medical/long-island-hospital-temporarily-closing-er-due-to-nursing-staff-shortages-\namid-vaccine-mandate/ar-AAR0C5t (“The emergency department at a Nassau County hospital has \ntemporarily closed due to nursing staff shortages as a result of New York’s vaccine mandate.”). \n6 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 12 of 28 PageID #: 433\n  Defendants again trot out their implausible claim that mandate-induced reductions in \nhealthcare workers will be “offset” by “a return to work of employees who have stayed out of the \nworkforce for fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2.”  Opp. at 29.  But Defendants have not even \nattempted to refute Plaintiffs’ argument that this offset argument is “pure speculation” because \n“CMS cited no evidence” that there is a significant pool of vaccinated workers who have stayed \nout  of  the  workforce  because  they  fear  vaccinated  workers  but  are  willing  to  work  with \nunvaccinated patients.  Doc. 9, at 17.  That New York continues to experience extreme healthcare \nworker  shortages  months  after  implementing  its  statewide  healthcare  vaccine  mandate \ndemonstrates that no such pool of workers exists.  See supra nn. 1-2.  \n  Defendants also insist that any workforce losses will “be dwarfed . . . by the ordinary degree \nof churn in the market of labor in the health care industry” because “there is no reason to believe \nthat the need to find staffing will be noticeably more onerous” after the mandate.  Opp. at 29.  This \nis an irrational justification.  CMS admits that the mandate covers “virtually all health care staff in \nthe U.S” and that unvaccinated workers are now disqualified from those positions.  86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,573.  Excluding an entire category of workers from most healthcare jobs is not the ordinary \n“churn” of the labor market.  It pours gasoline on an already volatile situation.  The notion that \n“business as usual” measures can counteract the impending doom is unreasonable in the extreme. \n  Unreasonably Rejects Natural Immunity. Defendants’ discussion of natural immunity \nmisses Plaintiffs’ point.  Opp. at 31–33.  Plaintiffs object to “CMS’s inconsistencies” on that topic.  \nDoc. 9, at 21.  Specifically, CMS refuses to exempt from the mandate people who previously had \nCOVID-19 while simultaneously acknowledging that each day 100,000 people are “recover[ing] \nfrom infection,” that they “are no longer sources of future infections,” and that their natural \nimmunity “reduce[s] the risk to both health care staff and patients substantially.”  86 Fed. Reg. at \n7 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 13 of 28 PageID #: 434\n61,604 (emphasis added); see also United States v. Arencibia, No. CR 18-294 ADM/DTS, 2021 \nWL 2530209, at *4 (D. Minn. June 21, 2021) (reciting the CDC’s position that “[c]ases of rein-\nfection with COVID-19 have been reported, but remain rare”).  This unexplained inconsistency in \nCMS’s position renders the mandate “arbitrary and capricious.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Na-\nvarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016). \n  Defendants’ attempt to paper over CMS’s ignoring of key evidence on natural immunity \nalso misses the mark.  They claim that CMS “directly considered” Plaintiffs’ “cited study” out of \nIsrael, but what actually happened is that the IFC cited a CDC webpage, and on that webpage was \na link to another webpage that cited the study.  Opp. at 31–32.  That is hardly the reasoned \nconsideration that the APA demands. \n  Post Hoc/Pretextual Reasoning.  Defendants want to ignore the Biden Administration’s \nprior comments concerning vaccine mandates.  Opp. at 33.  But this Court should not—and indeed \ncannot—ignore the obvious pretextual and post-hoc reasoning.  As Plaintiffs have explained, the \nAdministration originally affirmed that mandating vaccines is “not the role of the federal govern-\nment.”  Doc. 9, at 4.  The President then announced that the CMS vaccine mandate is part of a \nbroader program aimed at increasing vaccination rates.  Id.  And CMS now seeks to justify the \nmandate as necessary to protect patient health. \n“In reviewing agency pronouncements, courts need not turn a blind eye to the statements \nof those issuing such pronouncements.”  BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. Occupational Safety & Health \nAdmin., United States Dep’t of Lab., --- F.4th --- , No. 21-60845, 2021 WL 5279381, at *5 (5th \nCir. Nov. 12, 2021) (citing FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)).  “In \nfact, courts have an affirmative duty not to do so.”  Id.  CMS thus cannot ignore the Administra-\ntion’s original announcement and the President’s later-stated rationale, preferring instead to \n8 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 14 of 28 PageID #: 435\ncontrive a new justification under the Social Security Act.  Such blatant pretext renders CMS’s \nmandate arbitrary and capricious.  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575–76 (2019); \nsee also BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *5 (identifying pretext as a “hallmark[] of unlawful \nagency actions”).  Indeed, these kinds of “sudden[] revers[als]” of course “create[] the plausible \ninference that political pressure may have caused the agency to take action it was not otherwise \nplanning to take.”  Connecticut v. Dep’t of Interior, 363 F. Supp. 3d 45, 64–65 (D.D.C. 2019). \nWhat’s more, the Administration’s shifting rationales across all vaccine mandates further \ndemonstrate pretext.  The OSHA mandate declares that vaccines are necessary to protect worker \nsafety.  See 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402 (Nov. 5, 2021).  But that rationale would not suffice under the \nSocial Security Act, so CMS contrived a new justification—patient safety—for its mandate.  \nAccepting these conflicting agency justifications would require this Court to “exhibit a naiveté \nfrom which ordinary citizens are free.”  New York, 139 S. Ct. at 2575. \nFor all these reasons and those explained in Plaintiffs’ initial memorandum, the CMS man-\ndate is arbitrary and capricious. \nC.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate Violates Notice-and-Comment Requirements.  \n \n  Defendants argue that good cause excuses notice-and-comment requirements because a \ndelay would harm the health and safety of patients.  Opp. at 35–36.  This argument is unpersuasive \nbecause CMS’s good-cause analysis did not even consider the mandate’s harm to patients from \nexacerbating  the  healthcare  workforce  shortage  and,  as  explained  above,  CMS  elsewhere \nunreasonably dismissed that concern.  Given these failures, Defendants cannot satisfy the close \nexamination that good-cause analysis requires.  See Council of the S. Mountains, Inc. v. Donovan, \n653 F.2d 573, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“[C]ircumstances justifying reliance on this exception are \n9 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 15 of 28 PageID #: 436\n‘indeed rare’ and will be accepted only after the court has ‘examine[d] closely proffered rationales \njustifying the elimination of public procedures.’”) (citation omitted).   \n  Defendants’ initial good-cause arguments focus on the health risks from COVID-19.  Opp. \nat 36–37.  But after almost two years, COVID-19 is a persistent feature of life and cannot itself \nconstitute good cause.  See Florida v. Becerra, 8:21-cv-839, 2021 WL 2514138, at *45 (M.D. Fla. \nJune 18, 2021); Regeneron Pharms., Inc. v. HHS, 510 F. Supp. 3d 29, 48 (S.D.N.Y. 2020); Ass’n \nof Cmty. Cancer Centers v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 496 (D. Md. 2020).  To hold otherwise \nwould effectively repeal notice-and-comment requirements indefinitely.  See also BST Holdings, \n2021 WL 5279381, at *3 & n.10 (OSHA vaccine mandate’s “stated impetus—a purported ‘emer-\ngency’ that the entire globe has now endured for nearly two years . . . —is unavailing” because \n“society’s interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19 cannot qualify as compelling forever”) \n(cleaned up). \n  Professing good cause in an interim final rule published six months ago, CMS invoked \nmany of the same reasons it offers now—the existence of a public health emergency, the need to \nprotect vulnerable patient populations, and strain on the healthcare industry.  See 86 Fed. Reg. \n26,306, 26,320–21.  But if the same conditions were present nearly six months ago, it strains cre-\ndulity to assert them as an emergency justification now.  See Chamber of Commerce v. SEC, 443 \nF.3d 890, 908 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“The [good-cause] exception excuses notice and comment in \nemergency situations.”) (emphasis added). \n  In their brief, Defendants next discuss recent events involving the Delta variant and specu-\nlation about “a renewed surge” of COVID-19 and “the coming flu season.”  Opp. at 37–39.  But \nDefendants admit that “the ‘intensity’ of the coming flu season ‘cannot be predicted.’”  Id. at 39 \n(citing 86 Fed. Reg. 61,584).  And the cited CDC website agrees that the “impact . . . of flu varies \n10 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 16 of 28 PageID #: 437\nfrom season to season.”  CDC, Flu Season, https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm.  \nIf such speculative divinations about surges and seasons suffice to establish good cause, CMS \ncould easily conjure up some theory to justify eliminating notice and comment in countless circum-\nstances.  But that is inconsistent with the admonition that the good-cause exception be “reluctantly \ncountenanced.”  Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 F.2d 1309, 1321 (8th Cir. 1981).3    \n  Finally, the “more expansive the regulatory reach of” a rule, “the greater the necessity for \npublic comment” to allow those affected to be heard.  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emp. v. Block, 655 F.2d \n1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1981).  There is no overlooking the magnitude of this rule, for CMS has \n“not previously required” mandatory vaccination for the healthcare industry. 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,567.  And notice and comment process is even more vital in the Medicare and Medicaid context \nbecause those programs “touch[] the lives of nearly all Americans” and are two of the “largest \nfederal program[s]” in the country.  Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1808 (2019).  \nEven “minor changes” to the way those programs are administered “can impact millions of people \nand billions of dollars in ways that are not always easy for regulators to anticipate.” Id. at 1816.  \nGiven this, good cause should be especially difficult to establish here.4 \nIn sum, Defendants claim that this is an unparalleled “public health crisis.”  Opp. at 1.  But \nit is equally true that this is an unparalleled mandate.  Thus, notice and comment was required.  \n                                                 \n3 Defendants’ reliance on United States v. Gavrilovic, 551 F.2d 1099, 1105 (8th Cir. 1977), \nsee Opp. at 37, is unavailing because the Eighth Circuit there held that the agency’s “finding of \ngood cause was not based on an acute and immediate threat to public health and safety” and thus \nthat the effective date could not be accelerated. (emphasis added). \n \n4 Case law refutes Defendants’ argument (at 40) that CMS’s two-month delay in promul-\ngating its mandate shows that it “acted with appropriate dispatch.  See Regeneron, 510 F. Supp. \n3d at 48 (CMS’s two-month delay “suggest[ed] a lack of urgency” that belied good cause).  \nMoreover, Defendants themselves have previously suggested that a one-week delay is not acting \nfast enough.  See ECF 15 at 3. \n11 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 17 of 28 PageID #: 438\nAnd because notice-and-comment was required, a regulatory impact analysis was also required \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1302(b)(1), which Defendants concede (at 41) the Secretary did not do. \nD.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate Violates the State-Consultation Requirement.  \n \n  Defendants implausibly read a good-cause exception into 42 U.S.C. § 1395z’s state-\nconsultation requirement.  Opp. at 40.  The relevant statutory language says that “the Secretary \nshall consult with appropriate State agencies” and that he “may consult with appropriate local \nagencies.”  42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  Defendants argue that the word “appropriate” conveys “vast \ndiscretion” on CMS to skip state consultation before issuing an interim final rule.  Opp. at 40.  \nThis, however, misunderstands the meaning of “appropriate” in this statute.  The word merely \nexpresses that certain state agencies—those connected with Medicare and Medicaid—are the \nappropriate agencies with which CMS must consult.  It does not invite CMS to decide for itself \nwhether consultation is “appropriate” in the first place.  If consultation with state agencies were \noptional, or at CMS’s discretion, Congress would not have used “shall” to describe consultation \nwith state agencies and “may” to describe consultation with local agencies. See Jennings v. \nRodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 844 (2018) (“Unlike the word ‘may,’ which implies discretion, the word \n‘shall’ usually connotes a requirement.”).  CMS thus violated its state-consultation obligation. \nE.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate is Unconstitutional. \nBecause Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their statutory arguments, the Court need not \nreach these constitutional issues.  BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *3.  But if the Court does \nreach them, it should conclude that Plaintiffs’ are likely to prevail on their constitutional claims.   \nDefendants concede (at 41) that public health matters are within the province of the States.  \nBut  choosing  “how”  to  fund  Medicare,  Defendants  argue,  is  not.    That  gives  away  the \nGovernment’s case.  Their justification for the CMS vaccine mandate is to promote patients’ health \n12 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 18 of 28 PageID #: 439\nand safety.  But it is indisputably the States’ exclusive role to promote the health and safety of \ntheir citizenry (including Medicare and Medicaid recipients).  See Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 \nU.S. 11, 24–25 (1905).  The States are not challenging the Government’s funding determinations \nover its own programs; rather, the States are challenging the Government’s exercise of power not \nreserved to it.  Indeed, for the reasons stated in Part II.A., supra, the CMS vaccine mandate is not \na valid exercise of the agency’s statutory authority.  Thus, Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their Tenth Amendment challenge. \nDefendants argue (at 42) that they aren’t commandeering anyone because “conditions on \nfederal spending . . . are imposed on public or private entities that choose to participate in the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, not on States in their capacity as States.”  That not only elevates \nform over substance, but also ignores the States’ “stake in protecting [their] quasi-sovereign \ninterests[.]”  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520.  Moreover, Defendants seek to downplay (at 43–44) \nthe commandeering that occurs when CMS charges state surveyors with enforcing the vaccine \nmandate.  They argue that no commandeering occurs because the States voluntarily agreed to \noperate as surveyors.  But the state surveyors never agreed to enforce a vaccination mandate.  \nBecause “[p]revious Medicaid [regulations] simply do not fall into the same category as the one \nat stake here,” NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 585 (2012), any prior agreement by state surveyors \ndoes not encompass this demand. \nDefendants further argue (at 42) that the CMS vaccine mandate “bear[s] some relationship” \nto federal spending on Medicaid and Medicare.  But the relationship is so tenuous that this goes \nbeyond NFIB, where the Supreme Court found a Spending Clause violation.  567 U.S. at 584.  In \nNFIB, at least Medicaid expansion had something to do with the States’ participation in the \ntraditional Medicaid program.  The CMS vaccine mandate simply does not.  Defendants’ argument \n13 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 19 of 28 PageID #: 440\nalso assumes that the Secretary has a “statutory duty to protect the health and safety” of Medicare \nand Medicaid recipients, which he does not.  See Part II.A., supra.  Because he didn’t have that \nstatutory authority, the mandate comes out of left field, with no clear notice to the States. \nAll these constitutional problems, moreover, provide additional compelling reasons to \nreject CMS’s claim that the statutes authorize this unprecedented mandate.  See, e.g., Alabama \nAss’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2490 (2021) (per curiam) \n(clear-statement rule for major questions and agency actions that disrupt the federal-state balance \nof authority); Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, \n172–73 (2001) (“Congress does not casually authorize administrative agencies to interpret a statute \nto push the limit of congressional authority.”); Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast \nBuilding  &  Constr.  Trades  Council,  485  U.S.  568,  575  (1988)  (doctrine  of  constitutional \navoidance). \nIII.  The Remaining Injunction Factors Favor the Plaintiffs.  \nA.  The Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Harm. \n \n  Sovereign Interests.  Relying on out-of-circuit case law, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs \ndo not have a cognizable Article III interest in the preemption of their laws.  Opp. at 45.  But just \nlast year, the Eighth Circuit held that “State[s] . . . suffer irreparable harm” when they are \n“precluded from applying [their] duly enacted legislation.”  Org. for Black Struggle v. Ashcroft, \n978 F.3d 603, 609 (8th Cir. 2020).  And Defendants do not deny that Plaintiffs have many laws \nthat CMS’s mandate purports to preempt.  See Doc. 9, at 38.  This establishes irreparable harm and \ndistinguishes the Florida case because, according to the court’s order, the State there “reference[d] \nno law or established policy in danger of preemption.”  Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., \nNo. 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC, Order at 10 (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021).   \n14 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 20 of 28 PageID #: 441\n  Quasi-Sovereign Interests.  Invoking case law from the 1980s, Defendants argue that Plain-\ntiffs cannot assert their quasi-sovereign interests against the federal government.  Opp. at 45.  This \nignores the Supreme Court’s 2007 landmark decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 519–\n20 & n.17.  The Court there held that Massachusetts had standing to assert quasi-sovereign interests \nagainst the federal government.  Given Massachusetts’s “procedural right” to “challenge the rejec-\ntion of [a] rulemaking petition as arbitrary and capricious” and its “stake in protecting its quasi-\nsovereign interests, the Commonwealth [was] entitled to special solicitude in . . . standing \nanalysis.”  Id. at 520.  This special solicitude afforded Massachusetts the right “to litigate as parens \npatriae to protect quasi-sovereign interests—i.e., public or governmental interests that concern the \nstate as a whole.”  Id. at 520 n.17.  Indeed, the Court rejected the suggestion that its cases cast \n“doubt on a State’s standing to assert a quasi-sovereign interest . . . against the Federal Govern-\nment.”  Id.  Massachusetts thus establishes that Plaintiffs may assert their quasi-sovereign interest \nin ensuring, among other things, that widespread healthcare calamity does not befall their citizens.  \n  Proprietary Interests.  Plaintiffs also face irreparable harm as operators of healthcare faci-\nlities covered by the mandate.  Defendants reduce these harms to mere economic harm.  Opp. at \n45.  But this ignores the interests that Plaintiffs have asserted, which include, but are not limited \nto, “impos[ing] the CMS mandate on their own employees” and “disruptions in day-to-day opera-\ntions” caring for patients. Doc. 9, at 40.  This shows that the harm at stake is far more than money.  \nIndeed, Plaintiffs’ proprietary interests are like those of the businesses in the OSHA mandate case, \nwhich faced the “irreparabl[e] harm[]” of “the business and financial effects of a lost or suspended \nemployee, compliance and monitoring costs associated with the Mandate, [and] the diversion of \nresources necessitated by the Mandate.”  BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *8.  To the extent \nthat some of these harms are economic, they are nonetheless irreparable.  See id.  As Defendants’ \n15 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 21 of 28 PageID #: 442\nown case law recognizes, “[t]he threat of unrecoverable economic loss does qualify as irreparable \nharm.”  Iowa Utilities Bd. v. FCC, 109 F.3d 418, 426 (8th Cir. 1996).  Such unrecoverable losses \ninclude reduced tax revenues and money spent addressing the loss of state healthcare workers. \nLikelihood of Harms.  Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs’ irreparable harms must be \n“certain.”  Opp. at 45–47.  Even if that were the standard (which it’s not), Plaintiffs would readily \nsatisfy it.  The sovereign harms involving preemption of Plaintiffs’ laws are certain to occur.  So \nare Plaintiffs’ quasi-sovereign and proprietary harms of involuntarily forcing healthcare workers, \nincluding their own employees, to choose between their jobs and their private medical choices \nabout vaccination. \nIn any event, Defendants are wrong to insist on a certainty standard because the Supreme \nCourt’s “frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate \nthat irreparable injury is likely”—not certain—to occur.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008); see also New York, 139 S. Ct. at 2566 (allowing plaintiffs in an APA \nchallenge to demonstrate harm by “showing that third parties will likely react in predictable \nways”).  Plaintiffs have shown that the irreparable harm relating to the mandate’s catastrophic \neffects on the healthcare industry easily clear the likelihood standard.  Plaintiffs’ 30 declarations \nidentify dozens of private and state-run facilities that, based on the information currently available \nto them, reasonably anticipate significant staff loses that will substantially disrupt—and in some \ncases even end—their operations.  See Docs. 9-1–9-30.  Despite what Defendants say (at 46), many \nof  those  declarations—from  both  private  and  state-run  facilities—expressly  consider  the \navailability of exemptions.  See, e.g., Doc. 9-2, ¶ 9; Doc. 9-4, ¶ 8; Doc. 9-13, ¶ 13; Doc. 9-15, ¶ \n14; Doc. 9-24, ¶ 14.  In addition, the undisputed evidence shows that the CMS mandate has already \ncompelled some healthcare works to resign.  See, e.g., Doc. 9-26, ¶ 8.  Moreover, in six days, the \n16 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 22 of 28 PageID #: 443\nemergency amendment to Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 19, § 30-82.010 will become effective, thus \nallowing healthcare facilities to close due to staffing shortages. \nAmicus curiae Reliant Care Management Company—an operator of 21 skilled nursing \nfacilities throughout Missouri, mostly in rural communities—further substantiates the irreparable \nharm.  Doc. 26, at 1.  Out of Reliant’s 1,706 employees, 1,080 are not vaccinated.  Id. at 3.  Thus, \n“CMS’s mandate places approximately 60% of Reliant’s workforce in jeopardy, which will \ninevitably lead to facility closures in communities that simply cannot afford it.”  Id.  “These daunt-\ning statistics, and the risks they pose to the continuity of healthcare in vulnerable communities, \nexemplify the situation playing out across Missouri right now and further justify the requested \ninjunction.”  Id. \nIt’s not just Plaintiffs and their amicus that establish the likelihood of irreparable harm.  \nCMS’s own materials help Plaintiffs make their case.  As previously discussed, those materials \nindicate that 52,000 healthcare workers statewide did not comply with New York’s vaccine \nmandate and that a Buffalo nursing home was forced to reduce services after placing 20% of its \nstaff “on unpaid leave . . . for refusing to get vaccinated.”  Thousands of N.Y. Health Care Workers \nGet Vaccinated Ahead of Deadline, N.Y. Times (Sept. 28, 2021).  If that weren’t enough, a Long \nIsland hospital just yesterday closed its “emergency department . . . due to nursing staff shortages \nas a result of New York’s vaccine mandate.”  Supra n.2.  There is thus more than enough evidence \nto establish the likelihood that CMS’s mandate will devastate the nation’s healthcare industry, \nespecially in rural communities.  \nThe robust record before this Court further distinguishes this case from the Florida decision \non which Defendants rely.  The court there found the asserted harms too “speculative.”  Florida \nOrder at 8–10.  But as detailed above, Plaintiff States’ harms are anything but speculative.  In \n17 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 23 of 28 PageID #: 444\naddition, the Florida court failed to cite (let alone apply) the special solicitude States are given \nunder Massachusetts.  See Texas v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 548 (5th Cir. 2021) (per curiam) (citing \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 523, for the proposition that the Supreme Court found “traceability \nwhere the EPA’s challenged action may have caused people to drive less fuel-efficient cars, which \nmay in turn contribute to a prospective rise in sea levels, which may in turn cause the erosion of \nMassachusetts’s shoreline”). \nB.  The Balance of Harms and The Public Interest Favor an Injunction. \n \n  Enjoining CMS’s mandate is in the public interest.  “From economic uncertainty to \nworkplace strife, the mere specter of the Mandate has contributed to untold economic upheaval in \nrecent months.”  BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *8.  “The public interest is also served by \nmaintaining our constitutional structure and . . . the liberty of individuals to make intensely \npersonal decisions according to their own convictions.”  Id.  And “[t]here is clearly a robust public \ninterest in safeguarding prompt access to health care.” Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. DHS, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d 1, 61 (D.D.C. 2020).  While Defendants argue (at 3) that injunctive relief would harm \nthe public’s interest in “protecting the health of Medicare and Medicaid patients,” that argument \nactually cuts in favor of Plaintiff States: the 30 declarations submitted—none of which Defendants \nhave disputed—assert concrete harms that will result in less access to healthcare services due to \nthe CMS vaccine mandate.  For this reason, Plaintiff States strongly disagree with Defendants’ \nclaim (at 22) that “a rule requiring the vaccination of health care facility employees protects the \n‘health and safety’ of those facilities’ patients[.]”   \n  Defendants’ public-interest arguments rest in large part on the assumption that the mandate \nwill “slow[] the spread of COVID-19” by limiting transmission from unvaccinated healthcare \nworkers to patients.  Opp. at 48.  Yet CMS itself undermines this assumption by recognizing that \n18 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 24 of 28 PageID #: 445\n“the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease transmission by those vaccinated [is] not curr-\nently known.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,615.  CMS thus weakens Defendants’ public-interest argument. \n  In any event, there is no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.  As \nthe Supreme Court said in Alabama Ass’n of Realtors, “[i]t is indisputable that the public has a \nstrong interest in combating the spread of the COVID–19[;]” however, “our system does not permit \nagencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends.”  141 S. Ct. at 2490. \nIV.  The Injunction Should Bar Defendants from Enforcing the Rule Anywhere.  \n  Defendants seek to limit the scope of Plaintiffs’ requested injunction.  Opp. at 50–52.  But \nthe Court should not confine its reach.  Because Defendants acted without statutory authority, \nviolated multiple procedural requirements and engaged in arbitrary and capricious decision-\nmaking, no aspect of the IFC can stand, and it should be enjoined in its entirety.  The APA provides \nthat unlawful agency actions shall be vacated and “set aside” in their entirety, not in geographic \npiecemeal.  See BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *9 (ordering OSHA to “take no steps to \nimplement  or  enforce  the  Mandate  until  further  court  order,”  thus  effectively  enjoining  it \nnationwide). \n  In addition, affording full relief to Plaintiffs necessitates a nationwide injunction.  Plaintiffs \nhave explained how the healthcare industry is interconnected. See Doc. 9, at 41.  Thus, allowing \nthe mandate to take effect in Illinois, for example, will limit the healthcare services available in \nthat State, and that, in turn, will further burden healthcare providers in Eastern Missouri as patients \nin Western Illinois cross the border to get the services they seek.  Plaintiffs thus have a direct \ninterest in this Court’s issuing a broad injunction.  At the very least, the injunction should apply to \nthe First, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits—where Plaintiff States reside. \n19 \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  27   Filed: 11/23/21   Page: 25 of 28 PageID #: 446\nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.

INTRODUCTION \nThis case concerns the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (“CMS”) federal \nvaccine mandate on a wide range of healthcare facilities.  On November 5, 2021, CMS issued an \nInterim Final Rule with Comment Period (“IFC”) entitled “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; \nOmnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination” (the “mandate”), 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 (Nov. \n5, 2021), revising the “requirements that most Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and \nsuppliers must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.”  86 Fed. Reg. 61,555–\n601.  Specifically,  the  mandate  requires  nearly  every  employee,  volunteer,  and  third-party \ncontractor working1 at fifteen2 categories of healthcare facilities to be vaccinated against SARS-\n \n1 The mandate applies to a wide-range of people working at the facilities, including, employees, trainees, students, \nvolunteers, or contractors, who provide any care, treatment, or other services for the facility.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,570 \n(emphasis added).   \n \n2 The CMS vaccine mandate covers fifteen categories of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers: \n(1) Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs); (2) Hospices; (3) Psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs); (4) \nPrograms of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE); (5) Hospitals (acute care hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, long \nterm care hospitals, children’s hospitals, hospital swing beds, transplant centers, cancer hospitals, and rehabilitation \nhospitals); (6) Long Term Care (LTC) Facilities, generally referred to as nursing homes; (7) Intermediate Care \nFacilities  for  Individuals  with  Intellectual  Disabilities  (ICFs-IID);  (8)  Home  Health  Agencies  (HHAs);  (9) \nComprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (CORFs); (10) Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs); (11) Clinics, \n1 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 2 of 32 PageID #: 451\nCoV-2 (“COVID”) and to have received at least a first dose of the vaccine prior to December 6, \n2021.  See id. at 61,573.  On November 10, 2021, Plaintiffs, the States of Missouri, Nebraska, \nArkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Wyoming, Alaska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and New Hampshire \n(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint challenging the mandate.  Doc. [1].  The Complaint \nseeks preliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief.  On November 12, 2021, \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, Doc. [6], requesting that this Court issue a \npreliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from imposing the mandate.    \nHaving fully reviewed the administrative record and submitted material, the Court finds \nthat a preliminary injunction is warranted here.     \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  The Court has jurisdiction.  \nDefendants  argue that this Court “lacks jurisdiction” over Plaintiffs’ claims because \n“Congress has withdrawn federal-question jurisdiction over claims like this one that arise under \nthe Medicare statute,” citing 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), as incorporated by 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii.  Doc. [23] \nat 15–19.  The Court does not agree.  As Defendants readily concede, “State governments” such \nas  the  Plaintiff  States  are  neither  “institution[s]”  nor  “agenc[ies]”  “dissatisfied”  with  the \nSecretary’s  determination  regarding  eligibility  or  receipt  of  benefits  under  42  U.S.C. \n§ 1395cc(h)(1) and, therefore, “the States3 themselves could not use that statute’s vehicle for \njudicial review.”  Id. at 19; see Shalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 16 \n(2000) (explaining that § 405(h) does not apply if application “would mean no review at all”).  In \n \nrehabilitation agencies, and public health agencies as providers of outpatient physical therapy and speech-language \npathology services; (12) Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs); (13) Home Infusion Therapy (HIT) suppliers; \n(14) Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)/Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs); and (15) End-Stage Renal Disease \n(ESRD) Facilities.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569–70. \n \n3 The Plaintiff States bring their claims in a number of capacities: sovereign, quasi-sovereign/parens patriae, and \nproprietary.  See, e.g., Doc. [1] ¶¶ 5, 7, 9.   \n2 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 3 of 32 PageID #: 452\naddition, Plaintiffs’ claims that arise under the Medicaid Act—as opposed to the Medicare Act—\nare not subject to the § 405(h)’s jurisdictional bar.  See Avon Nursing & Rehab. v. Becerra, 995 \nF.3d 305, 311 (2d Cir. 2021) (“Unlike the Medicare Act, the Medicaid Act does not incorporate \nthe Social Security Act’s claim-channeling and jurisdiction-stripping provisions, 42 U.S.C. § \n405(g) and (h). Federal courts thus have jurisdiction over claims arising under the Medicaid Act \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331.”).  Thus, all aspects of the mandate that purport to change a Medicaid \nregulation are clearly not barred, even under Defendants’ arguments.  Nonetheless, the Court finds \nthat it has jurisdiction over claims arising under both Medicare and Medicaid.  \nB.  A preliminary injunction is warranted here.  \nPlaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction of the mandate’s enforcement pending a full \njudicial review of the mandate’s legality.  The Court addresses their request today.  Whether a \ncourt should issue a preliminary injunction involves consideration of (1) the threat of irreparable \nharm to the movant; (2) the state of the balance between this harm and the injury that granting the \ninjunction will inflict on other parties litigant; (3) the probability that movant will succeed on the \nmerits; and (4) the public interest.  Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 113 (8th \nCir. 1981).  “While no single factor is determinative, the probability of success factor is the most \nsignificant.”  Home Instead, Inc. v. Florance, 721 F.3d 494, 497 (8th Cir. 2013) (internal \nquotations and citations omitted). \nEach of these factors favors a preliminary injunction here.   \na.  Plaintiffs demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits. \ni.  Congress did not grant CMS authority to mandate the vaccine. \n \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that Congress has not provided CMS the \nauthority to enact the regulation at issue here.   “[A]n agency literally has no power to act, let alone \n3 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 4 of 32 PageID #: 453\npre-empt4 the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State, unless and until Congress confers \npower upon it.”  La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 357 (1986).  While the Court agrees \nCongress has authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”) general \nauthority to enact regulations for the “administration” of Medicare and Medicaid and the “health \nand safety” of recipients, the nature and breadth of the CMS mandate requires clear authorization \nfrom Congress—and Congressed has provided none.5  See Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health \n& Hum. Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2486 (2021) (“It would be one thing if Congress had specifically \nauthorized the action that the CDC has taken.  But that has not happened.”).  Courts have long \nrequired Congress to speak clearly when providing agency authorization if it (1) intends for an \nagency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance; (2) if the authority would \nsignificantly alter the balance between federal  and state power; or (3) if an administrative \ninterpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress’ power.  Any one of those \nfundamental principles would require clear congressional authorization for this mandate, but here, \nall three are present.  Even in exigency, the Secretary cannot “bring about an enormous and \n \n4 CMS intends for the mandate to preempt any arguably inconsistent state and local laws regarding vaccination.  See, \ne.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,568 (“We intend . . . that this nationwide regulation preempts inconsistent State and local laws \napplied to Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers.”). \n \n5 The Court notes that Congress has provided the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”) authority \nto enact regulations “necessary to the efficient administration” of the Social Security Act and regulations “necessary \nto carry out the administration of” of Medicare.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1302(a), 1395hh(a)(1).  Among the regulations the \nSecretary may promulgate under its power of “administration” is the setting of things like “standards,” “criteria,” or \n“requirements” for specific facilities.   See, e.g., Id. at § 1396d(h)(1)(B)(i) (governing Psychiatric Residential \nTreatment Facilities (“PRTFs”) and mentioning “standards as may be prescribed in regulations by the Secretary”); Id. \nat § 1395i–4(e) (governing Critical Access Hospitals (“CAHs”) and mentioning “criteria as the Secretary may \nrequire”);  Id.  at  § 1395rr(b)(1)(A)  (governing  End-Stage  Renal  Disease  (“ESRD”)  facilities  and  mentioning \n“requirements as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe”).  For some facilities, Congress has authorized the \nSecretary to set rules or conditions necessary to, or that will ensure, the “health and safety” of recipients of services. \nSee, e.g., Id. at § 1395i–3(d)(4)(B) (addressing LTC facilities and mentioning “requirements relating to the health, \nsafety, and well-being of residents . . . as the Secretary may find necessary”); Id. at § 1395x(e)(9) (addressing hospitals \nand mentioning “requirements as the Secretary finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals \nwho are furnished services”).  However, the Court need not decide whether those regulations are properly interpreted \nby CMS to confer it authority to issue the vaccine mandate that it has.  Instead, and irrespective of that determination, \nthe Court’s inquiry focuses on whether Congress specifically authorized such action, for reasons discussed above.  \n4 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 5 of 32 PageID #: 454\ntransformative expansion in [his] regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.”  \nSee Util. Air Reg. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014).    \n1.  Given the vast economic and political significance of this \nvaccine mandate, only a clear authorization from Congress \nwould empower CMS to act.  \n \nFirst, Congress must “speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise powers of ‘vast \neconomic and political significance.’”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489 (quoting Util. Air \nReg., 573 U.S. at 324).  The mandate’s economic cost is overwhelming.  CMS estimates that \ncompliance with the Mandate—just in the first year—is around 1.38 billion dollars.  86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,613.  Those costs, though, do not take into account the economic significance this mandate \nhas from the effects on facilities closing or limiting services and a significant exodus of employees \nthat choose not to receive a vaccination.6  Likewise, the political significance of a mandatory \ncoronavirus vaccine is hard to understate, especially when forced by the heavy hand of the federal \ngovernment.  Indeed, it would be difficult to identify many other issues that currently have more \npolitical significance at this time.  Had Congress wished to assign this question fraught with deep \neconomic and political significance to CMS, “it surely would have done so expressly.”  See King \nv. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015).  “It is especially unlikely that Congress would have delegated \nthis decision to [CMS], which has no expertise in crafting” vaccine mandates. Id.   \n2.  Because  this  mandate  significantly  alters  the  balance \nbetween federal and state power, only a clear authorization \nfrom Congress would empower CMS. \n \nSecond, Congress must use “exceedingly clear language if it wishes to significantly alter \nthe balance between federal and state power.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489 (quoting \n \n6 Medicare and Medicaid programs “touch[] the lives of nearly all Americans” and are two of the “largest federal \nprogram[s]” in the country.  Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1808 (2019).  Even “minor changes” to the \nway those programs are administered “can impact millions of people and billions of dollars in ways that are not always \neasy for regulators to anticipate.”  Id. at 1816.  \n5 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 6 of 32 PageID #: 455\nUnited States Forest Service v. Cowpasture River Preservation Assn., 140 S. Ct. 1837, 1850 \n(2020)); see also United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971).  The regulation at issue alters \nthat balance because it requires vaccination, which CMS has never attempted to do, for millions \nof individuals who would otherwise be outside the reach of the federal government.  This concern \nis “heightened” since CMS’s “administrative interpretation alters the federal-state framework by \npermitting federal encroachment upon a traditional state power.”  Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook \nCty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U.S. 159, 173 (2001).  It has long been the states’ power \nto legislate health—including vaccination.  Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, 203 (1824) (noting \n“health laws of every description” belong to the states); BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. Occupational \nSafety & Health Admin., 17 F.4th 604, ---, 2021 WL 5279381, at *7 (5th Cir. 2021) (citing Zucht \nv. King, 260 U.S. 174, 176 (1922) (noting that precedent had long “settled that it is within the \npolice power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination”)).  Sometimes “the most telling \nindication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent” for an \nagency’s action.  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 549 (2012).  With such a \nhistory of exclusive state power, the Court is far from certain that Congress intended the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services to require mandatory vaccinations for millions of Americans.  \nSee Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 858 (2014) (noting “it is incumbent upon the federal \ncourts to be certain of Congress’ intent before finding that federal law overrides the usual \nconstitutional balance of federal and state powers” (internal quotations omitted)).   \nTruly, the impact of this mandate reaches far beyond COVID.7  CMS seeks to overtake an \narea of traditional state authority by imposing an unprecedented demand to federally dictate the \n \n7 Of course, this situation is novel and messy in that COVID has created a “unique pandemic scenario,” 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,568, but equally problematic is that it remains unclear that COVID-19—however tragic and devastating the \npandemic has been—poses the kind of grave danger that justifies the federal government trampling on sovereign state \n6 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 7 of 32 PageID #: 456\nprivate medical decisions of millions of Americans.  Such action challenges traditional notions of \nfederalism, as discussed above.  “The independent power of the States [] serves as a check on the \npower of the Federal Government: by denying any one government complete jurisdiction over all \nthe concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.” \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 536 (quoting Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011)).  This is \nespecially true, since “a healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government \nwill reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.”  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, \n458 (1991). \n3.  In the absence of a clear indication that Congress intended \nfor CMS to invoke such significant authority, the Court \nwill not infer congressional intent. \n \nThird, “[w]here an administrative interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of \nCongress’ power,” Congress must provide “a clear indication that [it] intended that result.”  Solid \nWaste, 531 U.S. at 172.  This “requirement” stems from the “prudential desire not to needlessly \nreach constitutional issues.”8  Id.  And this requirement is “heightened” here since CMS’s claim \n“alters the federal-state framework by permitting federal encroachment upon a traditional state \npower.”  Id.  Whether Congress itself could impose the vaccination requirement is a tough \nquestion, cf. BST Holdings, 17 F.4th at ---, 2021 WL 5279381, at *7 (Duncan, J., concurring), one \nthat CMS would force to its crisis.  But even if Congress has the power to mandate the vaccine \n \nrights.  Regardless, disrupting this balance of power must have been expressly authorized by Congress, and as \ndiscussed, Congress has not.   \n \n8 A court—especially a district court—should be reluctant to opine on an unsettled constitutional issue when the court \ncan resolve a case on an alternative ground.  See Xiong v. Lynch, 836 F.3d 948, 950 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting Lyng v. \nNw. Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 445, 108 (1988)) (“A fundamental and longstanding principle \nof judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding \nthem.”).  And, at the very least, the Court should “pause to consider the implications of the [State’s] arguments” when \nconfronted with such new conceptions of federal power.  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 550 \n(2012) (quoting Lopez,115 S. Ct. at 1624).   \n7 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 8 of 32 PageID #: 457\nand the authority to delegate such a mandate to CMS—topics on which the Court does not opine \ntoday—the lack of congressional intent for this monumental policy decision speaks volumes.   \nIn conclusion, even if Congress’s statutory language was susceptible to CMS’s exceedingly \nbroad reading—which it is most likely not—Congress did not clearly authorize CMS to enact the \nthis politically and economically vast, federalism-altering, and boundary-pushing mandate, which \nSupreme Court precedent requires. \nii.  CMS improperly bypassed notice and comment requirements. \n \nEven if CMS has the authority to implement the vaccine mandate—which the Court finds \nis unlikely, as discussed above—the mandate is likely an unlawful promulgation of regulations.  \nBoth the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the Social Security Act ordinarily require \nnotice and a comment period before a rule like this one takes effect.9  5 U.S.C. § 553; 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395hh(b)(1).  Failure to allow notice and comment, where required, is grounds for invalidating \nthe rule.  Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 876 (8th Cir. 2013) (vacating a rule based \non an administrative agency’s failure to abide by the APA’s notice and comment procedure).  The \nnotice  and  comment  requirements  do  not  apply  if  “good  cause”  establishes  that  they  “are \nimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest” under the circumstances.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(B).  The exception is read narrowly and only used in “rare” circumstances.  Nw. Airlines, \nInc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 F.2d 1309, 1321 (8th Cir. 1981) (noting that the good cause exception \nshould be “narrowly construed and only reluctantly countenanced”); Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. \nv. EPA, 683 F.2d 752, 764 (3d Cir. 1982) (noting “circumstances justifying reliance on [the good \ncause] exception are indeed rare and will be accepted only after the court has examined closely \nproffered rationales justifying the elimination of public procedures” (internal quotations omitted)). \n \n9 The parties do not dispute that the notice and comment requirements applied to the mandate.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  \n8 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 9 of 32 PageID #: 458\nCMS concedes it did not follow these requirements but attempts to justify its omission \nunder the “good cause” exception.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  Here, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \nin their argument that CMS unlawfully bypassed the APA’s notice and comment requirements. \n1.  CMS’s  own  delay  undermines  its  “emergency” \njustification  for  bypassing  notice  and  comment \nrequirements.   \n \nUse of the “good cause” exception is “limited to emergency situations” and is “necessarily \nfact-or context-dependent.”  Thrift Depositors of Am., Inc. v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 862 F. \nSupp. 586, 591 (D.D.C. 1994).  Here, CMS’s delay in requiring mandatory vaccination undermines \nits contention that COVID is an emergency such that it has the “good cause” necessary to dispense \nwith notice and comment requirements.  In justifying the good cause exception, CMS stated that \n“[t]he data showing the vital importance of vaccination” indicates that it “cannot delay taking this \naction” to protect peoples’ health and safety.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  Yet, CMS’s good cause \nclaim is undermined by its own delay in promulgating the mandate.  See United States v. Brewer, \n766 F.3d 884, 890 (8th Cir. 2014) (“[C]oncern for public safety further is undermined by [the \nAttorney General’s] own seven-month delay in promulgating the Interim Rule.”); Chamber of \nCom. v. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 504 F. Supp. 3d 1077, 1089 (N.D. Cal. 2020) \n(finding  an  agency’s  six-month  delay  in  promulgating  rules  relating  to  COVID  precluded \npresumption of urgency); Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d \n95, 115 (2nd Cir. 2018) (“Good cause cannot arise as a result of the agency’s own delay, because \notherwise, an agency unwilling to provide notice or an opportunity to comment could simply wait \nuntil the eve of a statutory, judicial, or administrative deadline, then raise up the ‘good cause’ \nbanner  and  promulgate  rules  without  following  APA  procedures.”  (internal  quotations  and \n9 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 10 of 32 PageID #: 459\nalterations omitted)).  The CMS mandate was announced nearly two months10 before the agency \nreleased it, and the mandate itself prominently features yet another one-month delay.  Moreover, \ntwo vaccines were authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”)11 more than ten \nmonths before the CMS mandate took effect, and one vaccine was fully licensed by the FDA well \nover two months before.12  It is also worth mentioning that since the onset of COVID, CMS has \nissued five IFC mandates, such as the one here; the most recent on May 13, 2021.  86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,561.  One could query how an “emergency” could prompt such a slow response; such delay \nhardly suggests a situation so dire that CMS may dispense with notice and comment requirements13 \nand the important purposes they serve.   \nThe COVID pandemic is an event beyond CMS’s control, yet it was completely within its \ncontrol to act earlier than it did.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583 (“CMS initially chose, among other \nactions, to encourage rather than mandate vaccination[.]”); see id. (explaining CMS had authority \nto impose vaccination requirements even when the only vaccines available were those authorized \nunder EUAs in December 2020).  The mere desire or need to have the mandate does not suffice \nfor good cause. Nat’l Ass’n of Farmworkers Orgs. v. Marshall, 628 F.2d 604, 621 (D.C. Cir. 1980) \n(“[G]ood cause to suspend notice and comment must be supported by more than the bare need to \nhave regulations.”); United States v. Cain, 583 F.3d 408, 421 (6th Cir. 2009) (“A desire to provide \n \n10 On September 9, 2021, the President announced his intention to promulgate federal vaccinate mandates, including \nthe CMS vaccine mandate challenged here. \n \n11 The FDA issued vaccines under Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for two COVID vaccines on December \n11, 2020 and December 18, 2020.  According to CMS, the agency could have imposed a vaccine requirement, even \nwhen the only vaccines available are those authorized under EUAs.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  \n \n12 On August 23, 2021, the FDA licensed the first COVID vaccine.   \n \n13 The Court also takes note that CMS reviewed several communications from stakeholders in favor of the mandate.  \nThus, CMS apparently found it quite possible to consult with the interested parties it selected.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,565. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 11 of 32 PageID #: 460\nimmediate guidance, without more, does not suffice for good cause.”).  And good cause is not \nautomatically created based on an agency’s conclusion that bypassing the notice and comment \nrequirements is necessary to protect public safety.14  See Brewer, 766 F.3d at 889 (finding agency’s \nstated reason of “protecting the public safety” was insufficient to waive notice and comment \nrequirement); Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“To accord \ndeference to an agency’s invocation of good cause would be to run afoul of congressional intent.”).  \nCOVID cannot be a compelling justification forever, Does 1-3 v. Mills, --- S. Ct. ---, 2021 WL \n5027177, at *3 (U.S. Oct. 29, 2021) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting), and CMS’s evidence shows COVID \nno longer poses the dire emergency it once did.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583 (noting “newly \nreported COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have begun to trend downward at a national \nlevel”).  Notably, today, there are three widely distributed vaccines.  Additionally, there are several \ntherapeutics and treatments, and as CMS states, more are on the horizon.  See, e.g., id. at 61,609.  \nThus, CMS’s purported “emergency”15—one that the entire globe has now endured for nearly two \nyears, and to which CMS itself demonstrated ease in responding to—is unavailing.  United States \nv. Reynolds, 710 F.3d 498, 512–13 (3rd Cir. 2013) (“Most, if not all, laws passed . . . are designed \nto eliminate some real or perceived harm. If the mere assertion that such harm will continue while \n \n14 Other circuits, like the Eighth, have held that protecting the public, without more, is insufficient to waive procedural \nrequirements.  United States v. Reynolds, 710 F.3d 498, 509 (3rd Cir. 2013); United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, \n928 (5th Cir. 2011); United States v. Valverde, 628 F.3d 1159, 1168 (9th Cir. 2010); United States v. Cain, 583 F.3d \n408, 421–24 (6th Cir. 2009). \n \n15 CMS also asserted that there is an “emergency” now (such that CMS must immediately implement the mandate) \nbecause “the 2021–2022 influenza season” will soon begin.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,584. CMS offered this justification \nwhile simultaneously admitting that “the intensity of the upcoming 2021-2022 influenza season cannot be predicted” \nand that “influenza activity during the 2020-2021 season was low throughout the U.S.”  Id.  For a “risk of future harm” \nto “justify a finding of good cause,” the “risk must be more substantial than a mere possibility.”  Brewer, 766 F.3d at \n890.  Thus, CMS did not find a concrete “threat” to remedy but rather speculated as to a mere possibility of harm, and \nthere is a “difference between addressing present legal uncertainty and addressing the possibility of future legal \nuncertainty.”  Id.  Notably, CMS did not mandate flu vaccines, despite mentioning that the flu has been daunting the \nhealthcare system, that recent studies show approximately half of healthcare workers refuse the flu vaccine, id. at \n61,568, and that CMS has evidence that influenza vaccination of health care staff is directly associated with declines \nin nosocomial influenza in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents.  Id. at 61,557. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 12 of 32 PageID #: 461\nan agency gives notice and receives comments were enough to establish good cause, then notice \nand comment would always have to give way.”). \n2.  CMS failed to meet its “good cause” burden, especially in \nlight  of  the  unprecedented,  controversial,  and  health-\nrelated nature of the mandate.  \n \nCMS also failed to meet its burden based on the unprecedented, controversial, and health-\nrelated nature of the mandate.  Alcaraz v. Block, 746 F.2d 593, 612 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding that \nthe inquiry into an agency invoking “good cause proceeds case-by-case, sensitive to the totality of \nthe factors at play”).  CMS had the burden “to establish that notice and comment need not be \nprovided.”  Nat. Res. Def. Council, 894 F.3d at 113–14.  In a situation like here, where there is \nsignificant and known opposition to the mandate, “good cause” is even more important than usual.  \nSee, e.g., Asbestos Information Ass’n of N. Am. v. Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 727 F.2d \n415, 426 (5th Cir. 1984) (explaining that rules “may be more uncritically accepted after public \nscrutiny, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, especially when the conclusions it suggests are \ncontroversial”).  The fact  that this mandate effects  issues relating  to  health16 increases the \nimportance even further.  See Nat’l Ass’n of Farmworkers, 628 F.2d at 621 (“Especially in the \ncontext of health risks, notice and comment procedures assure the dialogue necessary to the \ncreation of reasonable rules.”); Cmty. Nutrition Inst. v. Butz, 420 F. Supp. 751, 754 (D.D.C. 1976) \n(noting that “when a health-related standard such as this is involved, the good cause exemption \nmay  not  be  used  to  circumvent  the  legal  requirements  designed  to  protect  the  public”).  \nAccordingly, CMS’s argument that undertaking normal notice and comment requirements would \nbe “contrary to the public interest” based on delaying the mandate, id. at 61,586, is unavailing in \nlight of the circumstances.  Alcaraz, 746 F.2d at 612.  Rather, these requirements “serve the public \n \n16 CMS acknowledges that “[s]erious adverse reactions [] have been reported following COVID-19 vaccines.”  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,565. \n12 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 13 of 32 PageID #: 462\ninterest by providing a forum for the robust debate of competing and frequently complicated policy \nconsiderations  having  far-reaching  implications  and,  in  so  doing,  foster  reasoned  decision \nmaking.”  Id.  They are far from “mere formalities.”  Id.   \nMoreover, the failure to take and respond to comments feeds into the very vaccine \nhesitancy CMS acknowledges is so daunting.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,559, 61,568.  Besides fostering \nreasoned decision making, notice and comment “provide a ‘surrogate political process’ that takes \nsome of the sting out of the inherently undemocratic and unaccountable rulemaking process.” \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1929 n.13 (Thomas, J., \ndissenting).  Requiring already hesitant individuals to get the vaccine—without giving them an \nopportunity to be heard—undermines the democratic process that the APA’s procedural safeguards \nare  intended  to  protect  and  exacerbates  the  underlying  hesitancy  problem.    Batterton  v. \nMarshall, 648 F.2d 694, 703 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (according notice and comment great importance \nbecause it “reintroduce[s] public participation and fairness to affected parties after governmental \nauthority has been delegated to unrepresentative agencies”).  Far from being “good cause” for \ncircumventing the normal rulemaking requirements, the unprecedented and controversial mandate \naffecting personal health constitutes a compelling reason to utilize those procedures, and CMS \nfailed to provide the good cause necessary to overcome these factors.  \nIn conclusion, because CMS’s “emergency” does not justify use of the “good cause” \nexception, see Thrift, 862 F. Supp. at 591, and the unprecedented, controversial, and health-related \nmandate requires more good cause than CMS provided, Alcaraz, 746 F.2d at 612, Plaintiffs are \nlikely to succeed in establishing that CMS improperly invoked the 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B) “good \ncause” exception.    \n \n13 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 14 of 32 PageID #: 463\niii. The mandate is arbitrary and capricious.  \nFinally, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in establishing that the CMS vaccine mandate is \narbitrary or capricious.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “arbitrary” or “capricious.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious \nstandard requires that agency action be reasonable and reasonably explained.  Fed. Commc’ns \nComm’n v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021) (“A court simply ensures that \nthe agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered \nthe relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision.”).  Under this “narrow” and deferential \nstandard of review, a court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.  Id.  \nRather, the court must ensure there is a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983). \n1.  The  mandate  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  the \nrecord  is  devoid  of  evidence  regarding  the  covered \nhealthcare facilities. \n \nCMS lacks evidence showing that vaccination status has a direct impact on spreading \nCOVID  in  the  mandate’s  covered  healthcare  facilities.    CMS  acknowledges  its  lack  of \n“comprehensive data” on this matter but attempts to “extrapolate” the abundant data that it does \nhave on Long Term Care Facilities (“LTCs”), generally referred to as nursing homes, to the other \ndozen-plus Medicare and Medicaid facilities covered by the mandate.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,585.  \nHowever,  CMS’s  path  of  analysis  appears  misguided  and  the  inferences  it  produced  are \nquestionable.  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (finding that in an arbitrary and capricious challenge, \nthe court will “uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be \ndiscerned”).  As CMS’s own record shows, COVID disproportionally devastates LTC facilities.  \n14 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 15 of 32 PageID #: 464\nResidents of LTC facilities—who make up less than 1-percent of the U.S. population—accounted \nfor more than 35-percent of all COVID deaths during the first twelve months of the pandemic.  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,566.  Equally staggering is that “[o]f the approximately 656,000 Americans \nestimated to have died from COVID through September 10, 2021, 30-percent are estimated to have \ndied during or after an LTC facility stay.”  Id. at 61,601.  Thus, CMS’s decision to extrapolate \nLTC data to justify its lack of data regarding the other fourteen facilities covered is likely not \nreasonable.  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015) (requiring agencies to engage in “reasoned \ndecision making”); Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 220 (2016) (“[A]n agency \nmust give adequate reasons for its decisions.”).  While a wide-sweeping mandate might make sense \nin the context of LTCs, based on CMS’s evidence, CMS presents no similar evidence for imposing \na broad-sweeping mandate on the other fourteen covered facilities.  Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, \n143 (1973) (“If [a] finding is not sustainable on the administrative record made, then the [agency’s] \ndecision must be vacated[.]”).  Although the Court appreciates its deferential review, the Court’s \nduty is not to “rubber-stamp” administrative decisions devoid of reasonableness.  Alaska Oil and \nGas Ass’n v. Jewell, 815 F.3d 544 (9th Cir. 2016) (“A court must not substitute its judgment for \nthat of the agency, but also must not “rubber-stamp” administrative decisions.”).  \nIn general, the overwhelming lack of evidence likely shows CMS had insufficient evidence \nto mandate vaccination on the wide range of facilities that it did.  Looking even beyond the \nevidence  deficiencies  relating  to  the  specific  facilities  covered,  the  lack  of  data  regarding \nvaccination status and transmissibility—in general—is concerning.  Indeed, CMS states that “the \neffectiveness of the vaccine[s] to prevent disease transmission by those vaccinated [is] not \n15 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 16 of 32 PageID #: 465\ncurrently known.”17  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,615.18  CMS also admits that the continued efficacy of the \nvaccine is uncertain.  See, e.g., id. at 61,612 (“[M]ajor uncertainties remain as to the future course \nof the pandemic, including but not limited to vaccine effectiveness in preventing ‘breakthrough’ \ndisease transmission from those vaccinated, [and] the long-term effectiveness of vaccination[.]”).  \nNo one questions that protecting patients and healthcare workers from contracting COVID is a \nlaudable objective.  But the Court cannot, in good faith, allow CMS to enact an unprecedented \nmandate that lacks a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  State \nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43; see also Sierra Club v. Mainella, 459 F. Supp. 2d 76, 90 (D.D.C. 2006) \n(“Under the APA . . . the function of the district court is to determine whether or not as a matter \nof law the evidence in the administrative record permitted the agency to make the decision it did.”).  \nThe reasoned explanation and evidentiary requirement “of administrative law, after all, is meant \nto ensure that agencies offer genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be \nscrutinized by courts and the interested public.”  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575 \n(2019).  If judicial review is to be more than an “empty ritual,” the Court here must demand \nsomething more than the explanation offered for the action taken by CMS here. Id. \n2.  The mandate is arbitrary and capricious because CMS \nimproperly rejected alternatives to the mandate. \n \nCMS failed to consider or rejected obvious alternatives to a vaccine mandate without \nevidence.  For example, CMS rejected daily or weekly testing—an option that even OSHA \napproved in its ETS—without citing any evidence for such a conclusion.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614.  \n \n17 “As explained in various places within this RIA and the preamble as a whole, there are major uncertainties as to the \neffects of current variants of SARS-CoV-2 on future infection rates, medical costs, and prevention of major illness or \nmortality. For example, the duration of vaccine effectiveness in preventing COVID-19, reducing disease severity, \nreducing the risk of death, and the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease transmission by those vaccinated are \nnot currently known.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,615. \n \n18 Also, CMS has no data showing forced vaccinations in the healthcare industry has stopped the spread of COVID in \nhospitals.  \n16 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 17 of 32 PageID #: 466\nRather, it assured that it “reviewed scientific evidence on testing” but “found that vaccination is a \nmore effective infection control measure.”  Id. at 61,614.  As discussed elsewhere, this conclusion \ncomes despite its admission that it lacks solid evidence19 regarding transmissibility of COVID by \nthe vaccinated.  Id. at 61,615, 61,612.  Although it is not the Courts duty to ask whether CMS’s \ndecision was “the best one possible” or even whether there were “better [] alternatives,” Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission v. Electric Power Supply Ass’n, 136 S. Ct. 760, 782 (2016), the \nCourt must ensure there exists a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice \nmade.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  \nAs another example, CMS rejected20 mandate alternatives in those with natural immunity \nby a previous coronavirus infection.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614 (noting “many uncertainties” about \nthe immunity in those previously infected “compared to people who are vaccinated”).  But, \nelsewhere, it plainly contradicts itself regarding the value of natural immunity.  Id. at 61,604 \n(“[A]bout 100,000 a day have recovered from infection . . . . These changes reduce the risk to both \nhealth care staff and patients substantially, likely by about 20 million persons a month who are no \nlonger sources of future infections.”) (emphasis added).  Such contradictions are tell-tale signs of \nunlawful agency actions.  See State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (finding agency action arbitrary and \ncapricious if the agency explained its decision in a way that “runs counter to the evidence before \nthe agency”); see also Bethesda Health, Inc. v. Azar, 389 F. Supp. 3d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2019) (setting \naside as arbitrary and capricious agency action that contradicts its own regulations). \n \n \n19 Far from being reasonable to prohibit alternatives to vaccination, this constitutes a compelling reason to utilize, \nrather than reject, other alternatives before subjecting the public to a never-before CMS vaccine mandate. \n \n20 CMS also rejected natural immunity, despite an intense public debate and a trove of scientific data on the strength \nand durability of natural immunity from COVID-19—alone and compared to vaccine-induced immunity.  State Farm, \n463 U.S. at 43 (noting “the agency must examine the relevant data”). \n17 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 18 of 32 PageID #: 467\n3.  The mandate is arbitrary and capricious because of its \nbroad scope. \n \nThe broad scope of healthcare facilities covered by the mandate renders it arbitrary.  The \nmandate applies equally to the varying healthcare facility types it covers, such as Psychiatric \nResidential Treatment Facilities (“PRTFs”) for individuals under age twenty-one, see 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,576, and LTCs, see id. at 61,575.  But, at the same time, CMS acknowledges that the risk of \nCOVID to those in the former age group is markedly smaller.  See, e.g., id. at 61,610 n.247 \n(recognizing that “risk of death from infection from an unvaccinated 75-to 84-year-old person is \n320 times more likely than the risk for an 18- to 29-years old person”); id. at 61,601 (“Among \nthose infected, the death rate for older adults age 65 or higher was hundreds of time higher than \nfor those in their 20s during 2020.”); id. at 61,566 (noting those aged 65 years and older account \nfor more than 80-percent of U.S. COVID-19 related deaths).  What is more, besides applying to \nall facilities equally, the mandate applies to all facilities’ staff equally, “regardless of . . . patient \ncontact.”  Id. at 61,570 (emphasis added).  The mandate goes so far as to cover a third-party \nvendor’s “crew working on a construction project” whose members use the same bathrooms \n“during their breaks.”  Id. at 61,571.  CMS provides no reasoned21 explanation for this overbroad \napproach, and it further belies its asserted interest in protecting patients from COVID.22  Cty. of \nLos Angeles v. Shalala, 192 F.3d 1005, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“Where the agency has failed to \nprovide a reasoned explanation, or where the record belies the agency’s conclusion, [the court] \nmust undo its action.”). \n \n21 As explained in infra note 24, upping vaccination nation-wide is not a “reasonable” reason for CMS to enact its \nmandate because the agency’s powers are limited to Medicare and Medicare—not federalizing healthcare and reaching \nthe general public.  Rather, the overbroad approach indicates the pretextual nature of this mandate.    \n \n22 The Court also notes that recently, on November 12, 2021, CMS itself revised its pandemic guidance for nursing \nhome visitation, specifically opening facility visitation “for all residents at all times” by family and friends who are \nnot required to be vaccinated.  This also belies CMS’s asserted interest in protecting patients from COVID, and \ninstead, shows that the mandate’s overbreadth is to increase the national vaccination rate by any means necessary.  \n18 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 19 of 32 PageID #: 468\n4.  The mandate is arbitrary and capricious due to CMS’s \nsudden change in course.  \n \nCMS  failed  to  adequately  explain  its  contradiction  to  its  long-standing  practice  of \nencouraging rather than forcing—by governmental mandate—vaccination.  For years, CMS has \npromulgated regulations setting the conditions for Medicare and Medicaid participation; never has \nit required any vaccine for covered facilities’ employees—despite concerns over other illnesses \nand their corresponding low vaccination rates.23  As recent as this May, CMS adopted an IFC \nrequiring education on COVID vaccines but again decided against forced vaccination.   \nIt is generally “arbitrary or capricious” to depart from a prior policy sub silentio; when \nagencies contradict a prior policy, they must show “good reasons for the new policy.”  FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009); accord EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, \nL.P., 572 U.S. 489, 510 (2014) (holding that agency “retained discretion to alter its course [under \na regulation] provided it gave a reasonable explanation for doing so”).  Here, CMS’s purported \nreason for changing its policy is to force those unwilling or hesitant to receive the vaccine into \nreceiving it, all under the guise of protecting recipients of Medicare and Medicaid.  See 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,583 (noting “CMS initially chose . . . to encourage rather than mandate vaccination” \nbut “vaccine uptake among health care staff [was not] as robust as hoped for”); id. at 61,569 (noting \nthat  despite  healthcare  worker  hesitation  about  the  vaccine,  “mandates  have  already  been \nsuccessfully initiated in a variety of health care settings, systems, and states”); id. at 61,560 (noting \nit was “compelled to require staff vaccinations for COVID-19” given its “responsibility to protect \nthe health and safety of individuals . . . receiving care and services from for Medicare- and \n \n23 In the Mandate, CMS discusses how influenza is a major problem plaguing the healthcare industry.  Nonetheless, \nCMS states that half of healthcare workers resist the seasonal influenza vaccine nationwide, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,568, \nbut that it continues to “recommend” influenza vaccination rather than mandate it.  Id.  Even though CMS has evidence \nthat influenza vaccination of health care staff is associated with declines in nosocomial influenza in hospitalized \npatients and nursing home residents.  Id. at 61,557. \n19 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 20 of 32 PageID #: 469\nMedicaid-certified providers and suppliers”).  But even if forcing the administration of a specific \nvaccine, into the otherwise unwilling, in an effort to protect the recipients of these programs could \nbe a reasonable explanation to justify the extraordinary action—action that long has been the \nprovince of the states, see Zucht, 260 U.S. at 176 (noting that precedent had long “settled that it is \nwithin  the  police  power  of  a  state  to  provide  for  compulsory  vaccination”);  Jacobson  v. \nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25–26 (1905) (similar)—CMS has not shown that it is reasonable in \nthis instance.24  Rather, it specifically notes that the vaccines’ effectiveness to prevent disease \ntransmission by those vaccinated is not currently known.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,615 (noting “the \nduration of vaccine effectiveness in preventing COVID-19, reducing disease severity, reducing the \nrisk of death, and the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease transmission by those \nvaccinated are not currently known”).  \n5.  The mandate is arbitrary and capricious because CMS \nfailed to consider or properly weigh necessary reliance \ninterests. \n \nBecause CMS changed course, it was required to “be cognizant that longstanding policies \nmay have ‘engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’”  Fox Television, \n \n24 The inadequacy of the explanation for the reversal is especially true since Plaintiffs will likely succeed in \ndemonstrating it is a pretextual rationale.  See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575–76 (2019); id. at \n2583 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting Court “opened a Pandora’s box of pretext-based \nchallenges in administrative law”); id. at 2597 (Alito, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  While a court may \nnot set aside an agency’s policymaking decision “solely because it might have been influenced by political \nconsiderations or prompted by an Administration’s priorities,” Department of Commerce, 139 S. Ct. at 2573, an \nagency’s change in course “cannot be solely a matter of political winds and currents.”  North Carolina Growers’ \nAssociation, Inc. v. United Farm Workers, 702 F.3d 755, 772 (4th Cir. 2012) (Wilkinson, J., concurring).  Plaintiffs \nhave demonstrated that they could likely show pretext.  See, e.g., Doc. [9] at 4 (citing Joseph Biden, Remarks at the \nWhite House (Sept. 9, 2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/ (decrying “nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get \nthe shot” while announcing “a new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated” and explaining that “[i]f you’re \nseeking care at a health facility, you should be able to know that the people treating you are vaccinated.  Simple.  \nStraightforward.  Period.”); see also 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,601 (“the protective scope of this rule is far broader than the \nhealth care staff that it directly affects”); see also id. at 61,612 (“Staff vaccination will also provide significant \ncommunity benefits when staff are not at work.”).  The Court “cannot ignore the disconnect between the decision \nmade and the explanation given.”  Dep’t of Com., 139 S. Ct. at 2575.  \n20 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 21 of 32 PageID #: 470\n556 U.S. at 515.  Ignoring reliance interests is necessarily arbitrary and capricious.  Id.  Yet, it \nappears this is what CMS did.  An agency is required to assess whether there were reliance \ninterests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing \npolicy concerns. Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1915.   \nIn concluding that the mandate’s benefits outweigh the risks to the healthcare industry, \nCMS did not properly consider all necessary reliance interests of facilities, healthcare workers, \nand patients.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,607–10.  CMS looked only at evidence from interested parties in \nfavor of the mandate, while completely ignoring evidence from interested parties in opposition. \nConsumers Union of U. S., Inc. v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n, 491 F.2d 810, 812 (2d Cir. \n1974) (noting agency “must not ignore evidence placed before it by interested parties”).  In fact, \nCMS foreclosed these parties’ ability to provide information regarding the mandate’s effects on \nthe healthcare industry, while simultaneously dismissing those concerns based on “insufficient \nevidence.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569.   But facts do not cease to exist simply because they are ignored, \nand “[s]tating that a factor was considered25 is not a substitute for considering it.”  Texas v. Biden, \n10 F.4th 538, 556 (5th Cir. 2021) (internal quotations and alterations omitted); Sierra Club, 459 \nF. Supp. 2d at 100 (“Merely describing an impact and stating a conclusion of non-impairment is \ninsufficient[.]”); Gresham v. Azar, 363 F. Supp. 3d 165, 177 (D.D.C. 2019) (“The bottom line: the \nSecretary did no more than acknowledge—in a conclusory manner, no less—that commenters \nforecast a loss in Medicaid coverage.”).  Had CMS followed the proper procedural requirements, \n \n25 Several times throughout the mandate, CMS acknowledges the countervailing effect it will have on the healthcare \nindustry.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,607 (“currently there are endemic staff shortages for almost all categories of \nemployees at almost all kinds of health care providers and supplier and these may be made worse if any substantial \nnumber of unvaccinated employees leave health care employment altogether”); id. at 61,567 (“and the urgent need to \naddress COVID-related staffing shortages that are disrupting patient access to care, provides strong justification as to \nthe need to issue this IFC requiring staff vaccination for most provider and supplier types over which we have \nauthority.”).  Yet, despite these acknowledged concerns about intensifying an already-existing healthcare crisis, CMS \ndecided to move forward anyway, without properly considering the totality of interests affected by the mandate, such \nas rural hospitals.  \n21 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 22 of 32 PageID #: 471\nStates, healthcare providers, and healthcare workers would have submitted critical information to \nCMS—instead of to the Courts26—showing that the mandate portends a disaster for the healthcare \nindustry, particularly in rural communities.  Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1816, \n(2019)  (requiring  HHS  to  undertake  notice-and-comment  rulemaking,  in  part,  because  it \n“neglected to acknowledge the potential countervailing benefits”); Time Warner Cable Inc. v. \nFCC, 729 F.3d 137, 168 (2nd Cir. 2013) (explaining APA policies are “to ensure the agency has \nall  pertinent  information  before  it  when  making  a  decision”).    By  dispensing  with  those \nrequirements,  CMS  ignored  evidence  showing  that  the  mandate  threatens  devastating \nconsequences to healthcare providers, staff, and patients throughout the nation.  \nEven if CMS did properly consider these reliance issues—which this Court finds it most \nlikely did not—the scant evidence of record shows CMS was unable to adequately balance these \nreliance interests because it placed a rock on one side of the scale and a feather on the other.  \nRegents, 140 S. Ct. at 1914 (failing to weigh reliance interests against competing policy concerns \nis arbitrary and capricious).  And as already explained, these evidence deficiencies are solely a \nproduct of its own doing.  So, either CMS entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem or failed to weigh the interests properly; regardless, either way the pendulum swings, \nCMS’s actions, or rather, inaction, violates basic tenants of administrative law.  Id.; State Farm, \n463 U.S. at 43 (noting that “entirely fail[ing] to consider an important aspect of the problem” is \n \n26 It is not the job of this Court to collect evidence and opposition from affected parties; rather, this is the role, actually \na duty, of CMS when promulgating a rule.  See District of Colombia v. United States Dep’t of Agriculture, 496 F. \nSupp. 3d 213, 228 (D.D.C. 2020) (emphasizing that one purpose of notice and comment rulemaking is to “give affected \nparties an opportunity to develop evidence in the record to support their objections to the rule and thereby enhance the \nquality of judicial review”); Hoctor v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 82 F.3d 165, 167 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Notice and \ncomment rulemaking . . . facilitates the marshaling of opposition to a proposed rule, and may result in the creation of \na very long record that may in turn provide a basis for a judicial challenge to the rule if the agency decides to \npromulgate it.”).  \n22 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 23 of 32 PageID #: 472\narbitrary and capricious); Michigan, 576 U.S. at 750–52 (noting “agency action is lawful only if it \nrests on a consideration of the relevant factors” and “important aspects of the problem”). \nIn conclusion, Plaintiffs likely can show the CMS mandate is arbitrary and capricious \nbecause the evidence does not show a rational connection to support implementing the vaccine \nmandate, the mandate’s broad scope, the unreasonable rejection of alternatives to vaccination, \nCMS’s inadequate explanation for its change in course, and its failure to consider or properly \nweigh reliance interests.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ challenges to the mandate show a great likelihood of success on \nthe merits, and this fact weighs critically in favor of a preliminary injunction.  Home Instead, 721 \nF.3d at 497 (“While no single factor is determinative, the probability of success factor is the most \nsignificant.” (internal quotations and citations omitted)). \nb.  Plaintiffs demonstrate irreparable harm. \nThe Court must next determine whether Plaintiffs have shown that they are “likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.”  Benisek v. Lamone, 138 S. Ct. 1942, 1944 \n(2018) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  Plaintiffs must \nshow more than a mere “possibility,” but they need not show a certainty; rather, they need to \ndemonstrate “irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  \nPlaintiffs have done so here.   \nThe  Plaintiff  States  bring  their  claims  in  a  number  of  capacities:  sovereign,  quasi-\nsovereign/parens patriae, and proprietary.  See, e.g., Doc. [1] ¶¶ 5, 7, 9.  Through their various \ninterests, they have shown irreparable injury is more than likely in the absence of an injunction.  \n23 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 24 of 32 PageID #: 473\nFirst,  Plaintiffs  sovereign  interests27  are  likely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  without  a \npreliminary injunction because they will be unable to enforce their duly enacted laws surrounding \nvaccination mandates and providing proof of vaccination.  See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat § 67.265; 2021 \nAlaska Sess. Laws ch. 2, § 17; Ark. Code § 20-7-143; see also, e.g., Ark. Code § 11-5-118.  The \nmandate notes that it “preempts inconsistent State and local laws as applied to Medicare- and \nMedicaid-certified providers and suppliers.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,568.  Generally, this preemption \nwould be unremarkable.  See U.S. Const. art. VI, § 2.  But, as here, where CMS likely did not \nlawfully enact its mandate, Plaintiffs are harmed because they cannot enforce their duly enacted \nlaws and no lawfully enacted regulation preempts them.  The injury that results when a state cannot \nenforce “statutes enacted by representatives of its people” is irreparable.  Maryland v. King, 567 \nU.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (quoting New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. \nOrrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)); accord Org. for \nBlack Struggle v. Ashcroft, 978 F.3d 603, 609 (8th Cir. 2020) (“Prohibiting the State from \nenforcing a statute properly passed . . . would irreparably harm the State.”). \nSecond, Plaintiffs quasi-sovereign interests are likely to suffer irreparable harm without a \npreliminary injunction.  Unlike the harm Plaintiffs likely would face to their sovereign interests—\nwhich though significant, is more abstract—the harm Plaintiffs likely would face to their quasi-\nsovereign interests would be observable and appreciable.  Indeed, the likely harm would be harm \nin the colloquial sense—pain, suffering, distress.  Plaintiffs have a quasi-sovereign interest “in the \nhealth and well-being—both physical and economic—of [their] residents, Alfred L. Snapp & Son, \nInc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982), and Plaintiffs have put forth evidence that this \nmandate would have a detrimental effect on the health and well-bring of their citizens.   \n \n27 The States also have an interest in seeing their constitutionally reserved police power over public health policy \ndefended from federal overreach, as discussed in depth in section II.B.a.i.2. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 25 of 32 PageID #: 474\nReview of the affidavits filed in support of Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction \nshows the harm to the physical health and well-being of their states’ citizens if the mandate is not \nenjoined.  The Plaintiffs’ affidavits came from varying healthcare entities and associations in their \nstates impacted by the mandate.  The affiants describe existing and significant staffing shortages \nas well as open and unfilled positions for an extended period of time, some for more than a year.  \nSee, e.g., Doc. [9-7] at 3; Doc. [9-11] at 3; Doc. [9-25] at 3; Doc. [9-3] at 4.  The affidavits also \ndemonstrate that the mandate will more than likely exacerbate the already-existing staffing \nproblem.  Many of the affidavits generally describe the number of individuals employed by the \nentity and the number or percentage of employees either known or reasonably known to have not \nbeen vaccinated.28  See, e.g., Doc. [9-4] at 3, 4; Doc. [9-3] at 4.  Through talks, surveys, and direct \nconversations with staff, the affiants know the individuals that will leave employment if CMS goes \nahead with its mandate.  See, e.g., Doc. [9-4] at 3; Doc. [9-5] at 3; Doc. [9-13] at 4; Doc. [9-19] at \n3; Doc. [9-20] at 3.  Already, in some cases, the mere announcement of CMS’s mandate has \ncompelled some to resign.  See, e.g., Doc. [9-26] at 2. \nStaff reductions due to implementing the mandate, especially in light of the already \nunderstaffed healthcare facilities, will cause a cascade of consequences.  See, e.g., Doc. [9-16] at \n3–6.  The mandate’s effect of reducing staff will decrease the quality of care provided at facilities, \ncompromise the safety of patients, and place even more stress on the remaining staff.  See, e.g., \nDoc. [9-11] at 4.  The mandate “creates a risk in patient safety” and will create “ongoing ripple \neffects on . . . patients, remaining employees and [the] community for some time in the future.”  \nDoc. [9-18] at 5.  An affiant noted that “even if we can technically staff services with extra shift \nand call, we are already doing that, have been doing that for more than a year, and our vaccinated \n \n28 CMS itself notes that rural hospitals are less vaccinated than urban.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613 (recognizing that “rural \nhospitals are having greater problems with employee vaccination . . . than urban hospitals”).  \n25 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 26 of 32 PageID #: 475\nstaff will not be capable of doing it for much longer. At this point, considering it is nearly \nimpossible to recruit clinical staff today, more will resign due to the stress and burnout that will \ninevitably exist.”  Doc. [9-23] at 5.    \nThe loss of certain staffing categories will diminish entire areas of care within a facility \nthat inevitably implicate others.  See, e.g., Doc. [9-19] at 3 (warning of the loss of the only \nremaining anesthesiologist); Doc. [9-21] at 3 (warning of the loss of 80% of imaging department); \nDoc. [9-14] at 3; Doc. [9-18] at 4; Doc. [9-25] at 4.  Facilities in rural locations, already hard-\npressed to find qualified applicants regardless of vaccination status, will have to evaluate what \nhealthcare services they could still safely provide, if any at all, in the region they serve.  See, e.g., \nDoc. [9-4] at 4; Doc. [9-7] at 3–4; Doc. [9-9] at 2–5; Doc. [9-12] at 4; Doc. [9-13] at 4; Doc. [9-\n19] at 3; Doc. [9-23] at 4.  As an example, for a general hospital located in North Platte, Nebraska, \nimplementation of the mandate would result in the loss of the only remaining anesthesiologist.  \nDoc. [9-19] at 3.  Understandably, without an anesthesiologist, there could be no surgeries—at all.  \nThus, such a loss irreparably causes a cascading effect on the entire facility and a wide-range of \npatients.    Other  examples  show  the  mandate’s  far-reaching  implications  not  just  on  the \nadministration of healthcare itself, but the functioning of the facilities in general.  For example, \nthe building manager of a nursing home in Memphis, Missouri states he will leave if the choice is \nbetween his job or the vaccine.  Doc. [9-9] at 3–4.  If the mandate takes effect, then, the nursing \nhome  would  have  “no  one  competent  enough  to  run  [the]  building  and  [perform]  all  the \ncomplicated systems and required inspections.”  Id.  Also, this type of position is not the kind that \ncan be filled “quickly, especially with today’s workforce and being in a rural setting.”  Id.  Other \naffidavits also detail an especially hard impact to emergency services in rural areas.  See, e.g., Doc. \n[9-21] at 2–3 (“If we lose our imaging department we will have to divert many of our emergency \n26 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 27 of 32 PageID #: 476\npatients to other facilities; the closest one is 45 miles away.”); Doc. [9-11] at 4 (explaining that in \nthe event this hospital closes, the nearest one would be thirty miles away); Doc. [9-12] at 2–3 \n(similar); Doc. [9-16] at 6 (similar). \nFurther, the loss of staffing in many instances will result in no care at all, as some facilities \nwill be forced to close altogether.  For example, the Administrator of the Scotland County Care \nCenter (SCCC), a nursing home located in Memphis, Missouri, notes that out of about sixty-five \nemployees, twenty have indicated that they are opposed to taking the vaccine, and if the mandate \nis imposed, that they will quit.29  Doc. [9-9] at 2.  A loss of twenty staff members will cause SCCC \nto “close its doors” and displace residents that have lived in that community their entire lives. Id. \nat 5; see also Doc. [9-26] at 4.  Thus, if the mandate goes into effect, it will irreparably harm \npatients30 by impeding access to care for the elderly and for persons who cannot afford it—directly \ncontrary to Medicare and Medicaid’s core objective of providing proper care.  In sum, Plaintiffs’ \nevidence shows that facilities—rural facilities in particular—likely would face crisis standards of \ncare or will have no choice but to close to new patients or close altogether, both of which would \ncause significant, and irreparable, harm to Plaintiffs’ citizens.  Kai v. Ross, 336 F.3d 650, 656 (8th \nCir. 2003) (finding “danger to plaintiffs’ health, and perhaps even their lives, gives them a strong \nargument of irreparable injury”).31    \n \n29 This includes SCCC’s billing and accounting staff members, which would create a “substantial disruption” in \nSCCC’s business functions, as well as their building plant manager, “that would leave me with no one competent \nenough to run my building and all the complicated systems and required inspections.”  Id. at 4.   \n \n30 Medicare and Medicaid programs “touch[] the lives of nearly all Americans” and are two of the “largest federal \nprogram[s]” in the country.  See Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. at 1808.   \n \n31 “No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded . . . than the right of every individual to the possession \nand control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable \nauthority of law.”  Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251 (1891).  As already explained, CMS most \nlikely does not have the authority to promulgate the mandate, and clear congressional authorization is also lacking.  \n“Irreparable harm occurs when a party has no adequate remedy at law, typically because its injuries cannot be fully \ncompensated through an award of damages.’”  Rogers Group, Inc. v. City of Fayetteville, Ark., 629 F.3d 784, 789 (8th \nCir. 2010) (quoting Gen. Motors Corp. v. Harry Brown’s, L.L.C., 563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009)).  It follows then, \n27 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 28 of 32 PageID #: 477\nBesides the harm to physical health that Plaintiffs have shown will likely occur absent a \npreliminary injunction, the mandate also would have a negative effect on the economies in Plaintiff \nstates, especially, once again, in rural areas.32  While economic injuries normally would be \nreparable  at  law,  “federal  agencies  generally  enjoy  sovereign  immunity  for  any  monetary \ndamages.”  Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. v. United States Food & Drug Admin., 16 F.4th \n1130, 1142 (5th Cir. 2021); see also 5 U.S.C. § 702 (providing for an action seeking relief “other \nthan money damages”).  Therefore, the economic loses in Plaintiff states would be unrecoverable \nand thus irreparable.  Iowa Utls. Bd. v. FCC, 109 F.3d 418, 426 (8th Cir. 1996) (“The threat of \nunrecoverable economic loss, however, does qualify as irreparable harm.”); DISH Network Serv. \nL.L.C. v. Laducer, 725 F.3d 877, 882 (8th Cir. 2013).  \nFourth, and finally, Plaintiffs would likely face irreparable harm to their proprietary \ninterests absent a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs themselves operate healthcare facilities that \nCMS’s mandate reaches.  They therefore would face the same harms any private owner of a facility \nfaces, like the “business and financial effects of a lost or suspended employee, compliance and \nmonitoring costs associated with the Mandate, [or] the diversion of resources necessitated by the \nMandate.”  BST Holdings, 17 F.4th at ---.  As just noted, since these costs could not be recovered \nfrom the federal government, they are irreparable.  Iowa Utls. Bd., 109 F.3d at 426. \nFor  all  these  reasons,  the  Court  finds  that  Plaintiffs  are  likely  to  suffer  significant \nirreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction. \n \nthat forcing individuals to choose “between their job(s) and their jab(s),” BST Holdings, 17 F.4th at ---, substantially \nburdens the liberty interests of individuals, which cannot be fully compensated through an award of damages.   \n \n32 For example, Callaway District Hospital and Medical Clinics is the largest employer in Callaway, Nebraska and is \na “significant driver of the local business and agriculture economy.”  Doc. [9-12] at 4.  The expected loss of staff \nwould “almost certainly” lead to closure of the facility.  Id. “Cherry County Hospital is a leader of employment” for \nits county.  Doc. [9-16] at 6.  “Kimball County Manor and Assisted Living employs 55 full time staff and as such is \none of the largest employers in Kimball County, a rural county located in Nebraska’s western panhandle.”  Doc.

The balance of equities tip in favor of Plaintiffs, and the public has an \ninterest in an injunction. \n \nFinally, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs have shown that the “balance of \nequities tips in [their] favor” and that “an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at \n20.  Courts “must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each \nparty of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.”  Id. at 24.  When the party opposing \nthe injunction is the federal government, the balance-of-harms factor “merge[s]” with the public-\ninterest factor.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 436 (2009).    \nThe public has an interest in stopping the spread of COVID.  No one disputes that.  But the \nCourt concludes that the public would suffer little, if any, harm from maintaining the “status quo” \nthrough the litigation of this case.  Defendants argue that “enjoining the rule would harm the public \ninterest by further exposing Medicare and Medicaid patients and staff—and the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs—to unvaccinated health care workers.”  Doc. [23] at 48.  But CMS’s own \nconclusions undercut this argument.  See id. at 61,615 (“[T]he effectiveness of the vaccine to \nprevent disease transmission by those vaccinated [is] not currently known.”); id. at 61,612.  \nRegardless, the pandemic has continued more than twenty months now.  Vaccine rates rise every \nday, and more therapeutics and treatments for the virus are available than ever before.  The status \nquo today, without the CMS mandate, is still far better than the public faced even just a few months \nago.   \nAnd  while,  according  to  CMS,  the  effectiveness  of  the  vaccine  to  prevent  disease \ntransmission by those vaccinated is not currently known, what is known based on the evidence \nbefore the Court is that the mandate will have a crippling effect on a significant number of \n29 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 30 of 32 PageID #: 479\nhealthcare facilities in Plaintiffs’ states, especially in rural areas,33 create a critical shortage of \nservices (resulting in no medical care at all in some instances), and jeopardize the lives of \nnumerous vulnerable citizens.  The prevalent, tangible, and irremediable impact of the mandate \ntips the balance of equities in favor of a preliminary injunction.  \nTo  be  sure,  the  Court  looks  at  the  principles  underlying  preliminary  injunctions. \nDataphase, 640 F.2d at 113 n.5 (quoting Love v. Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 185 F. 321, 331 (8th \nCir. 1911) (“The controlling reason for the existence of the judicial power to issue a [preliminary] \ninjunction is that the court may thereby prevent such a change in the relations and conditions of \npersons and property as may result in irremediable injury to some of the parties before their claims \ncan be investigated and adjudicated.”).  Although the parties disagree on the magnitude of the \nmandate’s disruption to the healthcare industry, both agree a disruption is certain and imminent.  \nThus, the importance of enjoining the mandate, and thus preserving the “status quo,” is imperative. \nDataphase, 640 F.2d at 113 (8th Cir. 1981) (“[T]he question is whether the balance of equities so \nfavors the movant that justice requires the court to intervene to preserve the status quo until the \nmerits are determined.”).  And “[t]here is clearly a robust public interest in safeguarding prompt \naccess to health care.”  Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. DHS, 485 F. Supp. 3d 1, 61 (D.D.C. 2020).   \nThe Court finds that in balancing the equities, the scale falls clearly in favor of healthcare \nfacilities operating with some unvaccinated employees, staff, trainees, students, volunteers, and \n \n33 The disproportionate impact the mandate will have on rural communities is why CMA’s “one-size-fits-all \nsledgehammer” approach does not work and in fact, undermines CMA’s focus on providing proper care.  See BST \nHoldings, 17 F.4th at ---.  This is why healthcare matters are typically left to the States, because these policy decisions \nare matters dependent on local factors and conditions, and Federalism allows States to tailor such matters in the best \ninterests of their communities.  The Court agrees with Plaintiffs point that whatever might make sense in Chicago, St. \nLouis, or New York City, could be actually counterproductive and harmful in rural communities like Memphis (MO) \nor McCook (NE).  Doc. [1] at 1–2. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 31 of 32 PageID #: 480\ncontractors, rather than the swift, irremediable impact of requiring healthcare facilities to choose \nbetween two undesirable choices—providing substandard care or providing no healthcare at all.34 \nIt is true that the Agency would face irreparable harm if it is unable to enforce a properly \nauthorized and enacted regulation.  But, as discussed above, the Court has concluded CMS likely \ndid not enact the mandate at issue lawfully.  Thus, any interest CMS may have in enforcing an \nunlawful rule is likely illegitimate.  See BST Holdings, 17 F.4th at ---.  By this same conclusion, \nthe public would benefit from the preliminary injunction because it would ensure that federal \nagencies do not extend their power beyond the express delegation from Congress, as already \ndiscussed.  And while “it is indisputable that the public has a strong interest in combating the \nspread of COVID-19,” “our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of \ndesirable ends.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2490. \nIn conclusion, CMS mandate raises substantial questions of law and fact that must be \ndetermined, as discussed throughout this opinion.  Because it is evident CMS significantly \nunderstates the burden that its mandate would impose on the ability of healthcare facilities to \nprovide proper care, and thus, save lives, the public has an interest in maintaining the “status quo” \nwhile the merits of the case are determined.  Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 113; Love, 185 F. at 331.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Doc. [6], is \nGRANTED.   \nAccordingly, \n \n34 CMS also discusses that the upcoming influenza season will further exacerbate the strain on the healthcare system.  \nHowever, one would assume that the onset of flu season coupled with COVID would be a reason to avoid critical \nstaffing shortages at healthcare facilities—not to exacerbate them.  \n31 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  28   Filed: 11/29/21   Page: 32 of 32 PageID #: 481\nIT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  Defendants  are  preliminarily  enjoined  from  the \nimplementation and enforcement of 86 Fed.

As \nof the time of the issuance two weeks ago of the rule at issue in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that \ncauses COVID-19, had infected over 44 million people, hospitalized more than 3 million people, and \nhad claimed more than 720,000 lives in the United States alone.  Those numbers have only grown \nsince.    See  Centers  for  Disease  Control  (“CDC”),  COVID  Data  Tracker  Weekly  Review, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html (updated Nov. 19, \n2021).  More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 68,000 new cases \nand over 1,000 new deaths are reported in the United States every day.  See id.  Included among the \ntremendous human cost are at least half a million reported cases and 1,900 reported deaths among \nhealth  care  staff.    Medicare  and  Medicaid  Programs;  Omnibus  COVID-19 Health  Care  Staff \nVaccination,  86 Fed. Reg. 61,555, 61,559 (Nov. 5, 2021).  The pandemic has been devastating  for \nhealth care facilities and for patients alike.  Because the virus is highly transmissible,  it can easily pass \nfrom person to person at health care facilities.  Beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, \nin  particular,  are more likely  than  the  general  population  to suffer serious  outcomes,  including \nhospitalization  or death, from contracting the disease.   \nFortunately,  there  are  three  vaccines  that  have  now  been  approved or  authorized  for \nemergency use in the United States to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  These vaccines are safe and \nhighly effective.  In health care settings in particular, the weight of the scientific  evidence shows that \nvaccinated people are less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2, and are less likely to pass it \nalong to others, than are those who have not been vaccinated.   \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services reviewed this evidence and concluded that action \nwas urgently needed to protect Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries  from the possibility  that they \nwould become infected with the virus while they receive care in facilities  funded by these programs.  \nCongress has assigned the Secretary a statutory responsibility to ensure that the health and safety of \npatients are protected in these federally-funded facilities.  He accordingly issued a rule to do so.   \nThe Secretary’s rule requires certain health care facilities,  as a condition of their participation \n1 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 16 of 66 PageID #: 359\nin these programs, to ensure that those members of their health care staffs who interact with patients, \nor who have  contact with other staff who do so, receive vaccination  for COVID-19, absent an \nexemption.  These staff members are required to be vaccinated (or to obtain the first shot of a two-\ndose regimen) by December 6, or to request an exemption from this requirement from their employer.  \nNon-exempt employees who follow a two-shot regimen must complete their second shot by January \n4, 2022.  The Secretary issued his rule on an emergency basis, and waived a comment period in advance \nof issuing  the  rule,  because  he  foresaw an  imminent  need  to protect  Medicare  and  Medicaid \nbeneficiaries  against a spike in COVID-19 cases in the coming winter months.   Although  precise \ncalculations  on this score are of course not possible, he determined that his rule was likely to save \nhundreds, and possibly thousands, of lives each month, once it is implemented. \nThe Plaintiffs  are ten States, who now seek a preliminary injunction  to prevent the Secretary \nfrom enforcing this rule.  But this Court lacks jurisdiction over their claims.  Congress has withdrawn \nfederal-question jurisdiction over claims like this one that arise under the Medicare statute.  Instead, \nCongress has established by statute an exclusive system for judicial review, under which a party must \nfirst present a particular  claim for benefits,  or dispute a particular  sanction,  to the agency for its \nresolution before that party may proceed to federal court.  The Plaintiffs have not met this statutory \nprerequisite for this Court’s jurisdiction.  \n In addition, the Plaintiffs  fail to satisfy any of the requirements for a preliminary injunction.   \nIn particular, the Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims.  The Secretary has the \nstatutory authority and responsibility to ensure that federal funds are used to protect, rather than harm, \nthe  health  and safety  of patients  who receive  care in facilities  that  voluntarily  participate  in  the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs.  He reasonably exercised that authority to arrive at his vaccination \nrule.  He explained his determination that the life-saving potential of the rule compelled him to take \naction now.  In so doing, he took into account the rule’s potential costs, including the possibility that \nsome health  care  workers would seek other  employment rather  than  accept  vaccination,  but he \nconcluded, on the basis of real-world experience with vaccination  requirements,  that relatively  few \nhealth care workers would do so.  Given that about a quarter of a health care facility’s staff on average \n2 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 17 of 66 PageID #: 360\nare new hires in any given year, he concluded that the effects of workers leaving for other employment \nto avoid vaccination, and the countervailing effects of other employees newly seeking jobs in facilities \nthat require vaccination,  would be dwarfed by the effects of this  regular churn  in the health  care \nworkforce.  The Secretary accordingly reasonably chose to take action,  on an emergency basis, to \nprotect lives in the coming weeks and months.   \nNor can the Plaintiffs  meet the remaining  preliminary injunction  factors.  They have not \nshown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief.  The only harm the \nPlaintiffs  might  even  have  Article  III  standing  to assert—an  alleged  economic  loss—is  entirely \nspeculative, as the Northern District of Florida recently concluded.  Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., No. 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021), Order at 8, ECF No. 6 (denying \npreliminary injunction motion in a nearly identical suit for the State’s failure to show irreparable harm).  \nAnd the equities and the public interest weigh heavily against the entry of preliminary injunctive  relief.  \nGranting the requested injunction would harm the public’s significant interest in protecting the health \nof Medicare and Medicaid patients.  An injunction would increase the likelihood that health care staff \nwill infect those patients with the virus and thus the likelihood that they will suffer COVID-19 illness \nor death.  It will also increase the risks to the health of health care staff and exacerbate some known \ncauses  of staffing  shortages  at Medicare- and Medicaid-participating  facilities.   These  compelling \ninterests  easily  outweigh  the  speculative  economic  harm  that  might  befall  the Plaintiffs  absent \npreliminary relief.   \nFor all of these reasons, the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction  should be denied. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The COVID-19 pandemic  has had devastating effects on Medicare and Medicaid \npatients, and on health care workers. \n  The  novel  coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2 causes  a severe  acute  respiratory  disease  known as \nCOVID-19.  86 Fed.

As of mid-October 2021, over 44 million  COVID-19 cases,  3 million \nCOVID-19 related hospitalizations,  and 720,000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported in the United \n3 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 18 of 66 PageID #: 361\nStates.  Id.  Over half a million COVID-19 cases and 1,900 deaths have been reported among health \ncare staff alone.  Id. at 61,559.  COVID-19 has now “overtaken the 1918 influenza pandemic as the \ndeadliest disease in American history.”  Id. at 61,556. \nRecent  estimates  of undiagnosed infections  and under-reported deaths  indicate  that these \nfigures likely underestimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Id. at 61,557 n.4 (citing Seyed \nM. Moghadas and Alison P. Galvani, The Unrecognized Death Toll of COVID-19 in the United States, Lancet \nRegional  Health  Americas  (Sept.  1,  2021),  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100033).    These \nfigures also fail to capture the widespread and devastating effects of post-acute illness from the virus, \nincluding  long-term  nervous  system  and neurocognitive  disorders, cardiovascular  disorders,  and \nreduced quality of life.  Id. at 61,557 n.5 (citing Destin Groff, et al., Short-Term and Long-Term Rates of \nPostacute  Sequelae  of  SARS-CoV-2  Infection,  JAMA  Network  Open  (Oct.  13,  2021), \nhttps://doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.28568).   \nBecause the virus that causes  COVID-19 is highly transmissible,  it is easily  spread among \nhealth care workers, and from health care workers to patients, in health care facilities.  Id. at 61,557 \nn.16 (citing,  e.g., Jonne J. Sikkens,  et al., Serologic Surveillance  and Phylogenetic  Analysis  of SARS-CoV-2 \nInfection  among  Health  Care  Workers,  JAMA  Network  Open  (July  28,  2021), \nhttp://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.18554).  Unvaccinated health care workers are highly \nsusceptible to transmitting the virus to their colleagues and to their patients.  Id. at 61,558 n.42 (citing, \ne.g., Scott C. Roberts, et al., Correlation of Healthcare Worker Vaccination with Inpatient Healthcare-Associated \nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), 2021 Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology 1 (Sept. 21, \n2021)).  Participants  in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are more likely  to face high risk of \ncontracting COVID-19 and of experiencing severe outcomes from the disease.  Id. at 61,609.  In short, \n“the available evidence for ongoing healthcare-associated  COVID-19 transmission risk is sufficiently \nalarming in and of itself to compel CMS to take action.”  Id. at 61,558.   \nUnvaccinated staff also jeopardize patients’ access to needed medical care and services.  Id.  \nOut of a fear of exposure to the virus, patients  are refusing care from unvaccinated  staff, thereby \nlimiting the ability of providers to meet the health care needs of their patients.  Id.  Patients also are \n4 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 19 of 66 PageID #: 362\nforgoing medically necessary care altogether to avoid contracting SARS-Cov-2 infections from health \ncare workers.  Id.  Absenteeism from health care staff as a result of infection with the virus has also \ncreated staffing shortages that have disrupted patient access to recommended care.  Id. at 61,559.  At \nnursing  homes in particular, overall staffing levels,  as measured on the basis of nursing  hours per \nresident day, have remained stable; however, this appears to be a function of the reduced demand for \nmedical care associated with patients’ fears of contracting the virus from health care facility settings.  \nId.       \nIn June and July 2021, the United States began to experience a dramatic increase in COVID-\n19 case and hospitalization  rates, driven by an especially contagious strain of SARS-CoV-2 known as \nthe Delta variant. Id. at 61,559.  COVID-19 cases among staff of health care facilities  have grown \nsubstantially  since the emergence of the Delta variant.   For example, cases among long-term care \nfacility and end-stage renal disease facility staff have increased by over 1400 percent and 850 percent, \nrespectively,  between June and September 2021.  Id.  Over the same time period, daily cases  of \nCOVID-19 increased over 1200 percent, new hospital admissions increased over 600 percent, and \ndaily deaths increased over 800 percent.  Id. at 61,583.  The vast majority of cases during this time \nperiod were among the unvaccinated population.  Id.    \nIn September and October 2021, newly reported cases began to trend downward, albeit still \nat highly elevated levels,1 but there are troubling indications that a resurgence in the virus is coming \nin the next several weeks, particularly in northern states.  Id. at 61,584.  Respiratory virus infections, \nlike the virus that causes COVID-19, typically circulate more frequently  during the winter months, \nand the United States experienced a large spike in COVID-19 cases during the winter of 2020.  Id.  \nThe 2021-2022 winter influenza season may be an abnormally severe one, given lower immunity levels \nto influenza.   Id.  The interaction  between the COVID-19 virus and the influenza virus may lead to \nparticularly severe outbreaks over the next several months.  Id. at 61,584  n.190 (citing Sonja J. Olson, \n                                              \n1  Those trends have reversed in the two weeks since the issuance  of the rule; case rates are \nnow climbing substantially.   See Centers for Disease Control, COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review, \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html (updated Nov. 19, \n2021). \n5 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 20 of 66 PageID #: 363\net al., Changes in Influenza  and Other Respiratory Virus Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic – United \nStates, 2020-2021, 70 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1013 (July 23, 2021)).  “Accordingly, it \nis imperative that the risk for healthcare-associated  COVID-19 transmission be minimized during the \ninfluenza season.”  Id.        \nII.  Safe and effective vaccines are available to protect patients of health care facilities. \n  Currently, three manufacturers offer vaccines approved or authorized for emergency use in \nthe United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Id. at 61,563.  FDA has authority to \nreview and approve “biological products,” including vaccines, as safe and effective for their intended \nuses.  See 42 U.S.C. § 262(a)(1), (i)(1).  Under § 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 \nU.S.C. § 360bbb-3, FDA also may issue an “emergency use authorization”  (EUA) during a public \nhealth emergency, which authorizes the marketing of vaccines (and other products) “intended for use” \nin responding to the emergency.  \nIn March 2020, the Secretary determined that “circumstances exist justifying the authorization \nof emergency  use  of drugs and biological  products during  the  COVID-19 pandemic[.]”  EUA \nDeclaration, 85 Fed. Reg. 18,250, 18,250–51 (Apr. 1, 2020).  Based on that determination, FDA issued \nEUAs in December 2020 for the  Pfizer-BioNTech  and Moderna vaccines,  and a third  EUA in \nFebruary 2021 for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,564.  The EUAs for \nthe three vaccines  are based on FDA’s review of extensive  safety and efficacy data, including  data \nfrom clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people.  Id. at 61,562.   \nOn August 23, 2021, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine obtained FDA approval, under \nthe name Comirnaty, for people aged 16 years and older.  Id. at 61,564.  In approving Comirnaty, FDA \ndetermined that the vaccine was 91.1% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease and between 95% \nand 100% effective in preventing severe COVID-19 disease, based on an analysis of effectiveness data \nfrom approximately 20,000 vaccine  and 20,000 placebo recipients.   FDA, Comirnaty Approved \nPrescribing Information at 7, 15–18 (revised Aug. 20, 2021), https://perma.cc/53H8-UG3C.  FDA \nconcluded the product is safe based on data from approximately 12,000 vaccine recipients who were \nfollowed for safety  outcomes for at least  six months  after  their  second  dose, as well as  safety \n6 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 21 of 66 PageID #: 364\ninformation from the millions of vaccine doses administered under the EUA.  Id. at 12.    \nCOVID-19 vaccines  currently  approved or  authorized  by  FDA  are  highly  effective  in \npreventing serious outcomes of COVID-19, including severe disease, hospitalization,  and death.  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,565 n.115 (citing https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/workhtml).  \nThe available evidence indicates that these vaccines continue to offer strong protection against known \nvariants of the virus, including the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), particularly against hospitalization  and \ndeath.  Id. at 61,565 n.116  (citing Mark W. Tenforde, et al., Sustained Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and \nModerna Vaccines Against COVID-19 Associated Hospitalizations Among Adults — United States, March–July \n2021, 70 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1156 (Aug. 27, 2021)).   \nThe  available  evidence  indicates  that  COVID-19 vaccines  offer better  protection  than \ninfection-induced  immunity alone does.  Id. at 61,559-60.  Even among those persons with prior \nSARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccination helps prevent reinfection.

Vaccination  of health  care workers is more effective in preventing the transmission  of the \nvirus than are other protocols, such as protocols for masking or regular testing.  Id. at 61,585 n.210 \n(citing, e.g., Michael Klompas, et al., Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 From Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic \nIndividuals in Healthcare Settings Despite Medical Masks and Eye Protection, 73 Clinical Infectious Diseases \n1693 (Nov. 2, 2021)).  \nLike all vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines are not 100 percent effective at preventing infection, \n7 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 22 of 66 PageID #: 365\nand some breakthrough cases are expected among people with full vaccination.  However, the risk of \ndeveloping  COVID-19,  including  severe  illness,  remains  much  higher  for  unvaccinated  than \nvaccinated people.  Vaccinated people with breakthrough COVID-19 cases are less likely to develop \nserious disease, be hospitalized, and die than those who are unvaccinated and get COVID-19.  Id. at \n61,565  n.120  (citing  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-\neffectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html).   Studies have shown that vaccinated people with breakthrough \ninfections  may be less infectious than unvaccinated individuals with primary infections,  resulting  in \nfewer opportunities for transmission.  Id. at 61,558 n.37 (citing, e.g., Marc M. Shamier, et al., Virological \nCharacteristics  of  SARS-CoV-2  Vaccine  Breakthrough  in  Health  Care  Workers  (Aug.  21,  2021), \nhttp://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.20.21262158).   \nIII.  The Social Security Act grants the Secretary the authority to protect the health and \nsafety of patients in facilities funded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \nCongress established the Medicare program “[a]s a means of providing health care to the aged \nand disabled.”  Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 404 (1993); see 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.  \nCongress also created the Medicaid program, which is a cooperative state and federal program to \n“furnish medical assistance”—i.e.,  health care—on behalf of individuals “whose income and resources \nare insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services[.]”  42 U.S.C. § 1396-1.   Both programs \nwere adopted in the 1965 amendments to the Social Security  Act.  Both are administered by the \nSecretary  of Health  and  Human  Services,  acting  through  the  Administrator  of the  Centers  for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).  Under both Medicare and Medicaid, health care services are \nprovided by private organizations and health care professionals who meet the statutory and regulatory \nrequirements for participation.  Participation in either Medicare or Medicaid is voluntary.   \nTo participate  in  the  Medicare  program and  receive  payment  for services  furnished  to \nMedicare  beneficiaries,  providers such  as hospitals,  home-health  agencies,  hospices,  and skilled \nnursing facilities must enter into a provider agreement with CMS after demonstrating that they meet \nthe conditions for participation.  42 U.S.C. § 1395cc.  Medicaid providers, likewise, voluntarily enter \ninto provider agreements with State Medicaid agencies to be eligible for participation in that program.  \n8 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 23 of 66 PageID #: 366\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(27).  By voluntarily  entering into a provider agreement, a facility agrees that it \nwill comply with the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and the regulations that the \nSecretary issues under these statutes.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2); see also id. § 1396a(p)(1).   \nThe Secretary has broad authority under the Social Security Act and, in particular, under the \nMedicare statute to issue such regulations “as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the \nfunctions with which” he is charged under each statute.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(a); see also id. § 1395hh(a)(1).  \nIn particular, the Secretary is charged with issuing regulations as he deems necessary to—among other \nthings—ensure  that the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients are protected while these \nindividuals receive care that is funded by either program.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9) (defining a \n“hospital” as an institution  which “meets such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary in \nthe interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution”);  id. \n§ 1395i-3(d)(4)(B) (“A skilled nursing facility must meet such other requirements relating to the health, \nsafety, and well-being of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find \nnecessary.”).  These regulations are alternatively  known as “conditions of participation,” “conditions \nfor coverage,” or “requirements for participation.”   \nThe Secretary’s  long-standing  regulations  include  detailed requirements  governing, among \nother things, the qualifications of professional staff, the condition of facilities, and other requirements \nthat he deems necessary to protect patient health and safety.  In particular, Medicare and Medicaid \nproviders and suppliers  have long been required  to maintain  effective  “infection  prevention  and \ncontrol programs,” to “provide a safe, sanitary, and comfortable environment and to help prevent the \ndevelopment and transmission of communicable diseases and infections.”  42 C.F.R. § 483.80 (long-\nterm care facilities);  see also, e.g., id. §§ 482.42(a) (hospitals); 416.51(b) (ambulatory surgical centers).   \nThe Medicare statute directs the Secretary to enter into agreements with the States under which \neach state health agency (or other appropriate state or local agency) agrees to conduct periodic surveys \nto determine whether providers meet Medicare’s conditions of participation.  42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a); \nsee also 42 C.F.R. § 488.10(a).  A State’s decision to enter into a state survey agreement is voluntary.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a) (authorizing agreements with “any State which is able and willing to do so”).  \n9 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 24 of 66 PageID #: 367\nIf the State enters into such an agreement, however, it obliges itself to conduct surveys to “assess \ncompliance with Federal health,  safety and quality  standards,” 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(1),  using “the \nsurvey methods, procedures, and forms that are prescribed by CMS,” id. § 488.26(d).  If a provider is \naccredited by a national accrediting organization’s CMS-approved accreditation program, CMS may \ndeem that provider to have met the applicable Medicare conditions of participation.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395bb(a); 42 C.F.R. §§ 488.4, 488.10(b).  In such a case, however, the Medicare statute authorizes \nCMS to rely  on state  health  agencies  (or other  appropriate state  or local agencies)  to conduct \n“validation  surveys”  of  an  accredited  provider  to  “validate”  the  accrediting  organization’s \ndetermination.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(c); 42 C.F.R. § 488.10(c).  These surveys are conducted on a \n“representative  sample” basis or “in response to substantial  allegations”  of deficiencies  that would \nadversely affect the health and safety of patients (in which case they are often referred to as “complaint \nsurveys”).  42 C.F.R. § 488.9(a); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(c).   If such a validation or complaint survey \nreveals significant  deficiencies  on the part of a provider, that provider will no longer be deemed to \nmeet the conditions of participation and will be subject to ongoing review by the state survey agency \nuntil  the  provider demonstrates  compliance.   See 42 U.S.C. §  1395bb(c); 42 C.F.R.  §§ 488.9(c), \n488.10(d).2 \nAfter completing a survey, the State survey agency provides its certification  of substantial \ncompliance or noncompliance, which is a recommendation to CMS.  See 42 C.F.R. § 488.12.  CMS has \nsole authority to determine noncompliance and impose remedies on Medicare providers.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395i-3(h)(2).  If a provider fails to comply with conditions of participation, CMS may, upon notice, \nterminate the provider’s participation in the Medicare program, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2); 42 C.F.R. \n                                              \n2  Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ assertion, Br. at 29-30, a state survey agency’s failure to review for \nprovider compliance does not “disqualify” providers in that state from program participation.   All \nMedicare and Medicaid certified facilities are assumed to be in compliance until a survey (which could \nbe performed by a CMS contractor, by an accreditation organization, or—if a State voluntarily takes \non this role—by a state survey agency) makes an initial finding of a violation.  Even then, the facility \nwould remain certified while CMS pursues a plan of correction with the agency.  See 42 C.F.R. § 488.11 \n(state survey agency functions do not include enforcement). \n10 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 25 of 66 PageID #: 368\n§ 489.53, or in certain circumstances,  impose other remedies, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395bbb(e),(f); 42 \nC.F.R. § 488.820 (additional remedies for home-health agencies). \nProviders have a vehicle for administrative  review of these remedies.  Specifically,  a facility \nmay appeal an “initial determination” by CMS, including a “finding of noncompliance leading to the \nimposition of enforcement actions” specified in the regulations.  42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(13).  The facility \nis entitled to a de novo hearing before an administrative  law judge (“ALJ”), at which it may present \nevidence and witnesses.   42 C.F.R. §§ 498.40-498.79.  A facility  that is dissatisfied  with an ALJ’s \ndetermination may appeal that decision to the Appellate Division of the Departmental Appeals Board \n(the “Board”).  42 C.F.R. § 498.80.   \nThe Board’s decision is the final decision of the Secretary.  See id.  § 498.90.  The Medicare \nstatute allows a provider to seek judicial review of the “final decision” of the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395cc(h)(1)(A)  (cross-referencing  42 U.S.C. § 405(g)).  As explained  by the Supreme Court in \nShalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 8 (2000), the Medicare statute makes this avenue \nof judicial  review exclusive.   The statute  provides that  “[n]o findings  of fact or decision  of the \n[Secretary]  shall  be reviewed by any  person,  tribunal,  or governmental  agency  except as  herein \nprovided.”  42 U.S.C. § 405(h) (incorporated into the Medicare statute by 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii).  And \nthe same provision further provides that “[n]o action against the United States, the [Secretary], or any \nofficer or employee thereof shall be brought under section 1331 or 1346 of Title 28 to recover on any \nclaim arising under [the Medicare Act].”  Id. \nIV.  The Secretary has acted in response to the pandemic, but recent developments have \nrevealed an urgent need for further action to protect the health of Medicare and \nMedicaid patients. \nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretary has taken numerous actions to \naddress the public health emergency.  Among other things, he issued a rule waiving certain regulatory \nrequirements requiring that medical encounters be held in person.  85 Fed. Reg. 19,230 (Apr. 6, 2020).  \nHe  also instituted  new data-reporting requirements  for certain  providers and implemented  new \nstatutory requirements that providers make public the prices for COVID-19 diagnostic tests.  See 85 \n11 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 26 of 66 PageID #: 369\nFed. Reg. 54,820 (Sept. 2, 2020); 85 Fed. Reg. 71,142-205 (Nov. 6, 2020).     \nIn May 2021, the Secretary exercised his authority to issue regulations for the protection of \nbeneficiaries’  health  and  safety  by  issuing  a  rule  that  established  enhanced  infection  control \nrequirements  for long-term care facilities  and other facilities.   86 Fed. Reg. 26,306 (May 13, 2021).  \nThis rule required, among other things, that the covered facilities offer COVID-19 vaccination  and \neducation about the vaccine to both residents and staff.  Id.   \nAs noted above, the emergence of the Delta variant over the summer months led to a dramatic \nspike in cases, hospitalizations,  and deaths caused by COVID-19, a resurgence that has been driven \nby the spread of infection among the unvaccinated population.  The Secretary’s initial policy approach, \nafter vaccines became available to the general population during the early months of 2021, was “to \nencourage rather than mandate vaccination.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  It appeared at the time that “a \ncombination  of other  Federal  actions,  a  variety  of public  education  campaigns,  and  State  and \nemployer-based efforts would be adequate.”  Id.  Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case—\n“vaccine uptake among health care staff has not been as robust as hoped for and ha[s] been insufficient \nto protect the health and safety of individuals receiving health care services” from covered providers.  \nId.  Vaccination rates among health care workers average 67%, 64%, or 60% for long-term care facility \nstaff, hospital staff, and end-stage renal disease facility staff, respectively.  Id. at 61,599.  In September \n2021, the President announced his COVID-19 Action Plan, which announced a series of regulatory \nactions that federal agencies were planning to undertake in response to the pandemic.  As relevant \nhere, the announcement  described CMS’s plans to require vaccinations  for health  care workers at \nMedicare- and Medicaid-participating  facilities.   The  White  House,  Path  Out  of the  Pandemic, \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan (last visited Nov. 19, 2021). \nV.  The Secretary issued the vaccination rule to protect the health and safety of Medicare \nand Medicaid patients from the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in health care \nfacilities.   \nOn November 5, 2021, CMS issued the  interim final rule that is the subject  of this  case.  \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs; Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. \n12 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 27 of 66 PageID #: 370\n61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021).  The  rule is comprehensive  and detailed,  discussing  in 72 pages its  new \nrequirements  for Medicare and Medicaid suppliers and providers.  It requires various categories of \nproviders and suppliers that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including hospitals, \nlong-term care facilities,  and end-stage renal dialysis facilities,  to develop and implement plans and \npolicies to “ensure staff are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, unless  exempt, because vaccination  of \nstaff is necessary for the health and safety of individuals to whom care and services are furnished.”  \nId. at 61,561.  Specifically,  vaccination  and accompanying documentation are required for any non-\nexempt staff that  “interact  with other staff, patients,  residents,  clients,  or [elderly care] program \nparticipants in any location[.]”  Id. at 61,568, 61,570; see also id. at 61,570 (listing the types of facility \nstaff subject to the vaccination  requirement).   At the same time, facilities  must develop policies to \npermit their staff to request exemptions from the vaccination  requirement,  given that  staff  “who \ncannot be vaccinated  or tested because of an ADA disability,  medical condition, or sincerely  held \nreligious belief, practice, or observance may in some circumstances  be granted an exemption from \ntheir employer.”  Id. at 61,572.   \nThe rule establishes two implementation phases.  Phase 1 is effective 30 days after publication, \ni.e., December 6, 2021, and requires all relevant staff to have received the first dose of a two-dose \nCOVID-19 vaccine or a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, or to have requested or have been granted \nan exemption under the health care facility’s exemption policies.  Id. at 61,573.  In addition, Phase 1 \nrequires that facilities subject to the rule have developed and implemented policies and procedures to \nvaccinate staff by that date.  Id.  Phase 2 is effective 60 days after publication, i.e., January 4, 2022, and \nrequires that all non-exempt staff who are covered by the rule be vaccinated by that date.  Id.  The rule \nstates  that  CMS will issue  interpretive  guidelines  regarding assessment  of compliance with these \nrequirements,  and  provider and  suppliers  cited  for noncompliance  may  be  subject  to  certain \nenforcement remedies depending “on the level of noncompliance and the remedies available under \nFederal law.”  Id. at 61,574. \nThe Secretary also concluded in the rule that there was good cause to waive the notice and \ncomment process in rulemaking.  He explained in detail how “current levels of COVID-19 vaccination \n13 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 28 of 66 PageID #: 371\ncoverage up until  now have  been  inadequate  to protect  health  care  consumers  and staff,”  and \ndemonstrated a “pressing need for a consistent  Federal policy mandating staff vaccination in health \ncare settings that receive Medicare and Medicaid funds.”  Id. at 61,583-84.  In particular, the Secretary \nreasoned that there was a pressing need for action in light of the coming winter influenza  season, \nwhich he noted could be particularly intense  and could lead to a dramatic increase in both influenza \nand COVID-19 cases among vulnerable populations, including Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.  \nId. at 61,584. These findings demonstrated to the Secretary that “a vaccine mandate for healthcare \nworkers is an essential  component of the nation’s COVID-19 response, the delay of which would \ncontribute to additional negative health outcomes for patients including loss of life.”  Id. (emphasis added).  \nThus, CMS concluded “it would endanger the health  and safety of patients, and be contrary to the \npublic interest  to delay” issuance  of a vaccine  requirement  for staff in healthcare  settings.   Id. at \n61,586.  \nVI.  This litigation is brought. \nThe  Plaintiff  States  challenge  the  rule,  asserting  claims  purportedly arising  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the Social Security Act, and Article I and the Tenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution.  Compl. ¶¶ 166-257.  The Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on November \n10, 2021.  See Compl.  On November 12, 2021, the Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  See Pl. \nStates’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 9 (“Br.”). \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n “A preliminary injunction  is an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that should “never be \nawarded as of right.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008) (citation omitted).  A plaintiff is \nentitled to such an “extraordinary remedy” only “upon a clear showing” that it is “entitled to such \nrelief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  To establish  such entitlement,  a \nplaintiff  must demonstrate  that  (1) it is likely  to succeed  on the  merits;  (2) it is  likely  to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in its favor; and \n(4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Id. at 20.  “No single factor is dispositive,” but the “likelihood \nof success on the merits is the most significant.”  Turtle Island Foods, SPC v. Thompson, 992 F.3d 694, \n14 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 29 of 66 PageID #: 372\n699 (8th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted).  When the government is the opposing party, the last two factors \nmerge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIMS BECAUSE \nTHE MEDICARE STATUTE’S CHANNELING PROVISION DEPRIVES THIS \nCOURT OF JURISDICTION OVER SUCH CLAIMS. \nThe Plaintiffs  dispute the validity of the vaccination rule, and argue that health care facilities \nin their States should not be subject  to any sanction,  in the form of loss of Medicare funding or \neligibility  for participation  in the Medicare program, for a violation  of the rule.  This Court lacks \njurisdiction  over these  claims.  Any  claim arising  under the Medicare statute  must be channeled \nthrough that statute’s  exclusive channeling  provisions, no matter whether the Plaintiffs  attempt to \nbring their claim as a pre-enforcement challenge, or whether they bring a constitutional  challenge.  \nThe Medicare statute  “channels  most, if not all, Medicare claims through [a] special review \nsystem.”  Illinois Council,  529 U.S. at 8; see also Degnan v. Burwell, 765 F.3d 805, 808 (8th Cir. 2014).  \nUnder 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h)(1),  for example, a provider dissatisfied with the agency’s decision to \nterminate its Medicare agreement is entitled to “a hearing thereon by the Secretary” and to “judicial \nreview of the Secretary’s  final decision” as is provided in 42 U.S.C. § 405(g).  Congress made this \navenue of judicial review exclusive.  The statute provides that “[n]o findings of fact or decision of the \n[Secretary]  shall  be reviewed by any  person,  tribunal,  or governmental  agency  except as  herein \nprovided.”  42 U.S.C. § 405(h) (made applicable to the Medicare statute by 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii).  And \nthe same provision also forecloses any alternative  bases for jurisdiction,  such  as federal-question \njurisdiction, over any claim “arising under” the Medicare statute.  Id.; see also Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at \n10; Smith v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1765, 1772 (2019) (“Congress made clear that review would be available \nonly ‘as herein provided’—that is, only under the terms of § 405(g).”).3 \n                                              \n3  In addition to asserting federal-question jurisdiction  under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, the Plaintiffs \nalso invoke the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361. \nBut “the federal Declaratory Judgment Act . . .  is a procedural statute, not a jurisdictional  statute.”  \nMcGowen,  Hurst, Clark & Smith, P.C. v. Com. Bank,  11 F.4th  702, 708 n.2 (8th  Cir. 2021).  And \nmandamus is only available to order “a precise, definite act about which an official ha[s] no discretion \n15 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 30 of 66 PageID #: 373\nIn Illinois Council, the Supreme Court concluded that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over \nconstitutional,  statutory, and procedural claims brought by an association of nursing home operators, \nwhich had  asserted that  pre-enforcement  review was needed of the facial  validity  of a Medicare \nregulation  governing termination  procedures for nursing  homes found to be in violation  of their \nconditions of participation.   The Court made inescapably clear that claims involving the Medicare \nprogram may not be brought in federal court before a party first presents its claim to the agency.  The \nCourt held that “the bar of § 405(h) reaches beyond ordinary administrative law principles of ‘ripeness’ \nand ‘exhaustion  of administrative  remedies,’” which are subject to well-established  exceptions, and \ninstead “demands the ‘channeling’  of virtually all legal attacks through the agency.”  529 U.S. at 12–\n13.  As the Court explained, this stringent  requirement  “assures the agency greater opportunity to \napply, interpret, or revise policies, regulations, or statutes without possibly premature interference by \ndifferent individual courts applying ‘ripeness’ and ‘exhaustion’  exceptions case by case.”  Id. at 13. \nThe Supreme Court recognized  that “this  assurance  comes at a price, namely,  occasional \nindividual, delay-related hardship.”  Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 13.  But, the Court explained, \nIn the context of a massive, complex health and safety program such as Medicare, \nembodied in hundreds of pages of statutes and thousands of pages of often interrelated \nregulations, any of which may become the subject of a legal challenge in any of several \ndifferent courts, paying this price may seem justified. \nId.  At least, “such was the judgment of Congress.”  Id.; see also Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 627 \n(1984). \nIllinois Council emphasized the broad reach of the channeling requirement.  The Supreme Court \nexplained that its decisions “foreclose distinctions  based upon the ‘potential future’ versus the ‘actual \npresent’ nature of the claim, the ‘general legal’ versus the ‘fact-specific’ nature of the challenge,  the \n‘collateral’ versus ‘non-collateral’ nature of the issues, or the ‘declaratory’ versus ‘injunctive’  nature of \n                                              \nwhatever.”  Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 63 (2004) (cleaned up); see also Family Rehab., \nInc. v. Azar, 886 F.3d 496, 505–06 (5th Cir. 2018).  “The duty owed to the plaintiff must be ministerial \nand a positive command so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt.”  Mitchael v. Colvin, 809 F.3d \n1050, 1054 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation omitted).  The Plaintiffs here seek to invalidate a federal \nregulation, not to compel the performance of a ministerial duty. \n16 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 31 of 66 PageID #: 374\nthe relief sought.”  529 U.S. at 13–14.  The Court also explained that the channeling  requirement is \nnot limited to particular types of relief.  “Claims for money, claims for other benefits, claims of program \neligibility,  and claims  that contest a sanction  or remedy,” the  Court noted, “may all  similarly  rest  upon \nindividual fact-related circumstances,  may all similarly dispute agency policy determinations,  or may \nall similarly involve the application, interpretation,  or constitutionality  of interrelated regulations or \nstatutory provisions.”  Id. at 14 (emphasis added).  The Court found “no reason to distinguish among \nthem in terms of the language or in terms of the purposes of § 405(h).”  Id.; see also In re Bayou Shores \nSNF, LLC, 828 F.3d 1297, 1329 (11th Cir. 2016) (dismissing claim by skilled nursing facility for pre-\nenforcement review of termination of provider agreement). \nThe Plaintiffs’  claims are subject to the jurisdiction-channeling  provision of § 405(h),  and \nfederal-question jurisdiction is barred, if they arise under the Medicare statute, even if they may also \nrise under the Constitution or under other statutes such as the Administrative Procedure Act.  A claim \n“arises  under”  the  Medicare  statute  if  “both  the  standing  and  the  substantive  basis  for  the \npresentation” of the claim is the statute, or if it is “inextricably intertwined with a claim for benefits.”  \nRinger, 466 U.S. at 614-15; see also Clarinda Home Health v. Shalala, 100 F.3d 526, 529 (8th Cir. 1996).  \nThe “arising under” inquiry looks to the claim’s “essence,” and “not whether [the claim] lends itself \nto a ‘substantive’ rather than a ‘procedural’ label.”  Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614-15, 624.  Accordingly, the \nSupreme Court has stated that this rule applies not only to “a claim for future benefits,” but also to \n“all aspects” of any such present or future claim, including requests  for injunctive  and declaratory \nrelief.  See Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 12-14 (quoting Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614-15).   \nUnder this standard, all the claims at issue here plainly “arise under” the Medicare statute.  The \nPlaintiffs, acting purportedly on behalf of several state-run health care facilities and as parens patriae for \nprivately-run health  care facilities  within their borders, challenge  the Secretary’s  statutory authority \nunder the Medicare statute to issue the rule governing standards for COVID-19 vaccinations.   They \nseek pre-enforcement review to challenge  the Secretary’s authority to impose the Medicare statute’s \nremedies of civil monetary penalties, withholding of payments, or termination on facilities that violate \nthe rule.  The standing and substantive  basis for these claims arise under the Medicare statute,  and \n17 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 32 of 66 PageID #: 375\nthey are inextricably intertwined with facilities’ claims that they should continue to receive the benefit \nof eligibility to participate in the Medicare program, without sanction, even if they do not comply with \nthe vaccination rule.  See Blue Valley Hosp. v. Azar, 919 F.3d 1278, 1283 (10th Cir. 2019).4   \nIt does not matter that the Plaintiffs also allege various constitutional  violations; the Medicare \nstatute’s channeling  requirement applies equally to constitutional  as well as nonconstitutional  claims.  \nSee Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 10 (“The statute plainly bars § 1331 review … irrespective of whether \nthe  individual  challenges  the  agency’s  denial  [of a benefit]  on evidentiary,  rule-related,  statutory, \nconstitutional,  or other legal grounds.”); id. at 12 (stressing  that “‘all aspects’ of any such present or \nfuture claim must be ‘channeled’ through the administrative process”).  See also Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 \nU.S. 749, 760–62 (1975).   \nThe Supreme Court has recognized a narrow exception to § 405(h)’s jurisdictional  bar; the \nCourt presumes  that  Congress  did not intend  to preclude  review when  the  application  of the \nchanneling  requirement “would not simply channel  review through the agency, but would mean no \nreview at all.”  Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 19.5   But Plaintiffs may not invoke this exception simply by \nalleging that financial hardship forecloses further review.  See id. at 22; see also Sw. Pharmacy Sols., Inc. v. \nCMS, 718 F.3d 436, 441 (5th Cir. 2013) (“The fact that a plaintiff would suffer great hardship if forced \nto proceed through administrative channels  before obtaining judicial review is insufficient  to warrant \napplication of the Illinois Council exception.”).  “[T]he ‘channeling’  of virtually all legal attacks through \nthe agency . . . comes at a price, namely, occasionally individual, delay-related hardship,” but Congress \n                                              \n4  The conditions of participation regulations are common Medicare and Medicaid regulations, \nwhich are enforced through a unitary enforcement scheme that determines eligibility  and penalties \nunder both programs.  Because  this system requires  review of these  determinations  “through the \nMedicare administrative appeals procedure,” the channeling  requirement of § 405(h) applies fully to \nchallenges  to these regulations.  Cathedral Rock of N. Coll. Hill, Inc. v. Shalala, 223 F.3d 354, 366 (6th \nCir. 2000); see also In re Bayou Shores SNF, LLC, 828 F.3d 1297, 1330 (11th Cir. 2016); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396i(b)(2). \n5  A second narrow exception applies where a plaintiff has presented its claim to the agency, \nand either the agency or the court finds adequate grounds to excuse further exhaustion of that claim.  \nSee Degnan, 765 F.3d at 808-09.  But even where exhaustion might be excused, the presentment of a \nclaim to the agency is a non-waivable jurisdictional requirement under § 405(h).  See Illinois Council, 529 \nU.S. at 15.  No party has yet presented a claim to the agency to contest an enforcement action, and so \nthis exception cannot apply here.  \n18 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 33 of 66 PageID #: 376\nnonetheless  deemed that price “justified” when it enacted the Medicare statute.   Illinois  Council, 529 \nU.S. at 13.  The question instead is “whether, as applied generally . . . hardship likely found in many \ncases  turns what appears to be simply a channeling  requirement  into  complete preclusion  of judicial \nreview.”  Id. at 22-23 (emphasis added); see also Sensory Neurostimulation, Inc. v. Azar, 977 F.3d 969, 983–\n84 (9th Cir. 2020); Blue Valley Hosp., 919 F.3d at 1287–88.   \nThe application of § 405(h) here would not result  in the “complete preclusion” of judicial \nreview of the Secretary’s vaccination rule.  Any provider or supplier that violates the rule and is subject \nto an enforcement action could exhaust its remedies before the agency and then proceed to federal \ncourt.  42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h).   Alternatively,  such  a facility,  upon receiving  notice  of a potential \nsanction and after filing an appeal before an ALJ, “shall have expedited access to judicial review” that \nwill permit the facility  to proceed directly to federal court to challenge  the legality of the rule.  Id. \n§ 1395cc(h)(1)(B).   Far from a “complete preclusion” of review, the Medicare statute sets forth an \norderly procedure for parties to contest the legality  of sanctions  that the Secretary would seek to \nimpose on them.  See Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 19.    \nIt is true, of course, that State governments are not “dissatisfied” “institution[s]  or agenc[ies]” \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h)(1),  and thus the States themselves  could not use that \nstatute’s  vehicle  for judicial  review, although individual state-operated facilities  could do so if they \nfaced a sanction.  But the same point was true of the association that was the plaintiff in Illinois Council, \nand the Supreme Court held that that was immaterial.   It is the “rights to review” of health  care \nfacilities  subject to the vaccination  rule “that are at stake,” and “the statutes  that create the special \nreview channel  adequately  protect those  rights.”   529 U.S. at 24.  Health  care facilities  that  are \naggrieved by the enforcement of the vaccination rule may seek review of that rule after following the \njurisdictional  requirements of § 405(h).  State governments, however, may not skip the jurisdictional \nrequirements to litigate on their behalf.6   \n                                              \n6  At all events, the Plaintiffs’  claims against President Biden must be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction,  because  the  courts  have  “no  jurisdiction  of  a bill  to  enjoin  the  President  in  the \nperformance of his official duties.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992). \n19 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 34 of 66 PageID #: 377\nII.  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR \nCLAIMS. \nA.  CMS has statutory authority for the rule. \nAs noted above, the Secretary has broad authority under the Social Security Act to issue such \nregulations “as may be necessary  to the efficient administration  of the functions with which” he is \ncharged under the Act.  42 U.S.C. § 1302(a).  The Medicare statute further confirms this authority by \ndirecting  the  Secretary  to  “prescribe  such  regulations  as  may  be  necessary  to  carry  out  the \nadministration of the insurance programs under” that statute.  Id. § 1395hh(a)(1).  Binding Supreme \nCourt and Eighth Circuit case law confirms the extent of the Secretary’s authority under these statutes.  \nAddressing similar enabling language in other statutes,  the Supreme Court has concluded that this \nlanguage grants the agency “broad authority.”  Mourning v. Family Publ’ns Serv., Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 365 \n(1973) (quotation marks omitted).  More specifically, “[w]here the empowering provision of a statute \nstates simply that the agency may ‘make . . . such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry \nout the  provisions  of this  Act,’”  the  Court held  that  “the  validity  of a regulation  promulgated \nthereunder  will be sustained  so long as it is  ‘reasonably  related to the  purposes of the enabling \nlegislation.’”  Id. at 369 (quoting Thorpe v. Hous. Auth. of City of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 280-81 (1969)).   \nApplying this standard, the Supreme Court has recognized that § 1302(a) confers “broad rule-\nmaking powers . . . in substantially  the same language” as the rulemaking provision in the cases cited \nabove.  Thorpe, 393 U.S. at 277 n.28; see also Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S. 132, 140 n.8 (1982) (same).  Because \nthe rulemaking provision of the Social Security Act, § 1302(a), contains essentially  the same terms as \nwere at issue in Mourning and Thorpe, the Eighth Circuit applies the same “reasonably related” standard \nin reviewing an attack on the Secretary’s authority to promulgate regulations under § 1302(a).  See Ark. \nPharmacists Ass’n v. Harris, 627 F.2d 867, 870 (8th Cir. 1980); Leimbach v. Califano, 596 F.2d 300, 304 \n(8th Cir. 1979); see also Ark. State Bank Comm’r v. Resol. Tr. Corp., 911 F.2d 161, 170 (8th Cir. 1990). \nThe  vaccination  rule  is comfortably within  the  Secretary’s  statutory  authority  under  this \nstandard.  As noted above, Congress created both the Medicare and Medicaid programs as a means to \nprovide health  care to the populations covered under each program.  See Good Samaritan Hosp., 508 \n20 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 35 of 66 PageID #: 378\nU.S. at 404; see also 42 U.S.C. § 1396-1.  The purpose of providing health  care services  to these \npopulations, of course, is to advance and maintain patients’ health, not to harm them.  It is therefore \nunsurprising that Congress has taken care to instruct the Secretary to administer these programs in a \nway that ensures that the health and safety of patients are protected.  Throughout the Medicare statute, \nCongress has charged the Secretary to use the various tools at his disposal to ensure that health care \nproviders do not cause harm to their patients.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a) (instructing  the Secretary \nto impose any conditions on facilities found to be noncompliant that he “finds necessary in the interest \nof health and safety of individuals who are furnished care or services” at the facility); id. § 1396a(a)(36) \n(same); id. § 1395bb(c) (instructing  the Secretary to deem facilities  ineligible for participation if they \nare found to be in violation of health and safety regulations); id. § 1395bbb(b) (imposing duty on the \nSecretary to assure “the enforcement of such conditions and requirements are adequate to protect the \nhealth and safety of individuals under the care of a home health agency”). \nOf particular relevance  here, numerous provisions throughout the Medicare and Medicaid \nstatutes charge the Secretary with the responsibility to issue regulations, as he deems necessary,  that \ncondition health care facilities’ eligibility for the Medicare and Medicaid programs on those facilities’ \nability to protect the health and safety of their patients while those patients are receiving care that is \nfunded by either program.

U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 14 F.4th 856, 870 (8th Cir. 2021) (discussing \n§ 1395i-3(f)(1)).  The statutes thus accord the Secretary the authority, and the responsibility, to impose \nconditions  of participation  on health  care facilities  so as to protect patients’  health  and safety—a \nresponsibility that has taken on paramount importance since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nThe Secretary, at least, reasonably understood his authority to encompass this responsibility,  and that \nunderstanding is entitled to deference from this Court.  See id.   \n The Plaintiffs  do not dispute that  a rule requiring  the vaccination  of health  care facility \nemployees protects the “health and safety” of those facilities’  patients, as those words are ordinarily \nunderstood.  Instead, they invoke the doctrine of noscitur a sociis to contend that, given the detail with \nwhich Congress addressed other standards in these statutes, the statutes’ failure to expressly address \nvaccinations  means that Congress intended to deny the Secretary the authority to find vaccination \nrequirements to be necessary to protect the health and safety of patients.

United States, 261 U.S. 514, 520 (1923)).  Here, \nwhere the words “health” and “safety” have “a character of [their] own” that plainly encompasses the \navoidance of a deadly disease, the canon has no application.  Russell Motor Car Co., 261 U.S. at 519.  \nAnd, in any event, this canon “is a feeble helper in an administrative setting, particularly when, as here, \n[the Plaintiffs]  point[] to no evidence suggesting that Congress considered the unnamed possibility \nand meant to say no to it.”  Northport Health, 14 F.4th at 871 (citations and internal quotations omitted).   \nFor this reason, the Plaintiffs’  reliance on Alabama Association of Realtors v. Department of Health \n& Human Services, 141 S. Ct. 2485 (2021), is misplaced.  The Supreme Court in that case rejected the \nissuance of a national eviction moratorium by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under \na far different provision of the Public Health Service Act, reasoning that a “downstream connection \nbetween eviction and the interstate spread of disease is markedly different from the direct targeting of \ndisease that characterizes the measures identified in [that] statute.”  Id. at 2488.  The Secretary here is \nnot seeking to regulate the “downstream” effects of the pandemic.  Rather, the statutes directly instruct \nhim to protect the health and safety of beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while \nthose  individuals  are  receiving  care that  is  paid for by either  program.  Because  the  Secretary \ndetermined that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 poses a unique threat to patients’ health and safety in \nthese settings,  he discharged his statutory responsibility  by issuing  his vaccination  rule.  See generally \nMerck & Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 962 F.3d 531, 537-38 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (distinguishing, \nfor purposes of Sections 1302 and 1395hh, between an invalid rule with only “a hoped-for trickle-\ndown effect on the regulated programs” and a valid rule that has “an actual and discernible nexus \nbetween the rule and the conduct or management of Medicare and Medicaid programs”).8  \nFinally, the Plaintiffs contend that the rule violates 42 U.S.C. § 1395, in that the Secretary has \n                                              \n8  The Plaintiffs also attempt to invoke the nondelegation doctrine to contend that Congress \ncould not lawfully delegate to the Secretary the authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare \nand Medicaid patients.  Br. at 27.  As the Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge, a “statutory delegation is \nconstitutional  as long as Congress lays down by legislative  act an intelligible  principle to which the \nperson or body authorized to exercise the delegated authority is directed to conform.”  Bhatti v. Fed. \nHous. Fin. Agency, 15 F.4th 848, 854 (8th Cir. 2021) (internal quotations and alterations omitted).  The \nSecretary’s statutory authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients easily \nmeets this minimal standard.   \n23 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 38 of 66 PageID #: 381\npurportedly asserted control over the selection of health care facility employees or the administration \nof health  care institutions.   This assertion  misconstrues  the nature of the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, and of the vaccination rule.  Health care facilities  “voluntarily participate in the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs,” and if they choose to do so, they “must comply with the [Secretary’s health \nand safety regulations] as the price of admission to obtain federal funding.”  Northport Health, 14 F.4th \nat 869 n.5.  Those conditions  on federal funding have long included detailed rules addressing the \nqualifications  of employees at health care facilities.  See, e.g., 42 C.FR. § 482.22 (standards for medical \nstaff at  hospitals).   The  Secretary’s  vaccination  rule,  like  these  other rules  addressing  employee \nqualifications, ensures that federal funds are used only to pay for the purposes that Congress intended.  \nBecause the vaccination rule is not a legal mandate, but instead a condition imposed on the payment \nof federal funds, the rule does not assert “control” over the administration of institutions.   See Goodman \nv. Sullivan, 891 F.2d 449, 451 (2d Cir. 1989) (“The regulation does not actually direct or prohibit any \nkind of treatment or diagnosis.  It only refuses subsequent Medicare reimbursement for certain kinds \nof services.”); see also Am. Acad. of Ophthalmology, Inc. v. Sullivan, 998 F.2d 377, 387 (6th Cir. 1993).    \nB.  The rule is the product of reasoned decisionmaking. \nThe Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary acted arbitrarily by issuing a rule to protect the health \nand safety of Medicare and Medicaid patients.  This Court reviews this claim under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), \nwhich  provides  that  the  Secretary’s  findings,  “if  supported  by  substantial  evidence,  shall  be \nconclusive.”   Even if this  statute  incorporates  the  Administrative  Procedure Act’s  standard  for \narbitrary-and-capricious review, but see Estate of Morris v. Shalala, 207 F.3d 744, 745 (5th Cir. 2000), that \nstandard is easily met here. \nThe APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard “is a highly  deferential  standard of review.”  \nAdventist Health Sys./SunBelt, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., — F.4th —, No. 21-1589, 2021 \nWL 5170810, at *7 (8th Cir. Nov. 8, 2021).  The courts “defer to agency action so long as an agency \nexamined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action.”  Id. (citation and \nalterations omitted).  “A court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Id. (citation and \nalterations omitted).  “This is particularly true when the resolution of the dispute involves primarily \n24 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 39 of 66 PageID #: 382\nissues of fact and analysis of the relevant information requires a high level of technical expertise by an \nagency acting within its sphere of expertise.”  Id. (citation  and alterations  omitted).  In short, the \narbitrary-and-capricious standard simply “requires that agency action be reasonable and reasonably \nexplained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021). \nThe Secretary considered all the relevant factors, and reasonably explained his decision, when \nhe issued his rule to protect Medicare and Medicaid patients from the transmission  of a deadly virus \nat facilities funded by these programs.  The APA requires nothing more.   \nProtection of the Health and Safety of Medicare and Medicaid Patients.  As explained above, the Social \nSecurity Act assigns to the Secretary the primary responsibility  to protect the health and safety of \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries while those individuals are receiving care from facilities that are \nfunded by either program.  The Secretary reasonably considered the available evidence to conclude \nthat  his  vaccination  rule  would  protect  these  patients’  health  and  safety;  indeed,  the  record \noverwhelmingly points to this conclusion.   \nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is highly transmissible,  and extremely dangerous. 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,556-57.   By the time this rule was promulgated, it had caused the deaths of at least 720,000 \npeople in the United States, including at least 1,900 health care workers.  Id. at 61,556, 61,569.  It has \nhospitalized at least 3 million people.  Id. at 61,556.  In short, it is “the deadliest disease in American \nhistory.”  Id.  \nGiven the virulence of this virus, it is easily transmitted among health care workers, and from \nhealth care workers to patients,  in health  care facilities.   86 Fed. Reg at 61,557 n.16.  Unvaccinated \nhealth  care workers are highly  susceptible to transmitting  the virus to their colleagues and to their \npatients.  Id. at 61,558 n.42.  Patients in facilities funded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs are \nmore likely than the general population to suffer severe illness or death from COVID-19.  Id. at 61,609.  \nFor these reasons, the Secretary concluded, “the available evidence for ongoing healthcare-associated \nCOVID-19 transmission  risk is sufficiently  alarming in and of itself to compel CMS to take action.”  \nId. at 61,558. \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to the medical care that they need is jeopardized \n25 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 40 of 66 PageID #: 383\nby low rates of vaccination among health  care workers at facilities  funded by these programs.  Id.  \nPatients in these programs have refused care from unvaccinated staff, or have forgone care altogether, \nto avoid contracting SARS-CoV-2 from health care workers.  Id.  Absenteeism from health care staff \nas a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness has also contributed to staffing shortages \nthat disrupt patient access to recommended care.  Id. at 61,559.     \nThe effects have been compounded by the emergence this summer of the Delta variant.  Id.  \nIn  particular,  cases  among long-term care  facility  and end-stage  renal  disease  facility  staff  have \nincreased by over 1400 percent and 850 percent, respectively,  since the Delta variant emerged.  Id.  \nBetween June and September 2021, daily cases of COVID-19 increased  over 1200 percent,  new \nhospital admissions for patients with COVID-19 increased over 600 percent, and daily deaths from \nCOVID-19 increased over 800 percent.  Id. at 61,583.  The vast majority of cases during this time \nperiod were among the unvaccinated population.  Id.    \nWhat is more, the evidence points to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases over the next several \nweeks.  Id. at 61,584.  There was a large spike in cases during the winter of 2020, demonstrating that \nCOVID-19 follows seasonal  patterns  that are common for other respiratory virus infections.   Id.  \nThere is strong reason to fear that SARS-CoV-2 will be exceptionally virulent during this period, as a \nsevere 2021-2022 winter influenza  season is anticipated,  and the interaction  between SARS-CoV-2 \nand the influenza virus may lead to worse outcomes over the next several months.  Id. at 61,584  n.190.  \nThe  Secretary  accordingly  reasoned that  “it is  imperative  that  the  risk  for healthcare-associated \nCOVID-19 transmission be minimized during the influenza season.”  Id. at 61,584.        \nFortunately,  the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved or authorized for use in the \nUnited States are safe, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,562, and are highly effective in preventing serious outcomes \nof COVID-19, including hospitalization  and death, id. at 61,565 n.115.  These vaccines continue to \noffer strong protection against known variants of the virus, including  the Delta variant, particularly \nagainst hospitalization and death.  Id. at 61,565 n.116.   \nRecent  studies also show that the vaccines are highly  effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection among frontline workers.  Id. at 61,585 n.205.  Studies have shown that vaccinated people \n26 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 41 of 66 PageID #: 384\nwith breakthrough  infections  may be less  infectious  than  unvaccinated  individuals  with primary \ninfections, resulting in fewer opportunities for transmission.   Id. at 61,558 n.37.   \nIn short, as the Secretary recognized, the available scientific evidence overwhelmingly points \nto the conclusion  that the  virus that causes COVID-19 is extremely dangerous for Medicare and \nMedicaid patients,  and  that  vaccinations  of health  care  staff  are  highly  effective  in  preventing \ntransmission  among health  care  workers, and  from health  care workers to their  patients.   The \nSecretary, at minimum, reasonably reached this conclusion, and took action on that basis to fulfill his \nstatutory  responsibility  to protect  the  health  and safety  of program beneficiaries  while they  are \nreceiving care that these programs pay for.  The APA requires nothing more than that.  See Prometheus \nRadio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.       \nStaff Shortages in Health Care Facilities.  The Secretary also reasonably concluded that high rates \nof transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among health care staff have contributed to a shortage of health care \nworkers, and that his vaccination rule would alleviate this problem.  As noted above, many health care \nworkers have missed work due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and these absences have disrupted patient \naccess to care.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,559.  There have been at least 500,000 reported COVID-19 cases, \nand at least 1,900 reported COVID-19 deaths, among health care staff; and the true figures are likely \nmuch higher.  Id.  And the rate of infection among health care staff has increased dramatically with \nthe rise of the Delta variant.  Id.  These trends are driven by health care staff vaccination  rates that \nremain too low to protect staff and patients  from the  virus.  Id.  The Secretary  thus reasonably \nconcluded and fully explained that the rule would serve to alleviate personnel shortages at health care \nfacilities. Id. at 61,569-70. \nThe Plaintiffs protest that they predict that a substantial  portion of health care workers will \nchoose to leave their jobs rather than be vaccinated, thereby threatening  the operation of health care \nfacilities.   Br. at 16.  The Secretary considered this  possibility  and rejected it, after reviewing the \nempirical evidence that has developed in recent months with regard to the effect of government-\nimposed or privately-imposed vaccination requirements.   \nNumerous health systems and individual health care employers throughout the country have \n27 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 42 of 66 PageID #: 385\nimplemented  COVID-vaccine  requirements.   86 Fed  Reg. at  61,566.  These  policies  have  been \noverwhelmingly successful, even among health care workers who were previously hesitant  to obtain \nvaccination.  Id.  For example, after Houston Methodist implemented a vaccination requirement for \npractitioners  at its facilities,  it achieved  a 99% compliance rate with that  requirement  among its \nemployees and physicians.   Id. at 61,566 n.131 (citing  Todd Ackerman, Houston Methodist  Requires \nCOVID-19 Vaccine for Credentialed  Doctors (June  8, 2021), https://www.houstonmethodist.org/leading-\nmedicine-blog/articles/2021/jun/houston-methodist-requires-covid-19-vaccine-for-credentialed-doctors/).   \nNovant Health, similarly, achieved 98.6% compliance with its mandatory vaccination requirement for \nits staff.  Id. at 61,566 n.132 (citing Novant Health Update on Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination Program \nfor  Employees  (Sept.  21,  2021),  https://www.novanthealth.org/home/about-us/newsroom/press-\nreleases/newsid33987/2576/novant-health-update-on-mandatory-covid-19-vaccination-program-for-employees.aspx).  \nContrary to Plaintiffs’ claim that “CMS did not reference data on any past efforts to mandate COVID-\n19 vaccines in rural areas,” Br. at 18, Novant Health in fact operates numerous hospitals, physician \nclinics,  and urgent care centers,  including several in rural North Carolina.  See, e.g., Novant Health, \nUrgent Care Locations, https://www.novanthealth.org/home/patients--visitors/locations/urgent-care-\nlocations.aspx (last visited Nov. 20, 2021). \nThe State of New York also reported a 92% compliance rate with its vaccine requirement, for \nall 650,000 hospital and nursing home workers in that state, a figure which plainly accounts for the \nrural areas of New York as well.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569 n.159 (citing New York Times, Thousands of \nN.Y. Healthcare Workers Get Vaccinated Ahead of Deadline (Sept. 28, 2021)).  Additional operators of more \nthan 250 long-term care facilities around the country have achieved greater than 95%, and in some \ncases 100%, vaccination  rates after imposing their  own requirements.   Id. at 61,569 n.158 (citing \nEzekiel J. Emanuel and David J. Skorton, Mandating COVID-19 Vaccination for Health Care Workers, \nAnnals of Internal Medicine (Sept. 2021), http://doi.org/10.7326/M21-3150).   \nOn  the  basis  of this  evidence,  a  coalition  of  more than  fifty  professional  health  care \nassociations, including the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and the \nNational Association for Home Care and Hospice concluded that vaccination requirements are in the \n28 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 43 of 66 PageID #: 386\nbest interest  of their memberships, of patients,  and of health care facilities.   86 Fed. Reg. at 61,565.   \nA leading national  association  of long-term care providers also concluded that acceptance  of the \nvaccine would be high among the staff of its members’ facilities and urged the issuance of a rule that \nwould require vaccination.  Id.        \nThe Secretary recognized that there was some uncertainty  as to how many employees would \nleave their jobs as a result of a vaccination rule, but concluded that it was more likely that any such \neffect would be more than offset by reduced staff absenteeism from a reduction in illnesses,  as well as \na return to work of employees who have stayed out of the workforce for fear of contracting SARS-\nCoV-2.  Id. at 61,608.  These effects would be dwarfed, however, by the ordinary degree of churn in \nthe market of labor in the health care industry.  In any given year, it is typical for about 2.66 million \nemployees in health care settings to be new hires, in comparison to a total workforce of 10.4 million \nemployees.  Id.  Health care providers are accustomed to regularly finding and replacing employees, \nand there is no reason to believe that the need to find staffing will be noticeably more onerous as a \nresult  of the  vaccination  rule,  even  if  some  unvaccinated  health  care  workers leave  for other \nemployment and some vaccinated workers seek jobs in health care facilities.  Id.    \nIn sum, after reviewing the real-world evidence of the success of vaccination requirements to \ndate, the  Secretary  predicted that  his  rule  would “result  in  nearly  all  health  care workers being \nvaccinated.”  Id. at 61,569.  The Eighth Circuit has long held that “[j]udicial deference to agency action \nis ‘especially important’ when [an] agency’s judgments are ‘predictive.’”  Citizens Telecomms. Co. of Minn., \nLLC v. FCC, 901 F.3d 991, 1010 (8th Cir. 2018) (quoting Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, 153 F.3d 523, 547 \n(8th Cir. 1998)); see also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 521 (2009); Newspaper Ass’n of \nAm. v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 734 F.3d 1208, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“When, as here, an agency is making \n‘predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule,’ we are particularly loath to second-\nguess its analysis.”) (citation omitted). \nAsserted Reliance Interests.  The Plaintiffs also argue that the Secretary failed to take into account \nthe reliance interests of health care facilities and their workers.  Br. at 16.  To the contrary, as discussed \nabove, the Secretary directly took into account the costs that employers and some employees would \n29 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 44 of 66 PageID #: 387\nincur under the rule.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,607-10.  He concluded, however, that the benefits far \noutweighed the costs.  He calculated that any combination of 120 lives saved, or 600 hospitalizations \nprevented, would result in the benefits of the rule outweighing its costs.  Id. at 61,612.  The lives saved \nunder the rule will probably be “many times higher” than that threshold.  Id.  Although these estimates \nare subject to some uncertainty,  “total lives saved under this rule may well reach several hundred a \nmonth or perhaps several thousand a month.”  Id.   \nNothing in the APA required the Secretary to weigh any costs under the rule more heavily in \nthis analysis.  The Plaintiffs claim that they relied on the Secretary’s May 2021 rule, which had not yet \nrequired vaccinations  in health  care facilities,  in their  hiring  of “workforces without concern  for \nvaccination.”  Br. at 20.  But that rule expressly required education on COVID-19 vaccines and the \nprovision of vaccines in nursing homes, so it strains credulity to conclude that the rule encouraged \nemployers or employees to forgo vaccination.  That rule, moreover, was plainly described as just “one \nstep in the broad effort to support those individuals at higher risk,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 26,308 (emphasis \nadded), and the Secretary explained that comments submitted in response to that rule “will help inform \nfuture CMS actions.”  Id.  The Secretary did not, in his rule issued six months earlier, in any way \ndisclaim the  possibility  of additional  regulation  to protect the  health  and safety of Medicare and \nMedicaid patients from SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, as circumstances  developed.  And, when he \nissued  the  rule  at issue  in  this  case,  he  reasonably  explained  that,  although  he  had previously \nencouraged but did not require vaccinations,  the continued low rates of vaccination  uptake among \nhealth care workers and the concerns of the coming danger to Medicare and Medicaid patients in the \nwinter months had cause him to reconsider that policy.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583-84.   \nBut even assuming any reliance interests were at issue here, the Secretary “reasonably explained \nthe departure from CMS’s prior policy in spite of those reliance interests.”  Northport Health, 14 F.4th \nat  876.    “[A]n  agency  need  only  provide  a  reasoned  explanation  for  disregarding  facts  and \ncircumstances  that  underlay or were engendered by the prior policy,” id. (citation  and alterations \nomitted), a standard that was easily met here.  \nFederalism Concerns.

Br. at 20-21.  In fact, he specifically  acknowledged that he \nneeded to consider  federalism concerns  under  Executive  Order 13132,  86 Fed.  Reg. at 61,613, \nrecognized that his rule “would pre-empt some State laws that prohibit employers from requiring their \nemployees to be vaccinated for COVID-19,” id., and determined that it was still necessary to establish \nthe rule as the “minimum regulatory action necessary to achieve the objectives of the statute.”  Id.  He \ndetermined that the “contagion rates of the existing strains of coronavirus and their disproportionate \nimpacts on Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries,” necessitated that a vaccine mandate be imposed so \nas “to promote and protect patient health and safety.”  Id.  That was more than sufficient consideration \nof the federalism concerns.  The Plaintiffs’  position that protecting the public health and mandatory \nvaccinations  “‘do not ordinarily concern  the national  government,’”  Br. at 20 (quoting  Jacobson  v. \nMassachusetts,  197 U.S. 11, 38 (1905)), ignores the Secretary’s responsibility  to ensure the health and \nsafety of Medicare and Medicaid patients while they are receiving care at facilities  funded by those \nprograms.    \nThe Risk of Reinfection  in Previously Infected Individuals.  The Plaintiffs next fault the Secretary for \nhis purported failure to consider whether to exempt individuals who were previously infected with the \nCOVID-19 virus from the scope of his rule.  Br. at 21.  They cite a study of patients in Israel, which \nreported a finding of high levels of immunity for previously-infected individuals.  Id.  Contrary to their \nclaims, the Secretary directly considered the issue of “natural immunity” in general, and their cited \nstudy  in  particular,  but  he concluded  that  the  weight  of the  scientific  evidence  pointed against \nexempting individuals with prior infections. \nThe  Secretary  concluded  that  infection-induced  immunity  is  not  equivalent  to receiving \nvaccination  for COVID-19, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,559, and that, even among those persons with prior \nSARS-CoV-2 infections,  vaccination  provides strong protection against  reinfection.   Id. at 61,585 \nn.205.  Among persons previously infected with the virus, people who remain unvaccinated after that \ninfection are more than twice as likely to be reinfected, as compared to fully vaccinated people.  See \nCavanaugh, et al., 70 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report at 1081.  The Secretary accordingly \nfollowed the recommendations of CDC, which has found that the best academic evidence supports \n31 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 46 of 66 PageID #: 389\nthe benefits of vaccination for all people, regardless of their infection history.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560.   \nIn particular, CDC found on the basis of a comprehensive review of the academic literature \nthat,  among previously  infected  individuals,  “[n]umerous  immunologic  studies  have  consistently \nshown that vaccination of individuals who were previously infected enhances their immune response, \nand growing epidemiologic evidence indicates that vaccination following infection further reduces the \nrisk of subsequent  infection,  including  in the  setting  of increased  circulation  of more infectious \nvariants.”  Id. at 61,560 n.70 (citing CDC, Interim Clinical Considerations  for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines \nCurrently Approved or Authorized in the United States, https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-\nconsiderations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#CoV-19-vaccination).    \nIn reaching this conclusion, CDC engaged in a comprehensive review of studies on the subject, \nincluding the Israeli study cited by the Plaintiffs  as well as a more recent analysis  that critiqued the \nmethodology of that study; the later analysis found that the Israeli study had only considered short-\nterm effects of infection,  and that  over a longer period, “there  was a 5.5 times  higher  odds of \nlaboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among previously infected patients  than  among fully vaccinated \npatients.”  Science Brief: SARS-CoV-2 Infection-induced  and Vaccine-induced  Immunity (citing Catherine H. \nBozio, et al., Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 Among Adults Hospitalized with COVID-19–Like Illness with \nInfection-Induced or mRNA Vaccine-Induced SARS-CoV-2 Immunity — Nine States, January–September 2021, \n70  Morbidity  and  Mortality  Weekly  Report  1539  (Oct.  29,  2021), \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/vaccine-induced-immunity.html) \n(linked to in Interim Clinical Considerations  for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines Currently Approved or Authorized \nin the United States, cited at 86 Fed. Reg. 61,560 n.70, and accessible by clicking hyperlinked “studies” \nunder “COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection: People with prior or current SARS-CoV-\n2 infection”).  \nBecause the overall weight of the scientific evidence pointed in favor of increased benefits of \nvaccinations  of previously  infected  individuals,  the  Secretary  reasonably  chose  not  to create  an \nexemption for these persons.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614.  That easily  satisfies  the standards of APA \nreview.    In  reviewing  agency  action,  it  “is  generally  not  for the  judicial  branch  to  undertake \n32 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 47 of 66 PageID #: 390\ncomparative evaluations of conflicting scientific evidence.”  Bellion Spirits, LLC v. United States, 335 F. \nSupp. 3d 32, 42 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’'d, 7 F.4th 1201 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (citation omitted).  Moreover, the \nSecretary reasoned, an exemption would have raised complex issues of administrability, including, but \nnot limited to, developing a methodology to evaluate the declining levels of antibodies over time in \npreviously  infected  persons.    86 Fed.  Reg.  at  61,614.    The  Secretary  reasonably  declined  that \nundertaking.     \nAllegedly Post-Hoc Reasoning.  Nor can the Plaintiffs succeed on their claim that the vaccination \nrule amounts to a “post hoc rationalization.”  Br. at 22.  In reviewing agency action, “a court is ordinarily \nlimited to evaluating the agency’s contemporaneous explanation in light of the existing administrative \nrecord.”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2573 (2019).  The Secretary provided a \ncomprehensive statement of the reasons supporting his issuance of the rule, at the time that he did so.  \nThis statement provides the “contemporaneous explanation” for the issuance  of the rule.  Camp v. \nPitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973).  This case is entirely unlike the agency’s justification  in Department of \nHomeland Security v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1909 (2020)—the only case cited by \nthe Plaintiffs—which  involved an agency memorandum created far after the predicate action took \nplace.   \nThe Scope of the Rule.  Finally, the Plaintiffs contend that the rule is overly broad, either because \nit should have applied only to facilities that care for the elderly and infirm, or because the rule should \nhave exempted personnel without direct contact with patients.  Br. at 22.  The Secretary reasonably \nexplained his policy choices on both scores. \nThe Plaintiffs assert that the rule “reaches categories of healthcare facilities, such as Psychiatric \nResidential Treatment Facilities (“PRTFs”) for individuals under age 21, that are not related to CMS’s \nasserted interest in protecting elderly and infirm patients from COVID-19.”  Id.  But that misstates \nthe Secretary’s interest;  nowhere in the rule did he claim that his statutory responsibilities  extended \nonly to the elderly or infirm.  Instead,  his statutory responsibility—and  his asserted interest—is  to \nprotect the health and safety of each of the patient populations at health care facilities covered by this \nrule.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(h)(1) (incorporating for psychiatric  residential  treatment  facilities, \n33 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 48 of 66 PageID #: 391\nthrough  cross-referenced  statutes,  the  health  and  safety  requirements  for  hospitals  under \n§ 1395x(e)(9)).   And he reasonably concluded that individuals  in congregate care settings,  such as \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities, are at greater risk of acquiring infections, including infection \nwith the virus that causes COVID-19.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,575.  He also noted the danger of cross-\ntransmission of the virus, since staff at certain facilities may work across facility types.  Id.  Residents \nof these  facilities  also  may  have  difficulty  adhering  to  alternative  protocols  used  to  limit  the \ntransmission  of the virus.  Id.  In addition to this discussion  of the risks posed in these particular \nfacilities, the Secretary explained his rationale for extending the rule to each of the types of providers \nthat are subject to its requirements.  See id. at 61,575-83.   \nThe Plaintiffs also contend that the rule is overbroad because it requires the vaccination of all \nstaff that  may come into contact  with others at the site of care.  Br. at 22.  But far from being \n“inexplicable,” id., the Secretary explained at length why these personnel should be covered by the \nvaccination requirements.  See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,570-71.  He concluded that these persons may \n“encounter fellow employees, such as in an administrative office or at an off-site staff meeting, who \nwill themselves enter a health care facility or site of care for their job responsibilities[.]”   Id. at 61,568. \nGiven the high transmissibility  of the virus and demonstrated rates of transmission of the virus among \nhealth care workers, this conclusion was eminently reasonable.  See id. at 61,557.  The Secretary elected \nto exempt persons who perform only infrequent tasks at health care facilities, and directed providers \nto consider  “frequency  of presence,  services  provided, and  proximity to patients  and staff”  in \nevaluating which of their employees would be covered under the rule.  Id. at 61,571.  He considered a \nbroader exemption to “exclud[e] individual staff members who are present at the site of care less \nfrequently  than once per week from these vaccination  requirements,  but [was] concerned that this \nmight lead to confusion or fragmented care.”  Id. at 61570-71. Accordingly, the rule provides strong \nprotection  to patients  by requiring  the  vaccinations  of health  care providers and personnel  who \ninteract with patients directly, along with staff who pose a danger of indirect transmission of the virus.9   \n                                              \n9 At the same time, the rule exempts from the vaccine requirements those staff who “telework \n34 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 49 of 66 PageID #: 392\nUltimately, the Plaintiffs’ argument boils down to a dispute over where to draw the line with \na vaccination  requirement.   But an agency “is not required to identify the optimal threshold  with \npinpoint precision.   It is only required to identify the standard and explain its relationship  to the \nunderlying regulatory concerns.”  WorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 238 F.3d 449, 461-62 (D.C. Cir. 2001); see also \nExxonMobil Gas Mktg. Co. v. FERC, 297 F.3d 1071, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“We are generally ‘unwilling \nto review line-drawing performed by the Commission unless a petitioner can demonstrate that lines \ndrawn . . . are patently unreasonable, having no relationship to the underlying regulatory problem.’”) \n(quoting Cassell v. FCC, 154 F.3d 478, 485 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).  Although the Plaintiffs would prefer for \nthe rule to cover fewer health care staff, the APA does not permit them to “substitute [their] policy \njudgment for that of the agency.” Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.  It was plainly reasonable \nfor the Secretary to pursue robust protection for patients by requiring vaccination of the categories of \nstaff set forth above, and reasonableness is all the APA requires.  See id. (“A court simply ensures that \nthe agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and . . . has reasonably considered the relevant \nissues and reasonably explained the decision.”). \nC.  The Secretary had good cause to issue the rule on an interim basis. \nThe Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their claim that the Secretary was required to follow \nnotice-and-comment  procedures before issuing  the rule.   Notice-and-comment rulemaking is not \nrequired “when the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement \nof reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, \nunnecessary,  or contrary to the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(2)(C) \n(incorporating 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B)) into the Medicare statute).   This exception excuses notice and \ncomment in emergency situations,  or where delay could result in serious harm.  See Jifry v. FAA, 370 \nF.3d 1174, 1179 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  The Secretary’s finding here more than meets that standard. \nAs the Secretary explained, “a further delay in imposing a vaccine mandate would endanger \n                                              \nfull-time,” and vendors and other professionals who perform infrequent, non-healthcare services.  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,571.  CMS also found that  it would be “overly burdensome” to mandate that all \nproviders and suppliers ensure COVID-19 vaccination “for all individuals who enter the facility.”  Id.     \n35 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 50 of 66 PageID #: 393\nthe health and safety of additional patients and be contrary to the public interest.”   86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,584; see id. at 61,583, 61,586 (similar).  The Secretary found that any delay for a comment period \nwould be contrary to the public interest, given the “life-saving importance” of the rule, Council of S. \nMountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 573, 581 (D.C. Cir. 1981), just as the APA permits.  See also, e.g., \nNw. Airlines, Inc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 F.2d 1309, 1321 (8th Cir. 1981) (holding that the “urgent necessity \nfor rapid administrative action under the circumstances of the present case would justify the Secretary's \nfinding of ‘good cause’”).  If, as the Eighth Circuit held, the desire for smooth air travel “on the eve \nof the winter holiday season,” constitutes  “good cause” to implement an air traffic rule with a seven-\nday comment period, id., then  the urgent need  to protect the health  and safety of Medicare and \nMedicaid patients from a virus that has claimed more than 720,000 lives plainly suffices to waive the \nnotice-and-comment requirement as well.     \nThe Secretary reasonably determined that “[a]ny delay in the implementation of this rule would \nresult  in additional  deaths  and serious  illnesses  among health  care  staff and consumers,  further \nexacerbating the newly-arising, and ongoing, strain on the capacity of health care facilities to serve the \npublic.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.  In fact, he projected that the “total lives saved under this rule may \nwell reach several hundred a month or perhaps several thousand a month.”  Id. at 61,612; accord United \nStates v. Brewer, 766 F.3d 884, 890 (8th Cir. 2014) (recognizing that “the risk of future harm may, under \nsome circumstances,  justify a finding of good cause” where the risk is “more substantial than a mere \npossibility”).  See also Sorenson Comm’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (although good \ncause is rarely invoked, “we have approved an agency’s decision to bypass notice and comment where \ndelay would imminently threaten life”).    \nUnable to dispute these findings, the Plaintiffs simply ignore them.  This omission is of a piece \nwith the Plaintiffs’ failure to acknowledge the now more than 760,000 total lives lost to COVID-19 \nin the United States, or that COVID-19 continues to claim over 1,000 lives in this country every day.10  \n                                              \n10 See New York Times, Coronavirus in the US: Latest Map and Case Count (updated Nov. 17, 2021), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html  (stating  a daily average of 1,158 \ndeaths, 48,276 hospitalizations,  and 94,669 cases).  \n36 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 51 of 66 PageID #: 394\nBut the Eighth Circuit has long recognized that “considerations  of public health  and safety” may \nconstitute  good cause to waive notice and comment.  United States v. Gavrilovic, 551 F.2d 1099, 1105 \n(8th Cir. 1977).   The court recognized that “[a]s the degree of risk and the potential for harm increase \nthe need to provide immediate controls increases accordingly.  The issue is whether the need is so \ngreat and the emergency so defined that it justifies administrative rule making without according the \npublic the ordinary notice required by law.”  Id.  The COVID-19 pandemic is indeed a precisely \ndefined emergency.  Moreover, with COVID-19 being “the deadliest disease in American history,” 86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,556, “the degree of risk and potential for harm” yield a “need to provide immediate \ncontrols” of unparalleled  and (at the least)  sufficient  “greatness”  to clear the  good cause  hurdle.  \nGavrilovic, 551 F.2d at 1105; accord Hedge v. Lyng, 689 F. Supp. 884, 892–93 (D. Minn. 1987) (explaining \nthat “legitimate grounds” for invoking the good cause exception include “an urgency of conditions \ncoupled with a demonstrated and unavoidable limitations of time”) (citation omitted). \nBeyond reasonably concluding  and explaining  that  the need to prevent loss of additional \nhuman life justifies the immediate action here, the Secretary also detailed the nature of the emergency \nover the most recent several months  and reached reasonable  predictions about the nature of the \nemergency  over  the  coming  few  months.    He  explained  that  he  initially  chose  a  policy  of \n“encourag[ing] rather than mandat[ing] vaccination,” believing that a combination of other efforts and \nactions would be “adequate.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  However, despite all of these other efforts, id. \n“vaccine uptake among health  care staff” remains “insufficient  to protect the health and safety of \nindividuals  receiving  health  care  services  from Medicare- and  Medicaid-certified  providers  and \nsuppliers.”  Id.; see also id. at 61,559 (detailing average vaccination rates below 70% among health care \nstaff across different types of facilities).  This conclusion is supported by data “demonstrat[ing] SARS–\nCoV–2 transmissions between health-care workers and patients in hospitals, despite universal masking \nand other protocols.”  Id. at 61,585.  As a result, any delay of the rule “would contribute to additional \nnegative health outcomes for patients including loss of life.”  Id. at 61,584.    \nThe Secretary  also explained why the  advent of the Delta variant  requires  addressing the \ncurrently inadequate vaccination levels without delay.  Id. at 61,583.  As the Secretary explained, the \n37 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 52 of 66 PageID #: 395\nemergence of Delta in summer 2021 reversed the declines in cases, hospitalizations,  and deaths in the \nfirst half of the year, with daily cases increasing over 1200 percent, hospitalizations,  over 600 percent, \nand deaths, by nearly 800 percent, with the overwhelming majority occurring among individuals who \nwere not fully vaccinated.  Id.  These persistently  high hospitalization  rates, which are concentrated \namong the unvaccinated,  are, together  with “persistent  staffing shortages due, at least  in part, to \nCOVID-19 infection or quarantine  following exposure,” placing “tremendous strain” on the health \ncare system.  Id.  As of mid-October 2021, CDC had reported an estimated more than 500,000 cases \nand 1,900 deaths among health care staff, a likely underestimate.  Id. at 61,585.  Moreover, data shows \nthat cases among health care workers have “grown in tandem with broader national incidence trends \nsince the Delta variant’s emergence,” id.; among those healthcare staff for whom data was reported to \nthe CDC, cases “increased by nearly 600 percent between June and August 2021.”  Id.  As the Secretary \nexplained, “[b]ecause they are at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection and severe disease, \nunvaccinated  staff present  a risk of exacerbating  ongoing staffing  shortages—particularly  during \nperiods of community surges in SARS–CoV–2 infection,  when demand for health  care services is \nmost acute.”  Id. \nFurther, and based on available data, the Secretary reasonably predicted that a renewed surge, \nthe coming flu season, or a combination of the two will further exacerbate the strain on the health \ncare system.  See, e.g., Citizens  Telecoms.  Co. of Minn.,  LLC, 901 F.3d at 1010 (judicial  deference is \nparticularly important to an agency’s predictive judgments).  First, the Secretary identified “emerging \nindications  of potential increases”  in cases, “particularly [in] northern states where the weather has \nbegun  to  turn  colder,”  indications  which  are consistent  with  evidence  that  “[r]espiratory  virus \ninfections typically circulate more frequently during the winter months.” Id. at 61,584.11 \nSecond, the Secretary explained that the coming flu season “presents an additional threat to \npatient health and safety,” given that the interaction of the flu virus with the COVID-19 virus could \n                                              \n11 Although Plaintiffs assert that CMS’s claims of “emerging indications of potential increases” \nare “uncited” and “undocumented,” those indications were evident in the CDC COVID Data Tracker \ncited numerous times throughout the rule, including in this discussion. See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583-\n84 n.185. \n38 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 53 of 66 PageID #: 396\nlead to particularly severe outcomes for health care facility patients.  Id.  While he acknowledged that \nthe “intensity” of the coming flu season “cannot be predicted,” he identified “[s]everal factors” that \n“could make this flu season more severe.” Id. ( “return to school by children with no prior exposure \nto flu . . . , waning protection over time from previous seasonal influenza  vaccination, and the fact \nthat adult immunity . . . will now partly depend on exposure to viruses two or more seasons earlier”).  \nThe number of factors cited by the agency, and the likelihood of each occurring, raises the risk of a \nsevere flu season above “a mere possibility.” Brewer, 766 F.3d at 890 (cited in Br. at 34). \nMoreover, the  Secretary  cited “[p]reliminary  evidence  suggest[ing]  that  a combination  of \ninfections with influenza and SARS–CoV–2 would result in more severe health outcomes for patients \nthan either infection alone.”  Id.  He determined that the strain on the health care system produced by \nthe coincidence  of persistently  high (or rising)  COVID-19 cases  together with an imminent  and \npotentially  severe flu season would “adversely impact patient access to care and care quality” and, \ntherefore,  “it  is  imperative  that  the  risk  for healthcare-associated  COVID-19 transmission  be \nminimized during the influenza  season.”  Id.  Because flu incidence  is highest “between December \nthrough March” and “COVID-19 vaccines require time after administration for the body to build an \nimmune response,” he reasonably determined that “a staff COVID-19 vaccination requirement  for \nthe providers and suppliers identified in this rule cannot be further delayed.”  Id.  In this regard, and \ncontrary to the Plaintiffs’ suggestion, Br. at 33, the Secretary has “point[ed] to something specific that \nillustrates a particular harm that will be caused by the delay required for notice and comment.” Brewer, \n766 F.3dat 890 (citation  omitted).  Moreover, his invocation  of a renewed COVID-19 surge, the \ncoming flu season, or a combination of the two, are not merely recitations of the reasons for the rule, \ncontra Br. at 33; they are, rather, considered, supported reasons that the rule is necessary right now. \nBased on all of these reasons, and considering all of the available data, the Secretary determined \nthat “a further delay in imposing a vaccine mandate would endanger the health and safety of additional \npatients  and be contrary  to the  public  interest,”  id at  61,584; see  also  id.  at 61,586 (same),  and, \naccordingly, carried its burden of demonstrating that delay occasioned by the notice and comment \nprocedures “would in fact harm that interest.”  Mack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 95 (D.C. Cir. \n39 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 54 of 66 PageID #: 397\n2012); see also Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d 95, 113–14 (2d Cir. \n2018).   The fact that the Secretary issued the rule several weeks after President Biden’s announcement \ndoes not “weaken[]” this determination.  Br. at 34.  Any rule—whether or not accompanied by notice \nand comment procedures—must be the result of considered judgment and a reasoned decisionmaking \nprocess, a process that takes time to complete.  To the extent the President’s announcement is relevant \nhere,  the  fact that  the  Secretary  issued  the  rule  less  than  two months  after that  announcement \ndemonstrates that he acted with appropriate dispatch. \nBecause the Secretary had good cause to dispense with notice-and-comment rulemaking, the \nPlaintiffs’  two additional procedural arguments are unavailing.   First, the Plaintiffs  contend that the \nSecretary  violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  Br. at 35.  That statute  directs that,  “[i]n carrying out his \nfunctions,  relating  to determination  of [some, but not all,  of the] conditions  of participation  by \nproviders of services . . . [at issue here], the Secretary shall consult with appropriate State agencies and \nrecognized national  listing  or accrediting bodies[.]”  42 U.S.C. § 1395z.  The Secretary found that \n“[a]ny delay in the implementation of this rule would result in additional deaths and serious illnesses \namong health care staff and consumers, further exacerbating the newly-arising, and ongoing, strain on \nthe capacity of health care facilities to serve the public.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.  Based on that finding \nof the existence  of an emergency, he determined that there are no entities  with which it would be \n“appropriate to engage in these consultations  in advance of issuing” the interim rule, but noted that \nhe would engage in consultations following the rule’s issuance “in carrying out [his] functions.”  Id.   \nThis determination  is entitled  to deference from this  Court, for the same reasons that the \nSecretary’s decision to issue an interim final rule is so entitled.  See The GEO Grp., Inc. v. Newsom, 15 \nF.4th 919, 930 (9th Cir. 2021) (statutory language authorizing agency to take “appropriate” action “is \na hallmark of vast discretion”).  See also Alon Refin. Krotz Springs, Inc. v. EPA, 936 F.3d 628, 655 (D.C. \nCir. 2019), cert. denied sub nom., Valero Energy Corp. v. EPA, 140 S. Ct. 2792 (2020) (“nor does the phrase \n‘as appropriate’ itself specify a particular temporal dimension”).   \nSecond, the Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary’s issuance of his rule on an emergency basis \nviolated 42 U.S.C. § 1302(b), which requires the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis upon the \n40 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 55 of 66 PageID #: 398\npublication of a “notice of proposed rulemaking,” id. § 1302(b)(1), or upon the publication of a “final \nversion of a rule or regulation with respect to which an initial regulatory impact analysis is required by \nparagraph (1),” id. § 1302(b)(2).  This requirement does not apply here.  The Secretary did not publish \na notice of proposed rulemaking, and this is not the final version of a rule with respect to which an \ninitial regulatory impact analysis  was required.  The Secretary accordingly reasonably found that the \nstatute did not require an analysis under either paragraph; the plain text of the statute “only applies to \nfinal rules for which a proposed rule was published,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613, not to interim final rules, \nsuch as this one, that the Secretary publishes to address emergencies such as an imminent threat to \npatients’ lives.   See Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) \n(courts  are not free to impose additional procedural requirements  on rulemakings  beyond those \nexpressed in statute). \nD. The rule is constitutional. \nThe vaccination  rule does not, as the Plaintiffs contend, upset any federal-state “balance” or \nexceed Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce.  The Supreme Court “long ago rejected the \nsuggestion  that  Congress invades  areas reserved to the  States  by the  Tenth  Amendment simply \nbecause it exercises its authority under the Commerce Clause [or, as here, the Spending Clause] in a \nmanner that displaces  the States’ exercise  of their  police powers.”  Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & \nReclamation  Ass’n, 452 U.S. 264, 291 (1981).  In fact, “[a] Tenth Amendment challenge  to a statute \nnecessarily  fails if the statute is a valid exercise of a power relegated to Congress.”  United States v. \nLouper-Morris, 672 F.3d 539, 563 (8th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).  Even though “public health” is an \n“area[] of traditional state concern,” “Congress’ authority under the Spending Clause to choose how \nto fund the Medicare program is not in doubt.”  Minnesota ex rel. Hatch v. United States, 102 F. Supp. 2d \n1115, 1123 (D. Minn. 2000), aff'd sub nom. Minnesota Senior Fed’n, Metro. Region v. United States, 273 F.3d \n805 (8th Cir. 2001).  And it stands to reason that if a statute constitutes a valid exercise of congressional \npower, any regulation validly promulgated pursuant to statutory authority must also be immune from \na Tenth  Amendment challenge.   Accordingly,  because, for the reasons articulated  above, see supra \n41 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 56 of 66 PageID #: 399\nSection II.A., the vaccination rule is a valid exercise of the agency’s statutory authority, the Plaintiffs \nare unlikely to succeed on the merits of their Tenth Amendment challenge. \nThe Plaintiffs  next contend briefly that the vaccination  rule was not a valid exercise of the \nCommerce Clause.  Br. at 31.  But the statutes upon which the Secretary relied are exercises of the \nCongressional spending power, rather than the commerce power, so the Plaintiffs’ discussion of the \nCommerce Clause is irrelevant here.  See Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., \n527 U.S. 666, 686 (1999) (“Congress may, in the exercise of its spending power, condition its grant of \nfunds to the States upon their taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take, and \nthat acceptance of the funds entails an agreement to the actions.”).  And, in any event, the States miss \nthe mark in arguing that the vaccination rule “does not regulate ongoing commercial activity,” Br. at \n31, or in likening  it to the provision of the  Affordable Care Act at issue  in National Federation of \nIndependent  Business  v. Sebelius,  567 U.S. 519, 520 (2012) (“NFIB”).  The vaccination  rule does not \ncompel any parties to become active in commerce; instead, it is a condition on payment of funds to \nentities  that make the voluntary choice to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  See \nNorthport Health Servs., 14 F.4th at 869 n.5. \nThe Plaintiffs  likewise err when they reach the constitutional  provision that does apply here, \nthe Spending Clause.  They argue that the vaccination rule violates the Spending Clause by allegedly \ncommandeering the States’ administrative apparatus for federal purposes without clear notice to the \nStates.  Br. at 29-30.  But the conditions on federal spending of which the Plaintiffs  complain are \nimposed on public  or private  entities  that  choose  to participate  in  the  Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms, not on States in their capacity as States.  See Northport Health Servs., 14 F.4th at 869 n.5. \n In any event, “under Congress[’s] spending power, [it] may attach conditions on the receipt \nof federal funds,” as long as ‘[s]uch conditions . . . bear some relationship to the purpose of the federal \nspending.”  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 167 (1992) (citation omitted).  “Congress has broad \npower to set the terms on which it disburses federal money to the States.”  Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. \nBd. of Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006).  “[L]egislation enacted pursuant to the spending power \n42 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 57 of 66 PageID #: 400\nis much in the nature  of a contract:   in return for federal funds, the States  agree to comply with \nfederally imposed conditions.”  Pennhurst States Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  \nMedicare and Medicaid are massive federal programs that impose all sorts of conditions with \nwhich participants  must comply in order to receive funds.  Even where, unlike here, the Medicaid \nprogram has conditioned federal funding for State governments on the States’ agreement to certain \nconditions,  courts have upheld  those conditions  under Congress’s spending  authority,  absent,  in \ncertain circumstances not present here, a conclusion that the offer of federal funding is coercive.  See, \ne.g., Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n,  496 U.S. 498, 502 (1990) (“Although participation  in the [Medicaid] \nprogram is voluntary, participating [s]tates must comply with certain requirements imposed by the Act \nand regulations promulgated by the Secretary.”).  And Congress acts on even stronger footing when \nit  offers federal funding  to private entities  in  exchange  for their  agreement  to abide by certain \nconditions on that funding, such as an agreement to protect the health and safety of their patients.  See \nMinn. Ass’n of Health Care Facilities, Inc. v. Minn. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, 742 F.2d 442, 446 (8th Cir. 1984) \n(“Despite the strong financial inducement to participate in Medicaid, a nursing home’s decision to do \nso is nonetheless  voluntary.”);  see also Northport Health, 14 F.4th at 869 n.5; Se. Ark. Hospice, Inc. v. \nBurwell, 815 F.3d 448, 450 (8th Cir. 2016) (holding that hospice provider’s voluntary participation in \nMedicare “forecloses the  possibility  that  the statute  could result  in an imposed taking  of private \nproperty which would give rise to the constitutional  right of just compensation” (quoting Minn. Ass’n, \n742 F.2d at 446)). \n   The Plaintiffs  nevertheless  argue—again, on the basis of NFIB—that “[f]orcing States to \nadminister the mandate or jeopardize all Medicare and Medicaid funds flowing into their States (even to private \nhealthcare providers) is ‘a gun to the head’ that compels states to participate against their will.”  Br. at \n30 (Plaintiffs’  emphasis) (quoting NFIB, 567 U.S. at 581).  The NFIB plurality reasoned that Congress \nhad coerced the States by conditioning all funding for one program, the traditional Medicaid program, \non the States’ agreement to participate in a new, second program, the expansion of the program to \nnew populations.  But here, the Secretary is not “enlisting  the States in a new health care program,” \nNFIB, 567 U.S. at 584.  See Gruver v. La. Bd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. & Mech. Coll., 959 \n43 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 58 of 66 PageID #: 401\nF.3d 178, 184 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 901 (2020).  He is simply applying the existing provisions \nof the Medicare and Medicaid statutes to fulfill his statutory duty to protect the health and safety of \nbeneficiaries of these programs.    \nThe Plaintiffs also contend that they did not have “clear notice” of the obligations imposed \nby the rule.  Br. at 30 (quoting Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., 548 U.S. at 296).  But health care facilities that \nchoose to receive federal funding do so with the awareness that they are subject to the Secretary’s \nhealth and safety standards.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a).  Likewise, if States choose to operate as state \nsurveyors, they enter into a voluntary agreement, that is terminable by either party, to receive funding \nfor their survey activities.   If they enter into such an agreement, they simply commit themselves  to \nreview health  care facilities’  compliance with federal standards and to report their  findings to the \nSecretary for further action, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a); 42 C.F.R. § 488.10(a), 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(1), \nusing “the survey methods, procedures, and forms that are prescribed by CMS,” id. § 488.26(d).   \nDespite making that commitment, the Plaintiffs  now protest that the Secretary’s  health and \nsafety standards are not expressly spelled out by statute.  The Constitution does not demand this level \nof exactitude.    See,  e.g.,  Bennett  v.  Ky. Dep’t  of  Educ.,  470 U.S.  656,  669 (1985)  (“[T]he  Federal \nGovernment simply could not prospectively resolve every possible ambiguity concerning particular \napplications of [a grant program’s] requirements . . . .”).  “Congress is not required to list every factual \ninstance in which a state will fail to comply with a condition.”  Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, \n1067 (9th Cir. 2002).  At bottom, the choice of health care facilities to participate in the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs is a voluntary one, and facilities that make that choice do so with the knowledge \nthat  the  Secretary  may  impose  requirements  on  them  that  he  finds  necessary  to  further  the \nCongressional purposes of protecting the health and safety of program beneficiaries.   See Northport \nHealth, 14 F.4th at 869 n.5. \nIII.  THE  REMAINING  INJUNCTION  FACTORS  REQUIRE  DENIAL  OF \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION.  \nA.  Plaintiffs fail to establish irreparable harm. \nThe Plaintiffs also cannot demonstrate likely irreparable harm.  See Florida v. Dep’t of Health & \n44 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 59 of 66 PageID #: 402\nHuman Servs., No. 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021), Order, ECF No. 6 (denying \npreliminary injunction  in a nearly identical suit for the State’s failure to show irreparable harm).  Such \na showing is indispensable for a preliminary injunction.  Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Rounds, \n530 F.3d 724, 732–33 & n.5 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  “In order to demonstrate irreparable harm, a \nparty must show that the harm is certain and great and of such imminence that there is a clear and \npresent  need  for equitable  relief.”  Iowa  Utils.  Bd.  v.  FCC,  109  F.3d 418,  425  (8th  Cir.  1996).  \n“Speculative harm” or a mere “possibility of irreparable harm” is not enough.  S.J.W. ex rel. Wilson v. \nLee’s Summit R-7 Sch. Dist., 696 F.3d 771, 779 (8th Cir. 2012); Winte, 555 U.S. at 22.  Economic loss \nalone is not irreparable harm unless the injuries cannot be recovered.  See Chlorine Inst., Inc. v. Soo Line \nR.R., 792 F.3d 903, 915 (8th Cir. 2015).  \n1.  The  Plaintiffs  suffer  no  cognizable  harm  to  their  “sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  or \nproprietary” interests at all, let alone a harm of the type required for equitable relief.  The Plaintiffs do \nnot have a cognizable interest for Article III purposes in the abstract question whether state law is \npreempted.  See Va. ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253, 270 (4th Cir. 2011); see also Florida, Order \nat 10 (rejecting this same argument as “lack[ing] merit”).  And, as for the Plaintiffs’  quasi-sovereign \ninterests or parens patriae interests, the Plaintiffs have no standing to sue the federal government in that \ncapacity and therefore cannot assert that they have been irreparably harmed on the basis of such \ninterests.  See Iowa ex rel. Miller v. Block, 771 F.2d 347, 355 (8th Cir. 1985) (“[W]e cannot allow the State \nto proceed as parens patriae in this case.  To do so would intrude on the sovereignty  of the federal \ngovernment and ignore important considerations of our federalist system.”); see also Alfred L. Snapp & \nSon v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 610 n.16 (1982) (“A State does not have standing as parens \npatriae to bring an action against the Federal Government”).    \nFinally,  regarding the Plaintiffs’  proprietary interests,  they assert they will suffer “irreparable \npocketbook harm” and “a diversion of state resources,” Br. at 40, but neither constitutes  irreparable \nharm.  See Florida, Order at 9 (“[E]conomic loss such as the loss of funding is not irreparable.”).  In \nfact, as explained previously, the Supreme Court recognized § 405’s channeling provision “comes at a \nprice, namely, occasional individual, delay-related hardship,” but concluded that Congress judged this \n45 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 60 of 66 PageID #: 403\nprice to be justified  “[i]n the  context  of a massive,  complex health  and safety program such  as \nMedicare.”   Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 13. \n2.   The  Plaintiffs’  claims  of irreparable  harm  are  also  speculative,  as  the  Florida  court \nrecognized.  That court “disregarded as conclusory” and as “speculative”  the State’s assertions  (in \ndeclarations  materially identical  to those submitted here) “of how the various [state] agencies  and \ninstitutions  anticipate they may be adversely impacted by the mandate.”  Florida, Order at 8.  The court \nalso noted that Florida’s affidavits failed to “take . . . into account any impact from the availability of \nthe exemption process,” and concluded that Florida had failed to provide any “evidence to suggest \nthat  the  anticipated  loss  of federal  funding  from the  State  agencies’  noncompliance  will  occur \nimmediately on December 6, 2021.”  Id. at 10.   \nThe Plaintiffs’  evidence here is equally  lacking.  They rely on conjecture  that the rule will \n“exacerbate an alarming shortage of healthcare workers.”  Br. at 1.  “‘Bare allegations of what is likely \nto occur are of no value since the court must decide whether the harm will in fact occur.’”  Packard \nElevator v. Interstate Com. Comm’n, 782 F.2d 112, 115 (8th Cir. 1986) (quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 \nF.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam)).  As stated in the rule, “many health care workers already \ncomply with employer or State government vaccination  requirements  (for example, influenza,  and \nhepatitis B virus (HBV)),” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567, and “most of these individuals met State and local \nvaccination  requirements  in order to attend school.”  Id. at 61,567-68.  The Secretary recognized \nconcerns that health  care workers would choose to leave their jobs rather than be vaccinated,  but \nfound “insufficient  evidence to quantify  and compare adverse impacts on patient and resident care \nassociated with temporary staffing losses due to mandates and absences due to quarantine for known \nCOVID-19 exposures and illness.”  Id. at 61,569.  Further, the Secretary identified real-world evidence \nshowing that, when COVID-19 vaccination requirements have been initiated, workers have responded \nby getting vaccinated.  “99.5 percent of . . . staff” at a large hospital system in Texas responded to the \nsystem’s mandate by getting vaccinated, id.; 98 percent of a 33,000 employee health system in Detroit \ndid the same, id.; 95 percent of workers at more than 250 long-term care facilities did so, id.; and New \nYork’s state-wide health care worker mandate also saw a “jump in vaccine compliance in the final days \n46 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 61 of 66 PageID #: 404\nbefore the requirements took effect,” id.  See also 86 Fed. Reg. 63,418, 63,422 (Nov. 16, 2021) (Office \nof Management and Budget analysis noting that “Tyson Foods reported more than 96 percent of its \nworkforce is now vaccinated” after the company imposed a vaccination requirement).   \nThe Plaintiffs  identify no evidence demonstrating that health care workers will actually leave \ntheir jobs in large numbers if the vaccination rule remains in effect.  They cite declarations from health \ncare facilities that “project” losses, “fear[]” that they will not survive, and “expect[]” to lose employees, \nBr. at 9, but they have not identified any facilities that actually issued or were subject to vaccination \nrequirements  and lost  significant  numbers of employees.   In  the  absence  of such  evidence,  the \nPlaintiffs cannot show that the harm they fear will in fact occur.   \nMoreover, the Plaintiffs fail to set forth any evidence that the labor loss they fear will certainly \noutstrip staffing losses and absences due to quarantine for known COVID-19 exposures or the normal \nchurn in the health care labor market.  The Plaintiffs set forth statistics  about staffing shortages, but \nthey do not evaluate why those shortages exist.  The Secretary explored this issue, and found that \n“some hospitals and health care systems are currently experiencing tremendous strain due to high case \nvolume, coupled with persistent  staffing shortages due, at least in part, to COVID-19 infection or \nquarantine following exposure.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,583.  Nor do the Plaintiffs provide any evidence \nthat in the absence of the vaccination rule, they will be able to stave off additional staffing problems.  \nIn fact, the opposite appears to be the case.  The Plaintiffs admit that during the pandemic, “there has \nbeen a boom in demand for travel nurses” and that “small rural hospitals . . . cannot afford to pay \ntheir nurses more to stay.”  Br. at 2.  The longer the pandemic rages, the more the demand for travel \nnurses will stay high and the more employees will be lured away for higher pay.  The Plaintiffs cannot \ncarry their burden to show irreparable harm when they cannot show that in the absence of the rule \nthey will be able to retain all of their current employees. \nAccordingly,  they cannot  show that  the harm they  fear is “certain  and great and of such \nimminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.”  Novus Franchising, Inc. v. Dawson, \n725 F.3d 885, 895 (8th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).  Because the Plaintiffs cannot show irreparable \nharm, they are not entitled to injunctive  relief.  Mgmt. Registry, Inc. v. A.W. Companies,  Inc., 920 F.3d \n47 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 62 of 66 PageID #: 405\n1181, 1184 (8th Cir. 2019).   \nB.  Plaintiffs fail to establish that the balance of equities and public interest factors \nfavor the requested injunction. \nThe third and fourth requirements  for issuance  of a preliminary injunction—the  balance of \nharms and whether the  requested  injunction  will disserve  the  public interest—“merge  when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  Here, these considerations tilt decisively \nin the Defendants’ favor. \nFirst, enjoining the rule would harm the public interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19 \namong millions of health care workers and Medicare and Medicaid patients.  As the Supreme Court \nhas  recognized,  “[s]temming the  spread of COVID-19 is unquestionably  a compelling interest.”  \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020).  Accordingly, numerous courts \nreviewing “executive action designed to slow the spread of COVID-19” have concluded that, “[t]he \npublic  interest  in  protecting  human  life—particularly  in  the  face of a global and unpredictable \npandemic—would not be served by” an injunction.   Tigges v. Northam, 473 F. Supp. 3d 559, 573–74 \n(E.D. Va. 2020); see also, e.g., Am.’s Frontline Drs. v. Wilcox, No. EDCV 21-1243, 2021 WL 4546923, at \n*8 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2021); Valdez v.

Mass. Oct. 15, 2021); \nJohnson v. Brown, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 4846060, at *26-27 (D.Or. Oct. 18, 2021); TJM 64, Inc. v. \nHarris, 475 F. Supp. 3d 828, 840–41 (W.D. Tenn. 2020); Talleywhacker, Inc. v. Cooper, 465 F. Supp. 3d \n523, 543 (E.D.N.C. 2020). \nSecond, enjoining  the rule would harm the public interest by further exposing Medicare and \nMedicaid patients and staff—and the Medicare and Medicaid programs—to unvaccinated health care \nworkers.  For  patients  and  staff,  this  means  numerous  additional  lives  affected  by  disease, \n48 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 63 of 66 PageID #: 406\nhospitalization,  or even death.  See supra at 31.  For providers, this means a further contribution to \nstaffing shortages owing to both time off for illness  and quarantine,  as well as staff deaths.  The \nSecretary cited concrete  evidence that an increase  in vaccinated  health  care staff improves patient \nsafety and access to care.  As the Secretary detailed in the rule, “evidence has shown that influenza \nvaccination  of health  care staff is  associated  with declines  in  nosocomial [meaning,  health-care-\nassociated  or  hospital-acquired]  influenza  in  hospitalized  patients,  and  among  nursing  home \nresidents.”   86 Fed. Reg. at 61,558.  Additionally,  “[f]ewer infected staff and lower transmissibility \nequates to fewer opportunities for transmission  to patients.”  Id. at 61,558.  And further, “case rates \namong [long-term care] facility residents are higher in facilities with lower vaccination coverage among \nstaff,” and “nursing home outbreaks have [been] linked . . . to unvaccinated health care workers.”  Id.  \nFinally,  the  Secretary  demonstrated  that  “illnesses  and  deaths  associated  with  COVID-19 are \nexacerbating staffing shortages across the health care system.”  Id. at 61,559.  In particular, “[o]ver half \na million COVID-19 cases and 1,900 deaths among health care staff have been reported to CDC since \nthe start of the [public health emergency],” numbers that are likely undercounts.  Id. \nNot  only  has  the  Secretary  identified  concrete,  data-driven  harms,  but  he  reasonably \ndetermined,  based on the  available  evidence,  that  a tool exists  to counter  those  harms. “FDA-\napproved and FDA-authorized  vaccines  in use  in the  U.S. are both safe and highly  effective  at \nprotecting vaccinated people against symptomatic and severe COVID-19.”  Id. at 61,560.  Moreover, \n“[e]merging evidence also suggests that vaccinated people who become infected with the SARS–CoV–\n2 Delta variant have potential to be less infectious than infected unvaccinated people, thus decreasing \ntransmission risk.” Id. at 61,558.  Reducing COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations,  and deaths, as well as \nthe  transmissibility  of COVID-19 among health  care  workers will  both  prevent  some  staffing \nshortages and protect patient health.  Id. \nBy comparison, any theoretical harm that the Plaintiffs might experience absent a preliminary \ninjunction is, as explained supra at Part III.A, both speculative and purely economic.  Nowhere do the \nPlaintiffs dispute this evidence of positive effects of vaccination on patient care and health, including \nthe  saving  of lives.   In  fact,  in  discussing  the  public  interest  prong, the  Plaintiffs  fail  to even \n49 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 64 of 66 PageID #: 407\nacknowledge the unparalleled American casualties from COVID-19.   Rather, the Plaintiffs argue that \nthe rule will cause health care staff to leave their jobs, with cascading effects on patient access to care.  \nBut they have set forth no evidence to demonstrate that the vaccination rule will actually have that \neffect.  In fact, as noted in the rule, there are clear examples of requirements having exactly the effect \nthat the Secretary intends—increasing  the percentage of vaccinated staff to near 100 percent.  86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,569.   \nMoreover, “[t]here is inherent  harm to an agency in preventing it from enforcing regulations \nthat Congress found it in the public interest to direct that agency to develop.”  Cornish v. Dudas, 540 \nF. Supp. 2d 61, 65 (D.D.C. 2008).  Congress has charged the Secretary with the responsibility  to \nprotect the health and safety of individuals providing and receiving care and services from Medicare \nand Medicaid providers.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395x(e)(9) (hospitals); 1395i–3(d)(4)(B) (Medicare long-\nterm care facilities).   The public interest favors allowing the Secretary to fulfill these responsibilities. \nAt bottom, the balance of harms and the public interest factors of the injunctive  relief analysis \nweigh heavily in favor of allowing the federal government to take reasonable steps to protect the health \nof patients and staff in health care facilities that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  \nGranting the Plaintiffs’  motion would do far more certain harm to the public interest than denying \nthe motion might (potentially) harm the Plaintiffs. \nIV.  ANY  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF  SHOULD  BE  LIMITED  TO  FACILITIES \nOPERATED  BY  THE  PLAINTIFFS  AND  ONLY  TO  ANY  UNLAWFUL \nASPECTS, IF ANY, OF THE RULE.  \nIf the Court disagrees with the Defendants’ arguments, any relief should be no broader than \nnecessary  to remedy the demonstrated irreparable harms of the specific Plaintiffs  in this case.  “A \nplaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury,” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. \nCt. 1916, 1934 (2018), and “injunctive  relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than \nnecessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs,” Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, \n765 (1994) (citation omitted). \nIn that regard, first, any injunction  should apply only to those aspects of the rule for which the \n50 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 65 of 66 PageID #: 408\nCourt finds the Plaintiffs have met their burden under the four-factor test for emergency relief.  The \nSupreme Court has held a regulation severable where severance would “not impair the function of the \nstatute as a whole, and there is no indication that the regulation would not have been passed but for \nits inclusion.”  K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 294 (1988) (invalidating only the provision of \na regulation that exceeded the agency’s statutory authority).   Severability clauses, such as the one in \nthe rule, see 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560, create a presumption that the validity of the entire regulation is not \ndependent on the validity of any specific unlawful provision if that unlawful provision would not \nimpair the function of the regulation as a whole.  Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 686 (1987). \nSecond, any injunctive  relief should be limited, at most, to facilities  operated by the Plaintiffs.  \n“The  Court’s constitutionally  prescribed  role is  to vindicate  the  individual  rights  of the  people \nappearing before it.”  Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1933; see also id. at 1934 (citing Daimler Chrysler Corp. v. Cuno, \n547 U.S. 332, 353 (2006)); Madsen, 512 U.S. at 765.  Indeed, the Plaintiffs have no serious interest in \nwhether other States are subject to the rule during the pendency of this lawsuit (and in fact, if their \nallegations concerning trends among health care workers are to be believed, they would benefit from \nrelief being circumscribed within their own borders to facilities they themselves operate), nor standing \nto assert claims on behalf of facilities  in the Plaintiffs  States that Plaintiffs  do not operate, and the \nPlaintiffs’  claims would be fully redressed through a preliminary injunction  prohibiting the Secretary \nfrom “implementing” or “enforcing” the rule against facilities Plaintiffs operate alone. \nNationwide relief would be particularly harmful here given that two other district courts are \ncurrently considering similar challenges,  and a third recently decided one.  A nationwide injunction \nwould render the district court’s order in Florida, as well as any additional orders that might follow \nfrom other courts considering similar claims, meaningless as a practical matter.  It would also preclude \nappellate courts from testing the Plaintiffs’  claims against the rule’s operation in other jurisdictions.   \nMoreover, more than half of the States are not challenging  the vaccination rule.  There is no reason \nwhy the Plaintiffs’ disagreements with it should govern the rest of the country.  See California v. Azar, \n911 F.3d 558, 583 (9th Cir. 2018) (“The detrimental consequences  of a nationwide injunction are not \nlimited to their effects on judicial decisionmaking.  There are also the equities of non-parties who are \n51 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  23   Filed: 11/22/21   Page: 66 of 66 PageID #: 409\ndeprived the right to litigate in other forums.”); see also id. at 582-84 (vacating nationwide scope of \ninjunction  in facial challenge under the APA).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied. \n \nDated: November 22, 2021        Respectfully submitted, \n \n              BRIAN M.

      "text": "Case: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  15   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 1 of 4 PageID #: 310\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI \n \nSTATE OF MISSOURI, et al.  ) \n  ) \nPlaintiffs,  ) \n  ) \nv.  ) \n  )  Case No. 4:21-cv-01329-MTS \nJOSEPH R.

ECF \nNo. 7.  Plaintiffs’ proposed expedited schedule unnecessarily truncates Defendants’ time to \nrespond to Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs have filed a 257-paragraph, \nnine-count Complaint, see ECF No. 1, and have sought leave to file a preliminary injunction \nmotion more than triple the usual 15-pages allotted under the local rules, see E.D. Mo. L.R. \n4.01(D), to brief numerous “complex and significant issues.”  Pls.’ Mot. to Exceed Page Limitation \nat 1-2, ECF No. 8.  Further, Plaintiffs attached 30 declarations to their preliminary injunction \nmotion.  Plaintiffs failed to give Defendants notice of their preliminary injunction motion, and did \nnot attempt to confer with Defendants before filing their motion to expedite.   \nPrior to filing this opposition, the undersigned counsel contacted Plaintiffs’ counsel in an \nattempt to negotiate a reasonable schedule, to no avail.  Under the local rules, Defendants have \nuntil Monday, November 29, to file their opposition, which is fourteen days after Plaintiffs served \nthe complaint and summons on the United States Attorney’s Office.  E.D. Mo. L.R. 4.01(B).  In \nthe spirit of compromise, however, Defendants offered to cut their time short and file their \n1 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  15   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 2 of 4 PageID #: 311\nopposition brief by noon (Central time) on Wednesday, November 24, a mere two-and-a-half \nbusiness days after Plaintiffs’ proposed response date.  Plaintiffs refused to consent, and declined \nto counteroffer.  Accordingly, Defendants are compelled to file this opposition.  Plaintiffs have not \nidentified any legitimate reason to so drastically expedite the briefing schedule set forth in the local \nrules and therefore their motion to expedite should be denied. \nPlaintiffs’ claims challenge an interim final rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (“CMS”) mandating that healthcare facilities receiving Medicaid or Medicare \nfunding require their employees and contractors be vaccinated against COVID-19. 86 Fed. Reg. \n61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021).  The requirements are “necessary to help protect the health and safety of \nresidents, clinics, patients, PACE participants, and staff, and reflect lessons learned to date as a \nresult of the COVID-19 public health emergency.”  Id.  “As of mid-October 2021, over 44 million \nCOVID-19 cases, 3 million new COVID-19 related hospitalizations, and 720,000 COVID-19 \ndeaths have been reported in the U.S.”  Id. at 61,556.  It is the “deadliest disease in American \nhistory.”  Id.  In light of CMS’s “responsibility to protect the health and safety of individuals \nproviding and receiving care from Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers,” the agency felt \n“compelled to require staff vaccinations for COVID-19 in these settings.”  Id. at 61,560.   \nAs CMS explained in the interim final rule, “[t]he data showing the vital importance of \nvaccination indicate to us that we cannot delay taking this action in order to protect the health and \nsafety of millions of people receiving critical health care services, the workers providing care, and \nour fellow citizens living and working in communities across the nation.” 86 Fed. Reg. 61,583; \nsee also id. at 61,584 (similar) & 61,586 (similar).  Accordingly, the interim final rule went into \neffect upon publication on November 5, 2021, and requires all relevant staff of covered health care \nfacilities to have received, at a minimum, the first dose of a vaccine by December 6, 2021, subject \n2 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  15   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 3 of 4 PageID #: 312\nto  exemptions.    Id.  at  61,573.    Covered  facilities  must  also  have  appropriate  policies  and \nprocedures developed and implemented by that date.  Id.  By January 4, 2022, all relevant staff \nmust receive their second dose, subject to exemptions.  Id.   \nDespite the interim final rule being issued on Friday, November 5, 2021, Plaintiffs waited \na full week before filing their motion for preliminary injunction.  Given that they produced a 50-\npage brief and 30 declarations, it is highly unlikely they started from scratch on November 5, 2021.  \nIf they truly wanted to expedite the court’s consideration, they could have filed a much more \nstreamlined 15-page brief within the local rules’ normal page limits.  But it is simply not reasonable \nfor Plaintiffs to file an overlength motion raising multiple legal issues and facts, provide no notice \nto Defendants, and expect them to respond in a week’s time.   \nThe urgency that Plaintiffs express is illusory.  They assert that “vaccination takes weeks,” \nid. at 3,1 and that healthcare facilities will need time to ensure compliance, id., but do not explain \nhow that has any bearing on the timing of the government’s opposition brief.  The local rules \nprovide Defendants until November 29, 2021, to file their opposition.  E.D. Mo. L.R. 4.01(B).  \nPlaintiffs could then file any reply promptly; they have previously stated their willingness to do so \nwithin one business day.  There is ample time between then and the interim final rule’s first \ncompliance deadline of December 6, 2021, for the Court to issue a decision.   \nAlternatively, Defendants remain willing to stipulate to a schedule that provides for their \nopposition to be due at noon, Central time, on November 24.  Plaintiffs could also file a prompt \nreply under this schedule.  The Court, if it wishes to hold argument, see E.D. Mo. L.R. 4.02(A) \n(default practice is for motions to be determined “without argument”), could schedule that \n                                                 \n1 The interim final rule does not require that both doses of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination \nregimen be completed by December 6, 2021; only that the first shot has been received.  86 Fed. \nReg. 61,573. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  15   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 4 of 4 PageID #: 313\nargument the following week.  That is an eminently reasonable schedule and would not require, as \nPlaintiffs have demanded, that the Court and its staff spend the Thanksgiving holiday drafting an \nopinion by the arbitrary date of November 29.  There is no reason the Court needs to issue a \ndecision prior to December 6, 2021.  Plaintiffs argue in their motion to expedite that they may need \ntime to seek emergency relief at the appellate level, Pls.’ Mot. to Expedite at 1, but the rules provide \na mechanism for Plaintiffs to seek an administrative stay if the Court denies their preliminary \ninjunction motion.     \nFor these reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for expedited briefing.       \n   \nDated: November 16, 2021  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  BRIAN M.

As the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services reasonably determined, his vaccination rule is likely to save \nhundreds, and possibly thousands, of lives each month, once it is implemented.  Accordingly, if the \nrule were not implemented, there would be a substantial harm to Defendants’ compelling public \ninterest in the protection of the lives and well-being of patients served by health care facilities funded \nby the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  \nCourts consider four factors in assessing the propriety of granting a motion for stay pending \nappeal: (1) the movant’s likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the appeal, (2) whether the movant \nwill suffer irreparable damage absent a stay, (3) the harm that other parties will suffer if a stay is \ngranted, and (4) the public interest.  See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987); Shrink Mo. Gov’t \nPAC v. Adams, 151 F.3d 763, 764 (8th Cir. 1998); James River Flood Control Ass’n v. Watt, 680 F.2d 543, \n544 (8th Cir. 1982).   \nThe Eighth Circuit directs that, in evaluating a request for a stay pending appeal, the Court \n“must consider the relative strength of the four factors, ‘balancing them all.’”  Brady v. Nat’l Football \nLeague, 640 F.3d 785, 789 (8th Cir. 2011) (quoting Fargo Women’s Health Org. v. Schafer, 18 F.3d 526, 538 \n(8th Cir. 1994)).  While the “most important factor is the [movant’s] likelihood of success on the \n1 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  31   Filed: 11/30/21   Page: 2 of 4 PageID #: 487\nmerits,” id., “‘[c]lear evidence of irreparable injury should result in a less stringent requirement of \ncertainty of victory.’”  Id. (quoting Developments in the Law, Injunctions, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 994, 1056 (1965)).  \n“[A]ny trial judge is reluctant to find a substantial likelihood exists that he or she will be reversed,” \nand, accordingly, courts in this district have issued stays of injunctions pending appeal where the legal \nquestions were “substantial and matters of first impression,” see, e.g., Sweeney v. Bond, 519 F. Supp. 124, \n132 (E.D. Mo. 1981), aff’d, 669 F.2d 542 (8th Cir. 1982), or “difficult and close,” see, e.g., Perrin v. Papa \nJohns Int’l, Inc., No. 4:09CV01335 AGF, 2014 WL 306250, at *2 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 28, 2014).  See also, e.g., \nPopulation Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1078 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“It will ordinarily be enough that \nthe [movant] has raised serious legal questions going to the merits, so serious, substantial, difficult as \nto make them a fair ground of litigation . . .” (quoting Wash. Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, \nInc., 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).   \nThe substantiality of Defendants’ arguments on appeal, together with the balance of hardships, \nweigh heavily in favor of granting a stay pending appellate review.  The United States is in the midst \nof the most serious public health crisis it has ever faced.  COVID-19 is the deadliest disease in United \nStates history.  As of the time of the issuance three weeks ago of the rule at issue in this case, SARS-\nCoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had infected over 44 million people, hospitalized more than \n3 million people, and had claimed more than 720,000 lives in the United States alone.  Included among \nthe tremendous human cost are at least half a million reported cases and 1,900 reported deaths among \nhealth  care  staff.    Medicare  and  Medicaid  Programs;  Omnibus  COVID-19  Health  Care  Staff \nVaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555, 61,559 (Nov. 5, 2021).   \nCongress has specified that, in order for health care facilities to receive funding under the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, hospitals and other participating facilities must meet conditions of \nparticipation set by the Secretary to protect the health and safety of patients receiving care at these \nfacilities.  The Secretary followed Congress’s instructions by issuing this vaccination rule.  He \nreasonably determined that the presence of unvaccinated health care workers in facilities serving \nMedicare  and  Medicaid  patients  poses  a  risk  of  transmitting  SARS-CoV-2  to  those  patients.  \nAccordingly, the Secretary required facilities, as a condition of participation in Medicare and Medicaid, \n2 \n \n\n \nCase: 4:21-cv-01329-MTS   Doc. #:  31   Filed: 11/30/21   Page: 3 of 4 PageID #: 488\nto ensure that covered staff either obtain vaccination against COVID-19 or seek an exemption from \ndoing so.    \nDefendants’ appeal will raise substantial arguments with regard to this Court’s jurisdiction in \nthis matter, as well as substantial arguments in support of the Secretary’s statutory authority to \nestablish conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Defendants’ appeal will \nalso raise substantial arguments in support of a finding that the Secretary, having considered the \navailable evidence, reasonably exercised his judgment both in issuing his vaccination rule and in \ndetermining that good cause justified his doing so without first undertaking notice and comment \nprocedures.  The remaining equitable factors also weigh heavily in favor of a stay.  Irreparable harm, \nin the form of hundreds or thousands of lives lost each month, would arise if the vaccination rule \nwere not implemented.  The balance of hardships and the public interest, accordingly, also tip in favor \nof a stay.   \nDefendants recognize that this Court has rejected their arguments.  Accordingly, Defendants \nrefrain from reiterating each of their arguments in detail here, and instead incorporate their previously-\nfiled opposition to the preliminary injunction motion by reference.  See Defs.’ Mem. in Opp’n to Pls.’ \nMot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 23.  Defendants respectfully submit, however, that the issues are serious \nand that the Court should issue a stay pending appeal to preserve the status quo while the Court of \nAppeals considers these issues.      \nFor all of these reasons, Defendants respectfully request that this Court stay its preliminary \ninjunction in this case pending appeal. \n \nDated: November 30, 2021        Respectfully submitted, \n \n              BRIAN M.
