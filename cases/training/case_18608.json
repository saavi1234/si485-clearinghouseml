    "summary": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is about whether the federal government can require federal government contractors to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. President Joe Biden signed an executive order in September 2021 that required federal departments and agencies to require contractors and subcontractors to comply with guidance published by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (\"Task Force\"), which was created in January 2021 to provide guidance to heads of federal agencies regarding government functions during the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 24, 2021, the Task Force released its initial guidance to federal agencies, which required that all federal contractors and subcontractors be fully vaccinated by December 8, 2021, unless the employee is entitled to an accommodation. The Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\"), which oversees the Task Force, adopted the Task Force's guidance on September 28. On September 30, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\"FAR\") Council issued guidance to government officials with the responsibility for government contracting to assist agencies in mandating compliance with the Task Force's guidance.</p>\r\n<p>On November 4, 2021, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the States of Tennessee and Ohio, and two Ohio county sheriffs brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky against the federal government to enjoin the mandate for federal contractors and subcontractors. The plaintiffs alleged that several federal governmental bodies violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and that the mandate was in violation of the non-delegation doctrine, the principles of federalism, and was an unconstitutional exercise of the Spending Clause in Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The case was assigned to Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs alleged that OMB's approval of the Task Force's guidance was in violation of the APA because it was contrary to law and in excess of OMB's statutory authority. The plaintiffs argued that OMB's approval violated 41 U.S.C. &sect; 1303 because it was a government-wide procurement regulation, which only the FAR Council may issue. The plaintiffs also argued that the approval was contrary to law because the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (\"FPASA\"), which is the statute that allowed for the establishment of the FAR Council to coordinate government-wide procurement policy, does not grant the President the power to issue orders with the force or effect of law. The plaintiffs also contended that, even if the FPASA authorized the President to issue orders with the force of law, it would not authorize OMB's approval of the Task Force's guidance. In addition, the plaintiffs argued that OMB's approval of the Task Force's guidance was inconsistent with the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act, which requires federal agencies to provide for full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures. The plaintiffs contended that precluding an entire class of contractors from working for the federal government would violate the requirement of full and open competition.</p>\r\n<p>Next, the plaintiffs alleged that the FAR Council's guidance was in violation of the APA because it failed to explain what authority enables the FAR Council to create a government-wide procurement regulation mandating vaccines for contractors. The plaintiffs also contended that the OMB approval of the Task Force's guidance violated the APA because OMB failed to conduct a 60-day notice and comment period, which is required by 41 U.S.C. &sect; 1707. The plaintiffs made an identical claim against the FAR Council for its failure to conduct a notice and comment period. The plaintiffs also argued that OMB's approval of the Task Force's guidance and the FAR Council's guidance violated the APA by being arbitrary and capricious agency actions because both bodies failed to conduct their own independent analyses and instead relied on the Task Force's guidance.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs also alleged that the President's executive order was an ultra vires action, because the FPASA is not a public health statute that allows for a sweeping vaccination mandate. The plaintiffs also contended that the mandate violated the non-delegation doctrine, since the President's executive order was not explicitly authorized by Congress or any existing federal statute. The plaintiffs also argued that the U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal agencies of the executive branch to implement the imposed mandates and argued that the power to do so lies with the states under the Tenth Amendment. Lastly, the plaintiffs alleged that the mandates were an unconstitutional condition on the states' receipt of federal funds.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the vaccine mandate for federal contractors is unlawful and an injunction setting aside the executive order, the OMB's approval of the Task Force's guidance, and the FAR Council's guidance.</p>\r\n<p>On November 8 2021, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. On November 15, 2021, the plaintiffs amended their complaint. The complaint added factual detail regarding the monetary value of the federal contracts in each of the plaintiff states. The complaint also updated the OMB's activity, since it rescinded its initial approval of the Task Force's guidance and issued a new determination on November 10, 2021, which replicated the initial findings. While the new determination was subject to comment, it remained effective immediately. The plaintiffs' substantive allegations against the federal government remained the same.</p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2021, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. First, the court determined that the plaintiffs had standing to sue under Article III of the United States Constitution. The court found that federal contracts constitute a significant amount of monetary inflows for each of the plaintiff states and that federal contractors and subcontractors in each of the states is likely to continue bidding for contracting opportunities in the future. The court also found that the fact that governmental agencies were already requesting that current contracts not officially subject to the vaccine mandate comply with the mandate also indicated a threat of future harm to the plaintiff states since they may be blacklisted in the future for failure to comply. The court concluded that the plaintiff states had sufficiently demonstrated that the states had suffered an injury in fact, that the injury was traceable to the defendants' actions, and that an injunction against the mandate would redress the plaintiffs' injuries.</p>\r\n<p>After conducting an analysis of the plaintiffs' standing to sue, the court moved on to the preliminary injunction prongs: (1) likelihood of success on the merits; (2) the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs in absence of an injunction; (3) whether the issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuing the injunction. In determining whether the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of the case, the court first inquired whether President Biden exceeded his authority under FPASA in promulgating the vaccine mandate executive order. The court pointed out that, while FPASA provides broad delegation of powers to the president, that the procurement power must still be exercised consistently with the structure and purposes of the statute that delegates that power. The court noted that it is unlikely that Congress intended a procurement statute such as FPASA to be the basis for a public health executive order and that such a reading would allow the president to enact virtually any measure under the guise of economy and efficiency. The court also emphasized the breadth of the mandate, which would apply to federal contractors and subcontractors who work from home and are not at risk of spreading COVID-19. Given these concerns, the court concluded that the president exceeded his authority under the FPASA.</p>\r\n<p>The court next analyzed the statutory and constitutional implications from President Biden exceeding his authority under the FPASA, including the Competition in Contracting Act, the nondelegation doctrine, and concerns regarding federalism and the Tenth Amendment. Based on the Competition in Contracting Act's requirement that the federal government provide full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures, the court found that the defendants could exclude unvaccinated contractors and subcontractors from federal contracts without running afoul of the statute. Next, the court inquired as to whether Congress, in its passage of FPASA, supplied an intelligible principle to guide the President's use of discretion, as required by the nondelegation doctrine. On the nondelegation issue, the court declined to decide whether the plaintiffs or defendants were likely to succeed on the merits, stating that it would be useful for appellate courts to further develop the contours of the nondelegation doctrine in light of the pandemic and the scarce case law on the issue. The court also noted its concerns that the defendants had stepped into an area traditionally reserved to the states, which provided an additional reason to temporarily enjoin the mandate.</p>\r\n<p>After analyzing the substantive statutory and constitutional provisions at issue in the case, the court discussed whether the federal government had followed the proper administrative procedures in promulgating the mandate. The court found that the defendants likely followed the procedures required by the Administrative Procedure Act, since the FAR Council Guidance is not subject to judicial review pursuant the APA as it does not constitute a final agency action. In addition, the court found that the plaintiffs' challenge to the FAR Council Guidance was unlikely to succeed on the merits given its nonbinding nature. While the court found that the FAR Council Guidance was not judicially reviewable, it found that the OMB Determination was reviewable but that this agency action was taken using the proper administrative procedures and that it was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\r\n<p>Despite its finding that the defendants followed the appropriate procedural requirements in promulgating the vaccine mandate, the court found that the president exceeded his authority and that the plaintiffs had valid constitutional concerns regarding the mandate. The court also found that the plaintiffs were likely to suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief and that preliminary relief would not be contrary to the public interest. The court determined that the proper scope of the preliminary injunction to be the plaintiff states: Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.</p>\r\n<p>On December 3, 2021, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Sixth Circuit and filed an emergency motion to stay the case pending appeal. On December 10, 2021, the district court denied the emergency motion for the same reasons that it granted the preliminary injunction. On December 20, the parties jointly moved to stay the proceedings in the district court pending the final resolution of the defendants' appeal of the preliminary injunction. The joint motion was granted on January 3, 2022.&nbsp;</p>",

The  vaccine  mandate  seeks  to  require  covered  contractor \nemployees to be fully vaccinated by January 18, with very minimal exceptions.  Even \nin a pandemic, “our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in the \npursuit of desirable ends.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., \n141 S. Ct. 2485, 2490 (2021) (per curiam).  The Plaintiffs therefore seek judicial relief \nfrom the President’s unlawful and unconstitutional vaccine mandate.2  \n                                            \n1 Joseph Biden, Remarks at the White House (Sept. 9, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/GQG5-\nYBXK (last visited Nov. 2, 2021). \n2 The Office of Management and Budget recently issued an updated determination scheduled to be \npublished on November 16.

The Commonwealth of Kentucky is a sovereign State of the United \nStates  of  America.    The  Commonwealth  sues  to  vindicate  its  sovereign,  quasi-\nsovereign, proprietary, and parens patriae interests.   \n2.  The Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is authorized \nto bring legal actions on behalf of the Commonwealth and its citizens.  The Attorney \nGeneral is “charged with the duty of protecting the interests of all the people,” \nHancock v. Terry Elkhorn Mining Co., 503 S.W.2d 710, 715 (Ky. 1973), including by \nensuring that government actors perform their duties lawfully, Commonwealth ex rel. \nBeshear v. Bevin, 498 S.W.3d 355, 362 (Ky. 2016).    \n3.  The Commonwealth, through its agencies and its political subdivisions, \nroutinely contracts with the federal government.   \n4.  For example, the Boone County Jail, Laurel County Jail, and Grayson \nCounty Jail all have contracts with United States Justice Department, U.S. Marshals \nService to detain, house, and transport prisoners in custody for federal crimes.   \n5.  The revenue from these contracts accounts for a significant portion of \nthese jails’ operating budgets, alleviating the burden on Kentucky taxpayers to fund \nthese facilities that are essential for ensuring public safety.   \n                                            \n1164 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (finding that an agency’s rescission of a prior rule moots any controversy \nsurrounding that prior rule).  This First Amended Complaint addresses this recent issuance, which \nattempts to assuage a barrage of criticism faced in multiple lawsuits across the nation.  Exhibit A is a \nredlined version of the original Complaint showing what has changed between this First Amended \nComplaint and the original Complaint.   \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 6 of 60 - Page ID#: 410\n6.  Each of these jails encourages vaccination for staff but does not require \nvaccination as a condition of employment.  \n7.  Multiple staff members at these jails have indicated they will end their \nemployment if forced to take a COVID-19 vaccine, which will only exacerbate the \ncurrent staffing challenges at these institutions and threaten public safety.  \n8.  The Commonwealth expects to continue pursuing federal government \ncontracts in the future.  \n9.  Upon information and belief, the Commonwealth has current contracts \nsubject to renewal or the exercise of options on or after October 15, 2021.  \n10.  The Commonwealth also has some contracts that require it to comply \nwith  all  applicable  federal  regulations  and  standards.    See  Attached  Kentucky \nContracts.  \n11.  Public employees are generally not required to be vaccinated under the \nlaws of the Commonwealth.  \n12.  The mandate threatens the Commonwealth with the loss of millions of \ndollars  in  future  contracting  opportunities  and  will  put  undue  pressure  on  the \nCommonwealth to create new policies, which threatens irreparable harm.  \nOhio Plaintiffs \n13.  The State of Ohio is a sovereign State of the United States of America.  \nOhio sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, proprietary, and parens patriae \ninterests.   \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 7 of 60 - Page ID#: 411\n14.  The Attorney General of the State of Ohio is authorized to bring legal \nactions  on  behalf  of  the  State  and  its  citizens,  and  has  been  appointed  by  the \nprosecutors of Geauga and Seneca Counties to bring legal action on behalf of both \ncounties’ sheriffs.  \n15.  On information and belief, arms of the State of Ohio routinely contract \nwith the federal government.   \n16.  For example, state universities engage in contracts and subcontracts \nthat  exceed  the  simplified  acquisition  threshold  with  multiple  federal  agencies, \nincluding the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission.   \n17.  In addition, executive bodies of the State of Ohio have contracts with \nfederal agencies that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, including the Ohio \nDepartment of Health, which contracts with the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.  See Flowers Decl. at 2.   \n18.  The State of Ohio expects to continue pursuing government contracts in \nthe future. \n19.  On  information  and belief,  the  State  of Ohio  has  current  contracts \nsubject to renewal or the exercise of options on or after October 15, 2021. \n20.  On  information  and  belief,  federal  agencies  with  contracts  or \nsubcontracts with arms of the State of Ohio have already updated certain contracts \nto incorporate the mandate.  Arms of the State have therefore been notified that they \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 8 of 60 - Page ID#: 412\nwill need to either require their employees to vaccinate or else forfeit their ability to \ncontract with the federal government. \n21.  State employees are not generally required to be vaccinated.  Certain \nstate  universities  require  employees  to  show  proof  of vaccination,  but allow  for \nbroader exemptions than the mandate.   \n22.  The mandate threatens Ohio with the loss of millions of dollars in future \ncontracting opportunities and will put undue pressure on Ohio to create new policies, \nwhich threatens imminent irreparable harm.    \n23.  Seneca County Sheriff  Fredrick W. Stevens is an elected official in \nSeneca County, Ohio, responsible for the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office.  He sues in \nhis official capacity. \n24.  Geauga County Sheriff Scott A. Hildenbrand is an elected official in \nGeauga County, Ohio, responsible for the Geauga County Sheriff’s Office.  He sues in \nhis official capacity. \n25.  The Ohio Revised Code provides that each county shall have an elected \nsheriff.  Ohio Rev. Code § 311.01. \n26.  Sheriffs are authorized to appoint deputy sheriffs, Ohio Rev. Code § \n311.04, and to hire non-deputy civilian employees to perform other functions, such as \nrunning county jails, Ohio Rev. Code § 341.05. \n27.  Sheriffs perform many functions of significant importance to the State.   \n28.  For example, sheriffs are required to protect courthouses by providing \npersonnel during all open court proceedings, Ohio Rev. Code § 311.07, and also to \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 9 of 60 - Page ID#: 413\ntransport jailed defendants to court and back to jail during proceedings, e.g., Ohio \nRev.  Code  §  2945.371.    If  they  cannot  adequately  provide  these  services,  the \nadministration of justice in Ohio will be hampered. \n29.  Sheriffs process registrations under multiple civil registration schemes \nthat record information of, and sometimes provide community notification regarding, \nthose who pose danger to the community.  These include sex-offender registration \nand notification, Ohio Rev. Code § 2950.04(D), violent-offender registration, Ohio \nRev. Code § 2903.43(A) and arsonist registration, Ohio Rev. Code § 2909.15(A).  The \nsheriff must then forward that information to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation \nand Identification (“BCI”), an office under the Attorney General, for inclusion in a \nstatewide database, with different registries for different offenders.   Ohio Rev. Code \n§ 2950.043 (sex offenders), Ohio Rev. Code § 2903.43(F) (violent offenders); Ohio Rev. \nCode  §  2909.15(E)(1)  (arsonists).    If  the  sheriffs  cannot  adequately  maintain \nregistrations and supply information to BCI, the State will be unable to maintain an \nupdated database as required by law, harming public safety. \n30.  Sheriffs operate county jails, where they hold pretrial detainees and \nconvicted offenders serving certain sentences, such as misdemeanors.  Sheriffs are \nauthorized to hold state prisoners for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and \nCorrection, and federal prisoners or detainees for federal authorities. Ohio Rev. Code \n§§ 341.21; 5120.161.  If sheriffs experience a diminution in their ability to carry out \nthese functions, the administration of justice in Ohio will suffer. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 10 of 60 - Page ID#: 414\n31.  Sheriffs  process  Ohio  citizens’  applications  for  concealed-handgun \nlicenses,  including  processing  background  checks,  and  must  forward  relevant \ninformation to state entities.  Ohio Rev. Code §§ 311.41; 2923.125.  \n32.  Sheriffs operate county-level public-safety communications systems in \nmost Ohio counties, which are then used for multi-jurisdictional communications \nwith state agencies and other local subdivisions.  Ohio Rev. Code § 307.63. \n33.  Sheriffs  deliver  absentee  ballots,  or  facilitate  delivery  by  elections \nofficials, to jailed voters, enabling them to vote while in a sheriff’s custody.  Without \nadequate sheriffs’ office staffing, jailed voters might be unable to vote.  In addition to \nharming would-be voters, that could expose the State to litigation and its attendant \ncosts.  See, e.g., Mays v. LaRose, 951 F.3d 775, 781 (6th Cir. 2020). \n34.  The  Seneca  County  Sheriff  and  Geauga  County  Sheriff  have  both \ncontracted  with  the  federal  government—in  particular,  with  the  Department  of \nHomeland Security—to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees in \ntheir county jails. \n35.  On information and belief, the Department of Homeland Security has \namended  its  contract  with  the  Seneca  County  Sheriff  to  add  a  clause  entitled \n“Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal  Contractors.”  That \nclause reads, in full: \nEnsuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors. \n(OCT 2021) (DEVIATION) \n \n(a) Definition. As used in this clause – \nUnited States or its outlying areas means— \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 11 of 60 - Page ID#: 415\n(1) The fifty States; \n(2) The District of Columbia; \n(3) The commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands; \n(4)  The  territories  of American  Samoa, Guam, and  the  United  States \nVirgin Islands; and \n(5) The minor outlying islands of Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis \nIsland, Johnston, Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, \nPalmyra Atoll, and Wake Atoll. \n \n(b) Authority. This clause implements Executive Order 14042, Ensuring Adequate \nCOVID  Safety  Protocols  for  Federal  Contractors,  dated  September  9,  2021 \n(published in the Federal Register on September 14, 2021, 86 FR 50985). \n \n(c) Compliance. The Contractor shall comply with all guidance, including guidance \nconveyed  through  Frequently  Asked  Questions,  as  amended  during  the \nperformance of this contract, for contractor workplace locations published by the \nSafer  Federal  Workforce  Task  Force  (Task  Force  Guidance)  at \nhttps://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/. \n \n(d)  Subcontracts.  The  Contractor  shall  include  the  substance  of  this  clause, \nincluding this paragraph (d), in subcontracts at any tier that exceed the simplified \nacquisition threshold, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation 2.101 on the \ndate of subcontract award, and are for services, including construction, performed \nin whole or in part within the United States or its outlying areas. \n \n36.  Entities subject to the mandate must either give up their contracts (or \ntheir ability to compete for future contracts) or mandate vaccination among their \nstaffs. \n37.  The Seneca County Sheriff and the Geauga County Sheriff will lose staff \nif they mandate vaccination. \n38.  The State of Ohio will be affected if sheriffs cannot perform, or cannot \nperform adequately, the many functions that sheriffs serve, including those detailed \nabove. \n39.  Sheriffs’ deputies and non-deputy employees are generally, with few \nexceptions, included in Ohio’s classified civil service.  Ohio Rev. Code § 124.01(C); \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 12 of 60 - Page ID#: 416\nYarosh v. Becane, 63 Ohio St. 2d 5 (1980).  That means that deputies and other \nemployees whose service is terminated may appeal that action to the State Personnel \nBoard of Review, a state agency, and to the state courts.  Ohio Rev. Code §§ 124.03; \n124.06. \n40.  If deputies and non-deputy employees are terminated because of the \nmandate, the State will then expend both agency and judicial resources resolving \nsuch claims. \nTennessee Plaintiffs \n41.  The State of Tennessee is a sovereign State of the United States of \nAmerica.  Tennessee sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, proprietary, and \nparens patriae interests. \n42.  The  Attorney  General  and  Reporter  of  the  State  of  Tennessee  is \nauthorized to bring legal actions on behalf of the State and its citizens.   \n43.  The  State  of  Tennessee,  through  its  agencies  and  its  political \nsubdivisions, routinely contracts with the federal government.   \n44.  The  State  of  Tennessee,  through  its  agencies  and  its  political \nsubdivisions, engages in a wide range of federal contracts, including but not limited \nto those that relate to staffing assistance, research, regulatory program agreements, \nleases of and access to federal real property, and agreements for data and information \nsharing. These contracts benefit millions of Tennesseans by providing vital services \nand resources.  \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 13 of 60 - Page ID#: 417\n45.  The  State  of  Tennessee  expects  to  continue  pursuing  government \ncontracts in the future. \n46.  The State of Tennessee has current contracts subject to renewal or the \nexercise of options after October 15, 2021. \n47.  Public employees are generally not required to be vaccinated under the \nlaws of the State of Tennessee.  \n48.  The mandate threatens the State of Tennessee with the loss of millions \nof dollars in future contracting opportunities and will put undue pressure on the State \nof Tennessee to create new polices, which threatens irreparable harm.  \nAllegations pertaining to the States generally \n49.

The contractor vaccine mandate harms the Plaintiff States beyond the \ndirect harms that flow from the fact that certain agencies and political subdivisions \nof the States are contractors subject to the mandate, including but not limited to the \nfollowing: \na.    Because the mandate claims to preempt all contrary State law, it \ninjures  the  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and  parens  patriae \ninterests to set their own laws regarding workplace issues that would otherwise \napply to contractors within the States’ borders.  \nb.    Because the mandate claims to preempt all contrary State law, it \ninjures  the  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and  parens  patriae \ninterests to set their own laws regarding public health orders. \nc.    Because the mandate claims to preempt all contrary State law, it \ninjures  the  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and  parens  patriae \ninterests to set their own laws regarding workforce vaccination policies under \ntheir “police power—a power which the state did not surrender when becoming a \nmember of the Union under the Constitution.”  Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 \nU.S. 11, 24–25 (1905).   \nd.    The  mandate  requires  employees  to  prove  vaccination  status  with \ndocumentation, and on information and belief, agencies of the Plaintiff States \noften possess such documentation.  A predictable consequence of the mandate is \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 16 of 60 - Page ID#: 420\nthus to increase the number of people seeking documentation from the States \nregarding vaccination status.  See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 \n(2019).   \ne.    On information and belief, a natural predictable consequence of the \nmandate is that numerous employees may be fired, retire, or quit their jobs.  An \nABC News poll shows that almost 70% of unvaccinated Americans would quit \ntheir jobs if a vaccine mandate were required and their exemption were denied.4  \nFrom an employer’s perspective, 9 in 10 large employers fear reductions in their \nworkforces if they have to implement vaccine mandates.5  This injures the Plaintiff \nStates’ quasi-sovereign and parens patriae interest in the economic well-being of \ntheir citizens.   \nf.    On information and belief, a natural and predictable consequence of \nthe mandate is that employers who are critical to the supply chain, and are also \nfederal contractors, will likely lose significant numbers of employees.  It is entirely \npredictable, therefore, that the mandate will exacerbate current supply chain \nissues.  As a result, prices will continue to rise and cause direct injuries to the \nPlaintiff States as purchasers.  It will also harm their quasi-sovereign parens \n                                            \n4 Jordan Burrows, Employees Not Given Exemption Prefer to Quit Job Than Get COVID Vaccine, Poll \nShows, Salt Lake City (ABC4) (Sept. 15, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/6A95-CJXD (last visited \nNov. 2, 2021). \n5 Karl Evers-Hillstrom, 9 in 10 Employers Say They Fear They'll Lose Unvaccinated Workers Over \nMandate: Survey, The Hill (Oct. 18, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/V5ZJ-7XUQ (last visited Nov. \n2, 2021); see also Society for Human Resource Management, SHRM Surveys Reveal Employers’ Anxiety \nOver Vaccine Mandate, available at https://perma.cc/R2A2-BVKF (last visited Nov. 3, 2021).  \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 17 of 60 - Page ID#: 421\npatriae interest in the economic well-being of their residents, who will suffer from \nfurther supply chain disruptions.6   \ng.    The mandate unfairly discriminates between citizens of the Plaintiff \nStates  who  are  vaccinated  and  those  who  are  not,  thus  denying  the  latter \nemployment opportunities available to the former.

In the aftermath of World War II, during which the federal government \namassed a substantial amount of war supplies and other property, there was an \nevident need for “an improved and efficient property management program,” H.R. \nRep. No. 81-670, at 1475, and an overhaul of the internal “housekeeping” activities of \nthe world’s largest buyer of goods and services, id. at 1476.  As one member of \nCongress explained, the federal procurement system was “largely uncoordinated, to \nsome extent duplicative,” and in desperate need of reform.  95 Cong. Rec. 7441 (daily \ned. June 8, 1949) (remarks of Rep. Holifield).  \n83.  Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act \nof 1949 (“FPASA”) “to provide the [f]ederal [g]overnment with an economical and \nefficient  system”  for  certain  enumerated  activities,  including  “[p]rocuring  and \nsupplying property and nonpersonal services,” “establish[ing] . . . pools or systems of \ntransportation  of  [g]overnment  personnel,”  and  “manag[ing]  of  public  utility \nservices.”  40 U.S.C. § 101. \n84.  To  effectuate  the  FPASA,  Congress  authorized  the  President  to \n“prescribe policies and directives that the President considers necessary to carry out” \nthat statute.  Id. at § 121(a).  Notably, Congress did not authorize the President to \nissue regulations with the force or effect of law, as it authorized the General Services \nAdministrator to do.  Compare id. at § 121(a) (“prescribe policies and directives”), \nwith id. at § 121(c) (“prescribe regulations”). \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 24 of 60 - Page ID#: 428\n85.  Over time, however, the FPASA proved inadequate to control the lack of \ncoordination across agencies, and the proliferation of procurement regulations by \ndifferent agencies led to a morass of legal requirements.7  In 1979, Congress directed \nthe Office of Federal Procurement Policy—part of the Office of Management and \nBudget—to “issue policy directives . . . for the purpose of promoting the development \nand implementation of [a] uniform procurement system,” with concurrence of the \nOffice of Management and Budget’s Director. See Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy Amendments of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-83, § 4(e), 93 Stat. 650. \n86.  In 1983, under the policy directive of the Administrator of the Office of \nFederal  Procurement  Policy,  the  Department  of  Defense,  General  Services \nAdministration,  and  NASA  jointly  promulgated  the  first  version  of  the  Federal \nAcquisition Regulation.  48 Fed. Reg. 42,102 (Sept. 19, 1983). \n87.  Even after creation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, however, \n“[r]edundancies  and  inconsistencies  continue[d]  to  exist  between  the  [Federal \nAcquisition Regulation] and agency supplementing regulations implementing the \nRegulation.” S. Rep. No. 100–424, at 13–14 (quoting study prepared by Office of \nManagement and Budget Director Tom Daley (Nov. 1986)).   \n88.  Finally, in 1988, after decades of failure by executive-branch officials, \nCongress established the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council “to assist in the \ndirection  and  coordination  of  [g]overnment-wide  procurement  policy  and \n                                            \n7 See generally Kate M.

L. No. 100-679, \n§ 3, 102 Stat. 4056, later codified at 41 U.S.C. § 1302(a).8    \n89.    The FAR Council consists of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy \nAdministrator, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of NASA, and the General \nServices Administration Administrator.  41 U.S.C. § 1302(b).  \n90.  Subject to limited exceptions, the FAR Council has exclusive authority \nto issue “a single [g]overnment-wide procurement regulation, to be known as the \nFederal Acquisition Regulation.”  Id. at § 1303(a)(1).  No other agency is authorized \nto issue government-wide procurement regulations.  Id. at § 1303(a)(2).   \n91.  Finally, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act further protects \nCongress’s  reforms  to  government-procurement  practices  by  requiring  that  any \n“procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form”—whether issued government-\nwide by the FAR Council or for one agency by that agency—be subject to notice and \ncomment.  41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)–(b).  More specifically, this Act requires that:  \n[A] procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an \namendment or modification thereto) may not take effect until 60 days \nafter it is published for public comment in the Federal Register . . . if \nit—(A) relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds; and (B)(i) has a \nsignificant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency \nissuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form; or (ii) has a significant \ncost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.   \n \n                                            \n8 See S. Rep. No. 100–424, at 4 (“[The Office of Federal Procurement Policy]’s performance as the \n[f]ederal [g]overment’s procurement policy leader has been uneven. . . . [M]any of the procurement \nexecutives,  industry  officials  and  other  procurement  experts . . . rated  [the  Office]’s  overall \nperformance during this as being no more than marginally [e]ffective.” (quoting Assessment of the \nOffice of Federal Procurement Policy, GAO/NSIAD–88–35 (No. 1987))).   \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 26 of 60 - Page ID#: 430\nId. at § 1707(a).  The relevant official may waive that requirement only if “urgent and \ncompelling circumstances make compliance with the requirements impracticable.”  \nId. at § 1707(d). \nRelevant Federal Government Actions \n  Creation of the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force \n92.  On his first day in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 13991, \nwhich created the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force to provide “ongoing guidance \nto heads of agencies on the operation of the Federal Government, the safety of its \nemployees,  and  the  continuity  of  Government  functions  during  the  COVID-19 \npandemic.”  86 Fed. Reg. 7,045, 7,046 (Jan. 20, 2021).  The Executive Order also \nrequires  that  the  General  Services  Administration  “provide  funding  and \nadministrative support for the” Task Force.  Id.  Three co-chairs oversee the Task \nForce: (1) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, Defendant Ahuja; (2) \nthe Administrator of the General Services Administration, Defendant Carnahan; and \n(3) the COVID-19  Response Coordinator, Defendant Zients.  Defendants Young, \nPatterson, Murray, Criswell, Walensky are also members of the Task Force. \nExecutive Order 14042 \n93.  On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced his “new plan to \nrequire  more  Americans  to  be  vaccinated”  by  imposing  “new  vaccination \nrequirements.”  Joseph Biden, Remarks at the White House (Sept. 9, 2021), available \nat https://perma.cc/GQG5-YBXK. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 27 of 60 - Page ID#: 431\n94.  President Biden further declared that he would “sign an executive order \nthat will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinated” and \n“another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the same.”  Id. \n95.  On that same day, President Biden signed Executive Order 14042.  86 \nFed. Reg. 50,985 (Sept. 9, 2021). \n96.  The Executive Order relies on the FPASA, as well as the Constitution \nand the President’s power under 3 U.S.C. § 301 to delegate his statutory authorities.  \nId. at 50,985.  \n97.  The  Executive  Order  requires  departments  and  agencies,  including \nindependent establishments, to require contractors and subcontractors to “comply \nwith all guidance for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations published by \nthe Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, provided that the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget approves the Task Force Guidance and determines that the \nGuidance . . . will promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting.”  Id.  \n98.  The Executive Order required the Task Force to issue this guidance by \nSeptember 24, 2021, and directs the OMB Director, pursuant to the President’s \ndelegation of his power under the FPASA, to determine whether the Task Force \nguidance will promote economy and efficiency in federal procurement.  Id. at 50,985–\n86.   \n99.  The  Executive  Order  applies  to  new  contracts,  contract-like \ninstruments,  new  solicitations  for  contracts  or  contract-like  instruments,  and \nextensions or renewals of contracts or contract-like instruments if the extension or \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 28 of 60 - Page ID#: 432\nrenewal occurred on or after October 15, 2021.  Id. at 50,987.  The Executive Order \nexempts certain contracts such as those with a value below “the simplified acquisition \nthreshold,” which is typically $250,000.  Id. at 50,986–87; FAR § 2.101. \n100.  The Executive Order also authorized the Task Force to update guidance \non a continuing basis, subject to re-approval by the OMB Director.9  86 Fed. Reg. at \n50,985 (noting the “contract or subcontractor shall, for the duration of the contract, \ncomply  with  all  guidance  for  contractor  or  subcontractor  workplace  locations \npublished by” the Task Force). \nThe Task Force Guidance Issued on September 24, 2021 \n \n101.

The “deviation clause” attached to the FAR Council Guidance provides \ntext federal contractors should use to mandate compliance with the Task Force \nGuidance:  \n(c)  Compliance.  The  Contractor  shall  comply  with  all  guidance, \nincluding guidance conveyed through Frequently Asked Questions, as \namended  during  the  performance  of  this  contract,  for  contractor  or \nsubcontractor  workplace  locations  published  by  the  Safer  Federal \nWorkforce  Task  Force  (Task  Force  Guidance)  at \nhttps:/www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/ \n(d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this \nclause, including this paragraph (d), in subcontracts at any tier that \nexceed  the  simplified  acquisition  threshold,  as  defined  in  Federal \nAcquisition Regulation 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, and are \nfor services, including construction, performed in whole or in part within \nthe United States or its outlying areas.  \nId. at 5.  \n114.  A deviation clause is a clause that is inconsistent with the FAR.  FAR \n1.401.   The FAR prescribes procedures for both individual deviations and class \ndeviations.  Id. at 1.403–04.   \n115.  The FAR Council did not publish its guidance in the Federal Register \nfor the purpose of receiving public comment. \n116.  Deviations are not an appropriate manner to implement a government-\nwide procurement policy such as the purported “procurement” policy at issue here.  \nInstead,  “[w]hen  an  agency  knows  that  it  will  require  a  class  deviation  on  a \npermanent basis, it should propose a [Federal Acquisition Regulation] revision.”  FAR \n1.404.   \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 33 of 60 - Page ID#: 437\n117.  The  deviation  clause  attached  to  the  FAR  Council  Guidance  cites \nExecutive Order 14042 as its sole authority and contains little substantive content \nother than requiring contractors and subcontractors to comply with the Task Force \nGuidance published on the Task Force’s website, even if that guidance is amended \nduring performance of the contract.  FAR Council Guidance, 4–5.   \n118.  The FAR Council Guidance “reminds” agencies that, under Executive \nOrder 14042, they are “required to include an implementing clause” in new contracts \nawarded on or after November 14, 2021, new solicitations issued on or after October \n15, 2021, and options on existing contracts exercised on or after October 15, 2021.  Id. \nat 2.   \n119.  Executive Order 14042 requires the FAR Council to amend the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation to require all contracts subject to Executive Order 14042 \ninclude whatever guidance is or may later be imposed by the Task Force and approved \nby OMB.  The FAR Council “has opened a case (FAR Case 2021-021, Ensuring \nAdequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors) to make appropriate \namendments in the FAR to reflect the requirements of the order.”  FAR Council \nGuidance at 3.   \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 34 of 60 - Page ID#: 438\nThe Office of Management and Budget Determination on November \n10, 2021 \n \n120.  In response to a plethora of lawsuits across the nation, the OMB issued \na post hoc rationalization for the vaccine mandate on November 10.  See Post Hoc \nOMB Determination.  The Post Hoc OMB Determination approves the November \nTask Force Guidance, exercising the President’s delegated authority under FPASA.  \n121.  The Post Hoc OMB Determination replicates the OMB’s finding in its \nInitial  OMB  Determination  “that  compliance  by  Federal  contractors  and \nsubcontractors  with  the  [Task  Force  Guidance]  .  .  .  will  promote  economy  and \nefficiency in Federal contracting by reducing absenteeism and decreasing labor costs \nfor  contractors  and  subcontractors  working  on  or  in  connection  with  a  Federal \nGovernment contract[.]” \n122.  The Post Hoc OMB Determination invites comment but does not comply \nwith the procedural requirements under either 41 U.S.C. § 1707 or 5 U.S.C. § 553.  \n123.  Instead, the Post Hoc OMB Determination is effective immediately, on \nthe purported basis that “[u]rgent and compelling circumstances justify waiving the \nnotice-and-comment  requirement.”    Despite  the  Post  Hoc  OMB  Determination \npushing the deadline for covered employees to be fully vaccinated by a month-and-a-\nhalf, the purported urgent and compelling circumstance for bypassing procedural \nrequirements is that the “pandemic continues to present an imminent threat to the \nhealth and safety of the American people.”   \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 35 of 60 - Page ID#: 439\n124.  And, although the Task Force guidance has no weight until mandated \nby an entity pursuant to legal authority—legal authority that comes with procedural \nprotections—the Post Hoc OMB Determination uses the Task Force’s manufactured \nJanuary 18 deadline as reason for bypassing federal procedural requirements.  \n125.  After describing the shifting vaccine mandate created by the Task Force, \nincluding  the  new  January  18  deadline  for  vaccination,  the  Post  Hoc  OMB \nDetermination provides an “Economy-And-Efficiency Analysis.”     \n126.  Primarily,  OMB  believes  that  existing  CDC  guidance,  which \nrecommends that symptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19 to isolate for ten \ndays, could cause infected employees to miss many days of work, which could pass on \ncosts to the Federal Government.  OMB discounts contracting inefficiencies caused \nby the vaccine mandate, including by dismissing the likelihood of worker shortages \nas “anecdotal.”    \nScope of Mandates \n127.  The  United  States  Department  of  Labor  recognizes  that  “workers \nemployed by federal contractors” comprise “approximately one-fifth of the entire U.S. \nlabor force.”  DOL, History of Executive Order 11246, Office of Contract Compliance \nPrograms,  available  at  https://perma.cc/6ZXJ-WGR8  (last  visited  Nov.  2,  2021) \n(emphasis added).  This includes similarly large proportions of the labor force in each \nof the States.   \n128.  The November Task Force Guidance’s definitions section highlights the \ncontractor vaccine mandate’s broad scope. \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 36 of 60 - Page ID#: 440\n129.  “[C]overed contractor employee” refers to “any full-time or part-time \nemployee of a covered contractor working on or in connection with a covered contract \nor working at a covered contractor workplace.  This includes employees of covered \ncontractors  who  are  not  themselves  working  on  or  in  connection  with  a  covered \ncontract.”  November Task Force Guidance, 3–4 (emphasis added).   \n130.  “[I]n  connection  with”  includes  “[e]mployees  who  perform  duties \nnecessary  to  the  performance  of  the  covered  contract,  but  who  are  not  directly \nengaged in performing the specific work called for by the covered contract, such as \nhuman resources, billing, and legal review.”  November Task Force Guidance at 9 \n(follow FAQ link, then click the “Scope and Applicability of Task Force Guidance for \nFederal Contractors” Tab to find this definition) (emphasis added). \n131.  A  contractor  or  subcontractor  workplace  location  “means  a  location \nwhere covered contract employees work, including a covered contractor workplace or \nFederal workplace.”  November Task Force Guidance at 3. \n132.  “Covered  contractor  workplace”  “means  a  location  controlled  by  a \ncovered contractor at which any employee of a covered contractor working on or in \nconnection  with  a  covered  contract  is  likely  to  be  present  during  the  period  of \nperformance for a covered contract.  A covered contractor workplace does not include \na covered contractor employee’s residence.”  Id. at 4 (emphasis added).   \n133.  “[L]ocations”  to  which  the  mandate  applies  includes  “contractor  or \nsubcontractor  workplace  locations  that  are  outdoors.”    November  Task  Force \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 37 of 60 - Page ID#: 441\nGuidance  at  9  (follow  FAQ  link,  then  click  the  “Workplaces”  Tab  to  find  this \ndefinition). \n134.  Furthermore, “unless a covered contractor can affirmatively determine \nthat none of its employees on another floor or in separate areas of the building will \ncome  into  contact  with  a  covered  contractor  employee  during  the  period  of \nperformance,” employees in other areas of the building site or facility are also a part \nof the covered contractor workplace.  Id.   \n135.  “Contact” includes “interactions” in “common areas,” such as “elevators,” \n“stairwells,” “kitchens,” and “parking garages.”  Id.   \n136.  And if an employee is working completely remotely, but working on a \ncovered  federal  contract,  the  employee  still  “must  comply  with  the  vaccination \nrequirement . . . even if the employee never works at either a covered contractor \nworkplace or Federal workplace during the performance of the contract.”  Id.   \n137.  Under  the  November  Task  Force  Guidance,  the  contractor  or \nsubcontractor is responsible for ensuring that a covered contractor employee is fully \nvaccinated.  The contractor or subcontractor “must review its covered employees’ \ndocumentation to prove vaccination status.”  November Task Force Guidance, 5–6.  \nSpecifically,  the  subcontractor  or  contractor  must  require  covered  contractor \nemployees to show or provide their employer with one of several documents.  Id. \n138.  The November Task Force Guidance “strongly encourage[s]” contractors \nto “incorporate similar vaccination requirements into their non-covered contracts and \nagreements with non-covered contractors whose employees perform work at covered \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 38 of 60 - Page ID#: 442\ncontractor workplaces” but are not otherwise involved with a federal contract.  Id. at \n6.   \nNegative Effects of the Mandate \n139.  Today, citizens of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee face the prospect of \nlosing their jobs and livelihoods due to an unprecedented power grab by the Federal \ngovernment.  It is hardly a choice to tell a single mother that she must be vaccinated \nor lose the financial resources to feed her children. \n140.  If left in place, the mandates will result in citizens of Kentucky, Ohio, \nand Tennessee turning to public benefit programs for unemployment compensation, \nfood assistance, healthcare, and basic needs. \nCOUNT I \nAgency action contrary to law and in excess of authority \n(Post Hoc OMB Determination) \n \n141.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n142.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court must “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action” that is “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of \nstatutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C).   \n143.  The Post Hoc OMB Determination approving the Task Force Guidance \nis contrary to law for at least four reasons. \n144.  First, the Post Hoc OMB Determination violates 41 U.S.C. § 1303(a) \nbecause it is a government-wide procurement regulation, which only the FAR Council \nmay issue.  \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 39 of 60 - Page ID#: 443\n145.  Executive  Order  14042  apparently  seeks  to  circumvent  §  1303  by \ndelegating the President’s authority under the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act to the Office of Management and Budget Director.  \n146.  But  the  President  has  no  authority  to  issue  regulations  under  the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act—only the FAR Council may issue \ngovernment-wide procurement regulations.  See Centralizing Border Control Pol’y \nUnder the Supervision of the Att’y Gen., 26 Op. OLC 22, 23 (2002) (“Congress may \nprescribe that a particular executive function may be performed only by a designated \nofficial within the Executive Branch, and not by the President.”). \n147.  Second, and relatedly, the Post Hoc OMB Determination is contrary to \nlaw because the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act does not grant the \nPresident  the  power  to  issue  orders  with  the  force  or  effect  of  law.    Congress \nauthorized the President only to “prescribe policies and directives that the President \nconsiders necessary to carry out” 40 U.S.C. § 121(a).  \n148.  “Policies and directives” describe the President’s power to direct the \nexercise of procurement authority throughout the government.  It does not authorize \nthe President to issue regulations himself.  \n149.  Congress knows how to confer that power, as it authorized the General \nServices  Administration  Administrator—in  the  same  section  of  the  statute—to \n“prescribe regulations.”  Id. at § 121(c); see also Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. \n692, 711 n.9 (2004) (“[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 40 of 60 - Page ID#: 444\nstatute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were \nintended.”).  \n150.  And  Congress  has  given  the  President  the  power  to  “prescribe \nregulations” in other contexts, typically in the realm of foreign affairs and national \ndefense.  E.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3496 (“The President is authorized to prescribe regulations \ngoverning the manner of executing and returning commissions by consular officers.”); \n32  U.S.C.  §  110  (“The  President  shall  prescribe  regulations,  and  issue  orders, \nnecessary to organize, discipline, and govern the National Guard.”). \n151.  Third, even if the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act \nauthorized the President to issue orders with the force or effect of law, it would not \nauthorize OMB’s approval of the November Task Force Guidance.  The President \nappears to assume that the FPASA’s prefatory statement of purpose authorizes him \nto  issue  any  order  that  he  believes  promotes  “an  economical  and  efficient” \nprocurement system.  40 U.S.C. § 101; see Exec. Order No. 14042, 86 Fed. Reg. at \n50,985 (“This order promotes economy and efficiency in [f]ederal procurement.”).  In \ndoing so, the President mistakenly construes the prefatory purpose statement for a \ngrant of authority.  Dist. of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 578 (2008) (“[A]part \nfrom [a] clarifying function, a prefatory clause does not limit or expand the scope of \nthe operative clause.”).  \n152.  And even if the FPASA did authorize the President to issue binding \nprocurement orders solely because they may promote economy and efficiency, the \ncursory Post Hoc OMB Determination does not adequately explain or support how \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 41 of 60 - Page ID#: 445\nthe Task Force Guidance actually leads to better economy and efficiency.  Moreover, \nCongress’s charge to provide the federal government with an economic and efficient \nsystem for procurement is not a broad enough delegation to impose a national-scale \nvaccine mandate that it has not separately authorized.  Additionally, Executive Order \n14042 is divorced from the practical needs of procurement.  It will exclude otherwise \ncompetitive bidders and cause contractors to suffer labor shortages. \n153.  Fourth,  the  Post  Hoc  OMB  Determination  is  inconsistent  with  the \nrequirements of the Competition in Contracting Act, which requires federal agencies \nto “provide for full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures.”  \n41 U.S.C. § 3301; see 40 U.S.C. § 121(a) (requiring “policies” issued by the President \npursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act to be “consistent \nwith this subtitle”); id. at § 111 (defining “this subtitle” in 40 U.S.C. § 121(a) as to \nalso refer to division C (except §§ 3302, 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of \nsubtitle I of title 41).  The Post Hoc OMB Determination precludes an entire class of \ncontractors from obtaining federal contracts without regard to their capability to \nperform the contract.  That is unlawful.  See Nat’l Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. United States, \n923 F.3d 977, 986 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (finding invalid an agency policy that “effectively \nexclude[ed] an offeror from winning an award, even if that offeror represent[ed] the \nbest value to the government”).   \n154.  Because the Post Hoc OMB Determination adopting the Task Force \nGuidance violates § 1303(a), seeks to exercise a delegated power the President does \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 42 of 60 - Page ID#: 446\nnot possess, and relies on a misreading of the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act, it is contrary to law. \nCOUNT II \nAgency action contrary to law and in excess of authority \n(FAR Council Guidance) \n \n155.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n156.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court must “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action” that is “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of \nstatutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C).   \n157.  While  the  FAR  Council  claims  to  be  issuing  only  “guidance,”  the \nguidance is being “applied . . . in a way that indicates it is binding.”  Texas v. EEOC, \n933 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir. 2019).  It is therefore reviewable. \n158.  The FAR Council Guidance does not explain what authority enables the \nFederal Acquisition Regulatory Council to create a government-wide procurement \nregulation mandating vaccines for contractors.  To the extent the FAR Council relies \non the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, it lacks that authority for \nthe reasons described in Count I.   \nCOUNT III \nFailure to conduct notice and comment \n(Post Hoc OMB Determination) \n \n159.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 43 of 60 - Page ID#: 447\n160.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court must “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n161.  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)(1),13 a procurement policy may not take \neffect until 60 days after it is published for public comment in the Federal Register if \nit relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds and has a significant effect beyond \nthe internal operating procedures of the issuing agency or has a significant cost or \nadministrative impact on contractors or offerors. \n162.  Federal agencies will have to expend appropriated funds to compensate \ncontractors  for the  increased  cost  of compliance  with the  mandates imposed  by \nExecutive Order 14042 and the Task Force Guidance.  See 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)(1)(A). \n163.  These mandates have a significant effect beyond internal operating \nprocedures in that they require the vaccination of millions of Americans.  See id. at \n§ 1707(a)(1)(B)(i).  \n164.  These mandates also have a significant cost or administrative impact on \nboth  current  contractors,  future  contractors,  and  offerors  in  managing  the \nimplementation of the mandates.  See id. § 1707(a)(1)(B)(ii).   \n165.  Although Defendants published the Initial OMB Determination in the \nFederal Register, they failed to similarly publish the underlying Task Force Guidance \nthere.  See 41 U.S.C. § 1707.   \n                                            \n13 Plaintiffs invoke both 41 U.S.C. § 1707 and 5 U.S.C. § 553, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D), but focus on § \n1707 because it is more stringent.   \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 44 of 60 - Page ID#: 448\n166.  Moreover, Defendants failed to provide the required 60-day comment \nperiod before the Initial OMB Determination (which adopts the Task Force Guidance) \nbecame effective.   \n167.  Further, the requirements of 41 U.S.C. § 1707 were never waived with \nregard to these promulgated documents, nor could they be, consistent with law. \n168.  Additionally, pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 1.501, “significant revisions” to the \nFederal  Acquisition  Regulation  must  be  made  through  notice-and-comment \nprocedures.  But, instead of amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the OMB \nissued  a  purported  “Notice  of  determination”  without  engaging  in  notice  and \ncomment.   \n169.  Accordingly, Defendants failed to comply with 41 U.S.C. § 1707 and 48 \nC.F.R. § 1.501 when issuing the Initial OMB Determination, making the imposed \nmandates invalid as a matter of law.  \n170.  On November 10, 2021, the OMB, seemingly recognizing these defects, \nissued its Post Hoc OMB Determination.   \n171.  The Post Hoc OMB Determination is set to be published in the Federal \nRegister on November 16, 2021.   \n172.  The  Post  Hoc  OMB  Determination  concludes  that  “[u]rgent  and \ncompelling circumstances justify waiving the notice-and-comment requirement for \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 45 of 60 - Page ID#: 449\nthis notice,” at the same time that the Post Hoc OMB Determination concludes that \n“[it is] soliciting comment on all subjects of this determination[.]”   \n173.  The OMB Determination also purports to waive the 60-day delayed \neffectiveness requirement of § 1707(a)(1).  \n174.  Although the notice-and-comment and delayed-effectiveness deadlines \n“may be waived by the officer authorized to issue a procurement policy, regulation, \nprocedure, or form if urgent and compelling circumstances make compliance with the \nrequirements  impracticable[,]”  see  28  U.S.C.  §  1707(d),  the  Post  Hoc  OMB \nDetermination does not make that showing.  This is particularly evident by the fact \nthat, in the same breath that the Post Hoc OMB Determination concludes that \n“urgent  and  compelling  circumstances  .  .  .  warrant  making  this  determination \nimmediately effective[,]” the Post Hoc OMB Determination also pushes back the \nmandate’s compliance date from December 8 to January 14.   \n175.  Finally, the Post Hoc OMB Determination cannot purport to make itself \ntemporarily effective under Section 1707(e) without validly instituting a Section \n1707(d) waiver.    \nCOUNT IV \nFailure to conduct notice and comment \n(FAR Council Guidance) \n \n176.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n177.  For the same reasons discussed in Count III, the FAR Council Guidance \nis invalid. \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 46 of 60 - Page ID#: 450\n178.  Additionally, the FAR Council issued a purported “class deviation” not \nonly without engaging in notice and comment but also without publication in the \nFederal Register.   \n179.  Accordingly, Defendants failed to comply with 41 U.S.C. § 1707 and 48 \nC.F.R.  §  1.501  when  issuing  the  FAR  Council  Guidance,  making  the  imposed \nmandates invalid as a matter of law.  \nCOUNT V \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n(Post Hoc OMB Determination) \n180.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n181.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, agency action that is \n“arbitrary [or] capricious” is unlawful and must be set aside by a court of competent \njurisdiction.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n182.  The Initial OMB Determination (and underlying Task Force Guidance) \nwere implemented with no express findings, no explanation, and no consideration of \nthe distinct and diverse universe of federal agencies.  All of this evinces the pretext \nbehind  the  promulgation  and  Defendants’  unreasoned  decision-making  leading \nthereto.  \n183.  OMB failed to conduct its own independent analysis and heavily relied \non the Task Force Guidance.  But the Guidance does not display reasoned decision-\nmaking.  Instead, the Guidance ignores important aspects surrounding the mandate, \nincluding but not limited to economic impacts, cost to States, cost to citizens, labor-\nforce  and  supply-chain  disruptions,  the  current  risks  of  COVID-19,  and  basic \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 47 of 60 - Page ID#: 451\ndistinctions among workers such as those with natural immunity to COVID-19 and \nthose who work remotely or with limited in-person contacts, among other aspects. \n184.  Furthermore, pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 1.402, “[u]nless precluded by law, \nexecutive order, or regulation, deviations from the [Federal Acquisition Regulation] \nmay be granted [] when necessary to meet the specific needs and requirements of each \nagency.” \n185.  The  Initial  OMB  Determination  imposes  universal  and  uniform \nrequirements without regard to the particularized needs and circumstances of each \nfederal agency and is therefore arbitrary and capricious. \n186.  Again, recognizing these problems, the OMB issued its Post Hoc OMB \nDetermination in an attempt to address them.   \n187.  Although the Post Hoc OMB Determination purports to include six \npages of an “Economy-and-Efficiency Analysis,” see Post Hoc OMB Determination at \n14–20, that analysis does not address the issues previously pointed out and only \nfurther highlights the arbitrary and capricious nature of the mandate.  Moreover, the \nPost Hoc OMB Determination overemphasized harm discussed in the CDC guidance, \nnot by the status of having unvaccinated workers in the workforce, and by irrationally \ndismissing the harm of worker shortage.   \n188.  For example, the analysis makes no mention of the transmissibility of \nCOVID–19 in outdoor settings and, in fact, concludes only that “COVID–19 is a highly \ncommunicable disease that tends to spread between people who are indoors, sharing \nspace, and in close quarters[.]”  Post Hoc OMB Determination at 16.  Yet, the FAQs \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 48 of 60 - Page ID#: 452\non the Task Force website that the Post Hoc OMB Determination incorporates make \nclear that the mandate “applies to contractor or subcontractor workplace locations \nthat are outdoors.”  \n189.  As another example, the totality of the data that the analysis relies on \nfor its suggestion that workers will not actually quit if faced with a vaccine mandate \nis data reported by three major United States companies, one of which did not \nindicate  whether  workers  quit  (Tyson)  and  one  of  which  placed  unvaccinated \nemployees  on  administrative  leave  (Kaiser  Permanente).    The  Post  Hoc  OMB \nDetermination does not explain why this data is an appropriate sample size of the \ntotality of federal contractors and subcontractors.   \nCOUNT VI \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n(FAR Council Guidance) \n190.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n191.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, agency action that is \n“arbitrary [or] capricious” is unlawful and must be set aside by a court of competent \njurisdiction.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n192.  For the same reasons discussed in Count V, the FAR Council Guidance, \nwhich has not been updated since its initial issuance, is invalid. \nCOUNT VII \nPresident’s Ultra Vires Action  \n \n193.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n45 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 49 of 60 - Page ID#: 453\n194.  There  is  a  nonstatutory  cause  of  action  to  challenge  unlawful \nprocurement-related actions by the President.  See Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, \n74 F.3d 1322, 1330 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n195.  The purpose of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act is \nto provide the Federal Government with an “economic and efficient system” for, \namong other things, procuring and supplying property and nonpersonal services.  40 \nU.S.C. § 101.   Those activities include  “[p]rocuring and supplying property  and \nnonpersonal services,” use and disposal of property, and records management.  Id. \n196.  Congress did not contemplate or design the FPASA as a public health \nstatute, to impose a sweeping vaccination mandate on broad swaths of the American \npeople. \n197.  The FPASA empowers the President to “prescribe policies and directives \nthat [he] considers necessary to carry out [the FPASA].”  40 U.S.C. § 121(a).  Those \npolicies “must be consistent with” the FPASA’s purpose, i.e., promoting economy and \nefficiency in federal contracting.  Id. at § 121(a) (emphasis added).   \n198.  The Executive Order, and resulting Task Force Guidance, Initial OMB \nDetermination, FAR Council Guidance, and Post Hoc OMB Determination all fail to \ndemonstrate  a  nexus  between  a  vaccine  mandate  and  the  FPASA’s  purpose  of \npromoting an “economic and efficient system” for federal contracting.  40 U.S.C. § \n101; see Am. Fed’n of Lab. & Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784, 793 (D.C. \nCir. 1979) (explaining that the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act is \n46 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 50 of 60 - Page ID#: 454\nviolated when the President does not demonstrate a “nexus” between executive action \nand the FPASA’s policy).  \n199.  Further,  before  the  executive  branch  may  regulate  a  major  policy \nquestion of “great and economic and political significance”—such as responding to the \nCOVID-19  pandemic—Congress  must  “speak  clearly”  to  assign  the  authority  to \nimplement such a policy.  Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. E.P.A., 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) \n(quoting Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n159 (2000)).   \n200.  Executive Order 14042 exceeds the President’s Federal Property and \nAdministrative  Services  Act  authority  by  directing  the  Task  Force,  without  a \ndemonstrable nexus to the FPASA’s purpose, to prescribe a sweeping public health \nframework. \n201.  The President lacks authority to issue Executive Order 14042.  \n202.  Because Executive Order 14042 is unlawful, the imposed mandates in \nthe Task Force Guidance, Initial OMB Determination, FAR Council Guidance, and \nthe Post Hoc OMB Determination are unenforceable.   \nCOUNT VIII \nViolation of the Non-Delegation Doctrine \n203.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n204.  The vaccine mandates imposed by Executive Order 14042, the Task \nForce Guidance, Initial OMB Determination, FAR Council Guidance, and the Post \nHoc OMB Determination exceed congressional authority. \n47 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 51 of 60 - Page ID#: 455\n205.  To  the  extent  Defendants  argue  that  the  imposed  mandates  are \nauthorized, such authorization would constitute an improper delegation of authority. \n206.  Pursuant  to  Article  I,  Section  1  of  the  United  States  Constitution, \nCongress is vested with all legislative powers.  “Congress is not permitted to abdicate \nor to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested.”  \nA.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529–30 (1935).   \n207.  The executive branch can only exercise its own discrete powers reserved \nby Article II of the United States Constitution and such power that Congress clearly \nauthorizes through statutory command.  \n208.  Congress gives such authorization when it articulates an intelligible \nprinciple to guide the Executive that not only sanctions but also defines and cabins \nthe delegated legislative power.  \n209.  Under the nondelegation doctrine, a general  policy  untethered  to a \ndelegation of legislative power is not sufficient.   For a delegation to be proper, \nCongress must articulate a clear principle or directive of its will within the legislative \nact. See J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  The \nprinciple must be binding, and the delegate must be “directed to conform” to it.  Id. \n210.  The nondelegation doctrine preserves and protects important tenets of \nour democracy, including individual liberties, federalism, and the rule of law. \n211.  The broad sweeping actions of the President, OMB Director, Task Force, \nand the FAR Council to impose a vaccine mandate are not supported by an explicit \n48 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 52 of 60 - Page ID#: 456\nstatutory directive within the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act or \nany other federal law. \n212.  Congress did not articulate clear or sufficient instructions in the Federal \nProperty and Administrative Services Act directing the President to implement this \npublic  health  policy  scheme  by  executive  order.    Even  if  Congress  did  clearly \nauthorize a national vaccination schedule for federal contractors, it did not give \nsufficiently clear instructions to permit the President to delegate legislative judgment \nto the Task Force or the OMB Director. \n213.  Under  the  nondelegation  doctrine,  the  imposed  mandates  are \nunconstitutional because Congress did not articulate a clear principle by legislative \nact that directs the Executive to take sweeping action that infringes on state and \nindividual rights.  A delegation sanctioning the broad and intrusive executive action \nat issue here cannot be sustained without clear and meaningful legislative guidance, \nespecially  given  the  important  individual  rights  and  separation-of-powers  and \nfederalism concerns implicated. \n214.  Here, the Executive Order cuts deeply into the Plaintiff States’ sphere \nof power without articulating the underlying reasons or providing a justification \nbeyond a superficial, unsupported, and pretextual reference to efficiency and economy \nin federal contracts. \n215.  Without explicit congressional authorization, the President’s Executive \nOrder  14042  and  its  implementation  to  create  a  vaccine  mandate  for  federal \ncontractor employees is unconstitutional. \n49 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 53 of 60 - Page ID#: 457\nCOUNT IX \nViolation of Separation of Powers and Federalism \n \n216.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n217.  The imposed mandates are legislative actions, having the effect of a \ngenerally applicable, binding rule governing private conduct. \n218.  Pursuant  to  Article  I,  Section  1  of  the  United  States  Constitution, \nCongress is vested with all legislative powers, but Congress must act pursuant to the \nenumerated powers granted to it by Article I. \n219.  Pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, the \nNecessary and Proper Clause gives Congress the authority “to make all Laws which \nshall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” its general powers.  It does \nnot “license the exercise of any ‘great substantive and independent power[s]’ beyond \nthose specifically enumerated. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, \n559 (2012) (citation omitted).  \n220.  Defendants, through the imposed mandates, have exercised power far \nbeyond what was delegated to the federal government by constitutional mandate or \ncongressional action.  It is not a “proper” exercise of Congress’ authority to mandate \nthat everyone who touches a federal contractor has to be vaccinated because the \naction here exceeds any Article I enumerated power. \n221.  Pursuant to the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, \nthe powers not delegated by the Constitution to the United States, nor prohibited by \nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \n50 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 54 of 60 - Page ID#: 458\n222.  The U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal agencies of the \nexecutive branch to implement the imposed mandates.  This is a police power left to \nthe States under the Tenth Amendment.  U.S. Const. amend X. \n223.  By interfering with the traditional balance of power between the States \nand the federal government, and by acting pursuant to ultra vires federal action, \nDefendants violated the Constitution. \nCOUNT X \nUnconstitutional Exercise of the Spending Power \n224.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n225.  The imposed mandates are an unconstitutional condition on the States’ \nreceipt (by and through their agencies and political subdivisions who are federal \ncontractors) of federal funds. \n226.  Federal contracts are an exercise of the Spending Clause, U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 8, cl. 1, yet the challenged actions ask the States to agree to an ambiguous \ncontract term—specifically, agreeing to comply with imposed mandates that can be \nchanged at any time. \n227.  Because the imposed mandates, on information and belief, will lead to \nemployees either being fired or resigning, it is not rationally related to any federal \ninterest in a particular project or program that is the subject of a federal contract. \n228.  Additionally, because the imposed mandates cover employees who have \nno connection to the federal contract beyond just being coworkers with an employee \nwho works on such a contract and being likely to come into contact with them, the \n51 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 22   Filed: 11/15/21   Page: 55 of 60 - Page ID#: 459\nmandates are not rationally related to any federal interest in a particular project or \nprogram that is the subject of a federal contract. \n229.  And  as  described  above,  the  mandates  are  prohibited  by  other \nconstitutional provisions.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to: \nA.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants,  individually  and \ncollectively, have imposes a sweeping, unlawful, and unconstitutional COVID-19 \nvaccine mandate on federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees.  \nB.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  vaccine  mandate  on  federal \ncontractors, subcontractors, and their employees is unlawful and therefore null and \nvoid ab initio. \nC.  Hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  the  Executive  Order,  Initial  OMB \nDetermination, FAR Council Guidance, and Post Hoc OMB Determination. \nD.  Grant a temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunction prohibiting \nDefendants and those acting in concert with them from enforcing this sweeping, \nunlawful,  and  unconstitutional  mandate  on  any  federal  contracting  agency, \nsubcontractor, and employees within the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the State of \nOhio, and the State of Tennessee or with respect to any of its citizens.   \nE.

See \nMotion for TRO and Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 12 (“Mot.”); Proposed Order ECF \nNo. 12-5.  But Plaintiffs have failed to show how they have been harmed at all, much less \nthat they face irreparable harm.  Plaintiffs provide no evidence that they are parties to a \nfederal contract that already has this clause, or parties to an existing covered contract that \nis up for an option, extension, or renewal that will include the challenged clause.  Nor do \nPlaintiffs identify any covered solicitations they plan to bid on or covered contracts they \nplan to enter into in the immediate future.  For these reasons alone, Plaintiffs’ motion \nshould be denied. \nEven if this Court reaches the merits, it should reject Plaintiffs’ argument that the \nPresident has no power to direct federal contracting—an argument that conflicts with \nmore than 50 years of precedent.  Additionally, their procedural arguments are meritless \nand now are moot because the Director of the Office of Management and Budget has \nsuperseded her prior Notice with a revised document that solicits public comments.  And \nthe constitutional claims raised by Plaintiffs have been considered and rejected by courts \nmany times over. \nWhen COVID-19 first emerged in the United States, it ravaged the economy and \ndevastated  government  contractors.    No  less  than  private  entities,  the  federal \n1 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 14 of 45 - Page ID#: 668\ngovernment’s operations suffered when its contractors’ employees became sick and died \nfrom  COVID-19.    Safe  and  effective  vaccines  provide  the  promise  that  the  federal \ngovernment and its contractors can resume full operations.  The Federal Government has \ntherefore made a decision to require those with whom it contracts to take precautions to \nprevent the spread of this virulent, contagious disease.  “Like private individuals and \nbusinesses, the Government enjoys the unrestricted power to produce its own supplies, \nto determine those with whom it will deal, and to fix the terms and conditions upon \nwhich it will make needed purchases.”  Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 127 (1940).  \n“Those wishing to do business with the Government must meet the Government's terms; \nothers need not.”  AFL-CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784, 794 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (en banc).  The \nCourt should reject Plaintiffs’ request to impose their novel view of the ability of the \nFederal Government to set the terms of its own contracts. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The COVID-19 Pandemic \nOn  January  31,  2020,  the  Secretary  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (“HHS”) \ndeclared a public health emergency because of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused \nby the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.  HHS, Determination that a Public Health Emergency \nExists (Jan. 31, 2020), https://perma.cc/VZ5X-CT5R.  On March 13, 2020, the President \ndeclared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency.  85 FR 15,337 (Mar. 13, 2020).  In \nJuly 2021, the United States began to experience “a rapid and alarming rise in . . . COVID-\n19 cases and hospitalization rates,” driven by an especially contagious strain.  See Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), Delta Variant (updated Aug. 26, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/4RW6-7SGB.1  To date, more than 46 million Americans have been \ninfected with COVID-19 and more than 759,000 have died from COVID-19.

Vaccine Requirements for Federal Contractors \nOn September 9, the President acting as CEO of the federal government, issued \nEO 14042 to “promote[] economy and efficiency in Federal procurement by ensuring that \nthe parties that contract with the Federal Government provide adequate COVID-19 \nsafeguards to their workers performing on or in connection with a Federal Government \ncontract or contract-like instrument.”  EO 14042.  He determined that new safeguards \nwould “decrease worker absence, reduce labor costs, and improve the efficiency of \ncontractors and subcontractors at sites where they are performing work for the Federal \nGovernment.”  Id.  And he directed the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (“Task \nForce”) to issue guidance.  EO 14043, 86 FR 50, 989, 50,990 (Sept. 14, 2021).   \nEO  14042  directs  federal  executive  departments  and  agencies,  “to  the  extent \npermitted by law,” to include a clause requiring compliance with workplace safety \nguidance issued by the Task Force that is approved by the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget (“OMB”), after a finding that the guidance, “if adhered to by \ncontractors  or  subcontractors,  will  promote  economy  and  efficiency  in  Federal \ncontracting.”  86 FR at 50,985; see also id. at 50,986-50,987. \nThe Task Force issued safety guidance on September 24, 2021.  Task Force, COVID-\n19  Workplace  Safety:  Guidance  for  Federal  Contractors  and  Subcontractors, \nhttps://perma.cc/6DRV-LV2Q  (“Contractor Guidance”).    That  guidance,  which  OMB \napproved, requires that covered contractor and subcontractor employees should receive \na COVID-19 vaccination, except insofar as any such employee is legally entitled to an \naccommodation.  https://perma.cc/CL8P-YV5B (“Old OMB Determination”).   \nThe EO directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (“FAR Council”) to \nmake corresponding amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) and in \nthe interim to issue guidance on how to use existing agency authority to include the new \n3 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 16 of 45 - Page ID#: 670\nprovision in covered contracts.  86 FR at 50,986.  The FAR Council issued initial guidance \non September 30, 2021, which provided a sample clause that agencies could use to \nimplement the EO in new contracts and solicitations.  Memo. from FAR Council to Chief \nAcquisition Officers, et al., re: Issuance of Agency Deviations to Implement Executive \nOrder 14042 (Sept. 30, 2021),  https://perma.cc/9BQ8-XBT6 (“FAR Memo”). See also Open \nFAR Cases, https://perma.cc/P84M-3XUY (No. 2021-21 relates to FAR Rulemaking). \nOn November 10, 2021, the OMB Director issued a revised Determination which \nrevoked the prior OMB Determination, gave covered contractors additional time to \ncomply with the EO’s vaccination requirements, and provided a more detailed analysis \nof how the Contractor Guidance would promote economy and efficiency in government \ncontracting.  See Determination of the Acting OMB Director Regarding the Revised Safer \nFederal  Workforce  Task  Force  Guidance  for  Federal  Contractors  and  the  Revised \nEconomy  &  Efficiency  Analysis,  available  at:  http://federalregister.gov/d/2021-24949 \n(Nov. 16, 2021) (“New OMB Determination”).  The updated Determination provides that \nas of January 18, 2022, covered contractor employees must be vaccinated on the first day \nof a new covered contract or when there is a renewal, extension, or exercised option on \nan existing one.  Id.  The New OMB Determination is effective as of November 10, 2021, \nand provides for a public comment period through December 16, 2021.  Id.  \nIII.  Procedural History \nOn November 4, 2021, Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit.  See Compl., ECF No. 1.  Their \ncomplaint  contains  ten  counts  challenging  EO  14042,  the  OMB  Director’s  now-\nsuperseded determination, and the FAR Council’s guidance.  See id., ¶¶ 127–207.  On \nNovember 8, 2021 (before the New OMB Determination), Plaintiffs filed a motion for a \nTRO and a preliminary injunction.  See generally Mot.  The next day, the Court held a \ntelephonic status conference with the parties and set a briefing schedule on the motion.  \nSee ECF No. 16.  Defendants now submit this brief opposing Plaintiffs’ pending motion. \n4 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 17 of 45 - Page ID#: 671\nARGUMENT \nA preliminary injunction is “one of the most drastic tools in the arsenal of judicial \nremedies.”  ACLU of Ky. v. McCreary Cnty., 354 F.3d 438, 444 (6th Cir. 2003) (citation \nomitted), aff’d, 545 U.S. 844 (2005).  “A preliminary injunction is . . . never awarded as of \nright.” Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689–90 (2008) (citation omitted).  And one “should \nnot be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  \nMazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997) (citation omitted).  The movant “must \nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and \nthat an injunction is in the public interest.”  Thompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 615 (6th \nCir. 2020) (citation omitted). \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Not Entitled to Preliminary Relief Because They Have Failed to \nEstablish a Strong Likelihood of Standing. \nThe Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this case because Plaintiffs have \nnot established standing to bring their claims.  See Lance v. Coffman, 549 U.S. 437, 439 \n(2007) (per curiam).  Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating standing “‘for each claim \n[they] seek[] to press’ and ‘for each form of relief sought.’”  See Waskul v. Washtenaw Cnty. \nCmty. Mental Health, 900 F.3d 250, 253 (6th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted).  \n The “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements”: \n(1) an “injury in fact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is concrete and \nparticularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; (2) a “causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of”; and (3) “it must be likely, \nas opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will  be redressed  by a favorable \ndecision.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (citations and quotation \nmarks omitted).  And where, as here, “reaching the merits of [a] dispute would force [a \ncourt] to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal \nGovernment  was  unconstitutional,”  the  “standing  inquiry  [is]  especially  rigorous.”  \n5 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 18 of 45 - Page ID#: 672\nRaines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 819–20 (1997). \nPlaintiffs have made no serious effort to carry their “especially rigorous” burden: \nclaims about the potential loss of unnamed contracts or harm from hypothetical loss of \npotential tax revenue does not even begin to satisfy their burden to “clearly show” a \nconcrete, particularized, and imminent injury that can be traced to the Order and is likely \nto be redressable by a favorable decision.  When a claim involves a challenge to a future \ncontracting opportunity, the pertinent question is whether Plaintiffs “ha[ve] made an \nadequate showing that sometime in the relatively near future [they] will bid on another \nGovernment contract,” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995).   \nPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate that any state agency or subdivision is currently (or \nwill soon be) subject to such a mandate.  Plaintiffs identify five contracts between the \nfederal government and a state agency or subdivision, each providing for the housing of \nfederal detainees at county jails or sheriff’s offices on behalf of either Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) or the U.S. Marshals Service.  See Decl. of Fredrick W. \nStevens (“Stevens Decl.”), ¶ 2, Ex. A at 1, ECF No. 12-2; Decl. of Scott A. Hildenbrand \n(“Hildenbrand Decl.”), Ex. A, ECF No. 12-3 at 7, 20; Decl. of Victor B. Maddox (“Maddox \nDecl.”), ¶ 6, Ex. A–C, ECF No. 12–4.  Yet none of these contracts are “covered contracts”—\ni.e., a contract that includes a clause requiring compliance with OMB-approved Task \nForce Guidance. See 86 FR at 63419; see also EO 14042, § 2(a).  \nNor do Plaintiffs provide any indication that these contracts will soon be amended \nto include such a requirement.  While ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service are “strongly \nencouraged” under EO 14042 to incorporate the Task Force’s COVID-19 safety protocols \ninto “existing contracts,” they can only do so “to the extent permitted by law.”  See EO \n14042, § 6(c).  The contracts that Plaintiffs identify can be amended only upon the mutual, \nwritten agreement of the parties.  See Stevens Decl., Ex. A at 8; Hildebrand Decl., Ex. A at \n12, 25; Maddox Decl., Ex. A at 11, Ex. B at 11, Ex. C at 11.  There is no indication that the \nU.S. Marshals Service has made a request to amend its contracts to incorporate a COVID-\n6 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 19 of 45 - Page ID#: 673\n19 safety clause.  ICE has, however, requested that the Seneca County Jail, in Tiffin, Ohio, \nagree to a bilateral modification that implements EO 14042 and requires compliance with \nTask Force Guidance.2  See Decl. of Natalie Carr, ¶ 2, Exs. 1–2.  But because this bilateral \nmodification would only be effective upon Seneca’s approval, if Seneca refuses ICE’s \nrequest, its contract will not be subject to the “federal contractor vaccine mandate” that it \nseeks to preliminarily enjoin.  Asking to change a contract term is not a cognizable harm. \nThis failure of proof is fatal to Plaintiffs’ motion.  “[W]here a plaintiff moves for a \npreliminary injunction, [a] district court . . . should normally evaluate standing under the \nheightened standard for evaluating a motion for summary judgment,” Waskul, 900 F.3d \nat 255 n.3 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)—that is, by requiring the \nplaintiff to support their allegations of standing “by affidavit or other evidence,\" see \nMcKay v. Federspiel, 823 F.3d 862, 867 (6th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).  Failure “to \nestablish a substantial likelihood of standing requires denial of [a] motion for preliminary \ninjunction.”  Waskul, 900 F.3d at 255 n.3; accord id. at 256 n.4.   \nPlaintiffs also lack standing to challenge the FAR Memo because they fail to \nexplain how enjoining the FAR Memo would redress any injury.  As the Supreme Court \nhas made clear, “standing is not dispensed in gross.”  Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., \n137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted).  Instead, “a plaintiff must demonstrate \nstanding for each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.”  Id. \n(quoting Davis v. Fed. Election Comm'n, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008)). The President instructed \nagencies and contracting officers to include certain provisions in new contracts.  EO § 2.  \nThe FAR Memo suggests a sample clause that agencies and contracting officers might use \nto implement the Executive Order.  Far Memo at 4.  Agencies have the authority to \ninclude a verbatim clause in contracts and solicitations even without the FAR Memo.   \n                                                 \n2 This request for a bilateral modification also complies with DHS’s own policy for \nimplementing EO 14042.  See Decl. of Natalie Carr, ¶ 3, Ex. 3. \n \n7 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 20 of 45 - Page ID#: 674\nPlaintiffs may have standing to challenge the inclusion of a COVID-19 safety \nclause in some future contract or bid.  But because Plaintiffs have not shown an injury \nthat is “actual and imminent,” and not merely “conjectural or hypothetical,” see Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 560, Plaintiffs are “not entitled to a preliminary injunction,” and their motion \nshould therefore be denied, see Waskul, 900 F.3d at 256 n.4.; accord Memphis A. Philip \nRandolph Inst. v. Hargett, 2 F.4th 548, 554 (6th Cir. 2021). \nII.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely To Succeed On The Merits. \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Not Likely To Show That The President Lacks Authority \nTo Regulate Federal Government Contracting. \nPlaintiffs argue that the President lacks authority to issue binding guidance for \ngovernment contracts.  Mot. at 16–19.  This argument ignores that Congress specifically \nauthorized the President to manage federal procurement in the Federal Property and \nAdministrative Services Act (FPASA).  40 U.S.C. § 121(a).  While Plaintiffs claim that \nFPASA does not grant the President such authority, they cite no opinions interpreting \nFPASA in the novel manner they are proposing.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ position ignores more \nthan a half century of precedent from all three branches of our constitutional system. \nSince  the  1960s,  federal  appellate  courts  have  routinely  held  that  FPASA \nauthorizes the President to manage government contracting through executive orders.  \nSee, e.g., Farmer v. Phila. Elec. Co., 329 F.2d 3, 7 (3d Cir. 1964); Farkas v. Tex. Instrument, Inc., \n375 F.2d 629, 632 (5th Cir. 1967).  Courts have concluded, for example, that FPASA \nauthorizes the President to require government contractors to comply with wage and \nprice controls, Khan, 618 F.2d 784, to post notices at all of their facilities informing \nemployees that they cannot be forced to join a union or to pay mandatory dues for costs \nunrelated to representational activities, UAW-Lab. Emp. & Training Corp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d \n360, 366 (D.C. Cir. 2003), and to require contractors to confirm employee’s immigration \nstatus through e-Verify, Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Napolitano, 648 F. Supp. 2d 726, 729 (D. \nMd. 2009).  See also City of Albuquerque v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 379 F.3d 901 (10th Cir. 2004) \n8 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 21 of 45 - Page ID#: 675\n(urban renewal); AFGE v. Carmen, 669 F.2d 815 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (conservation of gasoline \nduring  an  oil  crisis).    Indeed,  even  cases  relied  on  by  Plaintiffs  confirm  that  “the \nProcurement Act does vest broad discretion in the President.”  Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. \nReich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1330, 1333 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (affirming the “President’s authority to \npursue ‘efficient and economic’ procurement” through EOs, but holding the challenged \norder conflicted with another statute).   \nPlaintiffs asks the Court to adopt their cramped interpretation of FPASA by \npurportedly  relying  on  the  text  of  the  statute.    But  the  text  is  quite  broad—the \nFPASA authorizes  the  President  to  “prescribe  such  policies  and  directives,  not \ninconsistent with the provisions of this Act, as he shall deem necessary to effectuate the \nprovisions of said Act.”  Chao, 325 F.3d at 366 (quoting 40 U.S.C. § 486(a) (2000) (now \ncodified as amended at 40 U.S.C. § 121)).  The President is given broad discretion to \nsupervise government contracting “as he shall deem necessary” so long as the President \ndoes not act “inconsistent[ly] with the provisions” of the FPASA.  Courts have “read this \nas requiring that the executive order have a ‘sufficiently close nexus’ to the values of \nproviding the government an ‘economical and efficient system for . . . procurement and \nsupply.’”  Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 366 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citation omitted); see also Liberty Mut. \nIns. Co. v. Friedman, 639 F.2d 164, 169 (4th Cir. 1981).  And as discussed below, the \nchallenged policies satisfy this nexus requirement. \nPlaintiffs’  argument  that  the  President  lacks  authority  to  direct  government \ncontracting is further undermined by Congress’s implicit endorsement of an expansive \nview of the President’s power under FPASA.  Presidents have regularly exercised their \nauthority under FPASA since it was enacted.  See Kahn, 618 F.2d at 790–91 (“Since 1941, \nthough, the most prominent use of the President’s authority under the FPASA has been \na series of anti-discrimination requirements for Government contractors”); see also, e.g., \nEO 12072, 43 FR 36869 (Aug. 16, 1978); EO 13465, 73 FR 33285 (June 11, 2008); EO 13950, \n85 FR 60683 (Sept. 28, 2020).  “Past [Presidential] practice does not, by itself, create power, \n9 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 22 of 45 - Page ID#: 676\nbut ‘long-continued practice, known to and acquiesced in by Congress, would raise a \npresumption that the [action] had been [taken] in pursuance of its consent.’”  Dames & \nMoore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 686 (1981).  “[T]he President's view of his own authority \nunder a statute is not controlling, but when that view has been acted upon over a \nsubstantial period of time without eliciting Congressional reversal, it is entitled to great \nrespect.”  Kahn, 618 F.2d at 790.   \nCongress, likewise, has long understood and accepted that FPASA granted broad \nauthority to the President.  While Congress has revised the FPASA since 1949, including \na complete recodification in 2002, none of those amendments modified or restricted the \npower being used by the President here.3  “If a word or phrase has been . . . given a \nuniform interpretation by inferior courts . . . , a later version of that act perpetuating the \nwording is presumed to carry forward that interpretation.”  Texas Dep't of Hous. & Cmty. \nAffairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519, 536-37 (2015) (quoting A. Scalia \n& B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012)).   \nB.  The President’s Power Is Within The Scope Of The Procurement Act. \nThe President’s authority to direct government procurement is consistent with the \nCongressional grant of authority in FPASA, so long as those policies are “reasonably \nrelated  to  the  Procurement  Act’s  purpose  of  ensuring  efficiency  and  economy  in \ngovernment procurement.”  Liberty Mut., 639 F.2d at 170.  Courts have “emphasized the \nnecessary flexibility and ‘broad-ranging authority’” that FPASA provides.  Chao, 325 F.3d \nat 366.  The standard is “lenient” and can be satisfied even when “the order might in fact \nincrease  procurement  costs”  in  the  short  run.    Id.  at  366–67.    “[T]his \nclose nexus requirement [] mean[s] little more than that President's explanation for how \nan Executive Order promotes efficiency and economy must be reasonable and rational.”  \n                                                 \n3 See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 99-500, §101(m) [title VIII, §832], 100 Stat. 1783-345 (1986); Pub. L.  \nNo. 99-591, §101(m) [title VIII, §832], 100 Stat. 3341-45 (1986); Pub. L. No. 104-208  § 101(f) \n[Title VI, § 611], 110 Stat. 3009-355 (1996); Pub. L. No. 107-217, 116 Stat. 1062, 1068 (2002). \n10 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 23 of 45 - Page ID#: 677\nNapolitano, 648 F. Supp. 2d at 738 (one sentence explanation sufficient); see also Reich, 74 \nF.3d at 1333 (“The President's authority to pursue ‘efficient and economic’ procurement \n. . .  certainly  reach[es]  beyond  any  narrow  concept  of  efficiency  and  economy  in \nprocurement.”) (collecting examples).   \nExecutive  Order  14042  easily  satisfies  this  lenient  standard.    The  President \nexplained in Section 1 of the EO: \nThis order promotes economy and efficiency in Federal procurement by en-\nsuring that the parties that contract with the Federal Government provide \nadequate COVID-19 safeguards to their workers performing on or in con-\nnection with a Federal Government contract . . . .  These safeguards will \ndecrease the spread of COVID-19, which will decrease worker absence, re-\nduce labor costs, and improve the efficiency of contractors and subcontrac-\ntors at sites where they are performing work for the Federal Government. \nTo anyone who has lived through the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting economic \nturmoil,  the  nexus  between  reducing  the  spread  of  COVID-19  and  economy  and \nefficiency in federal contracting is self-evident.  While Plaintiffs may disagree with the \nPresident’s policy or consider it unwise, the EO’s explanation is sufficient to show the \nrequired nexus between the policy and economy and efficiency.  Compare EO § 1 with \nChao, 325 F.3d at 366–67 (holding sufficiently close nexus to efficient and economic \nprocurement based on two sentences: “When workers are better informed of their rights, \nincluding their rights under the Federal labor laws, their productivity is enhanced.  The \navailability of such a workforce from which the United States may draw facilitates the \nefficient and economical completion of its procurement contracts.“).  The OMB Director’s \nDeterminations that economy and efficiency would be promoted through the contractor \nvaccination requirement underscores the nexus.  See 86 FR at 63421–23.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the FAR Council’s statutory responsibility to “issue and \nmaintain” the Federal Acquisition Regulation—a 2,000+-page regulation—means that the \nFAR Council has the exclusive authority to issue procurement regulations.  Mot. at 12 –14 \n(citing 41 U.S.C. § 1303(a)(1)).  But the FAR Council’s authority to issue regulations is not \n11 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 24 of 45 - Page ID#: 678\nexclusive.  The very next subsection, Section 1303(a)(2)(A), permits agencies to proscribe \n“regulations essential to implement Government-wide policies and procedures.”  And, \nof  course,  the  EO  and  the  OMB  Director’s  Determination  set  Government-wide \nprocurement policies pursuant to 40 U.S.C. § 121(a), which authorizes the President to \n“prescribe policies.”  Section 3 of the EO recognizes these two sources of authority by \ndirecting the FAR Council to revise the FAR, and until that happens, directing agencies \n“to exercise any applicable authority” to implement the Government-wide policies and \nprocedures described in the Executive Order and any subsequent OMB Determinations.   \nC.  The Vaccination Requirement Does Not Violate The Competition In \nContracting Act. \nPlaintiffs are also unlikely to show that the contractor vaccination requirement \nconflicts with the Competition in Contracting Act, which simply requires “full and open \ncompetition” and “competitive procedures.”  41 U.S.C. § 3301.  Plaintiffs argue that the \nrequirement violates this Act because certain bidders may not meet the qualifications in \nsolicitations that require a vaccinated workforce.  Mot. at 16–17 (citing Nat'l Gov't Servs., \nInc. v. United States, 923 F.3d 977 (Fed. Cir. 2019)).  But National Government Services \nsquarely rejected Plaintiffs’ argument when it upheld “the unremarkable proposition that \na solicitation requirement (such as a past experience requirement) is not necessarily \nobjectionable simply because that requirement has the effect of excluding certain offerors \nwho  cannot  satisfy  that  requirement.”    923  F.3d  at  985;  id.  at  986  (holding  a  rule \npreventing bidders who already had a certain amount of agency contract work violated \nthe Contracting Act because “the exclusion is not based on some capability or experience \nrequirement” or any other substantive evaluation factor).  Setting requirements that \ncontractors may refuse does not violate the Competition In Contracting Act. \nD.  Plaintiff’s Challenges To The OMB Determination Are Not Justiciable. \nPlaintiffs challenge the OMB’s initial determination, issued on September 24, 2021.  \nPlaintiffs’ APA challenge to the now-superseded OMB determination is moot because \n12 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 25 of 45 - Page ID#: 679\nthis determination has been expressly superseded by the New OMB Determination \ncontaining substantive changes.  See Akiachak Native Community v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, \n827 F.3d 100, 113 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (noting the “well-settled principle of law” that “when \nan agency has rescinded and replaced a challenged regulation, litigation over the legality \nof the original regulation becomes moot.”). \nIn  any  event,  neither  the  previous  notice  nor  the  operative  New  OMB \nDetermination is reviewable under the APA, because neither is an “agency action.”  \n“Because the President is not an ‘agency’ for purposes of the APA, presidential action is \nnot subject to judicial review under that statute.”  NRDC v. Dep’t of State, 658 F. Supp. 2d \n105, 109 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800–01 (1992); Dalton \nv. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 470 (1994)).  The President delegated to the OMB Director, \npursuant  to  3  U.S.C.  §  301,  the  authority  to  determine  whether  the  Safer  Federal \nWorkforce  Task  Force  Guidance  “will  promote  economy  and  efficiency  in  Federal \ncontracting.”  See EO 14042, § 2(c).  Section 301 authorizes the President “to designate and \nempower the head of any department or agency in the executive branch, . . . to perform \nwithout approval, ratification, or other action by the President [] any function which is \nvested in the President by law,” including the President’s power to direct government \ncontracting pursuant to 41 U.S.C. § 121(a).  When exercising delegated authority, the \nofficial “stands in the President’s shoes” and “cannot be subject to judicial review under \nthe APA.”  NRDC, 658 F. Supp. 2d at 109 & n.5, 111; see also Detroit Int’l Bridge Co. v. \nCanada, 189 F. Supp. 3d 85, 100 (D.D.C. 2016). \nE.  Plaintiffs  Are  Not  Likely  to  Succeed  on  Merits  of  their  OMB \nDetermination Challenges. \nPlaintiffs also fault the now-superseded OMB determination for not following the \nnotice-and-comment requirements of the APA and 41 U.S.C. § 1707.  But the APA does \nnot apply.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2) (excluding matters related to contracts).  And § 1707 \ndoes not apply to exercises of Presidential authority like the OMB determination because \n13 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 26 of 45 - Page ID#: 680\n§ 1707 applies only to “executive agencies.”  41 U.S.C. § 133.  But when the OMB Director \nexercises delegated presidential authority, she is not acting as “the head of [an] agency.”  \nIn any event, even if § 1707 were applicable, the New OMB Determination satisfies \n§ 1707’s  procedural  requirements.    Section  1707  permits  a  proposal  to  become \ntemporarily effective without publication and public comment if “the officer authorized \nto issue” the proposal finds that “urgent and compelling circumstances make compliance \nwith [those] requirements impracticable.” Id. § 1707 (d)–(e).  Here, the OMB Director did \njust that by finding that the imminent threat of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact \non “worker absence,” “labor costs,” and “the efficiency of federal contracting” presented \n“[u]rgent and compelling circumstances justify[ing]” a waiver under § 1707(d). 86 FR at \n63423–24.  And consistent with § 1707(e), the OMB Director “solicit[ed] comment on all \nsubjects  of”  the  OMB  Determination,  thus  permitting  the  determination  to  become \ntemporarily effective upon filing with the Federal Register on November 10, 2021.  Id. at \n63424. \nEven if the Determination were subject to the APA, the arbitrary-and-capricious \nclaims  would  still  fail  because  the  Determination  provides  “a  rational  connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made.”  Dickson v. Sec’y of Def., 68 F.3d 1396, 1404–\n05 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S.  29,  43  (1983)).  “[R]eview  under  the  arbitrary  and  capricious  standard  is \ndeferential.”  Ky. Waterways All. v. Johnson, 540 F.3d 466, 474 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting Nat’l \nAss’n of Home Builders v. Defs. of Wildlife, 551 U.S. 644, 658 (2007)).  A court “simply ensures \nthat  the  agency  has  acted  within  a  zone  of  reasonableness  and,  in  particular,  has \nreasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision.”  FCC \nv. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021). \nThe OMB Determination is eminently reasonable.  OMB’s Director approved the \nrevised Task Force Guidance because it concluded that “[t]he safety protocols that are set \nforth” in the guidance “are meant to ensure that COVID-19 does not easily spread within \n14 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 27 of 45 - Page ID#: 681\nthe workplace, so that Federal contractor employees can continue to be productive.”  86 \nFR at 63423. The requirement promotes economy and efficiency in federal contracting \nbecause  decreasing  worker  absences  saves  costs.    As  OMB’s  Director  explains, \n“[r]educing the number of infected people mechanically reduces transmission,” and \n“evidence also indicates that vaccines also reduce transmission by people who contract \n‘breakthrough’ infections.”  Id. at 63422.  In conjunction with the other safety protocols \nproposed in the Workforce Guidance, the vaccine requirements will “prevent infection \nand illness and preserve the productivity” of federal contractors.  Id.  \nThe OMB Director’s Determination also explains that, in her judgment, requiring \nvaccination will not lead any meaningful number of workers to quit their jobs, thereby \naddressing Plaintiffs’ concern about the “possibility that [the vaccine requirement] would \ncause a labor shortage.”  Mot. at 18.  OMB looked at data from major private employers \nto see whether workers leave their jobs instead of complying with vaccine requirements \nand concluded that there was “no systematic evidence that this has been a widespread \nphenomenon or that it would be likely to occur among employees of Federal contractors.  \nIn fact, the experience of private companies is to the contrary.”  86 FR at 63422 (citing \nevidence from Tyson Foods and United Airlines, among other companies).4  The OMB \nDirector’s “predictive judgment,” based on empirical evidence, is entitled to deference.  \nRural Cellular Ass’n v. FCC, 588 F.3d 1095, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see also Newspaper Ass’n of \nAm. v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 734 F.3d 1208, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“When, as here, an \nagency is making ‘predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule,’ we \nare particularly loath to second-guess its analysis.”). \nPlaintiffs claim that the vaccine requirement’s costs to the States, and their reliance \n                                                 \n4 The article and survey cited by Plaintiffs, Mot. at 8, Chris Isidore & Virginia Langmaid, \n72% of unvaccinated workers vow to quit if ordered to get vaccinated, CNN (Oct. 28, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/7JMV-SULY, includes this same data and notes that “[w]hat people say \nin a survey, and what they would [ultimately] do . . . can be two different things.”   \n15 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 28 of 45 - Page ID#: 682\ninterests, were not considered.  Mot. at 18.  But the OMB Director’s Determination did \nconsider  the  costs  to covered  contractors,  including  Plaintiffs,  and  determined  that \n“[b]ecause vaccines are widely available for free, the cost of implementing a vaccine \nmandate  is  largely  limited  to  administrative  costs  associated  with  distributing \ninformation about the mandate and tracking employees’ vaccination status.  Such costs \nare likely to be small.”  86 FR 63422.  As for “reliance interests,” Plaintiffs fail to articulate \nany harm from their “reliance” on the absence of a contractor vaccine requirement when \nenacting state laws.  The EO does not apply to existing contracts.  And OMB was entitled \nto approve guidance to manage federal operations and contracts on the basis of the data \nit considered, notwithstanding the presence of state and local measures that would be \npreempted for federal contracting purposes.  \nPlaintiffs also argue that OMB’s Determination was pretextual because it was \n“never about procurement efficiency—it is about public health.”  Mot. at 19.  In support, \nthey rely on an extra-record and inapposite statement made earlier in the pandemic by \nthe White House Press Secretary.  Plaintiffs' attempts to rely on material outside the \nadministrative record as evidence of pretext, see id. at 26 n.19, should be rejected.  As the \nSupreme Court has explained, when there is a “contemporaneous explanation” for an \nagency's  decision,  its  validity  “must  .  .  .  stand  or  fall  on  the  propriety  of  that \nfinding.”  Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 143 (1973).  Plaintiffs also fail to establish that the \nNew OMB Determination and attendant explanation “is incongruent with what the \nrecord reveals about the agency's priorities and decisionmaking process.”  Dep't of Com. \nv. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575–76 (2019).  As the OMB Director reasonably concluded, \nslowing  the  spread  of  COVID-19  has  an  economically  beneficial  impact  on  federal \noperations, since federal workers are incurring significant labor costs from workers \ngetting sick from COVID-19 and spreading it to others in the workplace.  See 86 FR 63421–\n23.  While such a policy may also have salutary public health effects, that result does not \nundermine the reasoning or legitimacy of the OMB Director’s determination.  Further, \n16 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 29 of 45 - Page ID#: 683\neven if the public-health effect was a background consideration, “a court may not reject \nan agency's stated reasons for acting simply because the agency might also have had \nother unstated reasons.”  Dep't of Com., 139 S. Ct. at 2573.  \nF.  Challenges To The FAR Memo Are Likewise Not Likely To Succeed. \n The FAR Memo is also not subject to judicial review under the APA because it \ndoes not apply to matters relating to contracts.  5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2).  Moreover, the APA \nprovides  review  only  of  final  agency  action—i.e.,  a  decision  (1)  that  marks  the \n“consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and (2) by which “rights or \nobligations have been determined, or from which “legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (citation omitted).  Neither prong is met here. \nFirst, the FAR Memo is not final agency action because it is not a FAR regulation.  \nThis guidance was issued in accordance with the EO’s instructions for the FAR to “take \ninitial steps to implement” the contract clause described in the EO.  EO 14042 § 3(a) \n(emphasis added).  The FAR Memo suggests a clause for contracting officers to use in the \ninterim, subject to agency- and contract-specific deviations to be developed by each \nagency.  FAR Memo at 4.  The conclusion of the policymaking process set forth in the \nEO—the FAR Council’s amendment to the FAR to complete the implementation of the \nEO by providing the contract clause “for inclusion in Federal procurement solicitation \nand contracts” subject to the EO—has yet to occur.  EO 14042 § 3(a).   \nSecond, agencies can implement the EO without the FAR Memo, so the FAR Memo \nis not a decision from which “legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177–78 \n(citation omitted).  Plaintiffs cannot challenge guidance when they fail to show “any risk \nof future harm traceable to the . . .  Guidance itself, as opposed to the preexisting federal \nlaws it describes.”  Klayman v. President of the U.S., 689 F. App'x 921, 924 (11th Cir. 2017).  \nIndeed, that is why Plaintiffs also lack standing to challenge the FAR Memo. \nEven if the FAR Memo was final agency action, Plaintiffs fail to challenge any \nspecific aspect as unreasonable.  The FAR Memo simply carries out the EO directive to \n17 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 30 of 45 - Page ID#: 684\n“take initial steps to implement appropriate policy direction” for how agency acquisition \noffices can use the contract clause described in the EO.  EO 14042 § 3(a).  Plaintiffs claim \nthat the FAR Memo improperly reveals “the goal of . . . ‘getting more people vaccinated \nand decreas[ing] the spread of COVID-19,’” Mot. at 19 (quoting FAR Memo at 3), but it \nis difficult to see what is problematic about this intention, which dovetails with the EO’s \ngoal of “decreas[ing] the spread of COVID-19, which will decrease worker absence, \nreduce labor costs, and improve the efficiency of contractors and subcontractors at sites \nwhere they are performing work for the Federal Government.”  EO 14042 § 1. \nSection 1707’s procedural notice requirements also do not apply to the FAR Memo \nbecause it is, at most, nonbinding guidance, and not “a procurement policy, regulation, \nprocedure, or form” with “a significant effect beyond” the FAR Council’s operating \nprocedures.  The FAR Council issued the memo to develop a template COVID-19 safety \nclause “to support agencies in meeting the applicability requirements and deadlines set \nforth in [EO 14042]” and to “encourage[]” agencies to “exercise their authority” to \ntemporarily deviate from the FAR by including similar clauses in their procurement \ncontracts.  FAR Memo at 2–3.  The FAR Memo has no independent effect, however, and \nnone of its guidance is operational unless an agency chooses to incorporate it into a \nprocurement contract.  See 41 U.S.C. § 1303(a)(2)(A) (agencies have authority separate \nfrom the FAR).  And the FAR Memo does not direct an agency to take any specific action, \nbut instead encourages contracting officers to “follow the direction[s] … issued by their \nrespective agencies” for how to utilize the memo’s guidance.  Id.   \nG.  Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Claims Are Meritless. \n1.  The challenged actions do not violate the Tenth Amendment.   \nPlaintiffs  cannot  succeed  on  a  Tenth  Amendment  claim  by  simply  invoking \ngeneral maxims of federalism.  The Tenth Amendment provides that “[t]he powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \nreserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”  U.S. Const. amend. X.  The powers \n18 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 31 of 45 - Page ID#: 685\nspecifically delegated to the federal government by the Constitution “are not powers that \nthe Constitution ‘reserved to the States.’”  United States v. Comstock, 560 U.S. 126, 144 \n(2010); accord New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 156 (1992) (“If a power is delegated \nto  Congress  in  the  Constitution,  the  Tenth  Amendment  expressly  disclaims  any \nreservation of that power to the States[.]”).  Simply put: As long as federal action rests on \na constitutionally delegated power, “there can be no violation of the Tenth Amendment.” \nUnited States v. Mikhel, 889 F.3d 1003, 1024 (9th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted).  \nWhere (as here) a federal statute is validly enacted under one of Congress’s \nenumerated powers, and the Executive Branch exercises authority lawfully delegated \nunder that statute, the Tenth Amendment is no bar to federal action.  See, e.g., Wachovia \nBank v. Watters, 431 F.3d 556, 563 (6th Cir. 2005), aff’d, 550 U.S. 1 (2007).  As explained \nabove, see supra § II.A–B, D, EO 14042 and the OMB Determination were issued pursuant \nto the President’s authority under the Procurement Act, a federal statute that was an \nevident exercise of Congress’s power under the Spending Clause, see infra.     \nPlaintiffs’ vague references to “time-honored principles of federalism” cannot alter \nthis conclusion.  Mot. 20–21.  In addressing a Tenth Amendment claim, a court has “no \nlicense to employ freestanding conceptions of state sovereignty when measuring” federal \nauthority under the Constitution.  Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, \n550 (1985).  The only question under the Tenth Amendment is whether the federal \ngovernment acts pursuant to one of its powers under the Constitution; if it does, a court \n“necessarily must also conclude that the [plaintiffs’] efforts to invoke abstract principles \nof federalism through the Tenth Amendment fail.”  See, e.g., Town of Johnston v. Fed. Hous. \nFin. Agency, 765 F.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir. 2014); see also Garcia, 469 U.S. at 549 (“States \nunquestionably do retain a significant measure of sovereign authority,” but “only to the \nextent  that  the  Constitution  has  not  divested  them  of  their  original  powers  and \ntransferred those powers to the Federal Government.” (cleaned up)). \nPlaintiffs  also  appear  to  suggest  that  a  Tenth  Amendment  problem  exists \n19 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 32 of 45 - Page ID#: 686\nwhenever federal action regulates subject matter that is also regulated by the states.  See \nMot.  at  20–21  (“[T]he  regulation  of  health  and  safety  matters  is  primarily  and \nhistorically[] a matter of local concern.” (citation omitted)).  But “[t]here is no general \n‘doctrine implied in the Federal Constitution that the two governments, national and \nstate, are each to exercise its powers so as not to interfere with the free and full exercise \nof the powers of the other.’”  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 195 (1968) (quoting Case v. \nBowles, 327 U.S. 92, 101 (1946)).  Indeed, it is axiomatic that the federal government does \nnot “invade[] areas reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment simply because it \nexercises its authority” under the Constitution, even “in a manner that displaces the States’ \nexercise of their police powers.”  Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass’n, 452 U.S. \n264, 291 (1981) (emphasis added).  Thus, “‘the Federal Government, when acting within \na delegated power, may override countervailing state interest,’ whether those interests \nare labeled traditional, fundamental, or otherwise.” Brackeen v. Haaland, 994 F.3d 249, 310 \n(5th Cir. 2021) (en banc) (op. of Dennis, J.) (quoting Wirtz, 392 U.S. at 195)), petition for cert. \nfiled, No. 21-380 (U.S. Sept. 8, 2021). \nPlaintiffs’  argument  also  ignores  that  the  terms  of  a  federal  contract  are  an \nexclusively federal concern.  Under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity, a federal \ncontractor is immune from conflicting state laws and regulations even when those state \nlaws  are  purportedly  based  on  state  police  power.    The  doctrine  arises  from  the \nSupremacy Clause and bars state regulations that “retard, impede, burden, or in any \nmanner control the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by [C]ongress to carry \ninto effect the powers vested in the national government.”  M’Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. \n(4  Wheat.)  316,  317  (1819).   “For  purposes  of  intergovernmental  immunity,  federal \ncontractors are treated the same as the federal government itself.”  U.S. v. Cal., 921 F.3d \n865, 882 n.7 (9th Cir. 2019).  Courts regularly conclude that government contractors are \nimmune from conflicting state laws, even when those laws are based on state power to \nregulate health and safety.  See Boeing Co. v. Movassaghi, 768 F.3d 832, 840 (9th Cir. \n20 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 33 of 45 - Page ID#: 687\n2014); GEO Grp., Inc. v. City of Tacoma, No. 3:18-cv-05233, 2019 WL 5963112, at *5 (W.D. \nWash. Nov. 13, 2019).  Thus, the Federal Government may contract with whom it likes \nunder whatever terms it pleases without interference from states.   \n2.   The challenged actions do not violate the Spending Clause.  \nPlaintiffs  also  claim  that  EO  14042  and  its  implementing  guidance  exceed  a \nlimitation imposed on “the federal government’s spending power,” Mot. at 20—namely, \nthat  if  Congress  “condition[s]  the  States’  receipt  of  federal  funds,  it  must  do  so \nunambiguously,” to “enable[] the States to exercise their choice knowingly.”  South Dakota \nv. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206–07 (1987) (quoting Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 \nU.S. 1, 17 (1981)).   \nThis limit on Congress’s authority to condition grants of federal funding does not \napply to federal contracts.  Plaintiffs cite no case where a court has found federal contract \nobligations invalid under Dole and Pennhurst’s clarity requirement.  And for good reason: \nadopting Plaintiffs’ position would make simple imprecisions in federal procurement \ncontracts matters of constitutional magnitude.  As the Supreme Court has explained, even \n“the  consequences  of  imprecision”  in  spending  legislation  “are  not  constitutionally \nsevere” when the government “is acting as patron rather than as sovereign.”  See Nat’l \nEndowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 589 (1998).  That is especially true when the \ngovernment procures property or services “as private parties, individuals or corporations \nalso engage in among themselves.”  See Arbitraje Casa de Cambio, S.A. de CV. v. United \nStates, 79 Fed. Cl. 235, 240–41 (Fed. Cl. 2007) (citation omitted).  \nAt  any  rate,  EO  14042  and  its  implementing  guidance  unambiguously  put \ncontractors on notice that compliance with OMB-approved Task Force Guidance is an \nobligation under a covered contract.  Dole and Pennhurst require nothing more.  See \nBenning v. Georgia, 391 F.3d 1299, 1307 (11th Cir. 2004).  The Court in Pennhurst was \nconcerned with a federal grant program that “was unclear as to whether the states \n21 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 34 of 45 - Page ID#: 688\nincurred any obligations at all by accepting federal funds.”  See id. (emphasis added); \naccord Commonwealth of Ky., Dep’t of Hum. Resources v. Donovan, 704 F.2d 288, 299 n.17 (6th \nCir. 1983).  Here, however, EO 14042 ensures that “the existence of the condition itself” \nwill be “explicitly obvious” to federal contractors by directing agencies to incorporate (to \nthe extent permitted by law) a COVID-19 safety clause into a contract before obligating a \ncontractor’s  compliance.    See  Benning,  391  F.3d  at  1307  (emphasis  added)  (quoting \nMayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir. 2002)).  For each contract identified \nby Plaintiffs, see supra § I, such a clause could only be incorporated upon the mutual \nagreement of the parties.  Thus, because the challenged actions ensure that the “intention \nto impose a condition is expressed clearly” in a covered contract, see Mayweathers, 314 F.3d \nat 1067, a state will be capable of making “an informed,” voluntary decision whether to \naccept  the  attendant  obligations  of  contracting  with  the  federal  government,  see \nPennhurst, 451 U.S. at 25; see also id. at 17 (conditions must be imposed clearly so a state is \nnot “unaware of the conditions” or “unable to ascertain what is expected of [them]”).   \nFurthermore,  Plaintiffs  stake  their  entire  claim  on  the  fact  that  agencies  are \nencouraged under the FAR Memo to include a provision requiring compliance with \n“guidance conveyed through Frequently Asked Questions,” which may be amended \nduring the period of performance.  See Mot. 21. But the Supreme Court has not required \nexactitude when conditioning federal funding.  See, e.g., Bennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 \nU.S. 656, 669 (1985) (“[T]he Federal Government simply could not prospectively resolve \nevery  possible  ambiguity  concerning  particular  applications  of  [a  grant  program’s] \nrequirements ….”).  Indeed, “the Supreme Court has held that conditions may be ‘largely \nindeterminate,’” and yet constitutionally permissible, “so long as the statute ‘provid[es] \nclear notice to the States that they, by accepting funds under [federal law], would indeed \nbe obligated to comply with [the conditions].”  Mayweathers, 314 F.3d at 1067 (quoting \nPennhurst, 451 U.S. at 24–25).  Federal contractors are capable of making informed, \nvoluntary  decisions  to  accept  an  obligation  to  comply  with  periodically  updated \n22 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 35 of 45 - Page ID#: 689\nguidelines.    See  Donovan,  704  F.2d  at  299  (“Thus,  the  state  voluntarily  accepts  the \nSecretary’s power to alter the program and require compliance.”).   \n3.   The challenged actions do not violate the nondelegation doctrine. \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  the  Procurement  Act  violates  the  Constitution’s \nnondelegation doctrine if it authorizes the President to issue EO 14042.  See Mot. at 22–\n23. To the contrary, the Procurement Act’s delegation of authority fits comfortably within \nthe bounds of constitutionally permissible delegations.  Congress may lawfully delegate \ndecision-making authority so long as it “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible \nprinciple  to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.”  \nMistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989) (citation omitted).  A delegation is \n“constitutionally sufficient if Congress clearly delineates [1] the general policy, [2] the \npublic agency which is to apply it, and [3] the boundaries of this delegated authority.”  Id. \nat 372–73 (citation omitted); accord Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2129 (2019) \n(plurality op.) (“[A] delegation is permissible if Congress has made clear to the delegee \n‘the general policy’ he must pursue and the ‘boundaries of his authority.’” (cleaned up)).  \nThe intelligible-principle standard is so deferential that the Supreme Court has \n“almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree \nof policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.”  Whitman v. \nAm. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 474–75 (2001) (quoting Mistretta, 488 U.S at 416 (Scalia, \nJ., dissenting)).  In fact, the Supreme Court has struck down congressional delegations \nonly twice in United States history—both in 1935—and only because “Congress had \nfailed to articulate any policy or standard” to confine discretion.  Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2129. \nOver the last eighty years, the Court “has countenanced as intelligible seemingly vague \nprinciples in statutory text such as whether something would ‘unduly or unnecessarily \ncomplicate,’  …  be  ‘generally  fair  and  equitable,’  in  the  ‘public  interest,’  …  [or] \nauthoriz[es] the recovery of excessive profits.”  In re Nat’l Sec. Agency Telecomms. Recs. \n23 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 36 of 45 - Page ID#: 690\nLitig., 671 F.3d 881, 896 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing multiple cases); see also, e.g., Indus. Union \nDep’t, AFL-CIO v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 646 (1980) (upholding delegation to \ndetermine what constituted a “safe” place of employment); Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2129 \n(noting that the Supreme Court has, on multiple occasions, “approved delegations to \nvarious agencies to regulate in the ‘public interest”’ (citing Nat'l Broad. Co. v. United States, \n319 U.S. 190, 216 (1943), and N.Y. Cent. Secs. Corp. v. United States, 287 U.S. 12, 24 (1932))); \nid.  at  2130–31  (Alito,  J.,  concurring  in  the  judgment)  (“[S]ince  1935,  the  Court  has \nuniformly rejected nondelegation arguments and has upheld provisions that authorized \nagencies to adopt important rules pursuant to extraordinarily capacious standards.”). \nIn  light  of  this  longstanding  precedent,  the  statute  at  issue  here  reflects  an \nintelligible  principle  that  falls  well  within  permissible  bounds.    As  explained,  the \nProcurement Act sets forth a general policy—the promotion of economy and efficiency \nin the federal government’s procurement of property and services, see 40 U.S.C. § 101—\nand authorizes the President to issue orders designed to further those specific statutory \ngoals in that narrow, definable context, see id. § 121(a).  The statute’s criteria thus \nestablishes a clear boundary for the President’s actions, and compares favorably to other \ncongressional  delegations  that  have  been  sustained  against  challenges  under  the \nnondelegation doctrine.  See, e.g., Whitman, 531 U.S. at 474–75 (listing cases).  Several \ncourts have already held that the Procurement Act’s delegation of authority to the \nPresident is valid.  See Kahn, 618 F.2d at 785–86, 793 n.51 (“[The Procurement Act] requires \nthe President to make procurement policy decisions based on considerations of economy \nand efficiency.  Although broad, this standard can be applied generally to the President’s \nactions to determine whether those actions are within the legislative delegation.”); City of \nAlbuquerque, 379 F.3d at 914–15 (finding the Procurement Act’s limit that the President \n“establish ‘an economical and efficient system for . . . the procurement and supply’ of \nproperty” provided an “‘intelligible principle’ to guide the exercise” of the “relatively \nbroad delegation of authority” in the statute (citations omitted). \n24 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 37 of 45 - Page ID#: 691\nPlaintiffs cite no authority to the contrary.  Instead, they largely reiterate their \nstatutory  objections,  maintaining  that  EO  14042  “has  no  basis  in  the  text  of”  the \nProcurement Act, but if it did, the statute would be too “broad.”  See Mot. 23.  But that is \nnot the standard.  “Congress does not violate the Constitution merely because it legislates \nin  broad  terms,  leaving  a  certain  degree  of  discretion  to  executive  or  judicial \nactors.”  Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991).  As the Supreme Court has \nacknowledged, “Congress simply [could not] do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.”  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372.  In sum, only if this \nCourt “could say that there is an absence of standards for the guidance of the [President’s] \naction, so that it would be impossible in a proper proceeding to ascertain whether the will \nof Congress has been obeyed, would [the Court] be justified in overriding [Congress’s] \nchoice of means for effecting its declared purpose” in the Procurement Act.  See Yakus v. \nUnited States, 321 U.S. 414, 426 (1944) (emphasis added).  That is not the case here.  \nIII.  Plaintiffs  Are  Not  Likely  To  Suffer  Irreparable  Harm  In  The  Absence  Of \nPreliminary Relief.  \nPlaintiffs are also not entitled to a preliminary injunction because they have failed \nto  show  a  likelihood  of  irreparable  harm,  an  “‘indispensable’  requirement  for  a \npreliminary injunction.”  Memphis A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Hargett, 978 F.3d 378, 391 (6th \nCir. 2020) (citation omitted).  “To merit a preliminary injunction, an injury must be both \ncertain and immediate, not speculative or theoretical.”  D.T. v. Sumner Cnty. Schs., 942 \nF.3d 324, 327 (6th Cir. 2019) (cleaned up).  A plaintiff cannot make this showing with \n“unsubstantiated and conclusory assertions,” John Doe Co. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, \n849 F.3d 1129, 1134 (D.C. Cir. 2017), but must “substantiate a claim that irreparable injury \nis likely to occur” by providing competent “evidence” of irreparable harm, Mich. Coal. of \nRadioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 154 (6th Cir. 1991). \nFirst, Plaintiffs suggest that they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief because the challenged actions violate “the constitutional structure.”  \n25 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 38 of 45 - Page ID#: 692\nMot. at 24–25.  But as explained above, Plaintiffs have identified no constitutional defect \nin EO 14042, the OMB Determination, or the FAR Memo.  See supra § II.G.  At any rate, \nPlaintiffs have not alleged the type of constitutional violation  contemplated by the \nauthorities they cite—i.e., the deprivation of an individual constitutional right.  See Doe v \nUniv. of Cincinnati, 872 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2017) (involving the alleged deprivation of the \nindividual right to due process); Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423 (6th Cir. 2012) \n(involving “the fundamental right to vote”); McCreary Cnty., 354 F.3d 438 (involving \n“constitutional rights” under the Establishment Clause); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 \n(1976) (involving the “loss of First Amendment freedoms” of political association and \nexpression).  Although the violation of an individual constitutional right can support a \nfinding of irreparable harm, see N.Y. State Rest. Ass’n v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Health, 545 F. Supp. \n2d 363, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), rev’d on other grounds, 556 F.3d 114 (2d Cir. 2009), Plaintiffs \nhere seek preliminary relief on the basis of structural constitutional claims involving \nCongress’s authority under the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and the non-\ndelegation doctrine.  See Mot. at 19 (alleging violations of “three key constitutional \nlimitations  on  federal  government  power”).    An  alleged  violation  of  “a  structural \nprovision of the Constitution that does not confer personal rights” cannot support a \nfinding of irreparable harm.  Weisshaus v. Cuomo, 512 F. Supp. 3d 379, 389 (E.D.N.Y. 2021) \n(citation omitted); accord, e.g., Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Town of W. Newbury, 835 F.2d 380, \n382 (1st Cir. 1987); Am. Petroleum Inst. v. Jorling, 710 F. Supp. 421, 431 (N.D.N.Y. 1989); \nLive 365, Inc. v. Copyright Royalty Bd., 698 F. Supp. 2d 25, 45 (D.D.C. 2010). \nSecond, Plaintiffs claim that EO 14042 and its implementing guidance will harm \nthem by “intruding on their sovereign authority” to enforce their own public-health \n“policies that conflict with” federal law.  Mot. at 23–24.  But this claim simply reiterates \nPlaintiffs’ doctrinally barren view of the Tenth Amendment.  Again, it is black-letter law \nthat the federal government does not “invade[]” areas of state sovereignty “simply \nbecause it exercises its authority” in a way that preempts conflicting state laws, even “in \n26 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 39 of 45 - Page ID#: 693\na manner that displaces the States’ exercise of their police powers.”  Hodel, 452 U.S. at 291 \n(emphasis added).  Here, EO 14042 and the OMB Determination, and the FAR Memo \nwere issued pursuant to delegated authority under the Procurement Act.  See supra § I.C.  \nAnd as federal law, these actions preempt conflicting state laws by simple operation of \nthe Supremacy Clause, and nothing in the text or structure of the Constitution entitles \nPlaintiffs to “enact or enforce … laws and policies that conflict” with federal law.5 \nThird, Plaintiffs claim that they will be irreparably harmed because they are being \ndenied the opportunity for notice and comment.  Mot. at 25–26.  As explained above, this \nclaim  is  moot.    Plaintiffs  have  notice  and  they  can  submit  their  comments  to: \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2021-24949/determination-regarding \n-the-revised-safer-federal-workforce-task-force-guidance-for-federal \nLastly, Plaintiffs argue that, absent preliminary relief, they “will suffer irreparable \neconomic harm caused by loss of contracts with the federal government.”  Mot. at 26.  \nThis claim fails for a multitude of reasons.  As explained above, see supra § I, Plaintiffs do \nnot identify a single contract that will be affected by the challenged actions during the \npendency of this litigation. See Griepentrog, 945 F.2d at 154 (requiring competent evidence \nto substantiate a claim of irreparable harm).  Their allegations of economic harm from \nlost contracts are thus bare, speculative assertions that are insufficient to support a \nfinding of irreparable harm.6  See, e.g., Wis. Gas. Co. v. Fed. Energy Regul. Comm’n, 758 F.2d \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiffs’ reliance on Thompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610 (6th Cir. 2020), Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers), and Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 2305 (2018), \nis misplaced.  None support the theory that states suffer irreparable injury whenever the \nfederal government “prevent[s]” them “from effectuating” their own laws.  See Mot. at \n24 (citation omitted).  If such a rule existed, a state would suffer irreparable harm per se \nfrom all federal laws with preemptive effect.  Instead, each case held that a state defend-\nant established irreparable harm sufficient to grant a stay of a lower court’s injunction \nbarring the state from enforcing a challenged state law—a scenario not at issue here.  \n6 As explained above, see supra § I, Plaintiffs Stevens and Hildenbrand, two Ohio Sheriffs \nwho have sued in their official capacities, likewise fail to point to any covered contract to \n27 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 40 of 45 - Page ID#: 694\n669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985). \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs are incorrect to assert that any theoretical economic harm \nresulting from the loss of a federal procurement contract would be unrecoverable, as a \nstate agency or subdivision could seek recovery for such loss in the Court of Federal \nClaims under the Contract Disputes Act (“CDA”), 41 U.S.C. §§ 7101–7109. The CDA \n“applies to any express or implied contract entered into by an executive agency for the \nprocurement  of  property,  services,  construction,  repair,  or  the  disposal  of  personal \nproperty.” Anselma Crossing, L.P. v. USPS, 637 F.3d, 238, 240 (3d Cir. 2011).  And under \n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2), the Court of Federal Claims “has jurisdiction to decide both \nmonetary and non-monetary disputes” arising under the CDA, “including a dispute \nconcerning termination of a contract.”  See Clearwater Constructors, Inc. v. United States, 56 \nFed. Cl. 303, 307 (Fed. Cl. 2003) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(2).  \n Similarly,  to the  extent  a  state  agency  or subdivision  were  to  challenge  the \nsolicitation requirements for any new contracts with a COVID-19 safety clause, Plaintiffs \nmay bring an action in the Court of Federal Claims “objecting to a solicitation by a Federal \nagency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award \nof a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a \nprocurement or a proposed procurement.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1).  This encompasses “all \nstages of the process of acquiring property or services, beginning with the process for \ndetermining a need for property or services and ending with contract completion and \ncloseout.”  Distributed Sols., Inc. v. United States, 539 F.3d 1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2008) \n(citation omitted). \nBut even assuming for argument’s sake that Plaintiffs’ theoretical economic losses \nwere unrecoverable, that fact alone would not itself “compel a finding of irreparable \nharm.”  Cardinal Health Inc. v. Holder, 846 F. Supp. 2d 203, 211 (D.D.C. 2012) (citation \n                                                 \nwhich they are, or will soon be, a party.  There are thus no grounds upon which to find \nthat the challenged actions will cause them imminent, irreparable harm.  \n28 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 41 of 45 - Page ID#: 695\nomitted).  For such a rule would “effectively eliminate the irreparable harm requirement” \nagainst the federal government, in that “[a]ny movant that could show any damages \nagainst an agency with sovereign immunity—even as little as $1—would satisfy the \nstandard.”  Air Trans. Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. Exp.-Imp. Bank of the U.S., 840 F. Supp. 2d 327, \n335 (D.D.C. 2012).  Instead, to support a preliminary injunction, economic harm must “be \ngreat, certain and imminent,” Cardinal Health, 46 F. Supp. 2d at 211 (citation omitted), \n“even where it is irretrievable because a defendant has sovereign immunity,” Air Trans., \n840 F. Supp. 2d at 335.  Plaintiffs provide no evidence on which to find that they will \nsuffer certain and imminent irreparable economic injury.  \nIV.  The Requested Preliminary Relief Is Contrary To The Public Interest.  \nThe third and fourth requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction—the \nbalance of harms and whether the requested injunction will disserve the public interest—\n“merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n(2009).  Here, these considerations tilt decisively in Defendants’ favor. \nFirst, enjoining the challenged actions would harm the public interest in slowing \nthe spread of COVID-19 among millions of employees of federal contractors and the \npublic at large.  ”Stemming the spread of COVID-19 is unquestionably a compelling \ninterest.”  Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020).  Numerous \ncourts reviewing “executive action designed to slow the spread of COVID-19” have \nconcluded that “[t]he public interest in protecting human life—particularly in the face of \na global and unpredictable pandemic—would not be served by” an injunction.7   \nSecond,  enjoining  the  challenged  actions  would  harm  the  public  interest  by \nhampering  the  efficiency  of  federals  contractors  on  which  the  federal  government \ndepends.    The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  interfered  with  numerous  aspects  of  the \n                                                 \n7 See, e.g., Tigges v. Northam, 473 F. Supp. 3d 559, 573–74 (E.D. Va. 2020); Am.’s Frontline \nDrs. v. Wilcox, No. EDCV 21-1243, 2021 WL 4546923, at *8 (C.D. Cal. July 30, 2021); TJM \n64, Inc. v. Harris, 475 F. Supp. 3d 828, 840–41 (W.D. Tenn. 2020). \n29 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 42 of 45 - Page ID#: 696\ngovernment’s work by, for example, forcing office closures, interfering with employees’ \naccess to paper-based records, limiting official travel, and causing staffing shortages.  See \nPandemic Response Accountability Committee, Top Challenges Facing Federal Agencies \n(June 2020), https://perma.cc/GGF4-F4FV.  Requiring federal contractors to ensure that \ntheir employees become fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with exceptions only as \nrequired by law, reduces disruptions caused by worker absences associated with illness \nor exposure to the virus, generating meaningful gains in efficiency.  Enjoining EO 14042 \nand its implementing guidance would prevent these gains and would likely interfere \nwith federal contractors’ ability to resume normal, pre-pandemic operations.   \nGranting the requested preliminary injunction would not “preserve the status \nquo” (as Plaintiffs suggest, see Mot. 9), but would instead upend it by (i) preventing \nfurther implementation of EO 14042, which has been in effect for over two months; and \n(ii) interfering with the federal government’s ability to determine the terms on which it \nwill enter into contracts.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 428–29 (explaining that enjoining a \ngovernment policy is an act of “judicial intervention” that “alter[s] the legal status quo”); \nBrown v. Gilmore, 533 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2001) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers) (explaining that \n“an injunction against the enforcement of a presumptively valid” enactment should only \nbe granted in extraordinary circumstances).  In sum, granting the pending motion would \nharm the public interest far more than denying the motion would harm Plaintiffs, and \nthe motion should therefore be denied. \nFinally, although preliminary relief is unjustified here, at a minimum, any such \nrelief should be no broader than necessary to redress Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.  Plaintiffs \nask the Court to enter a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants “from enforcing” \na vaccination mandate “on any federal contracting agency, subcontractor [or] employee[] \nanywhere in the United States.” Compl., Prayer for Relief.  No such relief is warranted.  A \nfederal court’s “constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the \npeople appearing before it,” “[a] plaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the \n30 \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 27   Filed: 11/16/21   Page: 43 of 45 - Page ID#: 697\nplaintiff’s particular injury.”  Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1933–34 (2018) (citation \nomitted); see also Kentucky v. Yellen, ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 4394249, at *8 (E.D. Ky. \nSept. 24, 2021) (concluding that “the Sixth Circuit has already defined the outer-bounds \nof this Court’s powers”).  Nationwide injunctions “take a toll on the federal court \nsystem—preventing  legal  questions  from  percolating  through  the  federal  courts, \nencouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts \nand for the Executive Branch.”  Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2425 (2018) (Thomas, J., \nconcurring).  EO 14042 and its implementing guidance have been challenged in other \ncases, underscoring why this Court should not attempt to decide its legality for all parties.  \nHere, the only contracts that Kentucky has identified in its motion are the five \ncontracts with ICE or the U.S. Marshals Service, none of which are covered contracts. \nEven assuming these contracts give Kentucky standing to challenge the EO and its \nimplementing guidance, any relief should be tailored to those five contracts and limited \nto  the  states  of  Ohio  and  Kentucky.    Moreover,  any  relief  should  merely  block \nenforcement—not inclusion—of a COVID-19 safety clause.  Allowing COVID-19 safety \nclauses to be included but not enforced during the pendency of this litigation best \npreserves the legal status quo:  As long as the injunction remains in place, contractor \nemployees within its scope need not be vaccinated.  But if EO 14042 and its implementing \nguidance are ultimately upheld, the policy can be put into effect without further delay.  \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction should be denied. \n \nDATED: November 16, 2021    Respectfully submitted, \n \n            BRIAN M.

As \nexplained below, Defendants seek an emergency stay of the Court’s order pending appeal \ngiven  the  Defendant’s  likelihood  of  success  on  appeal;  the  likelihood  that  the \nGovernment will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a stay, including harm to its \nability to contract under terms of its choosing and other governmental interests; and the \nlikelihood of harm to third parties and the public interest. \nDefendants  understand  the  Court’s  order  to  prevent  federal  agencies  from \n1 \n\nenforcing, within the Plaintiff States of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, those contract \nprovisions described in its order that are included in certain categories of government \ncontracts pursuant to Executive Order 14042, so long as the preliminary injunction \nremains in place.  Order at 29 (enjoining the Government “from enforcing the vaccine \nmandate for federal contractors and subcontractors in all covered contracts in Kentucky, \nOhio, and Tennessee”); see also Transcript of 11/18/2021 Hearing (“Transcript”), at 66:12–\n17 (“THE COURT: It doesn’t sound like you’re trying to keep the federal government \nfrom including the provisions in their contracts.  You just want an injunction against the \nenforcement of that provision preliminarily pending the final resolution.  [Counsel for \nPlaintiffs]: That’s right.”); Defs.’ Opp., ECF No. 27 at 31 (“any relief should merely block \nenforcement—not  inclusion—of  a  COVID-19  safety  clause.”).    Defendants  also \nunderstand  that  the  injunction  is  not  limited  to  enforcement  of  the  Safer  Federal \nWorkforce Task Force’s vaccination requirements, but also prevents federal agencies \nfrom enforcing requirements related to masking and physical distancing.  See 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 63,418; id. at 63, 420–21. \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court should stay the effect of its preliminary \ninjunction until the Defendants have completed their appeal.  In the alternative, at a \nminimum,  the  Court  should  stay  its  order  insofar  as  it  prohibits  Defendants  from \nenforcing COVID-19 safety clauses in federal contracts with non-parties in Kentucky, \nOhio, and Tennessee—a stay that would cause Plaintiffs no prejudice while otherwise \npreserving the status quo as Defendants seek appellate review. \nARGUMENT \nThe factors governing a request for a stay pending appeal are “(1) the likelihood \nthat the party seeking the stay will prevail on the merits of the appeal; (2) the likelihood \nthat the moving party will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) the prospect that \nothers will be harmed if the court grants the stay; and (4) the public interest in granting \n2 \n\nthe stay.”  Michigan Coal. of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 \n(6th Cir. 1991).  Where the federal government is a party, its interests and the public \ninterest overlap.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 420 (2009). \nI.  The Balance Of Harms And Public Interest Warrant A Stay Pending Appeal. \nBecause the balance of the harms and the public interest weigh so overwhelmingly \nin favor of a stay, Defendants address those factors first.  As this Court has already \nrecognized, the “OMB Determination provided ample support for the premise that a \nvaccine mandate will improve procurement efficiency.” Order at 26; see also 86 Fed. Reg. \n63,421–23; see also Determination of the Acting OMB Director Regarding the Revised Safer \nFederal  Workforce  Task  Force  Guidance  for  Federal  Contractors  and  the  Revised \nEconomy & Efficiency Analysis, 86 Fed. Reg. 63418 (“OMB Determination”). \n Delaying the “implementation of the COVID-19 workplace safeguards issued \npursuant to the Executive Order would result in a significant reduction in economy and \nefficiency in the Federal Government’s procurement of essential services that are required \nto support the American people, combat the COVID-19 crisis, and carry out national \nsecurity missions at a critical time for our Nation.”  Declaration of Lesley A. Field, the \nActing Administrator and Deputy Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy in the \nOffice of Management and Budget and member of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory \nCouncil (“FAR Council”).  Ex. A, ¶ 3 (“Field Decl.”).   \nEnjoining the enforcement of contract clauses that require vaccination, masking, \nand physical distancing will decrease the economy and efficiency of federal procurement.  \nThe effects of any injunction will not only impact federal operations, but will also disrupt \ncontractor  activity  beyond  the  borders  of  the  Plaintiff  States  and  will  undermine \nimportant national interests. \nFirst, “the injunction will impose an immediate and significant category of harm \nin the form of productivity losses on Federal contracts performed in Ohio, Tennessee, and \n3 \n\nKentucky.”  Field Decl. ¶ 7.  Losses will come from “schedule delays,” “leave and health \ncare costs for workers who are sick, isolating, or quarantined and unable to perform,” \n“reduced performance quality,” “delays in companies being able to return teleworking \nemployees safely to physical workplaces,” “reprocurement costs” and “downstream \nprogram impacts where one Federal program is dependent on the timely performance of \nanother program that is supported by a contractor impacted by the injunction.”  Id. ¶ 9. \nSecond,  delayed  implementation  of  COVID-19  safeguards  will  disrupt \nproductivity outside Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.  “Prime contractors in other states \nwho depend on subcontractors covered by the injunction will likely experience delays of \ntheir  own  as  they  make  schedule  adjustments  to  accommodate  subcontractors \nexperiencing schedule delays, workforce shortages, and schedule disruptions, or look for \nother suppliers, which could drive up costs for Federal customers.”  Id. ¶ 16. \nFinally,  the  disruption  caused  by  the  preliminary  injunction  will  reverberate \nacross the entire nation.  “[M]ission disruptions” caused by inability to enforce COVID-\n19 safety protocols “will hinder the Federal Government’s ability to combat the current \nCOVID-19 pandemic, respond to COVID-19 variants and future pandemics as they arise, \nand carry out National security missions.”  Id. ¶ 18.  “Major defense-related programs \nhaving activity spanning across all States will also be negatively affected by delays and \ndisruptions caused in these three States,” including “the manufacturing of munitions and \naerospace parts for fighter jets, fueling nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, and \noperation of research facilities for the advancement of defense capabilities related to \nscience, technology, engineering, math, transportation, and logistics.” Id. at ¶ 20. \nBy contrast, Plaintiffs have identified no irreparable injury that would result from \na stay.  Plaintiffs fail to identify any new contracts that they plan to seek that contain a \nfederal vaccine requirement, see Order at 6, thus any harm they might suffer from \n“los[ing] out on future federal contracts” is purely speculative, contra id. at 26.  Although \nPlaintiffs note that many companies  in their states have  contracts with the federal \n4 \n\ngovernment, they identify no imminent injury to those contractors that would result from \na stay and make the unwarranted assumption that contractors generally oppose a vaccine \nrequirement.  Moreover, the Federal Government here is exercising its constitutional \nauthority to manage federal contracts; the challenged actions thus do not invade an area \n“constitutionally  reserved”  to  the  state  Plaintiffs.  Contra  Order  at  27  (quoting  BST \nHoldings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *8); see also Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass’n, \n452 U.S. 264, 291 (1981).  And “the individual Plaintiffs”—“who are suing in their official \ncapacities,” Order at 7 n.6 (emphasis added)—did not allege any “loss of constitutional \nfreedoms” that would constitute irreparable injury. Contra id. at 27 (quoting BST Holdings, \n2021 WL 5279381, at *8). \nII.  The Government Is Likely To Succeed On The Merits. \nDefendants acknowledge that this Court has found that EO 14042 likely exceeds \nthe President’s authority under FPASA, 40 U.S.C. § 121(a).  Defendants nevertheless sub-\nmit that they are likely to succeed in arguing to the contrary on appeal.  The President, to \nwhom FPASA expressly grants “a broad delegation of power” to manage federal pro-\ncurement, see Order at 11, acted well within his delegated authority in issuing a federal \ncontractor vaccine requirement to limit the spread of COVID-19 among the federal con-\ntractor workforce. \nFPASA expressly empowers the President to “prescribe policies and directives \nthat the President considers necessary to carry out” the Act’s purpose of creating an “eco-\nnomical and efficient system” of federal procurement.  40 U.S.C. §§ 101, 121(a).  “[T]his \npower has its limits,” however.  Order at 14.  A presidential policy or directive must be \n“consistent” with FPASA, 40 U.S.C. § 121(a)—that is, it must “reasonably relate[] to . . . \nensuring efficiency and economy in government procurement.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. \nFriedman, 639 F.2d 164, 170 (4th Cir. 1981); accord AFL-CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784, 793 & \nn.49 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (en banc).  \n5 \n\nEO 14042 easily satisfies this “lenient” standard.  See UAW-Lab. Emp. & Training \nCorp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 366 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  Faced with a once-in-a-century pandemic \nthat upended the American economy, threatened the health of the American workforce, \nand disrupted the operations of federal contractors, it is hard to conceive of a procure-\nment policy that would be more likely to create safer contractor work environments, re-\nduce employee absenteeism, and reduce contractors’ cost of labor over the long term than \na vaccination requirement for contractor employees.  Indeed, as this Court held, the OMB \nDirector’s thorough analysis of the economic impact of compliance with the Task Force \nguidance among federal contractors provides “ample support for the premise that a vac-\ncine mandate will improve procurement efficiency.”  Order at 26; see also Determination \nof the Acting OMB Director Regarding the Revised Safer Federal Workforce Task Force \nGuidance for Federal Contractors and the Revised Economy & Efficiency Analysis, 86 \nFed. Reg. 63,418, 63,418 (Nov. 16, 2021), http://federalregister.gov/d/2021-24949; ECF No. \n27 at 14–16.  Therefore, because there exists a self-evident nexus between the federal con-\ntractor vaccination requirement and economy and efficiency in federal procurement, EO \n14042 rests squarely on the authority Congress delegated to the President under FPASA.  \nPlaintiffs are also unlikely to show that the challenged actions conflict with the \nCompetition in Contracting Act (“CICA”), which requires “full and open competition” \nand “competitive procedures.”  41 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1).  As Defendants explained, see ECF \nNo. 27 at 12, National Government Services, Inc. v. United States, 923 F.3d 977 (Fed. Cir. \n2019), upholds “the unremarkable proposition that a solicitation requirement . . . is not \nnecessarily objectionable simply because that requirement has the effect of excluding cer-\ntain offerors who cannot satisfy that requirement.”  Id. at 985-86; contra Order at 15.  If \nanything, National Government Services teaches that solicitation requirements excluding \nofficers do not violate CICA as long as the agency has a reason for establishing the re-\nquirement, which might be because the requirement will “likely result in reduced overall \n6 \n\ncost for the procurement.”  923 F.3d at 986.  In other words, when the Government in-\ncludes a clause that promotes economy and efficiency, it does not run afoul of CICA \nsimply because some contractors refusing to enter a contract with that clause decline to \nsubmit a bid for that contract.  So for the same reasons that EO 14042 and the Task Force \nguidance are likely to promote economy and efficiency in federal procurement, EO 14042 \nand its implementing guidance are unlikely to violate CICA. \nFurthermore, FPASA’s delegation raises no constitutional concerns.  “Only twice \nin this country’s history” (and only in 1935) has the Supreme Court “found a delegation \nexcessive—in each case because ‘Congress had failed to articulate any policy or standard’ \nto confine discretion.”  Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2129 (2019) (plurality opinion) \n(emphasis added) (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373 n.7 (1989)).  “By \ncontrast,” the Supreme Court has “over and over upheld even very broad delegations.”  \nId. at 2129; see also id. at 2130–31 (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment) (“[S]ince 1935, the \nCourt has uniformly rejected nondelegation arguments and has upheld provisions that \nauthorized agencies to adopt important rules pursuant to extraordinarily capacious stand-\nards.” (emphasis added)).   Here, Congress did not “fail[] to articulate any policy or stand-\nard to confine [the President’s] discretion,” which is the only available basis upon which \nto find a congressional delegation invalid. See id. at 2129 (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  Rather, FPASA provides the requisite “intelligible principle” to which \nthe President must conform, see Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372, by authorizing him, as CEO of \nthe Federal Government, to “prescribe policies and directives” that he “considers neces-\nsary” to promote economy and efficiency in the narrow field of federal procurement of \nproperty and services, see 40 U.S.C. § 121(a); see also id. § 101. \n Nor do the challenged actions offend the Tenth Amendment.  It is undisputed that \nCongress enacted FPASA under its Spending Clause authority, U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. \n1, and the Court squarely rejected Plaintiffs’ argument that EO 14042 and its implement-\n7 \n\ning guidance exceed that authority.  See Order at 14–15 n.9.  And where, as here, “Con-\ngress acts under one of its enumerated powers”—and the Executive Branch acts pursuant \nto a delegation of those powers—“there can be no violation of the Tenth Amendment.”  \nSee United States v. Mikhel, 889 F.3d 1003, 1024 (9th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted); accord \nTown of Johnston v. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency, 765 F.3d 80, 86 (1st Cir. 2014); United States v. \nHatch, 722 F.3d 1193, 1202 (10th Cir. 2013).  This case is therefore plainly distinguishable \nfrom BST Holdings, contra Order at 20, in which the Fifth Circuit found that the federal \naction being challenged there “likely exceeds the federal government’s authority under \nthe Commerce Clause.”  2021 WL 5279381, at *7.  Moreover, there is no Tenth Amend-\nment issue where the Federal Government, in exercising its constitutionally delegated \nauthority, “step[s] into an area traditionally reserved to the States,” contra Order at 20, or \n“displaces the States’ exercise of their police powers,” see Hodel, 452 U.S. at 291; accord \nGarcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 550 (1985); Maryland v. \nWirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 195 (1968).  As the Supreme Court explained in Garcia, courts have \n“no license to employ freestanding conceptions of state sovereignty when measuring” \nfederal authority under the Constitution, id. at 550, because any attempt by a court “to \narticulate affirmative limits on [federal] power in terms of core governmental functions \nand fundamental attributes of state sovereignty” is “both impracticable and doctrinally \nbarren,” id. at 556–57.  \nIII.   The Court should stay its order as to non-parties or, if it does not issue such a \nstay, at least clarify that the United States is not enjoined from entering into \nmutual, voluntary agreements with non-party contractors to add and enforce the \nCOVID-19 safety protocols.  \nSetting the merits aside, at a minimum, the Court should stay its order insofar as \nit prohibits Defendants from enforcing COVID-19 safety clauses in federal contracts with \nnon-parties in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.  As the Court explained, “redressability \nin the present case is properly limited to the parties before the Court.”  See Order at 28; \naccord Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1921, 1933–34 (2018); Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr. \n8 \n\nInc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994).  But the Court’s order appears to exceed that limitation by \nenjoining the United States from “enforcing the vaccine mandate,” not just with respect \nto contracts with the named plaintiffs, but “for federal contractors and subcontractors in \nall covered contracts in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.”  Order at 29.   Defendants rec-\nognize that the Court held that the Plaintiffs provided a sufficient showing that they \nwould be injured by the enforcement of the COVID-19 safety clauses in contracts with \nother entities.   See Order at 6.  But Defendants respectfully contend that they are likely \nto prevail on that issue on appeal, because Supreme Court precedent forecloses a State’s \nability to bring suit against the federal government “to protect her citizens from the op-\neration of federal statutes” like FPASA. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 n.17 \n(2007); see also Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 610 n.16 (1982) (“A \nState does not have standing as parens patriae to bring an action against the Federal Gov-\nernment.” (citing Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485-486 (1923), and Missouri v. Il-\nlinois, 180 U.S. 208, 241 (1901))).  And because the Federal Government does not “invade[] \nareas reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment simply because it exercises its au-\nthority . . . in a manner that displaces the States’ exercise of their police powers,” Hodel, \n452 U.S. at 291, there is no threat to the Plaintiffs’ sovereignty that would justify enjoining \nDefendants’ enforcement of COVID-19 safety clauses against non-parties within Plain-\ntiffs’ borders.  Contra Order at 6, 27.  Accordingly, even if the Court does not stay its order \nin its entirety, the Court should limit its injunction to only prohibit Defendants from en-\nforcing COVID-19 safety clauses contained in federal contracts to which Plaintiffs (or \ntheir state agencies or subdivisions) are a party.  \nAdditionally, Defendants respectfully request that the Court provide clarification \nthat its preliminary injunction does not prohibit private federal contractors in Kentucky, \nOhio, and Tennessee from agreeing with Defendants to include COVID-19 safety clauses \nin their federal contracts, thus allowing those federal contractors to voluntarily comply \nwith the Task Force Guidelines, including requiring their employees to be vaccinated.  \n9 \n\nDefendants believe this would be consistent with the scope of the injunction Plaintiffs \nrequested.  See Transcript at 65 (“[T]o be clear, Your Honor, our request for relief is not \nan injunction of any sort that would be applicable to -- that would enjoin private parties \nfrom doing whatever they want.”); see also id. at 66 (“[C]ertainly, if a party in Kentucky \nwas a subcontractor for a federal contractor outside these three states, and that other pri-\nvate party comes to them and says, We’ve, you know, . . . want to have this in our con-\ntracts and subcontracts, we’re not seeking any injunction that would keep a private party \nfrom signing any contract they want.”); id. (“What we want to enjoin is the Executive \nOrder and then the actions taken by OMB, FAR and the Task Force pursuant to it that \npurport to require parties to agree to it as part of receiving or maintaining a federal con-\ntract.” (emphasis added)).  \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants respectfully request that the Court stay its order pending appeal and \nenter an immediate administrative stay while this motion is under consideration.  \n \nDATED: December 3, 2021     Respectfully submitted, \n \n            BRIAN M.

Stevens, in his \nofficial capacity as Sheriff for the Seneca County (Ohio) Sheriff’s Office; and Scott A. \nHildenbrand, in his official capacity as Sheriff for the Geauga County (Ohio) Sheriff’s \nOffice, move for a temporary restraining order under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b) and \npreliminary injunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a).  \nINTRODUCTION \n“Get vaccinated.” \nPresident Biden ended his September remarks on the COVID–19 pandemic \nwith these words.  Joseph Biden, Remarks at the White House (Sept. 9, 2021), \navailable at https://perma.cc/GQG5-YBXK (“Biden Remarks”).  Plaintiff States have \nrecommended the same.  But the President was not recommending vaccination; he \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 2 of 35 - Page ID#: 235\n \nwas commanding it.  Until quite recently, the Biden Administration recognized that \ncompulsory vaccination is “not the role of the federal government.”  Press Briefing by \nPress  Secretary  Jen  Psaki,  July  23,  2021,  White  House,  available  at \nhttps://perma.cc/Q32Z-5S6M.  \nBut in a dramatic about-face from his prior position, the President followed his \nremarks by signing an order to “require more Americans to be vaccinated,” id.—\nExecutive Order 14042, 86 Fed. Reg. 50,985 (Sept. 9, 2021).  That order, and his \nAdministration’s directives that have followed, impose a vaccine mandate on wide \nswaths of Americans.   \nThe thin justification for the mandate asserts that it will “reduc[e] absenteeism \nand  decreas[e]  labor  costs  for  contractors  and  subcontractors  working  on  or  in \nconnection  with  a  Federal  Government  contract.”    See  Determination  of  the \nPromotion of Economy and Efficiency in Federal Contracting Pursuant to Executive \nOrder No. 14042, 86 Fed. Reg. 53,691 (Sept. 28, 2021) (“OMB Determination”).  But \neven if the mandate might produce this result (and it will not), and assuming such a \ncursory  statement  constitutes  reasoned  decisionmaking  (and  it  does  not),  the \nPresident and his Administration lacked the authority to order the mandate, and \nthey failed to follow the administrative procedures required to issue such an order.  \nEven in a pandemic, “our system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in \nthe pursuit of desirable ends.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health and Human \nServs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2490 (2021) (per curiam).   \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 3 of 35 - Page ID#: 236\n \nThe Plaintiffs seek judicial relief from the President’s and his Administration’s \nunlawful and unconstitutional vaccine mandate.  The mandate is unlawful for four \nreasons.     \nFirst,  in  taking  either  relevant  executive  action,  the  President  and  his \nAdministration  did  not  even  try  to  satisfy  the  notice-and-comment  procedures \nrequired by 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)(1).  They did not do so when the Office of Management \nand Budget (“OMB”) issued its September 28, 2021 determination without notice and \ncomment.  Likewise, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (“FAR Council”) \nfailed to provide for notice and comment before issuing its September 30, 2021 \nmemorandum.

The  federal \ngovernment lacks the authority to issue this mandate, and its attempt to do so \ndisregards traditional principles of federalism, exceeds the spending power, and \nviolates the nondelegation doctrine.  \nBACKGROUND \nExecutive Order 13991 – Creation of the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force \nOn his first day in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 13991, 86 \nFed. Reg. 7,045, 7,046 (Jan. 20, 2021).  Section 4 established the “Safer Federal \nWorkforce Task Force.”2  Id. at 7,046.  The mission of the Task Force is to “provide \nongoing guidance to heads of agencies on the operation of the Federal Government, \nthe safety of its employees, and the continuity of Government functions during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.”  Id.   \nFor the first six months of the Administration, neither the Task Force nor any \nfederal agency sought to impose vaccine mandates on the American population.  As \nrecently as July 23, 2021, the White House announced that mandating vaccines is \n“not the role of the federal government.”  Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, \nJuly 23, 2021, White House, available at https://perma.cc/Q32Z-5S6M. \n \n                                            \n2 The Co-Chairs of the Task Force include Defendants Ahuja, Carnahan, and Zients.  \nId.; see also Compl. ¶ 87.  Members subordinate to the Co-Chairs include Defendants \nYoung, Patterson, Murray, Criswell, and Walensky.

Reg. 50,985 (Sept. 9, 2021).  The purpose of that order, and other \nexecutive  actions  announced  that  day,  was  to  “require  more  Americans  to  be \nvaccinated.”  See Biden Remarks.   \nExecutive  Order  14042  instructs  departments  and  agencies,  including \nindependent establishments, to require that contractors and subcontractors “comply \nwith all guidance for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations published by \nthe . . . Task Force . . . , provided that the Director of [the OMB] approves the Task \nForce Guidance and determines that the Guidance . . . will promote economy and \nefficiency in Federal contracting.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 50,985.   \nThe Executive Order provides a series of directives to carry out its mandate: \nthe newly created Task Force must create procurement standards, the OMB must \napprove those standards under the President’s supposed FPASA authorities, and the \nFAR Council must recommend that agencies deviate from the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation before a new regulation is published.  See id. at 50,985–88. \nThe Task Force’s September 24, 2021 Guidance \n  On September 24, 2021, President Biden’s Task Force, an invented group with \nno connection to federal procurement, issued its Guidance pursuant to Executive \nOrder 14042.  See Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, COVID–19 Workplace Safety: \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 6 of 35 - Page ID#: 239\n \nGuidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors (Sept. 24, 2021), available at \nhttps://perma.cc/2R27-9J4U (“Task Force Guidance”).   \nThe  Task  Force  Guidance  requires  an  extremely  broad  range  of  covered \ncontractor employees to be vaccinated by December 8, 2021.  For example, the FAQ \nsection provides that the Guidance covers outdoor areas, employees who are not \ndirectly engaged in performing work called for by the covered contract, and employees \nwho work entirely from home.  Id. at 9-14.  Only if the employee is “legally entitled \nto an exception,” does the Guidance not require vaccination.  Id. at 5.   \nTo comply with that mandate, “[c]overed contractor employees must be fully \nvaccinated no later than December 8, 2021.”  Id. at 5.  This means that said employees \nmust obtain the final dose of their vaccine of choice no later than November 24, 2021.  \nSee  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  Different  COVID–19  Vaccines \n(updated  Oct.  20,  2021),  available  at  https://perma.cc/E3VW-PF5M  (noting  that \nindividuals are fully vaccinated two weeks after their final shot).        \nThe OMB’s September 28, 2021 Notice of Determination \n \nNext, the OMB issued its Notice of Determination on September 28, 2021, \npurportedly pursuant to the President’s delegated authority under FPASA, 40 U.S.C. \n§ 121(a).  See OMB Determination, 86 Fed. Reg at 53,692.   \nAs instructed by the President in Executive Order 14042, 86 Fed. Reg. at \n50,985–86, Defendant Young, in her capacity as Acting Director of the OMB, declared \n“that compliance by Federal contractors and subcontractors with the [Task Force \nGuidance]  will  improve  economy  and  efficiency  by  reducing  absenteeism  and \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 7 of 35 - Page ID#: 240\n \ndecreasing labor costs for contractors and subcontractors working on or in connection \nwith a Federal Government contract.”  OMB Determination, 86 Fed. Reg. at 53,692.  \nThat’s it.  The Determination did not contain any supporting analysis; it just adopted \nthe Task Force Guidance as helpful to “promote economy and efficiency,” a rote \nrecitation of the statute.   \nThe FAR Council’s September 30 Memorandum and Attached Deviation \nClause \n \nThe Executive Order tasked the FAR Council with “amend[ing] the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation,” the federal-government-wide regulation agencies must use \nto draft procurement solicitation and contracts, see 48 C.F.R. Ch. 1, to incorporate the \nTask Force Guidance, as approved by OMB.  86 Fed. Reg. at 50,986.  The President \nalso tasked the FAR Council with “recommending” agencies incorporate the Task \nForce Guidance earlier, under each agency’s authority to deviate from the existing \nFederal Acquisition Regulation.  Id.   \nThe FAR Council did just that.  On September 30, 2021, the FAR Council \nissued  its  Guidance  for  government  officials  with  responsibility  for  government \ncontracting to assist agencies in mandating contractor and subcontractor compliance \nwith the Task Force Guidance, prior to amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  \nSee FAR Council Guidance.  The “deviation clause” attached to the FAR Council \nGuidance  provides  the  text  that  federal  contractors  should  use  to  mandate \ncompliance with the Task Force Guidance:  \n(c)  Compliance.  The  Contractor  shall  comply  with  all  guidance, \nincluding guidance conveyed through Frequently Asked Questions, as \namended  during  the  performance  of  this  contract,  for  contractor  or \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 8 of 35 - Page ID#: 241\n \nsubcontractor  workplace  locations  published  by  the  Safer  Federal \nWorkforce  Task  Force  (Task  Force  Guidance)  at \nhttps:/www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/ \n(d) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this \nclause, including this paragraph (d), in subcontracts at any tier that \nexceed  the  simplified  acquisition  threshold,  as  defined  in  Federal \nAcquisition Regulation 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, and are \nfor services, including construction, performed in whole or in part within \nthe United States or its outlying areas.  \nId. at 5.  \n  Multiple agencies have already notified contractors, who have then notified \nsubcontractors, that this language will be added to existing contracts.  See Stevens \nDecl. 2–18. \nThe Federal Contractor Vaccine Mandate’s Disruptive Impact \n  Unsurprisingly, the federal contractor vaccine mandate disrupts a sizeable \nportion of the U.S. labor force.  “Workers employed by federal contractors” account \nfor  “approximately  one-fifth  of  the  entire  U.S.  labor  force.”  Office  of  Contract \nCompliance Programs, Dep’t of Labor, History of Executive Order 11246, available at \nhttps://perma.cc/9NF2-WX2B  (emphasis  added).    This  section  of  the  labor  force \nincludes significant proportions of the labor force in each Plaintiff State.  According \nto a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 72% of unvaccinated workers say they will \nquit their jobs if they are subjected to such a mandate.  See Chris Isidore & Virginia \nLangmaid, 72% of unvaccinated workers vow to quit if ordered to get vaccinated, CNN \n(Oct. 28, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/7JMV-SULY.  This finding portends a \nmassive disruption in the economy and to the operations of Plaintiffs, as well as the \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 9 of 35 - Page ID#: 242\n \nmillions of citizens served by Plaintiffs.  See Compl. ¶¶ 1–48; Niknejad Decl. ¶¶ 4–\n12.   \nARGUMENT \n \nWhen ruling on a preliminary injunction, the Court must consider:  \n1) whether the movant has shown a strong likelihood of success on the \nmerits;  2)  whether  the  movant  will  suffer  irreparable  harm  if  the \ninjunction is not issued; 3) whether the issuance of the injunction would \ncause substantial harm to others; and 4) whether the public interest \nwould be served by issuing the injunction.  \n \nTabernacle Baptist Church, Inc. of Nicholasville v. Beshear, 459 F. Supp. 3d 847, 853 \n(E.D. Ky. 2020).  “These factors are not prerequisites, but are factors to be balanced \nagainst each other.”  Overstreet v. Lexington-Fayette Urban Cty. Gov’t, 305 F.3d 566, \n573 (6th Cir. 2002).  However, where, as here, a violation of the Constitution is \nalleged, the first factor—the likelihood of success on the merits—largely dominates \nthe analysis.  See City of Pontiac Retired Emps. Ass’n v. Schimmel, 751 F.3d 427, 430 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (per curiam).  Even so, all four factors decidedly favor \ngranting a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to preserve the \nstatus quo. \nI.  The Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \n  The actions of the Administration violate administrative and procurement law \nand pose serious constitutional questions.  The OMB and the FAR Council have acted \ncontrary to procedure required by law in imposing the vaccine mandate.  The OMB \nacted contrary to law in attempting to circumvent the FAR Council, the only entity \nCongress has authorized to make government-wide procurement regulations.  In \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 10 of 35 - Page ID#: 243\n \naddition, by failing to include any rationale for their actions (much less a logical one), \nThe OMB and the FAR Council acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  Finally, the \nvaccine mandate intrudes on an area traditionally reserved to the States (public \nhealth and safety), and wrongly assumes that Congress delegated the President \nunfettered discretion to control federal contracts (a delegation Congress lacks the \npower to make).  \nA.  The  OMB  Determination  and  FAR  Council  Guidance  were \nissued in violation of procedure required by law.  \nUnder  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (APA),  a  “reviewing  court  shall \n. . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be \n. . . without observance of procedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D). \nThe President grounded the authority for his Administration’s actions in the \nFPASA.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 50985.  The purpose of that Act, among other things, “is \nto provide the Federal Government with an economical and efficient system for . . . \n[p]rocuring and supplying . . . nonpersonal services[.]”  40 U.S.C. § 101(1).  But: \n[A] procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an \namendment or modification thereto) may not take effect until 60 days \nafter it is published for public comment in the Federal Register . . . if \nit— \n \n(A) relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds; and \n \n(B)(i)  has  a  significant  effect  beyond  the  internal  operating \nprocedures of the agency issuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or \nform; or \n \n(ii) has a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or \nofferors. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 11 of 35 - Page ID#: 244\n \n41 U.S.C. § 1707(a).3   \nSection 1707(a) controls here.4  To start, with his invocation of the FPASA as \nthe statutory authority for his Administration’s vaccine mandate, see 86 Fed. Reg. at \n50,985, the President agrees his Administration’s actions are “procurement polic[ies], \nregulation[s], procedure[s], or form[s].”  See 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a).  Federal contracts \ninvolve the expenditure of appropriated federal funds, and the vaccine mandate has \nboth a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agencies and \na significant cost and administrative impact on the Plaintiffs.  See Compl. ¶¶ 1–48; \nNiknejad Decl. ¶¶ 4–12; Maddox Decl. ¶¶ 5–11.  The OMB Determination, which \napproves the vaccine mandate as a government-wide procurement policy, and the \nFAR Council guidance, which works to require5 that agencies incorporate the vaccine \nmandate in current contracts, were bound to follow Section 1707. \n  The Defendants entirely failed to publish the FAR Council Guidance in the \nFederal Register.  And although the Defendants published the OMB Determination \nin the Federal Register, it was not subject to comment, nor the requisite 60-day \n                                            \n3 Similarly, “proposed significant revisions” to the Federal Acquisition Regulation \nmust undergo notice and comment.  See 48 C.F.R. § 1.501–2(b); see also 48 C.F.R. § \n1.501–1 (defining “significant revisions” essentially by the same test outlined in § \n1707(a)).   \n4 The Plaintiffs invoke both 41 U.S.C. § 1707 and 5 U.S.C. § 553 but focus on § 1707 \nbecause it is more stringent.   \n5 While the FAR Council claims to be issuing only “guidance,” the guidance is being \n“applied . . . in a way that indicates it is binding.”  Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, 441 \n(5th Cir. 2019) (explaining that agency action treated as binding is reviewed as a \nregulation).  Even if it were not binding, it is still a procurement “policy” subject to § \n1707’s requirements.  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 12 of 35 - Page ID#: 245\n \ncomment  period  before  becoming  effective.    Nothing  indicates  that  Defendants \ninvoked Section 1707(d)’s waiver of the notice and comment requirement, or waiver \nof notice and comment under the APA.6  In short, Defendants failed to adhere to the \nprocess mandated by law, and their mandate is without observance of procedure \nrequired by law, and must therefore be set aside.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).     \nB.  The Administration acted contrary to law.  \n  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority, or limitations, \nor short of statutory right.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \na.  The President does not have the authority to issue procurement \nregulations under the FPASA. \n \nOnly the FAR Council has the authority to “issue and maintain . . . a single \n[g]overnment-wide procurement regulation.”  41 U.S.C. § 1303(a)(1).  Despite this, \nthe Executive Order asks OMB to issue a government-wide procurement regulation \nmandating vaccines.  86 Fed. Reg. at 50,985–96.  That violates Section 1303.  The \nOMB  Determination  also  violates  Section  1303  in  carrying  out  the  President’s \nunlawful instruction.  86 Fed. Reg. at 53,591–92.  And the FAR Council Guidance \nviolates Section 1303 because it abdicates the FAR Council’s responsibility to issue \ngovernment-wide procurement regulations, instead issuing cursory guidance about \nwhat agencies are “required” to do.  FAR Council Guidance at 2.  \n                                            \n6 Or waiver of notice and comment under 48 C.F.R. § 1.501–3.   \n12 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 13 of 35 - Page ID#: 246\n \nThe President instead invoked the FPASA, 40 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., as his \nauthority for issuing the federal contractor vaccine mandate.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at \n50985.  To start, the FPASA does not grant the President the power to issue orders \nwith the force or effect of law.  Congress authorized the President only to “prescribe \npolicies and directives that the President considers necessary to carry out.”  See 40 \nU.S.C. § 121(a).  “Policies and directives” describe the President’s power to direct the \nexercise of procurement authority throughout the government.  See Centralizing \nBorder Control Policy Under the Supervision of the Attorney General, 26 Op. O.L.C. \n22, 23 (2002) (“Congress may prescribe that a particular executive function may be \nperformed only by a designated official within the Executive Branch, and not by the \nPresident.”).  It does not authorize the President to issue regulations himself.   \nWe know this because Congress authorized the Administrator of the General \nServices  Administration—in  the  same  section  of  the  statute—to  “prescribe \nregulations.”  Id. at § 121(c); see also Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 711 n.9 \n(2004) (“[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the statute and \ndifferent  language  in  another,  the  court  assumes  different  meanings  were \nintended.”).  Not only that, Congress gave the President, in another section of the \nFPASA, the power to “prescribe regulations establishing procedures to carry out” the \nestablishment  of  motor  vehicle  pools  and  transportation  systems.    40  U.S.C.  § \n603(b)(1) (emphasis added).  And Congress has given the President the power to \n“prescribe regulations” in other contexts, typically in the realm of foreign affairs and \nnational defense.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3496 (“The President is authorized to prescribe \n13 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 14 of 35 - Page ID#: 247\n \nregulations  governing  the  manner  of  executing  and  returning  commissions  by \nconsular officers.”); 32 U.S.C. § 110 (“The President shall prescribe regulations, and \nissue orders, necessary to organize, discipline, and govern the National Guard.”). \n    Regardless the FPASA does not authorize the President, and thus does not \nauthorize  the  OMB,  to  issue  whatever  contracting  requirement  they  think  is \n“economical”  or  “efficient.”7    The  President  seems  to  assume  that  the  FPASA’s \nprefatory statement of purpose authorizes him and his delegates to issue any order \nthey believe promotes “an economical and efficient” procurement system.  40 U.S.C. \n§ 101; see 86 Fed. Reg. at 50,985 (“This order promotes economy and efficiency in \n[f]ederal procurement.”).  In doing so, the President and OMB mistakenly construe \nthe prefatory purpose statement for a grant of authority.  Dist. of Columbia v. Heller, \n554 U.S. 570, 578 (2008) (“[A]part from [a] clarifying function, a prefatory clause does \nnot limit or expand the scope of the operative clause.”); see also Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, \n51 F.3d 1053, 1060 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“[T]he agency may not simply disregard the \nspecific  scheme  Congress  has  created  .  .  .  in  order  to  follow  a  broad  purpose \nstatement.”).  \n                                            \n7 To be sure, there is authority embracing a broader reading of the FPASA, principally \nAFL-CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and its progeny.  But Kahn is \nwrongly decided.  Invoking the purpose statement in § 101, Kahn considers whether \nthe President can impose wage and price standards on contractors based on the \n“‘economy and efficiency’ touchstone” of the FPASA.  Kahn, 618 F.2d at 788, 793.  In \naddition to misreading § 101 as a grant of authority, the court conflates the FPASA’s \nlegislative history with its statutory text, id. at 788–89 n. 22–24, and turns basic \nstatutory interpretation on its head by treating specific examples in which Congress \nauthorized the use of the contracting power to advance policy—for example, setting \naside certain purchases for small businesses—as evidence that Congress authorized \nthe President to do so unilaterally in unrelated circumstances, id. at 789 & n.25. \n14 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 15 of 35 - Page ID#: 248\n \n    Indeed, the grant of authority to the President in FPASA is quite narrow. \nBeyond the fact that he is not authorized to issue regulations, his power is limited to \nprescribing policies and directives he “considers necessary to carry out this subtitle.” \n40 U.S.C. § 121(a) (emphasis added).  “Necessary” is a “word of limitation” and is \nsynonymous with “required,” “indispensable,” and “essential.”  Vorcheimer v. Phila. \nOwners Assoc., 903 F.3d 100, 105 (3d Cir. 2018); accord In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust \nLitig., 355 F.3d 322, 327 (4th Cir. 2004).  The President’s authority is therefore \nlimited to that which he considers “essential” or “indispensable” to carry out the \nFPASA. \n    And  even  if  the  FPASA  did  authorize  the  President  to  issue  binding \nprocurement orders in the name of economy and efficiency, the nexus between the \nOMB Determination and goal of the statute is far too attenuated.  See, e.g., Chrysler \nCorp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 304, 308 (1979).  Even courts that adopt a broader \nreading of the President’s power require a “reasonably close nexus between the \nefficiency and economy criteria of the [FPASA] and any exactions imposed upon \nfederal contractors.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Friedman, 639 F.2d 164, 170 (4th Cir. \n1981).   \n    To  that  end,  the  210-word  OMB  Determination  lacks  any  explanation \nindicating how the Task Force Guidance creates contracting efficiencies.  See OMB \nDetermination, 86 Fed. Reg. at 53,691–92.  Indeed, the opposite will occur.  See \nNiknejad Decl. ¶¶ 4–12; Maddox Decl. ¶¶ 5–11; Compl. ¶¶ 1–48.  Employers must \nspend time and resources determining who does or does not fall under the mandate.  \n15 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 16 of 35 - Page ID#: 249\n \nEmployees who wish to be vaccinated must be given time off to receive and to recover \nfrom effects of the vaccine.  Employees who do not wish to be vaccinated must prove \nthey qualify for an exemption.  See Task Force Guidance at 1.  Employers must \nprocess those requests, which will involve difficult decisions, and will certainly lead \nto litigation.  See Karl Evers-Hillstrom, 9 in 10 Employers Say They Fear They'll Lose \nUnvaccinated Workers Over Mandate: Survey, The Hill (Oct. 18, 2021), available at \nhttps://perma.cc/V5ZJ-7XUQ.  Many employees whose exemption requests are denied \nwill quit.  See Jordan Burrows, Employees Not Given Exemption Prefer to Quit Job \nThan Get COVID Vaccine, Poll Shows, Salt Lake City (ABC4) (Sept. 15, 2021), \navailable  at  https://perma.cc/6A95-CJXD;  see  also  Isidore  &  Langmaid,  supra.  \nEmployers will have to find new employees, likely at great cost given the many \nemployers currently looking for employees.  There is no explanation whether, or how, \nthis egregious effort is outweighed by unidentified contracting efficiencies.   \nb.  The President and his Administration’s actions run afoul of the \nCompetition in Contracting Act.   \n \nFederal agencies are required to provide for “full and open competition through \nthe use of competitive procedures” in procurement.  41 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1).  The \nPresident’s authority under the FPASA is expressly subject to that requirement.  See \n40 U.S.C. § 121(a) (requiring “policies” issued by the President pursuant to FPASA to \nbe “consistent with this subtitle”); 40 U.S.C. § 111 (defining “this subtitle” to include \nportions of Title 41, including § 3301). \n  The  challenged  actions  violate  that  provision  because  they  “effectively \nexclude[] an offeror from winning an award, even if that offeror represents the best \n16 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 17 of 35 - Page ID#: 250\n \nvalue to the government.”  Nat’l Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. United States, 923 F.3d 977, 990 \n(Fed. Cir. 2019).  The Defendants refuse to consider the specific situation of particular \nbidders, instead categorically excluding contractors that refuse to acquiesce to the \nAdministration’s  sweeping  COVID  policies.    By  excluding  an  entire  class  of \ncontractors without regard to their ability to perform the contract, the challenged \nactions violate Section 3301. \nC.  The Administration acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  \n \nUnder the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis  “arbitrary  [or]  capricious.”    5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(A).    “The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-\ncapricious  standard  requires  that  agency  action  be  reasonable  and  reasonably \nexplained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021).  Courts \nmust ensure “the agency has acted within a zone of reasonableness and, in particular, \nhas reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision.”  \nId.  The APA also requires that agency action take into account the reliance interests \nof those affected by the regulatory action, including the States.  See Dep’t of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913-15 (2020).  Here, the federal \ncontractor vaccine mandate fails to satisfy these criteria.   \n  As mentioned, neither the OMB Determination nor the FAR Council Guidance \nprovide  any  explanation  for  how  they  promote  economy  and  efficiency  in \nprocurement.  See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2127 (2016) \n(“Whatever potential reasons the Department might have given, the agency in fact \ngave almost no reasons at all. . . . [C]onclusory statements do not suffice to explain \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 18 of 35 - Page ID#: 251\n \n[an agency’s] decision.”).  Defendants seemingly failed to consider the possibility that \ntheir actions would cause a labor shortage.  See Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 551 U.S. 664, 658 (2007) (explaining that an agency decision is arbitrary \nand capricious if the agency “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem” (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S. v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983))); see also Compl. ¶¶ 1–48 (outlining the negative economic \neffects of the mandate); Niknejad Decl. ¶¶ 4–12; Maddox Decl. ¶¶ 5–11.  These \nconcerns are particularly acute for the Plaintiff States and Plaintiff Sheriffs whose \nfederal contracts directly relate to public safety and staffing shortages in already \nunderstaffed detention centers.  See Compl. ¶¶ 4–7, 22–39; see also Niknejad Decl. \n¶¶ 4–12; Stevens Decl. 2–18; Hildenbrand Decl. 2–29; Maddox Decl. ¶¶ 5–11.   \nAdditionally, both the OMB Determination and FAR Council Guidance ignore \ncosts to the Plaintiffs, a “centrally relevant factor when deciding whether to regulate.”  \nMichigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 752–53 (2015).  The agencies ignored Plaintiffs’ \n“legitimate reliance” on the absence of a federal mandate which allowed them to act \nin accordance with setting their own policies.  See Regents of Univ. of Calif., 140 S. \nCt. at 1913.  The Task Force Guidance, the OMB Determination, and the FAR Council \nGuidance fail to reflect even a minimal awareness that the mandate will undermine \nPlaintiffs’ reliance interest and impose significant disruption into their economies \nand operations.  See Niknejad Decl. ¶¶ 4–12; Compl. ¶¶ 1–48.     \nMoreover, neither the OMB Determination nor the FAR Council Guidance \nconsiders lesser alternatives to a vaccine mandate.  See Regents of the Univ. of Cal., \n18 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 19 of 35 - Page ID#: 252\n \n140 S. Ct. at 1913–14.   \nAnd the fact that the Task Force continues to change and update its guidance, \nsee Safer Federal Workforce:  What’s New?, available at https://perma.cc/MB3M-397A \n(last visited Nov. 4, 2021), signals a knee-jerk, unsubstantiated mandate.     \nFinally,  the  conclusion  that  the  Task  Force  Guidance  and  FAR  Council \nGuidance  will  improve  procurement  efficiency  by  reducing  absenteeism  and \ndecreasing labor costs is blatantly pretextual.  See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. \nCt. 2551, 2576 (2019) (“Accepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the \nenterprise [of judicial review.]”).  As described earlier, the President, in his remarks \nannouncing the executive order, stated that he was “frustrated with the nearly 80 \nmillion  Americans  who  are  still  not  vaccinated,”  referred  to \n“overcrowd[ed] . . . hospitals” and  “overrun[]  .  .  .  emergency  rooms,”  and  blamed \n“elected officials actively working to undermine the fight against COVID-19.”  See \nBiden Remarks.  The FAR Council Guidance likewise admits that the goal of this \neffort is “getting more people vaccinated and decreas[ing] the spread of COVID-19.”  \nFAR Council Guidance at 3.  The vaccine mandate was never about procurement \nefficiency—it is about public health, which falls outside the scope of the FPASA.    \nD.  The Administration’s mandate runs afoul of the Constitution. \n  “[E]ven in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.”  \nRoman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 68 (2020).  Yet, in addition \nto being procedurally and substantively unlawful, the federal contractor mandate \nalso violates three key constitutional limitations on federal government power.  First, \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 20 of 35 - Page ID#: 253\n \na federal contractor vaccine mandate upends time-honored principles of federalism \nand  separation  of  powers.    Second,  binding  federal  contractors  to  ever-shifting \nguidance violates traditional limitations on the federal government’s spending power.  \nThird, any interpretation of the FPASA that enables the President to set national \nvaccine policy violates the nondelegation doctrine. \n1.  The federal contractor vaccine mandate violates the federalist system \nenshrined in our Constitution.  \n \n  The  Administration’s  shifting  mandate  intrudes  on  an  area  traditionally \nreserved to the States.  The Tenth Amendment provides that powers not expressly \ndelegated to the federal government are reserved to the States or the people.  U.S. \nConst. amend. X.  Unlike the state governments, the federal government “must show \nthat a constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions.”  Nat’l. Fed. of Ind. \nBus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 535 (2012).  By contrast, the States maintain the \n“general power of governing,” referred to as the “police power.”  Id. at 536.   \n  Although  “[t]he  regulation  of  health  and  safety  matters  is  primarily  and \nhistorically, a matter of local concern,” the contractor mandate attempts to claim this \nas a federal power, and in so doing, overturns the balance of power promised in the \nTenth Amendment.  Hillsborough County, Fla. v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc., 471 \nU.S. 707, 719 (1985).   \n  The federal  government  has no general police  power,  and  nothing  in the \nConstitution gives the federal government the power it seeks to exercise here.  It has \nno innate authority to impose wide-reaching public health measures, which are \ninstead powers reserved to the States.  But instead of respecting the time-honored \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 21 of 35 - Page ID#: 254\n \nprinciples of federalism, the federal government is trying to trample this traditional \nstate power.  Federal procurement laws do not trump the sovereign States’ police \npower.   \n2.  The mandate exceeds Congress’s spending power.   \n  When exercising its spending authority, the federal government is limited in \nseveral key ways.  As relevant here, the government must “state all conditions on the \nreceipt of federal funds ‘unambiguously’ so as to ‘enabl[e] the states to exercise their \nchoice knowingly.’”  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 423 F.3d 579, 585 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting \nSouth Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987)).   \n  The mandate provides no clarity at all.  The executive order contemplates that \nthe Task Force may continually issue guidance, approved by OMB, that agencies \nmust require contractors to comply with.  86 Fed. Reg. at 50,985–87.  Indeed, the \ndeviation clause that agencies have already begun to incorporate into their contracts \nrequires contractors (and therefore subcontractors) to “comply with all guidance, \nincluding  guidance  conveyed  through  Frequently  Asked  Questions,  as  amended \nduring the performance of this contract.”  FAR Council Guidance at 5; see also Stevens \nDecl. 2–18.  As the guidance on the website changes frequently, see Safer Federal \nWorkforce:  What’s New?, available at https://perma.cc/MB3M-397A (last visited Nov. \n4, 2021), the agencies have already failed to provide the clarity required in imposing \nfederal spending conditions.8  The federal government is trying to force states to \n                                            \n8 Moreover, to the extent the government seeks to require compliance with “updates” \nto the Task Force guidance that the OMB Director has not approved, this raises \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 22 of 35 - Page ID#: 255\n \nimplement ever-changing public health measures, a clear violation of its spending \npower.    \n3.  Construing federal procurement law to authorize vaccine mandates \nviolates the nondelegation doctrine. \n \n  The nondelegation doctrine prevents Congress from delegating major policy \nquestions to the executive without a clear and intelligible principle.  Gundy v. United \nStates, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019).  The Constitution states, “All legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist \nof a Senate and House of Representatives.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 1.  To that end, “major \nnational  policy  decisions  must  be  made  by  Congress  and  the  President  in  the \nlegislative process, not delegated by Congress to the Executive Branch.”  Paul v. \nUnited States, 140 S. Ct. 342, (2019) (Mem.) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari) (citing Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. \n607,  685–686  (1980) (Rehnquist,  J.,  concurring  in judgment)).    Thus,  “Congress \ncannot delegate legislative power to the President to exercise an unfettered discretion \nto make whatever laws he thinks may be needed or advisable.”  A.L.A. Schechter \nPoultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537–38 (1935).   \n  The  Biden  Administration’s  purported  statutory  basis  for  its  vaccine \nmandate—FPASA—lacks any intelligible principle if interpreted so loosely as to bless \nthe Administration’s practices here.  Congress enacted the FPASA to provide the \n                                            \nadditional issues, including the Task Force’s absence of authority, the fact that \ndelegations under 3 U.S.C. § 301 must be made to officials appointed by the President \nand confirmed by the Senate, and the fact that the Task Force includes officials not \nappointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 23 of 35 - Page ID#: 256\n \nfederal government with an “economical and efficient” procurement system.  40 \nU.S.C.  §  101.    Congress  authorized  a  subpart  of  the  OMB  to  “issue  policy \ndirectives . . . for the purpose of promoting the development and implementation of \n[a]  uniform  procurement  system.”    See  Office  of  Federal  Procurement  Policy \nAmendment of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-83, § 4(e), 93 Stat. 650.  Each time Congress \nissued procurement instructions, its focus was on efficient purchasing, not mandating \nhealthcare decisions.   \nThe policy decision at issue here, whether to coerce millions of American \nworkers to receive a vaccine, has no basis in the text of the FPASA.  Instead, it is a \nmajor policy decision which must be made by Congress (assuming Congress has the \nauthority in the first place).  If the FPASA is so broad as to provide the Biden \nAdministration  with  statutory  authority  to  regulate  public  health,  it  lacks  any \nintelligible principle and violates the nondelegation doctrine.    \nII.  The Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed absent an injunction.  \nAbsent  an  injunction,  Defendants  will  continue  to  intrude  on  the  States’ \nsovereign authority, violate the United States Constitution, violate federal statutory \nlaw, and cause unrecoverable damages to the Plaintiffs.  All of these injuries are \nirreparable.  \nFirst, absent an injunction, the Defendants, acting in concert to impose the \nmandate, will irreparably harm the Plaintiff States by intruding on their sovereign \nauthority to enact and enforce laws and policies that conflict with the mandate.  As \nPresident Biden made clear in his announcement, his goal is to override any State \n23 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 24 of 35 - Page ID#: 257\n \npolicies that conflict with the Administration’s priorities, declaring that, if faced with \nStates who disagree, “I’ll use my power as President to get them out of the way.”  See \nBiden Remarks, supra.  A State “suffers a form of irreparable injury” any time it is \nprevented  from  “effectuating”  laws  “enacted  by  representatives  of  its  people.”  \nThompson v. DeWine, 976 F.3d 610, 619 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers)); see also Abbott v. Perez, 138 \nS. Ct. 2305, 2324 & n.17 (2018) (same).  \nHere, the mandate intrudes upon the Plaintiff States’ sovereign authority to \nenact and enforce their own statutes, executive orders, and policies in response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic to protect vast swaths of their citizenry that will now be forced \nto undergo vaccination or lose their jobs under the mandate.  Each State has enacted \nits own laws and policies—or declined to issue certain mandates—in a way that \nbalances the need for public health, the rights of its citizens, and the health of its \neconomy—which is itself an important tool to increasing public health.  See Niknejad \nDecl.  ¶¶  10–11.    Obviously,  these  issues  are  often  politically  sensitive  and \ncontroversial, yet the Defendants, led by the President, have attempted to remove \nthem from consideration by locally accountable political officials. \nSecond,  all  Plaintiffs  suffer  irreparable  harm  from  the  violation  of  the \nconstitutional structure.  “When constitutional rights are threatened or impaired, \nirreparable injury is presumed.”  Doe v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 872 F.3d 393, 407 (6th \nCir. 2017) (quoting Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012)); \nACLU  v.  McCreary  Cnty.,  354  F.3d  438,  445  (6th  Cir.  2003).    A  constitutional \n24 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 25 of 35 - Page ID#: 258\n \nviolation, “for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable \ninjury.”  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976).  In addition to exceeding the federal \ngovernment’s enumerated  power,  the  vaccine mandate violates the  principles of \nfederalism enshrined in the Tenth Amendment and separation of powers required by \nthe nondelegation doctrine and limits to the Spending Clause.  These constitutional \nviolations constitute irreparable harm. \nThird,  the  mandate  irreparably  denies  Plaintiffs  their  statutory  rights  of \nnotice and comment under 41 U.S.C § 1707 and the APA, given the way in which \nDefendants are trying to impose it.  The Plaintiff States not only have standing to \nchallenge these unlawful actions as employers but also on behalf of their citizens in \ntheir parens patriae capacity.  See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520, n. 17 \n(2007) (noting that states have parens patriae standing to assert federal rights on \nbehalf  of  their  citizens).    The  FAR  Council  Guidance  demands  that  all  federal \nagencies  employ  a  FAR  Deviation  Clause  into  new  federal  contracts  and  bid \nsolicitations that bind the contractor to comply with a vaccine mandate and other \nrequirements set forth in the Task Force Guidance.  See FAR Council Guidance at 1–\n5; Stevens Decl. 2–18.  All this is to be done before the FAR Council, the only agency \nwith statutory authority to issue government-wide procurement regulations, does so \nproperly.  See 41 U.S.C. § 1303(a).  The OMB Determination purporting to approve \nthe Task Force Guidance as a procurement policy has not been subject to public input \nthrough the notice and comment.  Before the FAR Council can even issue a regulation \ncommanded  by  the  Executive  Order,  Plaintiffs  and  other  employers  within  the \n25 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 26 of 35 - Page ID#: 259\n \nPlaintiff States face the decision to fire vaccine hesitant employees or lose federal \ncontract opportunities.  See Niknejad Decl. ¶¶ 4–12; Maddox Decl. ¶¶ 5–11.  The \ndamage will already be done at that point.  It is irrelevant what the final FAR Council \nregulation may be, or whether the Court concludes on the merits that the FAR \nCouncil and President never had authority to issue a vaccine mandate under federal \nprocurement statutes in the first place.  \nFourth, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable economic harm caused by loss of \ncontracts with the federal government.  See Alfred v. Snapp & Sons, Inc. v. Puerto \nRico, 458 U.S. 592, 601-02 (1982) (finding that a state has standing to protect its \nproprietary interests in court). Plaintiff States also face lost business income tax \nrevenue as some employers may not have a sufficiently vaccinated workforce to bid \non  federal  contracts  and  bring  business  into  their  states.  Though  these  harms \nnormally do not constitute irreparable harm when the amount lost “may be recovered \nthrough monetary damages,” where the loss of funds cannot be recovered or have \nimpaired a plaintiff’s programs, such harm constitutes irreparable injury.  League of \nWomen Voters of the United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2016); see also \nMrs. Fields Franchising, LLC v. MFGPC, 941 F.3d 1221, 1235 (10th Cir. 2019) \n(finding  “diminishment  of  competitive  positions  in  marketplace”  and  “loss  of \nemployees’ unique services” as factors supporting irreparable harm).   \nHere, because of the federal government’s sovereign immunity, Plaintiffs likely \ncannot recover damages for lost contract opportunities resulting from the mandate, \neven if the court finds that it acted unlawfully.  Cf. 5 U.S.C. § 702 (allowing “relief \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 27 of 35 - Page ID#: 260\n \nother than money damages”); 28 U.S.C. § 2680 (excluding monetary claims “based \nupon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in \nthe execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be \nvalid”).  These  damages,  irrecoverable  due  to  sovereign  immunity,  constitute \nirreparable harm.  See Kentucky v. United States, 759 F.3d 588, 599–600 (6th Cir. \n2014)  (finding  irreparable  harm  where  “sovereign  immunity  bars”  granting \ndamages).    Plaintiffs’  irrecoverable  economic  harm  constitutes  yet  another \nirreparable injury they will suffer if this Court does not enjoin the Defendants.   \nIII.  Enjoining the mandate will promote the public interest.  \n \n“Forcing federal agencies to comply with the law is undoubtedly in the public \ninterest.”  Cent. United Life, Inc. v. Burwell, 128 F. Supp 3d 321, 330 (D.D.C. 2015).  \nThe public has an interest in a proper functioning of the federal government within \nour constitutional Republic.  The Biden Administration has flouted its constitutional \nduty to faithfully execute the law.  This is not the first time, straining public trust in \nour  system  of  government.  For  example,  President  Biden  admitted  an  expiring \n“eviction moratorium” issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was \nunlawful, but re-issued it anyway.  See Kaylee McGhee White, Biden admits he is \nproudly and deliberately breaking the law, Washington Examiner (Aug. 8, 2021) \navailable  at  https://perma.cc/THJ3-824E.    Such  actions,  without  an  injunction, \nseverely undermine our democracy.  \nThe public has a right to a lawful government and this Court has the power \nand  duty  to  preserve  the  rule  of  law  and  the  public  trust,  especially  where \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 28 of 35 - Page ID#: 261\n \nconstitutional principles are at stake.  See G & V Lounge, Inc. v. Mich. Liquor Control \nComm’n, 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994) (“[I]t is always in the public interest to \nprevent the violation of a party’s constitutional rights.” (citing Gannett Co., Inc. v. \nDePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 382 (1979))).   \nAn  injunction  additionally  promotes  the  public  interest  by  protecting  the \nauthority of States to respond to COVID-19 pandemic conditions particular to their \nown  jurisdictions,  and  by  preventing  the  nationwide  confusion  and  economic \nupheaval that the mandate threatens.    \nUnless in conflict with individual citizens’ constitutional rights, each State has \nthe authority to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as its elected officials deem \nproper.  It is “in the public interest” that courts “give effect to the will of the people \nby enforcing the laws they and their representatives enact.”  Thompson, 976 F.3d at \n619.  This interest is “particularly” strong when “considerable disagreement exists \nabout how best to accomplish” a challenge confronting the nation.  United States v. \nLopez, 514 U.S. 549, 581 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  “In this circumstance, the \ntheory and utility of our federalism are revealed, for the States may perform their \nrole as laboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions.”  Id.; see New \nState Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). \nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Plaintiff States have fulfilled \ntheir function as laboratories of democracy.  Each State has responded to the ebbs \nand flows of the pandemic.  What was necessary at times in one State might not have \nbeen necessary, or may have become unnecessary, in others.  And each State has \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 29 of 35 - Page ID#: 262\n \nencouraged its eligible citizens to get vaccinated.  Tens of millions have done so \nvoluntarily.  But the vaccine mandate at issue here, along with federal vaccine \nmandates issued by other agencies, threatens to scrap this federalist solution to the \npandemic’s challenges by turning the entire country into one “single laboratory of \nexperimentation.”  Jeffrey S. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions: States & the Making of \nAmerican Constitutional Law 216 (2018).  Only an injunction of the one-size-fits-all \nmandate will restore the constitutionally-guaranteed flexibility of Plaintiff States to \nrespond to the pandemic. \nAn  individualized  approach,  by  state,  is  in  the  public  interest.    Vaccine \nmandates in other States have already exacerbated worker shortages.  See, e.g., \nMaria Caspani & Nathan Layne, New York Hospitals Fire, Suspend Staff Who Refuse \nCOVID Vaccine, Reuters (Sept. 28, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/8DXR-ZVWT \n(“[S]taff shortages prompted some hospitals to postpone elective surgeries or curtail \nservices.”). Employers are already facing enormous challenges as they respond to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic while continuing to provide employment, goods, and services to \nour local and national economy.  And many employees’ finances are already stretched \nthin from lost wages during COVID-19 shutdowns.  Now, the federal government has \nthreatened them with the loss of their livelihoods if they do not comply with this \nvaccine mandate or others issued by the Biden Administration.  An injunction will \npreserve the status quo for employers and employees. Absent an injunction, the \nnation faces a severe economic slowdown with ramifications from coast to coast.  \nDefendants, meanwhile, will suffer no harm if this Court grants an injunction.  \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 30 of 35 - Page ID#: 263\n \nBecause the mandate is procedurally and substantively unlawful, Respondents have \nno valid interest in enforcing it.  Deja Vu of Nashville, Inc. v. Metro. Gov’t, 274 F.3d \n377, 400 (6th Cir. 2001) (“[I]f the plaintiff shows a substantial likelihood that the \nchallenged law is unconstitutional, no substantial harm to others can be said to \ninhere in its enjoinment[.]”); see also League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 12 (“There \nis generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”).  And \nthe Delta variant—President Biden’s stated rationale almost two month ago for \nordering this mandate and others—has already receded from many States.

No bond is required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.   \nA bond is required under Fed. R. Civ.

See Static \nControls Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Intern., Inc., 697 F.3d 387, 400-01 (6th Cir. \n2012) (noting that a court has broad discretion in setting the bond amount, and may \ndecline to order a bond at all). \n \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 12   Filed: 11/08/21   Page: 31 of 35 - Page ID#: 264\n \nCONCLUSION \n  For the aforementioned reasons, the Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court \nenjoin the Defendants’ federal contractor vaccine mandate.     \nRespectfully Submitted,  \nDaniel Cameron \nATTORNEY GENERAL \n \n/s/ Christopher L.

The vaccine mandate, as articulated in a newly created task \nforce’s guidance document, seeks to require covered contractor employees to be fully \nvaccinated by December 8, with very minimal exceptions.  Even in a pandemic, “our \nsystem does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in the pursuit of desirable \nends.”  Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, \n2490  (2021)  (per  curiam).   The Plaintiffs therefore  seek judicial  relief from  the \nPresident’s unlawful and unconstitutional vaccine mandate.  \n                                            \n1 Joseph Biden, Remarks at the White House (Sept. 9, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/GQG5-\nYBXK (last visited Nov. 2, 2021). \n1 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 5 of 50 - Page ID#: 5\nPARTIES \nKentucky Plaintiffs \n1.  The Commonwealth of Kentucky is a sovereign State of the United \nStates  of  America.    The  Commonwealth  sues  to  vindicate  its  sovereign,  quasi-\nsovereign, proprietary, and parens patriae interests.   \n2.  The Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is authorized \nto bring legal actions on behalf of the Commonwealth and its citizens.  The Attorney \nGeneral is “charged with the duty of protecting the interests of all the people,” \nHancock v. Terry Elkhorn Mining Co., 503 S.W.2d 710, 715 (Ky. 1973), including by \nensuring that government actors perform their duties lawfully, Commonwealth ex rel. \nBeshear v. Bevin, 498 S.W.3d 355, 362 (Ky. 2016).    \n3.  The Commonwealth, through its agencies and its political subdivisions, \nroutinely contracts with the federal government.   \n4.  For example, the Boone County Jail, Laurel County Jail, and Grayson \nCounty Jail all have contracts with United States Justice Department, U.S. Marshals \nService to detain, house, and transport prisoners in custody for federal crimes.   \n5.  The revenue from these contracts accounts for a significant portion of \nthese jails’ operating budgets, alleviating the burden on Kentucky taxpayers to fund \nthese facilities that are essential for ensuring public safety.   \n6.  Each of these jails encourages vaccination for staff but does not require \nvaccination as a condition of employment.  \n2 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 6 of 50 - Page ID#: 6\n7.  Multiple staff members at these jails have indicated they will end their \nemployment if forced to take a COVID-19 vaccine, which will only exacerbate the \ncurrent staffing challenges at these institutions and threaten public safety.  \n8.  The Commonwealth expects to continue pursuing federal government \ncontracts in the future.  \n9.  Upon information and belief, the Commonwealth has current contracts \nsubject to renewal or the exercise of options on or after October 15, 2021.  \n10.  Public employees are generally not required to be vaccinated under the \nlaws of the Commonwealth.  \n11.  The mandate threatens the Commonwealth with the loss of millions of \ndollars  in  future  contracting  opportunities  and  will  put  undue  pressure  on  the \nCommonwealth to create new policies, which threatens irreparable harm.  \nOhio Plaintiffs \n12.  The State of Ohio is a sovereign State of the United States of America.  \nOhio sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, proprietary, and parens patriae \ninterests.   \n13.  The Attorney General of the State of Ohio is authorized to bring legal \nactions  on  behalf  of  the  State  and  its  citizens,  and  has  been  appointed  by  the \nprosecutors of Geauga and Seneca Counties to bring legal action on behalf of both \ncounties’ sheriffs.  \n14.  On information and belief, arms of the State of Ohio routinely contract \nwith the federal government.   \n3 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 7 of 50 - Page ID#: 7\n15.  For example, state universities engage in contracts and subcontracts \nthat  exceed  the  simplified  acquisition  threshold  with  multiple  federal  agencies, \nincluding the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission.   \n16.  In addition, executive bodies of the State of Ohio have contracts with \nfederal agencies that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, including the Ohio \nDepartment of Health, which contracts with the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. \n17.  The State of Ohio expects to continue pursuing government contracts in \nthe future. \n18.  On  information and belief, the  State  of Ohio  has current  contracts \nsubject to renewal or the exercise of options on or after October 15, 2021. \n19.  On  information  and  belief,  federal  agencies  with  contracts  or \nsubcontracts with arms of the State of Ohio have already updated certain contracts \nto incorporate the mandate.  Arms of the State have therefore been notified that they \nwill need to either require their employees to vaccinate or else forfeit their ability to \ncontract with the federal government. \n20.  State employees are not generally required to be vaccinated.  Certain \nstate  universities require  employees  to  show  proof of vaccination,  but allow  for \nbroader exemptions than the mandate.   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 8 of 50 - Page ID#: 8\n21.  The mandate threatens Ohio with the loss of millions of dollars in future \ncontracting opportunities and will put undue pressure on Ohio to create new policies, \nwhich threatens imminent irreparable harm.    \n22.  Seneca County Sheriff Fredrick W. Stevens is an elected official in \nSeneca County, Ohio, responsible for the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office.  He sues in \nhis official capacity. \n23.  Geauga County Sheriff Scott A. Hildenbrand is an elected official in \nGeauga County, Ohio, responsible for the Geauga County Sheriff’s Office.  He sues in \nhis official capacity. \n24.  The Ohio Revised Code provides that each county shall have an elected \nsheriff.  Ohio Rev. Code § 311.01. \n25.  Sheriffs are authorized to appoint deputy sheriffs, Ohio Rev. Code § \n311.04, and to hire non-deputy civilian employees to perform other functions, such as \nrunning county jails, Ohio Rev. Code § 341.05. \n26.  Sheriffs perform many functions of significant importance to the State.   \n27.  For example, sheriffs are required to protect courthouses by providing \npersonnel during all open court proceedings, Ohio Rev. Code § 311.07, and also to \ntransport jailed defendants to court and back to jail during proceedings, e.g., Ohio \nRev.  Code  §  2945.371.    If  they  cannot  adequately  provide  these  services,  the \nadministration of justice in Ohio will be hampered. \n28.  Sheriffs process registrations under multiple civil registration schemes \nthat record information of, and sometimes provide community notification regarding, \n5 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 9 of 50 - Page ID#: 9\nthose who pose danger to the community.  These include sex-offender registration \nand notification, Ohio Rev. Code § 2950.04(D), violent-offender registration, Ohio \nRev. Code § 2903.43(A) and arsonist registration, Ohio Rev. Code § 2909.15(A).  The \nsheriff must then forward that information to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation \nand Identification (“BCI”), an office under the Attorney General, for inclusion in a \nstatewide database, with different registries for different offenders.   Ohio Rev. Code \n§ 2950.043 (sex offenders), Ohio Rev. Code § 2903.43(F) (violent offenders); Ohio Rev. \nCode  §  2909.15(E)(1)  (arsonists).    If  the  sheriffs  cannot  adequately  maintain \nregistrations and supply information to BCI, the State will be unable to maintain an \nupdated database as required by law, harming public safety. \n29.  Sheriffs operate county jails, where they hold pretrial detainees and \nconvicted offenders serving certain sentences, such as misdemeanors.  Sheriffs are \nauthorized to hold state prisoners for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and \nCorrection, and federal prisoners or detainees for federal authorities. Ohio Rev. Code \n§§ 341.21; 5120.161.  If sheriffs experience a diminution in their ability to carry out \nthese functions, the administration of justice in Ohio will suffer. \n30.  Sheriffs  process  Ohio  citizens’  applications  for  concealed-handgun \nlicenses,  including  processing  background  checks,  and  must  forward  relevant \ninformation to state entities.  Ohio Rev. Code §§ 311.41; 2923.125.  \n31.  Sheriffs operate county-level public-safety communications systems in \nmost Ohio counties, which are then used for multi-jurisdictional communications \nwith state agencies and other local subdivisions.  Ohio Rev. Code § 307.63. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 10 of 50 - Page ID#: 10\n32.  Sheriffs  deliver  absentee  ballots,  or  facilitate  delivery  by  elections \nofficials, to jailed voters, enabling them to vote while in a sheriff’s custody.  Without \nadequate sheriffs’ office staffing, jailed voters might be unable to vote.  In addition to \nharming would-be voters, that could expose the State to litigation and its attendant \ncosts.  See, e.g., Mays v. LaRose, 951 F.3d 775, 781 (6th Cir. 2020). \n33.  The  Seneca  County  Sheriff  and  Geauga  County  Sheriff  have  both \ncontracted  with  the  federal  government—in  particular,  with  the  Department  of \nHomeland Security—to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees in \ntheir county jails. \n34.  On information and belief, the Department of Homeland Security has \namended  its  contract  with  the  Seneca  County  Sheriff  to  add  a  clause  entitled \n“Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors.”  That \nclause reads, in full: \nEnsuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors. \n(OCT 2021) (DEVIATION) \n \n(a) Definition. As used in this clause – \nUnited States or its outlying areas means— \n(1) The fifty States; \n(2) The District of Columbia; \n(3) The commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands; \n(4) The territories  of American Samoa, Guam, and  the  United  States \nVirgin Islands; and \n(5) The minor outlying islands of Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis \nIsland, Johnston, Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands, Navassa Island, \nPalmyra Atoll, and Wake Atoll. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 11 of 50 - Page ID#: 11\n(b) Authority. This clause implements Executive Order 14042, Ensuring Adequate \nCOVID  Safety  Protocols  for  Federal  Contractors,  dated  September  9,  2021 \n(published in the Federal Register on September 14, 2021, 86 FR 50985). \n \n(c) Compliance. The Contractor shall comply with all guidance, including guidance \nconveyed  through  Frequently  Asked  Questions,  as  amended  during  the \nperformance of this contract, for contractor workplace locations published by the \nSafer  Federal  Workforce  Task  Force  (Task  Force  Guidance)  at \nhttps://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/. \n \n(d)  Subcontracts.  The  Contractor  shall  include  the  substance  of  this  clause, \nincluding this paragraph (d), in subcontracts at any tier that exceed the simplified \nacquisition threshold, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation 2.101 on the \ndate of subcontract award, and are for services, including construction, performed \nin whole or in part within the United States or its outlying areas. \n \n35.  Entities subject to the mandate must either give up their contracts (or \ntheir ability to compete for future contracts) or mandate vaccination among their \nstaffs. \n36.  The Seneca County Sheriff and the Geauga County Sheriff will lose staff \nif they mandate vaccination. \n37.  The State of Ohio will be affected if sheriffs cannot perform, or cannot \nperform adequately, the many functions that sheriffs serve, including those detailed \nabove. \n38.  Sheriffs’ deputies and non-deputy employees are generally, with few \nexceptions, included in Ohio’s classified civil service.  Ohio Rev. Code § 124.01(C); \nYarosh v. Becane, 63 Ohio St. 2d 5 (1980).  That means that deputies and other \nemployees whose service is terminated may appeal that action to the State Personnel \nBoard of Review, a state agency, and to the state courts.  Ohio Rev. Code §§ 124.03; \n124.06. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 12 of 50 - Page ID#: 12\n39.  If deputies and non-deputy employees are terminated because of the \nmandate, the State will then expend both agency and judicial resources resolving \nsuch claims. \nTennessee Plaintiffs \n40.  The State of Tennessee is a sovereign State of the United States of \nAmerica.  Tennessee sues to vindicate its sovereign, quasi-sovereign, proprietary, and \nparens patriae interests. \n41.  The  Attorney  General  and  Reporter  of  the  State  of  Tennessee  is \nauthorized to bring legal actions on behalf of the State and its citizens.   \n42.  The  State  of  Tennessee,  through  its  agencies  and  its  political \nsubdivisions, routinely contracts with the federal government.   \n43.  The  State  of  Tennessee,  through  its  agencies  and  its  political \nsubdivisions, engages in a wide range of federal contracts, including but not limited \nto those that relate to staffing assistance, research, regulatory program agreements, \nleases of and access to federal real property, and agreements for data and information \nsharing. These contracts benefit millions of Tennesseans by providing vital services \nand resources.  \n44.  The  State  of  Tennessee  expects  to  continue  pursuing  government \ncontracts in the future. \n45.  The State of Tennessee has current contracts subject to renewal or the \nexercise of options after October 15, 2021. \n9 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 13 of 50 - Page ID#: 13\n46.  Public employees are generally not required to be vaccinated under the \nlaws of the State of Tennessee.  \n47.  The mandate threatens the State of Tennessee with the loss of millions \nof dollars in future contracting opportunities and will put undue pressure on the State \nof Tennessee to create new polices, which threatens irreparable harm.  \nAllegations pertaining to the States generally \n48.  The contractor vaccine mandate harms the Plaintiff States beyond the \ndirect harms that flow from the fact that certain agencies and political subdivisions \nof the States are contractors subject to the mandate, including but not limited to the \nfollowing: \na.    Because the mandate claims to preempt all contrary State law, it \ninjures  the  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and  parens  patriae \ninterests to set their own laws regarding workplace issues that would otherwise \napply to contractors within the States’ borders.  \nb.    Because the mandate claims to preempt all contrary State law, it \ninjures  the  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and  parens  patriae \ninterests to set their own laws regarding public health orders. \nc.    Because the mandate claims to preempt all contrary State law, it \ninjures  the  Plaintiff  States’  sovereign,  quasi-sovereign,  and  parens  patriae \ninterests to set their own laws regarding workforce vaccination policies under \ntheir “police power—a power which the state did not surrender when becoming a \n10 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 14 of 50 - Page ID#: 14\nmember of the Union under the Constitution.”  Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 \nU.S. 11, 24–25 (1905).   \nd.    The  mandate  requires  employees  to  prove  vaccination  status  with \ndocumentation, and on information and belief, agencies of the Plaintiff States \noften possess such documentation.  A predictable consequence of the mandate is \nthus to increase the number of people seeking documentation from the States \nregarding vaccination status.  See Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 \n(2019).   \ne.    On information and belief, a natural predictable consequence of the \nmandate is that numerous employees may be fired, retire, or quit their jobs.  An \nABC poll shows that almost 70% of unvaccinated Americans would quit their jobs \nif a vaccine mandate were required and their exemption were denied.2  From an \nemployer’s perspective, 9 in 10 large employers fear reductions in their workforces \nif they have to implement vaccine mandates.3  This injures the Plaintiff States’ \nquasi-sovereign and parens patriae interest in the economic well-being of their \ncitizens.   \nf.    On information and belief, a natural and predictable consequence of \nthe mandate is that employers who are critical to the supply chain, and are also \n                                            \n2 Jordan Burrows, Employees Not Given Exemption Prefer to Quit Job Than Get COVID Vaccine, Poll \nShows, Salt Lake City (ABC4) (Sept. 15, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/6A95-CJXD (last visited \nNov. 2, 2021). \n3 Karl Evers-Hillstrom, 9 in 10 Employers Say They Fear They'll Lose Unvaccinated Workers Over \nMandate: Survey, The Hill (Oct. 18, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/V5ZJ-7XUQ (last visited Nov. \n2, 2021); see also Society for Human Resource Management, SHRM Surveys Reveal Employers’ Anxiety \nOver Vaccine Mandate, available at https://perma.cc/R2A2-BVKF (last visited Nov. 3, 2021).  \n11 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 15 of 50 - Page ID#: 15\nfederal contractors, will likely lose significant numbers of employees.  It is entirely \npredictable, therefore, that the mandate will exacerbate current supply chain \nissues.  As a result, prices will continue to rise and cause direct injuries to the \nPlaintiff States as purchasers.  It will also harm their quasi-sovereign parens \npatriae interest in the economic well-being of their residents, who will suffer from \nfurther supply chain disruptions.4   \ng.    The mandate unfairly discriminates between citizens of the Plaintiff \nStates  who  are  vaccinated  and  those  who  are  not,  thus  denying  the  latter \nemployment opportunities available to the former.  The Plaintiff States have \nquasi-sovereign and parens patriae interests in protecting their citizens from \ndiscriminatory policies.  See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v.

Under  Local  Rules  3.2(a)(3)(A),  3.2(a)(3)(B),  and  8.1(c),  the  Central \nDivision of the Eastern District of Kentucky at Frankfort is the proper division for \nthis action because a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred \nin Franklin County, Kentucky, where Kentucky’s seat of government is located, and \nwhere Attorney General Cameron holds office.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nHistorical Background \n77.  In the aftermath of World War II, during which the federal government \namassed a substantial amount of war supplies and other property, there was an \nevident need for “an improved and efficient property management program,” H.R. \nRep. No. 81-670, at 1475, and an overhaul of the internal “housekeeping” activities of \nthe world’s largest buyer of goods and services, id. at 1476.  As one member of \nCongress explained, the federal procurement system was “largely uncoordinated, to \nsome extent duplicative,” and in desperate need of reform.  95 Cong. Rec. 7441 (daily \ned. June 8, 1949) (remarks of Rep. Holifield).  \n17 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 21 of 50 - Page ID#: 21\n78.  Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act \nof 1949 (“FPASA”) “to provide the [f]ederal [g]overnment with an economical and \nefficient  system”  for  certain  enumerated  activities,  including  “[p]rocuring  and \nsupplying property and nonpersonal services,” “establish[ing] . . . pools or systems of \ntransportation  of  [g]overnment  personnel,”  and  “manag[ing]  of  public  utility \nservices.”  40 U.S.C. § 101. \n79.  To  effectuate  the  FPASA,  Congress  authorized  the  President  to \n“prescribe policies and directives that the President considers necessary to carry out” \nthat statute.  Id. at § 121(a).  Notably, Congress did not authorize the President to \nissue regulations with the force or effect of law, as it authorized the General Services \nAdministrator to do.  Compare id. at § 121(a) (“prescribe policies and directives”), \nwith id. at § 121(c) (“prescribe regulations”). \n80.  Over time, however, the FPASA proved inadequate to control the lack of \ncoordination across agencies, and the proliferation of procurement regulations by \ndifferent agencies led to a morass of legal requirements.5  In 1979, Congress directed \nthe Office of Federal Procurement Policy—part of the Office of Management and \nBudget—to “issue policy directives . . . for the purpose of promoting the development \nand implementation of [a] uniform procurement system,” with concurrence of the \nOffice of Management and Budget’s Director. See Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy Amendments of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-83, § 4(e), 93 Stat. 650. \n                                            \n5 See generally Kate M. Manuel et al., Cong.

In 1983, under the policy directive of the Administrator of the Office of \nFederal  Procurement  Policy,  the  Department  of  Defense,  General  Services \nAdministration,  and  NASA  jointly  promulgated  the  first  version  of  the  Federal \nAcquisition Regulation.  48 Fed. Reg. 42,102 (Sept. 19, 1983). \n82.  Even after creation of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, however, \n“[r]edundancies  and  inconsistencies  continue[d]  to  exist  between  the  [Federal \nAcquisition Regulation] and agency supplementing regulations implementing the \nRegulation.” S. Rep. No. 100–424, at 13–14 (quoting study prepared by Office of \nManagement and Budget Director Tom Daley (Nov. 1986)).   \n83.  Finally, in 1988, after decades of failure by executive-branch officials, \nCongress established the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council “to assist in the \ndirection  and  coordination  of  [g]overnment-wide  procurement  policy  and \n[g]overnment-wide procurement regulatory activities in the [f]ederal [g]overnment.” \nOffice of Federal Procurement Policy Act Amendments of 1988, Pub.

The FAR Council consists of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy \nAdministrator, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of NASA, and the General \nServices Administration Administrator.  41 U.S.C. § 1302(b).  \n                                            \n6 See S. Rep. No. 100–424, at 4 (“[The Office of Federal Procurement Policy]’s performance as the \n[f]ederal [g]overment’s procurement policy leader has been uneven. . . . [M]any of the procurement \nexecutives,  industry  officials  and  other  procurement  experts . . . rated  [the  Office]’s  overall \nperformance during this as being no more than marginally [e]ffective.” (quoting Assessment of the \nOffice of Federal Procurement Policy, GAO/NSIAD–88–35 (No. 1987))).   \n19 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 23 of 50 - Page ID#: 23\n85.  Subject to limited exceptions, the FAR Council has exclusive authority \nto issue “a single [g]overnment-wide procurement regulation, to be known as the \nFederal Acquisition Regulation.”  Id. at § 1303(a)(1).  No other agency is authorized \nto issue government-wide procurement regulations.  Id. at § 1303(a)(2).   \n86.  Finally, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act further protects \nCongress’s  reforms  to  government-procurement  practices  by  requiring  that  any \n“procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form”—whether issued government-\nwide by the FAR Council or for one agency by that agency—be subject to notice and \ncomment.  41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)–(b).  More specifically, this Act requires that:  \n[A] procurement policy, regulation, procedure, or form (including an \namendment or modification thereto) may not take effect until 60 days \nafter it is published for public comment in the Federal Register . . . if \nit—(A) relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds; and (B)(i) has a \nsignificant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of the agency \nissuing the policy, regulation, procedure, or form; or (ii) has a significant \ncost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors.   \n \nId. at § 1707(a).  The relevant official may waive that requirement only if “urgent and \ncompelling circumstances make compliance with the requirements impracticable.”  \nId. at § 1707(d). \nRelevant Federal Government Actions \n  Creation of the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force \n87.  On his first day in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 13991, \nwhich created the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force to provide “ongoing guidance \nto heads of agencies on the operation of the Federal Government, the safety of its \nemployees,  and  the  continuity  of  Government  functions  during  the  COVID-19 \n20 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 24 of 50 - Page ID#: 24\npandemic.”  86 Fed. Reg. 7,045, 7,046 (Jan. 20, 2021).  The Executive Order also \nrequires  that  the  General  Services  Administration  “provide  funding  and \nadministrative support for the” Task Force.  Id.  Three co-chairs oversee the Task \nForce: (1) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, Defendant Ahuja; (2) \nthe Administrator of the General Services Administration, Defendant Carnahan; and \n(3) the COVID-19 Response Coordinator, Defendant Zients.

President Biden further declared that he would “sign an executive order \nthat will now require all executive branch federal employees to be vaccinated” and \n“another executive order that will require federal contractors to do the same.”  Id. \n90.  On that same day, President Biden signed Executive Order 14042.  86 \nFed. Reg. 50,985 (Sept. 9, 2021). \n91.  The Executive Order relies on the FPASA, as well as the Constitution \nand the President’s power under 3 U.S.C. § 301 to delegate his statutory authorities.  \nId. at 50,985.  \n92.  The  Executive  Order  requires  departments  and  agencies,  including \nindependent establishments, to require contractors and subcontractors to “comply \n21 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 25 of 50 - Page ID#: 25\nwith all guidance for contractor or subcontractor workplace locations published by \nthe Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, provided that the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget approves the Task Force Guidance and determines that the \nGuidance . . . will promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting.”  Id.  \n93.  The Executive Order required the Task Force to issue this guidance by \nSeptember 24, 2021, and directs the OMB Director, pursuant to the President’s \ndelegation of his power under the FPASA, to determine whether the Task Force \nguidance will promote economy and efficiency in federal procurement.  Id. at 50,985–\n86.   \n94.  The  Executive  Order  applies  to  new  contracts,  contract-like \ninstruments,  new  solicitations  for  contracts  or  contract-like  instruments,  and \nextensions or renewals of contracts or contract-like instruments if the extension or \nrenewal occurred on or after October 15, 2021.  Id. at 50,987.  The Executive Order \nexempts certain contracts such as those with a value below “the simplified acquisition \nthreshold,” which is typically $250,000.  Id. at 50,986–87; FAR § 2.101. \n95.  The Executive Order also authorized the Task Force to update guidance \non a continuing basis, subject to re-approval by the OMB Director.7  86 Fed.

The Task Force \nGuidance defines and delineates the contractor vaccine mandate at issue in this case. \n97.  More specifically, the Task Force Guidance requires federal contractors \nand  subcontractors  to  mandate  “COVID-19  vaccination  of  covered  contractor \nemployees, except in limited circumstances where an employee is legally entitled to \nan accommodation.”  Id. at 5.  “[C]overed contractor employees” are to be “fully \nvaccinated” by December 8, 2021—meaning said employees must obtain the final \ndose of their vaccine of choice no later than November 24, 2021, as “[p]eople are \nconsidered fully vaccinated for COVID-19 two weeks after they have received the \nsecond dose in a two-dose series, or two weeks after they have received a single-dose \nvaccine.”  Id. at 4. \n98.  In a lengthy Q&A portion, which continues to add more questions and \nanswers, the guidance makes clear that prior COVID-19 infection, even with an \nantibody test, does not satisfy the vaccination requirement.

The Task Force Guidance was not published in the Federal Register for \npublic comment, did not incorporate a required 60-day comment period, and did not \ninclude a waiver from an authorized officer indicating that “urgent and compelling \ncircumstances ma[d]e compliance with” notice and comment and the effective period \nimpracticable,  see  41  U.S.C.  §  1707(d),  or  otherwise  exempt  from  notice-and-\ncomment, see 5 U.S.C. § 553(b).   \nThe Office of Management and Budget Determination on September \n28, 2021 \n \n101.  On September 28, 2021, the Acting Director of the Office of Management \nand  Budget  published  an  economy  and  efficiency  determination  in  the  Federal \nRegister,  stating  without  reasoning  or  explanation:  “I  have  determined  that \ncompliance by Federal contractors and subcontractors with the COVID-19 workplace \nsafety protocols detailed in that guidance will improve economy and efficiency by \nreducing absenteeism and decreasing labor costs for contractors and subcontractors \nworking  on  or  in  connection  with  a  Federal  Government  contract.”    OMB \nDetermination, 86 Fed.

See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B).   \nThe FAR Council’s September 30 Memorandum and Deviation Clause \n \n104.  On September 30, 2021, the FAR Council—purportedly pursuant to \nsection 3(a) of Executive Order 14042—issued “guidance” to government officials with \nresponsibility for government contracting (the “FAR Council Guidance”) to assist \nagencies in mandating contractor and subcontractor compliance with the Task Force \nGuidance,  prior  to  amendment  of  the  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR).8  \nMemorandum from FAR Council to Chief Acquisition Officers et al. re: Issuance of \nAgency Deviations to Implement Executive Order 14042, available at (Sept. 30, \n2021), https://perma.cc/9BQ8-XBT6 (last visited Nov. 2, 2021).   \n105.  The FAR Council Guidance provides that “[a]gencies are encouraged to \nmake their deviations effective until the FAR is amended or the deviation is otherwise \nrescinded by the agency.”  Id. at 3.  \n106.  The “deviation clause” attached to the FAR Council Guidance provides \ntext federal contractors should use to mandate compliance with the Task Force \nGuidance:  \n(c)  Compliance.  The  Contractor  shall  comply  with  all  guidance, \nincluding guidance conveyed through Frequently Asked Questions, as \namended  during  the  performance  of  this  contract,  for  contractor  or \nsubcontractor  workplace  locations  published  by  the  Safer  Federal \n                                            \n8 A deviation clause is a clause that is inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  48 C.F.R. \n§ 1.401.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation prescribes procedures for both individual deviations and \nclass deviations.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this \nclause, including this paragraph (d), in subcontracts at any tier that \nexceed  the  simplified  acquisition  threshold,  as  defined  in  Federal \nAcquisition Regulation 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, and are \nfor services, including construction, performed in whole or in part within \nthe United States or its outlying areas.  \nId. at 5.  \n107.  A deviation clause is a clause that is inconsistent with the FAR.  FAR \n1.401.   The FAR prescribes procedures for both individual deviations and class \ndeviations.  Id. at 1.403–04.   \n108.  The FAR Council did not publish its guidance in the Federal Register \nfor the purpose of receiving public comment. \n109.  Deviations are not an appropriate manner to implement a government-\nwide procurement policy such as the purported “procurement” policy at issue here.  \nInstead,  “[w]hen  an  agency  knows  that  it  will  require  a  class  deviation  on  a \npermanent basis, it should propose a [Federal Acquisition Regulation] revision.”  FAR \n1.404.   \n110.  The  deviation  clause  attached  to  the  FAR  Council  Guidance  cites \nExecutive Order 14042 as its sole authority and contains little substantive content \nother than requiring contractors and subcontractors to comply with the Task Force \nGuidance published on the Task Force’s website, even if that guidance is amended \nduring performance of the contract.  FAR Council Guidance, 4–5.   \n26 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 30 of 50 - Page ID#: 30\n111.  The FAR Council Guidance “reminds” agencies that, under Executive \nOrder 14042, they are “required to include an implementing clause” in new contracts \nawarded on or after November 14, 2021, new solicitations issued on or after October \n15, 2021, and options on existing contracts exercised on or after October 15, 2021.  Id. \nat 2.   \n112.  Executive Order 14042 requires the FAR Council to amend the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation to require all contracts subject to Executive Order 14042 \ninclude whatever guidance is or may later be imposed by the Task Force and approved \nby OMB.  The FAR Council “has opened a case (FAR Case 2021-021, Ensuring \nAdequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors) to make appropriate \namendments in the FAR to reflect the requirements of the order.”  FAR Council \nGuidance at 3.   \nScope of Mandates \n113.  The  United  States  Department  of  Labor  recognizes  that  “workers \nemployed by federal contractors” comprise “approximately one-fifth of the entire U.S. \nlabor force.”  DOL, History of Executive Order 11246, Office of Contract Compliance \nPrograms,  available  at  https://perma.cc/6ZXJ-WGR8  (last  visited  Nov.  2,  2021) \n(emphasis added).  This includes similarly large proportions of the labor force in each \nof the States.   \n114.  The Task Force Guidance’s definitions section highlights the contractor \nvaccine mandate’s broad scope. \n27 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 31 of 50 - Page ID#: 31\n115.  “[C]overed contractor employee” refers to “any full-time or part-time \nemployee of a covered contractor working on or in connection with a covered contract \nor working at a covered contractor workplace.  This includes employees of covered \ncontractors  who  are  not  themselves  working  on  or  in  connection  with  a  covered \ncontract.”  Task Force Guidance, 3–4 (emphasis added).   \n116.  “[I]n  connection  with”  includes  “[e]mployees  who  perform  duties \nnecessary  to  the  performance  of  the  covered  contract,  but  who  are  not  directly \nengaged in performing the specific work called for by the covered contract, such as \nhuman resources, billing, and legal review.”  Id. at 13 (emphasis added). \n117.  A  contractor  or  subcontractor  workplace  location  “means  a  location \nwhere covered contract employees work, including a covered contractor workplace or \nFederal workplace.”  Id. at 3. \n118.  “Covered  contractor  workplace”  “means  a  location  controlled  by  a \ncovered contractor at which any employee of a covered contractor working on or in \nconnection  with  a  covered  contract  is  likely  to  be  present  during  the  period  of \nperformance for a covered contract.  A covered contractor workplace does not include \na covered contractor employee’s residence.”  Id. at 4 (emphasis added).   \n119.  “[L]ocations”  to  which  the  mandate  applies  includes  “contractor  or \nsubcontractor workplace locations that are outdoors.”  Id. at 10.   \n120.  Furthermore, “unless a covered contractor can affirmatively determine \nthat none of its employees on another floor or in separate areas of the building will \ncome  into  contact  with  a  covered  contractor  employee  during  the  period  of \n28 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 32 of 50 - Page ID#: 32\nperformance,” employees in other areas of the building site or facility are also a part \nof the covered contractor workplace.  Id.   \n121.  “Contact” includes “interactions” in “common areas,” such as “elevators,” \n“stairwells,” “kitchens,” and “parking garages.”  Id. at 11.   \n122.  And if an employee is working completely remotely, but working on a \ncovered  federal  contract,  the  employee  still  “must  comply  with  the  vaccination \nrequirement . . . even if the employee never works at either a covered contractor \nworkplace or Federal workplace during the performance of the contract.”  Id. at 11.   \n123.  Under  the  Task  Force  Guidance,  the  contractor  or  subcontractor  is \nresponsible for ensuring that a covered contractor employee is fully vaccinated.  The \ncontractor or subcontractor “must review its covered employees’ documentation to \nprove vaccination status.”  Id. at 5–6.  Specifically, the subcontractor or contractor \nmust require covered contractor employees to show or provide their employer with \none of several documents.  Id. \n124.  The  Task  Force  Guidance  “strongly  encourage[s]”  contractors  to \n“incorporate similar vaccination requirements into their non-covered contracts and \nagreements with non-covered contractors whose employees perform work at covered \ncontractor workplaces” but are not otherwise involved with a federal contract.  Id. at \n6.   \nNegative Effects of the Mandate \n125.  Today, citizens of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee face the prospect of \nlosing their jobs and livelihoods due to an unprecedented power grab by the Federal \n29 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 33 of 50 - Page ID#: 33\ngovernment.  It is hardly a choice to tell a single mother that she must be vaccinated \nor lose the financial resources to feed her children. \n126.  If left in place, the mandates will result in citizens of Kentucky, Ohio, \nand Tennessee turning to public benefit programs for unemployment compensation, \nfood assistance, healthcare, and basic needs. \nCOUNT I \nAgency action contrary to law and in excess of authority \n(OMB Determination) \n \n127.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n128.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court must “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action” that is “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of \nstatutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C).   \n129.  The OMB Determination approving the Task Force Guidance is contrary \nto law for at least four reasons. \n130.  First, the OMB Determination violates 41 U.S.C. § 1303(a) because it is \na government-wide procurement regulation, which only the FAR Council may issue.  \n131.  Executive  Order  14042  apparently  seeks  to  circumvent  §  1303  by \ndelegating the President’s authority under the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act to the Office of Management and Budget Director.  \n132.  But  the  President  has  no  authority  to  issue  regulations  under  the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act—only the FAR Council may issue \ngovernment-wide procurement regulations.  See Centralizing Border Control Pol’y \n30 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 34 of 50 - Page ID#: 34\nUnder the Supervision of the Att’y Gen., 26 Op. OLC 22, 23 (2002) (“Congress may \nprescribe that a particular executive function may be performed only by a designated \nofficial within the Executive Branch, and not by the President.”). \n133.  Second,  and  relatedly,  the  OMB  Determination  is  contrary  to  law \nbecause the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act does not grant the \nPresident  the  power  to  issue  orders  with  the  force  or  effect  of  law.    Congress \nauthorized the President only to “prescribe policies and directives that the President \nconsiders necessary to carry out” 40 U.S.C. § 121(a).  \n134.  “Policies and directives” describe the President’s power to direct the \nexercise of procurement authority throughout the government.  It does not authorize \nthe President to issue regulations himself.  \n135.  Congress knows how to confer that power, as it authorized the General \nServices  Administration  Administrator—in  the  same  section  of  the  statute—to \n“prescribe regulations.”  Id. at § 121(c); see also Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. \n692, 711 n.9 (2004) (“[W]hen the legislature uses certain language in one part of the \nstatute and different language in another, the court assumes different meanings were \nintended.”).  \n136.  And  Congress  has  given  the  President  the  power  to  “prescribe \nregulations” in other contexts, typically in the realm of foreign affairs and national \ndefense.  E.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3496 (“The President is authorized to prescribe regulations \ngoverning the manner of executing and returning commissions by consular officers.”); \n31 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 35 of 50 - Page ID#: 35\n32  U.S.C.  §  110  (“The  President  shall  prescribe  regulations,  and  issue  orders, \nnecessary to organize, discipline, and govern the National Guard.”). \n137.  Third, even if the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act \nauthorized the President to issue orders with the force or effect of law, it would not \nauthorize OMB’s approval of the Task Force Guidance.  The President appears to \nassume that the FPASA’s prefatory statement of purpose authorizes him to issue any \norder that he believes promotes “an economical and efficient” procurement system.  \n40 U.S.C. § 101; see Exec. Order No. 14042, 86 Fed. Reg. at 50,985 (“This order \npromotes  economy  and  efficiency  in  [f]ederal  procurement.”).    In  doing  so,  the \nPresident  mistakenly  construes  the  prefatory  purpose  statement  for  a  grant  of \nauthority.  Dist. of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 578 (2008) (“[A]part from [a] \nclarifying function, a prefatory clause does not limit or expand the scope of the \noperative clause.”).  \n138.  And even if the FPASA did authorize the President to issue binding \nprocurement orders solely because they may promote economy and efficiency, the \n210-word OMB Determination does not adequately explain or support how the Task \nForce  Guidance  actually  leads  to  better  economy  and  efficiency.    See  OMB \nDetermination, 86 Fed. Reg. at 53,691–92.  Moreover, Congress’s charge to provide \nthe federal government with an economic and efficient system for procurement is not \na broad enough delegation to impose a national-scale vaccine mandate that it has not \nseparately authorized.  Additionally, Executive Order 14042 is divorced from the \n32 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 36 of 50 - Page ID#: 36\npractical needs of procurement.  It will exclude otherwise competitive bidders and \ncause contractors to suffer labor shortages. \n139.  Fourth, the OMB Determination is inconsistent with the requirements \nof the Competition in Contracting Act, which requires federal agencies to “provide for \nfull and open competition through the use of competitive procedures.”  41 U.S.C. \n§ 3301; see 40 U.S.C. § 121(a) (requiring “policies” issued by the President pursuant \nto the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act to be “consistent with this \nsubtitle”); id. at § 111 (defining “this subtitle” in 40 U.S.C. § 121(a) as to also refer to \ndivision C (except §§ 3302, 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of title \n41).  The OMB Determination precludes an entire class of contractors from obtaining \nfederal contracts without regard to their capability to perform the contract.  That is \nunlawful.  See Nat’l Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. United States, 923 F.3d 977, 986 (Fed. Cir. \n2019) (finding invalid an agency policy that “effectively exclude[ed] an offeror from \nwinning  an  award,  even  if  that  offeror  represent[ed]  the  best  value  to  the \ngovernment”).   \n140.  Because the OMB Determination adopting the Task Force Guidance \nviolates § 1303(a), seeks to exercise a delegated power the President does not possess, \nand relies on a misreading of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, \nit is contrary to law. \nCOUNT II \nAgency action contrary to law and in excess of authority \n(FAR Council Guidance) \n \n141.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n33 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 37 of 50 - Page ID#: 37\n142.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court must “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action” that is “not in accordance with law” or “in excess of \nstatutory . . . authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.”  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), (C).   \n143.  While  the  FAR  Council  claims  to  be  issuing  only  “guidance,”  the \nguidance is being “applied . . . in a way that indicates it is binding.”  Texas v. EEOC, \n933 F.3d 433, 441 (5th Cir. 2019).  It is therefore reviewable. \n144.  The FAR Council Guidance does not explain what authority enables the \nFederal Acquisition Regulatory Council to create a government-wide procurement \nregulation mandating vaccines for contractors.  To the extent the FAR Council relies \non the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, it lacks that authority for \nthe reasons described in Count I.   \nCOUNT III \nFailure to conduct notice and comment \n(OMB Determination) \n145.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n146.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a court must “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . without observance of procedure \nrequired by law.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  \n147.  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)(1),9 a procurement policy may not take \neffect until 60 days after it is published for public comment in the Federal Register if \n                                            \n9 Plaintiffs invoke both 41 U.S.C. § 1707 and 5 U.S.C. § 553, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D), but focus on § \n1707 because it is more stringent.   \n34 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 38 of 50 - Page ID#: 38\nit relates to the expenditure of appropriated funds and has a significant effect beyond \nthe internal operating procedures of the issuing agency or has a significant cost or \nadministrative impact on contractors or offerors. \n148.  Federal agencies will have to expend appropriated funds to compensate \ncontractors  for  the  increased  cost of compliance  with the  mandates imposed  by \nExecutive Order 14042 and the Task Force Guidance.  See 41 U.S.C. § 1707(a)(1)(A). \n149.  These mandates have a significant effect beyond internal operating \nprocedures in that they require the vaccination of millions of Americans.  See id. at \n§ 1707(a)(1)(B)(i).  \n150.  These mandates also have a significant cost or administrative impact on \nboth  current  contractors,  future  contractors,  and  offerors  in  managing  the \nimplementation of the mandates.  See id. § 1707(a)(1)(B)(ii).   \n151.  Defendants failed to publish the OMB Determination (or underlying \nTask Force Guidance) in the Federal Register as required by 41 U.S.C. § 1707.   \n152.  Moreover, Defendants failed to provide the required 60-day comment \nperiod  before  the  OMB  Determination  (which adopts the  Task  Force  Guidance) \nbecame effective.   \n153.  Further, the requirements of 41 U.S.C. § 1707 were never waived with \nregard to these promulgated documents, nor could they be, consistent with law. \n154.  Additionally, pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 1.501, “significant revisions” to the \nFederal  Acquisition  Regulation  must  be  made  through  notice-and-comment \nprocedures.  But, instead of amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the OMB \n35 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 39 of 50 - Page ID#: 39\nissued  a  purported  “Notice  of  determination”  without  engaging  in  notice  and \ncomment.   \n155.  Accordingly, Defendants failed to comply with 41 U.S.C. § 1707 and 48 \nC.F.R. § 1.501 when issuing the OMB Determination, making the imposed mandates \ninvalid as a matter of law.  \nCOUNT IV \nFailure to conduct notice and comment \n(FAR Council Guidance) \n \n156.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n157.  For the same reasons discussed in Count III, the FAR Council Guidance \nis invalid. \n158.  Additionally, the FAR Council issued a purported “class deviation” not \nonly without engaging in notice and comment but also without publication in the \nFederal Register.   \n159.  Accordingly, Defendants failed to comply with 41 U.S.C. § 1707 and 48 \nC.F.R.  §  1.501  when  issuing  the  FAR  Council  Guidance,  making  the  imposed \nmandates invalid as a matter of law.  \nCOUNT V \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n(OMB Determination) \n160.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n36 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 40 of 50 - Page ID#: 40\n161.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, agency action that is \n“arbitrary [or] capricious” is unlawful and must be set aside by a court of competent \njurisdiction.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n162.  The OMB Determination (and underlying Task Force Guidance) were \nimplemented with no express findings, no explanation, and no consideration of the \ndistinct and diverse universe of federal agencies.  Such omissions evidence the pretext \nbehind their promulgation and the unreasoned decision-making leading thereto.  \n163.  OMB failed to conduct its own independent analysis and heavily relied \non  the  Task  Force  Guidance.    But  the  Guidance  does  not  display  reasoned \ndecisionmaking.  Instead, the Guidance ignores important aspects surrounding the \nmandate,  including but  not  limited  to  economic  impacts,  cost  to  States,  cost to \ncitizens, labor-force and supply-chain disruptions, the current risks of COVID-19, and \nbasic distinctions among workers such as those with natural immunity to COVID-19 \nand those who work remotely or with limited in-person contacts, among other aspects. \n164.  Furthermore, pursuant to 48 C.F.R. § 1.402, “[u]nless precluded by law, \nexecutive order, or regulation, deviations from the [Federal Acquisition Regulation] \nmay be granted [] when necessary to meet the specific needs and requirements of each \nagency.” \n165.  The OMB Determination imposes universal and uniform requirements \nwithout regard to the particularized needs and circumstances of each federal agency \nand are therefore arbitrary and capricious. \n166.  The OMB Determination is therefore arbitrary and capricious. \n37 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 41 of 50 - Page ID#: 41\nCOUNT VI \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n(FAR Council Guidance) \n167.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n168.  Pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, agency action that is \n“arbitrary [or] capricious” is unlawful and must be set aside by a court of competent \njurisdiction.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n169.  For the same reasons discussed in Count V, specifically including ¶¶ \n153–158, the FAR Council Guidance is invalid. \nCOUNT VII \nPresident’s Ultra Vires Action  \n \n170.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n171.  There  is  a  nonstatutory  cause  of  action  to  challenge  unlawful \nprocurement-related actions by the President.  See Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, \n74 F.3d 1322, 1330 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  \n172.  The purpose of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act is \nto provide the Federal Government with an “economic and efficient system” for, \namong other things, procuring and supplying property and nonpersonal services.  40 \nU.S.C. § 101.  Those activities include “[p]rocuring and supplying property and \nnonpersonal services,” use and disposal of property, and records management.  Id. \n173.  Congress did not contemplate or design the FPASA as a public health \nstatute, to impose a sweeping vaccination mandate on broad swaths of the American \npeople. \n38 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 42 of 50 - Page ID#: 42\n174.  The FPASA empowers the President to “prescribe policies and directives \nthat [he] considers necessary to carry out [the FPASA].”  40 U.S.C. § 121(a).  Those \npolicies “must be consistent with” the FPASA’s purpose, i.e., promoting economy and \nefficiency in federal contracting.  Id. at § 121(a) (emphasis added).   \n175.  The  Executive  Order,  and  resulting  Task  Force  Guidance,  OMB \nDetermination, and FAR Council Guidance, all fail to demonstrate a nexus between \na vaccine mandate and the FPASA’s purpose of promoting an “economic and efficient \nsystem” for federal contracting.  40 U.S.C. § 101; see Am. Fed’n of Lab. & Cong. of \nIndus. Orgs. v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784, 793 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (explaining that the Federal \nProperty and Administrative Services Act is violated when the President does not \ndemonstrate a “nexus” between executive action and the FPASA’s policy).  \n176.  Further,  before  the  executive  branch  may  regulate  a  major  policy \nquestion of “great and economic and political significance”—such as responding to the \nCOVID-19  pandemic—Congress  must  “speak  clearly”  to  assign  the  authority  to \nimplement such a policy.  Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. E.P.A., 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) \n(quoting Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, \n159 (2000)).   \n177.  Executive Order 14042 exceeds the President’s Federal Property and \nAdministrative  Services  Act  authority  by  directing  the  Task  Force,  without  a \ndemonstrable nexus to the FPASA’s purpose, to prescribe a sweeping public health \nframework. \n178.  The President lacks authority to issue Executive Order 14042.  \n39 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 43 of 50 - Page ID#: 43\n179.  Because Executive Order 14042 is unlawful, the imposed mandates in \nthe Task Force Guidance, the OMB Determination, and the FAR Council Guidance \nare unenforceable.   \nCOUNT VIII \nViolation of the Non-Delegation Doctrine \n180.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n181.  The vaccine mandates imposed by Executive Order 14042, the Task \nForce Guidance, the OMB Determination, and the FAR Council Guidance exceed \ncongressional authority. \n182.  To  the  extent  Defendants  argue  that  the  imposed  mandates  are \nauthorized, such authorization would constitute an improper delegation of authority. \n183.  Pursuant  to  Article  I,  Section  1  of  the  United  States  Constitution, \nCongress is vested with all legislative powers.  “Congress is not permitted to abdicate \nor to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested.”  \nA.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529–30 (1935).   \n184.  The executive branch can only exercise its own discrete powers reserved \nby Article II of the United States Constitution and such power that Congress clearly \nauthorizes through statutory command.  \n185.  Congress gives such authorization when it articulates an intelligible \nprinciple to guide the Executive that not only sanctions but also defines and cabins \nthe delegated legislative power.  \n40 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 44 of 50 - Page ID#: 44\n186.  Under the nondelegation doctrine, a general policy untethered to a \ndelegation of legislative power is not sufficient.   For a delegation to be proper, \nCongress must articulate a clear principle or directive of its will within the legislative \nact. See J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  The \nprinciple must be binding, and the delegate must be “directed to conform” to it.  Id. \n187.  The nondelegation doctrine preserves and protects important tenets of \nour democracy, including individual liberties, federalism, and the rule of law. \n188.  The broad sweeping actions of the President, OMB Director, Task Force, \nand the FAR Council to impose a vaccine mandate are not supported by an explicit \nstatutory directive within the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act or \nany other federal law. \n189.  Congress did not articulate clear or sufficient instructions in the Federal \nProperty and Administrative Services Act directing the President to implement this \npublic  health  policy  scheme  by  executive  order.    Even  if  Congress  did  clearly \nauthorize a national vaccination schedule for federal contractors, it did not give \nsufficiently clear instructions to permit the President to delegate legislative judgment \nto the Task Force or the OMB Director. \n190.  Under  the  nondelegation  doctrine,  the  imposed  mandates  are \nunconstitutional because Congress did not articulate a clear principle by legislative \nact that directs the Executive to take sweeping action that infringes on state and \nindividual rights.  A delegation sanctioning the broad and intrusive executive action \nat issue here cannot be sustained without clear and meaningful legislative guidance, \n41 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 45 of 50 - Page ID#: 45\nespecially  given  the  important  individual  rights  and  separation-of-powers  and \nfederalism concerns implicated. \n191.  The imposed mandates implicate the very issues of federalism that the \nnondelegation  doctrine  seeks  to  prevent.    Public  health  and  the  regulation  of \ninoculation regimes are traditional state functions.  When the federal government \nintrudes on a traditional state function, it must clearly articulate the scope of the \nintrusion and rationale behind its unprecedented action, which it has not done here.  \n192.  Here, the Executive Order cuts deeply into the Plaintiff States’ sphere \nof power without articulating the underlying reasons or providing a justification \nbeyond a superficial, unsupported, and pretextual reference to efficiency and economy \nin federal contracts. \n193.  Without explicit congressional authorization, the President’s Executive \nOrder  14042  and  its  implementation  to  create  a  vaccine  mandate  for  federal \ncontractor employees is unconstitutional. \nCOUNT IX \nViolation of Separation of Powers and Federalism \n \n194.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n195.  The imposed mandates are legislative actions, having the effect of a \ngenerally applicable, binding rule governing private conduct. \n196.  Pursuant  to  Article  I,  Section  1  of  the  United  States  Constitution, \nCongress is vested with all legislative powers, but Congress must act pursuant to the \nenumerated powers granted to it by Article I. \n42 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 46 of 50 - Page ID#: 46\n197.  Pursuant to Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, the \nNecessary and Proper Clause gives Congress the authority “to make all Laws which \nshall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” its general powers.  It does \nnot “license the exercise of any ‘great substantive and independent power[s]’ beyond \nthose specifically enumerated. Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, \n559 (2012) (citation omitted).  \n198.  Defendants, through the imposed mandates, have exercised power far \nbeyond what was delegated to the federal government by constitutional mandate or \ncongressional action.  It is not a “proper” exercise of Congress’ authority to mandate \nthat everyone who touches a federal contractor has to be vaccinated because the \naction here exceeds any Article I enumerated power. \n199.  Pursuant to the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, \nthe powers not delegated by the Constitution to the United States, nor prohibited by \nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. \n200.  The U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal agencies of the \nexecutive branch to implement the imposed mandates.  This is a police power left to \nthe States under the Tenth Amendment.  U.S. Const. amend X. \n201.  By interfering with the traditional balance of power between the States \nand the federal government, and by acting pursuant to ultra vires federal action, \nDefendants violated the Constitution. \n43 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 47 of 50 - Page ID#: 47\nCOUNT X \nUnconstitutional Exercise of the Spending Power \n202.  Plaintiffs incorporate each of the allegations stated above herein. \n203.  The imposed mandates are an unconstitutional condition on the States’ \nreceipt (by and through their agencies and political subdivisions who are federal \ncontractors) of federal funds. \n204.  Federal contracts are an exercise of the Spending Clause, U.S. Const. \nart. I, § 8, cl. 1, yet the challenged actions ask the States to agree to an ambiguous \ncontract term—specifically, agreeing to comply with imposed mandates that can be \nchanged at any time. \n205.  Because the imposed mandates, on information and belief, will lead to \nemployees either being fired or resigning, it is not rationally related to any federal \ninterest in a particular project or program that is the subject of a federal contract. \n206.  Additionally, because the imposed mandates cover employees who have \nno connection to the federal contract beyond just being coworkers with an employee \nwho works on such a contract and being likely to come into contact with them, the \nmandates are not rationally related to any federal interest in a particular project or \nprogram that is the subject of a federal contract. \n207.  And  as  described  above,  the  mandates  are  prohibited  by  other \nconstitutional provisions.   \n44 \n \n\nCase: 3:21-cv-00055-GFVT   Doc #: 1   Filed: 11/04/21   Page: 48 of 50 - Page ID#: 48\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to: \nA.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants,  individually  and \ncollectively, have imposes a sweeping, unlawful, and unconstitutional COVID-19 \nvaccine mandate on federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees.  \nB.  Enter  a  declaratory  judgment  that  the  vaccine  mandate  on  federal \ncontractors, subcontractors, and their employees is unlawful and therefore null and \nvoid ab initio. \nC.  Hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  the  Executive  Order,  the  OMB \nDetermination, and the FAR Council Guidance. \nD.  Grant a temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunction prohibiting \nDefendants and those acting in concert with them from enforcing this sweeping, \nunlawful,  and  unconstitutional  mandate  on  any  federal  contracting  agency, \nsubcontractor, and employees within the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the State of \nOhio, and the State of Tennessee or with respect to any of its citizens.   \nE.  Grant a temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunction prohibiting \nDefendants and those acting in concert with them from enforcing this sweeping, \nunlawful,  and  unconstitutional  mandate  on  any  federal  contracting  agency, \nsubcontractor, and employees anywhere in the United States. \nF.

BIDEN, in his official capacity  )\nas President of the United States, et al.,  ) ORDER \n  ) \n            Defendants. \n ***   ***   ***   *** \n \n  This is not a case about whether vaccines are effective.  They are.  Nor is this a case \nabout whether the government, at some level, and in some circumstances, can require citizens to \nobtain vaccines.  It can.  The question presented here is narrow.  Can the president use \ncongressionally delegated authority to manage the federal procurement of goods and services to \nimpose vaccines on the employees of federal contractors and subcontractors?  In all likelihood, \nthe answer to that question is no.  So, for the reasons that follow, the pending request for a \npreliminary injunction will be GRANTED. \nI \n  On January 20, 2021, Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. became the forty-sixth President of the \nUnited States.  On his first day in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 13991, which \nestablished the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,045–48 (Jan. 20, 2021).  \nThe Task Force’s stated mission is to “provide ongoing guidance to heads of agencies on the \n\noperation of the Federal Government, the safety of its employees, and the continuity of \nGovernment functions during the COVID–19 pandemic.”  Id. at 7,046.   \n  On September 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14042.  86 Fed. Reg. \n50,985–88 (Sept. 9, 2021).  Executive Order 14042 mandated the Safer Federal Workforce Task \nForce to provide Guidance regarding “adequate COVID–19 safeguards” by September 24, 2021, \nthat would apply to all federal contractors and subcontractors.  Id. at 50,985.  According to the \nDepartment of Labor, “workers employed by federal contractors” make up “approximately one-\nfifth of the entire U.S. labor force.”  United States Department of Labor, History of Executive \nOrder 11246, https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/about/executive-order-11246-history (last \nvisited Nov. 24, 2021).  For Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, federal contracting is a multi-\nbillion-dollar industry.  [R. 32 at 4.]  The executive order specified that the Guidance would be \nmandatory at all “contractor or subcontractor workplace locations” so long as the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget approved the Guidance and determined that it would \n“promote economy and efficiency in Federal contracting.”  86 Fed. Reg. at 50,985.  Furthermore, \nthe executive order applies to “any new contract; new contract-like instrument; new solicitation \nfor a contract or contract-like instrument; extension or renewal of an existing contract or \ncontract-like instrument; and exercise of an option on an existing contract or contract-like \ninstrument.”  Id. at 50,986.1   \n  On September 24, the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force issued its Guidance pursuant \nto Executive Order 14042.  See Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, COVID–19 Workplace \n \n1 President Biden made clear his intentions in signing Executive Order 14042 in a speech to the American Public.  \nOn the day that President Biden signed Executive Order 14042, he stated that earlier in the day he had signed an \nexecutive order requiring all federal contractors to be vaccinated.  Joseph Biden, Remarks at the White House (Sept. \n9, 2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-president-biden-on-\nfighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/.    \n2 \n \n\nSafety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and Subcontractors, \nhttps://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/Draft%20contractor%20guidance%20doc_20\n210922.pdf (last visited Nov. 24, 2021).  The Guidance requires all “covered contractors”2 to be \nfully vaccinated by December 8, 2021,3 unless they are “legally entitled to an accommodation.”  \nId. at 1.  The Guidance applies to all “newly awarded covered contracts” at any location where \ncovered contract employees work and covers “any full-time or part-time employee of a covered \ncontractor working on or in connection with a covered contract or working at a covered \ncontractor workplace.”  Id. at 3–5. \n  On September 28, the Director of the OMB, “determined that compliance by Federal \ncontractors and subcontractors with the COVID–19 workplace safety protocols detailed in that \nguidance will improve economy and efficiency by reducing absenteeism and decreasing labor \ncosts for contractors and subcontractors working on or in connection with a Federal Government \ncontract.”  86 Fed. Reg. 53,692.   \n  Executive Order 14042 tasked the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council with \n“amend[ing] the Federal Acquisition Regulation.”  86 Fed. Reg. 50,986.  The Federal \nAcquisition Regulation is a set of policies and procedures that governs the drafting and \nprocurement processes of contracts for all executive agencies.  See United States General \nServices Administration, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), https://www.gsa.gov/policy-\nregulations/regulations/federal-acquisition-regulation-far (last visited Nov. 24, 2021).  On \n \n2 A covered contractor is “a prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier who is party to a covered contract.”  Safer \nFederal Workforce Task Force, COVID–19 Workplace Safety: Guidance for Federal Contractors and \nSubcontractors, at 3.  \n3 The deadline for full vaccination has been delayed until January 18, 2022.  This means that covered contractors \nwould need to receive their Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the second dose of a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine by \nJanuary 4 to be fully vaccinated by January 18.  See The White House, Fact Sheet: Biden Administration Announces \nDetails of Two Major Vaccination Policies, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-\nreleases/2021/11/04/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-details-of-two-major-vaccination-policies/ (last \nvisited Nov. 24, 2021).   \n3 \n \n\nSeptember 30, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council issued Guidance in the form of a \nmemo to assist agencies responsible for mandating contractor and subcontractor compliance with \nthe vaccination requirement until the Federal Acquisition Regulation can be officially amended.  \nSee FAR Council Guidance, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/FAR-\nCouncil-Guidance-on-Agency-Issuance-of-Deviations-to-Implement-EO-14042.pdf (last visited \nNov. 24, 2021).  The vaccine requirement officially only applies to contracts awarded (1) on or \nafter November 15; (2) “new solicitations issued on or after October 15”; and (3) extensions to or \nrenewals of existing contracts exercised on or after October 15.”  Id. at 2.  However, the Federal \nAcquisition Regulatory Council attached a deviation clause to the Guidance that contractors were \nencouraged to insert into their current contracts.  Id. at 4–5. \n  Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on November 4, and on November 8, Plaintiffs filed a \ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction asking this court to enjoin the federal \ncontractor vaccine mandate.  [R. 12 at 31.]  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ actions were \ncontrary to procedure, arbitrary and capricious, and violated the U.S. Constitution.  Id. at 9–10.  \nOn November 9, the Court held a telephonic conference with the parties, and with no objection \nfrom the parties, denied Plaintiffs’ temporary restraining order and construed the motion as one \nfor a preliminary injunction only.4  The Court set briefing deadlines for the parties and scheduled \na hearing for Thursday, November 18.  [R. 16; R. 17.]  On November 10, the OMB Director \nissued a revised Determination that (1) revoked the prior OMB Determination; (2) provided \n \n4 Courts frequently construe joint TRO and preliminary injunction motions as a motion for a preliminary injunction \nonly and deny the TRO as moot.  See Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. Perdue, 2017 WL 2671072, at *1 \n(D. Mont. June 21, 2017) (denying TRO as moot and addressing as preliminary injunction only); Justice Res. Ctr. v. \nLouisville-Jefferson Cnty. Metro. Gov’t, 2007 WL 1302708, at *5 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 30, 2007) (denying plaintiffs’ \nrequest for a temporary restraining order and focusing only on plaintiffs’ motion for a “temporary injunction,” which \nthe court construed as a motion for preliminary injunction because defendant was given notice and opportunity to \nrespond to Plaintiff’s request); New England Health Care v. Rowland, 170 F. Supp. 2d 199, 201 n.2 (D. Conn. 2001) \n(denying TRO as moot after setting hearing on a preliminary injunction).  \n4 \n \n\nadditional reasoning and support for how the Contractor Guidance will promote economy and \nefficiency in government contracting; and (3) gave covered contractors additional time to comply \nwith the vaccination requirement.  See 86 Fed. Reg. 63,418.  On November 15, in light of the \nrevised Determination, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint.  [R. 22.]  Defendants filed a \nresponse in opposition to Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction on November 16, Plaintiffs replied on \nNovember 17, and the Court held a hearing with the parties on November 18.  [R. 27; R. 32; R. \n41.] \nII \nA \n  An initial matter is the question of standing.  Town of Chester, N.Y. v. Laroe Estates, Inc., \n137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (“a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to \npress and for each form of relief that is sought”) (quoting Davis v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 554 \nU.S. 724, 734 (2008)); see also DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006).  “At \nleast one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.”  \nTown of Chester, N.Y., 137 S. Ct. at 1651.   \n  Standing is a threshold inquiry in every federal case that may not be waived by the \nparties.  See, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975); Planned Parenthood Ass’n of \nCincinnati, Inc. v. Cincinnati, 822 F.2d 1390, 1394 (6th Cir. 1987).  “To satisfy the ‘case’ or \n‘controversy requirement’ of Article III, which is the ‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of \nstanding, a plaintiff must, generally speaking, demonstrate that he has suffered an ‘injury in fact,’ \nthat the injury is ‘fairly traceable’ to the actions of the defendant, and that the injury will likely \nbe redressed by a favorable decision.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 162 (1997) (citations \nomitted).  Plaintiffs’ injury-in-fact must be both particularized and concrete.  Spokeo, Inc. v. \n5 \n \n\nRobins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1545 (2016) (citing Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. \n(TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180–81 (2000)).  “For an injury to be particularized, it must affect the \nplaintiff in a personal and individual way.”  Id. at 1548 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nFurther, a “concrete” injury is a de facto injury that actually exists.  Id.  Finally, “a plaintiff must \nalso establish, as a prudential matter, that he or she is the proper proponent of the rights on which \nthe action is based.”  Haskell v. Washington Twp., 864 F.2d 1266, 1275 (6th Cir. 1988) (citations \nomitted). \n  Here, Defendants argue that (1) Plaintiffs have failed to provide proof in either their \nComplaint or Amended Complaint that any state agency or subdivision will be affected by the \nvaccine mandate; and (2) Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the FAR Memo under the \nredressability prong.  [R. 27 at 17–19.]  Under the first argument, Defendants argue that none of \nthe contracts Plaintiffs provide in their briefing are actually covered by the vaccine mandate \nbecause they are present and not future contracts and are merely requests for bilateral \nmodification.  Id. at 18–19.  Defendants argue that “[a]sking to change a contract term is not a \ncognizable harm.”  Id. at 19.   \n  Although the Plaintiffs did not provide an example of a new contract that is subject to the \nmandate in their briefing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs satisfy standing as to this argument for \nmultiple reasons.  States are “entitled to special solicitude in the standing analysis.”  \nMassachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007).  And States are permitted “to litigate as \nparens patriae to protect quasi-sovereign interests—i.e., public or governmental interests that \nconcern the state as a whole.”  Id. at 520 n.17 (quoting R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart \n& Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 289 (5th ed. 2003)).   \n6 \n \n\nIn 2020, according to the federal government’s System for Award Management, which \ntracks federal contracts, $10,221,706,227 worth of federal contracts were performed in \nKentucky, and $9,934,033,221 worth of federal contracts were held by vendors located in \nKentucky, including numerous state agencies.5  [R. 22 at 13 (citing SAM.gov).]  In 2020, Ohio \nwas the place of performance for $8,935,417,106 worth of federal contracts, and \n$12,498,379,202 worth of federal contracts were held by vendors located in Ohio, including \nOhio agencies.  Id. at 14.  And in 2020, Tennessee was the place of performance for \n$10,258,679,277 worth of federal contracts, and $10,010,028,677 worth of federal contracts were \nheld by Tennessee vendors, including Tennessee agencies.  Id.   \n“When a claim involves a challenge to a future contracting opportunity, the pertinent \nquestion is whether Plaintiffs ha[ve] made an adequate showing that sometime in the relatively \nnear future [they] will bid on another Government contract.”  Adarand Contractors, Inc. v. Pena, \n515 U.S. 200, 211 (1995).  As the facts above indicate, federal contracts bring in billions of \ndollars to the states of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee annually, and there is every indication \nthat federal contractors and subcontractors throughout Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee will \ncontinue bidding for new contracting opportunities.6  But see Hollis v. Biden, 2021 WL 5500500 \n(N.D. Miss. Nov. 23, 2021) (finding institutions who are “likely to be recipients of” future \nfederal contracts lacked standing to challenge Executive Order 14042).  Therefore, given that the \nOMB’s latest Determination on the matter is only a couple of weeks old, it seems disingenuous \nof Defendants to argue that because Plaintiffs do not yet have an example of a new contract \n \n5 As both parties declare in their briefing, the Court may take judicial notice of factual information located on \ngovernment websites.  See Twumasi-Ankrah v. Checkr, Inc., 954 F.3d 938, 947 n.3 (6th Cir. 2020) (Bush, J., \ndissenting). \n6 This also applies to the two Sheriff Plaintiffs, Frederick W. Stevens and Scott A. Hildenbrand, who are suing in \ntheir official capacities as sheriffs for the Seneca County and Geauga County Sheriff’s Offices, respectively.  [See R. \n12-2; R. 12-3.]    \n7 \n \n\nensuring compliance with the vaccine clause, they lack standing.  This situation is constantly \nchanging, as evidenced by the email Counsel for the Plaintiffs received during the hearing in this \nmatter stating that the University of Louisville, which relies on numerous contracts with the \nfederal government to operate, would be implementing a vaccine mandate for all University of \nLouisville employees pursuant to Executive Order 14042.   \nFurthermore, the fact that governmental agencies are already requesting that current \ncontracts, which are not officially subject to Executive Order 14042 and subsequent Guidance, \ncomply with the vaccine mandate indicates a threat of future harm to the Plaintiffs.  [See R. 32 at \n5.]  The Defendants argue that because the vaccine mandate only applies to future contracts, \ncontractors with current contracts have a choice as to whether they will comply with the vaccine \nmandate or not.  [R. 27 at 18.]  However, if the government is already attempting to require \ncontracts not officially covered by the vaccine mandate to still include such a mandate, it stands \nto reason that contractors who do not comply will likely be blacklisted from future contracting \nopportunities if they refuse to comply.  This is particularly true given President Biden’s remarks \non September 7: “If you want to work with the federal government, vaccinate your workforce.”  \nRemarks of President Joseph Biden, Remarks at the White House (Sept. 9, 2021), available at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-president-\nbiden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have \nsatisfied their burden as to the Defendants’ first standing argument. \nDefendants next argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the FAR Memo \nunder the redressability prong.  [R. 27 at 19.]  Specifically, Defendants argue that because the \nFAR Memo merely “suggests a sample clause that agencies and contracting officers might use to \nimplement the Executive Order,” enjoining the FAR Memo would not actually redress any \n8 \n \n\ninjury.  Id.  However, the FAR Memo flows directly from the President’s executive order, which \ntasked the FAR Council with recommending to agencies language to include in existing \ncontracts until the Federal Acquisition Regulation could be amended.  86 Fed. Reg. at 50, 986.   \nEssentially, the effect of the FAR Memo is to force contractors and subcontractors with \nexisting federal government contracts to include a vaccine mandate in their current contracts by \nadding a deviation clause to those current contracts.  Sure, a contractor may refuse to include the \ndeviation clause in their current contracts because current contracts are not covered by the \nvaccine mandate.  But moving forward, those contractors who refuse to include a deviation \nclause, many of whom rely on federal contracts, are provided with a Hobson’s choice: add the \nvaccine mandate to your current federal contracts by way of the deviation clause or lose out on \nfuture federal contracts.  [R. 32 at 5–6.]  Enjoining the vaccine mandate, including the FAR \nMemo, would redress this injury.   \nHere, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that they have \nsuffered an injury in fact, that the injury is fairly traceable to the Defendants’ actions, and that \nenjoining the vaccine mandate will redress the Plaintiffs’ injuries.  See Spear, 520 U.S. at 162.  \nThe Court has the power to hear this case. \nB \n  “A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy which should be granted only if the \nmovant carries his or her burden of proving that the circumstances clearly demand it.”  \nOverstreet v. Lexington–Fayette Urban County Government, 305 F.3d 566, 573 (6th Cir. 2002) \n(citing Leary v. Daeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 739 (6th Cir. 2000) (cleaned up) (“[A] preliminary \ninjunction involv[es] the exercise of a very far-reaching power ....”)).  To issue a preliminary \ninjunction, the Court must consider: (1) whether the movant has shown a strong likelihood of \n9 \n \n\nsuccess on the merits; (2) whether the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not \nissued; (3) whether the issuance of the injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and (4) \nwhether the public interest would be served by issuing the injunction.  Overstreet, 305 F.3d at \n573 (citations omitted).   \n  The Court of Appeals clarified that, “[w]hen a party seeks a preliminary injunction on the \nbasis of a potential constitutional violation, the likelihood of success on the merits often will be \nthe determinative factor.”  City of Pontiac Retired Employees Ass’n v. Schimmel, 751 F.3d 427, \n430 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Obama for Am. v. Husted, 697 F.3d 423, 436 (6th Cir. 2012)).  \nHowever, even if the plaintiff is unable “to show a strong or substantial probability of ultimate \nsuccess on the merits” an injunction can be issued when the plaintiff “at least shows serious \nquestions going to the merits and irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs any potential \nharm to the defendant if an injunction is issued.”  In re Delorean Motor Co., 755 F.2d 1223, \n1229 (6th Cir. 1985).  Thus, the Plaintiffs must show that the foregoing preliminary injunction \nfactors are met, and that immediate, irreparable harm will result if the injunction is not issued.  \n  Defendants’ arguments against Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction fall \nprimarily into two buckets: (1) whether the president exceeded his statutory and constitutional \nauthority in promulgating the executive order at issue in this case; and (2) whether the agencies \nat issue in this case followed the proper administrative procedures.  Plaintiffs argue both that the \npresident exceeded his authority in promulgating the executive order and that the agencies failed \nto follow the proper administrative procedures in implementing and enforcing President Biden’s \nexecutive order.   \n \n \n10 \n \n\n1 \n  President Biden issued Executive Order 14042 pursuant to the U.S. Constitution, 3 U.S.C \n§ 301, which provides the president with general delegation authority, and 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., \nalso known as the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA).  See 86 Fed. Reg. \n50,985–88 (Sept. 9, 2021).  Congress delegated to the president the authority to manage federal \nprocurement through FPASA.  40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.  The first question the Court must answer is \nwhether President Biden exceeded his delegated authority under FPASA in promulgating \nExecutive Order 14042.  The Court finds that he did.  \n  The scope of FPASA is a matter first impression in the Sixth Circuit7 and presents a \n“difficult problem of statutory interpretation.”  AFL-CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784, 787 (D.C. Cir. \n1979) (en banc).  The FPASA “was designed to centralize Government property management \nand to introduce into the public procurement process the same flexibility that characterizes such \ntransactions in the private sector.”  Id.  Congress’s goal in enacting FPASA was to create an \n“economical and efficient system for…procurement and supply.”  Id. at 788.  “‘Economy’ and \n‘efficiency’ are not narrow terms; they encompass those factors like price, quality, suitability, \nand availability of goods or services that are involved in all acquisition decisions.”  Id. at 789.   \n  Through the FPASA, Congress granted to the president a broad delegation of power that \npresidents have used to promulgate a host of executive orders.  See, e.g., UAW-Labor \nEmployment and Training Corp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 366 (2003) (holding that FPASA \nauthorized the president to require contractors to post notices at all facilities informing \n \n7 A Westlaw search of the term “Federal Property and Administrative Services Act” revealed that only four cases in \nthe Sixth Circuit have even mentioned the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, and none of them \naddressed the scope of the act.  See Americans United for Separation of Church and State v. School Dist. of City of \nGrand Rapids, 718 F.2d 1389, 1415 (6th Cir. 1983) (Krupansky, J. dissenting); Higginson v. United States, 384 F.2d \n504, 506 (6th Cir. 1967); Solomon v. United States, 276 F.2d 669, 673 (6th Cir. 1960); United States v. Witherspoon, \n211 F.2d 858, 860 n.1 (6th Cir. 1954).   \n11 \n \n\nemployees of certain rights); Kahn, 618 F.2d 784 (holding that FPASA authorized the president \nto require government contractors to comply with price and wage controls); Albuquerque v. U.S. \nDept. of Interior, 379 F.3d 901, 905 (10th Cir. 2004) (holding that FPASA authorized executive \norder setting out priorities “for meeting Federal space needs in urban areas”).  For decades, “the \nmost prominent use of the President’s authority under the FPASA [was] a series of anti-\ndiscrimination requirements for Government contractors.”  Kahn, 618 F.2d at 790.8 \n  However, despite Congress’s broad delegation of power under the FPASA, the \nPresident’s authority is not absolute.  Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1330 (D.C. \nCir. 1996).  The District of Columbia Circuit cautioned that the FPASA does not provide \nauthority to “write a blank check for the President to fill in at his will. The procurement power \nmust be exercised consistently with the structure and purposes of the statute that delegates that \npower.”  Id. (quoting Kahn, 618 F.2d at 793).  Furthermore, the FPASA “does not allow the \nPresident to exercise powers that reach beyond the Act’s express provisions, Kahn, 618 F.2d. at \n797 (Tamm, J., concurring), and there must be a “close nexus between the Order and the \nobjectives of the Procurement Act.”  Id. (Bazelon, J., concurring).   \n  Defendants argue that the nexus between the vaccine mandate and economy and \nefficiency in federal contracting “is self-evident.”  [R. 27 at 23.]  After all, Defendants argue, \nrequiring vaccination for all government contractors and subcontractors will limit the spread of \nCovid-19, which in turn will (1) decrease worker absence; (2) decrease labor costs; and (3) \nimprove efficiency at work sites.  [R. 27 at 23 (citing Executive Order 14042).]  However, the \n \n8 In dissent, Judge MacKinnon argues that the majority’s argument that FPASA has been used in the past to invoke \nanti-discrimination orders is misleading because, in the cases relied on by the majority, either “the courts’ discussion \nof the scope of the procurement power was dicta,” or the court did not need to “rely exclusively on the presidential \nprocurement power to uphold an affirmative action plan,” and “did not do so.”  Kahn, 618 F.2d at 810 (MacKinnon, \nJ. dissenting).   \n12 \n \n\nFPASA’s goal is to create an “economical and efficient system for…procurement and supply.”  \nKahn, 618 F.2d at 788 (emphasis added).  While the statute grants to the president great \ndiscretion, it strains credulity that Congress intended the FPASA, a procurement statute, to be the \nbasis for promulgating a public health measure such as mandatory vaccination.   \nIf a vaccination mandate has a close enough nexus to economy and efficiency in federal \nprocurement, then the statute could be used to enact virtually any measure at the president’s \nwhim under the guise of economy and efficiency.  Cf. Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dept. of Health \nand Human Servs., 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2488–89 (2021) (finding the federal government’s \ninterpretation of § 361 would grant the CDC a “breathtaking amount of authority” that could be \nused to “mandate free grocery delivery for the sick or vulnerable…[r]equire manufacturers to \nprovide free computers to enable people to work from home” or “[o]rder telecommunications \ncompanies to provide free high-speed Internet service to facilitate remote work”).   \nThe vaccine mandate applies to employees of federal contractors and subcontractors who \nwork entirely from home and are not at risk of spreading Covid-19 to others.  [R. 12 at 6 (citing \nTask Force Guidance).]  Under the same logic employed by the Defendants regarding the \nvaccine mandate, what would stop FPASA from being used to permit federal agencies to refuse \nto contract with contractors and subcontractors who employ individuals over a certain BMI for \nthe sake of economy and efficiency during the pandemic?  After all, the CDC has declared that \n“obesity worsens the outcomes from Covid-19.”  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nObesity, Race/Ethnicity, and COVID-19, https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/obesity-and-covid-\n19.html (last visited Nov. 22, 2021).   \nFurthermore, the CDC states that Covid-19 spreads more easily indoors than outdoors.  \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Participate in Outdoor and Indoor Activities, \n13 \n \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/outdoor-activities.html (last \nvisited Nov. 22, 2021).  Why couldn’t the federal government refuse to contract with contractors \nand subcontractors who work in crowded indoor office spaces or choose to engage in indoor \nactivities where Covid-19 is more likely to spread?   \nAlthough Congress used its power to delegate procurement authority to the president to \npromote economy and efficiency federal contracting, this power has its limits.  Reich, 74 F.3d at \n1330.  Furthermore, even for a good cause, including a cause that is intended to slow the spread \nof Covid-19, Defendants cannot go beyond the authority authorized by Congress.  See Ala. Ass’n \nof Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2488–89; see also Missouri v. Biden, Case No. 4:21-cv-01329-MTS, at \n*3–4 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 29, 2021) (holding that Congress must provide clear authorization if \ndelegating the exercise of powers of “vast economic and political significance,” if the authority \nwould “significantly alter the balance between federal and state power,” or if the “administrative \ninterpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of Congress’ power”).  Accordingly, the Court \nfinds that the president exceeded his authority under the FPASA. \na \nThere are several concerning statutory and constitutional implications from President \nBiden exceeding his authority under the FPASA.  Three of particular concern are the \nCompetition in Contracting Act, the nondelegation doctrine and concerns regarding federalism, \nand the Tenth Amendment.9 \n \n9 The Plaintiffs also briefly argue that the vaccination mandate violates the Spending Clause.  Plaintiffs cite to Cutter \nv. Wilkenson to argue that the government must “state all conditions on the receipt of federal funds ‘unambiguously’ \nso as to ‘enabl[e] the states to exercise their choice knowingly.”  [R. 12 at 21 (citing 423 F.3d 579, 585 (6th Cir. \n2005) (citing South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207 (1987)).]  However, Plaintiffs fail to point to any support for \nthe proposition that federal contract obligations are subject to the Dole clarity requirement.  The Court is concerned, \ngiven that the Defendants in this case are “acting as patron rather than sovereign” that accepting the Plaintiffs’ \nargument may turn simple budgetary imprecisions in federal procurement into matters of constitutional concern.  [R. \n27 at 33 (citing Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 589 (1998)).]  At this early stage in the \n14 \n \n\nPlaintiffs argue that President Biden exceeded his authority under the Competition in \nContracting Act.  [R. 12 at 16.]  Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1), federal agencies must \nprovide “full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures” in procurement.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the vaccine mandate violates § 3301.  Id.  Defendants argue that just because \na requirement may exclude certain contractors from bidding on certain jobs, that does not mean \nthat the requirement runs afoul of the Competition in Contracting Act.  [R. 27 at 24 (citing Nat’l \nGov’t Servs, Inc. v. United States, 923 F.3d 977, 985 (Fed. Cir. 2019)).]   \nHowever, National Government Services supports the Plaintiff’s position.  In National \nGovernment Services, the Federal Circuit determined that a contract award limit placed on \ncontractors by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services violated the Competition in \nContracting Act because it failed to provide for full and open competition, which the Act \nrequires.  923 F.3d at 990.  The court held that “the Award Limitations Policy precludes full and \nopen competition by effectively excluding an offeror from winning an award, even if that offeror \nrepresents the best value to the government.”  Id.  Here, Defendants may run into the same \nproblem: contractors who “represent[] the best value to the government” but choose not to follow \nthe vaccine mandate would be precluded from effectively competing for government contracts.  \nId.   \nDefendants cannot preclude full and open competition pursuant to the Competition in \nContracting Act, and Defendants have not demonstrated that they followed “the congressionally \ndesigned procedure for” excluding unvaccinated contractors and subcontractors from \ngovernment contracts.  Id.  Accordingly, at this early stage in the litigation, the Court finds that \nthis argument favors the Plaintiffs. \n \nlitigation, and on the record before the Court, the Court does not find that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits as to this claim.   \n15 \n \n\nb \n  The Constitution provides that “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \nCongress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.”  \nU.S. Const. art. I § 1.  “The nondelegation doctrine bars Congress from transferring its legislative \npower to another branch of Government.”  Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2121 (2019).  \nTherefore, under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress may not “delegate legislative power to the \nPresident to exercise an unfettered discretion to make whatever laws he thinks may be needed or \nadvisable.”  A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 537–38 (1935).  In \nthe nondelegation doctrine context, “[t]he constitutional question is whether Congress has \nsupplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee’s use of discretion.”  Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at \n2123.  Here, Plaintiffs argue that FPASA “lacks any intelligible principle if interpreted so loosely \nas to bless the Administration’s practices here.”  [R. 12 at 22.]  Plaintiffs argue that mandating \nvaccination for millions of federal contractors and subcontractors is a decision that should be left \nto Congress (or, more appropriately, the States) and is a public health regulation as opposed to a \nmeasure aimed at providing an economical and efficient procurement system.  Id. at 22–23.  \nDefendants respond that the “Procurement Act’s delegation of authority fits comfortably within \nthe bounds of constitutionally permissible delegations,” particularly given the leniency of the \n“intelligible principle” standard.  [R. 27 at 35.]   \nIt would be reasonable to assume that a vaccine mandate would be more appropriate in \nthe context of an emergency standard promulgated by OSHA.  After all, OSHA was created “to \nensure safe and healthful working conditions for workers by setting and enforcing standards and \nby providing training, outreach, education and assistance.”  Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration, About OSHA, https://www.osha.gov/aboutosha (last visited Nov. 23, 2021).  On \n16 \n \n\nNovember 5, 2021, OSHA promulgated a vaccine mandating requiring all employers with 100 or \nmore employees to “develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination \npolicy.”   86 Fed. Reg. 61,402,61,402.  However, the Fifth Circuit recently found that the \n“Occupational Safety and Health Act, which created OSHA,” could not be used under the \nnondelegation doctrine to “make sweeping pronouncements on matters of public health affecting \nevery member of society in the profoundest of ways.”  BST Holdings, LLC v. OSHA, --- F.4th ---\n-, 2021 WL 5279381, at *3 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2021).  If OSHA promulgating a vaccine mandate \nruns afoul of the nondelegation doctrine, the Court has serious concerns about the FPASA, which \nis a procurement statute, being used to promulgate a vaccine mandate for all federal contractors \nand subcontractors.10  \nAdmittedly, the OSHA vaccine mandate at issue in BST Holdings and the vaccine \nmandate in this case differ in significant ways.  First, of course, the purposes and effects of the \ntwo statutes are markedly different.  The Occupational Safety and Health Act created OSHA, \nwhich is a governmental agency responsible for overseeing workplace safety in the United \nStates.  See Occupational Safety and Health Administration, About OSHA.  The FPASA, on the \nother hand, was enacted to create an “economical and efficient system for…procurement and \nsupply.”  Kahn, 618 F.2d at 788.   \nSecond, the scope and impact of the two vaccine mandates are different.  The OSHA \nvaccine mandate applied to all companies in the United States with one hundred or more \nemployees.  BST Holdings, LLC, 2021 WL 5279381, at *1.  The OSHA mandate would have \n \n10 Following the Fifth Circuit’s stay issued on November 6 and extended on November 12, the Sixth Circuit was \nchosen by random multi-circuit lottery to decide the outcome of OSHA’s Emergency Temporary Standard requiring \nCovid-19 vaccination or weekly testing.  Andrea Hsu, 6th Circuit Court ‘wins’ lottery to hear lawsuits against \nBiden’s vaccine rule, NPR (Nov. 16, 2021), https://wwwnpr.org/2021/11/16/1056121842/biden-lawsuit-osha-\nvaccine-mandate-court-lottery.  That matter is currently pending before the Sixth Circuit.  See In re: MCP No. 165; \nOSHA Rule on Covid19 Vaccination and Testing, 86 Fed. Reg. 61402, No. 21-7000. \n17 \n \n\nforced all companies in the United States with one hundred or more employees to comply with \nthe mandate or pay a fine.  Id.  Here, however, contractors and subcontractors are free to choose \nwhether they want to bid for federal government contracts.  Only if a contractor or subcontractor \nchooses to contract with the federal government will they be required to abide by the vaccine \nmandate.  Therefore, the federal government is not forcing the vaccine mandate on contractors \nwrit large, only contractors and subcontractors who choose, moving forward, to contract with the \nfederal government.    \nThird, although BST Holdings concerned the imposition of a vaccine mandate on private \nbusinesses, the vaccine mandate in this case concerns the federal government acting as a \nbusiness entity in its own interest.  Generally, the federal government, as a business entity, is free \nto “determine those with whom it will deal, and to fix the terms and conditions upon which it \nwill make needed purchases.”  Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 127 (1940).   \nNotwithstanding these differences, however, one thing is clear in both cases: neither \nOSHA nor the executive branch is permitted to exercise statutory authority it does not have.  Cf. \nAla. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2489 (“We expect Congress to speak clearly when \nauthorizing an agency to exercise powers of vast economic and political significance.”); Kahn, \n618 F.2d at 811 (MacKinnon, J., dissenting) (“Mere proximity may count in horseshoes and \ndancing, but adherence to congressionally-prescribed standards is required for valid lawmaking \nby executive officers.”).  In this case, the FPASA was enacted to promote an economical and \nefficient procurement system, and the Defendants cannot point to a single instance when the \nstatute has been used to promulgate such a wide and sweeping public health regulation as \nmandatory vaccination for all federal contractors and subcontractors.   \n18 \n \n\nIt is true that only twice in American history, both in 1935, has the Supreme Court found \nCongressional delegation excessive.  See A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp., 295 U.S. 495; Panama \nRefining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935).  The Court believes that today’s holding is consistent \nwith prior nondelegation doctrine precedent.  However, because cases analyzing the contours of \nthe nondelegation doctrine are scarce, it may be useful for appellate courts to further develop the \ncontours of the nondelegation doctrine, particularly in light of the pandemic.  See Gundy, 139 S. \nCt. at 2131 (Alito, J., concurring) (“If a majority of this Court were willing to reconsider the \napproach we have taken for the past 84 years, I would support that effort.”). \nc \n  The Court is also concerned that the vaccine mandate intrudes on an area that is \ntraditionally reserved to the States.  This principle, which is enshrined in the Tenth Amendment \nof the Constitution, states that the “powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, \nnor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”11  U.S. \nConst. amend. X.  Generally, “[t]he regulation of health and safety matters is primarily and \nhistorically, a matter of local concern.”  Hillsborough Cnty., Fla. v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc., \n471 U.S. 707, 719 (1985); see also South Bay Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613, \n1613 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., concurring).  Plaintiffs argue that the federal government “has no \ngeneral police power, and nothing in the Constitution gives the federal government the power it \nseeks here.”  [R. 12 at 20.]  In response, Defendants argue that the FPASA is a “validly enacted \n \n11 See Thomas Jefferson Letter to George Washington, Feb. 15, 1791, Opinion on Bill for Establishing a National \nBank (“I consider the foundation of the Constitution as laid on this ground that ‘all powers not delegated to the U.S. \nby the Constitution, not prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states or to the people’ ... To take a single \nstep beyond the boundaries thus specially drawn around the powers of Congress, is to take possession of a boundless \nfield of power, no longer susceptible of any definition.”). \n19 \n \n\n[statute] under one of Congress’s enumerated powers, and the Executive Branch [is exercising] \nauthority lawfully delegated under that statute.”12  [R. 27 at 31.]   \n  The Fifth Circuit recently addressed federalism concerns in a similar governmentally \nimposed vaccine mandate context: \n[T]he Mandate likely exceeds the federal government’s authority under the \nCommerce Clause because it regulates noneconomic inactivity that falls squarely \nwithin the States’ police power. A person’s choice to remain unvaccinated and \nforgo regular testing is noneconomic inactivity. And to mandate that a person \nreceive a vaccine or undergo testing falls squarely within the States’ police \npower…The Commerce Clause power may be expansive, but it does not grant \nCongress the power to regulate noneconomic inactivity traditionally within the \nStates’ police power. In sum, the Mandate would far exceed current constitutional \nauthority. \n \nBST Holdings, LLC, 2021 WL 5279381, at *7 (citations omitted).  The Court finds BST Holdings \nto be persuasive.  On the record currently before the Court, there is a serious concern that \nDefendants have stepped into an area traditionally reserved to the States, and this provides an \nadditional reason to temporarily enjoin the vaccine mandate. \n2 \nThe next issue is whether the relevant agencies in this case followed the proper \nadministrative procedures.  Plaintiffs argue that (1) the Defendants issued the FAR Council \nGuidance and OMB Determination in violation of the procedure required by law; and (2) the \nagencies’ actions were “arbitrary and capricious.”  [R. 12 at 10, 17.] \n \n \n \n12 Defendants also argue that the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity applies here, arguing that “federal \ncontractors are treated the same as the federal government itself.”  [R. 27 at 32 (citing United States v. Cal., 921 \nF.3d 865, 882 n.7 (9th Cir. 2019)).]  However, as Plaintiffs point out, intergovernmental immunity is not relevant to \nthis lawsuit because “Plaintiffs are not suing federal contractors for violations of state law,” but are instead suing the \nfederal government as, at least in part, federal contractors.  [R. 32 at 18.]  \n20 \n \n\na \nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires a reviewing court to “hold unlawful \nand set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be…without observance of \nprocedure required by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that 41 U.S.C. \n§ 1707(a) requires procurement policies, regulations, procedures, or forms to be published in the \nFederal Register for sixty days before it can take effect, which Plaintiffs state Defendants failed \nto do with regards to the FAR Council Guidance and OMB Determination.13  In response, \nDefendants argue that the FAR Council Guidance is not final agency action or subject to review \nunder § 1707.  [R. 27 at 29.]  Furthermore, Defendants argue that the OMB Determination is not \nreviewable under § 1707, and even if it were reviewable, the OMB Determination satisfies § \n1707’s procedural requirements.  Id. at 25.  Although the procedural path taken by the agencies \nwas, at times, inartful and a bit clumsy, the Court finds based on the record before it that the \nDefendants likely followed the procedures required by statute. \nFirst, FAR Council Guidance is not subject to judicial review pursuant to the APA \nbecause the Guidance does not constitute final agency action.  See Spear, 520 U.S. at 178 \n(finding that final agency action is action that marks “the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process,” and “by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow”).  Here, as Defendants correctly argue, Executive Order \n14042 instructed the FAR Council to “take initial steps to implement” the contract clause.  86 \nFed. Reg. 50,985–88 (Sept. 9, 2021) (emphasis added).  Therefore, the FAR Council Guidance is \nnot final agency action and is therefore not subject to judicial review under the APA. \n \n13 Plaintiffs also invoke 5 U.S.C. § 553 but focus on § 1707 “because it is more stringent.”  [R. 12 at 11.] \n21 \n \n\nFurthermore, § 1707 does not apply to the FAR Council Guidance because it constitutes \nnonbinding guidance that does not rise to the level of a “procurement policy, regulation, \nprocedure, or form.”  § 1707.  The purpose of the FAR Council Guidance was to “support \nagencies in meeting the applicability requirements and deadlines set forth in” the executive \norder, and to encourage agencies to “exercise their authority” in helping contractors and \nsubcontractors insert deviation clauses into their contracts.  FAR Council Guidance.  Therefore, \nthe Court finds that Plaintiffs’ challenge of Defendants’ FAR Council Guidance is not likely to \nsucceed on the merits. \n  The OMB Determination is a bit more complicated.  Plaintiffs filed their Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction and argued that the OMB Determination failed to “adhere to the process \nmandated by law.”  [R. 12 at 12.]  However, on November 16, eight days after Plaintiffs filed \ntheir motion, the OMB Director rescinded its original Determination and issued a new \nDetermination.  86 Fed. Reg. 63418.  In addition to revoking the prior Determination, the OMB \nDirector’s new Determination also provided more robust support for the proposition that the \nvaccine mandate will promote economy and efficiency in government contracting, provided \ncovered contractors more time to comply with the vaccine mandate, and invoked § 1707 “to the \nextent that…1707 is applicable.”  Id.   \n  Defendants first argue that § 1707 does not apply to the OMB determination because that \nsection “does not apply to exercises of Presidential authority like the OMB Determination” in \nthis case.  [R. 27 at 25.]  However, the D.C. Circuit squarely rejected this argument in Reich. \nThere, the Court stated: \nThat the “executive’s” action here is essentially that of the President does not \ninsulate the entire executive branch from judicial review. We think it is now well \nestablished that “[r]eview of the legality of Presidential action can ordinarily be \nobtained in a suit seeking to enjoin the officers who attempt to enforce the \n22 \n \n\nPresident’s directive.” Franklin, 505 U.S. at 815, 112 S.Ct. at 2790 (Scalia, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Even if the Secretary were \nacting at the behest of the President, this “does not leave the courts without power \nto review the legality [of the action], for courts have power to compel subordinate \nexecutive officials to disobey illegal Presidential commands.” \n \nReich, 74 F.3d at 1328.  The Court further explained that “if [a] federal officer, against whom \ninjunctive relief is sought, allegedly acted in excess of his legal authority, sovereign immunity \ndoes not bar a suit.”  Id. at 1329.  The Court finds Reich to be persuasive.  Reich also involved a \nchallenge to an executive order promulgated under FPASA.  Id. at 1324.  Therefore, the Court \nfinds that review of the OMB Determination is appropriate in this case.   \nHowever, judicial review is not fatal to the OMB Determination.  From the outset, the \nCourt notes that Plaintiff’s arguments pertaining to the September 24 OMB Determination were \nrendered moot by the promulgation of the new OMB Determination on November 16.  See \nAkiachak Native Community v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 827 F.3d 100, 113 (D.C. Cir. 2016) \n(collecting cases demonstrating that it is an “uncontroversial and well-settled principle of law” \nthat “when an agency has rescinded and replaced a challenged regulation, litigation over the \nlegality of the original regulation becomes moot”).  Furthermore, Plaintiffs argued that the OMB \nDirector failed to either permit notice and comment or invoke § 1707(d)’s waiver of notice and \ncomment.  [R. 12 at 11–12.]  While this was true of the OMB Director’s initial Determination, \nthe subsequent Determination included a thirty-day notice and comment period and invoked § \n1707(d).  86 Fed. Reg. 63423. \nPlaintiffs argue that the OMB Director’s invocation of § 1707(d) in its subsequent \nDetermination is “facially senseless” and irrational because the Determination simultaneously \ndelayed the mandate compliance date and invoked the § 1707(d) “urgent and compelling \ncircumstances,” exception.  [R. 32 at 10–11.]  Plaintiffs’ argument is well taken, and further \n23 \n \n\nreview may demonstrate that the OMB Determination failed to follow the proper procedures.  \nHowever, there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of the OMB Director, and Counsel for the \nDefendants explained during the hearing in this matter that the compliance date was delayed to \nbenefit federal contractors and ensure that they would have sufficient time to comply with the \nmandate.  Ultimately, based on the limited record, the Court finds that the FAR Council \nGuidance and subsequent OMB Determination in this matter did not run afoul of the proper \nadministrative procedures.   \nb \n  Plaintiffs also argue that the administration’s actions in promulgating the vaccine \nmandate were arbitrary and capricious under the APA.14  As the Supreme Court recently \nexplained: \nThe APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires that agency action be \nreasonable and reasonably explained. Judicial review under that standard is \ndeferential, and a court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the \nagency. A court simply ensures that the agency has acted within a zone of \nreasonableness and, in particular, has reasonably considered the relevant issues \nand reasonably explained the decision. \n \nFed. Commc’ns Comm’n v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021).   \nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that the OMB Determination failed to explain how the vaccine \nmandate would “promote economy and efficiency in procurement.”  [R. 12 at 17.]  Second, \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants “failed to consider the possibility that their actions would cause \na labor shortage.”  Id. at 18.  Third, Plaintiff argue that the OMB Determination ignored “costs to \nthe Plaintiffs.”  Id.  Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that the OMB Determination failed to consider \n“lesser alternatives to a vaccine mandate.”  Id.  And finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Task Force \n \n14 Plaintiffs’ arguments here pertain to both the FAR Council Guidance and OMB Determination.  [R. 12 at 17–19.]  \nHowever, because the Court found above that the FAR Council Guidance was not subject to review under the APA, \nthe Court need only address Plaintiffs’ arguments as they pertain to the OMB Determination.   \n24 \n \n\nGuidance and FAR Council Guidance concluding that the vaccine mandate would “improve \nprocurement efficiency by reducing absenteeism and decreasing labor costs is blatantly \npretextual.”  Id. at 19.  \n  Plaintiffs’ first argument primarily pertained to the OMB Director’s first Determination, \nwhich, as explained above, is now moot.  It is true that the first Determination only included a \n210-word explanation for how the vaccine mandate would create contracting efficiencies.  See \nOMB Determination, 86 Fed. Reg. at 53,691–92.  But the subsequent Determination \npromulgated on November 16 included a more thorough and robust economy-and-efficiency \nanalysis.  See Fed. Reg. 86 63,421–23.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ first argument fails.  \n  Similar to Plaintiffs’ first argument, the second are third arguments are more applicable \nto the OMB Director’s first Determination than the second.  In the OMB Director’s second \nDetermination, she specifically addressed potential effects on the labor force and costs of the \nvaccine mandate, finding that few employees will quit if faced with a vaccine mandate and that \nCovid-19 vaccination will reduce net costs.  Id. at 63421–23.  It is perfectly reasonable for the \nPlaintiffs to disagree with Defendants on this point.  However, “[w]hen, as here, an agency is \nmaking predictive judgments about the likely economic effects of a rule, we are particularly \nloath to second-guess its analysis.”  Newspaper Ass’n of Am. v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 734 F.3d \n1208, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2013).   \nThe Court likewise rejects Plaintiffs’ one-sentence argument that the OMB Director \nfailed to consider lesser alternatives to a vaccine mandate.  See La Quinta Corp. v. Heartland \nProperties LLC, 603 F.3d 327, 338 n.5 (6th Cir. 2010) (finding argument made without \nelaboration is waived); see also In re Travel Agent Comm’n Antitrust Litig., 583 F.3d 896, 901 \n25 \n \n\n(6th Cir. 2009) (“[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at \ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived.”).  \nPlaintiffs’ final argument, that Defendants’ finding that a vaccine mandate would \nimprove procurement efficiency is pretextual, also fails.  To support this argument, Plaintiffs \nargue that from the beginning, the President’s statements demonstrate that this executive order \nand the vaccine mandate are an effort to get more people vaccinated.  [R. 12 at 19.]  However, \nthe Court is “reluctant to consider the President’s motivation in issuing the Executive Order.”  \nReich, 74 F.3d at 1335.  Furthermore, the subsequent OMB Determination provided ample \nsupport for the premise that a vaccine mandate will improve procurement efficiency.  See 86 \nFed. Reg. 63,421–23.  Furthermore, “a court may not reject an agency’s stated reasons for acting \nsimply because the agency might also have had other unstated reasons.”  Dep’t of Com. v. New \nYork, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2573 (2019).  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ arguments that the \nadministration’s actions were arbitrary and capricious fail. \n3 \nThe Court finds, based on the limited record at this stage in the litigation, that Defendants \nhave followed the appropriate procedural requirements in promulgating the vaccine mandate.  \nHowever, because the Court also finds that the president exceeded his authority under the \nFPASA, and for the serious Constitutional concerns addressed above, the Court holds that \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits as to their preliminary injunction.  Furthermore, the \nCourt finds that Plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief and that \npreliminary relief is not contrary to the public interest.   \nPlaintiff agencies and contractors are now having to make tough choices about whether \nthey will choose to comply with the vaccine mandate or lose out on future federal government \n26 \n \n\ncontracts.  For the individual Plaintiffs, “the loss of constitutional freedoms ‘for even minimal \nperiods of time…unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.’”  BST Holdings, LLC, 2021 WL \n5279381, at *8 (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)).   \nFurthermore, “complying with a regulation later held invalid almost always produces the \nirreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance.”  Id. (citing Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 433 \n(5th Cir. 2016)).  And the States “have an interest in seeing their constitutionally reserved police \npower over public health policy defended from federal overreach.”  Id.  Finally, “any abstract \n‘harm’ a stay might cause…pales in comparison and importance to the harms the absence of a \nstay threatens to cause countless individuals and companies.”  Id.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have \nsatisfied the requisite preliminary injunction factors in this case.  \nC \nLastly, the Court must consider the scope of its injunction.  The Sixth Circuit has held \nthat a “district court should limit the scope of [an] injunction to the conduct ‘which has been \nfound to have been pursued or is related to the proven unlawful conduct.’”  Howe v. City of \nAkron, 801 F.3d 718, 753 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting E.E.O.C. v. Wilson Metal Casket Co., 24 F.3d \n836, 842 (6th Cir. 1994)).  The Defendants’ actions affect Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, as \nwell as the additional two plaintiffs in this case.  However, individuals in every state in the \ncountry are affected.  While it is true that the evidence presented by the parties primarily relates \nto Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee, this Court’s ruling rests on facts that are universally present \nin the federal government’s dealings with contractors and subcontractors in all of the states.  \nConsequently, this Court must consider the breadth of its injunction.  Should it temporarily \nenjoin enforcement of the vaccine mandate for contractors and subcontractors as it relates to (1) \n27 \n \n\nthe Eastern District of Kentucky (this Court’s District); (2) Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky (the \nentities before the Court); or (3) all of the States (both parties and non-parties). \nIn Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) Justice \nThomas discussed the increasing frequency of “universal” or “nationwide injunctions.”  Justice \nThomas expressed his skepticism of such injunctions, noting: (1) historical principles of equity in \nArticle III courts; (2) the recency of nationwide injunctions; (3) and the properly limited role of \ndistrict courts.  Id. at 2425–29 (“[In the past, as] a general rule, American courts of equity did not \nprovide relief beyond the parties to the case”).  Justice Thomas found that the sweeping relief \nbrought by nationwide injunctions likewise brings “forum shopping” and makes “every case a \nnational emergency for the courts and the Executive Branch.”  Id. at 2425.  Instead, district \ncourts should allow legal questions to percolate through the federal court system.  Id.  Justice \nGorsuch affirmed this notion in Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Noting that “[e]quitable remedies, like remedies in general, are meant \nto redress the injuries sustained by a particular plaintiff in a particular lawsuit,” Justice Gorsuch \nfound that nationwide injunctions “raise serious questions about the scope of courts’ equitable \npowers under Article III.”  Id.  Not only are such injunctions impracticable, they “force judges \ninto making rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions.”  Id.  Careful review by multiple \ndistrict and circuit courts, on the other hand, allows the Supreme Court the benefit of thoughtful \nand, at times, competing outcomes.  Id.   \nAlthough the debate over the proper scope of injunctions is ongoing, this Court believes \nthat redressability in the present case is properly limited to the parties before the Court. \nConsequently, the scope of the permanent injunction shall apply to Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee \nand the additional sheriff plaintiffs before the Court in equal force. \n28 \n \n\nIII \n  Once again, the Court is asked to wrestle with important constitutional values implicated \nin the midst of a pandemic that lingers.  These questions will not be finally resolved in the \nshadows.  Instead, the consideration will continue with the benefit of full briefing and appellate \nreview.  But right now, the enforcement of the contract provisions in this case must be paused.    \nAccordingly, and the Court being sufficiently advised and for the reasons set forth herein, it \nis hereby ORDERED as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction [R. 12] is GRANTED;  \n2.  The Government is ENJOINED from enforcing the vaccine mandate for federal \ncontractors and subcontractors in all covered contracts in Kentucky, Ohio, and \nTennessee. \nThis the 30th day of November, 2021.  \n \n \n  \n29 \n ",
