    "summary": "<p>This case is about whether the federal government can require Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. President Joe Biden announced in September 2020 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would issue a rule requiring vaccination for all employees in Medicare- and Medicaid- participating facilities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), which is an HHS component, issued a rule to that effect. The State of Florida sued HHS, the United States, and CMS in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida on November 17, 2021. Florida argued that the the rule was made in violation go the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it was issued without consultation with the states and exceeded CMS's statutory authority. Florida also argued that CMS failed to engage in notice and comment as required by the APA and that the agency action was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. Lastly, Florida argued that the mandate violated the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution by conditioning the state's receipt of federal funds on enforcement of the mandate. The state requested that the court enjoin the mandate and declare the federal government's actions unlawful. The case was assigned to Judge Margaret Catharine Rodgers.</p>\r\n<p>On November 17, Florida moved for a preliminary injunction. On November 20, 2021, the court denied the state's motion. The court stated that, under Eleventh Circuit law, even if the plaintiff demonstrates a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, preliminary injunction relief is improper in the absence of a substantial likelihood of irreparable injury. The court found no adequate showing of a likelihood of irreparable injury prior to the December 6, 2021, which is the date that the mandate begins to take affect. While the state submitted affidavits estimating the number of employees who will resign from the state's agencies and institutions due to the mandate, the court found these estimates speculative, rather than actual and imminent, and disregarded the estimates as conclusory. The court also stated that the potential economic loss from the withholding of federal funding from the state for refusal to comply with the mandate is not irreparable since the injury could be undone through monetary remedies. In addition, the court noted that there was no evidence to suggest that the anticipated loss of federal funding from state agencies' noncompliance would occur immediately on December 6. While Florida argued that the state's sovereignty would be irreparably injured through the preemption of its own laws and policies, the court found that this argument lacked merit and that the state failed to reference any established policy in danger or preemption.</p>\r\n<p>On November 23, 2021, the state appealed the court's refusal to grant its motion for a preliminary injunction (USCA Case # 21-14098) and moved in the district court for an emergency motion for an injunction pending the appeal. On November 27, the court denied the state's emergency motion but reinstated Florida's initial request for preliminary injunctive relief. While it denied the emergency motion for the same reasons that it denied the initial motion for a preliminary injunction, the court re-examined the state's argument that the federal mandate interferes with the state's policies, since the state passed a bill on November 18, 2021, which prohibited private and public employer COVID-19 vaccination mandates. The state argued that the conflict between the state and federal laws would irreparably injure the state's sovereignty by precluding the state from enforcing its own law and that it would force public health agency and facility heads to choose which law to follow and which to violate. The state also argued that the federal law would harm state residents working in healthcare and patients who may lose access to healthcare due to the mandate. Due to the passage of the state law, the court reinstated Florida's request for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On November 28, the parties jointly moved to vacate further briefing and hearing on the state's motion for a preliminary injunction. The parties stated that, since the court originally denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and since Florida had already appealed that order, there was at a minimum a substantial doubt as to whether the court divested itself of jurisdiction to reconsider the order. Florida also stated its intent to move for an injunction pending appeal with the Eleventh Circuit on November 29. On November 29, the district court granted the joint motion and partially vacated the November 27 order insofar as it reinstated Florida's motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On December 6, 2021, the Eleventh Circuit denied the state's motion for an injunction pending appeal. 19 F.4th 1271. The court noted cases by other states over the federal vaccination mandates, including <em>Missouri v. Biden</em> (No. 4:21-cv-1329) and <em>Louisiana v. Becerra</em> (No. 3:21-cv-03970). In the latter case, the Western District of Louisiana entered a nationwide preliminary injunction, which barred the federal government from enforcing the vaccine mandate in Florida. Despite the fact that the Louisiana case effectively awarded Florida the relief it sought in the district court, the state still urged the Eleventh Circuit to decide its motion for an injunction, based on its expectation that the federal government would seek a stay of the injunction issued in <em>Louisiana</em>. The Eleventh Circuit found that the nationwide injunction did not moot Florida's appeal based on the \"capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review\" exception to mootness, which allows a court to review a matter if the challenged action is too short to be fully litigation prior to its expiration, and there is a reasonable expectation that the complaining party will be subjected to the same action again. The court found a reasonable expectation that Florida would be subjected to the vaccine rule again due to the possibility that the Fifth Circuit would not uphold the nationwide aspect of the injunction in <em>Louisiana</em>. The court then turned to the other aspect of the mootness exception: a short timeframe. Since the federal rule was to take effect on December 6 and the federal government requested that the Fifth Circuit decide the appeal in <em>Louisiana </em>by December 5, Florida would be immediately subject to the vaccine mandate if the Fifth Circuit lifted the nationwide injunction. Given that this case met both parts of the \"capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review\" exception, the Eleventh Circuit found that the case was not mooted by the injunction in <em>Louisiana</em>.</p>\r\n<p>After finding that the appeal was not moot, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that Florida failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, failed to demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable injury absent an injunction, and failed to show that the balance of the equities favored an injunction. First, the court found that the state failed to demonstrate that the Secretary of HHS lacked the statutory authority to issue the vaccine mandate because both the Medicare and Medicaid statutes authorize the Secretary to set standards to protect the health and safety of patients and that the rule did not run afoul of 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1395, which prohibits a federal officer from exercising supervision or control over the practice of medicine, the manner in which medical services are provided, or the operation of an institution. Rather, the court construed the Secretary's rule as a regulation of a federal program.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the Eleventh Circuit found that Florida failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success in showing that the Secretary was not permitted to bypass the notice-and-comment requirement of the APA. The court found that the Secretary provided a detailed explanation for why there was good cause for dispensing with the notice-and-comment requirement, including the urgency of the pandemic, the outbreaks caused by the Delta variant, and the upcoming influenza season. Third, the court ruled that Florida failed to demonstrate likelihood of success in showing that the vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious. The court found that, rather than the agency's actions being irrational, the federal government offered ample evidence supporting the Secretary's determination that facility staff vaccination will provide important protection for patients.</p>\r\n<p>Moving to the irreparable injury prong of the preliminary injunction analysis, the Eleventh Circuit found that Florida failed to establish that it would face irreparable injury absent injunctive relief. The court noted that the federal government does not invade state sovereignty simply because it passes laws or regulations preempting conflicting state laws. The court stated that a finding of irreparable injury in this case would mean that a state would suffer irreparable injury from any federal law with preemptive effect. The court also found that the state failed to show why the district court erred in finding that Florida's predicted staffing shortages were merely speculative and conclusory. The court also agreed with the district court's finding that Florida does not face an irreparable injury simply because employees working in federally funded facilities are forced to abide by&nbsp; rules governing the federal program. The court also found that Florida failed to establish that an injunction is in the public interest because enjoining the rule would harm the public's interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting the safety or healthcare patients and staff.</p>\r\n<p>On December 10, the parties jointly moved to stay all proceedings in the district court pending appeal. The court granted the motion and stayed the case on December 13, 2021. On January, 11, 2022, the Eleventh Circuit denied Florida's motion for an initial hearing en banc. On January 21, the state moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal. On January 25, 2022, the Eleventh Circuit granted the motion and dismissed the appeal. 2022 WL 529044. On February 4, 2022, Florida voluntarily dismissed the case in the district court in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Biden v. Missouri</em>, 142 S. Ct. 647 (2022). The case is now closed.</p>",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nPENSACOLA DIVISION \n \nSTATE OF FLORIDA,  \n \n  Plaintiff, \n \nv.             No. 3:21-cv-2722-MCR-HTC \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND  \nHUMAN SERVICES, et al., \n       \n  Defendants. \n_________________________________/ \n \nFLORIDA’S EMERGENCY MOTION  \nFOR INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL  \nThree  days  ago,  this  Court  denied  Florida’s  Motion  for  Temporary \nRestraining  Order  or  Preliminary  Injunction,  concluding  that  Florida  has  not \nestablished that it will suffer irreparable harm because of CMS’s vaccine mandate. \nECF No. 6 (Order). Yet Florida has already suffered irreparable harm: The mandate \npurports to preempt state laws that bar employers from requiring employees to \nsubmit to vaccination, and Florida’s officials must violate such state laws to comply \nwith the mandate. Moreover, the other harms that the Court addressed are neither \nspeculative nor reparable. And the Court did not address a host of other impending \nharms, each of which independently suffices to satisfy the irreparable-harm element.  \nIn less than two weeks, CMS’s mandate will gut a healthcare industry already \non the brink. The rule requires the first dose of the vaccine no later than December \n\n6, 2021. Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff \nVaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555, 61,573 (Nov. 5, 2021). To prevent those harms, \nFlorida has appealed the Court’s Order. ECF No. 8. And given the urgency and \nseriousness of this matter, it now moves for an emergency injunction pending appeal. \nFlorida intends to seek an injunction pending appeal with the Eleventh Circuit no \nlater than Monday, November 29, 2021, should this Court not afford Florida relief \nbefore then. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nEven when a court “refuses . . . an injunction,” it may nevertheless “grant \nan injunction” while “an appeal” from its order “is pending.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(d). \nThe  relevant  considerations  are  substantially  that  of  a  request  for  preliminary \ninjunction. See Ga. Republican Party, Inc. v. Sec’y of State for Ga., 2020 WL \n7488181, at *1 (11th Cir. Dec. 21, 2020). The movant must show “(1) a substantial \nlikelihood that [the movant] will prevail on the merits of the appeal; (2) a substantial \nrisk of irreparable injury to [the movant] unless the injunction is granted; (3) no \nsubstantial  harm  to  other  interested  persons;  and  (4)  no  harm  to  the  public \ninterest.” Touchston v. McDermott, 234 F.3d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). \nThe fact that unlawful government action purports to stem the spread of COVID-19 \ndoes not prevent a movant from meeting the third and fourth prongs. See Roman \nCath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63 (2020). \n2 \n \n\nARGUMENT \nTo avoid needlessly expending the Court’s resources, Florida relies on and \nincorporates the arguments raised in its Motion for Temporary Restraining Order or \nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. 2.1 It will instead focus on the Court’s concerns \nabout irreparable harm and on irreparable harms that the Court did not address. \n1.  To  start,  the  Court  rejected  Florida’s  argument  that  the  mandate \ninfringes on Florida’s sovereignty by purporting to preempt state law prohibiting \nvaccine mandates. Order at 10. The Court reasoned that the argument was premature \nbecause Florida is merely “contemplating” a ban on vaccine mandates. Id. It also \nheld that the argument “lacks merit” at any rate. Id. With respect, the Court was \nmistaken on both the facts and the law. \nOn the facts, when this Court issued its order on November 20, Florida was \nnot merely contemplating a ban on vaccine mandates: It had enacted one. E.g., Fla. \nStat. §§ 381.00317, 112.0441, 381.00319 (enacted Nov. 18, 2021). So Florida’s \nsovereign harm began before the Court denied the State’s motion and is ongoing, \nnot “speculative.” Order at 10. \n \n1 In its motion, Florida relied on a declaration from the Department of Corrections stating \nthat a private hospital in Florida was requiring correctional officers to comply with the mandate to \nenter its facilities. See ECF No. 2, at 11. Since that time, the hospital has informed the Department \nthat it no longer intends to enforce that requirement.  \n3 \n \n\nOn the law, Florida’s sovereign harm is irreparable. The “inability to enforce \nits duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the State.” Abbott v. Perez, \n138 S. Ct. 2305, 2324 n.17 (2018); see also Hand v. Scott, 888 F.3d 1206, 1215 (11th \nCir. 2018) (Florida suffered irreparable harm when “it could not apply its own \nlaws”). As does federal action that infringes on a State’s “sovereign interests and \npublic policies.” Kansas v. United States, 249 F.3d 1213, 1227–28 (10th Cir. 2001); \nsee also West Virginia v. Dep’t of Treasury, 2021 WL 5300944, at *19 (N.D. Ala. \nNov. 15, 2021) (federal law caused irreparable harm when it “intrud[ed] on [a] \nState’s ability to exercise its indispensable sovereign power to tax” (quotations \nomitted)). The mandate does precisely that: It claims to preempt conflicting state \nlaws, bans on vaccine mandates included. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613. In so doing, the \nmandate threatens to hobble Florida’s ability to enforce its chosen policy initiatives, \nundermining its sovereignty without financial recourse. See Odebrecht Const., Inc. \nv. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Transp., 715 F.3d 1268, 1289 (11th Cir. 2013). \nThe mandate also inflicts sovereign harm in another way. It “forc[es] state \nofficials to choose between violating a federal rule to comply with [state] law, and \nvice versa,” Texas v. United States, 95 F. Supp. 3d 965, 981 (N.D. Tex. 2015), an \ninjury to the State’s autonomy that is irreparable because it cannot be remedied \nfinancially, Odebrecht, 715 F.3d at 1289. \n4 \n \n\n2.  Next, the Court rejected Florida’s claim that it will lose state employees \nbecause some will not take the vaccine, concluding that Florida lacked “supporting \nfactual evidence.” Order at 8–9. But Florida has in fact shown irreparable harm on \nthis basis. \nFirst, in establishing irreparable harm, Florida need not show that impending \nharm is “inevitable.” Humana, Inc. v. Avram A. Jacobson, M.D., P.A., 804 F.2d \n1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1986). It need show only that irreparable harm is “likely . . . in \nthe absence of preliminary relief.” Benisek v. Lamone, 138 S. Ct. 1942, 1944 (2018). \nIn making this determination, the Court should consider “the predictable effect of \nGovernment action on the decisions of third parties.” See Dep’t of Commerce v. New \nYork, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). And here, it is perfectly clear that a “predictable \neffect” of the mandate is the loss of healthcare employees.  \nCOVID-19  vaccines  have  been  available  to  healthcare  workers  since \nDecember 2020.2 Even so, as CMS stressed in issuing its rule, 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,604–06,  many  healthcare  workers  remain  unvaccinated.  For  example,  about \n“70% of the clinical licensed practical nurses” at Florida’s Walton Community \nHealth Center are unvaccinated. ECF No. 2-3 ¶ 18. Similarly, Florida’s Agency for \n \n2 Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination, \n86 Fed. Reg. 61,555, 61,584 (Nov. 5, 2021); Maggie Fox, Some Americans should start getting \nthe first Covid-19 vaccine today. It will take months before everyday people get the shots, CNN \n(Dec.  14,  2020),  https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/health/covid-vaccine-timeline/index.html \n(reporting that healthcare workers would be eligible for vaccination in December 2020).  \n5 \n \n\nHealth Care Administration (AHCA) found just a few months ago that 42% of \nFlorida  hospital  workers  were  not  vaccinated.3  And  given  the  longstanding \navailability of COVID-19 vaccines, it is “predictable” that at least some of these \nworkers have not yet taken a vaccine because they fundamentally oppose doing so \nand will not take one even on pain of termination. See Commerce, 139 S. Ct. at 2566.  \nIn fact, CMS has admitted as much. In issuing its mandate, it recognized that \nthere “might be a certain number of health care workers who choose” to leave the \nmedical field as a result. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569. It even cited one instance where \ntriple-digit numbers of workers resigned or were fired from a single facility for \nrefusing to take a vaccine. Id. at 61,569 n.155 (citing a report that 153 employees of \nHouston Methodist Hospital quit following its vaccination mandate).4 And these \nfindings track data from a national poll published just a week before the mandate \nissued,  which  found  that  72%  of  unvaccinated  workers  will  quit  rather  than \nsuccumb.5  Altogether,  this  evidence  more  than  establishes  that,  without  an \ninjunction, employee loss is likely to occur. See Benisek, 138 S. Ct. at 1944. \n \n3 Liz Crawford, AHCA: 42% of Florida hospital workers weren’t vaccinated, as of June 4, \nWTSP (July 22, 2021), https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/hospital-\nworkers-not-vaccinated/67-9e842ff1-e5b0-4f1f-8f9f-ccfec865ccbf. \n4 Dan Diamond, 153 people resigned or were fired from a Texas hospital system after \nrefusing  to  get  vaccinated,  The  Washington  Post  (June  22,  2021), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/06/22/houston-methodist-loses-153-employees-\nvaccine-mandate/. \n5 Liz Hamel et al., KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor: October 2021, KFF (Oct. 28, 2021), \nhttps://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-october-\n2021/. \n6 \n \n\nThe Court denied Florida’s motion in part because it mistakenly thought that \nany “statements regarding employees’ intent to resign are hearsay.” Order at 9. But \nsuch statements fall within the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule. See Fed. \nR. Evid. 803(3). That exception permits the use of an out-of-court statement to show \n“the declarant’s then-existing state of mind (such as motive, intent, or plan).” Id. \nHere, any hearsay statements from employees merely establish that they intend to \nresign if forced to vaccinate, and are thus admissible under Rule 803(3). See, e.g., \nChristian Tennant Custom Homes of Fla., Inc. v. EBSCO Gulf Coast Dev., Inc., 2017 \nWL 4102458, at *4 (N.D. Fla. Sept. 15, 2017) (Rodgers, C.J.) (holding that hearsay \nevidence was admissible under state-of-mind exception when it proved declarant’s \nintent to enter into a contract). \nAnd even if this exception did not apply, the Court may consider hearsay at \n“the preliminary injunction stage” if “the evidence is appropriate given the character \nand objectives of the injunctive proceeding.” Levi Strauss & Co. v. Sunrise Int’l \nTrading  Inc.,  51  F.3d  982,  985  (11th  Cir.  1995)  (quotation  omitted).  Hearsay \nevidence is no doubt appropriate here. CMS has given the States an exceedingly \nshort timeframe to gather evidence to challenge the mandate—just 30 days, less than \nhalf the time CMS needed to craft the rule. See ECF No. 2 at 22. Making matters \nmore difficult, vaccination status and preference is a deeply personal issue, so it is \nhard to obtain on-record statements from employees who plan to decline a vaccine. \n7 \n \n\nThese  unique  circumstances  more  than  justify  the  use  of  hearsay  evidence for \npurposes of a temporary injunction. E.g., ACLU of Fla., Inc. v. Lee, 2021 WL \n4350174, at *1 (N.D. Fla. July 1, 2021) (Winsor, J.) (considering hearsay statement \nat preliminary injunction phase); Noble v. Tooley, 125 F. Supp. 2d 481, 483 (M.D. \nFla. 2000) (“Defendants’ hearsay objections to these exhibits are ill-taken at this \nstage of the proceedings” since “a district court may rely” on “affidavits and hearsay \nmaterials” at “the preliminary injunction stage.”). \n3.  The Court also reasoned that the threat of lost federal funding will not \nirreparably harm Florida because it can recover any funds lost if it wins this lawsuit. \nOrder at 9–10. And it held that, in any event, there is “no evidence to suggest” that \nthe loss of federal funding will occur immediately on December 6, 2021, because \nthe “asserted loss of staff is speculative,” particularly given the “availability of the \nexemption  process  provided  in  the  interim  final  rule,”  and  because,  “even  if \nnoncompliance occurs, any potential termination of funding would not occur on \nDecember 6.” Id. at 10. These conclusions, too, are mistaken. \nAt the gate, even if Florida could recover federal funding withheld during any \nperiod of noncompliance, that would not compensate Florida for the wealth of \nservices it would be unable to provide in the interim; for the patients it would lose \nto other facilities, Aurora Chi. Lakeshore Hosp. v. Azar, 356 F. Supp. 3d 749, 759 \n8 \n \n\n(N.D. Ill. 2018), vacated on other grounds, 2019 WL 6911965 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 19, \n2019); or for the employees it must cut loose in the process, see id.  \n Indeed, with federal funding uncertain, state-run health facilities will need to \nsubstantially scale back services, decimating their capacity to care for Florida’s \ncitizens and eviscerating a large chunk of their medical revenue. See ECF No. 2-2 \n¶ 15; ECF No. 2-3 ¶¶ 14, 22. As patients search for care elsewhere, many will \nestablish relationships with new providers and are unlikely to return even if federal \nfunding renews. See Aurora Chi. Lakeshore Hosp., 356 F. Supp. 3d at 759. And \nmany state-run facilities will need to downsize their staff to weather the funding \ncrunch, e.g., ECF No. 2-3 ¶¶ 14, 22, losing valuable employees that, given the fast-\npaced healthcare market and the attractiveness of private-sector roles, predictably \nwill not come back if funding ever returns, see ECF No. 2-2 ¶ 10; ECF No. 2-6 \n¶¶ 15–16, 25. Even then, Florida will need to expend resources to facilitate the \nrestaffing process. ECF No. 2-3 ¶¶ 11, 18.  \nThese harms are irreparable. Florida cannot recover damages for these losses \nin a suit against the federal government. Odebrecht, 715 F.3d at 1289. The harms \nwill also occur, at latest, on December 6, when facilities, including Florida-owned-\nand-operated  facilities,  must  decide  between  complying  with  Florida  law  or \ncomplying with the mandate. And in reality, they will occur even earlier because \nFlorida’s facilities must arrange to be compliant with the mandate by December 6. \n9 \n \n\nIn other words, harmful service- and staffing-related decisions are being made right \nnow in anticipation of the December 6 deadline. \nAt any rate, it is far from clear that Florida may recover all financial harms \ncaused by the mandate. Florida has sued under the APA, which does not permit \nrecovery of money damages. 5 U.S.C § 702; cf. Oak Lawn Pavilion, Inc. v. HHS, \n1999 WL 1023920, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 8, 1999) (claim for unpaid Medicare \npayments after termination of Medicare contract was claim for “money damages”). \nAnd some Florida facilities, consistent with state law, would likely refuse to comply \nwith the mandate and cease billing for Medicare and Medicaid services altogether. \nWe are unaware of a mechanism under which Florida could obtain monetary relief \nfor the amounts that a facility could have billed (but did not in fact bill) even if, at \nthe end of a very long day, CMS’s unlawful rule is struck down by the courts. \nEven if Florida’s lost federal funding is recoverable, its temporary loss still \nconstitutes irreparable harm “where the loss threatens the very existence of [its \nfacilities’] business.” Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985); \nsee also GOS Operator, LLC v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 175056, at *4 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 20, \n2012) (threatened loss of Medicare/Medicaid funding constituted irreparable harm \nwhen the loss would effectively force facility to cease operating). Here, CMS has \nindicated that termination is on the table if a facility does not comply with the \nmandate, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,574, and a senior White House official has made clear \n10 \n \n\nthat CMS “will not hesitate to use [its] full enforcement authority” to ensure that its \nmandate takes effect.6 Seeing as federal money makes up the lion’s share of funding \nfor certain state facilities, e.g., ECF No. 2-3 ¶ 13–14, 21–22, even a temporary \nstoppage would be a death knell for their operations, a textbook irreparable injury, \nWis.  Gas  Co.,  758  F.2d  at  674  (“Recoverable  monetary  loss  may  constitute \nirreparable harm only where the loss threatens the very existence of the movant’s \nbusiness.”). \nLastly, it does not matter whether CMS will strip Florida’s facilities of their \nfunding when the clock strikes midnight on December 6. What matters is that, come \nDecember 6, Florida’s facilities will need to make an impossible decision: fire \nunvaccinated staff or risk defying federal law and suffering the consequences. And \nin any event, there is every reason to believe these consequences will follow swiftly. \nAfter all, CMS skipped notice and comment because its believes that the danger to \npatients is so great that it would “be contrary to the public interest to delay in \nimposing” a mandate. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,586. It is thus likely that CMS will make \n \n6 Background Press Call on OSHA and CMS Rules for Vaccination in the Workplace, The \nWhite  House  (Nov.  3,  2021),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-\nbriefings/2021/11/04/background-press-call-on-osha-and-cms-rules-for-vaccination-in-the-\nworkplace/. \n11 \n \n\ngood on its word and “will not hesitate to use [its] full enforcement authority”7 to \nensure that its mandate takes effect.8 \n4.  Finally, the Court did not address the many other irreparable harms \nFlorida will suffer because of the mandate. \nFirst, the Court did not consider the compliance costs that Florida’s facilities \nwill pay under the mandate. Indeed, “complying with a regulation later held invalid \nalmost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.” \nThunder  Basin  Coal  Co.  v.  Reich,  510  U.S.  200,  220–21  (1994)  (Scalia,  J., \nconcurring in part and in the judgment). As CMS acknowledges, the “initial costs of \nthis rule fall almost entirely on health care providers and suppliers.” 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,612; see also 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613 (recognizing that “much,” yet not all, of the \nmandate’s costs are covered by the federal government). But because the federal \ngovernment has sovereign immunity, Odebrecht, 715 F.3d at 1289, Florida will be \nunable “to recover the compliance costs [it] will incur,” even if the mandate “is \n \n7 Background Press Call on OSHA and CMS Rules for Vaccination in the Workplace, The \nWhite  House  (Nov.  3,  2021),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-\nbriefings/2021/11/04/background-press-call-on-osha-and-cms-rules-for-vaccination-in-the-\nworkplace/. \n8 In all events, though Florida requests injunctive relief before December 6 given the \ndeadline for the first vaccine dose, this Court’s injunction analysis is not tied to that date. The \nquestion for purposes of a temporary injunction is whether the irreparable harm is likely to “occur \n‘before a decision on the merits can be rendered.’” See McMahon v. City of Panama City Beach, \n180 F. Supp. 3d 1076, 1110 (N.D. Fla. 2016) (Walker, J.) (quoting Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice  and  Procedure  §  2948.1  (2d  ed.  1995)).  Given  that  CMS  is  likely  to  take  quick \nenforcement action, Florida’s stated harms are likely to occur “before a decision on the merits” of \nFlorida’s appeal “can be rendered,” even if they do not occur precisely on December 6. Id. \n12 \n \n\ninvalidated on the merits,” Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016); see also \nWis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674 (costs imposed on parties are irreparable where they \ncannot be recovered “in the ordinary course of litigation”). \nSecond, AHCA is obligated by its contract with CMS to ensure compliance \nwith the mandate. ECF No. 2-1 ¶ 5. If it refuses to comply, it will be in breach of its \ncontract with CMS and at risk of losing the contract’s multi-million-dollar value, id. \n¶ 9–11. \nThird,  Florida  suffers  irreparable  harm  as  parens  patriae  for  the  many \nFloridians who work in healthcare and do not wish to receive a vaccine, as well as \nthe  patients  who  will  lose  access  to  adequate  medical  care  because  of  CMS’s \nmandate.9 A State has a paradigmatic sovereign interest both in “the health and well-\nbeing—both physical and economic—of its residents in general” and in “assuring \nthat the benefits of the federal system are not denied to its general population.” Alfred \nL. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607–08 (1982). It \nmay assert those interests on its citizens’ behalf. See id. And the mandate irreparably \n \n9 To be sure, Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923), recognized certain limits on \nthe use of that standing theory against the federal government. But “there is a critical difference \nbetween allowing a State ‘to protect her citizens from the operation of federal statutes’ (which is \nwhat Mellon prohibits) and allowing a State to assert its rights under federal law (which it has \nstanding to do).” Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 n.17 (2007). Because Florida asserts \nseveral federal rights here—including the notice and comment and consultation guarantees—it has \nparens patriae standing. See Texas v. United States, 328 F. Supp. 3d 662, 697 (S.D. Tex. 2018); \nTexas v. United States, 2021 WL 3025857, at *14 (S.D. Tex. July 16, 2021); Aziz v. Trump, 231 \nF. Supp. 3d 23, 31–32 (E.D. Va. 2017). \n13 \n \n\ninjures those interests because it will likely cause healthcare employees to lose their \njobs, supra at 5–6, exacerbating an already dire healthcare labor shortage, ECF No. \n2-4 ¶ 12; ECF No. 2-2 ¶ 10; ECF No. 2-5 ¶ 9; ECF No. 2-6 ¶¶ 16, 31, and leaving \nFlorida’s citizens without access to vital medical care, ECF No. 2-3 ¶¶ 12, 14; see \nalso Planned Parenthood of Kan. v. Andersen, 882 F.3d 1205, 1236–37 (10th Cir. \n2018) (patients suffered irreparable harm when facilities lost Medicaid funding). It \nwill also force the States’ healthcare employees to forfeit control of their private \nmedical choices, personal information, and bodily autonomy to their employers and \nto the federal government.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should enjoin Defendants pending appeal \nfrom enforcing, implementing, or giving any effect to the mandate. \n14 \n \n\nRespectfully submitted, \nAshley Moody \nATTORNEY GENERAL \n \nJohn Guard (FBN 374600) \nCHIEF DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL \n \nJames H.

We disagree. The federal government’s authority to impose the interim rule’s vaccine \nrequirement derives from the Spending Clause. See U.S Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. When a facility, even one operated by \na State, voluntarily chooses to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and receives federal funding for \nservices provided to beneficiaries, the facility must comply with the federal law. And, as we explained above, \nCongress unambiguously conditioned the payment of funds under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to facilities \nthat comply with “health and safety standards” set by the Secretary. See Section I-A, supra. \n \n2  The dissent, like Florida, argues that the district court erred in concluding that good cause existed because the \n  Secretary waited until vaccines had been available to healthcare workers for over a year before adopting the interim \nrule. We are not convinced that this is a case where the Secretary waited so long to issue the interim rule that he \ncannot rely on the good-cause exception. This argument ignores that when the vaccines were originally made \navailable, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved them under only an emergency use authorization. \nThe FDA gave final approval to the first vaccine late August. It was within the Secretary’s discretion to wait for \napproval, indicating that the vaccines were safe and effective before requiring health care employees to receive \nthem. Rather than show a lack of good cause, this fact demonstrates appropriate caution and thought on the part of \nthe Secretary. See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,584 (noting that “[h]ealthcare workers whose hesitancy was related to [the \nemergency use authorization] status now have a fully licensed COVID-19 vaccination option”). \n \n3  Florida also argues that the district court erred because a separate federal statute required the Secretary to consult \n  with States before issuing the interim rule. In addition to the APA’s notice-and-comment requirement, federal law \nimposes another requirement before the Secretary may issue a new rule:  “the Secretary must consult with \nappropriate State agencies” when carrying out functions “relating to determination of conditions of participation by \nproviders of services.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395z. Florida has not shown that the district court erred when it concluded that \nthe Secretary satisfied the consultation requirement because States will have the opportunity to consult during the \nongoing  notice-and-comment  period,  reasoning  that  the  statute imposed  “no  temporal  requirement  for  the \nnecessary consultation to occur before an interim rule is issued.” Doc. 18 at 10. \n \n4  If the Secretary lacked the authority to issue the interim rule, then Florida might be able to establish irreparable \n  injury. \n \n5  The district court also correctly pointed out that Florida enacted its statute after the Secretary issued the interim \n  rule. The district court found that this timing “suggest[ed] an attempt to alter the status quo by creating a \nself-inflicted irreparable sovereign injury after the fact.” Doc. 18 at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n \n6  Likewise, we are not persuaded that Florida has carried its burden of showing that, absent an injunction, it will \n \n\n \n  suffer an economic injury that could not be redressed if the interim rule turns out to be invalid. See Ne. Fla. Chapter \nof Ass’n of Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 896 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir. 1990) (recognizing the “possibility \nthat adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date” weighs “heavily against a \nclaim of irreparable harm”). \n \n7  Although the dissent does not dispute that the “public has an interest in stopping the spread of COVID-19,” our \n  dissenting colleague concludes that the equities weigh in favor of a stay because of “uncertainties” related to the \nongoing pandemic. Dissent at 1314–15 (internal quotation marks omitted). The dissent points to the recent \nemergence  of  the  Omicron  variant  and  speculates  that  currently  available  vaccines  may  “offer  diminished \nprotection” against this variant. Id. at 1315 n.7. As an initial matter, this is speculation; the dissent cites nothing to \nsupport its assertion about the effectiveness of vaccines against the Omicron variant. More fundamentally, though, \nthe dissent’s position is flawed because taken to its logical end, it would mean that there would never be a public \ninterest in the federal government’s taking proactive steps to protect the public from the COVID-19 virus—or any \nother deadly virus—because of the possibility, however remote, that the virus would mutate in the future. \n \n1  See United States v. Diveroli, 729 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir. 2013) (“When an appeal is filed, ‘the district court is \n  divested of jurisdiction to take any action with regard to the matter except in aid of the appeal.’ ” (quoting \nShewchun v. United States, 797 F.2d 941, 942 (11th Cir. 1986))). \n \n2  As discussed below, Jacobson addresses a state’s power to mandate vaccination, not the federal government’s \n  power to do so. \n \n3  See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842–44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). \n   \n4  In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent \n  all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. \n \n5  The Food and Drug Administration authorized two vaccines under Emergency Use Authorization in December 2020. \n  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,584. According to CMS, the agency could have imposed a vaccine mandate for vaccines \nauthorized for Emergency Use Authorization. Id. at 61,583. \n \n6  Indeed, the healthcare staffing shortages in Florida over the last several months have been widely publicized. See \n  Florida  Healthcare  Groups  Warn  of  Growing  Workforce  Crisis,  Orlando  Sentinel  (Nov.  1,  2021,  1:47  PM), \nhttps://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-health-care-staffing-crisis-florida-20211101-iluz3jbbt5ffbp7s3juqe\ne2soe-story.html; Kirby Wilson, Florida Will Be Short Nearly 60,000 Nurses by 2035, Report Says, Tampa Bay Times \n(Sept.  30,  2021), \nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2021/09/30/florida-will-be-short-nearly-60000-nurses-by-2035-r\neport-says/ \n \n7  As to CMS’s last point, early evidence as to the Omicron variant of COVID-19, discovered in the weeks following the \n  issuance of the mandate, suggests that it is much more transmissible that the Delta variant and potentially able to \navoid the protection provided by the currently available COVID-19 vaccines. See Michaeleen Doucleff, New Evidence \nShows  Omicron  Likely  Spreads  Twice  as  Fast  as  Delta  in  South  Africa,  NPR  (Dec.  3,  2021,  5:30  PM), \nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/11/30/1059859253/why-omicron-variant-spreads-so-quickly-inf\nectious-mutations. While the relative severity of the Omicron variant remains to be seen, the possibility that current \nvaccines offer diminished protection against it raises further questions as to whether the mandate can be currently \nviewed as in the public interest. \n \n \n \n \n ",

CASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n       \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND  \nHUMAN SERVICES, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \n_________________________________/ \n \nORDER \n  Before the Court is the State of Florida’s Emergency Motion for Injunction \nPending Appeal, ECF No. 9.  The relief requested will be denied, but on partial \nreconsideration, the Court finds it appropriate to schedule an expedited evidentiary \nhearing on Florida’s request for preliminary injunctive relief.1    \n  On November 20, 2021, this Court denied Florida’s request for a Temporary \nRestraining Order (“TRO”) and Preliminary Injunction.  ECF No. 6.  Florida sought \nto restrain and enjoin the implementation of an interim final rule issued on November \n5, 2021, by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), requiring \nCOVID-19 vaccinations for all covered healthcare staff in state-run facilities that \n \n1 The Court does not reconsider its ruling denying the State of Florida’s motion for a \ntemporary restraining order. \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 13   Filed 11/27/21   Page 2 of 6\nPage 2 of 6 \n \nparticipate in Medicare and Medicaid programs, with a first vaccine dose to be \nadministered by December 6, 2021.  See Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff \nVaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61555-01 (Nov. 5, 2021) (referenced as the “interim final \nrule with comment period” or “IFC,” which is the acronym used in the rule).  The \nIFC also requires covered healthcare staff to obtain a second COVID-19 vaccination \ndose to be completed by January 4, 2022, except for those who have been granted \nan exemption or for whom vaccination must be temporarily delayed for clinical \nreasons under CDC recommendations.  Id. at 61,572-73 (noting that certain allergies, \nrecognized medical conditions, or religious beliefs, observances, or practices, may \nprovide grounds for exemption).  The undersigned denied a TRO because there was \nno showing of irreparable injury to the State of Florida to justify an immediate \ninjunction.  ECF No. 6.  More specifically, the Court found the agency heads’ \npredictions of widespread resignations were speculative and conclusory and that the \nthreatened loss of federal funding would not occur on December 6, 2021, and \nmoreover  could  be  remediated  through  this  suit  brought  pursuant  to  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  The Court also rejected as insufficient \nFlorida’s claim of sovereign injury based on legislation prohibiting COVID-19 \nmandates that the State Legislature was contemplating.   \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 13   Filed 11/27/21   Page 3 of 6\nPage 3 of 6 \n \n  Florida has now appealed the Court’s denial of a TRO and seeks an injunction \npending appeal, acknowledging that the same standard applies as for a preliminary \ninjunction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(d) (authorizing the court to suspend, modify, \nrestore, or grant an injunction when an appeal is pending from an order that either \ngrants or refuses an injunction).  This relief is discretionary and is not granted as “a \nmatter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.”  Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 433-34 (2009) (noting there is “substantial overlap” between the \ndecision  to  stay  a  judgment  and  the  factors governing  preliminary  injunction).  \nCourts considering a stay or injunction pending appeal look to: “(1) whether the \n[injunction] applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) \nwhether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in \nthe proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Id. at 426 (concluding the \ntraditional factors apply).   \n  Florida renews its prior arguments and argues that this Court failed to consider \nseveral asserted irreparable harms that justify relief.  For one, Florida argues that the \nState Legislature in fact passed a bill on November 18, 2021 (after its brief was filed \nbut  before  this  Court’s decision),  which  prohibits  private  and  public  employer \nCOVID-19 vaccination mandates.  See Fla. Stat. §§ 381.00317, 112.0441 (Nov. 18, \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 13   Filed 11/27/21   Page 4 of 6\nPage 4 of 6 \n \n2021).  Florida argues that the IFC’s “interference” by preempting this state policy \n(which was enacted after the IFC was issued) demonstrates an irreparable sovereign \ninjury by precluding Florida from enforcing its own law.  Florida argues that an \nadditional irreparable sovereign injury will occur based on the conflict between state \nand federal law that will force the Florida public health agency and facility heads to \nmake the untenable choice of deciding which law to follow and which to violate.  \nFlorida also asserts that its sovereign interests as parens patriae are implicated as it \nseeks to protect Floridians who work in healthcare and do not wish to receive a \nvaccine, as well as patients who will lose access to adequate medical care because \nof the CMS mandate.      \n  The Court acknowledges that it did not previously consider the impact of \nFlorida’s then unenacted law, but the Court will consider it now, given its passage.2  \nIn relevant part, the new Florida law prohibits public employers from imposing any \nCOVID-19 mandate on a public employee and subjects a public employer to a fine \nnot to exceed $5,000 per violation.3  Fla. Stat. § 112.0441.  In light of this law, \n \n2 Florida filed its motion claiming irreparable injury on November 17, and the state law \npassed on November 18, 2021.  Florida filed no notice to supplement the motion and never advised \nthis Court of the law’s passage.  Thus, no argument on the law as enacted was before the Court at \nthe time the prior decision was made.   \n3 Florida’s law also states that a private employer who terminates an employee for not \ncomplying with a vaccine mandate is subject to fines of up to $50,000 per violation (for an \nemployer with 100 or more employees).  See Fla. Stat. § 381.00317.  This law appears to provide \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 13   Filed 11/27/21   Page 5 of 6\nPage 5 of 6 \n \nsovereign interests are implicated, most notably a concern that the new state law \ncreates a conflict that forces state-run agency and facility heads to make a decision \nby December 6 as to which law to follow, which could give rise to an irreparable \nsovereign injury.  Therefore, the Court will hold a hearing on the matter in advance \nof December 6, out of an abundance of caution.4   \n  Accordingly, Florida’s Emergency Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal, \nECF No. 9, is DENIED.  However, the Court sua sponte reinstates Florida’s request \nfor a preliminary injunction, as stated in its Complaint, ECF No. 1, and its previously \nfiled motion, ECF No. 2, and requires a written response from the Defendants by \n \nfor a wider range of exemptions than allowed under federal law (i.e., requiring exemptions for \nmedical reasons, religious reasons, COVID-19 immunity, agreeing to undergo periodic testing, \nand use of employer-provided personal protective equipment).   \n4 To clarify, the Court’s prior order denying a TRO and a preliminary injunction was \nintended to address only the TRO and should have indicated it was deferring on the preliminary \ninjunction.  That said, the Court did in fact consider and reject those arguments that were clearly \npresented to the Court previously, concluding that the affidavits presented did not justify entry of \na TRO.  The Court is not revisiting the TRO decision and is not granting an injunction pending \nappeal, which may be sought in the Eleventh Circuit, as Florida indicates it will do.  However, for \nall practical purposes, the Court is holding an evidentiary hearing on the request for a preliminary \ninjunction prior to December 6 in order to adequately address the new law and to hear all of \nFlorida’s arguments and evidence pertaining to a preliminary injunction.  This should not be \nconstrued as an indication that the decision will necessarily change, but because Florida argues \nirreparable harm could occur before the Court can address the merits of the case if widespread \nresignations interrupt the state-run facilities’ ability to provide necessary services or if federal \nfunding is withdrawn before then, the Court will hear all evidence.  See McMahon v. City of \nPanama City Beach, 180 F. Supp. 3d 1076, 1110 (N.D. Fla. 2016) (noting the question of \nirreparable harm for purposes of a preliminary injunction is whether it is “likely” to occur “before \na decision on the merits can be rendered” (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. \n7, 22) (2008)).  The Court anticipates reaching a decision before the December 6 deadline. \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 13   Filed 11/27/21   Page 6 of 6\nPage 6 of 6 \n \nnoon (C.T.) on Tuesday, November 30, 2021.

Case No. 3:21-cv-2722 \n \nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND  \nHUMAN SERVICES; XAVIER  \nBECERRA, in his official capacity as  \nSecretary of the Department of Health  \nand Human Services; The UNITED  \nSTATES OF AMERICA; CHIQUITA  \nBROOKS-LASURE, in her official \ncapacity as Administrator of the Centers  \nfor Medicare and Medicaid; THE \nCENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND  \nMEDICAID,       \n \n  Defendants. \n_________________________________/ \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING  \nORDER, PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT  \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  Many American workers were able to stay home at the peak of the \npandemic. But our healthcare workers were on the front lines, risking their lives to \nkeep us safe. Working conditions were tough, exacerbating an already worsening \nstaffing shortage.  \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 2 of 36\n2.  While these same workers continue to bravely discharge their duties, \nPresident Biden is now telling over 10 million of them that they must get vaccinated \nor lose their jobs. In his words, any resistance to this mandate—even by those with \nnatural immunity—is claiming the “freedom to kill [others] with [their] COVID.”1 \n3.  This action is unprecedented. As the federal government concedes, it \nhas “not previously required” mandatory vaccination for the healthcare industry. See \nMedicare  and  Medicaid  Programs:  Omnibus  COVID-19  Health  Care  Staff \nVaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021) (the mandate). In fact, the federal \ngovernment has “not previously required” mandatory vaccination for any private \nindustry. Just months ago, the Biden Administration made clear that mandating \nvaccines is “not the role of the federal government.”2  \n4.  It is also reckless. The healthcare industry is in the throes of what “some \nare calling the worst U.S. health-care labor crisis in memory.”3 Indeed, pandemic-\nrelated burnout has created critical staffing shortages nationwide. Compounding the \nproblem, many healthcare employees do not want to take the COVID-19 vaccine, \nparticularly in small, rural areas already short on personnel. Combined, these factors \n \n1  CNN  Presidential  Town  Hall  With  President  Joe  Biden,  CNN  (Oct.  21,  2021), \nhttps://transcripts.cnn.com/show/se/date/2021-10-21/segment/01. \n2 Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, July 23, 2021, The White House (July 23, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/23/press-briefing-by-press-\nsecretary-jen-psaki-july-23-2021/. \n3 Carey Goldberg & Jonathan Levin, Vaccine Mandates Hit Amid Historic Health-Care Staff \nShortage,  Bloomberg  (Oct.  2,  2021),  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-\n02/vaccine-mandates-hit-amid-historic-health-care-staff-shortage. \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 3 of 36\nhave created a powder keg, and healthcare officials fear a vaccine mandate could \nspark an exodus of workers from the industry. Given these severe conditions, even \na minor loss of staff could have a “disastrous impact” on patient care.4 \n5.  Against this backdrop, the federal government previously determined \nthat  less-intrusive  safety  regulations  were  appropriate  to  combat  the  spread  of \nCOVID-19 in healthcare facilities. E.g., Medicare and Medicaid Programs; COVID-\n19 Vaccine Requirements for Long-Term Care (LTC) Facilities and Intermediate \nCare Facilities for Individuals With Intellectual Disabilities (ICFs-IID) Residents, \nClients, and Staff, 86 Fed. Reg. 26,306 (May 13, 2021); Occupational Exposure to \nCOVID-19; Emergency Temporary Standard, 86 Fed. Reg. 32,376 (June 21, 2021).  \n6.  But as healthcare workers grappled with the deeply personal decision \nof whether to take a vaccine, President Biden’s “patience . . .w[ore] thin,” and he \ngrew “ang[ry] at those who haven’t gotten vaccinated.”5 Unwilling to wait any \nlonger, on September 9, 2021, President Biden announced several administrative \nactions aimed at mandating vaccines, which together affect roughly 100 million \nAmericans.6  \n \n4 Health care group worried vaccine mandate will impact Missouri nursing homes, Fox 2 Now \n(Nov.  5,  2021),  https://fox2now.com/news/health-care-group-worried-vaccine-mandate-will-\nimpact-missouri-nursing-homes/. \n5 Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic, The White House (Sept. 9, \n2021),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/. \n6 Id. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 4 of 36\n7.  As  relevant  here,  he  announced  that  the  Department  of  Health  & \nHuman Services (HHS) would issue a rule requiring vaccination for all employees \nworking in Medicare- or Medicaid-participating facilities.7 On November 5, 2021, \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), an HHS component, did so. See 86 \nFed. Reg. at 61,555. \n8.  In  its  effort  to  fast-track  the  President’s  agenda,  however,  CMS \nexceeded its statutory authority and flouted key procedural safeguards that Congress \nenacted to protect the public from hasty and reactive decision-making.  \n9.  To start, CMS lacks the power to issue an industry-wide vaccination \nmandate. The statutes it relies on do not provide it such sweeping authority. In fact, \nCMS is forbidden from exerting this level of control over the healthcare industry. \nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1395.  \n10.  Lack of authority aside, CMS also failed to fulfill its statutory duty “to \nconsult with appropriate State agencies” in developing the mandate, see 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395z—a grievous dereliction of duty given that CMS has never before mandated \nvaccination and thus lacks an understanding of how its mandate will affect the States. \n11.  Making  matters  worse,  CMS  sidestepped  the  notice  and  comment \nprocess set out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U.S.C. § 553. And \n \n7 Biden-Harris Administration to Expand Vaccination Requirements for Health Care Settings, \nCMS (Sept. 9, 2021), https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-\nexpand-vaccination-requirements-health-care-settings. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 5 of 36\nthough  it  claims  “good  cause”  to  do  so,  see  id.  §  553(b)(B),  its  primary \njustifications—the two-year-old COVID-19 pandemic and the Delta variant—do not \nsatisfy the exceedingly high and exceptional “good cause” standard.  \n12.  On top of all this, CMS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the \nmandate. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). It fails to adequately consider the viability of \nless-intrusive measures like testing, the harmful effects the mandate will have on the \nhealthcare  staffing  crisis  and  vaccine-education  efforts,  the  effects  of  natural \nimmunity  and  new  COVID-19  treatments,  the  reliance  interests  of  healthcare \nemployers and employees, and the incongruence between its vaccine requirement \nand its stated goal of protecting patients and staff. It also fails to connect the statistics \ndriving its mandate with most of the facilities covered by it or to sufficiently justify \nits extreme departure from the federal government’s prior practices.  \n13.  Finally, the mandate violates the Spending Clause—which requires that \nconditions  on  federal  funds  be  unambiguous—by  changing  the  terms  of  an \nagreement Florida has with the federal government midstream and without notice. \n14.  Because CMS’s rushed and unlawful mandate threatens to defund the \nState’s medical facilities, bleed them of vital staff,  hamper the quality of their \nmedical care, and harm both Florida’s economy and the health of its citizens, Florida \nseeks immediate relief from this Court.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 6 of 36\nPARTIES \n15.  Plaintiff State of Florida is a sovereign State and has the authority and \nresponsibility to protect its public fisc and the health, safety, and welfare of its \ncitizens. It is also the operator of medical-service providers that receive Medicare or \nMedicaid  funding.  And  its  health  agency—the  Agency  for  Health  Care \nAdministration (AHCA)—administers Florida’s Medicaid plan and assists CMS in \nregulating facilities that participate in Medicare. \n16.  Defendants are the United States, appointed officials of the United \nStates government, and United States governmental agencies responsible for the \nissuance and implementation of the challenged administrative actions. \n17.  Florida sues Defendant the United States of America under 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702–703 and 28 U.S.C. § 1346. \n18.  Defendant CMS issued the mandate and is a component of HHS. \n19.  Defendant Chiquita Brooks-LaSure is the Administrator of CMS. She \nis sued in her official capacity. \n20.  Defendant HHS oversees CMS.  \n21.  Defendant Xavier Becerra is the Secretary of HHS. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 7 of 36\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22.  The  Court  has  subject  matter  jurisdiction  pursuant  to \n28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1346, 1361 and 5 U.S.C. §§ 702–03. \n23.  The  Court  is  authorized  to  award  the  requested  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. § 706, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361, 2201–02, the Constitution, \nand the Court’s equitable powers. \n24.  Venue lies in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because \nthe State of Florida is a resident of every judicial district in its sovereign territory, \nincluding this judicial district (and division). See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, \n570 (9th Cir. 2018).8 And because medical facilities receive Medicare and Medicaid \nfunding in this district and division, a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to Florida’s claims occurred here. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Medicare and Medicaid Schemes \n25.  Medicare and Medicaid are federal programs that pay medical expenses \nfor certain individuals.  \n \n8 Accord Alabama v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 382 F. Supp. 2d 1301, 1329 (N.D. Ala. 2005); \nsee also Atlanta & F.R. Co. v. W. Ry. Co. of Ala., 50 F. 790, 791 (5th Cir. 1892) (explaining that \n“the state government . . . resides at every point within the boundaries of the state”). \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 8 of 36\n26.  Medicare  is  an  insurance  program.9  It  provides  health-insurance \ncoverage to individuals who are at least 65-years-old and are entitled to monthly \nSocial Security benefits, and to disabled individuals who meet certain requirements. \n42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq. CMS administers the program on behalf of the Secretary of \nHHS. See Pharm. Rsch. & Mfrs. of Am. v. Walsh, 538 U.S. 644, 651 n.3 (2003). \n27.  Medicaid is an assistance program.10 It pays medical bills for low-\nincome individuals. 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. It is “the primary federal program for \nproviding medical care to indigents at public expense.” Mem’l Hosp. v. Maricopa \nCnty., 415 U.S. 250, 262 n.19 (1974). The program is administered jointly by the \nStates and the federal government through a “contract[ual]” relationship. NFIB v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 577 (2012). Federal funds are distributed to qualifying \nStates, which administer their Medicaid programs pursuant to federal requirements.  \n28.  To be eligible to receive payments from either Medicare or Medicaid, \nparticipating medical-care providers must enter into agreements with the federal \ngovernment or the administering State in which they agree to comply with federally \nimposed  conditions  of  participation,  coverage,  or  certification.  E.g.,  42  U.S.C. \n \n9  What  is  the  difference  between  Medicare  and  Medicaid,  HHS, \nhttps://www.hhs.gov/answers/medicare-and-medicaid/what-is-the-difference-between-medicare-\nmedicaid/index.html. \n10 Id. \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 9 of 36\n§§ 1395cc(b)(2), 1396a(a)(33)(B). Some requirements are created by statute. E.g., \n42 U.S.C. § 1395x. Others are created by CMS regulations. E.g., 42 C.F.R. part 482. \n29.

Florida  is  no  exception—AHCA  surveys \nparticipating providers on behalf of CMS. \nCurrent State of the Healthcare Industry \n30.  The COVID-19 pandemic has placed tremendous strain on the nation’s \nhealthcare industry, creating perhaps the “worst U.S. health-care labor crisis in \nmemory.”11 As of October 1, 2021, about 16% of U.S. hospitals had “critical staffing \nshortages.”12 In some places, as many as 25% of beds are going unfilled because the \nfacilities lack adequate staffing.13 And rural areas are bearing a disproportionate \nshare of the burden, making up 60% of staffing shortages nationwide14 despite \nserving less than 20% of the population.15 \n \n11 Carey Goldberg & Jonathan Levin, Vaccine Mandates Hit Amid Historic Health-Care Staff \nShortage,  Bloomberg  (Oct.  2,  2021),  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-\n02/vaccine-mandates-hit-amid-historic-health-care-staff-shortage. \n12 Id. \n13 Id. \n14 Aallyah Wright, Rural Hospitals Can’t Find the Nurses They Need to Fight COVID, Stateline \n(Sept.  1,  2021),  https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-\nanalysis/blogs/stateline/2021/09/01/rural-hospitals-cant-find-the-nurses-they-need-to-fight-covid. \n15 Rural Report: Challenges Facing Rural Communities and the Roadmap to Ensure Local Access \nto  High-quality,  Affordable  Care,  American  Hospital  Association  at  2, \nhttps://www.aha.org/system/files/2019-02/rural-report-2019.pdf. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 10 of 36\n31.  A chief driver of the crisis is employee burnout, which has reached \n“epidemic proportions.”16 In one study, “[a]n overwhelming 55% of frontline-health \ncare workers reported burnout (defined as mental and physical exhaustion from \nchronic workplace stress).”17 Almost 30% have considered “leaving the medical \nfield” altogether,18 and over 500,000 have done so already.19 \n32.  Another  driver  is  money.  Drawn  by  lucrative  salary  raises—some \napproaching 800%—many healthcare workers have left in-house staffs for contract \nstaffing agencies.20 Depleted by these losses, healthcare providers have been forced \nto turn to these very agencies to fill their staffing gaps, paying “well above normal” \nfor their services.21 This staffing arms race has hit healthcare providers across the \nboard,22 but it has been especially difficult for small rural hospitals that cannot afford \n \n16  Dharam  Kaushik,  Medical  burnout:  Breaking  bad,  AAMC  (June  4,  2021), \nhttps://www.aamc.org/news-insights/medical-burnout-breaking-bad. \n17 Id. \n18 Id. \n19 Mallory Hackett, Healthcare lost 17,500 jobs in September amid ongoing labor shortage, \nHealthcare Finance (Oct. 11, 2021), https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-\nlost-17500-jobs-september-amid-ongoing-labor-shortage. \n20 Leticia Miranda, Rural hospitals losing hundreds of staff to high-paid traveling nurse jobs, NBC \nNews (Sept. 15, 2021), https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/rural-hospitals-losing-\nhundreds-staff-high-paid-traveling-nurse-jobs-n1279199. \n21 Bertha Coombs, Regulations slow urgent hiring of doctors and nurses amid coronavirus \noutbreak,  staffing  firms  say,  CNBC  (Mar.  28,  2020), \nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-regulations-slow-hiring-of-doctors-and-nurses-\nstaffing-firms-say.html. \n22 Hospitals and Health Systems Face Unprecedented Financial Pressures Due to COVID-19, \nAmerican  Hospital  Association  (May  2020),  https://www.aha.org/guidesreports/2020-05-05-\nhospitals-and-health-systems-face-unprecedented-financial-pressures-due. \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 11 of 36\nto pay inflated contract staffing rates or increase salaries to keep their employees in-\nhouse.23  \n33.  Florida has not been immune to this staffing emergency.

Compounding  the  staffing  crisis,  many  healthcare  workers,  both \nnationally  and  in  Florida,  do  not  want  to  receive  the  COVID-19  vaccine.  A \nnationwide survey found that 25% of nurses had personal concerns about taking the \nvaccine.26 In Florida, data published just a few months ago found that between 40–\n50% of hospital employees had not been vaccinated.27 And in rural areas—which \n \n23 Leticia Miranda, Rural hospitals losing hundreds of staff to high-paid traveling nurse jobs (Sept. \n15,  2021),  https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/rural-hospitals-losing-hundreds-\nstaff-high-paid-traveling-nurse-jobs-n1279199. \n24 Jake Stofan,  Health care industry asking  Florida  lawmakers  to  address  chronic staffing \nshortages,  WFLA  (Nov.  1,  2021),  https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/health-care-industry-\nasking-florida-lawmakers-to-address-chronic-staffing-shortages/. \n25 Id. \n26 Christopher O’Donnell, Tampa Bay hospitals push COVID vaccine – but won’t mandate it for \ntheir  workers,  Tampa  Bay  Times  (Sept.  3,  2021), \nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/09/03/tampa-bay-hospitals-push-covid-shot-but-\nwont-mandate-it-for-their-workers/. \n27 Liz Crawford, AHCA: 42% of Florida hospital workers weren’t vaccinated, as of June 4, WTSP \n(July 22, 2021), https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/vaccine/hospital-workers-\nnot-vaccinated/67-9e842ff1-e5b0-4f1f-8f9f-ccfec865ccbf;  David  Bauerlein,  UF  Health \nJacksonville finding widespread vaccine hesitancy among its own staff, Jacksonville.com (July 23, \n2021),  https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/2021/07/23/uf-health-ceo-says-overcoming-\nvaccine-hesitancy-challenge-among-staff/8075987002/. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 12 of 36\nhave the most “dire” staffing shortages of all28—the statistics are even bleaker. One \nstudy found that in 30% of rural hospitals nationwide, less than half of the staff have \nreceived a COVID-19 vaccine.29  \n35.  This  confluence  of  factors  has  left  many  healthcare  administrators \nworried that a vaccine mandate could push the industry over the edge. They fear \n“many employees [will] quit rather than comply”—a “huge concern” given current \nstaffing deficiencies.30 The concern is not merely speculative: In some places, triple-\ndigit numbers of workers have resigned or been fired for refusing to take a vaccine.31 \nOne Florida-based administrator estimates that a mandate would cause him to “lose \n10 to 15 percent of [his] staff.”32 But this estimate is on the low end: A recent survey \nfound that 37% of unvaccinated workers would leave their jobs if their employers \n \n28 Aallyah Wright, Rural Hospitals Can’t Find the Nurses They Need to Fight COVID, Stateline \n(Sept.  1,  2021),  https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-\nanalysis/blogs/stateline/2021/09/01/rural-hospitals-cant-find-the-nurses-they-need-to-fight-covid. \n29 Tamara Keith, Why Lagging COVID Vaccine Rate At Rural Hospitals ‘Needs To Be Fixed Now’, \nNPR  (May  4,  2021),  https://www.npr.org/2021/05/04/993270974/why-lagging-covid-vaccine-\nrate-at-rural-hospitals-needs-to-be-fixed-now. \n30 Christopher O’Donnell, Tampa Bay hospitals push COVID vaccine – but won’t mandate it for \ntheir  workers,  Tampa  Bay  Times  (Sept.  3,  2021), \nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2021/09/03/tampa-bay-hospitals-push-covid-shot-but-\nwont-mandate-it-for-their-workers/. \n31 Dan Diamond, 153 people resigned or were fired from a Texas hospital system after refusing to \nget  vaccinated,  The  Washington  Post  (June  22,  2021), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/06/22/houston-methodist-loses-153-employees-\nvaccine-mandate/. \n32 Hannah Mitchell, ‘Like hand-to-hand combat’: Florida health system battles vaccine hesitancy \n1  employee  at  a  time,  Becker’s  Hospital  Review  (Nov.  4,  2021), \nhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/like-hand-to-hand-\ncombat-florida-health-system-battles-vaccine-hesitancy-1-employee-at-a-time.html. \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 13 of 36\nmandated vaccination or weekly testing.33 And if mandatory vaccination is the only \noption, 72% say they will quit.34 \n36.  Employee flight does not just hamper the healthcare industry’s capacity \nto fight COVID-19, but to address other healthcare risks as well. As the CEO of one \nFlorida health system put it: “If today I said, ‘everybody’s required to take the \nvaccine or you’re terminated,’ then I have a problem being able to take care of people \nwho show up to our ER with strokes, or chest pains, or medical admissions or \nsurgical admissions.”35 And as CMS concedes, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,612, given the \nalready-severe staffing shortage in the healthcare industry, “[e]ven a small fraction \nof”  so-called  “recalcitrant  unvaccinated  employees”  could  “disrupt  facility \noperations,” id., and have a “disastrous impact” on patient care.36 \n37.  To be sure, encouraging vaccination of healthcare workers is good \npolicy. Indeed, such measures have proven effective in Florida. To cite one example, \n \n33 Liz Hamel et al., KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor: October 2021, KFF (Oct. 28, 2021), \nhttps://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-october-\n2021/. \n34 Id. \n35 Jacqueline LaPointe, Hospitals Staffing Shortages a Concerns with Mandatory Vaccinations, \nRevcycle Intelligence (July 26, 2021), https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/hospital-staffing-\nshortages-a-concern-with-mandatory-vaccinations. \n36 Health care group worried vaccine mandate will impact Missouri nursing homes, Fox 2 Now \n(Nov.  5,  2021),  https://fox2now.com/news/health-care-group-worried-vaccine-mandate-will-\nimpact-missouri-nursing-homes/. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 14 of 36\na healthcare system raised staff vaccination rates by 10% through vaccination-\neducation strategies.37  \n38.  Mandates, however, are another matter altogether. In addition to the \nissues already discussed, they may even “chill” individuals who might otherwise \ntake the vaccine voluntarily.38 \nThe Federal Government’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \n39.  In January 2020, HHS declared the COVID-19 pandemic a public \nhealth emergency. Though public health emergency designations naturally expire \nafter 90 days, 42 U.S.C. § 247d, HHS has renewed the designation each time it was \nset to expire.39 \n40.  Almost a year ago, in December 2020, COVID-19 vaccines began to \nbecome available to the general public. On December 11, 2020, the Food & Drug \nAdministration (FDA) authorized the emergency use of the two-dose Pfizer-Biotech \nvaccine. A week later, FDA did the same for the two-dose Moderna vaccine.

Despite  these  authorizations  and  the  longstanding  public  health \nemergency  declaration,  the  federal  government  never  sought  to  mandate \nvaccinations to fight COVID-19 in any sector, let alone the healthcare sector. Rather, \nit opted for less-intrusive measures. In May 2021, for instance, CMS issued an \ninterim final rule (IFR) that required long term care facilities and intermediate care \nfacilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities to educate staff and residents \nabout the vaccine and make the vaccine available to them. 86 Fed. Reg. at 26,306 \n(May IFR). This, in CMS’s view, was “necessary to help protect the health and \nsafety” of residents. Id. Mandatory vaccination, however, was not required.  \n42.  Similarly,  in  June  2021,  the  Occupational  Health  and  Safety \nAdministration (OSHA) issued a COVID-19 Healthcare Emergency Temporary \nStandard  (ETS),  which  aimed  to  protect  healthcare  workers  from  occupational \nexposure to COVID-19. 86 Fed. Reg. at 32,376 (June ETS). Under the June ETS—\nwhich remains in effect—covered healthcare employers must implement measures \nlike transmission-based precautions, personal protective equipment, and physical \n \n40  Carl  Zimmer  et  al.,  Coronavirus  Vaccine  Tracker,  The  New  York  Times, \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html. \n41 Maggie Fox, Some Americans should start getting the first Covid-19 vaccine today.

But like CMS’s \nMay IFR, the June ETS did not mandate vaccination. \nThe Biden Administration’s Actions \n43.  Despite pushing the envelope in numerous ways during the COVID-19 \npandemic, e.g., Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. HHS, 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2486 (2021); Florida \nv. Becerra, 8:21-cv-839, 2021 WL 2514138 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2021), the Biden \nAdministration at first drew a hard line on vaccine mandates: In its view, mandating \nvaccines was “not the role of the federal government.”42  \n44.  Not long after, though, the President’s “patience” with the unvaccinated \n“w[ore] thin,” prompting him to announce three new administrative actions aimed \nat compelling much, if not most, of the adult population in the United States to \nreceive a COVID-19 vaccine.43 \n45.  First, the President announced that he would issue an executive order \nrequiring all executive branch employees and federal contractors to be vaccinated.44 \n \n42 Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, July 23, 2021, The White House (July 23, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/23/press-briefing-by-press-\nsecretary-jen-psaki-july-23-2021/. \n43 Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic, The White House (Sept. 9, \n2021),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/. \n44 Id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 17 of 36\n46.  Second, the President announced that the Department of Labor would \ndevelop an emergency rule mandating that private employers with 100 or more \nemployees require their employees to become fully vaccinated or submit to weekly \ntesting.45 \n47.  Finally,  as  relevant  here,  the  President  announced  that  the  federal \ngovernment would publish a rule mandating vaccines for employees who work at \nhealthcare facilities that accept Medicare and Medicaid.46 Even though he stated a \nmonth  earlier  that  HHS  would  only  require  nursing  homes  to  vaccinate  their \nemployees,47 he expanded this mandate, announcing that the rule would require all \nparticipating facilities to have their employees vaccinated.48 \nThe Mandate \n48.  CMS published that regulation—the mandate—on November 5, 2021. \n86 Fed.

The mandate directs participating facilities49 to ensure that covered \nemployees50 submit to COVID-19 vaccination, unless the employees are eligible for \na religious or medical exemption. Id. at 61,572. \n50.  The  mandate  deploys  “a  common  set  of  provisions  for  each” \nparticipating  facility;  there  are  “no  substantive  regulatory  differences  across \nsettings.” Id. at 61,570. \n51.  It operates in two phases. Phase 1 requires that covered employees \nreceive either the first dose of a two-dose vaccine or the sole dose of a single-dose \nvaccine by December 6, 2021. Id. at 61,573. Phase 2 requires that covered employees \nreceive the second dose of a two-dose vaccine by January 4, 2022. Id. \n52.  To comply with the mandate, a participating facility must implement a \n“process for tracking and securely documenting the COVID-19 vaccination status \n \n49 Participating facilities subject to the mandate include: ambulatory surgical centers; hospices; \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities; programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly; hospitals; \nlong term care facilities, including skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities, generally \nreferred  to  as  nursing  homes;  intermediate  care  facilities  for  individuals  with  intellectual \ndisabilities;  home  health  agencies;  comprehensive  outpatient  rehabilitation  facilities;  critical \naccess  hospitals; clinics, rehabilitation agencies, and public health agencies as providers of \noutpatient physical therapy and speech-language pathology services; community mental health \ncenters; home infusion therapy suppliers; rural health clinics/federally qualified health centers; and \nend-stage renal disease facilities. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569–70. \n50 Covered employees subject to the mandate include: facility employees; licensed practitioners; \nstudents, trainees, and volunteers; and individuals who provide care, treatment, or other services \nfor the facility and/or its patients, under contract or other arrangement. 86 Fed. Reg. 61,570. The \nrequirements also extend to staff who provide care outside of a formal clinical setting and to “any \nindividual that performs their duties at any site of care, or has the potential to have contact with \nanyone at the site of care.” Id. at 61,570–71. Employees working 100% remotely are exempt.

It must \nalso “track[] and securely document[]” all exemptions. Id. § 416.51(c)(3)(vi)–(vii). \nAnd it must implement “[c]ontingency plans” for all persons who are “not fully \nvaccinated.” Id. § 416.51(c)(3)(x).  \n53.  As for enforcement, CMS intends to issue “interpretive guidelines” that \noutline “enforcement remedies” CMS can pursue against participating facilities that \ndo not comply. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,574. These will include “civil money penalties, \ndenial of payments for new admissions, or termination of the Medicare/Medicaid \nprovider agreement.” Id. A senior White House official has made clear that CMS \n“will not hesitate to use [its] full enforcement authority” to carry out the mandate.51 \n54.  CMS,  however,  does  not  intend  to  enforce  the  mandate  alone—it \nexpects the States to help. Consistent with their contracts with CMS, see 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395aa(a), States must verify that healthcare facilities operating in their borders \ncomply with the mandate. CMS plans to “advise and train State surveyors on how \nto assess compliance with the new requirements” and how to review “the entity’s \nrecords of staff vaccinations.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,574. It will also “instruct surveyors \n \n51 Background Press Call on OSHA and CMS Rules for Vaccination in the Workplace, The White \nHouse  (Nov.  3,  2021),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-\nbriefings/2021/11/04/background-press-call-on-osha-and-cms-rules-for-vaccination-in-the-\nworkplace/. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 20 of 36\nto conduct interviews staff [sic] to verify their vaccination status,” and will tell \nsurveyors how they “should cite” facilities “when noncompliance is identified.” Id.  \n55.  CMS “expect[s]” its vaccine mandate “to remain relevant for some time \nbeyond the end” of the declared public health emergency and anticipates retaining \nthe mandate “as a permanent requirement for facilities.” Id. at 61,574. \n56.  The  mandate  has  “near-universal  applicability”  to  healthcare  staff, \ncovering  an  estimated  10.3  million  employees.  Id.  at  61,603.  By  CMS’s  own \nestimate, about 2.4 million of these employees are unvaccinated. Id. at 61,607. And, \nas  CMS  concedes,  the  mandate’s  chief  aim  is  to  coerce  these  unvaccinated \nemployees to submit to vaccination upon pain of unemployment. See id. (“The most \nimportant inducement will be the fear of job loss, coupled with the examples set by \nfellow  vaccine-hesitant  workers  who  are  accepting  vaccination  more  or  less \nsimultaneously”); id. at 61,608 (“[I]t is possible there may be disruptions in cases \nwhere substantial numbers of health care staff refuse vaccination and are not granted \nexemptions and are terminated, with consequences for employers, employees, and \npatients.”).  \nCMS’s Failure to Consult or Engage in Notice and Comment \n57.  CMS concedes that this is new ground for the agency. By its own \nadmission, it has “not previously required” mandatory vaccinations as a condition \nfor  participation  in  Medicare  or  Medicaid.  Id.  at  61,567.  In  fact,  the  federal \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 21 of 36\ngovernment  has  never  required  any  private  industry  to  submit  to  mandatory \nvaccination.  \n58.  Despite this marked departure from prior practice, though, CMS did not \n“consult” with “appropriate State agencies” before issuing its Mandate, as it is \nrequired  to  do  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1395z.  Id.  at  61,567.  In  CMS’s  view,  the \nconsultation statute does not require that it consult before publishing a rule. Id. And \neven if it did, says CMS, there is no agency with which it would be “appropriate” to \nconsult before publishing the rule “[g]iven the urgent need” for a mandate here. Id. \n59.  Similarly, CMS did not engage with interested stakeholders through the \nnotice and comment process. Id. at 61,583 (citing 5 U.S.C § 553(b); 42 U.S.C \n§ 1395hh(b)(1)). Instead, it found for “good cause” that it would “be impracticable \nand contrary to the public interest . . . to undertake normal notice and comment \nprocedures.”  Id.  at  61,586.  It  supported  its  good-cause  determination  based \nprimarily on the COVID-19 pandemic, the Delta variant, and the upcoming flu \nseason. See id. at 61,583–84. \nCMS’s Justifications for the Mandate \n60.  In justifying its mandate, CMS offers internally inconsistent reasoning \nand fails to adequately consider data that undermined its decision. \n61.  To start, CMS claims to consider “concerns about health care workers \nchoosing to leave their jobs rather than be vaccinated,” yet it ultimately finds that \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 22 of 36\nthe mandate was justified given that there is “insufficient evidence to quantify and \ncompare adverse impacts on patient and resident care associated with temporary \nstaffing losses due to mandates and absences due to quarantine for known COVID-\n19 exposures and illness.” Id. at 61,569.  \n62.  This lack of data, however, is not cause to issue  an industry-wide \nmandate; it is cause to exercise restraint in issuing such a mandate.  \n63.  As CMS concedes, there “might be a certain number of health care \nworkers who choose” to leave the medical field because of the mandate. Id. at \n61,569. And because it is “unknown . . . how rapidly those quitting rather than being \nvaccinated could be replaced,” id. at 61,612, CMS admits that current “endemic staff \nshortages . . . may  be made  worse  if  any  substantial  number  of  unvaccinated \nemployees leave health care employment altogether,” id. at 61,607. Indeed, given \nthe  already  “critical  staffing  shortage,”  id.  at  61,559,  CMS  acknowledges  that \nworker resignations need not even be substantial to do damage: If “[e]ven a small \nfraction of” those CMS pejoratively labels “recalcitrant unvaccinated employees” \nquit, it “could disrupt facility operations.” Id. at 61,612. In some cases, this impact \nwill be “disastrous,”52 especially in rural areas, which, as CMS admits, are “having \ngreater problems with employee vaccination.” Id. at 61,613. \n \n52 Health care group worried vaccine mandate will impact Missouri nursing homes, Fox 2 Now \n(Nov.  5,  2021),  https://fox2now.com/news/health-care-group-worried-vaccine-mandate-will-\nimpact-missouri-nursing-homes/. \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 23 of 36\n64.  Along with this, CMS recognizes that the “providers and suppliers \nregulated under this rule are diverse in nature, management structure, and size.” Id. \nat 61,602. Even so, CMS relies mostly on facts and figures involving long term care \nfacilities—providers  who  serve  mostly elderly  and  often  immunocompromised \npatients—to justify applying the mandate to other Medicare- and Medicaid-certified \nproviders. See, e.g., id. at 61,585 (discussing “case rates among [long term care] \nfacility residents,” and claiming, without citation that those facilities’ “experience may \ngenerally be extrapolated to other settings”). CMS does so despite conceding that \n“[a]ge remains a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes,” id. at 61,566, \nand that “risk of death from infection from an unvaccinated 75- to 84-year-old person \nis 320 times more likely than the risk for an 18- to 29-years old person,” id. at 61,610 \nn.247. \n65.  CMS also claims to have “considered requiring daily or weekly testing \nof unvaccinated individuals” instead of mandatory vaccination. Id. at 61,614. But it \nrejects this alternative in about a sentence, concluding that vaccination is a “more \neffective  infection  control  measure.”  Id.  OSHA,  by  contrast,  issued  a  vaccine \nmandate on the same day that includes a weekly testing alternative. See COVID-19 \nVaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary Standard, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,402, \n61,450 (Nov. 5, 2021). Indeed, despite concluding that testing is “not as effective as \nvaccination,” OSHA permitted testing because it is “still effective” and because \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 24 of 36\nOSHA  had  concerns  about  imposing  a  “strict  vaccination  mandate  with  no \nalternative” on such short notice given the potential “economic and health impacts” \nof such a decision.53 Id. at 61,433, 61,436. \n66.  CMS  further  “considered whether it  would be  appropriate  to  limit \nCOVID-19 vaccination requirements to staff who have not previously been infected \nby SARS-CoV-2.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614. Yet it decides against that option because \nit does not think that “natural immunity” is “equivalent to receiving the COVID-19 \nvaccine.” Id. at 61,559. Elsewhere, however, CMS recognizes the value of natural \nimmunity  when  it  states  that  each  day  100,000  people  are  “recover[ing]  from \ninfection,” that they “are no longer sources of future infections,” and that their natural \nimmunity “reduce[s] the risk to both health care staff and patients substantially.” Id. \nat 61,604 (emphasis added). And indeed, a highly reported study from Israel found \nthat “natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection” against the \nDelta variant than vaccination.54 \n67.  CMS  claims  that  the  mandate  is  needed  to  protect  patients  from \nCOVID-19  infection,  yet  it  does  not  require  that  patients  be  vaccinated  and \n \n53 OSHA also could not establish a “grave danger” to most healthcare workers because it found \nthat its June ETS adequately protects against COVID-19 risk. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,421. CMS does \nnot acknowledge this finding. \n54 See Sivan Gazit et al., Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity: \nreinfections  versus  breakthrough  infections,  medRxiv  (Aug.  24,  2021), \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 25 of 36\nrecognizes that “the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease transmission by \nthose vaccinated [is] not currently known.” Id. at 61,615. \nIrreparable Harm to Florida \n68.  The mandate places Florida in an untenable position. On the one hand, \nif Florida refuses to comply with the mandate, its state-run facilities that participate \nin Medicare and Medicaid will be subject to fines and lose millions of dollars in \nfunding. On the other hand, if Florida complies with the mandate, its facilities will \nlose critical staff, exacerbating an already-severe staffing crisis. To weather the \nstaffing dip, its facilities will either need to pay exorbitant premiums to contract \nstaffing agencies or provide a diminished quality of patient care. They will also bear \nthe cost of ensuring that their employees have complied with the mandate, which \nthey  cannot  recover  in  a  suit  against  the  federal  government.  See  Chiles  v. \nThornburgh, 865 F.2d 1197, 1209 (11th Cir. 1989); Odebrecht Const., Inc. v. Sec’y, \nFla. Dep’t of Transp., 715 F.3d 1268, 1289 (11th Cir. 2013). And adding insult to \ninjury,  compliance  will  make  Florida  complicit  in  an  unlawful  policy  that  it \nfundamentally opposes, undermining its sovereignty. \n69.  Florida’s AHCA also faces an equally untenable choice. It is obligated \nby contract and the mandate to survey participating facilities to verify compliance \nwith the mandate. If it refuses to comply, it stands to lose millions in federal funding. \nAnd if it submits, it will be forced to expend additional resources while carrying out \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 26 of 36\nCMS’s compliance checks, which it again cannot recover in a suit against the federal \ngovernment. See Chiles, 865 F.2d at 1209.  \n70.  Further, the mandate will require private healthcare facilities in Florida \nto bear the administrative cost of ensuring compliance with the mandate, which they \ntoo cannot recover. Id. They will also lose employees who refuse to submit to \nvaccination, further straining the resources of those facilities, injuring the public \nhealth, and taxing Florida’s economy. \n71.  Finally, the Florida Legislature is currently contemplating legislation \nthat would prohibit vaccine mandates.55 This legislation is likely to pass within the \nnext few days. Once it does, Florida will face an additional sovereign injury. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT 1 \nAgency action that is not in accordance with law  \nand is in excess of authority, in violation of the APA \n72.  Florida repeats and incorporates by reference ¶¶ 1–71. \n73.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” that is “not in accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory . . . authority, or \n \n55 Governor DeSantis Joined By President Simpson and Speaker Sprowls to Announce Legislative \nAgenda for Special Session of the Florida Legislature, Florida Governor’s Office (Nov. 8, 2021), \nhttps://www.flgov.com/2021/11/08/governor-desantis-joined-by-president-simpson-and-speaker-\nsprowls-to-announce-legislative-agenda-for-special-session-of-the-florida-legislature/. \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 27 of 36\nlimitations, or short of statutory right,” or “without observance of procedure required \nby law.” See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C)–(D). \n74.  The mandate is contrary to law for at least two reasons. \n75.  First, the mandate violates 42 U.S.C. § 1395z because it was issued \nwithout required consultation with the States. \n76.  Under § 1395z, CMS “shall consult with appropriate State agencies and \nrecognized national listing or accrediting bodies” in “carrying out [its] functions” \nrelating  to  “determination  of  conditions  of  participation”  for  many  healthcare \nproviders subject to the mandate. 42 U.S.C. § 1395z.56 CMS did not do so.  \n77.  Second, the mandate exceeds CMS’s statutory authority.  \n78.  Indeed, Congress speaks clearly when it “authoriz[es] an agency to \nexercise powers of vast economic and political significance.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, \n141 S. Ct. at 2489. And courts apply a presumption that Congress “preserves the \nconstitutional balance between the National Government and the States.” Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 862 (2014). But nothing in the several provisions that \ngovern Medicaid and Medicare clearly authorizes a vaccine mandate.  \n \n56 Specifically, the consultation requirement applies to conditions of participation for hospitals \nunder § 1395x(e)(9), psychiatric hospitals under § 1395x(f)(4), skilled nursing facilities under \n§§ 1395x(j) and 1395i-3, home health agencies under § 1395x(o)(6), comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation  facilities  under  § 1395x(cc)(2),  hospices  under  §  1395x(dd)(2),  critical  access \nhospitals  under  §§  1395x(mm)(1)  and  1395i-4(e),  and  ambulatory  surgical  centers  under \n§ 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i). \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 28 of 36\n79.  To  the  contrary,  §  1395  makes  clear  that  no  federal  officer  may \n“exercise any supervision or control” over (a) “the practice of medicine or the \nmanner in which medical services are provided,” (b) “the selection, tenure, or \ncompensation of any officer or employee of any institution, agency, or person \nproviding health services,” or (c) “the administration or operation of any such \ninstitution, agency, or person.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395. The mandate does just that.  \n80.  For these reasons, the mandate is contrary to law. \nCOUNT 2 \nFailure to conduct notice and comment in violation of the APA \n81.  Florida repeats and incorporates by reference ¶¶ 1–71. \n82.  The APA requires notice of, and comment on, agency rules that “affect \nindividual rights and obligations.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 303 \n(1979); see 5 U.S.C. §§ 553, 706(2)(D). The Medicare and Medicaid schemes track \nthese requirements. See 42 U.S.C § 1395hh(b)(1). \n83.  CMS concedes that it did not engage in notice and comment. 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,583. Instead, it invokes the “good cause” exception, which permits an \nagency to waive notice and comment when it finds for “good cause” that the process \nis “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Id. at 61,583 \n(citing 5 U.S.C § 553(b)(B)). This standard is notoriously difficult to satisfy. See \nMack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 29 of 36\n84.  CMS relies on the COVID-19 pandemic for good cause, along with \nrelated circumstances like the Delta variant. Id. at 61,583–84. Of course, no one \ncontests the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. But after almost two years, \nCOVID-19 is a persistent feature of life and cannot itself constitute good cause. See \nBecerra, 2021 WL 2514138, at *45; Regeneron Pharms., Inc. v. HHS, 510 F. Supp. \n3d 29, 48 (S.D.N.Y. 2020). To hold otherwise would effectively repeal notice and \ncomment requirements for the duration of the pandemic.  \n85.  In fact, CMS’s own delay is what caused its so-called emergency. \nVaccines have been available to healthcare workers for nearly a year. 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,584.57 But until now, CMS made no efforts to mandate vaccination. “Good \ncause cannot arise as a result of the agency’s own delay.” Nat. Res. Def. Council v. \nNat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d 95, 114 (2d Cir. 2018). And CMS \nwaited  nearly  three  additional  months  between  announcing  the  mandate  and \npublishing it. \n86.  CMS’s other good-cause justifications fare no better. Most prevalent, it \ncites the possibility for a “more severe” flu season as support for good cause given \nthe risks of “coinfection” and increased “stress” on the healthcare system. See 86 \n \n57 Maggie Fox, Some Americans should start getting the first Covid-19 vaccine today. It will take \nmonths  before  everyday  people  get  the  shots,  CNN  (Dec.  14,  2020), \nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/health/covid-vaccine-timeline/index.html  (reporting  that \nhealthcare workers would be eligible for vaccination in December 2020).  \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 30 of 36\nFed. Reg. at 61,584. Yet in the next breath, CMS admits that “the intensity of the \nupcoming 2021–2022 influenza season cannot be predicted” and that “influenza \nactivity during the 2020–2021 season was low throughout the U.S.” Id.  \n87.  Moreover,  notice  and  comment  is  needed  to  bolster  the  “fairness, \nwisdom, and political legitimacy” of a rule of this magnitude. Becerra, 2021 WL \n2514138, at *45 (quoting Hickman & Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise § 5.10 \n(6th ed. 2020)).  \n88.  For these reasons, notice and comment was required. \nCOUNT 3 \nArbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the APA \n89.  Florida repeats and incorporates by reference ¶¶ 1–71. \n90.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction” that is “arbitrary [or] capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The mandate is \narbitrary and capricious for several reasons. \n91.  First,  the  mandate  does  not  adequately  consider  the  alternative  of \ntesting requirements. See DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 \n(2020).  CMS  claims  to  have  “considered  requiring  daily  or  weekly  testing  of \nunvaccinated individuals” instead of mandatory vaccination. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614. \nBut it dismisses this alternative in a cursory sentence, proclaiming that vaccination \nis a “more effective infection control measure.” Id.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 31 of 36\n92.  Second, CMS fails to “articulate a satisfactory explanation” for why its \nmandate is “rational” given that unvaccinated workers may flee the industry. Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n93.  Third, CMS fails to adequately consider the impact its mandate will \nhave  on  vaccination-education  efforts.  In  Florida,  those  efforts  have  had  great \nsuccess, sometimes raising vaccination rates by ten percent.58 Yet CMS fails to \nconsider to what extent its mandate will “chill” individuals who might otherwise \ntake the vaccine voluntarily.  \n94.  Fourth, CMS does not rationally connect its statistics to most of the \nhealthcare  facilities  covered  by  its  mandate.  Indeed,  CMS  recognizes  that  the \n“providers and suppliers regulated under this rule are diverse in nature, management \nstructure, and size.” Id. at 61,602. Still, CMS relies mostly on facts and figures \ninvolving  long  term  care  facilities—providers  that  serve  mostly  elderly  or \nimmunocompromised patients—to justify applying the mandate to other providers. \nSee, e.g., id. at 61,585. \n95.  Fifth,  CMS  does  not  consider  the  rate  at  which  “game-changing” \nCOVID-19 treatments minimize the more-serious health risks of COVID-19. Nor \n \n58 Hannah Mitchell, ‘Like hand-to-hand combat’: Florida health system battles vaccine hesitancy \n1  employee  at  a  time,  Becker’s  Hospital  Review  (Nov.  4,  2021), \nhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hospital-management-administration/like-hand-to-hand-\ncombat-florida-health-system-battles-vaccine-hesitancy-1-employee-at-a-time.html. \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 32 of 36\ndoes  CMS  consider  the  viability  of  state-by-state  approaches  to  mandatory \nvaccination, despite acknowledging that, in  some States, COVID-19 cases “are \ntrending downward.” Id. at 61,583–84.  \n96.  Sixth,  CMS  concludes  that  prior  COVID-19  infection  should  not \nqualify a covered employee for an exemption from the mandate because it is not \nequivalent to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Id. at 61,559, 61,614. Elsewhere, \nhowever, CMS recognizes the value of natural immunity. See id. at 61,604 (finding \nnatural  immunity  “reduce[s]  the  risk  to  both  health  care  staff  and  patients \nsubstantially”);  id.  (noting  that  those  who  recover  are  “in  very  rare  cases  still \ninfectious”).  \n97.  Seventh, CMS inconsistently claims the mandate will protect patients \nwhile recognizing, in its cost-benefit analysis, that “the effectiveness of the vaccine \nto prevent disease transmission by those vaccinated [is] not currently known.” E.g., \n86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569, 61,615.  \n98.  Eighth, CMS fails to consider the interests of millions of healthcare \nworkers  who  pursued  their  careers  without  knowing  they  would  be  subject  to \nmandated vaccination. Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1913. And it ignores the reliance \ninterests of healthcare employers, including the States, who ordered their affairs \nunder  the  assumption  that  Medicaid  and  Medicare  dollars  would  be  available \nwithout this onerous condition. \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 33 of 36\n99.  Ninth, the mandate is the product of political pressure, not measured \njudgment. Aera Energy LLC v. Salazar, 642 F.3d 212, 220 (D.C. Cir. 2011). The \ntrue impetus is clear: facing a scandal over his actions in Afghanistan, dismal \napproval numbers on his COVID response, and an inability to advance his legislative \nagenda, President Biden succumbed to pressure to control the healthcare decisions \nof millions. He did so even though his Administration had assured the public that \nvaccine mandates are “not the role of the federal government.”59  \n100.  Finally, CMS fails to adequately explain its extreme departure from its \nprior practice of not mandating vaccines. See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, \n349 F. Supp. 3d 838, 858 (N.D. Cal. 2018); accord Regents, 140 S. Ct. at 1913. \n101.  For these reasons, the mandate is arbitrary and capricious. \nCOUNT 4 \nViolation of the Spending Clause \n102.  Florida repeats and incorporates by references ¶¶ 1–71. \n103.  The mandate is also an unconstitutional condition on Florida’s receipt \nof federal funds.  \n“[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, \nit must do so unambiguously,” so “States [can] exercise their choice knowingly.” \n \n59 Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, July 23, 2021, The White House (July 23, 2021), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/23/press-briefing-by-press-\nsecretary-jen-psaki-july-23-2021/. \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 1   Filed 11/17/21   Page 34 of 36\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). Here, Florida \nagreed to a lucrative contract, paying millions in federal funds, to enforce Medicare \nand  Medicaid  requirements  on  healthcare  providers.  When  it  agreed  to  do  so, \nhowever,  it  was  given  no  notice  that  it  would  have  to  enforce  vaccination \nrequirements. Florida now faces the untenable choice of refusing to enforce the \nmandate, and losing millions, or acquiescing. But the Spending Clause does not \nallow the government to put Florida to this choice—any conditions must have been \ndisclosed to Florida from the beginning. Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17; cf. NFIB, 567 \nU.S. at 584. \n104.  For this reason, the mandate violates the Spending Clause. \nCOUNT 5 \nDeclaratory judgment that the Biden Administration’s policy is unlawful \n105.

Having fully reviewed the \nmaterials submitted, the Court finds no showing of irreparable injury to support entry \nof a TRO or preliminary injunction, and therefore the motion is due to be denied.1   \nBackground \n  On November 17, 2021, the State of Florida filed its Complaint, seeking \npreliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief against the Department \n \n1 The motion does not request an evidentiary hearing, and the Court concludes that the \nmotion can be decided on the basis of the affidavits submitted.  Florida represents that the motion \nhas been furnished to the Defendants by mail.    \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 2 of 11\nPage 2 of 11 \n \nof Health and Human Services (“HHS”); Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as \nSecretary of HHS; the United States of America; Chiquita Brooks-Lasure, in her \nofficial capacity as Administrator of the CMS; and the CMS.2  The Complaint seeks \na permanent injunction to prevent the implementation of the CMS’s interim final \nrule mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for covered healthcare staff, see Omnibus \nCOVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61555-01 (Nov. 5, 2021), \nand a declaration that the rule is unlawful.   ECF No. 1.  The Complaint asserts \nseveral causes of action, namely, that the agency action is in excess of the CMS’s \nstatutory authority (Count 1), that the CMS failed to follow notice and comment \nrulemaking procedures (Count 2), and that the CMS’s action was arbitrary and \ncapricious (Count 3), all in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 553, 706.  Also, Florida claims the rule is an unconstitutional condition on \nFlorida’s receipt of federal funds, in violation of the Spending Clause of the United \nStates Constitution (Count 4), and seeks a “declaratory judgment that the Biden \nAdministration’s policy is unlawful.”  ECF No. 1 at 34.  \n  In brief, the interim final rule, which was issued on November 5, 2021, \n“revises the requirements that most Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and \n \n2 According to the Complaint, the CMS is a component of HHS. \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 3 of 11\nPage 3 of 11 \n \nsuppliers  must  meet  to  participate  in  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  programs.”  \nOmnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61555-01 ( Nov. \n5,  2021).    More  particularly,  the  rule  requires  covered  healthcare  staff  to  be \nvaccinated against COVID-19 and to have received at least a first dose by December \n6, 2021.  See id. at 61,573.  The mandate is implemented in two phases.  Phase 1 \nrequires staff to have a first dose or a lawful exemption prior to December 6, 2021, \nand requires facilities to develop appropriate procedures by that date.  Id.  Phase 2 \nrequires the second dose by January 4, 2022.  Providers must document compliance \nand process requests for exemptions.  Id. at 61,572.  The rule provides that, as with \nall new or revised requirements, the CMS will issue interpretive guidelines and will \nadvise and train State surveyors on how to assess compliance.  Id. at 61,574.  If cited \nfor noncompliance, providers may be subject to enforcement remedies, listing as \nexamples  civil  money  penalties,  denial  of  payment  for  new  admissions,  or \ntermination of the Medicare/Medicaid provider agreement.  Id. at 61,574.   \n  In Section III of the interim final rule, the CMS explains that it found good \ncause  to  issue  the  rule  without  engaging  in  the  ordinary  notice  and  comment \nprocedure  prior  to  implementation,  citing  the  urgency  of  the  2021  COVID-19 \noutbreaks associated with the Delta variant and the ongoing pandemic, declared by \nthe  President  to  be  a  national  emergency,  as  well  as  the  “vital  importance  of \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 4 of 11\nPage 4 of 11 \n \nvaccination” in protecting healthcare consumers and staff alike.  Id. at 61,583–\n61,586.  Moreover, the CMS noted the pandemic’s strain on the United States’ \nhealthcare system and that the onset of the 2021-2022 influenza season presents an \nadditional threat.  According to CMS, data on the health consequences of coinfection \nwith influenza and COVID-19 is limited and complicated by the fact that COVID-\n19 has greater rates of mortality and hospitalization than influenza.  Also, while the \nrule went into effect before notice and comment based on this finding of good cause, \nthe CMS will receive comments through January 4, 2022.  Id. at 61,601. \n  Simultaneously with its Complaint, Florida filed the pending motion for a \nTRO or preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the operation of the interim final \nrule prior to December 6, 2021.  In support of the motion, Florida presents several \naffidavits of directors of State facilities, agencies or institutions, asserting ways in \nwhich  their  operations  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  the  vaccine  mandate.3  \nFlorida’s agency for Health Quality Assurance (“HQA”) conducts surveys on behalf \n \n3 Specifically, Florida includes the affidavits of Kimberly Smoak, Deputy Secretary for \nHealth Quality Assurance, Florida Agency for Health Care Administration; Erica Floyd Thomas, \nAssistant Secretary for Substance Abuse and Mental Health, Florida Department of Children and \nFamilies;  Mark  S.  Lander,  Interim  Deputy  Secretary  for  County  health  Systems,  Florida \nDepartment of Health;  Carl Wesley Kirkland, Jr., Deputy Director of Institutional Operations, \nFlorida Department of Corrections;  Robert Asztalos, Deputy Executive Director of the Florida \nDepartment of Veterans’ Affairs; and Tom Rice, Deputy Executive Director for Programs at the \nAgency for Persons with Disabilities. \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 5 of 11\nPage 5 of 11 \n \nof CMS, reviewing facilities for compliance.  HQA’s Deputy Secretary Kimberly \nSmoak states that if it were to refuse to enforce the mandate, HQA would lose its \nsubstantial  federal  funding  as  a  consequence  or  have  its  agreement  with  HHS \nterminated.  ECF 2-1.  Similarly, the Florida Department of Children and Families \n(“DCF”) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Assistant Secretary, Erica Thomas, \nstates that under the mandate, the failure of a psychiatric residential treatment facility \nto comply could subject the facility to enforcement remedies by CMS (such as civil \nmoney  penalties, denial of payment  for  new  admissions,  or  termination  of  the \nMedicare/Medicaid provider agreement).  According to Thomas, DCF employs \n3,013 employees in psychiatric residential treatment facilities; it already suffers from \nstaffing shortages, especially in rural areas; and “some employees will refuse the \nvaccination,” which will amplify the staffing shortage and may result in an inability \nto provide effective treatment or may result in clients spending longer periods in jail \nawaiting a residential placement.  ECF 2-3.  Also, in the event DCF were not to \ncomply, it would lose substantial federal funding that is critical to supporting patient \nservices.   \n  The Interim Deputy for the Florida Department of Health (“DOH”), Mark \nLander, expresses similar concerns, stating that DOH estimates it could lose “up to \n12 employees” in three counties due to the vaccine mandate, which would adversely \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 6 of 11\nPage 6 of 11 \n \nimpact patient care by delaying services and requiring clients to travel long distances \nfor primary care.  ECF No. 2-3.  As an example, Lander states that the Walton \nCommunity Health Center estimates “up to 57 employees may be lost” due to the \nvaccine mandate, causing a serious disruption in services, or, a failure to comply will \nresult in a loss of significant federal funding that would have negative impacts on \nclient care.  Id.  \n  Florida also presents affidavits from the directors of the Florida Department \nof Corrections, the Florida Department of Veterans’ Affairs, and the Agency for \nPersons  with  Disabilities,  who  likewise  report  existing  staff  shortages  and  the \ninability  to  provide  necessary  services  to  incarcerated  individuals,  veterans,  or \npersons  with  disabilities  if  the  vaccine  mandate  is  imposed,  either  due  to  the \nanticipated loss of more employees or the negative impact that would result from the \nsignificant loss of federal funding if the agency is unable to comply.  ECF Nos. 2-4, \n2-5, 2-6.  Carl Kirkland of the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) states that \nin addition to an immediate staffing shortage, the DOC may have to engage in \nbargaining with the Florida Police Benevolent Association, which would object to a \nvaccine requirement for its members, but this negotiation could not be completed \nbefore December 6, 2021.  ECF No. 2-4.   Robert Asztalos of the Florida Department \nof  Veterans’  Affairs,  states  that  the  vaccine  mandate  will  exacerbate  staffing \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 7 of 11\nPage 7 of 11 \n \nshortages that already exist because “some employees may leave.”  ECF No. 2-5.  \nDeputy Executive Director for the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, Tom Rice, \nstates that “if widespread resignations were to occur,” it would place the health and \nsafety of residents at risk and consequently also result in Intermediate Care Facilities \n(“ICF”) losing their certification if unable to meet certain staffing ratios that exist to \nprotect the health and welfare of residents.  Rice further states that the agency already \nfaces staffing challenges and that based on responses to a survey of employees and \nthe indications of staff, he estimates the agency will lose about 10% of its total filled \npositions.  He further states that at one ICF, 194 out of 559 employees are not \nvaccinated, and “based on [Rice’s] personal knowledge and indications from staff, \nclose to 95% of the 194 could resign,” negatively impacting the ICF’s required \nstaffing levels.  ECF No. 2-6.  Alternatively, Rice states that if an IFC fails to comply \nwith the rule, it is subject to losing substantial federal funding that would likewise \nnegatively impact the care and safety of residents in the facilities. \nDiscussion \n  A district court may grant a TRO or preliminary injunction only if there is (1) \na  substantial  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits;  (2)  the  plaintiff  will  suffer \nirreparable injury absent an injunction; (3) the threatened injury to the plaintiff \noutweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 8 of 11\nPage 8 of 11 \n \nand (4) the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.  Osmose, Inc. v. \nViance, LLC, 612 F.3d 1298, 1307 (11th Cir. 2010); Siegel v. LePore, 234 F.3d 1163, \n1176  (11th  Cir.  2000).    A  restraining  order  or  preliminary  injunction  is  “an \nextraordinary  and  drastic  remedy”  granted  only  if  the  plaintiff  has  “clearly \nestablished” that each of the four requirements is satisfied.  Siegel, 234 F.3d at 1176 \n(internal marks omitted). Thus, under Eleventh Circuit law, even if the plaintiff \ndemonstrates a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, preliminary injunctive \nrelief is improper “in the absence of a substantial likelihood of irreparable injury”–\n–long considered “the sine qua non of injunctive relief.”  Id.   \n  On review of the record, the Court finds no adequate showing that irreparable \ninjury  will  occur  in  the  absence  of  a  TRO  or  preliminary  injunction  prior  to \nDecember 6, 2021.  The affidavits in support of the motion include assertions of how \nthe various agencies and institutions anticipate they may be adversely impacted by \nthe mandate.  In particular, the affidavits express opinions of agency heads who \n“estimate” that they “may” lose a certain percentage or a number of employees, or \nspeculate as to the consequences they will suffer “if widespread resignations were \nto occur.”  However, such opinions, absent supporting factual evidence, remain \nspeculative and may be disregarded as conclusory.  See Rogers v. Evans, 792 F.2d \n1052, 1065 n.9 (11th Cir. 1986) (finding the district court properly struck an affidavit \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 9 of 11\nPage 9 of 11 \n \nthat was “phrased in conclusory terms without citing facts”).  The injury must be \n“neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent.”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of Ass’n \nof Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, Fla., 896 F.2d 1283, 1285 (11th \nCir. 1990) (quoting Tucker Anthony Realty Corp. v. Schlesinger, 888 F.2d 969, 973 \n(2d Cir. 1989)).  Additionally, statements regarding employees’ intent to resign are \nhearsay. \n  Also, it is represented that these agencies receive substantial federal funding, \nwhich may be cut off if they refuse to comply, resulting in a loss of services and \npatient care, or longer waits or longer drives for patients.  However, economic loss \nsuch as the loss of funding is not irreparable.  An injury is “irreparable” only if it \ncannot be undone through monetary remedies.  Id.  Florida argues that the economic \nharm its agencies will suffer from this loss of funding can establish irreparable harm \nin light of the sovereign immunity of the United States, against which it has no \nmonetary recourse, citing Odebrecht Const., Inc. v. Sec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Transp., 715 \nF.3d  1268,  1289  (11th  Cir.  2013)  (referencing  a  state’s  Eleventh  Amendment \nimmunity from suit for damages in federal court).  However, Florida has asserted \nclaims under the APA and such violations, if found, can be remedied and restored in \nthe ordinary course of litigation.  “The possibility that adequate compensatory or \nother corrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary course of \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 10 of 11\nPage 10 of 11 \n \nlitigation, weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.”  Ne. Fla. Chapter of \nAss'n of Gen. Contractors, 896 F.2d at 1285 (quoting Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. \n61, 90 (1974)).  Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that the anticipated loss \nof federal funding from the State agencies’ noncompliance will occur immediately \non December 6, 2021, because the asserted loss of staff is speculative, the affidavits \nfail take to into account any impact from the availability of the exemption process \nprovided in the interim final rule, and even if noncompliance occurs, any potential \ntermination of funding would not occur on December 6.  \n  Florida also contends there is irreparable injury to its own sovereignty if state \nlaw is preempted or if there is interference with state policy.  This argument lacks \nmerit and even if this could state irreparable injury, Florida references no law or \nestablished  policy  in  danger  of  preemption  but  argues  only  that  the  Florida \nLegislature is contemplating legislation that would prohibit vaccine mandates.  This \nis insufficient to justify the kind of relief Florida seeks.   \n  Accordingly,  Florida’s  Motion  for  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order  or \nPreliminary Injunction, ECF No. 2, is DENIED.  Defendants are directed to respond \nCASE NO. 3:21cv2722-MCR-HTC \n\nCase 3:21-cv-02722-MCR-HTC   Document 6   Filed 11/20/21   Page 11 of 11\nPage 11 of 11 \n \nto the Complaint in due course. \n  DONE AND ORDERED this 20th day of November 2021. \n \nM.
