    "summary": "<p>This case is about whether the federal government can require Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. President Joe Biden announced in September 2021 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would issue a rule requiring vaccination for all employees in Medicare- and Medicaid- participating facilities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), which is a component of HHS, issued a rule to that effect. On November 15, 2021, the States of Louisiana, Montana, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia sued Xavier Becerra (the Secretary of HHS), HHS, CMS, and Chiquita Brooks-Lasure (Administrator of CMS) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.</p>\r\n<p>The states presented several statutory, procedural, and constitutional claims for relief. They argued that CMS violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by acting in excess of its statutory authority, arguing that CMS lacks the power to mandate vaccinations and that in doing so exceeded its grant of authority by the Social Security Act. According to the states, this overstep implicated major constitutional questions such as the Nondelegation Doctrine, the Tenth Amendment, and the Spending Clause. The states also claimed that the CMS violated the Congressional Review Act&mdash;which requires all rules be submitted to Congress, giving it an opportunity to disapprove of the rule&mdash;and that CMS&rsquo;s invocation of the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; exception was inappropriate. They further argued that the rule was arbitrary and capricious and therefore in violation of the APA. The states contended CMS failed to engage in reasoned decision-making and arbitrarily failed to account for the economic impacts of the mandate on the healthcare industry and the costs to the states and instead simply followed the directions of the President. The states also claimed that CMS failed to abide by the notice and comment requirements for federal rule-making, in violation of the APA and the Social Security Act. In addition, the states argued that the vaccine mandate violated 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1395 and 1395z because it granted CMS too much control over the selection of health care employees and because CMS failed to consult with the appropriate state agencies. Finally, the states claimed that the mandate violated 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1302 due to HHS's failure to prepare a regulatory impact analysis on the mandate's effect on rural hospitals.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the claims of statutory violations, the states also made constitutional and federalism arguments. They stated that the vaccine mandate violated the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution by putting an unconstitutional condition on the states' receipt of federal funds and by using the federal government's spending power to conscript state agencies for federal purposes. The states also contended that the mandate violated the anti-commandeering doctrine by compelling states to administer federal regulatory programs. Lastly, the states argued that the federal government violated the Tenth Amendment and the principles of federalism by exercising power beyond what was delegated to it through the Constitution and U.S. Congress and by interfering with the states' police power, which includes the authority to adopt public health regulations.</p>\r\n<p>The states sought a preliminary and permanent injunction against enforcement of the mandate and, a declaration that the mandate is unconstitutional and unlawful, and tolling of the mandate&rsquo;s compliance deadlines pending judicial review. The case was assigned to District Judge Terry A. Doughty.</p>\r\n<p>The states also moved for a preliminary injunction on November 15, 2021. On November 30, the court granted the motion and enjoined CMS from implementing and enforcing the vaccine mandate. 571 F.Supp.3d 516. The court ruled that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their case. The court relied on a recent Fifth Circuit case upholding a stay of a vaccine mandate promulgated by OSHA in its analysis. The court also found that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s newly fashioned &ldquo;major questions doctrine&rdquo; required Congressional authority for &ldquo;decisions of vast economic and political significance,&rdquo; and found no clear indication of Congress's intent to authorize CMS to enact such a substantial and significant mandate.</p>\r\n<p>The court also found a likelihood that CMS improperly bypassed the notice and comment requirements of the APA and the Social Security Act. The court noted that while the requirements may be bypassed if the agency has good cause, CMS's own delay in mandating vaccination undermined its emergency justification argument for dispensing with the requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The court also determined that the states were likely to succeed in establishing that the vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious. The court held that CMS lacked evidence showing that vaccination status has a direct impact on COVID-19 spread in healthcare facilities. Furthermore, the court found that CMS had improperly rejected alternatives to the mandate, such as periodic testing or exemptions for individuals with natural immunity from COVID-19 due to a prior infection. The court also found a likelihood of a finding that the mandate is arbitrary and capricious because it is overbroad. Specifically, the court noted that the mandate applies to all covered facilities equally, regardless of the dangers of COVID-19 infection in each respective facility. The court also concluded that CMS had failed to adequately explain its sudden change in policy and judged the change to be pretextual and based on President Biden&rsquo;s declaration of his intention to impose a national CMS mandate. The court also determined that when CMS weighed the benefits and risks of the mandate to the healthcare industry, it failed to properly consider all reliance interests, particularly the interests of those opposed to the mandate.</p>\r\n<p>Next, the court held that the plaintiffs had shown a likelihood of irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief. The court found that the states had shown that the mandate would irreparably harm their sovereign interests because they would be unable to enforce their own laws surrounding vaccination mandates and proof of vaccination. Next, the court determined that the states' &ldquo;quasi-sovereign&rdquo; interests were likely to suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction. These quasi-sovereign interests include the health and well-being of the residents of the plaintiff states. The court found that the plaintiffs had filed adequate support to show that their citizens would be physically and economically harmed by the mandate. These harms stem from the likelihood that the mandate would exacerbate already-existing staffing shortages, which would likely cause a reduction in quality of care, a decrease in the variety of services offered, and possible closures of some facilities, entirely. The court also found that the negative effects on the economies of the plaintiff states would also be irreparable due to sovereign immunity against monetary damages for federal agencies. The court further determined that the plaintiffs would likely face irreparable harm to their proprietary interests absent preliminary relief. These proprietary interests include the general financial health of the plaintiffs' facilities.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, in two paragraphs, the court held that the balance of equities favored the plaintiff states and that the public had an interest in an injunction. With no support, the court concluded that it &ldquo;believes&rdquo; the balance favors an injunction because &ldquo;the public interest is served by maintaining the constitutional structure and maintaining the liberty of individuals who do not want to take the COVID-19 vaccine.&rdquo; 571 F.Supp.3d 516.</p>\r\n<p>On December 1, 2021, the defendants appealed the district court's preliminary injunction to the Fifth Circuit (USCA Case # 21-3074). On the same day, the defendants moved to stay the preliminary injunction pending their appeal in the district court and in the Fifth Circuit. On December 1, the very same day as the defendants&rsquo; motion, the district court denied the stay. 2021 WL 5711601. The court determined that the defendants were not likely to prevail on the merits of their appeal for the same reasons that the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. In a single sentence, the court summarily concluded the defendants would not suffer irreparable harm if a stay was not entered. The court also noted that a stay would require unvaccinated employees to receive the vaccine or face termination and concluded a stay would defeat the purpose of the injunction. 2021 WL 5711601.</p>\r\n<p>On December 15, 2021, the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants' motion for a stay pending appeal as it pertained to the fourteen plaintiff states but granted the motion with respect to any other jurisdiction. The appeals court noted that nationwide injunctions must be justified in scope, and it found that the district court&rsquo;s rationale for granting a nationwide injunction was lacking and did not contain necessary principles of constitutional uniformity or the concern that patchwork rulings would undermine an injunction limited to certain jurisdictions.</p>\r\n<p>On December 16, 2021, the defendants applied to the Supreme Court for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court stayed the district court's injunction pending the defendants' appeal in the Fifth Circuit. 142 S. Ct. 647. In a per curiam opinion, the Court analyzed two preliminary injunctions against CMS's mandate: the injunction issued by the Western District of Louisiana in this case and the injunction issued in <a href=\"../../../../case/18605/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Missouri v. Biden</a>. See 571 F.Supp.3d 1079. First, the Court held that the mandate fell within the authorities that Congress conferred on HHS, including the ability to impose conditions on the receipt of Medicaid and Medicare funds if the department finds the conditions necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals receiving services through Medicare and Medicaid. The Court found that requiring providers to take steps to avoid transmitting COVID-19 was consistent with this statutory authorization. The Court noted the longstanding practice of HHS to condition Medicare and Medicaid funds on a host of conditions that address the safe and effective provision of healthcare, including conditions of participation that relate to the qualifications and duties of healthcare workers.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court also held that the mandate was not arbitrary and capricious. The Court stated that the plaintiff states had not shown that CMS had failed to examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its decisions to impose the vaccine mandate instead of a testing mandate; require vaccination of employees with natural immunity; and to depart from the agency's prior approach of encouraging, rather than mandating, vaccination. The Court also concluded that CMS had good cause to delay notice and comment, since it found that the promulgation of the rule in advance of the winter flu season would reduce COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Justice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion in the case, which was joined by Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett. Justice Alito also filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, and Barrett. 142 S. Ct. 647.</p>\r\n<p>On January 6, 2022 the defendants filed an opposed motion to stay proceedings in the district court pending appeal in the Fifth Circuit. The plaintiff states filed an opposition motion on January 14, 2022, arguing that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling contemplates that litigation will continue in the lower courts. Judge Doughty denied the defendants&rsquo; motion to stay the proceedings on January 18, concluding that, while the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling reached some of the merits of the case, the constitutional claims at issue remained unresolved. 2022 WL 495043.</p>\r\n<p>On February 4, 2022, the plaintiff states filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint to add the states of Tennessee and Virginia as plaintiffs, as well as complaining of additions to parties covered by the mandate, that the COVID virus had changed in the intervening time, and that, despite the Supreme Court ruling otherwise, the mandate was now illegal because the deferred notice and comment period had expired in the intervening time. The court denied the motion on February 9, finding that it did not have jurisdiction over the issues because the Supreme Court had remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit, where it remained pending. The court did issue, however, an indicative ruling noting that it would grant the motion for leave to amend if it had jurisdiction. 2022 WL 445159</p>\r\n<p>On February 10, 2022, the states moved in the Fifth Circuit to remand the case to the district court. In an unpublished, nonprecedential per curiam opinion, the Fifth Circuit rejected the states&rsquo; motion because the allegation the states requested to amend into the complaint (that the mandate violated the anti-commandeering doctrine) could have been made originally. The states petitioned for a rehearing en banc, which the Circuit denied on March 3, 2022. The parties argued the appeal to the original district court&rsquo;s grant of preliminary injunction before the Fifth Circuit on June 6, 2022. &nbsp;The parties then agreed that the preliminary injunction should be vacated, and the court issued an unpublished opinion vacating the injunction and remanding the case for resolution on the merits on June 13, 2022. 2022 WL 2116002.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, in the district court, the defendants had filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on March 17, 2022, arguing that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision regarding the stay of injunction in this case and Biden v. Missouri resolved the issue by either explicitly or implicitly rejecting all of the plaintiff states&rsquo; claims. The defendants also argued that the mandate did not violate the anti-commandeering doctrine because it imposed the same conditions no matter whether the facilities were privately run or run by the states. The states never filed a motion to amend their complaint to include the anti-commandeering doctrine argument, and on November 3, 2022, Magistrate Judge Kayla D. McClusky issued a recommended opinion agreeing that the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling rejected the states&rsquo; claims and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. 2022 WL 17408035.</p>\r\n<p>The states objected to the recommendation on November 17, 2022, citing the Supreme Court's major questions doctrine ruling in <em>West Virginia v. EPA, </em>but Judge Doughty accepted the recommendation after a <em>de novo </em>review on December 2, 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The states did not file an appeal, and the case is closed.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In this case, several states sued to block the federal vaccine mandate which required Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers to become vaccinated prior to December 6, 2021 (the CMS mandate). The judge granted the preliminary injunction on November 30,2021, and issued a nationwide injunction prohibiting the CMS mandate. 571 F.Supp.3d 516. The defendants appealed and requested the lower court issue a stay pending appeal, which the court denied the same day. The defendants appealed to the Fifth Circuit and moved for a stay of the injunction, which was denied in part—only for the states party to the case. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal, which was granted on January 13, 2022. On remand in the district court, the case was ultimately dismissed with prejudice on November 3, 2022 but still may be appealed.",

No. 29] in favor of Plaintiff States2. \n  Courts must consider four factors in assessing the propriety of granting a motion for stay \npending appeal. Those are (1) the likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the appeal; (2) whether \nthe movant will suffer irreparable damage absent a stay; (3) the harm that other parties will suffer \nif a stay is granted; and (4) the public interest.

No. 28], believes that the likelihood of Government Defendants’ \nsuccess on the merits is low.  \nThis Court further finds Government Defendants will not suffer irreparable harm if a stay \nis not entered. \n \n1 The Government Defendants consist of Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHH”), Chiquita Brooks–Lasure, in her official \ncapacity as Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). \n2 Plaintiff States consist of Louisiana, Montana, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, Utah, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 35   Filed 12/01/21   Page 2 of 2 PageID #:  685\nThis Court further finds that other parties will be harmed if the stay is granted. As set forth \nin the Memorandum Ruling, Government Defendants’ vaccine mandate requires over 10.3 million \nemployees of Medicare and Medicaid healthcare providers to obtain the first COVID-19 vaccine \nby December 6, 2021, and the second COVID-19 vaccine by January 4, 2022. If a stay is entered, \nthe unvaccinated employees (an estimated 2.4 million) would be required to either receive the \nvaccine  or  be  terminated  from  their  employment.  A  stay  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  the \npreliminary injunction. \nThis Court further finds that the public interest is in favor of Plaintiff States and against a \nstay. The public interest is better served by maintaining the liberty interests of employees who do \nnot wish to take the COVID-19 vaccine, pending the final resolution of the matter.  \nFor the reasons set forth herein, Government Defendants’ Motion for a Stay Pending \nAppeal [Doc. No. 32] is DENIED. \nMONROE, LOUISIANA, this 1st day of December 2021. \n   \n \n \n \n  Terry A. Doughty \nUnited States District Judge \n \n \n \n2 \n ",

The Biden Administration is playing statutory shell games with the courts, straining to \njustify an unjustifiable and unprecedented attempt to federalize public health policy and diminish the \nsovereign States’ constitutional powers. The Administration has announced three COVID-19 vaccine \nmandates to—as the President himself has confirmed—increase societal vaccination rates. There’s \njust one problem: no statute authorizes the federal Executive to mandate vaccines to increase societal \nimmunity. The Administration’s solution? Use statutory schemes never before interpreted to allow \nfederal vaccine mandates to shoehorn the President’s goals into the fabric of American society. In one \ninstance, the Administration grabbed an obscure workplace safety statute to impose a vaccine mandate \non 100 million Americans. That mandate suffers from so many patent constitutional and statutory \n2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 3 of 49 PageID #:  3\nproblems that the Fifth Circuit stayed it a day after it issued and reaffirmed its stay within a week. BST \nHoldings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, No. 21-60845 (Nov. 12, 2021). Second, the Administration tried to use the \nfederal procurement system to impose a vaccine mandate on another fifth of the American workforce. \nThat mandate, too, is already subject to multiple challenges. The third mandate is the one at issue here: \nthe Administration has coopted the Medicare and Medicaid system to impose a vaccine on 17 million \nhealthcare workers.  \n2.  But the Social Security Act focuses on patient welfare and patient access to care. By \nforcing a significant number of healthcare workers to take the shot(s) or exit the Medicare and Medi-\ncaid workforce, CMS’s Vaccine Mandate harms access to (and thus quality of) patient care. This “one-\nsize-fits-all sledgehammer” expressly undermines the Social Security Act’s singular focus on providing \naccess to care. BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, slip op. at 6 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2021). By forcing employees \nto choose “between their job(s) and their jab(s),” id. at 19, the Mandate completely ignores the un-\nprecedented labor shortage prevailing in the healthcare sector and patient wellbeing in favor of the \nPresident’s ambition to increase societal vaccination rates.  \n3.  Aside from being fundamentally at odds with the Social Security Act, the Vaccine \nMandate suffers from a host of fatal flaws. It exceeds CMS’s statutory authority; violates the Social \nSecurity Act’s prohibition on regulations that control the selection and tenure of healthcare workers; \nis arbitrary and capricious; and violates the Spending Clause, the Anti-Commandeering doctrine, and \nthe Tenth Amendment. Furthermore, CMS flouted the basic procedural requirements that Congress \nimposed on it, including the Administrative Procedure Act’s notice-and-comment requirement, the \nCongressional Review Act’s publication-and-review requirements, and the Social Security Act’s con-\nsultation and regulatory-impact-analysis requirements. The Vaccine Mandate causes grave danger to \nthe vulnerable persons whom Medicare and Medicaid were designed to protect—the poor, children, \nsick, and the elderly—by forcing the termination of millions of essential “healthcare heroes.”  \n3 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 4 of 49 PageID #:  4\nPARTIES \n4.

This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case because it arises under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States. See 28 U.S.C. §§1331, 1346, 1361; 5 U.S.C. §§701-06. An \nactual controversy exists between the parties within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §§2201(a), and this \nCourt may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and other relief under 28 U.S.C. §§2201-02, 5 \nU.S.C. §§705-06, and its inherent equitable powers. \n22.  Defendants’ publication of the Rule in the Federal Register on November 5, 2021 \nconstitutes a final agency action that is judicially reviewable under the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§704, 706. \n23.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. §1391(e)(1) because (1) Defendants are \nUnited States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities, (2) the State of Louisiana is a resident \nof this judicial district, (3) no real property is involved, and (4) a substantial part of the events or \nomissions giving rise to the Complaint occur within this judicial district. See Atlanta & F.R. Co. v. W. \n6 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 7 of 49 PageID #:  7\nRy. Co. of Ala., 50 F. 790, 791 (5th Cir. 1982); Ass’n of Cmty. Cancer Centers v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482 \n(D. Md. 2020).  \nBACKGROUND \nI.   The Medicare and Medicaid Framework Established by Congress. \n24.  Since 1965, the federal government and the States have worked together to provide \nmedical assistance to certain vulnerable populations under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct, commonly known as Medicare and Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. §§1395 et seq.; 1396 et seq.; see also \nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 289 n.1 (1985) (noting that Congress designed Medicaid to “subsi-\ndize[ ]” States in “funding ... medical services for the needy”).  \n25.  Medicaid is a cooperative state-federal program, implemented by the States, that helps \nStates finance the medical expenses of their poor and disabled citizens.  \n26.  The Social Security Act charges the Secretary of Health and Human Services with a \nwide range of administrative responsibilities relating to maintaining the programs under his purview, \nincluding Medicare and Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. §301 et seq.   \n27.  It also delegates to the Secretary certain limited rulemaking authority, including—as \nmost relevant here—the authority to “make and publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent \nwith this chapter, as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which [he] \nis charged under this chapter.\" 42 U.S.C. §1302(a). \n28.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, a federal agency within the Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services, has primary responsibility for overseeing the Medicare and Med-\nicaid programs.  \nII.   The Biden Administration’s Vaccine Policy. \n29.  As President-Elect, Mr. Biden promised he “d[i]dn’t think [vaccines] should be man-\ndatory” and “wouldn’t demand it be mandatory.” Jacob Jarvis, Fact Check: Did Joe Biden Reject Idea of \n7 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 8 of 49 PageID #:  8\nMandatory Vaccines in December 2020, Newsweek (Sept. 10, 2021), https://bit.ly/3ndyTn5. Toeing that \nline, as recently as this summer the Biden Administration disclaimed authority to require Americans \nto get a COVID-19 vaccine. See, e.g., Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, July 23, 2021, \nhttps://bit.ly/3pWnJVr (mandating vaccines “not the role of the federal government”). But as time \npassed, the President admitted that his “patience” began “wearing thin” with those “who haven’t \ngotten vaccinated.” White House, Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic \n⁠\n(Sept. 9, 2021), https://bit.ly/3Ey4Zj6.  \n30.  So in early September 2021, the Administration abandoned persuasion for brute force. \nIt announced an unprecedented series of federal mandates aimed at compelling most of the adult \npopulation of the United States to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The White House, Remarks by President \nBiden on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic (Sept. 9, 2021), https://bit.ly/3oI0pKr. His program \n⁠\nsought to “increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination requirements.” Id.; see \nalso  The  White  House,  Path  Out  of  the  Pandemic:  President  Biden’s  Covid-19  Action  Plan, \nhttps://bit.ly/3adkMXx; The White House, Vaccination Requirements Are Helping Vaccinate More \nPeople,  Protect  Americans  from  COVID-19,  and  Strengthen  the  Economy  (Oct.  7,  2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3lorbp0. \n31.  In part, those vaccine requirements include the actions challenged here. President \nBiden announced he would impose—though unilateral executive action—a vaccine mandate on “a \ntotal of 17 million healthcare workers.” Biden Sept. 9, 2021 Remarks, supra. As he explained, he’d \nalready announced his intent to “requir[e] vaccinations that [sic] all nursing home workers who treat \npatients on Medicare and Medicaid,” contending he “ha[s] that federal authority.” Id. Now, invoking \n“that same” purported “authority,” he “expand[ed] that” edict “to cover those who work in hospitals, \nhome healthcare facilities, or other medical facilities.” Id.  \n8 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 9 of 49 PageID #:  9\n32.  President Biden also expressed disrespect for state governments: “Let me be blunt. \nMy plan also takes on elected officials and states that are undermining . . . these lifesaving actions.” Id. \nSpeaking of “governor[s]” who oppose the new federal mandates, he promised that “if these gover-\nnors won’t help us beat the pandemic, I’ll use my power as President to get them out of the way.” Id. \nIII.   The Vaccine Mandate. \n33.  On November 5, 2021, CMS published an interim final rule requiring vaccination of \nstaff of certain Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers. Medicare and Medicaid Programs; \nOmnibus COVID-19 Heath Care Staff Vaccinations, 86 Fed. Reg. 61555 (Nov. 5, 2021). \n34.  The rule governs 21 types of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers \nthat are subject to Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation, conditions for coverage, or re-\nquirements for participation. See id. at 61556.  \n35.  Specifically, the rule governs the following types of facilities: Ambulatory Surgical Cen-\nters; Hospices; Psychiatric residential treatment facilities; Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the El-\nderly; Hospitals; Long-Term Care Facilities, including Skilled Nursing Facilities and Nursing Facilities; \nIntermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities; Home Health Agencies; \nComprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities; Critical Access Hospitals; Clinics; rehabilitation \nagencies; public health agencies as providers of outpatient physical therapy and speech-language pa-\nthology services; Community Mental Health Centers; Home Infusion Therapy suppliers; Rural Health \nClinics; Federally Qualified Health Centers; and End-Stage Renal Disease Facilities. See id. \n36.  The rule applies the same substantive standards to each of the 21 types of governed \nentities. See id. at 61570, 61616-61627. As CMS put it, “we are issuing a common set of provisions for \neach applicable provider and supplier.” Id. at 61570. There are “no substantive regulatory differences \nacross settings.” Id.  \n9 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 10 of 49 PageID #:  10\n37.  The regulations themselves require that every entity “develop and implement policies \nand procedures to ensure that all staff are fully vaccinated for COVID–19.” See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. \n§416.51(c).  \n38.  The policy must apply to every person “who provide[s] any care, treatment, or other \nservices for the [entity] and/or its patients”—including employees, contractors, trainees, students, and \nvolunteers—regardless of whether they have any patient-care responsibilities or even any contact with \npatients. Id. §416.51(c)(1).  \n39.  To be exempt, a healthcare worker must “exclusively provide” telehealth or support \nservices “outside of the [entity’s] setting” and “not have any direct contact with patients and other \nstaff.” Id. §416.51(c)(2). \n40.  The entity must ensure that, by December 6, 2021, all such healthcare workers submit \nto at least one vaccine dose before they can provide “any care, treatment, or other services for the \n[entity] and/or its patients.” Id. §416.51(c)(3)(i); 86 Fed. Reg. at 61555. \n41.  The entity must then ensure that, by January 4, 2022, all such healthcare workers “are \nfully vaccinated.” 42 C.F.R. §416.51(c)(3)(ii); 86 Fed. Reg. at 61555.  \n42.  The entity may provide an exemption for those granted temporary delays based on the \nCDC’s recommendations or for those who are eligible for exemptions under certain federal statutes. \n42 C.F.R. §416.51(c)(3). But the entity must “track[] and securely document[] information provided \nby those staff who have requested, and for whom the [entity] has granted, an exemption” or a tempo-\nrary delay. Id. §416.51(c)(3)(vi)-(vii). And it must ensure that all documentation “support[ing] staff \nrequests for medical exemptions from vaccination, has been signed and dated by a licensed practi-\ntioner” with specific information about which vaccines are clinically contraindicated and a statement \nof reasons for each. Id. §416.51(c)(3)(viii).  \n10 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 11 of 49 PageID #:  11\n43.  The entity must implement a “process for tracking and securely documenting the \nCOVID–19 vaccination status of all staff,” including booster-shot status. Id. §416.51(c)(3)(iv)-(v).  \n44.  Finally, the entity must implement “[c]ontingency plans” for all persons who are “not \nfully vaccinated.” Id. §416.51(c)(3)(x).  \n45.  The only way for an entity to avoid those regulations is to forfeit its federal funding. \nMedicaid providers receive this funding for services via a provider contract with States. Likewise, an \nentity that fails to comply fully with the regulations may face penalties up to and including “termination \nof the Medicare/Medicaid provider agreement.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61574. The termination of those \nprovider agreements is a death knell for healthcare providers and for access to care for millions of \npeople. \n46.  This is the first—and only—mandatory vaccination program in the history of the Med-\nicare or Medicaid programs. See id. at 61567 (“We have not previously required any vaccinations”); id. \nat 61568 (“We acknowledge that we have not previously imposed such requirements”). \nIV.  CMS’s Claimed Statutory Authority.  \n47.  CMS purports to derive the authority for this unprecedented edict primarily from two \nstatutes that grant it rulemaking authority. See id. at 61567. In truth, the authority those statutes provide \nstops well short of what would be required to authorize this sweeping mandate.  \n48.  The first relied-upon statute delegates to the Secretary of HHS the authority to “make \nand publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary to the \nefficient administration of the functions with which [he] is charged under this chapter.” 42 U.S.C. \n§1302(a).  \n49.  The second delegates to the Secretary the authority to “prescribe such regulations as \nmay be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs under” the Medicare \nprogram. 42 U.S.C. §1395hh(a)(1).  \n11 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 12 of 49 PageID #:  12\n50.  Nothing in either statute establishes that the Secretary may mandate vaccines. Nor do \nthe statutes to which they refer—governing the “efficient administration of the [Secretary’s] func-\ntions” under the Act and “the administration of the insurance programs” under the Medicare pro-\ngram—supply a basis for mandating vaccines.  \n51.  CMS also invokes a number of additional statutes as purported authority for applying \nthe Vaccine Mandate to certain types of entities. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567. For the sake of comprehen-\nsiveness—and with apologies to the reader—Plaintiff States catalogue those claimed authorities here.  \n52.  First,  for  Psychiatric  Residential  Treatment  Facilities,  CMS  invokes  42  U.S.C. \n§1396d(h)(1)(B)(i), which defines the term “inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under \nage 21” to “include[] only . . . inpatient services which . . . involve active treatment which meets such \nstandards as may be prescribed in regulations by the Secretary.” This statute implies that the Secretary \nmay create regulations setting “standards” for the “active” inpatient psychiatric “treatment” of indi-\nviduals under age 21. But a mandatory vaccine requirement for the staff at those facilities is not a \n“standard” for “active treatment” of the facilities’ patients.  \n53.  Second, CMS invokes 42 U.S.C. §1396d(d)(1) as authority for including Intermediate \nCare Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities in the vaccine mandate. That statute defines \nthose facilities to mean an institution whose “primary purpose . . . is to provide health or rehabilitative \nservices for [intellectually disabled] individuals” if “the institution meets such standards as may be \nprescribed by the Secretary.” This implies that the Secretary may create standards for the kinds of \n“health or rehabilitative services” the facility provides. But a mandatory vaccine requirement for the \nstaff at those facilities is not a “health or rehabilitative service[]” for intellectually disabled individuals. \n54.  Third, CMS claims power under 42 U.S.C. §1395i–4(e) to subject Critical Access Hos-\npitals to the vaccine mandate. That statute says that “[t]he Secretary shall certify a facility as a critical \naccess hospital if the facility—(1) is located in a State that has established a Medicare rural hospital \n12 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 13 of 49 PageID #:  13\nflexibility program . . . ; (2) is designated as a critical access hospital by the State in which it is located; \nand (3) meets such other criteria as the Secretary may require.” This statute implies that the Secretary \nmay create “other criteria” similar to the two expressly listed requirements. But it does not establish \nthat the Secretary may impose mandatory vaccines on the staff at such hospitals.  \n55.  Fourth,  End-Stage  Renal  Disease  facilities.  According  to  CMS,  42  U.S.C. \n§1395rr(b)(1)(A) subjects them to the Vaccine Mandate. That statute authorizes payments for end-\nstage renal disease services to “providers of services and renal dialysis facilities which meet such re-\nquirements as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe for institutional dialysis services and supplies \n…. transplantation services, self-care home dialysis support services which are furnished by the pro-\nvider or facility, and routine professional services performed by a physician during a maintenance \ndialysis episode.” The Secretary may create “requirements” for “institutional dialysis services,” “trans-\nplantation services,” and the like. But a mandatory vaccine requirement for the staff at those facilities \nis not a requirement “for” institutional dialysis services or supplies, transplantation services, or other \nservices listed in the statute.  \n56.  Fifth,  as  for  Ambulatory  Surgical  Centers,  CMS  relies  principally  on  42  U.S.C. \n§1395k(a)(2)(F)(i), which provides that Medicare benefits shall include payments for “services fur-\nnished in connection with surgical procedures specified by the Secretary … performed in an ambula-\ntory surgical center (which meets health, safety, and other standards specified by the Secretary in reg-\nulations).” Though this statute implies that the Secretary may create regulations setting “health, safety, \nand other standards,” it does not establish that the Secretary’s regulatory power is so broad that he \nmay mandate vaccines for employees of the ASCs.  \n57.  Sixth, CMS invokes two statutes to justify subjecting Programs of All-Inclusive Care \nfor the Elderly facilities in the vaccine mandate. The first—42 U.S.C. §1395eee(f) (Medicare)—pro-\nvides that “[t]he Secretary shall issue interim final or final regulations to carry out this section,” and \n13 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 14 of 49 PageID #:  14\nthat “[n]othing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing the Secretary from including in \nregulations provisions to ensure the health and safety of individuals enrolled in a PACE program.” \nThe second—42 U.S.C. §1396u–4(f) (Medicaid)—is materially indistinguishable in its relevant lan-\nguage. Though these statutes authorize the Secretary to adopt some health- and safety-related regula-\ntions, they do not establish that the Secretary’s regulatory power is so broad that he may mandate \nvaccines for employees.  \n58.  As for Rural Health Clinics, CMS relies principally on 42 U.S.C. §1395x(aa)(2)(K), \nwhich defines the term “rural health clinic” to “mean[] a facility which,” among certain qualifying \nfactors, “meets such other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the \nhealth and safety of the individuals who are furnished services by the clinic.” The expressly listed \nqualifying factors include the types of services provided, staff qualifications, medication requirements, \nand administrative matters. They do not include staff vaccination. This statute thus does not give the \nSecretary the power to mandate vaccines.  \n59.  For  Home  Infusion  Therapy  Suppliers,  CMS  turns  to  42  U.S.C. \n§1395x(iii)(3)(D)(i)(IV), which defines the term “qualified home infusion therapy supplier” to “mean[] \na pharmacy, physician, or other provider of services or supplier” that, among certain qualifying factors, \n“meets such other requirements as the Secretary determines appropriate, taking into account the \nstandards of care for home infusion therapy established by Medicare Advantage plans under part C \nand in the private sector.” The expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services provided \nand staff qualifications. They do not include vaccination. This statute thus does not give the Secretary \nthe power to mandate vaccines.  \n60.  According to CMS, 42 U.S.C. §1395x(p)(4)(A)(v) makes facilities that provide outpa-\ntient physical therapy and speech-language pathology services subject to the vaccine mandate. That \nstatute defines “outpatient physical therapy services” to exclude services “furnished by a clinic or \n14 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 15 of 49 PageID #:  15\nrehabilitation agency” that does not, among certain qualifying factors, “meet[] such other conditions \nrelating to the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services by such clinic or agency on \nan outpatient basis, as the Secretary may find necessary.” The expressly listed qualifying factors include \nthe types of services provided, staff qualifications, and administrative matters. They do not include \nvaccination. This statute thus does not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines. \n61.  Community Mental Health Centers, in turn, are purportedly subject to the vaccine \nmandate under 42 U.S.C. §1395x(ff)(3)(B). That statute defines a “community mental health center” \nto “mean[] an entity that,” among certain qualifying factors, “meets such additional conditions as the \nSecretary shall specify to ensure . . . the health and safety of individuals being furnished such services.” \nThe expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services provided, staff qualifications, and \nadministrative matters. They do not include vaccination. This statute thus does not give the Secretary \nthe power to mandate vaccines.  \n62.  Eleventh, CMS claims authority under 42 U.S.C. §1395x(e)(9) to include hospitals in \nthe vaccine mandate. That statute defines the term “hospital” to “mean[] an institution which,” among \ncertain qualifying factors, “meets such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary in the in-\nterest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution.” The ex-\npressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services provided, staff qualifications, and admin-\nistrative matters. They do not include vaccination. This statute thus does not give the Secretary the \npower to mandate vaccines.  \n63.  CMS includes hospices in the vaccine mandate based on 42 U.S.C. §1395x(dd)(2)(G). \nThat statute says that “[t]he term ‘hospice program’ means a public agency or private organization (or \na subdivision thereof) which,” among certain qualifying factors, “meets such other requirements as \nthe Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of the individuals who are \nprovided care and services by such agency or organization.” The expressly listed qualifying factors \n15 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 16 of 49 PageID #:  16\ninclude the types of services provided, staff qualifications, and administrative matters. They do not \ninclude vaccination. This statute thus does not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines.  \n64.  As for Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities, CMS invokes 42 U.S.C. \n§1395x(cc)(2)(J), which provides that “[t]he term ‘comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility’ \nmeans a facility which,” among certain qualifying factors, “meets such other conditions of participa-\ntion as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are \nfurnished services by such facility, including conditions concerning qualifications of personnel in these \nfacilities.” The expressly listed qualifying factors include the types of services provided, staff qualifi-\ncations, and administrative matters. They do not include vaccination. This statute thus does not give \nthe Secretary the power to mandate vaccines.  \n65.  CMS next invokes two additional statutes as authority for including long-term-care \nfacilities in the vaccine mandate. The first—42 U.S.C. §1395i–3(d)(4)(B) (Medicare)—states that “[a] \nskilled nursing facility must meet such other requirements relating to the health, safety, and well-being \nof residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find necessary.” The \nsecond—42 U.S.C. §1396r(d)(4)(B) (Medicaid)—likewise provides that “[a] nursing facility must meet \nsuch other requirements relating to the health and safety of residents or relating to the physical facili-\nties thereof as the Secretary may find necessary.” The expressly listed qualifying factors include the \ntypes of services provided, staff qualifications, licensing requirements, sanitation issues, and adminis-\ntrative matters. They do not include vaccination. These statutes thus do not give the Secretary the \npower to mandate vaccines.  \n66.  Finally, Home Health Agencies. Here CMS invokes a few additional statutes. The \nfirst—42 U.S.C. §1395x(o)(6)—defines a “home health agency” to “mean[] a public agency or private \norganization, or a subdivision of such an agency or organization, which,” among certain qualifying \nfactors that do not include vaccination requirements, “meets the conditions of participation specified \n16 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 17 of 49 PageID #:  17\nin [42 U.S.C. §1395bbb(a)] and such other conditions of participation as the Secretary may find nec-\nessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services by such agency \nor organization.” The second—42 U.S.C. §1395bbb—outlines various “conditions of participation \nthat a home health agency is required to meet,” none of which include vaccination requirements. See \n42 U.S.C. §1395bbb(a). That statute also says that “[i]t is the duty and responsibility of the Secretary \nto assure that the conditions of participation and requirements specified in or pursuant to [42 U.S.C. \n§1395x(o)] and subsection (a) of this section and the enforcement of such conditions and requirements \nare adequate to protect the health and safety of individuals under the care of a home health agency.” \n42 U.S.C. §1395bbb(b). While these statutes give the Secretary authority to protect the health and \nsafety of people served by HHAs, they do not give the Secretary the power to mandate vaccines for \nemployees of home health agencies.  \nV.   The Targeted Healthcare Workers.  \n67.  According to CMS, the Vaccine Mandate regulates over 10 million healthcare workers \nand suppliers in the United States. Id. at 61603. Of those, CMS estimates roughly 2.4 million are cur-\nrently unvaccinated. Id. at 61607. Those healthcare workers are the Vaccine Mandate’s targets.   \n68.  CMS’s objective is to coerce the unvaccinated workforce into submission or cause \nthem to lose their livelihoods. See id. at 61607 (“The most important inducement will be the fear of \njob loss, coupled with the examples set by fellow vaccine-hesitant workers who are accepting vaccina-\ntion more or less simultaneously”); id. at 61608 (“it is possible there may be disruptions in cases where \nsubstantial numbers of health care staff refuse vaccination and are not granted exemptions and are \nterminated, with consequences for employers, employees, and patients”).  \n69.  Though medical and religious exemptions may be granted in narrow circumstances, \nthe goal of the program is to vaccinate “nearly all health care workers.” Id. at 61569. This can be done \n17 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 18 of 49 PageID #:  18\nonly by changing millions of minds or losing millions of healthcare workers. After all, healthcare work-\ners can begin working for providers not subject to it, or for entities potentially subject to the now-\nstayed OSHA Emergency Technical Standard, which at least provides a masking-and-testing alterna-\ntive. Those alternatives all but ensure that healthcare workers unwilling to receive a vaccine will leave \nthe covered systems subject to it, decimating those covered facilities’ ability to provide critical \nhealthcare services and possibly forcing their exit from the Medicaid and Medicare programs or forc-\ning their closure altogether. \nVI.   The Implications for Vulnerable Americans Seeking Care.  \n70.  Because workers in the healthcare industry have already faced prolonged pressure to \nundergo vaccination and many others have not submitted to employer-imposed mandates, it stands \nto reason that many of the 2.4 million unvaccinated healthcare workers will not submit to federally \ncoerced vaccination. If the Vaccine Mandate is not enjoined, these healthcare workers will lose their \njobs; States will lose providers, suppliers, and services; and ultimately America’s most vulnerable pop-\nulations will lose access to necessary medical care. \n71.  CMS acknowledges that there are currently “endemic staff shortages for all categories \nof employees at almost all kinds of health care providers and suppliers.” Id. at 61607. And of course, \nit acknowledges that “these may be made worse” when unvaccinated workers leave as a result of the \nrule. Id.  \n72.  A few statistics illustrate the extent of the problem. Already 39% of nursing homes in \nMontana face staff shortages. See AARP Nursing Home COVID-19 Dashboard, AARP Public Policy \nInstitute  (Nov.  10,  2021),  https://www.aarp.org/ppi/issues/caregiving/info-2020/nursing-home-\ncovid-dashboard.html. That number exceeds 45% in Georgia, Idaho, and Utah, and ranges from 11% \nto 43% in the remaining Plaintiff States. Indeed, a recent study by the AARP shows that nearly one-\nthird of the nation’s 15,000 nursing homes recently reported a shortage of nurses or aides. See Emily \n18 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 19 of 49 PageID #:  19\nPaulin,  Worker  Shortages  in  Nursing  Homes  Hit  Pandemic  Peak  as  Covid  Deaths  Continue, \nhttps://bit.ly/3Dr8wji. According to the AARP, the numbers represent the worst staffing shortages \nsince the government began collecting data from nursing homes in May 2020. Low staffing levels in \nnursing homes, particularly among registered nurses, are associated with worse outcome for residents, \nincluding more COVID-19 cases, deaths, and a higher likelihood of an outbreak. Id.  \n73.  Meanwhile, somewhere between 22% and 42% of healthcare workers in those states \nare not fully vaccinated, despite having faced considerable pressure to get vaccinated. Id.  \n74.  CMS admits that it does not know how many unvaccinated workers will submit. Id. at \n61607, 61612.  \n75.  It brushes aside the specter of chronic healthcare shortages with bureaucratic jargon: \nWhile it is true that compliance with this rule may create some short-term disruption \nof current staffing levels for some providers or suppliers in some places, there is no \nreason to think that this will be a net minus even in the short term, given the magnitude \nof normal turnover and the relatively small fraction of that turnover that will be due \nto vaccination mandates.  \n \nId. at 61609. But CMS’s self-assurance is not based on evidence or reality. It cites no evidence that—\nin the current climate of long-running, wide-ranging, and persistent healthcare staffing shortages—\nnew recruitment will magically replenish staffing shortages caused by those who will leave their jobs \nrather than submit to federally coerced vaccination. CMS’s “small fraction” appears supported by little \nmore than wishful thinking. The Agency’s glass-half-full (and fact-free) optimism offers only cold \ncomfort to those healthcare heroes who have worked tirelessly from the outset of the pandemic and \nwho now face joblessness as the cost for pushing back against federal overreach—and to the patients \nwho will no longer receive healthcare because of it. \nVII.   Devastation to the Plaintiff States. \n76.  The Plaintiff States have all entered into agreements with the federal government to \nparticipate in Medicaid.  \n19 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 20 of 49 PageID #:  20\n77.  Medicare is a medical-funding program paid for and administered by the federal gov-\nernment.  \n78.  The Plaintiff States and the facilities within them rely heavily on funds provided \nthrough the Medicaid and Medicare programs.  \n79.  The Plaintiff States also operate state-run healthcare facilities that receive Medicare \nand Medicaid funding. They are thus required to impose the mandate on their own state employees. \n80.  Many of those facilities are small rural hospitals.  \n81.  In state fiscal year 2021, Louisiana’s $43 billion budget was composed of $16 billion \nin funding related to the State Medicaid program, with $1.8 billion coming from the State’s general \nfund. Louisiana added 300,000 more people to its Medicaid rolls since March 2020 when the COVID-\n19 outbreak began. As of May 2021, about 1.9 million of 4.5 million residents in Louisiana were en-\nrolled in Medicaid, amounting to about 40% of the States’ population. Thousands of facilities partici-\npate, including every hospital provider in the State. Louisiana, in part, implements its Medicaid pro-\ngram through Managed Care Contractors.  \n82.  In state fiscal year 2021, Montana received $1.78 billion in Medicaid federal revenues. \nOf its total state budget, federal Medicaid revenues alone account for 25%. \n83.  Likewise, in state fiscal year 2022, West Virginia received $3.9 billion in Medicaid fund-\ning. Federal Medicaid dollars are expected to account for almost 18% of West Virginia’s total projected \nrevenue for fiscal year 2022. Roughly a third of West Virginians are on Medicaid.  \n84.  Plaintiff State South Carolina retains 51.5 staff positions performing duties related to \nsurveying and certification for 6,385 Medicare facilities. South Carolina’s state survey agency for Med-\nicaid, the Department of Health and Environmental Control, follows the procedures set forth in the \nCMS State Operations Manual for certifying and surveying facilities and investigating complaints.   \n20 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 21 of 49 PageID #:  21\n85.  Montana operates six state-run healthcare facilities that receive both Medicare and \nMedicaid funding and are subject to the Vaccine Mandate. These include the Montana State Hospital, \nthe Montana Mental Health Nursing Care Center, the Montana Chemical Dependency Center, the \nMontana Veteran’s Home, the Eastern Montana Veteran’s Home, and the Southwestern Montana \nVeteran’s Home. \n86.  Similarly, West Virginia operates seven state-run healthcare facilities that receive Med-\nicare and Medicaid funding, including Hopemont Hospital, Jackie Withrow Hospital, John Manchin \nSr. Health Care Center, Lakin Hospital, Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital, Welch Community Hos-\npital, and William R. Sharpe Jr. Hospital. Many of these facilities serve rural communities that other-\nwise lack access to necessary medical care.  \n87.  The Plaintiff States employ state surveyors who regularly evaluate healthcare facilities’ \ncompliance with Medicare and Medicaid requirements. When the state surveyors conduct inspections, \nthey assess compliance with both federal and state regulations at the same time.  \n88.  Unless state surveyors confirm a healthcare facilities’ compliance with Medicare and \nMedicaid requirements, those facilities are not entitled to obtain Medicare or Medicaid reimburse-\nments.  \n89.  When state surveyors find that a healthcare facility is not in compliance with federal \nMedicare or Medicaid regulations, they send the facility a violation report—known as a 2567 Form—\ninforming it of the deficiencies.  \n90.  The Vaccine Mandate seeks to commandeer the state-employee surveyors and certifi-\ncation staff to become enforcers of CMS’s unlawful attempt to federalize national vaccine policy and \noverride the States’ police power on matters of health and safety. \n91.  By requiring state-run healthcare facilities and state surveyors to enforce the Vaccine \nMandate, the Plaintiff States will face increased enforcement costs.  \n21 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 22 of 49 PageID #:  22\n92.  By requiring state-run healthcare facilities and state surveyors to enforce the Vaccine \nMandate, that mandate directly infringes the Plaintiff States’ sovereign authority.  \n93.  The Plaintiff States are injured because the Vaccine Mandate purports to preempt their \nstate and local laws on matters of vaccines and the rights of their citizens. This violates the Plaintiff \nStates’ sovereign right to enact and enforce their laws. It also violates the Plaintiff States’ sovereign \nright to exercise their police power on matters such as compulsory vaccination.  \n94.  For example, the Vaccine Mandate purports to preempt Montana’s H.B. 702, which \nprohibits discrimination based on vaccination status; Indiana’s H.B. 1405, which prohibits govern-\nment entities from requiring anyone—including employees—to show proof of vaccination; Utah’s \nH.B. 308, which prohibits state agencies from conditioning employment on vaccination; and West \nVirginia’s H.B. 335, which provides for broader medical and religious exemptions to vaccination re-\nquirements. It similarly purports to preempt Alabama law, which prohibits any state government entity \nfrom soliciting its employees’ vaccination status, see Ala. Act. 2021-493 §1(a), and Louisiana law, which \npermits students at all levels to opt-out of vaccine requirements, see La. R.S. 17:180(E), without being \nbarred from admission (or exclusion after admission). \n95.  The Plaintiff States will suffer other pocketbook injuries. The Vaccine Mandate re-\nquires covered healthcare facilities to maintain documentation of their staff’s vaccination status. 86 \nFed. Reg. at 61572. That documentation can consist of records from the “State immunization infor-\nmation system.” Id. A predictable consequence of the Vaccine Mandate is thus to increase the number \nof people seeking documentation from the Plaintiff States regarding vaccination status. See Dep’t of \nCommerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019).  \n96.  The Plaintiff States have quasi-sovereign and parens patriae interests in protecting the \nrights of their citizens and vindicating them in court. The Plaintiff States thus may sue to challenge \nunlawful actions that “affect the [States’] public at large.” In re Debs, 158 U.S. 561, 584 (1895). As a \n22 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 23 of 49 PageID #:  23\nresult of the Vaccine Mandate, significant numbers of their citizens who are healthcare employees will \nbe forced to submit to bodily invasion or lose their jobs and their livelihoods. All of their citizens will \nsuffer as a result of the predictable and conceded exacerbation of labor shortages in hospitals and \nother healthcare facilities.  \nVIII.   The Careless Enactment of the Vaccine Mandate.  \n97.  CMS recognized that the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §553, and the Social \nSecurity Act, 42 U.S.C. §1395hh(b)(1), ordinarily require notice and a comment period before a rule \nlike this one takes effect. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61583.  \n98.  But CMS “believe[d] it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest . . . \nto undertake normal notice and comment procedures.” Id. at 61586. For those reasons, it thus found \n“good cause to waive” those procedures. Id.  \n99.  Trying to justify its good-cause finding, CMS stated that “[t]he data showing the vital \nimportance of vaccination” indicates that it “cannot delay taking this action.” Id. at 61583.  \n100.  But CMS did not reconcile that finding with its acknowledgement that “the effective-\nness of the vaccine[s] to prevent disease transmission by those vaccinated [is] not currently known.” \nId. at 61615. \n101.  CMS recognized that although summer brought a Delta-variant-driven COVID-19 \nsurge, “newly reported COVID–19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have begun to trend downward \nat a national level.” Id. at 61583. Yet CMS still sought to immediately impose the vaccine mandate \nbecause it claimed, without citing any support, that “there are emerging indications of potential in-\ncreases in . . . northern states where the weather has begun to turn colder.” Id. at 61584. \n102.  CMS also asserted that it must immediately implement the vaccine mandate because \n“the 2021–2022 influenza season” will soon begin. Id. at 61584. CMS offered this justification while \nsimultaneously admitting that “the intensity of the upcoming 2021-2022 influenza season cannot be \n23 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 24 of 49 PageID #:  24\npredicted” and that “influenza activity during the 2020-2021 season was low throughout the U.S.” Id. \n(Notably, the CMS did not mandate flu vaccines.) \n103.  In claiming that it must immediately implement the Vaccine Mandate, CMS ignored \nthat it waited almost two months after President Biden’s directive before it promulgated the IFC to \nthe public—and waited much longer than that for the vaccine mandate for nursing homes.  \n104.  CMS also recognized that the Vaccine Mandate is a “major rule” for purposes of the \nCongressional Review Act, and that the CRA Act requires all rules to be submitted to Congress to \nallow it an opportunity to pass a resolution disapproving the rule. A “major rule” must also receive a \nreport from the Government Accountability Office and its effective date must be delayed. 5 U.S.C. \n§801.  \n105.  Yet CMS did not even purport to comply with those procedural requirements. Nor \ndid it demonstrate how the IFC satisfies the exacting standards required for an exception from them.  \n106.  CMS also recognized that the Vaccine Mandate was subject to 42 U.S.C. §1395z, which \nrequires that “the Secretary shall consult with appropriate State agencies and recognized national list-\ning or accrediting bodies, and may consult with appropriate local agencies” when “carrying out his \nfunctions, relating to determination of conditions of participation by providers of services, under sub-\nsections (e)(9), (f)(4), (j)(15), (o)(6), (cc)(2)(I), and[] (dd)(2), and (mm)(1) of section 1395x of this title, \nor by ambulatory surgical centers under section 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title.” \n107.  CMS conceded that it did not comply with §1395z’s consultation requirement. Fed. \nReg. at 61567.  \n108.  CMS instead “intend[s] to engage in consultations with appropriate State agencies \n... following the issuance of th[e] rule,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567—action that on its face does not satisfy \n42 U.S.C. §1395z.  \n24 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 25 of 49 PageID #:  25\n109.  CMS also failed to comply with 42 U.S.C. §1302(b)(1), which requires that “[w]henever \nthe Secretary [of HHS] publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking for any rule or regulation \nproposed under subchapter XVIII, subchapter XIX, or part B of [title IX of the Social Security Act] \nthat may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals, \nthe Secretary shall prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory impact analy-\nsis.” \n110.  The  Vaccine  Mandate  threatens  to  exacerbate  already  devastating  shortages  in \nhealthcare staffing by forcing small rural hospitals to terminate their unvaccinated workers. healthcare \nworkers at rural hospitals can quit working at rural hospitals subject to the Vaccine Mandate and begin \nworking at places not subject to it, or at jobs potentially subject to the now-stayed OSHA Emergency \nTechnical Standard, which at least provides a masking-and-testing alternative to mandatory vaccina-\ntion. If unvaccinated workers quit or are fired, that will compel those hospitals to close certain divi-\nsions, cancel certain services, or shutter altogether. Those dire consequences stretch across rural \nAmerica, and their collective force required CMS to prepare a regulatory impact analysis.  \nIX.   Irreparable Harm to Individual Recipients and Providers. \n111.  If the Vaccine Mandate goes into effect, it will irreparably harm patients and providers \nby impeding access to care for the elderly and for persons who cannot afford it—a complete reversal \nof the core objectives of Medicare and Medicaid.  \n112.  The direct relationship between the healthcare labor crisis and access to care is well \nknown by CMS and all Medicaid providers. See, e.g., Dep’t for Professional Employees, Safe Staffing: \nCritical for Patients and Nurses (Apr. 2019), https://bit.ly/3Ddhdxw; Am. Hosp. Ass’n, Fact Sheet: \nStrengthening the Health Care Workforce (May 2021), https://bit.ly/3osJ4Ui; Charlene Harrington, et al., \nAppropriate  Nurse  Staffing  Levels  for  U.S.  Nursing  Homes,  Sage  Journals  (June  29,  2020), \nhttps://bit.ly/3C8tMsv.  \n25 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 26 of 49 PageID #:  26\n113.  In fact, CMS has developed criteria tying reimbursements to staffing. See e.g., Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services, Design for Care Compare Nursing Home Five-Star Quality Rating System: \nTechnical Users’ Guide at 1 (Oct. 2021), https://go.cms.gov/30nko7w.   \n114.  CMS surely knows that the termination of millions of health care workers will have an \nimmediate catastrophic impact on access to care for eligible Medicaid or Medicare recipients, more so \nin minority and already-underserved communities. Its failure to address this critical issue while log-\nrolling an interim rule is patently unlawful. CMS also openly acknowledges that the Vaccine Mandate \ntargets “aides” who it believes account for more of the under-vaccinated, see 86 Fed. Reg. at 61560, \nbut who are predominately women and minorities.  \n115.  Beyond that, the Vaccine Mandate deprives patients and providers of their procedural \nright to notice and comment under the APA. The “depriv[ation] of the opportunity to offer com-\nments” on a rule “may constitute irreparable injury while a rule promulgated in violation of [the APA] \nis in effect, provided that plaintiffs suffer some additional concrete harm as well.” E. Bay Sanctuary \nCovenant v. Trump, 349 F. Supp. 3d 838, 865 (N.D. Cal. 2018), aff’d as amended on denial of reh’g en banc, \n993 F.3d 640 (9th Cir. 2021). An affected party thus suffers irreparable harm where a rule improperly \npromulgated without notice and comment “will dramatically alter” a “complex and far-reaching regu-\nlatory regime” and the affected party has articulated “meaningful concerns.” Northern Mariana Islands \nv. United States, 686 F. Supp. 2d 7, 17-18 (D.D.C. 2009).  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nThe Vaccine Mandate Is in Excess of CMS’s Statutory Authority \n116.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n26 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 27 of 49 PageID #:  27\n117.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “not \nin accordance with law” or is “in excess of statutory . . . authority[] or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A), (C).  \n118.  The Vaccine Mandate is in excess of CMS’s statutory authority because the Social Se-\ncurity Act does not clearly authorize CMS to impose a vaccine mandate.  \n119.  CMS has never relied upon its Social Security Act authority to mandate healthcare \nworker vaccination. See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567 (“We have not previously required any vaccina-\ntions”); id. at 61568 (“[W]e have not, until now, required any health care staff vaccinations”); id. (“We \nacknowledge that we have not previously imposed such requirements”). Although “there is a first time \nfor everything ... sometimes ‘the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem ... is the \nlack of historical precedent.’” NFIB, 567 U.S. at 549.  \n120.  The Vaccine Mandate raises major issues of vast political, social, and economic im-\nportance.  \n121.  The Vaccine Mandate imposes hundreds of millions of dollars in cost on industry and \nhas other major economic effects.  \n122.  The Vaccine Mandate imposes obligations on States that exceed the limits of the fed-\neral government’s authority under the Spending Clause and Commerce Clause.  \n123.  CMS’s interpretation of the Social Security Act to authorize it to impose the Vaccine \nMandate raises grave constitutional questions under the Nondelegation Doctrine about the breadth \nof the Social Security Act’s delegation of authority. If Defendants are right that the Social Security Act \ngrants authority to mandate vaccination, both “the degree of agency discretion” and “the scope of the \npower congressionally conferred” must be limitless. Id. at 475. Yet Congress lacks authority to delegate \n“unfettered power” over the American economy to an executive agency. Tiger Lily, LLC v. HHS, 5 \nF.4th 666, 672 (6th Cir. 2021); see also State v. Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138, at *20, *37. Accordingly, \n27 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 28 of 49 PageID #:  28\nCongress’s “delegation ... of authority to decide major policy questions”—such as whether all \nhealthcare workers must be vaccinated—would violate the nondelegation doctrine. Paul v. United States, \n140 S. Ct. 342 (2019) (statement of Justice Kavanaugh respecting the denial of certiorari); see also Tiger \nLily, 5 F.4th at 672 (“[T]o put ‘extra icing on a cake already frosted,’ the government’s interpretation \nof § 264(a) could raise a nondelegation problem.”); State v. Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138, at *37. \n124.  Accordingly, CMS’s Vaccine Mandate triggers three separate clear statement rules. \nFirst, “[a]bsent a clear statement of intention from Congress, there is a presumption against a statutory \nconstruction that would significantly affect the federal-state balance.” Boelens v. Redman Homes, Inc., 748 \nF.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir. 1984); see United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971). Second, the Executive \ncannot unilaterally “push the limit of congressional authority.” Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cnty. v. \nU.S. Army Corps of Engr’s, 531 U.S. 159, 172-73 (2001). And third, Congress must clearly delegate \npower to the Executive to address issues of “deep economic and political significance.” King v. Burwell, \n576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015).  \n125.  CMS cites no statutes clearly authorizing a vaccine mandate—nor any previous inter-\npretation of those statutes during the past 55 years of the Medicare and Medicaid programs that would \nsupport this exercise of authority.  \n126.  The Act’s conferrals of general rulemaking authority do not contain a clear statement \nauthorizing the Vaccine Mandate. The main authorities CMS relies upon, Section 1102 and Section \n1871, are general authorizations to “make and publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent \nwith this chapter, as may be necessary to the efficient administration” of the Medicare program, 42 \nU.S.C. §1302(a), and to “prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration \nof the insurance programs,” id. §1395hh(a)(1). These grants of general rulemaking authority are not \nsufficient to authorize an action as major as the Vaccine Mandate.  \n28 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 29 of 49 PageID #:  29\n127.  If the Act’s general rulemaking provisions were interpreted to authorize the Vaccine \nMandate, their constitutionality would be doubtful under the Nondelegation Doctrine, the Tenth \nAmendment, and the Spending Clause. Accordingly, the Act’s general grants should be construed to \navoid those grave constitutional issues.  \n128.  For the reasons discussed in paragraphs 47-66, the specific statutes that CMS cites also \ndo not provide the clear authority needed to impose the Vaccine Mandate.  \n129.  Because the Vaccine Mandate is a federal action involving issues of major economic, \nsocial, and political significance, and is not authorized by a clear statement in the Social Security Act, \nit is beyond CMS’s statutory authority. See Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 141 S. \nCt. 2485, 2489 (2021). \nCOUNT II \nThe Vaccine Mandate Violates 42 U.S.C. §1395 \n130.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allega-\ntions stated above. \n131.  42 U.S.C. §1395 provides that nothing in Title 18 of the Social Security Act “shall be \nconstrued to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over \nthe practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided, or over the selection, \ntenure, or compensation of any officer or employee of any institution, agency, or person providing \nhealth services; or to exercise any supervision or control over the administration or operation of \nany such institution, agency, or person.” That limit is hardly surprising “given the structure and limits \nof federalism, which allow the States great latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the \nprotection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.” Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. \n243, 270 (2006) (cleaned up); see also id. (noting that federal law “presume[s] and rel[ies] upon a func-\ntioning medical profession regulated under the States’ police powers”). \n29 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 30 of 49 PageID #:  30\n132.  The Vaccine Mandate violates 42 U.S.C. §1395 by authorizing federal officials  at \nCMS to exercise “supervision” and “control” over the “selection” and “tenure” of employees \n(including state employees) and other persons “providing health services.” It does so by prohibiting \ncovered healthcare facilities from hiring unvaccinated employees and forcing those facilities to termi-\nnate—and thus end the tenure of—unvaccinated employees. \n133.  The Vaccine Mandate also violates §1395 because it authorizes federal officials at \nCMS to exercise “supervision” and “control” over the “administration” and “operation” of institu-\ntions, agencies, and persons that provide health services (including state facilities and employees). \nIt does so by dictating the hiring and firing policies of those institutions for unvaccinated workers. \nCOUNT III \nThe Vaccine Mandate Was Issued Without Notice and Comment in Violation of the APA & \nSocial Security Act \n134.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n135.  The APA provides that courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(D). \n136.  The APA requires agencies to publish notice of all “proposed rule making” in the \nFederal Register, id. §553(b), and to “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule \nmaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments,” id. §553(c). Likewise, the Social \nSecurity Act requires the HHS Secretary, before issuing the relevant types of regulations “in final \nform,” to “provide for notice of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register and a period of not \nless than 60 days for public comment thereon.” 42 U.S.C. §1395hh(b)(1).  \n137.  Such requirements “are not mere formalities” but rather “are basic to our system of \nadministrative law.” NRDC v. Nat’l Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d 95, 115 (2d Cir. 2018). \n30 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 31 of 49 PageID #:  31\n“Section 553 was enacted to give the public an opportunity to participate in the rule-making process. \nIt also enables the agency promulgating the rule to educate itself before establishing rules and proce-\ndures which have a substantial impact on those who are regulated.” U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Kast Metals \nCorp., 744 F.2d 1145, 1153 n.17 (5th Cir. 1984); see also NRDC, 894 F.3d at 115 (notice and comment \nserves “the public interest by providing a forum for the robust debate of competing and frequently \ncomplicated policy considerations having far-reaching implications and, in so doing, foster reasoned \ndecisionmaking”); Spring Corp. v. FCC, 315 F.3d 369, 373 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (notice and comment “en-\nsures fairness to affected parties[] and provides a well-developed record that enhances the quality of \njudicial review”).   \n138.  Congress has specifically emphasized the importance of a robust period of notice and \ncomment for considering changes to the Medicare system. The Supreme Court has explained that \n“Medicare touches the lives of nearly all Americans … as the largest federal program after Social \nSecurity.” Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1808 (2019). Even “minor changes” to the way \nthe program is administered “can impact millions of people and billions of dollars in ways that are not \nalways easy for regulators to anticipate.” Id. at 1816. “Recognizing this reality,” id. at 1808, Congress \ndoubled the standard 30-day comment period under the APA for any establishment of or change to \na  “substantive  legal  standard”  affecting  the  payment  for  services  under  Medicare.  42  U.S.C. \n§1395hh(a)(2), (b)(1); see also id. §1395hh(e)(1)(B)(i) (providing for a 30-day delay in effective date). \n139.  The CMS Vaccination Mandate was issued as an interim final rule—without either \nnotice or comment—with an effective date of November 5, 2021, the day of the Rule’s publication in \nthe Federal Register. 86 Fed. Reg. 61555 (Nov. 5, 2021). This bypass of the APA’s keystone require-\nment was unnecessary and unlawful. At bottom, CMS rushed to enact the mandate not to stem the \npandemic, but to deliver on the President’s promotions before the crisis expired. \n31 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 32 of 49 PageID #:  32\n140.  CMS does not dispute that the IFC is a final agency action and substantive legislative \nrule that ordinarily would be required to go through notice and comment. Instead, CMS’s sole reason \nfor not pursuing notice and comment is a brief reference to the APA’s “good cause” exception, which \nallows agencies to dispense with notice-and-comment procedures only “when the agency for good \ncause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) \nthat notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \ninterest.” 5 U.S.C. §553(b)(B); see id. §553(d)(3); 42 U.S.C. §§1395hh(b)(2)(C) and (e)(1)(B)(ii). CMS \nclaims that it faces such an emergency in this case “as a result of the COVID-19 public health emer-\ngency.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61555. CMS concludes that “[i]n light of [its] responsibility to protect the \nhealth and safety of individuals providing and receiving care and services from Medicare-and Medi-\ncaid-certified providers and suppliers,” CMS is “compelled to require staff vaccinations for COVID-\n19 in these settings” without required notice and comment. Id. at 61560. \n141.  Contrary to CMS’s claims, however, “it is well established that the ‘good cause’ excep-\ntion to notice-and-comment should be read narrowly in order to avoid providing agencies with an \n‘escape clause’ from the requirements Congress prescribed.” United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 928 \n(5th Cir. 2011); see also Mack Trucks, Inc. v. EPA, 682 F.3d 87, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (good-cause exception \nis not an “escape clause[]” to be “arbitrarily utilized at the agency’s whim”). “[T]he good cause excep-\ntion should not be used to circumvent the notice and comment requirements whenever an agency \nfinds it inconvenient to follow them.” Johnson, 632 F.3d at 929; see also Ass’n of Cmty. Cancer Centers v. \nAzar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 498 (D. Md. 2020) (“[A]n agency may not dispense with notice and com-\nment procedures merely because it wishes to implement what it sees as a beneficial regulation imme-\ndiately. Agencies presumably always believe their regulations will benefit the public. If an urgent desire \nto promulgate beneficial regulations could always satisfy the requirements of the good cause exception, \nthe exception would swallow the rule and render notice and comment a dead letter.”).  \n32 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 33 of 49 PageID #:  33\n142.   Instead, the exception “is to be narrowly construed and only reluctantly counte-\nnanced.” United States v. Ross, 848 F.3d 1129, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quotation marks and citation \nomitted). “[C]ircumstances justifying reliance on this exception are ‘indeed rare’ and will be accepted \nonly after the court has ‘examine[d] closely proffered rationales justifying the elimination of public \nprocedures.’” Council of the S. Mountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 473, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (citation \nomitted). Courts therefore generally restrict agencies’ use of the “good cause” exception “to emer-\ngency situations,” Mack Trucks, 682 F.3d at 93 (citation omitted), such as where a “delay would immi-\nnently threaten life or physical property” or risk “fiscal calamity,” Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 \nF.3d 702, 706-07 (D.C. Cir. 2014). And courts “must rely only on the ‘basis articulated by the agency \nitself’” for invoking the exception “at the time of the rulemaking.” Johnson, 632 F.3d at 929.  \n143.  CMS’s good-cause explanation comes nowhere close to meeting those exacting stand-\nards.  \n144.  CMS gave two reasons for immediately implementing the vaccine mandate. First, it \nthought immediate implementation necessary “[d]ue to the urgent nature of the vaccination require-\nments established in this IFC.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61573. Second, “to provide protection to residents, \npatients, clients, and PACE program participants (as applicable),” CMS “believe[d] it is necessary to \nbegin staff vaccinations as quickly as reasonably possible.” Id. In suggesting those reasons, however, \nCMS ignored that it waited almost two months after President Biden’s directive before it promulgated \nthe IFC to the public. Beyond that, CMS’s finding that the vaccine mandate is necessary was under-\nmined by its delay in adopting it. Vaccines have had a Food & Drug Administration Emergency Use \nAuthorization for almost a year, yet CMS did not impose this mandate until two months after the \nPresident instructed it to do so as part of his “six-point plan” to federalize public-health policy—and \nthree months after CMS announced the plan to require nursing home employees to be vaccinated. \n33 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 34 of 49 PageID #:  34\n145.  Here, there is no “emergency” sufficient to justify CMS dispensing with proper rule-\nmaking. Florida v. Becerra, 8:21-cv-839-SDM-AAS, 2021 WL 2514138, at *45 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2021) \n(concluding that the COVID-19 pandemic was insufficient for “good cause”); Regeneron Pharms. v. \nHHS, 510 F. Supp. 3d 29, 48 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (similar). \n146.  By all measures, the justifications and data cited by CMS are stale, misleading, and one-\nsided. As recently stated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff faced with a local mandatory vaccine order \nthreatening his staff, “[t]his mandate is like putting up storm windows after the storm has passed.” \nJoshua R. Miller, Los Angeles County sheriff blasts vaccine mandate causing ‘mass exodus,’ N.Y. Post (Oct. 29, \n2021), https://bit.ly/3n5I9tm.    \n147.  What’s more, the pandemic is a feeble excuse for avoiding transparency and public \ninput considering the year-long public debate over mandatory vaccines. See Chamber of Commerce of the \nU.S. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 20-CV-07331, 2020 WL 7043877, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2020) \n(Chamber of Commerce Order) (rejecting the pandemic as justification for proceeding by interim rule and \nstating that “even if the problems [the Administration] purport[s] to solve with the Rule[] may have \nbeen exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, [the Administration] do[es] not suggest they are new \nproblems”); see also Ass’n of Cmty. Cancer Centers v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d at 496 (“CMS here relies more \non speculation than on evidence to establish that the COVID-19 pandemic has created an emergency \nin Medicare Part B drug pricing sufficient to justify dispensing with valuable notice and comment \nprocedures”); Regeneron Pharms., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 510 F. Supp. 3d 29, 47 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020) (rejecting claim that a “new surge in COVID-19 cases … may lead to additional \nhardship and require immediate action” justifying good cause for interim rule on drug pricing). \n148.  Finally, considering the magnitude of the impact on the healthcare system, the \nhealthcare labor market, and areas of State authority, it was incumbent on CMS to consult with the \nStates on both the wisdom and implementation of such a far-reaching endeavor. Its failure to do so \n34 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 35 of 49 PageID #:  35\nwas not harmless error. See Johnson, 632 F.3d at 931 (“An overreaching harmless error doctrine would \nallow the agency to inappropriately ‘avoid the necessity of publishing a notice of a proposed rule and \nperhaps, most important, [the agency] would not be obliged to set forth a statement of the basis and \npurpose of the rule, which needs to take account of the major comments—and often is a major focus \nof judicial review.’”).  \n149.  Under these circumstances, the failure of CMS to comply with the APA’s notice and \ncomment provisions is fatal to the CMS interim final rule. Id. at 928-29 (“Without good cause, we \nmust enforce Congress’s choice in favor of the traditional, deliberative rulemaking process.”).  \nCOUNT IV \nThe Vaccine Mandate Violates the Congressional Review Act \n150.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n151.  The Congressional Review Act requires all rules to be submitted to Congress to allow \nit an opportunity to pass a resolution disapproving the rule. A “major rule” must also receive a report \nfrom the Government Accountability Office and its effective date must be delayed. 5 U.S.C. §801.  \n152.  CMS concedes that the Vaccine Mandate is a “major rule” for purposes of the CRA. \n86 Fed. Reg. at 61602. Yet it relies on the CRA’s “limited exception[]” for rules which “an agency for \ngood cause finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rule \nissued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the \npublic interest.” 5 U.S.C. §808.  \n153.  For the reasons discussed regarding the APA good-cause exception, CMS’s dismissal \nof its CRA obligations comes nowhere close to meeting the exacting standards allowing a major rule \nto avoid the CRA’s exacting procedures. Sorenson Commc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706 (D.C. Cir. \n35 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 36 of 49 PageID #:  36\n2014) (“Deference to an agency’s invocation of good cause—particularly when its reasoning is poten-\ntially capacious, as is the case here—would conflict with this court’s deliberate and careful treatment \nof the exception in the past.”); see also OMB, Guidance on Compliance with the Congressional Review Act, M-\n19-14 (Apr. 11, 2019) (noting APA good-cause standard applies in CRA context).  \n154.  Accordingly, the IFC violates the Congressional Review Act.  \nCOUNT V \nThe Vaccine Mandate Is Arbitrary and Capricious \n155.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference all the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n156.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is arbi-\ntrary or capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law or contrary to the Constitution. 5 U.S.C. \n§706(2)(A). \n157.   “[A]gency action is lawful only if it rests on a consideration of the relevant factors” \nand “important aspects of the problem.” Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750-52 (2015) (requiring \n“reasoned decisionmaking”). This means agencies must “examine all relevant factors and record evi-\ndence.” Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d 914, 923 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \n158.  For starters, an agency cannot “entirely fail[ ] to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); see also Am. \nWild Horse, 873 F.3d at 931 (“the Service’s Finding of No Significant Impact not only failed to take a \n‘hard look’ at the consequences of the boundary change, it averted its eyes altogether”); Gresham v. \nAzar, 363 F. Supp. 3d 165, 177 (D.D.C. 2019) (“The bottom line: the Secretary did no more than \nacknowledge—in a conclusory manner, no less—that commenters forecast a loss in Medicaid cover-\nage”). \n36 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 37 of 49 PageID #:  37\n159.  Further, agencies must actually analyze the relevant factors. “‘Stating that a factor was \nconsidered ... is not a substitute for considering it.’” State v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 556 (5th Cir. 2021) \nThe agency must instead provide more than “conclusory statements” to prove it considered the rele-\nvant statutory factors. Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2127 (2016). \n160.  The IFC is arbitrary and capricious for several independently sufficient reasons.  \n161.  First, it ignores the Social Security Act’s focus on patient wellbeing rather than the \nhealth of providers. Each prong of the President’s vaccination policy is aimed at the same overarching \ngoal: increasing individual vaccination rates in society. See Remarks by President Biden on Fighting \nthe COVID-19 Pandemic” (Sept. 9, 2021), https://bit.ly/3oI0pKr (CMS Vaccine Mandate part of \n⁠\nPresident’s plan to “increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new vaccination require-\nments”); The White House, Path Out of the Pandemic: President Biden’s Covid-19 Action Plan, \nhttps://bit.ly/3adkMXx \n162.  And the evidence, even that relied upon by CMS, shows that mandating vaccines will \nharm patient health and wellbeing. For example, the Mandate will cause or exacerbate nursing home \nstaff shortages that will significantly harm patient health and well-being. There is already a critical \nshortage of healthcare workers. In Montana alone, there is already a 39% nurse and aide shortage in \nnursing homes. AARP, “AARP Nursing Home COVID-19 Dashboard” (updated Nov. 10, 2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3HhAWyy. Likewise, hospitals in West Virginia—particularly rural ones—are facing a \nserious strain when it comes to nursing and support staff in intensive care units and other critical care \nfacilities. Aaron Williams, WV’s COVID Crisis: Hospital Staffing Shortages and the Toll It’s Taking Inside the \nICU and Beyond, 12WBOY (Oct. 5, 2021), https://bit.ly/3nctZ9J. Studies also show that Vaccine Man-\ndates will exacerbate those shortages. See Liz Hamel, et al., KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor: October \n2021, Kaiser Family Foundation (Oct. 28, 2021), https://bit.ly/3wEiJWN; Chris Isidore & Virginia \nLangmaid, 72% of unvaccinated workers vow to quit if ordered to get vaccinated, CNN.com (Oct. 28, 2021), \n37 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 38 of 49 PageID #:  38\nhttps://cnn.it/3HdgDlw.1 And CMS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to consider an ex-\nemption from the requirement to terminate employees who refused to be vaccinated for healthcare \nfacilities in HPSAs, where those facilities cannot replace terminated employees. \n163.  Second, the Secretary failed to consider or arbitrarily rejected obvious alternatives to a \nVaccine Mandate. The Secretary rejected daily or weekly testing—an option that even OSHA ap-\nproved in its ETS. 86 Fed. Reg. 61614 (Nov. 5, 2021) (“We have reviewed scientific evidence on \ntesting and found that vaccination is a more effective infection control measure.”) That conclusion is \nfacially deficient: it fails to identify the “evidence” supporting this decision, or to explain how such \nevidence relates to the goal of protecting workers or patients in a healthcare setting. In fact, there is \nno relationship, as CMS’s careful wording reveals. The goal here is “effective infection control,” not \nprotection in any particular environment.   \n164.  The rejection of natural immunity as a basis for exemption is equally dismissive and \nunsupported. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61614 (“There remain many uncertainties about as to the strength and \nlength of this [natural] immunity compared to people who are vaccinated… [It] would have potentially \nreduced benefits… It would have also[] complicated administration and likely require standards that \ndo not now exist for reliably measuring the declining levels of antibodies over time in relation to the \nrisk of reinfection. Because of current CDC guidance and understanding of relevant scientific findings, \nwe found that it was not warranted to exempt previously infected individuals.”).   \n                                                 \n1 Because CMS did not conduct notice and comment, outside sources and studies are appropriately \nused in review of the IFC. Cf. Asbestos Info. Ass'n/N. Am. v. Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 727 \nF.2d 415, 426 (5th Cir. 1984) (“We say no more than that evidence based on risk-assessment analysis \nis precisely the type of data that may be more uncritically accepted after public scrutiny, through no-\ntice-and-comment rulemaking, especially when the conclusions it suggests are controversial or subject \nto different interpretations.”); see also id. at 420 n.12 (“Because of the extraordinary posture of the \ncourt reviewing an ETS, made more extraordinary by the statutory requirement that we review it under \na substantial evidence standard, 29 U.S.C. § 655(f), we also considered the unfavorable reviews as well \nas the favorable ones to aid us in our understanding of this technologically complex case. To do oth-\nerwise ‘would convert the reviewing process into an artificial game.’”). \n38 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 39 of 49 PageID #:  39\n165.  In short, the Secretary fails to identify the evidence supporting his decision, proffers a \nvague “administrative” excuse, and punts to the CDC despite an intense public debate and a trove of \nscientific data on the strength and durability of natural immunity from COVID-19, alone and com-\npared to vaccine-induced immunity.  \n166.  For example, a highly reported study from Israel involving review of 74,000 cases of \ninfection concluded that a person with natural immunity is 27 times less likely to be reinfected than a \nvaccinated person. See Sivan Gazit, Roei Shlezinger, et al., Comparing SARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to \nvaccine-induced  immunity:  reinfections  versus  breakthrough  infections,  MEDRXIV  (Aug.  30,  2021), \nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1. Additional studies support this \nconclusion.2 \n167.  Emerging studies show that natural immunity affords benefits comparable to or better \nthan vaccination. See e.g., Melissa Healy, Study shows dramatic decline in effectiveness of all three COVID-19 \nvaccines over time, L.A. Times (Nov. 4, 2021), https://lat.ms/30hQIbj (“As the Delta variant became \nthe dominant strain of coronavirus across the United States, all three COVID-19 vaccines available to \nAmericans lost some of their protective power, with vaccine efficacy among a large group of veterans \ndropping between 35% and 85%, according to a new study”). Experts have suggested that natural \nimmunity is both superior to and more durable than the vaccines. See, e.g., Sivan Gazit et al., Comparing \nSARS-CoV-2 natural immunity to vaccine-induced immunity: reinfections versus breakthrough infections, Medrxiv \n(Aug. 25, 2021), https://bit.ly/3DnKzIZ (“This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers \nlonger lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization \n                                                 \n2 See  Dr. Michel C. Nussenzweig, Senior Physician, Natural infection versus vaccination: Differences in \nCOVID  antibody  responses  emerge,  THE  ROCKEFELLER  UNIVERSITY  (Aug.  24,  2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3ojdfNz; Don W. Hackett, Robert Carlson, M.D., Natural Immunity After Covid-19 Found \nDurable and Robust, PRECISION VACCINATIONS (updated Aug. 2, 2021), https://bit.ly/30goyOE; Sha-\nron Reynolds, Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH \n(Jan. 26, 2021), https://bit.ly/3kPYFwb. \n39 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 40 of 49 PageID #:  40\ncaused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced \nimmunity. And it is unclear if vaccination of an individual who has natural immunity will provide any \nperceptible benefit in fighting future infection.”); Yair Goldberg, et al., Protection of previous SARS-CoV-\n2 infection is similar to that of BNT162b2 vaccine protection: A three-month nationwide experience from Israel, \nMedrxiv (Apr. 24, 2021), https://bit.ly/3n8uXTe; see also, e.g., Martin Kuldorff and Jay Bhattacharya, \nThe ill-advised push to vaccinate the young, The Hill (June 17, 2021), https://bit.ly/2Z2ZpX6; R. R. Goel et \nal., mRNA vaccines include durable immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern, Science (Oct. 14, 2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3DXLS1K (“[B]oosting of pre-existing immunity from prior infection with mRNA vac-\ncination mainly resulted in a transient benefit to antibody titers with little-to-no long-term increase in \ncellular immune memory.”). \n168.  Third, CMS failed to estimate benefits to patients from requiring vaccines for those \nseveral steps removed from patient care and interaction. This failing is particularly glaring in light of \nthe Social Security Act’s focus on the health and wellbeing of patients rather than of healthcare workers.  \n169.  Fourth, the IFC is arbitrary and capricious because its rationales are flagrantly pre-\ntextual. As recounted above, the President has stated several times that the CMS Vaccine Mandate is \npart of a broader program aimed at increasing vaccination rates throughout American society, writ \nlarge. The IFC, however, eschews this rationale and tries (unsuccessfully and after-the-fact) to pigeon-\nhole the Mandate into the Social Security Act’s statutory factors. Such obvious regulatory reframing \nof the Mandate here leads to the inescapable conclusion that the IFC’s stated rationale is pretextual. \nAnd the presence of such blatant pretext is enough to render the CMS Vaccine Mandate arbitrary and \ncapricious. Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575-76 (2019). What’s more, the Administra-\ntion’s shifting rationales across all vaccine mandates demonstrate pretext. For example, the OSHA \nETS declares that vaccines are necessary to protect worker safety. But that rationale that would not \nbe sufficient under the Social Security Act. So CMS fabricated a new rationale to cram the mandate \n40 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 41 of 49 PageID #:  41\ninto the Social Security Act. Accepting CMS’s description of the Vaccine Mandate requires this Court \nto “‘exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens are free.’” Id. \n170.  Fifth, the CMS rule completely ignores State reliance interests. Plaintiff States have \noverwhelming reliance interests in their Medicaid systems. Specifically, the IFC ignores: (1) the Plain-\ntiff States’ reliance interests in their healthcare providers continuing to operate under existing rules \nwithout facing this new mandate that threatens to cause significant harm to the States’ citizens, par-\nticularly those in rural communities; (2) healthcare providers’ similar reliance interests in staffing their \nfacilities under the existing rules without facing this new mandate that threatens their workforce, the \nservices they provide, and their very existence; and (3) healthcare workers’ reliance interests, especially \nthe interests of minority workers in rural communities, in selecting a job and building a career under \nthe existing rules. The IFC is arbitrary and capricious because it utterly ignores these reliance interests. \nSee Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913-14 (2020).  \n171.  Sixth, the scope of the Vaccine Mandate is arbitrary and capricious. The mandate \nreaches many categories of healthcare facilities, such as psychiatric residential treatment facilities for \nindividual under 21 years of age, see 86 Fed. Reg. at 61576, that are not related to CMS’s asserted \ninterest in protecting elderly and infirm patients from the transmission of COVID-19. Indeed, CMS \nrecognizes that “risk of death from infection from an unvaccinated 75- to 84-year-old person is 320 \ntimes more likely than the risk for an 18- to 29-years old person.” Id. at 61610 n.247. Beyond that, the \nmandate applies to “any individual that . . . has the potential to have contact with anyone at the site of \ncare.” Id. at 61571 (emphasis added). This includes “staff that primarily provide services remotely via \ntelework” but “occasionally encounter fellow staff . . . who will themselves enter a health care facility.” \nId. at 61570. And the mandate also covers a contracted “crew working on a construction project whose \nmembers use shared facilities (restrooms, cafeteria, break rooms) during their breaks.” Id. at 61571. \nThe mandate’s vast reach is far removed from the purported purpose of protecting patient safety. \n41 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 42 of 49 PageID #:  42\n172.  Finally, CMS fails to weigh important civil liberty implications from forced vaccina-\ntion—the right to refuse medical treatment rooted in the doctrine of informed consent under state \nlaw3 and the impact (as opposed to merely the benefits) of the mandate on protected demographics \nin the health care labor market—or the principles of federalism threatened by imposing such far-\nreaching requirement on States without consultation or consent.     \n173.  For each of these independently sufficient reasons, the OMB Rule is arbitrary and \ncapricious.   \nCOUNT VI \nThe Vaccine Mandate Violates 42 U.S.C. §1395z \n174.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n175.  Under 42 U.S.C. §1395z, “the Secretary shall consult with appropriate State agencies \nand recognized national listing or accrediting bodies, and may consult with appropriate local agencies” \nwhen “carrying out his functions, relating to determination of conditions of participation by providers \nof services, under subsections (e)(9), (f)(4), (j)(15), (o)(6), (cc)(2)(I), and[] (dd)(2), and (mm)(1) of sec-\ntion 1395x of this title, or by ambulatory surgical centers under section 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title.” \n176.  As CMS acknowledges, this consultation requirement applies to the Vaccine Mandate \nbecause that mandate purports to establish conditions of participation for hospitals under 42 U.S.C. \n§1395x(e)(9), long-term-care facilities (also known as skilled nursing facilities) under 42 U.S.C. \n§1395x(j) and 42 U.S.C. §1395i–3, Home Health Agencies (“HHAs”) under 42 U.S.C. §1395x(o)(6), \n                                                 \n3 Louisiana, in particular, has a robust right “to refuse medical treatment” rooted in the State consti-\ntution. See La. Const. art. 1, §5; Hondroulis v. Schuhmacher, 553 So. 2d 398, 414 (La. 1989) (“we conclude \nthat the Louisiana Constitution’s right to privacy also provides for a right to decide whether to obtain \nor reject medical treatment”). \n42 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 43 of 49 PageID #:  43\nComprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (“CORFs”) under 42 U.S.C. §1395x(cc)(2), hos-\npices  under  42  U.S.C.  §1395x(dd)(2),  Critical  Access  Hospitals  (“CAHs”)  under  42  U.S.C. \n§1395x(mm)(1) and 42 U.S.C. §1395i–4(e), and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”) under 42 \nU.S.C. §1395k(a)(2)(F)(i). \n177.  CMS concedes that it did not comply with §1395z’s requirement that it “consult with \nappropriate State agencies.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567.  \n178.  CMS’s “inten[t] to engage in consultations with appropriate State agencies ... fol-\nlowing the issuance of th[e] rule,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567, does not satisfy 42 U.S.C. §1395z. The \nstatute requires that the consultation with States when the Secretary is “carrying out his functions[] \nrelating to determination of conditions of participation by providers of services,”  42 U.S.C. §1395z, \nor before a rule is issue. Yet the Secretary, via CMS, has already determined—without consulting with \nStates—that the vaccine mandate should be a condition of participation for providers. Since he did \nnot complete the statutory consultation requirement before adopting the IFC, the Secretary, acting \nthrough CMS, violated 42 U.S.C. §1395z. \n179.  The Vaccine Mandate thus violates 42 U.S.C. §1395z and must be vacated and en-\njoined.  \nCOUNT VII \nThe Vaccine Mandate Violates 42 U.S.C. §1302 \n180.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n181.  42 U.S.C. §1302(b)(1) requires that “[w]henever the Secretary [of HHS] publishes a \ngeneral notice of proposed rulemaking for any rule or regulation proposed under subchapter XVIII, \nsubchapter XIX, or part B of [title IX of the Social Security Act] that may have a significant impact \n43 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 44 of 49 PageID #:  44\non the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals, the Secretary shall prepare and \nmake available for public comment an initial regulatory impact analysis.” \n182.  42 U.S.C. §1302(b)(1) applies to the CMS Vaccine Mandate because CMS’s cited stat-\nutory authority for its vaccine mandate falls under Titles 18 and 19 of the Social Security Act and \nbecause the mandate will have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small \nrural hospitals.  \n183.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate threatens to exacerbate already devastating shortages in \nhealthcare staffing by forcing small rural hospitals to terminate their unvaccinated workers. That, in \nturn, will compel those hospitals to close certain divisions, cancel certain services, or shutter altogether. \nThose dire consequences stretch across rural America, and their collective force required CMS to \nprepare a regulatory impact analysis.  \n184.  Accordingly, the IFC violates 42 U.S.C. §1302(b)(1) because CMS did not prepare a \nregulatory impact analysis.  \nCOUNT VIII \nThe Vaccine Mandate Violates the Spending Clause \n185.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n186.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate is an unconstitutional condition on Plaintiff States’ receipt \nof federal funds.  \n187.  “[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must \ndo so unambiguously,” so “States [can] exercise their choice knowingly,” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. \nv. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  \n188.  Nothing in federal law gave States clear notice that a vaccine mandate would be a \ncondition of accepting federal Medicaid (or, where applicable, Medicare) funds.  \n44 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 45 of 49 PageID #:  45\n189.  And for the reasons discussed above, the Vaccine Mandate goes far beyond the federal \ninterest in patient health and wellbeing. Thus, the CMS Vaccine Mandate violates the Spending Clause \nbecause it is not necessary to preventing the spread of COVID-19. See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 579 (2012).  \n190.  Additionally, because noncompliance with the Vaccine Mandate threatens a substan-\ntial portion of Plaintiff States’ budgets, it violates the Spending Clause by leaving the States with no \nchoice but to acquiesce. See id. at 581-82 (“[T]he States have developed intricate statutory and admin-\nistrative regimes over the course of many decades to implement their objectives under existing Medi-\ncaid. It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of \none percent of South Dakota's budget left that State with a ‘prerogative’ to reject Congress’s desired \npolicy, ‘not merely in theory but in fact.’ The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall \nbudget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce \nin the Medicaid expansion.”).  \nCOUNT IX \nThe Vaccine Mandate Violates the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine \n191.  Plaintiff States repeat and incorporate by reference each of the Complaint’s allegations \nstated above. \n192.  The Tenth Amendment and structure of the Constitution deprive Congress of “the \n“the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States,” Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, \n1476 (2018), and forbid the federal government to commandeer State officers “into administering \nfederal law,” Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 928 (1997). \n193.  The Vaccine Mandate violates this doctrine by requiring Plaintiff States’ state-run hos-\npitals that are covered by the Mandate to either fire their unvaccinated employees or forgo all Medicaid \n(or, where applicable, Medicare) funding.  \n45 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 46 of 49 PageID #:  46\n194.  The Vaccine Mandate also commandeers the States because it forces State surveyors \nto enforce the Mandate by verifying healthcare provider compliance. This “dragoons” States into en-\nforcing federal policy by threatening Plaintiff States’ Medicaid (and, where applicable, Medicare) funds.  \nCOUNT X \nThe Vaccine Mandate Violates the Tenth Amendment \n195.  “The powers not delegated by the Constitution to the United States, nor prohibited \nby it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” U.S. Const. amend. X.  \n196.  No clause of the Constitution authorizes the federal government to impose the Vac-\ncine Mandate. Public health—and vaccinations in particular—have long been recognized as an aspect \nof police power reserved to the States, not the Federal Government. See, e.g., Jacobson v. Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24 (1905); see also Hillsborough Cty., 471 U.S. at 719 (“[T]he regulation of \nhealth and safety matters is primarily, and historically, a matter of local concern.”); S. Bay United Pente-\ncostal Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., concurring in the denial of application \nfor injunctive relief) (our Constitution principally entrusts “[t]he safety and the health of the people” \nto the politically accountable officials of the States “to guard and protect”); State v. Becerra, 2021 WL \n2514138, at *15 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2021) (“The history shows ... that the public health power ... was \ntraditionally understood — and still is understood — as a function of state police power.”). \n197.  By encroaching upon the States’ traditional police power, particularly without clear \nauthorization from Congress, Defendants have exceeded their authority and violated the Tenth \nAmendment.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nNOW, THEREFORE, Plaintiffs request an order and judgment: \n1.  Declaring, under 28 U.S.C. §2201, that the IFC is arbitrary and capricious and unlawful \nunder the APA; \n46 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970   Document 1   Filed 11/15/21   Page 47 of 49 PageID #:  47\n2.  Declaring, under 28 U.S.C. §2201, that the IFC is contrary to law and in excess of statutory \nauthority under the APA; \n3.  Declaring, under 28 U.S.C. §2201, that the Vaccine Mandate violates the APA and Social \nSecurity Act because it was promulgated without notice and comment;  \n4.  Declaring,  under  28  U.S.C.  §2201,  that  the  Vaccine  Mandate  violates  42  U.S.C. \n§§1302(b)(1), 1395, and 1395z; \n5.  Declaring that the Vaccine Mandate violates the Constitution;  \n6.  Holding the Vaccine Mandate unlawful and vacating it; \n7.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoining, without bond, Defendants from imposing the \nVaccine Mandate;  \n8.

See 86 Fed. Reg. 61555 (2021).  States \nacross the country sued to challenge the rule.  A district court in Missouri \npreliminarily enjoined enforcement of the rule as applied to the plaintiff\nstates in that case.  Missouri v. Biden, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2021 WL 5564501, at \n*15 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 29, 2021).  The next day, the district court in this case \ndid the same for every other state, effectively enjoining enforcement of the \nrule nationwide.  Louisiana v. Becerra, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2021 WL 5609846, \nat *17 (W.D. La. Nov. 30, 2021).  A panel of this court partially granted a stay \nof that injunction as to the non-party states, but denied a stay as to the \nfourteen plaintiffstates.  Louisiana v. Becerra, 20 F.4th 260, 264 (5th Cir. \n2021).  The Supreme Court later stayed both injunctions in their entirety and \nremanded the case back to this court.  Biden v. Missouri, 142 S. Ct. 647, 654\n55 (2022).   \nAlthough  this  court  had  not  responded  to  the  Supreme  Courts \nremand, Louisiana, joined by the remainder of the plaintiffstates, moved in \nthe district court for leave to amend its complaint.  Because our court had \njurisdiction over the case, the district court denied that motion and issued an \nindicative  ruling  noting  that  it  would  grant  the  motion  for  leave  to \namend.  Louisiana then moved in our court for a limited remand so the \ndistrict court could grant leave to amend the complaint and to allow those \nnew claims to be litigated in the district court.  The motions panel denied that \n \n* Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this \nopinion  should  not  be  published  and  is  not  precedent  except  under  the  limited \ncircumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4. \n2 \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 80   Filed 06/14/22   Page 6 of 6 PageID #:  1004\nNo. 21-30734 \nmotion,  allowing  the  merits  panel  to  resolve  the  remand  issue  and  the \npropriety of the district courts preliminary injunction. \nWe have jurisdiction to decide only whether the district court erred in \ngranting the earlier preliminary injunction that the Supreme Court has now \nstayed and remanded.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1).  The parties now agree \nthat  the  preliminary  injunction  should  be  vacated.    Accordingly,  we \nVACATE the district courts preliminary injunction and REMAND this \ncase to the district court for further consideration in the light of the Supreme \nCourt opinion.  In addition, we VACATE the motions panels order denying \nthe motion to remand as MOOT.  Finally, we express no opinion on whether \nthe district court should grant or deny leave to amend the complaint or on \nthe propriety of Louisianas other claims.   \nVACATED and REMANDED. \n3 ",

As explained in the Complaint and attached \nMemorandum supporting this motion, Defendants have acted without statutory authority, violated \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, violated the Social Security Act, violated the Congressional Review\nAct, and violated the Constitution by promulgating and implementing Medicare and Medicaid Programs; \nOmnibus COVID-19 Heath Care Staff Vaccinations, 86 Fed. Reg. 61555 (Nov. 5, 2021).  \nThis  Motion  is  made  on  the  grounds  specified  in  this  Motion,  the  Complaint,  the \naccompanying Memorandum of Law, the exhibits attached to the Complaint and to this Motion, all \nmatters  of  which  this Court  may  take  judicial  notice, and  on  such  other  and  further  oral  or \ndocumentary evidence as may be presented to the Court at or before the hearing on this Motion. \nPlaintiff States are substantially likely to prevail on the merits of their claims and preliminary injunctive \nrelief is necessary to avoid imminent and substantial injuries to their sovereign, quasi-sovereign, and \nproprietary interests. And the public interest and balance of harms favor an order compelling \nDefendants to follow the law.  \nFor these reasons and those explained in the attached Motion, Plaintiff States respectfully \nrequest a preliminary injunction restraining Defendants from implementing Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms; Omnibus COVID-19 Heath Care Staff Vaccinations, 86 Fed.

The Administration has announced three COVID-19 vaccine \nmandates to—as the President himself has confirmed—increase societal vaccination rates. There’s \njust one problem: no statute authorizes the federal Executive to mandate vaccines to increase societal \nimmunity. The Administration’s solution? Use statutory schemes never before interpreted to allow \nfederal vaccine mandates to shoehorn the President’s goals into the fabric of American society. In one \ninstance, the Administration grabbed an obscure workplace safety statute to impose a vaccine mandate \non 100 million Americans. That mandate suffers from so many patent constitutional and statutory \nproblems that the Fifth Circuit stayed it a day after it issued and reaffirmed its stay within a week. BST \nHoldings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, No. 21-60845 (Nov. 12, 2021).Second, the Administration triedto use the \nfederal procurement system to impose a vaccine mandate on another fifth of the American workforce. \nThat mandate, too, is already subject to multiple legal challenges. The third mandate is the one at issue \nhere: the Administration has coopted the Medicare and Medicaid system to impose a vaccine on 17 \nmillion healthcare workers.  \nBut the Social Security Act focuses on patient welfare and patient access to care. By forcing a \nsignificant number of healthcare workers to take the vaccine or exit the Medicare and Medicaid \nworkforce, CMS’s Vaccine Mandate harmsaccess to (and thus quality of) patient care. This “one-size-\nfits-all sledgehammer” expressly undermines the Social Security Act’s singular focus on providing \naccess to care. BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, slip op. at 6 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2021). By forcing healthcare \nworkers to choose “between their job(s) and their jab(s),” id. at 19, the Mandate completely ignores \nthe unprecedented labor shortage prevailing in the healthcare sector and patient wellbeing in favor of \nthe President’s policy of increasing societal vaccination rates.  \n1\n \n \n\nThe President’s attempt to use the Social Security Act to endanger patient welfare must be \nstopped. Aside from being fundamentally at odds with the Social Security Act, the Vaccine Mandate \nsuffers from a host of fatal flaws. It exceeds CMS’s statutory authority; violates the Social Security \nAct’s prohibition on regulations that control the selection and tenure of healthcare workers; is arbitrary \nand capricious; and violates the Spending Clause, the Anti-Commandeering doctrine, and the Tenth \nAmendment. Furthermore, CMS flouted the basic procedural requirements that Congress imposed \non  it,  including  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act’s  notice-and-comment  requirement,  the \nCongressional  Review  Act’s  publication-and-review  requirements,  and  the  Social  Security  Act’s \nconsultation and regulatory-impact-analysis requirements. The Vaccine Mandate will gravely harm the \nvulnerable persons whom Medicare and Medicaid were designed to protect—the poor, sick, and \nelderly—by forcing the termination of millions of essential “healthcare heroes.”  \nBACKGROUND \nI.  THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS. \nSince 1965, the federal government and the States have worked together to provide medical \nassistance to certain vulnerable populations under Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, \ncommonly known as Medicare and Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. §§1395-1396 et seq. Medicare is a federal \nprogram that pays for healthcare for the elderly; Medicaid is a cooperative state-federal program that \nhelpsStates finance medical carefor their poor and disabled citizens. The Social Security Act charges \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services with a wide range of administrative responsibilities related\nto maintaining the Medicare and Medicaid programs. See42 U.S.C. §301 et seq. It also delegates to the \nSecretary certain limited rulemaking authority, including—as most relevant here—the authority to \n“make and publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary \nto the efficient administration of the functions with which [he] is charged under this chapter.” 42 \nU.S.C.  §1302(a).  The  Centers  for  Medicare  &  Medicaid  Services,  a  federal  agency  within  the \n2\n \n \n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, has primary responsibility for overseeing Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. But Medicaid is a federal-state cooperative program, and States play an essential \nrole in administering it and ensuring compliance with CMS rules.\nII.  THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S VACCINE POLICY. \nAs President-Elect, Mr. Biden said he “d[i]dn’t think [vaccines] should be mandatory” and \n“wouldn’t demand [they] be mandatory.” Jacob Jarvis, Fact Check: Did Joe Biden Reject Idea of Mandatory \nVaccines in December 2020, Newsweek (Sept. 10, 2021), https://bit.ly/3ndyTn5. Until recently, his \nAdministration followed suit. See, e.g., Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, July 23, 2021, \nhttps://bit.ly/3pWnJVr (mandating vaccines “not the role of the federal government”).  \nBut as time passed, the President admitted that his “patience” began “wearing thin” with those \n“who haven’t gotten vaccinated.” The White House, Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the \nCOVID-19 Pandemic (Sept. 9, 2021), https://bit.ly/3Ey4Zj6. So in early September 2021, the \nAdministration abandoned persuasion for brute force and announced a series of unprecedented \nfederal mandates aimed at compelling most of the adult population of the United States to get a \nCOVID-19 vaccine. Id. His goal? To “increase vaccinations among the unvaccinated with new \nvaccination requirements.” Id.; see also The White House, Path Out of the Pandemic: President Biden’s \nCovid-19 Action Plan, https://bit.ly/3adkMXx; The White House, Vaccination Requirements Are \nHelping Vaccinate More People, Protect Americans from COVID-19, and Strengthen the Economy \n(Oct. 7, 2021), https://bit.ly/3lorbp0. \nIn part, those vaccine requirements include the actions challenged here. President Biden \nannounced he would impose—though unilateral executive action—a vaccine mandate on “a total of \n17 million workers.” Biden Sept. 9, 2021 Remarks, supra. As he explained, he’d already announced his \nintent to “requir[e] vaccinations that [sic] all nursing home workers who treat patients and Medicare \nand Medicaid,” contending that he “ha[s] that federal authority.” Id. Now, invoking “that same” \n3\n \n \n\npurported “authority,” he “expand[ed] that” edict “to cover those who work in hospitals, home\nhealthcare facilities, or other medical facilities.” Id. No contrary State law would stand in his way: If \nany “governor[s]” opposed the new federal mandates, he promised to “use [his] power as President \nto get them out of the way.” Id.\nIII.  THE CMSVACCINE MANDATE. \nOn November 5, 2021, CMS published an interim final rule requiring vaccination of staff by \n21  types  of  Medicare  and  Medicaid  providers  subject  to  Medicare  or Medicaid  conditions  of \nparticipation, conditions for coverage, or requirements for participation. Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms; Omnibus COVID-19 Heath Care Staff Vaccinations, 86 Fed. Reg. 61555, 61556 (Nov. 5, \n2021)(“the IFC” or “the Vaccine Mandate”).The rule applies the same substantive standards to each \nof the 21 types of entities. See id. at 61570, 61616-61627. As CMS put it, “we are issuing a common \nset of provisions for each applicable provider and supplier.” Id. at 61570. There are “no substantive \nregulatory differences across settings.” Id.  \nThe regulations themselves require that every type of covered entity “develop and implement \npolicies and procedures to ensure that all staff are fully vaccinated for COVID–19.” See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. \n§416.51(c). The policy must apply to every person “who provide[s] any care, treatment, or other \nservices for the [entity] and/or its patients,” including employees, contractors, trainees, students, and \nvolunteers. Id. §416.51(c)(1). To be exempted from the policy, a healthcare worker must “exclusively \nprovide” telehealth or support services “outside of the [entity’s] setting” and “not have any direct \ncontact with patients and other staff.” Id. §416.51(c)(2). The entity must ensure that, by December 6, \n2021, all such healthcare workers submit to at least one vaccine dose before they can provide “any \ncare, treatment, or other services for the [entity] and/or its patients.” Id. §416.51(c)(3)(i); 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61555. The entity must then ensure that, by January 4, 2022, all such healthcare workers “are fully \nvaccinated.” 42 C.F.R. §416.51(c)(3)(ii); 86 Fed. Reg. at 61555.  \n4\n \n \n\nAdditionally, the entity may exempt those granted temporary delays based on the CDC’s \nrecommendations or those who are eligible for exemptions under certain federal statutes. 42 C.F.R. \n§416.51(c)(3). But the entity must “track[] and securely document[] information provided by those \nstaff who have requested, and for whom the [entity] has granted, an exemption” or a temporary delay. \nId. §416.51(c)(3)(vi)-(vii). And it must ensure that all documentation “support[ing] staff requests for \nmedical exemptions from vaccination, has been signed and dated by a licensed practitioner” with \nspecific information about which vaccines are clinically contraindicated and a statement of reasons for \neach. Id. §416.51(c)(3)(viii). The entity must also implement a “process for tracking and securely \ndocumenting the COVID–19 vaccination status of all staff,” including their booster-shot status. Id. \n§416.51(c)(3)(iv)-(v). Finally, the entity must implement “[c]ontingency plans” for all persons who are \n“not fully vaccinated.” Id. §416.51(c)(3)(x). The regulations further mandate “that all staff COVID-19 \nvaccines must be appropriately documented by the provider or supplier,” and provide that “[e]xamples \nof acceptable forms of proof of vaccination include: ... State immunization information system \nrecord.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61572. \nThe only way for an entity to avoid those regulations is to forfeit its federal funding. And an \nentity that fails to comply fully with the regulations may face penalties up to and including “termination \nof the Medicare/Medicaid provider agreement,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61574—a death knell for most every \nprovider. This is the first—and only—mandatory vaccination program in the history of the Medicare \nor Medicaid programs. See id. at 61567 (“We have not previously required any vaccinations.”); id. at \n61568 (“We acknowledge that we have not previously imposed such requirements.”). \nIV.  IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND VULNERABLE AMERICANS. \nAccording to CMS, the Vaccine Mandate regulates over 10.3 million health care workers in \nthe United States. Id. at 61603. Of those, CMS estimates that roughly 2.4 million are currently \nunvaccinated. Id. at 61607. Those healthcare workers are the Vaccine Mandate’s targets. CMS’s \n5\n \n \n\nobjective is to coerce them into submission or cause them to lose their livelihoods. See id. at 61607 \n(“The most important inducement will be the fear of job loss, coupled with the examples set by fellow \nvaccine-hesitant workers who are accepting vaccination more or less simultaneously”); id.at 61608 (“it \nis possible there may be disruptions in cases where substantial numbers of health care staff refuse \nvaccination and are not granted exemptions and are terminated, with consequences for employers, \nemployees, and patients”). Though narrow medical and religious exemptions may be granted, the \nprogram’s goal is plain: vaccinate “nearly all health care workers.” Id. at 61569.     \nThis Mandate, however, portends catastrophic consequences for Medicaid beneficiaries’ \naccess to healthcare. Because workers in the healthcare industry have already faced prolonged pressure \nto undergo vaccination, and because many others have not submitted to employer-imposed mandates, \nit stands to reason that many of the 2.4 million unvaccinated healthcare workers the Mandate targets \nwill not submit to vaccination. If the Vaccine Mandate is not enjoined, these healthcare workers will \nlose their jobs. When that happens, America’s most vulnerable populations will lose access to \nnecessary medical care. CMS acknowledges that there are currently “endemic staff shortages for all \ncategories of employees at almost all kinds of health care providers and suppliers.” Id. at 61607. And \nof course, it acknowledges that “these may be made worse” when unvaccinated workers leave as a \nresult of the rule. Id. \nA few statistics illustrate the extent of the problem. Already 39% of nursing homes in Montana \nface staff shortages. See AARP Nursing Home COVID-19 Dashboard, AARP Public Policy Institute \n(Nov. 10, 2021), bit.ly/30lrvgs. That number exceeds 45% in Georgia, Idaho, and Utah, and ranges \nfrom 11% to 43% in the remaining Plaintiff States. Meanwhile, somewhere between 22% and 42% of \nhealthcare workers in those states are not fully vaccinated, despite having faced considerable pressure \nto get vaccinated. Id. CMS admits that it does not know how many unvaccinated workers will submit. \nId. at 61607, 61612. It brushes aside the specter of chronic healthcare shortages with bureaucratic \n6\n \n \n\njargon, suggesting that “while it is true that compliance with this rule may create some short-term \ndisruption of current staffing levels for some providers or suppliers in some places, there is no reason \nto think that this will be a net minus even in the short term, given the magnitude of normal turnover \nand the relatively small fraction of that turnover that will be due to vaccination mandates.”Id. at 61609. \nARGUMENT\nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff States “must show: (1) a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) a substantial threat of irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted; (3) \nthat the threatened injury outweighs any harm that the injunction might cause to the defendant; and \n(4) that the injunction will not disserve the public interest.” Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, \nMiss., 697 F.3d 279, 288 (5th Cir. 2012). Each factor weighs in the Plaintiff States’ favor. \nI.  PLAINTIFF STATES ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR CLAIMS.\nThe Vaccine Mandate suffers from a panoply of fatal procedural and substantive flaws. Each \nsuffices to justify enjoining it. \nA.   Defendants Issued the Vaccine Mandate Without Following Statutorily \nRequired Processes.   \nConsider first the Vaccine Mandate’s obvious procedural flaws. The Administrative Procedure \nAct requires agencies to publish notice of all “proposed rule making” in the Federal Register, id. \n§553(b), and to “give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through \nsubmission of written data, views, or arguments,” id. §553(c). Likewise, the Social Security Act requires \nthe HHS Secretary, before issuing the relevant types of regulations “in final form,” to “provide for \nnotice of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register and a period of not less than 60 days for \npublic comment thereon.” 42 U.S.C. §1395hh(b)(1). \nCMS does not dispute that the IFC is subject to those notice-and-comment requirements—\nand that CMS failed to comply with them. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61583. Instead, CMS’s sole reason for not \nconducting notice and comment is the APA’s “good cause” exception, which allows agencies to\n7\n \n \n\ndispense with notice-and-comment procedures only “when the agency for good cause finds (and \nincorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and \npublic procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. \n§553(b)(B); see id. §553(d)(3); 42 U.S.C. §§1395hh(b)(2)(C) and (e)(1)(B)(ii). CMS claims that this case \npresents that kind of emergency “as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency.” 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61555. CMS concludes that “[i]n light of [its] responsibility to protect the health and safety of \nindividuals providing and receiving care and services from Medicare-and Medicaid-certified providers \nand suppliers,” CMS is “compelled to require staff vaccinations for COVID-19 in these settings” \nwithout required notice and comment. Id. at 61560; see also id. at 61583-61586 (notice and comment \n“impracticable” because of “a combination of factors, including but not limited to failure to achieve \nsufficiently high levels of vaccination based on voluntary efforts and patchwork requirements, \npotential harm to patients from unvaccinated health-care workers, and continuing strain on the health \ncare system and known efficacy and safety of available vaccines”). \nCMS’s view contravenes “well established” precedent that “the ‘good cause’ exception to \nnotice-and-comment should be read narrowly in order to avoid providing agencies with an ‘escape \nclause’ from the requirements Congress prescribed.” United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 928 (5th \nCir. 2011). “[C]ircumstances justifying reliance on this exception are ‘indeed rare’ and will be accepted \nonly after the court has ‘examine[d] closely proffered rationales justifying the elimination of public \nprocedures.’” Council of the S. Mountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 473, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (citation \nomitted). Courts therefore restrict agencies’ use of the “good cause” exception “to emergency \nsituations,” Mack Trucks, Inc. v. E.P.A., 682 F.3d 87, 93 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (citation omitted), such as \nwhere a “delay would imminently threaten life or physical property” or risk “fiscal calamity,” Sorenson \nCommc’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706-07 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  \n8\n \n \n\nCMS’s good-cause explanation falls far below those exacting standards. In claiming that it \nmust immediately implement the Vaccine Mandate, CMS ignored that it waited almost two months \nafter President Biden’s directive before promulgating the IFC. Cf. BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 7 \n(staying OSHA ETS mandate and noting same two-month delay). Beyond that, CMS’s finding that \nthe Vaccine Mandate is necessary was undermined by that same delay. See id. at 7 n.11 (“One could \nquery how an ‘emergency’ could prompt such a ‘deliberate’ response.”). Vaccines have had a Food & \nDrug Administration Emergency Use Authorization for almost a year (as CMS knows, see 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61584), yet CMS did not impose this Mandate until two months after the President instructed it to \ndo so as part of his “six-point plan” to federalize public-health policy. Here, no “emergency” sufficient \nto justify CMS’s dispensing with proper rulemaking exists. BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 7 (“The \nMandate’s stated impetus—a purported ‘emergency’ that the entire globe has now endured for nearly \ntwo years, and which OSHA itself spent nearly two months responding to—is unavailing as well.”); \nFlorida v. Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138, at *45 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2021) (concluding that the COVID-19 \npandemic was insufficient for “good cause”); Regeneron Pharms. v. HHS, 510 F. Supp. 3d 29, 48 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2020) (similar). 1\nBy all measures, COVID-19 infection rates, hospitalizations, and fatalities have declined from \nother, earlier times when the Administration declined to act. See, e.g., Joshua R. Miller, Los Angeles \nCounty sheriff blasts vaccine mandate causing ‘mass exodus,’N.Y. Post (Oct. 29, 2021), https://bit.ly/3n5I9tm. \nAnd the pandemic is a feeble excuse for avoiding transparency and public input considering the year-\nlong public debate over mandatory vaccines. See BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 7 n.10 (“‘[I]f human \nnature and history teach anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim \nindefinite states of emergency.’”); see also Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. v. DHS, 2020 WL 7043877, at \n                                                \n1 Given the IFC’s impact on State interests, failure to conduct notice and comment was not \nharmless. See Johnson, 632 F.3d at 931. \n9\n \n \n\n*8 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2020); see also Ass'n of Cmty. Cancer Centers v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 496 (D. \nMd. 2020) (“CMS here relies more on speculation than on evidence to establish that the COVID-19 \npandemic has created an emergency in Medicare Part B drug pricing sufficient to justify dispensing \nwith valuable notice and comment procedures.”). For the same reasons, CMS’s reliance on the good-\ncause exception to avoid the Congressional Review Act’s procedures was unlawful. See 5 U.S.C. §808.\nB.   The Vaccine Mandate Is Beyond the Executive’s Authority and Contrary to \nLaw. \nThe Vaccine Mandate also must be enjoined because it exceeds the Executive’s statutory \nauthority. The Supreme Court “expect[s] Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency \ndecisions of vast ‘economic and political significance.’” Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 \n(2014). Nor can the Executive “bring about an enormous and transformative expansion in [its] \nregulatory authority without clear congressional authorization.” Id.; see also Food & Drug Admin. v. Brown \n& Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 159 (2000) (rejecting Executive claim to “jurisdiction to \nregulate an industry constituting a significant portion of the  American economy”  absent clear \ncongressional authorization); Whitman v. Am. Trucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001)(Congress \n“does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions”).\nDefendants, however, identify no clear statutory authority authorizing the Vaccine Mandate. \nThe Fifth Circuit has already confirmed this fatal flaw in the Biden Administration’s parallel and similar \nattempt to mandate vaccinations for employees of 100-person companies. BST Holdings v. OSHA, No. \n21-60845, slip op. at 6 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2021). That conclusion is no surprise given the lack of \nprecedent for OSHA’s mandate; likewise, never in CMS’s historyhas it relied upon its Social Security \nAct authority to mandate healthcare worker vaccination. See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567. Indeed, it is \nhard to recall any time in American history when any federal entity has claimed the power to force \n10\n \n \n\nmillions of Americans to inject themselves with something against their wills. Cf. NFIB. v. Sebelius, 567 \nU.S. 519, 608(2012)(Ginsburg, J., dissenting in relevant part) (disavowing “implication that Congress \nmay justify under the Commerce Clause a mandate to buy other products and services”). The Court \nshould view CMS’s attempt to do so now with heightened caution. “[T]here is a first time for \neverything,” but “sometimes ‘the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem ... is the \nlack of historical precedent.’” NFIB, 567 U.S. at 549. \nIn any event, CMS’s first Vaccine Mandate fails under the SSA’s plain terms. Its conferrals of \ngeneral rulemaking authority do not contain a clear statement authorizing the Vaccine Mandate. CMS \nrelies principally upon Section 1102 and Section 1871, but those are mere general authorizations to \n“prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance \nprograms,” 42 U.S.C. §1395hh(a)(1), and to “make and publish such rules and regulations, not \ninconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary to the efficient administration” of the Medicare \nprogram,  42  U.S.C.  §1302(a).  Nothing  in  those  grants  of  general  rulemaking  authority  clearly\nauthorizes an action with the vast economic and political significance of a national vaccine mandate.\nImplicitly acknowledging that failing, CMS also cites 15 separate statutes to try to justify \napplying the Vaccine Mandate to specific types of facilities. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567; see Doc. 1. ¶¶ 47-\n66. Not one of those statutes, however, expressly authorizes CMS to impose a vaccine mandate. \nInstead,  they  grant  mine-run  authority  to  govern  unexceptional  day-to-day  aspects  of  certain \nhealthcare  facilities:  for  example,  to  specify  “standards”  for  “active  treatment”  of  “inpatient \npsychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21,” 42 U.S.C. §1396d(h)(1)(B)(i); or “standards” \nfor  “provid[ing]  health  or  rehabilitative  services  for  [intellectually  disabled]  individuals”  at \nIntermediate Care Facilities, id. §1396d(d)(1); or “health, safety, and other standards” at Ambulatory \nSurgical Centers, id. §1395k(a)(2)(F)(i); or standards for “the health and safety of individuals enrolled” \nin Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, id. §§1395eee(f), 1396u–4(f), or Rural Health Clinics, \n11\n \n \n\nid. §1395x(aa)(2)(K), or Hospitals, id. §1395x(e)(9), or Hospices, id. §1395x(dd)(2)(G). Even passing \nscrutiny of each of those cited secondary authorities readily confirms that those Social Security Act \nprovisions are “a wafer-thin reed on which to rest such sweeping power.” Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v. \nHHS, 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021). That’s hardly sufficient giventhe serious constitutional issues that \nthe Vaccine Mandate raises. Cf. BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, No. 21-60845, 2021 WL 5166656, at \n*1 (5th Cir. Nov. 6, 2021) (OSHA ETS raises “grave statutory and constitutional issues”). In fact, \ngiven the Mandate’s subject matter, it triggers three separate clear statement rules—and fails all three.  \nFirst, Congress will “not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance” \nunless it “conveys its purpose clearly.” United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349 (1971); see also Boelens v. \nRedman Homes, Inc., 748 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir. 1984) (“Absent a clear statement of intention from \nCongress, there is a presumption against a statutory construction that would significantly affect the \nfederal-state balance.”). The Mandate changes the federalism balance by intruding upon the States’ \npolice power over public health,2 BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 16-17 (“[T]o mandate that a person \nreceive  a  vaccine  or  undergo  testing  falls  squarely  within  the  States’  police  power.”), and \ncommandeering States to enforce a federal policy, NFIB, 567 U.S. at 577. Accordingly, the Act must \nauthorize the Mandate unambiguously or not at all. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857-58 \n                                                \n2 Since the Founding, pandemic response—particularly mandatory inoculation methods—has \nbeen a State and local issue. See State v. Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138 at *15 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2021) \n(“The history shows ... that the public health power ... was traditionally understood—and still is \nunderstood—as a function of state police power.”);  see also id. at *11 (citing CDC, History of \nQuarantine (Feb. 12, 2007)) (“In the early years of the republic, the federal role in curbing infectious \ndisease extended to little more than support for the effort of local government.”). To the extent \nCongress has tried to address vaccination and pandemic control through mandatory federal means, it \nhas been through authorities granted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Food \nand Drug Administration rather than through the Social Security Act. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §264; 21 \nU.S.C. §360bbb-3. But even there, federal courts have twice checked CDC for overreaching on \nCOVID-19. See Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. at 2486-90; Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138 at *15. \n12\n \n \n\n(2014)(“‘[I]t is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of Congress’ intent before finding that \nfederal law overrides’ the ‘usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers.’”). It’s the latter.\nSecond, because the Executive cannot unilaterally “push the limit of congressional authority,” \ncourts require a clear statement before adopting an Executive interpretation that would raise serious \nconstitutional issues. Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cnty. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engr’s, 531 U.S. 159,172-\n73 (2001). Besides raising serious Spending Clause and Tenth Amendment problems, see infraSec. I.D, \nthe Vaccine Mandate raises grave constitutional questions under the Nondelegation Doctrine. If \nDefendants are right that the Social Security Act grants authority for federal vaccine mandates, both \n“the degree of agency discretion” and “the scope of the power congressionally conferred” by the Act \nwould be limitless. Id. at 475. Congress, however, lacks authority to delegate “unfettered power” over \nthe American economy to an executive agency.3 Tiger Lily, LLC v. HHS, 5 F.4th 666, 672 (6th Cir. \n2021); see also BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 6; Florida v. Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138, at *20, *37. \nAccordingly, Congress’s purported “delegation ... of authority” in the SSA “to decide major policy \nquestions”—such  as  whether  all  healthcare  workers  must  be  vaccinated—would  violate  the \nnondelegation doctrine. Paul v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 342 (2019) (statement of Justice Kavanaugh \nrespecting the denial of certiorari); see also Tiger Lily, 5 F.4th at 672 (“[T]o put ‘extra icing on a cake \nalready frosted,’ the government’s interpretation of § 264(a) could raise a nondelegation problem.”); \nState v. Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138, at *37.\nThird, Congress must clearly delegate power to the Executive to address issues of “deep \neconomic and political significance.” King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015). If vaccine mandates are \nnot of deep economic and political significance, it’s hard to imagine what is. The Vaccine Mandate \naffects hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds and grants. And “[d]ebates over the Biden \n                                                \n3 To see where such unfettered power can lead, see Reuters, Austria orders non-vaccinated people \ninto COVID-19 lockdown (Nov. 14, 2021), https://tmsnrt.rs/3Hln1HL.   \n13\n \n \n\nAdministration’s forthcoming vaccine mandate roiled the country throughout much of the Fall.” BST \nHoldings, No. 21-60845, at 3 n.4. Accordingly, “the sheer scope of [Defendants’] claimed authority \nunder [the Act] counsel[s] against the Government’s interpretation.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, 141 S. Ct. \nat2489; BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 17-18 (“The Mandate derives its authority from an old statute \nemployed in a novel manner, imposes nearly $3 billion in compliance costs, involves broad medical \nconsiderations that lie outside of OSHA’s core competencies, and purports to definitively resolve one \nof today’s most hotly debated political issues.”). \nThe statutory authority cited by CMS simply does not run this gauntlet of clear statement rules. \nIf Congress wishes to alter federal-state relations; press its Article I powers; and regulate an area of \nimmense political, social, and economic importance, it must do so clearly. “It is up to Congress,” not \nDefendants, “to decide whether the public interest merits further action here.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors, \n141 S. Ct. at 2489; cf. BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 18 (“There is no clear expression of congressional \nintent in §655(c) to convey OSHA such broad authority, and this court will not infer one. Nor can the \nArticle II executive breathe new power into OSHA’s authority—no matter how thin patience wears.”).  \nThe Vaccine Mandate violates several discrete sections of the Social Security Act. First, under \n42 U.S.C. §1395z, “the Secretary shallconsult with appropriate State agencies and recognized national \nlisting or accrediting bodies, and may consult with appropriate local agencies,” when “carrying out his \nfunctions, relating to determination of conditions of participation by providers of services, under \nsubsections (e)(9), (f)(4), (j)(15), (o)(6), (cc)(2)(I), and[] (dd)(2), and (mm)(1) of section 1395x of this \ntitle, or by ambulatory surgical centers under section 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title.” CMS acknowledges\nthat this consultation requirement applies to the Vaccine Mandate—and concedes that it did not \ncomply with it. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567. CMS’s “inten[t] to engage in consultations with appropriate \nState agencies ... following the issuance of th[e] rule,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567, is no adequate substitute; \n14\n \n \n\nthe statute plainly requires consultation with States before a rule is issued whenever the Secretary is \n“carrying out his functions[] relating to determination of conditions of participation by providers of \nservices.” 42 U.S.C. §1395z. \nSecond, 42 U.S.C. §1395 provides that nothing in Title 18 of the Social Security Act “shall be \nconstrued to authorize any Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or control over the \npractice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are provided, or over the selection, \ntenure, or compensation of any officer or employee of any institution, agency, or person providing \nhealth services; or to exercise any supervision or control over the administration or operation of any \nsuch institution, agency, or person.” The Vaccine Mandate violates 42 U.S.C. §1395 by purporting to \nauthorize federal officials at CMS to exercise “supervision” and “control” over the “selection” and \n“tenure” of employees (including state employees) and other persons “providing health services.” It \ndoes so by prohibiting covered healthcare facilities from hiring unvaccinated employees and forcing \nthose facilities to terminate—and thus end the tenure of—unvaccinated employees. The Vaccine \nMandate also violates §1395 because it authorizes federal officials at CMS to exercise “supervision” \nand “control” over the “administration” and “operation” of institutions, agencies, and persons that \nprovide health services (including state facilities and employees) by dictating the hiring and firing \npolicies of those institutions for unvaccinated workers.\nThird, 42 U.S.C. §1302(b)(1) requires that “[w]henever the Secretary [of HHS] publishes a \ngeneral notice of proposed rulemaking for any rule or regulation proposed under subchapter XVIII, \nsubchapter XIX, or part B of [title IX of the Social Security Act] that may have a significant impact \non the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals, the Secretary shall prepare and \nmake available for public comment an initial regulatory impact analysis.” 42 U.S.C. §1302(b)(1) applies \nbecause the Mandate will have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small \nrural hospitals. The CMS Vaccine Mandate threatens to exacerbate already devastating shortages in \n15\n \n \n\nhealthcare staffing by forcing small rural hospitals to terminate their unvaccinated workers. That, in \nturn, will compel those hospitals to close certain divisions, cancel certain services, or shutter altogether. \nThose dire consequences stretch across rural America, and their collective force required CMS to \nprepare a regulatory impact analysis. It refused to do so.\nC.   The Vaccine Mandate Is Arbitrary and Capricious. \nThe APA commands courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and \nconclusions found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. §706(2)(A). To clear \nthat hurdle, federal administrative agencies must “engage in ‘reasoned decisionmaking.’” Texas v. \nUnited States, 2021 WL 723856, at *39. The Vaccine Mandate is arbitrary and capricious for several \nindependently sufficient reasons.  \nFirst, the IFC ignores the Social Security Act’s focus on patient wellbeing rather than the health \nof providers. Each prong of the President’s vaccination policy is aimed at the same overarching goal: \nincreasing individual vaccination rates. See Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the COVID-19 \nPandemic” (Sept. 9, 2021), https://bit.ly/3oI0pKr (CMS Vaccine Mandate part of President’s plan to \n“increase  vaccinations  among  the  unvaccinated  with  new  vaccination  requirements”).  But the \nevidence, even that relied upon by CMS, shows that mandating vaccines will harm patient health and \nwellbeing. For example, the Mandate will cause nursing home staff shortages that will significantly \nharm patient health and well-being. There is already a critical shortage of healthcare workers. In \nMontana alone, there is already a 39% nurse and aide shortage in nursing homes. AARP, “AARP \nNursing Home COVID-19 Dashboard” (updated Nov. 10, 2021), https://bit.ly/3HhAWyy. And \nstudies show that Vaccine Mandates will exacerbate those shortages. See Liz Hamel, et al., KFF \nCOVID-19  Vaccine  Monitor:  Oct,  2021,  Kaiser  Family  Foundation  (Oct.  28,  2021), \nhttps://bit.ly/3wEiJWN; Chris Isidore & Virginia Langmaid, 72% of unvaccinated workers vow to quit if \nordered to get vaccinated, CNN.com (Oct. 28, 2021), https://cnn.it/3HdgDlw. Those outcomes do “not \n16\n \n \n\nrest on mere speculation about the decisions of third parties” but instead on “the predictable effect \nof Government action on the decisions of third parties,” meaning CMS a fortiori knowsthe Mandate’s \ndeleterious effects on the parties it wants to regulate. Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, \n2566 (2019).\nConsider just a few real-world examples from Plaintiff States—which notice-and-comment \nrulemaking would have disclosed to CMS, had the agency deigned to conduct it. As one Hospital \nDirector put it, “I fear that our rural hospital will soon face closing the doors permanently” because\nof the Mandate. Ex. F ¶5; see also Ex. K ¶7 (“While the percentage of over-all employees that the \nhospital will lose because of the mandate may not be significant, because we have very small \ndepartments and employee specialties are not interchangeable, losing even 10 or 20 employees, which \nis a likely outcome of the mandate, may have devastating results to our ability to provide the level of \ncare we have provided in the past.”). The owner of a skilled nursing facility in Pollock, Louisiana, that \nemploys 56 staff members verifies “that approximately 43% of [its] employees are not vaccinated with \nthe coronavirus vaccine”; that “most, if not all,” of those employees will “either be unwilling or unable \nto take the vaccine against coronavirus as mandated by CMS”; and that if it “lose[s] 43% of our \nworkforce, [it] will be unable to provide safe and efficient care to our residents,” raising the specter \nthat “our rural nursing facility will soon face closing the doors permanently.” Ex. A ¶¶4-5; see also Rural\nCOVID patients in ICUs at higher risk of dying than urban counterparts, according to WVU researcher, WVU \nToday (Nov. 11, 2021), https://bit.ly/3HnFB1Q. Similarly, the CEO of two rural hospitals in Utah \nreports that the Mandate “may be devastating” and the loss of unvaccinated employees it will produce \n“may force the cessation of some hospital services and possibly the closure of some departments, all \nof which will reduce the amount and quality of healthcare services offered to our patients.” Ex. J ¶5; \nEx. I ¶7 (noting likely loss of 20 or 30 employees leading to “devastating results” to patient care);Ex. \nH ¶5 (noting Utah healthcare worker shortage at crisis level); Ex. O¶5-9.  \n17\n \n \n\nState officials confirm the damage to patient wellbeing caused by the Mandate. The Director \nof the Utah State Hospital and Utah Developmental Center similarly confirmed that “Utah already \nhas a serious direct care shortage in both its State Hospital and State Developmental center that is \njeopardizing client and staff safety and care.” Ex. G¶11. “[T]he number of vacant staff positions” at \nthose facilities “has roughly doubled from September 2020 to September 2021,” jumping “from 74to \n141” at the State Hospital and “from 50 to 109” at the State Development Center. Id. ¶12. “These \nentities cannot afford to lose any additional staff,” id. ¶13, but “[i]mplementation of a vaccine mandate \nwithout a weekly testing option will likely cause resignations of staff members,” and “even a few \nresignations will exacerbate an understaffing problem at already exists,” id. ¶15; see also Ex. N ¶4-5.\nThe CFO of the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) estimates that “roughly 40% of our \ncovered unvaccinated employees will resign” if the Mandate is implemented, which “jeopardizes the \nability of ADPH ... to perform its home-health services to a particularly vulnerable population.” Ex. \nB ¶¶12-13; see also Ex. D ¶¶9-11; Ex. E ¶¶12-18. Patient wellbeing is not served by preventing the \nhiring of qualified healthcare workers—a fact CMS would have known had it bothered to make its \nrequired consultations.  \nSecond, the Secretary failed to consider or arbitrarily rejected obvious alternatives to a Vaccine \nMandate. The Secretary rejected daily or weekly testing. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61614 (“We have reviewed \nscientific evidence on testing and found that vaccination is a more effective infection control \nmeasure.”). That conclusion is facially deficient: it fails to identify the “evidence” supporting this \ndecision, or to explain how such evidence relates to the goal of protecting workers or patients in a \nhealthcare setting. It also contradicts existing evidence in the States. Since July 2021, employees at the \nUtah State Hospital and Utah State Developmental Center have required to be vaccinated or take a \nweekly COVD-19 test; 14% of employees at the Hospital (119 employees) and 30% of employees at \nthe Developmental Center (164 employees) take the test each week, Ex. G ¶¶7-9, and that alternative \n18\n \n \n\napproach has created no apparent harm to patients or staff. That’s just one bit of evidence confirming:\nthere is no evidence that vaccination is the only acceptable way to protect workers and patients in a \nhealthcare setting.CMS’s careful wording revealsas much;its goal here is “effective infection control,” \n86 Fed. Reg. at 61614, not protection in any particular environment. The rejection of natural immunity \nas a basis for exemption is equally dismissive and unsupported. See id. For example, a highly reported \nstudy from Israel involving review of 74,000 cases of infection concluded that a person with natural \nimmunity is 27 times less likely to be reinfected that a vaccinated person. See Ex. L ¶¶29-35; Ex. P \n¶¶47-53. Other studies support this conclusion. Id. (collecting sources).  \nThird, CMS fails to adequately explain its departure from its—and the Administration’s—prior \npositions. As recounted above, President Biden consistently refused to impose a vaccine mandate \nthroughout the height of the pandemic. And CMS also considered and rejected vaccine mandates and \neven mandatory vaccine provision. See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. 44774, 45380 (Aug. 13, 2021) (“We again \nnote that this measure does not require HCP to receive a COVID–19 vaccine and it does not require \nHCP to report their vaccination status.”); 86 Fed. Reg. 26306, 26314 (May 13, 2021) (“We believe it \nwould be overly burdensome to mandate that each LTC facility educate and offer the COVID–19 \nvaccine to all individuals who enter the facility.”). Apart from briefly acknowledging that it has “not \npreviously required any vaccinations,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61568, CMS offers nothing beyond conclusory \nstatements for departing from this past position, State v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 556 (5th Cir. 2021)\n(“‘Stating that a factor was considered ... is not a substitute for considering it.’”). Because “agencies \nmust typically provide a ‘detailed explanation’ for contradicting a prior policy,” CMS’s failure to do so \nimbues the IFC with the “hallmarks of unlawful agency actions.” also BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at \n16-17. \nFourth, the IFC’s rationale is flagrantly pretextual. As recounted above, the President has stated \nseveral times that the CMS Vaccine Mandate is part of a broader program aimed at increasing \n19\n \n \n\nvaccination rates. The IFC, however, eschews this rationale and tries (unsuccessfully) to shoehornthe \nMandate into the Social Security Act’s statutory factors. The presence of such blatant pretext is enough \nto render the CMS Vaccine Mandate arbitrary and capricious. New York, 139 S. Ct. at 2575-76. What’s \nmore, the Administration’s shifting rationales across all vaccine mandates demonstrate pretext. For \nexample, the OSHA ETS declares that vaccines are necessary to protect worker safety. But that \nrationale that would not suffice under the Social Security Act, so CMS contrived a new rationale—\npatient safety—to shoehorn the Mandate into the Social Security Act. Accepting CMS’s description \nof the Vaccine Mandate would require this Court to “‘exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens \nare free.’” Id.; see also BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 16-17 (“OSHA’s reversal here strains credulity, \nas does its pretextual basis.”). \nFifth, the CMS rule ignores Plaintiff States’ overwhelming reliance interests in their Medicare \nand Medicaid systems. Specifically, the IFC ignores: (1) the Plaintiff States’ reliance interests in their \nhealthcare providers continuing to operate under existing rules without facing this new Mandate that \nthreatens  to  significantly  harm  the  States’  citizens,  particularly  those  in  rural  communities; \n(2) healthcare providers’ similar reliance interests in staffing their facilities under the existing rules \nwithout facing this new Mandate that threatens their workforce, the services they provide, and their \nvery existence, Ex. F ¶¶4-5; and (3) healthcare workers’ reliance interests, especially the interests of \nminority workers in rural communities, in selecting a job and building a career under the existing rules. \nThe IFC is arbitrary and capricious because it ignores those reliance interests. See DHS v. Regents of the \nUniv. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913-14 (2020).  \nSixth, the Vaccine Mandate’s scope is arbitrary and capricious. The Mandate reaches many \ncategories of healthcare facilities, such as psychiatric residential treatment facilities for individual under \n21 years of age, see 86 Fed. Reg. at 61576, that are not related to CMS’s asserted interest in protecting \nelderly and infirm patients from the transmission of COVID-19. Indeed, CMS recognizes that “risk \n20\n \n \n\nof death from infection from an unvaccinated 75-to 84-year-old person is 320 times more likely than \nthe risk for an 18- to 29-years old person.” Id. at 61610 n.247. Beyond that, the Mandate applies to \n“any individual that . . . has the potential to have contact with anyone at the site of care.” Id.at 61571 \n(emphasis added). This includes “staff that primarily provide services remotely via telework” but \n“occasionally encounter fellow staff . . . who will themselves enter a health care facility.” Id. at 61570. \nAnd the Mandate also covers a contracted “crew working on a construction project whose members \nuse shared facilities (restrooms, cafeteria, break rooms) during their breaks.”  Id. at 61571. The \nMandate’s vast reach is far removed from the purported purpose of protecting patient safety. \nFor each of those independently sufficient reasons, the OMB Rule is arbitrary and capricious.   \nD.  The Contractor Vaccine Mandate Violates the Spending Clause, Tenth \nAmendment, and Anti-Commandeering Doctrine.  \n“[I]f Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so \nunambiguously,” so “States [can] exercise their choice knowingly.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981). Nothing in federal law gave States clear notice that a vaccine mandate \nwould be a condition of accepting federal Medicare or Medicaid funds. And for the reasons discussed \nabove, the Vaccine Mandate goes far beyond the federal interest in patient health and wellbeing. Thus, \nthe CMS Vaccine Mandate violates the Spending Clause because it is not necessary to preventing the \nspread of COVID-19. See NFIB, 567 U.S. at 579. Additionally, because noncompliance with the \nVaccine Mandate threatens a substantial portion of Plaintiff States’ budgets, it violates the Spending \nClause by leaving the States with no choice but to acquiesce. See id.at 581-82 (“The threatened loss of \nover 10 percent of a State’s overall budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the States \nwith no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.”).\nThe Mandate also violates the Tenth Amendment’s Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. The \nTenth Amendment and the Constitution’s structure deprive Congress of “the power to issue direct \n21\n \n \n\norders to the governments of the States,” Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1476 (2018), and forbid\nthe federal government to commandeer State officers “into administering federal law,” Printz v. United \nStates, 521 U.S. 898, 928 (1997). Just like the now-stayed OSHA ETS—which “commandeers U.S. \nemployers to compel millions of employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine or bear the burden of \nweekly testing,” BTS Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 17—the Vaccine Mandate violates this doctrine by \nrequiring Plaintiff States’ state-run hospitals covered by the Mandate to either fire their unvaccinated \nemployees or lose all Medicare and Medicaid funding. The Vaccine Mandate also commandeers the \nStates because it forces State surveyors to enforce the Mandate by verifying healthcare provider \ncompliance. E.g., Ex. B ¶18; Ex. M. This “dragoons” States into enforcing federal policy by threatening \nPlaintiff States’ Medicare and Medicaid funds in violation of the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine.  \nII.  PLAINTIFF STATES WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM WITHOUT AN INJUNCTION. \n“To show irreparable injury if threatened action is not enjoined, it is not necessary to \ndemonstrate that harm is inevitable and irreparable.” Humana, Inc. v. Avram A. Jacobson, M.D., P.A., \n804 F.2d 1390, 1394 (5th Cir. 1986). Instead, plaintiffs need only show that they are “likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.” Benisek v. Lamone, 138 S. Ct. 1942, 1944 (2018). \nThe evidence here confirms that the Vaccine Mandate will cause the Plaintiff States to suffer a barrage \nof irreparable harms. \nFirst, the Mandate causes irreparable economic injuries. “[C]omplying with a regulation later \nheld invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.” Texas \nv. E.P.A., 829 F.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Fifth Circuit \nrecently explained, that is “because federal agencies generally enjoy sovereign immunity for any \nmonetary damages,” so an injured party has no redress. Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. v. F.D.A., \n2021 WL 4955257, at *8 (5th Cir. Oct. 26, 2021); see also Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 186 (5th \nCir. 2015) (financial injury from federal government irreparable). Unless enjoined, the Mandate will \n22\n \n \n\nforce the Plaintiff States’ own facilities to dedicate considerable resources in the coming weeks to \nimplementing arduous tracking and documentation processes. See Ex. L ¶¶12, 17-20. It forces them \nto fire theirworkerswho do not wish to submit to vaccination no later than December 6. As a natural \nand foreseeable result, the Plaintiff States’ healthcare facilities will reduce services and lose revenue.\nE.g., Ex. C ¶¶11-12.And because Defendants enjoy sovereign immunity, “[n]o mechanism here exists \nfor the [Plaintiffs] to recover the compliance costs they will incur if the Final Rule is invalidated.” \nTexas v. E.P.A., 829 F.3d at 434. The resulting unemployment will also likely cause the Plaintiff States \nto lose tax revenue and spend more on public benefits. BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 18-19. \nSecond, the Mandate injures the States’ sovereign interests by purporting to preempt their laws. \nAn injury to a State’s sovereign interest is “necessarily” irreparable. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Greater \nTex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th Cir. 2013). A State’s interest in “in not being \npressured to change its law” is sufficiently “related to its sovereignty” for these purposes. Texas v. \nUnited States, 787 F.3d 733, 752 n.38 (5th Cir. 2015); see also Veasey v. Abbott, 870 F.3d 387, 391 (5th \nCir. 2017) (“[T]he State necessarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the \nenforcement of its laws.”). Here, Plaintiff States will have to change their own laws and policies to \ncomply with the Mandate. The Mandate purports to directly preempt Montana’s H.B. 702, which \nprohibits  discrimination  based  on  vaccination  status;  Indiana’s  H.B.  1405,  which  prohibits \ngovernment entities from requiring anyone—including employees—to show proof of vaccination; \nand Utah’s H.B. 308, which prohibits state agencies from conditioning employment on vaccination. \nSee 86 Fed. Reg. at 61613. The Mandate also purports to compel the States’ own providers to \nimplement new policies and the States’ own surveyors to enforce new rules in the place of those that \nthey would implement and enforce absent the Mandate. Ex. M ¶7; BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 19.   \nThird, the Mandate economically injures the Plaintiff States’ citizens and thereby injures the \nStates’ parens patriae interests. A State may assert those injuries of its citizen in which it has a “quasi-\n23\n \n \n\nsovereign interest.” Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, ex rel., Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 607 (1982). A \nState  has  a  paradigmatic  sovereign  interest  in  “the  health  and  well-being—both  physical  and \neconomic—of its residents in general.” Id. A State also has a sovereign interest in “assuring that the \nbenefits of the federal system are not denied to its general population.” Id. at 608. As extensively \nrecounted in Section I.C and the cited declarations, the Mandate irreparably injures those interests \nbecause it will naturally and foreseeably cause healthcare employees to lose their jobs, thereby \nexacerbating the healthcare labor shortage, causing further unemployment, and leading the States’ \ncitizens to lose access to adequate medical care—or to lose access to federal benefits altogether. See \nTexas v.  E.P.A., 829 F.3d at 434 (irreparable injury to State in the  prospect of loss  of basic \ninfrastructure); BST Holdings, No. 21-60845, at 18-19; Ex. K ¶¶7-9; Ex. F ¶¶4-5; Ex. G ¶¶10-15; Ex. \nA ¶¶3-5. It will also force the States’ healthcare-employee citizens to forfeit control over their private \nmedical choices, personal information, and bodily autonomy to their employers and to the federal \ngovernment. Ex. L ¶¶17-20; Ex. P ¶¶3, 21-22.  \nFourth, the States will suffer the irreparable injury of the deprivation of their statutorily \nguaranteed procedural rights. A plaintiff has a “cognizable injury if it has been deprived of a procedural \nright to protects its concrete interests.” Texas v. Equal Emp't Opportunity Comm'n, 933 F.3d 433, 447 \n(5th Cir. 2019) (quotations and alterations omitted). And “[a] violation of the APA's notice-and-\ncomment requirements is one example of a deprivation of a procedural right.” Id. Here, the States \nwere  denied  multiple  procedural  rights,  including  the  APA’s  and  CRA’s  notice-and-comment \nrequirements, to protect their wide range of concrete interests in avoiding the Mandate. If the \nprocedurally defective Mandate remains in effect, they will have no remedy.  \nOf course, to avoid those injuries, the States and their facilities could forfeit their Medicare \nand Medicaid funds. But doing so would cause them to lose billions of dollars and would catalyze a \npublic-health crisis. Thoseconsequenceswould irreparably injure the State and its citizens. State of Fla. \n24\n \n \n\nv. Weinberger, 492 F.2d 488, 492 (5th Cir. 1974) (“The calamitous prospect of such a loss of funding, \neven for a short period, to the state and to the disadvantaged citizens for whom it stands parens patriae \nis so grave as to suffice for such hardship as may be required.”). \nIII.  AN INJUNCTION WOULD NOT HARM DEFENDANTS OR DISSERVE THE PUBLIC \nINTEREST.  \nFinally, the public interest and balance of equities weigh in favor of granting a preliminary \ninjunction. Simply put, Defendants “have no legitimate interest in the implementation of [the] \nunlawful” Vaccine Mandate. Texas, 2021 WL 723856, at *49. Instead, “the public is served when the \nlaw is followed.” Id. at *51 (quoting Daniels Health Scis., L.L.C. v. Vascular Health Scis., L.L.C., 710 F.3d \n579, 585 (5th Cir. 2013)); see also League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. \nCir. 2016) (“There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”). The \npublic has an overriding interest in ensuring that vast regulatory programs are implemented lawfully, \nin compliance with the constitutional separation of powers and APA. Cf. United States v. Baylor Univ. \nMed. Ctr., 711 F.2d 38, 40 (5th Cir. 1983) (stay warranted where “[t]he interest of the Medicaid and \nMedicare recipients would be seriously compromised should [a medical center] be put to the Hobson’s \nchoice” of continuing to litigate or “decid[ing]to forfeit its Medicaid and Medicare funds”). And while \nPlaintiff States would be irreparably harmed by the implementation of the Mandate, the only harm to \nthe Defendants from an injunction would be to wait for an actual grant of authority from Congress. \nAccordingly, the public interest and balance of harms weigh heavily in Plaintiff States’ favor.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant Plaintiff States’ Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction. \n25\n \n \n\nDated:   November 15, 2021 Respectfully submitted,\nBy:/s/ Elizabeth B.

The enjoined mandate applies to \nthe  staff  of  many  Medicare-  and  Medicaid-certified  providers  such  as \nhospitals, long-term care facilities, home-health agencies, and hospices.   \n  We DENY the motion insofar as the order applies to the 14 Plaintiff \nStates.  We GRANT  a stay as to the order’s application to any other \njurisdiction.  Briefly, we will explain. \n  When  analyzing  a  request  to  stay  a  district  court’s  preliminary \ninjunction, we are to consider the following factors: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that \nhe is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant \nwill be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance \nof the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested \nin the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \nVeasey v. Perry, 769 F.3d 890, 892 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009)).  Likelihood of success and irreparable injury to \nthe movant are the most significant factors.  Id. \nThe district court cited a number of reasons for enjoining the rule.  \nEspecially in light of a recent, precedential opinion from this court, see BST \nHoldings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, 17 F.4th 604 (5th Cir. 2021), it appears that the \nSecretary will have the most difficulty overcoming the part of the ruling that \napplied the “major questions doctrine.”  We thus focus on that issue in \nassessing whether the Secretary has made a strong showing of likely success. \nThe district court held that the Secretary’s decision to enter the \nvaccine regulatory space for the first time implicates what some courts and \ncommentators  have  called  the  “major  questions  doctrine,”  though \napparently not (yet) so designated in a majority opinion for the Supreme \n2 \n \n\nCaseC 3a:2se1:- c2v1--0330977304- T  A  D D-KocDuMm e  nDto: c0u0m51e6n1t 33199  1 F3i l e  d P 1a2g/1e5: /32 1       DPaatgee F 4il eodf :7 1 P2/a1g5e/2ID0 2#1:  731\nNo. 21-30734 \n \nCourt.1  It appears to us not so much a new doctrine but a new label for \ncourts’ method of analyzing federal agencies’ novel assertions of authority.  \nFor example, the Supreme Court did not give deference to the Food and \nDrug Administration’s 1996 decision that it had implicit authority under its \ngoverning statutes to regulate tobacco.  FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco \nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 159–60 (2000). \nOur  court  relied  in  part  on  this  doctrine  in  recently  staying  the \nCOVID-19  vaccination  mandate  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health \nAdministration (“OSHA”) issued for employers of a certain size.  BST \nHoldings, 17 F.4th at 617; see also Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v. Department of \nHHS, 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (staying CDC’s eviction moratorium \nbased in part on the need for Congress “to speak clearly when authorizing an \nagency to ex(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:30)(cid:36)(cid:46)(cid:32)(cid:3)(cid:43)(cid:42)(cid:50)(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:46)(cid:3)(cid:42)(cid:33)(cid:3)(cid:66)(cid:49)(cid:28)(cid:46)(cid:47)(cid:3)(cid:32)(cid:30)(cid:42)(cid:41)(cid:42)(cid:40)(cid:36)(cid:30)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:41)(cid:31)(cid:3)(cid:43)(cid:42)(cid:39)(cid:36)(cid:47)(cid:36)(cid:30)(cid:28)(cid:39)(cid:3)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:34)(cid:41)(cid:36)(cid:33)(cid:36)(cid:30)(cid:28)(cid:41)(cid:30)(cid:32)(cid:67)(cid:69)(cid:3)\n(quoting Brown & Williamson, 592 U.S. at 160)).  The Secretary identifies \nmeaningful distinctions between its rule for Medicare and Medicaid-funded \nfacilities and the broader OSHA rule — the statutory authority for the rule is \ndifferent; Medicare and Medicaid were enacted under the Spending Clause \nrather than the Commerce Clause; and the targeted health care facilities, \nespecially nursing homes, are where COVID-19 has posed the greatest risk.  \nIt is a close call whether these distinctions (or others) of BST Holdings will \nultimately convince the panel hearing this appeal.  Nonetheless, the first stay \nfactor requires more than showing a close call.  We cannot say that the \nSecretary has made a strong showing of likely success on the merits. \n \n1 Able researchers for this panel have discovered that this doctrinal label has been \nused only twice at the Supreme Court in merits opinions on a case — once in a concurrence \nand the other in a dissent.  Department of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 \nS. Ct. 1891, 1925 (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring); Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, \n2141–42 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).   \n3 \n \n\nCaseC 3a:2se1:- c2v1--0330977304- T  A  D D-KocDuMm e  nDto: c0u0m51e6n1t 33199  1 F3i l e  d P 1a2g/1e5: /42 1       DPaatgee F 5il eodf :7 1 P2/a1g5e/2ID0 2#1:  732\nNo. 21-30734 \n \nThe other three factors for a stay — injury to the movant, injury to the \nopponent, and the public interest — are important but, regardless of the \noutcome of analyzing them, they will not overcome our holding that the \nmerits of the injunction will not likely be disturbed on appeal.  That is \nespecially so because preserving the status quo “is an important” equitable \nconsideration in the stay decision.  Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 439 U.S. \n1358, 1359 (1978)).  Here, the Secretary’s vaccine rule has not gone into \neffect.   \n  Though we deny the stay generally, we also consider whether the \npreliminary injunction should remain in effect beyond the 14 states that have \nbrought this suit.  Principles of judicial restraint control here.  Other courts \nare  considering  these  same  issues,  with  several  courts  already  and \ninconsistently ruling.  Compare Florida v. Department of HHS, — F.4th —, \n2021 WL 5768796 (11th Cir. Dec. 6, 2021) (declining to enjoin rule after \ndistrict court refused to do so), with Missouri v. Biden, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2021 \nWL 5564501 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 29, 2021) (enjoining rule in the ten plaintiff \nstates).  In addition, the many states that have not brought suit may well have \naccepted and even endorsed the vaccination rule.   \n  The  question  posed  is  whether  one  district  court  should  make  a \nbinding judgment for the entire country.   At times, we have answered the \nquestion affirmatively.  For example, we allowed nationwide injunctions in \nan immigration case.  See Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 188 (5th Cir. \n2015).  That decision, though, does not hold that nationwide injunctions are \nrequired or even the norm.  As is true for all injunctive relief, the scope of the \ninjunction  must  be  justified  based  on  the  “circumstances.”    Id.    That \njustification existed in Texas because of the constitutional command for \n“uniform” immigration laws and a concern that “a geographically-limited \ninjunction would be ineffective because DAPA beneficiaries would be free to \nmove among states.”  Id.  at 187–88. \n4 \n \n\nCaseC 3a:2se1:- c2v1--0330977304- T  A  D D-KocDuMm e  nDto: c0u0m51e6n1t 33199  1 F3i l e  d P 1a2g/1e5: /52 1       DPaatgee F 6il eodf :7 1 P2/a1g5e/2ID0 2#1:  733\nNo. 21-30734 \n \n  The district court here gave little justification for issuing an injunction \noutside the 14 States that brought this suit.  It stated that “due to the \nnationwide scope of the CMS Mandate, a nationwide injunction is necessary \ndue to the need for uniformity” and noted that “there are unvaccinated \nworkers in other states who also need protection.”  Lacking is either the \nconstitutional  uniformity  principle  in  Texas  or  that  case’s  concern  that \npatchwork  rulings  would  undermine  an  injunction  limited  to  certain \njurisdictions.   \n  Justice Gorsuch recently critiqued the frequency of the imposition of \nnationwide injunctions.  Such injunctions at times can constitute “rushed, \nhigh-stake, low-information decisions,” while more limited equitable relief \ncan be beneficial: \nThe traditional system of lower courts issuing interlocutory \nrelief limited to the parties at hand may require litigants and \ncourts to tolerate interim uncertainty about a rule’s final fate \nand proceed more slowly until this Court speaks in a case of its \nown.  But that system encourages multiple judges and multiple \ncircuits to weigh in only after careful deliberation, a process \nthat  permits  the  airing  of  competing  views  that  aids  this \nCourt’s own decisionmaking process. \nDepartment  of  Homeland  Sec.  v.  New  York,  140  S.  Ct.  599,  600  (2020) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring in the grant of a stay).   \n   This vaccine rule is an issue of great significance currently being \nlitigated throughout the country.  Its ultimate resolution will benefit from \n“the airing of competing views” in our sister circuits.  See id.  Though here \ntoo, as with the other issues before us, we are not in a position to make \ndefinitive pronouncements about the outcome of this appeal, we do predict \nthat the Secretary is likely to prevail in limiting the scope of the injunction.   \n5 \n \n\nCaseC 3a:2se1:- c2v1--0330977304- T  A  D D-KocDuMm e  nDto: c0u0m51e6n1t 33199  1 F3i l e  d P 1a2g/1e5: /62 1       DPaatgee F 7il eodf :7 1 P2/a1g5e/2ID0 2#1:  734\nNo. 21-30734 \n \n  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the opposed motion for \nstay of the district court’s preliminary injunction order pending appeal is \nDENIED insofar as the order applies to the 14 Plaintiff States.  A stay is \nGRANTED as to the order’s application to any other jurisdiction. \n \n6 \n ",

CMS’s  failure  to  abide  by  fundamental  rule-making \nprocedures both constitutes actionable illegality itself and provides context for substantive errors \nthat riddle the Mandate. To be sure, this was no mere oversight. Rather, it was purposely designed \nto fast-track an unprecedented, unauthorized, far-reaching social experiment, which could be \naccomplished only by steamrolling States and stakeholders while avoiding judicial review. Legal \nsafeguards for democratic participation such as the APA were readily discarded in service of the \nPresident’s diktat to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible.1 So too were concerns for \nreduced care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, whose provider access is the price for \nadvancing the President’s autocratic agenda. Indeed, at least one federal court has already found \nthat the Vaccine Mandate contains multiple constitutional and procedural defects, any of which \nare fatal. See Memorandum and Order, ECF No. 28, Missouri v. Biden, No. 4:21-cv-01329-MTS \n(E.D. Mo. Nov. 29, 2021). \nAll of this is unlawful, as found by Judge Schelp. Defendants exceeded their authority, \ndisregarded constitutional limits, skipped notice and comment, failed to prepare a regulatory \nimpact analysis, and ignored their obligation to consult with the States. An immediate injunction \nfrom this Court is proper because all four equitable factors overwhelmingly favor Plaintiff States. \n \n1  See  The  White  House,  Path  Out  of  the  Pandemic:  President  Biden’s  Covid-19  Action  Plan, \nhttps://bit.ly/3adkMXx (last visited Nov. 29, 2021); The White House, Vaccination Requirements Are \nHelping Vaccinate More People, Protect Americans from COVID-19, and Strengthen the Economy (Oct. \n7, 2021), https://bit.ly/3lorbp0.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 8 of 24 PageID #:  610\n \nARGUMENT   \nI.  The Court Has Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  \nDefendants argue (Opp. at 8-11) that this Court “lacks jurisdiction” over Plaintiff States’ \nclaims based on the Medicare Act’s “channeling” requirement, 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), as incorporated \nby 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii. This argument lacks merit for three reasons. \nFirst, Defendants’ assertion that “[a]ll of Plaintiffs claims plainly arise under the Medicare \nstatute,” Opp. at 10, is wrong. Plaintiff States’ claims arise under both the Medicare statute and \nthe Medicaid statute, as well as the Constitution, Administrative Procedure Act, and Congressional \nReview Act. See Complaint (Doc. 1) at ¶¶ 27, 53, 57, 65, 126, 181, 182, 184 (citing implicated \nMedicaid provisions). Defendants themselves rely on both statutory schemes as authority. See e.g.,  \nOpp. at 11 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1302(a) (Medicaid) and § 1395hh(a)(1) (Medicare)). Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not subject to Section 405’s jurisdictional bar. See Ass’n of Cmty. Cancer \nCenters v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 490-91 (D. Md. 2020) (explaining that the channeling \nrequirement applies to  claims under subchapter XVIII (Medicare), not to other subchapters \n(covering Medicaid)).2 See also Avon Nursing & Rehab. v. Becerra, 995 F.3d 305, 311 (2d Cir. \n2021) (“Unlike the Medicare Act, the Medicaid Act does not incorporate the Social Security Act’s \nclaim-channeling and jurisdiction stripping provisions.”).   \nSecond, the Medicare channeling requirement does not apply in cases such as this “where \njudicial review would be unavailable through the prescribed administrative procedures.” See Sw. \nPharmacy Sols., Inc. v. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 718 F.3d 436, 439 (5th Cir. \n2013). As Defendants concede, Medicare’s administrative review procedures do not apply to \n“State governments” such as Plaintiff States. Opp. at 11. Thus, “the States themselves could not \n \n2 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii (“section 405 of this title[] shall also apply with respect to this subchapter to the same \nextent as [it is applicable with respect to subchapter II…”) (emphasis added).   \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 9 of 24 PageID #:  611\n \nuse that statute’s vehicle for judicial review.” Id. The Eastern District of Missouri rejected \nDefendants’ § 405(h) jurisdictional argument for this very reason. See Missouri, No. 4:21-cv-\n01329, ECF No. 28 at 2-3. \nThird, Defendants’ reliance on Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 \nU.S. 1 (2000), is deeply misplaced.  In that case, the Court treated a nursing home association as \nan “institution” under § 1395cc(h)(1) when asserting the rights of its members, see id. at 24 (“The \nCouncil speaks only on behalf of its members institutions… It is essentially their rights to review \nthat are at stake”), and thus subject to the Medicare channeling requirement. By clear contrast, \nPlaintiff States have independent standing arising out of the various ways in which the Mandate \nundermines  their  sovereign  and  pecuniary  interests,  independent  of  the  rights  of  the  States’ \ninstitutions, as well as a “stake in protecting [their] quasi-sovereign interests[.]” Massachusetts v. \nE.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007).  \nThe States’ Medicare-related claims, in other words, have no connection to the claims-related \nlawsuits Congress sought to channel via § 1395hh(a)(1). The Court in Illinois Council expressly \naddressed only the situation where “one who might later seek money or some other benefit from \n(or contest the imposition of a penalty by) the agency challenges in advance (in a § 1331 action) \nthe lawfulness of a policy, regulation, or statute that might later bar recovery of that benefit (or \nauthorize the imposition of the penalty).” Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 10. But the States in their \nroles as sovereigns or quasi-sovereigns present no prospect of “later seek[ing] money of some \nother benefit” from CMS. Their claims therefore do not “arise under” the Social Security Act in \nthe way contemplated by § 405(h) and Illinois Council. \nAccordingly, § 405(h), as incorporated by § 1395ii, does not divest this Court of federal-\nquestion jurisdiction under § 1331 over any of the claims at issue. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 10 of 24 PageID #:  612\n \nII.  The Plaintiff States Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of their Claims. \nA.  CMS Lacked Statutory Authority to Issue the Vaccine Mandate. \nCMS  openly  recognizes  its  action  is  unprecedented—never  before  had  the  agency \nmandated vaccination. See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. 61,567 (“We have not previously required any \nvaccinations”). Yet, Defendants characterize this sweeping mandate as a routine exercise of the \nSecretary’s regulatory authority. They are wrong. \nThe applicable statutes do not give CMS the power to impose a nationwide vaccine mandate. \nSection  1302(a)  directs  the  Secretary  to  “make  and  publish  such  rules  and  regulations,  not \ninconsistent with [the Social Security Act], as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the \nfunctions with which [the Secretary] is charged under” the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 42 \nU.S.C.  §  1302(a)  (emphasis  added).  Similarly,  Section  1395hh(a)(1)  directs  the  Secretary  to \n“prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance \nprograms under” the Medicare Act. Id. § 1395hh(a)(1) (emphasis added). \nThe word “administration” is the “central focus” of these statutes, and its original meaning \nin 1935 was “the practical management and direction of its various programs (including eventually \nMedicare and Medicaid), as well as their management and conduct.” Merck & Co. v. United States \nDep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 962 F.3d 531, 537 (D.C. Cir. 2020). As the D.C. Circuit has aptly \nput it, “the further a regulation strays from truly facilitating the ‘administration’ of the Secretary’s \nduties, the less likely it is to fall within the statutory grant of authority.” Id. at 537–38. Here, the \nVaccine Mandate strays far off the path of administration, into the realm of federalized healthcare \npolicy. Even if vaccination promotes health and safety and thus might reduce program costs, it still \nhas nothing to do with the practical “management” of Medicaid or Medicare.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 11 of 24 PageID #:  613\n \nDefendants’ invocation (Opp. at 12) of results-oriented purposivism—i.e., the Secretary \nhas regulatory authority to promote the health and safety of Medicare and Medicaid recipients—\nis a poor substitute for any text in §§ 1302(a) and 1395hh(a)(1) that supports his authority. This \nespecially falls short of the Supreme Court’s admonition that such authority must be “clearly” \nstated in this context. See Alabama Ass’n of Relators v. HHS, 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) \n(requiring Congress to speak clearly when it wishes to “authoriz[e] an agency to exercise powers \nof vast economic and political significance” or “significantly alter the balance between federal and \nstate power”). Indeed, neither provision even explicitly references “health and safety.” And even \nthose specific provisions that do use that phrase still fail because they do not authorize the \nsweeping vaccine mandate the interim final rule purports to authorize here. In any event, the \nMandate’s unquestionable reduction in patient access to essential healthcare services—as Plaintiff \nStates’ undisputed evidence shows—demonstrates that it does not promote patients’ “health and \nsafety.”  \nB.  The Vaccine Mandate Is Arbitrary and Capricious. \nAPA review for arbitrary and capricious agency action “has serious bite.” Wages & White \nLion Invs., L.L.C. v. F.D.A., 16 F.4th 1130 (5th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up). Here that bite devours the \nVaccine Mandate. \nDiminished  Access  to  Care  Caused  by  Staffing  Shortages.  Defendants  attempt  to \nwhitewash the Secretary’s avoidance of the access-to-care issue by pointing to reliance on “real \nworld experience with vaccination requirements” from a few urban hospital systems, Opp. at 11, \n17, none of which are located in the Plaintiff States.3  But Defendants’ reliance on the “empirical \n \n3 For example, the labor market for Houston Methodist (Opp. at 17) is hardly representative of the labor \nmarket in all but a few uber-populated urban areas in the country. And Novant Health is a massive 35,000-\nemployee healthcare system in North Carolina with locations clustered mostly in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 12 of 24 PageID #:  614\n \ndata” (Opp. at 17) fails under the actual regulatory record, which reflects obvious insecurity by the \ndrafters about the Secretary’s broad predictions.  See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,612 (“A major caution \nabout these estimates…”; “Another unknown is what currently unvaccinated employees would do \n…”; “Again, we have no way to estimate …”; “As indicated by the preceding analysis, predicting \nthe full range of benefits and costs in either the short run or the next full year with any degree of \nestimating  precision  is  all  but  impossible.”);  id.  at  61,603  (“This  rule  presents  additional \ndifficulties in estimating both costs and benefits due to the high degree to which current provider \nand supplier staff have already received information about the benefits and safety of COVID–19 \nvaccination, and the rare serious risks associated with it.”).4  \nTo recap, CMS admits knowing “endemic staff shortages” throughout the healthcare \nindustry “will be made worse if any substantial number of unvaccinated employees” leave the \nworkforce because of the Mandate. Id. at 61,607; see id. at 61,559 (recognizing that staff shortages \n“have ramifications for patient access to recommended and medically appropriate services”). Yet, \nCMS, which astonishingly declared it could not identify a “single entity” worth consulting about \nthe impact of its actions, claims it does not know how many “recalcitrant unvaccinated employees” \nwill exit the workforce under the Mandate because it has “no way to estimate such behavioral \nchanges,” id. at 61,612, and “there is insufficient evidence to quantify and compare adverse \n \nand their suburbs. CMS’s reliance on New York’s 92% vaccination compliance rate is particularly \nremarkable given reports that New York hospitals are closing doors. See Long Island hospital temporarily \nclosing ER due to nursing staff shortages amid vaccine mandate, ABC 7 New York (Nov. 22, 2021), \nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/long-island-hospital-temporarily-closing-er-due-to-nursing-\nstaff-shortages-amid-vaccine-mandate/ar-AAR0C5t  (“The  emergency  department  at  a  Nassau  County \nhospital has temporarily closed due to nursing staff shortages as a result of New York’s vaccine mandate.”). \n \n4 The assertion that it is impossible to analytically assess the potential labor market impact is disingenuous. \nSee, e.g., Liz Hamel, et al., KFA COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor: October 2021, KFF (Oct. 28, 2021), \nhttps://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-october-2021/ \n(“More than a third (37%) of unvaccinated workers (5% of adults overall) say they would leave their job if \ntheir employer required them to get a vaccine or get tested weekly”). \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 13 of 24 PageID #:  615\n \nimpacts on patient and resident care associated with temporary staffing losses.” Id. at 61,569. By \nCMS’s own admission, these difficult questions “remain” unanswered. Id. at 61,612. (Had it asked, \nit would have received a different answer, as demonstrated by the Declarations submitted here.) \nHow, then, can CMS propose such an unprecedented, far-reaching, and disruptive rule \nwithout understanding the impact of the rule on the access to care of the statutory beneficiaries? \nThe answer, according to CMS, is both philosophical, see id. at 61,612 (“we believe it is clear” \nthat the “larger benefits” will prevail) (emphasis added), and absurd. See id. at 61,609 (“there is \nno reason to think this will be a net minus even in the short term, given the magnitude of normal \nturnover  and  the  relatively  small  fraction  of  that  turnover  that  will  be  due  to  vaccination \nmandates”) (emphasis added). Again, CMS sought no input, therefore it conveniently finds nothing \nto contradict its misinformed conclusions. But deliberately unsubstantiated predictions cannot \nsuffice under the APA. \nFirst, the Secretary’s belief in the efficacy of the program and the resiliency of the \nhealthcare labor market is no substitute for reasoned analysis, particularly in the face of explicit \nwarnings in the agency record about the paucity and limitations of the evidence it considered. The \nAPA requires an agency to “examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for \nits actions including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n“[U]nsupported supposition” is neither reasoned nor rational. United Techs. Corp. v. Dep’t of Def., \n601 F.3d 557, 562 (D.D. Cir. 2010). \nSecond, Defendants’ claim, Opp. at 18, that any workforce losses will “be dwarfed by the \nordinary degree of churn in the market of labor in the health care industry” and that “there is no reason \nto believe that the need to find staffing will be noticeably more onerous” after the Mandate likewise \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 14 of 24 PageID #:  616\n \nlacks evidence, or even intuitional support. Because the Mandate covers most of the healthcare \nindustry, unvaccinated workers are now essentially removed from the labor force in that industry. \nExcluding an entire category of workers from most healthcare jobs across the Nation is hardly \ncomparable to ordinary “churn” of the labor market. To the contrary, it pours gasoline on an already \nvolatile situation. The foundationless notion that “business as usual” measures can counteract the \nimpending doom is unreasonable in the extreme. \nThe Secretary’s dismissive treatment of such an “important aspect of the problem” is fatal \nto the rule. See Humane Soc’y of United States v. Zinke, 865 F.3d 585, 606 (D.C. Cir. 2017) \n(“failure to address ‘an important aspect of the problem’ that is factually substantiated in the record \nis unreasoned, arbitrary, and capricious decisionmaking”) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n., \n463 U.S. at 43 (1983); Stewart v. Azar, 313 F. Supp. 3d 237, 261 (D.D.C. 2019) (“The fundamental \nfailure here [] is that he (the Secretary) ignored” the Medicaid Act’s core objective of providing \ncare to the needy) (underscore in original); Gresham v. Azar, 363 F. Supp. 3d 165, 177 (D.D.C. \n2019) (“The Secretary’s approval letter did not consider whether [Arkansas Work Amendments] \nwould reduce Medicaid coverage) (underscore in original); Philbrick v. Azar, 397 F. Supp. 3d 11, \n24 (D.D.C. 2019) (“it can hardly be disputed that the agency needs to address the magnitude” of \nthe number of beneficiaries who will lose coverage) (underscore in original).   \nUnreasonably Rejects Natural Immunity. CMS further renders its actions invalid by its  \nrefusal to exempt from the Mandate people who previously had COVID-19 while simultaneously \nacknowledging that each day 100,000 people are “recover[ing] from infection,” and “are no longer \nsources of future infections,” and their natural immunity “reduce[s] the risk to both health care staff \nand patients substantially.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,604 (emphasis added); see also United States v. \nArencibia, No. CR 18-294 ADM/DTS, 2021 WL 2530209, at *4 (D. Minn. June 21, 2021) \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 15 of 24 PageID #:  617\n \n(reciting the CDC’s position that “[c]ases of reinfection with COVID-19 have been reported, but \nremain rare”). This unexplained inconsistency in CMS’s position renders the Mandate “arbitrary \nand capricious.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. Ct. 2117, 2126 (2016). \nPost Hoc/Pretextual Reasoning. Defendants want to ignore the Biden Administration’s \nprior comments concerning vaccine mandates. Opp. at 19-20. But this Court should not—and \nindeed cannot—ignore the obvious pretextual and post-hoc reasoning. As Plaintiff States have \nexplained, the Administration originally affirmed that mandating vaccines is “not the role of the \nfederal government.” Doc. 2-1, at 3. The President then unabashedly announced that the CMS \nVaccine Mandate is part of a broader program aimed at generally increasing vaccination rates. Id. \nYet CMS now seeks to justify the Mandate as necessary to protect patient health. \n“In reviewing agency pronouncements, courts need not turn a blind eye to the statements \nof those issuing such pronouncements.” BST Holdings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, __F.4th__ , No. 21-60845, \n2021 WL 5279381, at *5 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2021) (citing FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)). “In fact, courts have an affirmative duty not to do so.” Id. CMS thus \ncannot  ignore  the  Administration’s  original  announcement  and  the  President’s  later-stated \nrationale, preferring instead to contrive a new justification under the Social Security Act. Such \nblatant pretext renders CMS’s Mandate arbitrary and capricious. Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 \nS. Ct. 2551, 2575–76 (2019); see also BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *5 (identifying pretext \nas a “hallmark[] of unlawful agency actions”). Indeed, these kinds of “sudden[] revers[als]” of \ncourse “create[] the plausible inference that political pressure may have caused the agency to take \naction it was not otherwise planning to take.” Connecticut v. Dep’t of Interior, 363 F. Supp. 3d 45, \n64–65 (D.D.C. 2019). \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 16 of 24 PageID #:  618\n \nThe Administration’s shifting rationales across all vaccine mandates further demonstrate \npretext. The OSHA mandate declares that vaccines are necessary to protect worker safety. See 86 \nFed. Reg. 61,402 (Nov. 5, 2021). But that rationale would not suffice under the Social Security \nAct, so CMS contrived a new justification—patient safety—for its mandate. (It is also worth \nnoting that CMS has not adopted a mandate for actual patients.) Accepting these conflicting agency \njustifications would require this Court to “exhibit a naiveté from which ordinary citizens are free.” \nNew York, 139 S. Ct. at 2575. \nFor all these reasons and those explained in Plaintiff States’ initial memorandum, the \nVaccine Mandate is arbitrary and capricious. \nC.  The Vaccine Mandate Violates Notice-and-Comment Requirements. \nDefendants argue that good cause excuses notice-and-comment requirements because a \ndelay would harm the health and safety of patients. Opp. at 22-24. But CMS’s good-cause analysis \ndid not even consider the Mandate’s harm to patients from exacerbating the healthcare workforce \nshortage and, as explained above, CMS elsewhere unreasonably dismissed that concern. Given \nthese failures, Defendants cannot satisfy the close examination that good-cause analysis requires. \nSee United States v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912, 928 (5th Cir. 2011) (“[I]t is well established that the \n‘good cause’ exception to notice-and-comment should be read narrowly in order to avoid providing \nagencies with an ‘escape clause’ from the requirements Congress prescribed.”). \nDefendants’ good-cause arguments focus on the health risks from COVID-19. But after \nalmost two years, COVID-19 is a persistent feature of life and cannot itself constitute good cause; \nsimilarly, COVID-19 vaccinations have been approved under emergency authorizations for nearly \na year. See Florida v. Becerra, 8:21-cv-839, 2021 WL 2514138, at *45 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2021); \nRegeneron Pharms., Inc. v. HHS, 510 F. Supp. 3d 29, 48 (S.D.N.Y. 2020); Ass’n of Cmty. Cancer \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 17 of 24 PageID #:  619\n \nCenters v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, 496 (D. Md. 2020). After so much time has passed, to deem \nthe desire for universal vaccination against COVID-19 “good cause” for ignoring notice-and-\ncomment requirements would effectively repeal those requirements indefinitely. See also BST \nHoldings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *3 & n.10  (OSHA vaccine mandate’s “stated impetus—a \npurported ‘emergency’ that the entire globe has now endured for nearly two years . . . —is \nunavailing” because “society’s interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19 cannot qualify as \ncompelling forever”) (cleaned up). \nProfessing good cause in an interim final rule published six months ago, CMS invoked \nmany of the same reasons it offers now—the existence of a public health emergency, the need to \nprotect vulnerable patient populations, and strain on the healthcare industry. See 86 Fed. Reg. \n26,306, 26,320–21 (May 13, 2021). But if the same conditions were present nearly six months ago, \nit strains credulity to assert them as an emergency justification now. See Chamber of Commerce \nv. SEC, 443 F.3d 890, 908 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“The [good-cause] exception excuses notice and \ncomment in emergency situations.”) (emphasis added).5 \n \nFinally, the “more expansive the regulatory reach of” a rule, “the greater the necessity for \npublic comment” to allow those affected to be heard. Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emp. v. Block, 655 F.2d \n1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1981). There is no overlooking the magnitude of this rule, for CMS has \n“not previously required” mandatory vaccination for the healthcare industry. 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,567. And the notice and comment process is even more vital in the Medicare and Medicaid \ncontext because those programs “touch[] the lives of nearly all Americans” and are two of the \n“largest federal program[s]” in the country. Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1808 \n \n5 For the same reasons, it makes little sense that the Secretary could not have consulted with appropriate \nState and local agencies in advance of the rule. The post-rule consultations that Defendants allegedly intend \nto undertake, see Op. at 23-24, do not comply with the plain text of 42 U.S.C. § 1395z and that statute’s \nclear purpose to ensure that States are stakeholders and participants in Medicare—not mere subjects. \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 18 of 24 PageID #:  620\n \n(2019). Even “minor changes” to the way those programs are administered “can impact millions \nof people and billions of dollars in ways that are not always easy for regulators to anticipate.” Id. \nat 1816. Defendants’ neglect of notice and comment lacks any good cause justification. \nIII.  The Remaining Injunction Factors Favor the Plaintiffs. \nA.  The Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Harm. \nSovereign Interests. Defendants’ argument (Opp. at 26-27) that Plaintiff States have  \n“suffered no cognizable harm” to their sovereign interest blinks reality and defies clear Fifth \nCircuit precedent. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, \n734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th Cir. 2013). A State’s interest in “in not being pressured to change its law” \nis sufficiently “related to its sovereignty” for these purposes. Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, \n752 n.38 (5th Cir. 2015); see also Veasey v. Abbott, 870 F.3d 387, 391 (5th Cir. 2017) (“[T]he \nState necessarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforcement of \nits laws.”). \nLikewise, Defendants’ reliance (Opp. at 26) on Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007) \nfor the proposition that Plaintiff States lack standing is misplaced. Massachusetts expressly noted \nthat, given the state’s “procedural right” to “challenge the rejection of [a] rulemaking petition as \narbitrary  and  capricious,”  and  its  stake  in  protecting  its  quasi-sovereign  interests,”  the \nCommonwealth had standing “to litigate in parens patiae to protect quasi-sovereign interests—\ni.e., public or governmental interests that concern the state as a whole.” Id. at 520, n.17. \nProprietary Interests. Plaintiff States also face irreparable harm as arising out of their \nrelationships with healthcare facilities covered by the Mandate. Defendants reduce these harms to \n“mere” economic harm. Opp. at 26-27. But “[t]he threat of unrecoverable economic loss does qualify \nas irreparable harm.” Iowa Utilities Bd. v. FCC, 109 F.3d 418, 426 (8th Cir. 1996); accord East Bay \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 19 of 24 PageID #:  621\n \nSanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 677 (9th Cir. 2021); Kansas Health Care Ass’n, Inc. v. \nKansas Dep’t of Soc. & Rehab. Servs., 31 F.3d 1536, 1543 (10th Cir. 1994); Temple Univ. v. White, \n941 F.2d 201, 214-15 (3d Cir. 1991). As the Fifth Circuit has stated, “complying with a regulation \nlater held invalid almost always produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs.” \nTexas v. E.P.A., 829 F.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016) (cleaned up). And the Vaccine Mandate will \nimpose enormous non-economic costs on the States’ institutions’ own employees and will cause real \ndisruptions in day-to-day operations caring for patients. This shows that the harm at stake is far more \nthan money.  \nThe recent decision from Florida on which Defendants primarily rely, Florida v. Dep’t of \nHealth & Hum. Servs., _F. Supp. 3d._, 2021 WL 5416122 (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021) (denying \ninjunction for lack of irreparable harm), is in clear conflict with controlling Fifth Circuit precedent. \nSee Texas, 787 F.3d at 752 n.38, and Veasey, 870 F.3d 387, 391; see also Texas v. E.P.A., 829 F.3d \nat 433; Wages & White Lion Invs., L.L.C. v. F.D.A., 16 F.4th 1130, 1142 (5th Cir. 2021) (“because \nfederal agencies generally enjoy sovereign immunity for any monetary damages,” so an injured \nparty has no redress”). By comparison, the decision from Missouri provides a more thorough \nanalysis of the irreparable harm element consistent with precedent applicable here. See Missouri, \nNo. 4:21-cv-01329, ECF No. 28 at 23-28. \nLikelihood of Harms. Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs States’ irreparable harms must \nbe “imminent.” Opp. at 28. Even if that were the standard (which it is not), Plaintiff States would \nreadily satisfy it. The sovereign harms involving preemption of Plaintiff States’ laws are certain to \noccur. So are Plaintiff States’ quasi-sovereign and proprietary harms of involuntarily forcing \nhealthcare workers, including their own employees, to choose between their jobs and their private \nmedical choices about vaccination. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 20 of 24 PageID #:  622\n \nIn any event, Defendants are wrong to insist on a certainty standard because the Supreme \nCourt’s “frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate \nthat irreparable injury is likely”—not certain—to occur. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 22 (2008); see also New York, 139 S. Ct. at 2566 (allowing plaintiffs in an APA challenge \nto demonstrate harm by “showing that third parties will likely react in predictable ways”). Plaintiff \nStates have shown that the irreparable harm relating to the Mandate’s catastrophic effects on the \nhealthcare industry easily clear the likelihood standard. Plaintiffs’ declarations identify dozens of \nprivate and state-run facilities that, based on the information currently available to them, reasonably \nanticipate significant staff loses that will substantially disrupt—and in some cases even end—their \noperations. See Docs. 2-2—2-17.  \nB.  The Balance of Harms and the Public Interest Favor an Injunction. \nEnjoining  CMS’s  Mandate  is  in  the  public  interest.  “From  economic  uncertainty  to \nworkplace strife, the mere specter of the Mandate has contributed to untold economic upheaval in \nrecent months.” BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *8. “The public interest is also served by \nmaintaining our constitutional structure and . . . the liberty of individuals to make intensely \npersonal decisions according to their own convictions.” Id. And “[t]here is clearly a robust public \ninterest in safeguarding prompt access to health care.” Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. DHS, 485 \nF. Supp. 3d 1, 61 (D.D.C. 2020).  \nIn any event, there is no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action. As \nthe Supreme Court said in Alabama Ass’n of Realtors, “[i]t is indisputable that the public has a \nstrong interest in combating the spread of the COVID–19[;]” however, “our system does not permit \nagencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends.” 141 S. Ct. at 2490. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 21 of 24 PageID #:  623\n \nIV.  The Injunction Should Bar Defendants from Enforcing the Rule Anywhere. \nDefendants seek to limit the scope of Plaintiffs States’ requested injunction. Opp. at 29-30. \nBut the Court should not confine its reach. Because Defendants acted without statutory authority, \nviolated multiple procedural requirements, and engaged in arbitrary and capricious decision-\nmaking, no aspect of the CMS Vaccination Mandate can stand, and it should be enjoined in its \nentirety. The APA provides that unlawful agency actions shall be vacated and “set aside” in their \nentirety, not in geographic piecemeal. See BST Holdings, 2021 WL 5279381, at *9 (ordering \nOSHA to “take no steps to implement or enforce the Mandate until further court order,” thus \neffectively  enjoining  it  nationwide).  Affording  full  relief  to  Plaintiff  States  necessitates  a \nnationwide injunction. See Louisiana v. Biden, 2021 WL 2446010, at *22 (W.D. La. June 15, 2021). \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant Plaintiffs States’ motion for a preliminary injunction. And that \ninjunction should apply to all aspects of the IFC because it was promulgated without statutory \nauthority, is arbitrary and capricious, failed to comply with procedural requirements, and violates \nthe Constitution. \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 26   Filed 11/30/21   Page 22 of 24 PageID #:  624\n \nDated:  November 29, 2021             Respectfully Submitted,  \n  By:  /s/ Jimmy R.

DOUGHTY \n \nXAVIER BECERRA ET AL  MAG. JUDGE KAYLA D. MCCLUSKY \n \nMEMORANDUM RULING \nThe issue before this Court is whether the Plaintiff States1 are entitled to a preliminary \ninjunction against the Government Defendants2 as a result of a COVID-19 CMS vaccine \nmandate (“CMS Mandate”) implemented by the Government Defendants on November 5, 2021.  \n86 Fed. Reg. 61555-01.  The CMS Mandate requires the staff of twenty-one types of Medicare \nand Medicaid healthcare providers to receive one vaccine by December 6, 2021, and to receive \nthe second vaccine by January 4, 2022.  Failure to comply with the CMS Mandate may result in \npenalties up to and including “termination of the Medicare/Medicaid Provider Agreement.”  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61574. \nAccording to the CMS, the CMS Mandate regulates over 10.3 million health care \nworkers in the United States.  Id. at 61603.  Of those 10.3 million, 2.4 million healthcare workers \nare currently unvaccinated.  Id. at 61607. \n  Implicit in determining whether a preliminary injunction should be granted is \ndetermining whether the Government Defendants have the statutory and/or constitutional \nauthority to implement the CMS Mandate.  Finding that the Government Defendants do not have \n \n1 Plaintiff States consist of Louisiana, Montana, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, Utah, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. \n2 The Government Defendants consist of Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHH”), Chiquita Brooks–Lasure, in her official \ncapacity as Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 2 of 34 PageID #:  633\nthe authority to implement the CMS Mandate, this Court GRANTS Plaintiff States’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction [Doc. No. 2] and IMMEDIATELY ENJOINS and RESTRAINS the \nGovernment Defendants from implementing the CMS Mandate. \nI.  BACKGROUND \n  This case is about COVID-19 vaccine mandates.  The CMS Mandate requires over 10.3 \nmillion healthcare workers to be fully vaccinated with one of the COVID-19 vaccines in two \nmonths.  The first of two COVID-19 vaccines is required by December 6, 2021, and the second \nby January 4, 2022.  The factual statements made herein should be considered as findings of fact \nand legal conclusions should be considered conclusions of law.  This Court’s job is to examine \nthe appropriate statutes and/or constitutional authority for the Government Defendants to issue \nthe specific CMS Mandate discussed herein.  The opinion expressed hereto is legal, not political \nor personal. \n  On March 13, 2020,  President Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national \nemergency.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared COVID-19 \na global pandemic.   \n  On December 11, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued an \nEmergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  The FDA issued an \nEUA for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on December 18, 2020, and issued an EUA for the \nJanssen COVID-19 vaccine on February 27, 2021.3  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine \nreceived FDA approval on August 23, 2021 for individuals sixteen years of age and older.4  On \n \n3 https://www.fda.gov>COVID19-fre. \n4 https://www.cdc.gov>vaccines. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 3 of 34 PageID #:  634\nNovember 19, 2021, the FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 boosters for \nall adults ages eighteen and older.5 \n  The first cases of COVID-19 in the United States were recorded in January 2020.6  Cases \nbegan surging thereafter with the highest surge from October 2020 to February 2021.  The seven-\nday average for cases in the United States recorded a high on January 12, 2021, at 250,512 cases.  \nFor the last ninety days, the seven-day average has declined from 164,374 on September 2, 2021, \nto 94,335 on November 23, 2021.7 \n  In response to the pandemic, CMS issued six previous rules with regard to COVID-19.  \nThese rules were issued on April 6, 2020, May 8, 2020, September 2, 2020, November 6, 2020, \nMay 13, 2021, and June 21, 2021.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61561.  These previous actions dealt with \nrevision of regulations, data reporting, and infection control requirements to protect healthcare \nworkers from exposure to COVID-19.  The June 21, 2021, Healthcare Emergency Temporary \nStandard (“ETS”) required healthcare workers to develop a plan for each workplace, which \nincluded patient screening, protective equipment, aerosol procedures, physical distancing, \nphysical barriers, cleaning and disinfecting, ventilation, health screening, training, \nrecordkeeping, and reporting. Id. \n  A.  November 5, 2021 CMS Mandate \n  On November 5, 2021, CMS issued the disputed Interim Final Rule (“IFR”), which \ncontained the requirements for mandating COVID-19 vaccines.  The IFR was described by CMS \nas “revises the requirements that Medicare and Medicaid certified providers and suppliers must \nmeet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.” \n \n5 https://www.nbcnews.com>health. \n6 https://www.history.com>first-conf. \n7 https://www.nytimes.com>us>cov. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 4 of 34 PageID #:  635\n  The Mandate was effective on November 5, 2021, and established COVID-19 \nvaccination requirements for staff, and this included Medicare and Medicaid – certified providers \nand suppliers.  The Mandate implemented the COVID-19 vaccinations in two phases.  The first \nvaccine is to be required by December 6, 2021, and the second vaccine is to be required by \nJanuary 4, 2022.  The CMS Mandate went into effect immediately; there was no notice and \ncomment under the Administrative Procedures Act 5 U.S.C. 553. \n  The mandate applies to the employees of Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers \nlisted.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61556.  CMS claimed authority to issue the mandate pursuant to §§ 1102, \n1863, and 1871 of the Social Security Act.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61560, 61567.  The reasoning for the \nmandate was: “In light of our responsibility to protect the health and safety of individuals \nproviding and receiving care and services from the Medicare and Medicaid certified providers \nand suppliers, and CMS’s broad authority to establish health and safety regulations, we are \ncompelled to require staff vaccinations for COVID-19 in these settings.”  86 Fed. Reg. 61560. \n  CMS indicated its mandate was “complementary to the OSHA ETS”,8 which also \nrequires mandatory vaccinations. (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”)).  \nCMS admittedly has not previously required any vaccinations.  86 Fed. Reg. 61567.  The \nmandate discussed the potential effect of health care workers choosing to leave their jobs rather \nthan be vaccinated but concluded9 there was insufficient evidence to quantify and compare \nadverse impacts on patient and residential care associated with temporary staffing losses.  86 \nFed. Reg. at 61569. \n \n8 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stayed the implementation of the OSHA ETS pending \nadequate judicial review of the motions for preliminary injunction.  BST Holding’s LLC v. Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration 21-60845 (November 12, 2021). \n9 Despite approximately 2.4 million unvaccinated healthcare workers. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 5 of 34 PageID #:  636\n  Like the OSHA mandate,10 the CMS mandate is described as a “common set of \nprovisions for each applicable provider and supplier as there are no substantive regulatory \ndifferences across settings.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61570. \n  The CMS mandate also requires that the medical providers and suppliers “track and \nsecurely document” the vaccination status of each staff member, including storing staff \nmembers’ medical records showing proof of vaccination.  86 Fed. Reg. 61572. The CMS \nmandate allows exemptions that are based upon existing Federal law.  The mandate specifically \nstates that it “preempts” the applicability of any state or local law providing for exemptions.  86 \nFed. Reg. 61572. \n  In not inviting notice and comment pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 \nU.S.C. 553, CMS found “good cause” that notice and comment procedures are impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest based upon the reasons set out at 86 Fed. Reg. \n61583 to 61585. \n  B.  The Executive Branch’s Vaccine Policy \n  President-Elect Biden initially did not think vaccines should be mandatory11.  On \nSeptember 9, 2021, President Biden changed his mind announcing his intention to impose a \nnational mandate12.   \n  Both the OSHA Mandate and the CMS Mandate were imposed approximately two \nmonths later on November 5, 2021. \n \n \n10 Described by the Fifth Circuit as a “one size-fits-all sledgehammer.” BTS Holdings, LLC 21-60145@8. \n11 Jacob Jarvis Fact Check:  Did Joe Biden Reject Idea of Mandatory Vaccines in December 2020, Newsweek (Sept.      \n10, 2021), https://bit.ly/3ndyTn.5 \n12 Kevin Liptak & Kaitlan Collins, Biden Announces New CMS Mandates that could cover 100 Million Americans, \nCNN (Sept. 9, 2021). \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 6 of 34 PageID #:  637\n  C.  Medicare and Medicaid \n  Medicare is a federal program that pays for healthcare for the elderly.  Medicaid is a \ncooperative state-funded program that helps States finance medical care for their poor and \ndisabled citizens.  The Secretary of Health and Human Resources is charged through the Social \nSecurity Act with administrative responsibilities related to maintaining the Medicare and \nMedicaid Programs.  42 U.S.C. 301, et al.   \n  The Social Security Act also delegates to the Secretary certain rule-making authority.  As \nrelevant here, 42 U.S.C. 1302(a) gives the Secretary the authority to make and publish rules and \nregulations that may be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which the \nSecretary is charged. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n  The Government Defendants maintain this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the \nPlaintiff States’ claims based upon the Medicare Act’s channeling requirement, 42 U.S.C. 405(g) \nas incorporated by 42 U.S.C. 1395ii.  The Government Defendants argue that Medicare and \nMedicaid’s exclusive review scheme bars pre-enforcement challenges.  The Government \nDefendants further claim the Plaintiff States are required to go through the statute’s \nadministrative review scheme and have an administrative hearing before filing suit in district \ncourt.  Plaintiff States’ claims arise under both the Medicare and Medicaid statutes, the United \nStates Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Congressional Review Act. \n  The Government Defendants cite Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc., \n529 U.S. 1 (2000) for the proposition that any “arising under” jurisdictional claims must undergo \nthe SSA’s administrative process and that Congress made the review exclusive. \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 7 of 34 PageID #:  638\n  However, both 42 U.S.C. 405(g) and 42 U.S.C. 1395ii do not apply in this case.  42 \nU.S.C. 405(h) states that the SSA administrative process only applies to actions “to recover on \nany claim arising under this subchapter.”  The “subchapter” refers to claims for benefits under \nthe SSA.  It does not apply to a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief as to the authority of \nCMS to make regulations.  Plaintiff States are neither “institutions” nor “agencies” who are \n“dissatisfied” with the Secretary’s determination regarding eligibility or receipt of benefits.  The \nchanneling requirement does not apply to “state governments.”   Since Plaintiff States would be \nunable to use this statutory scheme (even if they wanted to) it would mean “no review at all” \nunder Shalala, which would allow Plaintiff States to have jurisdiction in this Court. \n  Additionally, the Medicare Act’s channeling requirement only applies to Medicare and \nnot to Medicaid claims.  Avon Nursing & Rehab. V. Becerra, 995 F.3d 305, 311 (2d. Cir. 2021). \n  Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to hear these claims. \nIII.  STANDING \n  Although the Plaintiff States’ standing has not been challenged by the Government \nDefendants, this Court must next determine whether it has judicial power to hear the case.  The \nUnited States Constitution limits exercise of judicial power to certain “cases” and \n“controversies.”  U.S. Constitution Article III Section 2. \n  Under the doctrine of “standing,” a federal court can exercise judicial power only where a \nplaintiff has demonstrated that it (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) fairly traceable to the \nchallenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.  \nLujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992).  \nThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.  Id. at \n561. \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 8 of 34 PageID #:  639\n  The Plaintiffs in this case are fourteen (14) states.  States are not normal litigants for \npurposes of invoking federal jurisdiction.  Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497, 518, 127 S. Ct. \n1438, 167 L. Ed. 2d 248 (2007).  Rather, a state is afforded “special solicitude” in satisfying its \nburden to demonstrate the traceability and redressability elements of the traditional standing \ninquiry whenever its claims and injury meet certain criteria.  Id. at 520; Texas v. United States, \n809 F.3d 134, 151–55 (5th Cir. 2015), as revised (Nov. 25, 2015).  Specifically, a state seeking \nspecial solicitude standing must allege that a defendant violated a congressionally accorded \nprocedural right that affected the state’s “quasi-sovereign” interests in, for instance, its physical \nterritory or lawmaking function.  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520–21; Texas, 809 F.3d at 151–55. \n  Plaintiff States have standing under the normal inquiry because they are entitled to \nspecial solicitude.  Plaintiff States have standing to challenge the CMS Mandate because the \nGovernment Defendants’ actions harm Plaintiff States’ sovereign, proprietary, and parens \npatriae interests. \n  In State of Florida v. Becerra, __ F. Supp. 3d _, 2021 WL 2514138 (M.D. Fla. June 18, \n2021) the State of Florida attacked a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) \n“conditional order,” which required a series of steps before cruise ships were allowed to sail.  \nThe Court found Florida had standing to protect its proprietary interests and its sovereign \ninterests. \n  The State of Texas was found to have standing in a suit against the U.S. Dept. of \nHomeland Security’s 100 day pause of the removal of illegal aliens in Texas v. U.S., 524 F. \nSupp. 3d 598 (S.D. Tex., February 23, 2021). In State v. Biden, 10 F. 4th 538 (5th Cir. 2021), the \nState of Texas was also found to have standing based on “special solicitude.”  (Injunction request \nagainst the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security to suspend its Migrant Protection Protocols.) \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 9 of 34 PageID #:  640\n  Texas was again found to have standing under “special solicitude” in Texas v. U.S., 809 \nF. 3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015).  Texas sued to prevent implementation of a DAPA Program by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.  The Fifth Circuit further noted that, pursuant to their \nsovereign interest, states may have standing based on federal assertions of authority to regulate \nmatters they believe they control, federal preemption of state law, and interference with the \nenforcement of state law. Id. at 153. \n  In Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592 (1982), the U.S. Supreme \nCourt held Puerto Rico, like a state, had “parens patriae” standing to bring an action against east \ncoast apple growers for allegedly violating federal law in preferring domestic laborers over \nforeign temporary workers.   Puerto Rico was found to have a “quasi-sovereign” interest on \nbehalf of its residents. \n  In Texas v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 933 F.3d 433 (5th Cir. 2019), \nthe Fifth Circuit found standing for Texas after there was an increased regulatory burden, \npressure to change state law, and deprivation of a procedural right to protect its concrete \ninterests. \n  A.  Injury in Fact \n  A plaintiff seeking to establish injury in fact must show that it suffered “an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest” that is “concrete,” “particularized,” and “actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548, 194 L. Ed. 2d 635 \n(2016), as revised (May 24, 2016).  For an injury to be “particularized,” it “must affect the \nplaintiff in a personal and individual way.”  Id. at 1548.  A “concrete” injury must be “de facto,” \nthat is, it must “actually exist.”  “Concrete” is not, however necessarily synonymous with \n“tangible.”  Intangible injuries can nevertheless be “concrete.”  Id., at 1548-49. \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 10 of 34 PageID #:  641\n  This Court finds the Plaintiff States’ alleged injuries are both particularized and concrete.  \nPlaintiff States have a “parens patriae” standing and/or a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting \nits citizens from being required to submit to vaccinations.  Additionally, the Plaintiff States have \nstanding to regulate matters they believe they control, to attack preemption of state law by a \nfederal agency, and to protect the enforcement of state law.  The CMS Mandate specifically \npreempts state laws with regard to COVID-19 Vaccine requirements and/or exemptions. \n  The Plaintiff States also have standing and injury, based upon the alleged loss of jobs, \nloss of businesses, loss of tax revenue, and other damages allegedly resulting from employees \nbeing fired for refusing the vaccine and/or providers being terminated by CMS from the \nMedicare/Medicaid provider agreement. \n  B.  Traceability \n  Plaintiff States must show a “fairly traceable” link between their alleged injuries and the \nCMS Mandate.  As a general matter, the causation required for standing purposes can be \nestablished with “no more than de facto causality.”  Dep't of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, \n2556, 204 L. Ed. 2d 978 (2019).  The plaintiff need not demonstrate that the defendant’s actions \nare “the very last step in the chain of causation.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169–70, 117 S. \nCt. 1154, 137 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1997). \n  Here, there is an obvious link between the CMS Mandate and the Plaintiff States’ alleged \ninjuries.  All of the above alleged injuries are “fairly traceable” to CMS’s Mandate. \n  C.  Redressability \n  The redressability element of standing to sue requires a plaintiff to demonstrate “a \nsubstantial likelihood that the requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact.”  El Paso \nCty., Texas v. Trump, 982 F.3d 332, 341 (5th Cir. 2020). \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 11 of 34 PageID #:  642\n  The Plaintiff States have demonstrated a substantial likelihood that the requested relief \nwould remedy the alleged injury in fact.  If Plaintiff States are successful in having the CMS \nMandate declared invalid, this would redress their alleged injuries. \n  4.  Special Solicitude \n  Although this Court has found that Plaintiff States have proven standing through the \nnormal inquiry, they also can establish standing as a result of special solicitude.  Plaintiff States \nassert a congressionally bestowed procedural right, the Administrative Procedures Act (“the \nAPA”), and the government action at issue affects the Plaintiff States’ quasi-sovereign interests \n(damage to citizens, loss of jobs, businesses, loss of tax funding and/or protection of State laws). \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 519–20. \n  Therefore, any infirmity in Plaintiff States’ demonstration of traceability or redressability \nare remedied by the Plaintiff States’ special solicitude. \nIV.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n  A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded of right.  Benisek v. \nLamone, 138 S. Ct. 1942, 1943, 201 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2018).  In each case, the courts must balance \nthe competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or \nwithholding of the requested relief.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24, 129 S. \nCt. 365, 172 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2008). \n  The standard for a preliminary injunction requires a movant to show (1) the substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof a preliminary injunction, (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.  Benisek, 138 S. Ct. at 1944.  The party seeking relief must \nsatisfy a cumulative burden of proving each of the four elements enumerated before a temporary \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 12 of 34 PageID #:  643\nrestraining order or preliminary injunction can be granted.  Clark v. Prichard, 812 F.2d 991, 993 \n(5th Cir. 1987).  None of the four prerequisites has a quantitative value.  State of Tex. v. Seatrain \nInt'l, S. A., 518 F.2d 175, 180 (5th Cir. 1975). \n  A.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n  Plaintiff States argue that (1) the Government Defendants issued the CMS Mandate \nwithout following statutorily required processes (5 U.S.C. 553), (2) the CMS Mandate is beyond \nthe authority of the Government Defendants, (3) the CMS Mandate is contrary to law, (4) the \nCMS Mandate is arbitrary and capricious in violation of 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), and (5) the CMS \nMandate violates the Spending Clause, Tenth Amendment and Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. \n    BST Holdings, LLC v. OSHA \n  It is not often a Court has such a recent Circuit Court case addressing an almost identical \nissue.  We do here.  In BST Holdings, LLC v. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \nNo. 21-60845 17 F.4th 604 (5th Cir. November 12, 2021), the Fifth Circuit addressed a request \nfor a stay as to the OSHA vaccine mandate which was put into place by way of an EST on \nNovember 5, 2021.  The OSHA vaccine mandate required employees of covered employers to \nundergo a COVID-19 vaccination or to take weekly COVID-19 tests and wear a mask.13   \n  The Court initially stayed the OSHA Mandate because of perceived grave statutory and \nConstitutional issues pending briefing and an expedited judicial review.14  The Court, after \nconducting the expedited judicial review, reaffirmed the initial stay.  Many of the issues are \nsimilar to the issues here included in the CMS Mandate.  The factors the Court evaluate for a \nstay are similar to factors that are evaluated for a preliminary injunction, including a strong \n \n13 86 Fed. Reg. 61402 (Nov. 5, 2021). \n14 2021 WL 5166656. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 13 of 34 PageID #:  644\nlikelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury to the applicant, and where the public \ninterest lies .15 \n  In finding the applicants were likely to succeed on the merits, the Court made the \nfollowing findings: \n  1)  the OSHA Mandate was both overinclusive (“one-size-fits-all sledgehammer”)  \n    and underinclusive (did not apply to employers with 98 or fewer workers;16 \n \n  2)  the OSHA Mandate was not an “emergency” response  under 29 U.S.C. 655,  \n    since OSHA spent nearly two months (September 9, 2021 to November 5, 2021)  \n    responding to it;  \n \n  3)  the OSHA Mandate grossly exceeded OSHA’s statutory authority, No. 21-60845  \n    at 7. \n \n  The Court stated the Applicants had made a compelling argument that, although 29 \nU.S.C. 655 gave broad authority to OSHA, to avoid “giving unintended breadth to Acts of \nCongress” the Court should use the principle of “noscitur a sociis” – meaning, a word is known \nby the company it keeps – to limit OSHA’s authority.17 \n  The Court also found the COVID-19 pandemic was not the type of grave danger 29 \nU.S.C. 655 contemplates, noting that the OSHA Mandate made no attempt to explain why \nOSHA and the President were against CMS Mandates previously.  The Court noted it is \ngenerally “arbitrary and capricious” to depart from a prior policy without providing a detailed \nexplanation. \n  The Court further noted the OSHA Mandate raised serious constitutional concerns that \neither make it more likely that the petitioners will succeed on the merits, or at least counsel \n \n15 No. 21-60845 of 5. \n16 “The underinclusive nature of the Mandate implies that the Mandate’s true purpose is not to ensure workplace \nsafety, but instead to ramp up vaccine uptake by any means necessary. No. 21-60845 at 15. \n17 Neighboring phrase of “toxicity” and “poisonousness” in the statute did not give OSHA authority to mandate \nvaccines. \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 14 of 34 PageID #:  645\nagainst adopting OSHA’s broad reading of Section 655(c) as a matter of statutory interpretation.  \nThe “serious Constitutional concerns” found by the Court in BST Holdings are some of the same \nones at issue in the case at bar. \n  The “serious Constitutional concerns” noted by the Court in BST Holdings were: \n  (a)  that the OSHA Mandate exceeded the federal government’s authority under the  \n    Commerce Clause because it regulated noneconomic inactivity (person’s choice  \n    to remain unvaccinated) that falls squarely within the State’s police power; \n \n  (b)  that separation of powers principles (“the major questions doctrine”)18 casts  \n    doubt over the OSHA Mandate’s assertion of virtually unlimited power to control  \n    individual conduct under the guise of a workplace regulation. \n \n  Additionally, the Court found “irreparable harm” to the petitioners’ liberty interests19 of \nhaving to choose between their jobs and the vaccine.  The Court noted that the loss of \nconstitutional freedoms for even minimal periods of time constitutes irreparable injury.20 \n  The Court also found a stay of the OSHA Mandate to be in the public interest in \nmaintaining the country’s constitutional structure and maintaining the liberty of individuals and \nto make intensely personal decisions, even when those decisions frustrate government officials. \n    1.  Statutorily Required Processes – 5 U.S.C. 553 \n  The Court will now address Plaintiff States’ five arguments.  Title 5 U.S.C. 553 of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act requires federal agency rules to undergo notice and comment \nunless they are exempt.  The federal agency is required to give general notice of proposed \nrulemaking to be published in the Federal Register not more than thirty days before the proposed \nrules’ effective date and to give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule \n \n18 The “major questions doctrine” holds that Congress must speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency, \ndecisions of vast economic and political significance.  Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014). \n19 In addition to the free religious exercise of certain employees. \n20 Elrod v. Burns 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976). \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 15 of 34 PageID #:  646\nmaking through submission of written data, views, or arguments.  Failure to give required notice \nand comment requires the rule to be vacated. \n  This “notice and comment” procedure does not apply to interpretive rules, general \nstatements of policy, rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice, or when the agency \nfinds “good cause” for not requiring notice and comment.  The Government Defendants did not \ngo through the notice and comment process with regard to the CMS Mandate.  The CMS \nMandate became effective on November 5, 2021,  which is the same day it was published in the \nFederal Register. \n  The vaccine mandate is not alleged to be an interpretive rule, a general statement or \npolicy, or a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice.  The failure to perform the \nrequired notice and comment is entirely based upon the “good cause” exception. \n  Title 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) states: \n  (B)  this section does not apply -- when the agency for good cause finds (and \nincorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons thereafter in the rules issued) that notice \nand public procedure therein are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. \n  In failing to perform the notice and comment procedure, CMS found good cause.  86 Fed. \nReg. 61583-86.  The reasons given by CMS for failing to perform the notice and comment \nprocedure were: \n  1.  2021 outbreaks associated with the SARS-Cov-2 Delta variant have shown that  \n    current levels of vaccination coverage have been inadequate, requiring no delay; \n \n  2.  Encouraging vaccinations through public education campaigns and through State  \n    and employer-based efforts among healthcare staff to has been inadequate; \n  3.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to strain the U.S. healthcare systems, most of \n    which patients are unvaccinated; \n  4.  Although hospitalizations and deaths have begun to trend downward, there are  \n    emerging indications of potential increases during the upcoming colder months; \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 16 of 34 PageID #:  647\n  5.  The upcoming 2021-2022 influenza season could be more severe than normal,  \n    and vaccinations would decrease stress on the U.S. health care system; \n  6.  The upcoming 2021-2022 influenza season could result in infections of both  \n    influenza and COVID-19, which would result in more severe medical outcomes; \n  7.  Since health care workers were among the first groups provided access to the  \n    vaccinations, many did not get vaccinations due to the initial emergency use  \n    authorization.  Now that one of the vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech) has been fully  \n    approved by the FDA, more healthcare workers will want to get the vaccine; \n  8.  The estimates of healthcare workers deaths and/or positive tests for COVID-19  \n    have likely been underestimated since healthcare workers status has only been  \n    reported in approximately 18% of cases; \n  9.  Healthcare workers who are unvaccinated may pose a direct threat to patients; \n  10.  The COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing  \n    COVID-19 cases and severe outcomes; \n  11.  The COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing  \n    infections; and \n  12.  It would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay imposing the \n    CMS Mandate due to a combination of all factors.     \n   \n  The “good cause” exception in 5 U.S.C. 553 is read narrowly in order to avoid providing \nagencies with an escape clause from the ADA notice and comment requirements.  United States \nv. Johnson, 632 F.3d 912 (5th Cir. 2011).  Circumstances justifying reliance on this exception are \n“indeed rare.”  Council of Southern Mountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 573 (D.C.C. 1981).  \nThe good cause exception was described in Sorenson Communications, Inc. v. F.C.C., 755 F.3d \n702 (D.C.C. 2014) as “meticulous and demanding,” “narrowly construed,” “reluctantly \ncountenanced,” and evoked only in “emergency situations.” \n  Due to this stringent standard, the good cause exception to notice and comment is rarely \nupheld.  See U.S. v. Johnson 632 F.3d 912, 928 (5th Cir. 2011) (need for immediate guidance \nunder the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act and in prior attempts to protect the \npublic were not good cause); Mack Trucks, Inc. v. E.P.A. 682 F.3d 87, 94-95 (D.C. Cir. 2012) \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 17 of 34 PageID #:  648\n(EPA interim final rule requiring penalties for sellers of non-compliant diesel engines not good \ncause when one manufacturer would be unable to sell the engines without the interim rule); \nSorenson Communications, Inc. v.

Becerra, _ F.Supp. 3d _, 2021 WL 2514138 at 35-36 (M.D. Florida, \nJune 18, 2021) (CDC did not have good cause for a rule issuing a conditional sailing order for \ncruise ships due to COVID-19); Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. United States Dept. of \nHealth and Human Resources, 510 F.Supp. 3d, 29, 48 (S.D. NY. December 30, 2020) (CMS’s \nrule regulating drug prices based on the Most Favored Nation Rule was not good cause where \nreasons were general risks of high drug prices and the COVID-19 pandemic); Regeneron \nPharmaceuticals, Inc. v. United States Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 510 F.Supp. 3d, \n29, 48 (S.D. NY. December 30, 2020) (not good cause where reasons by DHS for an interim \nfinal rule regarding prevailing wages with regard to the VISA program were based on the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and economic consequences of it); Chamber of Commerce of the United \nStates v. United States Dept. of Homeland Security, 504 F. Supp. 3d 1077, 1094 (N.D. Cal., \nDecember 1, 2020); Association of Community Cancer Centers v. Azar, 509 F. Supp. 3d 482, \n496 (D. Maryland, December 23, 2020) (not good cause where CMS claimed reduced costs \nwould help alleviate financial instability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic). \n  There are fewer cases where the good cause exception was upheld.  In Council of \nSouthern Mountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 573 (D.C. Cir. 1981), calling it an “extremely \nclose case,” the Court upheld the Secretary of Labor postponing the implementation of Mine \nSafety and Health Adm. Regulations dealing with self-contained self-rescuers which provided \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 18 of 34 PageID #:  649\noxygen to miners after a cave-in.   The deadline was extended for six months due to only a small \nnumber of the devices being available, the agency acted with diligence, it was deferred for a very \nshort period of time, and circumstances were beyond the agency’s control. \n  It should be noted that this issue was discussed in BST Holdings at 8, but OSHA had \nauthority for a six-month “emergency temporary standard” (“ETS”) pursuant to 29 U.S.C., \n655(a)(1).  Although the notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 did not apply, the \nCourt did not believe COVID-19 posed the kind of grave danger required for an ETS.  The Court \nstated: \nThe Mandate’s stated impetus – a purported “emergency” that the entire \nglobe has now endured for nearly two years, and which OSHA itself \nspent nearly two months responding to-is unavailing as well.  \n \nNo. 21-60845 at 7. \n  Government Defendants maintain they had “good cause” for the reasons set forth by \nCMS in the CMS Mandate.  The Government Defendants argue that the Secretary is entitled to \ndeference as to his predictive judgment that COVID-19 cases would increase during the winter \nmonths and put a burden on the healthcare system.   \n  After reviewing the reasons listed by CMS for bypassing the notice and comment \nrequirement, the Court finds Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on the merits on this claim.  It \ntook CMS almost two months, from September 9, 2021 to November 5, 2021, to prepare the \ninterim final rule at issue.  Evidently, the situation was not so urgent that notice and comment \nwere not required.  It took CMS longer to prepare the interim final rule without notice than it \nwould have taken to comply with the notice and comment requirement.  Notice and comment \nwould have allowed others to comment upon the need for such drastic action before its \nimplementation. \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 19 of 34 PageID #:  650\n  It does not appear to this Court that the Government Defendants will be able to meet the \nstringent requirements for the good cause exception in 5 U.S.C. 553 to apply. \n    2.  Authority of The Government Defendants \n  Plaintiff States maintain that the CMS Mandate must also be enjoined because it exceeds \nthe Government Defendants’ authority.  The U.S. DHH and the CMS are a part of the Executive \nBranch of the government. \n  Only Congress, as the Legislative branch, has the authority to make laws.21  The \nExecutive branch must take care that the laws be faithfully executed.22  Because the Executive \nbranch cannot make laws, it is given its powers through Acts of Congress. \n  The CMS claims authority to issue the CMS Mandate through Sections 1102 and 1871 of \nthe Social Security Act.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61560.  Sections 1102 and 1871 are set out in 42 U.S.C. \n1302 and 42 U.S.C. 1395hh.  Title 42 U.S.C. 1395hh gives the Secretary authority to “prescribe \nsuch regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs \nunder this subchapter.”  The remaining portions of 1395hh deal with procedure for the \nregulations. \n42 U.S.C. 1302 states: \n \n(a) The Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, respectively, shall make and \npublish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as \nmay be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with \nwhich each is charged under this chapter. \n \n  Additionally, the Government Defendants reference “Table 1: Authorities for All \nProviders and Suppliers,” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567, which sets out statutory authority for each \nspecific category of Provider/Supplier. \n \n21 Article I, Section 8, United States Constitution. \n22 Article II, Section 3, United States Constitution. \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 20 of 34 PageID #:  651\n  Sections 1102 and Section 1871 are general authorizations to prescribe rules and \nregulations that may be necessary to carry out the Medicaid and Medicare programs.  The \nStatutes listed in Table 1 are also general authority to specify “standards” for the various types of \nproviders and suppliers.  None of these statutes give the Government Defendants the \n“superpowers” they claim.  Not only do the statutes not specify such superpowers, but principles \nof separation of powers weigh heavily against such powerful authority being transferred to a \ngovernment agency by general authority. \n  Major Questions Doctrine \n  The “major questions doctrine” requires that Congress must “speak clearly if it wishes to \nassign to an agency, decisions of vast economic and political significance.”  Utility Air \nRegulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014).  In Utility Air, the U.S. Supreme Court \nfound that EPA exceeded its authority when the EPA adjusted levels set forth in the Clean Air \nAct regarding greenhouse-gas emissions. \n  Like the present case, EPA used general authority to expand its power.  Justice Scalia \nwrote: \nEPA’s interpretation is also unreasonable because it would bring about \nan enormous and transformative expansion in EPA’s regulatory authority \nwithout clear congressional authorization.  When an agency claims to \ndiscover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate “a \nsignificant portion of the American economy,” Brown & Williamson, \n529 U.S. at 159, 120 S. Ct. 1291, we typically greet its announcement \nwith a measure of skepticism.  We expect Congress to speak clearly if it \nwishes to assign an agency decision of vast “economic and political \nsignificance.”  573 U.S. at 324. \n \n  This is exactly what has occurred in this case.  Government Defendants have used \ngeneral authority statutes to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for over 10.3 million healthcare \nworkers.  Certainly, this is a decision of vast economic and political significance. \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 21 of 34 PageID #:  652\n  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the same with the similar OSHA Vaccine \nMandate in BST Holdings.  Judge Engelhardt wrote: \nThere is no clear expression of Congressional intent in Section 655(c) to \nconvey OSHA such broad authority, and this Court will not infer one.  \nNor can the Article II executive breathe new power into OSHA’s \nauthority – no matter how thin patience wears.  No. 21-60845, at 18. \n \nSee also Food and Drug Admin. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. 529 U.S. 120, 159 \n(2000); Alabama Association of Realtors v. Dept. of Health and Human Resources, 141 S.Ct. \n2485, 2489 (2021); Tiger Lily, LLC v. United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, 5 F.4th 666, (6th Cir. 2021); Paul v. United States, 140 S.Ct. 342 (2019); State of \nFlorida v. Becerra, 2021 WL 2514138 at 20 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2021); and King v. Burwell, 576 \nU.S. 473, 486 (2015). \n  The Government Defendants maintain this general authorization gives them authority to \nmandate vaccines to 10.3 million healthcare workers arguing CMS can do almost anything the \nSecretary feels is necessary to ensure the health and safety of patients.  The “major questions \ndoctrine” is not addressed. \n  Alabama Association of Realtors supra warrants discussion.  In finding the nationwide \neviction moratorium enacted by the CDC beyond the CDC’s authority, the CDC had a statute \nthat was more broadly worded than the ones the CMS uses in this case.  The Supreme Court \ncalled the expansive authority of CDC “unprecedented,” and stated “Section 361(a)23 is a wafer-\nthin reed on which to rest such sweeping power.”  141 S.Ct. at 2489. \n  There is no question that mandating a vaccine to 10.3 million healthcare workers is \nsomething that should be done by Congress, not a government agency.  It is not clear that even \n \n23 The statute used for CDC’s authority. \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 22 of 34 PageID #:  653\nan Act of Congress mandating a vaccine would be constitutional.  Certainly, CMS does not have \nthis authority by a general authorization statue. \n  Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on their claim that the Government Defendants \nexceeded their authority in enacting the CMS Mandate. \n    3.  Contrary to Law \n  The Plaintiff States additionally claim that the CMS Mandate is contrary to law, arguing \nthat it violates additional provisions in the Social Security Act.  The first provision Plaintiff \nStates claim the mandate violates is 42 U.S.C. 1395z, which requires the Secretary to consult \nwith appropriate state agencies relating to conditions of participation by providers of services.  \nThe Government Defendants concede that the CMS Mandate was issued without complying with \nthis directive, but state they will meet with the State  agencies FOLLOWING the issuance of this \nrule.24 \n  The second provision Plaintiff States claim the mandate violates is 42 U.S.C. 1395, \nwhich provides that nothing in the Social Security Act shall be construed to exercise any \nsupervision or control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which medical services are \nprovided, or over the situation, tenure or compensation of any officer or employee of any \ninstitution, agency, or person providing health services; or to exercise any supervision or control \nover the administration or operation of any such institution, agency, or person.  Plaintiff States \nargue these provisions prohibit the dictation of the hiring and firing policies of these institutions \nfor unvaccinated workers.  The statute also prohibits supervision and control over both the \n“selection” and “tenure” of unvaccinated employees. \n \n24 86 Fed. Reg. at 61567. \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 23 of 34 PageID #:  654\n  The third provision Plaintiff States claim the mandate violates is 42 U.S.C. 1302(b)(1), \nwhich requires that whenever the Secretary publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking \nfor any rule or regulation proposed that “may” have a significant impact on the operations of a \nsubstantial number of small rural hospitals, an initial regulatory impact analysis is to be \nconducted. Plaintiff States argue the CMS Mandate “may” have a significant impact on a \nsubstantial number of small rural hospitals due to loss of workers and/or income due to the CMS \nMandate.  No regulatory impact analysis for rural hospitals was conducted in this case. \n  Because the Government Defendants did not comply with any of the above provisions, \nthe Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on the merits that the CMS Mandate is contrary to  \nlaw. \n    4.  Arbitrary and Capricious \n  Federal administrative agencies are required to engage in reasoned decision-making.  \nAllentown Mack Sales & Serv., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 522 U.S. 359, 374, 118 S. Ct. 818, 139 L. Ed. 2d \n797 (1998).  The Plaintiff States allege the CMS Mandate is arbitrary and capricious under Title \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A). \n  If an administrative agency does not engage in reasoned decision making, a court, under \nthe APA, shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings and conclusions found to be \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. \n706(2)(A). \n  The grounds upon which an administrative order must be judged are those upon which \nthe record discloses that its action was based.  Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. \n80, 87, 63 S. Ct. 454, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943). \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 24 of 34 PageID #:  655\n  Plaintiff States argue Government Defendants’ CMS Mandate ignores the Social Security \nAct’s focus on patient wellbeing and instead focuses on the health of healthcare providers.  The \nPlaintiff States further maintain the goal of the CMS Mandate is to increase individual vaccine \nrates, which will actually have the effect of harming patient well-being due to staff shortages of \nproviders and suppliers. \n  This is backed up by a number of declarations of various individuals that verify \nhealthcare worker shortages, a significant number of healthcare workers that remain \nunvaccinated, and the harm that will be caused to these facilities in the event that even a few of \nthe unvaccinated healthcare workers quit or are fired as a result of the CMS Mandate.25  Some of \nthe declarations also verify the huge percentage of money paid to these facilities through the \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs, showing these facilities would have to shut down or severely \ncut back on healthcare services if funding is cut off by the Government Defendants to these \nfacilities.26  The Plaintiff States also provided a declaration which shows the increased \nenforcement costs that would result if required to survey and enforce the CMS Mandate.27 \n  In other words, the Plaintiff States maintain that although the purpose of the Social \nSecurity Act is to help healthcare patients, the CMS Mandate would have the opposite effect due \nto the loss of healthcare workers and funding to healthcare facilities.  This is not the “reasoned \ndecision-making” required by the APA.  Requiring COVID-19 vaccinations to healthcare \nworkers covered by the mandate would hurt the patients the Social Security Act was meant to \nhelp. \n \n25 Doc. No. 2-2, 2-3, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-9, 2-10, 2-11, 2-12 and 2-16. \n26 Doc. No. 2-4, 2-5, 2-15. \n27 Doc. No. 2-14. \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 25 of 34 PageID #:  656\n  Additionally, the Plaintiff States argue the Government Defendants failed to consider or \narbitrarily rejected obvious alternatives to the CMS Mandate.  These alternatives include daily or \nweekly COVID-19 testing, wearing masks or shields, natural immunity and/or social distancing.  \nThe Plaintiff States maintain the apparent rejection of these alternatives to COVID-19 vaccines \nis unsupported by evidence.  The Declaration of Tracy Gruber28 declares that since July 2021, \nemployees at the Utah State Hospital and Utah State Development Center have been required to \nbe vaccinated or take a weekly COVID-19 test.  That alternative has caused no apparent harm to \npatients or staff. \n  The rejection of natural immunity as an alternative is puzzling.  Natural immunity is the \nimmunity of people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.  In rejecting this \nalternative, the CMS Mandate stated: \nWhile a significant number of healthcare staff have been infected with \nSARS-Co-V2, evidence indicates their infection-induced immunity, also \ncalled “natural immunity” is not equivalent to receiving the COVID-19 \nvaccine.  \n \n86 Fed. Reg. at 61559.   \n  The “evidence” CMS relied upon in rejecting that alternative is not provided.  The \nDeclaration of Dr. Jay Bhattachary,29 Director of Stanford University’s Center for Demography \nand Economics of Health and Aging disputes CMS’s assertion that natural immunity is not \nequivalent to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.  Citing studies from Qatar (which tracked 927,321 \nindividuals for six months after COVID-19 vaccinations), California (which tracked the infection \nrates from over 5 million patients vaccinated with two Pfizer doses), and U.S. Veterans (which \ntracked 620,000 vaccinated U.S. Veterans), Plaintiff States assert these studies overwhelmingly \n \n28 Doc. No. 2-8. \n29 Doc. No. 2-13. \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 26 of 34 PageID #:  657\nconclude that natural immunity provides equivalent or greater protection against severe infection \nthan immunity generated by COVID-19 vaccines. \n  The CMS Mandate does not yet require boosters to the COVID-19 vaccines.  However, \nthe CDC recently recommended boosters.30  If boosters are needed six months after being “fully \nvaccinated,” then how good are the COVID-19 vaccines, and why is it necessary to mandate \nthem? \n  Additionally, the Plaintiff States provided evidence in the Declaration of Dr. Peter A. \nMcCullough31 that the COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent transmission of the disease among the \nvaccinated or mixed vaccinated/unvaccinated populations, and that mandatory COVID-19 \nvaccines for hospitals do not increase safety for employees or hospital patients.  McCullough \ndeclared that additional treatment with other drugs and supplements has resulted in an 85% \nreduction in hospitalizations and death of high-risk individuals presenting with COVID-19. \n  Of note, Dr. McCullough declared the Delta variant of SARS-Cov-2 accounts for 98.9% \nof the present cases in the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel.  Dr. McCullough further \ndeclared that because of the progressive mutation of the spike protein, the virus has achieved an \nimmune escape from COVID-19 vaccines.  He stated the Delta variant is not adequately covered \nby the vaccines.  In other words, even if you are fully vaccinated, you still may become infected \nwith the COVID-19 virus32.   \n  The Plaintiff States further argue that CMS failed to adequately explain its departure \nfrom its prior position of not requiring mandatory vaccines.  An agency must provide a more \ndetailed justification when a new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict those which \n \n30 cdc.gov (November 19, 2021). \n31 Doc. No. 2-17. \n32 CDC also noted the WHO (World Health Organization) has classified a new variant named Omicron, cdc.gov \n(November 29, 2021). \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 27 of 34 PageID #:  658\nunderlay its prior policy.  State v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 554 (5th Cir. 2021); FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009). \n  Although CMS spent pages and pages attempting to explain the need for mandatory \nCOVID-19 vaccines, when infection and hospitalizations rates are dropping, millions of people \nhave already been infected, developing some form of natural immunity, and when people who \nhave been fully vaccinated still become infected, mandatory vaccines as the only method of \nprevention make no sense. \n  The Plaintiff States also argue that CMS’s rationale is flagrantly pretextual.  The \nGovernment Defendants say it is not pretextual, but it is obvious that the mandate was enacted as \na result of President Biden’s September 9, 2021, declaration of his intention to impose a national \nCMS Mandate.33  Both the CMS and OSHA vaccine mandates were published on the same day, \nNovember 5, 2021.  However, the 46-page CMS Mandate does not even mention President \nBiden’s declaration of a national vaccine mandate.  The presence of pretext is enough to render a \nrule arbitrary and capricious.34 \n  The Plaintiff States also argue the CMS Mandate ignores the Plaintiff States’ \noverwhelming reliance interests in their Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The CMS Mandate is \narbitrary and capricious if CMS ignores those reliance interests.  DHS v. Regents of the \nUniversity of California, 140 S.Ct. 1891, 1913-14 (2020).  The Plaintiff States have substantial \nreliance interests in those programs.35  The threatened cutoff of federal funding would be \ndevastating to the Plaintiff States’ healthcare facilities.  CMS’s plan to meet with the appropriate \nstate agency after the rule is issued (86 Fed. Reg. at 61567) would be too late.  By that time, \n \n33 See FN  11. \n34 Department of Commerce v. New York, 139 S.Ct. at 2575-76. \n35 No. 2-4. \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 28 of 34 PageID #:  659\nunwilling healthcare employees would have had to decide whether to take the vaccine or quit \ntheir jobs. \n  Lastly, the Plaintiff States allege the “scope” of the CMS Mandate is arbitrary and \ncapricious.  The Plaintiff States argue that the CMS Mandate applies to all ages, even to \npsychiatric residential treatment facilities for individuals under twenty-one years of age,36 which \nis not related to CMS’s asserted interest in protecting elderly and infirm patients from COVID-\n19 transmissions.37  As noted by the Court in BST Holdings in regard to the OSHA Mandate: \nThe Mandate is a one-size-fits-all sledgehammer that makes hardly any \nattempt to account for differences in workplaces (and workers) that have \nmore than a little bearing on workers’ varying degrees of susceptibility \nto the supposedly “grave danger” the Mandate purports to address.  \n \nNo. 21-60845 at 8. \n \n  The Plaintiff States have made a substantial showing that they are likely to succeed on \nthe merits of their arbitrary and capricious claim. \n    5.  Other Constitutional Issues \n  Other arguments made by the Plaintiff States are based upon a violation of the States’ \npolice power, violation of the Spending Clause, violation of the Tenth Amendment and violation \nof the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. \n      (a)  Police Power/Tenth Amendment   \n  In the federal system, the federal government has limited powers.  The States and the \npeople retain the remainder.38  The States have broad authority to enact legislation for the public \ngood (“police power”), but the federal government has no such authority, and can only exercise \nthe powers granted to it, including the power to make all laws which may be necessary and \n \n36 86 Fed. Reg. at 61576. \n37 86 Fed.  Reg. at 61610. \n38 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 29 of 34 PageID #:  660\nproper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers.  If the federal government would \nradically readjust the balance of state and national authority, those charged with the duty of \nlegislating must be reasonably explicit about it.  The Supreme Court will not be quick to assume \nCongress has meant to effect a significant change into the sensitive state and federal relations.  \nCongress does not normally intrude upon the police power of States.  Bond v. United States, 572 \nU.S. 844, 857-58 (2014). \n  Absent a clear statement of intention from Congress, there is a presumption against \nstatutory construction that would significantly affect the federal-state balance.  Boelens v. \nRedman Homes, Inc. 748 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir. 1984). \n  The CMS Mandate specifically preempts state and local law.  86 Fed. Reg. at 61572.  As \nnoted by the Fifth Circuit in BST Holdings: \nFirst, the Mandate likely exceeds the federal government’s authority \nunder the Commerce Clause because it regulates noneconomic inactivity \nthat falls squarely within the States’ police power.  A person’s choice to \nremain unvaccinated and forego regular testing is noneconomic \ninactivity.  Cf. NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 522 (2012) (Roberts, C.J. \nconcurring); see also Id. at 652-53 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  And to \nmandate that a person receive a vaccine or undergo testing falls squarely \nwithin the States’ police power.  Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174, 176 (1922) \n(noting that precedent had long “settled that it is within the police power \nof a state to provide for compulsory vaccination”); Jacobson v. \nMassachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25-26 (1905) (Similar). No. 21-60845 at 16-\n17. \n \n  The Plaintiff States make a strong case that the CMS Mandate violates the States’ police \npower. \n      (b)  Anti-Commandeering Doctrine \n  The Anti-Commandeering Doctrine is simply the expression of a fundamental structural \ndecision incorporated into the Constitution, i.e., the decision to withhold from Congress the \npower to issue orders directly to the States.  Congress cannot command a state government to \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 30 of 34 PageID #:  661\nenact state legislation.  The Tenth Amendment confirms that all other power is reserved to the \nStates.  Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletics Ass’n., 138 S.Ct. 1461, 1476 (2018). \n  In Printz v. U.S., 521 U.S. 898, 928 (1997), the Court held invalid a federal law that \ncommanded state and local enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective \nhandgun purchasers and to perform certain related tasks. \n  Although many of the health care facilities required to track and regulate the CMS \nMandate are private, many are likely run by some or all of the Plaintiff States, which could result \nin violation of the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine.  As this Court is unable to tell (at this point) \nwhether and/or how many of the providers and suppliers are run by states, there is no evidence to \nprove the violation. \n      (c)  Non-Delegation Doctrine \n  Under the Non-Delegation Doctrine, Congress lacks the authority to delegate “unfiltered \npower” over the American economy to an executive agency.  Solid Waste Agency of Northern \nCook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 121 S.Ct. 675 (2001).39 \n  This is a similar doctrine to the Major Questions Doctrine, but if the Government \nDefendants have the power and authority they claim (to mandate vaccines for 10.3 million \nworkers), these government agencies would have almost “unfiltered power” over any healthcare \nprovider, supplier, and employees that are covered by the CMS Mandate.  If CMS has the \nauthority by a general authorization statute to mandate vaccines, they have authority to do almost \nanything they believe necessary, holding the hammer of termination of the Medicare/Medicaid \nProvider Agreement over healthcare facilities and suppliers. \n  The Plaintiff States are likely to succeed on the merits of this claim. \n \n39 There is a serious constitutional question of whether Congress could even transfer “unfettered power” to a \ngovernment agency.  Paul v. United States 140 S.Ct. 342 (2019) (Kavanaugh, J. Statement). \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 31 of 34 PageID #:  662\n      (d)  Spending Clause \n  The Spending Clause protects the status of States as independent sovereigns in our \nfederal system.  Under the Spending Clause,40 Congress may use its spending power to create \nincentives for states to act in accordance with federal policies, but when the pressure turns into \ncompulsion, the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.  The Constitution simply \ndoes not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.  NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. \n519, 577 (2012). \n  In NFIB, a provision in the Affordable Care Act which required States that participated in \nMedicaid to expand their Medicaid programs with the threatened loss of all Medicaid funds to \nstates that refused to expand was held to be unconstitutionally coercive.  Since it is unclear at this \ntime whether there is state involvement with the providers, suppliers or employers, the Plaintiff \nStates are at this time not likely to succeed on the merits of this issue.   \n  B.  Irreparable Injury \n  The second requirement for a preliminary injunction is irreparable injury.  The Plaintiff \nStates must demonstrate “a substantial threat of irreparable injury” if the injunction is not issued.  \nTexas v. U.S., 809 F.3d 134, 150 (5th Cir. 2015).  For injury to be “irreparable,” plaintiffs need \nonly show it cannot be undone through monetary remedies.  Burgess v. Fed. Deposit Inc., Corp., \n871 F.3d 297, 304 (5th Cir. 2017). \n  Being deprived of a procedural right to protect its concrete interests (by violation of the \nADA’s notice and comment requirements) is irreparable injury.  Texas v. EEOC, 933 F.3d 433, \n447 (5th Cir. 2019). \n \n40 Article I, Section 8, United States Constitution \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 32 of 34 PageID #:  663\n  The Plaintiff States will suffer irreparable injury by not being able to enforce their laws \nwhich have been preempted by the CMS Mandate, by incurring the increased cost of training and \nof enforcing the CMS Mandate, and by having their police power encroached.  The Plaintiff \nStates’ citizens will suffer irreparable injury by having a substantial burden placed on their \nliberty interests because they will have to choose between losing their jobs or taking the vaccine.  \nAdditionally, the health care facilities and suppliers will be burdened with the task of tracking \nand enforcing the mandate or else face the loss of Medicare and Medicaid funding \n  The Plaintiff States have shown irreparable injury.   \n  C.  The Balance of Equities and The Public’s Interest \n  The Plaintiff States have satisfied the first two elements to obtain a preliminary \ninjunction.  The final two elements they must satisfy are that the threatened harm outweighs any \nharm that may result to the Government Defendants and that the injunction will not undermine \nthe public interest.  Valley v. Rapides Par. Sch. Bd., 118 F.3d 1047, 1051 (5th Cir. 1997).  These \ntwo factors overlap considerably.  Texas, 809 F.3d at 187.  In weighing equities, a court must \nbalance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting \nor withholding of the requested relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24.  The public interest factor requires \nthe court to consider what public interests may be served by granting or denying a preliminary \ninjunction.  Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 645 F.3d 978, 997–98 (8th Cir. 2011). \n  This Court believes the balance of equities and the public interest favors the issuance of a \npreliminary injunction.  The public interest is served by maintaining the constitutional structure \nand maintaining the liberty of individuals who do not want to take the COVID-19 vaccine.  This \ninterest outweighs Government Defendants’ interests.  It is very important that the public’s \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 33 of 34 PageID #:  664\ninterest be taken into account by the Court before allowing the Government Defendants to \nmandate the vaccines. \nV.  CONCLUSION \n  If the separation of powers meant anything to the Constitutional framers, it meant that the \nthree necessary ingredients to deprive a person of liberty or property – the power to make rules, \nto enforce them, and to judge their violations – could never fall into the same hands.  Tiger Lily, \nLLC v. United States Housing and Urban Development, 5 F.4th 666 (6th Cir. 2021). (Thapar, J. \nConcurrence). If the Executive branch is allowed to usurp the power of the Legislative branch to \nmake laws, two of the three powers conferred by the Constitution would be in the same hands. \n  If human nature and history teach anything, it is that civil liberties face grave risks when \ngovernments proclaim indefinite states of emergency.  Does 1-3 v. Mills, _ S.Ct. _, 2021 WL \n5027177 at 3 (October 29, 2021) (Gorsuch, J. dissenting). \n  During a pandemic such as this one, it is even more important to safeguard the separation \nof powers set forth in our Constitution to avoid erosion of our liberties.  Because the Plaintiff \nStates have satisfied all four elements required for a preliminary injunction to issue, this Court \nhas determined that a preliminary injunction should issue against the Government Defendants. \n  This matter will ultimately be decided by a higher court than this one.  However, it is \nimportant to preserve the status quo in this case.  The liberty interests of the unvaccinated \nrequires nothing less. \n  In addressing the geographic scope of the preliminary injunction, due to the nationwide \nscope of the CMS Mandate, a nationwide injunction is necessary due to the need for uniformity.  \nTexas, 809 F.3d at 187-88.  Although this Court considered limiting the injunction to the \nfourteen Plaintiff States, there are unvaccinated healthcare workers in other states who also need \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 28   Filed 11/30/21   Page 34 of 34 PageID #:  665\nprotection.  Therefore, the scope of this injunction will be nationwide, except for the states of \nAlaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Wyoming, North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, since these ten states are already under a preliminary injunction order dated \nNovember 29, 2021, out of the Eastern District of Missouri. \n  This Court will additionally address security under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65.  The requirement \nof security is discretionary.  Kaepa, Inc. v. Achilles Corp., 76 F.3d 624, 628 (5th Cir. 1996).  \nPlaintiff States are fourteen sovereign states.  This Court will not require Plaintiff States to post \nsecurity for this Preliminary Injunction. \n  For the reasons set forth in this Court’s ruling, Plaintiff States’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction [Doc. No. 2] is GRANTED.  Therefore, the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, along with their directors, \nemployees, Administrators and Secretaries are hereby ENJOINED and RESTRAINED from \nimplementing the CMS Mandate set forth in 86 Fed. Reg. 61555-01 (November 5, 2021) as to \nall healthcare providers, suppliers, owners, employees, and all others covered by said CMS \nMandate. \n  This preliminary injunction shall remain in effect pending the final resolution of this case, \nor until further orders from this Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, or \nthe United States Supreme Court. \n  No security bond shall be required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. \n  MONROE, LOUISIANA, this 30th day of November 2021. \n \n              ____________________________________ \n              TERRY A.

BACKGROUND \n  On November 5, 2021, the Government Defendants2 published an Interim Final Rule, \n(“IFR”) which revised the requirements that Medicare and Medicaid certified providers and \nsuppliers must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.  86 Fed. Reg. 61555-\n01 (“CMS Mandate).  The CMS Mandate required the staff of specific Medicare and Medicaid \nhealthcare providers to be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022.  In the event of a vaccine \nrequiring two doses, the first was required by December 6, 2021, and the second required by \nJanuary 4, 2022.  Failure to comply with the CMS Mandate may result in penalties up to and \nincluding “termination of the Medicare/Medicaid Provider Agreement.”  86 Fed.

Courts across the country have responded \n \n1 Attributed to 3rd century Greek Philosopher Sextus Empiricus, who wrote: “The mills of the gods grind slowly, but \nthey grind exceedingly fine.”  \n2 The Government Defendants consist of Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHH”), Chiquita Brooks–Lasure, in her official \ncapacity as Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). \n3 Along with three other vaccine mandates. \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 46   Filed 01/18/22   Page 2 of 6 PageID #:  759\nquickly.  In this specific case, the Plaintiff States4 filed a Complaint [Doc. No. 1] and Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction [Doc. No. 2] on November 15, 2021.  On November 30, 2021 [Doc. Nos. \n28, 29] this Court issued a Memorandum Ruling and Judgment GRANTING the Plaintiff States’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction.  Louisiana v. Becerra, 2021 WL 5609846 (W.D. La. \nNovember 30, 2021). \n  A Notice of Appeal [Doc. No. 31] was filed by Government Defendants on December 1, \n2021. On December 15, 2021, [Doc. No. 39] the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit DENIED the Government Defendants’ Motion to Stay as to the fourteen (14) states that \nfiled the suit and GRANTED the Government Defendants’ Motion to Stay the Preliminary \nInjunction with regard to nationwide jurisdiction [Doc. No. 39].  260 F.4th 260. \n  Thereafter, Government Defendants applied for writs to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates for a stay of the injunction in this case Missouri v. Biden, 2021 WL 5564501 (E.D. Mo., \nNovember 29, 2021).5  The Supreme Court held expedited oral arguments in this matter6 on \nJanuary 7, 2022.  On January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court issued a written ruling, Biden v. \nMissouri, 595 U.S. __ (2022) ___, 2022 WL 120950, which GRANTED the Government \nDefendants’ stay request, pending disposition of the Governments’ Appeal in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. \n  All in all, it took less than two months from the date of filing of the Complaint and \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction until a Supreme Court of the United States decision.

There has not yet been a merits hearing in this case and there remain several unresolved \nissues.   \n  At issue today is Government Defendants’ Motion to Stay Further Proceedings [Doc. No. \n40]. For the reasons more fully expressed herein, Government Defendants’ Motion to Stay \nFurther Proceedings is DENIED. \nII.  LAW AND ANALYSIS \n  In Government Defendants’ motion,7 Government Defendants ask the Court to stay \nfurther proceedings in this case while the issues in this case are considered by the Supreme Court \nand the Fifth Circuit.  A request of this nature would almost certainly normally be granted.  But \nthis is not a typical case. \n  This Court does not yet know the date that Government Defendants intend to require \nunvaccinated workers to be vaccinated subject to the CMS ruling.  Many of the Plaintiff States’ \nclaims have clearly been decided by the Supreme Court, but some have not.  Some of the \nremaining issues may require a merits hearing.  Whether the Fifth Circuit will remand the \nremaining issues to this Court for a merits hearing has not been determined. \n  Without knowing the answers to these questions this Court is hesitant to grant the \nrequested stay.  The Administrative Record has not yet been filed in this case.  A stay would \ndelay that being completed by Government Defendants and would ultimately delay any potential \nmerits hearing.  It is this Court’s intent to make sure the “wheels of justice” do not slow down.   \nThe unvaccinated staff of the Medicare and Medicaid certified providers and suppliers8 and the \n \n7 Filed prior to the Supreme Court’s January 13, 2022 ruling. \n8 Estimated to be 2.4 million healthcare workers. \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 46   Filed 01/18/22   Page 4 of 6 PageID #:  761\nproviders and suppliers themselves need to know when the CMS Mandate will require staff to be \nfully vaccinated. \n  Both have important decisions to make.  The providers and suppliers must decide \nwhether to allow a huge source of funding to be terminated or to discharge all unvaccinated \nstaff.9  The staff of the providers and suppliers (previously known as “healthcare heroes”), must \ndecide whether to become fully vaccinated by a medical procedure they obviously do not want or \nto quit their jobs, the very same jobs these heroes carried out to save lives when there were no \nvaccines.  \n  The big question is WHEN do the providers, suppliers, and staff have to make these \ndecisions?  Therefore, this Court will not consider granting a stay in this proceeding until it has \nthe answer to that question.10 \n  A.  Unresolved Issues \n  The Plaintiff States’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction listed five primary claims: (1) the \nGovernment issued the CMS Mandate without following statutorily required processes (5 U.S.C. \n553); (2) the CMS Mandate is beyond the authority of the Government Defendants; (3) the CMS \nMandate is contrary to law; (4) the CMS Mandate is arbitrary and capricious (5 U.S.C. 706); and \n(5) Constitutional issues – that the CMS Mandate violates the Spending Clause, Tenth \nAmendment, Police Power and Non-Delegation Doctrine, and Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. \n  This Court initially found the Plaintiff States were likely to succeed on the merits on One, \nTwo, Three, Four and parts of Five (Tenth Amendment Police Power and Non-Delegation \nDoctrine).  This Court was unable to determine whether the Plaintiff States were likely to \n \n9 The CMS Mandate provides no alternative for testing. \n10 For purposes of full disclosure, this Court is vaccinated with both doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  This \nCourt also was infected with COVID-19 after being fully vaccinated. \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 46   Filed 01/18/22   Page 5 of 6 PageID #:  762\nsucceed on the merits of the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine and the Spending Clause since it \nwas unclear from the evidence the extent and nature of state involvement.  \n  The Fifth Circuit only addressed claim number Two in finding the Plaintiff States were \nlikely to succeed on the merits.  20 F.4th 260 at 262-63. \n  The Supreme Court clearly addressed the above numbered issues in One, Two, Three and \nFour, but did not address any of the constitutional issues in number Five.  Biden v. Missouri 595 \nU.S. __ (2022) 2022 WL 120950.11  Therefore, it appears to this Court that issues remain \nregarding violations of the Tenth Amendment (Police Power and Non-Delegation Doctrine \nclaims), violation of the Spending Clause, and the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. \n  B.  Standard \n  A district court has general discretionary power to stay proceedings because it is in the \ncontrol of its docket and in the interests of justice.  In re. Beebe, 56 F.3d 1384 (5th Cir. 1995) \n(citing Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S., 248, 254 (1936).  This control is not unbounded. \nProper use of this authority calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh competing \ninterests and maintain an even balance.  Wedgeworth v. Fibreboard Corp., 706 F.2d 541, 544-45 \n(5th Cir. 1983) (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 254-55).  The burden of proof is on the party \nseeking the stay.  Wedgeworth, 706 F.2d at 545.  Additionally, stay orders are not to be \nimmoderate or of an indefinite duration. McKnight v. Blanchard, 667 F.2d 477, 479 (5th Cir. \n1982). \n  This Court retains jurisdiction over all matters not involved in the appeal.  Rauscher \nPierce Refsnes, Inc. v. Birenbaum, 800 F.2d 169, 170 (5th Cir. 1988) \n \n11 The Supreme Court did say “We also disagree with the respondent’s remaining contentions in support of the \ninjunctions entered below.”  2022 WL 120950, at 9.  However, none of the listed arguments dealt with the \nconstitutional claims listed in number Five. \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 46   Filed 01/18/22   Page 6 of 6 PageID #:  763\nIII.   CONCLUSION AND ORDER \n  As discussed herein, without knowing when the Government Defendants intend to re-\nimpose the CMS Mandate vaccine requirements, without knowing whether a Motion for \nRehearing will be asked for by the Plaintiff States, and without knowing whether the Fifth \nCircuit will address the remaining issues or remand to this Court for a merits hearing, the \nGovernment Defendants Motion to Stay Further Proceedings will be DENIED. \n  In the event any part of the remaining issues are remanded to this Court, counsel should \nbe prepared for an expedited briefing schedule so that any remaining issues can be decided prior \nto the date required for the first required COVID-19 vaccine.  Accordingly, \n  IT IS ORDERED that Government Defendants’ Motion to Stay Further Proceedings \n[Doc. No. 40] is DENIED. \n  MONROE, LOUISIANA, this 18th day of January 2022. \n \n              ____________________________________ \n              TERRY A.

MCCLUSKY \n \n \n  REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nBefore the undersigned Magistrate Judge, on reference from the District Court, is a \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted [doc. # 64] filed by \nDefendants Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices; the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHH”); Chiquita Brooks–\nLasure, in her official capacity as Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices; and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Service (“CMS”) (collectively, the “U.S. \nGovernment”).  The motion is opposed.  For reasons explained below, it is recommended that \nthe motion be GRANTED. \n  Background1 \nOn November 5, 2021, the U.S. Government published an Interim Final Rule, (“IFR”) \nwhich revised the requirements that Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers and suppliers \nmust meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs.  86 Fed. Reg. 61555-01 \n(“CMS Mandate).  The CMS Mandate required the staff of specific Medicare and Medicaid \nhealthcare providers to be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022, unless exempt for medical or \n \n1 The following case summary generally tracks the procedural history set forth in the District \nCourt’s January 18, 2022 Memorandum Order [doc. # 46]. \n   \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 2 of 14 PageID #:  1027\nreligious reasons.2  Id.  Failure to comply with the CMS Mandate could result in penalties up to \nand including “termination of the Medicare/Medicaid Provider Agreement.”  86 Fed. Reg. at \n61574.   \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the CMS Mandate, plus other vaccine mandates, spawned \nlawsuits contesting the constitutionality and authority of government agencies to implement \nvaccine mandates.  One such suit was filed before this Court against the U.S. Government on \nNovember 15, 2021, by the States of Louisiana, Montana, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, \nIndiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, and West Virginia, together with an \nassociated motion for preliminary injunction.  See doc. #s 1-2.  On November 22, 2022, \nPlaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint [doc. #11] adding the State of Ohio and the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky as additional Plaintiffs, but otherwise adopting, incorporating, and \nreiterating the allegations of the original Complaint.3  On November 30, 2021, the District Court \ngranted the State Governments’ motion for preliminary injunction and issued an effectively \nnationwide injunction that enjoined the U.S. Government from implementing the CMS Mandate.  \nSee Mem. Ruling and Order [doc. #s 28-29], Louisiana v. Becerra, 571 F.Supp.3d 516 (W.D. La. \n2021), vacated and remanded, No. 21-30734, 2022 WL 2116002 (5th Cir. June 13, 2022).   \nThe U.S. Government filed a notice of appeal on December 1, 2021, together with a \nmotion to stay the nationwide preliminary injunction.  On December 15, 2021, the Fifth Circuit \ndenied the U.S. Government’s motion to stay as to the State Governments but granted a stay “as \nto the order’s application to any other jurisdiction.”  See Order [doc. # 39].  Thereafter, the U.S. \nGovernment applied for writs to the Supreme Court for a stay of the injunction in this case and in \n \n2 The IFR also does not apply to those who telework full time. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61571-72.  \n  \n3 Hereinafter Plaintiffs will be referred to collectively as the “State Governments.” \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 3 of 14 PageID #:  1028\na parallel case brought by other States, Missouri v. Biden, 571 F.Supp.3d 1079 (E.D. Mo. 2021), \nvacated and remanded, No. 21-3725, 2022 WL 1093036 (8th Cir. Apr. 11, 2022), cert. denied, \nNo. 21-1463, 2022 WL 4651648 (U.S. Oct. 3, 2022).   \nThe Supreme Court consolidated the two cases, and, on January 7, 2022, held expedited \noral arguments in the matter.  Less than one week later, the Supreme Court issued a written \nruling that granted the U.S. Government’s application to stay this Court’s preliminary injunction \norder pending disposition of the U.S. Government’s appeal before the Fifth Circuit.  Biden v. \nMissouri, ___  U.S. ___; 142 S.Ct. 647 (2022). \nMeanwhile, the District Court, in this case, denied the U.S. Government’s motion to stay \nfurther proceedings pending resolution of the appeal.  (Jan. 18, 2022 Mem. Order [doc. # 46]).  \nIn so doing, the District Court observed that “[m]any of the [State Governments]’ claims have \nclearly been decided by the Supreme Court, but some have not.  Some of the remaining issues \nmay require a merits hearing.”  Id.   \nOn February 2, 2022, the State Governments filed a motion for leave of court to file a \nsecond amended, supplemental, and restated complaint to join the State of Tennessee and the \nCommonwealth of Virginia as additional Plaintiffs and to address the U.S. Government’s \nJanuary 25, 2022 issuance of new guidance applying the CMS Mandate to State Survey Agency \nand Accrediting Organization Surveyors.  [doc. # 51].  On February 9, 2022, the District Court \nissued an order wherein it acknowledged that, because of the pending appeal before the Fifth \nCircuit, it lacked jurisdiction to grant the motion for leave to amend complaint.  (Mem. Ruling \n[doc. # 59]).  Nonetheless, the Court noted that the only issues in the proposed amended \npleading that did not relate to the issues on appeal were the alleged Surveyor Mandate and the \nconstitutional issue of whether the CMS Vaccine Mandate violated the anti-commandeering \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 4 of 14 PageID #:  1029\ndoctrine.  Id.   Accordingly, the District Court issued an indicative ruling explaining that it was \ninclined to grant the motion for leave to file the second amended, supplemental, and restated \ncomplaint only with regard to the issues of the alleged Surveyor Vaccine Mandate and the \nalleged violation of the anti-commandeering doctrine.  Id. \nOn February 14, 2022, a Fifth Circuit motions panel denied a motion by the State \nGovernments to remand this case, so they could file an amended complaint in accordance with \nthe District Court’s indicative ruling.  See Louisiana v. Becerra, No. 21-30734, 2022 WL \n445159 (5th Cir. Feb. 14, 2022).  The motions panel was not favorably disposed towards the \nState Governments’ proposed amendment to challenge the U.S. Government’s January 25, 2022 \nissuance of new guidance and to expound upon a claim pursuant to the anti-commandeering \ndoctrine.4  Id.  As pertinent here, the motions panel observed that neither the Fifth Circuit nor \nthe Supreme Court had made any rulings about the anti-commandeering doctrine.  Id.    \nOn March 17, 2022, the U.S. Government filed the instant motion to dismiss [doc. #64] \nthe First Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in light \nof the Supreme Court’s decision in Biden v. Missouri, which, according to the U.S. Government, \neffectively resolved this matter by either explicitly or implicitly rejecting all of the State \nGovernments’ claims.  The U.S. Government noted that in the wake of the Supreme Court \ndecision, plaintiffs in parallel litigation had voluntarily dismissed their challenges to the CMS \nMandate.  See Texas v. Becerra, Civ. Action No. 21-0229, (N.D. Tex. Jan. 18, 2022); Florida v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs, Civ. Action No. 21-2722 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 4, 2022).  It \n \n4 The panel stated that the State Governments had not identified a claim under the anti-\ncommandeering doctrine in their original Complaint.  Id.  In Count IX, however, the State \nGovernments alleged that the vaccine mandate violated the doctrine.  See Compl. [doc. #1]; \nFirst Amended Complaint [doc. #11 (adopting allegations of Complaint)].   \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 5 of 14 PageID #:  1030\nfurther argued that the CMS Mandate did not violate the anti-commandeering principle because \nthe vaccination rule imposed the same conditions no matter whether the facilities were privately \nrun or run by the States. \nThe State Governments filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss on April 8, 2022, \nwherein they argued that the motion to dismiss should be denied because their claim under the \nanti-commandeering doctrine was not a basis for the preliminary injunction, and, hence, was not \nimplicated by the Supreme Court’s decision staying the injunction.  [doc. # 66].  The State \nGovernments further argued that the First Amended Complaint stated a claim for relief under the \nanti-commandeering doctrine because the pleading alleged that there were “state-run hospitals” \nimpacted by the CMS Mandate.  Id.  Finally, the State Governments added that, once the Fifth \nCircuit returned jurisdiction to this Court, they should be allowed to amend their complaint to \nassert additional claims pertaining to the January 25 Guidance and the February 9 Guidance.  Id. \n On April 29, 2022, the U.S. Government filed a reply brief in support of its motion to \ndismiss whereby it re-urged its argument that the Supreme Court had explicitly or implicitly \ndecided all of the State Governments’ claims and that the anti-commandeering principle was not \nimplicated at all where, as here, “Congress has acted under the Spending Clause, or where \nfederal conditions are imposed on equal terms on state governments and on private parties.”  \n[doc. # 69].  As for the State Governments’ argument regarding their intent to amend to assert \nadditional claims, the U.S. Government observed that the First Amended Complaint was the \noperative pleading in this matter.  Id. \n On June 13, 2022, by agreement of the parties, the Fifth Circuit vacated the District \nCourt’s preliminary injunction and remanded the case for further consideration in light of the \nSupreme Court opinion in Biden v. Missouri, ___  U.S. ___; 142 S.Ct. 647 (2022).  Louisiana \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 6 of 14 PageID #:  1031\nv. Becerra, No. 21-30734, 2022 WL 2116002 (5th Cir. June 13, 2022).  The Fifth Circuit also \nvacated, as moot, the motions panel’s order denying the motion to remand.  Id.  Finally, the \nFifth Circuit declined to express an opinion on whether the district court should grant or deny \nleave to amend the complaint or on the propriety of the State Governments’ other claims.  Id. \nOn June 29, 2022, the District Court held a telephone status conference with the parties to \ndiscuss the status of the case.  See Minutes [doc. # 86].  The State Governments represented \nthat they intended to file a motion to amend the complaint within the next ten (10) days.  To \ndate, more than four months later, however, no motion has been filed. \nOn October 3, 2022, the Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari that had \nbeen filed in the parallel litigation, Missouri v. Biden, No. 21-1463, 2022 WL 4651648 (U.S. \nOct. 3, 2022).5  On November 2, 2022, the U.S. Government filed a motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ complaint in the Missouri v. Biden case.  Civil Action No. 4:21-cv-1329 (E.D. Mo. \n[doc. #67]).     \nThe matter is ripe. \nStandard of Review \nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sanction dismissal where the plaintiff fails “to state \na claim upon which relief can be granted.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  A pleading states a claim \nfor relief when, inter alia, it contains a “short and plain statement . . . showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief . . .”  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  \nTo withstand a motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 \n \n5 The Eastern District of Missouri had stayed its case pending disposition of the petition for writ \nof certiorari filed by the State Plaintiffs.  See May 27, 2022 Order, Missouri v. Biden, Civ. \nAction No. 21-1329 (E.D. Mo.) [doc. # 62]. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 7 of 14 PageID #:  1032\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007)).  A claim is \nfacially plausible when it contains sufficient factual content for the court “to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  Plausibility does not \nequate to possibility or probability; it lies somewhere in between.  See id.  Plausibility simply \ncalls for enough factual allegations to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal \nevidence to support the elements of the claim.  See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556.  Assessing \nwhether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief is a “context-specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.  \n(citation omitted).  A well-pleaded complaint may proceed even if it strikes the court that actual \nproof of the asserted facts is improbable, and that recovery is unlikely.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n556. \nAlthough the court must accept as true all factual allegations set forth in the complaint, \nthe same presumption does not extend to legal conclusions.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  A pleading \ncomprised of “labels and conclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction” does not satisfy Rule 8.  Id.  Moreover, courts are compelled to dismiss claims \ngrounded upon invalid legal theories even though they might otherwise be well-pleaded.  \nNeitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 109 S.Ct. 1827 (1989).  Furthermore, “a complaint may be \ndismissed if it clearly lacks merit—for example, where there is an absence of law to support a \nclaim of the sort made.”  Thurman v. Med. Transp. Mgmt., Inc., 982 F.3d 953, 956 (5th Cir. \n2020) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \nFinally, when considering a motion to dismiss, courts generally are limited to the \ncomplaint and its proper attachments.  Dorsey v. Portfolio Equities, Inc., 540 F.3d 333, 338 (5th \nCir. 2008) (citation omitted).  However, courts may rely upon “documents incorporated into the \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 8 of 14 PageID #:  1033\ncomplaint by reference, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice” – including public \nrecords.  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 \nF.3d 454, 461 n9 (5th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted) (proper to take judicial notice of matters of \npublic record).   \nAnalysis \n  Following a remand from a higher court, the mandate rule requires a district court to \neffect the appellate court’s mandate and to do nothing else.   Gen. Universal Sys., Inc. v. HAL, \nInc., 500 F.3d 444, 453 (5th Cir. 2007) (citations omitted).  The mandate rule is a corollary of \nthe law of the case doctrine, which “compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a \nsuperior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the \nappellate court.”  Id. (emphasis added) (citation omitted).  Furthermore, “[t]he law of the case \ndoctrine applies not only to issues decided explicitly, but also to everything decided ‘by \nnecessary implication.’” In re Felt, 255 F.3d 220, 225 (5th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added) \n(citation omitted).  Even if “not expressly addressed in an initial appeal, those matters that were \nfully briefed to the appellate court and were necessary predicates to the ability to address the \nissue or issues specifically discussed are deemed to have been decided tacitly or implicitly, and \ntheir disposition is law of the case.”   Id.   \n  The law of the case principles extend to an interlocutory appeal of the granting of a \npreliminary injunction.   Royal Ins. Co. of Am. v. Quinn-L Capital Corp., 3 F.3d 877, 880–81 \n(5th Cir. 1993) (On decisions of law, “[a]s in any other interlocutory appeal, our decision \nconstitutes law of the case” with regard to an interlocutory appeal of the granting of a \npreliminary injunction.).   Therefore, conclusions of law made by an appellate court regarding a \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 9 of 14 PageID #:  1034\npreliminary injunction become the law of the case and binding on that court in further \nproceedings.  Gaalla v. Brown, 460 Fed. App’x. 469, 476 (5th Cir. 2012).   \n  When this court’s preliminary injunction reached the Supreme Court within the peculiar \nprocedural context of a motion to stay the injunction, the Supreme Court concluded that “the \nSecretary did not exceed his statutory authority in requiring that, in order to remain eligible for \nMedicare and Medicaid dollars, the facilities covered by the interim rule must ensure that their \nemployees be vaccinated against COVID-19.”   Biden v. Missouri, 142 S. Ct. at 653.  The \nCourt added that it also “disagree[d] with respondents’ remaining contentions in support of the \ninjunctions entered below.”  Id.    \n  On remand, the Fifth Circuit vacated this Court’s preliminary injunction and deferred to \nthis Court to further consider this case in light of the Supreme Court opinion.    \n  In its January 18, 2022 order denying the U.S. Government’s motion to stay, the District \nCourt determined that the State Governments’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction listed five primary claims: (1) the Government \nissued the CMS Mandate without following statutorily required processes (5 U.S.C. \n§  553);  (2)  the  CMS  Mandate  is  beyond  the  authority  of  the  Government \nDefendants; (3) the CMS Mandate is contrary to law; (4) the CMS Mandate is \narbitrary and capricious (5 U.S.C. § 706); and (5) Constitutional issues – that the \nCMS Mandate violates the Spending Clause, Tenth Amendment, Police Power and \nNon-Delegation Doctrine, and Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. \n \nThis Court initially found the Plaintiff States were likely to succeed on the merits \non One, Two, Three, Four and parts of Five (Tenth Amendment Police Power and \nNon-Delegation  Doctrine).  This  Court  was  unable  to  determine  whether  the \nPlaintiff States were likely to succeed on the merits of the Anti-Commandeering \nDoctrine and the Spending Clause since it was unclear from the evidence the extent \nand nature of state involvement . . .   \n \nThe Supreme Court clearly addressed the above numbered issues in One, Two, \nThree and Four, but did not address any of the constitutional issues in number Five \n. . . Therefore, it appears to this Court that issues remain regarding violations of the \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 10 of 14 PageID #:  1035\nTenth Amendment (Police Power and Non-Delegation Doctrine claims), violation \nof the Spending Clause, and the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine. \n \n(Jan. 18, 2022 Mem. Order [doc. # 46]). \n  As the District Court observed, the Supreme Court explicitly addressed all of the bases \nargued in support of the motion for preliminary injunction except for the constitutional claims. \nId.  However, in its order granting the preliminary injunction, the District Court also determined \nthat the State Governments were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims under the Tenth \nAmendment Police Power and Non-Delegation Doctrine.  See Jan. 18, 2022 Order [doc. #46].  \nFurthermore, the State Governments argued in their brief to the Supreme Court that the rule \nviolated the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, the non-delegation doctrine, and \nconstitutionally intruded on the States’ police powers.  See Response to Application for a Stay \nPending Appeal, Becerra v. Louisiana, Nos. 21A240, 21A241 (U.S. Dec. 30, 2021).  Therefore, \nthe constitutional issues were also part of the record and presented to the Supreme Court for its \nconsideration.  With that record before it, the Supreme Court nonetheless concluded that the \nrule was “a straightforward and predictable example of the ‘health and safety’ regulations that \nCongress has authorized the Secretary to impose,” Biden v. Missouri, 142 S. Ct. at 653, and that \n“the Secretary’s rule falls within the authorities that Congress has conferred upon him.”  Id. at \n652.  Therefore, the undersigned concludes that the Supreme Court also implicitly or tacitly \nrejected the constitutional claims as well. \n  In short, with the likely exception of the anti-commandeering claim, the Supreme Court \neither explicitly or tacitly rejected all of the State Governments’ claims.   Thus, these issues \nhave been resolved by a higher court and represent the law of the case, which is binding on this \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 11 of 14 PageID #:  1036\nlower court.6  As the State Governments appear to concede, See Pl. Opp. Brief, pp. 4-5 [doc. # \n66], this determination is buttressed by the District Court’s indicative ruling on the State \nGovernments’ motion to amend.  See Feb. 9, 2022 Mem. Ruling [doc. #46].   In that ruling, \nJudge Doughty specifically stated that “[t]he only issues that do not relate to issues on appeal are \nthe alleged Surveyor Vaccine Mandate and the constitutional issue of whether the CMS Vaccine \nMandate violated the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine” and then indicated that, if he had authority \nto do so, he would grant the motion to amend, but “only with regard” to these two remaining \nissues.  Id.   \n  Finally, although the anti-commandeering claim was not addressed, the undersigned finds \nthat it, too, should be dismissed because the State Governments fail to state a viable claim for \nrelief.   In their First Amended Complaint, the State Governments allege that the CMS Mandate \ncontravened the anti-commandeering doctrine by requiring their state-run hospitals to either fire \ntheir unvaccinated employees or to forgo all Medicaid (and, where applicable, Medicare) \nfunding.  (Compl., ¶¶ 193-194).  The CMS Mandate also commandeers the States because it \nforces State surveyors to enforce the CMS Mandate by verifying healthcare provider compliance, \nwhich “dragoons” the States into enforcing federal policy.  Id. \n  “The anti-commandeering doctrine recognizes the fundamental structural principal that \n \n6 The State Governments emphasize in their opposition that “The Supreme Court effectively \nresolved the appeal of the preliminary injunction, but not this case itself,” and, thus, contend that \ndismissal is “inappropriate.”  [doc. #66, p. 1].  That opposition, however, ignores the \napplicability of the law of the case doctrine to preliminary injunction findings of law.  To grant \na preliminary injunction, the District Court was required to find that there was a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits on the claims indicated.  Conversely, in granting a stay of the \npreliminary injunction, the Supreme Court disagreed with that finding. The Fifth Circuit then \nvacated the stay.  Those conclusions of law follow the case, and there has been no amendment \nto assert new factual allegations that would affect the analysis.     \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 12 of 14 PageID #:  1037\nthe Constitution . . . withhold[s] from Congress the power to issue orders directly to the States.” \nBrackeen v. Haaland, 994 F.3d 249, 401–02 (5th Cir. 2021), cert. granted sub nom. Nation v. \nBrackeen, ___ U.S. ___; 142 S.Ct. 1204 (2022), and cert. granted, ___ U.S. ___; 142 S.Ct. 1205 \n(2022), and cert. granted sub nom. Texas v. Haaland, ___ U.S. ___; 142 S.Ct. 1205 (2022), and \ncert. granted, ___ U.S. ___; 142 S.Ct. 1205 (2022).  While Congress may attach conditions on \nthe receipt of federal funds or even offer states the option of regulating private activity according \nto federal standards, it may not issue a “a simple command to state governments to implement \nlegislation enacted by Congress . . . or compel the States to enact or administer a federal \nregulatory program.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).    \n  However, the anti-commandeering principle “does not apply when Congress \nevenhandedly regulates an activity in which both States and private actors engage.”  Brakeen, \n994 F.3d at 410.  Here, the District Court recognized previously that many of the healthcare \nfacilities required to track and regulate the CMS Mandate are privately owned and managed.  \nSee Nov. 30, 2022 Order [doc. # 28].  Consequently, the CMS Mandate evenhandedly regulates \nthe activity as to both public and private actors,7 which does not transgress the anti-\ncommandeering principle. \n  The State Governments also allege that the CMS Mandate forces state surveyors to verify \nhealthcare provider compliance, which will cause them to suffer increased enforcement costs.  \nCompl., ¶¶ 87-92.  According to the First Amended Complaint, however, state surveyors \nalready regularly evaluate healthcare facilities’ compliance with federal and state regulations to \nensure compliance with Medicare and Medicaid requirements.  Id.  The State Governments’ \n \n7 At least some of the State Governments run healthcare facilities.  See Compl.,¶¶ 85-86. \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 91   Filed 11/03/22   Page 13 of 14 PageID #:  1038\nallegation that they will suffer increased enforcement costs is conclusory and entitled to no \nweight.  Therefore, the CMS Mandate does not force the state surveyors to do anything that \nthey are not already doing, apart from possibly enforcing an additional regulation that is \nobjectionable to the State Governments.  The State Governments have not shown that these \ncircumstances suffice to state a plausible claim for relief for violation of the anti-commandeering \nprinciple. \n  Finally, the undersigned observes that, despite their assurances they would do so, the \nState Governments have failed to seek leave to amend for more than four months.  At this point, \nthe unexplained delay has become undue, and any amendment is simply too late.      \n  Conclusion \nFor the above-assigned reasons,  \nIT IS RECOMMENDED that the U.S. Government’s motion to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted [doc. # 64] be GRANTED and that Plaintiffs’ First \nAmended Complaint be DISMISSED, with prejudice, in its entirety.

DOUGHTY \n \nXAVIER BECERRA ET AL  MAG. JUDGE KAYLA D. MCCLUSKY \n \nMEMORANDUM RULING \nPending before the Court is a Motion for Leave to File Second Amended, Supplemental, \nand Restated Complaint (“Motion for Leave”) [Doc. No. 51] filed by Plaintiff States1 on \nFebruary 4, 2022. The Motion for Leave is opposed. This Court ordered Government \nDefendants2 to file a response by Monday, February 7, 2022. Government Defendants timely \nfiled an Opposition [Doc. No. 55]. Plaintiff States filed a Reply [Doc. No. 58]. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThe issues in the previous Complaint [Doc. No. 1] were ultimately resolved by the \nSupreme Court of the United States on January 13, 2022. Biden v. Missouri, 142 S. Ct. 647 \n(2022). In its ruling, the Supreme Court found: \n1.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services had the authority to implement an interim \nfinal rule (86 Fed. Reg. 61561) (“CMS Vaccine Mandate”), which required staff of \ncovered medical providers to become fully vaccinated against COVID-19; \n2.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate was not arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative \nProcedures Act (“APA”). Title 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); \n \n1 Plaintiff States consist of Louisiana, Montana, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, \nSouth Carolina, Utah, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia. \n2 Government Defendants consist of Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHH”), Chiquita Brooks–Lasure, in her official \ncapacity as Administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 59   Filed 02/09/22   Page 2 of 5 PageID #:  914\n3.  The Secretary of Health and Human Resources had good cause to waive the notice and \ncomment requirement as to the CMS Vaccine Mandate under the APA. Title 5 U.S.C. § \n553; \n4.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate was not contrary to law in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1395z, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1395, or 42 U.S.C. § 1302(b)(1); and \n5.  Stated that “we also disagree with respondents’ remaining contentions in support of the \ninjunctions entered below.” 142 U.S. at 653. \nII.  PROPOSED AMENDMENT  \nPlaintiff States seek to amend their previous complaint by adding the State of Tennessee \nand the Commonwealth of Virginia as plaintiffs. Additionally, Plaintiff States’ Second \nAmended, Supplemental, and Restated Complaint [Doc. No. 51-1] asserts that: \n1.  A January 25, 2022 publication, Vaccination Expectations for Surveyors Performing \nFederal Oversight (Jan. 25, 2022)3 (“Surveyor Vaccine Mandate”), sets a new vaccine \nmandate on state employee surveyors who survey and report whether Medicare and \nMedicaid facilities are complying with applicable regulations, including the November 5, \n2021 CMS Vaccine Mandate. Plaintiff States maintain state surveyors were not \npreviously covered by the November 5, 2021 CMS Vaccine Mandate and that \nGovernment Defendants failed to comply with the APA in implementing the Surveyor \nVaccine Mandate. Plaintiff States also maintain this new mandate puts additional burdens \non the States, which violate the State’s police power and preempts State laws; \n2.  The Secretary’s rationale for the CMS Vaccine Mandate and for avoiding notice and \ncomment no longer exists. Plaintiff States maintain that the rationale for the CMS \n \n3 https://www.cms.gov/files.document/qso-22-10-all.pdf  \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 59   Filed 02/09/22   Page 3 of 5 PageID #:  915\nVaccine Mandate was built upon the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus. Plaintiff \nStates argue that the Delta variant has disappeared and has been replaced by the Omicron \nvariant, which is now responsible for 99.99% of all COVID-19 cases in the United States. \nPlaintiff States further maintain that none of the three COVID-19 vaccinations are \neffective in preventing the transmission of the Omicron variant; \n3.  The November 5, 2021 CMS Vaccine Mandate is wreaking havoc in the healthcare labor \nmarket due to staffing shortages caused by the CMS Vaccine Mandate; \n4.  The CMS Vaccine Mandate violates the Tenth Amendment, the Spending Clause, the \nAnti-Commandeering Doctrine, and the Non-Delegation Doctrine of the United States \nConstitution4; and \n5.  The Supreme Court found in their January 13, 2022 ruling that the CMS Vaccine \nMandate was not contrary to law in violation of 42 § U.S.C. 1395z because Government \nDefendants were not required to consult with the appropriate State agencies in advance, \nbut they were permitted to during the deferred notice and comment period. Plaintiff \nStates maintain that the deferred notice and comment period expired on January 4, 2022, \nwithout Government Defendants consulting with appropriate State agencies, so the CMS \nMandate is now “contrary to law.” \nIII.  JURISDICTION \nAs stated, the Supreme Court ruled on this matter on January 13, 2022. Biden, 142 S. Ct. \n647, 595 U.S. As part of their ruling, the Supreme Court remanded this proceeding to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where it remains pending.  \n \n4 This Court previously held that Plaintiff States were likely to succeed on the merits that the vaccine mandate \nviolates the Tenth Amendment and the Non-Delegation Doctrine.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 59   Filed 02/09/22   Page 4 of 5 PageID #:  916\nGovernment Defendants maintain this Court lacks jurisdiction because the case is \ncurrently on appeal. As stated by the Supreme Court in Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., \n459 U.S. 56, 103 S. Ct. 400, 74 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1982): \nIt is generally understood that a federal district court and a federal \ncourt of appeals shall not attempt to assert jurisdiction over a case \nsimultaneously. The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of \njudicial significance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals \nand diverts the district court of its control over those aspects of the \ncase involved in the appeal.  \n \n459 U.S. at 58.  \n \n  There are a few exceptions to this rule; however, granting leave to amend a complaint5 \nand granting an injunction6 are not among those exceptions. Additionally, a district court may \nnot take any action that would “alter the status of the case as it rests before the Court of \nAppeals.” 7 In this Court’s opinion, granting the Plaintiff States’ Motion for Leave [Doc. No. 51] \ncould alter the status of the case before the Fifth Circuit. \n  FED. R. CIV. P. 62.1 only grants three options to a district court when a timely motion is \nmade for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of a pending appeal: \n1)  Defer considering the motion; \n2)  Deny the motion; or \n3)  State either that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose \nor that the motion raises a substantial issue. \nThe divestiture of jurisdiction covers only the matters involved in the appeal8 but almost \nall of the issues in the proposed Second Amended, Supplemental, and Restated Complaint [Doc. \n \n5 Dayton Indep. School Dist. V. U.S. Minerals Prods., 906 F.2d 1059 (5th Cir. 1990) \n6 American Town Center v. Hall, 912 F.2d 104 (6th Cir. 1990) \n7 Dayton Independent School Dist., 906 F.2d at 1063. \n8 Marrese v. Am. Acad. of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 105 S. Ct. 1327, 84 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1985) \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 59   Filed 02/09/22   Page 5 of 5 PageID #:  917\nNo. 51-1] relate to issues on appeal. The only issues that do not relate to the issues on appeal are \nthe alleged Surveyor Mandate and the constitutional issue of whether the CMS Vaccine Mandate \nviolated the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine.9 \nIV.  INDICATIVE RULING \nThis Court finds it does not have jurisdiction to grant Plaintiff States’ Motion for Leave \nas the matter is currently on appeal, pending with the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit. The alleged Surveyor Vaccine Mandate is likely not being considered by the Fifth \nCircuit, but the alleged violation of the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine may be. To allow an \namendment to both of these issues could affect the pending appeal. In order to avoid this, the \nCourt is entering an indicative ruling in accordance with FED. R. CIV. P. 62.1(3). \nTherefore, this Court enters an indicative ruling that in the event the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sees fit to remand the matter to this Court for disposition, it \nwould GRANT the Plaintiff States’ Motion for Leave to File Second Amended, Supplemental, \nand Restated Complaint [Doc. No. 51] only with regard to the issues of the alleged Surveyor \nVaccine Mandate, and the alleged violation of the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine.  \nMONROE, LOUISIANA, this 9th day of February 2022. \n   \n \n \n \n  Terry A. Doughty \nUnited States District Judge \n \n \n \n \n9 The Anti-Commandeering Doctrine issue was not addressed in briefs to the Supreme Court. \n5 \n ",

Reg. 61,555, 61,556 (Nov. 5, 2021). By the time the rule at issue here was published three weeks \nago, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had infected over 44 million people, hospitalized \nmore than 3 million people, and had claimed more than 720,000 lives in the United States. Those \nnumbers continue to grow. See Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”), COVID Data Tracker Weekly \nReview,  https://perma.cc/CU4F-GD9Q  (updated  Nov.  19,  2021).  Because  the  virus  is  highly \ntransmissible, it can easily pass from person to person at health care facilities. As a result, the pandemic \nhas been devastating for health care facilities and for patients alike. Fortunately, the vaccines now \napproved or authorized for emergency use to protect against COVID-19 are safe and highly effective.  \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services reviewed this evidence and concluded that action \nwas urgently needed to protect patients from infection with the virus while they receive care in facilities \nfunded by Medicare and Medicaid. Congress has assigned the Secretary a statutory responsibility to \nensure that the health and safety of patients are protected in these federally-funded facilities. To do \nso, he issued a rule requiring certain health care facilities, as a condition of their participation in these \nprograms, to ensure that those members of their health care staffs who interact with patients, or who \nhave contact with other staff who do so, receive vaccination for COVID-19, absent an exemption. \nThese staff members are required to be vaccinated (or to obtain the first shot of a two-dose regimen) \nby December 6, or to request an exemption from this requirement from their employer. Non-exempt \nemployees who follow a two-shot regimen must complete their second shot by January 4, 2022. The \nSecretary issued his rule on an emergency basis, and waived a comment period in advance of \npublication, because he foresaw an imminent need to protect patients against a spike in COVID-19 \ncases in the winter months. Although precise calculations are of course not possible, he found that his \nrule is likely to save hundreds, and possibly thousands, of lives each month, once it is implemented. \nPlaintiffs are fourteen States that seek to prevent the Secretary from enforcing this rule. But \nthis Court lacks jurisdiction over their claims. Congress has channeled jurisdiction over such claims \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 11 of 40 PageID #:  528\ninto an exclusive system for judicial review, under which a party must first present a particular claim \nfor Medicare benefits, or dispute a particular sanction, to the agency for its resolution before that party \nmay proceed to federal court. Plaintiffs have not met this prerequisite for this Court’s jurisdiction.  \n Plaintiffs also fail to show they are entitled to emergency relief. They are unlikely to succeed \non the merits. The Secretary has the statutory authority and responsibility to ensure that federal funds \nare used to protect, rather than harm, the health and safety of patients receiving care at facilities that \nvoluntarily participate in Medicare and Medicaid. He reasonably exercised that authority to arrive at \nthis rule. He explained his determination that the rule’s potential to save several hundred to several \nthousand lives per month compelled him to act now. In so doing, he accounted for the rule’s potential \ncosts, including that some health care workers might seek other jobs rather than accept vaccination; \nhe concluded, however, based on real-world experience with vaccination requirements, that relatively \nfew would do so. Given that about a quarter of a health care facility’s staff on average are new hires \nin any given year, he concluded that the effects of workers leaving for other jobs to avoid vaccination, \nand  the  countervailing  effects  of  other  employees newly  seeking  jobs  in  facilities  that  require \nvaccination, would be dwarfed by the effects of this regular churn in the health care workforce. The \nSecretary accordingly acted, on an emergency basis, to protect lives in the coming weeks and months.  \nNor can Plaintiffs meet the remaining preliminary injunction factors. The only harm Plaintiffs \nmight have standing to assert—an alleged economic loss—is entirely speculative, as another court \nrecently concluded in a nearly identical suit. Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., ---F. Supp. 3d---\n, 2021 WL 5416122 (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021). The equities and public interest weigh heavily against \nan injunction, which would undermine the public’s significant interest in protecting the health of \nMedicare and Medicaid patients.   \nFor all of these reasons, the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction should be denied. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects on Medicare and Medicaid \npatients, and on health care workers. \n  The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes a severe acute respiratory disease known as \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 12 of 40 PageID #:  529\nCOVID-19. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,556-57. As of mid-October 2021, over 44 million COVID-19 cases, 3 \nmillion COVID-19 related hospitalizations, and 720,000 COVID-19 deaths had been reported in the \nUnited States, id.1, including over 500,000 cases and 1,900 deaths among health care staff. Id. at 61,559.  \nBecause the virus that causes COVID-19 is highly transmissible, it can readily spread among \nunvaccinated health care workers, and from these workers to patients, in health care facilities, even \nwhen infection control practices are followed. Id. at 61,557 n.16; 61,585 n.210. Unvaccinated health \ncare workers are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore risk exposing colleagues \nand patients to the virus. Id. at 61,558 n.42. Due to many of the factors that qualify them for enrollment \n(e.g., age, disability, and/or poverty), Medicare and Medicaid patients are more likely to face high risk \nof developing severe disease and of experiencing severe outcomes from COVID-19 if infected by \nSARS-CoV-2. Id. at 61,566, 61,609. “[T]he available evidence for ongoing healthcare-associated \nCOVID-19 transmission risk is sufficiently alarming in and of itself to compel CMS to take action.” \nId. at 61,558.  \nUnvaccinated staff also jeopardize patients’ access to needed medical care and services. Id. Out \nof a fear of exposure to the virus, patients are refusing care from unvaccinated staff, thereby limiting \nthe ability of providers to meet the health care needs of their patients. Id. Patients also are forgoing \nmedically necessary care altogether to avoid contracting SARS-Cov-2 infections from health care \nworkers. Id. Absenteeism from health care staff as a result of infection with the virus has also created \nstaffing shortages that have disrupted patient access to recommended care. Id. at 61,559.    \nIn June and July 2021, an especially contagious strain of SARS-CoV-2 known as the Delta \nvariant drove dramatic increases in COVID-19 case and hospitalization rates in the United States. Id.. \nFrom June to September 2021, daily cases increased over 1200 percent, hospital admissions over 600 \npercent, and deaths over 800 percent. Id. at 61,583. Cases among health care workers have “grown in \n                                                 \n1 These figures likely underestimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, id. at 61,557 n.4, and \nfail to capture the widespread and devastating effects of post-acute illness from the virus, including \nlong-term nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and reduced quality \nof life. Id. at 61,557 n.5. \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 13 of 40 PageID #:  530\ntandem with broader national incidence trends since the Delta variant’s emergence.” Id. at 61,585. The \nvast majority of cases during this period were among the unvaccinated population. Id.   \nIn September and October 2021, reported cases began to trend downward, albeit still at highly \nelevated levels,2 but at the time the Secretary issued his rule, there were troubling indications that a \nresurgence in the virus was coming in the next several weeks. Id. at 61,584. Respiratory viruses, like \nSARS-Cov-2,  typically  circulate  more  frequently  during  colder  months,  and  the  United  States \nexperienced a large spike in COVID-19 cases during the winter of 2020. Id. The 2021-2022 winter \ninfluenza season may be abnormally severe, given lower immunity levels to influenza. Id. The \ninteraction between the COVID-19 virus and the influenza virus may lead to particularly severe \noutbreaks over the next several months. Id. at 61,584. “Accordingly, it is imperative that the risk for \nhealthcare-associated COVID-19 transmission be minimized during the influenza season.” Id.     \nII.  Safe and effective vaccines are available to protect patients of health care facilities. \n  Currently, three manufacturers offer vaccines approved or authorized for emergency use in \nthe United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Id. at 61,563. FDA reviewed safety \nand efficacy data, and issued emergency use authorizations in December 2020 for the Pfizer-\nBioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and in February 2021 for the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine. \nId. at 61,562, 61,564. On August 23, 2021, based on further safety and efficacy data, FDA fully \napproved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Id. at 61,564. \nThese vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious outcomes of COVID-19, including \nsevere disease, hospitalization, and death. Id. at 61,565 n.115. The evidence indicates that these \nvaccines continue to offer strong protection against the Delta variant. Id. at 61,565 n.116. The evidence \nalso indicates that these vaccines offer better protection than infection-induced immunity alone does. \nId. at 61,559-60; see also id. at 61,585 n.205. Recent studies indicate that vaccination of health care \nworkers is 80 percent effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline workers—more \n                                                 \n2 Those trends have reversed since the rule issued; since a nadir near the end of October, the moving \n7 day case average has increased by nearly 50%, with a 16% increase over the last full week for which \nCDC  reports  data.  See  Centers  for  Disease  Control,  COVID  Data  Tracker  Weekly  Review, \nhttps://perma.cc/87MA-GNNV (updated Nov. 19, 2021). \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 14 of 40 PageID #:  531\neffective in practice than are existing protocols, such as protocols for regular testing. Id. at 61,585 \nn.210. Like all vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines are not 100 percent effective at preventing infection. \nHowever, the risk of developing COVID-19, including severe illness, remains much higher for \nunvaccinated than vaccinated people, and therefore could lead to higher absenteeism rates for \nunvaccinated staff in healthcare settings. Id. at 61,559, 61,565 n.120. Studies have also shown that \nvaccinated people with breakthrough infections may be less infectious than unvaccinated individuals \nwith primary infections, resulting in fewer opportunities for transmission. Id. at 61,558 n.37.  \nIII.  The Social Security Act grants the Secretary the authority to protect the health and \nsafety of patients in facilities funded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \nCongress established the Medicare program “[a]s a means of providing health care to the aged \nand disabled.” Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 404 (1993); see 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq. \nCongress also created the Medicaid program to “furnish medical assistance” (i.e., health care) on behalf \nof individuals “whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical \nservices[.]” Id. § 1396-1. Under both programs, health care services are provided by private health care \norganizations and professionals who meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for participation. \nTo participate in Medicare, providers such as hospitals, home-health agencies, hospices, and \nskilled nursing facilities voluntarily enter into a provider agreement with the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services (CMS) after demonstrating that they meet the conditions for participation. Id. \n§ 1395cc. Medicaid providers, likewise, voluntarily enter into provider agreements with State Medicaid \nagencies to be eligible for participation in that program. Id. § 1396a(a)(27). By entering into the \nprovider agreement, a facility agrees that it will comply with the Medicare and Medicaid statutes and \nwith the Secretary’s regulations under these statutes. See id. §§ 1395cc(b)(2); 1396a(p)(1).  \nThe Secretary has authority under the Social Security Act and the Medicare statute to issue \nsuch regulations “as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which” he \nis charged under each statute. 42 U.S.C. § 1302(a); see also id. § 1395hh(a)(1). He is charged with issuing \nregulations as he deems necessary to, inter alia, ensure that the health and safety of patients are \nprotected while these individuals receive care that is funded by either program. See, e.g., id. § 1395x(e)(9) \n5 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 15 of 40 PageID #:  532\n((a “hospital” must “meet[] such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary in the interest of \nthe health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution”); id. § 1395i-3(d)(4)(B) \n(same  with  respect  to  skilled  nursing  facilities).  These  regulations  are  alternatively  known  as \n“conditions of participation,” “conditions for coverage,” or “requirements for participation.” The \nSecretary’s long-standing conditions of participation include detailed requirements governing, among \nother things, the qualifications of professional staff, the condition of facilities, and other requirements \nthat he deems necessary to protect patient health and safety.  In particular, the regulations require that \nfacilities maintain effective “infection prevention and control programs,” and “provide a safe, sanitary, \nand  comfortable  environment  and  to  help  prevent  the  development  and  transmission  of \ncommunicable diseases and infections.” 42 C.F.R. § 483.80; see also, e.g., id. §§ 482.42(a); 416.51(b).  \nThe Secretary may enter into agreements with States under which a state health agency agrees \nto  conduct  periodic  surveys  to  determine  whether  providers  meet  Medicare’s  conditions  of \nparticipation. 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a); see also 42 C.F.R. § 488.10(a). A State’s decision to enter into a \nstate survey agreement is voluntary, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a), but by entering into such agreement, a \nState obliges itself to conduct surveys to “assess compliance with Federal health, safety and quality \nstandards,” 42 C.F.R. § 488.26(c)(1), using “the survey methods, procedures, and forms that are \nprescribed by CMS,” id. § 488.26(d). State survey agencies review facilities for compliance and present \nfindings to CMS, see id. § 488.12, but CMS has sole authority to determine noncompliance and impose \nremedies on Medicare providers, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(h)(2). If a provider fails to comply with \nconditions of participation, CMS may, upon notice, terminate the provider’s participation in the \nMedicare program, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(b)(2); 42 C.F.R. § 489.53, or in some circumstances, impose \nmonetary penalties, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395bbb(e),(f); 42 C.F.R. § 488.820. \nA  facility  may  appeal  an  “initial  determination”  by  CMS,  including  a  “finding  of \nnoncompliance leading to the imposition of enforcement actions,” 42 C.F.R. § 498.3(b)(13), and is \nentitled to a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge (“ALJ”). Id. §§ 498.40-498.79. A facility \nmay appeal an ALJ’s determination to the Departmental Appeals Board. Id. § 498.80. The Board’s \ndecision is the final decision of the Secretary, id. § 498.90. The Medicare statute allows a provider to \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 16 of 40 PageID #:  533\nseek judicial review of the “final decision” of the Secretary. See 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h)(1)(A) (cross-\nreferencing 42 U.S.C. § 405(g)). This avenue of judicial review is exclusive. 42 U.S.C. § 405(h) \n(incorporated into the Medicare statute by 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii); see also Shalala v. Ill. Council on Long Term \nCare, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 8 (2000).  \nIV.  The Secretary issued the vaccination rule to protect the health and safety of patients \nat facilities funded by the Medicare and Medicaid programs.    \nOn November 5, 2021, CMS published the interim final rule at issue here, which requires \nvarious categories of Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers to develop and implement plans \nand policies to “ensure staff are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, unless exempt, because vaccination \nof staff is necessary for the health and safety of individuals to whom care and services are furnished.” \n86 Fed. Reg.at 61,561.3 The Secretary concluded that “it would endanger the health and safety of \npatients, and be contrary to the public interest to delay” issuance of a vaccine requirement for staff in \nhealthcare settings, id. at 61,586, and that, accordingly, there was good cause to waive notice and \ncomment procedures, id. at 61,583-86. Under the rule, all relevant staff must receive the first dose of \na two-dose COVID-19 vaccine or a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, or request or have been granted \nan exemption under the health care facility’s exemption policies, by December 6, 2021. Id. at 61,573. \nBy January 4, 2022, all non-exempt staff who are covered by the rule must be fully vaccinated. Id.  \nV.  This litigation is brought. \nPlaintiffs challenge the rule, asserting claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the \nSocial Security Act, the Congressional Review Act, and the Constitution. Compl. ¶¶ 116-197. On \nNovember 15, 2021, they filed their Complaint, see Compl., and moved for a preliminary injunction. See \nPls.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 2-1 (“Br.”). \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy” that should “never be \nawarded as of right.” Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 (2008) (citation omitted). A plaintiff is \n                                                 \n3 Facilities must develop policies to permit their staff to request exemptions from the vaccination \nrequirement “because of an ADA disability, medical condition, or sincerely held religious belief, \npractice, or observance.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,572. \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 17 of 40 PageID #:  534\nentitled to such an “extraordinary remedy” only “upon a clear showing” that it is “entitled to such \nrelief.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). A plaintiff must show (1) “a substantial \nthreat of irreparable injury,” (2) “a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,” (3) “that the \nthreatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the injunction is \ngranted,” and (4) “that the grant of an injunction will not disserve the public interest.” Jordan v. Fisher, \n823 F.3d 805, 809 (5th Cir. 2016). A preliminary injunction should not be “granted unless the party \nseeking it has clearly carried the burden of persuasion on all four requirements.” Id. (citation omitted); \nsee also, e.g., Lake Charles Diesel, Inc., v. Gen. Motors Corp., 328 F.3d 192, 203 (5th Cir. 2003). \nARGUMENT \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THEIR CLAIMS BECAUSE \nTHE MEDICARE STATUTE’S CHANNELING PROVISION DEPRIVES THIS \nCOURT OF JURISDICTION OVER THEIR CLAIMS. \nPlaintiffs dispute the validity of the vaccination rule, and argue that health care facilities in \ntheir States should not be subject to any sanction under Medicare for violating the rule. This Court \nlacks jurisdiction over these claims. Claims arising under the Medicare statute must be channeled \nthrough that statute’s exclusive administrative review scheme, which bars pre-enforcement challenges.   \nThe Medicare statute “channels most, if not all, Medicare claims through [a] special review \nsystem.” Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 8; see also Sw. Pharmacy Sols., Inc. v. CMS, 718 F.3d 436, 440 (5th Cir. \n2013). Under 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h)(1), for example, a provider that disputes CMS’s decision to impose \na sanction, such as terminating its Medicare agreement, is entitled to a hearing before the agency and \njudicial review of the agency’s decision, under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). Congress made this avenue of judicial \nreview exclusive, see id. § 405(h) (applicable to the Medicare statute by id. § 1395ii), foreclosing any \nalternative bases for jurisdiction, such as 28 U.S.C. § 1331, over any claim “arising under” the Medicare \nstatute. See Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 10; Smith v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1765, 1772 (2019).4 \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs also invoke the Declaratory Judgment and Mandamus Acts, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 1361. \nBut § 2201 is not an independent source of jurisdiction. Randall D. Wolcott, M.D., P.A. v. Sebelius, 635 \nF.3d 757, 767 (5th Cir. 2011). And mandamus is only available to order “a precise, definite act about \nwhich an official ha[s] no discretion whatever,” Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 63 (2004) \n(cleaned up), not “to prohibit the defendants from acting in a certain manner in the future.” Family \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 18 of 40 PageID #:  535\nIn Illinois Council, the Supreme Court concluded that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over \nconstitutional, statutory, and APA claims brought by an association of nursing home operators, which \nhad sought pre-enforcement review of the validity of a Medicare regulation governing termination \nprocedures for nursing homes found to be in violation of their conditions of participation. The Court \nheld that claims involving the Medicare program may not be brought in federal court before a party \nfirst presents its claim to the agency; “the bar of § 405(h) reaches beyond ordinary administrative law \nprinciples of ‘ripeness’ and ‘exhaustion of administrative remedies,’” which are subject to established \nexceptions, and instead “demands the ‘channeling’ of virtually all legal attacks through the agency.” \nIllinois Council, 529 U.S. at 12–13. The Supreme Court recognized that this stringent rule “comes at a \nprice, namely, occasional individual, delay-related hardship.” Id. at 13. But, the Court explained, \nIn the context of a massive, complex health and safety program such as Medicare, \nembodied in hundreds of pages of statutes and thousands of pages of often interrelated \nregulations, any of which may become the subject of a legal challenge in any of several \ndifferent courts, paying this price may seem justified. \nId. At least, “such was the judgment of Congress.” Id.; see also Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 627 (1984). \nIllinois Council emphasized the channeling requirement’s broad reach. The Court explained that \nits decisions “foreclose distinctions based upon the ‘potential future’ versus the ‘actual present’ nature \nof the claim, the ‘general legal’ versus the ‘fact-specific’ nature of the challenge, the ‘collateral’ versus \n‘non-collateral’ nature of the issues, or the ‘declaratory’ versus ‘injunctive’ nature of the relief sought.” \nIllinois Council, 529 U.S. at 13–14. It also explained that the channeling requirement is not limited to \nparticular types of relief. “Claims for money, claims for other benefits, claims of program eligibility, and \nclaims that contest a sanction or remedy,” the Court noted, “may all similarly rest upon individual fact-related \ncircumstances, may all similarly dispute agency policy determinations, or may all similarly involve the \napplication, interpretation, or constitutionality of interrelated regulations or statutory provisions.” Id. \nat 14 (emphasis added). The Court found “no reason to distinguish among them in terms of the \nlanguage or in terms of the purposes of § 405(h).” Id.; see also Physician Hosps. of Am. v. Sebelius, 691 F.3d \n                                                 \nRehab., Inc. v. Azar, 886 F.3d 496, 505-06 (5th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted). Plaintiffs seek to invalidate \na regulation, not to compel the performance of a ministerial duty. \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 19 of 40 PageID #:  536\n649, 656 (5th Cir. 2012). Claims are subject to § 405(h), exclusively, if they arise under the Medicare \nstatute, even if they also arise under the Constitution or another statute such as the APA. A claim \n“arises under” the Medicare statute if “both the standing and the substantive basis for” the claim is \nthe statute, or if it is “inextricably intertwined with a claim for benefits.” Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614-15; see \nalso Physician Hosps. 691 F.3d at 656. The inquiry looks to the claim’s “essence,” and “not whether it \nlends itself to a ‘substantive’ rather than a ‘procedural’ label.” Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614-15, 624.   \nAll of Plaintiffs’ claims plainly “arise under” the Medicare statute. Plaintiffs, acting purportedly \non behalf of state-run health care facilities and as parens patriae for privately-run facilities, challenge the \nSecretary’s authority under the Medicare statute to issue the vaccination rule. They seek to preclude \nhim from imposing the Medicare statute’s remedies of civil monetary penalties, payment withholding, \nor termination on facilities that violate the rule. The basis for these claims arises under the Medicare \nstatute, and they are inextricably intertwined with facilities’ claims that they should continue to receive \nthe benefit of eligibility to participate in the Medicare program, without sanction, even if they do not \ncomply with the vaccination rule. See Blue Valley Hosp. v. Azar, 919 F.3d 1278, 1283 (10th Cir. 2019).5  \nThe Supreme Court has recognized a narrow exception to § 405(h)’s jurisdictional bar, when \napplying the bar “would not simply channel review through the agency, but would mean no review at \nall.” Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 19.6 But Plaintiffs may not invoke this exception simply by alleging that \nfinancial hardship forecloses further review. See id. at 22; see also Sw. Pharmacy Sols., 718 F.3d at 441. \n“[T]he ‘channeling’ of virtually all legal attacks through the agency . . . comes at a price, namely, \noccasionally individual, delay-related hardship,” but Congress deemed that price “justified.” Illinois \nCouncil, 529 U.S. at 13. The question instead is “whether, as applied generally . . . hardship likely found \nin many cases turns what appears to be simply a channeling requirement into complete preclusion of \n                                                 \n5 Conditions of participation are common Medicare and Medicaid regulations, enforced through a \nscheme that determines eligibility and penalties under both programs. Review of these determinations \nis “through the Medicare administrative appeals procedure”; thus, § 405(h) applies fully to challenges \nto these regulations. Cathedral Rock of N. Coll. Hill, Inc. v. Shalala, 223 F.3d 354, 366 (6th Cir. 2000); see \nalso In re Bayou Shores SNF, LLC, 828 F.3d 1297, 1330 (11th Cir. 2016); 42 U.S.C. § 1396i(b)(2). \n6 A second narrow exception applies where a plaintiff has presented its claim to the agency, but it is \ninapplicable here. See Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 15; Affiliated Prof’l Home Health Care Agency v. Shalala, \n164 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir. 1999). \n10 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 20 of 40 PageID #:  537\njudicial review.” Id. at 22-23 (emphasis added); see also Physician Hosps., 691 F.3d at 659.   \nThere is no “complete preclusion” of judicial review of the vaccination rule. A provider that \nis subject to an enforcement action could exhaust its remedies before the agency and then proceed to \nfederal court. 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(h). Such a facility, once it receives notice of a potential sanction and \nfiles an appeal before an ALJ, “shall have expedited access to judicial review” that will permit the \nfacility to proceed directly to federal court to challenge the legality of the rule. Id. § 1395cc(h)(1)(B). \nThe Medicare statute thus sets forth an orderly procedure for parties to contest the legality of sanctions \nthat the Secretary imposes on them. See Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 19.   \nIt is true, of course, that State governments are not “dissatisfied” “institution[s] or agenc[ies]” \nunder § 1395cc(h)(1), and thus States themselves could not use that statute’s vehicle for judicial review, \nalthough individual state-operated facilities could if they are cited for a violation. But the same was \ntrue of the plaintiff in Illinois Council, and the Court held that that was immaterial. It is the “rights to \nreview” of health care facilities subject to the rule “that are at stake,” and “the statutes that create the \nspecial review channel adequately protect those rights.” Illinois Council, 529 U.S. at 24; see also Sw. \nPharmacy Sols., 718 F.3d at 444-46; Physician Hosps., 691 F.3d at 659. Facilities aggrieved by the rules’ \nenforcement may seek review of that rule after following the jurisdictional requirements of § 405(h). \nState governments, however, may not skip the jurisdictional requirements to litigate on their behalf.  \nII.  PLAINTIFFS ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS OF THEIR \nCLAIMS. \nA.  CMS has statutory authority for the rule. \nThe Social Security Act grants the Secretary authority to issue rules and regulations “as may \nbe necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which” he is charged under the Act. \n42 U.S.C. § 1302(a); see also id. § 1395hh(a)(1). This language grants “broad authority,” Mourning v. \nFamily Publ’ns Serv., Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 365 (1973) (quotation marks omitted), and a rule issued under \nstatutes with this language “will be sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably related to the purposes of the \nenabling legislation.’” Id. at 369 (quoting Thorpe v. Hous. Auth. of City of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 280-81 \n(1969)). Section 1302(a) confers “broad rule-making powers . . . in substantially the same language” as \n11 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 21 of 40 PageID #:  538\nthe provisions at issue in these cases. See Thorpe, 393 U.S. at 277 n.28; see also Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S. \n132, 140 n.8 (1982). The Fifth Circuit thus applies the same “reasonably related” standard in reviewing \nan attack on the Secretary’s authority under § 1302(a). See Baylor Univ. Med. Ctr. v. Heckler, 758 F.2d \n1052, 1062 (5th Cir. 1985).  \nThe vaccination rule is well within the Secretary’s authority under this standard. Congress \ncreated the Medicare and Medicaid programs to provide health care to the populations covered under \neach program. See Good Samaritan Hosp., 508 U.S. at 404; see also 42 U.S.C. § 1396-1. The purpose of \nproviding health care to these populations is to advance and maintain patients’ health, not to harm \nthem. It is therefore unsurprising that Congress instructed the Secretary to administer these programs \nso as to ensure that patients’ health and safety is protected. Throughout the Medicare and Medicaid \nstatutes, Congress directed him to use the various tools at his disposal to ensure that health care \nfacilities do not harm their patients. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395aa(a); id. § 1396a(a)(36); id. § 1395bb(c).  \nParticularly relevant here, numerous provisions in the Medicare and Medicaid statutes charge \nthe Secretary with the responsibility to issue regulations, as he deems necessary, conditioning facilities’ \neligibility for these programs on their ability to protect the health and safety of their patients while \nthose patients are receiving care that is funded by either program. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)(9) \n(hospitals); id. § 1395i-3(d)(4)(B) (skilled nursing facilities); id. § 1395i-3(f)(1) (same). (A full listing of \nthe Secretary’s statutory authorities with respect to health and safety standards for the various types \nof facilities covered by the rule may be found at 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567.) These provisions operate \n“capaciously,” and “are broadly worded to give HHS significant leeway in deciding how best to \nsafeguard [patients’] health and safety.” Northport Health Servs. of Ark., LLC v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & \nHum. Servs., 14 F.4th 856, 870 (8th Cir. 2021) (discussing § 1395i-3). The statutes thus direct the \nSecretary to impose conditions of participation on health care facilities so as to protect patients’ health \nand safety—a responsibility that has taken on paramount importance during the pandemic.   \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that requiring vaccination of health care facility employees protects \nthe “health and safety” of those facilities’ patients, as those words are ordinarily understood. Instead, \nthey contend, based on canons such as the “major question” doctrine, that the statutes’ failure to \n12 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 22 of 40 PageID #:  539\nexpressly address vaccination means that Congress did not grant the Secretary authority to protect \npatients’ health and safety in this manner. Br. 10-14. But the interpretive canons on which Plaintiffs \nrely “may only be used where words are of obscure or doubtful meaning.” Iverson v. United States, 973 \nF.3d 843, 853 (8th Cir. 2020) (citing Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 514, 520 (1923)). \nHere, where “health and safety” has “a character of its own” that plainly encompasses preventing a \ndeadly disease, these canons are inapplicable. Russell Motor Car, 261 U.S. at 519. And, in any event, \nthese canons do not apply “unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed \npossibility and meant to say no to it.” Coastal Conservation Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Commerce, 846 F.3d 99, \n106 (5th Cir. 2017). Plaintiffs can point to no statutory text that would indicate that Congress meant \n“health and safety” to mean anything other than its natural implication, which includes the protection \nof patients from contracting highly infectious diseases at Medicare- and Medicaid-funded facilities.  \nFor this reason, Plaintiffs’ reliance on Alabama Association of Realtors v. Department of Health & \nHuman Services, 141 S. Ct. 2485 (2021), is misplaced. The Court there rejected an eviction moratorium \nunder a different statute, reasoning that a “downstream connection between eviction and the interstate \nspread of disease is markedly different from the direct targeting of disease that characterizes the \nmeasures  identified  in  [that]  statute.”  Id.  at  2488.  The  Secretary  here  is  not  regulating  the \n“downstream” effects of the pandemic. Rather, the statutes directly instruct him to protect the health \nand safety of patients while they receive care paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. Because the Secretary \nfound that patients in these settings face a high risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and that vaccines \nare an effective means of reducing and preventing transmission of the virus, he discharged his statutory \nduty by issuing his vaccination rule. See generally Merck & Co. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 962 \nF.3d 531, 537-38 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (distinguishing an invalid rule with only “a hoped-for trickle-down \neffect on the regulated programs” from a valid rule with “an actual and discernible nexus between the \nrule and the conduct or management of Medicare and Medicaid programs”).  \nPlaintiffs argue that the Secretary’s authority should be read narrowly, because the vaccination \nrule interferes with state authority over matters of public health, an area of “traditional state concern.” \nBr. 12. But the Medicare and Medicaid statutes were enacted under the Spending Clause. The Secretary \n13 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 23 of 40 PageID #:  540\nhas a duty to ensure that federal funds are used as Congress directed, in particular, by protecting \npatients’ health and safety at facilities funded by these programs. “Congress has authority under the \nSpending Clause to appropriate federal moneys to promote the general welfare, [and] to see to it that \ntaxpayer dollars appropriated under that power are in fact spent for the general welfare.” Sabri v. United \nStates, 541 U.S. 600, 605 (2004). This power applies even when Congress legislates “in an area \nhistorically of state concern.” Id. at 608 n.*. The rule does not intrude on state authority any more \nthan do the long-standing rules conditioning federal funds on providers’ commitment to prevent the \nspread of infection in their facilities. See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. §§ 416.51(b), 482.42(a), 483.80.7  \nPlaintiffs also attempt to invoke the nondelegation doctrine to contend that Congress could \nnot lawfully delegate to the Secretary the authority to protect the health and safety of Medicare and \nMedicaid patients. Br. 12. But “[d]elegations are constitutional so long as Congress lays down by \nlegislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the authority \nis directed to conform.” Big Time Vapes, Inc. v. FDA, 963 F.3d 436, 441 (5th Cir. 2020) (cleaned up), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2746 (2021). The Secretary’s statutory authority to protect Medicare and Medicaid \npatients’ health and safety easily meets this minimal standard. See Gundy v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2116, \n2129 (2019) (plurality opinion) (citing cases and noting that Supreme Court had previously upheld \ndelegations “to regulate ‘in the public interest”; “set ‘fair and equitable’ prices and ‘just and reasonable’ \nrates”; and “issue whatever air quality standards are ‘requisite to protect the public health’”).     \nFinally, Plaintiffs argue that the Secretary has purportedly asserted control over the selection \nof health care facility employees or the administration of health care institutions, in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. § 1395. This assertion, again, misconstrues the nature of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, \nand of the vaccination rule. Health care facilities voluntarily participate in Medicare and Medicaid. See \n                                                 \n7 For the same reason, Plaintiffs’ invocations of the Fifth Circuit’s grant of a stay application in BST \nHoldings, L.L.C. v. OSHA, ---F.4th---, 2021 WL 5279381 (5th Cir. Nov. 12, 2021), are entirely \nmisplaced. That case involved a different statute, under which OSHA exercised regulatory power \ngranted under the commerce power, and the court expressed concern about the reach of OSHA’s \ngeneral regulatory power. This case involves Congress’s exercise of its power to place conditions on \nfederal funds’ use, and health care facilities’ voluntary acceptance of those conditions when they \nparticipate in Medicare and Medicaid. \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 24 of 40 PageID #:  541\nBurditt v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 934 F.2d 1362, 1376 (5th Cir. 1991). If they choose to do \nso, they must “meet certain conditions of participation established by the Secretary” in order to receive \nfederal payments under these programs. United States v. Baylor Univ. Med. Ctr., 736 F.2d 1039, 1044 (5th \nCir. 1984). Those conditions have long included detailed rules addressing the qualifications of \nemployees at health care facilities. See, e.g., 42 C.F.R. § 482.22 (standards for medical staff at hospitals). \nThe Secretary’s vaccination rule, like these other rules addressing employee qualifications, ensures that \nfederal funds are used only to pay for the purposes that Congress intended. Because the vaccination \nrule is not a legal mandate, but instead a condition imposed on the payment of federal funds, the rule \ndoes not assert “control” over the administration of institutions. See Goodman v. Sullivan, 891 F.2d 449, \n451 (2d Cir. 1989); Am. Acad. of Ophthalmology, Inc. v. Sullivan, 998 F.2d 377, 387 (6th Cir. 1993).   \nB.  The rule is the product of reasoned decisionmaking. \nPlaintiffs contend that the Secretary acted arbitrarily by issuing a rule to protect the health and \nsafety of Medicare and Medicaid patients. Even assuming that claims under the Social Security Act \nincorporate the APA’s standard for arbitrary-and-capricious review, but see Estate of Morris v. Shalala, \n207 F.3d 744, 745 (5th Cir. 2000), that standard is easily met here.  This standard is “narrow and highly \ndeferential.” Sierra Club v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 990 F.3d 909, 913 (5th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). \n“[T]he ‘court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.’” Id. (citation omitted). Rather, it \n“consider[s] whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether \nthere has been a clear error of judgment.” Id. (citation omitted); see also FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, \n141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021).  The Secretary considered all the relevant factors, and reasonably \nexplained his decision, when he issued his rule to protect Medicare and Medicaid patients from the \ntransmission of a deadly virus at facilities funded by these programs. The APA requires nothing more.  \nProtection of the Health and Safety of Medicare and Medicaid Patients. The Secretary’s primary \nresponsibility is to protect the health and safety of patients receiving care at Medicare- and Medicaid-\nfunded facilities. He considered the available evidence and reasonably concluded that the rule would \nprotect these patients’ health and safety; indeed, the record overwhelmingly points to this conclusion.  \nSARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, and extremely dangerous. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,556-57. By \n15 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 25 of 40 PageID #:  542\nthe time this rule was published, COVID-19 had caused the deaths of at least 720,000 people in the \nUnited States, including at least 1,900 health care workers, and hospitalized at least 3 million people. \nId. at 61,556, 61,569. It is “the deadliest disease in American history.” Id. at 61,556. Given the virulence \nof this virus, it can be easily transmitted among health care workers, and from health care workers to \npatients, in health care facilities. Id. at 61,557 n.16. Unvaccinated health care workers are at increased \nrisk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and so exposing their colleagues and patients to the virus. Id. at 61,558 \nn.42. Due to many of the factors that qualify participants in the Medicare and Medicaid programs for \nenrollment (e.g., age, disability, and/or poverty), patients in facilities funded by these programs are \nmore likely than the general population to suffer severe illness or death from COVID-19. Id. at 61,609. \nFor these reasons, “the available evidence for ongoing healthcare-associated COVID-19 transmission \nrisk is sufficiently alarming in and of itself to compel CMS to take action.” Id. at 61,558. \nMedicare and Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to needed medical care is jeopardized by low rates \nof vaccination among health care workers at facilities funded by these programs. Id. Program patients \nhave refused care from unvaccinated staff, or forgone care altogether, to avoid contracting the virus \nfrom health care workers. Id. Absenteeism due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness has \ncontributed to staffing shortages that disrupt patient access to recommended care. Id. at 61,559.   \nFortunately, the approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe, 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,562, \nand highly effective in preventing serious outcomes of COVID-19, id. at 61,565 n.115. They offer \nstrong protection against known variants of the virus, including the Delta variant, particularly against \nhospitalization and death. Id. at 61,565 n.116. Recent studies show that the vaccines are highly effective \nin preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline workers. Id. at 61,585 n.205. Studies also show \nthat  vaccinated  people  with  breakthrough  infections  may  be  less  infectious  than  unvaccinated \nindividuals with primary infections, resulting in fewer transmission opportunities. Id. at 61,558 n.37.  \nIn short, evidence overwhelmingly points to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 is extremely \ndangerous for Medicare and Medicaid patients, and that health care staff vaccination is highly effective \nin preventing transmission among health care workers, and from the workers to patients. The \nSecretary, at minimum, reasonably so found, and he took action on that basis to fulfill his responsibility \n16 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 26 of 40 PageID #:  543\nto protect the health and safety of program beneficiaries while they receive care that these programs \npay for. The APA requires nothing more than that. See Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. at 1158.    \nStaff Shortages in Health Care Facilities. The Secretary also reasonably found that high rates of \nSARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care staff contribute to the health care worker shortage, and \nthat the rule would alleviate this problem. Many health care workers have missed work due to SARS-\nCoV-2 infection, disrupting patient access to care. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,559. At least 500,000 COVID-\n19 cases, and at least 1,900 COVID-19 deaths, have been reported among health care staff, with the \ntrue figures likely much higher. Id. The infection rate among health care staff has increased dramatically \nwith the Delta variant’s rise. Id. These trends are driven by health care staff vaccination rates that \nremain too low to protect staff and patients from the virus. Id. The Secretary thus fully explained that \nhis rule would help to alleviate staffing shortages at health care facilities, “particularly during periods \nof community surges in SARS–CoV–2 infection, when demand for health care services is most acute,” \nbecause “COVID-19 case rates among staff have also grown in tandem with broader national \nincidence trends since the Delta variant’s emergence.” Id. at 61,569-70, 61,585. \nPlaintiffs posit that a substantial portion of health care workers will leave their jobs rather than \nbe vaccinated, thereby threatening health care facilities’ operation. Br. 17. The Secretary considered \nthis possibility and rejected it, after reviewing recent empirical data regarding the effect of government- \nor privately-imposed vaccination requirements. Numerous health systems and health care employers \nnationwide have already implemented COVID-vaccine requirements. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,566. These \npolicies have had overwhelming success, even among health care workers previously hesitant to be \nvaccinated. Id. For example, after Houston Methodist implemented a vaccination requirement for \npractitioners at its facilities, it achieved a 99% compliance rate with that requirement among its \nemployees and physicians. Id. at 61,566 n.131. Novant Health similarly achieved 98.6% compliance \nwith its vaccination requirement for its staff. Id. at 61,566 n.132. The State of New York similarly \nreported a 92% compliance rate with its vaccine requirement. Id. at 61,569 n.159. Additional operators \nof more than 250 long-term care facilities around the country have achieved greater than 95%, and in \nsome cases 100%, vaccination rates after imposing their own requirements. Id. at 61,569 n.158.  \n17 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 27 of 40 PageID #:  544\nBased on this experience, a coalition of more than fifty professional health care associations, \nincluding the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and the National \nAssociation for Home Care and Hospice, concluded that vaccination requirements are in the best \ninterest of their members, of patients, and of health care facilities. Id. at 61,565. These organizations \nrepresent millions of workers throughout the U.S. health care industry, including groups representing \ndoctors, nurses, long-term care workers, home care workers, pharmacists, physician assistants, public \nhealth workers, hospice workers, and epidemiologists.  Id. at 61,565 & n.122.  \nThe Secretary recognized that there was some uncertainty as to how many employees would \nleave their jobs as a result of a vaccination rule, but concluded that it was more likely that any such \neffect would be more than offset by reduced staff absences from a reduction in illnesses, as well as a \nreturn to work of employees who have stayed out of the workforce for fear of contracting SARS-\nCoV-2. Id. at 61,608. Both effects, moreover, would be dwarfed by the ordinary degree of churn in \nthe market of labor in the health care industry. In any given year, about 2.66 million employees in \nhealth care settings are typically new hires, in a total workforce of 10.4 million employees. Id. Health \ncare providers are accustomed to regularly finding and replacing staff, and there is no reason to believe \nthat this process would become any more onerous, even if some unvaccinated workers leave for other \njobs. Id. at 61,608-09. In sum, after reviewing the real-world experience of vaccination requirements \nto date, the Secretary predicted that his rule would “result in nearly all health care workers being \nvaccinated.” Id. at 61,569. This predictive judgment is owed deference. See, e.g., Huawei Techs. USA, Inc. \nv. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, 455 (5th Cir. 2021); see also FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 521 \n(2009); Newspaper Ass’n of Am. v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 734 F.3d 1208, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  \nConsideration of Alternatives. The Secretary reasonably considered alternatives to his vaccination \nrule. Plaintiffs contend that he failed to consider the possibility of requiring health care workers to be \ntested regularly. Br. 18. But he explicitly addressed, and rejected, this option, noting that he had \n“reviewed scientific evidence on testing and found that vaccination is a more effective infection \ncontrol measure.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,614. Plaintiffs complain that the Secretary did not cite the \nevidence underlying this determination, but the APA does not require this. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(c) \n18 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 28 of 40 PageID #:  545\n(requiring rules only to recite “a concise general statement of their basis and purpose”). In any event, \nthe rule refers to evidence including studies showing that existing testing protocols are of limited \neffectiveness in preventing COVID-19 outbreaks, and that certain rapid COVID-19 tests will only \ndetect approximately 40% of asymptomatic cases.8 In contrast, recent studies of vaccine effectiveness \namong health care workers suggest that vaccinations prevent approximately 80% of infections in the \nfirst instance, and drastically reduce the risk of significant illness and hospitalization. 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,565. Moreover, the lone example Plaintiffs cite, from Utah, provides no evidence that the weekly \ntesting that State conducts is as effective in preventing staff from spreading infection to patients as \nvaccination is. Contra supra n.8. \nThe Secretary also considered exempting people with prior SARS-CoV-2 infections from his \nrule. Although Plaintiffs cherry-pick one particular study of patients in Israel, which reported finding \nhigh immunity levels for previously-infected persons, Br. 19, the Secretary reasonably relied on CDC’s \nanalysis, upon a complete review of the scientific literature, that the best scientific evidence points \nagainst exempting individuals with prior infections, whose infection-induced immunity is highly \nvariable, unlike vaccine-induced immunity. See 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,613; id. at 61,560. The weight of the \nevidence suggests that infection-induced immunity is not equivalent to vaccination for COVID-19, id. \nat 61,559, and that, even in persons with prior SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccination provides strong \nprotection against reinfection, id. at 61,585 n.205. In reviewing agency action, it “is generally not for \nthe judicial branch to undertake comparative evaluations of conflicting scientific evidence.” Bellion \nSpirits, LLC v. United States, 335 F. Supp. 3d 32, 42 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’’d, 7 F.4th 1201 (D.C. Cir. 2021) \n(citation omitted). The Secretary’s evaluation of the scientific literature is owed deference here. \nChange in Position. The Secretary explained that, after vaccines became available to the general \npopulation, his initial approach was “to encourage rather than mandate vaccination.” 86 Fed. Reg. at \n                                                 \n8 See Isaac See, et al., Modeling Effectiveness of Testing Strategies to Prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-\n19) in Nursing Homes – United States, 2020, 73 Clinical Infectious Diseases 792 (Aug. 2, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/96QK-C685; Ian W.

It appeared at the time that “a combination of other Federal actions, a variety of public \neducation campaigns, and State and employer-based efforts would be adequate.” Id. Unfortunately, \n“vaccine uptake among health care staff has not been as robust as hoped for and ha[s] been insufficient \nto protect the health and safety of individuals receiving health care services” from covered providers. \nId.; see also id. at 61,599. The Secretary determined that action was now needed to achieve the higher \nvaccination rates among health care workers necessary to protect patients. Id. at 61,583. He thus \nshowed that he was aware that he was changing his policy on this issue, and explained his reasons for \ndoing so. The APA requires no more. See Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. at 515.     \nAlleged Pretext. Nor are Plaintiffs correct that the Secretary’s justification is pretextual. Br. 19. \nThe rule recites that he is using his statutory authority to promote “[h]igher rates of vaccination . . . in \nhealth care settings,” in light of his duty “to protect the health and safety of individuals providing and \nreceiving care and services from Medicare- and Medicaid-certified providers.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560. \nAlthough Plaintiffs accuse the Secretary of a hidden agenda of also protecting the general community, \nhe forthrightly explained his prediction that the rule would also have that positive, additional effect. \nId. at 61,612. Unlike Department of Commerce v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2575 (2019), there is not a \n“significant mismatch between the decision the Secretary made and the rationale he provided.” The \nSecretary  took  action  to  protect  patients  at  federally-funded  facilities,  as  it  was  his  statutory \nresponsibility to do. See also id. at 2573 (“[A] court may not set aside an agency’s policymaking decision \nsolely because it might have been . . . prompted by an Administration’s priorities.”).    \nAsserted Reliance Interests. Plaintiffs wrongly contend that the Secretary failed to account for any \nreliance interests of states, healthcare providers, and their workers. Br. 20. To the contrary, he directly \naccounted for the costs that employers and some employees would incur under the rule. 86 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,607-10. He reasonably concluded, however, that the benefits far outweighed the costs. He \ncalculated that the rule’s benefits would outweigh its costs even if only 120 lives were saved, or 600 \nhospitalizations prevented. Id. at 61,612. The lives saved under the rule will probably be “many times \nhigher” than that threshold: although these estimates are somewhat uncertain, “total lives saved under \nthis rule may well reach several hundred a month or perhaps several thousand a month.” Id. Nothing \n20 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 30 of 40 PageID #:  547\nin the APA required the Secretary to weigh the costs more heavily than the benefit of lives saved.   \nThe Scope of the Rule. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the rule is overbroad, either because it \nshould have applied only to facilities that care for the elderly and infirm, or because it should have \nexempted personnel without direct patient contact. Br. 20-21. The Secretary reasonably explained both \npolicy choices. First, Plaintiffs assert that the rule “reaches many categories of healthcare facilities, \nsuch as psychiatric residential treatment facilities [PRTFs] for individual[s] 21 years of age . . . that are \nnot related to CMS’s asserted interest in protecting elderly and infirm patients from the transmission \nof COVID-19.” Id. at 20-21. But that misstates the Secretary’s interest; his statutory duties do not \nextend only to the elderly or infirm; his duty is to protect the health and safety of each of the patient \npopulations at health care facilities covered by this rule. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(h)(1). And he \nreasonably concluded that individuals in congregate care settings, such as PRTFs, are at greater risk of \nacquiring infections, including infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,575.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs contend that the rule is overbroad because it requires vaccination of staff that \nmay come into contact with others at the site of care. Br. 21. But the Secretary explained at length why \nthe rule should cover such personnel. See, e.g., 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,570-71. He concluded that they may \n“encounter fellow employees . . . who will themselves enter a health care facility or site of care for \ntheir job responsibilities[.]” Id. at 61,568. Given SARS-CoV-2’s high transmissibility and demonstrated \ntransmission rates among health care workers, this conclusion was eminently reasonable. See id. at \n61,557.9 Plaintiffs’ argument reduces to a dispute over where to draw the line for a vaccination rule. \nBut an agency “is not required to identify the optimal threshold with pinpoint precision. It is only \nrequired to identify the standard and explain its relationship to the underlying regulatory concerns.” \nWorldCom, Inc. v. FCC, 238 F.3d 449, 461-62 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The Secretary did so here. \nC.  The Secretary had good cause to issue the rule on an interim basis. \nNotice-and-comment rulemaking is not required “when the agency for good cause finds (and \n                                                 \n9 At the same time, the rule exempts from the vaccine requirements those staff who “telework full-\ntime,” and vendors and other professionals who perform infrequent, non-healthcare services. 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,571. The Secretary also found that it would be “overly burdensome” to mandate that all \nproviders and suppliers ensure COVID-19 vaccination “for all individuals who enter the facility.” Id.     \n21 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 31 of 40 PageID #:  548\nincorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and \npublic procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 553(b)(B); 42 U.S.C. § 1395hh(b)(2)(C). This exception excuses notice and comment in emergency \nsituations, or where delay could result in serious harm. See Jifry v. FAA, 370 F.3d 1174, 1179 (D.C. Cir. \n2004). The Secretary’s finding here more than meets that standard. \nThe Secretary explained that any further delay “would endanger the health and safety of \nadditional patients and be contrary to the public interest.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,584. He properly found \nthat any delay for a comment period would be contrary to the public interest, given the rules’ “life-\nsaving importance.” Council of S. Mountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 573, 581 (D.C. Cir. 1981); see also \nChambless Enters., LLC v. Redfield, 508 F. Supp. 3d 101, 119 (W.D. La. 2020). The Secretary projected \nthat the “total lives saved under this rule may well reach several hundred . . . or perhaps several \nthousand a month.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,612. Any further delay in issuing the rule “would do real harm,” \nU.S. Steel Corp. v. U.S. EPA, 595 F.2d 207, 214 (5th Cir. 1979), in the form of lives lost that would \nhave been saved under the rule. See also Sorenson Comm’ns Inc. v. FCC, 755 F.3d 702, 706 (D.C. Cir. \n2014) (although good cause is rarely invoked, “we have approved an agency’s decision to bypass notice \nand comment where delay would imminently threaten life”); Chambless Enters., 508 F. Supp. 3d at 119.  \nRather than grapple with this reality, Plaintiffs argue that the Secretary could have started his \nrulemaking earlier. Br. 9. But he explained that he initially chose a policy of “encourag[ing] rather than \nmandat[ing] vaccination,” believing that a combination of other efforts would be “adequate,” 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,583, and only issued the vaccination rule after first determining that such other efforts were \ninsufficient. See id. at 61,559, 61,583. Given data showing that SARS–CoV–2 is highly transmissible \nbetween health-care workers and patients in hospitals, and the growth in case rates among health care \nworkers, id. at 61,585, he found that delaying the rule “would contribute to additional negative health \noutcomes for patients including loss of life,” id. at 61,584. And, although Plaintiffs fault the Secretary \nfor not immediately issuing a rule when he announced his plans to do so in September, the fact that \nhe completed a 73-page rule, with an analysis of over 200 cited sources, in less than 2 months shows \n22 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 32 of 40 PageID #:  549\nthat he and his agency acted with appropriate dispatch in the face of the crisis.10  \nPlaintiffs also fault the Secretary for issuing his rule at a time when COVID-19 case rates were \ndecreasing. Br. 9. (This is no longer the case. See supra n.2.) But he identified “emerging indications of \npotential increases,” and foresaw that a renewed surge during the winter flu season would exacerbate \nthe strain on the health care system. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,584. Because flu incidence is highest in \n“December through March” and “COVID-19 vaccines require time after administration for the body \nto build an immune response,” he reasonably found that “a staff COVID-19 vaccination requirement \nfor the providers and suppliers identified in this rule cannot be further delayed.” Id. Deference is owed \nto his predictive judgment on this score. See Huawei Techs., 2 F.4th at 455. Taken together, the Secretary \ndetailed his considered, supported reasons for why his rule is needed right now to save lives. If this case \ndoes not satisfy the good cause exception, it is hard to imagine when the exception ever might apply. \nBecause the Secretary had good cause to forgo notice and comment, Plaintiffs’ three additional \nprocedural arguments are unavailing. First, they contend that he violated 42 U.S.C. § 1395z, which \nprovides that, “[i]n carrying out his functions, relating to determination of [some, but not all, of the] \nconditions of participation by providers . . . [of services at issue here], the Secretary shall consult with \nappropriate State agencies[.]” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567 (citation omitted). The Secretary found that “[a]ny \ndelay in the implementation of this rule would result in additional deaths and serious illnesses among \nhealth care staff and consumers, further exacerbating the newly-arising, and ongoing, strain on the \ncapacity of health care facilities to serve the public,” id., and thus there were no entities with which it \nwould be “appropriate to engage in these consultations in advance of issuing” the rule, but noted that \nhe would engage in consultations after the rule’s issuance “in carrying out [his] functions.” Id. That \nfinding is owed deference, for the same reasons that the Secretary’s decision to issue an interim final \nrule is so entitled. See The GEO Grp., Inc. v. Newsom, 15 F.4th 919, 930 (9th Cir. 2021) (statute \nauthorizing agency to take “appropriate” action “is a hallmark of vast discretion”). See also Kisor v. \nWilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2448 (2019) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in the judgment) (“broad and open-\n                                                 \n10 See Anne Joseph O’Connell, Agency Rulemaking and Political Transitions, 105 N.W. L. Rev. 471, 513-19 \n(2011) (on average, federal rulemakings take 1.3 years to complete).  \n23 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 33 of 40 PageID #:  550\nended terms” like “‘appropriate’” “afford agencies broad policy discretion”); Alon Refin. Krotz Springs, \nInc. v. EPA, 936 F.3d 628, 655 (D.C. Cir. 2019), cert. denied sub nom., Valero Energy Corp. v. EPA, 140 S. \nCt. 2792 (2020) (“nor does the phrase ‘as appropriate’ itself specify a particular temporal dimension”).  \nSecond, Plaintiffs contend that the Secretary violated 42 U.S.C. § 1302(b), which requires the \npreparation of a regulatory impact analysis upon publication of a “notice of proposed rulemaking,” id. \n§ 1302(b)(1), or upon publication of a “final version of a rule or regulation with respect to which an \ninitial regulatory impact analysis is required by paragraph (1),” id. § 1302(b)(2). This requirement does \nnot apply here. The Secretary did not publish a notice of proposed rulemaking, and this is not the final \nversion of a rule with respect to which an initial regulatory impact analysis was required. The Secretary \naccordingly reasonably found that the statute did not require an analysis under either paragraph; the \nplain text of the statute “only applies to final rules for which a proposed rule was published,” 86 Fed. \nReg. at 61,613, not to interim final rules that the Secretary publishes to address emergencies such as \nan imminent threat to patients’ lives.  See Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) (courts may not impose additional procedural requirements on rulemakings \nbeyond those expressed in statute); Abubaker Abushagif v. Garland, 15 F.4th 323, 332 (5th Cir. 2021). \nThird, Plaintiffs contend that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. § 808. But that provision simply \ngrafts the APA’s good cause standard onto the Congressional Review Act. Moreover, 5 U.S.C. § 805 \n“denies courts the power to void rules on the basis of agency noncompliance with the [CRA].” \nMontanans for Multiple Use v. Barbouletos, 568 F.3d 225, 229 (D.C. Cir. 2009).  \nD. The rule is constitutional. \nThe vaccination rule does not, as Plaintiffs contend, Br. 21-22, violate either the Tenth \nAmendment or the Spending Clause. Congress spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year to pay \nfor health care under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. See Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 139 S. Ct. \n1804, 1808 (2019). Most facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid payments are privately owned and \noperated. State-operated facilities that choose to participate in Medicare or Medicaid must agree to \nabide by the same health and safety standards that apply to private facilities. Congress unquestionably \nhas the authority to require health care facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid payments to adhere \n24 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 34 of 40 PageID #:  551\nto standards that protect the health and safety of the patients, and that power exists regardless whether \nCongress acts “in an area historically of state concern.” Sabri v. United States, 541 U.S. at 605, 608 n.*; \nsee also Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619, 641 (1936); Northport Health Servs., 14 F.4th at 869 n.5 \n(recognizing Congress’s authority to control how Medicare funds are spent).   \nPlaintiffs contend that their state-run facilities lacked constitutionally adequate notice of the \nrule, because its requirements are not explicitly spelled out in the statute. Br. 21. This claim is meritless. \nEven when funding conditions apply to a State in its capacity as regulator (rather than, as here, in its \ncapacity as facility operator), the Constitution does not demand this level of exactitude. See, e.g., Bennett \nv. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669 (1985). “Congress is not required to list every factual instance \nin which a state will fail to comply with a condition.” Mayweathers v. Newland, 314 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th \nCir. 2002); see also W. Virginia Dep’t of Health & Hum. Res. v. Sebelius, 649 F.3d 217, 223 (4th Cir. 2011). \nTheir alternative contention that their survey agencies are “commandeered” into enforcing the \nrule, Br. 21-22, has no bearing on the validity of the rule itself and, in any event, mischaracterizes the \nrole of state survey agencies. The statute permits States to enter agreements with the Secretary to \nsurvey facilities’ compliance with the conditions of participation in Medicare and Medicaid. These \nagreements are entirely voluntary. See 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a). Moreover, survey agencies do not \n“enforce” the conditions of participation, as Plaintiffs suggest, Br. 22; they instead report their findings \nto CMS, which has sole authority to determine noncompliance and impose remedies on Medicare \nproviders. 42 C.F.R. §§ 488.10(a), 488.26(c)(1).   \nPlaintiffs’ observation that they will not be compensated for surveys if they decline to perform \nthem, Br. 21, is unremarkable. Plaintiffs cannot seriously contend that this consequence bears any \nresemblance to the “coercion” at issue in NFIB, which held that Congress could not make the entirety \nof a State’s traditional Medicaid funding contingent on participation in a new program to provide \nhealth coverage for all low-income adults. Here, the Secretary is not “enlisting the States in a new \nhealth care program,” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Businesses v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 584 (2012) (“NFIB”). See \nGruver v. La. Bd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. & Mech. Coll., 959 F.3d 178, 184 (5th Cir.), cert. \ndenied, 141 S. Ct. 901 (2020). He is simply applying the existing provisions of the Medicare and \n25 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 35 of 40 PageID #:  552\nMedicaid statutes to fulfill his statutory duty to protect the health and safety of beneficiaries of these \nprograms. And the magnitude of federal funding at issue for surveys is miniscule compared to the \nfunds that were at stake in NFIB. \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS DO NOT MEET THE REMAINING INJUNCTION FACTORS.  \nA.  Plaintiffs fail to establish irreparable harm. \nPlaintiffs also cannot demonstrate likely irreparable harm. See Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., ---F. Supp. 3d---, 2021 WL 5416122 (N.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2021). This showing “is required for \ninjunctive relief.” Motient Corp. v. Dondero, 529 F.3d 532, 538 (5th Cir. 2008).  \nPlaintiffs suffer no cognizable harm to their “sovereign interests” at all, let alone a harm of \nthe type required for equitable relief. Br. 23. Absent an allegation that the State’s own enforcement \nactivities are disrupted, they do not have a cognizable interest for Article III purposes in the abstract \nquestion whether a state law purporting to create immunities from federal regulation is preempted. See \nVa. ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253, 270 (4th Cir. 2011); see also Florida, 2021 WL 5416122 at \n*4 (rejecting this same argument as “lack[ing] merit”). And, as for their asserted quasi-sovereign \ninterests or parens patriae interests, Br. 23-24, they lack standing to sue the federal government in that \ncapacity, i.e., to protect its citizenry from the operation of federal law. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son v. \nPuerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 610 n.16 (1982) (“A State does not have standing as parens patriae \nto bring an action against the Federal Government”); see also Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 520 \nn.17 (2007) (noting the difference between a prohibited suit wherein a State seeks to protect its citizens \nfrom the operation of federal statutes, and a permitted suit whereby a State asserts its rights under \nfederal law).     \nAlthough Plaintiffs allege “irreparable economic injuries” and a diversion of state resources, \nBr. 22-23, neither constitutes irreparable harm. See Florida, 2021 WL 5416122 at *3 (“[E]conomic loss \nsuch as the loss of funding is not irreparable.”). Congress adjudged that, even though § 405’s \nchanneling provision “comes at a price, namely, occasional individual, delay-related hardship,” that \nprice is justified “[i]n the context of a massive, complex health and safety program such as Medicare.” \n26 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 36 of 40 PageID #:  553\nIllinois Council, 529 U.S. at 13. \nPlaintiffs’ claims of economic harm as to certain state-run health care providers are also \nspeculative, as the Florida court recognized. That court “disregarded as conclusory” and “speculative” \nthe State’s assertions (in declarations materially identical to those submitted here) “of how the various \n[state] agencies and institutions anticipate they may be adversely impacted by the mandate.” Florida, \n2021 WL 5416122 at *3. The court also noted that Florida’s affidavits failed to “take . . . into account \nany impact from the availability of the exemption process,” and concluded that Florida had failed to \nprovide any “evidence to suggest that the anticipated loss of federal funding from the State agencies’ \nnoncompliance will occur immediately on December 6, 2021.” Id..  \nPlaintiffs’ evidence here is equally lacking. They rely on conjecture that they may need to \n“reduce services and lose revenue.” Br. 23. But “[t]here must be a likelihood that irreparable harm will \noccur. . . . [A] preliminary injunction will not be issued simply to prevent the possibility of some \nremote future injury.” United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001). As discussed, the \nSecretary acted against a backdrop in which many health care workers “already comply with employer \nor State government vaccination requirements.” 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,567. He acknowledged concerns \nthat some workers are reluctant to obtain vaccinations, but he found—based on real-world experience \nwith COVID-19 vaccination requirements in a variety of settings—that the rule was likely to be highly \nsuccessful, and that the vast majority of non-exempt individuals would obtain vaccination, even where \nthey had expressed an initial unwillingness to do so. Id. at 61,569; see also Determination of the Acting \nOMB Director Regarding the Revised Safer Federal Workforce Task Force Guidance for Federal \nContractors & the Revised Economy & Efficiency Analysis, 86 Fed. Reg. 63,418, 63,422 (Nov. 16, \n2021) (Office of Management & Budget analysis noting that “Tyson Foods reported more than 96 \npercent of its workforce is now vaccinated” after imposing a vaccination requirement). Moreover, \ngiven the high degree of churn in the health care workforce—about one quarter of health care workers, \non average, are new hires each year—the Secretary reasonably found that any effect of unvaccinated \nworkers leaving jobs with health care facilities, or of vaccinated workers newly seeking employment \nthere, would be dwarfed by this regular feature of the health care industry. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,608. \n27 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 37 of 40 PageID #:  554\nPlaintiffs identify no concrete evidence demonstrating that large numbers of health care \nworkers will actually leave their jobs if the rule remains in effect. They cite speculative declarations \nfrom health care agencies that providers “may lose significant percentages of their employees,” Decl. \nof Stephanie McGee Azar, ¶ 11, ECF No. 2-4, but they have not identified any facilities that actually \nissued or were subject to vaccination requirements and lost significant numbers of employees. Absent \nsuch evidence, Plaintiffs cannot show that the harm they fear will in fact occur, or that it would in any \nway outstrip the regular and large-scale movement of workers in the health care workforce.    \nAnd critically, even if some facilities cannot immediately comply with the rule, Plaintiffs \nwrongly assume that immediate termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs will result. \nCMS has published a set of FAQs detailing its implementation plans for the rule, which explains, \n“CMS’s goal is to bring health care facilities into compliance. Termination would generally occur only \nafter providing a facility with an opportunity to make corrections and come into compliance.” CMS, \nOmnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination Interim Final Rule (External FAQ), 10 (Nov. 24, \n2021), https://perma.cc/85PY-SCL4. Thus, Plaintiffs cannot show that any injury is imminent.   \nB.  Plaintiffs fail to establish that the balance of equities and public interest factors \nfavor the requested injunction. \nThe third and fourth requirements for a preliminary injunction—the balance of harms and the \npublic interest—“merge when the Government is the opposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n435 (2009). Here, these considerations tilt decisively in Defendants’ favor. An injunction against the \nrule would harm the public interest in slowing the spread of COVID-19 among millions of health care \nworkers  and  patients  at  federally-funded  health  care  facilities.  The  Secretary  projects  that  the \nvaccination rule may save hundreds, and potentially thousands, of lives each month. 86 Fed. Reg. at \n61,612. In the context of this pandemic, “federal courts across the country have routinely concluded \nthat undoing orders deemed necessary by public health officials and experts to contain a contagious \nand fast-spreading disease would result in comparatively more severe injury to the community.” \nChambless Enters., 508 F. Supp. 3d at 123 (citation omitted). In evaluating the balance of harms, “courts \nproperly decline to second-guess the judgments of public health officials.” Id. (citations omitted).   \n28 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 38 of 40 PageID #:  555\nBy comparison, any theoretical harm “pales in comparison to the significant loss of lives that \nDefendants have demonstrated could occur” if the rule is enjoined. Id. (citation omitted). As explained \nabove, Part III.A, Plaintiffs’ claimed harms are both speculative and purely economic. Nowhere do \nthey dispute the life-saving effects of vaccination; in fact, in discussing the public interest prong, they \nfail even to acknowledge the unparalleled American casualties from COVID-19. Although they argue \nthat the rule will cause health care staff to leave their jobs in large numbers, they have set forth no \nevidence to show that the vaccination rule will actually have that effect. In fact, as noted in the rule, \nthere are clear examples of requirements having exactly the effect that the Secretary intends—\nincreasing the percentage of vaccinated staff to very high levels. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,569.  \nMoreover, “[t]here is inherent harm to an agency in preventing it from enforcing regulations \nthat Congress found it in the public interest to direct that agency to develop.” Cornish v. Dudas, 540 F. \nSupp. 2d 61, 65 (D.D.C. 2008). Congress has charged the Secretary with the responsibility to protect \nthe health and safety of individuals providing and receiving care and services from Medicare and \nMedicaid providers. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395x(e)(9); 1395i–3(d)(4)(B). The public interest favors \nallowing the Secretary to fulfill these responsibilities. \nIV.  ANY RELIEF SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY LIMITED.    \nIf the Court disagrees with Defendants’ arguments, any relief should be no broader than \nnecessary to remedy the demonstrated irreparable harms of these Plaintiffs. “A plaintiff’s remedy must \nbe tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury,” Gill v. Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1934 (2018), and \n“injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete \nrelief to the plaintiffs,” Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (citation omitted). \nIn that regard, first, any injunction should apply only to those aspects of the rule for which the \nCourt finds Plaintiffs have met their burden under the four-factor test for emergency relief. The \nSupreme Court has held a regulation severable where severance would “not impair the function of the \nstatute as a whole, and there is no indication that the regulation would not have been passed but for \nits inclusion.” K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U.S. 281, 294 (1988) (invalidating only the provision of \n29 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 39 of 40 PageID #:  556\na regulation that exceeded the agency’s statutory authority). Severability clauses, such as the one in the \nrule, see 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,560, create a presumption that the validity of the entire regulation is not \ndependent on the validity of any specific unlawful provision if that unlawful provision would not \nimpair the function of the regulation as a whole. Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 686 (1987). \nSecond, any injunctive relief should be limited, at most, to facilities operated by Plaintiffs. “The \nCourt’s constitutionally prescribed role is to vindicate the individual rights of the people appearing \nbefore it.” Gill, 138 S. Ct. at 1933; see also id. at 1934 (citing Daimler Chrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, \n353 (2006)); Madsen, 512 U.S. at 765. Indeed, Plaintiffs have no interest in whether facilities in other \nStates are subject to the rule during the pendency of this lawsuit (and in fact, if their allegations \nconcerning trends among health care workers are to be believed, they would benefit from relief being \ncircumscribed within their own borders to facilities they themselves operate), nor standing to assert \nclaims on behalf of facilities that Plaintiffs do not themselves operate. Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims would \nbe fully redressed through a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Secretary from “implementing” or \n“enforcing” the rule against only the facilities that Plaintiffs operate. \nNationwide relief would be particularly harmful here given that two other district courts are \ncurrently considering similar challenges, and a third recently decided one. A nationwide injunction \nwould render the district court’s order in Florida, as well as any additional orders that might follow \nfrom other courts considering similar claims, meaningless as a practical matter. It would also preclude \nappellate courts from testing Plaintiffs’ claims against the rule in other jurisdictions. Moreover, many \nStates are not challenging the vaccination rule. There is no reason why Plaintiffs’ disagreements with \nit should govern the rest of the country. See California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 583 (9th Cir. 2018) (“The \ndetrimental consequences of a nationwide injunction are not limited to their effects on judicial \ndecisionmaking. There are also the equities of non-parties who are deprived the right to litigate in \nother forums.”); see also id. at 582-84 (vacating nationwide scope of injunction in facial APA challenge). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied. \n \n30 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 21   Filed 11/29/21   Page 40 of 40 PageID #:  557\nDated: November 26, 2021        Respectfully submitted, \n \n              BRIAN M.

As the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services reasonably determined, his vaccination rule is likely to save \nhundreds, and possibly thousands, of lives each month, once it is implemented.  Accordingly, if the \nrule were not implemented, there would be a substantial harm to Defendants’ compelling public \ninterest in the protection of the lives and well-being of patients served by health care facilities funded \nby the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  \nCourts consider four factors in assessing the propriety of granting a motion for stay pending \nappeal: (1) the movant’s likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the appeal, (2) whether the movant \nwill suffer irreparable damage absent a stay, (3) the harm that other parties will suffer if a stay is \ngranted, and (4) the public interest.  See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987); Planned Parenthood \nof Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F.3d 406, 410 (5th Cir. 2013).  When the Government \nis a party, its interests and the public interest overlap in the balancing of harms.  See Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 420 (2009). \nThe Fifth Circuit has explained that while “[l]ikelihood of success [is] a prerequisite in the \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 32-1   Filed 12/01/21   Page 2 of 4 PageID #:  674\nusual case[, . . . ] it is not an invariable requirement.”  Ruiz v. Estelle, 666 F.2d 854, 857 (5th Cir. 1982).  \nRather, “the movant need only present a substantial case on the merits when a serious legal question \nis involved and show that the balance of the equities weighs heavily in favor of granting the stay.”  \nArnold v. Garlock, Inc., 278 F.3d 426, 438–39 (5th Cir. 2001) (internal quotations and citations \nomitted); see also, e.g., Population Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1078 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“It will \nordinarily be enough that the [movant] has raised serious legal questions going to the merits, so serious, \nsubstantial, difficult as to make them a fair ground of litigation . . .” (quoting Wash. Metro. Area Transit \nComm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 844 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).   \nThe substantiality of Defendants’ arguments on appeal, together with the balance of hardships, \nweigh heavily in favor of granting a stay pending appellate review.  The United States is in the midst \nof the most serious public health crisis it has ever faced.  COVID-19 is the deadliest disease in United \nStates history.  As of the time of the issuance three weeks ago of the rule at issue in this case, SARS-\nCoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, had infected over 44 million people, hospitalized more than \n3 million people, and had claimed more than 720,000 lives in the United States alone.  Included among \nthe tremendous human cost are at least half a million reported cases and 1,900 reported deaths among \nhealth  care  staff.    Medicare  and  Medicaid  Programs;  Omnibus  COVID-19  Health  Care  Staff \nVaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555, 61,559 (Nov. 5, 2021).   \nCongress has specified that, in order for health care facilities to receive funding under the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, hospitals and other participating facilities must meet conditions of \nparticipation set by the Secretary to protect the health and safety of patients receiving care at these \nfacilities.  The Secretary followed Congress’s instructions by issuing this vaccination rule.  He \nreasonably determined that the presence of unvaccinated health care workers in facilities serving \nMedicare  and  Medicaid  patients  poses  a  risk  of  transmitting  SARS-CoV-2  to  those  patients.  \nAccordingly, the Secretary required facilities, as a condition of participation in Medicare and Medicaid, \nto ensure that covered staff either obtain vaccination against COVID-19 or seek an exemption from \ndoing so.    \nDefendants’ appeal will raise substantial arguments with regard to this Court’s jurisdiction in \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 3:21-cv-03970-TAD-KDM   Document 32-1   Filed 12/01/21   Page 3 of 4 PageID #:  675\nthis matter, as well as substantial arguments in support of the Secretary’s statutory authority to \nestablish conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Defendants’ appeal will \nalso raise substantial arguments in support of finding that the Secretary, having considered the \navailable evidence, reasonably exercised his judgment both in issuing his vaccination rule and in \ndetermining that good cause justified his doing so without first undertaking notice and comment \nprocedures.  The remaining equitable factors also weigh heavily in favor of a stay.  Irreparable harm, \nin the form of hundreds or thousands of lives lost each month, would arise if the vaccination rule \nwere not implemented.  The balance of hardships and the public interest, accordingly, also tip in favor \nof a stay.   \nDefendants recognize that this Court has rejected their arguments.  Accordingly, Defendants \nrefrain from reiterating each of their arguments in detail here, and instead incorporate their previously-\nfiled opposition to the preliminary injunction motion by reference.  See Defs.’ Mem. in Opp’n to Pls.’ \nMot. for Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 21.  Defendants respectfully submit, however, that the issues are serious \nand that the Court should issue a stay pending appeal to preserve the status quo while the Court of \nAppeals considers these issues.      \nFor all of these reasons, Defendants respectfully request that this Court stay its preliminary \ninjunction in this case pending appeal. \n \nDated: December 1, 2021        Respectfully submitted, \n \n              BRIAN M.
