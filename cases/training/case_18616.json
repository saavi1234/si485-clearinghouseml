The in-person oral argument scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 28, 2021 is CANCELLED; 2. Plaintiffs' pending request to convert the TRO to a preliminary injunction will be heard on the submission of the papers with no appearances required or allowed; 3. Defendants' opposition remains due on or before Wednesday, September 22, 2021 at 5:00 p.m.; 4. Because of the likelihood of irreparable harm to plaintiffs and in light of the fact that the practical effect of the TRO will not begin to restrain the enforcement of the disputed regulation until September 27, 2021, the Court finds that good cause exists to extend the TRO a further fourteen days to October 12, 2021; and 5.

          "description": "ORDER VACATING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION: On August 26, 2021, the New York State Department of Health adopted an emergency regulation that required most healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 within thirty days. N.Y. COMP. CODES R. & REGS. tit. 10, § 2.61(c) (2021). As relevant here, § 2.61 eliminated a religious exemption included in the first iteration of the mandate. On September 13, 2021, seventeen healthcare workers employed in New York State (\"plaintiffs\"), all of whom object to the existing COVID-19 vaccines on religious grounds, filed this official-capacity 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against New York State Governor Kathy Hochul (\"Hochul\"), New York State Health Commissioner Howard A. Zucker (\"Zucker\"), and New York State Attorney General Letitia James (\"James\"). Plaintiffs' three-count verified complaint alleges that§ 2.61 violates their constitutional rights because it effectively forbids employers from considering workplace religious accommodations under processes guaranteed by federal law. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin defendants from, inter alia, enforcing § 2.61 ''to the extent it categorically requires health care employers to deny or revoke religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination mandates.\" On September 14, 2021, the Court issued a temporary order restraining defendants from enforcing § 2.61 to the extent it categorically required health care employers to deny or revoke a religious exemption from COVID-19 vaccination. Dr. A. v. Hochul, 2021 WL 4189533 (N.D.N.Y) (emphasis added). After additional briefing, the temporary restraining order was converted to a preliminary injunction on October 12, 2021. 1 Dr. A. v. Hochul, --F. Supp. 3d--, 2021 WL 4734404 (N.D.N.Y.). Defendants appealed. On November 1, 2021, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the preliminary injunction vacated. Dkt. No. 26 . As relevant here, the panel opinion concluded that plaintiffs had failed to establish§ 2.61 was not a neutral law of general applicability and therefore subjected it to only rational basis review. Dkt. No. 27 at 35. Relying on Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905) and Phillips v. City of N. Y., 775 F.3d 538 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam), the panel held that § 2.61 \"was a reasonable exercise of the State's power to enact rules to protect the public health.\" Dkt. No. 27 at 35. The panel opinion went on to conclude that plaintiffs had also failed to establish that § 2.61 conflicts with Title VII or federal law because it \"does not prevent employees from seeking a religious accommodation allowing them to continue working consistent with the Rule. while avoiding the vaccination requirement.\" Dkt. No. 27 at 38 (emphasis added). Therefore, plaintiffs no longer need the preliminary injunction. A certified copy of the Second Circuit's order issued on November 4, 2021. Dkt. No. 27 . Therefore, it is ORDERED that The preliminary injunction entered in favor of plaintiffs on October 12, 2021 is VACATED. Signed by Judge David N. Hurd on 11/5/2021. (ptm) (Entered: 11/05/2021)"

    "summary": "<p>Several healthcare workers in New York brought this suit to enjoin the state of New York from enforcing its vaccine mandate for healthcare workers. The healthcare workers filed their suit on September 13, 2021 in the Northern District of the U.S. District Court. They were represented by the Thomas More Society. Because the vaccine mandate did not allow religious exemptions, the health care workers alleged violations of the Free Exercise Clause, the Supremacy Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The case was assigned to Judge David Hurd.</p>\r\n<p>The healthcare workers secured early victories in district court. On September 14, 2021, the district court granted the health care workers a temporary restraining order that enjoined the mandate's enforcement. Then the district court converted the TRO into a preliminary injunction on October 12, 2021. 567 F.Supp.3d 362.</p>\r\n<p>But the state appealed the preliminary injunction and it was contested up to the Supreme Court. First, on November 1, 2020, the Second Circuit vacated the order in tandem with We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul. 17 F.4th 266. The healthcare workers appealed this decision to the United States Supreme Court. But on December 13, 2021, the Supreme Court denied the petitioner for certiorari. 142 S.Ct. 552 (Mem). Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Alito, issued a dissent from the denial of certiorari, stating that he would have granted certiorari because the policy provides medical exemptions but doesn't provide similar exemptions for religious purposes.</p>\r\n<p>On January 30, 2022, the healthcare workers filed their first amended complaint, which added two additional claims. First, the healthcare workers alleged that New York's mandate was in direct conflict with the CMS mandate, a regulation promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services since the original complaint had been filed. New York's mandate, according to the healthcare workers, was in direct conflict with the CMS mandate, which required a process for considering requests for religious exemption from COVID vaccination consistent with Title VII. Second, the healthcare workers alleged that the state&mdash;by denying unemployment benefits to those who were fired due to their refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine&mdash;unlawfully disqualified them from state unemployment insurance benefits.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day they filed their amended complaint, the healthcare workers moved again for an emergency TRO and a preliminary injunction. The court denied the TRO request, but ordered briefing on the motion for preliminary injunction. But on February 23, 2022, the court denied that motion, too. 586 F.Supp.3d 136. The healthcare workers appealed the denial of a preliminary injunction on March 25, 2022.</p>\r\n<p>On April 29, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.</p>\r\n<p>On May 5, 2023, the parties filed a notice alerting the court that they had withdrawn their appeal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2023, the plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal due to the vaccine mandate having been repealed in October. The next day the court granted the dismissal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is closed.&nbsp;</p>",

The district court granted a preliminary injunction, but the court of appeals reversed.

COVID-19’s \nimpact has been particularly devastating in the healthcare sector, where already \nvulnerable  patients  and  residents  are  at  greater  risk  of  severe  harm  from  any \ninfection, and where the spread of the virus among healthcare workers can lead to a \nvicious cycle of staff shortages and deterioration of patient care. Concerns about \nCOVID-19 have also risen in recent months because of the alarming spread of the \nhighly contagious SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. \nIn light of these concerns, the New York Department of Health (DOH) issued \nan emergency rule requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for certain healthcare workers: \nnamely, any worker whose activities could potentially expose patients, residents, or \nother personnel to COVID-19 if he or she were infected. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61. Like \npreexisting vaccination requirements for measles and rubella that have been in effect \nfor decades, DOH’s emergency COVID-19 rule contains only a narrow medical exemp-\ntion. Plaintiffs here sued to challenge the absence of a religious exemption on Free \nExercise and Title VII preemption grounds. The district court granted a preliminary \ninjunction, but the Second Circuit reversed. \nPlaintiffs now ask this Court for the extraordinary relief of a stay of DOH’s \nemergency rule. This Court should deny the application. Under comparable circum-\nstances, this Court recently denied a request to enjoin a Maine regulation that also \nrequires healthcare workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccination without providing a \nreligious exemption. See Does v. Mills, No. 21A90, 2021 WL 5027177 (U.S. Oct. 29, \n\n2021). The court is also considering a similar emergency stay application in We The \nPatriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, No. 21A125, which arises from the same Second Circuit \nproceeding as this case.  \nFor the reasons given in defendants’ opposition in We The Patriots, plaintiffs \nhere fail to show an indisputably clear entitlement to relief on the merits of their Free \nExercise claim. As the Second Circuit found, nothing in this record indicates any \nhostility to or singling out of religious beliefs that would render the emergency rule \nnonneutral. Nor does the availability of a medical exemption undercut the rule’s \ngeneral applicability. The rule’s medical exemption is tightly constrained in both \nscope and duration (far more so than the medical exemption at issue in Mills), and it \nserves  rather  than  undermines  the  rule’s  objective  of  protecting  the  health  of \nhealthcare workers. For these reasons, the medical exemption is not comparable to \nthe religious exemption that plaintiffs seek, and thus does not support any inference \nthat otherwise similarly situated religious interests are being disfavored. See Br. in \nOpp. to Emergency Appl. for Writ of Inj., No. 21A125 (filed Nov. 10, 2021). \nPlaintiffs’ claim of Title VII preemption also fails to support their request for \nan emergency stay. As the Second Circuit correctly recognized, DOH’s emergency rule \ndoes not prohibit employers from providing a reasonable accommodation under Title \nVII. Plaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary assume that Title VII requires employers \nto  offer  plaintiffs  their  preferred  accommodation—an  outright  exemption  from \nvaccination. But well-settled case law makes clear that Title VII does not entitle \nemployees  to  the  accommodation  that  they  prefer;  nor  does  the  statute  compel \n  2 \n\nemployers to provide accommodations that would be unreasonable or impose an \nundue hardship, as an outright exemption would here. \nFinally, the extraordinary relief of an interim stay is not warranted because \nthis Court is unlikely to grant certiorari. There is no circuit split over the constitu-\ntionality of COVID-19 vaccination rules for healthcare workers. And the record here \nis  sparse,  especially  when  it  comes  to  concrete  evidence  about  the  anonymous \nplaintiffs, their unidentified employers, and those employers’ actual implementation \nof DOH’s emergency rule. These factors make this case a poor vehicle for reviewing \nthe issues that plaintiffs have raised.  \nSTATEMENT \nA.  New York’s Long History of Vaccination Requirements \nNew York has long been a national leader in mandating vaccinations to protect \nagainst the spread of communicable disease. The State required school-age children \nto be vaccinated against smallpox in the 1860s. See James G. Hodge, Jr. & Lawrence \nO. Gostin, School Vaccination Requirements: Historical, Social, and Legal Perspectives, \n90 Ky. L.J. 831, 851 (2002). And New York has also regularly imposed vaccination \nrequirements on healthcare workers. For example, DOH regulations require hospital \nemployees who pose a risk of transmission to patients to be immunized against \nmeasles and rubella; like the emergency rule at issue here, this requirement does not \ncontain a religious exemption. See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 405.3(b)(10)(i)-(iii). Similar rules \n  3\n\napply to healthcare workers in long-term care facilities and other institutions.1 These \nregulations have been in place in similar form since 1980 for rubella and 1991 for \nmeasles.2 \nB.  The COVID-19 Pandemic and the Development of Safe Vaccines \nCOVID-19 is a highly infectious and potentially deadly respiratory illness that \nspreads easily from person to person. In the United States alone, COVID-19 has \ninfected more than 45 million people and claimed more than 750,000 lives,3 including \nalmost 725,000 infections and over 2,400 deaths among healthcare workers,4 who \nhave been disproportionately harmed by the disease.  \nIn light of the harms caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer-\nBioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines, and the FDA granted full \n \n1  See  10  N.Y.C.R.R.  §§  415.26(c)(1)(v)(a)(2)-(4)  (nursing  home  personnel), \n751.6(d)(1)-(3)  (employees  of  diagnostic  and  treatment  centers),  763.13(c)(1)-(3) \n(personnel of home health agencies, long term home health care programs, and AIDS \nhome  care  programs),  766.11(d)(1)-(3)  (personnel  of  licensed  home  care  services \nagencies), 794.3(d)(1)-(3) (hospice personnel), 1001.11(q)(1)-(3) (assisted living resi-\ndences personnel). \n2 See Health and Immunization of Employees of Medical Facilities and Certified \nHome Health Agencies, 3 N.Y. Reg. 6, 6 (Jan. 14, 1981) (rubella); Immunization of \nHealth Care Workers, 13 N.Y. Reg. 16, 16 (Dec. 24, 1991) (measles). \n3 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, COVID Data Tracker: Trends in \nNumber of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the US Reported to CDC, by State/ \nTerritory.

For example, among adults 65 to 74 years old, one \nrecent study showed the vaccines’ efficacy for preventing hospitalizations ranged \nfrom 84% to 96%, and concluded that increasing vaccination coverage is “critical to \nreducing the risk for COVID-19–related hospitalization, particularly in older adults.”6 \nThe COVID-19 vaccines do not contain aborted fetal cells. HEK-293 cells—\nwhich are currently grown in a laboratory and are thousands of generations removed \nfrom cells collected from a fetus in 1973—were used in testing during the research \nand development phase of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.7 But the use of fetal cell \nlines for testing is common, including for the rubella vaccination, which New York’s \nhealthcare workers are already required to take.8 A diverse range of religious leaders \nhas strongly encouraged adherents to receive a COVID-19 vaccination.

New York’s Response to Transmission of the Delta Variant \nin the Healthcare Sector \nDOH  is  charged  with  protecting  the  public  health  and  supervising  and \nregulating “the sanitary aspects of . . . businesses and activities affecting public \nhealth.” N.Y. Public Health Law § 201(1)(m). Pursuant to this broad mandate, DOH \n \n9 Devin Watkins, Pope Francis Urges People to Get Vaccinated Against Covid-\n19, Vatican News (Aug. 18, 2021) (quotation marks omitted). \n10 Chairmen of the Comm. on Doctrine and the Comm. on Pro-Life Activities, \nU.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops, Moral Considerations Regarding the New COVID-19 \nVaccines 4-5 (Dec. 11, 2020). \n11  Press  Release,  ReliefWeb,  World  Religious  Leaders  Call  for  Massive \nIncreases in Production of Covid Vaccines and End to Vaccine Nationalism (Apr. 27, \n2021) (quotation marks omitted). \n  6 \n\nhas acted swiftly to respond to the risks posed by the Delta variant in New York’s \nhealthcare sector.  \nOn August 18, 2021—prior to full FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine—the \nDOH Commissioner issued an Order for Summary Action under Public Health Law \n§ 16, which allows him to “take certain action immediately” to remedy “a condition or \nactivity which in his opinion constitutes danger to the health of the people,” for a \nperiod not to exceed fifteen days. Public Health Law § 16. The Order required limited \ncategories  of  healthcare  entities—hospitals  and  nursing  homes—to  ensure  that \ncovered personnel were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. (App. 99-105.) The Order \nalso included both a medical exemption and an exemption for individuals who hold a \n“religious belief contrary to the practice of immunization, subject to a reasonable \naccommodation by the employer.” (App. 103-104.) The Order was not intended to be \na permanent solution, but rather served as an immediate “stop-gap measure pending \naction by the Public Health and Health Planning Council,” a council within DOH that \nconsists of the Commissioner and 24 other members drawn from the public health \nsystem, healthcare providers, and elsewhere.12  \nAs a result, the Order was superseded when, eight days later on August 26, \n2021—three days after the FDA gave full approval to the Pfizer vaccine—the Council \napproved the emergency rule that is at issue in this proceeding with the benefit of \nfuller consideration and input by its members. Under New York law, an emergency \n \n12 Decl. of Vanessa Murphy, J.D., M.P.H. (“Murphy Decl.”) ¶ 6, Does v. Hochul, \nNo. 21-cv-5067 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2021), ECF No. 48. \n  7 \n\nrule may go into effect immediately and remain in effect for up to ninety days. N.Y. \nState Administrative Procedure Act § 202(6)(b). The emergency rule requires covered \nhealthcare entities to “continuously require” employees to be fully vaccinated against \nCOVID-19 if they “engage in activities such that if they were infected with COVID-19, \nthey could potentially expose other covered personnel, patients or residents to the \ndisease.” 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61(a)(2), (c). In contrast to the Commissioner’s Order, the \nemergency rule covers a broader range of healthcare entities—specifically, extending \nto certified home health agencies, long term home health care programs, hospices, \nand adult care facilities, among others. § 2.61(a)(1)(ii)-(iv). Also, unlike the Order, the \nemergency  rule  was  formally  published  in  the  New  York  Register  and  was \naccompanied by a full set of required documentation, including a Regulatory Impact \nStatement and findings to support the need for emergency action. See Prevention of \nCOVID-19 Transmission by Covered Entities, 43 N.Y. Reg. 6, 6-9 (Sept. 15, 2021). \nThe rule contains only a single exception to its requirements: a narrow medical \nexemption that is strictly limited in duration and scope. The rule exempts employees \nfor whom a “COVID-19 vaccine [would be] detrimental to [their] health . . . based \nupon a pre-existing health condition.” § 2.61(d)(1). As to duration, the exemption \napplies “only until such immunization is found no longer to be detrimental to such \npersonnel member’s health,” and that duration “must be stated in the personnel \nemployment medical record.” Id. As to scope, the exemption must be “in accordance \nwith generally accepted medical standards,” such as the “recommendations of the \n  8 \n\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices” (ACIP), a committee that operates \nunder the auspices of the CDC. Id. \nDOH guidance on the emergency rule makes clear that the available grounds \nfor a medical exemption are narrow and largely temporary. As explained by DOH’s \nFrequently Asked Questions document regarding the emergency rule,13 the only \n“contraindications” recognized by the CDC as a ground for a medical exemption from \nCOVID-19 vaccination are severe or immediate allergic reactions “after a previous \ndose” of the vaccine or “to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine.”14 Even then, the \nCDC  advises  that  “the  majority  of  contraindications  are  temporary,”  such  that \n“vaccinations  often  can  be  administered  later  when  the  condition  leading  to  a \ncontraindication no longer exists.”15 The CDC also recognizes certain “precautions”—\ni.e., conditions that increase the risk of a serious reaction or that interfere with the \neffectiveness  of  a  vaccine—that  could  warrant  deferring  administration  of  the \nCOVID-19 vaccine (such as a recent acute illness), or administering a different version \nof the vaccine (such as a reaction to one of the three available vaccines).16 By contrast, \n \n13 N.Y.

Data show \nthat the vaccines do not present “immediate health issues or side effects for most \npeople with pre-existing medication conditions,” and, apart from age, “there are no \nmajor exemptions that cover large groups of people.”17 The vaccines are safe for \nimmunocompromised people, pregnant women, and people with underlying condi-\ntions.

The availability of a medical but not \nreligious exemption is also a feature of the requirement that healthcare workers be \nvaccinated against measles and rubella. DOH has explained that the emergency rule \nis  consistent  with  these  preexisting  obligations  and  that  allowing  a  religious \nexemption  for  the  COVID-19  vaccine,  but  not  for  measles  and  rubella,  would \nundermine a consistent approach to preventing the transmission of these particularly \ninfectious and harmful diseases in the healthcare sector.19 The decision to omit a \nreligious  exemption  is  consistent  with  statements  by  the  American  Medical \nAssociation that nonmedical exemptions “endanger the health of the unvaccinated \nindividual and those whom the individual comes in contact with,” and that healthcare \nworkers in particular “have a fundamental obligation to patients [to get] vaccinated \nfor preventable diseases.”20 \nIn accompanying administrative materials, DOH further explained the basis \nfor the emergency rule. It noted that the rule responded to the increasing circulation \nof the Delta variant, which had led to a tenfold increase in COVID-19 infections since \nearly July 2021. DOH found that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and that \nthe presence of unvaccinated personnel in healthcare settings poses “an unacceptably \n \n19 See Rausch-Phung Decl. ¶¶ 46-52. \n20 American Med.

DOH emphasized that unvaccinated individuals have eleven times the risk \nas vaccinated individuals of being hospitalized with COVID-19. \nThe  Council  also  conducted  a  meeting  on  August  26,  2021,  at  which  it \nconsidered further information concerning the need for the emergency rule and the \nscope  of  the  obligations  it  imposed.  DOH’s  Commissioner  explained  that  the \nemergency rule was necessary because the State was at a crucial inflection point with \nthe increasing prevalence of the Delta variant and the heightened risk for the spread \nof other respiratory viruses (such as the flu) in the fall season.21 DOH counsel further \nexplained that the scope of the emergency rule largely tracked preexisting vaccine \nrequirements, including those for measles and rubella, in order to facilitate the rule’s \nimplementation and enforcement. For example, the definition of “covered personnel” \naligns with the scope of DOH’s regulation requiring seasonal influenza vaccination \nor masking for certain healthcare workers. Comm. Meeting at 10:40-11:12; see 10 \nN.Y.C.R.R. § 2.59(a)(1). Counsel similarly noted that the medical exemption is consis-\ntent  with  the  existing  standards  governing  immunizations  for  students.

Id. at 37:20-37:38.  \nDOH’s findings about the immediate necessity for the emergency rule are \nsupported by the CDC’s conclusions that the Delta variant is more than twice as \ncontagious as prior variants and may cause more severe illness in unvaccinated \npeople. Although vaccinated people may transmit the Delta variant to others, they do \nso at much lower rates than unvaccinated people.22 The CDC has also recognized the \nimportance of achieving high vaccination rates in settings where residents are at high \nrisk of COVID-19-associated mortality, including long-term care facilities. Deaths at \nsuch facilities account for almost one third of COVID-19 related deaths in the United \nStates, and the CDC has observed outbreaks that occurred in facilities where the \n“residents were highly vaccinated, but transmission occurred through unvaccinated \nstaff members.”23 \n \n22 See Rausch-Phung Decl. ¶¶ 8-12; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, \nDelta Variant: What We Know About the Science (Aug. 26, 2021); Centers for Disease \nControl & Prevention, Science Brief: COVID-19 Vaccines and Vaccination (Sept. 15, \n2021). \n23 See Rausch-Phung Decl. ¶ 62; James T.

Rep. 1036, 1036-37 (2021). \n  13 \n\nSince the emergency rule went into effect on September 27, 2021, DOH has \ncollected preliminary data concerning the rate of vaccinations and exemptions among \nNew York’s healthcare workforce as of October 19, 2021. Because the rule has been \nsubject  to  limited  temporary  restraining  orders  (TROs)  preventing  DOH  from \ninterfering with employers’ grants of religious exemptions, this data includes some \ninformation about religious exemptions. \nIn the nursing home sector, 127,822 of 144,183 workers were fully vaccinated \n(88.7%), 12,569 had received one dose of a two-dose vaccine (8.7%), 538 were reported \nas currently medically ineligible for a COVID-19 vaccine (0.4%), and 2,680 were \nreported  as  “other”  exemptions  (1.9%),  which  DOH  understands  to  refer  to  the \nreligious  exemption  preserved  by  the  various  TROs  (since  no  other  nonmedical \nexemptions  are  permitted).24  In  the  adult  care  facility  sector,  26,449  of  29,583 \nworkers were fully vaccinated (89.4%), 2,166 had received one dose of a two-dose \nvaccine (7.3%), 155 were reported as currently medically ineligible for a COVID-19 \nvaccine (0.5%), and 567 were reported as “other” (religious) exemptions (1.9%).25 In \nthe hospital sector, 91.4% of workers were fully vaccinated, 4.8% had received one \ndose of a two-dose vaccine, 0.5% were medically ineligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, \nand 1.3% were reported as “other” (religious) exemptions.26  \n \n24 See Decl. of Valerie A.

Mills, 16 F.4th 20, 26 (1st Cir. 2021) (noting disparities in \n“geographic  distribution  of  vaccination”  within  Maine).  In  Erie  County,  only  41 \nhospital workers (0.2%) were currently medically ineligible, while 740 (4%) reported \n“other”  (religious)  exemptions.

Procedural History \nOn September 13, 2021, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit, challenging the omission \nof a religious exemption from DOH’s emergency rule. The plaintiffs are seventeen \nanonymous healthcare workers allegedly subject to the emergency rule. (App. 135, \n146-172.)  \nPlaintiffs, all but one of whom identify as Catholics,28 allege that they have \nreligious objections to receiving vaccines that use “aborted fetus cell lines in their \ntesting, development, or production” (App. 135; see App. 143-146). Plaintiffs allege \nthat if they do not take the COVID-19 vaccine they will face various employment \nconsequences, risk disciplinary charges, or lose their licenses.29 (See, e.g., App. 138-\n \n27 See Persico Decl. ¶¶ 4-5. \n28 One plaintiff identifies as a Baptist. (App. 158.) \n29 Plaintiffs allege a diverse range of potential employment consequences. \nSome allege direct loss of employment. Others allege that they will be unable to \ncontinue their practices if their “hospital privileges [are] suspended.” (See App. 152-\n(continued on the next page) \n  15 \n\n143, 155, 159, 163, 168, 171-172.) Plaintiffs do not identify themselves or their \nemployers. They claim that the DOH emergency rule violates their right to free \nexercise of religion and is preempted by Title VII. (See App. 172-180.) They seek \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. (See App. 180.) \nPlaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a preliminary \ninjunction that same day. Plaintiffs did not submit any evidence with that motion. The \ndistrict court granted a TRO without hearing from defendants. (App. 56-60.) On \nOctober  12,  2021,  the  district  court  granted  plaintiffs’  motion  for  a  preliminary \ninjunction. (See App. 62-88)  \nOn October 29, 2021, the Second Circuit issued an order that vacated the \npreliminary injunction and reversed the trial court’s order granting a preliminary \ninjunction, with an opinion to follow. (App. 2-3.) On November 4, 2021, the Second \nCircuit issued its written decision. (See App. 4-54; We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. \nHochul, No. 21-2179, 2021 WL 5121983 (2d Cir. Nov. 4, 2021) (“WTP, at *__”).)30  \nOn plaintiffs’ Free Exercise claim, the court held that plaintiffs had failed to \nshow that DOH’s emergency rule was “likely not neutral or generally applicable.” \n(App. 24; WTP, at *8.) The court explained that the rule “is facially neutral because \nit does not single out employees who decline vaccination on religious grounds.” (Id.) \nAnd  the  court  rejected  plaintiffs’  contention  that  the  rule  should  be  deemed \n \n154, 157, 164, 169.) Others allege that they were told that their employment would \nbe at risk if they do not receive a COVID-19 vaccination. (See App. 160, 166.) \n30 The order and written decision also resolved the companion We The Patriots \nappeal.   \n  16 \n\nnonneutral  because  it  “eliminated”  a  religious  exemption  contained  in  the \nCommissioner’s separate August 18 Order issued just eight days earlier, explaining \nthat the rule was issued by different decision-makers, following a distinct procedure \nthat “provided more process, public input, and support for a measure that would be \neffective” for a different duration. (App. 26; WTP, at *9.) As for public statements made \nby Governor Hochul that plaintiffs assert reflected animus, the court noted that many \nof those comments “did not relate to Section 2.61 or workplace vaccine requirements \nat all,” and that the Governor’s “expression of her own religious belief as a moral \nimperative to become vaccinated cannot reasonably be understood to imply an intent \non the part of the State to target those with religious beliefs contrary to hers.” (App. \n27-28; WTP, at *10.) Otherwise, “politicians’ frequent use of religious rhetoric to \nsupport their positions” would trigger heightened scrutiny for many government \nactions. (App. 27-28; WTP, at *10.)  \nThe Second Circuit also concluded that the rule is likely generally applicable. \nThe medical exemption did not render the rule underinclusive because “applying the \nvaccination requirement to individuals with medical contraindications and precau-\ntions would not effectively advance” the State’s interest in promoting the health of \nhealthcare workers to reduce the risk of staffing shortages. (App. 31; WTP, at *12.) \nThe court also held that the evidence before it showed that the risks of a medical \nexemption and a religious exemption are not comparable. The “medical exemption is \ndefined to be limited in duration,” and “[t]he statistics provided by the State further \nindicate that medical exemptions are likely to be more limited in number than \n  17 \n\nreligious exemptions, and that high numbers of religious exemptions appear to be \nclustered in particular geographic areas.” (App. 31-32; WTP, at *12.) The court also \nconcluded that the medical exemption does not create a mechanism for individualized \nexemptions because it applies to “an objectively defined category of people” and \n“affords no meaningful discretion to the State or employers.” (App. 37-38; WTP, at \n*14.)  \nAs a neutral law of general applicability, the Second Circuit assessed the rule \nunder rational-basis review, and it concluded that the rule was a rational response to \nthe spread of “an especially contagious variant of the virus in the midst of a pandemic \nthat has now claimed the lives of over 750,000 in the United States and some 55,000 \nin New York.” (App. 39; WTP, at *15.) \nThe  Second  Circuit  also  rejected  plaintiffs’  claim  based  on  Title  VII \npreemption. The court explained that “Section 2.61 does not require employers to \nviolate Title VII because, although it bars an employer from granting a religious \nexemption from the vaccination requirement, it does not prevent employees from \nseeking a religious accommodation allowing them to continue working consistent \nwith the Rule, while avoiding the vaccination requirement.” (App. 42; WTP, at *17.) \nThe court also recognized that “Title VII does not require covered entities to provide \nthe accommodation that Plaintiffs prefer—in this case, a blanket religious exemption \nallowing them to continue working at their current positions unvaccinated.” (Id.) And \nthe  court  further  held  that  the  sparse  record  precluded  any  inference  that  the \nanonymous  plaintiffs’  unidentified  employers  would  be  unable  to  provide  any \n  18 \n\nreasonable accommodation consistent with the emergency rule.31 (App. 43; WTP, at \n*17.) \nFinally, the Second Circuit concluded that plaintiffs had also failed to show \nirreparable injury or a balance of the equities supporting a preliminary injunction, \nbut noted that factual developments on remand might affect both of these factors. \n(App. 45-50; WTP, at *19-21.) \nARGUMENT \nTHE COURT SHOULD DENY PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR \nTHE EXTRAORDINARY RELIEF OF AN INTERIM STAY  \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin the enforcement of a duly issued emergency \nstate health regulation—“extraordinary relief” that “‘does not simply suspend judicial \nalteration of the status quo but grants judicial intervention that has been withheld \nby lower courts.’” Respect Me. PAC v. McKee, 562 U.S. 996, 996 (2010) (quoting Ohio \nCitizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U.S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (Scalia, J., \nin chambers)). Such drastic relief is issued “sparingly and only in the most critical \nand exigent circumstances,” such as when “the legal rights at issue are indisputably \nclear.” Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. v. Federal Election Comm’n, 542 U.S. 1305, 1306 \n(2004) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers) (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs do not \ncome close to satisfying this stringent standard here. \n \n31 The Second Circuit also rejected a substantive due process claim brought by \nplaintiffs in the We The Patriots action. (See App. 44-45; WTP, at *18.) Plaintiffs here \ndid not bring such a claim.  \n  19 \n\nA.  This Court Is Unlikely to Grant Certiorari. \nThis  Court’s  assessment  of  plaintiffs’  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits \nencompasses “a discretionary judgment about whether the Court should grant review \nin this case.” Does v. Mills, No. 21A90, 2021 WL 5027177, at *1 (U.S. Oct. 29, 2021) \n(Barrett,  J.,  concurring);  see  Hollingsworth  v.  Perry,  558  U.S.  183,  190  (2010). \nPlaintiffs have failed to establish that this lawsuit is an appropriate vehicle to resolve \nthe issues for which they seek review.  \nFor one thing, there is no circuit split over the constitutionality of COVID-19 \nvaccination requirements for healthcare workers. The only other court of appeals to \nhave addressed such a rule upheld it on grounds similar to those given by the Second \nCircuit below. See Mills, 16 F.4th 20. And plaintiffs are wrong to identify a conflict \n(see Emergency Appl. for Writ of Inj. at 37 (“Br. at”)) with the Sixth Circuit’s decision \nupholding a preliminary injunction against a university’s COVID-19 vaccination \nrequirement for student-athletes. See Dahl v. Board of Trs. of W. Mich. Univ., 15 \nF.4th 728 (6th Cir. 2021) (per curiam). That case involved “a factual setting signifi-\ncantly  different  from  that  presented  here”:  namely,  a  scheme  under  which  the \nuniversity’s grant of exemptions was subject to no meaningful standards. (App. 38-\n39, WTP, at *15 n.29.) No similar discretionary exemption scheme is at issue here. \nSee infra at 24.  \nThis case also provides a poor vehicle because, as the Second Circuit repeatedly \nnoted, the “record before the district court[] was sparse.” (App. 35; WTP, at *14.) In \nparticular, for purposes of plaintiffs’ Title VII preemption claim, there was little to no \n  20 \n\nconcrete evidence “in support of their broad allegations about the effect of Section \n2.61” on their employment. (App. 43; WTP, at *17.) For example, plaintiffs provided \nno documentation below about whether they have sought or been offered accommo-\ndations that would be consistent with the emergency rule—facts that would be \nespecially  important  for  evaluating  their  claim  that  the  emergency  rule  wholly \nprohibits accommodations required by Title VII. Plaintiffs object that their factual \nallegations “must be accepted as true.” (Br. at 32 n.32 (quotation marks omitted).) \nBut the problem here is not that plaintiffs’ factual claims are disputed—it is that they \nare incomplete. There are thus important factual questions material to plaintiffs’ \nTitle VII claim that are addressed neither by plaintiffs’ allegations nor by the record \nbelow, such as “the substance of Plaintiffs’ interactions with their employers,” “the \nopportunities for a reasonable accommodation under Title VII for religious objectors,” \nand the availability of “accommodations for the medically ineligible.” (App. 43; WTP, \nat *17.)  \nFor these reasons, this Court should reject plaintiffs’ invitation to “use the \nemergency docket to force the Court to give a merits preview in cases that it would \nbe unlikely to take—and to do so on a short fuse without benefit of full briefing and \noral argument.” Mills, 2021 WL 5027177, at *1 (Barrett, J., concurring). \nB.  Plaintiffs Have Not Shown an Indisputably Clear Right to Relief. \nPlaintiffs’ request for relief should also be denied because they have failed to \nmake a “strong showing” of likely success on the merits of their appeal, see Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009) (quotation marks omitted), let alone an “indisputably \n  21 \n\nclear” constitutional violation, Wisconsin Right to Life, 542 U.S. at 1306 (Rehnquist, \nC.J., in chambers) (quotation marks omitted).  \n1.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their \nFree Exercise claim. \nUnder  this  Court’s  precedents,  “laws  incidentally  burdening  religion  are \nordinarily not subject to strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause so long as \nthey are neutral and generally applicable.” Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. \n1868, 1876 (2021). This Court has specifically identified “compulsory vaccination laws” \nas among the neutral, generally applicable laws that do not require religious exemp-\ntions under the First Amendment. Employment Div., Dep’t of Human Res. of Ore. v. \nSmith, 494 U.S. 872, 889 (1990). Here, as the Second Circuit correctly held, plaintiffs’ \nFree Exercise claim fails because DOH’s emergency rule is a neutral law of general \napplicability that is subject to rational-basis review—a bar that it readily clears.  \nPlaintiffs’ arguments to the contrary here largely parallel those made by the \nplaintiffs in We The Patriots and should be rejected for the reasons already given by \ndefendants in their opposition to the We The Patriots stay application. See Br. in Opp. \nto Emergency Appl. for Writ of Inj. 21-34, No. 21A125 (“WTP Opp.”). Rather than \nrehash those arguments, defendants here respond to certain specific points raised by \nplaintiffs.  \nFirst, plaintiffs assert that DOH’s emergency rule is not generally applicable \nbecause  its  “medical  exemption  treats  comparable  secular  conduct  better  than \nreligious conduct.” (Br. at 16.) As defendants have previously explained, however, the \n  22 \n\nmedical  exemption  is  not  comparable  to  the  religious  exemption  requested  by \nplaintiffs. The medical exemption advances rather than undermines one of the core \npurposes of the emergency rule (to protect healthcare workers themselves); it is \nextremely  limited  in  both  scope  and  duration  (and  narrower  than  the  medical \nexemption in the Maine regulation considered in Mills); and preliminary data shows \nthat it allows significantly fewer unvaccinated individuals than a religious exemption \nwould, thus limiting the medical exemption’s impact. See WTP Opp. at 28-31. \nPlaintiffs counter that “an unvaccinated employee carries the same risk of \nCOVID spread regardless of their reasons for remaining unvaccinated” (Br. at 17), \nbut they are incorrect. As defendants have explained (WTP Opp. at 29-30), because \nthe most significant contraindication that would warrant a medical exemption is an \nadverse reaction to a prior dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, many of the workers who \nreceive medical exemptions will already have received at least partial protection from \nthat first vaccine dose. Moreover, because medical exemptions are predominantly \ntemporary (WTP Opp. at 30-31), the amount of time that a medically ineligible \nindividual poses a risk of spreading COVID-19 is also correspondingly limited. And \nfinally, plaintiffs are wrong to dismiss the relevance (Br. at 17-18) of the significantly \nhigher numbers of exemptions that will be offered on religious rather than medical \ngrounds—three to four times more statewide (WTP Opp. at 13-14), and up to twenty-\nthree times more in certain jurisdictions (see App. 32; WTP, at *12). There is thus no \nbasis  to  find  that  the  tightly  constrained  medical  exemption  “undermines  the \npurposes of the [emergency rule] to at least the same degree as the covered conduct \n  23 \n\nthat is religiously motivated.” Blackhawk v. Pennsylvania, 381 F.3d 202, 209 (3d Cir. \n2004). \nSecond, plaintiffs contend that the medical exemption renders the emergency \nrule the type of discretionary exemption scheme that this Court has found not to be \ngenerally applicable. (Br. at 18-19.) But as defendants previously explained (WTP \nOpp. at 25-26), and the Second Circuit correctly concluded, the “medical exemption \nhere does not ‘invite the government to decide which reasons for not complying with \nthe policy are worthy of solicitude.’” (App. 37; WTP, at *14 (quoting Fulton, 141 S. Ct. \nat 1879).) “Instead, the Rule provides for an objectively defined category of people to \nwhom the vaccine requirement does not apply.” (Id.) Thus, “[o]n its face, the Rule \naffords no meaningful discretion to the State or employers, and Plaintiffs have not \nput forth any evidence suggesting otherwise.” (App. 38; WTP, at *14.) In sharp \ncontrast, the scheme at issue in Fulton authorized a state official to issue exemptions \nat his or her “sole discretion.” 141 S. Ct. at 1878. And, as Smith explained, the \nprogram at issue in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), allowed exceptions for \n“good cause,” which was an undefined standard under that scheme. 494 U.S. at 884. \nThird, plaintiffs contend that DOH’s emergency rule “targeted religion”—and \nthus was not neutral—because it “removed an existing religious exemption while \nbroadening  the  medical  exemption.”  (Br.  at  19.)  But  both  aspects  of  plaintiffs’ \ncharacterization of the rule are wrong. The emergency rule did not “remove[] an \nexisting  religious  exemption,”  an  apparent  reference  to  the  religious  exemption \ncontained in the Commissioner’s earlier August 18 Order for Summary Action. (App. \n  24 \n\n99-105.) As defendants have explained (WTP Opp. at 22-23), the emergency rule was \nnot an amendment to the Commissioner’s Order at all, but rather the product of an \nindependent rulemaking process. It is also simply not true that the emergency rule \n“broaden[ed] the medical exemption.” To support this characterization, plaintiffs \npoint (Br. at 7) to immaterial wording changes between the Commissioner’s August \n18 Order and the emergency rule.32 But those changes did not (and were not intended \nto) alter the scope of the medical exemption, whose operative language parallels that \nin  the  similar  exemption  for  the  longstanding  measles/rubella  vaccination \nrequirements. See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 405.3(b)(10)(iii). \nPlaintiffs further argue that the emergency rule is nonneutral because, after \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  decision  below,  some  of  their  employers  revoked  religious \nexemptions that they had previously granted. (Br. at 20.) As an initial matter, \nplaintiffs’  assertion  that  their  employers  targeted  religion  in  making  employee-\nspecific decisions does not mean that DOH did so as well in issuing a statewide \nemergency rule. More fundamentally, even as alleged, the employers’ actions did not \n“single  out  the  religious  for  disfavored  treatment,”  Trinity  Lutheran  Church  of \nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2020 (2017), but rather treated claims for \nreligious exemptions the same as any other type of claim for an exemption—with the \n \n32 For example, plaintiffs point out (Br. at 7) that the August 18 Order provided \nthat the COVID-19 vaccination requirement “shall be subject to a reasonable accom-\nmodation” for medically ineligible staff (App. 103), while the emergency rule says that \nthe requirement “shall be inapplicable,” § 2.61(d)(1). But plaintiffs fail to note that \nthe emergency rule goes on to talk specifically about providing and documenting “any \nreasonable accommodation.”  \n  25 \n\nsole  exception  of  the  narrow  medical  exemption,  which  is  unique  for  reasons \npreviously explained (WTP Opp. at 28-31).  \nFourth, plaintiffs assert that various statements by Governor Hochul “reflected \nantipathy toward religious objectors.” (Br. at 21.) But as defendants have explained \n(WTP  Opp.  at  24),  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  establish  any  nexus  between  these \nstatements and DOH’s issuance of this emergency rule. The quoted statements were \nall made weeks after the emergency rule was adopted, and none of them came from \nthe actual decision-makers who actually considered and issued the rule (the DOH \nCommissioner and twenty-four members of the Public Health and Health Planning \nCouncil). Many of the Governor’s statements were also not about the emergency rule \nor healthcare workers at all, but instead were broader calls for the public to become \nvaccinated.  (App.  27-28;  WTP,  at  *10.)  And  despite  plaintiffs’  attempt  to  argue \notherwise, the full context of the Governor’s statements reveals that she was speaking \npositively about religion, rather than disparaging religious beliefs: that is, she was \n“express[ing] general support for religious principles that she believes guide commu-\nnity members to care for one another by receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.” (App. 28-\n29; WTP, at *10.) This Court’s concerns about state officials’ declarations of religious \nhostility are simply not triggered when, as here, a state official invokes her own \npersonal religious beliefs to support public policy; “otherwise, politicians’ frequent use \nof religious rhetoric to support their positions would render many government actions \nnon-neutral.” (App. 28; WTP, at *10. (quotation marks omitted).)  \n  26 \n\nFinally, plaintiffs claim that DOH’s emergency rule does not satisfy strict \nscrutiny. (Br. at 25.) At the outset, that argument fails because strict scrutiny does \nnot apply, and the rule easily satisfies rational-basis review, as plaintiffs do not \ncontest. (WTP Opp. at 32-34.) But plaintiffs’ arguments under strict scrutiny also fail \non their own terms. \nPlaintiffs principally argue that DOH has failed to show narrow tailoring \nbecause New York is “a national outlier” (Br. at 25) in not allowing religious exemp-\ntions. That claim is an overstatement. Both Maine and Rhode Island have similarly \nrequired healthcare workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccination without providing a \nreligious exemption. See Mills, 16 F.4th at 24; Dr. T. v. Alexander-Scott, No. 21-cv-\n387, 2021 WL 4476784, at *1 (D.R.I. Sept. 30, 2021). And in the context of mandatory \nvaccination requirements for schoolchildren, many States in addition to New York no \nlonger  allow  for  religious  exemptions,  including  California,  Connecticut,  Maine, \nMississippi, and West Virginia.33 Indeed, the Fourth Circuit rejected a Free Exercise \nchallenge to West Virginia’s mandatory childhood vaccination statute, which, like \nDOH’s emergency rule, recognized only medical but not religious exemptions. See \nWorkman v. Mingo Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 419 F. App’x 348, 353-54 (4th Cir. 2011); see \nalso F.F. v. State, 194 A.D.3d 80, 88 (3d Dep’t) (rejecting Free Exercise challenge to \n \n33 See Cal. Health & Safety Code § 120325 et seq. (Westlaw 2021); Conn. Gen. \nStat. Ann. § 10-204a (Westlaw 2021); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, § 6355 (Westlaw \n2021); Miss. Code Ann. § 41-23-37 (Westlaw 2021); W. Va. Code Ann. § 16-3-4 \n(Westlaw 2021). \n  27 \n\nremoval of religious exemption for schoolchildren), appeal dismissed & lv. denied, 37 \nN.Y.3d 1040 (2021). \nMore fundamentally, DOH was not obligated to follow the choices of other \nStates that have allowed religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination require-\nments. “It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous \nstate may” chart its own course and depart from the policies of other States. New \nState Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). And \nstate public health officials have the greatest latitude when, as here, there remains \nsignificant  uncertainty  about  the  best  manner  of  responding  to  a  devastating \ninfectious disease. As plaintiffs acknowledge (Br. at 26-27), States have taken a wide \nvariety  of  approaches  to  COVID-19,  with  some  requiring  vaccinations  (among \nhealthcare workers or other populations), and others going in the opposite direction \nand prohibiting vaccination requirements. See In re State, No. 21-873, 2021 WL \n4785741, at *1 (Tex. Oct. 14, 2021). Strict scrutiny does not constrain States to adopt \nthe lowest-common-denominator policy of their fellow States. Cf. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 \nU.S. 520, 554 (1979) (“the Due Process Clause does not mandate a ‘lowest common \ndenominator’  security  standard,  whereby  a  practice  permitted  at  one  penal \ninstitution must be permitted at all institutions”). And when, as here, policymakers \n“undertake[] to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties . . . \ncourts should be cautious” not to override those expert judgments based on their own \nlitigation-driven view of the facts. Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974).  \n  28 \n\nIn any event, New York’s unique experience with COVID-19 would justify even \na truly unique approach to protecting the healthcare sector here. New York bore the \nbrunt of the initial wave of COVID-19, which tore through New York City in March \nand April 2020. As an amicus observed below, “[d]uring the first wave, healthcare \nworkers were much more likely to contract the virus than the general population,” \nand “[r]ates of infection and death were highest among frontline staff, such as nurses \nand physicians.” Br. for Amicus Curiae Greater N.Y. Hosp. Ass’n in Supp. of Defs.-\nAppellees at 3, CA2 No. 21-2179, ECF No. 124. Given New York’s experience at the \nforefront of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, it is entirely \nunsurprising that New York would be a leader in mandating COVID-19 vaccinations \nfor all healthcare workers medically eligible to receive one. \n2.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their Title VII \npreemption claim. \na. Plaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed on their claim invoking Title VII \nbecause they have failed to show the type of irreconcilable conflict between Title VII \nand DOH’s emergency rule that would be necessary to establish federal preemption. \nBeyond the ordinary presumption against preemption, see Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 \nU.S. 452, 460-61 (1991), in enacting Title VII, Congress included two provisions \nexplicitly  disclaiming  “any  intent  categorically  to  pre-empt  state  law”;  those \nprovisions “severely limit Title VII’s pre-emptive effect.” California Fed. Sav. & Loan \nAss’n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 281, 282 (1987) (op. of Marshall, J.). Congress provided \nthat the Civil Rights Act as a whole should not be construed “as indicating an intent \n  29 \n\non the part of Congress to occupy the field” in which any title operates. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000h-4. And Title VII specifically does not “exempt or relieve any person from any \nliability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law of any \nState”—except in the limited circumstance where a state law “require[s] or permit[s] \nthe doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice,” and thus \nresults in an actual conflict with Title VII. Id. § 2000e-7. Plaintiffs have failed to show \nthat the DOH emergency rule conflicts with federal law under these standards. \nFirst, plaintiffs’ Title VII claim rests on the erroneous factual premise that the \nemergency rule implements a “categorical ban on religious accommodations.” (Br. at \n29.) The Second Circuit correctly rejected this premise, explaining that the rule “does \nnot prevent employees from seeking a religious accommodation allowing them to \ncontinue  working  consistent  with  the  Rule,  while  avoiding  the  vaccination \nrequirement.” (App. 42; WTP, at *17; cf. Mills, 16 F.4th at 28 (reaching similar \nconclusion regarding Maine’s rule).) Specifically, because the rule applies only to \npersonnel “who engage in activities such that if they were infected with COVID-19, \nthey could potentially expose other covered personnel, patients or residents to the \ndisease,” 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61(a)(2), nothing in the rule bars employees from being \nreassigned to activities that would not be covered by this language, such as remote \nwork.  \nPlaintiffs argue that the emergency rule precludes employers from offering the \nparticular  accommodation  that  they  would  prefer—namely,  continuing  “physical \ncontact with patients or other employees” despite being unvaccinated. (Br. at 31.) But \n  30 \n\nTitle VII does not require that employees receive their preferred accommodation; \nrather, “any reasonable accommodation by the employer is sufficient to meet its \naccommodation obligation.” Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 68 (1986); \nsee also Cosme v. Henderson, 287 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir. 2002). And on this threadbare \nrecord, plaintiffs have not established whether they have requested (or whether their \nemployers  can  make  available)  reassignments  or  other  adjustments  that  would \nremove them from the scope of the emergency rule and allow them to continue \nworking  without  exposing  other  personnel,  patients,  or  residents  to  COVID-19. \nAlthough plaintiffs sometimes assume that any such accommodation is categorically \nunavailable (see, e.g., Br. at 32 n.30), their own allegations suggest otherwise: for \nexample, at least one plaintiff “has been 100% remote for the past 18 months” (App. \n171),  work  that  would  appear  to  be  outside  the  scope  of  the  emergency  rule. \n“[W]ithout any data in the record,” the court below properly “decline[d] to draw any \nconclusion  about  the  availability  of  reasonable  accommodation  based  solely  on \nsurmise and speculation.” (App. 43; WTP, at *17.)  \nThe record is equally devoid of any evidence to support plaintiffs’ assertion (Br. \nat 31-32) that their employers are offering accommodations to employees with medical \nexemptions while denying comparable accommodations to employees with religious \nobjections to the COVID-19 vaccines. As this Court has recognized, such claims of \ndiscriminatory  accommodation  policies  “turn[]  on  factual  inquiry  into  past  and \npresent administration” of accommodations by particular employers. Ansonia Bd. of \nEduc, 479 U.S. at 70. But here, no employers are identified; there is no evidence of \n  31 \n\n“Plaintiffs’ interactions with their employers” or their employers’ accommodations for \nmedically ineligible employees (App. 43; WTP, at *17); and the emergency rule itself \ndoes not dictate any particular accommodations, see § 2.61(d)(1). As the Second Circuit \ncorrectly noted, “the Rule does not prevent healthcare entities from taking additional \nprecautions to minimize the transmission risk posed by medically exempt employees” \nbeyond simply requiring personal protective equipment (App. 43; WTP, at *17 n.33), \nand plaintiffs can point to no evidence that employers have uniformly declined to \nadopt such additional precautions for medically ineligible staff. This barren factual \nrecord thus does not support plaintiffs’ unsupported assertion that their employers \nare administering accommodations in an impermissibly discriminatory way. \nSecond,  plaintiffs  have  not  shown  an  irreconcilable  conflict  between  the \nemergency  rule  and  Title  VII  because  the  accommodation  they  prefer—working \ndirectly  with  patients,  residents,  and  other  personnel  while  remaining \nunvaccinated—is not required by Title VII, even assuming that other accommo-\ndations were not available. Title VII requires employers only to make reasonable \naccommodations that do not impose more than “a de minimis cost.” Trans World \nAirlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 84 (1977). And this Court has expressly \nrecognized that such costs can justify an employer’s rejection of a requested religious \naccommodation. For example, this Court concluded in Hardison that Title VII did not \nprohibit the termination of an employee whose religious beliefs prohibited him from \nworking on Saturdays where the proposed scheduling accommodations would involve \n  32 \n\ncosts in the form of “lost efficiency in other jobs or higher wages.” Id. at 84; see also \nMills, 16 F.4th at 36.  \nIn weighing whether a proposed accommodation is unreasonable or would \nimpose an undue hardship, courts give heavy weight to workplace safety. “Title VII \ndoes not require that safety be subordinated to the religious beliefs of an employee.” \nDraper v. United States Pipe & Foundry Co., 527 F.2d 515, 521 (6th Cir. 1975). Thus, \ncourts have upheld employers’ rejection of accommodations that would compromise \nsafety in the workplace, such as a subway worker’s request not to wear a hard hat,34 \nor a firefighter’s request to grow a beard that would interfere with his ability to wear \na  respirator.35  These decisions reflect  the  critical  understanding  that  workplace \nsafety standards protect others besides just the employee requesting the accommo-\ndation, and further ensure that employers can effectively provide goods and services. \nTitle VII thus does not require accommodations that could be provided “only at the \nexpense of others,” or that would undermine the employer’s operations. Hardison, \n432 U.S. at 81; see also Knight v. Connecticut Dep’t of Public Health, 275 F.3d 156, \n168 (2d Cir. 2001) (state agency not required to allow employees “to evangelize while \n \n34 Kalsi v. New York City Transit Auth., 62 F. Supp. 2d 745, 758 (E.D.N.Y. \n1998), aff’d on op. below, 189 F.3d 461 (2d Cir. 1999). \n35 Hamilton v. City of New York, No. 18-cv-4657, 2021 WL 4439974, at *6 \n(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2021); see also Sides v. NYS Div. of State Police, No. 03-cv-153, \n2005 WL 1523557, at *2, 6 (N.D.N.Y. 2005) (refusal of New York State Police to hire \napplicant who could not work on the Sabbath did not violate Title VII because \nproposed accommodation “could conceivably threaten to compromise public safety”). \n  33 \n\nproviding services to clients” given that such an accommodation “would jeopardize \nthe state’s ability to provide services in a religion-neutral” manner).  \nHere, plaintiffs’ requested religious accommodation would both risk workplace \nsafety and undermine DOH’s policy of promoting public health. See supra at 11-13. \nBecause these consequences impose more than a de minimis cost, plaintiffs’ proffered \naccommodation is not required under Title VII. Accordingly, even if plaintiffs cannot \nbe reassigned, Title VII does not obligate plaintiffs’ employers to subordinate the \nhealth and safety of their patients, residents, and workers to plaintiffs’ religious \nbeliefs.  \nb. Plaintiffs respond (e.g., Br. at 34) that some employers may want to allow \nan unvaccinated healthcare worker to continue coming into contact with other people, \nand that the emergency rule conflicts with Title VII by forbidding such voluntary \narrangements. This argument for preemption rests on two fundamentally mistaken \npremises.  \nFirst, plaintiffs mistakenly assume that the religious exemptions they have \npreviously been granted necessarily reflected a judgment by their employers that \nthey faced no “undue hardship” under Title VII from having unvaccinated workers \ninteract with others. That assumption is unfounded. Many employers may simply \nhave been responding to the temporary restraining orders issued by lower courts \nagainst the emergency rule—including orders that did not involve a Title VII claim \nat all. See, e.g., We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, No. 21-2179 (2d Cir. Sept. 30, \n2021), ECF No. 65. Other employers may have been motivated by fear of litigation \n  34 \n\nfrom employees like these plaintiffs, or other factors unrelated to Title VII. Plaintiffs \nthus have no basis beyond conjecture to surmise that the religious exemptions they \nhave received necessarily reflected their employers’ views of undue hardship under \nTitle VII. \nSecond, even if a particular employer were willing to accept the risk of an \nunvaccinated healthcare worker, that willingness would not make the employer’s \naccommodation one that is required by Title VII. Because Title VII imposes a floor \nbut not a ceiling, employers are free to offer accommodations beyond what the federal \nstatute would require—and States are not barred from regulating such employer \ndecisions outside the scope of Title VII. See California Fed. Sav., 479 U.S. at 284-87 \n(rejecting  preemption  claim  against  California  statute  that  provided  pregnancy \ndisability benefits beyond what Title VII required). Indeed, Title VII respects rather \nthan undermines the States’ traditional prerogative to regulate health and safety: as \ndiscussed (see supra at 33), “safety considerations are highly relevant” to the question \nof which accommodations may “reasonably” be offered without imposing an “undue \nhardship on the conduct of the employer’s business,” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j). See Draper, \n527 F.2d at 521; cf. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 78-79 (2002) \n(Americans with Disabilities Act allows “employer[s] to screen out a potential worker \n. . . not only for risks that he would pose to others in the workplace but for risks on \nthe job to his own health or safety”).  \nHere, the emergency rule reflects DOH’s expert judgment that COVID-19 \nvaccination is essential to protect healthcare workers, the vulnerable populations \n  35 \n\nthey serve, and the healthcare system as a whole. And this point would be true even \nif a particular employer were willing to overlook such risks to retain a particular \nemployee—just as an employer’s willingness to excuse a surgeon’s refusal to wash \nher hands would not eliminate the harms caused by that decision. Nothing in Title \nVII supports plaintiffs’ view that the statute respects only employers’ safety concerns, \nwhile disregarding the States’ judgments about the minimum requirements to protect \nhealth and safety in the workplace—judgments that ordinarily receive heavy weight \nin any preemption analysis. See Hillsborough Cnty., Fla. v. Automated Med. Lab’ys, \nInc., 471 U.S. 707, 715 (1985). Put simply, the statute does not allow an employer to \nignore important state health and safety regulations under the guise of complying \nwith Title VII.  \nc. Finally, plaintiffs assert (Br. at 30) that an interim final rule recently \npromulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and guidance \nissued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) support their \nTitle VII claim. See Medicare and Medicaid Programs – Omnibus COVID-19 Health \nCare Staff Vaccination, 86 Fed. Reg. 61,555 (Nov. 5, 2021); EEOC, What You Should \nKnow About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws \n(updated  Oct.  28,  2021).  The  courts  below  did  not  consider  the  effect  of  these \ndocuments, and this Court should decline to do so for the first time on this emergency \nstay application. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (“[W]e are a \ncourt of review, not of first view.”). \n  36 \n\nIn any event, neither the CMS interim final rule nor the EEOC guidance \nsupports plaintiffs’ claim. The CMS rule merely advises covered facilities that Title \nVII continues to apply—an undisputed proposition. 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,572. Nothing \nin the CMS rule dictates that particular accommodations be provided. And nothing \nin the CMS rule requires employers to disregard the risk of COVID-19 spread by \nunvaccinated individuals; to the contrary, the rule expressly acknowledges that “[i]n \ngranting such exemptions or accommodations, employers must ensure that they \nminimize the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to at-risk individuals, in keeping with \ntheir obligation to protect the health and safety of patients.” Id.  \nThe EEOC guidance likewise does not support plaintiffs’ claim that they are \nentitled to their preferred accommodation. Indeed, the EEOC guidance recognizes \nthat  permissible  Title  VII  accommodations  would  include  “a  modified  shift,” \n“telework,” or “reassignment”—all of which are permitted by DOH’s emergency rule. \nEEOC, What You Should Know, supra. EEOC’s guidance thus confirms that the \nemergency rule does not categorically prohibit accommodations that would be allowed \nunder Title VII.  \n3.  Plaintiffs’  objection  to  a  nonparty  state  agency’s \nadministration of unemployment benefits was never \npresented below, is unrelated to the emergency rule at \nissue here, and cannot support a stay of the rule. \nPlaintiffs argue—for the first time in this litigation—that DOH’s emergency \nrule triggers strict scrutiny in light of subsequent guidance issued by a nonparty state \nagency, the New York State Department of Labor (DOL), which says that healthcare \n  37 \n\nworkers may be ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits if they “voluntarily \nquit or are terminated for refusing an employer-mandated vaccination . . . absent a \nvalid request for accommodation.”36 According to plaintiffs, because only medical \nexemptions are available under DOH’s emergency rule, DOL’s new guidance categor-\nically denies unemployment insurance benefits to healthcare workers with religious \nobjections to COVID-19 vaccination and thus “target[s] religious objectors.” (Br. at \n23.) \nAs an initial matter, this Court should decline to consider this new argument, \nwhich plaintiffs raised for the first time in their stay application. Plaintiffs failed to \nraise this argument below—including in their merits brief to the Second Circuit, \nwhich they filed nearly one month after the DOL guidance was issued.37 Plaintiffs \nhave also never directly challenged DOL’s guidance or sued DOL itself. As a result, \nno court below addressed this argument. See Cutter, 544 U.S. at 718 n.7. And DOL’s \nguidance has no direct nexus to plaintiffs’ claims here: it was issued by an agency \nthat is not a party to this case; it addresses eligibility requirements for unemployment \nbenefits that are not at issue here; and it does not affect the implementation of the \nDOH emergency rule that is actually under review. \n \n36 See DOL, Unemployment Insurance: Top Frequently Asked Questions. In \ntheir application, plaintiffs erroneously assert that the website is maintained by \nDOH. (Br. at 9, 23.) It is maintained by DOL. \n37 See Br. for Pls.-Appellees, Dr. A. v. Hochul, No. 21-2566 (2d Cir. Oct. 22, \n2021), ECF No. 38.  \n  38 \n\nIn  any  event,  plaintiffs  simply  misinterpret  the  guidance.  DOL  does  not \ncategorically deny unemployment insurance benefits to healthcare workers who quit \nor are terminated because they refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccination on religious \ngrounds. As the guidance makes clear, benefits are available so long as there was “a \nvalid request for accommodation.” And, for purposes of determining eligibility for \nunemployment insurance benefits, a valid request may exist even if an employer was \nunable or unwilling to provide the accommodation, thereby leading to the employee’s \nresignation or termination. There is thus no basis on this record to presume that \nhealthcare workers will in fact be denied unemployment insurance benefits if they \nlose their jobs based on their religious objections to receiving the COVID-19 vaccines.  \nC.  The Absence of Irreparable Injury and the Balance of \nthe Equities Weigh Heavily Against an Injunction. \nThe extraordinary relief of an emergency stay is also unwarranted here for the \nadditional reason that these plaintiffs have failed to establish either irreparable \ninjury or a balance of the equities in their favor. \n1.  Plaintiffs have failed to establish that they will suffer any harms that \nare either imminent or irreparable. First, plaintiffs’ threadbare evidence fails to \nestablish that they face any imminent threat of adverse employment actions. (The \ndistrict court notably did not rely on any such harm in issuing its preliminary \ninjunction. (App. 71-72, 84-85.)) Nothing in the emergency rule requires employers to \nterminate  or  otherwise  take  adverse  employment  actions  against  unvaccinated \nhealthcare  workers.  Rather,  employers  can  comply  with  the  emergency  rule  by \n  39 \n\nreassigning unvaccinated workers to activities where, if they were infected, they \nwould not pose a risk of transmitting COVID-19 to patients, residents, or other \nworkers. See § 2.61(a)(2). Plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence that they have \nsought (or been denied) such a reassignment. \nSecond, even if plaintiffs did face the imminent harms they allege, it is well-\nestablished that loss of employment, and the resulting financial loss, do not constitute \n“irreparable harm” because plaintiffs can be fully compensated by reinstatement or \nmoney  damages,  including  in  claims  against  their  employers.  See  Sampson  v. \nMurray, 415 U.S. 61, 90-92 (1974). Plaintiffs also assert irreparable injury from an \nimminent deprivation of their First Amendment right to free exercise. See Roman \nCatholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 67. But plaintiffs have not established that DOH’s \nemergency rule directly compels them to act in violation of their religious beliefs. \nThey remain free to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine, subject to potential employment \nconsequences. This purported harm bears no resemblance to the harm in Roman \nCatholic Diocese, where this Court found that the executive orders under review \ndirectly interfered with religious exercise by barring “the great majority of those who \nwish[ed] to attend” religious services from doing so. Id. at 67-68. \nIn contrast to plaintiffs’ failure to show imminent irreparable harm, the public \nfaces the risk of imminent irreparable harm if DOH’s emergency rule were stayed. \nSee Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Achieving high \nvaccination rates in particularly vulnerable settings is of the utmost importance. \nThose  vulnerable  populations  include  immunocompromised  patients  especially \n  40 \n\nsusceptible to viral infections and people who cannot receive the COVID-19 vaccine \nbecause they are too young or have contraindications. The COVID-19 vaccines have \nbeen proven to be extremely safe and effective at protecting healthcare workers \nthemselves and the populations they serve from suffering severe complications from \nCOVID-19. See supra at 4-5. And the vaccination requirement will also protect others \nwho need emergency medical treatment from the consequences of staffing shortages \nand overstrained emergency rooms that could follow a COVID-19 outbreak among \nhealthcare workers.  \nThese  concerns  are  especially  urgent  now  in  light  of  the  uncertainty \nsurrounding the scope of future COVID-19 outbreaks. The emergence and prevalence \nof the Delta variant have led experts to predict that there will be a fall surge in \nCOVID-19 infections. And limited healthcare resources will soon face additional \nstrains due to seasonal influenza and other diseases that accompany the onset of fall \nand winter. Vaccination of healthcare workers will help to prevent additional burdens \nfrom being inflicted on the healthcare sector at the precise moment when it is at risk \nof becoming overtaxed. Accordingly, the balance of the equities tips decidedly in favor \nof defendants.  \n   \n  41 \n\nCONCLUSION \nThe emergency application for a writ of injunction should be denied. \nDated:  New York, NY \nNovember 16, 2021 \nRespectfully submitted, \nLETITIA JAMES \n  Attorney General \n  State of New York \nBy:  _/_s_/_ _B_a__rb__a_r_a_ D__. _U__n_d_e_r_w_o_o_d___ \nBARBARA D.

A, ET  AL., APPLICANTS v. KATHY HOCHUL, \nGOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, ET  AL. \nON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  \n[December 13, 2021]  \n  The application for injunctive relief presented to JUSTICE \nSOTOMAYOR  and by her referred to the Court is denied. \nJUSTICE THOMAS would grant the application. \nJUSTICE GORSUCH, with whom JUSTICE ALITO joins, dis-\nsenting from the denial of application for injunctive relief. \n  New  York  recently  issued  a  regulation  requiring \nhealthcare workers to receive a COVID–19 vaccine.  Those \nwho cite medical reasons are exempt.  But no comparable\nexemption exists for individuals whose sincere religious be-\nliefs prevent them from taking one of the currently availa-\nble vaccines.  It seems New York is one of just three States \nto have a scheme like this.  And it seems originally even \nNew York was headed in a different direction.  When it an-\nnounced the mandate, the then-Governor promised a reli-\ngious exemption.  Weeks later, the State backtracked.  It  \noffered no scientific evidence, or even a written explanation, \nfor the decision.  But a new Governor who assumed office \naround the same time spoke about it.  The new Governor  \nannounced that the decision to eliminate the exemption \nwas “intentiona[l]” and justified because no “organized reli-\ngion” sought it and individuals who did were not “listening \nto God and what God wants.”  Now, thousands of New York  \nhealthcare workers face the loss of their jobs and eligibility \nfor unemployment benefits. Twenty of them have filed suit \n \n\n2  DR. A v. HOCHUL \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \narguing that the State’s conduct violates the First Amend-\nment and asking us to enjoin the enforcement of the man-\ndate against them until this Court can decide their petition \nfor certiorari. \n  Respectfully, I believe they deserve that relief. \nI \nA \n  The doctors and nurses who filed this suit and a compan-\nion case have gone to great lengths to serve their patients \nduring the COVID–19 pandemic.  Consider two of their sto-\nries. \n  Dr. J. is an  OB/GYN who works in a New York hospital.  \nShe is also  a devout Catholic.  During the pandemic, she\nhas consistently treated patients infected with COVID–19 \nin spite of the risks to herself.  Sometimes, in emergencies, \nshe has had to rush into a delivery room without knowing \nwhether a delivering mother is infected with the disease.  \nDr. J. has done all this  even while pregnant herself. \n  Dr. F. serves a rural town as an oral surgeon.  Like Dr. \nJ., he is Catholic and has never turned away a patient in-\nfected with COVID–19.  Instead, he has faced open wounds \nand mouths even when  it involved risks to his  own health.  \nDr. F. says he has done so because, if he had refused, many \nof his patients seeking care could not have obtained it else-\nwhere. \n  These applicants are not “‘anti-vaxxers’” who object to all\n   \nvaccines. Complaint in No. 21–CV–01009 (NDNY), ¶ 37(g).  \nInstead,  the  applicants  explain,  they  cannot  receive  a \nCOVID–19 vaccine because their religion teaches them to \noppose abortion in any form, and because each of the cur-\nrently available vaccines has depended upon abortion-de-\nrived fetal cell lines in its production or testing.  The appli-\ncants acknowledge that many other religious believers feel \ndifferently about these matters than they do.  But no one \nquestions the sincerity of their religious beliefs. \n \n\n  Cite as:  595 U. S. ____ (2021)  3 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nB \n  Until very recently, none of this posed a difficulty.  The  \npandemic began approximately 21 months ago.  Vaccines \nbecame available to New York healthcare workers roughly \n12 months ago.  Through it all, the State allowed—and de-\npended on—front-line healthcare workers like the appli-\ncants to serve their patients.  Things only began to change \nfour months ago when New York, for the first time, an-\nnounced  that  it  was  contemplating  a  vaccine  mandate.  \nEven then, it did not seem the State’s plans would pose a \nproblem for the applicants or thousands of others like them.  \nGovernor Andrew Cuomo assured the public that any new \nmandate would contain “exceptions for those with religious \nor medical reasons.” Governor Cuomo Announces COVID– \n19 Vaccination Mandate for Healthcare Workers (Aug. 16, \n2021),  https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-\nannounces-covid-19-vaccination-mandate-healthcare-workers.   \n   \nOn August 18, 2021, health commissioner Howard Zucker \nissued the proposed mandate, indicating that it would take\neffect on September 27.  Just as the Governor promised, it \ncontained a religious exemption.  App. to Application Exh. \n8, pp. 103–104.\n  The trouble here began only when Mr. Cuomo left the \nGovernor’s office and Kathy Hochul assumed it.  On August\n23, one day before Governor Hochul took office, the State’s \nPublic Health and Health Planning Council—an advisory \ncommittee headed by Commissioner Zucker—proposed a \nrevised mandate, this time with no religious exemption.  \nThe council issued the proposed regulation three days later.  \n10 N. Y. Admin. Code §2.61 (2021).  The regulatory impact \nstatement accompanying this decision did not discuss the \nfeasibility of a religious exemption or the reasons for remov-\ning it.\n  But the new Governor did.  In response to a reporter’s \nquestion 12 days before the revised mandate was set to take \neffect on September 27, Governor Hochul acknowledged  \n \n\n4  DR. A v. HOCHUL \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nthat “we left off [the religious exemption] in our regulations \nintentionally.”  Governor  Hochul  Holds  Q&A  Following\nCOVID–19  Briefing  (Sept.  15,  2021),  https://www. \n   \ngovernor.ny.gov/news/video-rough-transcript-governor-hochul-\nholds-qa-following-covid-19-briefing.  Asked why, the Gov-\nernor answered that there is no “sanctioned religious ex-\nemption from any organized religion” and that organized \nreligions are “encouraging the opposite.”  Ibid.  Apparently \ncontemplating Catholics who object to receiving a vaccine, \nGovernor Hochul added that “everybody from the Pope on\ndown is encouraging people to get vaccinated.”  Ibid. \n  Speaking to a different audience, the Governor elabo-\nrated: “How can you believe that God would give a vaccine \nthat would cause you harm?  That  is not truth.  Those are  \njust lies out there on social media.”  Governor Hochul At-\ntends Services at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem \n(Sept. 12, 2021), https://governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-\nphotos-rush-transcript-governor-hochul-attends-servces-\n \nabyssinian-baptist-church. \n  The day before the mandate went into effect, Governor \nHochul again expressed her view that religious objections \nto COVID–19 vaccines are theologically flawed:  “All of you, \nyes, I know you’re vaccinated, you’re the smart ones, but \nyou know there’s people out there who aren’t listening to\nGod  and  what  God  wants.  You  know  who  they  are.”\nGovernor Hochul Attends Service at Christian Cultural \nCenter (Sept. 26, 2021), https://governor.ny.gov/news/rush-\ntranscript -governor -hochul -attends -service -christian- \n                 \ncultural-center. \n  Around the same time,  Governor Hochul also announced \nthat New York would alter its unemployment insurance \nscheme. Healthcare workers who failed to comply with the \nmandate would not only lose their jobs; they would be per se  \nineligible for unemployment insurance benefits.  See In \nPreparation for Monday Vaccination Deadline, Governor \n \n\n  Cite as:  595 U.

As the State’s website explains, unemployment in-\nsurance cases are generally “reviewed on a case-by-case \nbasis,” but healthcare workers who refuse a vaccine are  \n“ineligible.”    N.  Y.  State  Dept.  of  Labor,  Unemploy- \nment Insurance Top Frequently Asked Questions (Sept. \n25, 2021), https://dol.ny.gov/unemployment-insurance-top-\nfrequently-asked-questions.  \nC \n  Facing the imminent loss of their jobs and unemployment \nbenefits, the doctors and nurses before us filed two separate \nlawsuits seeking a preliminary injunction preventing New\nYork from enforcing its new mandate against them.  In the \nfirst suit, District Judge David Hurd granted the requested \nrelief after concluding that New York’s “intentional change \nin language is the kind of religious gerrymander” that vio-\nlates the First Amendment.  Dr. A. v. Hochul, 2021 WL \n4734404,  *8  (NDNY,  Oct.  12,  2021)  (internal  quotation  \nmarks omitted).  In the second suit, the District Court  \nreached a contrary conclusion and denied relief without an \nopinion.  We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, No. 21–cv– \n4954 (EDNY, Sept. 12, 2021), App. to Application for In-\njunctive Relief in No. 21A125, p. 6.  Ultimately, the Second \nCircuit issued a combined judgment rejecting all of the ap-\nplicants’ claims and dissolving the preliminary injunction \nissued in Dr. A.  See We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, \n17 F. 4th 368 (CA2 2021) (per curiam). \nII  \n  We assess requests for temporary injunctive relief under \na familiar standard that focuses, among other things, on the \nmerits of the applicants’ underlying claims and the harms \n \n\n6  DR. A v. HOCHUL \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nthey are likely to suffer.  Roman Catholic Diocese of Brook-\nlyn v. Cuomo, 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 2).  In \nthis case, no one seriously disputes that, absent relief, the \napplicants will suffer an irreparable injury.  Not only does  \nNew York threaten to have them fired and strip them of \nunemployment benefits.  This Court has held that “[t]he \nloss of First Amendment freedoms, for even  minimal peri-\nods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  \nElrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347, 373 (1976).  Accordingly, be-\nfore us the parties’ fight focuses dominantly on whether the \napplicants are likely to succeed on the merits of their First \nAmendment claim. \n  The answer to that question is clear.  The Free Exercise \nClause protects not only the right to hold unpopular reli-\ngious beliefs inwardly and secretly.  It protects the right to \nlive out those beliefs publicly in “the performance of (or ab-\nstention from) physical acts.”  Employment Div., Dept. of \nHuman Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.  S. 872, 877  \n(1990).  Under this Court’s precedents, laws targeting acts \nfor disfavor only when they are religious in nature or be-\ncause of their religious  character are “doubtless . . . uncon-\nstitutional.”  Id., at 877–878.  As a result, where “official \nexpressions of hostility to religion” accompany laws or poli-\ncies burdening free exercise, we have simply “set aside” \nsuch  policies  without  further  inquiry.  Masterpiece  \nCakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm’n, 584 U.  S.  \n___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 18).  But even where such overt \nanimus is lacking, laws that impose burdens on religious \nexercises must still be both neutral toward religion and\ngenerally applicable or survive strict scrutiny.  Church of \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 546  \n(1993).  To meet its burden under strict scrutiny, the gov-\nernment must demonstrate that its law is narrowly tailored \nto serve a compelling state interest.  Id., at 531–532.  Ap-\nplying these principles to this case, New York’s mandate \nfalters at each step. \n \n\n  Cite as:  595 U. S. ____ (2021)  7 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nA \n  Under the Free Exercise Clause, government “cannot act \nin a manner that passes judgment upon or presupposes the \nillegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices.” Masterpiece, \n584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18); see also  Smith, 494 \nU. S., at 877–878.  As a result, we have said that govern-\nment actions burdening religious practice should be “set \naside” if there is even “slight suspicion” that those actions \n“stem from animosity to religion or distrust of its practices.”  \nMasterpiece, 584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18). \n  New York’s mandate is such an action.  The State began \nwith a plan to exempt religious  objectors from its vaccine \nmandate and only later changed course.  Its regulatory im-\npact statement offered no explanation for the about-face.  \nAt the same time, a new Governor whose assumption of of-\nfice coincided with the change in policy admitted that the \nrevised mandate “left off ” a religious exemption “intention-\n \nally.”  The Governor offered an extraordinary explanation \nfor the change too.  She said that “God wants” people to be \nvaccinated—and that those who disagree are not listening \nto  “organized  religion”  or  “everybody  from  the  Pope  on \ndown.”  Then  the  new  Governor  went  on  to  announce \nchanges to the State’s unemployment scheme designed to \nsingle out for special disfavor healthcare workers who failed \nto comply with the revised mandate.  This record gives rise\nto more than a “slight suspicion” that New York acted out \nof “animosity [toward] or distrust of ” unorthodox religious \n \nbeliefs and practices.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  This rec-\nord practically exudes suspicion of those who hold unpopu-\nlar religious beliefs.  That alone is sufficient to render the \nmandate unconstitutional as applied to these applicants. \nB \n  New York’s regulation fares no better if the question is \nthe law’s neutrality and general applicability.\n  Begin with neutrality.  Even absent proof of animus, a  \n \n\n8  DR. A v. HOCHUL \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nlaw will not qualify as neutral if a religious exercise is the \n“object” of a law and not just “incidental[ly]” or unintention-\nally affected by it. Smith, 494 U. S., at 878.  At “minimum,” \nthat  means  a  law  must  not  “discriminate  on  its  face.”   \nLukumi, 508 U. S., at 533.  Apart from that, it also means \nthat a law will not qualify as neutral if it is “specifically di-\nrected at . . . religious practice.”  Smith, 494 U. S., at 878; \nsee also Lukumi, 508 U. S., at 535.  For reasons we have  \nalready seen, New York’s mandate fails this  test too.  Ra-\nther than burden a religious exercise incidentally or unin-\ntentionally, by the Governor’s own admission the State “in-\ntentionally”  targeted  for  disfavor  those  whose  religious \nbeliefs fail to accord with the teachings of “any organized \nreligion” and “everybody from the Pope on down.”  Even if \none were to read the State’s actions as something other \nthan signs of animus, they leave little doubt that the re-\nvised mandate was specifically directed at the applicants’ \nunorthodox religious beliefs and practices.\n  Consider general applicability next. Recently, a majority \nof this Court reiterated that a law loses its claim to general \napplicability when it “prohibits religious conduct while per-\nmitting secular conduct that undermines the government’s \nasserted interests in a similar way.”  Fulton v. Philadel-\nphia, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 6).  That is ex-\nactly what New York’s regulation does:  It prohibits exemp-\ntions for religious reasons while permitting exemptions for \nmedical reasons. And, as the applicants point out, allowing \na healthcare worker to remain unvaccinated undermines \nthe State’s asserted public health goals equally whether \nthat worker happens to remain unvaccinated for religious  \nreasons or medical ones.  See Does v. Mills, 595 U. S. ___  \n(2021) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting from denial of application \nfor injunctive relief ). \n \n  To be sure, the State speculates that a religious exemp-\ntion could undermine the purpose of its vaccine mandate \ndifferently from a medical exemption if more people were to  \n \n\n  Cite as:  595 U. S. ____ (2021)  9 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nseek a religious exemption than a medical exemption.  But \nthis Court’s general applicability test doesn’t turn on that \nkind of numbers game. At this point in the proceedings, the \nonly question is whether the challenged law contains an ex-\nemption for a secular objector that “undermines the govern-\nment’s asserted interests in a similar way” an exemption \nfor a religious objector might.  Fulton, 593 U. S., at ___ (slip \nop., at 6).  Laws operate on individuals; rights belong to in-\ndividuals.  And the relevant question here involves a one-\nto-one comparison between the individual seeking a reli-\ngious exemption and one benefiting from a secular exemp-\ntion. See, e.g., Tandon v. Newsom, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) \n(per curiam) (slip op., at 1) (comparing the relevant secular \nexemptions to “the religious exercise at issue”). \n  If the estimated number of those who might seek differ-\nent exemptions is relevant, it comes only later in the pro-\nceedings when we turn to the application of strict scrutiny.  \nSee Holt v.  Hobbs, 574 U. S. 352, 368 (2015) (considering \nsizes  of  different  groups  seeking  exemptions).    At  that \nstage, a State might argue, for example, that it has a com-\npelling interest in achieving herd immunity against certain \ndiseases in a population.  It might further contend the most \nnarrowly tailored means to achieve that interest is to re-\nstrict vaccine exemptions to a particular number divided in \na nondiscriminatory manner between medical and religious \nobjectors.  With sufficient evidence to support claims like \nthese, the State might prevail.  See infra, at 10–11.  But \nnone of that bears on  the preliminary question whether\nsuch a mandate is generally applicable or whether it treats \na religious person less favorably than a secular counterpart.  \nC \n  Failing either the neutrality or general applicability test \nis enough to trigger strict scrutiny and impose on New York \nthe burden of showing that its law serves a compelling in-\nterest and employs the least restrictive means of doing so.  \n \n\n10  DR. A v. HOCHUL \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nLukumi, 508 U. S., at 531.  And even accepting for present\npurposes that the State can meet the first of these burdens, \nit cannot satisfy the second. Cf. Mills, 595 U. S., at ___–___ \n(opinion of GORSUCH,  J.) (slip op., at 6–8). \n  Maybe the most telling evidence that New York’s policy \nisn’t narrowly tailored lies in how unique it is.  It seems  \nthat nearly every other State has found that it can satisfy \nits COVID–19 public health goals without coercing reli-\ngious objectors to accept a vaccine.  See Addendum to Ap-\nplication for Injunctive Relief.  Nor has New York “offer[ed] \npersuasive reasons” why it, almost uniquely, cannot do the \nsame.  Holt,  574 U. S., at 369.  To the contrary, as we have \nseen, what explanations the Governor has chosen to supply \nundermine rather than advance the State’s case.  \n  Though this alone is sufficient to show that New York’s \nlaw is not narrowly tailored, still more proof exists.  In a  \nsimilar case, Maine recently argued that it needed a 90% \nvaccination rate among workers in each of its healthcare  \nfacilities to protect against an undue number of COVID–19 \nbreakout  cases.  Mills,  595  U. S.,  at  ___  (opinion  of \nGORSUCH,  J.) (slip op., at 7).  By contrast, in the case before \nus, New York has not even attempted to identify what per-\ncentage of vaccinated workers it thinks is necessary to pro-\ntect public health.  And even assuming New York could \nprove it needed to achieve a similar vaccination rate, the \nevidence before us shows that employee vaccination rates \nin the State’s healthcare facilities already stand at between \nroughly 90% and 96%.  Brief in Opposition to Application \nfor Injunctive Relief 14.  Putting a finer point on it:  New \nYork has presented nothing to suggest that accommodating \nthe religious objectors before us would make a meaningful \ndifference to the protection of public health.  The State has  \nnot even tried. \n  Before leaving the subject, one further point bears men-\ntion.  As I alluded to earlier, if a State could prove that \ngranting or denying religious exemptions would make the  \n \n\n  Cite as:  595 U. S. ____ (2021)  11  \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \ndifference between achieving a crucial vaccination thresh-\nold, it may be that denying exemptions beyond that thresh-\nold number could qualify as a narrowly tailored rule neces-\nsary to achieve a compelling state interest.  Again, though, \nthe problem is that New York does not even seek to advance \nan argument along these or any similar lines.  \nIII  \n  Today, we do not just fail the applicants.  We fail our-\nselves.  It is among our Nation’s proudest boasts that, “[i]f \nthere is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it \nis that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be \northodox in [matters of] religion.”  West Virginia State Bd. \nof Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943).  In this coun-\ntry, “religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, con-\nsistent, or comprehensible to others in order to merit . . . \nprotection.”  Thomas v.  Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Se-\ncurity Div., 450 U. S. 707, 714 (1981).  Nor is the free exer-\ncise of religion “limited to beliefs which are shared by all of \nthe members of a religious sect.”  Id., at 715–716.  Millions  \nhave fled to this country to escape persecution for their un-\npopular or unorthodox religious beliefs, attracted by Amer-\nica’s promise that “[e]very citizen here is in his own country.  \nTo the protestant it is a protestant country; to the catholic, \na catholic country; and the jew, if he pleases, may establish \nin it his New Jerusalem.”  People v. Phillips, 1 W. L. J. 109,  \n112–113 (Gen. Sess., N. Y. 1813), reported in  W. Sampson, \nThe Catholic Question in America 85 (1813).\n  As today’s case shows, however, sometimes our promises \noutrun our actions.  Sometimes dissenting religious beliefs \ncan seem strange and bewildering.  In times of crisis, this  \npuzzlement can evolve into fear and anger.  It seems Gov-\nernor Hochul’s thinking has followed this trajectory, and I \nsuspect she is far from alone.  After all, today a large ma-\njority  of  Americans—religious  persons  included—have \ntaken one of the COVID–19 vaccines.  It is also true that  \n \n\n12  DR. A v. HOCHUL \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nsome faith leaders, the Pope included, have encouraged vac-\ncination.  If so many other religious persons are willing to\nbe vaccinated, it is tempting enough to ask:  What can be so  \nwrong with coercing the few who are not? \n  By now, though, we should know the costs that come  \nwhen this Court stands silent as majorities invade the con-\nstitutional rights of the unpopular and unorthodox.  More  \nthan 80 years ago, in the shadow of a looming second world \nwar, local governments across the country rushed to en-\ncourage displays of national unity.  A public school in Min-\nersville, Pennsylvania, did its part by requiring all students \nto stand daily and salute the American flag.  But Lillian \nand William Gobitas would not oblige.  As Jehovah’s Wit-\nnesses, they believed they could not pledge fealty to any-\nthing or anyone except God.  When the children refused to \nsalute, the school expelled them.  See S. Peters, Judging Je-\nhovah’s Witnesses: Religious Persecution and the Dawn of \nthe Rights Revolution 19–38 (2000) (Peters). \n  When the Gobitas family sought this Court’s interven-\ntion, it demurred.  The Court ruled that the Constitution \ndoes not “compel exemption from doing what society thinks \nnecessary for the promotion of some great common end.”   \nMinersville  School  Dist.  v.  Gobitis,  310  U.  S.  586,  593 \n(1940).  In doing so, the Court not only erred in the small \nmatter of the children’s last name; it erred in the most fun-\ndamental of things. It took the view that the collective was \nmore important than the individual—and that the demands \nof an impending emergency were more pressing than hold-\ning fast to the timeless promises of our Constitution.  Id., at \n596.  In the weeks that followed the decision, Witnesses \nacross the country suffered hundreds of physical attacks.  \nPeters 72–95.  \n  Eventually, the Court changed course and overruled Go-\nbitis.  In West Virginia State Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, the  \nCourt finally acknowledged what had been true all along— \n \n\n  Cite as:  595 U. S. ____ (2021)  13  \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nthat our Constitution is intended to prevail over the pas-\nsions of the moment, and that the unalienable rights rec-\norded in its text are not matters to “be submitted to vote; \nthey depend on the outcome of no elections.”  319 U. S., at  \n638. Instead, it is this Court’s duty to “apply the limitations \nof the Constitution with no fear that freedom to be intellec-\ntually and spiritually diverse or even contrary will disinte-\ngrate  the  social  organization.”    Id.,  at  641.    The  First \nAmendment protects against “coercive elimination of dis-\nsent” and “was designed to avoid these ends by avoiding \nthese beginnings.”  Ibid. \n  Today, our Nation faces not a world war but a pandemic.  \nLike wars, though, pandemics often produce demanding \nnew social rules aimed at protecting collective interests— \nand with those rules can come fear and anger at individuals \nunable to conform for religious reasons.  If cases like Gobitis  \nbear any good, it is in their cautionary tale.  They remind\nus that, in the end, it is always the failure to defend the \nConstitution’s promises that leads to this Court’s greatest  \nregrets.  They remind us, too, that in America, freedom to \ndiffer is not supposed to be “limited to things that do not \nmatter much.  That would be a mere shadow of freedom.   \nThe test of its substance is the right to differ as to things \nthat touch the heart of the existing order.”  Barnette, 319  \nU. S., at 642.  The test of this Court’s substance lies in its \nwillingness to defend more than the shadow of freedom in \nthe trying times, not just the easy ones. \n  We have already lived through the Gobitis-Barnette cycle \nonce in this pandemic.  At first, this Court permitted States \nto shutter houses of worship while allowing casinos, movie \ntheaters,  and  other  favored  businesses  to remain  open.  \nFalling prey once more to the “judicial impulse to stay out \nof the way in times of crisis,” the Court allowed States to do \nall this even when religious institutions agreed to follow the \nsame occupancy limits and protective measures considered \nsafe enough for comparable gatherings in secular spaces.   \n \n\n14  DR. A v. HOCHUL \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nRoman Catholic Diocese, 592 U. S., at ___ (GORSUCH, J.,  \nconcurring) (slip op., at 5).  But as days gave way to weeks \nand weeks to months, this Court came to recognize that the \nConstitution is not to be put away in challenging times, and \nwe stopped tolerating discrimination against religious ex-\nercises.  Tandon, 593 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Finally, \nchurches and synagogues and mosques reopened on equal \nfooting with secular institutions. \n  Still, it seems the old lessons are hard ones.  Six weeks  \nago, this Court refused relief in  a case involving Maine’s \nhealthcare workers.  Mills, 595 U. S. ___.  Today, the Court\nrepeats the mistake by turning away New York’s doctors \nand nurses.  We do all this even though the State’s execu-\ntive decree clearly interferes with the free exercise of reli-\ngion—and does so seemingly based on nothing more than \nfear and anger at those who harbor unpopular religious be-\nliefs.  We allow the State to insist on the dismissal of thou-\nsands of medical workers—the very same individuals New \nYork has depended on and praised for their service on the \npandemic’s front lines over the last 21 months.  To add in-\nsult to injury, we allow the State to deny these individuals \nunemployment benefits too.  One can only hope today’s rul-\ning will not be the final chapter in this grim story.  Cases  \nlike this one may serve as cautionary tales for those who \nfollow. But how many more reminders do we need that “the \nConstitution is not to be obeyed or disobeyed as the circum-\nstances of a particular crisis . . . may suggest”?   Downes v. \nBidwell, 182 U. S. 244, 384 (1901) (Harlan, J., dissenting). \n ",

Hochul, No. 21-\n2179, and Dr. A. v. Hochul, No. 21-2566, which we heard and decided in tandem. 2021 \nWL 5121983 (2d Cir. Nov. 4, 2021). We do so in light of the text of the recent order of the \ndistrict court in Dr. A. v. Hochul, vacating the preliminary injunction at issue. No. 1:21-\nCV-1009 (N.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2021). The district court there wrote that the Dr. A. Plaintiffs \n“no longer need” a preliminary injunction because Section 2.61 “does not prevent \nemployees from seeking a religious accommodation allowing them to continue working \nconsistent with the Rule, while avoiding the vaccination requirement.” Id. (quoting We \nthe Patriots USA, Inc., 2021 WL 5121983, at *17).  \nA reader might erroneously conclude from this text that, consistent with our \nopinion, employers may grant religious accommodations that allow employees to \ncontinue working, unvaccinated, at positions in which they “engage in activities such \nthat if they were infected with COVID-19, they could potentially expose other covered \npersonnel, patients or residents to the disease.” 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61 (definition of \n“personnel”). In our opinion, however, we stated that “Section 2.61, on its face, does not \nbar an employer from providing an employee with a reasonable accommodation that \nremoves the individual from the scope of the Rule.” 2021 WL 5121983, at *17 (emphasis \nadded). In other words, it may be possible under the Rule for an employer to \n \n3 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D79o,c 1u1m/1e2n/t2 3012 1  ,F 3ile2d1 01317/145, /P2a1g  e P4a ogfe 5 4 of 5\naccommodate—not exempt—employees with religious objections, by employing them in a \nmanner that removes them from the Rule’s definition of “personnel.” Id. Such an \naccommodation would have the effect under the Rule of permitting such employees to \nremain unvaccinated while employed.  \nOf course, Title VII does not obligate an employer to grant an accommodation \nthat would cause “undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” See 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000e(j). And, as we also observed in our opinion, “Contrary to the Dr. A. \nPlaintiffs’ interpretation of the statute, Title VII does not require covered entities to \nprovide the accommodation that Plaintiffs prefer—in this case, a blanket religious \nexemption allowing them to continue working at their current positions unvaccinated.” \n2021 WL 5121983, at *17. To repeat: if a medically eligible employee’s work assignments \nmean that she qualifies as “personnel,” she is covered by the Rule and her employer \nmust “continuously require” that she is vaccinated against COVID-19. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \n§ 2.61. As we observed, this requirement runs closely parallel to the longstanding New \nYork State requirements, subject to no religious exemption, that medically eligible \nhealthcare employees be vaccinated against rubella and measles. 2021 WL 5121983, at \n*13. \nThe preliminary injunction entered by the district court in Dr. A. v. Hochul on \nOctober 12, 2021, has been vacated. See We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, No. 21-2179, \nand Dr. A. v. Hochul, No. 21-2566, 2021 WL 5103443, at *1 (2d Cir. Oct. 29, 2021). New \nYork State’s emergency rule requiring that healthcare facilities “continuously require” \nthat certain medically eligible employees—those covered by the Rule’s definition of \n“personnel”—are vaccinated against COVID-19, is currently in effect. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \n§ 2.61. We caution further that our opinion addressed only the likelihood of success on \nthe merits of Plaintiffs’ claims; it did not provide our court’s definitive determination of \nthe merits of those claims.  \n \n4 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D79o,c 1u1m/1e2n/t2 3012 1  ,F 3ile2d1 01317/145, /P2a1g  e P5a ogfe 5 5 of 5\nIn the interest of judicial economy, we direct the Clerk of Court to refer any \nfurther proceedings in these two matters to this panel. \n \n5 \n ",

A., NURSE A., DR. C., NURSE D., DR. F., DR. G,   \nTHERAPIST I., DR. J., NURSE J., DR. M., NURSE N.,   \nDR. O., DR. P., TECHNOLOGIST P., DR. S., NURSE S.  DECLARATION \nand PHYSICIAN LIAISON X.,   \n  21 CV 1009 (DNH)(ML) \nPlaintiffs,   \n  DECLARATION OF \n        v.  ELIZABETH RAUSCH-\nKATHY HOCHUL, Governor of the State of New York, in  PHUNG,  \nher official capacity; HOWARD ZUCKER, M.D.,  M.D., M.P.H. \nCommissioner of the New York State Department of   \nHealth, in his official capacity; and LETITIA JAMES,   \nAttorney General of the State of New York, in her official \ncapacity, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nELIZABETH RAUSCH-PHUNG, M.D., M.P.H., declares under penalty of perjury, pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1746, that the following is true: \n1)  I am the Medical Director of the Bureau of Immunization at New York State \nDepartment of Health (“Department” or “DOH”). I have been employed by DOH for over 11 \nyears. I oversee the Bureau of Immunization’s efforts to improve immunization coverage and \nprevent vaccine-preventable diseases among New Yorkers of all ages. The Bureau of \nImmunization is located within the Department’s Division of Epidemiology. I have overseen the \nDepartment’s role in the mass vaccination sites across the state. \n2)  I received my M.D. degree from the State University of New York, Upstate \nMedical University in 2003 and completed a residency in preventive medicine and a Master of \nPublic Health degree in 2009.  I have been licensed to practice medicine in New York State since \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 2 of 22\n2008. I am currently board-certified in Preventive Medicine. \n3)  I make this declaration in opposition to the plaintiffs’ application for a \npreliminary injunction. I am familiar with the facts set forth herein based on personal knowledge \nand expertise and DOH records. I have also reviewed guidance from the Centers for Disease \nControl & Prevention (“CDC”) and the State, executive orders issued by the Governor, as well as \nstudies and publications related to COVID-19. \nBackground \n \n4)  The Department and the Commissioner of Health (“Commissioner”) are charged \nwith the overarching responsibility to protect the public health pursuant to Public Health Law \n(“PHL”) §§ 201 and 206. Specifically, pursuant to PHL § 201(1)(m), the Department “shall … \nsupervise and regulate the sanitary aspects … businesses and activities affecting public health.” \nPursuant to PHL § 206, the Commissioner “shall … take cognizance of the interests of health \nand life of the people of the state, and of all matters pertaining thereto.” These statutes obligate \nthe Department and the Commissioner to take action when the public health is put at risk by an \nunprecedented and unpredictable global pandemic, and the rapid outbreak of severe and fatal \nrespiratory illnesses associated therewith. \n5)  On August 23, 2021, DOH published a proposed Emergency Regulation to be \nreviewed and adopted by the Public Health and Health Planning Council (“PHHPC”).1 This \n \n1 PHHPC is a council within DOH that, in accordance with Section 225 of the Public Health Law, advises the Commissioner on \nissues related to the preservation and improvement of public health. PHHPC’s functions include the approval of regulations \nrelated to health codes, among other things. PHHPC also has a broad array of advisory and decision-marking responsibilities with \nrespect to New York State public health and health care delivery system.  See Department’s Public Health and Health Planning \nCouncil, found at https://www.health.ny.gov/facilities/public_health_and_health_planning_council/ (last viewed September 22, \n2021).  \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 3 of 22\nEmergency Regulation superseded the August 18, 2021 Order for Summary Action. The \nEmergency Regulation expanded the scope of the Order for Summary Action to include other \nhealthcare facilities and omitted an explicit religious exemption. The Emergency Regulation was \nadopted by PHHPC on August 26, 2021 and became effective August 26, 2021 for 90 days.2 A \ncopy of the Emergency Regulation is annexed hereto as Exhibit A. \n6)  This Emergency Regulation was adopted based on rational determinations by the \nDepartment and PHHPC that it was necessary to immediately address an ongoing and rapidly \nworsening public health crisis. The Department has accumulated, compiled and analyzed data \nand research regarding the nature and progression of COVID-19, its communicable nature, and \nthe effectiveness of layered mitigation strategies to prevent community spread. These \nconsiderations provided a rational basis for the promulgation of the Emergency Regulation in \nquestion on an emergency basis and the Department complied with SAPA in doing so. \n7)  Namely, despite the ending of the state disaster emergency on June 25, 2021, \n“[w]ith the emergence of the Delta variant, a strain twice as transmissible as the SARS-CoV-2 \nstrain, this does not mean that COVID-19 is gone. Cases have risen 10-fold since early July, with \nthe Delta variant accounting for 95% of recent sequenced positives in New York State.” See \nExhibit A. \nCOVID-19 Variants Continue to Present a Grave Threat to Health and Safety \n8)  Despite the gains that New York has made, the pandemic is not over as numbers  \n \n2 In accordance with SAPA § 202(6)(b), the Emergency Regulation went into effect immediately upon filing. In accordance with \nSAPA § 202, emergency regulations are effective for 90 days, subject to renewal. \n \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 4 of 22\nhave continued to increase. The COVID-19 variants discovered in New York and around the \nworld create an increased risk for transmission and exacerbate the danger in situations that are \nalready considered risky by their nature.  \n9)  The CDC conducts surveillance on SARS-CoV-2 strains to create a library of the \nvarious specimens and sequences to better assist in the public health response.3 A copy of the \nCDC Scientific Brief: Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants is attached hereto as Exhibit B. Some \nnotable emerging variants were discovered in the United Kingdom (Alpha), South Africa (Beta), \nand Brazil (Gamma), all of which spread easier than the original virus. Id. The current \npredominant variant in the United States is the Delta variant, which is more than twice as \ntransmissible as these previous variants. A copy of the CDC’s Delta Variant: What We Know \nAbout the Science is attached hereto as Exhibit C.  \n10)  Indeed, in May 2021, only 1% of cases in New York were from the Delta variant. \nA copy of news article University at Buffalo Researchers Taking a Closer Look at the Delta \nVariant is attached hereto as Exhibit D. By July 2021, however, despite all of the predominant \nCOVID-19 variants found in New York; every new case except one that was genome sequenced \nby scientists at the University of Buffalo was the Delta variant. A copy of Local Buffalo News \narticle, Every case except one was delta: NY scientists urge vaccines, masking as delta variant \nrages is attached hereto as Exhibit E.  The CDC variant proportions tracker for the region that \nincludes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands indicates that for the week \n \n3 On May 31, 2021, The World Health Organization (“WHO”) announced new naming labels for the variants of \ninterest and concern. See Tracking SARS-CoV-2 Variants, World Health Organization, found at \nhttps://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/ (last viewed September 9, 2021). \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 5 of 22\nof September 12 to September 18, 2021, 98.4% of cases were Delta.4  Based on data collected \nfor a 4-week period up to August 28, 2021, in New York State, 97.8% of cases were Delta.5 \n11)  Globally, scientists are seeking to understand the ease of the variants’ \ntransmission and the efficacy of existing vaccines against them. See Exhibit B.  A great deal of \nnew information about the variants’ “virologic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics” is \ndeveloping. Id. \n12)  According to the CDC, the Delta variant is more than two times more contagious \nthan previous variants and may cause more severe illness than previous variants in unvaccinated \npeople.  See Exhibit C.  “[D]ata show fully vaccinated persons are less likely than unvaccinated \npersons to acquire SARS-CoV-2, and infections with the Delta variant in fully vaccinated \npersons are associated with less severe clinical outcomes.” A copy of the CDC’s Science Brief: \nCOVID-19 Vaccines and Vaccination is attached hereto as Exhibit F.  Although vaccinated \npeople can become infected and have the potential to spread the virus to others, they do so at \nmuch lower rates than unvaccinated people.  Id.; Exhibit C.  SARS-CoV-2 transmission between \nunvaccinated persons is the primary cause of continued spread.  Exhibit F.    \n13)  Additionally, all of the abovementioned variants have been characterized by the \nCDC as variants of concern. A “variant of concern” is one “for which there is evidence of an \nincrease in transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g., increase hospitalizations or deaths), \nsignificant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or \nvaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.” A \n \n4 See Variant Proportions, CDC, found at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions (last viewed \nSeptember 22, 2021). \n5 Id.  \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 6 of 22\ncopy of the CDC’s SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions is attached hereto as \nExhibit G. \n14)  One of the key concerns in this regard is to ensure that New York State does not  \nreturn to the infection levels experienced during the spring of 2020 when the hospitals were \noverwhelmed, which can lead to further unnecessary deaths.  During the spring 2020, many \ndoctors and nurses came to help New York, as it had become the epicenter for the pandemic. As \nthe entire nation has now, at one point or another, faced high infection rates, New York can no \nlonger rely on the reserve of the additional volunteers. \n15)  On September 22, 2021, Johns Hopkins reported that globally, 229,698,682  \nindividuals to date had tested positive for COVID-19, and a total of 4,711,795 confirmed \nCOVID-19 deaths worldwide.6 In addition, 42,420,384 individuals in the United States had \ntested positive for COVID-19 to date, and total 678,584 had died of COVID-19. Id.  \n16)  The first surge of COVID-19 in New York was March-April-May 2020 and a  \nresurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the New York in November-December-\nJanuary 2020-2021, with previous variants. Now we are in the midst of another resurgence, \npresently with highly transmittable Delta variant.  \n17)  In New York, looking at testing data as of September 20, 2021, the total number  \nof individuals to date who had tested positive for COVID-19 was 2,363,842,7 and as reported to \n \n6 See COVID-19 Dashboard, John Hopkins University of Medicine, found at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html \n(last viewed September 22, 2021). \n7 See NYSDOH COVID-19 Tracker, found at https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-\nTracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-\nMap?%253Aembed=yes&%253Atoolbar=no&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y (last viewed \nSeptember 22, 2021). \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 7 of 22\nand compiled by the CDC, the number of individuals who had died of COVID-19 was 56,309.8 \n18)  On September 20, 2021, 143,765 were tested for COVID-19 and there were 5,242 \nnew positive COVID-19 cases in New York State.  This is a total positivity rate of 3.64%.9  \nDespite the gains that New York has made, the pandemic is not over as numbers have continued \nto increase.   \n19)  Governor Cuomo ended the state disaster emergency to fight COVID-19 on June  \n25, 2021, citing declining hospitalization and positivity statewide, as well as success in \nvaccination rates. A copy of the Governor’s June 23, 2021 Press Release is attached hereto as \nExhibit H. \n20)  However, with the emergence of the Delta variant, a strain twice as transmissible  \nas the SARS-CoV-2 strain, this does not mean that COVID-19 is gone.  See Exhibit A. \n21)  With the state disaster emergency ended but the with the continuing need to  \ncontrol the spread of the prevalent Delta variant, Commissioner Zucker “recommend[ed] \nfollowing guidance from the CDC and local health departments.” A copy of the August 5, 2021 \nPress Release “Statement from New York State Department of Health Commissioner Dr. \nHoward Zucker” is attached hereto as Exhibit I. \nThe Importance of Vaccinations \n \n22)  Fully vaccinated individuals are less likely to spread infectious diseases to  \n \n8 See NYSDOH, COVID-19 Tracker, Fatalities by County, found at \nhttps://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-\nFatalities?%253Aembed=yes&%253Atoolbar=no&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y (last \nviewed September 22, 2021). \n9 See NYSDOH, COVID-19 Tracker, Daily Totals: Persons Tested and Persons Tested Positive, found at   \nhttps://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-\nDailyTracker?%253Aembed=yes&%253Atoolbar=no&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aembed=y (last \nviewed September 22, 2021).   \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 8 of 22\nother people, including people who cannot get vaccinated because they are too young, or they \nhave a weakened immune system.   \n23)  COVID-19 is not the only serious preventable disease that is of concern.  The \nCDC declared vaccination to be one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the \ntwentieth century.  The introduction and widespread use of vaccines have profoundly reduced the \noccurrence of many serious infectious diseases.  Prior to vaccines, thousands of children each \nyear, living in the United States, could expect to die or be left with life-long disabilities as a \nresult of contracting diseases that are now preventable by vaccination, such as smallpox, \npoliomyelitis, rubella, measles, diphtheria and pertussis.  If enough people stop getting \nvaccinated, outbreaks of now-rare, preventable diseases would return, as happened with the \n2018-2019 measles outbreak in New York State − the worst measles outbreak in the United \nStates in more than 25 years.  \n24)  For instance, rubella and polio have both been declared eliminated from the \nUnited States, however they both have occurred in other countries and therefore, unvaccinated \nNew Yorkers remain at risk of those diseases if they either travel to those countries or have \ncontact with people sick with rubella or polio visiting from or returning from travel to countries \nin which they are circulating. \n25)  The worldwide eradication of smallpox and the near-eradication of poliomyelitis \ncan be directly attributed to vaccination.  Similarly, once commonly encountered and often \ndeadly diseases such as diphtheria and rubella are becoming a rarity in the United States as a \nresult of the routine use of vaccination against these and other infectious diseases  \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 9 of 22\n26)  When immunization coverage rates drop, even in only localized or isolated \ncommunities, the risk of vaccine preventable disease outbreaks rises, as we saw in the 2018-2019 \nmeasles outbreak, which resulted in a large number of cases spreading quickly in relatively small \ncommunities that had very low rates of MMR vaccination coverage (within a state that had a \nhigh overall MMR vaccine coverage).  Vaccination mandates are in place not only to protect, for \ninstance, children in close proximity in a classroom setting or patients and staff in close hospital \nquarters, but more importantly, the public at large.  There remains a risk to the public if \nunimmunized individuals in the community begin to grow in number.  If immunization rates for \nvaccine-preventable diseases begin to drop, New York State could face the precarious scenario \nof dealing with multiple outbreaks of communicable diseases at the same time.  To risk another \nserious wave of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, during a time when New York State’s public \nhealth resources are already incredibly strained, would be extremely irresponsible.   \nHistory of COVID-19 Vaccinations \n \n27)  The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) may issue an \nEmergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) to facilitate the availability of vaccinations during public \nhealth emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows an unapproved medical \nproduct to prevent serious life-threatening diseases in an emergency when certain criteria have \nbeen met and there are no adequate or approved alternatives.  A copy of the FDA’s Emergency \nUse Authorization for Vaccines Explained is attached hereto as Exhibit J. \n28)  On December 11, 2020, the FDA issued its first EUA for the Pfizer COVID-19 \nvaccine for those ages 16 and older.  A copy of the FDA’s December 11, 2020 News Release is \nattached hereto as Exhibit K. \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 10 of 22\n29)  On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the Moderna COVID-19 \nvaccine for use by those ages 18 and older.  A copy of the FDA’s December 18, 2020 News \nRelease is attached hereto as Exhibit L. \n30)  On February 27, 2021, the FDA issued an EUA Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine for use \nin ages 18 or older.  A copy of the FA’s February 27, 2021 News Release is attached hereto as \nExhibit M. \n31)  On May 10, 2021, the FDA expanded the EUA for the Pfizer COVID-19 \nvaccination to include individuals ages 12-15 years of age.  A copy of the FDA’s May 10, 2021 \nNews Release is attached hereto as Exhibit N. \n32)  On August 12, 2021, the FDA amended the EUAs for the Pfizer and Moderna \nvaccination for use of an additional dose in immunocompromised individuals.  A copy of the \nFDA’s August 12, 2021 News Release is attached hereto as Exhibit O. \n33)  On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine − the Pfizer-\nBioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine − for the prevention of COVID-19 in those ages 16 and older. \nThe vaccine continues to be made available under emergency use authorization (EUA) for those \naged 12-15.  A copy of the FDA’s Comirnaty and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is \nattached hereto as Exhibit P. \n34)  On September 17, 2021, the FDA voted to recommend EUA for a booster dose of \nthe Pfizer vaccine in individuals 65 years of age or older and for individuals at high risk of \nsevere COVID-19, to be administered at least six months after the two-dose series. The panel \nagreed that healthcare workers and others at high risk of occupational exposure should be \nincluded in this EUA.  A copy of the September 17, 2021 Press Release is attached hereto as \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 11 of 22\nExhibit Q.  \nThe Development of COVID-19 Vaccines \n35)  There is an important distinction between what is in the actual makeup of the \nvaccines versus what was used in the research and development of the vaccines.  None of the \nFDA approved final COVID-19 vaccine products contain any fetal cells.  \n36)  Each of the manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for use in \nthe U.S. have statements on their websites that they do not contain fetal cell lines nor human-\nderived materials. \n37)  The Moderna website states “[t]he Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain \nany preservatives, antibiotics, adjuvants, or materials of human or animal origin.  The Moderna \nCOVID-19 vaccine does not use fetal cell lines during the vaccine manufacturing or lot testing.” \nA copy of the Moderna website text is attached hereto as Exhibit R. \n38)  The Pfizer website states that “[a]nimal or human fetal-derived cell lines are not \nused to produce Comirnaty (also known as Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine), which \nconsists of synthetic and enzymatically produced components.” A copy of the Pfizer website text \nis attached hereto as Exhibit S. \n39)  The Janssen website states that “[t]here is no fetal tissue nor any human cells \npresent in the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S; JNJ-78436735).”  A copy of the \nJanssen website text is attached hereto as Exhibit T. \n40)  In sum, while none of the FDA approved COVID-19 vaccines contain any fetal \ncells, fetal cell lines were only “used in testing during research and development of the mRNA \nvaccines [Moderna or Pzifer], and during production of the Johnson and Johnson [Janssen] \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 12 of 22\nvaccine.”  A copy of the Nebraska Medicine’s You asked, we answered: Do the COVID-19 \nVaccines Contain Aborted Fetal Cells is attached hereto as Exhibit U. \n41)  A North Dakota Department of Health COVID-19 vaccine handout also notes that \n“[h]istorical fetal cell lines were derived in the 1960’s and 1970’s from two elective abortions \nand have been used to create vaccines for diseases such as hepatitis A, rubella, and rabies.” The \nNorth Dakota Department of Health handout COVID-19 Vaccines & Fetal Cell Lines is attached \nhereto as Exhibit V.    \n42)  Further, fetal cell lines have been used in other medical technologies.  This process \nis not new. \n43)  For instance, fetal cell lines have been used to develop Rubella, hepatitis A and \nvaricella-containing vaccines.  A copy of CNN’s How Exactly Fetal Tissue is Used for Medicine \nis attached hereto as Exhibit W.   \n44)  Importantly, the Rubella vaccination, developed using the same fetal cell lines, is \nalready required of healthcare workers in New York State. \n45)  Fetal cells have also been used in “hundreds of thousands of other research \nprojects” including the improvement of techniques for and the study of in vitro fertilization, \n“birth defects, eye diseases, Parkinson’s Alzheimer’s disease, AIDS, and spinal cord injuries.”  A \ncopy of NBC News What is fetal tissue research? And why is it important to medicine? is \nattached hereto as Exhibit X. \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 13 of 22\nReligious Exemption to COVID-19 Vaccinations \n46)  The absence of religious exemptions in mandatory vaccination laws is not a novel \nconcept in New York State and the Emergency Regulation’s silence as to a religious exemption \nis consistent with other mandatory vaccination laws for healthcare workers.  \n47)  Existing regulations require that all persons who work at hospitals, nursing \nhomes, diagnostic and treatment centers, home health agencies and programs and hospices be \nimmune to measles and rubella.  While these regulations all provide for a medical exemption, \nnone of these regulations provide for a religious exemption.   See 10 NYCRR § 405.3 (requiring \nmeasles and rubella immunizations for all hospital personnel with an exception for physicians \npracticing medicine from remote location); 10 NYCRR § 415.26 (requiring measles and rubella \nimmunizations for all nursing home personnel except for those with no clinical or patient contact \nresponsibilities and who are located in a building with no patient care services); 10 NYCRR \n§ 751.6 (requiring measles and rubella vaccinations for all employees of diagnostic and treatment \ncenters); 10 NYCRR § 763.13 (requiring measles and rubella vaccinations prior to patient care \nduties, for all personnel of certified home health agencies, long term home health care programs, \nand AIDS home care programs); 10 NYCRR § 766.11 (requiring measles and rubella \nvaccinations for all health care personnel of licensed home care services agencies who have \ndirect patient contact); and 10 NYCRR § 794.3 (requiring measles and rubella vaccinations for \nall hospice personnel, including direct employees, contract staff, and volunteers who have direct \npatient or family contact); 10 NYCRR § 1001.11 (requiring measles and rubella vaccinations for \nall assisted living residences personnel, including all direct care staff).   \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 14 of 22\n48)  The absence of a religious exemption in 10 NYCRR § 2.61 is consistent with all \nof the above pre-existing regulations relevant to healthcare workers.  To provide otherwise for \nsolely the COVID-19 vaccination mandate would be inconsistent with similar regulations, which \nall seek to advance similar goals of preventing the transmission of infectious diseases among \nhealth care personnel, staff, and patients.  \n49)  Similar to the majority of the above regulations, 10 NYCRR § 2.61 recognizes \nthat the greatest threat of transmission is posed by healthcare personnel who have direct contact \nwith other staff and patients. Therefore, the vaccination mandate in 10 NYCRR § 2.61 is \nappropriately limited to only those personnel “who engage in activities such that if they were \ninfected with COVID-19, they could potentially expose other covered personnel, patients, \nresidents to the disease.” \n50)  Mandatory school entry vaccination laws similarly do not provide for a religious \nexemption. \n51)  As part of the multi-faceted approach to addressing the 2018-2019 measles \noutbreak, on June 13, 2019, New York State signed into law legislation which removed religious \nexemptions from school vaccination requirements for children in prekindergarten-12th grade \n(“religious exemption repeal”).  (Laws of 2019, Chapter 35, which, among other things, repealed \nformer NYS Public Health Law § 2164(9)).  The law now treats individuals with religious beliefs \ncontrary to immunization exactly the same as individuals with non-religious beliefs contrary to \nimmunization.   \n52)  Chapter 35 of the Laws of 2019 eliminated non-medical (i.e., religious) \nexemptions to vaccination requirements. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 15 of 22\nBasis for Mandating COVID-19 Vaccines for Health Care Personnel \n53)  As set forth above, the highly contagious Delta Variant is spreading across the  \nnation and across New York. Delta is currently the predominant variant of the virus in the United \nStates.   Exhibit C.  Health care workers have higher rates of infection than people in other \nfields.  A copy of the Annals of Internal Medicine, The Case for Mandating COVID-19 Vaccines \nfor Health Care Workers is attached hereto as Exhibit Y.  The mortality rate of COVID-19 is \nestimated to be 1 in 100 to 250.   A copy of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Prevalence in England \nFollowing the First Peak of the Pandemic is attached hereto as Exhibit Z.  In 2020 alone, \nSARS-CoV-2 is estimated to have caused more than 522,000 excess deaths in the United States.  \nA copy of Excess Deaths from COVID-19 and Other Causes in the US, March 1, 2020 to \nJanuary 2, 2021 is attached hereto as Exhibit AA. \n54)  Patient facing healthcare professionals and their household members have \nthreefold and twofold increased risks of admission with COVID-19.   A copy of the Risk of \nHospital Admission with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Healthcare Workers and their \nHouseholds: Nationwide Linkage Cohort Study is attached hereto as Exhibit BB. According to \nthe CDC, to date, 557,585 US health care personnel have contracted COVID-19 and 1,768 have \ndied of COVID-19.10  \n55)  Further, health care workers tend to persons who are elderly, sick, and vulnerable, \nwho might not be vaccinated because they are either too young or have contraindications, or who \nmight not gain sufficient immunity from the vaccine to provide adequate protection from severe \n \n10 Cases & Deaths Among Healthcare Personnel, CDC, found at https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#health-care-\npersonnel (last viewed September 22, 2021).  \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 16 of 22\nillness, such as immunocompromised individuals.  A copy of the Safety and Immunogenicity of \nof Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Messenger RNA Vaccines in Recipients of Solid Organ Transplants is \nattached hereto as Exhibit CC. Vaccinating healthcare workers would protect even the \nunvaccinated patients because COVID-19 vaccines are associated with fewer infections overall \nand less risk of transmission. \n56)  More than “50 health care professional societies and organizations [have] called \nfor all health care employers to require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in a \njoint statement released” on July 26, 2021.  These include, but are not limited to, the “American \nMedical Association, American Nurses Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, \nAssociation of American Medical Colleges, and National Association for Home Care and \nHospice”, as well as the American Academy of PAs, American Pharmacists Association, the \nNational Hispanic Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, American \nAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.  A \ncopy of Major Health Care Professional Organizations Call for COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates \nfor All Health Workers is attached hereto as Exhibit DD. \n57)  Dr. Audiey Kao, MD, PhD, the American Medical Association’s Vice President \nof Ethics, made it clear that “Do no harm is a core ethic for all those who care for the sick and \ninjured. . . . [A]ll those working in the health care system have a fundamental obligation to \npatients by getting vaccinated for preventable diseases such as COVID-19.”  A copy the \nAmerican Medical Association’s Why COVID-19 Vaccination Should be Required for Health \nProfessionals is attached hereto as Exhibit EE.  Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, the vice provost for global \ninitiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, also emphasized that “‘No patient should have to \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 17 of 22\nworry that they could become infected by one of their care providers, and no provider should put \ntheir patient at risk.’”  Exhibit DD.  For example, the president of the American Society of \nClinical Oncology stated that “‘[p]atients with cancer need to know that their environment, \nincluding the people who care for them, is as safe as possible.’”  Id.  This collective statement \nunequivocally supports the requirement for universal vaccination of health workers.   \n58)  Other organizations have separately stated their support for healthcare worker \nvaccination requirements.  For example, the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology, \nAmerican Association of Critical-Care Nurses, National Association of Neonatal Nurses, and the \nAmerican College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.  A copy these statements are \nattached hereto as Exhibits FF-II.  These organizations have stated that vaccinations to health \ncare team members will not only reduce the burden of this disease on acute and critical -care \nunits and communities, but will prevent further harm to front line workers. Exhibit GG.  \nFurther, healthcare workers and their employers benefit from required vaccinations because \n“COVID-19 is more disruptive to the workforce and hospital/health care operations than any \ndisease encountered in the last century due to required quarantining and potential length of \nillness.”  Exhibit II.   \n59)  On July 26, 2021, the Department of Veterans Affairs mandated COVID-19 \nvaccines for health care personnel who work in Veterans Health Administration facilities, visit \nthose facilities or provide direct care to those the VA serves.  A copy of the July 26, 2021 News \nRelease is attached hereto as Exhibit JJ.  On August 12, 2021, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services Secretary announced that “more than 25,000 members of its health care \nworkforce [will be required] to be vaccinated against COVID-19.”  A copy of the August 12, \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 18 of 22\n2021 Press Release is attached hereto as Exhibit KK.  This includes staff at the Indian Health \nService and National Institutes of Health who either “interact with, or have the potential to come \ninto contact with, patients.”  Id.  The U.S. Surgeon General also immediately required “members \nof the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps” to be vaccinated.  Id. \n60)  The CDC has also recommended that healthcare personnel all receive the \nCOVID-19 vaccination, as they “continue to be on the front line of the nation’s fight against \nCOVID-19,” by “providing critical care to those who are or might be infected with the virus that \ncauses COVID-19.”  A copy of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccines for Healthcare Personnel is \nattached hereto as Exhibit LL. \n61)  The CDC has also recognized that achieving high vaccination rates in particularly \nvulnerable settings, such as long-term care facilities (“LTCF”), is of the utmost importance, since \nresidents of these facilities are at high risk for COVID-19 associated mortality.  “As of March \n2021, deaths among LTCF residents and HCP have accounted for almost one third . . . of \nCOVID-19 associated deaths in the United States.”  This is why early vaccination of these \ngroups were prioritized.  A copy of the CDC’s Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage \nAmong Health Care Personnel Working in Long-Term Care Facilities, by Job Category, \nNational Healthcare Safety Network – United States, March 2021 is attached hereto as Exhibit \nMM.   \n62)  The CDC has expressed concern that “COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in \nLTCF in which residents were highly vaccinated, but transmission occurred through \nunvaccinated staff members.”  Id.   Partial vaccination of staff provides insufficient protection. \nFor example, in Kentucky, an outbreak occurred in a skilled nursing facility with 90.4% of its \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 19 of 22\nresidents vaccinated, after introduction from “an unvaccinated, symptomatic” healthcare \nprovider.  A copy of the CDC’s COVID-19 Outbreak Associated with a SARS-CoV-2 R.1 \nLineage Variant in a Skilled Nursing Facility After Vaccination Program – Kentucky, March \n2021 is attached hereto as Exhibit NN.  The CDC’s study found that “[a]ttack rates were three to \nfour times as high among unvaccinated residents and HCP as among those who were vaccinated; \nvaccinated persons were significantly less likely to experience symptoms or require \nhospitalization.”  Id.  Ultimately, 46 residents and HCP were infected.  Id.    \n63)  Per the Emergency Regulation, current personnel are set to receive their first dose \nby September 27, 2021 for general hospitals and nursing homes, and by October 7, 2021 for all \nother covered entities.  Time is of the essence.  The Department is concerned that the numbers of \nCOVID-19 cases will continue to increase, especially given the fall and winter seasons.  The \ncold weather and upcoming holiday gatherings are likely to keep people indoors together, \nincreasing the likelihood that COVID-19 can spread from person to person, given the highly \ncontagious nature of the disease.  Additionally, as cold and flu season has arrived, the varying \nsymptoms of COVID-19 (i.e. cough, fever, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, \ncongestion or runny nose, among others) could easily be mistaken for a cold or the flu.  Again, \nthis will increase the likelihood the people with COVID-19 will go untreated for longer and in \nthe interim, potentially spread the disease to others. \n64)  Reducing the number of unvaccinated personnel who can expose vulnerable \npatients to the potentially deadly disease in the healthcare setting is of utmost importance. To \naccomplish this goal, it is imperative that the regulation limit the allowed exemptions. According \nto Dr. Kao “AMA's position is that nonmedical exemptions, such as religious or philosophic \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 20 of 22\nobjections to vaccinations, endanger the health of the unvaccinated individual and those whom \nthe individual comes in contact with, so the AMA supports legislation eliminating nonmedical \nexemptions from immunizations.” A copy of the AMA’s Audiey Kao, MD, PhD, on Mandating \nVaccines for Health Care Workers is attached hereto as Exhibit OO. \n65)  According to the CDC, the COVID-19 vaccines are safe for almost all patients. \nTo date, more than 380 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the \nUnites States.  A copy of the CDC’s Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines is attached hereto as Exhibit \nPP.  Despite the exceedingly large number of vaccinations, serious side effects have been \nextremely rare. A recent analysis by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices \nfound that the known and projected benefits of COVID-19 vaccines far outweigh potential risks. \nA copy of the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccines in Adults: Benefit-Risk Discussion is attached hereto \nas Exhibit QQ. In addition to being evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical \ntrials, the vaccines met the FDA’s rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and \nmanufacturing quality needed to support authorization of the vaccine.  Exhibit PP.  \n66)  According to Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins \nBloomberg School of Public Health, there are no immediate health issues or side effects for most \npeople with pre-existing medical conditions and the data so far shows that less than one in one \nmillion people experience the rare side effect of anaphylaxis.  A copy of ABC News’ Few \nPeople Medically Exempt from Getting COVID-19 Vaccine: Experts is attached hereto as \nExhibit RR.  The incidence of vaccine-induced Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome, \nanother rare side effect, is about .9 per million people after the Johnson & Johnson Vaccine.  A \ncopy of the American College of Cardiology’s Vaccine-Induced thrombotic Thrombocytopenia \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 21 of 22\n(VITT) and COVID-19 Vaccines: What Cardiovascular Clinicians Need to Know is attached \nhereto as Exhibit SS.  Vaccine-induced Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome has not \nbeen reported in patients who received the Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines.  Id. \nAccording to the CDC’s analysis of the risks and benefits of each of the U.S. COVID-19 \nvaccines, for every million doses of mRNA vaccine given to adults, there were only 3.5 reported \ncases of myocarditis.   Exhibit QQ.  And for every million doses of Janssen vaccine given to \nadults, there were only 3 reported cases of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome and \n7.8 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  Id.   \nCOVID-19 Vaccine for Persons Who Have Recovered from COVID-19 \n \n67)  While being infected with COVID-19 may offer some immunity, and reinfection \nis unlikely in the 90 days after initial infection, experts do not know how long that protection \nlasts.  A copy of the CDC’s Answering Patients’ Questions About COVID-19 Vaccine and \nVaccination is attached hereto as Exhibit TT.  Multiple studies have shown, however, that the \nvaccine is more effective at protecting against COVID-19 than natural immunity. According to a \nrecent report, neutralizing antibodies from people vaccinated with the Moderna COVID-19 \nvaccine bind more broadly to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain than antibodies from \npeople with prior COVID-19 infection.  A copy of Antibodies Elicited by mRNA-1273 \nVaccination Bind More Broadly to the Receptor Binding Domain Than do Those form SARS-\nCoV-2 Infection is attached hereto as Exhibit UU.  This means that vaccine-induced antibodies \nappear to be better able than infection-induced antibodies to bind to variant strains.  Id. \n68)  A cross-sectional study that monitored antibody and memory B-cell levels among \n63 people who had recovered from COVID-19 found that, although in the absence of \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 16   Filed 09/22/21   Page 22 of 22",

See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61 (Aug. 26, 2021) \n(“Section 2.61”). The State issued Section 2.61 in response to rapidly increasing infection \nrates related to the Delta variant of the virus. Section 2.61 contains an exemption for \nemployees who are unable to be safely vaccinated due to pre-existing medical \nconditions, but does not contain an exemption for those who object to this vaccination \non religious grounds. Plaintiffs, individual healthcare workers who object to receiving \nthe vaccine because of their religious beliefs, as well as a membership organization, \nfiled complaints and motions for preliminary injunctive relief, asserting that Section \n2.61 violates their rights under the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and \nthe Supremacy Clause. In We The Patriots, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of New York, the district court (Kuntz, J.) denied the motion without opinion. In \nDr. A., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, the district \ncourt (Hurd, J.) granted the motion, deciding that Plaintiffs had established that Section \n2.61 was likely neither neutral towards religion nor generally applicable, triggering \nstrict scrutiny under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, and that the State had \nfailed to establish that Section 2.61 was likely narrowly tailored to serve a compelling \ngovernment interest under strict scrutiny review. The district court in Dr. A. also \nconcluded that Section 2.61 was likely preempted by Title VII’s protection for \nemployees who require religious accommodations, and thus ran afoul of the Supremacy \nClause. \nOn appeal, focusing on the requirements for the grant of a preliminary \ninjunction, we conclude that Plaintiffs in both cases have failed to establish a likelihood \n \n2 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a ogfe 5 30 of 50\nof success on any of their claims, and thus the Dr. A. district court’s issuance of a \npreliminary injunction was in error. As to Plaintiffs’ Free Exercise claims, we conclude \nthat Plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed in establishing (1) that \nSection 2.61 is not a neutral law of general applicability, or (2) that—in the resulting \ninquiry—Section 2.61 does not satisfy rational basis review. Next, we determine that \nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their Supremacy Clause \nclaim: it appears to us fully possible for employers to comply with both Section 2.61 and \nTitle VII. Finally, we decide that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their claims that \nSection 2.61 contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment. The order of the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York is therefore AFFIRMED, the order of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of New York is REVERSED, and the preliminary \ninjunction entered by that court is VACATED. These tandem cases are REMANDED to \ntheir respective district courts for further proceedings consistent with the Order entered \nby this Court on October 29, 2021, and this Opinion. \n______________ \n \n \nCAMERON L.

See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \n§ 2.61 (Aug. 26, 2021) (“Prevention of COVID-19 transmission by covered entities”) \n(“Section 2.61” or “the Rule”). The State issued the Rule in response to rapidly \nincreasing infection rates related to the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a virus \nthat has caused widespread suffering in the State, country, and world since early 2020. \nThe State described the Rule’s purpose as primarily to preserve the health of healthcare \nworkers, and from that narrow purpose, more broadly, to keep patients and the public \nsafe from COVID-19. The Rule establishes a medical exemption to the vaccination \nrequirement, but—consistent with New York’s prior vaccination requirements for \n \n4 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P5a ogfe 5 50 of 50\nhealthcare workers—does not include an exemption based on religious belief. The Rule \npermits, but does not require, employers to make other accommodations for individuals \nwho choose not to be vaccinated based on their sincere religious beliefs.  \nThe moving parties—primarily healthcare workers allegedly affected by the \nRule—challenge the Rule’s omission of a religious exemption by asserting claims under \nthe First Amendment, the Supremacy Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment. Both \ngroups of Plaintiffs moved to enjoin enforcement of the Rule. One district court granted \nthe preliminary relief requested, enjoining the Rule insofar as it prevented healthcare \nworkers from being eligible for an exemption based on religious belief; the other denied \nit. See Dr. A. v. Hochul, No. 21-cv-1009, 2021 WL 4734404 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 2021) \n(granting preliminary injunction) (“Dr. A.”); We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, No. 21-\ncv-4954 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2021) (denying preliminary injunction) (“We The Patriots” or \n“WTP”). \nThe individual plaintiffs in Dr. A. are nurses, doctors, and other personnel \nemployed by healthcare facilities in New York State; in We The Patriots, they are three \nnurses similarly employed and a related nonprofit organization. All individual \nplaintiffs aver that to receive any one of the three currently available vaccines against \nCOVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) would violate their \nreligious beliefs because those vaccines were developed or produced using cell lines \nderived from cells obtained from voluntarily aborted fetuses. They assert that their \nemployers have threatened them with adverse employment consequences if they refuse \nto be vaccinated. \nPlaintiffs argue, and the district court in Dr. A. held, that they are likely to \nsucceed in establishing that Section 2.61 violates their rights under the Free Exercise \nClause of the First Amendment and under the Supremacy Clause. As to the Free \nExercise Clause, Plaintiffs submit that because the State has afforded a medical \n \n5 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P6a ogfe 5 60 of 50\nexemption to its requirement, the Free Exercise Clause requires the State also to afford a \nreligious exemption. With respect to the Supremacy Clause, the Dr. A. Plaintiffs argue \nthat the non-discrimination obligations placed on employers by Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. (“Title VII”) preempt the State’s vaccination \nRule. As a third basis for relief, the WTP Plaintiffs allege that the Rule infringes their \nrights to privacy and bodily integrity under the Fourteenth Amendment. Under the \nfamiliar standards for a preliminary injunction that Plaintiffs must meet to obtain such \nrelief, Plaintiffs allege that, in addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, \nthey will suffer irreparable harm absent immediate relief and that the balance of the \nequities and the public interest lie in their favor. \nThe State resists, contending primarily that Section 2.61 is a neutral provision of \ngeneral applicability to those covered by the Rule; that the Rule serves its goal and \ncompelling need to preserve the health of healthcare workers; that the medical and \nreligious exemptions would not be comparable for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause \nanalysis required by Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. \nSmith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), and its progeny; and that Plaintiffs have not shown a \nlikelihood of success on the merits on any of their claims or otherwise satisfied the \nprerequisites for entry of the exceptional relief of a preliminary injunction at this phase \nof the litigation. \nFollowing oral argument, on October 29, 2021, this Court entered an Order \ndisposing of the appeals and advising that an Opinion would follow. This Opinion \nexplains the basis for that Order. \nAs to Plaintiffs’ Free Exercise claim, we conclude that Plaintiffs have not met \ntheir burden to show that they are likely to succeed in establishing (1) that Section 2.61 \nis not a neutral law of general applicability under Smith, or (2) that—in the resulting \ninquiry—Section 2.61 does not satisfy rational basis review. Next, we determine that \n \n6 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P7a ogfe 5 70 of 50\nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their Supremacy Clause \nclaim on the record before us, as Plaintiffs have not shown that it would likely be \nimpossible for employers to comply with both Section 2.61 and Title VII. Finally, we \ndecide that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their claim that the Rule contravenes \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  \nIn light of these conclusions and of our further assessment of the irreparability of \nthe harm Plaintiffs allege, the balance of the hardships, and the public interest in \nenforcing or not enforcing the Rule, we AFFIRM the order of the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York denying the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction in We The Patriots; and we REVERSE the order of the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of New York granting Plaintiffs’ motion for the same \nrelief in Dr. A. and VACATE the related preliminary injunction entered by that court. \nFinally, we REMAND both cases to their respective district courts for further \nproceedings consistent with our October 29, 2021 Order, and this Opinion. We stress \nthat we do not now decide the ultimate merits of Plaintiffs’ legal claims or of the State’s \ndefenses; rather, we make a limited determination with respect to preliminary relief \nbased on the limited factual record presently before this Court.   \nBACKGROUND \nI.  New York’s Emergency Rule \nOn August 26, 2021, New York’s Department of Health adopted an emergency \nrule directing hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, adult care facilities, and other \nidentified healthcare entities to “continuously require” certain of their employees to be \nfully vaccinated against COVID-19 beginning on September 27, 2021, for “general \nhospitals” and nursing homes, and on October 7, 2021, for all other “covered entities” as \n \n7 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P8a ogfe 5 80 of 50\ndefined in the Rule. 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61.1 The vaccine requirement applies not to all \nemployees, but only to those covered by the Rule’s definition of “personnel”: those \nemployees, staff members, and volunteers “who engage in activities such that if they \nwere infected with COVID-19, they could potentially expose other covered personnel, \npatients or residents to the disease.” Id. § 2.61(a)(2).  \nThe Rule was issued by the State’s Public Health and Health Planning Council, a \ngroup of 25 healthcare professionals, including the Commissioner of Health, that state \nlaw charges with issuing regulations “affecting the security of life or health or the \npreservation and improvement of public health,” including those addressing the control \nof communicable diseases. N.Y. Pub. Health L. § 225(4), (5).  \nAs required by New York law, the notice of emergency rulemaking included the \nCouncil’s findings and a Regulatory Impact Statement (the “Statement”). See NYS \nAdmin. Proc. Act § 202(6). The Statement explained that the Rule responded to the \n“significant public health threat” caused by the increasing circulation of the Delta \nvariant: “Since early July, cases have risen 10-fold, and 95 percent of the sequenced \nrecent positives in New York State were the Delta variant.” Dr. A. Sp. App’x at 39. It \nalso referenced data purporting to show “that unvaccinated individuals are \napproximately 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to \nvaccinated individuals” and that “[t]hose who are unvaccinated have over 11 times the \nrisk of being hospitalized with COVID-19.” Id. It described vaccination as critical to \ncontrolling the spread of the disease at healthcare facilities and in congregate care \nsettings, which “pose increased challenges and urgency for controlling the spread of \nthis disease because of [their] vulnerable patient and resident populations,” \ndetermining that “[u]nvaccinated personnel in such settings have an unacceptably high \n \n1 The complete text of Section 2.61 is provided in an Appendix to this Opinion. \n \n8 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P9a ogfe 5 90 of 50\nrisk of both acquiring COVID-19 and transmitting the virus to colleagues and/or \nvulnerable patients or residents, exacerbating staffing shortages, and causing \nunacceptably high risk of complications.” Id. As an emergency rule, Section 2.61 is in \neffect for a maximum of 90 days, expiring on November 23, 2021, unless renewed. See \nid. at 38; NYS Admin. Proc. Act § 202(6)(b). \nSection 2.61 exempts from the vaccination requirement “personnel” for whom \n“immunization with COVID-19 vaccine is detrimental to [their] health . . . , based upon \na pre-existing health condition” as more specifically defined and limited by the Rule. 10 \nN.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61(d)(1).2 The medical exemption applies “only until such immunization \nis found no longer to be detrimental to [their] health.” Id. It must be supported with a \ncertification by a licensed physician or certified nurse practitioner issued in accordance \n \n2 The full text of this medical exemption under Section 2.61(d)(1) reads as follows: \n(1) Medical  exemption.  If  any  licensed  physician  or  certified  nurse \npractitioner  certifies  that  immunization  with  COVID-19  vaccine  is \ndetrimental to the health of member of a covered entity’s personnel, based \nupon a pre-existing health condition, the requirements of this section relating \nto  COVID-19  immunization  shall  be  inapplicable  only  until  such \nimmunization  is  found  no  longer  to  be  detrimental  to  such  personnel \nmember’s health. The nature and duration of the medical exemption must be \nstated in the personnel employment medical record, or other appropriate \nrecord,  and  must  be  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  medical \nstandards,  (see,  for  example,  the  recommendations  of  the  Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services), and any reasonable accommodation may be granted and \nmust  likewise  be  documented  in  such  record.  Covered  entities  shall \ndocument medical exemptions in personnel records or other appropriate \nrecords in accordance with applicable privacy laws by: (i) September 27, 2021 \nfor general hospitals and nursing homes; and (ii) October 7, 2021 for all other \ncovered  entities.  For  all  covered  entities,  documentation  must  occur \ncontinuously, as needed, following the initial dates for compliance specified \nherein, including documentation of any reasonable accommodation therefor. \n10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61(d)(1). \n \n9 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P1a0g oef  1500 of 50\nwith generally accepted medical standards, including recommendations of the \nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) of the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services.

Section 2.61 contains no “exemption” for personnel who \noppose vaccination on religious or any other grounds not covered by the medical \nexemption; however, as we discuss below, the Rule does not prohibit employers from \nproviding religious objectors with accommodations. \nOn August 18, 2021, eight days before the Council promulgated Section 2.61, New \nYork State Commissioner of Health Dr. Howard A. Zucker, acting alone, had issued an \n“Order for Summary Action” (“the August 18 Order” or “the Order”) under the \nauthority vested in him by New York Public Health Law § 16. See Dr. A. Sp. App’x at \n41–47. Section 16 permits the Commissioner to issue a short-term order—effective for a \nmaximum of 15 days—if he identifies a condition that in his view constitutes a “danger \nto the health of the people.” N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 16. After making findings about \nthe dangers of COVID-19, the Order similarly required certain healthcare facilities to \nensure that certain personnel were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by September 27, \n2021, but differed from Section 2.61, which superseded it, in several respects. Most \nrelevant here, the Order included a religious exemption for personnel who “hold a \ngenuine and sincere religious belief contrary to the practice of immunization.” Dr. A. \nSp. App’x at 45–46. In addition, the Order could be effective for only a very brief period \nof time—for up to 15 days—whereas the Rule could be in effect for up to 90 days, \nsubject to extensions. Further, the Order applied only to “general hospital[s]” and \nnursing homes; Section 2.61 applies more broadly, to all hospitals, nursing homes, \n \n10 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P1a1g oef  1510 of 50\ndiagnostic and treatment centers, home healthcare agencies and similar programs, \nhospices, and adult care facilities. Id. at 43; 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61(a)(1).  \nIn affidavits appended to its briefing to this Court and filed in other pending \nproceedings,3 the State has provided preliminary vaccination data from the months of \nAugust through October 2021. It reflects a significant increase in vaccination rates \namong covered healthcare personnel that occurred after the Rule’s effective date on \nSeptember 27 (even though the Rule was subject to the temporary restraining order and \nlater injunction issued in Dr. A.). As of August 24, the State’s declarant reported, 71% of \nworkers at nursing homes and 77% of workers at adult care facilities had received at \nleast one dose of the vaccine; 77% of workers at hospitals were fully vaccinated. See \nWTP Appellees’ Add. at 14–15 (Decl. of Elizabeth Rausch-Phung). As of October 19, \n97.4% of workers at nursing homes and 96.7% of workers at adult care facilities had \nreceived at least one dose of the vaccine, and 91.4% of workers at hospitals were fully \nvaccinated. See Serafin v. New York State Dep’t of Health, Index No. 908296-21, Doc. Nos. \n56. (Decl. of Valerie A. Deetz), 57 (Decl. of Dorothy Persico) (Sup. Ct. Albany County \nOct. 20, 2021). Also as of October 19, between 0.4% and 0.5% of workers at each facility \n \n3 We may take judicial notice of the existence of affidavits filed in another court. See Glob. \nNetwork Commc'ns, Inc. v. City of New York, 458 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, our \nCourt has ruled that courts may consider hearsay evidence such as affidavits when determining \nwhether to grant a preliminary injunction. See Mullins v. City of New York, 626 F.3d 47, 52 (2d \nCir. 2010); see also Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) (observing that preliminary \ninjunctive determinations may be based on “procedures that are less formal and evidence that is \nless complete than in a trial on the merits”). Thus, we consider the State’s data submitted in \naffidavits filed in other courts. Although this data was not before the district court in WTP—and \ntherefore Plaintiffs have not had an opportunity to contest its accuracy before the district \ncourt—they have not raised such a concern in their reply brief in WTP or at oral argument, nor \nhave they challenged this Court’s ability to consider the State’s submissions. More broadly, \nPlaintiffs do not appear to contest the State’s assertion derived from this data that religious \nexemptions are more common than medical exemptions, but instead consider this fact \nirrelevant.  \n \n11 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P1a2g oef  1520 of 50\ntype were medically ineligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 1.9% of \nworkers at nursing homes and adult care facilities and 1.3% of workers at hospitals \nclaimed “other” exemptions, which the State describes as reflecting religious \nexemptions permitted by the injunction entered in Dr. A. Id.  \nII.  The District Court Proceedings \nPlaintiffs in We The Patriots are a membership organization and three nurses \nworking in hospital facilities in New York State.4 Plaintiffs in Dr. A. are nurses, doctors, \nand others employed at healthcare facilities in New York State. In both cases, the \ndefendants include Governor Kathleen Hochul and Commissioner Zucker; the Dr. A. \nPlaintiffs also named New York Attorney General Letitia James as a defendant.  \nAll Plaintiffs assert that they object on religious grounds to receiving the COVID-\n19 vaccines as briefly described above. As public health authorities have explained, in \nthe 1970s and 1980s, cell lines were derived from fetal cells obtained from elective \nabortions or miscarriages.5 These cell lines have since been used in the development of \nvarious vaccines.6 They were used for testing in the research and development phase of \n \n4 Plaintiff We The Patriots USA, Inc., states that it is a section 501(c)(3) organization that “is \ndedicated to promoting constitutional rights and other freedoms through education, outreach, \nand public interest litigation, thereby advancing religious freedom, medical freedom, parental \nrights, and educational freedom for all.” WTP App’x at 8. \n5 See, e.g., Los Angeles County Dep’t of Pub.

Diane \nBono and Michelle Melendez are employed at Syosset Hospital in Syosset, and Michelle \nSynakowski is employed at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Syracuse. On September 2, 2021, one \nweek after the Rule was adopted, Plaintiffs sued Governor Hochul and Commissioner \nZucker in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging \nthat the Rule violates their First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely. They \nalso charged that it violates their rights to privacy and “medical freedom,” which they \nlocate in the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. They asked the district \n \npurpose of vaccine development.” Los Angeles County Dep’t of Pub. Health, COVID-19 Vaccine \nand Fetal Cell Lines, supra note 5.  \n7 The use of these cell lines was explained in press statements and publicly available research \nduring the development of the COVID-19 vaccines.

They \nargued that immediate relief was essential because Section 2.61 puts them at imminent \nrisk of losing their jobs if they persist in refusing vaccination. In support of their motion, \nthey provided letters from Nurse Bono’s and Nurse Melendez’s employer, Northwell \nHealth, a private entity.8 In the letter received by Nurse Bono, dated August 31, \nNorthwell Health advised that her “continued employment will be at risk” if she did \nnot receive the vaccine by the deadline. WTP App’x 32. In its letter to Nurse Melendez, \ndated August 30, Northwell Health wrote only that Nurse Melendez would be required \nto undergo weekly PCR testing and would be unable to participate in certain meetings, \ngatherings, and events based on her vaccination status.9 \nThe district court denied Plaintiffs’ motion on September 12, the day it was filed, \nwithout explanation and without ordering or receiving a response from the State. \nPlaintiffs timely appealed. \nB.  Dr. A. v.

The WTP Plaintiffs also assert that Nurse Synakowski \nwas informed by her employer that her employment would be terminated by September 21 if \nshe was not vaccinated by then, but in their briefs filed since that date they have not stated \nwhether that came to pass. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P1a5g oef  1550 of 50\nand injunctive relief preventing the enforcement of the Rule.10 In their verified \ncomplaint, they alleged three bases of unconstitutionality. First, they contended that the \nRule infringes on religious rights secured by the Free Exercise Clause by requiring that \nthey be vaccinated, contrary to their religious beliefs. Second, they claimed that Section \n2.61 violates the Supremacy Clause because it is preempted by Title VII, which prohibits \ndiscrimination in employment based on religion. Third, they claimed that Section 2.61 \nruns afoul of the Equal Protection Clause because it prevents them from seeking a \nreligious accommodation while at the same time allowing similarly situated healthcare \nworkers to seek a medical accommodation.  \nThe Dr. A. Plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order \nand preliminary injunction. They sought immediate injunctive relief, citing “imminent \nirreparable harm from loss of employment and professional standing” as a result of \ntheir “religiously motivated refusal to be vaccinated.” Dr. A. App’x at 207.  \nOn September 14, the district court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary \nrestraining order, enjoining the State from enforcing any requirement that employers \ndeny religious exemptions from the vaccine requirement or that employers revoke any \nreligious exemption already granted, and directed the State to file its opposition to \nPlaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. Six days later, the district court extended \nthe temporary restraining order for 14 days, pending its written opinion on Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for a preliminary injunction to be issued on or before October 12. \nOn October 12, the district court issued the requested preliminary injunction, \nresting in part on its determination that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Free \nExercise claim. The district court concluded that Plaintiffs had established that Section \n \n10 The district court granted a request by the Dr. A. Plaintiffs to proceed pseudonymously. The \nDr. A.

It also ruled that Section \n2.61 is likely to fail strict scrutiny. See Dr. A., 2021 WL 4734404, at *8–9. The district court \nfurther concluded that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Title VII preemption \nclaim, reasoning that Section 2.61 “effectively foreclose[s] the pathway to seek[] a \nreligious accommodation that is guaranteed under Title VII.” Id. at *6.11  \nThe State timely appealed.12 \nDISCUSSION \nIssuance of a preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy” \nthat is “never awarded as of right.” Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689–90 (2008) (quoting \n11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948, at 129 (2d \ned. 1995)).

Motion Order, WTP, No. 21-2179, Dkt. No. 65 (Sept. 30, 2021). Oral \nargument on their appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction was scheduled to be heard \non an expedited basis on October 14 by a duly convened regular argument panel—the panel \nthat now files this opinion per curiam. Case Calendaring, WTP, No. 21-2179, Dkt. No. 68. When \nthe district court in the Northern District granted the Dr. A. Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary \ninjunction on October 12, the State promptly appealed. Notice of Appeal, Dr. A., No. 21-2566, \nDkt. No. 1. Because the two cases request virtually identical relief and offer overlapping \narguments, we determined not to hear the WTP Plaintiffs’ appeal on October 14, separate from \nthe State appeal in Dr. A., but rather to hear the cases in tandem. We scheduled the combined \noral argument for October 27, again on an expedited basis and with full briefing by the Dr. A. \nPlaintiffs and the State. Order, WTP, No. 21-2179, Dkt.

When deciding whether to issue a preliminary \ninjunction, courts “should pay particular regard for the public consequences in \nemploying the extraordinary remedy of injunction.” Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction that “will affect government action taken in \nthe public interest pursuant to a statute or regulatory scheme, the moving party must \ndemonstrate (1) irreparable harm absent injunctive relief, (2) a likelihood of success on \nthe merits, and (3) public interest weighing in favor of granting the injunction.”13 \nAgudath Israel of Am. v. Cuomo, 983 F.3d 620, 631 (2d Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). The movant must also show that the balance of equities supports the issuance \nof an injunction. See Yang v. Kosinski, 960 F.3d 119, 127 (2d Cir. 2020). We review the \ngrant or denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. See \nFreedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 114 (2d Cir. 2005). A district court has \nexceeded the permissible bounds of its discretion when its “decision rests on an error of \nlaw (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual \nfinding” or “cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.” \n \n13 In Dr. A., the district court applied the likelihood-of-success standard, and the Dr. A. Plaintiffs \ndo not now argue that this was error. The parties in WTP, in contrast, cite our Court’s \nalternative, less demanding “serious questions” standard for obtaining preliminary injunctive \nrelief, which authorizes injunctive relief if the movant has shown imminent irreparable harm as \nwell as “sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its claims to make them fair ground \nfor litigation, plus a balance of the hardships tipping decidedly in favor of the moving party.” \nNew York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, 787 F.3d 638, 650 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). But we have consistently applied the likelihood-of-success standard to cases \nchallenging government actions taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or \nregulatory scheme, including in cases involving emergency regulations and orders. See, e.g., \nAgudath Israel, 983 F.3d at 631; Alleyne v. New York State Educ. Dep’t, 516 F.3d 96, 99–101 (2d Cir. \n2008). The WTP parties have not explained why the “serious questions” standard should \nnonetheless govern here. Accordingly, in our review of both appeals, we apply the likelihood-\nof-success standard. \n \n17 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P1a8g oef  1580 of 50\nMastrovincenzo v. City of New York, 435 F.3d 78, 88 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nBecause the issues and arguments presented by these two appeals overlap \nsubstantially, we consider them together, issue by issue, differentiating between them \nonly as we think necessary.14 \nI.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Free Exercise of Religion Claim \nPlaintiffs contend that Section 2.61 violates their rights under the Free Exercise \nClause of the First Amendment because it does not include an exemption for employees \nwho oppose receiving the vaccine on religious grounds. \nOn a motion for preliminary injunction, the movants must show that they are \nlikely to prevail on their claim that the challenged government action is unlawful. On \nthe record before us, we conclude that neither the Dr. A. Plaintiffs nor the WTP \nPlaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on their Free Exercise claims such that \nthey are entitled to the “extraordinary relief” of a preliminary injunction. The district \ncourt’s conclusion to the contrary in Dr. A. was legal error and rested on clearly \nerroneous findings of fact.  \nA.  The Smith Standard \nThe First Amendment forbids the enactment of laws, either state or federal, that \n“prohibit[] the free exercise” of religion.15 U.S. Const., amend. I. But not all laws that \n \n14 Although the district court’s order denying the WTP Plaintiffs’ motion did not state the basis \nfor its decision, we may “affirm on any ground supported by the record.” NXIVM Corp. v. Ross \nInst., 364 F.3d 471, 476 (2d Cir. 2004). \n15 In relevant part, the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting \nan establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The stricture has been \n \n18 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P1a9g oef  1590 of 50\nburden an individual’s exercise of religion contravene this deeply rooted prohibition. \nNor do they always trigger heightened scrutiny. The Supreme Court has long applied \nthe standard set out by Justice Scalia for the Court in Employment Division v. Smith to \ndetermine whether a democratically enacted law that burdens religious practice is \nproperly considered under rational basis review or strict scrutiny. See 494 U.S. at 879; \nFulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1876 (2021). \nUnder Smith, a “neutral law of general applicability” is subject to rational basis \nreview even if it incidentally burdens a particular religious practice. 494 U.S. at 878–79; \nsee also Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993). \nWe have observed that “[t]he teaching of Smith is that a state can determine that a \ncertain harm should be prohibited generally, and a citizen is not, under the auspices of \nher religion, constitutionally entitled to an exemption.” Central Rabbinical Congress of the \nU.S. & Canada v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Health & Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 196 (2d Cir. 2014). \nBut if a law is not neutral towards religion or is not generally applicable, it falls outside \nthe boundaries of Smith. Then, for such a law to survive, it “must be justified by a \ncompelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that \ninterest.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531–32. \nBecause they seek a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs bear the initial burden of \nestablishing a likelihood of success on the merits. In the context of their First \nAmendment claim, this means that Plaintiffs must show that they are likely to succeed \non their claim that Section 2.61 is not a neutral or generally applicable rule. If they \nsucceed at that step, the burden shifts to the State to show that it is likely to succeed in \ndefending the challenged Rule under strict scrutiny. Cf. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita \nBeneficente Uniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429 (2006) (“[T]he burdens at the preliminary \n \nheld to limit the authorities of the states as well. See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 \n(1940). \n \n19 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a0g oef  2500 of 50\ninjunction stage track the burdens at trial.”). We conclude that, at this stage, Plaintiffs \nhave not carried their initial burden of showing that Section 2.61 is likely not neutral or \ngenerally applicable. \nB.  Neutrality \nThe State “fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of \nreligious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature.” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. \nat 1877; see also Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 532 (First Amendment protections apply when “the \nlaw at issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits \nconduct because it is undertaken for religious reasons”). A law may be not neutral if it \nexplicitly singles out a religious practice, but even a facially neutral law will run afoul of \nthe neutrality principle if it “targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment.” \nLukumi, 508 U.S. at 533–34. \nThe Supreme Court has explained that “[a] law lacks facial neutrality if it refers \nto a religious practice without a secular meaning discernable from the language or \ncontext.” Id. at 533. Section 2.61 is facially neutral because it does not single out \nemployees who decline vaccination on religious grounds. It applies to all “personnel,” \nas carefully defined in the Rule, aside from those who qualify for the narrowly framed \nmedical exemption.  \nPlaintiffs nonetheless maintain that the regulation “targets” them because of \ntheir religious opposition to receiving any one of the three currently available COVID-\n19 vaccines. In support, they point to events preceding the enactment of Section 2.61 \nand to several of Governor Hochul’s public comments during the month of September \nas reflective of discriminatory intent on the part of the State. We take these claims in \norder. \n \n20 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a1g oef  2510 of 50\nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that the fact that the August 18 Order contained a religious \nexemption, but Section 2.61 does not, demonstrates that in Section 2.61 the State \nintended to “target” those who object to vaccination on religious grounds, and that this \nreflects anti-religion animus. The district court in Dr. A. agreed, finding that the \ndifference between the two government actions amounted to a “religious \ngerrymander.” Dr. A., 2021 WL 4734404, at *8 (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 535). \nSpecifically, the district court determined that Section 2.61, enacted eight days after the \nAugust 18 Order, intentionally “amended the [August 18 Order] to eliminate the \nreligious exemption.” Id. As a result, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs had \nestablished a likelihood that Section 2.61 was non-neutral based on their argument that \nit “effectively targets religious opposition to the available COVID-19 vaccines.” Id.   \nIn Lukumi, the Supreme Court determined that the municipal ordinance at issue, \nwhich prohibited animal sacrifice, was not neutral because it effectively prohibited \nconduct only undertaken by adherents to the Santeria religion as a part of their religious \npractice. See 508 U.S. at 534–35. In contrast, Section 2.61 requires all covered employees \nwho can safely receive the vaccine to be vaccinated. It applies whether an employee is \neager to be vaccinated or strongly opposed, and it applies whether an employee’s \nopposition or reluctance is due to philosophical or political objections to vaccine \nrequirements, concerns about the vaccine’s efficacy or potential side effects, or religious \nbeliefs. The absence of a religious exception to a law does not, on its own, establish non-\nneutrality such that a religious exception is constitutionally required.  \nFurther, that the August 18 Order contained a religious exemption, while Section \n2.61 does not, falls short of rendering Section 2.61 non-neutral. The historical \nbackground of Section 2.61, to be determined following discovery, may be relevant to \nfully discerning the State’s intent, but the evidence before the district courts failed to \nraise an inference that the regulation was intended to be a “covert suppression of \n \n21 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a2g oef  2520 of 50\nparticular religious beliefs.” New Hope Family Servs., Inc. v. Poole, 966 F.3d 145, 163 (2d \nCir. 2020) (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534). In suggesting that Section 2.61 “eliminated” \nthe religious exemption, WTP Appellants’ Br. at 10, Plaintiffs misconstrue the \nconnection between the August 18 Order and the August 26 Rule.16 The August 18 \nOrder was issued by Commissioner Zucker alone as an emergency measure, intended \nto be in place for a maximum of 15 days, in response to reports of the surging Delta \nvariant. Section 2.61, in contrast, was issued following collective deliberation by the 25-\nmember Public Health and Health Planning Council under the emergency rulemaking \nprocedures set forth in New York law, which provided more process, public input, and \nsupport for a measure that would be effective for 90 days subject to renewal. These \nprocedures required the Council, among other things, to develop and issue specific \nfindings and a regulatory impact statement. NYS Admin. Proc. Act § 202(6)(iv), (viii). \nAfter this extensive process, the full Council came to the conclusion that the vaccine \nrequirement should apply to a broader set of healthcare entities and, consistent with the \nState’s highly effective existing vaccine requirements for measles and rubella (issued \nwith no religious exemption), see 10 N.Y.C.R.R. §§ 405.3, 415.26, 751.6, 763.13, 766.11, \n794.3, 1001.11, should not contain a religious exemption. The Council did not amend the \nAugust 18 Order: rather, it independently promulgated a new Rule. The record before \nthe district courts does not demonstrate that the Rule was intended to “target” \n \n16 In a recent decision, the First Circuit similarly misunderstood the connection between the \nAugust 18 Order and August 26 Rule when attempting to distinguish the New York vaccination \nmandate from the Maine vaccination mandate. See Does 1-6 v. Mills, — F.4th —, 2021 WL \n4860328 (1st Cir. Oct. 19, 2021), application for injunctive relief denied sub nom. Does 1-3 v. Mills, — \nS. Ct. —, No. 21A90, 2021 WL 5027177 (Oct. 29, 2021). The First Circuit mistakenly wrote, “Eight \ndays after New York officials promulgated a version of the regulation containing a religious \nexemption, they amended the regulation to eliminate the religious exemption.” Id. at *9. \nHowever, as we explain above, there was no “amending” of the regulation to remove a \nreligious exemption. Rather, the August 18 Order and the August 26 Rule were issued through \ntwo separate processes. \n \n22 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a3g oef  2530 of 50\nindividuals opposed to receiving the COVID-19 vaccines because of their religious \nbeliefs.  \nAdditionally, much occurred in the time between August 18 and August 26: \nformer Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned and Governor Hochul assumed office;17 the \nFDA gave full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for individuals 16 years of age \nand older;18 and the Delta variant continued its spread, becoming the dominant strain of \nthe virus in the State.19 Even if the differing August 18 and August 26 requirements can \nbe said to represent a shift in the State’s policy position, Plaintiffs have not adduced \nfacts establishing that the change stemmed from religious intolerance, rather than an \nintent to more fully ensure that employees at healthcare facilities receive the vaccine in \nfurtherance of the State’s public health goals.20 \nSecond, on appeal, Plaintiffs assert that certain comments made by Governor \nHochul in September reveal that Section 2.61 was intended to target them because of \ntheir religious opposition to the required vaccination.21 Some of those comments, \n \n17 New York State Governor’s Office, Video, Audio, Photos & Rush Transcript: Kathy Hochul Is \nSworn in as 57th Governor of New York State (Aug. 24, 2021), \nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-kathy-hochul-sworn-\n57th-governor-new-york-state. \n18 Press Release, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA Approves First COVID-19 Vaccine \n(Aug. 23, 2021), https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-\ncovid-19-vaccine.   \n19 See Dr. A. Sp. App’x at 39.  \n20 This is another area in which factual development can be expected to shed more light on the \ncircumstances surrounding the creation of both the Order and the Rule and validate or disprove \nPlaintiffs’ allegations.  \n21 Governor Hochul made the statements at issue after both the Dr. A. Plaintiffs and the WTP \nPlaintiffs filed their preliminary injunction motions. \n \n23 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a4g oef  2540 of 50\nhowever, did not relate to Section 2.61 or workplace vaccine requirements at all, \nincluding Governor Hochul’s statements at church services in which she urged those in \nattendance to get vaccinated.22 Governor Hochul’s expression of her own religious \nbelief as a moral imperative to become vaccinated cannot reasonably be understood to \nimply an intent on the part of the State to target those with religious beliefs contrary to \nhers; otherwise, politicians’ frequent use of religious rhetoric to support their positions \nwould render many government actions “non-neutral” under Smith. At a press briefing \non September 15, in which she responded to the temporary restraining order issued in \nDr. A., Governor Hochul stated her “personal opinion” that no religious exemption is \nrequired and that she was “not aware of” any “sanctioned religious exemption from \nany organized religion.”23 This comment simply mirrors the State’s litigation position \nand conveys the fact—which Plaintiffs do not contest—that many religious leaders have \nstated that vaccination is consistent with their faiths.24 Governor Hochul’s comments \nmay more reasonably be understood to express general support for religious principles \n \n22 See New York State Governor’s Office, Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Attends Service at \nChristian Cultural Center (Sept. 26, 2021), https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/rush-transcript-\ngovernor-hochul-attends-service-christian-cultural-center; New York State Governor’s Office, \nVideo, Audio, Photos & Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Attends Services at Abyssinian \nBaptist Church in Harlem (Sept. 12, 2021), https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-\nphotos-rush-transcript-governor-hochul-attends-services-abyssinian-baptist-church.  \n23 See New York State Governor’s Office, Video & Rush Transcript: Governor Hochul Holds \nQ&A Following COVID-19 Briefing (Sept. 15, 2021), https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-\nrough-transcript-governor-hochul-holds-qa-following-covid-19-briefing. \n24 See, e.g., Devin Watkins, Pope Francis Urges People to Get Vaccinated Against Covid-19, Vatican \nNews (Aug. 18, 2021), https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2021-08/popefrancis-appeal-\ncovid-19-vaccines-act-of-love.html; Chairmen of the Committee on Doctrine and the Committee \non Pro-Life Activities, Moral Considerations Regarding the New COVID-19 Vaccines, U.S. Conf. of \nCatholic Bishops (Dec. 11, 2020), https://www.usccb.org/moral-considerations-covid-vaccines. \n \n24 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a5g oef  2550 of 50\nthat she believes guide community members to care for one another by receiving the \nCOVID-19 vaccine. \nAltogether, Governor Hochul’s comments, even considered in light of the \ndiffering approaches taken by Commissioner Zucker in the August 18 Order and the \nfull Council in the Rule, do not evince animosity towards particular religious practices \nor a desire to target religious objectors to the vaccine requirement because of their \nreligious beliefs. Rather, they suggest that the State wanted more people to obtain the \nvaccine out of a deep concern for public health, which is a religion-neutral government \ninterest. \nWe therefore conclude that Plaintiffs at this stage have not carried their burden \nof establishing that Section 2.61 is likely not neutral. The district court’s contrary \nconclusion in Dr. A. was based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the record before it. \nC.  General Applicability \nAs the Supreme Court recently explained in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, a law \nmay not be “generally applicable” under Smith for either of two reasons: first, “if it \ninvites the government to consider the particular reasons for a person’s conduct by \nproviding a mechanism for individualized exemptions”; or, second, “if it prohibits \nreligious conduct while permitting secular conduct that undermines the government’s \nasserted interests in a similar way.” 141 S. Ct. at 1877 (internal quotation marks and \nalterations omitted). Here, Plaintiffs’ argument, in substance, is that because Section \n2.61 includes a medical exemption, it is not “generally applicable.” \n1.  Whether Section 2.61 Permits “Comparable” Secular Conduct \nThe general applicability requirement “protects religious observers against \nunequal treatment, and inequality that results when a legislature decides that the \ngovernmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being pursued only against \n \n25 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a6g oef  2560 of 50\nconduct with a religious motivation.” Central Rabbinical Congress, 763 F.3d at 196–97 \n(alterations omitted) (quoting Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 542–43).25 “A law is therefore not \ngenerally applicable if it is substantially underinclusive such that it regulates religious \nconduct while failing to regulate secular conduct that is at least as harmful to the \nlegitimate government interests purportedly justifying it.” Id. at 197. As the Supreme \nCourt stated in a recent order, “whether two activities are comparable for purposes of \nthe Free Exercise Clause must be judged against the asserted government interest that \njustifies the regulation at issue.” Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1296 (2021). \n“Comparability is concerned with the risks various activities pose.” Id. Notably, in \nSmith, a law criminalizing controlled substance possession was deemed generally \napplicable even though it contained an exception for substances prescribed for medical \npurposes. 494 U.S. at 874, 878–82. \nThe State alleges that the following interests underlie its adoption of Section 2.61. \nFirst, it seeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities among staff, \npatients, and residents. Second, by protecting the health of healthcare employees to \nensure they are able to continue working, it aims to reduce the risk of staffing shortages \nthat can compromise the safety of patients and residents even beyond a COVID-19 \ninfection. Thus, the State maintains, the medical and any religious exemption differ in \n \n25 Plaintiffs suggest that our decision in Central Rabbinical Congress was overruled by the \nSupreme Court’s orders in Roman Catholic Diocese and Tandon. But Central Rabbinical Congress’s \nformulation of the standard for identifying “comparable secular activity”—“secular conduct \nthat is at least as harmful [as religious conduct] to the legitimate government interests \npurportedly justifying it,” 763 F.3d at 197—is consistent with the Supreme Court’s statements in \nboth of those cases. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) \n(stating that less-regulated factories, schools, and shopping centers were much more crowded \nthan churches and synagogues or had contributed to the spread of COVID-19, in contrast to the \nreligious institutions’ “admirable safety records”); Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1297 (2021) \n(considering secular activities comparable where they were not found to “pose a lesser risk of \ntransmission than [plaintiffs’] proposed religious exercise at home”). \n \n26 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a7g oef  2570 of 50\nan important respect: applying the Rule to those who oppose vaccination on religious \ngrounds furthers the State’s asserted interests, whereas applying the Rule to those \nsubject to medical contraindications or precautions based on pre-existing conditions \nwould undermine the government’s asserted interest in protecting the health of covered \npersonnel. Cf. Does 1-6 v. Mills, — F.4th —, 2021 WL 4860328, at *6 (1st Cir. Oct. 19, \n2021), application for injunctive relief denied sub nom. Does 1-3 v. Mills, — S. Ct. —, No. \n21A90, 2021 WL 5027177 (Oct. 29, 2021). Vaccinating a healthcare employee who is \nknown or expected to be injured by the vaccine would harm her health and make it less \nlikely she could work. The State identified these objectives in the Regulatory Impact \nStatement accompanying the emergency rulemaking, and Plaintiffs do not point to any \nevidence suggesting that the interests asserted are pretextual or should otherwise be \ndisregarded in the comparability analysis. Accordingly, the State makes a reasonable \ncase that Section 2.61 contains a medical exemption not because it determined that “the \ngovernmental interests it seeks to advance are worthy of being pursued only against \nconduct with a religious motivation,” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 543, but because applying the \nvaccination requirement to individuals with medical contraindications and precautions \nwould not effectively advance those interests. Indeed, applying the vaccine to \nindividuals in the face of certain contraindications, depending on their nature, could \nrun counter to the State’s “interest in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical \nprofession.”  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157 (2007) (quoting Washington v. \nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 731 (1997)); see also Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38–39 \n(1905) (recognizing that the state may not be permitted to require vaccination of \nindividuals with contraindications). \nImportantly, the State has also presented evidence that raises the possibility that \nthe exemptions are not comparable in terms of the “risk” that they pose. See Tandon, 141 \nS. Ct. at 1296. It notes that the medical exemption is defined to be limited in duration, as \n \n27 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a8g oef  2580 of 50\nthe vaccine requirement is “inapplicable only until such immunization is found no \nlonger to be detrimental to such personnel member’s health.” 10 N.Y.C.R.R. § 2.61(d)(1). \nAlthough some of the contraindications and precautions identified by ACIP and \nincorporated into the Department of Health guidance are long-term health conditions, \nothers are in fact explicitly temporary, such as having a current moderate-to-severe \nacute illness.26 In contrast, a sincerely held religious belief that vaccination is \ninconsistent with one’s religion is unlikely to change to permit vaccination in the future, \nabsent the approval of new vaccines that are developed in a different way. The statistics \nprovided by the State further indicate that medical exemptions are likely to be more \nlimited in number than religious exemptions, and that high numbers of religious \nexemptions appear to be clustered in particular geographic areas. See Dr. A. Appellants’ \nReply Br. at 13 (citing Serafin, Index No. 908296-21, Doc. No. 57 (Decl. of Dorothy \nPersico)) (ratios of religious exemptions to medical exemptions among Erie County and \nMonroe County hospital workers were 18 to 1 and 23 to 1, respectively).27  \nAs a result, it may be feasible for healthcare entities to manage the COVID-19 \nrisks posed by a small set of objectively defined and largely time-limited medical \nexemptions. In contrast, it could pose a significant barrier to effective disease \nprevention to permit a much greater number of permanent religious exemptions, \nwhich, according to the State’s evidence, appear more commonly sought in certain \nlocations. See Serafin, Index No. 908296-21, Doc. No. 57 (Decl. of Dorothy Persico). \nAlthough these differences may, after factual development, be shown to be too \ninsignificant to render the exemptions incomparable, the limited evidence now before \n \n26 See FAQs, supra at 10.  \n27 As discussed, Plaintiffs do not contest the State’s assertion that higher numbers of employees \nclaim religious exemptions than medical exemptions. See supra note 3. \n \n28 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P2a9g oef  2590 of 50\nus suggests that the medical exemption is not “as harmful to the legitimate government \ninterests purportedly justifying” the Rule as a religious exemption would be. Central \nRabbinical Congress, 763 F.3d at 197. \nIn their efforts to show a likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs counter \nthat Section 2.61, by providing a medical but not a religious exemption, effectively \nprohibits religion-based refusals of vaccination while permitting “comparable” refusals \non secular grounds. To establish comparability under Smith, Plaintiffs rely heavily on \nthe general—and reasonable—proposition that any individual unvaccinated employee \nis likely to present statistically comparable risks of both contracting and spreading \nCOVID-19 at any given healthcare facility, irrespective of the reason that the employee \nis unvaccinated. In Plaintiffs’ view, the Supreme Court’s orders in Roman Catholic \nDiocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo and Tandon v. Newsom require us to confine our analysis to \nevaluating the risk of COVID-19 transmission posed by each unvaccinated individual. \nBoth of those cases involved challenges to occupancy limits placed on religious \nservices, in an effort to curb COVID-19 transmission indoors, which were not applied to \nsecular businesses with similarly high capacities. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn \nv. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020); Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1297. Unlike Plaintiffs’ proposed \nanalysis here, however, Roman Catholic Diocese and Tandon did not involve a one-to-one \ncomparison of the transmission risk posed by an individual worshipper and, for \nexample, an individual grocery shopper. The Supreme Court’s discussion in those \ncases, which compared the risks posed by groups of various sizes in various settings, \nsuggests the appropriateness of considering aggregate data about transmission risks. \nSee, e.g., Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. Ct. at 66–67 (comparing “a large store in Brooklyn \nthat could literally have hundreds of people shopping there on any given day” with “a \nnearby church or synagogue [that] would be prohibited from allowing more than 10 or \n25 people for a worship service”). We doubt that, as an epidemiological matter, the \n \n29 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a0g oef  3500 of 50\nnumber of people seeking exemptions is somehow excluded from the factors that the \nState must take into account in assessing the relative risks to the health of healthcare \nworkers and the efficacy of its vaccination strategy in actually preventing the spread of \ndisease. The record before us contains only limited data regarding the prevalence of \nmedical ineligibility and religious objections, but what data we do have indicates that \nclaims for religious exemptions are far more numerous. \nFurther, Tandon expressly instructs courts to consider “the asserted government \ninterest that justifies the regulation at issue” when determining whether two activities \nare comparable for Free Exercise Clause purposes. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1296. By \nconfining their discussion of comparability to individual risk of transmission alone, \nPlaintiffs fail to engage with the reasons above, persuasive to us, that substantially \ndistinguish the medically ineligible from the religious objectors in light of the State’s \nasserted purposes. At this stage, Plaintiffs do not meaningfully challenge the legitimacy \nof the government’s asserted interest in protecting the health of workers and \nmaintaining staffing levels, or the proposition that requiring those who have been \ngranted a medical exemption to be vaccinated would undermine those interests to a \nlesser degree than would a religious exemption. \nAs counsel for the WTP Plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument, Plaintiffs here \nessentially contend that all existing vaccination mandates without a religious exemption \nnecessarily fail the general applicability test because they likely all contain medical \nexemptions. At the same time, it appears that for decades, those charged with \nprotecting the public health against infectious disease in New York State have required \nvaccination of all medically eligible employees and treated the requirement as a \ncondition of employment in the healthcare arena. For example, the State has required \nhealthcare employees to be vaccinated against rubella and measles since 1980 and 1991, \nrespectively, without a religious exemption. Many of these vaccines, including the \n \n30 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a1g oef  3510 of 50\nrubella vaccine, appear from the information available to us (and not to date contested \nby Plaintiffs) to have connections to the same fetal cell lines that form the basis for \nPlaintiffs’ religious objections here. See Los Angeles County Dep’t of Pub. Health, \nCOVID-19 Vaccine and Fetal Cell Lines, supra note 5. Thus, if accepted, Plaintiffs’ \narguments would go beyond just being inconsistent with past practices: they would \nhave potentially far-reaching and harmful consequences for governments’ ability to \nenforce longstanding public health rules and protocols.  \nWith a record as undeveloped on the issue of comparability as that presented \nhere, we cannot conclude that the above vaccination requirements are per se not \ngenerally applicable, as Plaintiffs’ argument would have it, so as to support a \npreliminary injunction at this time. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 888–89 (counting “compulsory \nvaccination laws” among those generally applicable civic obligations for which no \nreligious exemption is required); see also Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166–67 \n(1944) (“[A parent] cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child \nmore than for himself on religious grounds. The right to practice religion freely does not \ninclude liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease . . . .” \n(footnote omitted)); Phillips v. City of New York, 775 F.3d 538, 543 (2d Cir. 2015) (per \ncuriam) (maintaining that religious exemptions to vaccine mandates are not \nconstitutionally required).  \nThe record before the district courts was sparse. It does not support a conclusion \nthat Plaintiffs have borne their burden of demonstrating that the medical exemption \nprovided in Section 2.61 and the religious exemption sought are likely comparable. \n2.  Whether Section 2.61 Provides for a System of Individualized Exemptions \nGeneral applicability may be absent when a law provides “a mechanism for \nindividualized exemptions,” Smith, 494 U.S. at 884, because it creates the risk that \n \n31 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a2g oef  3520 of 50\nadministrators will use their discretion to exempt individuals from complying with the \nlaw for secular reasons, but not religious reasons. For instance, in Smith, the Supreme \nCourt distinguished generally applicable laws from an unemployment compensation \nstatute under which applicants were eligible for benefits if they presented “good cause” \nfor their unemployment, which allowed administrators, in their discretion, to refuse an \nexemption if an applicant could not work for religious reasons, but to grant an \nexemption if an applicant could not work for other personal reasons. 494 U.S. at 884 \n(quoting Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693, 708 (1986) (plurality opinion) and citing Sherbert v. \nVerner, 374 U.S. 398, 401 & n.4 (1963)). The Court observed that the context of the \nunemployment compensation system “lent itself to individualized government \nassessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.” Id. Similarly, the Court recently \nfound a system of individualized exemptions to exist where an official had “sole \ndiscretion” to grant or deny exemptions to the anti-discrimination provision in \ncontracts between the City of Philadelphia and adoption service providers. Fulton, 141 \nS. Ct. at 1878–79.  \nAs other Circuits have noted, however, “an exemption is not individualized \nsimply because it contains express exceptions for objectively defined categories of \npersons.” 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 6 F.4th 1160, 1187 (10th Cir. 2021) (internal \nquotation marks and alteration omitted); see also Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, 794 F.3d \n1064, 1081–82 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding that the challenged “rules do not afford unfettered \ndiscretion that could lead to religious discrimination because the provisions are tied to \nparticularized, objective criteria”), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 2433 (2016); cf. Intercommunity \nCtr. for Justice & Peace v. I.N.S., 910 F.2d 42, 45 (2d Cir. 1990) (concluding that \nimmigration law that prohibited knowingly employing an unauthorized immigrant did \n“not provide for a discretionary exemption that is applied in a manner that fails to \naccommodate free exercise concerns” despite its inclusion of an exemption for \n \n32 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a3g oef  3530 of 50\nemploying certain household employees hired before November 1986). The “mere \nexistence of an exemption procedure,” absent any showing that secularly motivated \nconduct could be impermissibly favored over religiously motivated conduct, is not \nenough to render a law not generally applicable and subject to strict scrutiny. Lighthouse \nInst. for Evangelism, Inc. v. City of Long Branch, 510 F.3d 253, 276 (3d Cir. 2007). \nThe WTP Plaintiffs argue that the medical exemption in Section 2.61 creates a \nmechanism for individualized exemptions. They are mistaken. The medical exemption \nhere does not “‘invite’ the government to decide which reasons for not complying with \nthe policy are worthy of solicitude.” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1879 (quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at \n884). Instead, the Rule provides for an objectively defined category of people to whom \nthe vaccine requirement does not apply: employees who present a certification from a \nphysician or certified nurse practitioner attesting that they have a pre-existing health \ncondition that renders the vaccination detrimental to their health, in accordance with \ngenerally accepted medical standards, such as those published by ACIP,28 for the period \n \n28 Under the generally accepted medical standards published by ACIP, cognizable \ncontraindications to the COVID-19 vaccines are limited to “[s]evere allergic reaction (e.g., \nanaphylaxis) after a previous dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine” and \n“[i]mmediate (within 4 hours) allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or known \n(diagnosed) allergy to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine.” FAQs, supra at 10 (citing ACIP \nstandards). Precautions to the vaccines are limited to “[c]urrent moderate to severe acute \nillness[,] . . . [h]istory of an immediate allergic reaction to any other (not COVID-19) vaccine or \ninjectable therapy (excluding allergy shots)[, and] [h]istory of myocarditis or pericarditis after \nreceiving the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.” Id. (citing ACIP standards). \nAdditionally, individuals with a “contraindication to one type of COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., \nmRNA COVID-19 vaccines) have precautions to another type of COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., \nJanssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine).” Id. (citing ACIP standards). An individual who has a \ncontraindication to the vaccine cannot be safely vaccinated, but “[m]ost people deemed to have \na precaution to a COVID-19 vaccine at the time of their vaccination appointment can and \nshould be administered vaccine” after conducting a risk assessment with a healthcare provider. \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 \nVaccines Currently Approved or Authorized in the United States: Contraindications and Precautions \n(Oct. 25, 2021), https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-\n \n33 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a4g oef  3540 of 50\nduring which the vaccination remains detrimental to their health. See 10 N.Y.C.R.R. \n§ 2.61(d)(1). A written description of the nature and duration of the condition must be \nfurnished, and the exemption must be documented. On its face, the Rule affords no \nmeaningful discretion to the State or employers, and Plaintiffs have not put forth any \nevidence suggesting otherwise. For example, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged or \noffered evidence to suggest that employees are requesting, or that the State is allowing, \nmedical exemptions that do not conform to the Rule or applicable standards. \nThat physicians and nurse practitioners must use their medical judgment to \ndetermine whether a particular individual has a contraindication or precaution against \nreceiving the vaccine does not render the exemption discretionary. Indeed, Smith itself \nspecifically held that a scheme that included a type of medical exemption—by not \ncriminalizing the use of controlled substances when prescribed by a medical \npractitioner—was nonetheless generally applicable under the Free Exercise Clause. See \nSmith, 494 U.S. at 874. If the State can lawfully choose to apply the vaccination \nrequirement to those with religious objections but not those medically unable to get \nvaccinated because the two are not comparable—and, as explained above, Plaintiffs \nhave not established a likelihood of success on their argument to the contrary—then \nSection 2.61 appears to leave no room for the State to favor impermissible secular \nreasons for declining vaccination over religious reasons.29  \n \nvaccines-us.html#Contraindications. The specificity of these limitations stands in contrast to the \nabsence of limitations and specificity in the medical exemption provided in the Maine statute \nrecently subject to review and consideration by the Supreme Court. See Mills, 2021 WL 4860328, \nat *5 (construing Me. Rev.

Accordingly, rational basis review applies. See Fulton, \n141 S. Ct. at 1876 (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 878–82). Section 2.61 easily meets that \nstandard, which requires that the State have chosen a means for addressing a legitimate \ngoal that is rationally related to achieving that goal. See Jacoby & Meyers, LLP v. Presiding \nJustices of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Dep’ts, App. Div. of the Sup. Ct. of N.Y., 852 \nF.3d 178, 191 (2d Cir. 2017). Faced with an especially contagious variant of the virus in \nthe midst of a pandemic that has now claimed the lives of over 750,000 in the United \nStates and some 55,000 in New York, the State decided as an emergency measure to \nrequire vaccination for all employees at healthcare facilities who might become infected \nand expose others to the virus, to the extent they can be safely vaccinated. This was a \nreasonable exercise of the State’s power to enact rules to protect the public health.30 See \nJacobson, 197 U.S. at 25; Phillips, 775 F.3d at 542–43. \n \nconsidered on an individual basis at the discretion of the University meant that the school’s \nvaccine mandate was not generally applicable under Fulton. Id. at *1, *4. We of course are not \nbound by that analysis, and we believe Dahl to have addressed a factual setting significantly \ndifferent from that presented here. In Dahl, the University was afforded so much discretion to \nrule on individual cases, and so few standards governed the exercise of that discretion, as to \nleave room for the University to apply potentially discriminatory standards, or at least to avoid \na neutral application of generally applicable principles. See id. at *4. Here, we think the \nstandards articulated by ACIP and binding the State employers are sufficiently well-defined to \navoid grossly pretextual or discriminatory application—and Plaintiffs have not met their \nburden to show that is not the case. Examined at a proper perspective—one suitable to dealing \nwith large populations in a public health crisis—we see no basis for adopting the Dahl court’s \napproach here. \n30 We also observe that, irrespective of whether Section 2.61 is ultimately upheld at the \nconclusion of this litigation, private healthcare institutions may impose vaccination \nrequirements of their own, subject to any relevant limitations imposed by Title VII and other \napplicable law but regardless of the limitations that the First Amendment imposes on the State. \n \n35 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a6g oef  3560 of 50\nII.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Supremacy Clause and Title VII Claim \nThe Dr. A. Plaintiffs contend that Section 2.61 contravenes the Supremacy Clause \nbecause it is preempted by Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in employment on \nthe basis of religion. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)–(2). To succeed on this type of preemption \nclaim, plaintiffs must show that “local law conflicts with federal law such that it is \nimpossible for a party to comply with both or the local law is an obstacle to the \nachievement of federal objectives.” N.Y. SMSA Ltd. P’ship v. Town of Clarkstown, 612 F.3d \n97, 104 (2d Cir. 2010).31 \nPlaintiffs construe Section 2.61 to prohibit healthcare employers from making \nreasonable accommodations as otherwise required by Title VII. Plaintiffs cite the \nabsence of an express religious exemption in Section 2.61 in support of their position \nthat the Rule simply leaves “no room for Plaintiffs’ employers even to consider their \nreasonable religious accommodation requests as required by federal law under Title \nVII.” Dr. A. Appellees’ Br. at 29 (emphasis omitted).32   \n \n31 “In general, three types of preemption exist: (1) express preemption, where Congress has \nexpressly preempted local law; (2) field preemption, where Congress has legislated so \ncomprehensively that federal law occupies an entire field of regulation and leaves no room for \nstate law; and (3) conflict preemption, where local law conflicts with federal law such that it is \nimpossible for a party to comply with both or the local law is an obstacle to the achievement of \nfederal objectives.” N.Y. SMSA Ltd. P’ship, 612 F.3d at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nPlaintiffs here invoke conflict preemption. \n32 Although the Dr. A. Plaintiffs style their preemption claim as a challenge brought pursuant to \nthe Supremacy Clause, the Supreme Court has held that the Supremacy Clause does not create \nan independent cause of action. See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 324–25 \n(2015) (“[T]he Supremacy Clause is not the source of any federal rights, and certainly does not \ncreate a cause of action. It instructs courts what to do when state and federal law clash, but is \nsilent regarding who may enforce federal laws in court, and in what circumstances they may do \nso.”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).   \n \n36 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a7g oef  3570 of 50\nThe District Court for the Northern District of New York agreed, ruling that \nPlaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of this claim. See Dr. A., 2021 WL 4734404, \nat *6. The district court held that Section 2.61 “do[es] not make room for ‘covered \nentities’ to consider requests for reasonable religious accommodations,” and instead \nrequires all personnel at covered entities to be vaccinated. Id. The district court \nobserved that the employers of some Plaintiffs had revoked previously afforded \nreligious exemptions or religious accommodations to COVID-19-vaccine requirements, \nciting the State’s adoption of Section 2.61. Id. In the district court’s view, Plaintiffs \nadequately demonstrated that Section 2.61 “effectively foreclose[s] the pathway to \nseeking a religious exemption that is guaranteed under Title VII.” Id.  \nTitle VII makes it unlawful for employers “to discharge . . . or otherwise to \ndiscriminate against any individual” in his or her employment “because of such \nindividual’s . . . religion.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). The statute defines “religion” to \ninclude “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an \nemployer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate . . . an \nemployee’s . . . religious observance or practice without undue hardship on . . . the \nemployer’s business.” Id. § 2000e(j); see Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, \n66 (1977); cf. EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 770 (2015).   \nThe Dr. A. Plaintiffs argue, as described above, that the absence of a religious \nexemption in Section 2.61 prohibits them from seeking reasonable accommodations \nfrom their employers under Title VII for their sincerely held religious beliefs. Section \n2.61 is silent, however, on the employment-related actions that employers may take in \nresponse to employees who refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons. The State \nobserves that “[n]othing in [Section 2.61] precludes employers from accommodating \nreligious objectors by giving them . . . assignments—such as telemedicine—where they \n \n37 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a8g oef  3580 of 50\nwould not pose a risk of infection to other personnel, patients, or residents.” Dr. A. \nAppellants’ Br. at 62. We agree with the State.  \nSection 2.61, on its face, does not bar an employer from providing an employee \nwith a reasonable accommodation that removes the individual from the scope of the \nRule. Section 2.61 does not require employers to violate Title VII because, although it \nbars an employer from granting a religious exemption from the vaccination requirement, \nit does not prevent employees from seeking a religious accommodation allowing them to \ncontinue working consistent with the Rule, while avoiding the vaccination requirement. \nSee also Mills, 2021 WL 4860328, at *10 (“The appellants’ Supremacy Clause argument \nrests on their assertion that the hospitals . . . have claimed that the protections of Title \nVII are inapplicable in the State of Maine. The record simply does not support that \nargument. . . . [T]he hospitals merely dispute that Title VII requires them to offer the \nappellants the religious exemptions they seek.” (internal quotation marks and alteration \nomitted)).  \nContrary to the Dr. A. Plaintiffs’ interpretation of the statute, Title VII does not \nrequire covered entities to provide the accommodation that Plaintiffs prefer—in this \ncase, a blanket religious exemption allowing them to continue working at their current \npositions unvaccinated. To avoid Title VII liability for religious discrimination, an \nemployer “need not offer the accommodation the employee prefers.” Cosme v. \nHenderson, 287 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir. 2002). Instead, an employer must offer a reasonable \naccommodation that does not cause the employer an undue hardship. Once “any \nreasonable accommodation is provided, the statutory inquiry ends.” Id. Because Section \n2.61’s text does not foreclose all opportunity for Plaintiffs to secure a reasonable \naccommodation under Title VII, the Rule does not conflict with federal law. Therefore, \nthe district court’s conclusion to the contrary constituted legal error. \n \n38 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P3a9g oef  3590 of 50\nThe district court’s conclusion also turned on clearly erroneous factual findings. \nAt this stage, the Dr. A. Plaintiffs have submitted little in support of their broad \nallegations about the effect of Section 2.61. The district court reached the conclusion that \naccommodation by their employers was foreclosed upon the Dr. A. Plaintiffs’ say-so, \nwithout any documentation supporting Plaintiffs’ allegations that they were denied \nreasonable accommodations from their employers. The district court granted the Dr. A. \nPlaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction without a hearing and without knowing \nthe identities of Plaintiffs’ employers or the substance of Plaintiffs’ interactions with \ntheir employers. It may turn out that the opportunities for a reasonable accommodation \nunder Title VII for religious objectors to the vaccine are numerous, or it may be that \nthere are so few as to be illusory. Perhaps accommodations for the medically ineligible \nleave few available for the religious objectors.33 Or perhaps the requests for \naccommodations in each category will vary by employer, by part of the State, or by \nemployee demographics. But without any data in the record, we cannot conclude that \nPlaintiffs have met their burden to show a likelihood of success on the merits, and we \ndecline to draw any conclusion about the availability of reasonable accommodation \nbased solely on surmise and speculation.  \nAt this preliminary stage, we therefore conclude that the district court erred by \nfinding that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that Section 2.61 is preempted \nby Title VII and therefore violative of the Supremacy Clause. \n \n33 Although the Rule does not prevent healthcare entities from taking additional precautions to \nminimize the transmission risk posed by medically exempt employees, healthcare entities may \npermit a medically exempt employee to continue normal job responsibilities provided they \ncomply with requirements for personal protective equipment. See FAQs, supra at 10. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P4a0g oef  4500 of 50\nIII.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits: Rights to Privacy, Medical Freedom, and \nBodily Autonomy Claim \nThe WTP Plaintiffs maintain on appeal that they are likely to succeed in \nestablishing that Section 2.61 violates their fundamental rights to privacy, medical \nfreedom, and bodily autonomy under the Fourteenth Amendment.34 This argument also \nfails. \nBoth this Court and the Supreme Court have consistently recognized that the \nConstitution embodies no fundamental right that in and of itself would render vaccine \nrequirements imposed in the public interest, in the face of a public health emergency, \nunconstitutional. See Jacobson, 197 U.S. at 25–31, 37; Phillips, 775 F.3d at 542–43. \nPlaintiffs’ argument that the Supreme Court’s decision in Roman Catholic Diocese \n“expressly overruled” Jacobson is a mystery, given that the majority did not even \nmention Jacobson. WTP Appellants’ Br. at 35; see generally Roman Catholic Diocese, 141 S. \nCt. 63.  \nTheir alternative contention that Jacobson and Phillips have been implicitly \noverruled by the Supreme Court likewise finds no support in caselaw. In Cruzan, a case \nrelied upon by Plaintiffs for the proposition that they have a fundamental constitutional \nright to refuse medical treatment, the Court expressly recognized its holding in Jacobson \nthat “an individual’s liberty interest in declining an unwanted smallpox vaccine” was \noutweighed there by “the State’s interest in preventing disease.” Cruzan by Cruzan v. \n \n34 The WTP Plaintiffs’ complaint describes these rights as arising from the First, Fourth, Fifth, \nand Fourteenth Amendments, but on appeal they assert that these rights are derived from either \nthe Fourteenth Amendment alone or a combination of the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and \nFourteenth Amendments. Because the WTP Plaintiffs do not make any particularized argument \nfor why the fundamental rights they assert may be implicated by constitutional provisions other \nthan the Fourteenth Amendment, we evaluate only their challenge as to the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  \n \n40 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P4a1g oef  4510 of 50\nDir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278 (1990). Plaintiffs provide no basis for \nconcluding that the vaccination requirement here, considerably narrower than the city-\nwide mandate in Jacobson, violates a fundamental constitutional right.35 Although \nindividuals who object to receiving the vaccines on religious grounds have a hard \nchoice to make, they do have a choice. Vaccination is a condition of employment in the \nhealthcare field; the State is not forcibly vaccinating healthcare workers. As in Phillips, \nthe instant “challenge to the mandatory vaccination regime is therefore no more \ncompelling than Jacobson’s was more than a century ago.” 775 F.3d at 542. Cf. Klaassen \nv. Trs. of Indiana Univ., 7 F.4th 592, 593 (7th Cir. 2021) (“[S]uch [a substantive due \nprocess] argument depends on the existence of a fundamental right ingrained in the \nAmerican legal tradition. Yet Jacobson, which sustained a criminal conviction for \nrefusing to be vaccinated, shows that plaintiffs lack such a right.”). \nAccordingly, the WTP Plaintiffs have not established that they are likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their Fourteenth Amendment claim. \nIV.  Irreparable Harm, the Public Interest, and the Balance of Equities \nPlaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction because they cannot, on the \npresent record, show a likelihood of success on the merits. We nonetheless briefly \naddress the remaining preliminary injunction requirements: “irreparable harm absent \n \n35 Plaintiffs’ reliance on Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 \n(1992), and Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), also fails to persuade. These cases do not \nestablish a broad fundamental privacy right for all medical decisions made by an individual—\nand particularly not for a decision with such broad community consequences as declining \nvaccination against a highly contagious disease while working in contact with vulnerable \npeople at healthcare facilities. This Court cannot find an overriding privacy right when doing so \nwould conflict with Jacobson. Although in 1905, when it was decided, Jacobson might have been \nread more narrowly, for over 100 years it has stood firmly for the proposition that the urgent \npublic health needs of the community can outweigh the rights of an individual to refuse \nvaccination. Jacobson remains binding precedent. \n \n41 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P4a2g oef  4520 of 50\ninjunctive relief”; the “public interest weighing in favor of granting the injunction”; and \n“the balance of equities tip[ping] in [the movant’s] favor,” Yang, 960 F.3d at 127, and \ndetermine that Plaintiffs have not successfully met them.   \nA.  Irreparable Harm  \nThe law recognizes the harm that necessarily results when the State \nunconstitutionally burdens religious exercise. “Religious adherents are not required to \nestablish irreparable harm independent of showing a Free Exercise Clause violation \nbecause a presumption of irreparable injury flows from a violation of constitutional \nrights.” Agudath Israel, 983 F.3d at 636 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); \nsee also Bery v. City of New York, 97 F.3d 689, 693 (2d Cir. 1996) (“Violations of First \nAmendment rights are commonly considered irreparable injuries for the purposes of a \npreliminary injunction.”). Although Plaintiffs are subject to meaningful burdens on \ntheir religious practice if they choose to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine, because they \nhave failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on their First Amendment or other \nconstitutional claims, their asserted harm is not of a constitutional dimension. Thus, \nPlaintiffs fail to meet the irreparable harm element simply by alleging an impairment of \ntheir Free Exercise right.   \nPlaintiffs also contend that they face imminent irreparable harm from loss of \nemployment and professional standing if they refuse the COVID-19 vaccine on religious \ngrounds. We acknowledge that Plaintiffs may possibly suffer significant employment \nconsequences if they refuse on religious grounds to be vaccinated. It is well settled, \nhowever, that adverse employment consequences are not the type of harm that usually \nwarrants injunctive relief because economic harm resulting from employment actions is \ntypically compensable with money damages. See Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 91–92 \n(1974) (“[L]oss of income and . . . the claim that her reputation would be damaged . . . \nfalls far short of the type of irreparable injury which is a necessary predicate to the \n \n42 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P4a3g oef  4530 of 50\nissuance of a temporary injunction[.]”); Savage v. Gorski, 850 F.2d 64, 68 (2d Cir. 1988) \n(“Since reinstatement and money damages could make appellees whole for any loss \nsuffered during this period, their injury is plainly reparable and appellees have not \ndemonstrated the type of harm entitling them to injunctive relief.”). Because Plaintiffs’ \neconomic harms under Title VII could be remedied with money damages, and \nreinstatement is a possible remedy as well, we conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to \ndemonstrate that they will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief.  \nWe pause to recognize, should the issue remain on remand, that this case raises \ndifficult, apparently unusual questions as to imminent irreparable harm. Perhaps, if \nthey prevail at the conclusion of this litigation, Plaintiffs would seek lost wages, but it is \nnot at all clear who would pay them. To the extent Plaintiffs allege that they will suffer \nadverse employment consequences or loss of professional standing if not provided \naccommodations under Title VII, Plaintiffs might seek money damages from their \nemployers. Private medical-provider employers might make a persuasive argument \nthat they should not have to pay because they were in effect compelled by law to \nterminate the employment. Absent a waiver, however, sovereign immunity would \nlikely prevent Plaintiffs from obtaining money damages from the State. See Virginia \nOffice for Prot. & Advocacy v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 254 (2011).  \nWe emphasize, however, that we do not place any weight on the issue of \nremediation of Plaintiffs’ financial losses at this preliminary injunction stage. The \ndistrict courts can consider the issue, should it be necessary to do so, upon a \ndetermination of the permanent injunction request, presumably upon further factual \ndevelopment and findings. \n \n43 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P4a4g oef  4540 of 50\nB.  Public Interest and Balance of Equities \nPlaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate that the public interest weighs in favor \nof enjoining enforcement of Section 2.61. When the government is a party to the suit, \nour inquiries into the public interest and the balance of the equities merge. See New York \nv. United States Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 58–59 (2d Cir. 2020). Here, the State \nhas an indisputably compelling interest in ensuring that the employees who care for \nhospital patients, nursing home residents, and other medically vulnerable people in its \nhealthcare facilities are vaccinated against COVID-19, not just to protect them and those \nwith whom they come into contact from infection, but also to prevent an overburdening \nof the healthcare system. Although Plaintiffs undoubtedly face a difficult choice if their \nemployers deny religious accommodations—whether to be vaccinated despite their \nreligious beliefs or whether to risk termination of their jobs—such hardships are \noutweighed by the State’s interest in maintaining the safety within healthcare facilities \nduring the pandemic.  \nPlaintiffs assert that the State “will suffer no harm as the New York healthcare \nsystem has operated for the last year without interruption or catastrophe” without \nrequiring vaccination for healthcare workers. WTP Appellants’ Br. at 11. Defining the \nrelevant time frame in this way notably omits the first wave of the pandemic, during \nwhich New York hospitals were in crisis, with frontline nurses and physicians \nreportedly experiencing some of the highest rates of infection and death; New York City \nnursing homes experienced such a high number of deaths that their morgue capacity \nwas exceeded. See Br. for Amicus Curiae Greater New York Hospital Association \n(“GNYHA Amicus Br.”) at 3 (citing Miriam Mutambudzi et al., Occupation and Risk of \nSevere COVID-19: Prospective Cohort Study of 120 075 UK Biobank Participants, 78 \nOccupational & Envt’l Med. 307, 311 (2021)); New York State Office of the Attorney \n \n44 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P4a5g oef  4550 of 50\nGeneral, Nursing Home Response to COVID-19 Pandemic 12 (Jan. 30, 2021), \nhttps://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021-nursinghomesreport.pdf.  \nBut even within the past year, healthcare facilities in the State have been under \nstrain. According to amicus Greater New York Hospital Association, not only has \ntransmission of the virus continued in hospitals even with the use of personal protective \nequipment, testing, and other measures, see GNYHA Amicus Br. at 9, 12–14, but hospital \nworkers have also experienced a “parallel pandemic” of burnout, anxiety, depression, \nand other mental health issues, id. at 16. Researchers have found that this phenomenon \nstems from “a perceived lack of control, treatment of other healthcare workers for \nCOVID-19, and uncertainty about colleagues’ infection status,” and it has been \naccompanied by increased rates of resignation and retirement as well as incidents of \nself-harm.

Because Section 2.61 furthers the State’s compelling \ninterest and Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of demonstrating that their \nconstitutional rights are violated by the Rule, they have also failed to show that a \npreliminary injunction preventing the Rule’s implementation serves the public interest. \n \n45 \n \n\nCase C1:a2s1e- c2v1--021506069,- DDoNcHu-mMeLn  t  D74o,c 1u1m/0e4n/t2 2072 1  ,F 3ile2d0 61110/075, /P2a1g  e P4a6g oef  4560 of 50\nWhether this issue will ultimately carry any weight when the district courts decide \nPlaintiffs’ entitlement to a permanent injunction on remand, we need not and do not \ndecide. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of New York is AFFIRMED.

Come now Plaintiffs, who respectfully request that this Court enter a temporary\nrestraining order (with notice) and preliminary injunction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 against \nGovernor of New York Kathy Hochul, Commissioner of the New York State Department of \nHealth Howard Zucker, and Attorney General of New York Letitia James, and their agents, \nemployees  and  successors  in  office,  and  those  acting  in  concert  with  them,  respecting  the \nVaccine Mandate challenged in this action, which mandates COVID-19 vaccination of health \ncare workers, including Plaintiffs, with no provision for a religious exemption, which exemption \nplaintiffs seek or already obtained prior to revocation on account of the Mandate.   \n1 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5   Filed 09/13/21   Page 2 of 4\n2.  Plaintiffs are facing imminent irreparable harm from loss of employment and \nprofessional standing for their religiously motivated refusal to be vaccinated.  \n3.  And in particular, Plaintiffs seek an Order: \nRestraining  and  enjoining  the  Defendants,  their  officers,  agents,  employees, \nattorneys and successors in office, and all other persons  in active concert or \nparticipation with them, from enforcing, threatening to enforce, attempting to \nenforce, or otherwise requiring compliance with the Vaccine Mandate such that: \n(1) The challenged Vaccine Mandate is suspended in operation to the \nextent  that  the  Department  of  Health  is  barred  from  enforcing  any \nrequirement that employers deny religious exemptions from COVID-19 \nvaccination or that they revoke any exemptions employers already granted \nbefore the Vaccine Mandate superseded the prior Health Order to exclude \nreligious exemptions, including the exemptions already granted to certain \nof the Plaintiffs herein; \n(2) The Department of Health is barred from interfering in any way with \nthe granting of religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination going \nforward, or with the operation of exemptions already granted under the \nprior Health Order;  \n(3)  The  Department  of  Health  is  barred  from  taking  any  action, \ndisciplinary or otherwise, against the licensure, certification, residency, \nadmitting privileges or other professional status or qualification of any of \nthe Plaintiffs on account of their seeking or having obtained a religious \nexemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5   Filed 09/13/21   Page 3 of 4\n  The grounds for this motion are that the Vaccine Mandate, both facially and as applied to \nthese Plaintiffs, violates:  \n(1) the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by contravening Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 which requires Plaintiffs’ employers to grant religious exemptions unless \n(and only unless) doing so would cause the employers “undue hardship”;  \n(2) the Free Exercise Clause of the U.S. Constitution at least insofar as they expressly \nallow  employers  to  grant  exemptions  for  reasons  of  “health”  notwithstanding  the  Vaccine \nMandate’s express interest in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and its delta variant, an interest \nno  less  undermined  by  reasonably  accommodated  religious  objectors  than  by  reasonably \naccommodated medical professionals for whom the vaccines are contraindicated as a matter of \nhealth; and \n(3) the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because (a) the Vaccine Mandate \nburdens Plaintiffs’ fundamental right to free exercise of religion, (b) it irrationally treats religious \nobjectors  less  favorably  than  similarly  situated  medical  professionals  who  may  obtain \nexemptions for reasons of “health,” and (c) it irrationally imposes the vaccine requirement on a \nsubset of Plaintiffs who have had and recovered from COVID and thus have natural immunity at \na level greater than the artificial immunity from available COVID vaccines.  \nPlaintiffs are also entitled to leave from Fed.

The utterly lawless character of this \nschematic is so obvious that even one of the most constitutionally lawless states in the Union as a \nmatter of course—California—has a health care vaccine mandate with an  express religious \nexemption (see infra). \nUnder the challenged Vaccine Mandate here, religious exemptions are forbidden but \nmedical exemptions are available.  Physical health trumps spiritual health yet again in New \nYork’s endless COVID-19 regime, which has managed to survive even the official ending of the \n“state of disaster emergency” by the former Governor.  And yet, throughout the pandemic, these \nsame plaintiffs have practiced their professions without need of vaccination, some of them \ncontracting the virus themselves from patients they treated, only to recover and continue their \nwork.  See Verified Complaint, ¶¶ 133, 151, 171, 181. \n \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 6 of 24\n  Never in the history of this country—indeed, never in the history of the world—has a \ngovernment attempted to impose mass vaccination on an entire class of citizens under threat of \nloss of livelihood and professional standing.  But New York is attempting to do just that, \nsweeping aside the protection of sincere religious beliefs under Title VII and the Free Exercise \nClause of the First Amendment, as well as the parallel protections under the New York Human \nRights Law and the New York City Human Rights Law.   \n  Months after ex-Governor Cuomo ended the “state of disaster emergency” and rescinded \nall his related executive orders, the defendants herein dare to continue exercising sweeping \n“emergency” powers based on nothing but their apparent conviction that they can do anything \nthey please and get away with it, because no one will stop them.   But these plaintiffs respectfully \nsubmit that this Court must stop them—for the sake of representative government, the supremacy \nof  federal  remedial  law  over  the  discriminatory  whims  of  state  officials,  and  the  very \nConstitution  on  which  this  nation  was  founded.  (For  remaining  background,  Plaintiffs \nincorporate by reference the allegations of the Verified Complaint filed contemporaneously with \nthis memorandum.)  \n \nARGUMENT \n  “In the Second Circuit, the standard for issuance of a temporary restraining order is the \nsame as the standard for a preliminary injunction.” Chestnut Hill NY, Inc. v. City of Kingston, \nNo. 117-cv-0095, 2017 WL 11418271, at *1 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2017). To obtain a preliminary \ninjunction, a plaintiff must establish: (1) “a likelihood of success on the merits or sufficiently \nserious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of \nhardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiff’s favor”; (2) “a likelihood of irreparable injury in the \nabsence of an injunction”; (3) that the balance of hardships “tips in the plaintiff’s favor”; and (4) \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 7 of 24\nthat the injunction is not adverse to the public interest. Benihana, Inc. v. Benihana of Tokyo, \nLLC, 784 F.3d 887, 895 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffs easily satisfy all \nfour factors here. \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS BECAUSE THE \nVACCINE MANDATE PLAINLY VIOLATES FEDERAL LAW \n \nA.  The  Vaccine  Mandate  Is  Clearly  Preempted  by  Title  VII  Federal \nEmployment Law. \n \nThe merits of this case are as simple as they appear at first glance. New York—which, \ndespite what some of its bureaucrats might believe, is no higher in the Republic’s hierarchical \nconstitutional scheme than any other state—has imposed a COVID-19 vaccine mandate on \nhealth care employees that forbids exactly what federal law requires. Specifically, the New York \nPublic Health and Health Planning Council’s ( “Health Council’s”) August 26, 2021, COVID-19 \nvaccine mandate for health care workers (“Vaccine Mandate”) conspicuously eliminates (and \nthereby forbids) any opportunity for covered employees to even attempt to secure a reasonable \naccommodation for their sincerely held religious objections to the currently available COVID-19 \nvaccines. This flies in the face of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which requires \nemployers  with  more  than  15  employees—including  all  of  Plaintiffs’  employers  here—to \nreasonably accommodate their employees’ sincere religious beliefs and practices, unless (and \nonly unless), a specific employer can show that any accommodation would specifically impose \nan undue hardship on that employer. But in a move straight out of a pre-18th century playbook \n(specifically, pre-1787), New York’s blanket rule outright forbids health care workers from \nfollowing federal law and seeking an accommodation for their sincere religious objections to the \navailable  COVID-19  vaccines.  Such  antiquated  sovereign  hubris  violates  one  of  the  key \nprinciples to emerge from the Framers’ Constitutional Convention during that fateful summer in \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 8 of 24\nPhiladelphia: only federal law (not federal law plus elitist New York bureaucrats’ “emergency” \nrules) is the supreme law of the land. The Vaccine Mandate plainly contravenes it here. \n“Federalism,  central  to  the  constitutional  deign,  adopts  the  principle  that  both  the \nNational and State Governments have elements of sovereignty that the other is bound to respect.” \nArizona v. U.S., 567 U.S. 387, 398 (2012) (emphasis added). “The Supremacy Clause provides a \nclear rule that federal law ‘shall be the supreme law of the Land; and the Judges in every State \nshall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary \nnotwithstanding.’” Id. at 399 (quoting U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2).  \nThus, the Supreme Court “has long made clear that federal law is as much the law of the \nseveral States as are the laws passed by their legislatures.” Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729, \n734 (2009). And indeed, “under the Supremacy Clause . . . any state law, however clearly within \na State’s acknowledged power, which interferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield.” \nGade v. Nat’l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass’n, 505 U.S. 88, 108 (1992) (emphasis added); see also \nTweed-New Haven Airport Auth. v. Tong, 930 F.3d 65, 73 (2d Cir. 2019) (“If the Supremacy \nClause means anything, it means that a state is not free to enforce within its boundaries laws \npreempted by federal law,” and “[l]awsuits invoking the Supremacy Clause are one of the main \nways of ensuring that this does not occur”), cert denied, 140 S. Ct. 2508 (2020); see also \nChicago  &  N.W.  Transp.  Co.  v.  Kalo  Brick  Tile  Co.,  450  U.S.  311,  317  (1981)  (“[T]he \nSupremacy Clause invalidates state laws that interfere  with  or  are contrary to the laws of \n[C]ongress.”). \nHere, the Vaccine Mandate directly interferes with each of the Plaintiffs’ federal-law \nrights under Title VII. That’s because Title VII makes it unlawful for covered employers to, \namong other things, “discharge . . . or otherwise discriminate against any individual” in his or her \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 9 of 24\nemployment “because of such individual’s . . . religion.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  It  also  makes  it  unlawful  for  such  employers  “to  limit,  segregate,  or  classify”  an \nemployee  “in  any  way  which  would  .  .  .  tend  to  deprive”  an  individual  of  “employment \nopportunities,”  or  which  would  “otherwise  adversely  affect”  an  individual’s  status  as  an \nemployee “because of such individual’s . . . religion.” Id. § 2000e-2(a)(2).  \nCritically, “religion” is defined to mean “all aspects of religious observance and practice, \nas well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate . \n.  .  an  employee’s  .  .  .  religious  observance  or  practice  without  undue  hardship”  on  “the \nemployer’s business.” Id. § 2000e(j). In practice, this means Title VII prohibits an employer \nfrom discriminating against an employee “in order to avoid accommodating a religious practice \nthat it could accommodate without an undue hardship.” E.E.O.C. v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, \nInc., 575 U.S. 768, 773 (2015); see also id. (“An employer may not make an [employee’s] \nreligious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions.”). Moreover, this \nrule applies even to employers’ neutral policies that incidentally burden people of faith. See id. \nat 775 (“An employer is surely entitled to have, for example, a no-headwear policy as an \nordinary  matter,”  but  Title  VII  gives  religious  practices  “favored  treatment”  and  “requires \notherwise neutral policies to give way to the need for an accommodation”).  \nThus,  under  federal  law,  all  of  Plaintiffs’  employers  are  required  to  accommodate \nPlaintiffs’ religious objections to the available COVID-19 vaccines unless (and only unless) \nthose employers can demonstrate that doing so would be an undue hardship on their businesses. \nYet, almost unbelievably, the Vaccine Mandate outright forbids all Plaintiffs here from even \nseeking (or retaining already granted) reasonable accommodations from COVID-19 vaccination \nin accord with their sincerely held religious beliefs, which categorically prevent all of them from \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 10 of 24\nreceiving the vaccines now available, all of which are connected to abortion in their testing, \ndevelopment or manufacture. The Vaccine Mandate forbids each of their employers from even \nconsidering requests for religious exemptions notwithstanding the contrary requirements of Title \nVII.  Indeed, Plaintiffs have either sought or inquired about obtaining a religious exemption from \nthe COVID-19 vaccine mandate from their respective employers, and some were even granted \nreligious  exemptions  that  were  revoked  after  the  Vaccine  Mandate  went  into  effect.  (See \nComplaint at ¶¶ 49, 77, 142, 161, 172) Every plaintiff has thus been denied his or her federally \nprotected right to employer accommodation of sincerely held religious beliefs solely because of \nthe Vaccine Mandate.  \nIndeed, a mandate of this type is even expressly preempted by Title VII, which explicitly \nprovides that “[n]othing in this subchapter shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from \nany . . . law of any State . . . other than any such law which purports to require . . . any act which \nwould  be  an  unlawful  employment  practice  under  this  subchapter.”  42  U.S.C.  §  2000e-7 \n(emphasis added). Here the Vaccine Mandate purports to require categorical denials of requests \nfor religious exemptions from the state’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, while Title VII forbids \nemployers from refusing to accommodate an employee’s sincere religious beliefs and practices \nunless the employer can actually demonstrate that doing so would be an undue hardship.  \nThe Vaccine Mandate is thus both effectively and expressly preempted by federal law. As \nsuch, it must yield to Plaintiffs’ federal-law rights under Title VII to seek religious exemptions \nfrom the Mandate. That is the simple but clear demand of our Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.1 \n                                                 \n1 To be clear, Plaintiffs do not argue the Supremacy Clause provides them an implied right of \naction. See Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, (2015) (holding “that the \nSupremacy Clause does not confer a right of action”). Rather, they seek “to enjoin unlawful \nexecutive action” under this Court’s equitable powers. Id. at 327-28; see also Verizon Maryland, \nInc. v. Public Service Com’n of Maryland, 535 U.S. 635, 642 (2002) (holding that federal courts \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 11 of 24\nB.  The Vaccine Mandate Also Violates the Free Exercise Clause of the \nFirst Amendment.  \n \n1.  The Vaccine is not a neutral and generally applicable burden \non religious exercise.     \nThe Vaccine Mandate plainly burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of religion. Yet the Mandate is \nquintessentially non-neutral and non-generally applicable, and it cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. \nIndeed, the Mandate’s recent history confirms that it targets religion by specifically eliminating \nthe religious exemption in the prior Health Order, enacted only days before.  See Complaint, ¶¶ \n2, 20. And it is not generally applicable at least because it authorizes medical exemptions that, on \nthe Mandate’s own premise, make health care workers and their patients more vulnerable to \ncontracting the COVID-19 Delta variant. These exemptions (and the examples of other states, \nwhich have no such mandates) show that New York has no compelling interest in denying a \nreligious exemption to these Plaintiffs, and the Mandate is not the least restrictive means of \nfurthering New York’s stated interest. \nA regulation is not a neutral burden on religion if it discriminates against a religious \npractice on its face, or if in its real operation it targets a religious practice. Cent. Rabbinical \nCong. of U.S. & Canada v. New York City Dep’t of Health and Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, \n193, 194-95 (2d Cir. 2014). “[T]he specific series of events leading to the enactment or official \npolicy in question” is relevant in detecting lack of neutrality. Commack Self-Serv. Kosher Meats, \nInc. v. Hooker, 680 F.3d 194, 211 (2d Cir. 2012). Additionally, a regulation is not generally \napplicable  where  it  “treat[s]  any  comparable  secular  activity  more  favorably  than  religious \nexercise.” Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1296 (April 9, 2021) (emphasis in original). And \n                                                                                                                                                             \nhave subject matter jurisdiction to consider lawsuits on the basis that a state “regulation is pre-\nempted by a federal statute which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, must \nprevail”) (internal quotations omitted). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 12 of 24\n“whether two activities are comparable for purposes of the Free Exercise Clause must be judged \nagainst the asserted government interest that justifies the regulation at issue,” including activities \nthat “could  . . . present[] similar risks” of “spread[ing] COVID-19.”  Id. (emphasis  added) \n(internal quotations omitted). \nHere, the specific events leading to the Vaccine Mandate’s final version show that it \neffectively  targets  religious  opposition  to  the  available  COVID-19  vaccines.  In  particular, \nDefendant  Zucker’s  prior  Health  Order  specifically  authorized  both  medical  and  religious \nexemptions from the Vaccine Mandate. (Cmplt., Ex. B, Order at Sec. (a).) Specifically, the \nHealth Order stated that “[c]overed entities shall grant a religious exemption” from the COVID-\n19 vaccine requirement for covered personnel who “hold genuine and sincere religious belief \ncontrary  to  the  practice  of  immunization,  subject  to  a  reasonable  accommodation  by  the \nemployer.” (Id.)2 The Order was signed by Defendant Zucker on August 18th. But just eight days \nlater,  on  August  26th,  the  PHHPC  promulgated  a  formal  amended  rule  that  conspicuously \neliminated any exemptions from the Vaccine Mandate on religious grounds, while retaining the \navailability  of  exemptions  on  medical  grounds.  (Cmplt.,  Ex.  A,  at  2.61(d).)  Thus, \nnotwithstanding the aforementioned clear requirements of federal employment law regarding \nreligious accommodations, the Mandate’s final version was specifically “gerrymandered with \ncare to proscribe religious [objections]” while maintaining authorization for medical exemptions. \nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 542 (1993); see also id. \n                                                 \n2 It’s not immediately clear whether the Order authorized exemptions only for those opposed to \nall vaccinations on religious grounds, although such a limitation would have clearly run afoul of \nthe  Constitution  to  the  extent  it  excluded  those  who  are  religiously  opposed  the  available \nCOVID-19 vaccines while not necessarily opposing all vaccines generally. See Thomas v. Rev. \nBd. of Indiana Emp. Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981) (“[R]eligous beliefs need not be \nacceptable logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment \nprotection.”).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 13 of 24\n534 (“The Free Exercise Clause protects against government hostility which is masked, as well \nas overt,” and courts “must survey meticulously the circumstances of government categories to \neliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders”).  \n In sum, the Mandate flagrantly disallows the religious protections required by federal \nemployment law and specifically deletes its own prior offering of religious exemptions for \ncovered health care workers. Given these circumstances, the Mandate clearly targets religious \nconduct for disfavored treatment and cannot be deemed a neutral burden on Plaintiffs’ religious \nexercise. It therefore triggers strict scrutiny, which it fails for reasons discussed below.  \nMoreover,  the  Vaccine  Mandate  is  not  generally  applicable  because  it  is  blatantly \nunderinclusive as to its purposes. The Mandate states that its provisions are necessary in light of \n“a concerning national trend of increasing circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant,” and \nunvaccinated health care personnel “have an unacceptably high risk of both acquiring COVID-19 \nand transmitting the virus to colleagues and/or vulnerable patients or residents.” (Cmplt., Ex. A, \nat 2.61 “Needs and Benefits”.) But the Mandate expressly accepts this risk for those in need of a \n“[m]edical exemption,” which is authorized for covered personnel for whom “immunization with \n[a] COVID-19 vaccine is detriment to [their] health,” which is undefined, at least “until such \nimmunization is found no longer to be detrimental to such personnel member’s health.” (Id. at \n2.61(d)(1).) It’s obvious that medical personnel who are exempt from the vaccine mandate for \n“health” reasons “could . . . present[] similar risks” of “spread[ing] COVID-19” as those with \nreligious objections to the vaccine. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1296 (emphasis added) (internal \nquotations omitted). And there is no reason of science or logic that mitigating accommodations \nprovided for the former group should be categorically unavailable for the latter. Therefore, the \nMandate plainly treats “comparable secular activity” (i.e., the practice of health care while \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 14 of 24\nunvaccinated for medical reasons) “more favorably than religious exercise” (i.e., the practice of \nhealthcare while unvaccinated for religious reasons). Id. That is exactly the kind of unequal \ntreatment of religion that triggers strict scrutiny,3 which, again, the Mandate cannot satisfy. \n2.  The Vaccine Mandate easily fails strict scrutiny.  \nTo survive strict scrutiny, the Vaccine Mandate must, first of all, “advance[] interests of \nthe  highest  order  and  [b]e  narrowly  tailored  to  achieve  those  interests.”  Fulton  v.  City  of \nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1881 (2001) (internal quotations omitted).  \nFurther, “[i]t is established in our strict scrutiny jurisprudence that a law cannot be \nregarded as protecting an interest ‘of the highest order’ when it leaves appreciable damage to that \nsupposedly vital interest unprohibited.” Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 2234. And the asserted compelling \ninterest cannot be stated at an unduly “high level of generality,” but rather must be a compelling \ninterest “in denying an exception” to “particular religious claimants.” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1882 \n(emphasis added).  \nFinally,  narrow  tailoring  for  purposes  of  strict  scrutiny  requires  “showing  that  [the \nchallenged rule] is the least restrictive means” of achieving a compelling interest. Thomas v. \nReview Bd. of Indiana Emp. Security Div., 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981) (emphasis added). The \nVaccine Mandate fails both prongs here.  \n                                                 \n3 The Mandate is also substantially underinclusive to the extent it applies only to health care \n“personnel”  employed  or  affiliated  with  health  care-related  “covered  entities,”  despite  the \nMandate’s own acknowledgement that the health care industry is only one kind of setting where \npeople are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. (See Cmplt., Ex. A, Am. Rule, at “Needs and \nBenefits” (“Certain settings, such as healthcare facilities and congregate care settings, pose \nincreased  challenges  and  urgency  for  controlling  the  spread  of  this  disease  because  of  the \nvulnerable patient and resident populations that they serve.” (emphasis added)). The relatively \nnarrow scope of the Mandate despite the purportedly broad national problem of increasing \nspread  of  the  COVID-19  Delta  variant  is  further  evidence  of  the  Mandate’s  substantial \nunderinclusivity.) \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 15 of 24\nFirst, there is no compelling interest in denying a religious exemption for these 17 \nPlaintiffs, who are spread out across multiple different health care facilities in New York, when \nthe Vaccine Mandate allows the same institutions to grant medical exemptions notwithstanding \nthe government’s supposed interest in stopping the spread of the Delta variant. The Defendants \ncan offer “no compelling reason why it has a particular interest in denying an exception [to these \nparticular Plaintiffs] while making them available to others.” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1882; see also \nid.  (holding  that  City  of  Philadelphia’s  authorization  of  secular  exemptions  from  a  non-\ndiscrimination rule “undermines the City’s contention that its non-discrimination policies can \nbrook  no  departures”).  As  the  Supreme  Court  put  it  earlier  this  year  with  respect    to  the \ngovernment’s “interest in reducing the spread of COVID,” “[w]here the government permits \nother activities to proceed with precautions, it must show that the religious exercise at issue is \nmore dangerous than those activities even when the same precautions are applied.” Tandon, 141 \nS. Ct. at 1297.  That’s exactly what the government cannot do here, given that health-care work \nwhile unvaccinated is permitted for medical reasons but not religious reasons.  \nMoreover, all of the Plaintiffs engaged in their work as medical professionals throughout \nthe pandemic without need of vaccination. Yet now the State implausibly claims a dire threat to \nvaccinated health care workers if the Plaintiffs, who were never vaccinated before, are not \nvaccinated now.  What good, then, is the vaccination of the vaccinated?  And if patients, whether \nvaccinated or not, were treated by the Plaintiffs without danger to their health before, where is \nthe danger now?  Any asserted “compelling interest” here is merely rhetorical, not actual. \nAdditionally, Defendants cannot satisfy the narrow-tailoring test that “the government \nmust show that it seriously undertook to address the problem with less intrusive tools readily \navailable to it,” and that the government “must demonstrate that alternative measures imposing \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 16 of 24\nlesser burdens on religious liberty would fail to achieve [its] interests.”Agudath Israel v. Cuomo, \n983 F.3d 620, 633 (2d Cir. 2020) (emphasis added). Here the Health Council stated that it \nconsidered two “Alternative Approaches”: (1) requiring covered entities to “test all personnel in \ntheir facility before each shift” (but it found this to have little benefit and unreasonable costs), \nand (2) mandating all personnel to wear “fit-tested N95 face coverings at all times when in the \nfacility” (but it found that fit-tested 95 coverings are not the only kind of “acceptable face \ncoverings” that have been “a long-standing requirement in these covered entities” and that these \ntraditional face-coverings merely help reduce, but “do[] not prevent transmission.”) (Cmplt., Ex. \nA, at “Alternative Approaches.”)  \nThose  assertions  are  utterly  self-defeating,  as  it  is  impossible  not  to  see  that  the \ngovernment has failed to satisfy its high burden here. There is an abundance of widely accepted \nevidence that COVID-19 vaccines likewise do not prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and its \nvariants. (Cmplt., Exs. E and F (Statement of CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky that “what \n[COVID] vaccines can’t do anymore is prevent transmission”).) And daily testing is hardly the \nonly other theoretical alternative to full-fledged vaccination. Indeed, the government provides no \nexplanation for why any alternative (and presumably COVID-protective) accommodations made \nfor employees with medical exemptions could not be made for these Plaintiffs with religious \nexemptions.  And, once again, if the precautions Plaintiffs took at the height of the pandemic and \nthroughout its duration were good enough before vaccines became available, why are they not \ngood enough now? \nFinally, this Court should ensure the government gave “sufficient weight to rules in other \njurisdictions” before concluding that the government’s particularized interest is truly narrowly \ntailored. See Mast v. Fillmore Cnty., Minnesota, 141 S. Ct. 2430, 2433 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 17 of 24\nconcurring  and  noting  that  the  fact  governments  in  other  states  allow  for  water-disposal \nalternatives of the kind sought by Amish plaintiffs in Minnesota undermined Minnesota’s refusal \nto provide an accommodation there); see also id. (“It is the government’s burden to show this \nalternative won’t work; not the Amish’s to show it will.”).  Here, Plaintiffs are aware of only one \nother state (Maine) in the entire country that similarly strips health care workers of their federal \nstatutory and constitutional right to seek a religious exemption from a Vaccine Mandate. See 10-\n144 C.M.R. Ch. 264 (2021) and 22 M.R.S. § 802(4-B) (Maine). Indeed, even otherwise similar \nmandates imposed on health care workers in two of our country’s most politically liberal states \nspecifically authorize religious exemptions. See Illinois EO 2021-20 (COVID-19 EO No. 87) \n(Aug.  26,  2021)  at  Sec.  2(e)  (requiring  exemption  where  “vaccination  is  medically \ncontraindicated” or where it “would require the individual to violate or forgo a sincerely held \nreligious  belief,  practice,  or  observance”),  available  at \nhttps://www.illinois.gov/government/executive-orders/executive-order.executive-order-number-\n20.2021.html; California, State Public Health Officer Order of August 5, 2021, Sec. 2 (“Workers \nmay be exempt . . . upon . . . [signing] a declination form . . . stating . . . the worker is declining \nvaccination  based  on  Religious  Beliefs”), \nhttps://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-\nHealth-Officer-Health-Care-Worker-Vaccine-Requirement.aspx.  New York cannot show why \nsimilar alternatives cannot work for Plaintiffs here.  \nFor the same reasons, Defendants cannot establish that refusing these Plaintiffs even the \nopportunity to seek religious exemptions and corresponding reasonable accommodations from \nthe  Mandate  is  the  least  restrictive  means  of  furthering  the  government’s  patently  non-\n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 18 of 24\ncompelling interest. Thus, the Mandate easily fails strict scrutiny under both prongs and thereby \nviolates the Free Exercise Clause. \nC.  The Vaccine Mandate Also Violates the Equal Protection Clause \nA government classification that burdens a fundamental right is subject to strict scrutiny \nunder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hayden v. Paterson, 594 F.3d \n150, 169-70 (2d Cir. 2010). Additionally, government classifications must have at least a rational \nbasis in furtherance of a legitimate interest. Kwong v. Bloomberg, 723 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir. \n2013). Once again, the government fails both prongs here. \nFor  the  reasons  explained  above,  the  government’s  classification  flagrantly  burdens \nPlaintiffs’ right to the free exercise of religion and easily fails strict scrutiny, thereby violating \nthe Equal Protection Clause in addition to the Free Exercise Clause.  \nAdditionally,  all  of  the  Plaintiffs  are  similarly  situated  to  the  class  of  health  care \nprofessionals who are allowed to seek accommodation under the Vaccine Mandate for reasons of \n“health,” and yet Plaintiffs are treated differently without any rational basis. That’s because \nPlaintiffs, like those with “health” reasons, are also unable to receive the vaccines (for religious \nreasons).  Plaintiffs  with  religious  reasons  for  exemption  are  no  more  unsuited  to  being \nreasonably accommodated. There is no rational, legitimate, or compelling interest in the Vaccine \nMandate’s  application  of  different  standards  to  similarly  situated  groups  in  the  field  of \nhealthcare. See Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996) (“A law declaring that in general it \nshall be more difficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek [protection] from the \ngovernment is itself a denial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense.”)  \nMoreover, as noted above, Nurse J, Nurse N, Dr. P, and Dr. S have all previously had \nCOVID or COVID-like symptoms and, on information and belief, all have natural immunity at a \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 19 of 24\ngreater level than the immunity purportedly available from the COVID-19 vaccines. (Cmplt., \nExs. E and F.) Therefore it is utterly irrational to require these Plaintiffs to obtain the vaccine. \nIn sum, Plaintiffs are entitled to relief under the Equal Protection Clause as well.  \nFor all of the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs are plainly likely to succeed on the merits. \nAnd they also satisfy the remaining factors for a preliminary injunction, as set forth below. \nII.  PLAINTIFFS SATISFY THE REMAINING FACTORS FOR A TRO AND PI \nPlaintiffs easily satisfy the remaining three factors for an emergency TRO and PI: (1) \nirreparable harm; (2) balance of harms; and (3) public interest. \nFirst, the Vaccine Mandate poses immediate and actual irreparable injury to Plaintiffs. \nThey  must  all  receive  COVID-19  vaccinations  by  September  27  or  October  7  or  else  be \nterminated from employment, causing untold damage to their licensure and credentialed status, \nwithout  any  opportunity  to  seek  religious  exemptions  and  corresponding  reasonable \naccommodations from their employers. As is oft-stated: “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, \nfor even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, \n427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976)).  \nFurther, prohibiting Plaintiffs from practicing medicine and health care in accord with \ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs, on the same terms and conditions as those for whom the \nCOVID-19  vaccines  are  medically  contraindicated,  in  violation  of  Title  VII  federal  law, \n“assuredly inflicts irreparable harm.” Roberts v. Neace, 958 F.3d 409, 416 (6th Cir. 2020) \n(holding as much with respect to Kentucky’s order closing down houses of worship to stop the \nspread of COVID-19 while authorizing the continued operation of many secular businesses). \nHere, Plaintiffs must either receive the vaccine in a matter of days in direct violation of their \nreligious beliefs, or remain faithful to those beliefs and face imminent loss of employment, \nhospital admitting privileges anywhere in the State of New York, and severe damage to their \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 20 of 24\nprofessional  standing,  including  likely  disciplinary  consequences,  as  the  Complaint  alleges \nconcerning each Plaintiff. That Hobson’s choice is a direct result of the Vaccine Mandate and \nplainly constitutes irreparable harm.  \nSecond, as to the balance of harms, the likelihood of irreparable harm to Plaintiffs from \nthe  failure  to  grant  them  interim  relief  clearly  outweighs  the  likelihood  of  any  harm  to \nDefendants from granting such relief.  The Vaccine Mandate definitely and absolutely imposes \nimminent irreparable harm on each of the Plaintiffs, and Defendants cannot show that enjoining \nthat Mandate will cause them any real harm. The Vaccine Mandate already allows health care \nworkers an exemption for reasons of “health,” presumably with reasonable accommodations, and \nthere is no evidence those accommodations will undermine the government’s asserted purposes \nat  issue.  Defendants  cannot  show  that  granting  the  same  accommodations  to  Plaintiffs  for \nreligious reasons would impose any more harm—especially when Plaintiffs have been on the \nfront lines of stopping COVID for the past 18 months while donning PPE and exercising other \nproper protocols in effectively slowing the spread of the disease before the emergence of the \nDelta variant this summer. They merely seek an injunction that “appropriately permits religious \n[conduct] with the same risk-minimizing precautions as similar activities” allowed of health care \nworkers with medical exemptions to the vaccine. Roberts, 958 F.3d at 416. Thus, the balance of \nharms weighs heavily in favor of Plaintiffs.  \nFinally, as to public interest, “treatment of similarly situated [health care providers] in \ncomparable ways serves public health interests at the same time it preserves bedrock free-\nexercise guarantees.” Id. And “securing First Amendment rights is in the public interest.” New \nYork Progress & Prot. PAC v. Walsh, 733 F.3d 483, 488 (2d Cir. 2013). Thus, for the reasons \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 21 of 24\nalready explained, a TRO and injunction enjoining the Vaccine is directly in service of the public \ninterest.  \nIII.  PLAINTIFFS  SATISFY  THE  STANDARD  FOR  PROCEEDING  UNDER \nPSEUDONYMS \nAlthough F.R.C.P. Rule 10(a) generally requires the title of the Complaint to name all \nparties, the Second Circuit recognizes plaintiffs’ rights to proceed pseudonymously when their \ninterest in anonymity outweighs “the public’s interest in disclosure and any prejudice to the \ndefendant.” Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant, 537 F.3d 185, 189 (2d Cir. 2008). The Second \nCircuit has adopted a non-exclusive multi-factor balancing test to resolve this question, see id., \n537 F.3d at 190, and Plaintiffs easily meet at least the following factors:  \n  The  litigation  involves  matters  that  are  “highly  sensitive  and  of  a  personal  nature” \nbecause  Plaintiffs  would  otherwise  be  disclosing  to  the  entire  public  their  personal \nmedical information, including vaccination status, breastfeeding, intended pregnancy, \nCOVID-infection and recovery, in a climate especially hostile to those who are forgoing \nthe COVID vaccines (see below).  \n  Identification  poses  a  substantial  “risk  of  retaliatory  physical  or  mental  harm”  to \nPlaintiffs given the explicit death threats and “terrorist” labels being hurled at those who \nare forgoing the vaccines. (See, e.g., Cmplt., Ex. C (online commentator stating about \nthose attending a vaccine-mandate protest: “The anti-vaxers are ignorant trash and don’t \ndeserve to live. Gun them down while they’re all in one place and let God sort it out.”)). \n  Plaintiffs are “particularly vulnerable” to these possible consequences because of the top-\ndown cultural, societal, and legal assault currently underway against those who forgo the \nvaccines. Nowhere is  this more apparent  than in  the speech by President Biden  on \nSeptember 9, 2021, wherein the nation’s Chief Executive brings down opprobrium on the \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 22 of 24\nheads of Americans who decline vaccination:  “We’ve been patient, but our patience is \nwearing thin, and the refusal has cost all of us….” (emphasis added)  Absent anonymity, \nPlaintiffs would be identified as members of the public who, according to the sitting \nleader of the free world, are “cost[ing] all of us.”4 \n  Plaintiffs are challenging the validity of government, not private, activity and would be \nadmitting to designs to otherwise engage in prohibited conduct in a context where that \nconduct is being demonized by virtually every organ of mainstream  public opinion, \ncomedians, talks show hosts, and the President himself. See, Southern Methodist Univ. \nAss’n of Women Law Students v. Wynne & Jaffe, 599 F.2d 707, 713 (5th Cir. 1979). \n  The defendants are not prejudiced by allowing Plaintiffs to sue anonymously, and “there \nis an atypically weak public interest in knowing the litigants’ identities,” because this \ncase involves “purely legal” issues focusing almost exclusively on whether the Vaccine \nMandate  disrupts  the  fundamental  project  of  our  Founding  Fathers  by  flipping  the \nSupremacy Clause on its head and taking a sledge hammer to the Free Exercise Clause.  \nIn light of these factors, this Court should grant Plaintiffs leave to proceed anonymously.  \n \nIV.  IN THE EVENT THESE MOTIONS ARE DENIED, PLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE \nGRANTED AN INJUNCTION PENDING APPEAL. \nThe standard for obtaining an injunction pending appeal under Fed. R. App. P. Rule 8(a) \n(requiring that Plaintiffs first move for this relief in District Court) is essentially the same as that \nfor obtaining a preliminary injunction. It requires this Court to consider: “(1) whether the stay \napplicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the \n                                                 \n4 Remarks by President Biden on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic, WhiteHouse.gov, Sep. 9, \n2021, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/09/remarks-by-\npresident-biden-on-fighting-the-covid-19-pandemic-3/.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-01009-DNH-ML   Document 5-1   Filed 09/13/21   Page 23 of 24\napplicant will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) whether the issuance of the stay will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the  public \ninterest lies.” In re World Trade Ctr. Disaster Site Litig., 503 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir. 1987).  \nFor the same reasons articulated above (supra, Sections I & II), Plaintiffs easily satisfy all \nfour factors and are entitled to an injunction pending appeal should their motions for a TRO and \nPI be denied.  If the requested injunctive relief is denied, Plaintiffs respectfully request an order \ndenying an IPA as well in order to avoid unnecessary further motion practice. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing  reasons, this Court should grant  Plaintiffs motions  to temporarily \nrestrain  and  preliminary  enjoin  the  Vaccine  Mandate  and  grant  Plaintiffs  leave  to  proceed \nanonymously.  Alternatively,  if  the  requested  injunctive  relief  is  not  granted,  Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request an injunction pending appeal or, failing that, an order denying same.  \n          Respectfully submitted,  \nSeptember 13, 2021 \n   \n   \n__________________________  _________________________ \nMICHAEL G.

Ct. R. 11 ............................................................................................................... 36 \nSup. Ct. R. 23 ............................................................................................................... 35 \n \nix \n\n     \n \nTo the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme \nCourt for the Second Circuit: \nPursuant to Rules 22 and 23 of this Court, and 28 U.S.C. 1651(a), Applicants \nrespectfully request an injunction preventing enforcement of New York’s ban on \nreligious  exemptions  for  healthcare  workers  opposed  to  mandatory  COVID \nvaccination. In the alternative, Applicants ask that enforcement of New York’s rule \nbe stayed, and/or this application be treated as a petition for certiorari and granted, \nso that this Court can promptly address on its merits docket the important issues \npresented here. In either case, Applicants request an administrative stay during the \nemergency briefing and deliberations on this application. \nThis application arises from New York’s extraordinarily punitive COVID vaccine \nmandate, which the district court rightly held is “not a neutral law,” but a “‘religious \ngerrymander’” that “targets religious opposition to the available COVID-19 vaccines.” \nNew York is a national outlier: While 47 states and the federal government respect \nreligious objectors, New York punishes them. In fact, after originally announcing that \nit would respect religious objections, New York made a U-turn, revoking the religious \nexemption entirely, while at the same time broadening its medical exemption. It now \nallows  medically  exempt  unvaccinated  employees  to  continue  normal  job \nresponsibilities so long as they wear personal protective equipment (PPE), but it \nrefuses to allow unvaccinated religious objectors to work on-site at all. Worse, New \nYork  now  even  bars  religious  objectors  who  lose  their  jobs  from  receiving \nunemployment compensation. Other workers’ unemployment claims “are reviewed on \n1 \n\n     \n \na case-by-case basis,” but healthcare workers fired over the vaccine mandate without \na medical exemption “will be ineligible” for unemployment benefits.  \nNew York’s approach is therefore nothing like the “across-the-board” law in Smith \nthat only “incidentally” burdened religion, and it should easily have triggered strict \nscrutiny under Fulton and Tandon—as the district court correctly held. Indeed, New \nYork’s recent addition of a categorical denial of unemployment compensation to \nreligious  objectors  makes  this  an  easy  case  under  this  Court’s  unemployment-\ncompensation cases—Sherbert, Thomas, and Hobbie—which all survived Smith.  \nThe Second Circuit candidly acknowledged that New York’s mandate imposes \n“meaningful  burdens”  on  Applicants’  religious  exercise.  But  it  held  that  those \n“meaningful  burdens”—even  on  a  textual  constitutional  right—were  not  “of  a \nconstitutional dimension.” The panel openly admitted that it is “reasonable” to treat \nunvaccinated employees as “present[ing] statistically comparable risks” of spreading \nCOVID, whether they were unvaccinated for religious or medical reasons. And the \npanel acknowledged that medically exempt employees were allowed to “continue \nnormal job responsibilities” while wearing PPE—an option categorically denied to \nreligious objectors. But the panel nevertheless applied only rational basis review, \nrelying in part on decisions from other circuits that have badly misconstrued the Free \nExercise Clause, including the heavily criticized decisions in 303 Creative LLC v. \nElenis, 746 Fed. Appx. 709 (10th Cir. 2018), and Stormans v. Wiesman, 794 F.3d 1064 \n(9th Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 2433 (2016) (No. 15-862) (Alito, J., dissenting). \nAnd it deepened the circuit split between Dahl v. Board of Trustees of Western \n2 \n\n     \n \nMichigan University, 15 F.4th 728 (6th Cir. 2021) and Does v. Mills, No. 21-1826, \n2021 WL 4860328 (1st Cir. Oct. 19, 2021). As a result, Applicants and thousands of \nother healthcare workers are poised to suffer irreparable harm, even while 47 other \nstates  and  the  federal  government  demonstrate  that  such  harm  is  entirely \nunnecessary.  \nThe panel did agree that New York’s mandate cannot override the civil rights \nprotections provided to employees by Title VII. And on November 5, the federal \ngovernment issued its own vaccine mandates which repeatedly emphasized that \nreligious employees retain their full Title VII right to reasonable accommodation. Yet \nrather than interpret its rule to be consistent with Title VII and the new federal rules, \nNew  York  has  now  informed  this  Court  that  its  rule  allows  far  less:  the  only \naccommodation New York will allow is complete removal of the religious employee \nfrom the category of “personnel” under the rule. Response Br. at 36, We the Patriots, \nInc. v. Hochul, No. 21A125 (Nov. 10, 2021) (citing the definition of “personnel” at \nSection 2.61(a)(2)). New York now even admits that the injunction in this case was \n“preventing”  New  York  from  “interfering”  with  employers’  voluntary  grants  of \nreligious exemptions. Response Br. at 13. Under Title VII, an employer who can \nreasonably accommodate an employee’s religious exercise must do so, and states are \nnot empowered to “interfere” with federal law. New York’s aggressive position also \ndirectly contradicts recent EEOC guidance on Title VII, and it means that Applicants \ncannot be accommodated on-site, even when their employers previously determined \nthat they could be accommodated without undue hardship.  \n3 \n\n     \n \nIf New York reverses course here and agrees to (1) allow employers to offer the \nfull scope of Title VII protections and (2) allow religious objectors to continue their \n“normal job responsibilities” alongside their medically-exempt coworkers who are \ndoing the same, then this Court could safely deny the petition. Ideally, any such \ndenial would be accompanied by a statement clarifying that the basis for doing so is \nNew York’s acknowledgement that its law allows employers to offer what Title VII \nand the Free Exercise Clause require. But if New York offers anything less—if it \ncontinues  to  assert  the  power  to  “interfere”  in  religious  but  not  medical \naccommodations—then  this  Court  should  either  issue  an  injunction  or  grant \ncertiorari now to address these recurring issues on the merits docket. \nFinally,  while  a  typical  employment  dispute  will  not  necessitate  emergency \nintervention, this case is anything but typical. Applicant healthcare workers face \nwhat the panel deemed “difficult, apparently unusual questions as to imminent \nirreparable harm.” That is because the panel found it “not at all clear” that Applicants \ncould ever recover meaningful remedies from either the State or employers under the \ncurrent    mandate.  Worse,  unlike  typical  Title  VII  plaintiffs,  Applicants  will  be \nforeclosed  by  the  State  from  pursuing  other  job  prospects  in  their  fields  and \nsimultaneously prevented even from obtaining unemployment benefits to feed their \nfamilies while their case proceeds. New York has attainted them in all but name. \nJust  as  with  COVID  worship  restrictions,  vaccine  mandates  raise  difficult \nquestions about balancing indubitably strong public health interests on one side and \ncore constitutional rights on the other. But it is not difficult to see that New York’s \n4 \n\n     \n \nuniquely  punitive  treatment  of  religious  objectors,  which  is  an  extreme  outlier \nnationally,  violates  the  Free  Exercise  Clause.  All  Americans,  especially  our \nhealthcare workers, deserve better. \nJURISDICTION \n  Applicants appeal from the Second Circuit’s reversal of the district court’s grant \nof a preliminary injunction. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1651.  \nBACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nA. The Applicants \n“Heroes work here.” This phrase describes Applicants, healthcare workers who \nhave served tirelessly during all phases of the COVID pandemic, since long before \nvaccines were available. For example, Therapist I is a Catholic brain injury specialist \nwho temporarily served in the COVID unit of a nursing home to help with staffing \nshortages, and then returned to his rehabilitation clinic. Appx.155 ¶¶ 91-92.1 Doctor \nJ is a Catholic OB/GYN who treated many patients with COVID while she herself \nwas pregnant. Appx.156 ¶ 99. Dr. O is a Catholic surgeon who treated many COVID \npatients, Appx.163 ¶ 141, and Dr. F is a Catholic oral surgeon who never turned away \na patient with COVID who needed care in the rural upstate region that his clinic \nserves. Appx.152 ¶ 76. Dr. P is a third-year OB/GYN resident who cared for many \nCOVID patients during her ICU rotation. Appx.165 ¶ 151. Three Applicants are \n \n1    Applicants’  verified  complaint  contains  signed,  sworn  declarations  from  each \nApplicant confirming its accuracy. Respondents have not refuted any of Applicants’ \nfactual assertions. As permitted by the district court, Applicants are proceeding \nunder pseudonyms due to the tangible harms, including retaliation, that they would \nexperience by identifying themselves publicly. Appx.87; Appx.140-143. \n5 \n\n     \n \ncurrently breastfeeding, and four have already recovered from COVID. Appx.156, \n158, 161-162, 165, 167-169. \nAll 17 Applicants have uncontested sincere religious objections to the COVID \nvaccines  due  to  their  origin  from  “abortion-derived  fetal  cell  lines  in  testing, \ndevelopment, or production.” Appx.144-145. These objections are rooted in the devout \nCatholic beliefs of 16 Applicants and the devout Baptist beliefs of Nurse J. Neither \nthe Respondents nor the courts have questioned Applicants’ sincerity or religiosity. \nB. New York’s Mandate \nAs the district court recognized, New York’s state of emergency officially ended in \nJune 2021.2 Yet the state’s use of emergency powers did not. On August 18, 2021, \nRespondent Zucker issued an initial vaccine mandate for health care workers which \nincluded  an  explicit  medical  and  religious  exemption,  with  the  stated  goal  of \n“reduc[ing] the spread of the Delta variant.”3 The religious exemption provided that \n“[c]overed entities shall grant a religious exemption for COVID-19 vaccination for \ncovered personnel if they hold a genuine and sincere religious belief” contrary to \nreceiving the COVID vaccine. Appx.103-104 at (c)(2) (emphasis added). The medical \nexemption applied if “any licensed physician or certified nurse practitioner certifie[d]” \nthat receiving the vaccine would be “detrimental” based on a “specific pre-existing \nhealth condition,” “only until” the vaccine is no longer “detrimental to the health” of \nthat employee. Appx.103 at (c)(1). \n \n2   N.Y. Exec. Order 210 (June 24, 2021), https://perma.cc/HA9J-DYR4. \n3    N.Y. State Governor’s Office, Governor Cuomo Announces COVID-19 Vaccination \nMandate for Healthcare Workers (Aug. 16, 2021), https://perma.cc/ZBP3-Y778.  \n6 \n\n     \n \nEight days later, on August 26, New York announced an updated version of the \nmandate. Governor Kathy Hochul explained at a news conference that the religious \nexemption was “left off,” and that this omission was done “intentionally.”4 At the same \nconference, Governor Hochul stated that she is not aware of a “sanctioned religious \nexemption from any organized religion” and that “everybody from the Pope on down \nis encouraging people to get vaccinated.”5 This new “emergency” mandate, issued by \nthe same commissioner (Respondent Zucker) and adopted by the Department of \nHealth, is the operative mandate before this Court and requires most healthcare \nworkers to be vaccinated within 30 days. Appx.107-131. The primary change in the \nAugust 26 rule was to remove the religious exemption entirely. The only changes to \nthe medical exemption made it broader; the rule added that it is “inapplicable” \nentirely in the case of medical exemptions instead of requiring they be “subject to a \nreasonable  accommodation,”  and  it  removed  the  requirement  that  medical \nexemptions  are  for  “specific”  conditions.  Compare  Appx.109,  § 2.61(d)(1)  with \nAppx.103 at (c)(1). \nNew York’s about-face immediately harmed Applicants, other religious objectors, \nand the healthcare system. Four Applicants had received religious exemptions before \nAugust  26,  only  to  have  them  revoked  after  the  mandate  removed  religious \nexemptions. Appx.148 ¶ 49 (Nurse A); Appx.152 ¶ 77 (Dr. F); Appx.163-164 ¶¶ 142-\n143 (Dr. O); Appx.169 ¶ 174 (Dr. S). Nurse A’s employer explained that it “must follow \n \n4    N.Y. State Governor’s Office, Video & Rough Transcript: Governor Hochul Holds \nQ&A Following COVID-19 Briefing (Sept. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/5DY6-S7KM. \n5   Ibid. \n7 \n\n     \n \nNYS DOH requirements as they evolve. This means that [the hospital] can no longer \nconsider any religious exemptions to the COVID vaccination even those previously \napproved.” Appx.148 ¶ 49. Dr. O’s employer revoked his religious exemption because \n“under the emergency regulations the NYS DOH will not permit exemptions or \ndeferrals for sincerely held religious beliefs.” Appx.164 ¶¶ 142-143. Several other \nemployers told employees that they wanted to grant religious exemptions, but the \nstate mandate prevented them. See, e.g., Appx.158-159 ¶ 112 (Nurse J was advised \nby executive director of home care agency that “my hands are tied” because no \nreligious exemption is possible due to the mandate). Thousands of healthcare workers \nmust now either violate their consciences or lose their jobs.6  At the same time, New \nYork faces a severe shortage of medical professionals, which Governor Hochul has \ndeclared a “statewide disaster emergency.” The governor has authorized calling in \nmedical personnel who are not licensed in New York, authorizing practice by recent \ngraduates not  yet licensed  anywhere,  bringing  medical  professionals from  other \ncountries, and, if necessary, deploying the National Guard.7  \nAfter prohibiting religious exemptions, New York then announced that employees \nterminated for declining the vaccine would be made ineligible for unemployment \ninsurance. New York introduced this additional penalty on September 25, just two \ndays  before  the  original  deadline  for  vaccination.

District Court Proceedings \nOn September 14, the district court granted Applicants’ motion for temporary \nrestraining order against the mandate. Appx.56-60. On October 12, the district court \nissued a preliminary injunction, determining that Applicants were likely to succeed \non their Free Exercise claim because Section 2.61 is “not a neutral law” but a \n“‘religious gerrymander’ that triggers heightened scrutiny” because it “effectively \ntargets religious opposition to the available COVID-19 vaccines.” Appx.79, 80. The \ncourt also found that Section 2.61 is not generally applicable because it includes a \nbroad medical exemption, although the unvaccinated for medical reasons pose the \nsame  “unacceptable”  workplace  risk  as  the  unvaccinated  for  religious  reasons. \nAppx.81. Respondents were likely to fail strict scrutiny because they did not explain \nwhy the reasonable accommodations that Section 2.61 guarantees for the medically \nexempt could not also extend to religious objectors, nor did they explain “why they \nchose to depart from  * * *  other jurisdictions that include the kind of religious \nexemption that was originally present in the August 18 order.” Appx.83.  \nThe court also held that Applicants were likely to prevail on their argument that \nTitle VII preempted Section 2.61, because Title VII demands “favored treatment” for \nreligious employees through reasonable accommodations. Appx.74 (quoting EEOC v. \n \n13  N.Y. State Governor’s Office, Video, Audio, Photos & Rush Transcript: Governor \nHochul Attends Services at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem (Sept. 12, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/PV76-EWAZ.  \n10 \n\n     \n \nAbercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 575 U.S. 768, 775 (2015)). Yet the “broad scope” of \nSection  2.61  has  “effectively  foreclosed  the  pathway  to  seeking  a  religious \naccommodation  that  is  guaranteed  under  Title  VII,”  by  preventing  Applicants’ \nemployers from granting religious exemptions or engaging in the interactive process \nthat Title VII requires. Appx.76. \nThough this injunction merely gave employers the ability to provide religious \nexemptions, without requiring any, employers quickly granted religious exemptions \nto  roughly  2.4%  of  the  healthcare  workforce  (15,844  employees  statewide), \ndemonstrating that they could do so without undue hardship.14 This injunction also \nprotected 15 of the 17 Applicants, who either received religious exemptions for the \nfirst  time,  had  their  original  exemptions  restored,  or  were  allowed  to  continue \nworking under indefinite status. Appx.201-202. \nD. Second Circuit Proceedings \nOn October 29, 2021, the Second Circuit issued an order reversing the Northern \nDistrict’s grant of preliminary injunction in this case and affirming the Eastern \nDistrict’s denial of preliminary injunction in We the Patriots, Inc. v. Hochul. The panel \nissued  a  partial  mandate  immediately,  ordering  the  district  court  to  vacate  its \ninjunction and  conduct  “further  proceedings consistent  with this  Order  and  the \nforthcoming opinion of this Court.” Appx.2-3.   \n \n14  Rob Frehse, New York State Health Care Workers Will No Longer Have Religious \nExemption to COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, Court Rules, CNN (Oct. 29, 2021, 10:29 \nPM), https://perma.cc/UK6M-EHKR. \n \n11 \n\n     \n \nThe Second Circuit followed with a per curiam opinion on November 4. The court \nacknowledged that Applicants here are “subject to meaningful burdens on their \nreligious practice” yet described their harm as “not of a constitutional dimension.” \nAppx.46. Citing the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Stormans v. Wiesman and the Tenth \nCircuit’s 303 Creative v. Elenis, the Second Circuit emphasized that “[t]he mere \nexistence of an exemption procedure, absent any showing that secularly motivated \nconduct could be impermissibly favored over religiously motivated conduct,” does not \ntrigger  strict  scrutiny.  Appx.37  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Finding the \nmandate neutral and generally applicable, the Second Circuit concluded that it is \nsubject to only rational basis review. Appx.39. Without claiming any difference in the \nrisk of spreading COVID, the panel found that an unvaccinated medically exempt \nemployee could nevertheless be “substantially distinguish[ed]” from an unvaccinated \nreligious objector by relying heavily on “limited data” suggesting religious objections \nwere more common, drawn from affidavits New York filed in a state-court action \nweeks after the injunction was entered here. Appx.34. Despite recognizing that “this \ncase raises difficult, apparently unusual questions as to imminent irreparable harm,” \nthe Second Circuit also concluded that the mandate didn’t violate Title VII because \nit “does not foreclose all opportunity” for religious claimants “to secure a reasonable \naccommodation” since religious objectors could be given remote “assignments—such \nas telemedicine.” Appx.41-42, 47.  \nOn November 5, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York \nvacated the preliminary injunction. Appx.56-60. \n12 \n\n     \n \nE. Consequences for Applicants  \nAs result of the mandate, Applicants will lose their current jobs, lose their ability \nto  find  any  other  jobs  in  their  field  throughout  New  York,  and  be  denied \nunemployment  benefits.  For  example,  the  six  Applicants  who  are  doctors  and \nsurgeons  will  lose  admitting  privileges  at  hospitals,  rendering  them  unable  to \npractice their medical specialties or perform surgeries. Appx.150 ¶¶ 61-62; Appx.153 \n¶¶ 79-80; Appx.154 ¶¶ 86-87; Appx.157 ¶¶ 103-104; Appx.164 ¶¶ 144-145; Appx.169 \n¶¶ 174-177 (hospital administration notified Dr. S that failure to prove vaccination \nwill result in suspension of hospital privileges). For Nurse D, who has $50,000 in \nstudent loans and whose job provides “a vital source” of income and health insurance \nfor her family, the mandate and its punitive denial of unemployment benefits will \nprove financially devastating. Appx.151 ¶¶ 66-69. Two Applicants who are residents, \nDr. M and Dr. P, face the imminent loss of their residencies and destruction of their \ncareers, since they cannot practice independently without a residency, will not be able \nto find other residencies anywhere in New York to accept them, and will face adverse \nconsequences for licensure. Appx.160-161, 165-166. \nThese consequences directly harm the patients and communities that Applicants \nserve. For example, Dr. C will no longer be able to perform eye surgeries, even though \nhis  clinic  did  10,000  surgeries  during  2020  without  any  COVID  cases  (or  staff \nvaccinations). Appx.149-150 ¶ 57. Oral surgeon Dr. F, whose private clinic is vital to \nhis rural upstate area and never turned away a patient with COVID, will no longer \nbe able to perform surgeries. Appx.152-153 ¶¶ 76, 79. And all this is occurring at a \n13 \n\n     \n \ntime when Governor Hochul herself publicly emphasized New York’s need for more \nhealthcare workers.15 \nWhat is more, the Second Circuit recognized that Applicants lack a remedy for the \ndevastating financial losses they face—yet didn’t “place any weight” on that issue. \nAppx.47. The court acknowledged that seeking lost wages would likely be fruitless: if \nApplicants seek money damages under Title VII, the Second Circuit opined that their \nemployers could “make a persuasive argument that they should not have to pay \nbecause they were in effect compelled by law to terminate the employment,” and if \nApplicants  sought  to  sue  New  York,  sovereign  immunity  would  likely  prevent \nrecovery of damages. Appx.47.  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE APPLICATION \nUnder the All Writs Act, this Court “may issue all writs necessary or appropriate” \nthat aid its jurisdiction and are permitted by law. 28 U.S.C. 1651(a). An injunction \npending disposition of a petition for a timely writ of certiorari is permissible where \n“applicants have clearly established their entitlement to relief pending appellate \nreview.” Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 66 (2020) (per \ncuriam) (granting injunctions pending appeal to application filed under 28 U.S.C. \n1651(a)).  This  showing  is  made  where  applicants  demonstrate  “that  their  First \nAmendment claims are likely to prevail, that denying them relief would lead to \n \n15  In  September,  Governor  Hochul  declared  a  “Statewide  Disaster  Emergency” \nbecause  of  the  shortage  of  healthcare  workers,  justifying  bringing  in  licensed \nproviders  from  other  states  and  countries,  unlicensed  recent  graduates,  and,  if \nnecessary, deploying the National Guard.  See N.Y. Exec. Order No. 4 (Sept. 27, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/34X8-UFQ6.   \n14 \n\n     \n \nirreparable injury, and that granting relief would not harm the public interest.” Ibid. \n(citing Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)); see also Tandon v. \nNewsom, 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1297 (2021) (per curiam) (same). Applicants satisfy this \nstandard. \nI.  Applicants are likely to prevail because New York’s ban on religious \nexemptions violates the Free Exercise Clause.  \nA. Applicants have made out a prima facie Free Exercise case because \ntheir claims are both sincere and religious. \nNo claim under the Free Exercise Clause can be made unless it is both sincere and \nreligious. See Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215-216 (1972). Proving so is the \nreligious claimant’s burden. See id. at 235. Here, Applicants have put unchallenged \nsworn evidence into the record that their beliefs are sincere and have maintained \nthem in the face of loss of job, career, and unemployment benefits. Appx.147-172. And \nthey have also presented sworn testimony that their beliefs are religious, based in \ntheir respective Catholic and Baptist beliefs. Ibid. Moreover, Applicants have also \nexplained the severe burden on those beliefs. Ibid. Accordingly, New York has not \ncontested these issues, and the courts below accepted them as proven. Appx.66, 9. \nB. New York’s ban is not neutral or generally applicable. \nThough it acknowledged that the religious exemption ban subjects Applicants “to \nmeaningful  burdens  on  their  religious  practice,”  the  Second  Circuit  said  those \nburdens were “not of a constitutional dimension” under Employment Division v. \nSmith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). Appx.46. But New York’s rule is not subject to Smith \nbecause it is neither neutral nor generally applicable in several ways: it permits \nsecular conduct while banning comparable religious conduct that occurs in exactly \n15 \n\n     \n \nthe same place and at the same time, it contains an individualized exemption for \nmedical  exemptions,  it  targeted  religion  by  removing  a  religious  exemption, \ngovernment officials confirmed the targeting in announcements surrounding the new \nrule, and it punitively and selectively denies unemployment compensation.  \nThe rule is therefore subject to strict scrutiny, a test New York cannot satisfy.   \n1.  New York’s medical exemption treats comparable secular conduct \nbetter than religious conduct.  \nA law “lacks general applicability if it prohibits religious conduct while permitting \nsecular conduct that undermines the government’s asserted interests in a similar \nway.” Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021); accord Tandon, \n141 S. Ct. at 1296. “Comparability is concerned with the risks various activities pose, \nnot the reasons why” those activities are undertaken. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1296.  \nAs the district court correctly found, New York fails this test. New York forbids \nreligious  objectors  from  working  on-site—deeming  their  risk  of  COVID  spread \n“unacceptably high”—but then tolerates precisely the same risk from those with a \nmedical  exemption.  Appx.81-82.  Employees  with  a  medical  exemption  are  not \nrequired by the State to work off-site, or even to undertake any special precautions \nto  prevent  contracting  or  transmitting  COVID  other  than  using  PPE.  Instead, \nmedically exempt employees are permitted to continue their normal job duties. Where \nthe government grants accommodations for secular interests, as here, it “may not \nrefuse to extend” those accommodations “to cases of ‘religious hardship’ without \ncompelling reason.” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1878 (quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 884). \n16 \n\n     \n \nThe Second Circuit resisted this conclusion, but only superficially. First, the panel \ndid not dispute the central claim—“that any individual unvaccinated employee is \nlikely to present statistically comparable risks of both contracting and spreading \nCOVID-19  at  any  given  healthcare  facility,  irrespective  of  the  reason  that  the \nemployee is unvaccinated.” Appx.33 (admitting this claim is “reasonable”). Nor has \nNew York at any point disputed that an unvaccinated employee carries the same risk \nof COVID spread regardless of their reasons for remaining unvaccinated. Presumably \nthat is because the virus is no respecter of persons. A medically exempt employee \npresents exactly the same risk of COVID spread as a religiously exempt one. \nSecond,  the  panel  credited  the  State’s  claim  that  the  exemptions  are  not \ncomparable because the medical exemption is needed to ensure those employees “are \nable to continue working” and therefore will not contribute to “staffing shortages.” \nAppx.30.  But  a  fired  religious  objector,  of  course,  will  not  be  able  “to  continue \nworking” either and likewise will contribute to “staffing shortages.” Appx.30.  \nThird, the court of appeals also allowed New York to rely on later-filed affidavits \nfrom a state trial-court proceeding to assert that there are more religious objections \nthan medical exemptions, an assertion that factored heavily into the court’s analysis \non comparability.16 That is simply an effort to distract—even the possibility of secular \n \n16  The Second Circuit repeatedly claimed that Applicants had failed to meet their \nevidentiary  burden  to  obtain  a  preliminary  injunction.  Appx.22,  29,  43.  But  to \nsubstantiate  this  claim,  the  court  leaned  heavily  on  Respondents’  extra-record \nevidence that was never before the district court, was not cited until the appeal, and \nwas only admitted in a state trial-court proceeding where the Applicants never had \nan opportunity to contest it. Appx.15-16. Among other problems with this evidence is \n \n17 \n\n     \n \nexemptions that undermine the government’s interest “in a similar way” as religious \nconduct defeats general applicability. Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1877. Here, New York has \nnow acknowledged to this Court that there are thousands of people with medical \nexemptions who are currently allowed to continue doing their jobs. Response Br. at \n13-14, We the Patriots, Inc., No. 21A125 (Nov. 10, 2021). If thousands of unvaccinated \npeople can be exempt for secular reasons, then the law is not generally applicable, \nand New York needs to satisfy strict scrutiny as to why it allows zero religious \nexemptions.17  \n2.  New  York’s  broadened  medical  exemption  is  an  individualized \nexemption.  \nNew York’s medical exemption means that many employees are eligible for and \nreceive  exemptions  based  on  their  individual  circumstances  as  viewed  by  their \n \nthat it does not clearly demonstrate the central point for which it is cited: the number \nof religious objectors. Appx.16. Rather, the raw data on which Respondents rely only \nshows that hospitals cited non-medical bases for exemption, which Respondents self-\nservingly extrapolated to be synonymous with “religious” requests. Appx.16.    \n17  In light of vaccination rates well above 90% in the healthcare sector, New York \nhas failed to explain why medically exempt employees can be permitted to remain on-\nsite while religious objectors are banished. Although New York has never specified \nits target, in Does v. Mills, the Director of Maine’s CDC also stated a goal of 90% \nvaccination rate in healthcare facilities, No. 21A90, 2021 WL 5027177, at *4 (Oct. 29, \n2021) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting), a goal New York has already exceeded. If New York \nwishes to defend this treatment of religious objectors, it must satisfy strict scrutiny \nby  demonstrating  that  its  differential  treatment  is  the  least  restrictive  way  of \nfurthering a compelling governmental interest. But even under New York’s suspect \nnumbers, 96% of hospital healthcare workers have received at least one dose of the \nvaccine, and New York only claims that 1.3% of hospital workers raised a religious \nobjection to COVID vaccination. Appx.15-16. New York has not explained how, at \nthose levels, eliminating religious exemptions allowed by virtually every other state \nand the federal government is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling \ngovernment interest.  \n18 \n\n     \n \nindividual healthcare providers. But a “law is not generally applicable if it invites the \ngovernment to consider the particular reasons for a person’s conduct by providing a \nmechanism for individualized exemptions.” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1877. \nThe  panel  found  that  these  medical  exemptions  were  not  “individualized \nexemptions” by relying on 303 Creative and Stormans for the proposition that an \nexemption  that  “objectively  defined  categories  of  persons”  is  not  individualized. \nAppx.36. According to the panel, “[t]he ‘mere existence of an exemption procedure,’ \nabsent any showing that secularly motivated conduct could be impermissibly favored \nover  religiously motivated  conduct  is not  enough  to  render  a  law  not  generally \napplicable.”  Appx.37.  But  this  Court’s  cases  say  the  exact  opposite,  that  “[t]he \ncreation of a formal mechanism for granting exceptions renders a policy not generally \napplicable, regardless whether any exceptions have been given,” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at \n1879, and New York has already demonstrated that it does favor secular medical \nreasons over religious reasons for remaining unvaccinated, Mills, 2021 WL 5027177, \nat *2 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (discussing Maine’s individualized exemptions from its \nvaccine mandate). \n3.  New York targeted religion by removing the religious exemption.  \nGovernment actions are not neutral when the government “proceeds in a manner \nintolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature.” \nFulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1877. Here, New York failed to act neutrally when it removed \nan existing religious exemption while broadening the medical exemption. The Second \nCircuit excused this action as not “intended to ‘target’” religious objectors. Appx.26. \nBut New York made a deliberate choice to burden religious conduct qua religious \n19 \n\n     \n \nconduct while broadening the exemption for comparable secular conduct. This is on \nits face not neutral as to religion, and it is certainly not the type of “across-the-board \ncriminal prohibition” that “incidentally” burdened religion in Smith. 494 U.S. at 884. \nLaws that fail to operate “without regard to religion,” or that otherwise “single out \nthe religious” for disfavored treatment, “clear[ly]  * * *  impose[] a penalty on the free \nexercise  of  religion  that  triggers  the  most  exacting  scrutiny.”  Trinity  Lutheran \nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2020-2021 (2017). \nApplicants’ experiences confirm this non-neutrality. Four of them had been offered \nexemptions by their employers, and those exemptions were permitted under New \nYork’s August 18 rule. Appx.148 ¶ 49 (Nurse A); Appx.152 ¶ 77 (Dr. F); Appx.163 \n¶ 142 (Dr. O); Appx.169 ¶ 174 (Dr. S). New York then categorically forbade religious \nexemptions  on  August  26.  And  Applicants’  employers  revoked  the  prior \naccommodations  precisely  because  the  objections  were  religious.  Appx.148  ¶  49 \n(hospital revoking Nurse A’s religious exemption because it “must follow NYS DOH \nrequirements as they evolve. This means that [the hospital] can no longer consider \nany religious exemptions to the COVID vaccination even those previously approved”); \nAppx.163-164 ¶¶ 142-143 (hospital revoking Dr. O’s religious exemption because \n“under the emergency regulations the NYS DOH will not permit exemptions or \ndeferrals for sincerely held religious beliefs”). That is not “neutral” treatment that \njust happens “incidentally” to burden religion.  \n20 \n\n     \n \n4.  New York officials targeted religious objectors.  \nNew York officials’ speech surrounding the revocation of the religious exemption \ndemonstrated that the ban was not religiously neutral, but rather reflected antipathy \ntoward religious objectors. Governor Hochul spoke twice to religious audiences using \ndisparaging  language  about  religious  objectors  that  could  not  have  been \nmisconstrued:  “How  can  you  believe  that  God  would  give  a  vaccine  that \nwould cause you harm? That is not the truth. Those are just lies out there on social \nmedia.”18  At  another  church  service,  she  said,  “All  of  you,  yes,  I  know  you’re \nvaccinated, you’re the smart ones, but you know there’s people out there who aren’t \nlistening  to  God  and  what  God  wants.  You  know  who  they  are.”19  And  when \nexplaining  why New  York “left  off” religious  exemptions  “intentionally,”  Hochul \nexplained  that  she  is  not  aware  of  a  “sanctioned  religious  exemption  from  any \norganized religion” and that “everybody from the Pope on down is encouraging people \nto get vaccinated.”20 \nThis is the opposite of “the requisite religious neutrality that must be strictly \nobserved”  by  the  government.

Id. at 1731. And if Government actions are indeed based \non “impermissible hostility toward  * * *  sincere religious beliefs,” they are per se \nunconstitutional. Id. at 1729. Given that not even courts should “undertake to dissect \nreligious beliefs” or resolve “intrafaith differences” because they “are not arbiters of \nscriptural interpretation,” governors certainly lack that power. Thomas v. Review Bd. \nof Ind. Emp. Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 715-716 (1981). \nThe  Second  Circuit  excused  Governor  Hochul’s  sermons  as  mere  “personal \nopinion” consistent with a “religion-neutral government interest.” Appx.28-29. But \naccusing  religious  objectors of not  “listening  to  God  and  what  God wants,”  and \ndeclaring that “God would [not] give a vaccine that would cause you harm,” supra at \n9-10, are not the words of a “neutral decisionmaker who would give full and fair \nconsideration” to contrary religious beliefs. Masterpiece, 138 S. Ct. at 1732. Rather, \nthey improperly “suggest[]” that “the religious ground for [Applicants’] conscience \nbased objections is  * * *  illegitimate.” Id. at 1731. That’s particularly true when the \nwords are considered in context, coming shortly after New York removed its religious \nexemption, and shortly before Governor Hochul’s office announced that New York \nwould categorically deny unemployment benefits to workers fired because of the \nvaccine mandate.  \nNone of this is “neutral” lawmaking that only “incidentally” burdens religious \nexercise. To the contrary, by removing an existing religious exemption, denouncing \nthe beliefs of religious objectors, and proclaiming that God was on the side of the \n22 \n\n     \n \nState, New York officials have—yet again—failed to act neutrally. See Diocese of \nBrooklyn, 141 S. Ct. at 65-66 (enjoining “very severe restrictions” that “treat[ed] \nhouses of worship much more harshly than comparable secular facilities”). Strict \nscrutiny applies.   \nC. New  York’s  ban  independently  triggers  strict  scrutiny  by \ncategorically  denying  unemployment  compensation  to  religious \nobjectors. \nNew York’s approach also triggers strict scrutiny because of its newest feature: \nthe selective and punitive deprivation of unemployment benefits. Governor Hochul \nannounced on September 25—just days before the vaccination deadline—that the \nState had gerrymandered its unemployment insurance coverage to target religious \nobjectors.  The  governor  warned  that  New  York  was  eliminating  unemployment \nbenefits for employees terminated for refusing a COVID vaccination.21 While other \nworkers will have their applications “reviewed on a case-by-case basis,” healthcare \nworkers who “are terminated for refusing an employer-mandated vaccination will be \nineligible.”22 The only exception is for terminated employees who seek a “medical \naccommodation.” See supra n.21. Thus, Applicants are categorically “ineligible” for \nrefusing vaccination because of their religious beliefs.23  \n \n21  N.Y. State Governor’s Office, In Preparation for Monday Vaccination Deadline, \nGovernor Hochul Releases Comprehensive Plan to Address Preventable Health Care \nStaffing Shortage (Sept. 25, 2021), https://perma.cc/2GJV-TLQW.  \n22  N.Y.  State  Dep’t  of  Health,  Unemployment  Insurance  Top  Frequently  Asked \nQuestions (Sept. 25, 2021), https://perma.cc/Y4LL-KKFR.  \n23 Ibid.  \n23 \n\n     \n \nNew York has prejudged that religious reasons for refusing vaccination can never \namount  to  good  cause  for  losing  one’s  job.  This  vindictive  approach  is  the \nquintessential example of a law that violates the Free Exercise Clause, even under \nSmith. Cf. Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 401, 403-404 (1963) (striking down state \nunemployment commission decision that a religious objection to working on Saturday \nwas not “good cause” for refusing work).  \nSmith observed that the Court had applied strict scrutiny to invalidate state \nunemployment compensation rules three times: in Sherbert, Thomas, and Hobbie v. \nUnemployment Appeals Commission of Florida, 480 U.S. 136 (1987). 494 U.S. at 883. \nSmith expressly distinguished these as unemployment benefits cases, characterizing \nthem as “stand[ing] for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of \nindividual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of ‘religious \nhardship’  without  compelling  reason.”  Id.  at  884;  see  Hobbie,  480  U.S.  at  146 \n(explaining  that,  under  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  of  the  First  Amendment,  the \ngovernment “may not force an employee ‘to choose between following the precepts of \nher religion and forfeiting benefits, . . . and abandoning one of the precepts of her \nreligion in order to accept work’” (citation omitted)). But that is exactly what New \nYork has done here: religious objectors are categorically ineligible for unemployment \nbenefits. Under Sherbert, Thomas, and Hobbie—which Smith emphasized were not \noverruled—the vaccine mandate violates the Free Exercise Clause.  \n \n \n24 \n\n     \n \nD. New York’s ban fails strict scrutiny. \nSince the rule is not neutral and generally applicable, New York bears the burden \nof satisfying strict scrutiny. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1296. Strict scrutiny is “the most \ndemanding test known to constitutional law.” City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, \n534 (1997). To meet strict scrutiny, New York must show that it has a compelling \ninterest,  which is an  interest  “of  the  highest  order,”  in  requiring  these  specific \nApplicants to violate their religious beliefs. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente \nUniao do Vegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429-430 (2006). Even when the government has \nidentified such an interest, the restriction on religious exercise “must be actually \nnecessary to the solution.” Brown v. Entertainment Merchs. Ass’n, 564 U.S. 786, 799 \n(2011). “That is a demanding standard.” Ibid. And “because [the government] bears \nthe risk of uncertainty, ambiguous proof will not suffice.” Id. at 799-800 (internal \ncitations omitted). “[S]o long as the government can achieve its interests in a manner \nthat does not burden religion, it must do so.” Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1881.  \nEven though this Court has held that limiting the spread of COVID is a compelling \ngovernment interest, see Diocese of Brooklyn, 141 S. Ct. at 67, New York cannot show \nthat its vaccine mandate and vindictive punishments of healthcare workers even \nafter they are fired is the least restrictive means of advancing its interests.  \n1.  New York has not shown that it needs greater restrictions than \n47 other states and the federal government.  \nNew York’s restrictions are a national outlier. First, even though they face the \nsame  public  health  problems,  47  other  states  have  not  imposed  any  COVID \nvaccination mandate on private-sector healthcare workers, have allowed religious \n25 \n\n     \n \nexemptions, or have allowed accommodations like weekly testing. See Addendum. \nOnly 14 states and the District of Columbia require private-sector healthcare workers \nto be vaccinated against COVID. Of these, all but three either provide for religious \nexemptions or allow employees to undergo testing instead of vaccination. Only New \nYork, Rhode Island, and Maine require private-sector healthcare workers to receive \nCOVID vaccines with no religious accommodation or testing alternative. “[W]hen so \nmany” other jurisdictions “offer an accommodation, [New York] must, at a minimum, \noffer persuasive reasons why it believes that it must take a different course.” Holt v. \nHobbs, 574 U.S. 352, 369 (2015). \nWhen  enacting  COVID  vaccine  mandates  at  the  national  level,  the  federal \ngovernment has likewise been careful to emphasize that religious employees continue \nto be protected by federal employment laws such as Title VII. Thus, when enacting \nthe federal employee vaccine mandate, the government stated that federal agencies \nare “required to provide a reasonable accommodation to employees  * * *  because of \na sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance.”24 And both the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandate for private employers and the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandate for certain health care \nproviders state that Title VII requires employers to offer reasonable accommodations \nto employees who object to the vaccine on religious grounds.25 Where, as here, New \n \n24  Safer Federal Workforce, Vaccinations, https://perma.cc/599Q-XQWR. \n25  Under  the  OSHA  mandate,  private  employers  that  mandate  vaccines  in  the \nhealthcare  context  or  elsewhere  must  allow  exemptions  for  sincere  religious \nobjections.  86  Fed.  Reg.  61,402,  61,447  (Nov.  5,  2021)  (“sincerely-held  religious \n \n26 \n\n     \n \nYork “has available to it a variety of approaches that appear capable of serving its \ninterests,” it must explain why it cannot take the more common path. McCullen v. \nCoakley, 573 U.S. 464, 493-494 (2014) (considering policies of other states under \nintermediate scrutiny); Holt, 574 U.S. at 368-369 (same under strict scrutiny). \nNew York’s response to this argument is only that it considered and rejected \nalternatives to vaccination as “inadequate.” Appellants’ Reply Br. at 18, 20. But that \ndoes not explain the difference between New York and the 47 states and the federal \ngovernment  that  do  not  require  vaccination  for  the  small  percentage  of  their \nhealthcare workforce that requests religious exemptions.26 That alone means they \nflunk strict scrutiny. Holt, 574 U.S. at 368-369. \n2.  New York has shown that it can accommodate religious objectors. \nNew York also fails strict scrutiny because it has not explained why it cannot treat \nemployees with religious objections like those who receive medical exemptions from \nthe mandate. There is no reason that New York’s “interests could [not] be achieved \n \nbeliefs”  make  employees  “legally  entitled  to  a  reasonable  accommodation  under \nfederal  civil  rights  laws”).  Under  the  CMS  mandate,  health  care  providers  and \nsuppliers that receive Medicare and Medicaid are “required” to create a process for \nemployees to request exemptions under federal employment law, including Title VII. \n86  Fed.  Reg.  61,555,  61,572  (Nov.  5,  2021)  (“we  require  that  providers  and \nsuppliers  * * *  implement a process by which staff may request an exemption  * * *  \nbased on an applicable Federal law”). \n26  The fact that some other states may take a significantly more protective approach \ntoward religious objectors does not require New York to take the exact same approach. \nSee McCullen, 573 U.S. at 493-494 (The State need not “enact all or even any” of the \nless restrictive means identified). But when the vast majority of states and the federal \ngovernment have refrained from the punitive actions New York has taken, New York \nmust show why it is entitled to outlier status in its treatment of a constitutional right. \nNew York has not done so. \n27 \n\n     \n \nby narrower [laws] that burdened religion to a far lesser degree.” Church of the \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993). That is, the \nprecautions New York takes for medically exempt workers to ensure that they can \ncontinue working in the same facilities as religious objectors should apply just as well \nto religious objectors. Holt, 574 U.S. at 365 (“[I]f a less restrictive means is available \nfor the Government to achieve its goals, the Government must use it.”). The Second \nCircuit noted that “healthcare entities may permit a medically exempt employee to \ncontinue normal job responsibilities provided they comply with requirements for \npersonal protective equipment,” Appx.43 n.33, but it neglected to “requir[e] the State \nto explain why it could not safely permit” religious objectors to exercise the same \n“precautions used [for] secular” objectors. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. at 1297. Thus, New York \nhas failed to meet its “most demanding” burden of proof under strict scrutiny. City of \nBoerne, 521 U.S. at 534.  \nThe closest New York gets is that, as alleged in the affidavits it filed in a different \ncase in state court, during the brief time that religious accommodations were legal in \nNew York, the number of religious accommodation requests was higher than the \nnumber of medical exemptions. Appx.32. But even accepting those numbers, supra \nn.16, in the counties that the Second Circuit identified as having a higher proportion \nof religious accommodation requests, the overall vaccination rate for health care \nworkers was above 90%. Appx.15-16. And the fact that religious exemptions are \nsomewhat more common is not, by itself, a reason to deny them. To the contrary, the \nexistence of these accommodations confirms that many healthcare employers have \n28 \n\n     \n \nfound it entirely possible to safely accommodate religious employees in their facilities \nwithout undue hardship.  \n3.  New York’s categorical denial of unemployment benefits is not \nthe least restrictive means of serving any valid interest. \nNew York also fails strict scrutiny by irrationally denying religious objectors \nunemployment benefits. See supra at 8-9. Even if firing religious objectors from their \njobs was somehow the least restrictive way to meet its interests in curbing the spread \nof the virus and maintaining healthcare workers, depriving religious objectors of the \nability to feed their families contributes to neither of those interests if they are \nalready out of work. “[P]roperly narrowed,” then, “we must conclude that the interests \nadvanced by the state do not justify the burden placed on the free exercise of religion.” \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 719.  \nII.  New  York’s  categorical  ban  on  religious  accommodations  directly \nconflicts with Title VII. \nUnder Title VII, “[a]n employer may not take an adverse employment action \nagainst an applicant or employee because of any aspect of that individual’s religious \nobservance  or  practice  unless  the  employer  demonstrates  that  it  is  unable  to \nreasonably  accommodate  that  observance  or  practice  without  undue  hardship.” \nAbercrombie & Fitch, 575 U.S. at 775-776 (Alito, J., concurring). In order to meet \ntheir Title VII obligations, employers must engage in a good faith process involving \n“bilateral cooperation” with their employees who request religious accommodations. \nAnsonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 69 (1986). While an employer is not \nrequired to accept an employee’s preferred accommodation, it is per se unreasonable \nfor employers to deny a religious accommodation if they have already granted similar \n29 \n\n     \n \naccommodations to other employees for secular reasons. Id. at 71. That is because, \nonce an employer has authorized an accommodation, it “may not be doled out in a \ndiscriminatory fashion,” since “discrimination against religious practices  * * *  is the \nantithesis of reasonableness.” Ibid.    \nConsistent with this rule, when adopting its own “Health Care Staff Vaccination” \nregulation last week, the federal government recognized that health care employers \n“may also be required to provide appropriate accommodations” under Title VII “for \nemployees who request and receive exemption from vaccination because of a  * * *  \nsincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance.”27 And when issuing guidance \nfor employers implementing vaccine mandates, the EEOC emphasized that they must \n“thoroughly  consider  all  possible  reasonable  accommodations”—listing  examples \nsuch “wear[ing] a face mask, work[ing] at a social distance from coworkers or non-\nemployees,  work[ing]  a  modified  shift,  get[ting]  periodic  tests,”  teleworking,  or \nreassignment.28 \n \n27  86 Fed. Reg. at 61,568-61,569; see also 86 Fed. Reg. at 61,552 (allowing employers \nto exempt employees “[w]ho are legally entitled to a reasonable accommodation under \nfederal civil rights laws because they have a disability or sincerely held religious \nbeliefs, practices, or observances that conflict with the vaccination requirement”).  \nIt bears emphasizing that this case is not a collection of individual Title VII claims. \nThe district court rightly recognized that it did not have to determine the merits of a \nfuture Title VII suit, but that New York’s rule “has effectively foreclosed the pathway \nto seeking a religious accommodation that is guaranteed under Title VII.” Appx.76.  \n \n28 See K.2., K.12., and L.3. at EEOC, What You Should Know About COVID-19 and \nthe ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws (updated Oct. 28, 2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/E3WH-WH7Q. \n30 \n\n     \n \nBy contrast, Section 2.61 directly conflicts with Title VII. It requires vaccination \nfor all on-site employees, and only allows employers to grant one kind of exemption, \nfor medical reasons. Appx.109 at (c), (d). For unvaccinated employees with medical \nexemptions, “any reasonable accommodation may be granted.” Id. at (d)(1). But for \nunvaccinated employees with religious objections, the law allows no exemptions. \nIn both its public-facing communications and in its Second Circuit briefing, New \nYork took the position that the only “accommodation” consistent with Section 2.61 \nwas to put the religious health care provider in a position where she would have no \nphysical contact with patients or other employees and thus would not qualify as \n“personnel” under the Rule. Appx.41 (citing New York’s brief).29 The Second Circuit \nheld there was no conflict between Section 2.61 and Title VII, because “Section 2.61, \non its face, does not bar an employer from providing an employee with a reasonable \naccommodation that removes the individual from the scope of the Rule.” Appx.42.  \nBut  New  York’s  so-called  accommodation  falls  far  short  of  the  actual \naccommodations New York permits under the medical exemption, which include \nthings like continuation of normal duties while wearing PPE. Appx.109 at (d)(1). And \nthat,  by  itself,  violates  Title  VII,  because  once  an  employer  has  authorized  an \naccommodation for secular purposes, it “may not be doled out in a discriminatory \n \n29 See also New York Dep’t of Labor, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Regarding \nthe August 26, 2021 – Prevention of COVID-19 Transmission of Covered Entities \nEmergency Regulation, https://perma.cc/YZV2-YK8U (allowing “accommodation” but \nspecifying that “covered entities cannot permit unvaccinated individuals to continue \nin ‘personnel’ positions such that if they were infected with COVID-19, they could \npotentially expose other covered personnel, patients, or residents to the disease.”). \n31 \n\n     \n \nfashion” that excludes religious accommodation. Ansonia, 479 U.S. at 71. It is not \n“reasonable” to banish employees who are unvaccinated for religious reasons from the \nworksite while accommodating employees who are unvaccinated for medical reasons \nwith alternatives like PPE.30  \nSection 2.61’s promulgation immediately caused employers to violate Title VII.31 \nNurse A, Dr. F, Dr. S, and Dr. O had all previously received religious accommodations \nfrom their employers, only to see those accommodations rescinded once Section 2.61 \nmade them illegal.32 Appx.148 ¶ 49 (Nurse A); Appx.152 ¶ 77 (Dr. F); Appx.169 ¶ 174 \n(Dr. S); Appx.163 ¶ 142 (Dr. O); see Appx.148 ¶ 49 (hospital revoking Nurse A’s \nreligious accommodation because it “must follow NYS DOH requirements as they \n \n30  In many cases, exclusion from the worksite is no accommodation at all. Applicants \nwho are surgeons and OB/GYNs, for example, cannot repair an eye or deliver a baby \nremotely. See Appx.149-150 (ophthalmologist with surgical practice); Appx.152-153 \n(oral surgeon); Appx.156-158, 165-166 (OB/GYNs). \n31  Of course, the employers continue to be liable for violating Title VII. As even the \nSecond Circuit has recognized elsewhere, Title VII “explicitly relieves employers from \nany duty to observe a state hiring provision ‘which purports to require or permit’ any \ndiscriminatory employment practice.” Gulino v. New York State Educ. Dep’t, 460 F.3d \n361, 380 (2d Cir. 2006); see also 42 U.S.C. 2000e-7 (“Nothing in this subchapter shall \nbe deemed to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty, or \npunishment provided by any present or future law of any State or political subdivision \nof a State, other than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of \nany act which would be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter.”) \n(emphasis added). But as the Second Circuit observed in this case, the employers’ \ndefense that they were complying with state law could significantly limit employees’ \nability to recover damages. Appx.47.  \n32  The Second Circuit dismissed this evidence as mere “say-so” and held that it was \nclear error for the district court to rely on it. That was error. These statements \nappeared in Applicants’ verified complaint, and New York never contested them. \n“[S]ince they have not yet been denied or contradicted by countervailing affidavits or \nevidence,” the facts in the verified complaint “must be accepted as true.” O’Connor v. \nBd. of Educ. of Sch. Dist. 23, 449 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1980). \n32 \n\n     \n \nevolve.  This  means  that  [the  hospital]  can  no  longer  consider  any  religious \nexemptions to the COVID vaccination even those previously approved”); Appx.163-\n164 ¶¶ 142-143 (hospital revoking Dr. O’s religious accommodation because “under \nthe emergency regulations the NYS DOH will not permit exemptions or deferrals for \nsincerely held religious beliefs”).  \nConversely, once Section 2.61 was enjoined, health care employers moved quickly \nto accommodate their employees, granting religious exemptions to an estimated total \nof  15,844  health  care  workers  (2.4%  of  the  workforce),  including  15  of  the  17 \nApplicants.33  \nBut when the Second Circuit vacated the district court injunction, employers once \nagain revoked their religious accommodations due to Section 2.61. For example, one \nApplicant received this notice:  \n \n33  Rob Frehse, New York State Health Care Workers Will No Longer Have Religious \nExemption to COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, Court Rules, CNN (Oct. 29, 2021, 10:29 \nPM), https://perma.cc/UK6M-EHKR. Following the district court injunction in this \ncase, 15 out of 17 Applicants either received religious exemptions for the first time, \nhad their original exemptions restored, or were allowed to continue working under \nindefinite status. Appx.201-202. \n33 \n\n     \n \n \n This  leads  to  the  most  obvious  Title  VII  violation:  the  mandate  has  forced \nemployers  who  can  accommodate  their  employees’  religious  beliefs  and  want  to \naccommodate them to nonetheless exclude them from the worksite. See supra at 7-8 \n& n.29.  Instead, no matter how easy it might be to accommodate employees, and no \nmatter how dramatic the consequences from letting them go, the mandate requires \nexclusion. Title VII requires the exact opposite. \nIII.  Immediate injunctive relief is warranted to prevent irreparable harm \nand would serve the public interest. \nThe Second Circuit found New York’s law compatible with Title VII.  But on \nWednesday, New York doubled down in this Court, passing up the chance to moderate \nits  position  after  the  federal  government’s  new  rules  reiterated  Title  VII’s \nrequirement  of  reasonable  accommodation,  and  instead  admitting  its  desire  to \n“interefer[e]” with employers granting religious exemptions. Response Br. at 13, We \nthe Patriots. In light of New York’s unyielding position, Applicants have clearly \n34 \n\n     \n \nestablished that New York is violating both the First Amendment (under Smith, \nSherbert, or any other standard) and Title VII. Absent immediate relief, Applicants \nface irreparable harm not only to their First Amendment and civil rights, injuries \nalone sufficient to justify protection pending appeal, Diocese of Brooklyn, 141 S. Ct. \nat 67, but also to their ability to provide for their families—losing their jobs, losing \ntheir admitting privileges or residencies, losing the ability to obtain other jobs in their \nfields, being barred from receiving unemployment, and potentially being unable to \nobtain damages.  \nApplicants are already receiving notices of termination or unpaid leave. See supra \nat  34.  They  need  immediate  relief.  Providing  that  relief  and  allowing  essential \nworkers to be accommodated by their willing employers will help, rather than harm, \nthe public interest because compliance with the First Amendment and Title VII is in \nthe public interest, and because the public is not well served by firing healthcare \nworkers who are in short supply.  \nFor these reasons, “applicants have clearly established their entitlement to relief \npending appellate review.” Diocese of Brooklyn, 141 S. Ct. at 66 (granting injunction \npending appeal to application filed under 28 U.S.C. 1651(a)). \nIV.  Alternatively, Applicants respectfully request that the Court either stay \nenforcement  of  New  York’s  mandate  or  treat  this  application  as  a \npetition for certiorari and grant certiorari forthwith.  \nStay. In the alternative, Applicants respectfully request that the Court grant a \nstay of enforcement of the mandate to permit a “reasonable time” for Applicants to \npetition for certiorari. See 28 U.S.C. 2101(f); Sup. Ct. R. 23. A stay is appropriate \nupon a showing that there is a “fair prospect” that the lower court judgment will be \n35 \n\n     \n \nreversed,  a  likelihood  of  “irreparable  harm,”  and  that  there  is  “a  reasonable \nprobability that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant \ncertiorari.” Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (per curiam) (further \nnoting that, in close cases, courts will also “balance the equities and weigh the relative \nharms”).  \n  As shown above, there is more than a “fair prospect” that the lower court judgment \nwill  be  reversed,  given  its  conflict  with  so  many  of  this  Court’s  decisions,  that \nApplicants face obvious irreparable harms, and that the equities and relative harms \nfavor Applicants. Furthermore, in light of the recent three-Justice dissents in Mills, \n2021 WL 5027177, Roman Catholic Diocese v. Emami, No. 20-1501, 2021 WL 5043558 \n(Nov. 1, 2021), and Dignity Health v. Minton, No. 19-1135, 2021 WL 5043742 (Nov. \n1, 2021), there is at least a “reasonable probability” that a fourth justice will consider \nthe questions presented sufficiently worthy of certiorari. Hollingsworth, 558 U.S. at \n190.  \n  Certiorari.  While New York has been an outlier on multiple fronts, religiously \ndiscriminatory COVID-19 restrictions are an ongoing problem of nationwide scope. \nMore to the point, New York’s targeted denial of religious exemptions—coming less \nthan a year after its targeted shutdown of houses of worship—is itself an issue of \n“imperative public importance,” Sup. Ct. R. 11. Prompt merits consideration by this \nCourt will provide much-needed guidance to governments, employers, employees, and \nlower courts as to how to navigate this important group of cases before many people \nsuffer harms even the panel recognized would be irreparable.  \n36 \n\n     \n \n  Certiorari is further warranted given the conflicts between the Second Circuit’s \ndecision and decisions of other circuits and of this Court. The Second Circuit declined \nto apply heightened scrutiny even though the Rule treated religious objectors worse \nthan healthcare workers with a medical exemption. By contrast, the Sixth Circuit \nsubjected a Michigan college’s COVID-19 vaccination order to heightened scrutiny \nbecause it discriminated against student religious objectors and in favor of other \nstudents, including students with a medical exemption. Dahl, 15 F.4th 728. And the \nThird  Circuit  has  held  that  even  a  single  secular  exemption  to  an  otherwise-\napplicable prohibition can render a law not neutral and generally applicable as \napplied to religion, regardless of whether other secular conduct is likewise banned. \nFraternal Ord. of Police v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359, 365-366 (3d Cir. 1999); see \nCalvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak, 140 S. Ct. 2603, 2613 (Kavanaugh, J., \ndissenting) (“The point is not whether one or a few secular analogs are regulated. The \nquestion is whether a single secular analog is  not regulated.” (citation omitted) \n(emphasis in original)).  \n  Moreover, as explained above, the Second Circuit’s Free Exercise analysis runs \nafoul of this Court’s well-settled precedent under Smith, Sherbert, or any other \nstandard. This case—in which New York’s punitive treatment of religious objectors \nis a textbook violation of the Free Exercise Clause—is the proper vehicle to resolve \nthese conflicts and remind the Nation that, even in a pandemic, the Constitution and \nthe Courts continue to provide protection. \n37 \n\n     \n \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should issue an injunction prohibiting enforcement of New York’s \nmandate until disposition of a petition for certiorari. Alternatively, the Court should \nconvert the application to a petition for certiorari and grant certiorari now to address \nthese important issues on the merits docket.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Thomas Brejcha \nMARK RIENZI     Counsel of Record \nDANIEL BLOMBERG   STEPHEN M.

This  action  seeks  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  from  a  New  York  State\nDepartment of Health (DOH) regulation, promulgated on August 26, 2021, that purports to \nnullify Title VII and the parallel protections of the New York State Human Rights Law and the \nNew York City Human Rights Law by mandating the COVID-19 vaccination of health care \nprofessionals with no exemption for sincere religious beliefs that compel the refusal of such \nvaccination (the “Vaccine Mandate”). \n\n \n2.  This “emergency” regulation,  promulgated almost three months after the former \nGovernor of New York ended the COVID-related “state disaster emergency” and rescinded all \nhis pertinent executive orders, negates even the protection for sincere religious beliefs in a prior \nDOH regulation promulgated only days before, when the former Governor was still in office.  \n3.  Plaintiffs have moved this Court for temporary and preliminary injunctive relief in \nview of the September 27, 2021 deadline for compliance with the Vaccine Mandate, after which \nplaintiffs,  whose  religious  beliefs  compel  abstention  from  COVID-19  vaccination,  will  be \nharmed irreparably by loss of employment and professional standing. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This action also arises under federal \nstatutory laws, namely 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over the instant matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 \nand 1343.enue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because two of the \ndefendants reside in this District and a       substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District. \n6.  This  Court  is  authorized  to  grant  declaratory  judgment  under  the  Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02, implemented through Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \n7.  This Court is authorized to grant Plaintiffs’ prayer for temporary, preliminary, and \npermanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n8.  This  Court  is  authorized  to  grant  Plaintiffs’  prayer  for  relief  regarding  costs, \nincluding a reasonable attorney’s fee, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988. \n2 \n \n \n\n \nTHE PARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n9.   As more particularly alleged below, the plaintiffs herein are medical professionals \nwhose sincere religious beliefs compel them to refuse vaccination with the available COVID-19 \nvaccines,  all  of  which  employ  aborted  fetus  cell  lines  in  their  testing,  development,  or \nproduction.  \n10. All of the plaintiffs are employed by entities with 15 more employees covered by \nTitle VII, which mandates the reasonable accommodation of sincere religious beliefs. Eight of \nthe seventeen plaintiffs reside and work in this District, while the others reside and/or work \nvariously in the Southern, Eastern and Western Districts. \nDefendants \n11. Defendant Kathy Hochul (Hochul) is Governor of the State of New York who, as \nthe  State’s  chief  executive,  is  responsible  for  the  execution  of  its  laws  and  regulations, \nincluding the challenged vaccine mandate, and for the approval of all executive branch policies \nand directives, including those of the DOH pertaining to the vaccine mandate. At all pertinent \ntimes Hochul has acted and will act under color of state law. Defendant Hochul’s principal \nplace of business is located at the State Capitol Building, Albany, New York.  She is sued in her \nofficial capacity. \n12. Defendant Howard A. Zucker (Zucker) is Commissioner of Health for the DOH. He \nis responsible for promulgation and enforcement of the challenged vaccine mandate.  At all \npertinent times Zucker has acted and will act under color of state law. Defendant Zucker’s \nprincipal place of business is located at 3959 Broadway, New York, NY 10032. He is sued in \nhis official capacity.   \n3 \n \n \n\n \n13.  Defendant LETITIA JAMES (James) is the Attorney General for the State of New \nYork, the State’s highest-ranking law enforcement officer charged with overall supervision of \nthe enforcement of the challenged vaccine mandate and other laws of the State of New York.  At \nall times relevant to this Complaint, James is and was acting under color of State law. Defendant \nJames’ principal place of business is located at the State Capitol Building, Albany, New York.  \nShe is sued in her official capacity. \nBACKGROUND \n \n“No one should be forced to be vaccinated against their will both because of the \nconstitutional  right  to  refuse  treatment,  and  pragmatically  because  forced \nvaccination will deter at least some people from seeking medical help when they \nneed it.” \n \n“Following this flawed logic, several state-based proposals have sought to address \nany ‘public health emergency,’ … [by] resort[ing] to punitive, police-state tactics, \nsuch as forced examinations, vaccination and treatment, and criminal sanctions \nfor those individuals who did not follow the rules.” \n \n-The American Civil Liberties Union in 2008 \n (before it became the Anti-Civil Liberties Union) \n \nThe Cuomo Administration and the  \n“Public Health Emergency” Come to an End \n \n14. On August 23, 2021, the People of the State of New York were definitively rescued \nfrom  the  nearly  eighteen-month-long  medical  dictatorship  of  ex-Governor  Cuomo,  who \nresigned in disgrace and forfeited the Emmy Award for his press conference “performances” as \nthe savior of New York from the coronavirus.1   \n15. The legacy of Cuomo’s medical dictatorship was the second highest COVID death \nrate per 100,000 in the country—with New Jersey in first place under the equally draconian and \n                                                 \n1 See Nick Niedzwiaek, “Cuomo Loses Emmy following scandal, resignation,” POLITICO, \nAugust  24,  2021,  https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2021/08/24/cuomo-\nloses-emmy-following-scandal-resignation-1390423  \n4 \n \n \n\n \nstill-ongoing medical dictatorship of Governor Murphy.2 There is an ongoing FBI investigation \ninto official concealment of the 15,000 COVID deaths caused by Cuomo’s order to return \nCOVID-positive patients to nursing homes after their discharge from the hospital.3 \n16.   On  June  25,  2021,  two  months  before  his  last  day  in  office,  Cuomo  finally \nrescinded his declaration of a “State disaster emergency”—fifteen months after it was issued—\nalong with all the executive orders that followed. There is no longer a public health emergency \nin the State of New York.  Despite the incessant media fearmongering over the “Delta variant” \nand now the “Mu variant,” on September 7, 2021, only 47 deaths out of a state population of \nalmost 20,000,000 could be attributed (however loosely) to the virus.4 \nThe Vaccination Mandate  \nSupersedes the Prior Health Order \n \n17.   The  end  of  the  Cuomo  administration,  however,  has  apparently  not  been \naccompanied by any institutional awareness of the failure of his policies to improve the lot of \nNew Yorkers during the pandemic as compared to virtually every other State in the Union.  On \nthe contrary, the defendant Health Commissioner, Howard A. Zucker, and Cuomo’s successor \nas Governor, defendant Governor Kathy Hochul (Hochul), continue to behave as if the “disaster \nemergency” had never ended—and never will end. \n18.   Solely  on the pretext of what the DOH’s Public Health and Health Planning \nCouncil (“the Health Council”) deems “a concerning national trend of increasing circulation of \nthe  SARS-CoV-2  Delta  variant,”  Zucker  and  the  DOH,  with  the  assistance  of  defendant \n                                                 \n2  See  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/.  \nNew York was only recently bumped to third worst in the nation, but only barely, by Mississippi. \n3  See  Michael  Gold  and  Ed  Shanahan,  “What  We  Know  About  Cuomo’s  Nursing  Home \nScandal,”  August  4,  2021,  https://www.nytimes.com/article/andrew-cuomo-nursing-home-\ndeaths.html  \n4 See https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/new-york/  \n5 \n \n \n\n \nAttorney General Letitia James  and the approval of Hochul as the State’s chief executive, are \nnow enforcing the Health Council’s proposed COVID-19 “emergency” regulation, the aforesaid \nVaccine Mandate, effective only days ago, on August 26, 2021. \n19.   The Vaccine Mandate orders the COVID-19 vaccination of the “personnel” of all \n“covered entities” in the field of medical and health services, including the Plaintiffs and all the \nhospitals, clinics, or private practices with which they are associated.  See Exhibit A to this \nComplaint and NYCRR, Title 10, Part 2, § 2.61 (“the Vaccine Mandate”). \n20.   The  Vaccine  Mandate  excludes  any  religious  exemption  from  COVID-19 \nvaccination but permits medical exemptions.  Yet, only days before, the superseded Public \nHealth  Order  issued  in  the  waning  days  of  the  Cuomo  administration  (the  “prior  Health \nOrder”)—one of the few things he got right—provided a broad and indeed constitutionally \nrequired religious exemption:  \nReligious  exemption.  Covered  entities  shall  grant  a  religious  exemption  for \nCOVID-19 vaccination for covered personnel if they hold a genuine and sincere \nreligious belief contrary to the practice of immunization, subject to a reasonable \naccommodation  by  the  employer.  Covered  entities  shall  document  such \nexemptions and such reasonable accommodations in personnel records or other \nappropriate records in accordance with applicable privacy laws by September 27, \n2021, and continuously, as needed, thereafter. \n \nSee Exhibit B to this Complaint (emphasis added) \n \n21.   The  Vaccination  Mandate  declares  that  “Covered  entities  shall  continuously \nrequire personnel to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with the first dose for current \npersonnel received by September 27, 2021 for general hospitals and nursing homes, and by \nOctober 7, 2021 for other covered entities absent receipt of an exemption.”  Mandate at 2.61 (c) \n(emphasis added). \n22.    Ominously enough, by “continuously… fully vaccinated” the Vaccine Mandate \n6 \n \n \n\n \nappears to contemplate however many “booster shots” of COVID vaccine federal and state \nhealth  bureaucrats  demand:  “‘Fully  vaccinated,’  for  the  purposes  of  this section,  shall  be \ndetermined  by  the  Department  in  accordance  with  applicable  federal  guidelines  and \nrecommendations.” Id. at § 3.   \n23.   In the State of Israel, where COVID vaccines are already failing massively to \n“contain the virus,” the national government has announced that “fully vaccinated” now means \nthree shots.5  Or perhaps four shots very soon, as Israel’s top health expert suggests.6  In this \ncountry, the Biden administration is already promoting the three shots = “fully vaccinated” \nnarrative:  “It will make you safer, and for longer, and it will help us end the pandemic faster,” \nsaid Biden said in a speech on August 18.7 \n24.   As pleaded more particularly below, the Vaccine Mandate purports to override \nfederal protections under Title VII, commanding employers to deny religious accommodation \nof sincere religious objections to vaccination—a blatant violation of the Supremacy Clause as \nwell as the Free Exercise Clause.   The Vaccine Mandate even nullifies parallel state law \nprotections under the New York Human Rights Law and the New York City Human Rights \nLaw. \n25.    Only days after the prior Health Order had declared “Covered entities shall grant a \nreligious exemption” in recognition of federal and state law, the Vaccine Mandate effectively \ndeclared that “covered entitles” shall not grant a religious exemption.  The targeting of a large \n                                                 \n5 “Three doses not two: Israel sets new benchmark for full vaccination.

Yet  any  ill-informed  college  student  can  obtain  a  religious \nexemption from a panoply of vaccinations simply by filing a statement that “he/she objects to \nimmunization due to his/her religious beliefs.” See Public Health Law § 2165. \nReasons for Proceeding with Pseudonyms \n \n26.   The same “front  line” health care  workers hailed as heroes by the media for \ntreating COVID patients before vaccines were available, including the Plaintiffs herein, are now \nvilified by the same media as pariahs who must be excluded from society until they are \nvaccinated against their will.  \n27.   The  Vaccine  Mandate  emerges  in  the  context  of  an  atmosphere  of  fear  and \nirrationality  in  which  the  unvaccinated  are  threatened  with  being  reduced  to  a  caste  of \nuntouchables if they will not consent to being injected, even “continuously,” with vaccines that \nviolate their religious beliefs, are clearly not as effective as promised, and have known and \nincreasingly evident risks of severe and even life-threatening side effects, including blood clots9 \nand what the CDC admits is “a ‘likely association’ between a rare heart inflammatory condition \nin adolescents and young adults [under age 30] mostly after they’ve received their second \nCovid-19 vaccine shot…”10 \n                                                 \n8 See letter to defendants Zucker and Hochul from numerous members of the State Assembly @ \nhttps://www.scribd.com/document/523955400/COVID-Vaccination-Letter#from_embed  \n9 Cf. authoritative study in the prestigious journal Nature: “Antibody epitopes in vaccine-\ninduced  immune  thrombotic  thrombocytopaenia,”  July  7,  2021;  available  at \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03744-4 \n \n10See Berkeley Lovelace, Jr. “CDC safety group says there’s a likely link between rare heart \ninflammation  in  young  people  after  Covid  shot,”  CNBC,  June  23,  2021  @ \nhttps://tinyurl.com/sse5zsr9  \n8 \n \n \n\n \n28.    With caution thrown to the winds, everyone—the young and healthy, the old, the \npreviously recovered and naturally immune, even pregnant and breastfeeding women—is now \nbeing pressured by governments, businesses and educational institutions to submit to COVID-\n19  vaccination  with  no  assessment  of  the  risks  or  benefits  for  each  individual  or  any \nconsideration of medical necessity or contraindication in each particular case. Even the smallest \nchildren, at virtually no risk from the virus, are to be vaccinated as soon as a rushed approval \ncan be obtained from the FDA.   \n29.   For the sake of forcing people to be inoculated with novel vaccines regardless of \nrisk  or  benefit,  college  admissions  are  being  revoked,  career  paths  blocked,  employment \nterminated, and lives ruined on a vast scale.  Nothing like this has ever been seen in our nation.  \n30.  And  yet  the  CDC  now  admits  that  the  COVID  vaccines  do  not  prevent  viral \ntransmission or infection, especially by the “Delta variant.”11   \n31. As things now stand, according to “public health authorities” the vaccinated can \ninfect the unvaccinated, the unvaccinated can infect the vaccinated, both the vaccinated and the \nunvaccinated  can  infect  each  other,  and  everyone  must  wear  masks  indoors  in  “high \ntransmission”  areas—that  is,  virtually  the  entire  country12—as  if  no  one  at  all  had  been \nvaccinated.13  And with both the “fully vaccinated” and the unvaccinated still contracting \nCOVID, “continuous” “booster shots” of the same less-than-miraculous vaccines, to which \n \n                                                 \n11Frank Diamond, Infection Control Today, “Vaccines Not as Effective against the Delta Variant, \nsay CDC Data,” August 25, 2021 @ https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/vaccines-not-\nas-effective-against-delta-variant-says-cdc-data  \n12See  CDC  Map  at  https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/07/29/cdc-mask-\nguidelines-map-high-covid-transmission-county/5400268001/ \n13See  “When  You’ve  Been  Fully  Vaccinated,”  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-\nncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html  \n9 \n \n \n\n \n plaintiffs have the same religious objections, are doubtless on the way, accompanied by further \ngovernment  mandates. \n32.   In the midst of this regulatory muddle, combined with unreasoning official coercion \nand widespread, media-generated panic, plaintiffs seek leave of court to proceed anonymously as \nthey  run  the  risk  of  ostracization,  threats  of  harm,  immediate  firing  and  other  retaliatory \nconsequences if their names become known.  This is shown by the following examples of a \npervasive climate of fear and loathing of the unvaccinated:  \n  MSNBC guest Frank Schaeffer stating that those who are “anti-vaccine” are \n“bio terrorists” who should be the target of “Drone strikes.”14 \n \n  In the Eastern District of New York, where two of the Plaintiffs reside, an \nexplicit death threat was made in a comment that had to be deleted (likely for \nfear of liability on the part of the publishers) (Exhibit C)15 \n \n  Mayor de Blasio, announcing his “vaccine passport” for New York City, \nwhich affects several of the plaintiffs herein, declared that “If you want to \nparticipate in our society fully, you’ve got to get vaccinated.”16 \n \n  On ABC News, commentator Margaret Hoover declared that government, by \nwithholding all benefits from the unvaccinated, should “just make it almost \nimpossible  for  people  to—to  live  their  lives  without  being  protected  and \nprotecting the rest of us.”17 \n \n  On CNN, commentator Don Lemon stated to Chris Cuomo that “[If ou] don’t \nget the vaccine, you can’t go to the supermarket. Don’t have the vaccine, can’t \ngo to the ball game. Don’t have a vaccine, can’t go to work. You don’t have a \nvaccine, can’t come here. No shirt, no shoes, no service.”18  \n \n                                                 \n14 https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/09/10/msnbc-guest-calls-drone-strikes-americans-\nopposed-vaccine-mandates/ \n15 https://riverheadlocal.com/2021/09/04/protest-outside-riverhead-hospital-draws-crowd-of-\nvaccine-mandate-opponents/ \n16See video @ https://tinyurl.com/j4npw5c h \n17This  Week,”  July  25,  2021,  https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-25-21-speaker-\nnancy-pelosi-sen/story?id=79045738  \n18https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/08/01/don_lemon_no_shirt_no_shoes_no_ \nvaccine_no_service.html  \n10 \n \n \n\n \n  On his late night “comedy” show Jimmy Kimmel stated that the unvaccinated \nwho contract COVID should be allowed to die rather than being admitted to \nthe hospital: “Rest in peace, wheezy.”19 The audience roared its approval.  \nKimmel offered no such advice to the millions who seek emergency medical \ntreatment after disregarding constant public health warnings against smoking, \ndrinking, drug abuse, and junk food-induced Type II diabetes. \n \n  In The Week, Ryan Cooper declared that “Anti-vaxxers” (i.e. people who \ndecline the COVID vaccines) “should be exiled from society until they get \ntheir  shots,  and  their  efforts  to  intimidate  people  against  controlling  the \npandemic should be met with massive resistance.”20 \n \n33.   Furthermore,  plaintiffs’  allegations  below  involve  sensitive  personal  medical \ninformation concerning their vaccination status, the presence of antibodies, and whether they are \nbreastfeeding or intending to become pregnant. \n34. Under  these  circumstances,  plaintiffs  clearly  meet  the  criteria  for  permission  to \nproceed anonymously.  See Memorandum of Law in Support of this application. \nPlaintiffs’ Common Religious Beliefs Opposing \nCompulsory COVID-19 Vaccination \n \n35.   The following allegations detail plaintiffs’ sincere religious  conviction that they \ncannot consent to be inoculated, “continuously” or otherwise, with vaccines that were tested, \ndeveloped or produced with fetal cells line derived from procured abortions, and the drastic \nconsequences they now face absent emergency injunctive relief. \n36. The seventeen plaintiffs in this action—practicing doctors, M.D.s fulfilling their \nresidency  requirement,  nurses,  a  nuclear  medicine  technologist,  a  cognitive  rehabilitation \ntherapist and a physician’s liaison—are united in their conscientious religious objection as \nChristians to being inoculated at all, much less  “continuously,” with any of the available \n                                                 \n19  https://www.westernjournal.com/late-night-host-ghoulishly-mocks-sick-unvaccinated-rest-\npeace-wheezy/ \n20https://theweek.com/coronavirus/1002909/theres-1-obvious-solution-to-the-delta-variant-\nmandatory-vaccination  \n11 \n \n \n\n \nCOVID-19 vaccines because they all employ fetal cell lines derived from procured abortion in \ntesting, development or production of the vaccines.  In particular: \n  Johnson  &  Johnson/Janssen:  Fetal  cell  cultures  are  used  to  produce  and \nmanufacture the J&J COVID-19 vaccine and the final formulation of this \nvaccine includes residual amounts of the fetal host cell proteins (≤0.15 mcg) \nand/or host cell DNA (≤3 ng). \n \n  Pfizer/BioNTech:   The HEK-293 abortion-related  cell  line was  used  in \nresearch related to the development of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. \n \n  Moderna/NIAID: Aborted fetal cell lines were used in both the development \nand testing of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.  \n \n37.    Plaintiffs  hold  in  common  the  following  sincere  religious  beliefs  concerning \nabortion-connected vaccines: \na)  They oppose abortion under any circumstances, as they believe that abortion \nis the intrinsically evil killing of an innocent, and thus they also oppose the \nuse of abortion-derived fetal cell lines for medical purposes and abortion-\nderived fetal stem cell research. \nb)  It  would  be  a  violation  of  their  deeply  held  religious  beliefs  and  moral \nconsciences to take any of the available COVID-19 vaccines given their use of \nabortion-derived fetal cell lines in testing, development, or production. \nc)  By receiving one of the COVID vaccines currently available, all of which are \nabortion-connected, they believe they would be cooperating with the evil of \nabortion in a manner that violates their consciences and that they would sin \ngravely if they acted against their consciences by taking any of these vaccines. \nd)  They agree with the teaching of spiritual leaders, including certain Catholic \nbishops, who urge Christians to refuse said vaccines to avoid cooperation in \n12 \n \n \n\n \nabortion and to bear witness against it without compromise, and who defend \nthe right to a religious exemption from vaccination with such vaccines. \ne)  They do not accept the opinion—expressed by certain other Catholic bishops, \nthe Pope included—that there is a therapeutically proportional reason to resort \nto abortion-connected vaccines  which can justify  “remote” cooperation in \nabortion.  They  reject  as  a  matter  of  religious  conviction  any  medical \ncooperation in abortion, no matter how “remote.”21 \nf)  They believe in the primacy of conscience in this matter. While one may \npersonally  conclude  that  recourse  to  abortion-connected  vaccines  can  be \njustified in his or her case, vaccination is not morally obligatory and must be \nvoluntary, and those who in conscience refuse vaccination need only take \nother protective measures to avoid spreading the virus.22   \ng)  Although they are not “anti-vaxxers” who oppose all vaccines, they believe as \na matter of religious conviction that the ensouled human person, made in the \nimage and likeness of God, is inviolable as a temple of the Holy Ghost and \nthat  civil  authorities  have  no  right  to  force  anyone  to  be  medicated  or \nvaccinated against his or her will, whether or not the medication or vaccine is \nabortion-connected. \n                                                 \n21See, Exhibit D (collecting statements of Catholic prelates, who call for conscientious abstention \nfrom abortion-connected vaccines). \n22See,  “Note  on  the  Morality  of  Using  Some  Anti-COVID-19  Vaccines,” \nhttps://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_202012\n21_nota-vaccini-anticovid_en.html  \n13 \n \n \n\n \nh)  A  risk-benefit  analysis  factors  into  each  person’s  formulation  of  a \nconscientious religious position on the morality of vaccinations.23 Plaintiffs \nare all aware of the vaccines’ side effects, which can be quite serious, their \nfading efficacy, requiring “booster shots,” their evident inability to prevent \ntransmission or infection, (see Exhibit F)24 and the fact that natural immunity \nis  likely  more  protective  than  injections  with  the  available  COVID-19 \nvaccines.25 These medical facts inform Plaintiffs’ religious conviction against \ninvoluntary  or  coerced  vaccination  as  an  invasion  of  bodily  autonomy \ncontrary to their religious beliefs. Given that the Vaccine Mandate requires \nthat employers insure that employees are “continuously” “fully vaccinated”—\nas many times as the government advises—Plaintiffs now reasonably fear that \n“booster shots” of the same vaccines they consider immoral will soon be \ndemanded by the government as a condition of employment and even normal \nlife in society, as is already the case with the original vaccines. \nPlaintiff “Dr. A.” \n38. Plaintiff A., M.D. (“Dr. A.”), who is Catholic, is a board-certified Anatomic and \nClinical Pathologist on staff at a private hospital in the Northern District, where he performs \npathology testing and diagnosis under contract with the hospital.    \n                                                 \n23See, “A Letter from the Colorado Bishops on COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates,” August 5, 2021 \n@ https://cocatholicconference.org/a-letter-from-the-bishops-on-covid-19-vaccine-mandates/  \n24 On August 5, 2021, during a CNN interview, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky stated that \nbecause of the new spread of the delta variant, “what [the COVID vaccines] can’t do anymore is \nprevent transmission,” (emphasis added), \nhttp://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html; see also Exhibit F (reproducing \ntranscript of this interview). \n25See, Exhibit E (on the science pertaining to natural versus vaccine-induced immunity).  \n \n14 \n \n \n\n \n39. On  August  12,  2021,  Dr.  A.,  who  seeks  a  religious  exemption  from  COVID \nvaccination based on the religious beliefs enumerated in ¶ 37 (a)-(h), was informed by the \nhospital administration via email that the hospital would be mandating the Covid-19 vaccination \nfor all employees and medical staff members who provide on-site care.  Unvaccinated staff \nmembers could refuse the vaccine without penalty but would be required to undergo weekly \ntesting.   \n40. This policy changed on or about August 20, 2021, due to the DOH’s issuance of the \nprior Health Order, which eliminated testing in lieu of vaccination but did allow both medical \nand religious exemptions.   \n41.  On August 27, 2021, however, the hospital policy changed again after DOH issued \nthe  Vaccinate Mandate  removing  the  religious  exemption  provision  under  the  prior  Health \nOrder.   \n42.  Knowing that religious exemptions had been banned by the DOH, on August 31, \n2021, Dr. A. sent the hospital administration the required form for a medical exemption instead, \nbut has not yet received a reply. \n43. Refusal to receive an abortion-connected COVID-19 vaccine will imminently result \nin the loss of Dr. A’s position at the hospital and this termination of employment would have to \nbe  mentioned  in  Dr.  A.’s  license  renewal  statements,  which  could  trigger  disciplinary \nproceedings against him.   \n44. Dr. A. is now also at risk of disciplinary charges by the DOH or otherwise that \ncould result in loss of his license if he refuses, as he must, vaccination with any of the currently \navailable abortion-connected vaccines. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID-\n15 \n \n \n\n \n19 vaccination a condition of renewal or threaten license suspension or revocation in order \nfurther to coerce Dr. A. to be vaccinated with a vaccine he cannot take in good conscience. \n45. The imminent loss of his position and staff privileges at the hospital with which Dr. \nA.  is  affiliated  will  make  it  impossible  to  conduct  his  practice  and  will  also  render  him \nunemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would place him on the \npathology staff under the Vaccine Mandate. \n46. Dr. A. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Nurse A.” \n47. Plaintiff A., R.N. (“Nurse A.”), who is Catholic, is a registered nurse, licensed in \nthe State of New York, who works in a major medical center in the Southern District. \n48. Nurse  A.  has  cared  for  numerous  dialysis  patients  with  COVID  during  the \npandemic without need of vaccination. \n49.  On  August  20,  2021,  Nurse  A.  received  a  religious  exemption  from  COVID \nvaccination from her hospital, based on the religious beliefs enumerated in ¶ 37 (a)-(h),On \nAugust 30, 2021, however, Nurse A. received an email revoking her religious exemption because \nof  the  Vaccine  Mandate,  which  email  stated  that  her  hospital  “must  follow  NYS  DOH \nrequirements as they evolve.  This means that [the hospital] can no longer consider any religious \nexemptions to the COVID vaccination even those previously approved.” \n50.  Said email further warned that “employees who do not comply with the vaccination \nprogram by the deadlines above will be placed off duty for seven days without pay, and given \n16 \n \n \n\n \nthose  seven  days  to  meet  the  program  requirements.  Employees  who  choose  not  to \nmeet the program requirements after seven days will be deemed to have opted to resign.” \n51.  Nurse A. has been given a deadline of September 15, 2021 to receive the “first \ndose” of COVID vaccine. \n52. Termination of Nurse A.’s employment will be devastating to her and her family. \nNurse A. will also be unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital \nwould hire her under the Vaccine Mandate. \n53. Nurse A.’s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and \nmay well trigger disciplinary proceedings against her.  There is also the threat that the DOH will \nmake COVID-19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal to further coerce compliance. \n54.  Nurse A. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation as measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in her \ninformed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. \n55. Nurse A. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Dr. C.” \n56.  Plaintiff C, M.D. (“Dr. C.”), who is Catholic, is a board-certified ophthalmologist \nwho is an attending physician with admitting privileges at a private hospital in the Northern \nDistrict, and he also directs a large private surgical practice. \n57.  During  2020,  Dr.  C.’s  large  practice  group  performed  almost  10,000  surgeries \nwithout a single case or outbreak of COVID-19 traceable to his practice and without vaccination \nof anyone on staff. \n17 \n \n \n\n \n58.  Prior to the Vaccine Mandate, religious exemption and periodic testing in lieu of \nvaccination were allowed under the prior Health Order that the Vaccine Mandate superseded, as \nto which exemption Plaintiff Dr. C. was in discussions with hospital management. \n59.   Plaintiff Dr. C. has now been advised by said hospital that on account of the Vaccine \nMandate he must be COVID-vaccinated by September 27, 2021, and that there is no religious \nexemption.   \n60.   Dr. C.’s written request for an exemption, reflecting the religious beliefs enumerated \nin ¶ 37 (a)-(h), was thus denied on September 1, the same day it was submitted. \n61.  The imminent loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. C is \naffiliated will make it impossible to conduct his practice, as he cannot conduct ophthalmic and \nmaxillofacial surgery without the ability to admit patients to a hospital if the need arises. \n62.  The imminent loss of privileges will also render Dr. C. unemployable anywhere in \nthe State of New York as no other hospital would grant him privileges under the Vaccine \nMandate. \n63.  The imminent loss of privileges will have to be reported at the time of license \nrenewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. C. There is also the threat that \nthe DOH will make COVID-19 vaccination a condition of license renewal in a further bid to \ncoerce compliance. \n64.  Dr.  C.  is  now  also  under  the  threat  of  disciplinary  proceedings  by  the  DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation, for refusing to obey the Vaccine Mandate by taking a \nvaccine that in his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. \n18 \n \n \n\n \n65.   Dr. C. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Nurse D.” \n66.  Plaintiff D., R.N.  (“Nurse D.”), who is Catholic, is a registered nurse, licensed in \nthe State of New York, who works at a private hospital in the Northern District.  She has two \nsons and a husband, and her job is a vital source income and health and dental insurance for her \nfamily.  \n67.  Nurse D. attempted to obtain a religious exemption from her hospital, based on the \nreligious  beliefs enumerated  in  ¶  37  (a)-(h),  but  it  was  denied  on  account  of  the  Vaccine \nMandate. She has been advised by management that if she is not vaccinated by September 27, \nshe will be deemed to have “voluntarily resigned.” \n68.  In  a  memo  issued  September  7,  2021,  management  further  advised  that  the \nemployment  of  Nurse  D.  and  any  other  employee  refusing  vaccination  under  the  Vaccine \nMandate will end on September 28, the separation will be “deemed” to be voluntary, meaning no \nunemployment benefits, and all health and other benefits will terminate. \n69.  Termination of Nurse D’s employment will be devastating to her and her family. \nNurse D. has more than $50,000 of student loans from her nursing program alone.   \n70.  Nurse D. will also be unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other \nhospital would hire her under the Vaccine Mandate. \n71.  Nurse D.’s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and \nmay well trigger disciplinary proceedings against her.  There is also the threat that the DOH will \nmake COVID-19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal to further coerce compliance. \n19 \n \n \n\n \n72.  Nurse D. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation as measure of coercion to take a vaccine that in her \ninformed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. \n73. Nurse D. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Dr. F.” \n74.  Plaintiff F., D.D.S., M.D. (“Doctor F.”), who is Catholic, is a board-certified Oral \nand Maxillofacial Surgeon, licensed in dentistry and medicine in the State of New York.   \n75.  Dr. F. is employed by a private hospital in the Northern District, where he is on \nstaff and has admitting privileges in addition to his private practice.  \n76.  Dr. F. and his partners have treated numerous patients who were sick with COVID \nwithout need of vaccination. Patients with COVID were not turned away but received dental \ntreatment that was urgently needed.  Dr. F.’s clinic is vital to the region in which it is located and \ncannot turn away patients in need of urgent care. \n77.  Although he was granted a religious exemption from COVID vaccination under the \nprior Health Order, the Vaccine Mandate has forced his hospital employer to revoke it and he \nwas  notified  by  hospital  administration  that  if  he  fails  to  provide  proof  of  vaccination  by \nSeptember 21, 2021, his hospital privileges will be suspended. \n78.  In addition to the concerns about the scientific questions pertaining to the available \nCOVID-19 vaccines noted in ¶ 37(h), Dr. F. also knows of two people who have died, one who \nhad a heart attack, and many others who have been injured following injection with a COVID \n20 \n \n \n\n \nvaccine.  These medical facts inform Dr. F’s religious objection to involuntary vaccination of \nany kind, including COVID vaccines, although he is not “anti-vax” in general. \n79.  The imminent loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. F is \naffiliated  will  make  it  impossible  to  conduct  his  practice,  as  he  cannot  conduct  oral  and \nmaxillofacial surgery without the ability to admit patients to a hospital if the need arises. \n80.  The imminent loss of privileges will also render Dr. F. unemployable anywhere in \nthe State of New York as no other hospital would grant him privileges under the Vaccine \nMandate, which he cannot in conscience obey. \n81.  The imminent loss of privileges will have to be reported at the time of license \nrenewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. F.  There is also the threat that \nthe DOH will make COVID-19 vaccination a condition of license renewal in a further bid to \ncoerce compliance with the Vaccine Mandate. \n82.  Dr.  F.  is  now  also  under  the  threat  of  disciplinary  proceedings  by  the  DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation—yet another measure of coercion to take a vaccine \nthat in his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. \n83.   Dr. F. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff Dr. “G.” \n84.   Plaintiff G., M.D. (“Dr. G.”), who is Catholic, is a board-certified specialist in \nInternal Medicine, licensed in the State of New York, who is employed by two private hospitals \noperated  by  a  health  service  in  the  Western  District  at  which  he  has  staff  and  admitting \n21 \n \n \n\n \nprivileges. Dr. G also directs an internal medicine residency program in which he instructs \ndozens of M.D.s who are fulfilling their residency requirements. \n85.   Dr. G., who seeks a religious exemption from COVID vaccination based on the \nbeliefs enumerated in ¶ 37 (a)-(h), has been informed by the Medical Affairs Department that \nthere is no religious exemption from the Vaccine Mandate and that if he is not “fully vaccinated” \nby September 27 he will not be allowed to enter any of the buildings of the health service, \nincluding the hospitals in which he works and teaches. \n86.  The imminent loss of Dr. G.’s positions and admitting privileges at the hospitals \nwith which he is affiliated will make it impossible for him to conduct his practice. \n87.  The  imminent  loss  of  his  positions  and  privileges  will  also  render  Dr.  G. \nunemployable  anywhere  in  the  State  of  New  York  as  no  other  hospital  would  grant  him \nprivileges under the Vaccine Mandate, which he cannot in conscience obey. \n88.  The imminent loss of privileges and the termination of his employments will have \nto be reported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings \nagainst Dr. G.  There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID-19 vaccination a \ncondition of his license renewal. \n89.  Dr.  G.  is  now  also  under  the  threat  of  disciplinary  proceedings  by  the  DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that \nin his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. \n90. Dr.  G.  will  suffer  imminent  irreparable  harm  to  his  occupation,  reputation,  and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \n \n22 \n \n \n\n \nPlaintiff “Therapist I.” \n91.  Plaintiff I. (“Therapist I.”), who is Catholic, is a certified brain injury specialist who \nprovides  cognitive  rehabilitation  and  other  assistance  to  patients,  groups  of  patients,  their \nfamilies and visitors at a facility located in the Northern District. \n92.  In October of 2020, Therapist I. treated COVID patients as a TNA (temporary \nnurses' aide) on a dedicated COVID Unit in a nursing home. Therapist I. was part of a team that \nthe parent facility set up to travel among its properties when the destination facility was in a \nstaffing crisis. Therapist I. did not require any form of vaccination to treat these patients but \nrather was tested twice a week. \n93.  Therapist  I.  knows  of  two  colleagues  who  were  “fully  vaccinated”  yet  still \ncontracted COVID-19 and had to be quarantined.  These medical facts, along with those recited \nherein above, inform Therapist I’s religious objection to involuntary vaccination as a violation of \nhuman dignity. \n94.  Therapist I., who seeks a religious exemption from COVID vaccination based on \nthe beliefs noted in ¶ 37 (a)-(h), has been advised by his employer, a rehabilitation center, that, \nbecause of the Vaccine Mandate, he must  receive “at least  the first dose” of an abortion-\nconnected vaccine by September 27, 2021. \n95.  Therapist I. is now facing imminent termination of his employment and damage to \nhis  reputation  and  future  employment  prospects  if  he  refuses  to  be  vaccinated  against  his \nreligious belief. \n96.  Therapist I. is also at risk of action against his certification in EMS as the DOH \nimposing the Vaccine Mandate also regulates the granting, oversight and renewal of his EMT-B \ncertificate.  \n23 \n \n \n\n \n97.  Therapist I will thus suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, \nand professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Doctor J.” \n98.  Plaintiff J., D.O., who is Catholic, is a Doctor of Osteopathy (“Dr. J.”), licensed in \nthe State of New York, whose specialty is Obstetrics and Gynecology, for which she is board-\ncertified.  She has admitting privileges at a private hospital in the Western District in addition to \nher private practice. \n99.   Dr. J. believes she has probably treated dozens of women with COVID, most of \nwhom were asymptomatic, and may have had an asymptomatic case of COVID herself.  She \nworks in Labor and Delivery two days per week, training residents, and cares for “unassigned \npatients” who don’t have a doctor. All patients are tested for COVID. Sometimes if the delivery \nwas happening quickly, Dr. J. would have to run into the room without knowing the patient’s \nCOVID status, and there was not always time to wear proper personal protection equipment \n(PPE). She would find out after the fact that the patient was COVID-positive.  Dr. J. has had 5 to \n8 patients who were admitted specifically due to complications of COVID in pregnancy. She \nassisted in their treatment even while she herself was pregnant.  \n100. As an OBGYN, Dr. J. has always practiced in accord with the dictates of her \npersonal religious convictions, including the beliefs enumerated above, and she does not perform \nany form of abortion or sterilization procedure, nor prescribe any contraceptive that could induce \nan unintentional abortion.  \n101.  Dr. J. is currently breastfeeding her daughter, is aware of reports of the death of \nbreastfeeding infants following maternal vaccination, and is not aware of any studies to date that \n24 \n \n \n\n \nwould prove safety in breastfeeding or during pregnancy, which is of particular concern to her as \nan  OB-GYN.  Her  hospital’s  own  notice  of  the  Vaccination  Mandate  advises  breastfeeding \nwomen  hesitantly  as  follows:  “Evidence  about  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  COVID-19 \nvaccination during pregnancy is growing… It’s best to talk to your OB-GYN or pediatrician \nabout any questions or concerns you have.”   \nThese medical facts, along with those recited herein above, inform Dr. J.’s religious conviction \nagainst involuntary vaccination as an invasion of bodily autonomy that is contrary to Catholic \nChurch teaching, especially in the case of COVID vaccination while she is breast-feeding or \npregnant, when the welfare of her child is also implicated. \n102.   Dr. J., who seeks a religious exemption from COVID vaccination that reflects the \nbeliefs set forth in ¶ 37 (a)-(h), has been advised by hospital management that unless she has the \n“first shot” of COVID vaccine by September 27, she can no longer have admitting privileges at \nthe hospital. \n103. Refusal to receive an abortion-connected COVID-19 vaccine will imminently result \nin the loss of Dr. J.’s admitting privileges, which will make it impossible to conduct her practice.  \n104. The loss of privileges due to refusal to comply with the Vaccine Mandate would \nhave  to  be  mentioned  in  her  license  renewal  statements,  which  could  trigger  disciplinary \nproceedings against Dr. J.   \n105. There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID-19 vaccination a condition \nof renewal or threaten license suspension or revocation in order further to coerce Dr. J. to be \nvaccinated with a vaccine she does not need in her informed medical judgment, does not want, \nand cannot take in good conscience. \n25 \n \n \n\n \n106. The loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. J. is affiliated will \nalso render her unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would \ngrant her admitting privileges under the Vaccine Mandate. \n107. Dr. J. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to  her occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Nurse J.” \n108. Plaintiff  J.,  L.P.N.  (“Nurse  J.”),  who  is  Baptist,  is  a  licensed  practical  nurse, \nlicensed in the State of New York, who provides home nursing care for two private home care \nagencies doing business in the Eastern District. \n109. Nurse J. has cared for COVID patients on an in-home basis, including a patient who \nhad to be hospitalized for several months, on which occasion Nurse J had to be quarantined for \ntwo weeks.  Nurse J. developed COVID-like symptoms and believes she has had the virus and \nthus has acquired natural immunity. \n110. While not a Catholic, Nurse J. shares the common beliefs of the plaintiffs, as \nenumerated above. \n111. On September 6, 2021, Nurse J. sent a letter of protest concerning the Vaccine \nMandate to the administration of the agencies for which she works, urging them not to capitulate \nto the State. But on September 7, 2021, Nurse J. was advised by management that there would be \nno religious exemptions from vaccination, “much to our disappointment.”   \n112. Nurse J. has requested a religious exemption but does not expect to receive one, \ngiven the Vaccine Mandate.  On September 9, 2021, Nurse J. was advised by the executive \n26 \n \n \n\n \ndirector of one of the agencies that employ her that no religious exemption is possible due to the \nVaccine Mandate and that “my hands are tied.” \n113. Nurse J. is now facing imminent termination of her employment as of October 7, \n2021, the compliance date for entities other than hospitals and nursing homes under the Vaccine \nMandate.  She will also be unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital \nwould hire her under the Vaccine Mandate. \n114. Nurse J.’s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and \nmay well trigger disciplinary proceedings against her.   There is also the threat that the DOH will \nmake COVID-19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal. \n115. Nurse J. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that \nin her informed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. \n116. Nurse J. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Dr. M.” \n117. Plaintiff M., M.D. (“Dr. M”), who is Catholic, is a medical school graduate in the \nprocess of completing her residency at a private hospital in the Western District. \n118. On August 19, 2021, during the short time the prior Health Order was in effect, Dr. \nM. received an email from Human Resources advising that all residents must be vaccinated for \nCOVID-19 and that “Information regarding waivers for medical or religious reasons will be \navailable shortly.”  \n27 \n \n \n\n \n119. On  August  25,  2021,  however,  Dr.  M.  received  an  email  from  administration \nwarning that “disregarding the NYS Vaccination Mandate may affect your ability to continue \nworking and training with your residency or fellowship program.”  There was no indication of an \nallowance for religious exemptions. \n120. On August 30, 2021, Dr. M. received another email from HR advising that “Late \nlast week, the NYS Public Health & Planning Council and the NYS Commissioner of Health \nremoved the religious exemption for the recent state mandate requiring all health professionals \nget vaccinated for COVID-19.”  Dr. M. was thus barred from obtaining the religious exemption \nfrom COVID vaccination that she seeks, based on the religious beliefs enumerated above. \n121. In  addition  to  the  medical  concerns  recited in  ¶37  (h),  Dr.  M.  has  personally \nwitnessed a medical student having a seizure after receiving the one-shot Johnson & Johnson \nvaccine. She collapsed to the floor and a rapid response team was summoned because she was \nunresponsive.  She recovered with the assistance of the team. These medical facts inform Dr. \nM.’s religious conviction against involuntary vaccination. \n122. On September 3, 2021, the hospital administration further advised Dr. M. by email \nthat  she  must  receive  the  “first  dose”  of  a  COVID  vaccine  by  September  27  and  that \n“Disregarding the NYS Vaccination Mandate may affect your ability to continue working and \ntraining with your residency or fellowship program.” \n123. Dr. M. has met with her program director to discuss her religious objection to \nCOVID vaccination, but was met only with reiteration of the warning that her residency was at \nrisk if she did not accept vaccination. \n28 \n \n \n\n \n124. Dr. M. now faces the imminent loss of her residency and thus the destruction of her \nentire career as she can never become a fully licensed physician and practice independently \nwithout completing a residency.  \n125. Given the Vaccine Mandate, Dr. M. will be unable to find a residency anywhere in \nthe State of New York due to her conscientious religious abstention from vaccination. \n126. Further, termination of her residency for refusal to obey the Vaccine Mandate in \nviolation of her religious belief is likely to have adverse consequences for Dr. M.’s licensure in \nNew York or any other jurisdiction. \n127. Dr. M. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Nurse N.” \n128. Plaintiff N., B.S.N, R.N.-C.(“Nurse N.), who is Catholic, is a Bachelor’s-prepared, \nmedical-surgical certified Registered Nurse, licensed in the State of New York, who works at a \nhospital in the Northern District.   \n129. On August 19, 2021, Nurse N., under the prior regime that included the Health \nOrder, received an exemption from COVID vaccination on the basis of anticipated pregnancy \nand current breastfeeding, and thus did not submit an additional request to her employer for \nreligious exemption, which she would have done, based on the beliefs enumerated above,  had \nher  request  for  exemption  related  to  pregnancy  and  breastfeeding  been  denied. Nurse N.’s \nrequest for exemption was approved as a “vaccination deferral.”   \n130. On September 1, 2021, however, Nurse N. was notified by hospital administration \nthat the Vaccine Mandate had eliminated all exemptions for religion and pregnancy, that her \n29 \n \n \n\n \nexemption was thus revoked, and that she must receive at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine \nby September 21. \n131.   Nurse N. does not accept the view that recourse to abortion-connected vaccines \ncan be justified as “remote” cooperation in abortion.  She rejects any medical cooperation in \nabortion, “remote” or otherwise. \n132.   Nurse N. also believes and follows the religious teaching of the Congregation for \nthe Doctrine of the Faith that vaccination is not morally obligatory.  Nurse N. does not oppose \nvaccination generally, and is not an “anti-vaxxer,” but does oppose government imposition of \nany medication or vaccine without informed consent, which she views with sincere religious \nconviction as a violation of the dignity of the human person. \n133. Further, Nurse N. has had COVID-19, from which she recovered.  As a medical \nprofessional who has read the pertinent medical literature, Nurse N. knows that she has natural \nimmunity that is superior to the vaccine-induced immunity that is already fading, that she is in no \nneed of vaccination by any form of COVID vaccine, and that all available COVID vaccines have \nknown and quite serious side effects, including death.   \n134. Nurse N. also knows that in her county “fully vaccinated” patients now comprise \nthe majority of COVID cases according to testing results (25 out of 41 cases), which is why \n“health experts” are now calling for “booster shots,” which she fears will be demanded of her \nunder  the  Vaccine  Mandate,  which  requires  that  employees  “continuously”  be  “fully \nvaccinated,” however many times the government demands. These medical facts inform Nurse \nN.’s religious conviction against involuntary vaccination as an invasion of bodily autonomy that \nis contrary to Church teaching. \n30 \n \n \n\n \n135. Plaintiff is now facing imminent loss of her employment, which is essential to the \nsupport of her family, on account of her religious abstention from COVID-19 vaccination. \n136. Nurse N. will also be unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other \nhospital would hire her due to her conscientious refusal to obey the Vaccine Mandate. \n137. Nurse N.’s termination will have to be reported at the time of license renewal and \nmay well trigger disciplinary proceedings against her.   There is also the threat that the DOH will \nmake COVID-19 vaccination a condition of her license renewal. \n138. Nurse N. is now also under the threat of disciplinary proceedings by the DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that \nin her informed medical judgment she cannot take in good conscience. \n139. Nurse N. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Dr. O.” \n140.   Plaintiff  O.,  M.D.  (“Dr.  O.”),  who  is  Catholic,  is  a  board-certified  General \nSurgeon, licensed in the State of New York.  He is employed by a private hospital in the \nNorthern District. \n141.  Dr. O. has treated and seen multiple patients for surgical problems (appendicitis, \ncholecystitis, soft tissue infections and other problems) who have had COVID.   \n142.   On July 13, 2021, Dr. O. was granted a religious exemption from his hospital \nunder the prior Health Order, which allowed for religious exemptions, but this has been revoked \non account of the new Vaccine Mandate announced on August 26, removing the provision for \nreligious exemptions.   \n31 \n \n \n\n \n143.   Dr. O.  has  thus  been  advised  by  his employer  that,  because  of the Vaccine \nMandate, he must be “fully vaccinated” with an abortion-connected vaccine by September 21, \nand that “under the emergency regulations the NYS DOH will not permit exemptions or deferrals \nfor sincerely held religious beliefs…” As the employer further advised: “any colleague who was \npreviously approved for one of the above exemptions/deferrals [including religious exemption] \nwill be required to provide proof of [vaccination]…” \n144.  Dr. O. now faces imminent loss of his privileges at the hospital where he performs \nsurgery. Without admitting privileges, he would not be able to operate a private surgical practice \nas he would not have the capacity to admit patients to a hospital if need be.  \n145. The imminent loss of his staff position and hospital privileges will also render Dr. \nO. unemployable anywhere in the State of New York as no other hospital would hire him under \nthe Vaccine Mandate, given his religiously motivated refusal to follow it. \n146. The imminent loss of Dr. O’s staff position and hospital privileges will have to be \nreported at the time of license renewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against \nhim.   There is also the threat that the DOH will make COVID-19 vaccination a condition of his \nlicense renewal. \n147. Dr.  O.  is  now  also  under  the  threat  of  disciplinary  proceedings  by  the  DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion “continuously” to be \ninoculated  with  a  vaccine  that  in  his  informed  medical  judgment  he  cannot  take  in  good \nconscience. \n148. Dr. O. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \n32 \n \n \n\n \nPlaintiff “Dr. P.” \n149. Plaintiff  P.,  D.O.  (“Dr.  P.”),  who  is  Catholic,  is  a  third-year  obstetrics  and \ngynecology resident at private hospital in the Western District.  \n150. Midway through her first year of training, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, and \nDr. P. cared for many patients infected with the virus, often with limited or no  PPE.  No \nvaccination was needed or required for her to treat patients safely. \n151. In March 2020, Dr. P. was assigned to an ICU rotation, standard for a first-year \nresident, during which she helped care for the sickest patients in the hospital, many suffering \nfrom COVID. It was during this time that Dr. P. herself became sick with the virus, from which \nshe recovered before returning to work.  \n152. As a Catholic, Dr. P. intends to practice medicine in line with the moral teachings \nof the Church, including the beliefs enumerated in ¶ 37 (a)-(h), which is why she chose her \ncurrent residency program, in reliance on which she and her husband moved from Texas to \nBuffalo.  \n153. As a medical doctor who has recovered from COVID, Dr. P. knows that she has \nnatural immunity, shown by numerous studies to be superior to the vaccine-induced immunity \nthat is already fading; that the COVID vaccines now available do not limit viral transmission, as \nshown by the rising demand for “booster shots” (including a fourth shot in Israel); and that \nvaccinating a naturally immune person can do more harm than good by provoking a hyper-\nimmune response.   \n154. On August 19, 2021, during the short time the prior Health Order was in effect, Dr. \nP. received an email from Human Resources advising that all residents must be vaccinated for \nCOVID-19 and that “Information regarding waivers for medical or religious reasons will be \n33 \n \n \n\n \navailable shortly.” This email also states that “disregarding the NYS Vaccination Mandate may \naffect your ability to continue working and training with your residency or fellowship program.”  \n155. On August 30, 2021, Dr. P. received another email from HR advising that “Late last \nweek,  the  NYS  Public  Health  &  Planning  Council  and  the  NYS  Commissioner  of  Health \nremoved the religious exemption for the recent state mandate requiring all health professionals \nget vaccinated for COVID-19.” \n156. On September 7, Dr. P. was directed to meet with the OB/GYN department chair, \nwho attempted to pressure her into being vaccinated with the suggestion that, as she had been \nadvised on August 19, “disregarding the NYS Vaccination Mandate may affect your ability to \ncontinue working and training with your residency or fellowship program.”  \n157. Dr. P. now faces the imminent loss of her residency and thus destruction of her \nentire career as she can never become a fully licensed physician and practice independently \nwithout completing a residency.  \n158. Given the Vaccine Mandate, Dr. P. will be unable to find a residency anywhere in \nthe State of New York due to her conscientious religious abstention from vaccination. \n159. Further, termination of her residency for refusal to obey the Vaccine Mandate in \nviolation of her religious belief is likely to have adverse consequences for her full licensure in \nNew York or any other jurisdiction. \n160. Dr. P. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \n \n \n34 \n \n \n\n \nPlaintiff “Technologist P.” \n161.   Plaintiff  P.    (“Technologist  P.”),  who  is  Catholic,  is  a  Nuclear  Medicine \nTechnologist,  licensed  in  the  State  of  New  York,  who  is  employed  by  a  private  health \norganization in the Eastern District. \n162.   On or about August 18, 2021, with the prior Health Order in effect, Technologist \nP. was advised by her employer that she must be vaccinated with a COVID vaccine unless she \nobtained a religious exemption, for which she applied on August 26, 2021, with extensive \nexplanation and documentation of her sincere religious belief. \n163.  After  the  Vaccine  Mandate  eliminated  religious  exemptions  on  August  26, \nhowever, Technologist P. was advised by her employer by email on September 1, 2021, that her \npending request for religious exemption had been rejected because “on August 26, 2021, the \nDOH announced that religious exemptions are not permitted under the State mandate. It is for \nthis reason that we are unable to grant your request for a religious exemption.”   \n164.  Technologist P.’s employer warned in said email that she must receive at least her \n“first shot” of one of the abortion-connected vaccines by September 27, 2020 and that “If you \nchoose to not receive your first shot between now and September 27, 2021, you will be non-\ncompliant with the NYS mandate and your continued employment will be at risk.” \n165.  Technologist P. has been further advised by her manager that, as of September 27, \nif she fails to be vaccinated against her religious belief, her security badge will be deactivated, \nshe will not be able to access her place of employment and will essentially be regarded as a \ntrespasser. \n166.  In addition to the medical facts recited in ¶ 37 (h), Technologist P. knows of a co-\nworker who collapsed after vaccination from a severe allergic reaction, requiring the calling of a \n35 \n \n \n\n \ncode and the administration of Benadryl and steroids for a month, and who returned to work \nvisibly miserable, covered in a rash, itchy, jittery, and shaking. Technologist P. has also observed \nthat  50 percent of her colleagues who contract  COVID and are out sick have been “fully \nvaccinated,” and that there is a regular flow of “fully vaccinated” patients being admitted to her \nhospital.   \n167. In  addition  to  the  medical  concerns  recited  herein  above,  Technologist  P.    is \nbreastfeeding, and there are limited data on the safety of COVID vaccines for the breastfeeding \nchild, with reports of infant death following vaccination of the breastfeeding mother. These \nmedical facts inform Technologist P.’s religious conviction against involuntary vaccination as an \ninvasion of bodily autonomy contrary to Church teaching. \n168.  Technologist P. now faces imminent loss of her employment, as well as loss of her \ncertification in disciplinary proceedings, if she refuses, as she must, any of the available COVID \nvaccines. \n169.  Any discharge from employment on account Technologist’s P’s conscientious and \nreligiously motivated refusal to take any of the available abortion-connected vaccines would \nhave to be reported upon renewal of Technologist P’s certification. \n170.  Plaintiff  Technologist  P.  will  thus  suffer  imminent  irreparable  harm  to  her \noccupation, reputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring \nenforcement of the Vaccine Mandate. \nPlaintiff “Dr. S.” \n171. Plaintiff  S.,  D.D.S.  (“Dr.  S.”),  who  is  Catholic,  is  a  board-certified  Oral  and \nMaxillofacial surgeon who, in addition to his private practice, is an attending physician with \nadmitting privileges at a hospital in the Northern District. \n36 \n \n \n\n \n172. Dr. S. and his partners have treated numerous patients who were sick with COVID \nwithout need of vaccination, and Dr. S. thus contracted COVID, from which he recovered. \nPatients with COVID were not turned away but received dental treatment that was urgently \nneeded. \n173. On  August  17,  2021,  under  the  then-applicable  DOH  vaccination  requirement, \nwhich included the prior Health Order as of August 18, Dr. S. received a religious exemption \nfrom  COVID-19  vaccination.  The  exemption  was  based  on  his  religious  convictions  as  a \nCatholic, including the beliefs enumerated above. \n174. On September 1, however, Dr. S.’s religious exemption was revoked due to the \nissuance of the Vaccine Mandate, and he was notified by hospital administration that if he fails \nto provide proof of vaccination by September 21, 2021, his hospital privileges will be suspended. \n175. As a licensed physician who has recovered from COVID, Dr. S. knows that he has \nnatural immunity, shown by studies he has reviewed to be  superior to the vaccine-induced \nimmunity that is already fading.  See Exhibit E. \n176. The imminent loss of admitting privileges at the hospital with which Dr. S is \naffiliated  will  make  it  impossible  to  conduct  his  practice,  as  he  cannot  conduct  oral  and \nmaxillofacial surgery without the ability to admit patients to a hospital if the need arises. \n177. The imminent loss of privileges will also render Dr. S. unemployable anywhere in \nthe State of New York as no other hospital would grant him privileges under the Vaccine \nMandate. \n178. The imminent loss of privileges will have to be reported at the time of license \nrenewal and may well trigger disciplinary proceedings against Dr. S.  There is also the threat that \nthe DOH will make COVID-19 vaccination a condition of license renewal. \n37 \n \n \n\n \n179. Dr.  S.  is  now  also  under  the  threat  of  disciplinary  proceedings  by  the  DOH, \nincluding license suspension or revocation as a further measure of coercion to take a vaccine that \nin his informed medical judgment he cannot take in good conscience. \n180. Dr. S. will suffer imminent irreparable harm to his occupation, reputation, and \nprofessional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Nurse S.” \n181. Plaintiff S., R.N. (“Nurse S.”), who is Catholic, is a registered nurse employed by a \nhospital in the Northern District. \n182. Nurse S. has treated a patient who had recovered from COVID but still decided to \nbe vaccinated.  After receiving the second dose of the vaccine, this patient needed high-flow \noxygen to survive and was not able to get out of bed or even turn over without exacerbation of \nher condition. \n183. On August 15, 2021, before the Vaccine Mandate removed religious exemptions, \nNurse S. applied for a religious exemption from the employing hospital, based on the beliefs \nenumerated above. Nurse S.’s request for religious exemption advised in particular that she could \nnot take any of the available COVID-19 vaccines because of their connection to aborted fetal cell \nlines, citing the analysis of each vaccine by the Charlotte Lozier Institute. Nurse S. advised that \n“is my Catholic duty to refuse the injection.” \n184. In addition to the medical concerns recited herein above, Nurse S. intends to have \nchildren, and she is aware that there is a lack of data on the effect of the available COVID \nvaccines on pregnancy and post-partum development of children, given that the vaccines have \n38 \n \n \n\n \nbeen available for less than year. These medical facts inform Nurse S.’s religious conviction \nagainst involuntary vaccination. \n185. On September 1, 2021, Nurse S. was advised by the hospital administration that due \nthe Vaccine Mandate, as of August 26, 2021 the State will not permit exemptions for sincerely \nheld religious beliefs, that “we are required to comply with state law” and that every member of \nthe staff must have at least one dose of a two-dose COVID vaccine, or a single dose vaccine by \nSeptember 21, 2021. \n186. Nurse S., who is just beginning her nursing career, now faces imminent termination \nof her employment and will be unemployable as a nurse anywhere in New York State due to the \nVaccine Mandate, as well as possible license suspension or disciplinary proceedings due to \ntermination for “insubordination.” \n187. Nurse S. will thus suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, reputation, \nand professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of the Vaccine \nMandate. \nPlaintiff “Physician Liaison X.” \n188. Plaintiff X. (“Physician Liaison X”), who is Catholic, is a physician liaison manager \nfor a major cancer center in the Southern District. Her job has been 100% remote for the past 18 \nmonths.  \n189. Last  month,  Physician  Liaison  X.’s  employer  began  mandating  COVID \nvaccinations for all employees, but with religious and medical exemptions allowed under the \nprior Health Order.  That policy changed on September 1, 2021, when her employer announced \nby email that the Vaccine Mandate had eliminated all religious exemptions, that the employer \ncould no longer grant religious exemptions, and that any religious exemptions granted would be \n39 \n \n \n\n \nrevoked.  Physician Liaison X. is thus barred from obtaining the religious exemption she seeks, \nbased on the religious beliefs enumerated above, which she holds in common with the other \nplaintiffs. \n190. Physician  Liaison  X.  now  faces  imminent  loss  of  her  employment  and  severe \ndamage to her professional reputation and future employment in the extremely competitive \nsector of the medical executive class. \n191. Physician Liaison X. will thus suffer imminent irreparable harm to her occupation, \nreputation, and professional standing in the absence of injunctive relief barring enforcement of \nthe Vaccine Mandate. \nCOUNT I \n \nVIOLATION OF THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE  \nOF THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n192. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-191 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n193. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, \nas applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the State from abridging \nPlaintiffs’ rights to free exercise of religion. \n194. Plaintiffs  have  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  that  compel  them  to  refuse \nvaccination with abortion-connected vaccines. \n195. Plaintiffs reallege the discussion of their sincerely held religious beliefs as set \nforth in all the preceding paragraphs. \n196. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, targets Plaintiffs’ sincerely held \nreligious  beliefs  by  requiring  the  revocation  of  revoking  religious  exemptions  previously \n40 \n \n \n\n \ngranted by their employers or by prohibiting them from seeking and receiving exemption and \naccommodation  for  their  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  from  their  employers,  with  the \nemployers citing the Vaccine Mandate as the grounds for refusing even to consider exemption \nrequests. \n197. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, impermissibly burdens Plaintiffs’ \nsincerely held religious beliefs, compels them to abandon their beliefs or violate them under \ncoercion, and forces Plaintiffs to choose between their religious convictions and the State’s \npatently unconstitutional value judgment that their religious beliefs are of no account and cannot \nbe considered by employers. \n198. The Vaccine Mandate strips Plaintiffs, adult medical professionals, of the right to \nreligious exemption secured by state statute even for 17-year-old college students, who can \nobtain an exemption by merely submitting “a written and signed statement from the student \n(parent or guardian of students less than 18 years of age) that he/she objects to immunization due \nto his/her religious beliefs.” See Public Health Law § 2165, Immunization Requirements for \nStudents,  https://tinyurl.com/4byd8s56. \n199. The Vaccine Mandate even eliminates the protection for religion and the allowance \nof religious exemptions under the prior Health Order, which was revised to exclude religious \naccommodation on or about August 26, 2021, only days ago. \n200. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, places Plaintiffs in an irresolvable \nconflict between compliance with the mandate and their sincerely held religious beliefs. \n201. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, puts substantial pressure on \nPlaintiffs to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs or  face loss of their occupations, \nprofessional standing, licenses, reputations, and ability to support their families. \n41 \n \n \n\n \n202. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is neither neutral nor generally \napplicable as it grants the possibility of medical exemptions for reasons of secular “health” but \nbars religious exemptions according to the State’s unconstitutional value judgment that physical \nhealth is less important than spiritual health. \n203. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, thus targets Plaintiffs’ religious \nbeliefs for disparate and discriminatory treatment. \n204. The  Vaccine  Mandate,  on  its  face  and  as  applied,  creates  a     system  of \nindividualized exemptions for preferred exemption requests based on physical health, while \ndiscriminating against    requests for exemption and accommodation based on sincerely held \nreligious beliefs. \n205. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is a religious gerrymander that, \nonly days after promulgation of the Health Order allowing religious exemptions, excluded \nsincerely held religious beliefs from any form of accommodation while permitting state-favored \nmedical exemptions. \n206. There is no legitimate, rational, or compelling interest in the Vaccine Mandate’s \nexclusion of exemptions and accommodations for sincerely held religious beliefs, especially \ngiven the following facts: (a) those exempted for reasons of “health” are no less susceptible of \ncontracting and spreading COVID (the prevention of which is the very reason for the Vaccine \nMandate) than those who would be exempted for reasons of religion (b) that the available \nCOVID-19 vaccines are clearly failing to prevent transmission or infection, so that “booster \nshots” are now being promoted; (c) even the vaccinated must continue to wear masks as if they \nwere not  vaccinated because they can still  be infected  or infect  others; (d) that naturally \nimmune persons who have recovered from COVID have superior immunity and do not need \n42 \n \n \n\n \nvaccination;  (e)  that  vaccinating    naturally  immune  people  may  harm  them  by  causing  a \nhyperimmune response; and (f) that vaccinated persons are being admitted to the hospital along \nwith unvaccinated persons. \n207. The Vaccine Mandate is not the least restrictive means of achieving an otherwise \npermissible government interest, which could be achieved by the  same protective measures \n(masking,  testing,  quarantining,  etc.)  already  being  required  of  the  vaccinated  and  the \nunvaccinated alike (including those exempted for health reasons). \n208. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, has caused, is causing, and will \ncontinue to cause irreparable harm and actual and undue hardship to Plaintiffs from violation of \ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs and the occupational, professional, social and economic \nconsequences pleaded above. \n209. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law to prevent the continuing violation of \ntheir constitutional liberties and sincerely held religious beliefs. \nCOUNT II \n \nVIOLATION OF THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE OF  \nTHE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION BY  \n(42 U.S.C. ¶ 1983)) \n \n210. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-209 \nas if fully set forth herein. \n211. The Supremacy Clause provides: \n \nThis Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in \nPursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the \nAuthority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and \nthe Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution \nor Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding. \n \nU.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 22 (emphasis added). \n \n43 \n \n \n\n \n212. The Vaccine Mandate, both facially and as applied, compels employers of health \ncare workers in the State of New York to disregard Title VII’s protection against employment \ndiscrimination  on  account  of  religion,  forbidding  any  accommodation  of  religious  belief \nwhatsoever and even requiring the revocation of previously granted religious exemptions from \nCOVID vaccination. \n213. The Vaccine Mandate thus requires actions that federal law forbids, which renders \nthe Vaccine Mandate null and void. Mutual Pharm. Co., Inc. v. Bartlett, 570 U.S. 472, 486 \n(2013). \n214. All of Plaintiffs’ employers have 15 or more employees and are subject to the \nrequirements of Title VII. \n215. By attempting to preclude application of Title VII in the State of New York in the \ncase of COVID vaccination,  the Vaccine Mandate patently violates the Supremacy Clause. \n216. In particular, the Vaccine Mandate purports to negate Title VII’s requirement that \nemployers provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with sincerely held religious \nbeliefs,  and  even  flatly  prohibits  religious  exemption  or  accommodation  requests,  as  the \nemployers noted above have indicated. \n217. By purporting to place themselves and their mandate outside the protections of \nboth Title VII and the First Amendment, Defendants have violated the basic constitutional \nprinciple that “federal law is as much the law of the several States as are the laws passed by \ntheir legislatures.” Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729, 734 (2009) (emphasis added). \n218. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, has caused, is causing, and will \ncontinue to cause irreparable harm and actual and undue hardship to Plaintiffs from violation of \n44 \n \n \n\n \ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs and the occupational, professional, social and economic \nconsequences pleaded above. \n219. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the continuing deprivation of their \nstatutory rights under Title VII as secured by the Supremacy Clause. \nCOUNT III \n \nVIOLATION OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n220. Plaintiffs hereby reallege and adopt each and every allegation in paragraphs 1-209 \nabove as if fully set forth herein. \n221. The  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution  guarantees \nPlaintiffs’ right to equal protection under the law. \n222. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is an unconstitutional abridgment \nof Plaintiffs’ right to equal protection, is not neutral, and specifically targets Plaintiffs’ sincerely \nheld religious beliefs for discriminatory and unequal treatment as compared with the medical \nexemptions favored by the State’s impermissible, anti-religious value judgment. \n223. The  Vaccine  Mandate,  on  its  face  and  as  applied,  is  an  unconstitutional \nabridgement of Plaintiffs’ right to equal protection because it permits the State to treat Plaintiffs \ndifferently from similarly situated healthcare workers solely on the basis of Plaintiffs’ sincerely \nheld religious beliefs. \n224. The  Vaccine  Mandate,  on  its  face  and  as  applied,  singles  out  Plaintiffs  for \nselective  treatment  based  upon  their  sincerely  held  religious  objections  to  the  COVID-19 \nvaccines. \n45 \n \n \n\n \n225. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, was clearly designed to slam \nshut  what  Defendants  undoubtedly  viewed  as  a  large  potential  “escape  hatch”  from  their \nplanned regime of brute coercion to be vaccinated under penalty of personal and professional \ndestruction, which regime has no precedent in the history of the United States.  This is shown \nby the Vaccine Mandate’s abrupt excision of religious protection and religious accommodation \nfrom the prior Health Order, issued only days before.  The intent is clearly to leave religious \nbelievers with no choice but to violate their religious beliefs to keep their jobs and avoid \nprofessional destruction and financial hardship. \n226. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, creates a    system of classes and \ncategories that  improperly  accommodates exemptions for the  class  of    healthcare  workers \nconcerned with bodily health while denying exemption to the class of health care workers \nconcerned with spiritual health above bodily health, including all the Plaintiffs herein. \n227. The Vaccine Mandate, reversing the State’s policy of only days before, arbitrarily \nand capriciously attempts to deny Plaintiffs and others similarly situated the protection for \nreligion and the requirement of religious accommodation under both the Human Rights Law of \nthe State of New York and the Human Rights Law of the City of New York, as well as the \nparallel  the  protections  of  Title VII,  while  leaving  untouched  protections  under  the  same \nstatutes for other protected classes, including by allowing exemptions for reasons of “health” \nbut not religion. \n228. The Vaccine Mandate arbitrarily and capriciously denies to adult medical workers \nwith  expert  knowledge  of  vaccination  and  its  risks  the  same  religious  exemption  from \nvaccination available to any college student under Public Health Law § 2615, as pleaded above. \n46 \n \n \n\n \n229. By  purporting  to  negate  statutorily  required  religious  accommodations  from \nconsideration in the State of New York, Defendants, via the Vaccine Mandate, have singled out \nfor disparate treatment the specific class of healthcare employees whose motive for seeking \nexemption from vaccination is religious rather than medical. \n230. Further, Nurse J, Nurse N, Dr. P, and Dr. S have all previously had COVID or \nCOVID-like symptoms and, on information and belief, have natural immunity at a level no less \nthan, and likely far more than, the immunity purportedly offered by available COVID vaccines. \n(See Exhibit E.) \n231. There is no rational, legitimate, or compelling interest in the Vaccine Mandate’s \napplication of different standards to different, similarly situated groups in the field of healthcare. \n232. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, discriminates between religion \nand nonreligion by allowing nonreligious exemptions to the Vaccine Mandate while prohibiting \nreligious exemptions. \n233. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, is a “status-based enactment \ndivorced from any factual context” and “a classification of persons undertaken for its own \nsake,” which “the Equal Protection Clause does not permit.” Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 635 \n(1996).  The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, “identifies      persons by a single trait \n[religious beliefs] and then denies them protections across the board.” Id. at 633. \n234. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, by allowing medical exemptions \nwhile denying religious exemptions, is a “disqualification of a class    of persons from the right to \nseek specific protection [for their religious beliefs].” Id. \n235. “A law declaring that in general it shall be more difficult for one group of citizens \nthan for all others to seek [an exemption from the COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate] is itself a \n47 \n \n \n\n \ndenial of equal protection of the laws in the most literal sense.” Id. The Vaccine Mandate, on its \nface and as applied, is such a measure. \n236. The Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, has caused, is causing, and will \ncontinue to cause irreparable harm and actual and undue hardship to Plaintiffs from violation of \ntheir sincerely held religious beliefs and the occupational, professional, social and economic \nconsequences pleaded above. \n237. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law for the continuing deprivation of their \nrights under the Equal Protection Clause. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for relief as follows as to all Counts: \n \n  (A). A statewide temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction, followed by \na  permanent  injunction,  restraining  and  enjoining  the  Defendants,  their  officers,  agents, \nemployees,  attorneys  and  successors  in  office,  and  all  other  persons  in  active  concert  or \nparticipation  with  them,  from  enforcing,  threatening  to  enforce,  attempting  to  enforce,  or \notherwise requiring compliance with the Vaccine Mandate such that: \n(1)  The  Vaccine  Mandate  is  suspended  in  operation  to  the  extent  that  the \nDepartment of Health is barred from enforcing any requirement that employers \ndeny religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination or that they revoke any \nexemptions employers already granted before the Vaccine Mandate superseded \nthe prior Health Order to exclude religious exemptions, including the exemptions \nalready granted to certain of the Plaintiffs herein; \n48 \n \n \n\n \n(2) The Department of Health is barred from interfering in any way with the \ngranting of religious exemptions from COVID-19 vaccination going forward, or \nwith the operation of exemptions already granted under the prior Health Order;  \n(3) The Department of Health is barred from taking any action, disciplinary or \notherwise, against the licensure, certification, residency, admitting privileges or \nother professional status or qualification of any of the Plaintiffs on account of \ntheir seeking or having obtained a religious exemption from mandatory COVID-\n19 vaccination. \n  (B). A declaratory judgment declaring that the Vaccine Mandate, both on its face and as \napplied by Defendants, is unconstitutional, unlawful, and unenforceable in that: \n(1) the Vaccine Mandate violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by \ndepriving Plaintiffs and others similarly situated of the free exercise of religion under a \nmeasure that is neither neutral nor generally applicable but rather favors secular over \nreligious reasons for exemption from COVID-19 vaccination and specifically targets for \nelimination the religious exemptions provided only days earlier under the superseded \nHealth Order; \n(2) the Vaccine Mandate violates the Supremacy Clause by purporting to strip Plaintiff \nand others similarly situated of statutory and constitutional protections for religion and \nreligious accommodation under federal law; \n(3)    the  Vaccine  Mandate  violates  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment by purporting to strip Plaintiffs and others similarly situated of state and \nfederal statutory  protection  from  discrimination  in  the  matter  of  vaccination  solely \nbecause of the religious grounds on which Plaintiffs seek protection. \n49 \n \n \n\n \n  (C). An award of reasonable costs and expenses of this action, including a reasonable \nattorney’s fee, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \n  (D).  Such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable and just under  the \ncircumstances. \nDated:  September 13, 2021 \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,   \n   \n   \n__________________________  _________________________ \nMMICHAEL G.

\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nREGULATORY IMPACT STATEMENT \nStatutory Authority: \n  The authority for the promulgation of these regulations is contained in Public Health Law \n(PHL) Sections 225(5), 2800, 2803(2), 3612 and 4010 (4). PHL 225(5) authorizes the Public \nHealth and Health Planning Council (PHHPC) to issue regulations in the State Sanitary Code \npertaining to any matters affecting the security of life or health or the preservation and \nimprovement of public health in the state of New York, including designation and control of \ncommunicable diseases and ensuring infection control at healthcare facilities and any other \npremises. \nPHL Article 28 (Hospitals), Section 2800 specifies that “hospital and related services \nincluding health-related service of the highest quality, efficiently provided and properly utilized \nat a reasonable cost, are of vital concern to the public health.  In order to provide for the \nprotection and promotion of the health of the inhabitants of the state, pursuant to section three of \narticle seventeen of the constitution, the department of health shall have the central, \ncomprehensive responsibility for the development and administration of the state's policy with \nrespect to hospital and related services, and all public and private institutions, whether state, \ncounty, municipal, incorporated or not incorporated, serving principally as facilities for the \nprevention, diagnosis or treatment of human disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical \ncondition or for the rendering of health-related service shall be subject to the provisions of this \narticle.” \n  PHL Section 2803(2) authorizes PHHPC to adopt and amend rules and regulations, \nsubject to the approval of the Commissioner, to implement the purposes and provisions of PHL \nArticle 28, and to establish minimum standards governing the operation of health care facilities.   \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nPHL Section 3612 authorizes PHHPC to adopt and amend rules and regulations, subject to the \napproval of the Commissioner, with respect to certified home health agencies, long term home \nhealth care programs, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) home care programs, \nlicensed home care service agencies, and limited licensed home care service agencies.  PHL \nSection 4010 (4) authorizes PHHPC to adopt and amend rules and regulations, subject to the \napproval of the Commissioner, with respect to hospice organizations. \n  Social Service Law (SSL) Section 461 requires the Department to promulgate regulations \nestablishing general standards applicable to Adult Care Facilities (ACF). SSL Section 461-e \nauthorizes the Department to promulgate regulations to require adult care facilities to maintain \ncertain records with respect to the facilities residents and the operation of the facility. \n \nLegislative Objectives: \n  The legislative objective of PHL Section 225 empowers PHHPC to address any issue \naffecting the security of life or health or the preservation and improvement of public health in the \nstate of New York, including designation and control of communicable diseases and ensuring \ninfection control at healthcare facilities and any other premises. PHL Article 28 specifically \naddresses the protection of the health of the residents of the State by assuring the efficient \nprovision and proper utilization of health services of the highest quality at a reasonable cost. \nPHL Article 36 addresses the services rendered by certified home health agencies, long term \nhome health care programs, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) home care programs, \nlicensed home care service agencies, and limited licensed home care service agencies. PHL \nArticle 40 declares that hospice is a socially and financially beneficial alternative to conventional \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \ncurative care for the terminally ill.  Lastly, the legislative objective of SSL Section 461 is to \npromote the health and well-being of residents of ACFs. \n \nNeeds and Benefits: \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified a concerning \nnational trend of increasing circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. Since early July, cases \nhave risen 10-fold, and 95 percent of the sequenced recent positives in New York State were the \nDelta variant.  Recent New York State data show that unvaccinated individuals are \napproximately 5 times as likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to vaccinated \nindividuals.  Those who are unvaccinated have over 11 times the risk of being hospitalized with \nCOVID-19.   \nThe COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.  They offer the benefit of helping to \nreduce the number of COVID-19 infections, including the Delta variant, which is a critical \ncomponent to protecting public health.  Certain settings, such as healthcare facilities and \ncongregate care settings, pose increased challenges and urgency for controlling the spread of this \ndisease because of the vulnerable patient and resident populations that they serve. Unvaccinated \npersonnel in such settings have an unacceptably high risk of both acquiring COVID-19 and \ntransmitting the virus to colleagues and/or vulnerable patients or residents, exacerbating staffing \nshortages, and causing unacceptably high risk of complications. \nIn response to this significant public health threat, through this emergency regulation, the \nDepartment is requiring covered entities to ensure their personnel are fully vaccinated against \nCOVID-19, and to document evidence thereof in appropriate records.  Covered entities are also \nrequired to review and make determinations on medical exemption requests, and provide \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nreasonable accommodations therefor to protect the wellbeing of the patients, residents and \npersonnel in such facilities.    Documentation and information regarding personnel vaccinations \nas well as exemption requests granted are required to be provided to the Department immediately \nupon request.  \n \nCosts for the Implementation of and Continuing Compliance with these Regulations to the \nRegulated Entity: \n  Covered entities must ensure that personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and \ndocument such vaccination in personnel or other appropriate records.  Covered entities must also \nreview and make determinations on requests for medical exemptions, which must also be \ndocumented in personnel or other appropriate records, as well as any reasonable \naccommodations. This is a modest investment to protect the health and safety of patients, \nresidents, and personnel, especially when compared to both the direct medical costs and indirect \ncosts of personnel absenteeism. \n \nCost to State and Local Government: \n  The State operates several healthcare facilities subject to this regulation.  Most county \nhealth departments are licensed under Article 28 or Article 36 of the PHL and are therefore also \nsubject to regulation.  Similarly, certain counties and the City of New York operate facilities \nlicensed under Article 28.  These State and local public facilities would be required to ensure that \npersonnel are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and document such vaccination in personnel or \nother appropriate records.  They must also review and make determinations on requests for \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nmedical exemptions, which must also be documented in personnel or other appropriate records, \nalong with any reasonable accommodations. \nAlthough the costs to the State or local governments cannot be determined with precision, \nthe Department does not expect these costs to be significant.  State facilities should already be \nensuring COVID-19 vaccination among their personnel, subject to State directives. Further, these \nentities are expected to realize savings as a result of the reduction in COVID-19 in personnel and \nthe attendant loss of productivity and available staff.  \n   \nCost to the Department of Health: \n  There are no additional costs to the State or local government, except as noted above.  \nExisting staff will be utilized to conduct surveillance of regulated parties and to monitor \ncompliance with these provisions. \n \nLocal Government Mandates: \nCovered entities operated by local governments will be subject to the same requirements \nas any other covered entity subject to this regulation.  \n \nPaperwork: \n  This measure will require covered entities to ensure that personnel are fully vaccinated \nagainst COVID-19 and document such vaccination in personnel or other appropriate records.  \nCovered entities must also review and make determinations on requests for medical exemptions, \nwhich must also be documented in personnel or other appropriate records along with any \nreasonable accommodations. \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nUpon the request of the Department, covered entities must report the number and \npercentage of total covered personnel, as well as the number and percentage that have been \nvaccinated against COVID-19 and those who have been granted a medical exemption, along with \nany reasonable accommodations.  Facilities and agencies must develop and implement a policy \nand procedure to ensure compliance with the provisions of this section, making such documents \navailable to the Department upon request. \n \nDuplication: \n  This regulation will not conflict with any state or federal rules.   \n \nAlternative Approaches: \nOne alternative would be to require covered entities to test all personnel in their facility \nbefore each shift worked. This approach is limited in its effect because testing only provides a \nperson’s status at the time of the test and testing every person in a healthcare facility every day is \nimpractical and would place an unreasonable resource and financial burden on covered entities if \nPCR tests couldn’t be rapidly turned around before the commencement of the shift. Antigen tests \nhave not proven as reliable for asymptomatic diagnosis to date.  \nAnother alternative to requiring covered entities to mandate vaccination would be to \nrequire covered entities to mandate all personnel to wear a fit-tested N95 face covering at all \ntimes when in the facility, in order to prevent transmission of the virus. However, acceptable face \ncoverings, which are not fit-tested N95 face coverings have been a long-standing requirement in \nthese covered entities, and, while helpful to reduce transmission it does not prevent transmission \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nand; therefore, masking in addition to vaccination will help reduce the numbers of infections in \nthese settings even further. \n \nFederal Requirements: \n  There are no minimum standards established by the federal government for the same or \nsimilar subject areas. \n \nCompliance Schedule: \n  These proposed emergency regulations will become effective upon filing with the \nDepartment of State and will expire, unless renewed, 90 days from the date of filing.   As the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is consistently and rapidly changing, it is not possible to determine the \nexpected duration of need at this point in time.  The Department will continuously evaluate the \nexpected duration of these emergency regulations throughout the aforementioned 90-day \neffective period in making determinations on the need for continuing this regulation on an \nemergency basis or issuing a notice of proposed ruling-making for permanent adoption.  This \nnotice does not constitute a notice of proposed or revised rule making for permanent adoption. \n \nContact Person:    Ms. Katherine E.

Currently, 5 general \nhospitals, 79 nursing homes, 75 certified home health agencies (CHHAs), 20 hospices and 1,055 \nlicensed home care service agencies (LHCSAs), and 483 adult care facilities (ACFs) are small \nbusinesses (defined as 100 employees or less), independently owned and operated affected by \nthis rule. Local governments operate 19 hospitals, 137 diagnostic and treatment facilities, 21 \nnursing homes, 12 CHHAs, at least 48 LHCSAs, 1 hospice, and 2 ACFs.  \n \nCompliance Requirements:  \nCovered entities are required to ensure their personnel are fully vaccinated against \nCOVID-19, and to document evidence thereof in appropriate records.  Covered entities are also \nrequired to review and make determinations on medical exemption requests, along with any \nreasonable accommodations.   \nUpon the request of the Department, covered entities must report the number and \npercentage of total covered personnel, as well as the number and percentage that have been \nvaccinated against COVID-19 and those who have been granted a medical exemption, along with \nany reasonable accommodations.  Facilities and agencies must develop and implement a policy \nand procedure to ensure compliance with the provisions of this section, making such documents \navailable to the Department upon request. \n \nProfessional Services:  \nThere are no additional professional services required as a result of this regulation.    \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nCompliance Costs: \n  Covered entities must ensure that personnel are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and \ndocument such vaccination in personnel or other appropriate records.  Covered entities must also \nreview and make determinations on requests for medical exemptions, which must also be \ndocumented in personnel or other appropriate records, along with any reasonable \naccommodations. This is a modest investment to protect the health and safety of patients, \nresidents, and personnel, especially when compared to both the direct medical costs and indirect \ncosts of personnel absenteeism. \nEconomic and Technological Feasibility:  \nThere are no economic or technological impediments to the rule changes. \n \nMinimizing Adverse Impact: \nAs part of ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, regulated parties have \nbeen a partner in implementing measures to limit the spread and/or mitigate the impact of \nCOVID-19 within the Department since March of 2020.  Further, the Department currently has \nan emergency regulation in place, which requires nursing homes and adult care facilities to offer \nCOVID-19 vaccination to personnel and residents, which has helped to facilitated vaccination of \npersonnel.  Further, it is the Department’s understanding that many facilities across the State \nhave begun to impose mandatory vaccination policies.  Lastly, on August 18, 2021, President \nBiden announced that as a condition of participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the \nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services will be developing regulations \nrequiring nursing homes to mandate COVID-19 vaccination for workers.  \n \n \n \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nSmall Business and Local Government Participation: \n  Due to the emergent nature of COVID-19, small businesses and local governments were \nnot consulted.  If these regulations are proposed for permanent adoption, all parties will have an \nopportunity to provide comments during the notice and comment period. \n \n \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nRURAL AREA FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS \nType and Estimated Numbers of Rural Areas: \nWhile this rule applies uniformly throughout the state, including rural areas, for the \npurposes of this Rural Area Flexibility Analysis (RAFA), “rural area” means areas of the state \ndefined by Exec.

Law § 481(7), rural areas are \ndefined as “counties within the state having less than two hundred thousand population, and the \nmunicipalities, individuals, institutions, communities, and programs and such other entities or \nresources found therein.  In counties of two hundred thousand or greater population ‘rural areas’ \nmeans towns with population densities of one hundred fifty persons or less per square mile, and \nthe villages, individuals, institutions, communities, programs and such other entities or resources \nas are found therein.” \nThe following 42 counties have an estimated population of less than 200,000 based upon \n2019 United States Census projections: \n \nAllegany County   Greene County   Schuyler County \nBroome  Hamilton County   Seneca County \nCattaraugus County   Herkimer County   St. Lawrence County  \nCayuga County   Jefferson County   Steuben County \nChautauqua County  Lewis County  Sullivan County  \nChemung County  Livingston County  Tioga County  \nChenango County   Madison County   Tompkins County  \nClinton County   Montgomery County  Ulster County \nColumbia County   Ontario County  Warren County  \nCortland County  Orleans County   \nDelaware County  Schoharie County    \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nEssex County  Oswego County   Washington County \nFranklin County  Otsego County   Wayne County  \nFulton County   Putnam County   Wyoming County \nGenesee County  Rensselaer County  Yates County \n   Schenectady County   \n \n \nThe following counties of have population of 200,000 or greater, and towns with \npopulation densities of 150 person or fewer per square mile, based upon 2019 United States \nCensus population projections: \n \nAlbany County   Niagara County  Saratoga County   \nDutchess County   Oneida County    Suffolk County  \nErie County   Onondaga County     \nMonroe County   Orange County     \n \nReporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements; and professional services: \nCovered entities are required to ensure their personnel are fully vaccinated against \nCOVID-19, and to document evidence thereof in appropriate records.

Since early July, cases \nhave risen 10-fold, and 95 percent of the sequenced recent positives in New York State were the \nDelta variant. Recent New York State data show that unvaccinated individuals are approximately \n5 times as likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to vaccinated individuals.  Those \nwho are unvaccinated have over 11 times the risk of being hospitalized with COVID-19.  \nThe COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.  They offer the benefit of helping to \nreduce the number of COVID-19 infections, including the Delta variant, which is a critical \ncomponent to protecting public health. Certain settings, such as healthcare facilities and \ncongregate care settings, pose increased challenges and urgency for controlling the spread of this \ndisease because of the vulnerable patient and resident populations that they serve. Unvaccinated \npersonnel in such settings have an unacceptably high risk of both acquiring COVID-19 and \ntransmitting the virus to colleagues and/or vulnerable patients or residents, exacerbating staffing \nshortages, and causing unacceptably high risk of complications. \nIn response to this significant public health threat, through this emergency regulation, the \nDepartment is requiring covered entities to ensure their personnel are fully vaccinated against \nCOVID-19, and to document evidence thereof in appropriate records.  Covered entities are also \nrequired to review and make determinations on medical exemption requests, and provide \nreasonable accommodations therefor to protect the wellbeing of the patients, residents and \npersonnel in such facilities. Documentation and information regarding personnel vaccinations as \nwell as exemption requests granted are required to be provided to the Department immediately \nupon request.  \n\nEXHIBIT A\n \nBased on the foregoing, the Department has determined that these emergency regulations \nare necessary to control the spread of COVID-19 in the identified regulated facilities or entities. \nAs described above, current circumstances and the risk of spread to vulnerable resident and \npatient populations by unvaccinated personnel in these settings necessitate immediate action and, \npursuant to the State Administrative Procedure Act Section 202(6), a delay in the issuance of \nthese emergency regulations would be contrary to public interest. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nEXHIBIT B \n\nEXHIBIT B\n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK : DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n      IN THE MATTER \n                                                                           ORDER FOR                                 \n             OF                          SUMMARY \n                                                                           ACTION \n      COVERED ENTITIES IN THE PREVENTION  \n     AND CONTROL OF THE 2019 NOVEL  \n          CORONAVIRUS                                              \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nWHEREAS the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) is an infection associated with fever \nand signs and symptoms of pneumonia and other respiratory illness that is easily transmitted \nfrom person to person, predominantly through droplet transmission, and has significant public \nhealth consequences; and  \n \nWHEREAS COVID-19 is a global pandemic that, to date, has resulted in 2,195,903 documented \ncases and 43,277 deaths in New York State alone; and \n \nWHEREAS the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified a concerning \nnational trend of increasing circulation of the Delta COVID-19 variant; and \n \nWHEREAS the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use \nAuthorizations (EUA) for Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna, and  Janssen COVID-19 vaccines which \nhave been shown to be safe and effective as determined by data from the manufacturers and \nfindings from large clinical trials; and \n \n \n\nEXHIBIT B\n \nWHEREAS while New York State has aggressively promoted vaccination since COVID-19 \nvaccines first became available in December 2020, current vaccination rates are not high enough \nto prevent the spread of the Delta variant, which is approximately twice as transmissible as the \noriginal SARS-CoV-2 strain; and \n \nWHEREAS data show that unvaccinated individuals are approximately 5 times as likely to be \ndiagnosed with COVID-19 as are vaccinated individuals; and  \n \nWHEREAS those who are unvaccinated have over 10 times the risk of being seriously ill and \nhospitalized with COVID-19; and \n \nWHEREAS since early July, cases have risen 10-fold, and 95 percent of sequenced recent \npositives in New York State were the Delta variant; and \n \nWHEREAS certain settings, such as healthcare facilities, pose increased challenges and urgency \nfor controlling the spread of this disease because of the vulnerable patient and resident \npopulations that they serve; and  \n \nWHEREAS unvaccinated personnel in such settings have an unacceptably high risk of both \nacquiring COVID-19 and transmitting such virus to colleagues and/or vulnerable patients or \nresidents; and \n \n\nEXHIBIT B\n \nWHEREAS based upon the foregoing, the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York is \nof the Opinion that all entities identified in this Order (“covered entities”), must immediately \nimplement and comply with the requirements identified herein, and that failure to do so \nconstitutes a danger to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of New York; and  \n \nWHEREAS the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York has determined that requiring \ncovered entities to immediately implement and comply with the requirements set forth herein \nand cannot be achieved through alternative means, including the adoption of the Public Health \nand Health Planning Council of emergency regulations, without delay, which would be \nprejudicial to health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of New York; and \n \nWHEREAS it therefore appears to be prejudicial to the interest of the people to delay action for \nfifteen (15) days until an opportunity for a hearing can be provided in accordance with the \nprovisions of Public Health Law Section (PHL) 12-a. \n \nNOW, THEREFORE, THE HEALTH COMMISSIONER HEREBY ORDERS THAT:  Pursuant \nto PHL § 16: \n(a) Definitions.  \n(1) Covered entity shall mean a general hospital or nursing home pursuant to section 2801 of \nthe Public Health Law. \n(2) Covered Personnel.

ZUCKER, M.D., J.D. \n            Commissioner of Health  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nEXHIBIT C \n\nEXHIBIT C\n\n \n \n \nEXHIBIT D \n\n \nEXHIBIT D\n\nEXHIBIT D\nDear Flock of East Texas, \n“To know that God is not distant but close, not indifferent but compassionate, not aloof but \na merciful Father who follows us lovingly with respect for our freedom: all this is a cause of \ndeep joy which the alternating ups and downs of daily life cannot touch.”  \nPope John Paul II, Angelus, Third Sunday of Advent, 2003 \nAs the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tyler, I wish you peace as we approach the end \nof a challenging 2020 and unwavering faith as we enter 2021. We have walked together through \nthese difficult times. Soon we will face the availability of vaccines which we hope will alleviate \nthe painful consequences of COVID-19 and its spread. Along with other Christian leaders, I have \nstressed the importance of ensuring that vaccines respect the dignity of human life and do not \nuse the remains of electively aborted children in any part of the process. \nWe have the responsibility to make an informed and moral choice as to the use of a particular \nvaccine. The Church teaches: “Conscience must be informed and moral judgment enlightened. A \nwell-formed conscience is upright and truthful. It formulates its judgments according to reason, \nin conformity with the true good willed by the wisdom of the Creator” (Catechism of the Catholic \nChurch 1783). Christians are called to form their consciences in accordance with what is true as \nrevealed in natural law and divine revelation and to act accordingly when deciding about the use \nof a COVID-19 vaccine.  \nEvery procured abortion murders an innocent human person. For university, government, or \nindustrial scientists to use materials obtained from the remains of an electively aborted child in \nthe research, development, testing, or production of any vaccine is immoral and constitutes \nformal  cooperation  in  evil.  We  must  never  cease  to  protest  this  practice  with  maximum \ndetermination to defend the dignity and sacredness of children in the womb. They are not objects \nto be used but persons to be received as gifts, our brothers and sisters. As your shepherd, I cannot \nin good conscience receive a vaccine that has been produced using an aborted child. There are \nethical vaccines in development which are worth waiting for. \nThe instructions, which were promulgated in Dignitas Personae in 2008, say we have a duty to \nask healthcare systems to do better. In this time of Covid-19, Catholic leaders have not asked for \nbetter. Too many have accepted the exploitation of aborted children. I urge you to reject any \nvaccine  that  uses  the  remains  of  aborted  children  in  research,  testing,  development,  or \nproduction. Testify to the truth that abortion must be rejected and make a choice that is \nconsistent with the dignity of every human life from conception to natural death and is rooted in \na mature faith and trust in eternal life, not fear of suffering in this life.  \n\nEXHIBIT D\nAs  bishop,  I  affirm  the  call  from  the  American  Association  of  Pro-Life  Obstetricians  and \nGynecologists, American College of Pediatricians, Catholic Medical Association, and Christian \nMedical and Dental Associations that we should all “expect and demand vaccines that are safe, \neffective, and ethically sound” (Joint Statement, December 2, 2020). Until that day, I urge all of \nus to exercise patience and to educate our conscience by studying the teaching of the Church. \nThen remain faithful to the truth concerning the dignity of every human life. We must prayerfully \nconsider how we might best conform our will to Jesus Christ and seek the good in all things for \nourselves, for our families, and for our communities. To echo Dignitas Personae, may we here in \nEast Texas “mobilize our consciences in favour of life.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMost Reverend Joseph E. Strickland \nBishop of Tyler \n\nEXHIBIT D\nOn The Moral Illicitness Of The Use Of  \nVaccines Made From Cells Derived From  \nAborted Human Fetuses \nIn recent weeks, news agencies and various information sources have reported that, in \nresponse to the Covid-19 emergency, some countries have produced vaccines using cell \nlines from aborted human fetuses. In other countries, such vaccines are being planned. \nA growing chorus of churchmen (bishops’ conferences, individual bishops, and priests) \nhas said that, in the event that no alternative vaccine using ethically licit substances is \navailable, it would be morally permissible for Catholics to receive vaccines made from \nthe cell lines of aborted babies. Supporters of this position invoke two documents of the \nHoly See: the first, from the Pontifical Academy for Life, is titled, “Moral reflections on \nvaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human fetuses” and was issued on \nJune 9, 2005; the second, an Instruction from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the \nFaith, is titled, “Dignitas Personae, on certain bioethical questions” and was issued on \nSeptember 8, 2008. Both of these documents allow for the use of such vaccines in \nexceptional cases and for a limited time, on the basis of what in moral theology is called \nremote, passive, material cooperation with evil. The aforementioned documents assert \nthat Catholics who use such vaccines at the same time have “the duty to make known \ntheir disagreement and to ask that their healthcare system make other types of vaccines \navailable.” \nIn the case of vaccines made from the cell lines of aborted human fetuses, we see a clear \ncontradiction between the Catholic doctrine to categorically, and beyond the shadow of \nany doubt, reject abortion in all cases as a grave moral evil that cries out to heaven for \nvengeance (see Catechism of the Catholic Church n. 2268, n. 2270), and the practice of \nregarding vaccines derived from aborted fetal cell lines as morally acceptable in \nexceptional cases of “urgent need” — on the grounds of remote, passive, material \ncooperation. To argue that such vaccines can be morally licit if there is no alternative is \nin itself contradictory and cannot be acceptable for Catholics. \nOne ought to recall the following words of Pope John Paul II regarding the dignity of \nunborn human life: “The inviolability of the person which is a reflection of the absolute \ninviolability of God, finds its primary and fundamental expression in the inviolability of \nhuman life. Above all, the common outcry, which is justly made on behalf of human \nrights — for example, the right to health, to home, to work, to family, to culture — is \nfalse and illusory if the right to life, the most basic and fundamental right and the \ncondition for all other personal rights, is not defended with maximum determination.” \n(Christifideles Laici, 38). Using vaccines made from the cells of murdered unborn \nchildren contradicts a “maximum determination” to defend unborn life. \nThe theological principle of material cooperation is certainly valid and may be applied \nto a whole host of cases (e.g. in paying taxes, the use of products made from slave labor, \nand so on). However, this principle can hardly be applied to the case of vaccines made \nfrom fetal cell lines, because those who knowingly and voluntarily receive such vaccines \nenter into a kind of concatenation, albeit very remote, with the process of the abortion \nindustry. The crime of abortion is so monstrous that any kind of concatenation with this \ncrime, even a very remote one, is immoral and cannot be accepted under any \n\nEXHIBIT D\ncircumstances by a Catholic once he has become fully aware of it. One who uses these \nvaccines must realize that his body is benefitting from the “fruits” (although steps \nremoved through a series of chemical processes) of one of mankind’s greatest crimes. \nAny link to the abortion process, even the most remote and implicit, will cast a shadow \nover the Church’s duty to bear unwavering witness to the truth that abortion must be \nutterly rejected. The ends cannot justify the means. We are living through one of the \nworst genocides known to man. Millions upon millions of babies across the world have \nbeen slaughtered in their mother’s womb, and day after day this hidden genocide \ncontinues through the abortion industry, biomedical research and fetal technology, and \na push by governments and international bodies to promote such vaccines as one of \ntheir goals. Now is not the time for Catholics to yield; to do so would be grossly \nirresponsible. The acceptance of these vaccines by Catholics, on the grounds that they \ninvolve only a “remote, passive and material cooperation” with evil, would play into the \nhands of the Church’s enemies and weaken her as the last stronghold against the evil of \nabortion. \nWhat else can a vaccine derived from fetal cell lines be other than a violation of the God-\ngiven Order of Creation? For it is based on a serious violation of this Order through the \nmurder of an unborn child. Had this child not been denied the right to life, had his cells \n(which have been further cultivated several times in the lab) not been made available for \nthe production of a vaccine, they could not be marketed. We therefore have here a \ndouble violation of God’s holy Order: on the one hand, through the abortion itself, and \non the other hand, through the heinous business of trafficking and marketing the \nremains of aborted children. Yet, this double disregard for the divine Order of Creation \ncan never be justified, not even on the grounds of preserving the health of a person or \nsociety through such vaccines. Our society has created a substitute religion: health has \nbeen made the highest good, a substitute god to whom sacrifices must be offered — in \nthis case, through a vaccine based on the death of another human life. \nIn examining the ethical questions surrounding vaccines, we have to ask ourselves: How \nand why did all of this become possible? Was there truly no alternative? Why did \nmurder-based technology emerge in medicine, whose purpose is instead to bring life \nand health? Bio-medical research that exploits the innocent unborn and uses their \nbodies as “raw material” for the purpose of vaccines seems more akin to cannibalism \nthan medicine. We also ought to consider that, for some in the bio-medical industry, the \ncell lines of unborn children are a “product,” the abortionist and vaccine manufacturer \nare the “supplier,” and the recipients of the vaccine are “consumers.” Technology based \non murder is rooted in hopelessness and ends in despair. We must resist the myth that \n“there is no alternative.” On the contrary, we must proceed with the hope and conviction \nthat alternatives exist, and that human ingenuity, with the help of God, can discover \nthem. This is the only way to pass from darkness to light, and from death to life. \nThe Lord said that in the end times even the elect will be seduced (cf. Mk. 13:22). Today, \nthe entire Church and all Catholic faithful must urgently seek to be strengthened in the \ndoctrine and practice of the faith. In confronting the evil of abortion, more than ever \nCatholics must “abstain from all appearance of evil” (1 Thess. 5:22). Bodily health is not \nan absolute value. Obedience to the law of God and the eternal salvation of the souls \nmust be given primacy. Vaccines derived from the cells of cruelly murdered unborn \n\nEXHIBIT D\nchildren are clearly apocalyptic in character and may possibly foreshadow the mark of \nthe beast (see Rev. 13:16). \nSome churchmen in our day reassure the faithful by affirming that receiving a Covid-19 \nvaccine derived from the cell lines of an aborted child is morally licit if an alternative is \nnot available. They justify their assertion on the basis of “material and remote \ncooperation” with evil. Such affirmations are extremely anti-pastoral and \ncounterproductive, especially when one considers the increasingly apocalyptic character \nof the abortion industry, and the inhuman nature of some biomedical research and \nembryonic technology. Now more than ever, Catholics categorically cannot encourage \nand promote the sin of abortion, even in the slightest, by accepting these vaccines. \nTherefore, as Successors of the Apostles and Shepherds responsible for the eternal \nsalvation of souls, we consider it impossible to be silent and maintain an ambiguous \nattitude regarding our duty to resist with “maximum of determination” (Pope John Paul \nII) against the “unspeakable crime” of abortion (II Vatican Council, Gaudium et Spes, \n51). \nThis statement was written at the advice and counsel of doctors and scientists from \nvarious countries. A substantial contribution also came from the laity: from \ngrandmothers, grandfathers, fathers and mothers of families, and from young people. \nAll of those consulted — independent of age, nationality and profession — unanimously \nand almost instinctively rejected the idea of a vaccine derived from the cell lines of \naborted children. Furthermore, they considered the justification offered for using such \nvaccines (i.e. “material remote cooperation”) as weak and unsuitable. This is comforting \nand, at the same time, very revealing: their unanimous response is a further \ndemonstration of the strength of reason and the sensus fidei. \nMore than ever, we need the spirit of the confessors and martyrs who avoided the \nslightest suspicion of collaboration with the evil of their own age. The Word of God says: \n“Be simple as children of God without reproach in the midst of a depraved and perverse \ngeneration, in which you must shine like lights in the world” (Phil. 2, 15). \nDecember 12, 2020, Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Guadalupe \nCardinal Janis Pujats, Metropolitan archbishop emeritus of Riga \n+ Tomash Peta, Metropolitan archbishop of the archdiocese of Saint Mary in Astana \n+ Jan Pawel Lenga, Archbishop/bishop emeritus of Karaganda \n+ Joseph E.

Chesterton, What’s Wrong with the World\nWe the undersigned, men and women in solidarity with the weakest among us, wish to respond publicly to\nwhat appears to be a growing consensus among Catholic ethicists that vaccines derived from aborted fetal\ntissue are not only morally permissible (licit), but also (nearly) morally obligatory for the sake of the\ncommon good. Examples include, among others, this statement organized by EPPC, the steady position of\nthe Catholic Health Association (CHA), and a December statement of the USCCB which says that\nreceiving the (abortion-tainted) COVID-19 vaccine “should be considered...part of our moral\nresponsibility for the common good.” These statements are troubling to us, and seem to run afoul of our\nrights of conscience to refuse such vaccines, clearly defended by the Church, in Dignitas Personae (CDF\n2008) and Note on the morality of using some Covid-19 vaccines (CDF 2020). We now fear the circling of\nthe wagons around abortion-tainted vaccines, advanced by powerful voices which seem ready to silence\nour moral intuitions. \nWe resist this “consensus” being foisted upon us as morally repugnant: we do not wish to benefit from\nabortion. We deplore the lack of moral imagination displayed by public health officials, politicians, and all\nthose who disregard the natural disgust felt by persons who wish to remain separate from the crime of\nabortion in every way possible. And we lament a “soulless scientism” that fails to account for the unique\ndignity of the human person and the role of suffering in human life.\nWe are puzzled and pained by the lack of reasonable skepticism which pro-life persons ought to show for\n1 of 7 9/10/2021, 4:57 PM\n\nStatement of Conscience, to Awaken Conscience https://mailchi.mp/7742dd12483f/statement-of-conscience-to-awaken-co...\nEXHIBIT D\nthe scientific-industrial complex (SIC). A distortion of medical and scientific standards so often\naccompanies questionable ethical practices, and a “science” which denies life inevitably takes life.\nConsequently, there are many reasons why a person may feel duty-bound to avoid these vaccines besides\nreligious conviction, such as the experimental nature of them (FDA “emergency use”) and the unknown\neffects, especially on children and pregnant women. \nWe hereby urge, by our witness and testimony, that people who agree with us—and also those who\ndisagree but who admire our stance, and who wish to defend our right to hold it—join together to claim\nthe freedom in conscience to refuse vaccines derived from aborted fetal cell lines.\n“There is a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with\nregard to those which have moral problems,” wrote the Pontifical Academy for Life in 2005, in guidance\nconfirmed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; abortion-tainted vaccines create a ”context of\nmoral coercion of the conscience of parents, who are forced to choose to act against their conscience.”\nIndeed, many of us have spent decades trying to resist the abortion-tainted varicella and MMR vaccines,\nwhich were produced in the same compromised way, meeting resistance everywhere, being ‘fired’ by our\nphysicians, and opposed even by leaders of our own churches. Many Catholic schools even require\nstudents to obtain the morally objectionable vaccines in order to attend.\nThese failures make us now question whether earlier capitulations (on the grounds that there was ‘no\nalternative’) were the right courses of action. The threats grow by the moment. Even now, there is pending\nlegislation which would allow children the right to consent to vaccines without parental knowledge. Such\na policy has implications far beyond the present crisis. We wish to call attention to the unintended\nconsequences of a ‘soft opposition’ of words and not of deeds. Coercion in these and other matters hostile\nto life is coming.   \nWe are told there is nearly ubiquitous use of HEK-293 cells in the scientific and medical industry. If this is\nso, we take it to be evidence of structures of sin surrounding abortion. We invite (and call upon our\nlawmakers to require) all product manufacturers to reveal publicly and label their use of these cells, so that\nwe can go forward avoiding such products. More has been done to resist animal cruelty and the use of\ngenetically modified organisms than to resist the benefiting from the murder of a child. (The very same\npapers which report tests of vaccines using HEK-293 cells take pains in their disclosures to say that no\nanimals were mistreated in the course of their research!) We lament that we have been led to use\ncompromised products and medicines in the past without knowledge. Let all that has been hidden be\nbrought into the light. \nWe find insufficient the accounts of moralists who lean on casuistical distinctions, originally designed to\nanalyze private action in a Christian society, when we are crushed by a public edifice determined to\nprotect the so-called ‘right to abortion’, and determined in addition to benefit from its byproducts in many\nways beyond the current (and previous) vaccines. We know that trafficking in aborted fetal body parts\nexists and amounts to an industry. The acceptance of the use of tissues derived in the past does have\nimplications for incentivizing this industry.

The march of\nscience, the treatments it pursues, the political incentives it responds to, none of them are immune from\nmoral witness. Without our courage we fear that pinches of incense will continue to be extracted from us,\nrendering us insensitive to what should cause our indignation, sorrow, and determination to change. \nThe abortions from which the cell lines are derived are said to be so “remote” as to be like roads\nconstructed by slave laborers hundreds of years ago. Surely remoteness is a judgment in conscience. How\n“remote” is a cell line connected by continuous life with the murdered child? How “remotely” long ago is\nthe abortion of a child who would be only 50 years old today? It is urged, as if it mattered, that the\nabortions were not carried out in order to create the cell lines—and yet the tissue of the aborted child\n(which no lab scientist had authority to use) did not miraculously give rise to cell lines but instead was\nmanipulated deliberately, precisely in order to create the cell lines. Therefore, the use of these cell lines\nexactly corresponds to and complements the depraved intention to create them.\n“Protect unborn man from born man!” St. John Paul II exhorted us. We live in a world divided into a Way\nof Life and a Way of Death. The Way of Death is this: born man subordinates unborn man to himself, for\nhis own advantage. The Way of Life is this: born man unwaveringly and resolutely protects unborn man,\neven to his own disadvantage. To which culture do we wish to belong? With which do we identify? “What\ndoes it profit a man to gain his life but lose his soul?”\nWe therefore urge our ethicists to resist a premature “consensus” about abortion-tainted SARS-CoV-2\nvaccines.

And we urge a public reckoning as regards every secret use of these cells derived from an\nabortion. \nWe reiterate in closing: even if, as a matter of general principles, it is not always morally illicit to use such\nabortion-tainted vaccines temporarily, in extreme necessity, and even then under strenuous protest, the use\nof such vaccines must never be advanced as mandatory, or as a universal duty.

In recent months, this Congregation has received several requests for guidance regarding the use\nof vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, which, in the course of research and\nproduction, employed cell lines drawn from tissue obtained from two abortions that occurred in the last\ncentury. At the same time, diverse and sometimes conflicting pronouncements in the mass media by\nbishops, Catholic associations, and experts have raised questions about the morality of the use of these\nvaccines.\nThere is already an important pronouncement of the Pontifical Academy for Life on this issue, entitled\n“Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human fetuses” (5 June 2005).\nFurther, this Congregation expressed itself on the matter with the Instruction Dignitas Personae\n(September 8, 2008, cf. nn. 34 and 35). In 2017, the Pontifical Academy for Life returned to the topic\nwith a Note. These documents already offer some general directive criteria.\nSince the first vaccines against Covid-19 are already available for distribution and administration in\nvarious countries, this Congregation desires to offer some indications for clarification of this matter. We\ndo not intend to judge the safety and efficacy of these vaccines, although ethically relevant and necessary,\nas this evaluation is the responsibility of biomedical researchers and drug agencies. Here, our objective is\nonly to consider the moral aspects of the use of the vaccines against Covid-19 that have been developed\nfrom cell lines derived from tissues obtained from two fetuses that were not spontaneously aborted.\n1. As the Instruction Dignitas Personae states, in cases where cells from aborted fetuses are employed to\ncreate cell lines for use in scientific research, “there exist differing degrees of responsibility”[1] of\ncooperation in evil. For example,“in organizations where cell lines of illicit origin are being utilized, the\nresponsibility of those who make the decision to use them is not the same as that of those who have no\nvoice in such a decision”.[2]\n2. In this sense, when ethically irreproachable Covid-19 vaccines are not available (e.g. in countries\nwhere vaccines without ethical problems are not made available to physicians and patients, or where their\ndistribution is more difficult due to special storage and transport conditions, or when various types of\nvaccines are distributed in the same country but health authorities do not allow citizens to choose the\nvaccine with which to be inoculated) it is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used\ncell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process.\n3. The fundamental reason for considering the use of these vaccines morally licit is that the kind of\n1 of 3 9/10/2021, 5:11 PM\n\nFirefox https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_...\nEXHIBIT D\ncooperation in evil (passive material cooperation) in the procured abortion from which these cell lines\noriginate is, on the part of those making use of the resulting vaccines, remote. The moral duty to avoid\nsuch passive material cooperation is not obligatory if there is a grave danger, such as the otherwise\nuncontainable spread of a serious pathological agent[3]--in this case, the pandemic spread of the SARS-\nCoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. It must therefore be considered that, in such a case, all vaccinations\nrecognized as clinically safe and effective can be used in good conscience with the certain knowledge that\nthe use of such vaccines does not constitute formal cooperation with the abortion from which the cells\nused in production of the vaccines derive. It should be emphasized, however, that the morally licit use of\nthese types of vaccines, in the particular conditions that make it so, does not in itself constitute a\nlegitimation, even indirect, of the practice of abortion, and necessarily assumes the opposition to this\npractice by those who make use of these vaccines.\n4. In fact, the licit use of such vaccines does not and should not in any way imply that there is a moral\nendorsement of the use of cell lines proceeding from aborted fetuses.[4] Both pharmaceutical companies\nand governmental health agencies are therefore encouraged to produce, approve, distribute and offer\nethically acceptable vaccines that do not create problems of conscience for either health care providers or\nthe people to be vaccinated.\n5. At the same time, practical reason makes evident that vaccination is not, as a rule, a moral obligation\nand that, therefore, it must be voluntary. In any case, from the ethical point of view, the morality of\nvaccination depends not only on the duty to protect one's own health, but also on the duty to pursue the\ncommon good. In the absence of other means to stop or even prevent the epidemic, the common good\nmay recommend vaccination, especially to protect the weakest and most exposed. Those who, however,\nfor reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines produced with cell lines from aborted fetuses, must do their\nutmost to avoid, by other prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the\ntransmission of the infectious agent. In particular, they must avoid any risk to the health of those who\ncannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons, and who are the most vulnerable.\n6. Finally, there is also a moral imperative for the pharmaceutical industry, governments and international\norganizations to ensure that vaccines, which are effective and safe from a medical point of view, as well as\nethically acceptable, are also accessible to the poorest countries in a manner that is not costly for them.\nThe lack of access to vaccines, otherwise, would become another sign of discrimination and injustice that\ncondemns poor countries to continue living in health, economic and social poverty.[5]\nThe Sovereign Pontiff Francis, at the Audience granted to the undersigned Prefect of the Congregation\nfor the Doctrine of the Faith, on 17 December 2020, examined the present Note and ordered its\npublication.\nRome, from the Offices of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, on 21 December 2020,\nLiturgical Memorial of Saint Peter Canisius.\nLuis F.

Immune cells and proteins that circulate in\nthe body can recognize and kill the pathogen if it’s encountered\nagain, protecting against disease and reducing illness severity.\nThis long-term immune protection involves several components.\nAntibodies—proteins that circulate in the blood—recognize foreign\nsubstances like viruses and neutralize them. Different types of T cells\nhelp recognize and kill pathogens. B cells make new antibodies when\nthe body needs them.\nAll of these immune-system components have been found in people\nwho recover from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But\nthe details of this immune response and how long it lasts after\ninfection have been unclear. Scattered reports of reinfection with\nSARS-CoV-2 have raised concerns that the immune response to the\nvirus might not be durable.\nColorized scanning electron micrograph of a cell, isolated from a patient\nTo better understand immune memory of SARS-CoV-2, researchers\nsample, that is heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (red).\nled by Drs.

Antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,\nwhich the virus uses to get inside cells, were found in 98% of participants one month after symptom onset. As seen in previous studies, the\nnumber of antibodies ranged widely between individuals. But, promisingly, their levels remained fairly stable over time, declining only\nmodestly at 6 to 8 months after infection.\nVirus-specific B cells increased over time. People had more memory B cells six months after symptom onset than at one month afterwards.\nAlthough the number of these cells appeared to reach a plateau after a few months, levels didn’t decline over the period studied.\nLevels of T cells for the virus also remained high after infection. Six months after symptom onset, 92% of participants had CD4+ T cells that\nrecognized the virus. These cells help coordinate the immune response. About half the participants had CD8+ T cells, which kill cells that are\ninfected by the virus.\nAs with antibodies, the numbers of different immune cell types varied substantially between individuals. Neither gender nor differences in\ndisease severity could account for this variability. However, 95% of the people had at least 3 out of 5 immune-system components that\ncould recognize SARS-CoV-2 up to 8 months after infection.\n“Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses\nlast,” Weiskopf says. “We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-induced\nresponses.”\n—by Sharon Reynolds\nRelated Links\n• Experimental Coronavirus Vaccine Highly Effective (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/experimental-\ncoronavirus-vaccine-highly-effective)\n• Antibodies and T Cells Protect Against SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells-\nprotect-against-sars-cov-2)\n• Immune Cells for Common Cold May Recognize SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-cells-\ncommon-cold-may-recognize-sars-cov-2)\n• Potent Neutralizing Antibodies Target New Regions of Coronavirus Spike (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters\n/potent-neutralizing-antibodies-target-new-regions-coronavirus-spike)\n• Potent Antibodies Found in People Recovered from COVID-19 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/potent-\nantibodies-found-people-recovered-covid-19)\n• Novel Coronavirus Structure Reveals Targets for Vaccines and Treatments (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters\n/novel-coronavirus-structure-reveals-targets-vaccines-treatments)\n• Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://covid19.nih.gov/)\n• Coronavirus Prevention Network (https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/)\n• Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://www.coronavirus.gov/)\nReferences: Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection.

They concluded, \"In COVID-19 patients, immune responses \nwere characterized by a highly augmented interferon response which was largely absent in \nvaccine recipients. Increased interferon signaling likely contributed to the observed dramatic \nupregulation of cytotoxic genes in the peripheral T cells and innate-like lymphocytes in patients \nbut not in immunized subjects.\" \nThe study further notes: \"Analysis of B and T cell receptor repertoires revealed that while the \nmajority of clonal B and T cells in COVID-19 patients were effector cells, in vaccine recipients \nclonally expanded cells were primarily circulating memory cells.\" What this means in plain \nEnglish is that effector cells trigger an innate response that is quicker and more durable, whereas \nmemory response requires an adaptive mode that is slower to respond. Natural immunity \nconveys much more innate immunity, while the vaccine mainly stimulates adaptive immunity. \n2) Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, May 24, 2021, published in Nature \nThe media scared people last year into thinking that if antibody levels wane, it means their \nimmunity is weakening, as we are indeed seeing with the vaccines today. But as Nature wrote, \n\"People who recover [even] from mild COVID-19 have bone-marrow cells that can churn out \nantibodies for decades.\" Thus, aside from the robust T-cell memory that is likely lacking from \nmost or all vaccinated individuals, prior infection creates memory B cells that \"patrol the blood \nfor reinfection, while bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) hide away in bones, trickling out \nantibodies for decades\" as needed. \nIt's therefore not surprising that early on in the pandemic, an in-vitro study in Singapore found \nthe immunity against SARS-CoV-2 to last even 17 years later from SARS-1-infected patients \nwho never even had COVID-19. \n3) Cleveland Clinic, June 19, 2021 \nIn a study of 1,359 previously infected health care workers in the Cleveland Clinic system, not a \nsingle one of them was reinfected 10 months into the pandemic, despite some of these \nindividuals being around COVID-positive patients more than the regular population. \nPage 4\n\n4) Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle/Emory University, Washington, July 14, \n2021, published in Cell Medicine \nThe study found that most recovered patients produced durable antibodies, memory B cells, and \ndurable polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells, which target multiple parts of the virus. \"Taken \ntogether, these results suggest that broad and effective immunity may persist long-term in \nrecovered COVID-19 patients,\" concluded the authors. In other words, unlike with the vaccines, \nno boosters are required to assist natural immunity. \n5) University of California, Irvine, July 21, 2021 \nThe authors conclude: \"Natural infection induced expansion of larger CD8 T cell clones \noccupied distinct clusters, likely due to the recognition of a broader set of viral epitopes \npresented by the virus not seen in the mRNA vaccine\" (emphasis added). \n6) University of California, San Francisco, May 12, 2021 \nConclusion: \"In infection-naïve individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity but not quality \nof the T cell response, while in convalescents the second dose helped neither. Spike-specific T \ncells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees, \nwith phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the \nrespiratory tract including the nasopharynx.\" \nGiven that we know the virus spreads through the nasopharynx, the fact that natural infection \nconveys much stronger mucosal immunity makes it clear that the previously infected are much \nsafer to be around than infection-naive people with the vaccine. The fact that this study artfully \ncouched the choices between vaccinated naive people and vaccinated recovered rather than just \nplain recovered doesn't change the fact that it's the prior infection, not the vaccine, conveying \nmucosal immunity. In fact, studies now show that infected vaccinated people contain just as \nmuch viral load in their nasopharynx as those unvaccinated, a clearly unmistakable conclusion \nfrom the virus spreading wildly in many areas with nearly every adult vaccinated. \n7) Israeli researchers, August 22, 2021 \nAside from more robust T cell and memory B cell immunity, which is more important than \nantibody levels, Israeli researchers found that antibodies wane slower among those with prior \ninfection. \"In vaccinated subjects, antibody titers decreased by up to 40% each subsequent month \nwhile in convalescents they decreased by less than 5% per month.\" \n8) Irish researchers, published in Wiley Review, May 18, 2021 \nResearchers conducted a review of 11 cohort studies with over 600,000 total recovered COVID \npatients who were followed up with over 10 months. The key finding? Unlike the vaccine, after \nabout four to six months, they found \"no study reporting an increase in the risk of reinfection \nover time.\"  \n \n \nPage 5\n\n9) Cornell University, Doha, Qatar, published in the Lancet, April 27, 2021 \nThis is one of the only studies that analyzed the population‐level risk of reinfection based on \nwhole genome sequencing in a subset of patients with supporting evidence of reinfection. \nResearchers estimate the risk at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks. Most importantly, the study \nfound no evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of the follow-up period. The \nfew reinfections that did occur \"were less severe than primary infections,\" and \"only one \nreinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal.\" Also, unlike many \nvaccinated breakthrough infections in recent weeks that have been very symptomatic, \"most \nreinfections were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact \ntracing.\" \n10) Israeli researchers, April 24, 2021 \nSeveral months ago, Israeli researchers studied 6.3 million Israelis and their COVID status and \nwere able to confirm only one death in the entire country of someone who supposedly already \nhad the virus, and he was over 80 years old. Contrast that to the torrent of hospitalizations and \ndeaths we are seeing in those vaccinated more than five months ago in Israel. \n11) French researchers, May 11, 2021 \nResearchers tested blood samples from health care workers who never had the virus but got both \nPfizer shots against blood samples from those health care workers who had a previous mild \ninfection and a third group of patients who had a serious case of COVID. They found, \"No \nneutralization escape could be feared concerning the two variants of concern [Alpha and Beta] in \nboth populations\" of those previously infected. \n12) Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, published in Journal of Experimental Medicine \nMany people are wondering: If they got only an asymptomatic infection, are they less protected \nagainst future infection than those who suffered infection with more evident symptoms? These \nresearchers believe the opposite is true. \"Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals are \nnot characterized by weak antiviral immunity; on the contrary, they mount a highly functional \nvirus-specific cellular immune response,\" wrote the authors after studying T cell responses from \nboth symptomatic and asymptomatic convalescent patients. If anything, they found that those \nwith asymptomatic infection only had signs of non-inflammatory cytokines, which means that \nthe body is primed to deal with the virus without producing that dangerous inflammatory \nresponse that is killing so many hospitalized with the virus.  \n13) Korean researchers, published in Nature Communications on June 30, 2021 \nThe authors found that the T cells created from convalescent patients had \"stem-cell like\" \nqualities. After studying SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells in recovered patients who had \nthe virus in varying degrees of severity, the authors concluded that long-term \"SARS-CoV-2-\nspecific T cell memory is successfully maintained regardless of the severity of COVID-19.\" \n   \nPage 6\n\n14) Rockefeller University, July 29, 2021 \nThe researchers note that far from suffering waning immunity, memory B cells in those with \nprior infection \"express increasingly broad and potent antibodies that are resistant to mutations \nfound in variants of concern.\" They conclude that \"memory antibodies selected over time by \nnatural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination.\" And \nagain, this is even before getting into the innate cellular immunity which is exponentially greater \nin those with natural immunity.  \n15) Researchers from Madrid and Mount Sinai, New York, March 22, 2021 \nUntil now, we have established that natural immunity provides better adaptive B cell and innate \nT cell responses that last longer and work for the variants as compared to the vaccines. \nMoreover, those with prior infection are at greater risk for bad side effects from the vaccines, \nrendering the campaign to vaccinate the previously infected both unnecessary and dangerous. \nBut the final question is: Do the vaccines possibly harm the superior T cell immunity built up \nfrom prior infection?  \n* Vaccinations appear to have detrimental impact on pre-existing immunity \nImmunologists from Mount Sinai in New York and Hospital La Paz in M  adrid have raised \nserious concerns. In a shocking discovery after monitoring a group of vaccinated people both \nwith and without prior infection, they found \"in individuals with a pre-existing immunity against \nSARS-CoV-2, the second vaccine dose not only fail to boost humoral immunity but determines a \ncontraction of the spike-specific T cell response.\" They also note that other research has shown \n\"the second vaccination dose appears to exert a detrimental effect in the overall magnitude of the \nspike-specific humoral response in COVID-19 recovered individuals.\"  \nAs early as March 27, among the many accurate statements Dr. Fauci made before he became a \npolitical animal, he declared he was \"really confident\" in the immunity conferred by prior \ninfection. That was long before 17 months of data and dozens of studies confirmed that. Yet, \ntoday, there are thousands of doctors and nurses with infinitely better immunity than what the \nvaccines can confer who are losing their jobs during a staffing crisis for not getting the shots. \nJust know that the big lie about natural immunity is perhaps the most verifiable lie, but it is likely \nnot the only lie with devastating consequences we are being told about the virus, the vaccines, \nand alternative treatment options. \n \nPage 7\n\nHarvard Epidemiologist Says the Case for COVID Vaccine Passports Wa... https://fee.org/articles/harvard-epidemiologist-says-the-case-for-covid-va...\nHarvard Epidemiologist Says the Case for COVID\nVaccine Passports Was Just Demolished\nNew research found that natural immunity offers exponentially more\nprotection than COVID-19 vaccines.\nMonday, August 30, 2021\nPhoto by Thérèse Soukar, CC BY-SA 4.0 , via Wikimedia Commons\nJon Miltimore\nPolitics Vaccine Passport Vaccines Natural Immunity COVID-19\nFreedom of Movement CDC Israel\nA\nnewly published medical study found that infection from COVID-19\nconfers considerably longer-lasting and stronger protection against\nthe Delta variant of the virus than vaccines.\n“The natural immune protection that develops after a SARS-CoV-2 infection\nPage 8\n1 of 6 9/11/2021, 10:46 PM\n\nHarvard Epidemiologist Says the Case for COVID Vaccine Passports Wa... https://fee.org/articles/harvard-epidemiologist-says-the-case-for-covid-va...\noffers considerably more of a shield against the Delta variant of the\npandemic coronavirus than two doses of the P�zer-BioNTech vaccine,\naccording to a large Israeli study that some scientists wish came with a\n‘Don’t try this at home’ label,” Science reported Thursday. “The newly\nreleased data show people who once had a SARS-CoV-2 infection were\nmuch less likely than vaccinated people to get Delta, develop symptoms\nfrom it, or become hospitalized with serious COVID-19.”\nPut another way, vaccinated individuals were 27 times more likely to get a\nsymptomatic COVID infection than those with natural immunity from\nCOVID.\nMartin Kulldorff\n@MartinKulldorff\nIn Israel, vaccinated individuals had 27 times higher risk of \nsymptomatic COVID infection compared to those with \nnatural immunity from prior COVID disease [95%CI:13-57, \nadjusted for time of vaccine/disease].

for recovered SARS-CoV-2\npatients in receiving vaccines against the coronavirus.\nAccording to the study, conducted in Cleveland, Ohio and published in the MedRxiv journal last month, people who were infected with the\ncoronavirus enjoy significant long-term immunity from the virus, which is unlikely to be increased by being injected with one of the\ncoronavirus vaccinations now on the market.\nThe study followed 52,238 employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System, monitoring infections among vaccinated and unvaccinated\nworkers, and the incidents of reinfection among both vaccinated and unvaccinated workers.\nOf the 52,238 employees tracked in the study, 2,579 had previously tested positive for the coronavirus, while 49,659 had never been\nconfirmed as carrying the virus.\nFifty-three percent of the 2,579 employees who had been infected with the virus previously remained unvaccinated (1,359 people), compared\nto 41% (22,777) of the employees who were never diagnosed with the virus.\nZero previously infected employees were reported to have become infected again with the virus, regardless of their vaccination status.\nVaccination significantly reduced the risk of coronavirus infection, the study found, but only among those who had not previously been\ninfected.\nThe authors concluded that vaccination after natural infection is unlikely to have any benefit for recovered COVID patients.\n“Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to\nthose who have not been infected before.”\nPrevious studies in Israel and Qatar have found extremely low levels of reinfection among recovered coronavirus patients.\nMore recent data collected by the Israeli Health Ministry in the midst of outbreaks of the Delta Variant found that there were far fewer cases of\nreinfection after natural infection than there were infections among vaccinated Israelis who had never been diagnosed with the virus\npreviously.\nWith a total of 835,792 Israelis known to have recovered from the virus, the 72 instances of reinfection amount to 0.0086% of people who\nwere already infected with COVID.\nBy contrast, Israelis who were vaccinated were 6.72 times more likely to get infected after the shot than after natural infection, with over\n3,000 of the 5,193,499, or 0.0578%, of Israelis who were vaccinated getting infected in the latest wave.\nwww.israelnationalnews.com Arutz Sheva\nyour Israel news site\nArutz Sheva, your Israel news site\nPage 15\n2 of 2 9/11/2021, 2:38

Employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the \nday COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 \nat least 42 days earlier was considered previously infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after \nreceipt of the second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection over the next five months, among previously infected subjects who received the vaccine, was \ncompared with those of previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected \nsubjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. \nResults.   Among the 52238 included employees, 1359 (53%) of 2579 previously infected subjects \nremained unvaccinated, compared with 20804 (42%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative \nincidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained almost zero among previously infected unvaccinated \nsubjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and previously uninfected subjects who were \nvaccinated, compared with a steady increase in cumulative incidence among previously uninfected \nsubjects who remained unvaccinated. Not one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained \nunvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. In a Cox proportional hazards \nregression model, after adjusting for the phase of the epidemic, vaccination was associated with a \nsignificantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among those not previously infected (HR 0.031, 95% \nCI 0.015 to 0.061) but not among those previously infected (HR 0.313, 95% CI 0 to Infinity). \nConclusions.   Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 \nvaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before. \n   \n2 \n \nPage 39\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe two FDA-approved (BNT162b2 mRNA [Pfizer-BioNTech] and mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) \nmRNA vaccines have been shown to be very efficacious in protecting against Severe Acute Respiratory \nSyndrome (SARS) – associated Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection [1,2]. The effectiveness of the \nPfizer-BioNTech vaccine in a real-world setting has also been shown to be comparable to the efficacy \ndemonstrated in clinical trials [3,4]. Given these, there has been an understandable desire to vaccinate as \nmany people as possible. \nThe ability to vaccinate a large part of the population is limited by the supply of vaccine. As of \nMarch 21, 2021, 78% of 447 million doses of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that \nhad been deployed had gone to only ten countries [5]. The COVAX initiative was borne out of the \nrecognition that equitable distribution of vaccines worldwide was essential for effective control of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. However, the reality is that there is great disparity in the availability of vaccines \nacross countries. Countries with limited supplies of vaccine have to prioritize how their supply of \nvaccines will be allocated within their populations. Criteria used for such prioritization have included \nprofession, age, and comorbid conditions. Data that inform prioritization criteria with help maximize the \nbenefits of whatever vaccine is available. \nObservational studies have found very low rates of reinfection among individuals with prior \nSARS-CoV-2 infection [6–8]. This brings up the question about whether it is necessary to vaccinate \npreviously infected individuals. These studies notwithstanding, there remains a theoretical possibility that \nthe vaccine may still provide some benefit in previously infected persons. A prior large observational \nstudy concluded that immunity from natural infection cannot be relied on to provide adequate protection \nand advocated for vaccination of previously infected individuals [9]. The CDC website recommends that \npersons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 still get the vaccine [10]. Despite these recommendations, \ncredible reports of previously infected persons getting COVID-19 are rare. The rationale often provided \nfor getting the COVID-19 vaccine is that it is safer to get vaccinated than to get the disease. This is \n3 \n \nPage 40\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \ncertainly true, but it is not an explanation for why people who have already had the disease need to be \nvaccinated. A strong case for vaccinating previously infected persons can be made if it can be shown that \npreviously infected persons who are vaccinated have a lower incidence of COVID-19 than previously \ninfected persons who did not receive the vaccine. \nThe purpose of this study was to attempt to do just that, and thereby evaluate the necessity of the \nCOVID-19 vaccine in persons who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. \n \n \n4 \n \nPage 41\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \nMETHODS \nStudy design \nThis was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio, \nUSA. The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. A waiver of informed \nconsent and waiver of HIPAA authorization were approved to allow access to personal health information \nby the research team, with the understanding that sharing or releasing identifiable data to anyone other \nthan the study team was not permitted without additional IRB approval. \n \nSetting \nPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 at Cleveland Clinic began on March 12, 2020, and a streamlined \nprocess dedicated to the testing of health care personnel (HCP) was begun shortly thereafter. All \nemployees with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were interviewed by Occupational Health, with date of onset \nof symptoms of COVID-19 being one of the questions asked. Vaccination for COVID-19 began at \nCleveland Clinic on December 16, 2020. When initially started it was the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that \nwas administered, until the Moderna vaccine became available, from which time employees received one \nor the other. All employees were scheduled to receive their second vaccine dose 28 days after the first \none, regardless of which vaccine was given. The employee cohort was chosen for this study because of \ndocumentation of their COVID-19 vaccination and of any SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Occupational \nHealth database.  \n \nParticipants \nAll employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System, working in Ohio, on Dec 16, 2020, were \nscreened for inclusion in the study. Those who were in employment on December 16, 2020, were \nincluded.  \n5 \n \nPage 42\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \n \nVariables \nSARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive nucleic acid amplification test. The date of \ninfection was taken to be the date of onset of symptoms when available, and the date of specimen \ncollection when not. A person was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the second dose of the \nvaccine (which would have been 42 days after receipt of the first dose of the vaccine for most subjects). \nFor the sake of consistency in the duration assumed for development of natural and vaccine immunity, \nany person who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days before the vaccine rollout date, was \nconsidered previously infected. Other covariates collected were age, job location, job type (patient-facing \nor non-patient facing), and job category. The job location variable could be one of the following: \nCleveland Clinic Main Campus, regional hospital (within Ohio), ambulatory center, administrative center, \nor remote location. The job category was one of the following: professional staff, residents/fellows, \nadvance practice practitioners, nursing, pharmacy, clinical support, research, administration, and \nadministration support. \n \nOutcome \nThe study outcome was time to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the latter defined as a positive nucleic \nacid amplification test for SARS-CoV-2 on or after December 16, 2020. Time to SARS-CoV-2 infection \nwas calculated as number of days from December 16, 2020 (vaccine rollout date) to SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection. For those with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection positive tests within 90 days of the first positive \ntest were considered part of the initial episode of illness. Employees that had not developed a SARS-\nCoV-2 infection were censored at the end of the study follow-up period (May 15, 2021). Those who \nreceived the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (81 subjects) without having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection were \ncensored on the day of receipt of the vaccine, and those whose employment was terminated during the \nstudy period before they had SARS-CoV-2 infection (2245 subjects) were censored on the date of \n6 \n \nPage 43\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \ntermination of employment. The health system never had a requirement for asymptomatic employee test \nscreening. Most of the positive tests, therefore, would have been tests done to evaluate suspicious \nsymptoms. A small proportion would have been tests done as part of pre-operative or pre-procedural \nscreening. \n \nStatistical analysis \nA Simon-Makuch hazard plot [11] was created to compare the cumulative incidence of SARS-\nCoV-2 infection among previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, with those of previously \ninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and \npreviously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Previous infection was treated as a time-\nindependent covariate (SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 42 days before Dec 16, 2020), and vaccination (14 \ndays after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine) was treated as a time-dependent covariate (Figure 1). \nCurves for the unvaccinated were based on data for those who did not receive the vaccine over the \nduration of the study, and for those who did until the date they were considered vaccinated, from which \npoint onwards their data were recorded into the corresponding vaccinated set. A Cox proportional hazards \nregression model was fitted with time to SARS-CoV-2 infection as the outcome variable against \nvaccination (as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on the date a subject was considered \nvaccinated)[12]. Previous infection (as a time-independent covariate) and an interaction term for previous \ninfection and vaccination were included as covariates. The phase of the epidemic was adjusted for by \nincluding the slope of the epidemic curve as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed \ncontinuously with the slope of the epidemic curve. The analysis was performed by NKS and ASN using \nthe survival package and R version 4.0.5 [12–14].  \n \n \n7 \n \nPage 44\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \nRESULTS \nOf 52238 employees included in the study, 2579 (5%) were previously infected with SARS-CoV-\n2.  \n \nBaseline characteristics \nThose previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were significantly younger (mean ± SD age; 39 ± \n13 vs. 42 ± 13, p<0.001), and included a significantly higher proportion with patient-facing jobs (65% vs. \n51%, p<0.001). Table 1 shows the characteristics of subjects grouped by whether or not they were \npreviously infected. A significantly lower proportion of those previously infected (47%, 1220 subjects) \nwere vaccinated by the end of the study compared to 58% (28855) of those not previously infected \n(p<0.001). Of those vaccinated, 63% received the Moderna vaccine. Twelve percent of subjects with \nprevious SARS-CoV-2 infection did not have a symptom onset date, suggesting they may possibly have \nbeen identified on pre-operative or pre-procedural screening, and may not have had symptomatic \ninfection. When vaccination was begun, the epidemic in Ohio was at the peak of its third wave (Figure 2). \n \nCumulative incidence of COVID-19 \nFigure 3 is a Simon-Makuch plot showing that SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred almost \nexclusively in subjects who were not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who remained \nunvaccinated. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among previously infected \nunvaccinated subjects did not differ from that of previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and \nthat of previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated. For all three of these groups, the cumulative \nincidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was much lower than that of subjects who were not previously \ninfected and who remained unvaccinated.

Not \none of the 2579 previously infected subjects had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 1359 who remained \nunvaccinated throughout the duration of the study. \n \nAssociation of vaccination with occurrence of COVID-19  \nIn a Cox proportional hazards regression model, after adjusting for the phase of the epidemic, \nvaccination was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among those not \npreviously infected (HR 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 – 0.061) but not among those previously infected (HR \n0.313, 95% CI 0 – Infinity). The absence of events among those who were previously infected, whether \nthey received the vaccine or not, precluded accurate or precise estimates for the latter effect size.  \n \nDuration of protection \nThis study was not specifically designed to determine the duration of protection afforded by \nnatural infection, but for the previously infected subjects the median duration since prior infection was \n143 days (IQR 76 – 179 days), and no one had SARS-CoV-2 infection over the following five months, \nsuggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide protection against reinfection for 10 months or \nlonger.  \n \n   \n9 \n \nPage 46\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \nDISCUSSION \nThis study shows that subjects previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to get COVID-\n19 reinfection whether or not they receive the vaccine. This finding calls into question the necessity to \nvaccinate those who have already had SARS-CoV-2 infection. \nIt is reasonable to expect that immunity acquired by natural infection provides effective \nprotection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. Observational studies have indeed found very low \nrates of reinfection over the following months among survivors of COVID-19 [6–8]. Reports of true \nreinfections are extremely rare in the absence of emergence of new variants. When such reinfections \noccur, it would be purely speculative to suggest that a vaccine might have prevented them. Duration of \nprotective immunity from natural infection is not known. However, the same also can be said about \nduration of protective immunity from vaccination. Uncertainty about the duration of protective immunity \nafforded by natural infection is not by itself a valid argument for vaccinating previously infected \nindividuals. This study provides direct evidence that vaccination with the best available vaccines does not \nprovide additional protection in previously infected individuals. \nA prior study concluded that natural infection cannot be relied on to protect against COVID-19 \n[9]. That study was based on comparison of PCR-positivity rates during a second COVID-19 surge in \nDenmark between those who tested positive and negative during the first COVID-19 surge, and indirectly \ncalculated that prior infection provided 80.5% protection against repeat infection, and that protection \nagainst those older than 65 years was only 47.1%. The study did not compare vaccinated and \nunvaccinated people, and it is therefore an assumption to consider that a vaccine would have provided \nbetter protection in that particular population. Furthermore, there was a gap of only seven weeks between \nthe end of the first surge and the beginning of the second in that study. It is now well-known that a small \nnumber of people can continue to have positive PCR test results for several weeks to a few months after \ninfection, one study finding that 5.3% remained positive at 90 days [15]. It is possible that some of the \npositives picked up in the early part of the second surge were not necessarily new infections but residual \n10 \n \nPage 47\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \nvirus from the tail end of the first surge. Since the actual number of infections was small, a few such \nmisclassifications could change the rates substantially. Our study examined rates of SARS-CoV-2 \ninfection in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and showed that those previously infected who did \nnot receive the vaccine did not have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than those previously infected \nwho did, thereby providing direct evidence that vaccination does not add protection to those who were \npreviously infected.  \nThere are several strengths to our study. Its large sample size and follow-up of up to 5 months \nprovide us with an ample degree of confidence in its findings. A major strength of our study is that we \nadjusted the analyses for the phase of the epidemic at all time points. The risk of acquisition of infection \nis strongly influenced by the phase of the epidemic at any given time, and it is important to adjust for this \nfor accurate risk analyses. Given that was this a study among employees of a health system, and that the \nhealth system had policies and procedures in recognition of the critical importance of keeping track of the \npandemic among its employees, we had an accurate accounting of who had COVID-19, when they were \ndiagnosed with COVID-19, who received a COVID-19 vaccine, and when they received it.  \nThe study has its limitations. Because we did not have a policy of asymptomatic employee \nscreening, previously infected subjects who remained asymptomatic might have been misclassified as \npreviously uninfected. Given this limitation, one should be cautious about drawing conclusions about the \nprotective effect of prior asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should be noted though, that 12% of \nthe subjects classified as previously infected did not have a symptom onset date recorded, suggesting that \nat least some of those classified as previously infected might have been asymptomatic infections. It is \nreassuring that none of these possibly asymptomatically infected individuals developed COVID-19 during \nthe duration of the study. The study follow-up duration was short, being only five months, but this was \nlonger than published mRNA vaccine efficacy studies [1,2], and longer than the follow-up duration of the \nlargest published vaccine effectiveness studies to date [3,4]. Median freedom from reinfection (time from \ninitial infection until end of follow-up) in this study, for those previously infected, of almost 10 months, is \nconsistent with findings in an earlier study that immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the spike protein remained \n11 \n \nPage 48\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

EXHIBIT E\n \nstable over more than six months after an episode of infection [16]. Our study included no children and \nfew elderly subjects, and the majority would not have been immunosuppressed. Data governance policies \nin our institution precluded us from obtaining detailed clinical information on employees. While one \ncannot generalize this study’s findings to assume that prior infection would provide adequate immunity in \nthese groups, there is also no reason to expect a vaccine to provide additional protection in these same \ngroups. Lastly, it is necessary to emphasize that these findings are based on the prevailing assortment of \nvirus variants in the community during the study. It is not known how well these results will hold if or \nwhen some of the newer variants of concern become prominent. However, if prior infection does not \nafford protection against some of the newer variants of concern, there is little reason to suppose that the \ncurrently available vaccines would either. Vaccine breakthrough infections with variants have indeed \nbeen reported [17]. \nOur study’s findings have important implications. Worldwide, COVID-19 vaccines are still in \nshort supply. As of March 9, 2021, dozens of countries had not been able to administer a single dose of \nthe vaccine [18]. As of May 17, 2021, only 17 countries had been able to reach ten percent or more of \ntheir populations with at least the first dose of vaccine [19]. Given such a scarcity of the vaccine, and the \nknowledge that vaccine does not provide additional protection to those previously infected, it would make \nmost sense to limit vaccine administration to those who have not previously had the infection. In addition \nto profession, age, and comorbid conditions, previous infection should be an important consideration in \ndeciding whom to prioritize to receive the vaccine. A practical and useful message would be to consider \nsymptomatic COVID-19 to be as good as having received a vaccine, and that people who have had \nCOVID-19 confirmed by a reliable laboratory test do not need the vaccine.  \nIn conclusion, individuals who have laboratory-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection \nare unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who \nhave not been infected before.  \n12 \n \nPage 49\n\nmedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176; this version posted June 19, 2021.

Dr. Walensky, thank you so much for joining us. We're grateful to you for helping our viewers\nappreciate what's going on.\nYou announced today that the CDC reported more than 103,000 new coronavirus cases just yesterday. What, six\nweeks ago, they were averaging about 11,000 or 12,000 cases a day, now more than 100,000 cases a day. What\nis the outlook right now? What are the next few weeks and months going to hold, because as you know, Dr.\nWalensky, a lot of nervous people out there, not just the unvaccinated but the vaccinated as well?\nWALENSKY: Good evening, Wolf.\n[18:05:00]\nYou know, what we're seeing in our projections demonstrates two different extremes. If we work together, unify\nas a country, vaccinate everyone who is interested in unvaccinated and put our masks on to prevent disease, we\ncould really control this in a matter of weeks. However, our models show that if we don't do so, we could be up\nto several hundred thousand cases a day. It's similar to our surge in early January.\nBLITZER: When do you think that would happen? Right now, let's say, 100,000 cases a day, as I said, six weeks\nago, 11,000 cases a day, when will it be 200,000 or 300,000?\nWALENSKY: I'm certainly hoping we don't have to see that. We don't want to see that. And so I'm really --- I'm\nopting for the let's unify as a country, put our masks on to prevent transmission of disease and get vaccinated in\nthe interim. What I would say is, you know, we can see these kinds of exponential rises we're seeing now in a\nmatter of weeks, but that's not where I'm heading?\nBLITZER: What about deaths? You said today we saw 614 new deaths reported to the CDC just on Tuesday of\nthis week. A few weeks ago, there were 100, 200, now more than 600. What does it look like as far as deaths are\nconcerned, deaths of Americans in the coming weeks and months?\nWALENSKY: This is a critically important point one. When we have seen this number of cases before, we have\nseen far more deaths. And what that means is that our vaccines are working to prevent deaths. So, they're\nworking to prevent hospitalizations and they're working to prevent deaths among those who are vaccinated. So\nthe best way to stop those deaths from happening is to get vaccinated.\nPage 4\n4 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nHome Live TV \nBLITZER: Are we nearing the peak of cases, Dr. Walensky, in the south in places like Florida, for example?\nWill we start to see case counts drop again anytime soon? WALENSKY: We have not seen that yet. We're still\nseeing exponential rises in Florida, in many -- in Louisiana and many of the southern states that are seeing these\nsurges. And so, no, we're not quite there yet. And I certainly hope that now we're taking these matters seriously.\nI'm grateful to the governor of Louisiana who put forward masking and mask mandates and I want to encourage\nothers, either leaders or to have the American public, pull together and wear their mask to prevent infecting\nothers.\nBLITZER: What are your models saying, Dr. Walensky, about the northeast, for example, where vaccination\nlevels are clearly higher? Should those states expect to see surges due to this awful delta variant as well?\nWALENSKY: We know how to protect ourselves. Many of those places are vaccinated in the areas that have\npockets of people who are unvaccinated. Again, we would encourage this will happen at the community level.\nSo we would encourage vaccination across those areas so that we don't have pockets of surges around areas that\nmight have been undervaccinated in the northeast region.\nBLITZER: There are some things I would like to clear up while I have you, Dr. Walensky. In terms of\ncommunication, you clearly have data that's informing your decisions or you wouldn't be making these\ndecisions. But a lot of experts are asking, why aren't you sharing that data right away or at least releasing it more\nquickly?\nWALENSKY: Last Tuesday, we made the decision to advice masking America among those who are fully\nvaccinated, and that was decision based on data that we had seen just several days before and corroborated\nwithin hours or a couple of days before. We made those recommendations based on data.\nWe had -- the data were released on Friday, just three days later. And if we had waited to release the data, we\nwould have had, you know, people who would unknowingly potentially bring virus to their loved ones, to their\nimmunosuppressed loved ones. We felt it a moral imperative to inform the American public as soon as we knew\nand publish the data as soon as we could within three days of our guidance.\nBLITZER: Yes. So that's really important to get that information out there. Do you think the CDC and others,\nfor example, got the messaging wrong when it comes to breakthrough cases, people who are fully vaccinated\nbut get COVID? Experts have insisted that breakthrough cases are rare, almost dismissing fears. But wouldn't it\nPage 5\n5 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nhave been better to give a more nuanced explanation about what to expect?\nHome Live TV \nWALENSKY: I think we all have to recognize that with 164 million people who are vaccinated, we should\nexpect tens of thousands, perhaps, of breakthrough infections. But the most important thing, it is not the number\nof the breakthrough infections but what happens here.\nThose breakthrough infections have mild illness. They are staying out of the hospital. They are not dying. And I\nthink that that's the most important thing to understand. We have a massive number of people who are\nvaccinated and those breakthrough infections tend to be mild and not severe.\nBLITZER: But what about all the fully vaccinated people who get the breakthrough infection? Can they pass it\non? Could they pass it on to their children? Could they pass the virus on to older people, especially more\nvulnerable people with underlying health conditions?\nWALENSKY: And that's exactly the point that we made in our guidance.\n[18:10:00]\nSo, yes, they can with the delta variant. And that was the reason that we changed our guidance last Tuesday. Our\nvaccines are working exceptionally well. They continue to work well with delta with regard to severe illness and\ndeath. They prevent it.\nBut what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission. So if you are going home to somebody who has not\nbeen vaccinated to somebody who can't get vaccinated, somebody who might be immunosuppressed or a little\nbit frail, somebody who has co-morbidities that put them at high risk, I would suggest you wear a mask in\npublic indoor settings.\nBLITZER: Especially if there is a breakthrough case and you get COVID, you're fully vaccinated but you are\ntotally asymptomatic, you can still pass on the virus to someone else. Is that right?\nWALENSKY: That's exactly right. And that's where our masking recommendation came from.\nBLITZER: It's so important these mask.\nPage 6\n6 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nWe're learning the FDA could lay out a national strategy, Dr. Walensky, for COVID-19 booster shots in early\nHome Live TV \nSeptember, just in a few weeks. What will the strategy look like? Who will be eligible for these boosters first, all\nof us who got two shots we might need after five or six months a third shot?\nWALENSKY: We're looking at those data carefully. Those data include looking at clinical cohorts, our clinical\ntrials, cohorts from across the country, our essential workers, long term-care facilities, health care workers who\nwere vaccinated early. And we're working closely with the FDA following those data and we'll come up with a\nplan soon in September.\nBLITZER: And do you think that before that will happen, the emergency use authorization for these vaccines\nwill be changed to complete and full authorization?\nWALENSKY: That lies squarely with the FDA. But I know that they're working very hard in order to get that\nfull approval because I recognize that -- we all recognize that some people are waiting for that approval to get\nvaccinated.\nBLITZER: So, what we're seeing in Israel, Germany and the United Kingdom right now, people are already\nstarting or about to start getting these third booster shots. We could brace for that, we should anticipate that\nhappening in the next few weeks here in the United States. Is that right?\nWALENSKY: We're having conversations with those countries and we're looking at the same data that they are\nlooking at and we are making our independent decisions looking at the data they have, collaborating with the\ndata we have and we'll make those decisions in collaboration with the FDA.\nBLITZER: All right. Well, I'm anxious to get my third shot if that's going to help. I'm sure a lot of people are\nanxious to get their third shot as well.\nWhy has the messaging from the CDC, Dr. Walensky, and other health experts for that matter on boosters at\nleast, so far, been unclear? First, we were told we wouldn't need boosters. Then we were told information was\ncoming. Other experts have said there is no evidence to support needing a booster. It's all been rather confusing.\nWALENSKY: We are following the science. There is immunologic data. Some people are following the\nimmunologic data and are reporting on the immunologic data. There is effectiveness data from those cohort\nstudies across the nation, tens of thousands of people. We have not yet seen a signal that we require boosters\nPage 7\n7 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nfrom those studies.\nHome Live TV \nSo, we're looking at many different areas and everybody is assessing the science. As that science evolves, we\nwill report that science to the American people.\nBLITZER: 12 million Americans got the Johnson & Johnson single dose vaccine. If they get a booster, will it be\nJohnson & Johnson or Moderna or Pfizer?\nWALENSKY: Those data are going to live with the FDA right now. They are looking at the data on what we're\ncalling crossover studies, whether what you got the first time, you would get the same thing or a different\nvaccine. Those data are with the FDA right now.\nBLITZER: So that hasn't been determined yet.\nYou have often said, Dr. Walensky, that what, 99 percent of the coronavirus deaths, 95 percent of the\nhospitalizations are among the unvaccinated. But when you were asked today by our Chief White House\nCorrespondent Kaitlan Collins, you said those numbers were from January through June, June, and didn't reflect\nthe data we have now from the delta variant, which I'm told by experts is entirely different than the older\nvariants, very highly transmissible, much more deadly. Do you have updated data that includes the delta variant?\nWALENSKY: We're working closely with the states and in touch with them in terms of their reporting. There\nwas a terrific Kaiser Family Foundation analysis that was done, including 25 states that suggested that those\ndata still hold, that over 99 percent of hospitalizations, over 99.9 percent of deaths still are in unvaccinated\npeople in these hospitals. BLITZER: So, when do you think we could expect to see the new data on\nbreakthrough hospitalizations and deaths? We're talking about fully vaccinated Americans in light of the delta\nvariant. And does it closely reflect the statistics you have been citing that almost entirely all the hospitalizations\nand deaths are among unvaccinated?\nWALENSKY: All of the data that I have seen to date have demonstrated that the severe disease, hospitalizations\nand deaths associated with COVID-19, even with the delta variant have suggested over 99 percent, the vast\nmajority of people are unvaccinated, which is why it is so very important to get the people vaccinated.\n[18:15:15]\nPage 8\n8 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nBLITZER: But if you are still evaluating the new data, why is President Biden, for example, still citing statistics\nHome Live TV \nthat don't necessarily take into account this awful delta variant?\nWALENSKY: You know, as the data come in, as we update the data, not all of our inpatients, for example, have\na genomic sequence associated with their test, so we're continually updating the data. It's a very fluid situation.\nBLITZER: How does the communication strategy evolve? Because there is a real serious problem out there, at\nleast right now, and hopefully it will go away, of confusion. A lot of us are confused by what we're hearing,\ndifferent things all the time.\nWALENSKY: The American public wants certainty. I want certainty. I think we all want certainty. We want to\nunderstand the path forward. And I completely understand that. My job is to evaluate the science. The science\nevery single day, hundreds of papers are being posted that evaluate the immunogenicity of our vaccines, how\nthey are working, the epidemiology of the delta variant both here and around the world. My job is to update that\nscience and to communicate that to the American people.\nBLITZER: I know Dr. Fauci said that about 93 million Americans right now are still unvaccinated. Do we know\nof that 93 million how many actually had COVID and have some antibodies built in? Do they need those who\nalready had COVID, do they need to get these two shots?\nWALENSKY: Importantly, yes, they do. So we know that the breadth and depth of your immune response is far\nexpanded when you get the vaccine and that it is important to get vaccinated even if you had COVID. You may\nhave had a different variant. We know now that your rates of getting COVID again are higher if you have not\nbeen vaccinated.\nBLITZER: And so do we know how many of the 93 million actually had COVID?\nWALENSKY: We have data, zero prevalence data across the nation, but I don't know that we can match the\npeople who have been unvaccinated with the zero prevalence data.\nBLITZER: With 96.1 percent of the U.S. population in areas which are described as high or substantial\ntransmission that are subject to updated masking guidelines indoors, are changes coming to the\nrecommendations from the CDC on masking outdoors as well?\nPage 9\n9 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nWALENSKY: Right now, we are not anticipating any changes to our guidance outdoors. Our guidance outdoors\nHome Live TV \nis if you are in crowded settings and you are unvaccinated, please do wear a mask. If you are vaccinated and you\nare going to see immunocompromised people in crowded settings, consider wearing a mask. And we don't\nanticipate those changes any time soon.\nBLITZER: So even if you are in a baseball game or an outdoor concert, will you should still be wearing a mask\nif there is a big crowd around you? Is that what I'm hearing?\nWALENSKY: If you are in a big crowd and you are unvaccinated, absolutely. And if you are vaccinated, we're\nleaving that to personal discretion.\nBLITZER: Dr. Fauci also says that even worse, an even worse -- this is awful to hear this -- an even worse\ncoronavirus variant could be coming beyond delta. Is there a specific variant you're watching right now with\nconcern?\nWALENSKY: We're watching numerous variants as they emerge. I don't have one that is more concerning right\nnow in addition to delta. What I can say though is that the more we have viral replication, the more we have\ntransmission, the more we are at risk of a new and emerging variant, and that is why it is so very critical to get\nvaccinated not just for yourself, for your own personal health, to protect you from severe disease and death but\nto protect you from transmission to others as well as to protect all of us from seeing a more aggressive emerging\nvariant.\nBLITZER: I'm so worried about a new variant that's even worse than delta. And the question is, Dr. Walensky,\nwill our current vaccines hold up against the next, the next variant?\nWALENSKY: That's, of course, the concern. And we will have to see what this virus brings. What I can say is\nthat the virus generally mutates and those mutations hold because it is advantageous to the virus. So our job now\nis to squash the virus and to do so by decreasing chains of transmission through vaccination and masking in the\ninterim.\nBLITZER: Among the vaccinated right now, the fully vaccinated and, you know, that's a huge part of the\ncountry, are there populations within the fully vaccinated, Dr. Walensky, who are a more vulnerable right now?\nWALENSKY: Among the fully vaccinated, certainly those who are most immunosuppressed, we know that their\nPage 10\n10 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\npopulations, people had solid organ transplants, people undergoing chemotherapy, people on immune\nHome Live TV \nmodulating agents.\n[18:20:04]\nWe know that those people, despite having been fully vaccinated, they received two doses, may not have\ncomplete protection.\nBLITZER: Is there any update on when kids, children under 12, will be able to get vaccinated?\nWALENSKY: So those data are, of course, going to be with the FDA. I haven't seen them and I'm looking\nforward to when we will see them hopefully in the next, you know, several months, in the fall. You know,\nhopefully in the fall before the end of the calendar year.\nBLITZER: And I have heard that we're talking about kids 5 to 11 who will be next in line to start getting\nvaccinated. Is that right?\nWALENSKY: Indeed. And in the meantime, please know that the best way to protect your unvaccinated\nchildren is to surround them with vaccinated people.\nBLITZER: And to wear masks even if you are vaccinated potentially, right?\nWALENSKY: In public indoor settings so that you can shed it when you come home.\nBLITZER: As children across the nation are returning and preparing to return to school right now, is an increase\nin cases around the country, Dr. Walensky, inevitable?\nWALENSKY: I think it's really clear that we know how to keep our children safe. We know how to keep our\nschools safe. Disease comes into the schools from high rates in the community. We know how to keep our\ncommunity safe. Our children deserve to have full-time in person safe learning with prevention measures in\nplace, and that includes masking for everyone in schools.\nBLITZER: Are you getting any early data from places like Georgia, for example, where schools are back in\nsession right now, are you getting any new information already coming in, or is it too early?\nPage 11\n11 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nHome Live TV \nWALENSKY: What I can tell you is that we have been following this through the summer both in camps and\nsummer schools and where places did not enforce mitigation strategies, masking, those are the summer schools\nthat had a challenge and had to close down.\nBLITZER: What is your reaction to the Florida governor's decision to prevent schools throughout the state of\nFlorida from mandating masks, warning they would be denied state funding if they were to do so?\nWALENSKY: I'm a physician. I want our children to be safe. I want them to be safe wherever they live. The\nbest way to keep them safe is to surround them by vaccinated people and to have them where masks in school. I\nwant our kids back to school and I want them back safely, and I want them to be able to safely stay there.\nBLITZER: Me too. I think everybody watching wants the kids to be safe in the most effective way.\nWhen did the president, Dr. Walensky, first approach you guys over at the CDC about finding ways to extend\nwhat's called the eviction moratorium following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June? There are a lot of\nnervous people out there who are fearful that they're going to be kicked out of their homes and become\nhomeless.\nWALENSKY: As we have seen the case counts go up and knowing that this eviction moratorium end date was\ngoing to impose hundreds of thousands of people were going to have to find congregate settings to live in, we\ndecided to update a new -- well, actually provide a new tailored eviction moratorium so that our places where\nthere was the most disease would not be an increased public health risk by having all of these families and\npeople need to find shelter in congregate settings.\nBLITZER: So, there are millions of Americans who have not even gotten one shot right now. What is your\nmessage to them? Are there any of those millions who shouldn't be getting a vaccine right now? What's the\ndownside of potentially getting a vaccine?\nWALENSKY: My message to those people is to get the information you need. Get it from a trusted source, get it\nfrom somebody who understands the science behind it because I do think that if you talk to the people who\nunderstand the science, who are trusted to you, you will not need to be convinced to get the vaccine. You will be\nasking for it.\nPage 12\n12 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nBLITZER: I have asked you a lot of questions, Dr. Walensky.

This is a difficult, hard, frustrating time. We share that\nfrustration, and we are updating the science and will convey it to you as soon as we have it.\nBLITZER: And should we be bracing for the situation to get worse before it gets better?\nWALENSKY: I think we should be bracing for a unified nation that can come together and realize that the\ncommon foe is COVID-19.\nBLITZER: It certainly is.

But\nwhat this does mean is that the interviews of the former Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and his Deputy\nRichard Donoghue, they will now be delayed. They were expected to happen this week.\nAnd, of course, Rosen and Donoghue, they are expected to eventually give crucial insight into how a Trump ally\nwithin the Justice Department, Jeffrey Clark, pushed other top DOJ officials to back those false claims of\nelection fraud.\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nJEFFREY CLARK, FORMER ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good morning. I'm Jeff Clark. I'm the\nhead of the Civil Division.\nSCHNEIDER: Jeffrey Clark was in charge of a Department at DOJ that would have had no role investigating\nvoter proud.

GERRY CONNOLLY (D-VA): Jeffrey Clark, you're a subordinate at DOJ, reportedly told you that your\ndays as acting attorney general were numbered and that DOJ was going to stop Congress from certifying the\nelection results, is that true?\nJEFFREY ROSEN, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Congressman, the items you are talking\nabout, I have seen media accounts.\nSCHNEIDER: Jeffrey Rosen has never publically confirmed the intense pressure campaign coming from Clark\nPage 14\n14 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nto get the DOJ to help overturn the election for Trump. But new documents and details uncovered in connection\nHome Live TV \nwith an in-depth probe from the House Oversight Committee shows just how far Clark went. A draft letter dated\nDecember 28, 2020 details how Clark planned to write Georgia officials to falsely say DOJ had found voting\nirregularities that impacted the election outcome in several states. He wanted Rosen and Rosen's deputy, Richard\nDonoghue, to sign on, but they flat-out refused with Donoghue responding by email, there is no chance that I\nwould sign this letter or anything remotely like this. From where I stand, this is not even within the realm the\npossibility.\nDAVID LAUFMAN, FORMER DOJ CHIEF OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE: It signifies how perilously close\nwe came to the Department of Justice being weaponized.\nSCHNEIDER: Clark's draft letter was dated December 28th, one day after Trump called Rosen and Donoghue,\ntelling them, just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen,\naccording to hand written notes of the exchange. Days later, Trump was on the phone with Georgia's secretary\nof state pleading.\nTRUMP: All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have.\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I certainly hope that the U.S. Justice Department, as well as Georgia officials,\nare studying the president's conduct because it seems to cross the line into illegality.\nSCHNEIDER: There is no known federal investigation of Trump or Clark, but former Assistant U.S. Attorney\nElie Honig laid out the possible crimes both could hypothetically be charged with.\nELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: It is a federal crime to deprive a state of a fair election. It is\na federal crime to solicit false counting of ballots, false certification of an election. It is a federal crime to\nconspire against the United States.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nSCHNEIDER (on camera): But for now, any criminal charges are extremely unlikely with Congress taking the\nlead on this investigation of this issue.\nAnd as for Jeffrey Clark, there is no indication he's facing any backlash in the legal community since he was just\nPage 15\n15 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nhired last month to be chief of litigation for a conservative law firm.\nHome Live TV \nBut, Wolf, we reached out to his representative.

No word on when.\nBLITZER: Yes. I suspect he will be at least subpoenaed if he doesn't voluntarily want to show up. All right,\nJessica, thank you very much.\nLet's discuss this with our Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, our Chief Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin\nand our Senior Legal Analyst, Laura Coates.\nJeffrey, as a former Federal Prosecutor yourself, how outrageous was this behavior by Jeffrey Clark to\nessentially attempt a coup from inside the U.S. Justice Department?\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: You know, it is really bad but it is not nearly as bad as\nwhat his boss, his ultimate boss, Donald Trump, did. I think Jeffrey Clark was simply acting out the abuse of\npower that the president was engaged in.\nYou know, what's gone on here with the president is so much like what he did when he told the president of\nUkraine that he should come up with dirt on President Biden or lose government money. I'm not sure it's a\ncrime. I don't think any of this, frankly, is criminal in nature. But it would have been impeachable if the\npresident stayed in office and I think it's an abuse of presidential power, which is, in many respects, more\nimportant than a crime.\nBLITZER: Well, Laura Coates, what do you think?\nLAURA COATES, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's outrageous that somebody who would\nnot even oversee elections or voting as the head of the civil division, I was in the civil rights division in the\nvoting section at one point in my career.\n[18:35:08]\nPage 16\n16 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nAnd the idea that it would originate from Jeffrey Clark in a way that actually was adopted by a number of\nHome Live TV \njurisdictions who wanted to promote this big lie and this thought that otherwise fair and free election was\nanything but that.\nThe good news here is that his superiors decided that they were not going to do that, that they refused to do so,\nthat they weren't going to be essentially those who are going to be the vehicles of misinformation in this respect.\nBut what's very troubling here is that the goal was to plant the seeds that ultimately were germinated by people,\nthat ultimately still for people who either when they're looking at the attack on the citadel of our democracy on\nJanuary 6th or to this day still very much believe that this election was stolen, he was effective in that respect to\ntry to perpetuate it.\nAnd that, you know, it is always this gap, as Jeffrey talked about, between what is criminal and what ought to be\nillegal. Surely it is unethical. He knew better. We know that in a court of law they would never have promoted\nthese theories because there was no basis. And don't take my word for it. Take the former attorney general,\nWilliam Barr, who himself said he saw no evidence of widespread voter fraud or otherwise.\nBLITZER: Yes. That's exactly right.\nYou know, Dana, we saw the effort, the violent effort to try to overturn the election unfold during the January\n6th insurrection but there was a quiet effort going on behind the scenes inside the Justice Department.\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And, I mean look, they were very much\nconnected, as Laura was just saying, that what was going on inside the Justice Department was, no doubt, at the\nbehest of the president of the United States.\nWhat happened on January 6th was because of what the president of the United States and those around him\nwere perpetuating, a lie that they were perpetuating up until and including that day, that rally on January 6th. So\nthey are very much connected. They are just different avenues that people who were doing the now former\npresident's bidding were going down.\nAnd, you know, what is interesting about what Jessica was reporting about, the fact that Congress as the select\ncommittee and the fact that they're going to try to interview these individuals that we have been reporting on,\nthat that might be why DOJ, the Biden Justice Department, will hold off on even considering whether there is\nPage 17\n17 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\ncriminal charges to be had here. But they're definitely different things.\nHome Live TV \nI mean, what Congress has to do is get information for the historical record. They don't have the ability to\ncriminally prosecute. That is DOJ. It might just kick the can down the road a little bit. But it doesn't -- I don't\nthink, unless their legal colleagues think so that they're mutually exclusive.\nBLITZER: Well, let me bring Jeffrey back into this conversation. Jeffrey as you know, a lot of Democrats\nthey're looking to the Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate this, restore integrity over the\nDepartment of Justice. Does he need to take a more aggressive approach here?\nTOOBIN: Well, I certainly think there is no problem with an investigation. But, you know, one -- everything we\nare outraged by is not a crime. And I think, you know, it is very important if you believe in civil liberties to limit\ncriminal violations, limit the prosecution of criminal violations to actual, provable violations of federal law.\nI'm not sure that Jeffrey Clark's letter -- in fact, I would be surprised if that is a violation of any criminal law. It\nis outrageous. It should be condemned. But I think we need to keep a clear line between what's criminal and\nwhat's merely outrageous. And the Justice Department, at least so far, seems very determined to do that.\nBLITZER: Laura?\nCOATES: And, you know, on that thought, if I could, you know, one way to find out if there is truly criminal\nbehavior and violations of our federal law is through discovery, in interviews. And what the DOJ, the Justice\nDepartment has done essentially through Merrick Garland, excuse me, has been to say, we're not even going to\nassert the executive privilege that would effectively muzzle those people who would have the information, who\ncould lead that determination. They decided they're not going to assert executive privilege, which normally has\nbeen a roadblock that says, you might want transparency, but we don't have to give it to you. It could include not\nonly Jeffrey Rosen and other people involved in this chain of communication. But including there was a U.S.\nattorney in the state of Georgia who abruptly resigned. Is there a correlation to this big lie that was promoted by\nthis person as well? Then you have an even bigger story.\nSo we are really at a premature level now to decide that it is not criminal and the investigation should unfold to\nfigure out if it, in fact, is. But either way, the DOJ is not putting up a roadblock that was up in full effect just a\nfew months ago.\nPage 18\n18 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nTOOBIN: Merrick Garland has said he's not going to assert attorney client privilege, but President Trump has\nHome Live TV \nalready said he is going to try to stop his former subordinates from testifying. I don't know if he can do that, but\nhe can get these people to go to court.\n[18:40:02]\nAnd if they go to court, it could delay their testimony for months, and that may be as good as stopping it\naltogether.\nBLITZER: All right. Jeffrey, thank you. Laura and Dana, thanks to you guys as well.\nComing up, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, is yet to resign. But as pressure mounts, is a resignation\nnear? Stay with us. You're in The Situation Room.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\nBLITZER: The New York State impeachment investigation into Governor Andrew Cuomo appears to be\nnearing a conclusion. Let's get some more from CNN's Erica Hill. Erica, how quickly could Governor Cuomo\nbe impeached?\n[18:45:00]\nERICA HILL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The short answer is pretty quickly. So, as you point out,\na letter was sent today to Governor Cuomo's attorneys, noting that the Judiciary Committee's impeachment\ninvestigations are nearing completion and inviting the governor's attorneys to submit any additional evidence\nthat they would like.\nNow, we know that the deadline for submitting that additional evidence is next Friday, August 13th, 5:00 p.m.\nSo articles obviously won't be introduced before that.\nI can tell you that we earned earlier this week from an assembly speaker who said that everything that developed\non Tuesday in that AG's report meant they were going to move expeditiously to conclude this investigation as\nsoon as possible. Now, both the governor's attorney and his director of communications responding to that letter\nsaid this morning, they both side they would cooperate. We're grateful for the opportunity, essentially, to\nPage 19\n19 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\ncontribute more information. I should point out his attorney took the opportunity to criticize the\nHome Live TV \nAG's report accusing the investigators acting as prosecutor, judge and jury rather than independent fact finders.\nWOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Is there any indication, Erica, that Governor Cuomo will resign? Because this\ncertainly seems like, at least for now, that he's digging in.\nHILL: Yeah, I think you hit the nail in the head. I think he is digging in. We see that in a response from his\nattorneys. We know there have been a number of public calls for him to resign. A lot of people telling him he\nshould not go through this impeachment process.\nWe learned a little bit about what some of those conversations may have been like behind the scenes. Jay\nJacobs, the head of the state's Democratic Party, sharing the governor's response to his conversation with him\nwhen he urged the governor to resign.\nTake a listen.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJAY JACOBS, NEW YORK DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE CHAIR: He didn't characterize, you know, his\nviews on resignation. He was more directed to how he was going to defend himself. I think he feels that he\nwants his moment to tell the public his side of the story.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nHILL: Jay Jacobs saying that taped statement the governor put out on Tuesday after the AG's report was\nreleased likely didn't land the way he thought it would and perhaps his team. But interesting to note there that\nthe governor in the phone call with Jay Jacobs was more focused on his defense, on telling what he referred to\nas his side of the story. I think we got a little sense of that in that taped statement and even in some of the\nstatements we saw today.\nBLITZER: All right. Erica, thank you very much.\nLet's get some analysis from the Washington correspondent for \"The New York Times\", Maggie Haberman.\nPage 20\n20 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nShe's also a CNN political analyst.\nHome Live TV \nMaggie, is it resign or face impeachment at this point, or does Governor Cuomo think he has other options to\ncling to power? Because any support he thinks he might have seems to be crumbling.\nMAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Wolf, if there was an impeachment vote today,\nGovernor Cuomo would be impeached and pushed out through a Senate trial that I cannot imagine he would\nwant to go through. It's not today. So, I think he is gong to try to roll the dice and hang on as long as he can, and\nhope that he can change some lawmakers' minds. That seems very unlikely just based on the statements that we\nhave seen, and just based on the crumbling of support, nearly universal that has taken place among his key\nsupports, black leaders, union leaders, a number of state assembly officials, among Democrats and every\nRepublican would vote in favor of impeachment.\nSo, it is hard to see how buying time is going to help him. It is not surprising that's what he's doing unlike, Wolf,\nin 2002 when he dropped out of the race for governor a couple of days before the Democratic primary, that he\nwas going to lose. He still had a future, and so that was his calculation in doing that.\nHe does not have a political future now. He is a much older man. There are not many options. That report is\nseen as very damning.\nAnd so, I think he will ride this out as soon as possible. The prospect of being impeached I think is devastating\nto him. I think as it gets closer, if the facts don't change, if he can't corral any lawmakers to his side, then I think\nit is more than likely that he'll resign.\nBLITZER: Nixon decided that he would resign rather than get impeached and convicted.\nHABERMAN: Right.\nBLITZER: The letter says the New York state assembly will consider potential articles of impeachment. How\nquickly could the dominos fall once that happens?\nHABERMAN: It really depends, Wolf. It could happen fairly quickly. There could be a vote within several days\nof that happening. There's a push by Republicans to try to have various probes that are going on into the New\nYork governor. It takes place in this impeachment probe at the same time, or at least be part of the same\nPage 21\n21 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nimpeachment vote. That's all going to get ironed out.\nHome Live TV \nBut it could happen very quickly. Remember, there is no hard and fast rule in New York state's laws about how\nthis impeachment process would go. They get to sort of make it up as they go along. Again, I don't think that\nAndrew Cuomo will stick it out for a trial. I think when there is a vote nearing is when you will see a potential\nbreaking report.\nBLITZER: According to the report released this week, Governor Cuomo never bothered to complete his own\nsexual harassment training program, while at the same time he was harassing women, touting himself as a leader\non this issue.\n[18:50:10]\nDoes that speak to how he operates?\nHABERMAN: What I think it speaks to is a culture in that office. Again, I do want to say, you'd have to read the\nreport. I think he says he doesn't remember whether that's true. It speaks to the fact that there is an important\naspect of I think it's gotten overlooked a lot.\nIt isn't that he's accused of harassing multiple women, 11 women working in his office. It's that he created a\nworkplace culture of toxicity after passing laws against such a thing. So, it wasn't just that he was harassing, is\nthat he was violating his own laws, to your point.\nI don't know it speaks to how he operates necessarily. I think it speaks to the fact that he was more than willing\nto act as if -- actually he was more than willing to put into place laws that essentially, according to this report, he\nwas not willing to follow along with, and refer other people. The idea that you would have a subordinate fill out\nand complete training that you have subjected other people to in their workplace speaks volumes about, you\nknow, sort of how he views power.\nNow, again, he has denied all this. I am really curious to see what their denials are, because they keep stressing\nemphatically that they're going to have them. What we saw is frankly, we're not much of a defense at all. So,\nwe'll see where this goes.\nBLITZER: We certainly will.\nPage 22\n22 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nHome Live TV \nMaggie Haberman, thank you very much.\nJust ahead, the Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson is standing by. He will join us live. We will discuss the\nworst of the coronavirus surge and the role mask can play in fighting it.\nWe'll be right back.\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n[18:55:53]\nBLITZER: The coronavirus pandemic is surging all across the United States with the CDC now reporting more\nthan 100,000 cases in a single day and the situation is especially dire in places with low vaccination rates. For\nthat and more, I want to bring in the governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson.\nGovernor, thank you so much for joining us.\nAs you know, the coronavirus transmission is soaring in your state right now. You say you regret signing a bill\nearlier this year that banned mass requirements in schools. So, why did you think putting a ban in place was a\ngood idea? What are you doing now to correct that mistake?\nGOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): Well, at the time that we put that law into place, that banned mask\nmandates but also vaccine passports, our cases were very, very low. It looked like we were at the end of this\npandemic. I felt comfortable at the time signing it.\nAnd obviously, this virus threw us another curve. The delta variant came in. Our cases have gone up. And now\nwe're looking at going back to school, and our focus is on the vaccines. But there is still a gap there, because\nunder 12 cannot be vaccinated. We need some method and flexibility from local school districts to protect them.\nSo I called the general assembly back into session and the governor to\naddress this gap and ask them to give flexibility to local school districts, so if they decided to cover those that\nare under 12 that can't be vaccinated with face coverings, to protect them, then that's their prerogative. That is a\nlocal decision-making.\nPage 23\n23 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nHome Live TV \nThe legislatures been meeting for a couple days. They have not reached approval of this. They'll come back\ntomorrow and it's also in the courts being reviewed as to whether that law is constitutional.\nSo we'll see how this develops tomorrow. But that's the reason I called them back into session.\nBLITZER: Well, it's a good reason, because this delta variant, as you know, is highly, highly transmissible.\nMuch worse than the original virus.\nWhat's your message, Governor, to some of your fellow Republican governors who are fueling misinformation\nabout simply wearing a mask, including the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has gone so far as to threaten\nto pull funding from local school districts that actually would institute mask mandates?\nHUTCHINSON: Well, Wolf, I'm not getting into what's happening in Florida. That's the beauty of our system,\nthat every state and governor manages it with their legislature and it reflects the culture of their state.\nSo, I just got a look at what we are doing here in Arkansas and this made common sense to me. One, promoting\nvaccines, we've got to get those out. That's the first level. Secondly, there is the gap again.\nAnd my judgment is that's a conservative view that local school districts out to be able to make decisions,\nthemselves. Some of the rural ones will say, no, we don't need that. Other urban school districts, they want to\nhave more protection. They might adopt that protective measure and they ought to have the right to do that. It's\nvery simple. That's the approach.\nBLITZER: But if they want to go ahead and mandate masks, you wouldn't pull state funding to those school\ndistricts, would you?\nHUTCHINSON: Well, no. I mean, again, I believe they ought to have that prerogative particularly whenever\nthey're under 12.\nBut that's -- that's local control. Whenever you are looking at -- I think the debate we're getting off track here,\nthe debate right now is on masks and it shouldn't be. It ought to be on the work of getting vaccines out. That's\nthe number one --\nPage 24\n24 of 27 9/12/2021, 7:30 PM\n\nCNN.com - Transcripts http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2108/05/sitroom.02.html\nEXHIBIT F\nBLITZER: Right.\nHome Live TV \nHUTCHINSON: -- priority that I have. But we got that gap we got to cover.\nBLITZER: And you want everyone in Arkansas to get vaccinated, right? HUTCHINSON: Well, absolutely. I've\ngone to I believe it's 12 cities. I\nwill be going to two more cities next week having conversations for those that doubt, have questions, honesty.\nWe're not shaming anybody, providing good information.\nBLITZER: That's so, so important.
